It has been made available through the kind permission of\r\nHonorable Herbert C. Hoover and Mr. Edgar Rickard, Author and Publisher,\r\nrespectively, of the original volume.\r\n\r\nPRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATORS' PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three objectives in translation of works of this character: to\r\ngive a faithful, literal translation of the author's statements; to give\r\nthese in a manner which will interest the reader; and to preserve, so\r\nfar as is possible, the style of the original text. The task has been\r\ndoubly difficult in this work because, in using Latin, the author\r\navailed himself of a medium which had ceased to expand a thousand years\r\nbefore his subject had in many particulars come into being; in\r\nconsequence he was in difficulties with a large number of ideas for\r\nwhich there were no corresponding words in the vocabulary at his\r\ncommand, and instead of adopting into the text his native German terms,\r\nhe coined several hundred Latin expressions to answer his needs. It is\r\nupon this rock that most former attempts at translation have been\r\nwrecked. Except for a very small number, we believe we have been able to\r\ndiscover the intended meaning of such expressions from a study of the\r\ncontext, assisted by a very incomplete glossary prepared by the author\r\nhimself, and by an exhaustive investigation into the literature of these\r\nsubjects during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. That discovery\r\nin this particular has been only gradual and obtained after much labour,\r\nmay be indicated by the fact that the entire text has been\r\nre-typewritten three times since the original, and some parts more\r\noften; and further, that the printer's proof has been thrice revised. We\r\nhave found some English equivalent, more or less satisfactory, for\r\npractically all such terms, except those of weights, the varieties of\r\nveins, and a few minerals. In the matter of weights we have introduced\r\nthe original Latin, because it is impossible to give true equivalents\r\nand avoid the fractions of reduction; and further, as explained in the\r\nAppendix on Weights it is impossible to say in many cases what scale the\r\nAuthor had in mind. The English nomenclature to be adopted has given\r\ngreat difficulty, for various reasons; among them, that many methods and\r\nprocesses described have never been practised in English-speaking mining\r\ncommunities, and so had no representatives in our vocabulary, and we\r\nconsidered the introduction of German terms undesirable; other methods\r\nand processes have become obsolete and their descriptive terms with\r\nthem, yet we wished to avoid the introduction of obsolete or unusual\r\nEnglish; but of the greatest importance of all has been the necessity to\r\navoid rigorously such modern technical terms as would imply a greater\r\nscientific understanding than the period possessed.\r\n\r\nAgricola's Latin, while mostly free from mediaeval corruption, is\r\nsomewhat tainted with German construction. Moreover some portions have\r\nnot the continuous flow of sustained thought which others display, but\r\nthe fact that the writing of the work extended over a period of twenty\r\nyears, sufficiently explains the considerable variation in style. The\r\ntechnical descriptions in the later books often take the form of\r\nHouse-that-Jack-built sentences which have had to be at least partially\r\nbroken up and the subject occasionally re-introduced. Ambiguities were\r\nalso sometimes found which it was necessary to carry on into the\r\ntranslation. Despite these criticisms we must, however, emphasize that\r\nAgricola was infinitely clearer in his style than his contemporaries\r\nupon such subjects, or for that matter than his successors in almost any\r\nlanguage for a couple of centuries. All of the illustrations and display\r\nletters of the original have been reproduced and the type as closely\r\napproximates to the original as the printers have been able to find in a\r\nmodern font.\r\n\r\nThere are no footnotes in the original text, and Mr. Hoover is\r\nresponsible for them all. He has attempted in them to give not only such\r\ncomment as would tend to clarify the text, but also such information as\r\nwe have been able to discover with regard to the previous history of the\r\nsubjects mentioned. We have confined the historical notes to the time\r\nprior to Agricola, because to have carried them down to date in the\r\nbriefest manner would have demanded very much more space than could be\r\nallowed. In the examination of such technical and historical material\r\none is appalled at the flood of mis-information with regard to ancient\r\narts and sciences which has been let loose upon the world by the hands\r\nof non-technical translators and commentators. At an early stage we\r\nconsidered that we must justify any divergence of view from such\r\nauthorities, but to limit the already alarming volume of this work, we\r\nlater felt compelled to eliminate most of such discussion. When the\r\nhalf-dozen most important of the ancient works bearing upon science have\r\nbeen translated by those of some scientific experience, such questions\r\nwill, no doubt, be properly settled.\r\n\r\nWe need make no apologies for _De Re Metallica_. During 180 years it was\r\nnot superseded as the text-book and guide to miners and metallurgists,\r\nfor until Schlueter's great work on metallurgy in 1738 it had no equal.\r\nThat it passed through some ten editions in three languages at a period\r\nwhen the printing of such a volume was no ordinary undertaking, is in\r\nitself sufficient evidence of the importance in which it was held, and\r\nis a record that no other volume upon the same subjects has equalled\r\nsince. A large proportion of the technical data given by Agricola was\r\neither entirely new, or had not been given previously with sufficient\r\ndetail and explanation to have enabled a worker in these arts himself to\r\nperform the operations without further guidance. Practically the whole\r\nof it must have been given from personal experience and observation, for\r\nthe scant library at his service can be appreciated from his own\r\nPreface. Considering the part which the metallic arts have played in\r\nhuman history, the paucity of their literature down to Agricola's time\r\nis amazing. No doubt the arts were jealously guarded by their\r\npractitioners as a sort of stock-in-trade, and it is also probable that\r\nthose who had knowledge were not usually of a literary turn of mind;\r\nand, on the other hand, the small army of writers prior to his time\r\nwere not much interested in the description of industrial pursuits.\r\nMoreover, in those thousands of years prior to printing, the tedious and\r\nexpensive transcription of manuscripts by hand was mostly applied to\r\nmatters of more general interest, and therefore many writings may have\r\nbeen lost in consequence. In fact, such was the fate of the works of\r\nTheophrastus and Strato on these subjects.\r\n\r\nWe have prepared a short sketch of Agricola's life and times, not only\r\nto give some indication of his learning and character, but also of his\r\nconsiderable position in the community in which he lived. As no\r\nappreciation of Agricola's stature among the founders of science can be\r\ngained without consideration of the advance which his works display over\r\nthose of his predecessors, we therefore devote some attention to the\r\nstate of knowledge of these subjects at the time by giving in the\r\nAppendix a short review of the literature then extant and a summary of\r\nAgricola's other writings. To serve the bibliophile we present such data\r\nas we have been able to collect it with regard to the various editions\r\nof his works. The full titles of the works quoted in the footnotes under\r\nsimply authors' names will be found in this Appendix.\r\n\r\nWe feel that it is scarcely doing Agricola justice to publish _De Re\r\nMetallica_ only. While it is of the most general interest of all of his\r\nworks, yet, from the point of view of pure science, _De Natura\r\nFossilium_ and _De Ortu et Causis_ are works which deserve an equally\r\nimportant place. It is unfortunate that Agricola's own countrymen have\r\nnot given to the world competent translations into German, as his work\r\nhas too often been judged by the German translations, the infidelity of\r\nwhich appears in nearly every paragraph.\r\n\r\nWe do not present _De Re Metallica_ as a work of \"practical\" value. The\r\nmethods and processes have long since been superseded; yet surely such a\r\nmilestone on the road of development of one of the two most basic of\r\nhuman industrial activities is more worthy of preservation than the\r\nthousands of volumes devoted to records of human destruction. To those\r\ninterested in the history of their own profession we need make no\r\napologies, except for the long delay in publication. For this we put\r\nforward the necessity of active endeavour in many directions; as this\r\nbook could be but a labour of love, it has had to find the moments for\r\nits execution in night hours, weekends, and holidays, in all extending\r\nover a period of about five years. If the work serves to strengthen the\r\ntraditions of one of the most important and least recognized of the\r\nworld's professions we shall be amply repaid.\r\n\r\nIt is our pleasure to acknowledge our obligations to Professor H. R.\r\nFairclough, of Stanford University, for perusal of and suggestions upon\r\nthe first chapter; and to those whom we have engaged from time to time\r\nfor one service or another, chiefly bibliographical work and collateral\r\ntranslation. We are also sensibly obligated to the printers, Messrs.\r\nFrost & Sons, for their patience and interest, and for their willingness\r\nto bend some of the canons of modern printing, to meet the demands of\r\nthe 16th Century.\r\n\r\n                                        _July 1, 1912._\r\n\r\n    The Red House,\r\n    Hornton Street, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY.[1]\r\n\r\nGeorgius Agricola was born at Glauchau, in Saxony, on March 24th, 1494,\r\nand therefore entered the world when it was still upon the threshold of\r\nthe Renaissance; Gutenberg's first book had been printed but forty years\r\nbefore; the Humanists had but begun that stimulating criticism which\r\nawoke the Reformation; Erasmus, of Rotterdam, who was subsequently to\r\nbecome Agricola's friend and patron, was just completing his student\r\ndays. The Reformation itself was yet to come, but it was not long\r\ndelayed, for Luther was born the year before Agricola, and through him\r\nAgricola's homeland became the cradle of the great movement; nor did\r\nAgricola escape being drawn into the conflict. Italy, already awake with\r\nthe new classical revival, was still a busy workshop of antiquarian\r\nresearch, translation, study, and publication, and through her the Greek\r\nand Latin Classics were only now available for wide distribution.\r\nStudents from the rest of Europe, among them at a later time Agricola\r\nhimself, flocked to the Italian Universities, and on their return\r\ninfected their native cities with the newly-awakened learning. At\r\nAgricola's birth Columbus had just returned from his great discovery,\r\nand it was only three years later that Vasco Da Gama rounded Cape Good\r\nHope. Thus these two foremost explorers had only initiated that greatest\r\nperiod of geographical expansion in the world's history. A few dates\r\nwill recall how far this exploration extended during Agricola's\r\nlifetime. Balboa first saw the Pacific in 1513; Cortes entered the City\r\nof Mexico in 1520; Magellan entered the Pacific in the same year;\r\nPizarro penetrated into Peru in 1528; De Soto landed in Florida in 1539,\r\nand Potosi was discovered in 1546. Omitting the sporadic settlement on\r\nthe St. Lawrence by Cartier in 1541, the settlement of North America did\r\nnot begin for a quarter of a century after Agricola's death. Thus the\r\nrevival of learning, with its train of Humanism, the Reformation, its\r\nstimulation of exploration and the re-awakening of the arts and\r\nsciences, was still in its infancy with Agricola.\r\n\r\nWe know practically nothing of Agricola's antecedents or his youth. His\r\nreal name was Georg Bauer (\"peasant\"), and it was probably Latinized by\r\nhis teachers, as was the custom of the time. His own brother, in\r\nreceipts preserved in the archives of the Zwickau Town Council, calls\r\nhimself \"Bauer,\" and in them refers to his brother \"Agricola.\" He\r\nentered the University of Leipsic at the age of twenty, and after about\r\nthree and one-half years' attendance there gained the degree of\r\n_Baccalaureus Artium_. In 1518 he became Vice-Principal of the Municipal\r\nSchool at Zwickau, where he taught Greek and Latin. In 1520 he became\r\nPrincipal, and among his assistants was Johannes Foerster, better known\r\nas Luther's collaborator in the translation of the Bible. During this\r\ntime our author prepared and published a small Latin Grammar[2]. In 1522\r\nhe removed to Leipsic to become a lecturer in the University under his\r\nfriend, Petrus Mosellanus, at whose death in 1524 he went to Italy for\r\nthe further study of Philosophy, Medicine, and the Natural Sciences.\r\nHere he remained for nearly three years, from 1524 to 1526. He visited\r\nthe Universities of Bologna, Venice, and probably Padua, and at these\r\ninstitutions received his first inspiration to work in the sciences, for\r\nin a letter[3] from Leonardus Casibrotius to Erasmus we learn that he\r\nwas engaged upon a revision of Galen. It was about this time that he\r\nmade the acquaintance of Erasmus, who had settled at Basel as Editor for\r\nFroben's press.\r\n\r\nIn 1526 Agricola returned to Zwickau, and in 1527 he was chosen town\r\nphysician at Joachimsthal. This little city in Bohemia is located on the\r\neastern slope of the Erzgebirge, in the midst of the then most prolific\r\nmetal-mining district of Central Europe. Thence to Freiberg is but fifty\r\nmiles, and the same radius from that city would include most of the\r\nmining towns so frequently mentioned in _De Re Metallica_--Schneeberg,\r\nGeyer, Annaberg and Altenberg--and not far away were Marienberg,\r\nGottesgab, and Platten. Joachimsthal was a booming mining camp, founded\r\nbut eleven years before Agricola's arrival, and already having several\r\nthousand inhabitants. According to Agricola's own statement[4], he spent\r\nall the time not required for his medical duties in visiting the mines\r\nand smelters, in reading up in the Greek and Latin authors all\r\nreferences to mining, and in association with the most learned among the\r\nmining folk. Among these was one Lorenz Berman, whom Agricola afterward\r\nset up as the \"learned miner\" in his dialogue _Bermannus_. This book was\r\nfirst published by Froben at Basel in 1530, and was a sort of catechism\r\non mineralogy, mining terms, and mining lore. The book was apparently\r\nfirst submitted to the great Erasmus, and the publication arranged by\r\nhim, a warm letter of approval by him appearing at the beginning of the\r\nbook[5]. In 1533 he published _De Mensuris et Ponderibus_, through\r\nFroben, this being a discussion of Roman and Greek weights and measures.\r\nAt about this time he began _De Re Metallica_--not to be published for\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nAgricola did not confine his interest entirely to medicine and mining,\r\nfor during this period he composed a pamphlet upon the Turks, urging\r\ntheir extermination by the European powers. This work was no doubt\r\ninspired by the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1529. It appeared first in\r\nGerman in 1531, and in Latin--in which it was originally written--in\r\n1538, and passed through many subsequent editions.\r\n\r\nAt this time, too, he became interested in the God's Gift mine at\r\nAbertham, which was discovered in 1530. Writing in 1545, he says[6]:\r\n\"We, as a shareholder, through the goodness of God, have enjoyed the\r\nproceeds of this God's Gift since the very time when the mine began\r\nfirst to bestow such riches.\"\r\n\r\nAgricola seems to have resigned his position at Joachimsthal in about\r\n1530, and to have devoted the next two or three years to travel and\r\nstudy among the mines. About 1533 he became city physician of Chemnitz,\r\nin Saxony, and here he resided until his death in 1555. There is but\r\nlittle record of his activities during the first eight or nine years of\r\nhis residence in this city. He must have been engaged upon the study of\r\nhis subjects and the preparation of his books, for they came on with\r\ngreat rapidity soon after. He was frequently consulted on matters of\r\nmining engineering, as, for instance, we learn, from a letter written by\r\na certain Johannes Hordeborch[7], that Duke Henry of Brunswick applied\r\nto him with regard to the method for working mines in the Upper Harz.\r\n\r\nIn 1543 he married Anna, widow of Matthias Meyner, a petty tithe\r\nofficial; there is some reason to believe from a letter published by\r\nSchmid,[8] that Anna was his second wife, and that he was married the\r\nfirst time at Joachimsthal. He seems to have had several children, for\r\nhe commends his young children to the care of the Town Council during\r\nhis absence at the war in 1547. In addition to these, we know that a\r\nson, Theodor, was born in 1550; a daughter, Anna, in 1552; another\r\ndaughter, Irene, was buried at Chemnitz in 1555; and in 1580 his widow\r\nand three children--Anna, Valerius, and Lucretia--were still living.\r\n\r\nIn 1544 began the publication of the series of books to which Agricola\r\nowes his position. The first volume comprised five works and was finally\r\nissued in 1546; it was subsequently considerably revised, and re-issued\r\nin 1558. These works were: _De Ortu et Causis Subterraneorum_, in five\r\n\"books,\" the first work on physical geology; _De Natura Eorum quae\r\nEffluunt ex Terra_, in four \"books,\" on subterranean waters and gases;\r\n_De Natura Fossilium_, in ten \"books,\" the first systematic mineralogy;\r\n_De Veteribus et Novis Metallis_, in two \"books,\" devoted largely to the\r\nhistory of metals and topographical mineralogy; a new edition of\r\n_Bermannus_ was included; and finally _Rerum Metallicarum\r\nInterpretatio_, a glossary of Latin and German mineralogical and\r\nmetallurgical terms. Another work, _De Animantibus Subterraneis_,\r\nusually published with _De Re Metallica_, is dated 1548 in the preface.\r\nIt is devoted to animals which live underground, at least part of the\r\ntime, but is not a very effective basis of either geologic or zoologic\r\nclassification. Despite many public activities, Agricola apparently\r\ncompleted _De Re Metallica_ in 1550, but did not send it to the press\r\nuntil 1553; nor did it appear until a year after his death in 1555. But\r\nwe give further details on the preparation of this work on p. xv. During\r\nthis period he found time to prepare a small medical work, _De Peste_,\r\nand certain historical studies, details of which appear in the Appendix.\r\nThere are other works by Agricola referred to by sixteenth century\r\nwriters, but so far we have not been able to find them although they may\r\nexist. Such data as we have, is given in the appendix.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, Agricola seems to have had some tendencies toward\r\nliberalism in religious matters, for while at Zwickau he composed some\r\nanti-Popish Epigrams; but after his return to Leipsic he apparently\r\nnever wavered, and steadily refused to accept the Lutheran Reformation.\r\nTo many even liberal scholars of the day, Luther's doctrines appeared\r\nwild and demagogic. Luther was not a scholarly man; his addresses were\r\nto the masses; his Latin was execrable. Nor did the bitter dissensions\r\nover hair-splitting theology in the Lutheran Church after Luther's death\r\ntend to increase respect for the movement among the learned. Agricola\r\nwas a scholar of wide attainments, a deep-thinking, religious man, and\r\nhe remained to the end a staunch Catholic, despite the general change of\r\nsentiment among his countrymen. His leanings were toward such men as his\r\nfriend the humanist, Erasmus. That he had the courage of his convictions\r\nis shown in the dedication of _De Natura Eorum_, where he addresses to\r\nhis friend, Duke Maurice, the pious advice that the dissensions of the\r\nGermans should be composed, and that the Duke should return to the bosom\r\nof the Church those who had been torn from her, and adds: \"Yet I do not\r\nwish to become confused by these turbulent waters, and be led to offend\r\nanyone. It is more advisable to check my utterances.\" As he became older\r\nhe may have become less tolerant in religious matters, for he did not\r\nseem to show as much patience in the discussion of ecclesiastical topics\r\nas he must have possessed earlier, yet he maintained to the end the\r\nrespect and friendship of such great Protestants as Melanchthon,\r\nCamerarius, Fabricius, and many others.\r\n\r\nIn 1546, when he was at the age of 52, began Agricola's activity in\r\npublic life, for in that year he was elected a Burgher of Chemnitz; and\r\nin the same year Duke Maurice appointed him Burgomaster--an office which\r\nhe held for four terms. Before one can gain an insight into his\r\npolitical services, and incidentally into the character of the man, it\r\nis necessary to understand the politics of the time and his part\r\ntherein, and to bear in mind always that he was a staunch Catholic under\r\na Protestant Sovereign in a State seething with militant Protestantism.\r\n\r\nSaxony had been divided in 1485 between the Princes Ernest and Albert,\r\nthe former taking the Electoral dignity and the major portion of the\r\nPrincipality. Albert the Brave, the younger brother and Duke of Saxony,\r\nobtained the subordinate portion, embracing Meissen, but subject to the\r\nElector. The Elector Ernest was succeeded in 1486 by Frederick the Wise,\r\nand under his support Luther made Saxony the cradle of the Reformation.\r\nThis Elector was succeeded in 1525 by his brother John, who was in turn\r\nsucceeded by his son John Frederick in 1532. Of more immediate interest\r\nto this subject is the Albertian line of Saxon Dukes who ruled Meissen,\r\nfor in that Principality Agricola was born and lived, and his political\r\nfortunes were associated with this branch of the Saxon House. Albert was\r\nsucceeded in 1505 by his son George, \"The Bearded,\" and he in turn by\r\nhis brother Henry, the last of the Catholics, in 1539, who ruled until\r\n1541. Henry was succeeded in 1541 by his Protestant son Maurice, who was\r\nthe Patron of Agricola.\r\n\r\nAt about this time Saxony was drawn into the storms which rose from the\r\nlong-standing rivalry between Francis I., King of France, and Charles V.\r\nof Spain. These two potentates came to the throne in the same year\r\n(1515), and both were candidates for Emperor of that loose Confederation\r\nknown as the Holy Roman Empire. Charles was elected, and intermittent\r\nwars between these two Princes arose--first in one part of Europe, and\r\nthen in another. Francis finally formed an alliance with the\r\nSchmalkalden League of German Protestant Princes, and with the Sultan of\r\nTurkey, against Charles. In 1546 Maurice of Meissen, although a\r\nProtestant, saw his best interest in a secret league with Charles\r\nagainst the other Protestant Princes, and proceeded (the Schmalkalden\r\nWar) to invade the domains of his superior and cousin, the Elector\r\nFrederick. The Emperor Charles proved successful in this war, and\r\nMaurice was rewarded, at the Capitulation of Wittenberg in 1547, by\r\nbeing made Elector of Saxony in the place of his cousin. Later on, the\r\nElector Maurice found the association with Catholic Charles unpalatable,\r\nand joined in leading the other Protestant princes in war upon him, and\r\non the defeat of the Catholic party and the peace of Passau, Maurice\r\nbecame acknowledged as the champion of German national and religious\r\nfreedom. He was succeeded by his brother Augustus in 1553.\r\n\r\nAgricola was much favoured by the Saxon Electors, Maurice and Augustus.\r\nHe dedicates most of his works to them, and shows much gratitude for\r\nmany favours conferred upon him. Duke Maurice presented to him a house\r\nand plot in Chemnitz, and in a letter dated June 14th, 1543[9] in\r\nconnection therewith, says: \"... that he may enjoy his life-long a\r\nfreehold house unburdened by all burgher rights and other municipal\r\nservice, to be used by him and inhabited as a free dwelling, and that he\r\nmay also, for the necessities of his household and of his wife and\r\nservants, brew his own beer free, and that he may likewise purvey for\r\nhimself and his household foreign beer and also wine for use, and yet he\r\nshall not sell any such beer.... We have taken the said Doctor under our\r\nespecial protection and care for our life-long, and he shall not be\r\nsummoned before any Court of Justice, but only before us and our\r\nCouncillor....\"\r\n\r\nAgricola was made Burgomaster of Chemnitz in 1546. A letter[10] from\r\nFabricius to Meurer, dated May 19th, 1546, says that Agricola had been\r\nmade Burgomaster by the command of the Prince. This would be Maurice,\r\nand it is all the more a tribute to the high respect with which Agricola\r\nwas held, for, as said before, he was a consistent Catholic, and Maurice\r\na Protestant Prince. In this same year the Schmalkalden War broke out,\r\nand Agricola was called to personal attendance upon the Duke Maurice in\r\na diplomatic and advisory capacity. In 1546 also he was a member of the\r\nDiet of Freiberg, and was summoned to Council in Dresden. The next year\r\nhe continued, by the Duke's command, Burgomaster at Chemnitz, although\r\nhe seems to have been away upon Ducal matters most of the time. The Duke\r\naddresses[11] the Chemnitz Council in March, 1547: \"We hereby make known\r\nto you that we are in urgent need of your Burgomaster, Dr. Georgius\r\nAgricola, with us. It is, therefore, our will that you should yield him\r\nup and forward him that he should with the utmost haste set forth to us\r\nhere near Freiberg.\" He was sent on various missions from the Duke to\r\nthe Emperor Charles, to King Ferdinand of Austria, and to other Princes\r\nin matters connected with the war--the fact that he was a Catholic\r\nprobably entering into his appointment to such missions. Chemnitz was\r\noccupied by the troops of first one side, then the other, despite the\r\ngreat efforts of Agricola to have his own town specially defended. In\r\nApril, 1547, the war came to an end in the Battle of Muehlberg, but\r\nAgricola was apparently not relieved of his Burgomastership until the\r\nsucceeding year, for he wrote his friend Wolfgang Meurer, in April,\r\n1548,[12] that he \"was now relieved.\" His public duties did not end,\r\nhowever, for he attended the Diet of Leipzig in 1547 and in 1549, and\r\nwas at the Diet at Torgau in 1550. In 1551 he was again installed as\r\nBurgomaster; and in 1553, for the fourth time, he became head of the\r\nMunicipality, and during this year had again to attend the Diets at\r\nLeipzig and Dresden, representing his city. He apparently now had a\r\nshort relief from public duties, for it is not until 1555, shortly\r\nbefore his death, that we find him again attending a Diet at Torgau.\r\n\r\nAgricola died on November 21st, 1555. A letter[13] from his life-long\r\nfriend, Fabricius, to Melanchthon, announcing this event, states: \"We\r\nlost, on November 21st, that distinguished ornament of our Fatherland,\r\nGeorgius Agricola, a man of eminent intellect, of culture and of\r\njudgment. He attained the age of 62. He who since the days of childhood\r\nhad enjoyed robust health was carried off by a four-days' fever. He had\r\npreviously suffered from no disease except inflammation of the eyes,\r\nwhich he brought upon himself by untiring study and insatiable\r\nreading.... I know that you loved the soul of this man, although in many\r\nof his opinions, more especially in religious and spiritual welfare, he\r\ndiffered in many points from our own. For he despised our Churches, and\r\nwould not be with us in the Communion of the Blood of Christ. Therefore,\r\nafter his death, at the command of the Prince, which was given to the\r\nChurch inspectors and carried out by Tettelbach as a loyal servant,\r\nburial was refused him, and not until the fourth day was he borne away\r\nto Zeitz and interred in the Cathedral.... I have always admired the\r\ngenius of this man, so distinguished in our sciences and in the whole\r\nrealm of Philosophy--yet I wonder at his religious views, which were\r\ncompatible with reason, it is true, and were dazzling, but were by no\r\nmeans compatible with truth.... He would not tolerate with patience that\r\nanyone should discuss ecclesiastical matters with him.\" This action of\r\nthe authorities in denying burial to one of their most honoured\r\ncitizens, who had been ever assiduous in furthering the welfare of the\r\ncommunity, seems strangely out of joint. Further, the Elector Augustus,\r\nalthough a Protestant Prince, was Agricola's warm friend, as evidenced\r\nby his letter of but a few months before (see p. xv). However, Catholics\r\nwere then few in number at Chemnitz, and the feeling ran high at the\r\ntime, so possibly the Prince was afraid of public disturbances.\r\nHofmann[14] explains this occurrence in the following words:--\"The\r\nfeelings of Chemnitz citizens, who were almost exclusively Protestant,\r\nmust certainly be taken into account. They may have raised objections to\r\nthe solemn interment of a Catholic in the Protestant Cathedral Church of\r\nSt. Jacob, which had, perhaps, been demanded by his relatives, and to\r\nwhich, according to the custom of the time, he would have been entitled\r\nas Burgomaster. The refusal to sanction the interment aroused, more\r\nespecially in the Catholic world, a painful sensation.\"\r\n\r\nA brass memorial plate hung in the Cathedral at Zeitz had already\r\ndisappeared in 1686, nor have the cities of his birth or residence ever\r\nshown any appreciation of this man, whose work more deserves their\r\ngratitude than does that of the multitude of soldiers whose monuments\r\ndecorate every village and city square. It is true that in 1822 a marble\r\ntablet was placed behind the altar in the Church of St. Jacob in\r\nChemnitz, but even this was removed to the Historical Museum later on.\r\n\r\nHe left a modest estate, which was the subject of considerable\r\nlitigation by his descendants, due to the mismanagement of the guardian.\r\nHofmann has succeeded in tracing the descendants for two generations,\r\ndown to 1609, but the line is finally lost among the multitude of other\r\nAgricolas.\r\n\r\nTo deduce Georgius Agricola's character we need not search beyond the\r\ndiscovery of his steadfast adherence to the religion of his fathers amid\r\nthe bitter storm of Protestantism around him, and need but to remember\r\nat the same time that for twenty-five years he was entrusted with\r\nelective positions of an increasingly important character in this same\r\ncommunity. No man could have thus held the respect of his countrymen\r\nunless he were devoid of bigotry and possessed of the highest sense of\r\nintegrity, justice, humanity, and patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICOLA'S INTELLECTUAL ATTAINMENTS AND POSITION IN SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nAgricola's education was the most thorough that his times afforded in\r\nthe classics, philosophy, medicine, and sciences generally. Further, his\r\nwritings disclose a most exhaustive knowledge not only of an\r\nextraordinary range of classical literature, but also of obscure\r\nmanuscripts buried in the public libraries of Europe. That his general\r\nlearning was held to be of a high order is amply evidenced from the\r\ncorrespondence of the other scholars of his time--Erasmus, Melanchthon,\r\nMeurer, Fabricius, and others.\r\n\r\nOur more immediate concern, however, is with the advances which were due\r\nto him in the sciences of Geology, Mineralogy, and Mining Engineering.\r\nNo appreciation of these attainments can be conveyed to the reader\r\nunless he has some understanding of the dearth of knowledge in these\r\nsciences prior to Agricola's time. We have in Appendix B given a brief\r\nreview of the literature extant at this period on these subjects.\r\nFurthermore, no appreciation of Agricola's contribution to science can\r\nbe gained without a study of _De Ortu et Causis_ and _De Natura\r\nFossilium_, for while _De Re Metallica_ is of much more general\r\ninterest, it contains but incidental reference to Geology and\r\nMineralogy. Apart from the book of Genesis, the only attempts at\r\nfundamental explanation of natural phenomena were those of the Greek\r\nPhilosophers and the Alchemists. Orthodox beliefs Agricola scarcely\r\nmentions; with the Alchemists he had no patience. There can be no doubt,\r\nhowever, that his views are greatly coloured by his deep classical\r\nlearning. He was in fine to a certain distance a follower of Aristotle,\r\nTheophrastus, Strato, and other leaders of the Peripatetic school. For\r\nthat matter, except for the muddy current which the alchemists had\r\nintroduced into this already troubled stream, the whole thought of the\r\nlearned world still flowed from the Greeks. Had he not, however,\r\nradically departed from the teachings of the Peripatetic school, his\r\nwork would have been no contribution to the development of science.\r\nCertain of their teachings he repudiated with great vigour, and his\r\nlaboured and detailed arguments in their refutation form the first\r\nbattle in science over the results of observation _versus_ inductive\r\nspeculation. To use his own words: \"Those things which we see with our\r\neyes and understand by means of our senses are more clearly to be\r\ndemonstrated than if learned by means of reasoning.\"[15] The bigoted\r\nscholasticism of his times necessitated as much care and detail in\r\nrefutation of such deep-rooted beliefs, as would be demanded to-day by\r\nan attempt at a refutation of the theory of evolution, and in\r\nconsequence his works are often but dry reading to any but those\r\ninterested in the development of fundamental scientific theory.\r\n\r\nIn giving an appreciation of Agricola's views here and throughout the\r\nfootnotes, we do not wish to convey to the reader that he was in all\r\nthings free from error and from the spirit of his times, or that his\r\ntheories, constructed long before the atomic theory, are of the\r\nclear-cut order which that basic hypothesis has rendered possible to\r\nlater scientific speculation in these branches. His statements are\r\nsometimes much confused, but we reiterate that their clarity is as\r\ncrystal to mud in comparison with those of his predecessors--and of most\r\nof his successors for over two hundred years. As an indication of his\r\ngrasp of some of the wider aspects of geological phenomena we reproduce,\r\nin Appendix A, a passage from _De Ortu et Causis_, which we believe to\r\nbe the first adequate declaration of the part played by erosion in\r\nmountain sculpture. But of all of Agricola's theoretical views those are\r\nof the greatest interest which relate to the origin of ore deposits, for\r\nin these matters he had the greatest opportunities of observation and\r\nthe most experience. We have on page 108 reproduced and discussed his\r\ntheory at considerable length, but we may repeat here, that in his\r\npropositions as to the circulation of ground waters, that ore channels\r\nare a subsequent creation to the contained rocks, and that they were\r\nfilled by deposition from circulating solutions, he enunciated the\r\nfoundations of our modern theory, and in so doing took a step in advance\r\ngreater than that of any single subsequent authority. In his contention\r\nthat ore channels were created by erosion of subterranean waters he was\r\nwrong, except for special cases, and it was not until two centuries\r\nlater that a further step in advance was taken by the recognition by Van\r\nOppel of the part played by fissuring in these phenomena. Nor was it\r\nuntil about the same time that the filling of ore channels in the main\r\nby deposition from solutions was generally accepted. While Werner, two\r\nhundred and fifty years after Agricola, is generally revered as the\r\ninspirer of the modern theory by those whose reading has taken them no\r\nfarther back, we have no hesitation in asserting that of the\r\npropositions of each author, Agricola's were very much more nearly in\r\naccord with modern views. Moreover, the main result of the new ideas\r\nbrought forward by Werner was to stop the march of progress for half a\r\ncentury, instead of speeding it forward as did those of Agricola.\r\n\r\nIn mineralogy Agricola made the first attempt at systematic treatment of\r\nthe subject. His system could not be otherwise than wrongly based, as he\r\ncould scarcely see forward two or three centuries to the atomic theory\r\nand our vast fund of chemical knowledge. However, based as it is upon\r\nsuch properties as solubility and homogeneity, and upon external\r\ncharacteristics such as colour, hardness, &c., it makes a most\r\ncreditable advance upon Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Albertus\r\nMagnus--his only predecessors. He is the first to assert that bismuth\r\nand antimony are true primary metals; and to some sixty actual mineral\r\nspecies described previous to his time he added some twenty more, and\r\nlaments that there are scores unnamed.\r\n\r\nAs to Agricola's contribution to the sciences of mining and metallurgy,\r\n_De Re Metallica_ speaks for itself. While he describes, for the first\r\ntime, scores of methods and processes, no one would contend that they\r\nwere discoveries or inventions of his own. They represent the\r\naccumulation of generations of experience and knowledge; but by him they\r\nwere, for the first time, to receive detailed and intelligent\r\nexposition. Until Schlueter's work nearly two centuries later, it was not\r\nexcelled. There is no measure by which we may gauge the value of such a\r\nwork to the men who followed in this profession during centuries, nor\r\nthe benefits enjoyed by humanity through them.\r\n\r\nThat Agricola occupied a very considerable place in the great awakening\r\nof learning will be disputed by none except by those who place the\r\ndevelopment of science in rank far below religion, politics, literature,\r\nand art. Of wider importance than the details of his achievements in the\r\nmere confines of the particular science to which he applied himself, is\r\nthe fact that he was the first to found any of the natural sciences upon\r\nresearch and observation, as opposed to previous fruitless speculation.\r\nThe wider interest of the members of the medical profession in the\r\ndevelopment of their science than that of geologists in theirs, has led\r\nto the aggrandizement of Paracelsus, a contemporary of Agricola, as the\r\nfirst in deductive science. Yet no comparative study of the unparalleled\r\negotistical ravings of this half-genius, half-alchemist, with the modest\r\nsober logic and real research and observation of Agricola, can leave a\r\nmoment's doubt as to the incomparably greater position which should be\r\nattributed to the latter as the pioneer in building the foundation of\r\nscience by deduction from observed phenomena. Science is the base upon\r\nwhich is reared the civilization of to-day, and while we give daily\r\ncredit to all those who toil in the superstructure, let none forget\r\nthose men who laid its first foundation stones. One of the greatest of\r\nthese was Georgius Agricola.\r\n\r\n\r\nDE RE METALLICA\r\n\r\nAgricola seems to have been engaged in the preparation of _De Re\r\nMetallica_ for a period of over twenty years, for we first hear of the\r\nbook in a letter from Petrus Plateanus, a schoolmaster at Joachimsthal,\r\nto the great humanist, Erasmus,[16] in September, 1529. He says: \"The\r\nscientific world will be still more indebted to Agricola when he brings\r\nto light the books _De Re Metallica_ and other matters which he has on\r\nhand.\" In the dedication of _De Mensuris et Ponderibus_ (in 1533)\r\nAgricola states that he means to publish twelve books _De Re Metallica_,\r\nif he lives. That the appearance of this work was eagerly anticipated is\r\nevidenced by a letter from George Fabricius to Valentine Hertel:[17]\r\n\"With great excitement the books _De Re Metallica_ are being awaited. If\r\nhe treats the material at hand with his usual zeal, he will win for\r\nhimself glory such as no one in any of the fields of literature has\r\nattained for the last thousand years.\" According to the dedication of\r\n_De Veteribus et Novis Metallis_, Agricola in 1546 already looked\r\nforward to its early publication. The work was apparently finished in\r\n1550, for the dedication to the Dukes Maurice and August of Saxony is\r\ndated in December of that year. The eulogistic poem by his friend,\r\nGeorge Fabricius, is dated in 1551.\r\n\r\nThe publication was apparently long delayed by the preparation of the\r\nwoodcuts; and, according to Mathesius,[18] many sketches for them were\r\nprepared by Basilius Wefring. In the preface of _De Re Metallica_,\r\nAgricola does not mention who prepared the sketches, but does say: \"I\r\nhave hired illustrators to delineate their forms, lest descriptions\r\nwhich are conveyed by words should either not be understood by men of\r\nour own times, or should cause difficulty to posterity.\" In 1553 the\r\ncompleted book was sent to Froben for publication, for a letter[19] from\r\nFabricius to Meurer in March, 1553, announces its dispatch to the\r\nprinter. An interesting letter[20] from the Elector Augustus to\r\nAgricola, dated January 18, 1555, reads: \"Most learned, dear and\r\nfaithful subject, whereas you have sent to the Press a Latin book of\r\nwhich the title is said to be _De Rebus Metallicis_, which has been\r\npraised to us and we should like to know the contents, it is our\r\ngracious command that you should get the book translated when you have\r\nthe opportunity into German, and not let it be copied more than once or\r\nbe printed, but keep it by you and send us a copy. If you should need a\r\nwriter for this purpose, we will provide one. Thus you will fulfil our\r\ngracious behest.\" The German translation was prepared by Philip Bechius,\r\na Basel University Professor of Medicine and Philosophy. It is a\r\nwretched work, by one who knew nothing of the science, and who more\r\nespecially had no appreciation of the peculiar Latin terms coined by\r\nAgricola, most of which he rendered literally. It is a sad commentary\r\non his countrymen that no correct German translation exists. The Italian\r\ntranslation is by Michelangelo Florio, and is by him dedicated to\r\nElizabeth, Queen of England. The title page of the first edition is\r\nreproduced later on, and the full titles of other editions are given in\r\nthe Appendix, together with the author's other works. The following are\r\nthe short titles of the various editions of _De Re Metallica_, together\r\nwith the name and place of the publisher:--\r\n\r\nLatin Editions.\r\n\r\n  _De Re Metallica_, Froben        Basel Folio 1556.\r\n   \"  \"      \"         \"             \"     \"   1561.\r\n   \"  \"      \"       Ludwig Koenig    \"     \"   1621.\r\n   \"  \"      \"       Emanuel Koenig   \"     \"   1657.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, Leupold,[21] Schmid,[22] and others mention an\r\noctavo edition, without illustrations, Schweinfurt, 1607. We have not\r\nbeen able to find a copy of this edition, and are not certain of its\r\nexistence. The same catalogues also mention an octavo edition of _De Re\r\nMetallica_, Wittenberg, 1612 or 1614, with notes by Joanne Sigfrido; but\r\nwe believe this to be a confusion with Agricola's subsidiary works,\r\nwhich were published at this time and place, with such notes.\r\n\r\nGerman Editions.\r\n\r\n  _Vom Bergkwerck_, Froben, Folio, 1557.\r\n  _Bergwerck Buch_, Sigmundi Feyrabendt, Frankfort-on-Main, folio, 1580.\r\n       \"      \"     Ludwig Koenig, Basel, folio, 1621.\r\n\r\nThere are other editions than these, mentioned by bibliographers, but we\r\nhave been unable to confirm them in any library. The most reliable of\r\nsuch bibliographies, that of John Ferguson,[23] gives in addition to the\r\nabove; _Bergwerkbuch_, Basel, 1657, folio, and Schweinfurt, 1687,\r\noctavo.\r\n\r\nItalian Edition.\r\n\r\n_L'Arte de Metalli_, Froben, Basel, folio, 1563.\r\n\r\nOther Languages.\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, _De Re Metallica_ was never actually published in\r\nother than Latin, German, and Italian. However, a portion of the\r\naccounts of the firm of Froben were published in 1881[24], and therein\r\nis an entry under March, 1560, of a sum to one Leodigaris Grymaldo for\r\nsome other work, and also for \"correction of Agricola's _De Re\r\nMetallica_ in French.\" This may of course, be an error for the Italian\r\nedition, which appeared a little later. There is also mention[25] that a\r\nmanuscript of _De Re Metallica_ in Spanish was seen in the library of\r\nthe town of Bejar. An interesting note appears in the glossary given by\r\nSir John Pettus in his translation of Lazarus Erckern's work on\r\nassaying. He says[26] \"but I cannot enlarge my observations upon any\r\nmore words, because the printer calls for what I did write of a\r\nmetallick dictionary, after I first proposed the printing of Erckern,\r\nbut intending within the compass of a year to publish Georgius Agricola,\r\n_De Re Metallica_ (being fully translated) in English, and also to add a\r\ndictionary to it, I shall reserve my remaining essays (if what I have\r\ndone hitherto be approved) till then, and so I proceed in the\r\ndictionary.\" The translation was never published and extensive inquiry\r\nin various libraries and among the family of Pettus has failed to yield\r\nany trace of the manuscript.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] For the biographical information here set out we have relied\r\nprincipally upon the following works:--Petrus Albinus, _Meissnische Land\r\nUnd Berg Chronica_, Dresden, 1590; Adam Daniel Richter, _Umstaendliche\r\n...

It has but little intrinsic value for it is not\r\npoetry of a very high order, and to make it acceptable English would\r\nrequire certain improvements, for which only poets have licence. A\r\n\"free\" translation of the last few lines indicates its complimentary\r\ncharacter:--\r\n\r\n    \"He doth raise his country's fame with his own\r\n      And in the mouths of nations yet unborn\r\n      His praises shall be sung; Death comes to all\r\n      But great achievements raise a monument\r\n      Which shall endure until the sun grows cold.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS\r\n   AND MOST MIGHTY DUKES OF\r\n    Saxony, Landgraves of Thuringia, Margraves of Meissen,\r\n     Imperial Overlords of Saxony, Burgraves of Altenberg\r\n      and Magdeburg, Counts of Brena, Lords of\r\n       Pleissnerland, To MAURICE Grand Marshall\r\n        and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire\r\n         and to his brother AUGUSTUS,[1]\r\n          GEORGE AGRICOLA  S. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost illustrious Princes, often have I considered the metallic arts as a\r\nwhole, as Moderatus Columella[2] considered the agricultural arts, just\r\nas if I had been considering the whole of the human body; and when I had\r\nperceived the various parts of the subject, like so many members of the\r\nbody, I became afraid that I might die before I should understand its\r\nfull extent, much less before I could immortalise it in writing. This\r\nbook itself indicates the length and breadth of the subject, and the\r\nnumber and importance of the sciences of which at least some little\r\nknowledge is necessary to miners. Indeed, the subject of mining is a\r\nvery extensive one, and one very difficult to explain; no part of it is\r\nfully dealt with by the Greek and Latin authors whose works survive; and\r\nsince the art is one of the most ancient, the most necessary and the\r\nmost profitable to mankind, I considered that I ought not to neglect it.\r\nWithout doubt, none of the arts is older than agriculture, but that of\r\nthe metals is not less ancient; in fact they are at least equal and\r\ncoeval, for no mortal man ever tilled a field without implements. In\r\ntruth, in all the works of agriculture, as in the other arts, implements\r\nare used which are made from metals, or which could not be made without\r\nthe use of metals; for this reason the metals are of the greatest\r\nnecessity to man. When an art is so poor that it lacks metals, it is not\r\nof much importance, for nothing is made without tools. Besides, of all\r\nways whereby great wealth is acquired by good and honest means, none is\r\nmore advantageous than mining; for although from fields which are well\r\ntilled (not to mention other things) we derive rich yields, yet we\r\nobtain richer products from mines; in fact, one mine is often much more\r\nbeneficial to us than many fields. For this reason we learn from the\r\nhistory of nearly all ages that very many men have been made rich by the\r\nmines, and the fortunes of many kings have been much amplified thereby.\r\nBut I will not now speak more of these matters, because I have dealt\r\nwith these subjects partly in the first book of this work, and partly in\r\nthe other work entitled _De Veteribus et Novis Metallis_, where I have\r\nrefuted the charges which have been made against metals and against\r\nminers. Now, though the art of husbandry, which I willingly rank with\r\nthe art of mining, appears to be divided into many branches, yet it is\r\nnot separated into so many as this art of ours, nor can I teach the\r\nprinciples of this as easily as Columella did of that. He had at hand\r\nmany writers upon husbandry whom he could follow,--in fact, there are\r\nmore than fifty Greek authors whom Marcus Varro enumerates, and more\r\nthan ten Latin ones, whom Columella himself mentions. I have only one\r\nwhom I can follow; that is C. Plinius Secundus,[3] and he expounds only\r\na very few methods of digging ores and of making metals. Far from the\r\nwhole of the art having been treated by any one writer, those who have\r\nwritten occasionally on any one or another of its branches have not even\r\ndealt completely with a single one of them. Moreover, there is a great\r\nscarcity even of these, since alone of all the Greeks, Strato of\r\nLampsacus,[4] the successor of Theophrastus,[5] wrote a book on the\r\nsubject, _De Machinis Metallicis_; except, perhaps a work by the poet\r\nPhilo, a small part of which embraced to some degree the occupation of\r\nmining.[6] Pherecrates seems to have introduced into his comedy, which\r\nwas similar in title, miners as slaves or as persons condemned to serve\r\nin the mines. Of the Latin writers, Pliny, as I have already said, has\r\ndescribed a few methods of working. Also among the authors I must\r\ninclude the modern writers, whosoever they are, for no one should escape\r\njust condemnation who fails to award due recognition to persons whose\r\nwritings he uses, even very slightly. Two books have been written in our\r\ntongue; the one on the assaying of mineral substances and metals,\r\nsomewhat confused, whose author is unknown[7]; the other \"On Veins,\" of\r\nwhich Pandulfus Anglus[8] is also said to have written, although the\r\nGerman book was written by Calbus of Freiberg, a well-known doctor; but\r\nneither of them accomplished the task he had begun.[9] Recently\r\nVannucci Biringuccio, of Sienna, a wise man experienced in many matters,\r\nwrote in vernacular Italian on the subject of the melting, separating,\r\nand alloying of metals.[10] He touched briefly on the methods of\r\nsmelting certain ores, and explained more fully the methods of making\r\ncertain juices; by reading his directions, I have refreshed my memory of\r\nthose things which I myself saw in Italy; as for many matters on which I\r\nwrite, he did not touch upon them at all, or touched but lightly. This\r\nbook was given me by Franciscus Badoarius, a Patrician of Venice, and a\r\nman of wisdom and of repute; this he had promised that he would do, when\r\nin the previous year he was at Marienberg, having been sent by the\r\nVenetians as an Ambassador to King Ferdinand. Beyond these books I do\r\nnot find any writings on the metallic arts. For that reason, even if the\r\nbook of Strato existed, from all these sources not one-half of the whole\r\nbody of the science of mining could be pieced together.\r\n\r\nSeeing that there have been so few who have written on the subject of\r\nthe metals, it appears to me all the more wonderful that so many\r\nalchemists have arisen who would compound metals artificially, and who\r\nwould change one into another. Hermolaus Barbarus,[11] a man of high\r\nrank and station, and distinguished in all kinds of learning, has\r\nmentioned the names of many in his writings; and I will proffer more,\r\nbut only famous ones, for I will limit myself to a few. Thus Osthanes\r\nhas written on [Greek: chymeutika]; and there are Hermes; Chanes;\r\nZosimus, the Alexandrian, to his sister Theosebia; Olympiodorus, also an\r\nAlexandrian; Agathodaemon; Democritus, not the one of Abdera, but some\r\nother whom I know not; Orus Chrysorichites, Pebichius, Comerius,\r\nJoannes, Apulejus, Petasius, Pelagius, Africanus, Theophilus, Synesius,\r\nStephanus to Heracleus Caesar, Heliodorus to Theodosius, Geber, Callides\r\nRachaidibus, Veradianus, Rodianus, Canides, Merlin, Raymond Lully,\r\nArnold de Villa Nova, and Augustinus Pantheus of Venice; and three\r\nwomen, Cleopatra, the maiden Taphnutia, and Maria the Jewess.[12] All\r\nthese alchemists employ obscure language, and Johanes Aurelius\r\nAugurellus of Rimini, alone has used the language of poetry. There are\r\nmany other books on this subject, but all are difficult to follow,\r\nbecause the writers upon these things use strange names, which do not\r\nproperly belong to the metals, and because some of them employ now one\r\nname and now another, invented by themselves, though the thing itself\r\nchanges not. These masters teach their disciples that the base metals,\r\nwhen smelted, are broken up; also they teach the methods by which they\r\nreduce them to the primary parts and remove whatever is superfluous in\r\nthem, and by supplying what is wanted make out of them the precious\r\nmetals--that is, gold and silver,--all of which they carry out in a\r\ncrucible. Whether they can do these things or not I cannot decide; but,\r\nseeing that so many writers assure us with all earnestness that they\r\nhave reached that goal for which they aimed, it would seem that faith\r\nmight be placed in them; yet also seeing that we do not read of any of\r\nthem ever having become rich by this art, nor do we now see them growing\r\nrich, although so many nations everywhere have produced, and are\r\nproducing, alchemists, and all of them are straining every nerve night\r\nand day to the end that they may heap a great quantity of gold and\r\nsilver, I should say the matter is dubious. But although it may be due\r\nto the carelessness of the writers that they have not transmitted to us\r\nthe names of the masters who acquired great wealth through this\r\noccupation, certainly it is clear that their disciples either do not\r\nunderstand their precepts or, if they do understand them, do not follow\r\nthem; for if they do comprehend them, seeing that these disciples have\r\nbeen and are so numerous, they would have by to-day filled whole towns\r\nwith gold and silver. Even their books proclaim their vanity, for they\r\ninscribe in them the names of Plato and Aristotle and other\r\nphilosophers, in order that such high-sounding inscriptions may impose\r\nupon simple people and pass for learning. There is another class of\r\nalchemists who do not change the substance of base metals, but colour\r\nthem to represent gold or silver, so that they appear to be that which\r\nthey are not, and when this appearance is taken from them by the fire,\r\nas if it were a garment foreign to them, they return to their own\r\ncharacter. These alchemists, since they deceive people, are not only\r\nheld in the greatest odium, but their frauds are a capital offence. No\r\nless a fraud, warranting capital punishment, is committed by a third\r\nsort of alchemists; these throw into a crucible a small piece of gold or\r\nsilver hidden in a coal, and after mixing therewith fluxes which have\r\nthe power of extracting it, pretend to be making gold from orpiment, or\r\nsilver from tin and like substances. But concerning the art of alchemy,\r\nif it be an art, I will speak further elsewhere. I will now return to\r\nthe art of mining.\r\n\r\nSince no authors have written of this art in its entirety, and since\r\nforeign nations and races do not understand our tongue, and, if they did\r\nunderstand it, would be able to learn only a small part of the art\r\nthrough the works of those authors whom we do possess, I have written\r\nthese twelve books _De Re Metallica_. Of these, the first book contains\r\nthe arguments which may be used against this art, and against metals and\r\nthe mines, and what can be said in their favour. The second book\r\ndescribes the miner, and branches into a discourse on the finding of\r\nveins. The third book deals with veins and stringers, and seams in the\r\nrocks. The fourth book explains the method of delimiting veins, and also\r\ndescribes the functions of the mining officials. The fifth book\r\ndescribes the digging of ore and the surveyor's art. The sixth book\r\ndescribes the miners' tools and machines. The seventh book is on the\r\nassaying of ore. The eighth book lays down the rules for the work of\r\nroasting, crushing, and washing the ore. The ninth book explains the\r\nmethods of smelting ores. The tenth book instructs those who are\r\nstudious of the metallic arts in the work of separating silver from\r\ngold, and lead from gold and silver. The eleventh book shows the way of\r\nseparating silver from copper. The twelfth book gives us rules for\r\nmanufacturing salt, soda, alum, vitriol, sulphur, bitumen, and glass.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not fulfilled the task which I have undertaken, on\r\naccount of the great magnitude of the subject, I have, at all events,\r\nendeavoured to fulfil it, for I have devoted much labour and care, and\r\nhave even gone to some expense upon it; for with regard to the veins,\r\ntools, vessels, sluices, machines, and furnaces, I have not only\r\ndescribed them, but have also hired illustrators to delineate their\r\nforms, lest descriptions which are conveyed by words should either not\r\nbe understood by men of our own times, or should cause difficulty to\r\nposterity, in the same way as to us difficulty is often caused by many\r\nnames which the Ancients (because such words were familiar to all of\r\nthem) have handed down to us without any explanation.\r\n\r\nI have omitted all those things which I have not myself seen, or have\r\nnot read or heard of from persons upon whom I can rely. That which I\r\nhave neither seen, nor carefully considered after reading or hearing of,\r\nI have not written about. The same rule must be understood with regard\r\nto all my instruction, whether I enjoin things which ought to be done,\r\nor describe things which are usual, or condemn things which are done.\r\nSince the art of mining does not lend itself to elegant language, these\r\nbooks of mine are correspondingly lacking in refinement of style. The\r\nthings dealt with in this art of metals sometimes lack names, either\r\nbecause they are new, or because, even if they are old, the record of\r\nthe names by which they were formerly known has been lost. For this\r\nreason I have been forced by a necessity, for which I must be pardoned,\r\nto describe some of them by a number of words combined, and to\r\ndistinguish others by new names,--to which latter class belong\r\n_Ingestor_, _Discretor_, _Lotor_, and _Excoctor_.[13] Other things,\r\nagain, I have alluded to by old names, such as the _Cisium_; for when\r\nNonius Marcellus wrote,[14] this was the name of a two-wheeled vehicle,\r\nbut I have adopted it for a small vehicle which has only one wheel; and\r\nif anyone does not approve of these names, let him either find more\r\nappropriate ones for these things, or discover the words used in the\r\nwritings of the Ancients.\r\n\r\nThese books, most illustrious Princes, are dedicated to you for many\r\nreasons, and, above all others, because metals have proved of the\r\ngreatest value to you; for though your ancestors drew rich profits from\r\nthe revenues of their vast and wealthy territories, and likewise from\r\nthe taxes which were paid by the foreigners by way of toll and by the\r\nnatives by way of tithes, yet they drew far richer profits from the\r\nmines. Because of the mines not a few towns have risen into eminence,\r\nsuch as Freiberg, Annaberg, Marienberg, Schneeberg, Geyer, and\r\nAltenberg, not to mention others. Nay, if I understand anything, greater\r\nwealth now lies hidden beneath the ground in the mountainous parts of\r\nyour territory than is visible and apparent above ground. Farewell.\r\n\r\n    _Chemnitz, Saxony,\r\n    December First, 1550._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] For Agricola's relations with these princes see p. ix.\r\n\r\n[2] Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella was a Roman, a native of Cadiz,\r\nand lived during the 1st Century. He was the author of _De Re Rustica_\r\nin 12 books. It was first printed in 1472, and some fifteen or sixteen\r\neditions had been printed before Agricola's death.\r\n\r\n[3] We give a short review of Pliny's _Naturalis Historia_ in the\r\nAppendix B.\r\n\r\n[4] This work is not extant, as Agricola duly notes later on. Strato\r\nsucceeded Theophrastus as president of the Lyceum, 288 B.C.\r\n\r\n[5] For note on Theophrastus see Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[6] It appears that the poet Philo did write a work on mining which is\r\nnot extant. So far as we know the only reference to this work is in\r\nAthenaeus' (200 A.D.) _Deipnosophistae_. The passage as it appears in C.\r\nD. Yonge's Translation (Bonn's Library, London, 1854, Vol. II, Book VII,\r\np. 506) is: \"And there is a similar fish produced in the Red Sea which\r\nis called Stromateus; it has gold-coloured lines running along the whole\r\nof his body, as Philo tells us in his book on Mines.\" There is a\r\nfragment of a poem of Pherecrates, entitled \"Miners,\" but it seems to\r\nhave little to do with mining.\r\n\r\n[7] The title given by Agricola _De Materiae Metallicae et Metallorum\r\nExperimento_ is difficult to identify. It seems likely to be the little\r\n_Probier Buechlein_, numbers of which were published in German in the\r\nfirst half of the 16th Century. We discuss this work at some length in\r\nthe Appendix B on Ancient Authors.\r\n\r\n[8] Pandulfus, \"the Englishman,\" is mentioned by various 15th and 16th\r\nCentury writers, and in the preface of Mathias Farinator's _Liber\r\nMoralitatum ... Rerum Naturalium_, etc., printed in Augsburg, 1477,\r\nthere is a list of books among which appears a reference to a work by\r\nPandulfus on veins and minerals. We have not been able to find the book.\r\n\r\n[9] Jacobi (_Der Mineralog Georgius Agricola_, Zwickau, 1881, p. 47)\r\nsays: \"Calbus Freibergius, so called by Agricola himself, is certainly\r\nno other than the Freiberg Doctor Ruehlein von Kalbe; he was, according\r\nto Moeller, a doctor and burgomaster at Freiberg at the end of the 15th\r\nand the beginning of the 16th Centuries.... The chronicler describes him\r\nas a fine mathematician, who helped to survey and design the mining\r\ntowns of Annaberg in 1497 and Marienberg in 1521.\" We would call\r\nattention to the statement of Calbus' views, quoted at the end of Book\r\nIII, _De Re Metallica_ (p. 75), which are astonishingly similar to\r\nstatements in the _Nuetzlich Bergbuechlin_, and leave little doubt that\r\nthis \"Calbus\" was the author of that anonymous book on veins. For\r\nfurther discussion see Appendix B.\r\n\r\n[10] For discussion of Biringuccio see Appendix B. The proper title is\r\n_De La Pirotechnia_ (Venice, 1540).\r\n\r\n[11] Hermolaus Barbarus, according to Watt (_Bibliotheca Britannica_,\r\nLondon, 1824), was a lecturer on Philosophy in Padua. He was born in\r\n1454, died in 1493, and was the author of a number of works on medicine,\r\nnatural history, etc., with commentaries on the older authors.\r\n\r\n[12] The debt which humanity does owe to these self-styled philosophers\r\nmust not be overlooked, for the science of Chemistry comes from three\r\nsources--Alchemy, Medicine and Metallurgy. However polluted the former\r\nof these may be, still the vast advance which it made by the discovery\r\nof the principal acids, alkalis, and the more common of their salts,\r\nshould be constantly recognized. It is obviously impossible, within the\r\nspace of a footnote, to give anything but the most casual notes as to\r\nthe personages here mentioned and their writings. Aside from the\r\nclassics and religious works, the libraries of the Middle Ages teemed\r\nwith more material on Alchemy than on any other one subject, and since\r\nthat date a never-ending stream of historical, critical, and discursive\r\nvolumes and tracts devoted to the old Alchemists and their writings has\r\nbeen poured upon the world. A collection recently sold in London,\r\nrelating to Paracelsus alone, embraced over seven hundred volumes.\r\n\r\nOf many of the Alchemists mentioned by Agricola little is really known,\r\nand no two critics agree as to the commonest details regarding many of\r\nthem; in fact, an endless confusion springs from the negligent habit of\r\nthe lesser Alchemists of attributing the authorship of their writings to\r\nmore esteemed members of their own ilk, such as Hermes, Osthanes, etc.,\r\nnot to mention the palpable spuriousness of works under the names of the\r\nreal philosophers, such as Aristotle, Plato, or Moses, and even of Jesus\r\nChrist. Knowledge of many of the authors mentioned by Agricola does not\r\nextend beyond the fact that the names mentioned are appended to various\r\nwritings, in some instances to MSS yet unpublished. They may have been\r\nactual persons, or they may not. Agricola undoubtedly had perused such\r\nmanuscripts and books in some leading library, as the quotation from\r\nBoerhaave given later shows. Shaw (A New Method of Chemistry, etc.,\r\nLondon, 1753. Vol. I, p. 25) considers that the large number of such\r\nmanuscripts in the European libraries at this time were composed or\r\ntranscribed by monks and others living in Constantinople, Alexandria,\r\nand Athens, who fled westward before the Turkish invasion, bringing\r\ntheir works with them.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of this summary we group the names mentioned by Agricola,\r\nthe first class being of those who are known only as names appended to\r\nMSS or not identifiable at all. Possibly a more devoted student of the\r\nhistory of Alchemy would assign fewer names to this department of\r\noblivion. They are Maria the Jewess, Orus Chrysorichites, Chanes,\r\nPetasius, Pebichius, Theophilus, Callides, Veradianus, Rodianus,\r\nCanides, the maiden Taphnutia, Johannes, Augustinus, and Africanus. The\r\nlast three are names so common as not to be possible of identification\r\nwithout more particulars, though Johannes may be the Johannes Rupeseissa\r\n(1375), an alchemist of some note. Many of these names can be found\r\namong the Bishops and Prelates of the early Christian Church, but we\r\ndoubt if their owners would ever be identified with such indiscretions\r\nas open, avowed alchemy. The Theophilus mentioned might be the\r\nmetal-working monk of the 12th Century, who is further discussed in\r\nAppendix B on Ancient Authors.\r\n\r\nIn the next group fall certain names such as Osthanes, Hermes, Zosimus,\r\nAgathodaemon, and Democritus, which have been the watchwords of\r\nauthority to Alchemists of all ages. These certainly possessed the great\r\nsecrets, either the philosopher's stone or the elixir. Hermes\r\nTrismegistos was a legendary Egyptian personage supposed to have\r\nflourished before 1,500 B.C., and by some considered to be a corruption\r\nof the god Thoth. He is supposed to have written a number of works, but\r\nthose extant have been demonstrated to date not prior to the second\r\nCentury; he is referred to by the later Greek Alchemists, and was\r\nbelieved to have possessed the secret of transmutation. Osthanes was\r\nalso a very shadowy personage, and was considered by some Alchemists to\r\nhave been an Egyptian prior to Hermes, by others to have been the\r\nteacher of Zoroaster. Pliny mentions a magician of this name who\r\naccompanied Xerxes' army. Later there are many others of this name, and\r\nthe most probable explanation is that this was a favourite pseudonym for\r\nancient magicians; there is a very old work, of no great interest, in\r\nMSS in Latin and Greek, in the Munich, Gotha, Vienna, and other\r\nlibraries, by one of this name. Agathodaemon was still another shadowy\r\ncharacter referred to by the older Alchemists. There are MSS in the\r\nFlorence, Paris, Escurial, and Munich libraries bearing his name, but\r\nnothing tangible is known as to whether he was an actual man or if these\r\nwritings are not of a much later period than claimed.\r\n\r\nTo the next group belong the Greek Alchemists, who flourished during the\r\nrise and decline of Alexandria, from 200 B.C. to 700 A.D., and we give\r\nthem in order of their dates. Comerius was considered by his later\r\nfellow professionals to have been the teacher of the art to Cleopatra\r\n(1st Century B.C.), and a MSS with a title to that effect exists in the\r\nBibliotheque Nationale at Paris. The celebrated Cleopatra seems to have\r\nstood very high in the estimation of the Alchemists; perhaps her\r\ndoubtful character found a response among them; there are various works\r\nextant in MSS attributed to her, but nothing can be known as to their\r\nauthenticity. Lucius Apulejus or Apuleius was born in Numidia about the\r\n2nd Century; he was a Roman Platonic Philosopher, and was the author of\r\na romance, \"The Metamorphosis, or the Golden Ass.\" Synesius was a Greek,\r\nbut of unknown period; there is a MSS treatise on the Philosopher's\r\nStone in the library at Leyden under his name, and various printed works\r\nare attributed to him; he mentions \"water of saltpetre,\" and has,\r\ntherefore, been hazarded to be the earliest recorder of nitric acid. The\r\nwork here referred to as \"Heliodorus to Theodosius\" was probably the MSS\r\nin the Libraries at Paris, Vienna, Munich, etc., under the title of\r\n\"Heliodorus the Philosopher's Poem to the Emperor Theodosius the Great\r\non the Mystic Art of the Philosophers, etc.\" His period would,\r\ntherefore, be about the 4th Century. The Alexandrian Zosimus is more\r\ngenerally known as Zosimus the Panopolite, from Panopolis, an ancient\r\ntown on the Nile; he flourished in the 5th Century, and belonged to the\r\nAlexandrian School of Alchemists; he should not be confused with the\r\nRoman historian of the same name and period. The following statement is\r\nby Boerhaave (_Elementa Chemiae_, Paris, 1724, Chap. I.):--\"The name\r\nChemistry written in Greek, or _Chemia_, is so ancient as perhaps to\r\nhave been used in the antediluvian age. Of this opinion was Zosimus the\r\nPanopolite, whose Greek writings, though known as long as before the\r\nyear 1550 to George Agricola, and afterwards perused ... by Jas.\r\nScaliger and Olaus Borrichius, still remain unpublished in the King of\r\nFrance's library. In one of these, entitled, 'The Instruction of Zosimus\r\nthe Panopolite and Philosopher, out of those written to Theosebia,\r\netc....'\" Olympiodorus was an Alexandrian of the 5th Century, whose\r\nwritings were largely commentaries on Plato and Aristotle; he is\r\nsometimes accredited with being the first to describe white arsenic\r\n(arsenical oxide). The full title of the work styled \"Stephanus to\r\nHeracleus Caesar,\" as published in Latin at Padua in 1573, was \"Stephan\r\nof Alexandria, the Universal Philosopher and Master, his nine processes\r\non the great art of making gold and silver, addressed to the Emperor\r\nHeraclius.\" He, therefore, if authentic, dates in the 7th Century.\r\n\r\nTo the next class belong those of the Middle Ages, which we give in\r\norder of date. The works attributed to Geber play such an important part\r\nin the history of Chemistry and Metallurgy that we discuss his book at\r\nlength in Appendix B. Late criticism indicates that this work was not\r\nthe production of an 8th Century Arab, but a compilation of some Latin\r\nscholar of the 12th or 13th Centuries. Arnold de Villa Nova, born about\r\n1240, died in 1313, was celebrated as a physician, philosopher, and\r\nchemist; his first works were published in Lyons in 1504; many of them\r\nhave apparently never been printed, for references may be found to some\r\n18 different works. Raymond Lully, a Spaniard, born in 1235, who was a\r\ndisciple of Arnold de Villa Nova, was stoned to death in Africa in 1315.\r\nThere are extant over 100 works attributed to this author, although\r\nagain the habit of disciples of writing under the master's name may be\r\nresponsible for most of these. John Aurelio Augurello was an Italian\r\nClassicist, born in Rimini about 1453. The work referred to,\r\n_Chrysopoeia et Gerontica_ is a poem on the art of making gold, etc.,\r\npublished in Venice, 1515, and re-published frequently thereafter; it is\r\nmuch quoted by Alchemists. With regard to Merlin, as satisfactory an\r\naccount as any of this truly English magician may be found in Mark\r\nTwain's \"Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.\" It is of some interest to\r\nnote that Agricola omits from his list Avicenna (980-1037 A.D.), Roger\r\nBacon (1214-1294), Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), Basil Valentine (end\r\n15th century?), and Paracelsus, a contemporary of his own. In _De Ortu\r\net Causis_ he expends much thought on refutation of theories advanced by\r\nAvicenna and Albertus, but of the others we have found no mention,\r\nalthough their work is, from a chemical point of view, of considerable\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n[13] _Ingestor_,--Carrier; _Discretor_,--Sorter; _Lotor_,--Washer;\r\n_Excoctor_,--Smelter.\r\n\r\n[14] Nonius Marcellus was a Roman grammarian of the 4th Century B.C. His\r\nextant treatise is entitled, _De Compendiosa Doctrina per Litteras ad\r\nFilium_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany persons hold the opinion that the metal industries are fortuitous\r\nand that the occupation is one of sordid toil, and altogether a kind of\r\nbusiness requiring not so much skill as labour. But as for myself, when\r\nI reflect carefully upon its special points one by one, it appears to be\r\nfar otherwise. For a miner must have the greatest skill in his work,\r\nthat he may know first of all what mountain or hill, what valley or\r\nplain, can be prospected most profitably, or what he should leave alone;\r\nmoreover, he must understand the veins, stringers[1] and seams in the\r\nrocks[2]. Then he must be thoroughly familiar with the many and varied\r\nspecies of earths, juices[3], gems, stones, marbles, rocks, metals, and\r\ncompounds[4]. He must also have a complete knowledge of the method of\r\nmaking all underground works. Lastly, there are the various systems of\r\nassaying[5] substances and of preparing them for smelting; and here\r\nagain there are many altogether diverse methods. For there is one method\r\nfor gold and silver, another for copper, another for quicksilver,\r\nanother for iron, another for lead, and even tin and bismuth[6] are\r\ntreated differently from lead. Although the evaporation of juices is an\r\nart apparently quite distinct from metallurgy, yet they ought not to be\r\nconsidered separately, inasmuch as these juices are also often dug out\r\nof the ground solidified, or they are produced from certain kinds of\r\nearth and stones which the miners dig up, and some of the juices are not\r\nthemselves devoid of metals. Again, their treatment is not simple, since\r\nthere is one method for common salt, another for soda[7], another for\r\nalum, another for vitriol[8], another for sulphur, and another for\r\nbitumen.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are many arts and sciences of which a miner should\r\nnot be ignorant. First there is Philosophy, that he may discern the\r\norigin, cause, and nature of subterranean things; for then he will be\r\nable to dig out the veins easily and advantageously, and to obtain more\r\nabundant results from his mining. Secondly, there is Medicine, that he\r\nmay be able to look after his diggers and other workmen, that they do\r\nnot meet with those diseases to which they are more liable than workmen\r\nin other occupations, or if they do meet with them, that he himself may\r\nbe able to heal them or may see that the doctors do so. Thirdly follows\r\nAstronomy, that he may know the divisions of the heavens and from them\r\njudge the direction of the veins. Fourthly, there is the science of\r\nSurveying that he may be able to estimate how deep a shaft should be\r\nsunk to reach the tunnel which is being driven to it, and to determine\r\nthe limits and boundaries in these workings, especially in depth.\r\nFifthly, his knowledge of Arithmetical Science should be such that he\r\nmay calculate the cost to be incurred in the machinery and the working\r\nof the mine. Sixthly, his learning must comprise Architecture, that he\r\nhimself may construct the various machines and timber work required\r\nunderground, or that he may be able to explain the method of the\r\nconstruction to others. Next, he must have knowledge of Drawing, that he\r\ncan draw plans of his machinery. Lastly, there is the Law, especially\r\nthat dealing with metals, that he may claim his own rights, that he may\r\nundertake the duty of giving others his opinion on legal matters, that\r\nhe may not take another man's property and so make trouble for himself,\r\nand that he may fulfil his obligations to others according to the law.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore necessary that those who take an interest in the methods\r\nand precepts of mining and metallurgy should read these and others of\r\nour books studiously and diligently; or on every point they should\r\nconsult expert mining people, though they will discover few who are\r\nskilled in the whole art. As a rule one man understands only the methods\r\nof mining, another possesses the knowledge of washing[9], another is\r\nexperienced in the art of smelting, another has a knowledge of measuring\r\nthe hidden parts of the earth, another is skilful in the art of making\r\nmachines, and finally, another is learned in mining law. But as for us,\r\nthough we may not have perfected the whole art of the discovery and\r\npreparation of metals, at least we can be of great assistance to persons\r\nstudious in its acquisition.\r\n\r\nBut let us now approach the subject we have undertaken. Since there has\r\nalways been the greatest disagreement amongst men concerning metals and\r\nmining, some praising, others utterly condemning them, therefore I have\r\ndecided that before imparting my instruction, I should carefully weigh\r\nthe facts with a view to discovering the truth in this matter.\r\n\r\nSo I may begin with the question of utility, which is a two-fold one,\r\nfor either it may be asked whether the art of mining is really\r\nprofitable or not to those who are engaged in it, or whether it is\r\nuseful or not to the rest of mankind. Those who think mining of no\r\nadvantage to the men who follow the occupation assert, first, that\r\nscarcely one in a hundred who dig metals or other such things derive\r\nprofit therefrom; and again, that miners, because they entrust their\r\ncertain and well-established wealth to dubious and slippery fortune,\r\ngenerally deceive themselves, and as a result, impoverished by expenses\r\nand losses, in the end spend the most bitter and most miserable of\r\nlives. But persons who hold these views do not perceive how much a\r\nlearned and experienced miner differs from one ignorant and unskilled in\r\nthe art. The latter digs out the ore without any careful discrimination,\r\nwhile the former first assays and proves it, and when he finds the veins\r\neither too narrow and hard, or too wide and soft, he infers therefrom\r\nthat these cannot be mined profitably, and so works only the approved\r\nones. What wonder then if we find the incompetent miner suffers loss,\r\nwhile the competent one is rewarded by an abundant return from his\r\nmining? The same thing applies to husbandmen. For those who cultivate\r\nland which is alike arid, heavy, and barren, and in which they sow\r\nseeds, do not make so great a harvest as those who cultivate a fertile\r\nand mellow soil and sow their grain in that. And since by far the\r\ngreater number of miners are unskilled rather than skilled in the art,\r\nit follows that mining is a profitable occupation to very few men, and a\r\nsource of loss to many more. Therefore the mass of miners who are quite\r\nunskilled and ignorant in the knowledge of veins not infrequently lose\r\nboth time and trouble[10]. Such men are accustomed for the most part to\r\ntake to mining, either when through being weighted with the fetters of\r\nlarge and heavy debts, they have abandoned a business, or desiring to\r\nchange their occupation, have left the reaping-hook and plough; and so\r\nif at any time such a man discovers rich veins or other abounding mining\r\nproduce, this occurs more by good luck than through any knowledge on his\r\npart. We learn from history that mining has brought wealth to many, for\r\nfrom old writings it is well known that prosperous Republics, not a few\r\nkings, and many private persons, have made fortunes through mines and\r\ntheir produce. This subject, by the use of many clear and illustrious\r\nexamples, I have dilated upon and explained in the first Book of my work\r\nentitled \"_De Veteribus et Novis Metallis_,\" from which it is evident\r\nthat mining is very profitable to those who give it care and attention.\r\n\r\nAgain, those who condemn the mining industry say that it is not in the\r\nleast stable, and they glorify agriculture beyond measure. But I do not\r\nsee how they can say this with truth, for the silver mines at Freiberg\r\nin Meissen remain still unexhausted after 400 years, and the lead mines\r\nof Goslar after 600 years. The proof of this can be found in the\r\nmonuments of history. The gold and silver mines belonging to the\r\ncommunities of Schemnitz and Cremnitz have been worked for 800 years,\r\nand these latter are said to be the most ancient privileges of the\r\ninhabitants. Some then say the profit from an individual mine is\r\nunstable, as if forsooth, the miner is, or ought to be dependent on only\r\none mine, and as if many men do not bear in common their expenses in\r\nmining, or as if one experienced in his art does not dig another vein,\r\nif fortune does not amply respond to his prayers in the first case. The\r\nNew Schoenberg at Freiberg has remained stable beyond the memory of\r\nman[11].\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to detract anything from the dignity of\r\nagriculture, and that the profits of mining are less stable I will\r\nalways and readily admit, for the veins do in time cease to yield\r\nmetals, whereas the fields bring forth fruits every year. But though the\r\nbusiness of mining may be less reliable it is more productive, so that\r\nin reckoning up, what is wanting in stability is found to be made up by\r\nproductiveness. Indeed, the yearly profit of a lead mine in comparison\r\nwith the fruitfulness of the best fields, is three times or at least\r\ntwice as great. How much does the profit from gold or silver mines\r\nexceed that earned from agriculture? Wherefore truly and shrewdly does\r\nXenophon[12] write about the Athenian silver mines: \"There is land of\r\nsuch a nature that if you sow, it does not yield crops, but if you dig,\r\nit nourishes many more than if it had borne fruit.\" So let the farmers\r\nhave for themselves the fruitful fields and cultivate the fertile hills\r\nfor the sake of their produce; but let them leave to miners the gloomy\r\nvalleys and sterile mountains, that they may draw forth from these, gems\r\nand metals which can buy, not only the crops, but all things that are\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nThe critics say further that mining is a perilous occupation to pursue,\r\nbecause the miners are sometimes killed by the pestilential air which\r\nthey breathe; sometimes their lungs rot away; sometimes the men perish\r\nby being crushed in masses of rock; sometimes, falling from the ladders\r\ninto the shafts, they break their arms, legs, or necks; and it is added\r\nthere is no compensation which should be thought great enough to\r\nequalize the extreme dangers to safety and life. These occurrences, I\r\nconfess, are of exceeding gravity, and moreover, fraught with terror and\r\nperil, so that I should consider that the metals should not be dug up at\r\nall, if such things were to happen very frequently to the miners, or if\r\nthey could not safely guard against such risks by any means. Who would\r\nnot prefer to live rather than to possess all things, even the metals?\r\nFor he who thus perishes possesses nothing, but relinquishes all to his\r\nheirs. But since things like this rarely happen, and only in so far as\r\nworkmen are careless, they do not deter miners from carrying on their\r\ntrade any more than it would deter a carpenter from his, because one of\r\nhis mates has acted incautiously and lost his life by falling from a\r\nhigh building. I have thus answered each argument which critics are wont\r\nto put before me when they assert that mining is an undesirable\r\noccupation, because it involves expense with uncertainty of return,\r\nbecause it is changeable, and because it is dangerous to those engaged\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nNow I come to those critics who say that mining is not useful to the\r\nrest of mankind because forsooth, gems, metals, and other mineral\r\nproducts are worthless in themselves. This admission they try to extort\r\nfrom us, partly by arguments and examples, partly by misrepresentations\r\nand abuse of us. First, they make use of this argument: \"The earth does\r\nnot conceal and remove from our eyes those things which are useful and\r\nnecessary to mankind, but on the contrary, like a beneficent and kindly\r\nmother she yields in large abundance from her bounty and brings into the\r\nlight of day the herbs, vegetables, grains, and fruits, and the trees.\r\nThe minerals on the other hand she buries far beneath in the depth of\r\nthe ground; therefore, they should not be sought. But they are dug out\r\nby wicked men who, as the poets say, are the products of the Iron Age.\"\r\nOvid censures their audacity in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n     \"And not only was the rich soil required to furnish corn and\r\n     due sustenance, but men even descended into the entrails of the\r\n     earth, and they dug up riches, those incentives to vice, which\r\n     the earth had hidden and had removed to the Stygian shades.\r\n     Then destructive iron came forth, and gold, more destructive\r\n     than iron; then war came forth.\"[13]\r\n\r\nAnother of their arguments is this: Metals offer to men no advantages,\r\ntherefore we ought not to search them out. For whereas man is composed\r\nof soul and body, neither is in want of minerals. The sweetest food of\r\nthe soul is the contemplation of nature, a knowledge of the finest arts\r\nand sciences, an understanding of virtue; and if he interests his mind\r\nin excellent things, if he exercise his body, he will be satisfied with\r\nthis feast of noble thoughts and knowledge, and have no desire for other\r\nthings. Now although the human body may be content with necessary food\r\nand clothing, yet the fruits of the earth and the animals of different\r\nkinds supply him in wonderful abundance with food and drink, from which\r\nthe body may be suitably nourished and strengthened and life prolonged\r\nto old age. Flax, wool, and the skins of many animals provide plentiful\r\nclothing low in price; while a luxurious kind, not hard to procure--that\r\nis the so called _seric_ material, is furnished by the down of trees and\r\nthe webs of the silk worm. So that the body has absolutely no need of\r\nthe metals, so hidden in the depths of the earth and for the greater\r\npart very expensive. Wherefore it is said that this maxim of Euripides\r\nis approved in assemblies of learned men, and with good reason was\r\nalways on the lips of Socrates:\r\n\r\n     \"Works of silver and purple are of use, not for human life, but\r\n     rather for Tragedians.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThese critics praise also this saying from Timocreon of Rhodes:\r\n\r\n     \"O Unseeing Plutus, would that thou hadst never appeared in the\r\n     earth or in the sea or on the land, but that thou didst have\r\n     thy habitation in Tartarus and Acheron, for out of thee arise\r\n     all evil things which overtake mankind\"[15].\r\n\r\nThey greatly extol these lines from Phocylides:\r\n\r\n     \"Gold and silver are injurious to mortals; gold is the source\r\n     of crime, the plague of life, and the ruin of all things. Would\r\n     that thou were not such an attractive scourge! because of thee\r\n     arise robberies, homicides, warfare, brothers are maddened\r\n     against brothers, and children against parents.\"\r\n\r\nThis from Naumachius also pleases them:\r\n\r\n     \"Gold and silver are but dust, like the stones that lie\r\n     scattered on the pebbly beach, or on the margins of the\r\n     rivers.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they censure these verses of Euripides:\r\n\r\n     \"Plutus is the god for wise men; all else is mere folly and at\r\n     the same time a deception in words.\"\r\n\r\nSo in like manner these lines from Theognis:\r\n\r\n     \"O Plutus, thou most beautiful and placid god! whilst I have\r\n     thee, however bad I am, I can be regarded as good.\"\r\n\r\nThey also blame Aristodemus, the Spartan, for these words:\r\n\r\n     \"Money makes the man; no one who is poor is either good or\r\n     honoured.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they rebuke these songs of Timocles:\r\n\r\n     \"Money is the life and soul of mortal men. He who has not\r\n     heaped up riches for himself wanders like a dead man amongst\r\n     the living.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, they blame Menander when he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Epicharmus asserts that the gods are water, wind, fire, earth,\r\n     sun, and stars. But I am of opinion that the gods of any use to\r\n     us are silver and gold; for if thou wilt set these up in thy\r\n     house thou mayest seek whatever thou wilt. All things will fall\r\n     to thy lot; land, houses, slaves, silver-work; moreover\r\n     friends, judges, and witnesses. Only give freely, for thus thou\r\n     hast the gods to serve thee.\"\r\n\r\nBut besides this, the strongest argument of the detractors is that the\r\nfields are devastated by mining operations, for which reason formerly\r\nItalians were warned by law that no one should dig the earth for metals\r\nand so injure their very fertile fields, their vineyards, and their\r\nolive groves. Also they argue that the woods and groves are cut down,\r\nfor there is need of an endless amount of wood for timbers, machines,\r\nand the smelting of metals. And when the woods and groves are felled,\r\nthen are exterminated the beasts and birds, very many of which furnish a\r\npleasant and agreeable food for man. Further, when the ores are washed,\r\nthe water which has been used poisons the brooks and streams, and either\r\ndestroys the fish or drives them away. Therefore the inhabitants of\r\nthese regions, on account of the devastation of their fields, woods,\r\ngroves, brooks and rivers, find great difficulty in procuring the\r\nnecessaries of life, and by reason of the destruction of the timber they\r\nare forced to greater expense in erecting buildings. Thus it is said, it\r\nis clear to all that there is greater detriment from mining than the\r\nvalue of the metals which the mining produces.\r\n\r\nSo in fierce contention they clamour, showing by such examples as follow\r\nthat every great man has been content with virtue, and despised metals.\r\nThey praise Bias because he esteemed the metals merely as fortune's\r\nplaythings, not as his real wealth. When his enemies had captured his\r\nnative Priene, and his fellow-citizens laden with precious things had\r\nbetaken themselves to flight, he was asked by one, why he carried away\r\nnone of his goods with him, and he replied, \"I carry all my possessions\r\nwith me.\" And it is said that Socrates, having received twenty minae\r\nsent to him by Aristippus, a grateful disciple, refused them and sent\r\nthem back to him by the command of his conscience. Aristippus, following\r\nhis example in this matter, despised gold and regarded it as of no\r\nvalue. And once when he was making a journey with his slaves, and they,\r\nladen with the gold, went too slowly, he ordered them to keep only as\r\nmuch of it as they could carry without distress and to throw away the\r\nremainder[16]. Moreover, Anacreon of Teos, an ancient and noble poet,\r\nbecause he had been troubled about them for two nights, returned five\r\ntalents which had been given him by Polycrates, saying that they were\r\nnot worth the anxiety which he had gone through on their account. In\r\nlike manner celebrated and exceedingly powerful princes have imitated\r\nthe philosophers in their scorn and contempt for gold and silver. There\r\nwas for example, Phocion, the Athenian, who was appointed general of the\r\narmy so many times, and who, when a large sum of gold was sent to him as\r\na gift by Alexander, King of Macedon, deemed it trifling and scorned it.\r\nAnd Marcus Curius ordered the gold to be carried back to the Samnites,\r\nas did also Fabricius Luscinus with regard to the silver and copper. And\r\ncertain Republics have forbidden their citizens the use and employment\r\nof gold and silver by law and ordinance; the Lacedaemonians, by the\r\ndecrees and ordinances of Lycurgus, used diligently to enquire among\r\ntheir citizens whether they possessed any of these things or not, and\r\nthe possessor, when he was caught, was punished according to law and\r\njustice. The inhabitants of a town on the Tigris, called Babytace,\r\nburied their gold in the ground so that no one should use it. The\r\nScythians condemned the use of gold and silver so that they might not\r\nbecome avaricious.\r\n\r\nFurther are the metals reviled; in the first place people wantonly abuse\r\ngold and silver and call them deadly and nefarious pests of the human\r\nrace, because those who possess them are in the greatest peril, for\r\nthose who have none lay snares for the possessors of wealth, and thus\r\nagain and again the metals have been the cause of destruction and ruin.\r\nFor example, Polymnestor, King of Thrace, to obtain possession of his\r\ngold, killed Polydorus, his noble guest and the son of Priam, his\r\nfather-in-law, and old friend. Pygmalion, the King of Tyre, in order\r\nthat he might seize treasures of gold and silver, killed his sister's\r\nhusband, a priest, taking no account of either kinship or religion. For\r\nlove of gold Eriphyle betrayed her husband Amphiaraus to his enemy.\r\nLikewise Lasthenes betrayed the city of Olynthus to Philip of Macedon.\r\nThe daughter of Spurius Tarpeius, having been bribed with gold, admitted\r\nthe Sabines into the citadel of Rome. Claudius Curio sold his country\r\nfor gold to Caesar, the Dictator. Gold, too, was the cause of the\r\ndownfall of Aesculapius, the great physician, who it was believed was\r\nthe son of Apollo. Similarly Marcus Crassus, through his eager desire\r\nfor the gold of the Parthians, was completely overcome together with his\r\nson and eleven legions, and became the jest of his enemies; for they\r\npoured liquid gold into the gaping mouth of the slain Crassus, saying:\r\n\"Thou hast thirsted for gold, therefore drink gold.\"\r\n\r\nBut why need I cite here these many examples from history?[17] It is\r\nalmost our daily experience to learn that, for the sake of obtaining\r\ngold and silver, doors are burst open, walls are pierced, wretched\r\ntravellers are struck down by rapacious and cruel men born to theft,\r\nsacrilege, invasion, and robbery. We see thieves seized and strung up\r\nbefore us, sacrilegious persons burnt alive, the limbs of robbers broken\r\non the wheel, wars waged for the same reason, which are not only\r\ndestructive to those against whom they are waged, but to those also who\r\ncarry them on. Nay, but they say that the precious metals foster all\r\nmanner of vice, such as the seduction of women, adultery, and\r\nunchastity, in short, crimes of violence against the person. Therefore\r\nthe Poets, when they represent Jove transformed into a golden shower and\r\nfalling into the lap of Danae, merely mean that he had found for himself\r\na safe road by the use of gold, by which he might enter the tower for\r\nthe purpose of violating the maiden. Moreover, the fidelity of many men\r\nis overthrown by the love of gold and silver, judicial sentences are\r\nbought, and innumerable crimes are perpetrated. For truly, as Propertius\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     \"This is indeed the Golden Age. The greatest rewards come from\r\n     gold; by gold love is won; by gold is faith destroyed; by gold\r\n     is justice bought; the law follows the track of gold, while\r\n     modesty will soon follow it when law is gone.\"\r\n\r\nDiphilus says:\r\n\r\n     \"I consider that nothing is more powerful than gold. By it all\r\n     things are torn asunder; all things are accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, all the noblest and best despise these riches, deservedly and\r\nwith justice, and esteem them as nothing. And this is said by the old\r\nman in Plautus:\r\n\r\n     \"I hate gold. It has often impelled many people to many wrong\r\n     acts.\"\r\n\r\nIn this country too, the poets inveigh with stinging reproaches against\r\nmoney coined from gold and silver. And especially did Juvenal:\r\n\r\n     \"Since the majesty of wealth is the most sacred thing among us;\r\n     although, O pernicious money, thou dost not yet inhabit a\r\n     temple, nor have we erected altars to money.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in another place:\r\n\r\n     \"Demoralising money first introduced foreign customs, and\r\n     voluptuous wealth weakened our race with disgraceful\r\n     luxury.\"[18]\r\n\r\nAnd very many vehemently praise the barter system which men used before\r\nmoney was devised, and which even now obtains among certain simple\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nAnd next they raise a great outcry against other metals, as iron, than\r\nwhich they say nothing more pernicious could have been brought into the\r\nlife of man. For it is employed in making swords, javelins, spears,\r\npikes, arrows--weapons by which men are wounded, and which cause\r\nslaughter, robbery, and wars. These things so moved the wrath of Pliny\r\nthat he wrote: \"Iron is used not only in hand to hand fighting, but also\r\nto form the winged missiles of war, sometimes for hurling engines,\r\nsometimes for lances, sometimes even for arrows. I look upon it as the\r\nmost deadly fruit of human ingenuity. For to bring Death to men more\r\nquickly we have given wings to iron and taught it to fly.\"[19] The\r\nspear, the arrow from the bow, or the bolt from the catapult and other\r\nengines can be driven into the body of only one man, while the iron\r\ncannon-ball fired through the air, can go through the bodies of many\r\nmen, and there is no marble or stone object so hard that it cannot be\r\nshattered by the force and shock. Therefore it levels the highest towers\r\nto the ground, shatters and destroys the strongest walls. Certainly the\r\nballistas which throw stones, the battering rams and other ancient war\r\nengines for making breaches in walls of fortresses and hurling down\r\nstrongholds, seem to have little power in comparison with our present\r\ncannon. These emit horrible sounds and noises, not less than thunder,\r\nflashes of fire burst from them like the lightning, striking, crushing,\r\nand shattering buildings, belching forth flames and kindling fires even\r\nas lightning flashes. So that with more justice could it be said of the\r\nimpious men of our age than of Salmoneus of ancient days, that they had\r\nsnatched lightning from Jupiter and wrested it from his hands. Nay,\r\nrather there has been sent from the infernal regions to the earth this\r\nforce for the destruction of men, so that Death may snatch to himself as\r\nmany as possible by one stroke.\r\n\r\nBut because muskets are nowadays rarely made of iron, and the large ones\r\nnever, but of a certain mixture of copper and tin, they confer more\r\nmaledictions on copper and tin than on iron. In this connection too,\r\nthey mention the brazen bull of Phalaris, the brazen ox of the people of\r\nPergamus, racks in the shape of an iron dog or a horse, manacles,\r\nshackles, wedges, hooks, and red-hot plates. Cruelly racked by such\r\ninstruments, people are driven to confess crimes and misdeeds which they\r\nhave never committed, and innocent men are miserably tortured to death\r\nby every conceivable kind of torment.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed too, that lead is a pestilential and noxious metal, for\r\nmen are punished by means of molten lead, as Horace describes in the ode\r\naddressed to the Goddess Fortune: \"Cruel Necessity ever goes before thee\r\nbearing in her brazen hand the spikes and wedges, while the awful hook\r\nand molten lead are also not lacking.\"[20] In their desire to excite\r\ngreater odium for this metal, they are not silent about the leaden balls\r\nof muskets, and they find in it the cause of wounds and death.\r\n\r\nThey contend that, inasmuch as Nature has concealed metals far within\r\nthe depths of the earth, and because they are not necessary to human\r\nlife, they are therefore despised and repudiated by the noblest, and\r\nshould not be mined, and seeing that when brought to light they have\r\nalways proved the cause of very great evils, it follows that mining is\r\nnot useful to mankind, but on the contrary harmful and destructive.\r\nSeveral good men have been so perturbed by these tragedies that they\r\nconceive an intensely bitter hatred toward metals, and they wish\r\nabsolutely that metals had never been created, or being created, that no\r\none had ever dug them out. The more I commend the singular honesty,\r\ninnocence, and goodness of such men, the more anxious shall I be to\r\nremove utterly and eradicate all error from their minds and to reveal\r\nthe sound view, which is that the metals are most useful to mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the first place then, those who speak ill of the metals and refuse to\r\nmake use of them, do not see that they accuse and condemn as wicked the\r\nCreator Himself, when they assert that He fashioned some things vainly\r\nand without good cause, and thus they regard Him as the Author of evils,\r\nwhich opinion is certainly not worthy of pious and sensible men.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the earth does not conceal metals in her depths\r\nbecause she does not wish that men should dig them out, but because\r\nprovident and sagacious Nature has appointed for each thing its place.\r\nShe generates them in the veins, stringers, and seams in the rocks, as\r\nthough in special vessels and receptacles for such material. The metals\r\ncannot be produced in the other elements because the materials for their\r\nformation are wanting. For if they were generated in the air, a thing\r\nthat rarely happens, they could not find a firm resting-place, but by\r\ntheir own force and weight would settle down on to the ground. Seeing\r\nthen that metals have their proper abiding place in the bowels of the\r\nearth, who does not see that these men do not reach their conclusions by\r\ngood logic?\r\n\r\nThey say, \"Although metals are in the earth, each located in its own\r\nproper place where it originated, yet because they lie thus enclosed and\r\nhidden from sight, they should not be taken out.\" But, in refutation of\r\nthese attacks, which are so annoying, I will on behalf of the metals\r\ninstance the fish, which we catch, hidden and concealed though they be\r\nin the water, even in the sea. Indeed, it is far stranger that man, a\r\nterrestrial animal, should search the interior of the sea than the\r\nbowels of the earth. For as birds are born to fly freely through the\r\nair, so are fishes born to swim through the waters, while to other\r\ncreatures Nature has given the earth that they might live in it, and\r\nparticularly to man that he might cultivate it and draw out of its\r\ncaverns metals and other mineral products. On the other hand, they say\r\nthat we eat fish, but neither hunger nor thirst is dispelled by\r\nminerals, nor are they useful in clothing the body, which is another\r\nargument by which these people strive to prove that metals should not be\r\ntaken out. But man without metals cannot provide those things which he\r\nneeds for food and clothing. For, though the produce of the land\r\nfurnishes the greatest abundance of food for the nourishment of our\r\nbodies, no labour can be carried on and completed without tools. The\r\nground itself is turned up with ploughshares and harrows, tough stalks\r\nand the tops of the roots are broken off and dug up with a mattock, the\r\nsown seed is harrowed, the corn field is hoed and weeded; the ripe\r\ngrain with part of the stalk is cut down by scythes and threshed on the\r\nfloor, or its ears are cut off and stored in the barn and later beaten\r\nwith flails and winnowed with fans, until finally the pure grain is\r\nstored in the granary, whence it is brought forth again when occasion\r\ndemands or necessity arises. Again, if we wish to procure better and\r\nmore productive fruits from trees and bushes, we must resort to\r\ncultivating, pruning, and grafting, which cannot be done without tools.\r\nEven as without vessels we cannot keep or hold liquids, such as milk,\r\nhoney, wine, or oil, neither could so many living things be cared for\r\nwithout buildings to protect them from long-continued rain and\r\nintolerable cold. Most of the rustic instruments are made of iron, as\r\nploughshares, share-beams, mattocks, the prongs of harrows, hoes,\r\nplanes, hay-forks, straw cutters, pruning shears, pruning hooks, spades,\r\nlances, forks, and weed cutters. Vessels are also made of copper or\r\nlead. Neither are wooden instruments or vessels made without iron. Wine\r\ncellars, oil-mills, stables, or any other part of a farm building could\r\nnot be built without iron tools. Then if the bull, the wether, the goat,\r\nor any other domestic animal is led away from the pasture to the\r\nbutcher, or if the poulterer brings from the farm a chicken, a hen, or a\r\ncapon for the cook, could any of these animals be cut up and divided\r\nwithout axes and knives? I need say nothing here about bronze and copper\r\npots for cooking, because for these purposes one could make use of\r\nearthen vessels, but even these in turn could not be made and fashioned\r\nby the potter without tools, for no instruments can be made out of wood\r\nalone, without the use of iron. Furthermore, hunting, fowling, and\r\nfishing supply man with food, but when the stag has been ensnared does\r\nnot the hunter transfix him with his spear? As he stands or runs, does\r\nhe not pierce him with an arrow? Or pierce him with a bullet? Does not\r\nthe fowler in the same way kill the moor-fowl or pheasant with an arrow?\r\nOr does he not discharge into its body the ball from the musket? I will\r\nnot speak of the snares and other instruments with which the woodcock,\r\nwoodpecker, and other wild birds are caught, lest I pursue unseasonably\r\nand too minutely single instances. Lastly, with his fish-hook and net\r\ndoes not the fisherman catch the fish in the sea, in the lakes, in\r\nfish-ponds, or in rivers? But the hook is of iron, and sometimes we see\r\nlead or iron weights attached to the net. And most fish that are caught\r\nare afterward cut up and disembowelled with knives and axes. But, more\r\nthan enough has been said on the matter of food.\r\n\r\nNow I will speak of clothing, which is made out of wool, flax, feathers,\r\nhair, fur, or leather. First the sheep are sheared, then the wool is\r\ncombed. Next the threads are drawn out, while later the warp is\r\nsuspended in the shuttle under which passes the wool. This being struck\r\nby the comb, at length cloth is formed either from threads alone or from\r\nthreads and hair. Flax, when gathered, is first pulled by hooks. Then it\r\nis dipped in water and afterward dried, beaten into tow with a heavy\r\nmallet, and carded, then drawn out into threads, and finally woven into\r\ncloth. But has the artisan or weaver of the cloth any instrument not\r\nmade of iron? Can one be made of wood without the aid of iron? The\r\ncloth or web must be cut into lengths for the tailor. Can this be done\r\nwithout knife or scissors? Can the tailor sew together any garments\r\nwithout a needle? Even peoples dwelling beyond the seas cannot make a\r\ncovering for their bodies, fashioned of feathers, without these same\r\nimplements. Neither can the furriers do without them in sewing together\r\nthe pelts of any kind of animals. The shoemaker needs a knife to cut the\r\nleather, another to scrape it, and an awl to perforate it before he can\r\nmake shoes. These coverings for the body are either woven or stitched.\r\nBuildings too, which protect the same body from rain, wind, cold, and\r\nheat, are not constructed without axes, saws, and augers.\r\n\r\nBut what need of more words? If we remove metals from the service of\r\nman, all methods of protecting and sustaining health and more carefully\r\npreserving the course of life are done away with. If there were no\r\nmetals, men would pass a horrible and wretched existence in the midst of\r\nwild beasts; they would return to the acorns and fruits and berries of\r\nthe forest. They would feed upon the herbs and roots which they plucked\r\nup with their nails. They would dig out caves in which to lie down at\r\nnight, and by day they would rove in the woods and plains at random like\r\nbeasts, and inasmuch as this condition is utterly unworthy of humanity,\r\nwith its splendid and glorious natural endowment, will anyone be so\r\nfoolish or obstinate as not to allow that metals are necessary for food\r\nand clothing and that they tend to preserve life?\r\n\r\nMoreover, as the miners dig almost exclusively in mountains otherwise\r\nunproductive, and in valleys invested in gloom, they do either slight\r\ndamage to the fields or none at all. Lastly, where woods and glades are\r\ncut down, they may be sown with grain after they have been cleared from\r\nthe roots of shrubs and trees. These new fields soon produce rich crops,\r\nso that they repair the losses which the inhabitants suffer from\r\nincreased cost of timber. Moreover, with the metals which are melted\r\nfrom the ore, birds without number, edible beasts and fish can be\r\npurchased elsewhere and brought to these mountainous regions.\r\n\r\nI will pass to the illustrations I have mentioned. Bias of Priene, when\r\nhis country was taken, carried away out of the city none of his\r\nvaluables. So strong a man with such a reputation for wisdom had no need\r\nto fear personal danger from the enemy, but this in truth cannot be said\r\nof him because he hastily took to flight; the throwing away of his goods\r\ndoes not seem to me so great a matter, for he had lost his house, his\r\nestates, and even his country, than which nothing is more precious. Nay,\r\nI should be convinced of Bias's contempt and scorn for possessions of\r\nthis kind, if before his country was captured he had bestowed them\r\nfreely on relations and friends, or had distributed them to the very\r\npoor, for this he could have done freely and without question. Whereas\r\nhis conduct, which the Greeks admire so greatly, was due, it would seem,\r\nto his being driven out by the enemy and stricken with fear. Socrates in\r\ntruth did not despise gold, but would not accept money for his teaching.\r\nAs for Aristippus of Cyrene, if he had gathered and saved the gold which\r\nhe ordered his slaves to throw away, he might have bought the things\r\nwhich he needed for the necessaries of life, and he would not, by reason\r\nof his poverty, have then been obliged to flatter the tyrant Dionysius,\r\nnor would he ever have been called by him a King's dog. For this reason\r\nHorace, speaking of Damasippus when reviling Staberus for valuing riches\r\nvery highly, says:\r\n\r\n     \"What resemblance has the Grecian Aristippus to this fellow? He\r\n     who commanded his slaves to throw away the gold in the midst of\r\n     Libya because they went too slowly, impeded by the weight of\r\n     their burden--which of these two men is the more insane?\"[21]\r\n\r\nInsane indeed is he who makes more of riches than of virtue. Insane also\r\nis he who rejects them and considers them as worth nothing, instead of\r\nusing them with reason. Yet as to the gold which Aristippus on another\r\noccasion flung into the sea from a boat, this he did with a wise and\r\nprudent mind. For learning that it was a pirate boat in which he was\r\nsailing, and fearing for his life, he counted his gold and then throwing\r\nit of his own will into the sea, he groaned as if he had done it\r\nunwillingly. But afterward, when he escaped the peril, he said: \"It is\r\nbetter that this gold itself should be lost than that I should have\r\nperished because of it.\" Let it be granted that some philosophers, as\r\nwell as Anacreon of Teos, despised gold and silver. Anaxagoras of\r\nClazomenae also gave up his sheep-farms and became a shepherd. Crates\r\nthe Theban too, being annoyed that his estate and other kinds of wealth\r\ncaused him worry, and that in his contemplations his mind was thereby\r\ndistracted, resigned a property valued at ten talents, and taking a\r\ncloak and wallet, in poverty devoted all his thought and efforts to\r\nphilosophy. Is it true that because these philosophers despised money,\r\nall others declined wealth in cattle? Did they refuse to cultivate lands\r\nor to dwell in houses? There were certainly many, on the other hand,\r\nwho, though affluent, became famous in the pursuit of learning and in\r\nthe knowledge of divine and human laws, such as Aristotle, Cicero, and\r\nSeneca. As for Phocion, he did not deem it honest to accept the gold\r\nsent to him by Alexander. For if he had consented to use it, the king as\r\nmuch as himself would have incurred the hatred and aversion of the\r\nAthenians, and these very people were afterward so ungrateful toward\r\nthis excellent man that they compelled him to drink hemlock. For what\r\nwould have been less becoming to Marcus Curius and Fabricius Luscinus\r\nthan to accept gold from their enemies, who hoped that by these means\r\nthose leaders could be corrupted or would become odious to their fellow\r\ncitizens, their purpose being to cause dissentions among the Romans and\r\ndestroy the Republic utterly. Lycurgus, however, ought to have given\r\ninstructions to the Spartans as to the use of gold and silver, instead\r\nof abolishing things good in themselves. As to the Babytacenses, who\r\ndoes not see that they were senseless and envious? For with their gold\r\nthey might have bought things of which they were in need, or even given\r\nit to neighbouring peoples to bind them more closely to themselves with\r\ngifts and favours. Finally, the Scythians, by condemning the use of gold\r\nand silver alone, did not free themselves utterly from avarice, because\r\nalthough he is not enjoying them, one who can possess other forms of\r\nproperty may also become avaricious.\r\n\r\nNow let us reply to the attacks hurled against the products of mines. In\r\nthe first place, they call gold and silver the scourge of mankind\r\nbecause they are the cause of destruction and ruin to their possessors.\r\nBut in this manner, might not anything that we possess be called a\r\nscourge to human kind,--whether it be a horse, or a garment, or anything\r\nelse? For, whether one rides a splendid horse, or journeys well clad, he\r\nwould give occasion to a robber to kill him. Are we then not to ride on\r\nhorses, but to journey on foot, because a robber has once committed a\r\nmurder in order that he may steal a horse? Or are we not to possess\r\nclothing, because a vagabond with a sword has taken a traveller's life\r\nthat he may rob him of his garment? The possession of gold and silver is\r\nsimilar. Seeing then that men cannot conveniently do all these things,\r\nwe should be on our guard against robbers, and because we cannot always\r\nprotect ourselves from their hands, it is the special duty of the\r\nmagistrate to seize wicked and villainous men for torture, and, if need\r\nbe, for execution.\r\n\r\nAgain, the products of the mines are not themselves the cause of war.\r\nThus, for example, when a tyrant, inflamed with passion for a woman of\r\ngreat beauty, makes war on the inhabitants of her city, the fault lies\r\nin the unbridled lust of the tyrant and not in the beauty of the woman.\r\nLikewise, when another man, blinded by a passion for gold and silver,\r\nmakes war upon a wealthy people, we ought not to blame the metals but\r\ntransfer all blame to avarice. For frenzied deeds and disgraceful\r\nactions, which are wont to weaken and dishonour natural and civil laws,\r\noriginate from our own vices. Wherefore Tibullus is wrong in laying the\r\nblame for war on gold, when he says: \"This is the fault of a rich man's\r\ngold; there were no wars when beech goblets were used at banquets.\" But\r\nVirgil, speaking of Polymnestor, says that the crime of the murderer\r\nrests on avarice:\r\n\r\n     \"He breaks all law; he murders Polydorus, and obtains gold by\r\n     violence. To what wilt thou not drive mortal hearts, thou\r\n     accursed hunger for gold?\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, justly, he says, speaking of Pygmalion, who killed Sichaeus:\r\n\r\n     \"And blinded with the love of gold, he slew him unawares with\r\n     stealthy sword.\"[22]\r\n\r\nFor lust and eagerness after gold and other things make men blind, and\r\nthis wicked greed for money, all men in all times and places have\r\nconsidered dishonourable and criminal. Moreover, those who have been so\r\naddicted to avarice as to be its slaves have always been regarded as\r\nmean and sordid. Similarly, too, if by means of gold and silver and gems\r\nmen can overcome the chastity of women, corrupt the honour of many\r\npeople, bribe the course of justice and commit innumerable wickednesses,\r\nit is not the metals which are to be blamed, but the evil passions of\r\nmen which become inflamed and ignited; or it is due to the blind and\r\nimpious desires of their minds. But although these attacks against gold\r\nand silver may be directed especially against money, yet inasmuch as the\r\nPoets one after another condemn it, their criticism must be met, and\r\nthis can be done by one argument alone. Money is good for those who use\r\nit well; it brings loss and evil to those who use it ill. Hence, very\r\nrightly, Horace says:\r\n\r\n     \"Dost thou not know the value of money; and what uses it\r\n     serves? It buys bread, vegetables, and a pint of wine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again in another place:\r\n\r\n     \"Wealth hoarded up is the master or slave of each possessor; it\r\n     should follow rather than lead, the 'twisted rope.'\"[23]\r\n\r\nWhen ingenious and clever men considered carefully the system of barter,\r\nwhich ignorant men of old employed and which even to-day is used by\r\ncertain uncivilised and barbarous races, it appeared to them so\r\ntroublesome and laborious that they invented money. Indeed, nothing more\r\nuseful could have been devised, because a small amount of gold and\r\nsilver is of as great value as things cumbrous and heavy; and so peoples\r\nfar distant from one another can, by the use of money, trade very easily\r\nin those things which civilised life can scarcely do without.\r\n\r\nThe curses which are uttered against iron, copper, and lead have no\r\nweight with prudent and sensible men, because if these metals were done\r\naway with, men, as their anger swelled and their fury became unbridled,\r\nwould assuredly fight like wild beasts with fists, heels, nails, and\r\nteeth. They would strike each other with sticks, hit one another with\r\nstones, or dash their foes to the ground. Moreover, a man does not kill\r\nanother with iron alone, but slays by means of poison, starvation, or\r\nthirst. He may seize him by the throat and strangle him; he may bury him\r\nalive in the ground; he may immerse him in water and suffocate him; he\r\nmay burn or hang him; so that he can make every element a participant in\r\nthe death of men. Or, finally, a man may be thrown to the wild beasts.\r\nAnother may be sewn up wholly except his head in a sack, and thus be\r\nleft to be devoured by worms; or he may be immersed in water until he is\r\ntorn to pieces by sea-serpents. A man may be boiled in oil; he may be\r\ngreased, tied with ropes, and left exposed to be stung by flies and\r\nhornets; he may be put to death by scourging with rods or beating with\r\ncudgels, or struck down by stoning, or flung from a high place.\r\nFurthermore, a man may be tortured in more ways than one without the use\r\nof metals; as when the executioner burns the groins and armpits of his\r\nvictim with hot wax; or places a cloth in his mouth gradually, so that\r\nwhen in breathing he draws it slowly into his gullet, the executioner\r\ndraws it back suddenly and violently; or the victim's hands are fastened\r\nbehind his back, and he is drawn up little by little with a rope and\r\nthen let down suddenly. Or similarly, he may be tied to a beam and a\r\nheavy stone fastened by a cord to his feet, or finally his limbs may be\r\ntorn asunder. From these examples we see that it is not metals that are\r\nto be condemned, but our vices, such as anger, cruelty, discord, passion\r\nfor power, avarice, and lust.\r\n\r\nThe question next arises, whether we ought to count metals amongst the\r\nnumber of good things or class them amongst the bad. The Peripatetics\r\nregarded all wealth as a good thing, and merely spoke of externals as\r\nhaving to do with neither the mind nor the body. Well, let riches be an\r\nexternal thing. And, as they said, many other things may be classed as\r\ngood if it is in one's power to use them either well or ill. For good\r\nmen employ them for good, and to them they are useful. The wicked use\r\nthem badly, and to them they are harmful. There is a saying of Socrates,\r\nthat just as wine is influenced by the cask, so the character of riches\r\nis like their possessors. The Stoics, whose custom it is to argue subtly\r\nand acutely, though they did not put wealth in the category of good\r\nthings, they did not count it amongst the evil ones, but placed it in\r\nthat class which they term neutral. For to them virtue alone is good,\r\nand vice alone evil. The whole of what remains is indifferent. Thus, in\r\ntheir conviction, it matters not whether one be in good health or\r\nseriously ill; whether one be handsome or deformed. In short:\r\n\r\n     \"Whether, sprung from Inachus of old, and thus hast lived\r\n     beneath the sun in wealth, or hast been poor and despised among\r\n     men, it matters not.\"\r\n\r\nFor my part, I see no reason why anything that is in itself of use\r\nshould not be placed in the class of good things. At all events, metals\r\nare a creation of Nature, and they supply many varied and necessary\r\nneeds of the human race, to say nothing about their uses in adornment,\r\nwhich are so wonderfully blended with utility. Therefore, it is not\r\nright to degrade them from the place they hold among the good things. In\r\ntruth, if there is a bad use made of them, should they on that account\r\nbe rightly called evils? For of what good things can we not make an\r\nequally bad or good use? Let me give examples from both classes of what\r\nwe term good. Wine, by far the best drink, if drunk in moderation, aids\r\nthe digestion of food, helps to produce blood, and promotes the juices\r\nin all parts of the body. It is of use in nourishing not only the body\r\nbut the mind as well, for it disperses our dark and gloomy thoughts,\r\nfrees us from cares and anxiety, and restores our confidence. If drunk\r\nin excess, however, it injures and prostrates the body with serious\r\ndisease. An intoxicated man keeps nothing to himself; he raves and\r\nrants, and commits many wicked and infamous acts. On this subject\r\nTheognis wrote some very clever lines, which we may render thus:\r\n\r\n     \"Wine is harmful if taken with greedy lips, but if drunk in\r\n     moderation it is wholesome.\"[25]\r\n\r\nBut I linger too long over extraneous matters. I must pass on to the\r\ngifts of body and mind, amongst which strength, beauty, and genius occur\r\nto me. If then a man, relying on his strength, toils hard to maintain\r\nhimself and his family in an honest and respectable manner, he uses the\r\ngift aright, but if he makes a living out of murder and robbery, he uses\r\nit wrongly. Likewise, too, if a lovely woman is anxious to please her\r\nhusband alone she uses her beauty aright, but if she lives wantonly and\r\nis a victim of passion, she misuses her beauty. In like manner, a youth\r\nwho devotes himself to learning and cultivates the liberal arts, uses\r\nhis genius rightly. But he who dissembles, lies, cheats, and deceives by\r\nfraud and dishonesty, misuses his abilities. Now, the man who, because\r\nthey are abused, denies that wine, strength, beauty, or genius are good\r\nthings, is unjust and blasphemous towards the Most High God, Creator of\r\nthe World; so he who would remove metals from the class of blessings\r\nalso acts unjustly and blasphemously against Him. Very true, therefore,\r\nare the words which certain Greek poets have written, as Pindar:\r\n\r\n     \"Money glistens, adorned with virtue; it supplies the means by\r\n     which thou mayest act well in whatever circumstances fate may\r\n     have in store for thee.\"[26]\r\n\r\nAnd Sappho:\r\n\r\n     \"Without the love of virtue gold is a dangerous and harmful\r\n     guest, but when it is associated with virtue, it becomes the\r\n     source and height of good.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Callimachus:\r\n\r\n     \"Riches do not make men great without virtue; neither do\r\n     virtues themselves make men great without some wealth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Antiphanes:\r\n\r\n     \"Now, by the gods, why is it necessary for a man to grow rich?\r\n     Why does he desire to possess much money unless that he may, as\r\n     much as possible, help his friends, and sow the seeds of a\r\n     harvest of gratitude, sweetest of the goddesses.\"[27]\r\n\r\nHaving thus refuted the arguments and contentions of adversaries, let us\r\nsum up the advantages of the metals. In the first place, they are useful\r\nto the physician, for they furnish liberally the ingredients for\r\nmedicines, by which wounds and ulcers are cured, and even plagues; so\r\nthat certainly if there were no other reasons why we should explore the\r\ndepths of the earth, we should for the sake of medicine alone dig in the\r\nmines. Again, the metals are of use to painters, because they yield\r\ncertain pigments which, when united with the painter's slip, are injured\r\nless than others by the moisture from without. Further, mining is useful\r\nto the architects, for thus is found marble, which is suitable not only\r\nfor strengthening large buildings, but also for decoration. It is,\r\nmoreover, helpful to those whose ambition urges them toward immortal\r\nglory, because it yields metals from which are made coins, statues, and\r\nother monuments, which, next to literary records, give men in a sense\r\nimmortality. The metals are useful to merchants with very great cause,\r\nfor, as I have stated elsewhere, the use of money which is made from\r\nmetals is much more convenient to mankind than the old system of\r\nexchange of commodities. In short, to whom are the metals not of use? In\r\nvery truth, even the works of art, elegant, embellished, elaborate,\r\nuseful, are fashioned in various shapes by the artist from the metals\r\ngold, silver, brass, lead, and iron. How few artists could make\r\nanything that is beautiful and perfect without using metals? Even if\r\ntools of iron or brass were not used, we could not make tools of wood\r\nand stone without the help of metal. From all these examples are evident\r\nthe benefits and advantages derived from metals. We should not have had\r\nthese at all unless the science of mining and metallurgy had been\r\ndiscovered and handed down to us. Who then does not understand how\r\nhighly useful they are, nay rather, how necessary to the human race? In\r\na word, man could not do without the mining industry, nor did Divine\r\nProvidence will that he should.\r\n\r\nFurther, it has been asked whether to work in metals is honourable\r\nemployment for respectable people or whether it is not degrading and\r\ndishonourable. We ourselves count it amongst the honourable arts. For\r\nthat art, the pursuit of which is unquestionably not impious, nor\r\noffensive, nor mean, we may esteem honourable. That this is the nature\r\nof the mining profession, inasmuch as it promotes wealth by good and\r\nhonest methods, we shall show presently. With justice, therefore, we may\r\nclass it amongst honourable employments. In the first place, the\r\noccupation of the miner, which I must be allowed to compare with other\r\nmethods of acquiring great wealth, is just as noble as that of\r\nagriculture; for, as the farmer, sowing his seed in his fields injures\r\nno one, however profitable they may prove to him, so the miner digging\r\nfor his metals, albeit he draws forth great heaps of gold or silver,\r\nhurts thereby no mortal man. Certainly these two modes of increasing\r\nwealth are in the highest degree both noble and honourable. The booty of\r\nthe soldier, however, is frequently impious, because in the fury of the\r\nfighting he seizes all goods, sacred as well as profane. The most just\r\nking may have to declare war on cruel tyrants, but in the course of it\r\nwicked men cannot lose their wealth and possessions without dragging\r\ninto the same calamity innocent and poor people, old men, matrons,\r\nmaidens, and orphans. But the miner is able to accumulate great riches\r\nin a short time, without using any violence, fraud, or malice. That old\r\nsaying is, therefore, not always true that \"Every rich man is either\r\nwicked himself, or is the heir to wickedness.\"\r\n\r\nSome, however, who contend against us, censure and attack miners by\r\nsaying that they and their children must needs fall into penury after a\r\nshort time, because they have heaped up riches by improper means.\r\nAccording to them nothing is truer than the saying of the poet Naevius:\r\n\r\n  \"Ill gotten gains in ill fashion slip away.\"\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the wicked and sinful methods by which they\r\nsay men obtain riches from mining. When a prospect of obtaining metals\r\nshows itself in a mine, either the ruler or magistrate drives out the\r\nrightful owners of the mines from possession, or a shrewd and cunning\r\nneighbour perhaps brings a law-suit against the old possessors in order\r\nto rob them of some part of their property. Or the mine superintendent\r\nimposes on the owners such a heavy contribution on shares, that if they\r\ncannot pay, or will not, they lose their rights of possession; while the\r\nsuperintendent, contrary to all that is right, seizes upon all that they\r\nhave lost. Or, finally, the mine foreman may conceal the vein by\r\nplastering over with clay that part where the metal abounds, or by\r\ncovering it with earth, stones, stakes, or poles, in the hope that after\r\nseveral years the proprietors, thinking the mine exhausted, will abandon\r\nit, and the foreman can then excavate that remainder of the ore and keep\r\nit for himself. They even state that the scum of the miners exist wholly\r\nby fraud, deceit, and lying. For to speak of nothing else, but only of\r\nthose deceits which are practised in buying and selling, it is said they\r\neither advertise the veins with false and imaginary praises, so that\r\nthey can sell the shares in the mines at one-half more than they are\r\nworth, or on the contrary, they sometimes detract from the estimate of\r\nthem so that they can buy shares for a small price. By exposing such\r\nfrauds our critics suppose all good opinion of miners is lost. Now, all\r\nwealth, whether it has been gained by good or evil means, is liable by\r\nsome adverse chance to vanish away. It decays and is dissipated by the\r\nfault and carelessness of the owner, since he loses it through laziness\r\nand neglect, or wastes and squanders it in luxuries, or he consumes and\r\nexhausts it in gifts, or he dissipates and throws it away in gambling:\r\n\r\n\"Just as though money sprouted up again, renewed from an exhausted\r\ncoffer, and was always to be obtained from a full heap.\"\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not to be wondered at if miners do not keep in mind the\r\ncounsel given by King Agathocles: \"Unexpected fortune should be held in\r\nreverence,\" for by not doing so they fall into penury; and particularly\r\nwhen the miners are not content with moderate riches, they not rarely\r\nspend on new mines what they have accumulated from others. But no just\r\nruler or magistrate deprives owners of their possessions; that, however,\r\nmay be done by a tyrant, who may cruelly rob his subjects not only of\r\ntheir goods honestly obtained, but even of life itself. And yet whenever\r\nI have inquired into the complaints which are in common vogue, I always\r\nfind that the owners who are abused have the best of reasons for driving\r\nthe men from the mines; while those who abuse the owners have no reason\r\nto complain about them. Take the case of those who, not having paid\r\ntheir contributions, have lost the right of possession, or those who\r\nhave been expelled by the magistrate out of another man's mine: for some\r\nwicked men, mining the small veins branching from the veins rich in\r\nmetal, are wont to invade the property of another person. So the\r\nmagistrate expels these men accused of wrong, and drives them from the\r\nmine. They then very frequently spread unpleasant rumours concerning\r\nthis amongst the populace. Or, to take another case: when, as often\r\nhappens, a dispute arises between neighbours, arbitrators appointed by\r\nthe magistrate settle it, or the regular judges investigate and give\r\njudgment. Consequently, when the judgment is given, inasmuch as each\r\nparty has consented to submit to it, neither side should complain of\r\ninjustice; and when the controversy is adjudged, inasmuch as the\r\ndecision is in accordance with the laws concerning mining, one of the\r\nparties cannot be injured by the law. I do not vigorously contest the\r\npoint, that at times a mine superintendent may exact a larger\r\ncontribution from the owners than necessity demands. Nay, I will admit\r\nthat a foreman may plaster over, or hide with a structure, a vein where\r\nit is rich in metals. Is the wickedness of one or two to brand the many\r\nhonest with fraud and trickery? What body is supposed to be more pious\r\nand virtuous in the Republic than the Senate? Yet some Senators have\r\nbeen detected in peculations, and have been punished. Is this any reason\r\nthat so honourable a house should lose its good name and fame? The\r\nsuperintendent cannot exact contributions from the owners without the\r\nknowledge and permission of the Bergmeister or the deputies; for this\r\nreason deception of this kind is impossible. Should the foremen be\r\nconvicted of fraud, they are beaten with rods; or of theft, they are\r\nhanged. It is complained that some sellers and buyers of the shares in\r\nmines are fraudulent. I concede it. But can they deceive anyone except a\r\nstupid, careless man, unskilled in mining matters? Indeed, a wise and\r\nprudent man, skilled in this art, if he doubts the trustworthiness of a\r\nseller or buyer, goes at once to the mine that he may for himself\r\nexamine the vein which has been so greatly praised or disparaged, and\r\nmay consider whether he will buy or sell the shares or not. But people\r\nsay, though such an one can be on his guard against fraud, yet a simple\r\nman and one who is easily credulous, is deceived. But we frequently see\r\na man who is trying to mislead another in this way deceive himself, and\r\ndeservedly become a laughing-stock for everyone; or very often the\r\ndefrauder as well as the dupe is entirely ignorant of mining. If, for\r\ninstance, a vein has been found to be abundant in ore, contrary to the\r\nidea of the would-be deceiver, then he who was to have been cheated gets\r\na profit, and he who has been the deceiver loses. Nevertheless, the\r\nminers themselves rarely buy or sell shares, but generally they have\r\n_jurati venditores_[28] who buy and sell at such prices as they have\r\nbeen instructed to give or accept. Seeing therefore, that magistrates\r\ndecide disputes on fair and just principles, that honest men deceive\r\nnobody, while a dishonest one cannot deceive easily, or if he does he\r\ncannot do so with impunity, the criticism of those who wish to disparage\r\nthe honesty of miners has therefore no force or weight.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the occupation of the miner is objectionable to\r\nnobody. For who, unless he be naturally malevolent and envious, will\r\nhate the man who gains wealth as it were from heaven? Or who will hate a\r\nman who to amplify his fortune, adopts a method which is free from\r\nreproach? A moneylender, if he demands an excessive interest, incurs the\r\nhatred of men. If he demands a moderate and lawful rate, so that he is\r\nnot injurious to the public generally and does not impoverish them, he\r\nfails to become very rich from his business. Further, the gain derived\r\nfrom mining is not sordid, for how can it be such, seeing that it is so\r\ngreat, so plentiful, and of so innocent a nature. A merchant's profits\r\nare mean and base when he sells counterfeit and spurious merchandise, or\r\nputs far too high a price on goods that he has purchased for little; for\r\nthis reason the merchant would be held in no less odium amongst good\r\nmen than is the usurer, did they not take account of the risk he runs to\r\nsecure his merchandise. In truth, those who on this point speak\r\nabusively of mining for the sake of detracting from its merits, say that\r\nin former days men convicted of crimes and misdeeds were sentenced to\r\nthe mines and were worked as slaves. But to-day the miners receive pay,\r\nand are engaged like other workmen in the common trades.\r\n\r\nCertainly, if mining is a shameful and discreditable employment for a\r\ngentleman because slaves once worked mines, then agriculture also will\r\nnot be a very creditable employment, because slaves once cultivated the\r\nfields, and even to-day do so among the Turks; nor will architecture be\r\nconsidered honest, because some slaves have been found skilful in that\r\nprofession; nor medicine, because not a few doctors have been slaves;\r\nnor will any other worthy craft, because men captured by force of arms\r\nhave practised it. Yet agriculture, architecture, and medicine are none\r\nthe less counted amongst the number of honourable professions;\r\ntherefore, mining ought not for this reason to be excluded from them.\r\nBut suppose we grant that the hired miners have a sordid employment. We\r\ndo not mean by miners only the diggers and other workmen, but also those\r\nskilled in the mining arts, and those who invest money in mines. Amongst\r\nthem can be counted kings, princes, republics, and from these last the\r\nmost esteemed citizens. And finally, we include amongst the overseers of\r\nmines the noble Thucydides, the historian, whom the Athenians placed in\r\ncharge of the mines of Thasos.[29] And it would not be unseemly for the\r\nowners themselves to work with their own hands on the works or ore,\r\nespecially if they themselves have contributed to the cost of the mines.\r\nJust as it is not undignified for great men to cultivate their own land.\r\nOtherwise the Roman Senate would not have created Dictator L. Quintius\r\nCincinnatus, as he was at work in the fields, nor would it have summoned\r\nto the Senate House the chief men of the State from their country\r\nvillas. Similarly, in our day, Maximilian Caesar would not have enrolled\r\nConrad in the ranks of the nobles known as Counts; Conrad was really\r\nvery poor when he served in the mines of Schneeberg, and for that reason\r\nhe was nicknamed the \"poor man\"; but not many years after, he attained\r\nwealth from the mines of Fuerst, which is a city in Lorraine, and took\r\nhis name from \"Luck.\"[30] Nor would King Vladislaus have restored to the\r\nAssembly of Barons, Tursius, a citizen of Cracow, who became rich\r\nthrough the mines in that part of the kingdom of Hungary which was\r\nformerly called Dacia.[31] Nay, not even the common worker in the mines\r\nis vile and abject. For, trained to vigilance and work by night and day,\r\nhe has great powers of endurance when occasion demands, and easily\r\nsustains the fatigues and duties of a soldier, for he is accustomed to\r\nkeep long vigils at night, to wield iron tools, to dig trenches, to\r\ndrive tunnels, to make machines, and to carry burdens. Therefore,\r\nexperts in military affairs prefer the miner, not only to a commoner\r\nfrom the town, but even to the rustic.\r\n\r\nBut to bring this discussion to an end, inasmuch as the chief callings\r\nare those of the moneylender, the soldier, the merchant, the farmer, and\r\nthe miner, I say, inasmuch as usury is odious, while the spoil cruelly\r\ncaptured from the possessions of the people innocent of wrong is wicked\r\nin the sight of God and man, and inasmuch as the calling of the miner\r\nexcels in honour and dignity that of the merchant trading for lucre,\r\nwhile it is not less noble though far more profitable than agriculture,\r\nwho can fail to realize that mining is a calling of peculiar dignity?\r\nCertainly, though it is but one of ten important and excellent methods\r\nof acquiring wealth in an honourable way, a careful and diligent man can\r\nattain this result in no easier way than by mining.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Fibrae_--\"fibres.\" See Note 6, p. 70.\r\n\r\n[2] _Commissurae saxorum_--\"rock joints,\" \"seams,\" or \"cracks.\" Agricola\r\nand all of the old authors laid a wholly unwarranted geologic value on\r\nthese phenomena.

The words\r\n\"solutions\" and \"salts\" convey a chemical significance not warranted by\r\nthe state of knowledge in Agricola's time. Instances of the former use\r\nof this word may be seen in Barba's \"First Book of the Art of Metals,\"\r\n(Trans. Earl Sandwich, London, 1674, p. 2, etc.,) and in Pryce's\r\n_Mineralogia Cornubiensis_ (London, 1778, p. 25, 32).\r\n\r\n[4] In order that the reader should be able to grasp the author's point\r\nof view as to his divisions of the Mineral Kingdom, we introduce here\r\nhis own statement from _De Natura Fossilium_, (p. 180). It is also\r\ndesirable to read the footnote on his theory of ore-deposits on pages 43\r\nto 53, and the review of _De Natura Fossilium_ given in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\"The subterranean inanimate bodies are divided into two classes, one of\r\nwhich, because it is a fluid or an exhalation, is called by those names,\r\nand the other class is called the minerals. Mineral bodies are\r\nsolidified from particles of the same substance, such as pure gold, each\r\nparticle of which is gold, or they are of different substances such as\r\nlumps which consist of earth, stone, and metal; these latter may be\r\nseparated into earth, stone and metal, and therefore the first is not a\r\nmixture while the last is called a mixture. The first are again divided\r\ninto simple and compound minerals. The simple minerals are of four\r\nclasses, namely earths, solidified juices, stones and metals, while the\r\nmineral compounds are of many sorts, as I shall explain later.\r\n\r\n\"Earth is a simple mineral body which may be kneaded in the hands when\r\nmoistened, or from which lute is made when it has been wetted. Earth,\r\nproperly so called, is found enclosed in veins or veinlets, or\r\nfrequently on the surface in fields and meadows. This definition is a\r\ngeneral one. The harder earth, although moistened by water, does not at\r\nonce become lute, but does turn into lute if it remains in water for\r\nsome time. There are many species of earths, some of which have names\r\nbut others are unnamed.\r\n\r\n\"Solidified juices are dry and somewhat hard (_subdurus_) mineral bodies\r\nwhich when moistened with water do not soften but liquefy instead; or if\r\nthey do soften, they differ greatly from the earths by their\r\nunctuousness (_pingue_) or by the material of which they consist.\r\nAlthough occasionally they have the hardness of stone, yet because they\r\npreserve the form and nature which they had when less hard, they can\r\neasily be distinguished from the stones. The juices are divided into\r\n'meagre' and unctuous (_macer et pinguis_). The 'meagre' juices, since\r\nthey originate from three different substances, are of three species.\r\nThey are formed from a liquid mixed with earth, or with metal, or with a\r\nmineral compound. To the first species belong salt and _Nitrum_ (soda);\r\nto the second, chrysocolla, verdigris, iron-rust, and azure; to the\r\nthird, vitriol, alum, and an acrid juice which is unnamed. The first two\r\nof these latter are obtained from pyrites, which is numbered amongst the\r\ncompound minerals. The third of these comes from _Cadmia_ (in this case\r\nthe cobalt-zinc-arsenic minerals; the acrid juice is probably zinc\r\nsulphate). To the unctuous juices belong these species: sulphur,\r\nbitumen, realgar and orpiment. Vitriol and alum, although they are\r\nsomewhat unctuous yet do not burn, and they differ in their origin from\r\nthe unctuous juices, for the latter are forced out from the earth by\r\nheat, whereas the former are produced when pyrites is softened by\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\n\"Stone is a dry and hard mineral body which may either be softened by\r\nremaining for a long time in water and be reduced to powder by a fierce\r\nfire; or else it does not soften with water but the heat of a great fire\r\nliquefies it. To the first species belong those stones which have been\r\nsolidified by heat, to the second those solidified (literally\r\n'congealed') by cold. These two species of stones are constituted from\r\ntheir own material. However, writers on natural subjects who take into\r\nconsideration the quantity and quality of stones and their value, divide\r\nthem into four classes. The first of these has no name of its own but is\r\ncalled in common parlance 'stone': to this class belong loadstone,\r\njasper (or bloodstone) and _Aetites_ (geodes?). The second class\r\ncomprises hard stones, either pellucid or ornamental, with very\r\nbeautiful and varied colours which sparkle marvellously; they are called\r\ngems. The third comprises stones which are only brilliant after they\r\nhave been polished, and are usually called marble. The fourth are called\r\nrocks; they are found in quarries, from which they are hewn out for use\r\nin building, and they are cut into various shapes. None of the rocks\r\nshow colour or take a polish. Few of the stones sparkle; fewer still are\r\ntransparent. Marble is sometimes only distinguishable from opaque gems\r\nby its volume; rock is always distinguishable from stones properly\r\nso-called by its volume. Both the stones and the gems are usually to be\r\nfound in veins and veinlets which traverse the rocks and marble. These\r\nfour classes, as I have already stated, are divided into many species,\r\nwhich I will explain in their proper place.\r\n\r\n\"Metal is a mineral body, by nature either liquid or somewhat hard. The\r\nlatter may be melted by the heat of the fire, but when it has cooled\r\ndown again and lost all heat, it becomes hard again and resumes its\r\nproper form. In this respect it differs from the stone which melts in\r\nthe fire, for although the latter regain its hardness, yet it loses its\r\npristine form and properties. Traditionally there are six different\r\nkinds of metals, namely gold, silver, copper, iron, tin and lead. There\r\nare really others, for quicksilver is a metal, although the Alchemists\r\ndisagree with us on this subject, and bismuth is also. The ancient Greek\r\nwriters seem to have been ignorant of bismuth, wherefore Ammonius\r\nrightly states that there are many species of metals, animals, and\r\nplants which are unknown to us. _Stibium_ when smelted in the crucible\r\nand refined has as much right to be regarded as a proper metal as is\r\naccorded to lead by writers. If when smelted, a certain portion be added\r\nto tin, a bookseller's alloy is produced from which the type is made\r\nthat is used by those who print books on paper. Each metal has its own\r\nform which it preserves when separated from those metals which were\r\nmixed with it. Therefore neither electrum nor _Stannum_ is of itself a\r\nreal metal, but rather an alloy of two metals. Electrum is an alloy of\r\ngold and silver, _Stannum_ of lead and silver (see note 33, p. 473). And\r\nyet if silver be parted from the electrum, then gold remains and not\r\nelectrum; if silver be taken away from _Stannum_, then lead remains and\r\nnot _Stannum_. Whether brass, however, is found as a native metal or\r\nnot, cannot be ascertained with any surety. We only know of the\r\nartificial brass, which consists of copper tinted with the colour of the\r\nmineral calamine. And yet if any should be dug up, it would be a proper\r\nmetal. Black and white copper seem to be different from the red kind.\r\nMetal, therefore, is by nature either solid, as I have stated, or fluid,\r\nas in the unique case of quicksilver. But enough now concerning the\r\nsimple kinds.\r\n\r\n\"I will now speak of the compounds which are composed of the simple\r\nminerals cemented together by nature, and under the word 'compound' I\r\nnow discuss those mineral bodies which consist of two or three simple\r\nminerals. They are likewise mineral substances, but so thoroughly mixed\r\nand alloyed that even in the smallest part there is not wanting any\r\nsubstance that is contained in the whole. Only by the force of the fire\r\nis it possible to separate one of the simple mineral substances from\r\nanother; either the third from the other two, or two from the third, if\r\nthere were three in the same compound. These two, three or more bodies\r\nare so completely mixed into one new species that the pristine form of\r\nnone of these is recognisable.\r\n\r\n\"The 'mixed' minerals, which are composed of those same simple minerals,\r\ndiffer from the 'compounds,' in that the simple minerals each preserves\r\nits own form so that they can be separated one from the other not only\r\nby fire but sometimes by water and sometimes by hand. As these two\r\nclasses differ so greatly from one another I usually use two different\r\nwords in order to distinguish one from the other. I am well aware that\r\nGalen calls the metallic earth a compound which is really a mixture, but\r\nhe who wishes to instruct others should bestow upon each separate thing\r\na definite name.\"\r\n\r\nFor convenience of reference we may reduce the above to a diagram as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  1. Fluids and gases.\r\n\r\n                              {              { Earths\r\n                              { (a) Simple   { Solidified juices\r\n                              {     minerals { Stones\r\n                              {              { Metals\r\n             { A.

The following passage from _Bermannus_ (p. 439)\r\nis of interest, for it appears to be the first description of bismuth,\r\nalthough mention of it occurs in the _Nuetzlich Bergbuechlin_ (see\r\nAppendix B). \"_Bermannus_: I will show you another kind of mineral which\r\nis numbered amongst metals, but appears to me to have been unknown to\r\nthe Ancients; we call it _bisemutum_. _Naevius_: Then in your opinion\r\nthere are more kinds of metals than the seven commonly believed?\r\n_Bermannus_: More, I consider; for this which just now I said we called\r\n_bisemutum_, cannot correctly be called _plumbum candidum_ (tin), nor\r\n_nigrum_ (lead), but is different from both and is a third one. _Plumbum\r\ncandidum_ is whiter and _plumbum nigrum_ is darker, as you see.\r\n_Naevius_: We see that this is of the colour of _galena_. _Ancon_: How\r\nthen can _bisemutum_, as you call it, be distinguished from _galena_?\r\n_Bermannus_: Easily; when you take it in your hands it stains them with\r\nblack, unless it is quite hard. The hard kind is not friable like\r\n_galena_, but can be cut. It is blacker than the kind of _rudis_ silver\r\nwhich we say is almost the colour of lead, and thus is different from\r\nboth. Indeed, it not rarely contains some silver. It generally indicates\r\nthat there is silver beneath the place where it is found, and because of\r\nthis our miners are accustomed to call it the 'roof of silver.' They are\r\nwont to roast this mineral, and from the better part they make metal;\r\nfrom the poorer part they make a pigment of a kind not to be despised.\"\r\n\r\n[7] _Nitrum._ The Ancients comprised many salts under this head, but\r\nAgricola in the main uses it for soda, although sometimes he includes\r\npotash. He usually, however, refers to potash as _lixivium_ or salt\r\ntherefrom, and by other distinctive terms. For description of method of\r\nmanufacture and discussion, see Book XII., p. 558.\r\n\r\n[8] _Atramentum sutorium_--\"Shoemaker's blacking.\" See p. 572 for\r\ndescription of method of manufacture and historical footnote. In the\r\nmain Agricola means green vitriol, but he does describe three main\r\nvarieties, green, blue, and white (_De Natura Fossilium_, p. 219). The\r\nblue was of course copper sulphate, and it is fairly certain that the\r\nwhite was zinc vitriol.\r\n\r\n[9] _Lavandi_--\"Washing.\" By this term the author includes all the\r\noperations of sluicing, buddling, and wet concentration generally. There\r\nis no English equivalent of such wide application, and there is some\r\ndifficulty in interpretation without going further than the author\r\nintends. Book VIII. is devoted to the subject.\r\n\r\n[10] _Operam et oleum perdit_--\"loss of labour and oil.\"\r\n\r\n[11] In _Veteribus et Novis Metallis_, and _Bermannus_, Agricola states\r\nthat the mines of Schemnitz were worked 800 years before that time\r\n(1530), or about 750 A.D., and, further, that the lead mines of Goslar\r\nin the Hartz were worked by Otho the Great (936-973), and that the\r\nsilver mines at Freiberg were discovered during the rule of Prince Otho\r\n(about 1170). To continue the argument to-day we could add about 360\r\nyears more of life to the mines of Goslar and Freiberg. See also Note\r\n16, p. 36, and note 19, p. 37.\r\n\r\n[12] Xenophon.

Agricola seems to have obtained his idea that\r\nThucydides held an appointment from the Athenians in charge of mines in\r\nThasos, from Marcellinus (_Vita_, Thucydides, 30), who also says that\r\nThucydides obtained possession of mines in Thrace through his marriage\r\nwith a Thracian woman, and that it was while residing on the mines at\r\nScapte-Hyle that he wrote his history. Later scholars, however, find\r\nlittle warrant for these assertions. The gold mines of Thasos--an island\r\noff the mainland of Thrace--are frequently mentioned by the ancient\r\nauthors. Herodotus, VI., 46-47, says:--\"Their (the Thasians') revenue\r\nwas derived partly from their possessions upon the mainland, partly from\r\nthe mines which they owned. They were masters of the gold mines of\r\nScapte-Hyle, the yearly produce of which amounted to eighty talents.\r\nTheir mines in Thasos yielded less, but still were so prolific that\r\nbesides being entirely free from land-tax they had a surplus of income\r\nderived from the two sources of their territory on the mainland and\r\ntheir mines, in common years two hundred and in best years three hundred\r\ntalents. I myself have seen the mines in question. By far the most\r\ncurious of them are those which the Phoenicians discovered at the time\r\nwhen they went with Thasos and colonized the island, which took its name\r\nfrom him. These Phoenician workings are in Thasos itself, between\r\nCoenyra and a place called Aenyra over against Samothrace; a high\r\nmountain has been turned upside down in the search for ores.\"\r\n(Rawlinson's Trans.). The occasion of this statement of Herodotus was\r\nthe relations of the Thasians with Darius (521-486 B.C.). The date of\r\nthe Phoenician colonization of Thasos is highly nebular--anywhere from\r\n1200 to 900 B.C.\r\n\r\n[30] Agricola, _De Veteribus et Novis Metallis_, Book I., p. 392,\r\nsays:--\"Conrad, whose nickname in former years was 'pauper,' suddenly\r\nbecame rich from the silver mines of Mount Jura, known as the\r\n_Firstum_.\" He was ennobled with the title of Graf Cuntz von Glueck by\r\nthe Emperor Maximilian (who was Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire,\r\n1493-1519). Conrad was originally a working miner at Schneeberg where he\r\nwas known as Armer Cuntz (poor Cuntz or Conrad) and grew wealthy from\r\nthe mines of Fuerst in Leberthal. This district is located in the Vosges\r\nMountains on the borders of Lorraine and Upper Alsace. The story of\r\nCuntz or Conrad von Glueck is mentioned by Albinus (_Meissnische Land und\r\nBerg Chronica_, Dresden, 1589, p. 116), Mathesius (_Sarepta_, Nuremberg,\r\n1578, fol. XVI.), and by others.\r\n\r\n[31] Vladislaus III. was King of Poland, 1434-44, and also became King\r\nof Hungary in 1440. Tursius seems to be a Latinized name and cannot be\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\nQualities which the perfect miner should possess and the arguments which\r\nare urged for and against the arts of mining and metallurgy, as well as\r\nthe people occupied in the industry, I have sufficiently discussed in\r\nthe first Book. Now I have determined to give more ample information\r\nconcerning the miners.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is indispensable that they should worship God\r\nwith reverence, and that they understand the matters of which I am going\r\nto speak, and that they take good care that each individual performs his\r\nduties efficiently and diligently. It is decreed by Divine Providence\r\nthat those who know what they ought to do and then take care to do it\r\nproperly, for the most part meet with good fortune in all they\r\nundertake; on the other hand, misfortune overtakes the indolent and\r\nthose who are careless in their work. No person indeed can, without\r\ngreat and sustained effort and labour, store in his mind the knowledge\r\nof every portion of the metallic arts which are involved in operating\r\nmines. If a man has the means of paying the necessary expense, he hires\r\nas many men as he needs, and sends them to the various works. Thus\r\nformerly Sosias, the Thracian, sent into the silver mines a thousand\r\nslaves whom he had hired from the Athenian Nicias, the son of\r\nNiceratus[1]. But if a man cannot afford the expenditure he chooses of\r\nthe various kinds of mining that work which he himself can most easily\r\nand efficiently do. Of these kinds, the two most important are the\r\nmaking prospect trenches and the washing of the sands of rivers, for out\r\nof these sands are often collected gold dust, or certain black stones\r\nfrom which tin is smelted, or even gems are sometimes found in them; the\r\ntrenching occasionally lays bare at the grass-roots veins which are\r\nfound rich in metals. If therefore by skill or by luck, such sands or\r\nveins shall fall into his hands, he will be able to establish his\r\nfortune without expenditure, and from poverty rise to wealth. If on the\r\ncontrary, his hopes are not realized, then he can desist from washing or\r\ndigging.\r\n\r\nWhen anyone, in an endeavour to increase his fortune, meets the\r\nexpenditure of a mine alone, it is of great importance that he should\r\nattend to his works and personally superintend everything that he has\r\nordered to be done. For this reason, he should either have his dwelling\r\nat the mine, where he may always be in sight of the workmen and always\r\ntake care that none neglect their duties, or else he should live in the\r\nneighbourhood, so that he may frequently inspect his mining works. Then\r\nhe may send word by a messenger to the workmen that he is coming more\r\nfrequently than he really intends to come, and so either by his arrival\r\nor by the intimation of it, he so frightens the workmen that none of\r\nthem perform their duties otherwise than diligently. When he inspects\r\nthe mines he should praise the diligent workmen and occasionally give\r\nthem rewards, that they and the others may become more zealous in their\r\nduties; on the other hand, he should rebuke the idle and discharge some\r\nof them from the mines and substitute industrious men in their places.\r\nIndeed, the owner should frequently remain for days and nights in the\r\nmine, which, in truth, is no habitation for the idle and luxurious; it\r\nis important that the owner who is diligent in increasing his wealth,\r\nshould frequently himself descend into the mine, and devote some time to\r\nthe study of the nature of the veins and stringers, and should observe\r\nand consider all the methods of working, both inside and outside the\r\nmine. Nor is this all he ought to do, for sometimes he should undertake\r\nactual labour, not thereby demeaning himself, but in order to encourage\r\nhis workmen by his own diligence, and to teach them their art; for that\r\nmine is well conducted in which not only the foreman, but also the owner\r\nhimself, gives instruction as to what ought to be done. A certain\r\nbarbarian, according to Xenophon, rightly remarked to the King of Persia\r\nthat \"the eye of the master feeds the horse,\"[2] for the master's\r\nwatchfulness in all things is of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nWhen several share together the expenditure on a mine, it is convenient\r\nand useful to elect from amongst their own number a mine captain, and\r\nalso a foreman. For, since men often look after their own interests but\r\nneglect those of others, they cannot in this case take care of their own\r\nwithout at the same time looking after the interests of the others,\r\nneither can they neglect the interests of the others without neglecting\r\ntheir own. But if no man amongst them be willing or able to undertake\r\nand sustain the burdens of these offices, it will be to the common\r\ninterest to place them in the hands of most diligent men. Formerly\r\nindeed, these things were looked after by the mining prefect[3], because\r\nthe owners were kings, as Priam, who owned the gold mines round Abydos,\r\nor as Midas, who was the owner of those situated in Mount Bermius, or as\r\nGyges, or as Alyattes, or as Croesus, who was the owner of those mines\r\nnear a deserted town between Atarnea and Pergamum[4]; sometimes the\r\nmines belonged to a Republic, as, for instance, the prosperous silver\r\nmines in Spain which belonged to Carthage[5]; sometimes they were the\r\nproperty of great and illustrious families, as were the Athenian mines\r\nin Mount Laurion[6].\r\n\r\nWhen a man owns mines but is ignorant of the art of mining, then it is\r\nadvisable that he should share in common with others the expenses, not\r\nof one only, but of several mines. When one man alone meets the expense\r\nfor a long time of a whole mine, if good fortune bestows on him a vein\r\nabundant in metals, or in other products, he becomes very wealthy; if,\r\non the contrary, the mine is poor and barren, in time he will lose\r\neverything which he has expended on it. But the man who, in common with\r\nothers, has laid out his money on several mines in a region renowned for\r\nits wealth of metals, rarely spends it in vain, for fortune usually\r\nresponds to his hopes in part. For when out of twelve veins in which he\r\nhas a joint interest one yields an abundance of metals, it not only\r\ngives back to the owner the money he has spent, but also gives a profit\r\nbesides; certainly there will be for him rich and profitable mining, if\r\nof the whole number, three, or four, or more veins should yield metal.\r\nVery similar to this is the advice which Xenophon gave to the Athenians\r\nwhen they wished to prospect for new veins of silver without suffering\r\nloss. \"There are,\" he said, \"ten tribes of Athenians; if, therefore, the\r\nState assigned an equal number of slaves to each tribe, and the tribes\r\nparticipated equally in all the new veins, undoubtedly by this method,\r\nif a rich vein of silver were found by one tribe, whatever profit were\r\nmade from it would assuredly be shared by the whole number. And if two,\r\nthree, or four tribes, or even half the whole number find veins, their\r\nworks would then become more profitable; and it is not probable that the\r\nwork of all the tribes will be disappointing.\"[7] Although this advice\r\nof Xenophon is full of prudence, there is no opportunity for it except\r\nin free and wealthy States; for those people who are under the authority\r\nof kings and princes, or are kept in subjection by tyranny, do not dare,\r\nwithout permission, to incur such expenditure; those who are endowed\r\nwith little wealth and resources cannot do so on account of insufficient\r\nfunds. Moreover, amongst our race it is not customary for Republics to\r\nhave slaves whom they can hire out for the benefit of the people[8];\r\nbut, instead, nowadays those who are in authority administer the funds\r\nfor mining in the name of the State, not unlike private individuals.\r\n\r\nSome owners prefer to buy shares[9] in mines abounding in metals,\r\nrather than to be troubled themselves to search for the veins; these men\r\nemploy an easier and less uncertain method of increasing their property.\r\nAlthough their hopes in the shares of one or another mine may be\r\nfrustrated, the buyers of shares should not abandon the rest of the\r\nmines, for all the money expended will be recovered with interest from\r\nsome other mine. They should not buy only high priced shares in those\r\nmines producing metals, nor should they buy too many in neighbouring\r\nmines where metal has not yet been found, lest, should fortune not\r\nrespond, they may be exhausted by their losses and have nothing with\r\nwhich they may meet their expenses or buy other shares which may replace\r\ntheir losses. This calamity overtakes those who wish to grow suddenly\r\nrich from mines, and instead, they become very much poorer than before.\r\nSo then, in the buying of shares, as in other matters, there should be a\r\ncertain limit of expenditure which miners should set themselves, lest\r\nblinded by the desire for excessive wealth, they throw all their money\r\naway. Moreover, a prudent owner, before he buys shares, ought to go to\r\nthe mine and carefully examine the nature of the vein, for it is very\r\nimportant that he should be on his guard lest fraudulent sellers of\r\nshares should deceive him. Investors in shares may perhaps become less\r\nwealthy, but they are more certain of some gain than those who mine for\r\nmetals at their own expense, as they are more cautious in trusting to\r\nfortune. Neither ought miners to be altogether distrustful of fortune,\r\nas we see some are, who as soon as the shares of any mine begin to go up\r\nin value, sell them, on which account they seldom obtain even moderate\r\nwealth. There are some people who wash over the dumps from exhausted and\r\nabandoned mines, and those dumps which are derived from the drains of\r\ntunnels; and others who smelt the old slags; from all of which they make\r\nan ample return.\r\n\r\nNow a miner, before he begins to mine the veins, must consider seven\r\nthings, namely:--the situation, the conditions, the water, the roads,\r\nthe climate, the right of ownership, and the neighbours. There are four\r\nkinds of situations--mountain, hill, valley, and plain. Of these four,\r\nthe first two are the most easily mined, because in them tunnels can be\r\ndriven to drain off the water, which often makes mining operations very\r\nlaborious, if it does not stop them altogether. The last two kinds of\r\nground are more troublesome, especially because tunnels cannot be driven\r\nin such places. Nevertheless, a prudent miner considers all these four\r\nsorts of localities in the region in which he happens to be, and he\r\nsearches for veins in those places where some torrent or other agency\r\nhas removed and swept the soil away; yet he need not prospect\r\neverywhere, but since there is a great variety, both in mountains and in\r\nthe three other kinds of localities, he always selects from them those\r\nwhich will give him the best chance of obtaining wealth.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, mountains differ greatly in position, some being\r\nsituated in even and level plains, while others are found in broken and\r\nelevated regions, and others again seem to be piled up, one mountain\r\nupon another. The wise miner does not mine in mountains which are\r\nsituated on open plains, neither does he dig in those which are placed\r\non the summits of mountainous regions, unless by some chance the veins\r\nin those mountains have been denuded of their surface covering, and\r\nabounding in metals and other products, are exposed plainly to his\r\nnotice,--for with regard to what I have already said more than once, and\r\nthough I never repeat it again, I wish to emphasize this exception as to\r\nthe localities which should not be selected. All districts do not\r\npossess a great number of mountains crowded together; some have but one,\r\nothers two, others three, or perhaps a few more. In some places there\r\nare plains lying between them; in others the mountains are joined\r\ntogether or separated only by narrow valleys. The miner should not dig\r\nin those solitary mountains, dispersed through the plains and open\r\nregions, but only in those which are connected and joined with others.\r\nThen again, since mountains differ in size, some being very large,\r\nothers of medium height, and others more like hills than mountains, the\r\nminer rarely digs in the largest or the smallest of them, but generally\r\nonly in those of medium size. Moreover, mountains have a great variety\r\nof shapes; for with some the slopes rise gradually, while others, on the\r\ncontrary, are all precipitous; in some others the slopes are gradual on\r\none side, and on the other sides precipitous; some are drawn out in\r\nlength; some are gently curved; others assume different shapes. But the\r\nminer may dig in all parts of them, except where there are precipices,\r\nand he should not neglect even these latter if metallic veins are\r\nexposed before his eyes. There are just as great differences in hills as\r\nthere are in mountains, yet the miner does not dig except in those\r\nsituated in mountainous districts, and even very rarely in those. It is\r\nhowever very little to be wondered at that the hill in the Island of\r\nLemnos was excavated, for the whole is of a reddish-yellow colour, which\r\nfurnishes for the inhabitants that valuable clay so especially\r\nbeneficial to mankind[10]. In like manner, other hills are excavated if\r\nchalk or other varieties of earth are exposed, but these are not\r\nprospected for.\r\n\r\nThere are likewise many varieties of valleys and plains. One kind is\r\nenclosed on the sides with its outlet and entrance open; another has\r\neither its entrance or its outlet open and the rest of it is closed in;\r\nboth of these are properly called valleys. There is a third variety\r\nwhich is surrounded on all sides by mountains, and these are called\r\n_convalles_. Some valleys again, have recesses, and others have none;\r\none is wide, another narrow; one is long, another short; yet another\r\nkind is not higher than the neighbouring plain, and others are lower\r\nthan the surrounding flat country. But the miner does not dig in those\r\nsurrounded on all sides by mountains, nor in those that are open, unless\r\nthere be a low plain close at hand, or unless a vein of metal descending\r\nfrom the mountains should extend into the valley. Plains differ from one\r\nanother, one being situated at low elevation, and others higher, one\r\nbeing level and another with a slight incline. The miner should never\r\nexcavate the low-lying plain, nor one which is perfectly level, unless\r\nit be in some mountain, and rarely should he mine in the other kinds of\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the conditions of the locality the miner should not\r\ncontemplate mining without considering whether the place be covered with\r\ntrees or is bare. If it be a wooded place, he who digs there has this\r\nadvantage, besides others, that there will be an abundant supply of wood\r\nfor his underground timbering, his machinery, buildings, smelting, and\r\nother necessities. If there is no forest he should not mine there unless\r\nthere is a river near, by which he can carry down the timber. Yet\r\nwherever there is a hope that pure gold or gems may be found, the ground\r\ncan be turned up, even though there is no forest, because the gems need\r\nonly to be polished and the gold to be purified. Therefore the\r\ninhabitants of hot regions obtain these substances from rough and sandy\r\nplaces, where sometimes there are not even shrubs, much less woods.\r\n\r\nThe miner should next consider the locality, as to whether it has a\r\nperpetual supply of running water, or whether it is always devoid of\r\nwater except when a torrent supplied by rains flows down from the\r\nsummits of the mountains. The place that Nature has provided with a\r\nriver or stream can be made serviceable for many things; for water will\r\nnever be wanting and can be carried through wooden pipes to baths in\r\ndwelling-houses; it may be carried to the works, where the metals are\r\nsmelted; and finally, if the conditions of the place will allow it, the\r\nwater can be diverted into the tunnels, so that it may turn the\r\nunderground machinery. Yet on the other hand, to convey a constant\r\nsupply of water by artificial means to mines where Nature has denied it\r\naccess, or to convey the ore to the stream, increases the expense\r\ngreatly, in proportion to the distance the mines are away from the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nThe miner also should consider whether the roads from the neighbouring\r\nregions to the mines are good or bad, short or long. For since a region\r\nwhich is abundant in mining products very often yields no agricultural\r\nproduce, and the necessaries of life for the workmen and others must all\r\nbe imported, a bad and long road occasions much loss and trouble with\r\nporters and carriers, and this increases the cost of goods brought in,\r\nwhich, therefore, must be sold at high prices. This injures not so much\r\nthe workmen as the masters; since on account of the high price of goods,\r\nthe workmen are not content with the wages customary for their labour,\r\nnor can they be, and they ask higher pay from the owners. And if the\r\nowners refuse, the men will not work any longer in the mines but will go\r\nelsewhere. Although districts which yield metals and other mineral\r\nproducts are generally healthy, because, being often situated on high\r\nand lofty ground, they are fanned by every wind, yet sometimes they are\r\nunhealthy, as has been related in my other book, which is called \"_De\r\nNatura Eorum Quae Effluunt ex Terra_.\" Therefore, a wise miner does not\r\nmine in such places, even if they are very productive, when he perceives\r\nunmistakable signs of pestilence. For if a man mines in an unhealthy\r\nregion he may be alive one hour and dead the next.\r\n\r\nThen, the miner should make careful and thorough investigation\r\nconcerning the lord of the locality, whether he be a just and good man\r\nor a tyrant, for the latter oppresses men by force of his authority, and\r\nseizes their possessions for himself; but the former governs justly and\r\nlawfully and serves the common good. The miner should not start mining\r\noperations in a district which is oppressed by a tyrant, but should\r\ncarefully consider if in the vicinity there is any other locality\r\nsuitable for mining and make up his mind if the overlord there be\r\nfriendly or inimical. If he be inimical the mine will be rendered unsafe\r\nthrough hostile attacks, in one of which all of the gold or silver, or\r\nother mineral products, laboriously collected with much cost, will be\r\ntaken away from the owner and his workmen will be struck with terror;\r\novercome by fear, they will hastily fly, to free themselves from the\r\ndanger to which they are exposed. In this case, not only are the\r\nfortunes of the miner in the greatest peril but his very life is in\r\njeopardy, for which reason he should not mine in such places.\r\n\r\nSince several miners usually come to mine the veins in one locality, a\r\nsettlement generally springs up, for the miner who began first cannot\r\nkeep it exclusively for himself. The _Bergmeister_ gives permits to some\r\nto mine the superior and some the inferior parts of the veins; to some\r\nhe gives the cross veins, to others the inclined veins. If the man who\r\nfirst starts work finds the vein to be metal-bearing or yielding other\r\nmining products, it will not be to his advantage to cease work because\r\nthe neighbourhood may be evil, but he will guard and defend his rights\r\nboth by arms and by the law. When the _Bergmeister_[11] delimits the\r\nboundaries of each owner, it is the duty of a good miner to keep within\r\nhis bounds, and of a prudent one to repel encroachments of his\r\nneighbours by the help of the law. But this is enough about the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe miner should try to obtain a mine, to which access is not difficult,\r\nin a mountainous region, gently sloping, wooded, healthy, safe, and not\r\nfar distant from a river or stream by means of which he may convey his\r\nmining products to be washed and smelted. This indeed, is the best\r\nposition. As for the others, the nearer they approximate to this\r\nposition the better they are; the further removed, the worse.\r\n\r\nNow I will discuss that kind of minerals for which it is not necessary\r\nto dig, because the force of water carries them out of the veins. Of\r\nthese there are two kinds, minerals--and their fragments[12]--and\r\njuices. When there are springs at the outcrop of the veins from which,\r\nas I have already said, the above-mentioned products are emitted, the\r\nminer should consider these first, to see whether there are metals or\r\ngems mixed with the sand, or whether the waters discharged are filled\r\nwith juices. In case metals or gems have settled in the pool of the\r\nspring, not only should the sand from it be washed, but also that from\r\nthe streams which flow from these springs, and even from the river\r\nitself into which they again discharge. If the springs discharge water\r\ncontaining some juice, this also should be collected; the further such a\r\nstream has flowed from the source, the more it receives plain water and\r\nthe more diluted does it become, and so much the more deficient in\r\nstrength. If the stream receives no water of another kind, or scarcely\r\nany, not only the rivers, but likewise the lakes which receive these\r\nwaters, are of the same nature as the springs, and serve the same uses;\r\nof this kind is the lake which the Hebrews call the Dead Sea, and which\r\nis quite full of bituminous fluids[13]. But I must return to the subject\r\nof the sands.\r\n\r\nSprings may discharge their waters into a sea, a lake, a marsh, a river,\r\nor a stream; but the sand of the sea-shore is rarely washed, for\r\nalthough the water flowing down from the springs into the sea carries\r\nsome metals or gems with it, yet these substances can scarcely ever be\r\nreclaimed, because they are dispersed through the immense body of waters\r\nand mixed up with other sand, and scattered far and wide in different\r\ndirections, or they sink down into the depths of the sea. For the same\r\nreasons, the sands of lakes can very rarely be washed successfully, even\r\nthough the streams rising from the mountains pour their whole volume of\r\nwater into them. The particles of metals and gems from the springs are\r\nvery rarely carried into the marshes, which are generally in level and\r\nopen places. Therefore, the miner, in the first place, washes the sand\r\nof the spring, then of the stream which flows from it, then finally,\r\nthat of the river into which the stream discharges. It is not worth the\r\ntrouble to wash the sands of a large river which is on a level plain at\r\na distance from the mountains. Where several springs carrying metals\r\ndischarge their waters into one river, there is more hope of productive\r\nresults from washing. The miner does not neglect even the sands of the\r\nstreams in which excavated ores have been washed.\r\n\r\nThe waters of springs taste according to the juice they contain, and\r\nthey differ greatly in this respect. There are six kinds of these tastes\r\nwhich the worker[14] especially observes and examines; there is the\r\nsalty kind, which shows that salt may be obtained by evaporation; the\r\nnitrous, which indicates soda; the aluminous kind, which indicates alum;\r\nthe vitrioline, which indicates vitriol; the sulphurous kind, which\r\nindicates sulphur; and as for the bituminous juice, out of which bitumen\r\nis melted down, the colour itself proclaims it to the worker who is\r\nevaporating it. The sea-water however, is similar to that of salt\r\nsprings, and may be drawn into low-lying pits, and, evaporated by the\r\nheat of the sun, changes of itself into salt; similarly the water of\r\nsome salt-lakes turns to salt when dried by the heat of summer.\r\nTherefore an industrious and diligent man observes and makes use of\r\nthese things and thus contributes something to the common welfare.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the sea condenses the liquid bitumen which flows into it\r\nfrom hidden springs, into amber and jet, as I have described already in\r\nmy books \"_De Subterraneorum Ortu et Causis_\"[15]. The sea, with certain\r\ndirections of the wind, throws both these substances on shore, and for\r\nthis reason the search for amber demands as much care as does that for\r\ncoral.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is necessary that those who wash the sand or evaporate the\r\nwater from the springs, should be careful to learn the nature of the\r\nlocality, its roads, its salubrity, its overlord, and the neighbours,\r\nlest on account of difficulties in the conduct of their business they\r\nbecome either impoverished by exhaustive expenditure, or their goods and\r\nlives are imperilled. But enough about this.\r\n\r\nThe miner, after he has selected out of many places one particular spot\r\nadapted by Nature for mining, bestows much labour and attention on the\r\nveins. These have either been stripped bare of their covering by chance\r\nand thus lie exposed to our view, or lying deeply hidden and concealed\r\nthey are found after close search; the latter is more usual, the former\r\nmore rarely happens, and both of these occurrences must be explained.\r\nThere is more than one force which can lay bare the veins unaided by the\r\nindustry or toil of man; since either a torrent might strip off the\r\nsurface, which happened in the case of the silver mines of Freiberg\r\n(concerning which I have written in Book I. of my work \"_De Veteribus\r\net Novis Metallis_\")[16]; or they may be exposed through the force of\r\nthe wind, when it uproots and destroys the trees which have grown over\r\nthe veins; or by the breaking away of the rocks; or by long-continued\r\nheavy rains tearing away the mountain; or by an earthquake; or by a\r\nlightning flash; or by a snowslide; or by the violence of the winds: \"Of\r\nsuch a nature are the rocks hurled down from the mountains by the force\r\nof the winds aided by the ravages of time.\" Or the plough may uncover\r\nthe veins, for Justin relates in his history that nuggets of gold had\r\nbeen turned up in Galicia by the plough; or this may occur through a\r\nfire in the forest, as Diodorus Siculus tells us happened in the silver\r\nmines in Spain; and that saying of Posidonius is appropriate enough:\r\n\"The earth violently moved by the fires consuming the forest sends forth\r\nnew products, namely, gold and silver.\"[17] And indeed, Lucretius has\r\nexplained the same thing more fully in the following lines: \"Copper and\r\ngold and iron were discovered, and at the same time weighty silver and\r\nthe substance of lead, when fire had burned up vast forests on the great\r\nhills, either by a discharge of heaven's lightning, or else because,\r\nwhen men were waging war with one another, forest fires had carried fire\r\namong the enemy in order to strike terror to them, or because, attracted\r\nby the goodness of the soil, they wished to clear rich fields and bring\r\nthe country into pasture, or else to destroy wild beasts and enrich\r\nthemselves with the game; for hunting with pitfalls and with fire came\r\ninto use before the practice of enclosing the wood with toils and\r\nrousing the game with dogs. Whatever the fact is, from whatever cause\r\nthe heat of flame had swallowed up the forests with a frightful\r\ncrackling from their very roots, and had thoroughly baked the earth with\r\nfire, there would run from the boiling veins and collect into the\r\nhollows of the grounds a stream of silver and gold, as well as of copper\r\nand lead.\"[18] But yet the poet considers that the veins are not laid\r\nbare in the first instance so much by this kind of fire, but rather that\r\nall mining had its origin in this. And lastly, some other force may by\r\nchance disclose the veins, for a horse, if this tale can be believed,\r\ndisclosed the lead veins at Goslar by a blow from his hoof[19]. By such\r\nmethods as these does fortune disclose the veins to us.\r\n\r\nBut by skill we can also investigate hidden and concealed veins, by\r\nobserving in the first place the bubbling waters of springs, which\r\ncannot be very far distant from the veins because the source of the\r\nwater is from them; secondly, by examining the fragments of the veins\r\nwhich the torrents break off from the earth, for after a long time some\r\nof these fragments are again buried in the ground. Fragments of this\r\nkind lying about on the ground, if they are rubbed smooth, are a long\r\ndistance from the veins, because the torrent, which broke them from the\r\nvein, polished them while it rolled them a long distance; but if they\r\nare fixed in the ground, or if they are rough, they are nearer to the\r\nveins. The soil also should be considered, for this is often the cause\r\nof veins being buried more or less deeply under the earth; in this case\r\nthe fragments protrude more or less widely apart, and miners are wont to\r\ncall the veins discovered in this manner \"_fragmenta_.\"[20]\r\n\r\nFurther, we search for the veins by observing the hoar-frosts, which\r\nwhiten all herbage except that growing over the veins, because the veins\r\nemit a warm and dry exhalation which hinders the freezing of the\r\nmoisture, for which reason such plants appear rather wet than whitened\r\nby the frost. This may be observed in all cold places before the grass\r\nhas grown to its full size, as in the months of April and May; or when\r\nthe late crop of hay, which is called the _cordum_, is cut with scythes\r\nin the month of September. Therefore in places where the grass has a\r\ndampness that is not congealed into frost, there is a vein beneath; also\r\nif the exhalation be excessively hot, the soil will produce only small\r\nand pale-coloured plants. Lastly, there are trees whose foliage in\r\nspring-time has a bluish or leaden tint, the upper branches more\r\nespecially being tinged with black or with any other unnatural colour,\r\nthe trunks cleft in two, and the branches black or discoloured. These\r\nphenomena are caused by the intensely hot and dry exhalations which do\r\nnot spare even the roots, but scorching them, render the trees sickly;\r\nwherefore the wind will more frequently uproot trees of this kind than\r\nany others. Verily the veins do emit this exhalation. Therefore, in a\r\nplace where there is a multitude of trees, if a long row of them at an\r\nunusual time lose their verdure and become black or discoloured, and\r\nfrequently fall by the violence of the wind, beneath this spot there is\r\na vein. Likewise along a course where a vein extends, there grows a\r\ncertain herb or fungus which is absent from the adjacent space, or\r\nsometimes even from the neighbourhood of the veins. By these signs of\r\nNature a vein can be discovered.\r\n\r\nThere are many great contentions between miners concerning the forked\r\ntwig[21], for some say that it is of the greatest use in discovering\r\nveins, and others deny it. Some of those who manipulate and use the\r\ntwig, first cut a fork from a hazel bush with a knife, for this bush\r\nthey consider more efficacious than any other for revealing the veins,\r\nespecially if the hazel bush grows above a vein. Others use a different\r\nkind of twig for each metal, when they are seeking to discover the\r\nveins, for they employ hazel twigs for veins of silver; ash twigs for\r\ncopper; pitch pine for lead and especially tin, and rods made of iron\r\nand steel for gold. All alike grasp the forks of the twig with their\r\nhands, clenching their fists, it being necessary that the clenched\r\nfingers should be held toward the sky in order that the twig should be\r\nraised at that end where the two branches meet. Then they wander hither\r\nand thither at random through mountainous regions. It is said that the\r\nmoment they place their feet on a vein the twig immediately turns and\r\ntwists, and so by its action discloses the vein; when they move their\r\nfeet again and go away from that spot the twig becomes once more\r\nimmobile.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, they assert, the movement of the twig is caused by the\r\npower of the veins, and sometimes this is so great that the branches of\r\ntrees growing near a vein are deflected toward it. On the other hand,\r\nthose who say that the twig is of no use to good and serious men, also\r\ndeny that the motion is due to the power of the veins, because the twigs\r\nwill not move for everybody, but only for those who employ incantations\r\nand craft. Moreover, they deny the power of a vein to draw to itself the\r\nbranches of trees, but they say that the warm and dry exhalations cause\r\nthese contortions. Those who advocate the use of the twig make this\r\nreply to these objections: when one of the miners or some other person\r\nholds the twig in his hands, and it is not turned by the force of a\r\nvein, this is due to some peculiarity of the individual, which hinders\r\nand impedes the power of the vein, for since the power of the vein in\r\nturning and twisting the twig may be not unlike that of a magnet\r\nattracting and drawing iron toward itself, this hidden quality of a man\r\nweakens and breaks the force, just the same as garlic weakens and\r\novercomes the strength of a magnet. For a magnet smeared with garlic\r\njuice cannot attract iron; nor does it attract the latter when rusty.\r\nFurther, concerning the handling of the twig, they warn us that we\r\nshould not press the fingers together too lightly, nor clench them too\r\nfirmly, for if the twig is held lightly they say that it will fall\r\nbefore the force of the vein can turn it; if however, it is grasped too\r\nfirmly the force of the hands resists the force of the veins and\r\ncounteracts it. Therefore, they consider that five things are necessary\r\nto insure that the twig shall serve its purpose: of these the first is\r\nthe size of the twig, for the force of the veins cannot turn too large a\r\nstick; secondly, there is the shape of the twig, which must be forked or\r\nthe vein cannot turn it; thirdly, the power of the vein which has the\r\nnature to turn it; fourthly, the manipulation of the twig; fifthly, the\r\nabsence of impeding peculiarities. These advocates of the twig sum up\r\ntheir conclusions as follows: if the rod does not move for everybody, it\r\nis due to unskilled manipulation or to the impeding peculiarities of the\r\nman which oppose and resist the force of the veins, as we said above,\r\nand those who search for veins by means of the twig need not necessarily\r\nmake incantations, but it is sufficient that they handle it suitably and\r\nare devoid of impeding power; therefore, the twig may be of use to good\r\nand serious men in discovering veins. With regard to deflection of\r\nbranches of trees they say nothing and adhere to their opinion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 40 (Divining Rod): A--Twig. B--Trench.]\r\n\r\nSince this matter remains in dispute and causes much dissention amongst\r\nminers, I consider it ought to be examined on its own merits. The\r\nwizards, who also make use of rings, mirrors and crystals, seek for\r\nveins with a divining rod shaped like a fork; but its shape makes no\r\ndifference in the matter,--it might be straight or of some other\r\nform--for it is not the form of the twig that matters, but the wizard's\r\nincantations which it would not become me to repeat, neither do I wish\r\nto do so. The Ancients, by means of the divining rod, not only procured\r\nthose things necessary for a livelihood or for luxury, but they were\r\nalso able to alter the forms of things by it; as when the magicians\r\nchanged the rods of the Egyptians into serpents, as the writings of the\r\nHebrews relate[22]; and as in Homer, Minerva with a divining rod turned\r\nthe aged Ulysses suddenly into a youth, and then restored him back again\r\nto old age; Circe also changed Ulysses' companions into beasts, but\r\nafterward gave them back again their human form[23]; moreover by his\r\nrod, which was called \"Caduceus,\" Mercury gave sleep to watchmen and\r\nawoke slumberers[24]. Therefore it seems that the divining rod passed to\r\nthe mines from its impure origin with the magicians. Then when good men\r\nshrank with horror from the incantations and rejected them, the twig was\r\nretained by the unsophisticated common miners, and in searching for new\r\nveins some traces of these ancient usages remain.\r\n\r\nBut since truly the twigs of the miners do move, albeit they do not\r\ngenerally use incantations, some say this movement is caused by the\r\npower of the veins, others say that it depends on the manipulation, and\r\nstill others think that the movement is due to both these causes. But,\r\nin truth, all those objects which are endowed with the power of\r\nattraction do not twist things in circles, but attract them directly to\r\nthemselves; for instance, the magnet does not turn the iron, but draws\r\nit directly to itself, and amber rubbed until it is warm does not bend\r\nstraws about, but simply draws them to itself. If the power of the veins\r\nwere of a similar nature to that of the magnet and the amber, the twig\r\nwould not so much twist as move once only, in a semi-circle, and be\r\ndrawn directly to the vein, and unless the strength of the man who holds\r\nthe twig were to resist and oppose the force of the vein, the twig would\r\nbe brought to the ground; wherefore, since this is not the case, it must\r\nnecessarily follow that the manipulation is the cause of the twig's\r\ntwisting motion. It is a conspicuous fact that these cunning\r\nmanipulators do not use a straight twig, but a forked one cut from a\r\nhazel bush, or from some other wood equally flexible, so that if it be\r\nheld in the hands, as they are accustomed to hold it, it turns in a\r\ncircle for any man wherever he stands. Nor is it strange that the twig\r\ndoes not turn when held by the inexperienced, because they either grasp\r\nthe forks of the twig too tightly or hold them too loosely.\r\nNevertheless, these things give rise to the faith among common miners\r\nthat veins are discovered by the use of twigs, because whilst using\r\nthese they do accidentally discover some; but it more often happens that\r\nthey lose their labour, and although they might discover a vein, they\r\nbecome none the less exhausted in digging useless trenches than do the\r\nminers who prospect in an unfortunate locality. Therefore a miner, since\r\nwe think he ought to be a good and serious man, should not make use of\r\nan enchanted twig, because if he is prudent and skilled in the natural\r\nsigns, he understands that a forked stick is of no use to him, for as I\r\nhave said before, there are the natural indications of the veins which\r\nhe can see for himself without the help of twigs. So if Nature or chance\r\nshould indicate a locality suitable for mining, the miner should dig his\r\ntrenches there; if no vein appears he must dig numerous trenches until\r\nhe discovers an outcrop of a vein.\r\n\r\nA _vena dilatata_ is rarely discovered by men's labour, but usually some\r\nforce or other reveals it, or sometimes it is discovered by a shaft or a\r\ntunnel on a _vena profunda_[25].\r\n\r\nThe veins after they have been discovered, and likewise the shafts and\r\ntunnels, have names given them, either from their discoverers, as in the\r\ncase at Annaberg of the vein called \"Koelergang,\" because a charcoal\r\nburner discovered it; or from their owners, as the Geyer, in\r\nJoachimsthal, because part of the same belonged to Geyer; or from their\r\nproducts, as the \"Pleygang\" from lead, or the \"Bissmutisch\" at\r\nSchneeberg from bismuth[26]; or from some other circumstances, such as\r\nthe rich alluvials from the torrent by which they were laid bare in the\r\nvalley of Joachim. More often the first discoverers give the names\r\neither of persons, as those of German Kaiser, Apollo, Janus; or the name\r\nof an animal, as that of lion, bear, ram, or cow; or of things\r\ninanimate, as \"silver chest\" or \"ox stalls\"; or of something ridiculous,\r\nas \"glutton's nightshade\"; or finally, for the sake of a good omen, they\r\ncall it after the Deity. In ancient times they followed the same custom\r\nand gave names to the veins, shafts and tunnels, as we read in Pliny:\r\n\"It is wonderful that the shafts begun by Hannibal in Spain are still\r\nworked, their names being derived from their discoverers. One of these\r\nat the present day, called Baebelo, furnished Hannibal with three\r\nhundred pounds weight (of silver) per day.\"[27]\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Xenophon. Essay on the Revenues of Athens, IV., 14.\r\n\r\n\"But we cannot but feel surprised that the State, when it sees many\r\nprivate individuals enriching themselves from its resources, does not\r\nimitate their proceedings; for we heard long ago, indeed, at least such\r\nof us as attended to these matters, that Nicias the son of Niceratus\r\nkept a thousand men employed in the silver mines, whom he let on hire to\r\nSosias of Thrace on condition that he should give him for each an obolus\r\na day, free of all charges; and this number he always supplied\r\nundiminished.\" (See also Note 6). An obolus a day each, would be about\r\n23 oz. Troy of silver per day for the whole number. In modern value this\r\nwould, of course, be but about 50s. per day, but in purchasing power the\r\nvalue would probably be 100 to 1 (see Note on p. 28). Nicias was\r\nestimated to have a fortune of 100 talents--about 83,700 Troy ounces of\r\nsilver, and was one of the wealthiest of the Athenians. (Plutarch, Life\r\nof Nicias).\r\n\r\n[2] Xenophon. _Oeconomicus_ XII., 20. \"'I approve,' said Ischomachus,\r\n'of the barbarian's answer to the King who found a good horse, and,\r\nwishing to fatten it as soon as possible, asked a man with a good\r\nreputation for horsemanship what would do it?' The man's reply was: 'Its\r\nmaster's eye.'\"\r\n\r\n[3] _Praefectus Metallorum._ In Saxony this official was styled the\r\n_Berghauptmann_. For further information see page 94 and note on page\r\n78.\r\n\r\n[4] This statement is either based upon Apollodorus, whom Agricola does\r\nnot mention among his authorities, or on Strabo, whom he does so\r\ninclude. The former in his work on Mythology makes such a statement, for\r\nwhich Strabo (XIV., 5, 28) takes him to task as follows: \"With this vain\r\nintention they collected the stories related by the Scepsian\r\n(Demetrius), and taken from Callisthenes and other writers, who did not\r\nclear them from false notions respecting the Halizones; for example,\r\nthat the wealth of Tantalus and of the Pelopidae was derived, it is\r\nsaid, from the mines about Phrygia and Sipylus; that of Cadmus from the\r\nmines of Thrace and Mount Pangaeum; that of Priam from the gold mines of\r\nAstyra, near Abydos (of which at present there are small remains, yet\r\nthere is a large quantity of matter ejected, and the excavations are\r\nproofs of former workings); that of Midas from the mines about Mount\r\nBermium; that of Gyges, Alyattes, and Croesus, from the mines in Lydia\r\nand the small deserted city between Atarneus and Pergamum, where are the\r\nsites of exhausted mines.\" (Hamilton's Trans., Vol. III., p. 66).\r\n\r\nIn adopting this view, Agricola apparently applied a wonderful realism\r\nto some Greek mythology--for instance, in the legend of Midas, which\r\ntells of that king being rewarded by the god Dionysus, who granted his\r\nrequest that all he touched might turn to gold; but the inconvenience of\r\nthe gift drove him to pray for relief, which he obtained by bathing in\r\nthe Pactolus, the sands of which thereupon became highly auriferous.\r\nPriam was, of course, King of Troy, but Homer does not exhibit him as a\r\nmine-owner. Gyges, Alyattes, and Croesus were successively Kings of\r\nLydia, from 687 to 546 B.C., and were no doubt possessed of great\r\ntreasure in gold. Some few years ago we had occasion to inquire into\r\nextensive old workings locally reputed to be Croesus' mines, at a place\r\nsome distance north of Smyrna, which would correspond very closely to\r\nthe locality here mentioned.\r\n\r\n[5] There can be no doubt that the Carthaginians worked the mines of\r\nSpain on an extensive scale for a very long period anterior to their\r\nconquest by the Romans, but whether the mines were worked by the\r\nGovernment or not we are unable to find any evidence.\r\n\r\n[6] The silver mines of Mt. Laurion formed the economic mainstay of\r\nAthens for the three centuries during which the State had the ascendency\r\nin Greece, and there can be no doubt that the dominance of Athens and\r\nits position as a sea-power were directly due to the revenues from the\r\nmines. The first working of the mines is shrouded in mystery. The\r\nscarcity of silver in the time of Solon (638-598 B.C.) would not\r\nindicate any very considerable output at that time. According to\r\nXenophon (Essay on Revenue of Athens, IV., 2), written about 355 B.C.,\r\n\"they were wrought in very ancient times.\" The first definite discussion\r\nof the mines in Greek record begins about 500 B.C., for about that time\r\nthe royalties began to figure in the Athenian Budget (Aristotle,\r\nConstitution of Athens, 47). There can be no doubt that the mines\r\nreached great prosperity prior to the Persian invasion. In the year 484\r\nB.C. the mines returned 100 Talents (about 83,700 oz. Troy) to the\r\nTreasury, and this, on the advice of Themistocles, was devoted to the\r\nconstruction of the fleet which conquered the Persians at Salamis (480\r\nB.C.). The mines were much interfered with by the Spartan invasions from\r\n431 to 425 B.C., and again by their occupation in 413 B.C.; and by 355\r\nB.C., when Xenophon wrote the \"Revenues,\" exploitation had fallen to a\r\nlow ebb, for which he proposes the remedies noted by Agricola on p. 28.\r\nBy the end of the 4th Century, B.C., the mines had again reached\r\nconsiderable prosperity, as is evidenced by Demosthenes' orations\r\nagainst Pantaenetus and against Phaenippus, and by Lycurgus' prosecution\r\nof Diphilos for robbing the supporting pillars. The domination of the\r\nMacedonians under Philip and Alexander at the end of the 4th and\r\nbeginning of the 3rd Centuries B.C., however, so flooded Greece with\r\nmoney from the mines of Thrace, that this probably interfered with\r\nLaurion, at this time, in any event, began the decadence of these mines.\r\nSynchronous also was the decadence of Athens, and, but for fitful\r\ndisplays, the State was not able to maintain even its own independence,\r\nnot to mention its position as a dominant State. Finally, Strabo,\r\nwriting about 30 B.C. gives the epitaph of every mining\r\ndistrict--reworking the dumps. He says (IX., 1, 23): \"The silver mines\r\nin Attica were at first of importance, but are now exhausted. The\r\nworkmen, when the mines yielded a bad return to their labour, committed\r\nto the furnace the old refuse and scoria, and hence obtained very pure\r\nsilver, for the former workmen had carried on the process in the furnace\r\nunskilfully.\"\r\n\r\nSince 1860, the mines have been worked with some success by a French\r\nCompany, thus carrying the mining history of this district over a period\r\nof twenty-seven centuries. The most excellent of many memoirs upon the\r\nmines at Laurion, not only for its critical, historical, and\r\narchaeological value, but also because of its author's great insight into\r\nmining and metallurgy, is that of Edouard Ardaillon (_Les Mines du\r\nLaurion dans l'Antiquite_, Paris, 1897). We have relied considerably\r\nupon this careful study for the following notes, and would refer others\r\nto it for a short bibliography on the subject. We would mention in\r\npassing that Augustus Boeckh's \"Silver Mines of Laurion,\" which is\r\nincorporated with his \"Public Economy of Athens\" (English Translation by\r\nLewis, London, 1842) has been too much relied upon by English students.\r\nIt is no doubt the product of one acquainted with written history, but\r\nwithout any special knowledge of the industry and it is based on no\r\nantiquarian research. The Mt. Laurion mining district is located near\r\nthe southern end of the Attic Peninsula. The deposits are silver-lead,\r\nand they occur along the contact between approximately horizontal\r\nlimestones and slates. There are two principal beds of each, thus\r\nforming three principal contacts. The most metalliferous of these\r\ncontacts are those at the base of the slates, the lowest contact of the\r\nseries being the richest. The ore-bodies were most irregular, varying\r\ngreatly in size, from a thin seam between schist planes, to very large\r\nbodies containing as much as 200,000 cubic metres. The ores are\r\nargentiferous galena, accompanied by considerable amounts of blende and\r\npyrites, all oxidized near the surface. The ores worked by the Ancients\r\nappear to have been fairly rich in lead, for the discards worked in\r\nrecent years by the French Company, and the pillars left behind, ran 8%\r\nto 10% lead. The ratio of silver was from 40 to 90 ounces per ton of\r\nlead. The upper contacts were exposed by erosion and could be entered by\r\ntunnels, but the lowest and most prolific contact line was only to be\r\nreached by shafts. The shafts were ordinarily from four to six feet\r\nsquare, and were undoubtedly cut by hammer and chisel; they were as much\r\nas 380 feet deep. In some cases long inclines for travelling roads join\r\nthe vertical shafts in depth. The drives, whether tunnels or from\r\nshafts, were not level, but followed every caprice of the sinuous\r\ncontact. They were from two to two and a half feet wide, often driven in\r\nparallels with cross-cuts between, in order to exploit every corner of\r\nthe contact. The stoping of ore-bodies discovered was undertaken quite\r\nsystematically, the methods depending in the main on the shape of the\r\nore-body. If the body was large, its dimensions were first determined by\r\ndrives, crosscuts, rises, and winzes, as the case might require. If the\r\nore was mainly overhead it was overhand-stoped, and the stopes filled as\r\nwork progressed, inclined winzes being occasionally driven from the\r\nstopes to the original entry drives. If the ore was mainly below, it was\r\nunderhand-stoped, pillars being left if necessary--such pillars in some\r\ncases being thirty feet high. They also employed timber and artificial\r\npillars. The mines were practically dry. There is little evidence of\r\nbreaking by fire. The ore was hand-sorted underground and carried out by\r\nthe slaves, and in some cases apparently the windlass was used. It was\r\ntreated by grinding in mills and concentrating upon a sort of buddle.\r\nThese concentrates--mostly galena--were smelted in low furnaces and the\r\nlead was subsequently cupelled. Further details of metallurgical methods\r\nwill be found in Notes on p. 391 and p. 465, on metallurgical subjects.\r\n\r\nThe mines were worked by slaves. Even the overseers were at times\r\napparently slaves, for we find (Xenophon, _Memorabilia_, II., 5) that\r\nNicias paid a whole talent for a good overseer. A talent would be about\r\n837 Troy ounces of silver. As wages of skilled labour were about two and\r\none half pennyweights of silver per diem, and a family income of 100\r\nounces of silver per annum was affluence, the ratio of purchasing power\r\nof Attic coinage to modern would be about 100 to 1. Therefore this mine\r\nmanager was worth in modern value roughly L8,000. The mines were the\r\nproperty of the State. The areas were defined by vertical boundaries,\r\nand were let on lease for definite periods for a fixed annual rent. More\r\nample discussion of the law will be found on p. 83.\r\n\r\n[7] Xenophon. (Essay on The Revenues, IV., 30). \"I think, however, that\r\nI am able to give some advice with regard to this difficulty also (the\r\nrisk of opening new mines), and to show how new operations may be\r\nconducted with the greatest safety. There are ten tribes at Athens, and\r\nif to each of these the State should assign an equal number of slaves,\r\nand the tribes should all make new cuttings, sharing their fortunes in\r\ncommon, then if but one tribe should make any useful discovery it would\r\npoint out something profitable to the whole; but if two, three, or four,\r\nor half the number should make some discovery, it is plain that the\r\nworks would be more profitable in proportion, and that they should all\r\nfail is contrary to all experience in past times.\" (Watson's Trans. p.\r\n258).\r\n\r\n[8] Agricola here refers to the proposal of Xenophon for the State to\r\ncollect slaves and hire them to work the mines of Laurion. There is no\r\nevidence that this recommendation was ever carried out.\r\n\r\n[9] _Partes._ Agricola, p. 89-91, describes in detail the organization\r\nand management of these share companies. See Note 8, p. 90.\r\n\r\n[10] This island in the northern AEgean Sea has produced this \"earth\"\r\nfrom before Theophrastus' time (372-287 B.C.) down to the present day.\r\nAccording to Dana (System of Mineralogy 689), it is cimolite, a hydrous\r\nsilicate of aluminium. The Ancients distinguished two kinds,--one sort\r\nused as a pigment, and the other for medicinal purposes. This latter was\r\ndug with great ceremony at a certain time of the year, moulded into\r\ncubes, and stamped with a goat,--the symbol of Diana. It thus became\r\nknown as _terra sigillata_, and was an article of apothecary commerce\r\ndown to the last century. It is described by Galen (XII., 12),\r\nDioscorides (V., 63), and Pliny (XXXV., 14), as a remedy for ulcers and\r\nsnake bites.\r\n\r\n[11] _Magister Metallorum_. See Note 1, p. 78, for the reasons of the\r\nadoption of the term _Bergmeister_ and page 95 for details of his\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n[12] _Ramenta_. \"Particles.\" The author uses this term indifferently for\r\nfragments, particles of mineral, concentrates, gold dust, black tin,\r\netc., in all cases the result of either natural or artificial\r\nconcentration. As in technical English we have no general term for both\r\nnatural and artificial \"concentrates,\" we have rendered it as the\r\ncontext seemed to demand.\r\n\r\n[13] A certain amount of bitumen does float ashore in the Dead Sea; the\r\norigin of it is, however, uncertain. Strabo (XVI., 2, 42), Pliny (V., 15\r\nand 16), and Josephus (IV., 8), all mention this fact. The lake for this\r\nreason is often referred to by the ancient writers by the name\r\n_Asphaltites_.\r\n\r\n[14] _Excoctor_,--literally, \"Smelter\" or \"Metallurgist.\"\r\n\r\n[15] This reference should be to the _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 230),\r\nalthough there is a short reference to the matter in _De Ortu et Causis_\r\n(p. 59). Agricola maintained that not only were jet and amber varieties\r\nof bitumen, but also coal and camphor and obsidian. As jet (_gagates_)\r\nis but a compact variety of coal, the ancient knowledge of this\r\nsubstance has more interest than would otherwise attach to the gem,\r\nespecially as some materials described in this connection were no doubt\r\ncoal. The Greeks often refer to a series of substances which burned,\r\ncontained earth, and which no doubt comprised coal. Such substances are\r\nmentioned by Aristotle (_De Mirabilibus_. 33, 41, 125), Nicander\r\n(_Theriaca_. 37), and others, previous to the 2nd Century B.C., but the\r\nmost ample description is that of Theophrastus (23-28): \"Some of the\r\nmore brittle stones there also are, which become as it were burning\r\ncoals when put into a fire, and continue so a long time; of this kind\r\nare those about Bena, found in mines and washed down by the torrents,\r\nfor they will take fire on burning coals being thrown on them, and will\r\ncontinue burning as long as anyone blows them; afterward they will\r\ndeaden, and may after that be made to burn again. They are therefore of\r\nlong continuance, but their smell is troublesome and disagreeable. That\r\nalso which is called the _spinus_, is found in mines. This stone, cut in\r\npieces and thrown together in a heap, exposed to the sun, burns; and\r\nthat the more, if it be moistened or sprinkled with water (a\r\npyritiferous shale?). But the _Lipara_ stone empties itself, as it were,\r\nin burning, and becomes like the _pumice_, changing at once both its\r\ncolour and density; for before burning it is black, smooth, and compact.\r\nThis stone is found in the Pumices, separately in different places, as\r\nit were, in cells, nowhere continuous to the matter of them. It is said\r\nthat in Melos the pumice is produced in this manner in some other stone,\r\nas this is on the contrary in it; but the stone which the pumice is\r\nfound in is not at all like the _Lipara_ stone which is found in it.\r\nCertain stones there are about Tetras, in Sicily, which is over against\r\nLipara, which empty themselves in the same manner in the fire. And in\r\nthe promontory called Erineas, there is a great quantity of stone like\r\nthat found about Bena, which, when burnt, emits a bituminous smell, and\r\nleaves a matter resembling calcined earth. Those fossil substances that\r\nare called coals, and are broken for use, are earthy; they kindle,\r\nhowever, and burn like wood coals. These are found in Liguria, where\r\nthere also is amber, and in Elis, on the way to Olympia over the\r\nmountains. These are used by smiths.\" (Based on Hill's Trans.).\r\nDioscorides and Pliny add nothing of value to this description.\r\n\r\nAgricola (_De Nat. Fos._, p. 229-230) not only gives various localities\r\nof jet, but also records its relation to coal. As to the latter, he\r\ndescribes several occurrences, and describes the deposits as _vena\r\ndilatata_. Coal had come into considerable use all over Europe,\r\nparticularly in England, long before Agricola's time; the oft-mentioned\r\ncharter to mine sea-coal given to the Monks of Newbottle Abbey, near\r\nPreston, was dated 1210.\r\n\r\nAmber was known to the Greeks by the name _electrum_, but whether the\r\nalloy of the same name took its name from the colour of amber or _vice\r\nversa_ is uncertain. The gum is supposed to be referred to by Homer (Od.\r\nXV. 460), and Thales of Miletus (640-546 B.C.) is supposed to have first\r\ndescribed its power of attraction. It is mentioned by many other Greek\r\nauthors, AEschylus, Euripides, Aristotle, and others. The latter (_De\r\nMirabilibus_, 81) records of the amber islands in the Adriatic, that the\r\ninhabitants tell the story that on these islands amber falls from poplar\r\ntrees. \"This, they say, resembles gum and hardens like stone, the story\r\nof the poets being that after Phaeton was struck by lightning his\r\nsisters turned to poplar trees and shed tears of amber.\" Theophrastus\r\n(53) says: \"Amber is also a stone; it is dug out of the earth in Liguria\r\nand has, like the before-mentioned (lodestone), a power of attraction.\"\r\nPliny (XXXVII., 11) gives a long account of both the substance,\r\nliterature, and mythology on the subject. His view of its origin was:\r\n\"Certainly amber is obtained from the islands of the Northern Ocean, and\r\nis called by the Germans _glaesum_. For this reason the Romans, when\r\nGermanicus Caesar commanded in those parts, called one of them\r\n_Glaesaria_, which was known to the barbarians as _Austeravia_. Amber\r\noriginates from gum discharged by a kind of pine tree, like gum from\r\ncherry and resin from the ordinary pine. It is liquid at first, and\r\nissues abundantly and hardens in time by cold, or by the sea when the\r\nrising tides carry off the fragments from the shores of those islands.\r\nCertainly it is thrown on the coasts, and is so light that it appears to\r\nroll in the water. Our forefathers believed that it was the juice of a\r\ntree, for they called it _succinum_. And that it belongs to a kind of\r\npine tree is proved by the odour of the pine tree which it gives when\r\nrubbed, and that it burns when ignited like a pitch pine torch.\" The\r\nterm amber is of Arabic origin--from _Ambar_--and this term was adopted\r\nby the Greeks after the Christian era. Agricola uses the Latin term\r\n_succinum_ and (_De Nat. Fos._, p. 231-5) disputes the origin from tree\r\ngum, and contends for submarine bitumen springs.\r\n\r\n[16] The statement in _De Veteribus et Novis Metallis_ (p. 394) is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"It came about by chance and accident that the silver mines were\r\ndiscovered at Freiberg in Meissen. By the river Sala, which is not\r\nunknown to Strabo, is Hala, which was once country, but is now a large\r\ntown; the site, at any rate, even from Roman times was famous and\r\nrenowned for its salt springs, for the possession of which the\r\nHermunduri fought with the Chatti. When people carried the salt thence\r\nin wagons, as they now do straight through Meissen (Saxony) into\r\nBohemia--which is lacking in that seasoning to-day no less than\r\nformerly--they saw galena in the wheel tracks, which had been uncovered\r\nby the torrents. This lead ore, since it was similar to that of Goslar,\r\nthey put into their carts and carried to Goslar, for the same carriers\r\nwere accustomed to carry lead from that city. And since much more silver\r\nwas smelted from this galena than from that of Goslar, certain miners\r\nbetook themselves to that part of Meissen in which is now situated\r\nFreiberg, a great and wealthy town; and we are told by consistent\r\nstories and general report that they grew rich out of the mines.\"\r\nAgricola places the discovery of the mines at Freiberg at about 1170.\r\nSee Note 11, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[17] Diodorus Siculus (V., 35). \"These places being covered with woods,\r\nit is said that in ancient times these mountains were set on fire by\r\nshepherds, and continued burning for many days, and parched the earth,\r\nso that an abundance of silver ore was melted, and the metal flowed in\r\nstreams of pure silver like a river.\" Aristotle, nearly three centuries\r\nbefore Diodorus, mentions this same story (_De Mirabilibus_, 87): \"They\r\nsay that in Ibernia the woods were set on fire by certain shepherds, and\r\nthe earth thus heated, the country visibly flowed silver; and when some\r\ntime later there were earthquakes, and the earth burst asunder at\r\ndifferent places, a large amount of silver was collected.\" As the works\r\nof Posidonius are lost, it is probable that Agricola was quoting from\r\nStrabo (III., 2, 9), who says, in describing Spain: \"Posidonius, in\r\npraising the amount and excellence of the metals, cannot refrain from\r\nhis accustomed rhetoric, and becomes quite enthusiastic in exaggeration.\r\nHe tells us we are not to disbelieve the fable that formerly the forests\r\nhaving been set on fire, the earth, which was loaded with silver and\r\ngold, melted and threw up these metals to the surface, for inasmuch as\r\nevery mountain and wooded hill seemed to be heaped up with money by a\r\nlavish fortune.\" (Hamilton's Trans. I., p. 220). Or he may have been\r\nquoting from the _Deipnosophistae_ of Athenaeus (VI.), where Posidonius\r\nis quoted: \"And the mountains ... when once the woods upon them had\r\ncaught fire, spontaneously ran with liquid silver.\"\r\n\r\n[18] Lucretius, _De Rerum Natura_ V. 1241.\r\n\r\n[19] Agricola's account of this event in _De Veteribus et Novis\r\nMetallis_ is as follows (p. 393): \"Now veins are not always first\r\ndisclosed by the hand and labour of man, nor has art always demonstrated\r\nthem; sometimes they have been disclosed rather by chance or by good\r\nfortune. I will explain briefly what has been written upon this matter\r\nin history, what miners tell us, and what has occurred in our times.\r\nThus the mines at Goslar are said to have been found in the following\r\nway. A certain noble, whose name is not recorded, tied his horse, which\r\nwas named Ramelus, to the branch of a tree which grew on the mountain.\r\nThis horse, pawing the earth with its hoofs, which were iron shod, and\r\nthus turning it over, uncovered a hidden vein of lead, not unlike the\r\nwinged Pegasus, who in the legend of the poets opened a spring when he\r\nbeat the rock with his hoof. So just as that spring is named Hippocrene\r\nafter that horse, so our ancestors named the mountain Rammelsberg.\r\nWhereas the perennial water spring of the poets would long ago have\r\ndried up, the vein even to-day exists, and supplies an abundant amount\r\nof excellent lead. That a horse can have opened a vein will seem\r\ncredible to anyone who reflects in how many ways the signs of veins are\r\nshown by chance, all of which are explained in my work _De Re\r\nMetallica_. Therefore, here we will believe the story, both because it\r\nmay happen that a horse may disclose a vein, and because the name of the\r\nmountain agrees with the story.\" Agricola places the discovery of Goslar\r\nin the Hartz at prior to 936. See Note 11, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[20] _Fragmenta_. The glossary gives \"_Geschube_.\" This term is defined\r\nin the _Bergwerks' Lexicon_ (Chemnitz, 1743, p. 250) as the pieces of\r\nstone, especially tin-stone, broken from the vein and washed out by the\r\nwater--the croppings.\r\n\r\n[21] So far as we are able to discover, this is the first published\r\ndescription of the divining rod as applied to minerals or water. Like\r\nAgricola, many authors have sought to find its origin among the\r\nAncients. The magic rods of Moses and Homer, especially the rod with\r\nwhich the former struck the rock at Horeb, the rod described by Ctesias\r\n(died 398 B.C.) which attracted gold and silver, and the _virgula\r\ndivina_ of the Romans have all been called up for proof. It is true that\r\nthe Romans are responsible for the name _virgula divina_, \"divining\r\nrod,\" but this rod was used for taking auguries by casting bits of wood\r\n(Cicero, _De Divinatione_). Despite all this, while the ancient\r\nnaturalists all give detailed directions for finding water, none mention\r\nanything akin to the divining rod of the Middle Ages. It is also worth\r\nnoting that the Monk Theophilus in the 12th Century also gives a\r\ndetailed description of how to find water, but makes no mention of the\r\nrod. There are two authorities sometimes cited as prior to Agricola, the\r\nfirst being Basil Valentine in his \"Last Will and Testament\"\r\n(XXIV-VIII.), and while there may be some reason (see Appendix) for\r\naccepting the authenticity of the \"Triumphal Chariot of Antimony\" by\r\nthis author, as dating about 1500, there can be little doubt that the\r\n\"Last Will and Testament\" was spurious and dated about 50 years after\r\nAgricola. Paracelsus (_De Natura Rerum_ IX.), says: \"These (divinations)\r\nare vain and misleading, and among the first of them are divining rods,\r\nwhich have deceived many miners. If they once point rightly they deceive\r\nten or twenty times.\" In his _De Origine Morborum Invisibilium_ (Book\r\nI.) he adds that the \"faith turns the rod.\" These works were no doubt\r\nwritten prior to _De Re Metallica_--Paracelsus died in 1541--but they\r\nwere not published until some time afterward. Those interested in the\r\nstrange persistence of this superstition down to the present day--and\r\nthe files of the patent offices of the world are full of it--will find\r\nthe subject exhaustively discussed in M. E. Chevreul's \"_De la Baguette\r\nDivinatoire_,\" Paris, 1845; L. Figuier, \"_Histoire du Merveilleux dans\r\nles temps moderne II._\", Paris, 1860; W. F. Barrett, Proceedings of the\r\nSociety of Psychical Research, part 32, 1897, and 38, 1900; R. W.\r\nRaymond, American Inst. of Mining Engineers, 1883, p. 411. Of the\r\ndescriptions by those who believed in it there is none better than that\r\nof William Pryce (_Mineralogia Cornubiensis_, London, 1778, pp.\r\n113-123), who devotes much pains to a refutation of Agricola. When we\r\nconsider that a century later than Agricola such an advanced mind as\r\nRobert Boyle (1626-1691), the founder of the Royal Society, was\r\nconvinced of the genuineness of the divining rod, one is more impressed\r\nwith the clarity of Agricola's vision. In fact, there were few indeed,\r\ndown to the 19th Century, who did not believe implicitly in the\r\neffectiveness of this instrument, and while science has long since\r\nabandoned it, not a year passes but some new manifestation of its hold\r\non the popular mind breaks out.\r\n\r\n[22] Exodus VII., 10, 11, 12.\r\n\r\n[23] Odyssey XVI., 172, and X., 238.\r\n\r\n[24] Odyssey XXIV., 1, etc. The _Caduceus_ of Hermes had also the power\r\nof turning things to gold, and it is interesting to note that in its\r\noldest form, as the insignia of heralds and of ambassadors, it had two\r\nprongs.\r\n\r\n[25] In a general way _venae profundae_ were fissure veins and _venae\r\ndilatatae_ were sheeted deposits. For description see Book III.\r\n\r\n[26] These mines are in the Erzgebirge. We have adopted the names given\r\nin the German translation.\r\n\r\n[27] The quotation from Pliny (XXXIII., 31) as a whole reads as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"Silver is found in nearly all the provinces, but the finest of all in\r\nSpain; where it is found in the barren lands, and in the mountains.\r\nWherever one vein of silver has been found, another is sure to be found\r\nnot far away. This is the case of nearly all the metals, whence it\r\nappears that the Greeks derived _metalla_. It is wonderful that the\r\nshafts begun by Hannibal in Spain still remain, their names being\r\nderived from their makers. One of these at the present day called\r\nBaebelo, furnished Hannibal with three hundred pounds' weight (of\r\nsilver) per day. This mountain is excavated for a distance of fifteen\r\nhundred paces; and for this distance there are waterbearers lighted by\r\ntorches standing night and day baling out the water in turns, thus\r\nmaking quite a river.\" Hannibal dates 247-183 B.C. and was therefore\r\ndead 206 years when Pliny was born. According to a footnote in Bostock\r\nand Riley's translation of Pliny, these workings were supposed to be in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Castulo, now Cazlona, near Linares. It was at\r\nCastulo that Hannibal married his rich wife Himilce; and in the hills\r\nnorth of Linares there are ancient silver mines still known as Los Pozos\r\nde Anibal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreviously I have given much information concerning the miners, also I\r\nhave discussed the choice of localities for mining, for washing sands,\r\nand for evaporating waters; further, I described the method of searching\r\nfor veins. With such matters I was occupied in the second book; now I\r\ncome to the third book, which is about veins and stringers, and the\r\nseams in the rocks[1]. The term \"vein\" is sometimes used to indicate\r\n_canales_ in the earth, but very often elsewhere by this name I have\r\ndescribed that which may be put in vessels[2]; I now attach a second\r\nsignificance to these words, for by them I mean to designate any mineral\r\nsubstances which the earth keeps hidden within her own deep receptacles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 45a (Vein in mountain): A, C--The mountain. B--_Vena\r\nprofunda_.]\r\n\r\nFirst I will speak of the veins, which, in depth, width, and length,\r\ndiffer very much one from another. Those of one variety descend from the\r\nsurface of the earth to its lowest depths, which on account of this\r\ncharacteristic, I am accustomed to call \"_venae profundae_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration 45b (Vein in mountain): A, D--The mountain. B, C--_Vena\r\ndilatata_.]\r\n\r\nAnother kind, unlike the _venae profundae_, neither ascend to the\r\nsurface of the earth nor descend, but lying under the ground, expand\r\nover a large area; and on that account I call them \"_venae dilatatae_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration 49 (Veins in mountain): A, B, C, D--The mountain. E, F, G,\r\nH, I, K--_Vena cumulata_.]\r\n\r\nAnother occupies a large extent of space in length and width; therefore\r\nI usually call it \"_vena cumulata_,\" for it is nothing else than an\r\naccumulation of some certain kind of mineral, as I have described in the\r\nbook entitled _De Subterraneorum Ortu et Causis_. It occasionally\r\nhappens, though it is unusual and rare, that several accumulations of\r\nthis kind are found in one place, each one or more fathoms in depth and\r\nfour or five in width, and one is distant from another two, three, or\r\nmore fathoms. When the excavation of these accumulations begins, they at\r\nfirst appear in the shape of a disc; then they open out wider; finally\r\nfrom each of such accumulations is usually formed a \"_vena cumulata_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration 50a (Veins in mountain): A--_Vena profunda_.\r\nB--_Intervenium_. C--Another _vena profunda_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 50b (Veins in mountain): A & B--_Vena dilatatae_.\r\nC--_Intervenium_. D & E--Other _venae dilatatae_.]\r\n\r\nThe space between two veins is called an _intervenium_; this interval\r\nbetween the veins, if it is between _venae dilatatae_ is entirely hidden\r\nunderground. If, however, it lies between _venae profundae_ then the top\r\nis plainly in sight, and the remainder is hidden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 53 (Veins in mountain): A--Wide _vena profunda_.\r\nB--Narrow _vena profunda_.]\r\n\r\n_Venae profundae_ differ greatly one from another in width, for some of\r\nthem are one fathom wide, some are two cubits, others one cubit; others\r\nagain are a foot wide, and some only half a foot; all of which our\r\nminers call wide veins. Others on the contrary, are only a palm wide,\r\nothers three digits, or even two; these they call narrow. But in other\r\nplaces where there are very wide veins, the widths of a cubit, or a\r\nfoot, or half a foot, are said to be narrow; at Cremnitz, for instance,\r\nthere is a certain vein which measures in one place fifteen fathoms in\r\nwidth, in another eighteen, and in another twenty; the truth of this\r\nstatement is vouched for by the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 54a (Veins in mountain): A--Thin _vena dilatata_.\r\nB--Thick _vena dilatata_.]\r\n\r\n_Venae dilatatae_, in truth, differ also in thickness, for some are one\r\nfathom thick, others two, or even more; some are a cubit thick, some a\r\nfoot, some only half a foot; and all these are usually called thick\r\nveins. Some on the other hand, are but a palm thick, some three digits,\r\nsome two, some one; these are called thin veins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 54b (Seams in the Rocks): A, B, C--Vein. D, E, F--Seams in\r\nthe Rock (_Commissurae Saxorum_).]\r\n\r\n_Venae profundae_ vary in direction; for some run from east to west.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 55a (Seams in the Rocks): A, B, C--Vein. D, E, F--_Seams in\r\nthe Rocks_.]\r\n\r\nOthers, on the other hand, run from west to east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 55b (Seams in the Rocks): A, B, C--Vein. D, E, F--_Seams in\r\nthe Rocks_.]\r\n\r\nOthers run from south to north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 56 (Seams in the Rocks): A, B, C--Vein. D, E, F--_Seams in\r\nthe Rocks_.]\r\n\r\nOthers, on the contrary, run from north to south.\r\n\r\nThe seams in the rocks indicate to us whether a vein runs from the east\r\nor from the west. For instance, if the rock seams incline toward the\r\nwestward as they descend into the earth, the vein is said to run from\r\neast to west; if they incline toward the east, the vein is said to run\r\nfrom west to east; in a similar manner, we determine from the rock seams\r\nwhether the veins run north or south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 57 (Compass)]\r\n\r\nNow miners divide each quarter of the earth into six divisions; and by\r\nthis method they apportion the earth into twenty-four directions, which\r\nthey divide into two parts of twelve each. The instrument which\r\nindicates these directions is thus constructed. First a circle is made;\r\nthen at equal intervals on one half portion of it right through to the\r\nother, twelve straight lines called by the Greeks [Greek: diametroi],\r\nand in the Latin _dimetientes_, are drawn through a central point which\r\nthe Greeks call [Greek: kentron], so that the circle is thus divided\r\ninto twenty-four divisions, all being of an equal size. Then, within the\r\ncircle are inscribed three other circles, the outermost of which has\r\ncross-lines dividing it into twenty-four equal parts; the space between\r\nit and the next circle contains two sets of twelve numbers, inscribed on\r\nthe lines called \"diameters\"; while within the innermost circle it is\r\nhollowed out to contain a magnetic needle[3]. The needle lies directly\r\nover that one of the twelve lines called \"diameters\" on which the\r\nnumber XII is inscribed at both ends.\r\n\r\nWhen the needle which is governed by the magnet points directly from the\r\nnorth to the south, the number XII at its tail, which is forked,\r\nsignifies the north, that number XII which is at its point indicates the\r\nsouth. The sign VI superior indicates the east, and VI inferior the\r\nwest. Further, between each two cardinal points there are always five\r\nothers which are not so important. The first two of these directions are\r\ncalled the prior directions; the last two are called the posterior, and\r\nthe fifth direction lies immediately between the former and the latter;\r\nit is halved, and one half is attributed to one cardinal point and one\r\nhalf to the other. For example, between the northern number XII and the\r\neastern number VI, are points numbered I, II, III, IV, V, of which I and\r\nII are northern directions lying toward the east, IV and V are eastern\r\ndirections lying toward the north, and III is assigned, half to the\r\nnorth and half to the east.\r\n\r\nOne who wishes to know the direction of the veins underground, places\r\nover the vein the instrument just described; and the needle, as soon as\r\nit becomes quiet, will indicate the course of the vein. That is, if the\r\nvein proceeds from VI to VI, it either runs from east to west, or from\r\nwest to east; but whether it be the former or the latter, is clearly\r\nshown by the seams in the rocks. If the vein proceeds along the line\r\nwhich is between V and VI toward the opposite direction, it runs from\r\nbetween the fifth and sixth divisions of east to the west, or from\r\nbetween the fifth and sixth divisions of west to the east; and again,\r\nwhether it is the one or the other is clearly shown by the seams in the\r\nrocks. In a similar manner we determine the other directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 59 (Compass with winds)]\r\n\r\nNow miners reckon as many points as the sailors do in reckoning up the\r\nnumber of the winds. Not only is this done to-day in this country, but\r\nit was also done by the Romans who in olden times gave the winds partly\r\nLatin names and partly names borrowed from the Greeks. Any miner who\r\npleases may therefore call the directions of the veins by the names of\r\nthe winds. There are four principal winds, as there are four cardinal\r\npoints: the _Subsolanus_, which blows from the east; and its opposite\r\nthe _Favonius_, which blows from the west; the latter is called by the\r\nGreeks [Greek: Zephyros], and the former [Greek: Apeliotes]. There is\r\nthe _Auster_, which blows from the south; and opposed to it is the\r\n_Septentrio_, from the north; the former the Greeks called [Greek:\r\nNotos], and the latter [Greek: Aparktias]. There are also subordinate\r\nwinds, to the number of twenty, as there are directions, for between\r\neach two principal winds there are always five subordinate ones. Between\r\nthe _Subsolanus_ (east wind) and the _Auster_ (south wind) there is the\r\n_Ornithiae_ or the Bird wind, which has the first place next to the\r\n_Subsolanus_; then comes _Caecias_; then _Eurus_, which lies in the\r\nmidway of these five; next comes _Vulturnus_; and lastly, _Euronotus_,\r\nnearest the _Auster_ (south wind). The Greeks have given these names to\r\nall of these, with the exception of _Vulturnus_, but those who do not\r\ndistinguish the winds in so precise a manner say this is the same as the\r\nGreeks called [Greek: Euros]. Between the _Auster_ (south wind) and the\r\n_Favonius_ (west wind) is first _Altanus_, to the right of the _Auster_\r\n(south wind); then _Libonotus_; then _Africus_, which is the middle one\r\nof these five; after that comes _Subvesperus_; next _Argestes_, to the\r\nleft of _Favonius_ (west wind). All these, with the exception of\r\n_Libonotus_ and _Argestes_, have Latin names; but _Africus_ also is\r\ncalled by the Greeks [Greek: Lips]. In a similar manner, between\r\n_Favonius_ (west wind) and _Septentrio_ (north wind), first to the right\r\nof _Favonius_ (west wind), is the _Etesiae_; then _Circius_; then\r\n_Caurus_, which is in the middle of these five; then _Corus_; and lastly\r\n_Thrascias_ to the left of _Septentrio_ (north wind). To all of these,\r\nexcept that of _Caurus_, the Greeks gave the names, and those who do not\r\ndistinguish the winds by so exact a plan, assert that the wind which the\r\nGreeks called [Greek: Koros] and the Latins _Caurus_ is one and the\r\nsame. Again, between _Septentrio_ (north wind) and the _Subsolanus_\r\n(east wind), the first to the right of _Septentrio_ (north wind) is\r\n_Gallicus_; then _Supernas_; then _Aquilo_, which is the middle one of\r\nthese five; next comes _Boreas_; and lastly _Carbas_, to the left of\r\n_Subsolanus_ (east wind). Here again, those who do not consider the\r\nwinds to be in so great a multitude, but say there are but twelve winds\r\nin all, or at the most fourteen, assert that the wind called by the\r\nGreeks [Greek: Boreas] and the Latins _Aquilo_ is one and the same. For\r\nour purpose it is not only useful to adopt this large number of winds,\r\nbut even to double it, as the German sailors do. They always reckon that\r\nbetween each two there is one in the centre taken from both. By this\r\nmethod we also are able to signify the intermediate directions by means\r\nof the names of the winds. For instance, if a vein runs from VI east to\r\nVI west, it is said to proceed from _Subsolanus_ (east wind) to\r\n_Favonius_ (west wind); but one which proceeds from between V and VI of\r\nthe east to between V and VI west is said to proceed out of the middle\r\nof _Carbas_ and _Subsolanus_ to between _Argestes_ and _Favonius_; the\r\nremaining directions, and their intermediates are similarly designated.\r\nThe miner, on account of the natural properties of a magnet, by which\r\nthe needle points to the south, must fix the instrument already\r\ndescribed so that east is to the left and west to the right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 60 (Veins in mountain): A, B--_Venae dilatatae_. C--_Seams\r\nin the Rocks_.]\r\n\r\nIn a similar way to _venae profundae_, the _venae dilatatae_ vary in\r\ntheir lateral directions, and we are able to understand from the seams\r\nin the rocks in which direction they extend into the ground. For if\r\nthese incline toward the west in depth, the vein is said to extend from\r\neast to west; if on the contrary, they incline toward the east, the vein\r\nis said to go from west to east. In the same way, from the rock seams we\r\ncan determine veins running south and north, or the reverse, and\r\nlikewise to the subordinate directions and their intermediates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 61a (Veins in mountain): A--Straight _vena profunda_.\r\nB--Curved _vena profunda_ [should be _vena dilatata_(?)].]\r\n\r\nFurther, as regards the question of direction of a _vena profunda_, one\r\nruns straight from one quarter of the earth to that quarter which is\r\nopposite, while another one runs in a curve, in which case it may happen\r\nthat a vein proceeding from the east does not turn to the quarter\r\nopposite, which is the west, but twists itself and turns to the south or\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 61b (Veins in mountain): A--Horizontal _vena dilatata_.\r\nB--Inclined _vena dilatata_. C--Curved _vena dilatata_.]\r\n\r\nSimilarly some _venae dilatatae_ are horizontal, some are inclined, and\r\nsome are curved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 62a (Veins in mountain)]\r\n\r\nAlso the veins which we call _profundae_ differ in the manner in which\r\nthey descend into the depths of the earth; for some are vertical (A),\r\nsome are inclined and sloping (B), others crooked (C).\r\n\r\n[Illustration 62b (Veins in mountain)]\r\n\r\nMoreover, _venae profundae_ (B) differ much among themselves regarding\r\nthe kind of locality through which they pass, for some extend along the\r\nslopes of mountains or hills (A-C) and do not descend down the sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 63a (Veins in mountain)]\r\n\r\nOther _Venae Profundae_ (D, E, F) from the very summit of the mountain\r\nor hill descend the slope (A) to the hollow or valley (B), and they\r\nagain ascend the slope or the side of the mountain or hill opposite (C).\r\n\r\n[Illustration 63b (Veins in mountain)]\r\n\r\nOther _Venae Profundae_ (C, D) descend the mountain or hill (A) and\r\nextend out into the plain (B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration 64a (Veins in mountain): A--Mountainous Plain. B--_Vena\r\nprofunda_.]\r\n\r\nSome veins run straight along on the plateaux, the hills, or plains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 64b (Intersections of Veins): A--Principal vein.\r\nB--Transverse vein. C--Vein cutting principal one obliquely.]\r\n\r\nIn the next place, _venae profundae_ differ not a little in the manner\r\nin which they intersect, since one may cross through a second\r\ntransversely, or one may cross another one obliquely as if cutting it in\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 65 (Intersections of Veins): A--Principal vein. B--Vein\r\nwhich cuts A obliquely. C--Part carried away. D--That part which has\r\nbeen carried forward.]\r\n\r\nIf a vein which cuts through another principal one obliquely be the\r\nharder of the two, it penetrates right through it, just as a wedge of\r\nbeech or iron can be driven through soft wood by means of a tool. If it\r\nbe softer, the principal vein either drags the soft one with it for a\r\ndistance of three feet, or perhaps one, two, three, or several fathoms,\r\nor else throws it forward along the principal vein; but this latter\r\nhappens very rarely. But that the vein which cuts the principal one is\r\nthe same vein on both sides, is shown by its having the same character\r\nin its footwalls and hangingwalls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 66a (Intersections of Veins): A, B--Two veins descend\r\ninclined and dip toward each other. C--Junction. Likewise two veins.\r\nD--Indicates one descending vertically. E--Marks the other descending\r\ninclined, which dips toward D. F--Their junction.]\r\n\r\nSometimes _venae profundae_ join one with another, and from two or more\r\noutcropping veins[4], one is formed; or from two which do not outcrop\r\none is made, if they are not far distant from each other, and the one\r\ndips into the other, or if each dips toward the other, and they thus\r\njoin when they have descended in depth. In exactly the same way, out of\r\nthree or more veins, one may be formed in depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 66b (Intersections of Veins)]\r\n\r\nHowever, such a junction of veins sometimes disunites and in this way\r\nit happens that the vein which was the right-hand vein becomes the left;\r\nand again, the one which was on the left becomes the right.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, one vein may be split and divided into parts by some hard\r\nrock resembling a beak, or stringers in soft rock may sunder the vein\r\nand make two or more. These sometimes join together again and sometimes\r\nremain divided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 67 (Intersections of Veins): A, B--Veins dividing. C--The\r\nsame joining.]\r\n\r\nWhether a vein is separating from or uniting with another can be\r\ndetermined only from the seams in the rocks. For example, if a principal\r\nvein runs from the east to the west, the rock seams descend in depth\r\nlikewise from the east toward the west, and the associated vein which\r\njoins with the principal vein, whether it runs from the south or the\r\nnorth, has its rock seams extending in the same way as its own, and they\r\ndo not conform with the seams in the rock of the principal vein--which\r\nremain the same after the junction--unless the associated vein proceeds\r\nin the same direction as the principal vein. In that case we name the\r\nbroader vein the principal one, and the narrower the associated vein.\r\nBut if the principal vein splits, the rock seams which belong\r\nrespectively to the parts, keep the same course when descending in depth\r\nas those of the principal vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 68 (Intersections of Veins): A, C--_Vena dilatata_\r\ncrossing a _vena profunda_.

K--_Vena profunda_ which divides the\r\n_vena dilatata_.]\r\n\r\nBut enough of _venae profundae_, their junctions and divisions. Now we\r\ncome to _venae dilatatae_. A _vena dilatata_ may either cross a _vena\r\nprofunda_, or join with it, or it may be cut by a _vena profunda_, and\r\nbe divided into parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 69a (Veins in mountain): A--The \"beginning\" (_origo_).\r\nB--The \"end\" (_finis_). C--The \"head\" (_caput_). D--The \"tail\"\r\n(_cauda_).]\r\n\r\nFinally, a _vena profunda_ has a \"beginning\" (_origo_), an \"end\"\r\n(_finis_), a \"head\" (_caput_), and a \"tail\" (_cauda_). That part whence\r\nit takes its rise is said to be its \"beginning,\" that in which it\r\nterminates the \"end.\" Its \"head\"[5] is that part which emerges into\r\ndaylight; its \"tail\" that part which is hidden in the earth. But miners\r\nhave no need to seek the \"beginning\" of veins, as formerly the kings of\r\nEgypt sought for the source of the Nile, but it is enough for them to\r\ndiscover some other part of the vein and to recognise its direction, for\r\nseldom can either the \"beginning\" or the \"end\" be found. The direction\r\nin which the head of the vein comes into the light, or the direction\r\ntoward which the tail extends, is indicated by its footwall and\r\nhangingwall. The latter is said to hang, and the former to lie. The vein\r\nrests on the footwall, and the hangingwall overhangs it; thus, when we\r\ndescend a shaft, the part to which we turn the face is the footwall and\r\nseat of the vein, that to which we turn the back is the hangingwall.\r\nAlso in another way, the head accords with the footwall and the tail\r\nwith the hangingwall, for if the footwall is toward the south, the vein\r\nextends its head into the light toward the south; and the hangingwall,\r\nbecause it is always opposite to the footwall, is then toward the north.\r\nConsequently the vein extends its tail toward the north if it is an\r\ninclined _vena profunda_. Similarly, we can determine with regard to\r\neast and west and the subordinate and their intermediate directions. A\r\n_vena profunda_ which descends into the earth may be either vertical,\r\ninclined, or crooked; the footwall of an inclined vein is easily\r\ndistinguished from the hangingwall, but it is not so with a vertical\r\nvein; and again, the footwall of a crooked vein is inverted and changed\r\ninto the hangingwall, and contrariwise the hangingwall is twisted into\r\nthe footwall, but very many of these crooked veins may be turned back to\r\nvertical or inclined ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 69b (Veins in mountain): A--The \"beginning.\" B--The \"end.\"\r\nC, D--The \"sides.\"]\r\n\r\nA _vena dilatata_ has only a \"beginning\" and an \"end,\" and in the place\r\nof the \"head\" and \"tail\" it has two sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 70 (Veins in mountain): A--The \"beginning.\" B--The \"end.\"\r\nC--The \"head.\" D--The \"tail.\" E--Transverse vein.]\r\n\r\nA _vena cumulata_ has a \"beginning,\" an \"end,\" a \"head,\" and a \"tail,\"\r\njust as a _vena profunda_. Moreover, a _vena cumulata_, and likewise a\r\n_vena dilatata_, are often cut through by a transverse _vena profunda_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 71a (Fibra dilatata): A, B--Veins. C--Transverse\r\nstringer. D--Oblique stringer. E--Associated stringer. F--_Fibra\r\ndilatata_.]\r\n\r\nStringers (_fibrae_)[6], which are little veins, are classified into\r\n_fibrae transversae_, _fibrae obliquae_ which cut the vein obliquely,\r\n_fibrae sociae_, _fibrae dilatatae_, and _fibrae incumbentes_. The\r\n_fibra transversa_ crosses the vein; the _fibra obliqua_ crosses the\r\nvein obliquely; the _fibra socia_ joins with the vein itself; the _fibra\r\ndilatata_, like the _vena dilatata_, penetrates through it; but the\r\n_fibra dilatata_, as well as the _fibra profunda_, is usually found\r\nassociated with a vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 71b (Fibra incumbens): A--Vein. B--_Fibra incumbens_ from\r\nthe surface of the hangingwall. C--Same from the footwall.]\r\n\r\nThe _fibra incumbens_ does not descend as deeply into the earth as the\r\nother stringers, but lies on the vein, as it were, from the surface to\r\nthe hangingwall or footwall, from which it is named _Subdialis_.[7]\r\n\r\nIn truth, as to direction, junctions, and divisions, the stringers are\r\nnot different from the veins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 72 (Seams in the Rocks): A--Seams which proceed from the\r\neast. B--The inverse.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the seams, which are the very finest stringers (_fibrae_),\r\ndivide the rock, and occur sometimes frequently, sometimes rarely. From\r\nwhatever direction the vein comes, its seams always turn their heads\r\ntoward the light in the same direction. But, while the seams usually run\r\nfrom one point of the compass to another immediately opposite it, as for\r\ninstance, from east to west, if hard stringers divert them, it may\r\nhappen that these very seams, which before were running from east to\r\nwest, then contrariwise proceed from west to east, and the direction of\r\nthe rocks is thus inverted. In such a case, the direction of the veins\r\nis judged, not by the direction of the seams which occur rarely, but by\r\nthose which constantly recur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 73 (Veins in mountain): A--Solid vein. B--Solid stringer.\r\nC--Cavernous vein. D--Cavernous stringer. E--Barren vein. F--Barren\r\nstringer.]\r\n\r\nBoth veins or stringers may be solid or drusy, or barren of minerals, or\r\npervious to water. Solid veins contain no water and very little air. The\r\ndrusy veins rarely contain water; they often contain air. Those which\r\nare barren of minerals often carry water. Solid veins and stringers\r\nconsist sometimes of hard materials, sometimes of soft, and sometimes of\r\na kind of medium between the two.\r\n\r\nBut to return to veins. A great number of miners consider[8] that the\r\nbest veins in depth are those which run from the VI or VII direction of\r\nthe east to the VI or VII direction of the west, through a mountain\r\nslope which inclines to the north; and whose hangingwalls are in the\r\nsouth, and whose footwalls are in the north, and which have their heads\r\nrising to the north, as explained before, always like the footwall, and\r\nfinally, whose rock seams turn their heads to the east. And the veins\r\nwhich are the next best are those which, on the contrary, extend from\r\nthe VI or VII direction of the west to the VI or VII direction of the\r\neast, through the slope of a mountain which similarly inclines to the\r\nnorth, whose hangingwalls are also in the south, whose footwalls are in\r\nthe north, and whose heads rise toward the north; and lastly, whose rock\r\nseams raise their heads toward the west. In the third place, they\r\nrecommend those veins which extend from XII north to XII south, through\r\nthe slope of a mountain which faces east; whose hangingwalls are in the\r\nwest, whose footwalls are in the east; whose heads rise toward the east;\r\nand whose rock seams raise their heads toward the north. Therefore they\r\ndevote all their energies to those veins, and give very little or\r\nnothing to those whose heads, or the heads of whose rock seams rise\r\ntoward the south or west. For although they say these veins sometimes\r\nshow bright specks of pure metal adhering to the stones, or they come\r\nupon lumps of metal, yet these are so few and far between that despite\r\nthem it is not worth the trouble to excavate such veins; and miners who\r\npersevere in digging in the hope of coming upon a quantity of metal,\r\nalways lose their time and trouble. And they say that from veins of this\r\nkind, since the sun's rays draw out the metallic material, very little\r\nmetal is gained. But in this matter the actual experience of the miners\r\nwho thus judge of the veins does not always agree with their opinions,\r\nnor is their reasoning sound; since indeed the veins which run from east\r\nto west through the slope of a mountain which inclines to the south,\r\nwhose heads rise likewise to the south, are not less charged with\r\nmetals, than those to which miners are wont to accord the first place in\r\nproductiveness; as in recent years has been proved by the St. Lorentz\r\nvein at Abertham, which our countrymen call Gottsgaab, for they have dug\r\nout of it a large quantity of pure silver; and lately a vein in\r\nAnnaberg, called by the name of Himmelsch hoz[9], has made it plain by\r\nthe production of much silver that veins which extend from the north to\r\nthe south, with their heads rising toward the west, are no less rich in\r\nmetals than those whose heads rise toward the east.\r\n\r\nIt may be denied that the heat of the sun draws the metallic material\r\nout of these veins; for though it draws up vapours from the surface of\r\nthe ground, the rays of the sun do not penetrate right down to the\r\ndepths; because the air of a tunnel which is covered and enveloped by\r\nsolid earth to the depth of only two fathoms is cold in summer, for the\r\nintermediate earth holds in check the force of the sun. Having observed\r\nthis fact, the inhabitants and dwellers of very hot regions lie down by\r\nday in caves which protect them from the excessive ardour of the sun.\r\nTherefore it is unlikely that the sun draws out from within the earth\r\nthe metallic bodies. Indeed, it cannot even dry the moisture of many\r\nplaces abounding in veins, because they are protected and shaded by the\r\ntrees. Furthermore, certain miners, out of all the different kinds of\r\nmetallic veins, choose those which I have described, and others, on the\r\ncontrary, reject copper mines which are of this sort, so that there\r\nseems to be no reason in this. For what can be the reason if the sun\r\ndraws no copper from copper veins, that it draws silver from silver\r\nveins, and gold from gold veins?\r\n\r\nMoreover, some miners, of whose number was Calbus[10], distinguish\r\nbetween the gold-bearing rivers and streams. A river, they say, or a\r\nstream, is most productive of fine and coarse grains of gold when it\r\ncomes from the east and flows to the west, and when it washes against\r\nthe foot of mountains which are situated in the north, and when it has a\r\nlevel plain toward the south or west. In the second place, they esteem a\r\nriver or a stream which flows in the opposite course from the west\r\ntoward the east, and which has the mountains to the north and the level\r\nplain to the south. In the third place, they esteem the river or the\r\nstream which flows from the north to the south and washes the base of\r\nthe mountains which are situated in the east. But they say that the\r\nriver or stream is least productive of gold which flows in a contrary\r\ndirection from the south to the north, and washes the base of mountains\r\nwhich are situated in the west. Lastly, of the streams or rivers which\r\nflow from the rising sun toward the setting sun, or which flow from the\r\nnorthern parts to the southern parts, they favour those which approach\r\nthe nearest to the lauded ones, and say they are more productive of\r\ngold, and the further they depart from them the less productive they\r\nare. Such are the opinions held about rivers and streams. Now, since\r\ngold is not generated in the rivers and streams, as we have maintained\r\nagainst Albertus[11] in the book entitled \"_De Subterraneorum Ortu et\r\nCausis_,\" Book V, but is torn away from the veins and stringers and\r\nsettled in the sands of torrents and water-courses, in whatever\r\ndirection the rivers or streams flow, therefore it is reasonable to\r\nexpect to find gold therein; which is not opposed by experience.\r\nNevertheless, we do not deny that gold is generated in veins and\r\nstringers which lie under the beds of rivers or streams, as in other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Modern nomenclature in the description of ore-deposits is so\r\nimpregnated with modern views of their origin, that we have considered\r\nit desirable in many instances to adopt the Latin terms used by the\r\nauthor, for we believe this method will allow the reader greater freedom\r\nof judgment as to the author's views. The Latin names retained are\r\nusually expressive even to the non-Latin student. In a general way, a\r\n_vena profunda_ is a fissure vein, a _vena dilatata_ is a bedded\r\ndeposit, and a _vena cumulata_ an impregnation, or a replacement or a\r\n_stockwerk_. The _canales_, as will appear from the following footnote,\r\nwere ore channels. \"The seams of the rocks\" (_commissurae saxorum_) are\r\nvery puzzling. The author states, as appears in the following note, that\r\nthey are of two kinds,--contemporaneous with the formation of the rocks,\r\nand also of the nature of veinlets. However, as to their supposed\r\nrelation to the strike of veins, we can offer no explanation. There are\r\npassages in this chapter where if the word \"ore-shoot\" were introduced\r\nfor \"seams in the rocks\" the text would be intelligible. That is, it is\r\npossible to conceive the view that the determination of whether an\r\neast-west vein ran east or ran west was dependent on the dip of the\r\nore-shoot along the strike. This view, however, is utterly impossible to\r\nreconcile with the description and illustration of _commissurae saxorum_\r\ngiven on page 54, where they are defined as the finest stringers. The\r\nfollowing passage from the _Nuetzliche Bergbuechlin_ (see Appendix), reads\r\nvery much as though the dip of ore-shoots was understood at this time in\r\nrelation to the direction of veins. \"Every vein (_gang_) has two\r\n(outcrops) _ausgehen_, one of the _ausgehen_ is toward daylight along\r\nthe whole length of the vein, which is called the _ausgehen_ of the\r\nwhole vein. The other _ausgehen_ is contrary to or toward the strike\r\n(_streichen_) of the vein, according to its rock (_gestein_), that is\r\ncalled the _gesteins ausgehen_; for instance, every vein that has its\r\nstrike from east to west has its _gesteins ausgehen_ to the east, and\r\n_vice-versa_.\"\r\n\r\nAgricola's classification of ore-deposits, after the general distinction\r\nbetween alluvial and _in situ_ deposits, is based entirely upon form, as\r\nwill be seen in the quotation below relating to the origin of _canales_.\r\nThe German equivalents in the Glossary are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Fissure vein (_vena profunda_)              _Gang._\r\n  Bedded deposit (_vena dilatata_)            _Schwebender gang oder fletze._\r\n  Stockwerk or impregnation (_vena cumulata_) _Geschute oder stock._\r\n  Stringer (_fibra_)                          _Klufft._\r\n  Seams or joints (_commissurae saxorum_)     _Absetzen des gesteins._\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in _De Natura Fossilium_ he describes\r\ncoal and salt, and later in _De Re Metallica_ he describes the Mannsfeld\r\ncopper schists, as all being _venae dilatatae_. This nomenclature and\r\nclassification is not original with Agricola. Pliny (XXXIII, 21) uses\r\nthe term _vena_ with no explanations, and while Agricola coined the\r\nLatin terms for various kinds of veins, they are his transliteration of\r\nGerman terms already in use. The _Nuetzliche Bergbuechlin_ gives this same\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTE ON THE THEORY OF ORE DEPOSITS. Prior to Agricola there\r\nwere three schools of explanation of the phenomena of ore deposits, the\r\northodox followers of the Genesis, the Greek Philosophers, and the\r\nAlchemists. The geology of the Genesis--the contemporaneous formation of\r\neverything--needs no comment other than that for anyone to have proposed\r\nan alternative to the dogma of the orthodox during the Middle Ages,\r\nrequired much independence of mind. Of the Greek views--which are meagre\r\nenough--that of the Peripatetics greatly dominated thought on natural\r\nphenomena down to the 17th century. Aristotle's views may be summarized:\r\nThe elements are earth, water, air, and fire; they are transmutable and\r\nnever found pure, and are endowed with certain fundamental properties\r\nwhich acted as an \"efficient\" force upon the material cause--the\r\nelements. These properties were dryness and dampness and heat and cold,\r\nthe latter being active, the former passive. Further, the elements were\r\npossessed of weight and lightness, for instance earth was absolutely\r\nheavy, fire absolutely light. The active and passive properties existed\r\nin binary combinations, one of which is characteristic, _i.e._, \"earth\"\r\nis cold and dry, water damp and cold, fire hot and dry, air hot and wet;\r\ntransmutation took place, for instance, by removing the cold from water,\r\nwhen air resulted (really steam), and by removing the dampness from\r\nwater, when \"earth\" resulted (really any dissolved substance). The\r\ntransmutation of the elements in the earth (meaning the globe) produces\r\ntwo \"exhalations,\" the one fiery (probably meaning gases), the other\r\ndamp (probably meaning steam). The former produces stones, the latter\r\nthe metals. Theophrastus (On Stones, I to VII.) elaborates the views of\r\nAristotle on the origin of stones, metals, etc.: \"Of things formed in\r\nthe earth some have their origin from water, others from earth. Water is\r\nthe basis of metals, silver, gold, and the rest; 'earth' of stones, as\r\nwell the more precious as the common.... All these are formed by\r\nsolidification of matter pure and equal in its constituent parts, which\r\nhas been brought together in that state by mere afflux or by means of\r\nsome kind of percolation, or separated.... The solidification is in some\r\nof these substances due to heat and in others to cold.\" (Based on Hill's\r\nTrans., pp. 3-11). That is, the metals inasmuch as they become liquid\r\nwhen heated must be in a large part water, and, like water, they\r\nsolidify with cold. Therefore, the \"metals are cold and damp.\" Stones,\r\non the other hand, solidify with heat and do not liquefy, therefore,\r\nthey are \"dry and hot\" and partake largely of \"earth.\" This \"earth\" was\r\nsomething indefinite, but purer and more pristine than common clay. In\r\ndiscussing the ancient beliefs with regard to the origin of deposits, we\r\nmust not overlook the import of the use of the word \"vein\" (_vena_) by\r\nvarious ancient authors including Pliny (XXXIII, 21), although he offers\r\nno explanation of the term.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages there arose the horde of Alchemists and\r\nAstrologers, a review of the development of whose muddled views is but\r\nbarren reading. In the main they held more or less to the Peripatetic\r\nview, with additions of their own. Geber (13th (?) century, see Appendix\r\nB) propounded the conception that all metals were composed of varying\r\nproportions of \"spiritual\" sulphur and quicksilver, and to these\r\nAlbertus Magnus added salt. The Astrologers contributed the idea that\r\nthe immediate cause of the metals were the various planets. The only\r\nwork devoted to description of ore-deposits prior to Agricola was the\r\n_Bergbuechlin_ (about 1520, see Appendix B), and this little book\r\nexhibits the absolute apogee of muddled thought derived from the\r\nPeripatetics, the Alchemists, and the Astrologers. We believe it is of\r\ninterest to reproduce the following statement, if for no other reason\r\nthan to indicate the great advance in thought shown by Agricola.\r\n\r\n\"The first chapter or first part; on the common origin of ore, whether\r\nsilver, gold, tin, copper, iron, or lead ore, in which they all appear\r\ntogether, and are called by the common name of metallic ore. It must be\r\nnoticed that for the washing or smelting of metallic ore, there must be\r\nthe one who works and the thing that is worked upon, or the material\r\nupon which the work is expended. The general worker (efficient force) on\r\nthe ore and on all things that are born, is the heavens, its movement,\r\nits light and influences, as the philosophers say. The influence of the\r\nheavens is multiplied by the movement of the firmaments and the\r\nmovements of the seven planets. Therefore, every metallic ore receives a\r\nspecial influence from its own particular planet, due to the properties\r\nof the planet and of the ore, also due to properties of heat, cold,\r\ndampness, and dryness. Thus gold is of the Sun or its influence, silver\r\nof the Moon, tin of Jupiter, copper of Venus, iron of Mars, lead of\r\nSaturn, and quicksilver of Mercury. Therefore, metals are often called\r\nby these names by hermits and other philosophers. Thus gold is called\r\nthe Sun, in Latin _Sol_, silver is called the Moon, in Latin _Luna_, as\r\nis clearly stated in the special chapters on each metal. Thus briefly\r\nhave we spoken of the 'common worker' of metal and ore. But the thing\r\nworked upon, or the common material of all metals, according to the\r\nopinion of the learned, is sulphur and quicksilver, which through the\r\nmovement and influence of the heavens must have become united and\r\nhardened into one metallic body or one ore. Certain others hold that\r\nthrough the movement and the influence of the heavens, vapours or\r\n_braden_, called mineral exhalations, are drawn up from the depths of\r\nthe earth, from sulphur and quicksilver, and the rising fumes pass into\r\nthe veins and stringers and are united through the effect of the planets\r\nand made into ore. Certain others hold that metal is not formed from\r\nquicksilver, because in many places metallic ore is found and no\r\nquicksilver. But instead of quicksilver they maintain a damp and cold\r\nand slimy material is set up on all sulphur which is drawn out from the\r\nearth, like your perspiration, and from that mixed with sulphur all\r\nmetals are formed. Now each of these opinions is correct according to a\r\ngood understanding and right interpretation; the ore or metal is formed\r\nfrom the fattiness of the earth as the material of the first degree\r\n(primary element), also the vapours or _braden_ on the one part and the\r\nmaterials on the other part, both of which are called quicksilver.\r\nLikewise in the mingling or union of the quicksilver and the sulphur in\r\nthe ore, the sulphur is counted the male and quicksilver the female, as\r\nin the bearing or conception of a child. Also the sulphur is a special\r\nworker in ore or metal.\r\n\r\n\"The second chapter or part deals with the general capacity of the\r\nmountain. Although the influence of the heavens and the fitness of the\r\nmaterial are necessary to the formation of ore or metal, yet these are\r\nnot enough thereto. But there must be adaptability of the natural vessel\r\nin which the ore is formed, such are the veins, namely _steinendegange_,\r\n_flachgange_, _schargange_, _creutzgange_, or as these may be termed in\r\nprovincial names. Also the mineral force must have easy access to the\r\nnatural vessel such as through the _kluffte_ (stringers), namely\r\n_hengkluft_, _querklufte_, _flachekluffte_, _creutzklufft_, and other\r\noccasional _flotzwerk_, according to their various local names. Also\r\nthere must be a suitable place in the mountain which the veins and\r\nstringers can traverse.\"\r\n\r\nAGRICOLA'S VIEWS ON THE ORIGIN OF ORE DEPOSITS. Agricola rejected\r\nabsolutely the Biblical view which, he says, was the opinion of the\r\nvulgar; further, he repudiates the alchemistic and astrological view\r\nwith great vigour. There can be no doubt, however, that he was greatly\r\ninfluenced by the Peripatetic philosophy. He accepted absolutely the\r\nfour elements--earth, fire, water, and air, and their \"binary\"\r\nproperties, and the theory that every substance had a material cause\r\noperated upon by an efficient force. Beyond this he did not go, and a\r\nlarge portion of _De Ortu et Causis_ is devoted to disproof of the\r\norigin of metals and stones from the Peripatetic \"exhalations.\"\r\n\r\nNo one should conclude that Agricola's theories are set out with the\r\nclarity of Darwin or Lyell. However, the matter is of such importance in\r\nthe history of the theory of ore-deposits, and has been either so\r\nignored or so coloured by the preconceptions of narrators, that we\r\nconsider it justifiable to devote the space necessary to a reproduction\r\nof his own statements in _De Ortu et Causis_ and other works. Before\r\ndoing so we believe it will be of service to readers to summarize these\r\nviews, and in giving quotations from the Author's other works, to group\r\nthem under special headings, following the outline of his theory given\r\nbelow. His theory was:--\r\n\r\n(1) Openings in the earth (_canales_) were formed by the erosion of\r\nsubterranean waters.\r\n\r\n(2) These ground waters were due (_a_) to the infiltration of the\r\nsurface waters, rain, river, and sea water; (_b_) to the condensation of\r\nsteam (_halitus_) arising from the penetration of the surface waters to\r\ngreater depths,--the production of this _halitus_ being due to\r\nsubterranean heat, which in his view was in turn due in the main to\r\nburning bitumen (a comprehensive genera which embraced coal).\r\n\r\n(3) The filling of these _canales_ is composed of \"earth,\" \"solidified\r\njuices,\" \"stone,\" metals, and \"compounds,\" all deposited from water and\r\n\"juices\" circulating in the _canales_. (See also note 4, page 1).\r\n\r\n\"Earth\" comprises clay, mud, ochre, marl, and \"peculiar earths\"\r\ngenerally. The origin of these \"earths\" was from rocks, due to erosion,\r\ntransportation, and deposition by water. \"Solidified juices\" (_succi\r\nconcreti_) comprised salt, soda, vitriol, bitumen, etc., being generally\r\nthose substances which he conceived were soluble in and deposited from\r\nwater. \"Stones\" comprised precious, semi-precious, and unusual stones,\r\nsuch as quartz, fluor-spar, etc., as distinguished from country rock;\r\nthe origin of these he attributed in minor proportion to transportation\r\nof fragments of rock, but in the main to deposits from ordinary mineral\r\njuice and from \"stone juice\" (_succus lapidescens_). Metals comprised\r\nthe seven traditional metals; the \"compounds\" comprised the metallic\r\nminerals; and both were due to deposition from juices, the compounds\r\nbeing due to a mixture of juices. The \"juices\" play the most important\r\npart in Agricola's theory. Each substance had its own particular juice,\r\nand in his theory every substance had a material and an efficient cause,\r\nthe first being the juice, the second being heat or cold. Owing to the\r\nlatter the juices fell into two categories--those solidified by heat\r\n(_i.e._, by evaporation, such as salt), and those solidified by cold,\r\n(_i.e._, because metals melt and flow by heat, therefore their\r\nsolidification was due to cold, and the juice underwent similar\r\ntreatment). As to the origin of these juices, some were generated by the\r\nsolution of their own particular substance, but in the main their origin\r\nwas due to the combination of \"dry things,\" such as \"earth,\" with water,\r\nthe mixture being heated, and the resultant metals depended upon the\r\nproportions of \"earth\" and water. In some cases we have been inclined to\r\ntranslate _succus_ (juice) as \"solution,\" but in other cases it embraced\r\nsubstances to which this would not apply, and we feared implying in the\r\ntext a chemical understanding not warranted prior to the atomic theory.\r\nIn order to distinguish between earths, (clays, etc.,) the Peripatetic\r\n\"earth\" (a pure element) and the earth (the globe) we have given the two\r\nformer in quotation marks. There is no doubt some confusion between\r\nearth (clays, etc.) and the Peripatetic \"earth,\" as the latter was a\r\npure substance not found in its pristine form in nature; it is, however,\r\ndifficult to distinguish between the two.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF CANALES (_De Ortu_, p. 35). \"I now come to the _canales_ in\r\nthe earth. These are veins, veinlets, and what are called 'seams in the\r\nrocks.' These serve as vessels or receptacles for the material from\r\nwhich minerals (_res fossiles_) are formed. The term _vena_ is most\r\nfrequently given to what is contained in the _canales_, but likewise the\r\nsame name is applied to the _canales_ themselves. The term vein is\r\nborrowed from that used for animals, for just as their veins are\r\ndistributed through all parts of the body, and just as by means of the\r\nveins blood is diffused from the liver throughout the whole body, so\r\nalso the veins traverse the whole globe, and more particularly the\r\nmountainous districts; and water runs and flows through them. With\r\nregard to veinlets or stringers and 'seams in the rocks,' which are the\r\nthinnest stringers, the following is the mode of their arrangement.\r\nVeins in the earth, just like the veins of an animal, have certain\r\nveinlets of their own, but in a contrary way. For the larger veins of\r\nanimals pour blood into the veinlets, while in the earth the humours are\r\nusually poured from the veinlets into the larger veins, and rarely flow\r\nfrom the larger into the smaller ones. As for the seams in the rocks\r\n(_commissurae saxorum_) we consider that they are produced by two\r\nmethods: by the first, which is peculiar to themselves, they are formed\r\nat the same time as the rocks, for the heat bakes the refractory\r\nmaterial into stone and the non-refractory material similarly heated\r\nexhales its humours and is made into 'earth,' generally friable. The\r\nother method is common also to veins and veinlets, when water is\r\ncollected into one place it softens the rock by its liquid nature, and\r\nby its weight and pressure breaks and divides it. Now, if the rock is\r\nhard, it makes seams in the rocks and veinlets, and if it is not too\r\nhard it makes veins. However, if the rocks are not hard, seams and\r\nveinlets are created as well as veins. If these do not carry a very\r\nlarge quantity of water, or if they are pressed by a great volume of it,\r\nthey soon discharge themselves into the nearest veins. The following\r\nappears to be the reason why some veinlets or stringers and veins are\r\n_profundae_ and others _dilatatae_. The force of the water crushes and\r\nsplits the brittle rocks; and when they are broken and split, it forces\r\nits way through them and passes on, at one time in a downward direction,\r\nmaking small and large _venae profundae_, at another time in a lateral\r\ndirection, in which way _venae dilatatae_ are formed. Now since in each\r\nclass there are found some which are straight, some inclined, and some\r\ncrooked, it should be explained that the water makes the _vena profunda_\r\nstraight when it runs straight downward, inclined when it runs in an\r\ninclined direction; and that it makes a _vena dilatata_ straight when it\r\nruns horizontally to the right or left, and in a similar way inclined\r\nwhen it runs in a sloping direction. Stringers and large veins of the\r\n_profunda_ sort, extending for considerable lengths, become crooked from\r\ntwo causes. In one case when narrow veins are intersected by wide ones,\r\nthen the latter bend or drag the former a little. In the other case,\r\nwhen the water runs against very hard rock, being unable to break\r\nthrough, it goes around the nearest way, and the stringers and veins are\r\nformed bent and crooked. This last is also the reason we sometimes see\r\ncrooked small and large _venae dilatatae_, not unlike the gentle rise\r\nand fall of flowing water. Next, _venae profundae_ are wide, either\r\nbecause of abundant water or because the rock is fragile. On the other\r\nhand, they are narrow, either because but little water flows and\r\ntrickles through them, or because the rock is very hard. The _venae\r\ndilatatae_, too, for the same reasons, are either thin or thick. There\r\nare other differences, too, in stringers and veins, which I will explain\r\nin my work _De Re Metallica_.... There is also a third kind of vein\r\nwhich, as it cannot be described as a wide _vena profunda_, nor as a\r\nthick _vena dilatata_, we will call a _vena cumulata_. These are nothing\r\nelse than places where some species of mineral is accumulated; sometimes\r\nexceeding in depth and also in length and breadth 600 feet; sometimes,\r\nor rather generally, not so deep nor so long, nor so wide. These are\r\ncreated when water has broken away the rock for such a length, breadth,\r\nand thickness, and has flung aside and ejected the stones and sand from\r\nthe great cavern which is thus made; and afterward when the mouth is\r\nobstructed and closed up, the whole cavern is filled with material from\r\nwhich there is in time produced some one or more minerals. Now I have\r\nstated when discoursing on the origin of subterranean humours, that\r\nwater erodes away substances inside the earth, just as it does those on\r\nthe surface, and least of all does it shun minerals; for which reason we\r\nmay daily see veinlets and veins sometimes filled with air and water,\r\nbut void and empty of mining products, and sometimes full of these same\r\nmaterials. Even those which are empty of minerals become finally\r\nobstructed, and when the rock is broken through at some other point the\r\nwater gushes out. It is certain that old springs are closed up in some\r\nway and new ones opened in others. In the same manner, but much more\r\neasily and quickly than in the solid rock, water produces stringers and\r\nveins in surface material, whether it be in plains, hills, or mountains.\r\nOf this kind are the stringers in the banks of rivers which produce\r\ngold, and the veins which produce peculiar earth. So in this manner in\r\nthe earth are made _canales_ which bear minerals.\"\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF GROUND WATERS. (_De Ortu_ p. 5). \"... Besides rain there is\r\nanother kind of water by which the interior of the earth is soaked, so\r\nthat being heated it can continually give off _halitus_, from which\r\narises a great and abundant force of waters.\" In description of the\r\n_modus operandi_ of _halitum_, he says (p. 6): \"... _Halitus_ rises to\r\nthe upper parts of the _canales_, where the congealing cold turns it\r\ninto water, which by its gravity and weight again runs down to the\r\nlowest parts and increases the flow of water if there is any. If any\r\nfinds its way through a _canales dilatata_ the same thing happens, but\r\nit is carried a long way from its place of origin. The first phase of\r\ndistillation teaches us how this water is produced, for when that which\r\nis put into the ampulla is warmed it evaporates (_expirare_), and this\r\n_halitus_ rising into the operculum is converted by cold into water,\r\nwhich drips through the spout. In this way water is being continually\r\ncreated underground.\" (_De Ortu_, p. 7): \"And so we know from all this\r\nthat of the waters which are under the earth, some are collected from\r\nrain, some arise from _halitus_ (steam), some from river-water, some\r\nfrom sea-water; and we know that the _halitum_ is produced within the\r\nearth partly from rain-water, partly from river-water, and partly from\r\nsea-water.\" It would require too much space to set out Agricola's views\r\nupon the origin of the subterranean heat which produced this steam. It\r\nis an involved theory embracing clashing winds, burning bitumen, coal,\r\netc., and is fully set out in the latter part of Book II, _De Ortu et\r\nCausis_.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF GANGUE MINERALS. It is necessary to bear in mind that Agricola\r\ndivided minerals (_res fossiles_--\"Things dug up,\" see note 4, p. 1)\r\ninto \"earths,\" \"solidified juices,\" \"stones,\" \"metals,\" and \"compounds;\"\r\nand, further, to bear in mind that in his conception of the origin of\r\nthings generally, he was a disciple of the Peripatetic logic of a\r\n\"material substance\" and an \"efficient force,\" as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of \"earths,\" he says (_De Ortu_, p. 38): \"Pure and\r\nsimple 'earth' originates in the _canales_ in the following way: rain\r\nwater, which is absorbed by the surface of the earth, first of all\r\npenetrates and passes into the inner parts of the earth and mixes with\r\nit; next, it is collected from all sides into stringers and veins, where\r\nit, and sometimes water of other origin, erodes the 'earth' away,--a\r\ngreat quantity of it if the stringers and veins are in 'earth,' a small\r\nquantity if they are in rock. The softer the rock is, the more the water\r\nwears away particles by its continual movement. To this class of rock\r\nbelongs limestone, from which we see chalk, clay, and marl, and other\r\nunctuous 'earths' made; also sandstone, from which are made those barren\r\n'earths' which we may see in ravines and on bare rocks. For the rain\r\nsoftens limestone or sandstone and carries particles away with it, and\r\nthe sediment collects together and forms mud, which afterward solidifies\r\ninto some kind of 'earth.' In a similar way under the ground the power\r\nof water softens the rock and dissolves the coarser fragments of stone.\r\nThis is clearly shown by the following circumstance, that frequently the\r\npowder of rock or marble is found in a soft state and as if partly\r\ndissolved. Now, the water carries this mixture into the course of some\r\nunderground _canalis_, or dragging it into narrow places, filters away.\r\nAnd in each case the water flows away and a pure and uniform material is\r\nleft from which 'earth' is made.... Particles of rock, however, are only\r\nby force of long time so softened by water as to become similar to\r\nparticles of 'earth.' It is possible to see 'earth' being made in this\r\nway in underground _canales_ in the earth, when drifts or tunnels are\r\ndriven into the mountains, or when shafts are sunk, for then the\r\n_canales_ are laid bare; also it can be seen above ground in ravines, as\r\nI have said, or otherwise disclosed. For in both cases it is clear to\r\nthe eye that they are made out of the 'earth' or rocks, which are often\r\nof the same colour. And in just the same way they are made in the\r\nsprings which the veins discharge. Since all those things which we see\r\nwith our eyes and which are perceived with our senses, are more clearly\r\nunderstood than if they were learnt by means of reasoning, we deem it\r\nsufficient to explain by this argument our view of the origin of\r\n'earth.' In the manner which I have described, 'earths' originate in\r\nveins and veinlets, seams in the rocks, springs, ravines, and other\r\nopenings, therefore all 'earths' are made in this way. As to those that\r\nare found in underground _canales_ which do not appear to have been\r\nderived from the earth or rock adjoining, these have undoubtedly been\r\ncarried by the water for a greater distance from their place of origin;\r\nwhich may be made clear to anyone who seeks their source.\"\r\n\r\nOn the origin of solidified juices he states (_De Ortu_, p. 43): \"I will\r\nnow speak of solidified juices (_succi concreti_). I give this name to\r\nthose minerals which are without difficulty resolved into liquids\r\n(_humore_). Some stones and metals, even though they are themselves\r\ncomposed of juices, have been compressed so solidly by the cold that\r\nthey can only be dissolved with difficulty or not at all.... For juices,\r\nas I said above, are either made when dry substances immersed in\r\nmoisture are cooked by heat, or else they are made when water flows over\r\n'earth,' or when the surrounding moisture corrodes metallic material; or\r\nelse they are forced out of the ground by the power of heat alone.\r\nTherefore, solidified juices originate from liquid juices, which either\r\nheat or cold have condensed. But that which heat has dried, fire reduces\r\nto dust, and moisture dissolves. Not only does warm or cold water\r\ndissolve certain solidified juices, but also humid air; and a juice\r\nwhich the cold has condensed is liquefied by fire and warm water. A\r\nsalty juice is condensed into salt; a bitter one into soda; an\r\nastringent and sharp one into alum or into vitriol. Skilled workmen in a\r\nsimilar way to nature, evaporate water which contains juices of this\r\nkind until it is condensed; from salty ones they make salt, from\r\naluminous ones alum, from one which contains vitriol they make vitriol.\r\nThese workmen imitate nature in condensing liquid juices with heat, but\r\nthey cannot imitate nature in condensing them by cold. From an\r\nastringent juice not only is alum made and vitriol, but also _sory_,\r\n_chalcitis_, and _misy_, which appears to be the 'flower' of vitriol,\r\njust as _melanteria_ is of _sory_. (See note on p. 573 for these\r\nminerals.) When humour corrodes pyrites so that it is friable, an\r\nastringent juice of this kind is obtained.\"\r\n\r\nON THE ORIGIN OF STONES (_De Ortu_, p. 50), he states: \"It is now\r\nnecessary to review in a few words what I have said as to all of the\r\nmaterial from which stones are made; there is first of all mud; next\r\njuice which is solidified by severe cold; then fragments of rock;\r\nafterward stone juice (_succus lapidescens_), which also turns to stone\r\nwhen it comes out into the air; and lastly, everything which has pores\r\ncapable of receiving a stony juice.\" As to an \"efficient force,\" he\r\nstates (p. 54): \"But it is now necessary that I should explain my own\r\nview, omitting the first and antecedent causes. Thus the immediate\r\ncauses are heat and cold; next in some way a stony juice. For we know\r\nthat stones which water has dissolved, are solidified when dried by\r\nheat; and on the contrary, we know that stones which melt by fire, such\r\nas quartz, solidify by cold. For solidification and the conditions which\r\nare opposite thereto, namely, dissolving and liquefying, spring from\r\ncauses which are the opposite to each other. Heat, driving the water\r\n(_humorem_) out of a substance, makes it hard; and cold, by withdrawing\r\nthe air, solidifies the same stone firmly. But if a stony juice, either\r\nalone or mixed with water, finds its way into the pores either of plants\r\nor animals ... it creates stones.... If stony juice is obtained in\r\ncertain stony places and flows through the veins, for this reason\r\ncertain springs, brooks, streams, and lakes, have the power of turning\r\nthings to stone.\"\r\n\r\nON THE ORIGIN OF METALS, he says (_De Ortu_, p. 71): \"Having now refuted\r\nthe opinions of others, I must explain what it really is from which\r\nmetals are produced. The best proof that there is water in their\r\nmaterials is the fact that they flow when melted, whereas they are again\r\nsolidified by the cold of air or water. This, however, must be\r\nunderstood in the sense that there is more water in them and less\r\n'earth'; for it is not simply water that is their substance but water\r\nmixed with 'earth.' And such a proportion of 'earth' is in the mixture\r\nas may obscure the transparency of the water, but not remove the\r\nbrilliance which is frequently in unpolished things. Again, the purer\r\nthe mixture, the more precious the metal which is made from it, and the\r\ngreater its resistance to fire. But what proportion of 'earth' is in\r\neach liquid from which a metal is made no mortal can ever ascertain, or\r\nstill less explain, but the one God has known it, Who has given certain\r\nsure and fixed laws to nature for mixing and blending things together.\r\nIt is a juice (_succus_) then, from which metals are formed; and this\r\njuice is created by various operations. Of these operations the first is\r\na flow of water which softens the 'earth' or carries the 'earth' along\r\nwith it, thus there is a mixture of 'earth' and water, then the power of\r\nheat works upon the mixtures so as to produce that kind of a juice. We\r\nhave spoken of the substance of metals; we must now speak of their\r\nefficient cause.... (p. 75): We do not deny the statement of Albertus\r\nMagnus that the mixture of 'earth' and water is baked by subterranean\r\nheat to a certain denseness, but it is our opinion that the juice so\r\nobtained is afterward solidified by cold so as to become a metal.... We\r\ngrant, indeed, that heat is the efficient cause of a good mixture of\r\nelements, and also cooks this same mixture into a juice, but until this\r\njuice is solidified by cold it is not a metal.... (p. 76): This view of\r\nAristotle is the true one. For metals melt through the heat and somehow\r\nbecome softened; but those which have become softened through heat are\r\nagain solidified by the influence of cold, and, on the contrary, those\r\nwhich become softened by moisture are solidified by heat.\"\r\n\r\nON THE ORIGIN OF COMPOUNDS, he states (_De Ortu_, p. 80): \"There now\r\nremain for our consideration the compound minerals (_mistae_), that is\r\nto say, minerals which contain either solidified juice (_succus\r\nconcretus_) and 'stone,' or else metal or metals and 'stone,' or else\r\nmetal-coloured 'earth,' of which two or more have so grown together by\r\nthe action of cold that one body has been created. By this sign they are\r\ndistinguished from mixed minerals (_composita_), for the latter have not\r\none body. For example, pyrites, galena, and ruby silver are reckoned in\r\nthe category of compound minerals, whereas we say that metallic 'earths'\r\nor stony 'earths' or 'earths' mingled with juices, are mixed minerals;\r\nor similarly, stones in which metal or solidified juices adhere, or\r\nwhich contain 'earth.' But of both these classes I will treat more fully\r\nin my book _De Natura Fossilium_. I will now discuss their origin in a\r\nfew words. A compound mineral is produced when either a juice from which\r\nsome metal is obtained, or a _humour_ and some other juice from which\r\nstone is obtained, are solidified by cold, or when two or more juices of\r\ndifferent metals mixed with the juice from which stone is made, are\r\ncondensed by the same cold, or when a metallic juice is mixed with\r\n'earth' whose whole mass is stained with its colour, and in this way\r\nthey form one body. To the first class belongs _galena_, composed of\r\nlead juice and of that material which forms the substance of opaque\r\nstone. Similarly, transparent ruby silver is made out of silver juice\r\nand the juice which forms the substance of transparent stone; when it is\r\nsmelted into pure silver, since from it is separated the transparent\r\njuice, it is no longer transparent. Then too, there is pyrites, or\r\n_lapis fissilis_, from which sulphur is melted. To the second kind\r\nbelongs that kind of pyrites which contains not only copper and stone,\r\nbut sometimes copper, silver, and stone; sometimes copper, silver, gold,\r\nand stone; sometimes silver, lead, tin, copper and silver glance. That\r\ncompound minerals consist of stone and metal is sufficiently proved by\r\ntheir hardness; that some are made of 'earth' and metal is proved from\r\nbrass, which is composed of copper and calamine; and also proved from\r\nwhite brass, which is coloured by artificial white arsenic. Sometimes\r\nthe heat bakes some of them to such an extent that they appear to have\r\nflowed out of blazing furnaces, which we may see in the case of _cadmia_\r\nand pyrites. A metallic substance is produced out of 'earth' when a\r\nmetallic juice impregnating the 'earth' solidifies with cold, the\r\n'earth' not being changed. A stony substance is produced when viscous\r\nand non-viscous 'earth' are accumulated in one place and baked by heat;\r\nfor then the viscous part turns into stone and the non-viscous is only\r\ndried up.\"\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF JUICES. The portion of Agricola's theory surrounding this\r\nsubject is by no means easy to follow in detail, especially as it is\r\ndifficult to adjust one's point of view to the Peripatetic elements,\r\nfire, water, earth, and air, instead of to those of the atomic theory\r\nwhich so dominates our every modern conception. That Agricola's 'juice'\r\nwas in most cases a solution is indicated by the statement (_De Ortu_,\r\np. 48): \"Nor is juice anything but water, which on the other hand has\r\nabsorbed 'earth' or has corroded or touched metal and somehow become\r\nheated.\" That he realized the difference between mechanical suspension\r\nand solution is evident from (_De Ortu_, p. 50): \"A stony juice differs\r\nfrom water which has abraded something from rock, either because it has\r\nmore of that which deposits, or because heat, by cooking water of that\r\nkind, has thickened it, or because there is something in it which has\r\npowerful astringent properties.\" Much of the author's notion of juices\r\nhas already been given in the quotations regarding various minerals, but\r\nhis most general statement on the subject is as follows:--(_De Ortu_, p.\r\n9): \"Juices, however, are distinguished from water by their density\r\n(_crassitudo_), and are generated in various ways--either when dry\r\nthings are soaked with moisture and the mixture is heated, in which way\r\nby far the greatest part of juices arise, not only inside the earth, but\r\noutside it; or when water running over the earth is made rather dense,\r\nin which way, for the most part the juice becomes salty and bitter; or\r\nwhen the moisture stands upon metal, especially copper, and corrodes it,\r\nand in this way is produced the juice from which chrysocolla originates.\r\nSimilarly, when the moisture corrodes friable cupriferous pyrites an\r\nacrid juice is made from which is produced vitriol and sometimes alum;\r\nor, finally, juices are pressed out by the very force of the heat from\r\nthe earth. If the force is great the juice flows like pitch from burning\r\npine ... in this way we know a kind of bitumen is made in the earth. In\r\nthe same way different kinds of moisture are generated in living bodies,\r\nso also the earth produces waters differing in quality, and in the same\r\nway juices.\"\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION. If we strip his theory of the necessary influence of the\r\nstate of knowledge of his time, and of his own deep classical learning,\r\nwe find two propositions original with Agricola, which still to-day are\r\nfundamentals:\r\n\r\n(1) That ore channels were of origin subsequent to their containing\r\nrocks; (2) That ores were deposited from solutions circulating in these\r\nopenings. A scientist's work must be judged by the advancement he gave\r\nto his science, and with this gauge one can say unhesitatingly that the\r\ntheory which we have set out above represents a much greater step from\r\nwhat had gone before than that of almost any single observer since.\r\nMoreover, apart from any tangible proposition laid down, the deduction\r\nof these views from actual observation instead of from fruitless\r\nspeculation was a contribution to the very foundation of natural\r\nscience. Agricola was wrong in attributing the creation of ore channels\r\nto erosion alone, and it was not until Von Oppel (_Anleitung zur\r\nMarkscheidekunst_, Dresden, 1749 and other essays), two centuries after\r\nAgricola, that the positive proposition that ore channels were due to\r\nfissuring was brought forward. Von Oppel, however, in neglecting\r\nchannels due to erosion (and in this term we include solution) was not\r\naltogether sound. Nor was it until late in the 18th century that the\r\nfilling of ore channels by deposition from solutions was generally\r\naccepted. In the meantime, Agricola's successors in the study of ore\r\ndeposits exhibited positive retrogression from the true fundamentals\r\nadvocated by him. Gesner, Utman, Meier, Lohneys, Barba, Roessler, Becher,\r\nStahl, Henckel, and Zimmerman, all fail to grasp the double essentials.\r\nOther writers of this period often enough merely quote Agricola, some\r\nnot even acknowledging the source, as, for instance, Pryce (_Mineralogia\r\nCornubiensis_, London, 1778) and Williams (Natural History of the\r\nMineral Kingdom, London, 1789). After Von Oppel, the two fundamental\r\nprinciples mentioned were generally accepted, but then arose the\r\ncomplicated and acrimonious discussion of the origin of solutions, and\r\nnothing in Agricola's view was so absurd as Werner's contention (_Neue\r\nTheorie von der Entstehung der Gaenge_, Freiberg, 1791) of the universal\r\nchemical deluge which penetrated fissures open at the surface. While it\r\nis not the purpose of these notes to pursue the history of these\r\nsubjects subsequent to the author's time, it is due to him and to the\r\ncurrent beliefs as to the history of the theory of ore deposits, to call\r\nthe attention of students to the perverse representation of Agricola's\r\nviews by Werner (op. cit.) upon which most writers have apparently\r\nrelied. Why this author should be (as, for instance, by Posepny, Amer.\r\nInst. Mining Engineers, 1901) so generally considered the father of our\r\nmodern theory, can only be explained by a general lack of knowledge of\r\nthe work of previous writers on ore deposition. Not one of the\r\npropositions original with Werner still holds good, while his rejection\r\nof the origin of solutions within the earth itself halted the march of\r\nadvance in thought on these subjects for half a century. It is our hope\r\nto discuss exhaustively at some future time the development of the\r\nhistory of this, one of the most far-reaching of geologic hypotheses.\r\n\r\n[2] The Latin _vena_, \"vein,\" is also used by the author for ore; hence\r\nthis descriptive warning as to its intended double use.\r\n\r\n[3] The endeavour to discover the origin of the compass with the\r\nChinese, Arabs, or other Orientals having now generally ceased, together\r\nwith the idea that the knowledge of the lodestone involved any\r\nacquaintance with the compass, it is permissible to take a rational view\r\nof the subject. The lodestone was well known even before Plato and\r\nAristotle, and is described by Theophrastus (see Note 10, p. 115.) The\r\nfirst authentic and specific mention of the compass appears to be by\r\nAlexander Neckam (an Englishman who died in 1217), in his works _De\r\nUtensilibus_ and _De Naturis Rerum_. The first tangible description of\r\nthe instrument was in a letter to Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt,\r\nwritten in 1269, a translation of which was published by Sir Sylvanus\r\nThompson (London, 1902). His circle was divided into four quadrants and\r\nthese quarters divided into 90 degrees each. The first mention of a\r\ncompass in connection with mines so far as we know is in the _Nuetzlich\r\nBergbuechlin_, a review of which will be found in Appendix B. This book,\r\nwhich dates from 1500, gives a compass much like the one described above\r\nby Agricola. It is divided in like manner into two halves of 12\r\ndivisions each. The four cardinal points being marked _Mitternacht_,\r\n_Morgen_, _Mittag_, and _Abend_. Thus the directions read were referred\r\nto as II. after midnight, etc. According to Joseph Carne (Trans. Roy.\r\nGeol. Socy. of Cornwall, Vol. II, 1814), the Cornish miners formerly\r\nreferred to North-South veins as 12 o'clock veins; South-East North-West\r\nveins as 9 o'clock veins, etc.\r\n\r\n[4] _Crudariis._ Pliny (XXXIII., 31), says:--\"_Argenti vena in summo\r\nreperta crudaria appellatur._\" \"Silver veins discovered at the surface\r\nare called _crudaria._\" The German translator of Agricola uses the term\r\n_sylber gang_--silver vein, obviously misunderstanding the author's\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n[5] It might be considered that the term \"outcrop\" could be used for\r\n\"head,\" but it will be noticed that a _vena dilatata_ would thus be\r\nstated to have no outcrop.\r\n\r\n[6] It is possible that \"veinlets\" would be preferred by purists, but\r\nthe word \"stringer\" has become fixed in the nomenclature of miners and\r\nwe have adopted it. The old English term was \"stringe,\" and appears in\r\nEdward Manlove's \"Rhymed Chronicle,\" London, 1653; Pryce's, _Mineralogia\r\nCornubiensis_, London, 1778, pp. 103 and 329; Mawe's \"Mineralogy of\r\nDevonshire,\" London, 1802, p. 210, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[7] _Subdialis._ \"In the open air.\" The Glossary gives the meaning as\r\n_Ein tag klufft oder tag gehenge_--a surface stringer.\r\n\r\n[8] The following from Chapter IV of the _Nuetzlich Bergbuechlin_ (see\r\nAppendix B) may indicate the source of the theory which Agricola here\r\ndiscards:--\"As to those veins which are most profitable to work, it must\r\nbe remarked that the most suitable location for the vein is on the slope\r\nof the mountain facing south, so its strike is from VII or VI east to VI\r\nor VII west. According to the above-mentioned directions, the outcrop of\r\nthe whole vein should face north, its _gesteins ausgang_ toward the\r\neast, its hangingwall toward the south, and its footwall toward the\r\nnorth, for in such mountains and veins the influence of the planets is\r\nconveniently received to prepare the matter out of which the silver is\r\nto be made or formed.... The other strikes of veins from between east\r\nand south to the region between west and north are esteemed more or less\r\nvaluable, according to whether they are nearer or further away from the\r\nabove-mentioned strikes, but with the same hangingwall, footwall, and\r\noutcrops. But the veins having their strike from north to south, their\r\nhangingwall toward the west, their footwall and their outcrops toward\r\nthe east, are better to work than veins which extend from south to\r\nnorth, whose hangingwalls are toward the east, and footwalls and\r\noutcrops toward the west. Although the latter veins sometimes yield\r\nsolid and good silver ore, still it is not sure and certain, because the\r\nwhole mineral force is completely scattered and dispersed through the\r\noutcrop, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[9] The names in the Latin are given as _Donum Divinum_--\"God's Gift,\"\r\nand _Coelestis Exercitus_--\"Heavenly Host.\" The names given in the text\r\nare from the German Translation. The former of these mines was located\r\nin the valley of Joachim, where Agricola spent many years as the town\r\nphysician at Joachimsthal. It is of further interest, as Agricola\r\nobtained an income from it as a shareholder. He gives the history of the\r\nmine (_De Veteribus et Novis Metallis_, Book I.), as follows:--\"The\r\nmines at Abertham were discovered, partly by chance, partly by science.\r\nIn the eleventh year of Charles V. (1530), on the 18th of February, a\r\npoor miner, but one skilled in the art of mining, dwelt in the middle of\r\nthe forest in a solitary hut, and there tended the cattle of his\r\nemployer. While digging a little trench in which to store milk, he\r\nopened a vein. At once he washed some in a bowl and saw particles of the\r\npurest silver settled at the bottom. Overcome with joy he informed his\r\nemployer, and went to the _Bergmeister_ and petitioned that official to\r\ngive him a head mining lease, which in the language of our people he\r\ncalled _Gottsgaab_. Then he proceeded to dig the vein, and found more\r\nfragments of silver, and the miners were inspired with great hopes as to\r\nthe richness of the vein. Although such hopes were not frustrated, still\r\na whole year was spent before they received any profits from the mine;\r\nwhereby many became discouraged and did not persevere in paying\r\nexpenses, but sold their shares in the mine; and for this reason, when\r\nat last an abundance of silver was being drawn out, a great change had\r\ntaken place in the ownership of the mine; nay, even the first finder of\r\nthe vein was not in possession of any share in it, and had spent nearly\r\nall the money which he had obtained from the selling of his shares. Then\r\nthis mine yielded such a quantity of pure silver as no other mine that\r\nhas existed within our own or our fathers' memories, with the exception\r\nof the St. George at Schneeberg. We, as a shareholder, through the\r\ngoodness of God, have enjoyed the proceeds of this 'God's Gift' since\r\nthe very time when the mine began first to bestow such riches.\" Later on\r\nin the same book he gives the following further information with regard\r\nto these mines:--\"Now if all the individual mines which have proved\r\nfruitful in our own times are weighed in the balance, the one at\r\nAnnaberg, which is known as the _Himmelsch hoz_, surpasses all others.\r\nFor the value of the silver which has been dug out has been estimated at\r\n420,000 Rhenish gulden. Next to this comes the lead mine in\r\nJoachimsthal, whose name is the _Sternen_, from which as much silver has\r\nbeen dug as would be equivalent to 350,000 Rhenish gulden; from the\r\nGottsgaab at Abertham, explained before, the equivalent of 300,000. But\r\nfar before all others within our fathers' memory stands the St. George\r\nof Schneeberg, whose silver has been estimated as being equal to two\r\nmillion Rhenish gulden.\" A Rhenish gulden was about 6.9 shillings, or,\r\nsay, $1.66. However, the ratio value of silver to gold at this period\r\nwas about 11.5 to one, or in other words an ounce of silver was worth\r\nabout a gulden, so that, for purposes of rough calculation, one might\r\nsay that the silver product mentioned in gulden is practically of the\r\nsame number of ounces of silver. Moreover, it must be remembered that\r\nthe purchasing power of money was vastly greater then.\r\n\r\n[10] The following passage occurs in the _Nuetzlich Bergbuechlin_ (Chap.\r\nV.), which is interesting on account of the great similarity to\r\nAgricola's quotation:--\"The best position of the stream is when it has a\r\ncliff beside it on the north and level ground on the south, but its\r\ncurrent should be from east to west--that is the most suitable. The next\r\nbest after this is from west to east, with the same position of the\r\nrocks as already stated. The third in order is when the stream flows\r\nfrom north to south with rocks toward the east, but the worst flow of\r\nwater for the preparation of gold is from south to north if a rock or\r\nhill rises toward the west.\" Calbus was probably the author of this\r\nbooklet.\r\n\r\n[11] Albertus Magnus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third book has explained the various and manifold varieties of veins\r\nand stringers. This fourth book will deal with mining areas and the\r\nmethod of delimiting them, and will then pass on to the officials who\r\nare connected with mining affairs[1].\r\n\r\nNow the miner, if the vein he has uncovered is to his liking, first of\r\nall goes to the _Bergmeister_ to request to be granted a right to mine,\r\nthis official's special function and office being to adjudicate in\r\nrespect of the mines. And so to the first man who has discovered the\r\nvein the _Bergmeister_ awards the head meer, and to others the remaining\r\nmeers, in the order in which each makes his application. The size of a\r\nmeer is measured by fathoms, which for miners are reckoned at six feet\r\neach. The length, in fact, is that of a man's extended arms and hands\r\nmeasured across his chest; but different peoples assign to it different\r\nlengths, for among the Greeks, who called it an [Greek: orguia], it was\r\nsix feet, among the Romans five feet. So this measure which is used by\r\nminers seems to have come down to the Germans in accordance with the\r\nGreek mode of reckoning. A miner's foot approaches very nearly to the\r\nlength of a Greek foot, for it exceeds it by only three-quarters of a\r\nGreek digit, but like that of the Romans it is divided into twelve\r\n_unciae_[2].\r\n\r\n[Illustration 79a (Square with lengths and area): Shape of a Square\r\nMeer.]\r\n\r\nNow square fathoms are reckoned in units of one, two, three, or more\r\n\"measures\", and a \"measure\" is seven fathoms each way. Mining meers are\r\nfor the most part either square or elongated; in square meers all the\r\nsides are of equal length, therefore the numbers of fathoms on the two\r\nsides multiplied together produce the total in square fathoms. Thus, if\r\nthe shape of a \"measure\" is seven fathoms on every side, this number\r\nmultiplied by itself makes forty-nine square fathoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 79b (Rectangle with lengths and area): Shape of a Long\r\nMeer or Double Measure.]\r\n\r\nThe sides of a long meer are of equal length, and similarly its ends are\r\nequal; therefore, if the number of fathoms in one of the long sides be\r\nmultiplied by the number of fathoms in one of the ends, the total\r\nproduced by the multiplication is the total number of square fathoms in\r\nthe long meer. For example, the double measure is fourteen fathoms long\r\nand seven broad, which two numbers multiplied together make ninety-eight\r\nsquare fathoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 79c (Rectangle with lengths and area): Shape of a Head\r\nMeer.]\r\n\r\nSince meers vary in shape according to the different varieties of veins\r\nit is necessary for me to go more into detail concerning them and their\r\nmeasurements. If the vein is a _vena profunda_, the head meer is\r\ncomposed of three double measures, therefore it is forty-two fathoms in\r\nlength and seven in width, which numbers multiplied together give two\r\nhundred and ninety-four square fathoms, and by these limits the\r\n_Bergmeister_ bounds the owner's rights in a head-meer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 80a (Rectangle with lengths and area): Shape of a Meer.]\r\n\r\nThe area of every other meer consists of two double measures, on\r\nwhichever side of the head meer it lies, or whatever its number in order\r\nmay be, that is to say, whether next to the head meer, or second, third,\r\nor any later number. Therefore, it is twenty-eight fathoms long and\r\nseven wide, so multiplying the length by the width we get one hundred\r\nand ninety-six square fathoms, which is the extent of the meer, and by\r\nthese boundaries the _Bergmeister_ defines the right of the owner or\r\ncompany over each mine.\r\n\r\nNow we call that part of the vein which is first discovered and mined,\r\nthe head-meer, because all the other meers run from it, just as the\r\nnerves from the head. The _Bergmeister_ begins his measurements from it,\r\nand the reason why he apportions a larger area to the head-meer than to\r\nthe others, is that he may give a suitable reward to the one who first\r\nfound the vein and may encourage others to search for veins. Since meers\r\noften reach to a torrent, or river, or stream, if the last meer cannot\r\nbe completed it is called a fraction[3]. If it is the size of a double\r\nmeasure, the _Bergmeister_ grants the right of mining it to him who\r\nmakes the first application, but if it is the size of a single measure\r\nor a little over, he divides it between the nearest meers on either side\r\nof it. It is the custom among miners that the first meer beyond a stream\r\non that part of the vein on the opposite side is a new head-meer, and\r\nthey call it the \"opposite,\"[4] while the other meers beyond are only\r\nordinary meers. Formerly every head-meer was composed of three double\r\nmeasures and one single one, that is, it was forty-nine fathoms long and\r\nseven wide, and so if we multiply these two together we have three\r\nhundred and forty-three square fathoms, which total gives us the area of\r\nan ancient head-meer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 80b (Rectangle with lengths and area): Shape of an ancient\r\nHead-Meer.]\r\n\r\nEvery ancient meer was formed of a single measure, that is to say, it\r\nwas seven fathoms in length and width, and was therefore square. In\r\nmemory of which miners even now call the width of every meer which is\r\nlocated on a _vena profunda_ a \"square\"[5]. The following was formerly\r\nthe usual method of delimiting a vein: as soon as the miner found\r\nmetal, he gave information to the _Bergmeister_ and the tithe-gatherer,\r\nwho either proceeded personally from the town to the mountains, or sent\r\nthither men of good repute, at least two in number, to inspect the\r\nmetal-bearing vein. Thereupon, if they thought it of sufficient\r\nimportance to survey, the _Bergmeister_ again having gone forth on an\r\nappointed day, thus questioned him who first found the vein, concerning\r\nthe vein and the diggings: \"Which is your vein?\" \"Which digging carried\r\nmetal?\" Then the discoverer, pointing his finger to his vein and\r\ndiggings, indicated them, and next the _Bergmeister_ ordered him to\r\napproach the windlass and place two fingers of his right hand upon his\r\nhead, and swear this oath in a clear voice: \"I swear by God and all the\r\nSaints, and I call them all to witness, that this is my vein; and\r\nmoreover if it is not mine, may neither this my head nor these my hands\r\nhenceforth perform their functions.\" Then the _Bergmeister_, having\r\nstarted from the centre of the windlass, proceeded to measure the vein\r\nwith a cord, and to give the measured portion to the discoverer,--in the\r\nfirst instance a half and then three full measures; afterward one to the\r\nKing or Prince, another to his Consort, a third to the Master of the\r\nHorse, a fourth to the Cup-bearer, a fifth to the Groom of the Chamber,\r\na sixth to himself. Then, starting from the other side of the windlass,\r\nhe proceeded to measure the vein in a similar manner. Thus the\r\ndiscoverer of the vein obtained the head-meer, that is, seven single\r\nmeasures; but the King or Ruler, his Consort, the leading dignitaries,\r\nand lastly, the _Bergmeister_, obtained two measures each, or two\r\nancient meers. This is the reason there are to be found at Freiberg in\r\nMeissen so many shafts with so many intercommunications on a single\r\nvein--which are to a great extent destroyed by age. If, however, the\r\n_Bergmeister_ had already fixed the boundaries of the meers on one side\r\nof the shaft for the benefit of some other discoverer, then for those\r\ndignitaries I have just mentioned, as many meers as he was unable to\r\naward on that side he duplicated on the other. But if on both sides of\r\nthe shaft he had already defined the boundaries of meers, he proceeded\r\nto measure out only that part of the vein which remained free, and thus\r\nit sometimes happened that some of those persons I have mentioned\r\nobtained no meer at all. To-day, though that old-established custom is\r\nobserved, the method of allotting the vein and granting title has been\r\nchanged. As I have explained above, the head-meer consists of three\r\ndouble measures, and each other meer of two measures, and the\r\n_Bergmeister_ grants one each of the meers to him who makes the first\r\napplication. The King or Prince, since all metal is taxed, is himself\r\ncontent with that, which is usually one-tenth.\r\n\r\nOf the width of every meer, whether old or new, one-half lies on the\r\nfootwall side of a _vena profunda_ and one half on the hangingwall side.\r\nIf the vein descends vertically into the earth, the boundaries similarly\r\ndescend vertically; but if the vein inclines, the boundaries likewise\r\nwill be inclined. The owner always holds the mining right for the width\r\nof the meer, however far the vein descends into the depth of the\r\nearth.[6] Further, the _Bergmeister_, on application being made to him,\r\ngrants to one owner or company a right over not only the head meer, or\r\nanother meer, but also the head meer and the next meer or two adjoining\r\nmeers. So much for the shape of meers and their dimensions in the case\r\nof a _vena profunda_.\r\n\r\nI now come to the case of _venae dilatatae_. The boundaries of the areas\r\non such veins are not all measured by one method. For in some places\r\nthe _Bergmeister_ gives them shapes similar to the shapes of the meers\r\non _venae profundae_, in which case the head-meer is composed of three\r\ndouble measures, and the area of every other mine of two measures, as I\r\nhave explained more fully above. In this case, however, he measures the\r\nmeers with a cord, not only forward and backward from the ends of the\r\nhead-meer, as he is wont to do in the case where the owner of a _vena\r\nprofunda_ has a meer granted him, but also from the sides. In this way\r\nmeers are marked out when a torrent or some other force of Nature has\r\nlaid open a _vena dilatata_ in a valley, so that it appears either on\r\nthe slope of a mountain or hill or on a plain. Elsewhere the\r\n_Bergmeister_ doubles the width of the head-meer and it is made fourteen\r\nfathoms wide, while the width of each of the other meers remains single,\r\nthat is seven fathoms, but the length is not defined by boundaries. In\r\nsome places the head-meer consists of three double measures, but has a\r\nwidth of fourteen fathoms and a length of twenty-one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 86a (Rectangle with lengths): Shape of a Head-Meer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 86b (Square with lengths): Shape of every other Meer.]\r\n\r\nIn the same way, every other meer is composed of two measures, doubled\r\nin the same fashion, so that it is fourteen fathoms in width and of the\r\nsame length.\r\n\r\nElsewhere every meer, whether a head-meer or other meer, comprises\r\nforty-two fathoms in width and as many in length.\r\n\r\nIn other places the _Bergmeister_ gives the owner or company all of some\r\nlocality defined by rivers or little valleys as boundaries. But the\r\nboundaries of every such area of whatsoever shape it be, descend\r\nvertically into the earth; so the owner of that area has a right over\r\nthat part of any _vena dilatata_ which lies beneath the first one, just\r\nas the owner of the meer on a _vena profunda_ has a right over so great\r\na part of all other _venae profundae_ as lies within the boundaries of\r\nhis meer; for just as wherever one _vena profunda_ is found, another is\r\nfound not far away, so wherever one _vena dilatata_ is found, others are\r\nfound beneath it.\r\n\r\nFinally, the _Bergmeister_ divides _vena cumulata_ areas in different\r\nways, for in some localities the head-meer is composed of three\r\nmeasures, doubled in such a way that it is fourteen fathoms wide and\r\ntwenty-one long; and every other meer consists of two measures doubled,\r\nand is square, that is, fourteen fathoms wide and as many long. In some\r\nplaces the head-meer is composed of three single measures, and its width\r\nis seven fathoms and its length twenty-one, which two numbers multiplied\r\ntogether make one hundred and forty-seven square fathoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 87 (Rectangle with lengths and area): Shape of a\r\nHead-Meer.]\r\n\r\nEach other meer consists of one double measure. In some places the\r\nhead-meer is given the shape of a double measure, and every other meer\r\nthat of a single measure. Lastly, in other places the owner or a company\r\nis given a right over some complete specified locality bounded by little\r\nstreams, valleys, or other limits. Furthermore, all meers on _venae\r\ncumulatae_, as in the case of _dilatatae_, descend vertically into the\r\ndepths of the earth, and each meer has the boundaries so determined as\r\nto prevent disputes arising between the owners of neighbouring mines.\r\n\r\nThe boundary marks in use among miners formerly consisted only of\r\nstones, and from this their name was derived, for now the marks of a\r\nboundary are called \"boundary stones.\" To-day a row of posts, made\r\neither of oak or pine, and strengthened at the top with iron rings to\r\nprevent them from being damaged, is fixed beside the boundary stones to\r\nmake them more conspicuous. By this method in former times the\r\nboundaries of the fields were marked by stones or posts, not only as\r\nwritten of in the book \"_De Limitibus Agrorum_,\"[7] but also as\r\ntestified to by the songs of the poets. Such then is the shape of the\r\nmeers, varying in accordance with the different kinds of veins.\r\n\r\nNow tunnels are of two sorts, one kind having no right of property, the\r\nother kind having some limited right. For when a miner in some\r\nparticular locality is unable to open a vein on account of a great\r\nquantity of water, he runs a wide ditch, open at the top and three feet\r\ndeep, starting on the slope and running up to the place where the vein\r\nis found. Through it the water flows off, so that the place is made dry\r\nand fit for digging. But if it is not sufficiently dried by this open\r\nditch, or if a shaft which he has now for the first time begun to sink\r\nis suffering from overmuch water, he goes to the _Bergmeister_ and asks\r\nthat official to give him the right for a tunnel. Having obtained leave,\r\nhe drives the tunnel, and into its drains all the water is diverted, so\r\nthat the place or shaft is made fit for digging. If it is not seven\r\nfathoms from the surface of the earth to the bottom of this kind of\r\ntunnel, the owner possesses no rights except this one: namely, that the\r\nowners of the mines, from whose leases the owner of the tunnel extracts\r\ngold or silver, themselves pay him the sum he expends within their meer\r\nin driving the tunnel through it.\r\n\r\nTo a depth or height of three and a half fathoms above and below the\r\nmouth of the tunnel, no one is allowed to begin another tunnel. The\r\nreason for this is that this kind of a tunnel is liable to be changed\r\ninto the other kind which has a complete right of property, when it\r\ndrains the meers to a depth of seven fathoms, or to ten, according as\r\nthe old custom in each place acquires the force of law. In such case\r\nthis second kind of tunnel has the following right; in the first place,\r\nwhatever metal the owner, or company owning it, finds in any meer\r\nthrough which it is driven, all belongs to the tunnel owner within a\r\nheight or depth of one and a quarter fathoms. In the years which are not\r\nlong passed, the owner of a tunnel possessed all the metal which a miner\r\nstanding at the bottom of the tunnel touched with a bar, whose handle\r\ndid not exceed the customary length; but nowadays a certain prescribed\r\nheight and width is allowed to the owner of the tunnel, lest the owners\r\nof the mines be damaged, if the length of the bar be longer than usual.\r\nFurther, every metal-yielding mine which is drained and supplied with\r\nventilation by a tunnel, is taxed in the proportion of one-ninth for the\r\nbenefit of the owner of the tunnel. But if several tunnels of this kind\r\nare driven through one mining area which is yielding metals, and all\r\ndrain it and supply it with ventilation, then of the metal which is dug\r\nout from above the bottom of each tunnel, one-ninth is given to the\r\nowner of that tunnel; of that which is dug out below the bottom of each\r\ntunnel, one-ninth is in each case given to the owner of the tunnel which\r\nfollows next in order below. But if the lower tunnel does not yet drain\r\nthe shaft of that meer nor supply it with ventilation, then of the metal\r\nwhich is dug out below the bottom of the higher tunnel, one-ninth part\r\nis given to the owner of such upper tunnel. Moreover, no one tunnel\r\ndeprives another of its right to one-ninth part, unless it be a lower\r\none, from the bottom of which to the bottom of the one above must not be\r\nless than seven or ten fathoms, according as the king or prince has\r\ndecreed. Further, of all the money which the owner of the tunnel has\r\nspent on his tunnel while driving it through a meer, the owner of that\r\nmeer pays one-fourth part. If he does not do so he is not allowed to\r\nmake use of the drains.\r\n\r\nFinally, with regard to whatever veins are discovered by the owner at\r\nwhose expense the tunnel is driven, the right of which has not been\r\nalready awarded to anyone, on the application of such owner the\r\n_Bergmeister_ grants him a right of a head-meer, or of a head-meer\r\ntogether with the next meer. Ancient custom gives the right for a tunnel\r\nto be driven in any direction for an unlimited length. Further, to-day\r\nhe who commences a tunnel is given, on his application, not only the\r\nright over the tunnel, but even the head and sometimes the next meer\r\nalso. In former days the owner of the tunnel obtained only so much\r\nground as an arrow shot from the bow might cover, and he was allowed to\r\npasture cattle therein. In a case where the shafts of several meers on\r\nsome vein could not be worked on account of the great quantity of water,\r\nancient custom also allowed the _Bergmeister_ to grant the right of a\r\nlarge meer to anyone who would drive a tunnel. When, however, he had\r\ndriven a tunnel as far as the old shafts and had found metal, he used to\r\nreturn to the _Bergmeister_ and request him to bound and mark off the\r\nextent of his right to a meer. Thereupon, the _Bergmeister_, together\r\nwith a certain number of citizens of the town--in whose place Jurors\r\nhave now succeeded--used to proceed to the mountain and mark off with\r\nboundary stones a large meer, which consisted of seven double measures,\r\nthat is to say, it was ninety-eight fathoms long and seven wide, which\r\ntwo numbers multiplied together make six hundred and eighty-six square\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 89 (Rectangle with lengths and area): Large Area.]\r\n\r\nBut each of these early customs has been changed, and we now employ the\r\nnew method.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of tunnels; I will now speak about the division of\r\nownership in mines and tunnels. One owner is allowed to possess and to\r\nwork one, two, three, or more whole meers, or similarly one or more\r\nseparate tunnels, provided he conforms to the decrees of the laws\r\nrelating to metals, and to the orders of the _Bergmeister_. And because\r\nhe alone provides the expenditure of money on the mines, if they yield\r\nmetal he alone obtains the product from them. But when large and\r\nfrequent expenditures are necessary in mining, he to whom the\r\n_Bergmeister_ first gave the right often admits others to share with\r\nhim, and they join with him in forming a company, and they each lay out\r\na part of the expense and share with him the profit or loss of the mine.\r\nBut the title of the mines or tunnels remains undivided, although for\r\nthe purpose of dividing the expense and profit it may be said each mine\r\nor tunnel is divided into parts[8].\r\n\r\nThis division is made in various ways. A mine, and the same thing must\r\nbe understood with regard to a tunnel, may be divided into two halves,\r\nthat is into two similar portions, by which method two owners spend an\r\nequal amount on it and draw an equal profit from it, for each possesses\r\none half. Sometimes it is divided into four shares, by which compact\r\nfour persons can be owners, so that each possesses one-fourth, or also\r\ntwo persons, so that one possesses three-fourths, and the other only\r\none-fourth; or three owners, so that the first has two-fourths, and the\r\nsecond and third one-fourth each. Sometimes it is divided into eight\r\nshares, by which plan there may be eight owners, so that each is\r\npossessor of one-eighth; sometimes there are two owners, so that one has\r\nfive-sixths[9] together with one twenty-fourth, and the other\r\none-eighth; or there may be three owners, in which one has\r\nthree-quarters and the second and third each one-eighth; or it may be\r\ndivided so that one owner has seven-twelfths, together with one\r\ntwenty-fourth, a second owner has one-quarter, and a third owner has\r\none-eighth; or so that the first has one-half, the second one-third and\r\none twenty-fourth, and the third one-eighth; or so that the first has\r\none-half, as before, and the second and third each one-quarter; or so\r\nthat the first and second each have one-third and one twenty-fourth, and\r\nthe third one-quarter; and in the same way the divisions may be adjusted\r\nin all the other proportions. The different ways of dividing the shares\r\noriginate from the different proportions of ownership. Sometimes a mine\r\nis divided into sixteen parts, each of which is a twenty-fourth and a\r\nforty-eighth; or it may be divided into thirty-two parts, each of which\r\nis a forty-eighth and half a seventy-second and a two hundred and\r\neighty-eighth; or into sixty-four parts of which each share is one\r\nseventy-second and one five hundred and seventy-sixth; or finally, into\r\none hundred and twenty-eight parts, any one of which is half a\r\nseventy-second and half of one five hundred and seventy-sixth.\r\n\r\nNow an iron mine either remains undivided or is divided into two, four,\r\nor occasionally more shares, which depends on the excellence of the\r\nveins. But a lead, bismuth, or tin mine, and likewise one of copper or\r\neven quicksilver, is also divided into eight shares, or into sixteen or\r\nthirty-two, and less commonly into sixty-four. The number of the\r\ndivisions of the silver mines at Freiberg in Meissen did not formerly\r\nprogress beyond this; but within the memory of our fathers, miners have\r\ndivided a silver mine, and similarly the tunnel at Schneeberg, first of\r\nall into one hundred and twenty-eight shares, of which one hundred and\r\ntwenty-six are the property of private owners in the mines or tunnels,\r\none belongs to the State and one to the Church; while in Joachimsthal\r\nonly one hundred and twenty-two shares of the mines or tunnels are the\r\nproperty of private owners, four are proprietary shares, and the State\r\nand Church each have one in the same way. To these there has lately been\r\nadded in some places one share for the most needy of the population,\r\nwhich makes one hundred and twenty-nine shares. It is only the private\r\nowners of mines who pay contributions. A proprietary holder, though he\r\nholds as many as four shares such as I have described, does not pay\r\ncontributions, but gratuitiously supplies the owners of the mines with\r\nsufficient wood from his forests for timbering, machinery, buildings,\r\nand smelting; nor do those belonging to the State, Church, and the poor\r\npay contributions, but the proceeds are used to build or repair public\r\nworks and sacred buildings, and to support the most needy with the\r\nprofits which they draw from the mines. Furthermore, in our State, the\r\none hundred and twenty-eighth share has begun to be divided into two,\r\nfour, or eight parts, or even into three, six, twelve, or smaller parts.\r\nThis is done when one mine is created out of two, for then the owner who\r\nformerly possessed one-half becomes owner of one-fourth; he who\r\npossessed one-fourth, of one-eighth; he who possessed one-third, of\r\none-sixth; he who possessed one-sixth, of one-twelfth. Since our\r\ncountrymen call a mine a _symposium_, that is, a drinking bout, we are\r\naccustomed to call the money which the owners subscribe a _symbolum_, or\r\na contribution[10]. For, just as those who go to a banquet (_symposium_)\r\ngive contributions (_symbola_), so those who purpose making large\r\nprofits from mining are accustomed to contribute toward the expenditure.\r\nHowever, the manager of the mine assesses the contributions of the\r\nowners annually, or for the most part quarterly, and as often he renders\r\nan account of receipts and expenses. At Freiberg in Meissen the old\r\npractice was for the manager to exact a contribution from the owners\r\nevery week, and every week to distribute among them the profits of the\r\nmines, but this practice during almost the last fifteen years has been\r\nso far changed that contribution and distribution are made four[11]\r\ntimes each year. Large or small contributions are imposed according to\r\nthe number of workmen which the mine or tunnel requires; as a result,\r\nthose who possess many shares provide many contributions. Four times a\r\nyear the owners contribute to the cost, and four times during the year\r\nthe profits of the mines are distributed among them; these are sometimes\r\nlarge, sometimes small, according as there is more or less gold or\r\nsilver or other metal dug out. Indeed, from the St. George mine in\r\nSchneeberg the miners extracted so much silver in a quarter of a year\r\nthat silver cakes, which were worth 1,100 Rhenish guldens, were\r\ndistributed to each one hundred and twenty-eighth share. From the\r\nAnnaberg mine which is known as the Himmelisch Hoez, they had a dole of\r\neight hundred thaler; from a mine in Joachimsthal which is named the\r\nSternen, three hundred thaler; from the head mine at Abertham, which is\r\ncalled St. Lorentz, two hundred and twenty-five thaler[12]. The more\r\nshares of which any individual is owner the more profits he takes.\r\n\r\nI will now explain how the owners may lose or obtain the right over a\r\nmine, or a tunnel, or a share. Formerly, if anyone was able to prove by\r\nwitnesses that the owners had failed to send miners for three continuous\r\nshifts[13], the _Bergmeister_ deprived them of their right over the\r\nmine, and gave the right over it to the informer, if he desired it. But\r\nalthough miners preserve this custom to-day, still mining share owners\r\nwho have paid their contributions do not lose their right over their\r\nmines against their will. Formerly, if water which had not been drawn\r\noff from the higher shaft of some mine percolated through a vein or\r\nstringer into the shaft of another mine and impeded their work, then the\r\nowners of the mine which suffered the damage went to the _Bergmeister_\r\nand complained of the loss, and he sent to the shafts two Jurors. If\r\nthey found that matters were as claimed, the right over the mine which\r\ncaused the injury was given to the owners who suffered the injury. But\r\nthis custom in certain places has been changed, for the _Bergmeister_,\r\nif he finds this condition of things proved in the case of two shafts,\r\norders the owners of the shaft which causes the injury to contribute\r\npart of the expense to the owners of the shaft which receives the\r\ninjury; if they fail to do so, he then deprives them of their right over\r\ntheir mine; on the other hand, if the owners send men to the workings to\r\ndig and draw off the water from the shafts, they keep their right over\r\ntheir mine. Formerly owners used to obtain a right over any tunnel,\r\nfirstly, if in its bottom they made drains and cleansed them of mud and\r\nsand so that the water might flow out without any hindrance, and\r\nrestored those drains which had been damaged; secondly, if they provided\r\nshafts or openings to supply the miners with air, and restored those\r\nwhich had fallen in; and finally, if three miners were employed\r\ncontinuously in driving the tunnel. But the principal reason for losing\r\nthe title to a tunnel was that for a period of eight days no miner was\r\nemployed upon it; therefore, when anyone was able to prove by witnesses\r\nthat the owners of a tunnel had not done these things, he brought his\r\naccusation before the _Bergmeister_, who, after going out from the town\r\nto the tunnel and inspecting the drains and the ventilating machines and\r\neverything else, and finding the charge to be true, placed the witness\r\nunder oath, and asked him: \"Whose tunnel is this at the present time?\"\r\nThe witness would reply: \"The King's\" or \"The Prince's.\" Thereupon the\r\n_Bergmeister_ gave the right over the tunnel to the first applicant.\r\nThis was the severe rule under which the owners at one time lost their\r\nrights over a tunnel; but its severity is now considerably mitigated,\r\nfor the owners do not now forthwith lose their right over a tunnel\r\nthrough not having cleaned out the drains and restored the shafts or\r\nventilation holes which have suffered damage; but the _Bergmeister_\r\norders the tunnel manager to do it, and if he does not obey, the\r\nauthorities fine the tunnel. Also it is sufficient for one miner to be\r\nengaged in driving the tunnel. Moreover, if the owner of a tunnel sets\r\nboundaries at a fixed spot in the rocks and stops driving the tunnel, he\r\nmay obtain a right over it so far as he has gone, provided the drains\r\nare cleaned out and ventilation holes are kept in repair. But any other\r\nowner is allowed to start from the established mark and drive the tunnel\r\nfurther, if he pays the former owners of the tunnel as much money every\r\nthree months as the _Bergmeister_ decides ought to be paid.\r\n\r\nThere remain for discussion, the shares in the mines and tunnels.\r\nFormerly if anybody conveyed these shares to anyone else, and the latter\r\nhad once paid his contribution, the seller[14] was bound to stand by his\r\nbargain, and this custom to-day has the force of law. But if the seller\r\ndenied that the contribution had been paid, while the buyer of the\r\nshares declared that he could prove by witnesses that he had paid his\r\ncontribution to the other proprietors, and a case arose for trial, then\r\nthe evidence of the other proprietors carried more weight than the oath\r\nof the seller. To-day the buyer of the shares proves that he has paid\r\nhis contribution by a document which the mine or tunnel manager always\r\ngives each one; if the buyer has contributed no money there is no\r\nobligation on the seller to keep his bargain. Formerly, as I have said\r\nabove, the proprietors used to contribute money weekly, but now\r\ncontributions are paid four times each year. To-day, if for the space of\r\na month anyone does not take proceedings against the seller of the\r\nshares for the contribution, the right of taking proceedings is lost.\r\nBut when the Clerk has already entered on the register the shares which\r\nhad been conveyed or bought, none of the owners loses his right over the\r\nshare unless the money is not contributed which the manager of the mine\r\nor tunnel has demanded from the owner or his agent. Formerly, if on the\r\napplication of the manager the owner or his agent did not pay, the\r\nmatter was referred to the _Bergmeister_, who ordered the owner or his\r\nagent to make his contribution; then if he failed to contribute for\r\nthree successive weeks, the _Bergmeister_ gave the right to his shares\r\nto the first applicant. To-day this custom is unchanged, for if owners\r\nfail for the space of a month to pay the contributions which the manager\r\nof the mine has imposed on them, on a stated day their names are\r\nproclaimed aloud and struck off the list of owners, in the presence of\r\nthe _Bergmeister_, the Jurors, the Mining Clerk, and the Share Clerk,\r\nand each of such shares is entered on the proscribed list. If, however,\r\non the third, or at latest the fourth day, they pay their contributions\r\nto the manager of the mine or tunnel, and pay the money which is due\r\nfrom them to the Share Clerk, he removes their shares from the\r\nproscribed list. They are not thereupon restored to their former\r\nposition unless the other owners consent; in which respect the custom\r\nnow in use differs from the old practice, for to-day if the owners of\r\nshares constituting anything over half the mine consent to the\r\nrestoration of those who have been proscribed, the others are obliged to\r\nconsent whether they wish to or not. Formerly, unless such restoration\r\nhad been sanctioned by the approval of the owners of one hundred shares,\r\nthose who had been proscribed were not restored to their former\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe procedure in suits relating to shares was formerly as follows: he\r\nwho instituted a suit and took legal proceedings against another in\r\nrespect of the shares, used to make a formal charge against the accused\r\npossessor before the _Bergmeister_. This was done either at his house or\r\nin some public place or at the mines, once each day for three days if\r\nthe shares belonged to an old mine, and three times in eight days if\r\nthey belonged to a head-meer. But if he could not find the possessor of\r\nthe shares in these places, it was valid and effectual to make the\r\naccusation against him at the house of the _Bergmeister_. When, however,\r\nhe made the charge for the third time, he used to bring with him a\r\nnotary, whom the _Bergmeister_ would interrogate: \"Have I earned the\r\nfee?\" and who would respond: \"You have earned it\"; thereupon the\r\n_Bergmeister_ would give the right over the shares to him who made the\r\naccusation, and the accuser in turn would pay down the customary fee to\r\nthe _Bergmeister_. After these proceedings, if the man whom the\r\n_Bergmeister_ had deprived of his shares dwelt in the city, one of the\r\nproprietors of the mine or of the head-mine was sent to him to acquaint\r\nhim with the facts, but if he dwelt elsewhere proclamation was made in\r\nsome public place, or at the mine, openly and in a loud voice in the\r\nhearing of numbers of miners. Nowadays a date is defined for the one who\r\nis answerable for the debt of shares or money, and information is given\r\nthe accused by an official if he is near at hand, or if he is absent, a\r\nletter is sent him; nor is the right over his shares taken from anyone\r\nfor the space of one and a half months. So much for these matters.\r\n\r\nNow, before I deal with the methods which must be employed in working, I\r\nwill speak of the duties of the Mining Prefect, the _Bergmeister_, the\r\nJurors, the Mining Clerk, the Share Clerk, the manager of the mine or\r\ntunnel, the foreman of the mine or tunnel, and the workmen.\r\n\r\nTo the Mining Prefect, whom the King or Prince appoints as his deputy,\r\nall men of all races, ages, and rank, give obedience and submission. He\r\ngoverns and regulates everything at his discretion, ordering those\r\nthings which are useful and advantageous in mining operations, and\r\nprohibiting those which are to the contrary. He levies penalties and\r\npunishes offenders; he arranges disputes which the _Bergmeister_ has\r\nbeen unable to settle, and if even he cannot arrange them, he allows the\r\nowners who are at variance over some point to proceed to litigation; he\r\neven lays down the law, gives orders as a magistrate, or bids them\r\nleave their rights in abeyance, and he determines the pay of persons who\r\nhold any post or office. He is present in person when the mine managers\r\npresent their quarterly accounts of profits and expenses, and generally\r\nrepresents the King or Prince and upholds his dignity. The Athenians in\r\nthis way set Thucydides, the famous historian, over the mines of\r\nThasos[15].\r\n\r\nNext in power to the Mining Prefect comes the _Bergmeister_, since he\r\nhas jurisdiction over all who are connected with mines, with a few\r\nexceptions, which are the Tithe Gatherer, the Cashier, the Silver\r\nRefiner, the Master of the Mint, and the Coiners themselves. Fraudulent,\r\nnegligent, or dissolute men he either throws into prison, or deprives of\r\npromotion, or fines; of these fines, part is given as a tribute to those\r\nin power. When the mine owners have a dispute over boundaries he\r\narbitrates it; or if he cannot settle the dispute, he pronounces\r\njudgment jointly with the Jurors; from them, however, an appeal lies to\r\nthe Mining Prefect. He transcribes his decrees in a book and sets up the\r\nrecords in public. It is also his duty to grant the right over the mines\r\nto those who apply, and to confirm their rights; he also must measure\r\nthe mines, and fix their boundaries, and see that the mine workings are\r\nnot allowed to become dangerous. Some of these duties he observes on\r\nfixed days; for on Wednesday in the presence of the Jurors he confirms\r\nthe rights over the mines which he has granted, settles disputes about\r\nboundaries, and pronounces judgments. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays,\r\nand Fridays, he rides up to the mines, and dismounting at some of them\r\nexplains what is required to be done, or considers the boundaries which\r\nare under controversy. On Saturday all the mine managers and mine\r\nforemen render an account of the money which they have spent on the\r\nmines during the preceding week, and the Mining Clerk transcribes this\r\naccount into the register of expenses. Formerly, for one Principality\r\nthere was one _Bergmeister_, who used to create all the judges and\r\nexercise jurisdiction and control over them; for every mine had its own\r\njudge, just as to-day each locality has a _Bergmeister_ in his place,\r\nthe name alone being changed. To this ancient _Bergmeister_, who used to\r\ndwell at Freiberg in Meissen, disputes were referred; hence right up to\r\nthe present time the one at Freiberg still has the power of pronouncing\r\njudgment when mine owners who are engaged in disputes among themselves\r\nappeal to him. The old _Bergmeister_ could try everything which was\r\npresented to him in any mine whatsoever; whereas the judge could only\r\ntry the things which were done in his own district, in the same way that\r\nevery modern _Bergmeister_ can.\r\n\r\nTo each _Bergmeister_ is attached a clerk, who writes out a schedule\r\nsignifying to the applicant for a right over a mine, the day and hour on\r\nwhich the right is granted, the name of the applicant, and the location\r\nof the mine. He also affixes at the entrance to the mine, quarterly, at\r\nthe appointed time, a sheet of paper on which is shown how much\r\ncontribution must be paid to the manager of the mine. These notices are\r\nprepared jointly with the Mining Clerk, and in common they receive the\r\nfee rendered by the foremen of the separate mines.\r\n\r\nI now come to the Jurors, who are men experienced in mining matters and\r\nof good repute. Their number is greater or less as there are few or more\r\nmines; thus if there are ten mines there will be five pairs of Jurors,\r\nlike a _decemviral college_[16]. Into however many divisions the total\r\nnumber of mines has been divided, so many divisions has the body of\r\nJurors; each pair of Jurors usually visits some of the mines whose\r\nadministration is under their supervision on every day that workmen are\r\nemployed; it is usually so arranged that they visit all the mines in the\r\nspace of fourteen days. They inspect and consider all details, and\r\ndeliberate and consult with the mine foreman on matters relating to the\r\nunderground workings, machinery, timbering, and everything else. They\r\nalso jointly with the mine foreman from time to time make the price per\r\nfathom to the workmen for mining the ore, fixing it at a high or low\r\nprice, according to whether the rock is hard or soft; if, however, the\r\ncontractors find that an unforeseen and unexpected hardness occurs, and\r\nfor that reason have difficulty and delay in carrying out their work,\r\nthe Jurors allow them something in excess of the price fixed; while if\r\nthere is a softness by reason of water, and the work is done more easily\r\nand quickly, they deduct something from the price. Further, if the\r\nJurors discover manifest negligence or fraud on the part of any foreman\r\nor workman, they first admonish or reprimand him as to his duties and\r\nobligations, and if he does not become more diligent and improve, the\r\nmatter is reported to the _Bergmeister_, who by right of his authority\r\ndeprives such persons of their functions and office, or, if they have\r\ncommitted a crime, throws them into prison. Lastly, because the Jurors\r\nhave been given to the _Bergmeister_ as councillors and advisors, in\r\ntheir absence he does not confirm the right over any mine, nor measure\r\nthe mines, nor fix their boundaries, nor settle disputes about\r\nboundaries, nor pronounce judgment, nor, finally, does he without them\r\nlisten to any account of profits and expenditure.\r\n\r\nNow the Mining Clerk enters each mine in his books, the new mines in one\r\nbook, the old mines which have been re-opened in another. This is done\r\nin the following way: first is written the name of the man who has\r\napplied for the right over the mine, then the day and hour on which he\r\nmade his application, then the vein and the locality in which it is\r\nsituated, next the conditions on which the right has been given, and\r\nlastly, the day on which the _Bergmeister_ confirmed it. A document\r\ncontaining all these particulars is also given to the person whose right\r\nover a mine has been confirmed. The Mining Clerk also sets down in\r\nanother book the names of the owners of each mine over which the right\r\nhas been confirmed; in another any intermission of work permitted to any\r\nperson for certain reasons by the _Bergmeister_; in another the money\r\nwhich one mine supplies to another for drawing off water or making\r\nmachinery; and in another the decisions of the _Bergmeister_ and the\r\nJurors, and the disputes settled by them as honorary arbitrators. All\r\nthese matters he enters in the books on Wednesday of every week; if\r\nholidays fall on that day he does it on the following Thursday. Every\r\nSaturday he enters in another book the total expenses of the preceding\r\nweek, the account of which the mine manager has rendered; but the total\r\nquarterly expenses of each mine manager, he enters in a special book at\r\nhis own convenience. He enters similarly in another book a list of\r\nowners who have been proscribed. Lastly, that no one may be able to\r\nbring a charge of falsification against him, all these books are\r\nenclosed in a chest with two locks, the key of one of which is kept by\r\nthe Mining Clerk, and of the other by the _Bergmeister_.\r\n\r\nThe Share Clerk enters in a book the owners of each mine whom the first\r\nfinder of the vein names to him, and from time to time replaces the\r\nnames of the sellers with those of the buyers of the shares. It\r\nsometimes happens that twenty or more owners come into the possession of\r\nsome particular share. Unless, however, the seller is present, or has\r\nsent a letter to the Mining Clerk with his seal, or better still with\r\nthe seal of the Mayor of the town where he dwells, his name is not\r\nreplaced by that of anyone else; for if the Share Clerk is not\r\nsufficiently cautious, the law requires him to restore the late owner\r\nwholly to his former position. He writes out a fresh document, and in\r\nthis way gives proof of possession. Four times a year, when the accounts\r\nof the quarterly expenditure are rendered, he names the new proprietors\r\nto the manager of each mine, that the manager may know from whom he\r\nshould demand contributions and among whom to distribute the profits of\r\nthe mines. For this work the mine manager pays the Clerk a fixed fee.\r\n\r\nI will now speak of the duties of the mine manager. In the case of the\r\nowners of every mine which is not yielding metal, the manager announces\r\nto the proprietors their contributions in a document which is affixed to\r\nthe doors of the town hall, such contributions being large or small,\r\naccording as the _Bergmeister_ and two Jurors determine. If anyone fails\r\nto pay these contributions for the space of a month, the manager removes\r\ntheir names from the list of owners, and makes their shares the common\r\nproperty of the other proprietors. And so, whomsoever the mine manager\r\nnames as not having paid his contribution, that same man the Mining\r\nClerk designates in writing, and so also does the Share Clerk. Of the\r\ncontribution, the mine manager applies part to the payment of the\r\nforeman and workmen, and lays by a part to purchase at the lowest price\r\nthe necessary things for the mine, such as iron tools, nails, firewood,\r\nplanks, buckets, drawing-ropes, or grease. But in the case of a mine\r\nwhich is yielding metal, the Tithe-gatherer pays the mine manager week\r\nby week as much money as suffices to discharge the workmen's wages and\r\nto provide the necessary implements for mining. The mine manager of each\r\nmine also, in the presence of its foreman, on Saturday in each week\r\nrenders an account of his expenses to the _Bergmeister_ and the Jurors,\r\nhe renders an account of his receipts, whether the money has been\r\ncontributed by the owners or taken from the Tithe-gatherer; and of his\r\nquarterly expenditure in the same way to them and to the Mining Prefect\r\nand to the Mining Clerk, four times a year at the appointed time; for\r\njust as there are four seasons of the year, namely, Spring, Summer,\r\nAutumn, and Winter, so there are fourfold accounts of profits and\r\nexpenses. In the beginning of the first month of each quarter an account\r\nis rendered of the money which the manager has spent on the mine during\r\nthe previous quarter, then of the profit which he has taken from it\r\nduring the same period; for example, the account which is rendered at\r\nthe beginning of spring is an account of all the profits and expenses of\r\neach separate week of winter, which have been entered by the Mining\r\nClerk in the book of accounts. If the manager has spent the money of the\r\nproprietors advantageously in the mine and has faithfully looked after\r\nit, everyone praises him as a diligent and honest man; if through\r\nignorance in these matters he has caused loss, he is generally deprived\r\nof his office; if by his carelessness and negligence the owners have\r\nsuffered loss, the _Bergmeister_ compels him to make good the loss; and\r\nfinally, if he has been guilty of fraud or theft, he is punished with\r\nfine, prison, or death. Further, it is the business of the manager to\r\nsee that the foreman of the mine is present at the beginning and end of\r\nthe shifts, that he digs the ore in an advantageous manner, and makes\r\nthe required timbering, machines, and drains. The manager also makes the\r\ndeductions from the pay of the workmen whom the foreman has noted as\r\nnegligent. Next, if the mine is rich in metal, the manager must see that\r\nits ore-house is closed on those days on which no work is performed; and\r\nif it is a rich vein of gold or silver, he sees that the miners promptly\r\ntransfer the output from the shaft or tunnel into a chest or into the\r\nstrong room next to the house where the foreman dwells, that no\r\nopportunity for theft may be given to dishonest persons. This duty he\r\nshares in common with the foreman, but the one which follows is\r\npeculiarly his own. When ore is smelted he is present in person, and\r\nwatches that the smelting is performed carefully and advantageously. If\r\nfrom it gold or silver is melted out, when it is melted in the\r\ncupellation furnace he enters the weight of it in his books and carries\r\nit to the Tithe-gatherer, who similarly writes a note of its weight in\r\nhis books; it is then conveyed to the refiner. When it has been brought\r\nback, both the Tithe-gatherer and manager again enter its weight in\r\ntheir books. Why again? Because he looks after the goods of the owners\r\njust as if they were his own. Now the laws which relate to mining permit\r\na manager to have charge of more than one mine, but in the case of mines\r\nyielding gold or silver, to have charge of only two. If, however,\r\nseveral mines following the head-mine begin to produce metal, he remains\r\nin charge of these others until he is freed from the duty of looking\r\nafter them by the _Bergmeister_. Last of all, the manager, the\r\n_Bergmeister_, and the two Jurors, in agreement with the owners, settle\r\nthe remuneration for the labourers. Enough of the duties and occupation\r\nof the manager.\r\n\r\nI will now leave the manager, and discuss him who controls the workmen\r\nof the mine, who is therefore called the foreman, although some call him\r\nthe watchman. It is he who distributes the work among the labourers, and\r\nsees diligently that each faithfully and usefully performs his duties.\r\nHe also discharges workmen on account of incompetence, or negligence,\r\nand supplies others in their places if the two Jurors and manager give\r\ntheir consent. He must be skilful in working wood, that he may timber\r\nshafts, place posts, and make underground structures capable of\r\nsupporting an undermined mountain, lest the rocks from the hangingwall\r\nof the veins, not being supported, become detached from the mass of the\r\nmountain and overwhelm the workmen with destruction. He must be able to\r\nmake and lay out the drains in the tunnels, into which the water from\r\nthe veins, stringers, and seams in the rocks may collect, that it may be\r\nproperly guided and can flow away. Further, he must be able to recognize\r\nveins and stringers, so as to sink shafts to the best advantage, and\r\nmust be able to discern one kind of material which is mined from\r\nanother, or to train his subordinates that they may separate the\r\nmaterials correctly. He must also be well acquainted with all methods of\r\nwashing, so as to teach the washers how the metalliferous earth or sand\r\nis washed. He supplies the miners with iron tools when they are about to\r\nstart to work in the mines, and apportions a certain weight of oil for\r\ntheir lamps, and trains them to dig to the best advantage, and sees that\r\nthey work faithfully. When their shift is finished, he takes back the\r\noil which has been left. On account of his numerous and important duties\r\nand labours, only one mine is entrusted to one foreman, nay, rather\r\nsometimes two or three foremen are set over one mine.\r\n\r\nSince I have mentioned the shifts, I will briefly explain how these are\r\ncarried on. The twenty-four hours of a day and night are divided into\r\nthree shifts, and each shift consists of seven hours. The three\r\nremaining hours are intermediate between the shifts, and form an\r\ninterval during which the workmen enter and leave the mines. The first\r\nshift begins at the fourth hour in the morning and lasts till the\r\neleventh hour; the second begins at the twelfth and is finished at the\r\nseventh; these two are day shifts in the morning and afternoon. The\r\nthird is the night shift, and commences at the eighth hour in the\r\nevening and finishes at the third in the morning. The _Bergmeister_ does\r\nnot allow this third shift to be imposed upon the workmen unless\r\nnecessity demands it. In that case, whether they draw water from the\r\nshafts or mine the ore, they keep their vigil by the night lamps, and to\r\nprevent themselves falling asleep from the late hours or from fatigue,\r\nthey lighten their long and arduous labours by singing, which is neither\r\nwholly untrained nor unpleasing. In some places one miner is not allowed\r\nto undertake two shifts in succession, because it often happens that he\r\neither falls asleep in the mine, overcome by exhaustion from too much\r\nlabour, or arrives too late for his shift, or leaves sooner than he\r\nought. Elsewhere he is allowed to do so, because he cannot subsist on\r\nthe pay of one shift, especially if provisions grow dearer. The\r\n_Bergmeister_ does not, however, forbid an extraordinary shift when he\r\nconcedes only one ordinary shift. When it is time to go to work the\r\nsound of a great bell, which the foreigners call a \"campana,\" gives the\r\nworkmen warning, and when this is heard they run hither and thither\r\nthrough the streets toward the mines. Similarly, the same sound of the\r\nbell warns the foreman that a shift has just been finished; therefore as\r\nsoon as he hears it, he stamps on the woodwork of the shaft and signals\r\nthe workmen to come out. Thereupon, the nearest as soon as they hear the\r\nsignal, strike the rocks with their hammers, and the sound reaches those\r\nwho are furthest away. Moreover, the lamps show that the shift has come\r\nto an end when the oil becomes almost consumed and fails them. The\r\nlabourers do not work on Saturdays, but buy those things which are\r\nnecessary to life, nor do they usually work on Sundays or annual\r\nfestivals, but on these occasions devote the shift to holy things.\r\nHowever, the workmen do not rest and do nothing if necessity demands\r\ntheir labour; for sometimes a rush of water compels them to work,\r\nsometimes an impending fall, sometimes something else, and at such times\r\nit is not considered irreligious to work on holidays. Moreover, all\r\nworkmen of this class are strong and used to toil from birth.\r\n\r\nThe chief kinds of workmen are miners, shovellers, windlass men,\r\ncarriers, sorters, washers, and smelters, as to whose duties I will\r\nspeak in the following books, in their proper place. At present it is\r\nenough to add this one fact, that if the workmen have been reported by\r\nthe foreman for negligence, the _Bergmeister_, or even the foreman\r\nhimself, jointly with the manager, dismisses them from their work on\r\nSaturday, or deprives them of part of their pay; or if for fraud, throws\r\nthem into prison. However, the owners of works in which the metals are\r\nsmelted, and the master of the smelter, look after their own men. As to\r\nthe government and duties of miners, I have now said enough; I will\r\nexplain them more fully in another work entitled _De Jure et Legibus\r\nMetallicis_[17].\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The nomenclature in this chapter has given unusual difficulty,\r\nbecause the organisation of mines, either past or present, in\r\nEnglish-speaking countries provides no exact equivalents for many of\r\nthese offices and for many of the legal terms. The Latin terms in the\r\ntext were, of course, coined by the author, and have no historical basis\r\nto warrant their adoption, while the introduction of the original German\r\nterms is open to much objection, as they are not only largely obsolete,\r\nbut also in the main would convey no meaning to the majority of readers.\r\nWe have, therefore, reached a series of compromises, and in the main\r\ngive the nearest English equivalent. Of much interest in this connection\r\nis a curious exotic survival in mining law to be found in the High Peak\r\nof Derbyshire. We believe (see note on p. 85) that the law of this\r\ndistrict was of Saxon importation, for in it are not only many terms of\r\nGerman origin, but the character of the law is foreign to the older\r\nEnglish districts and shows its near kinship to that of Saxony. It is\r\ntherefore of interest in connection with the nomenclature to be adopted\r\nin this book, as it furnishes about the only English precedents in many\r\ncases. The head of the administration in the Peak was the Steward, who\r\nwas the chief judicial officer, with functions somewhat similar to the\r\n_Berghauptmann_. However, the term Steward has come to have so much less\r\nsignificance that we have adopted a literal rendering of the Latin.\r\nUnder the Steward was the Barmaster, Barghmaster, or Barmar, as he was\r\nvariously called, and his duties were similar to those of the\r\n_Bergmeister_. The English term would seem to be a corruption of the\r\nGerman, and as the latter has come to be so well understood by the\r\nEnglish-speaking mining class, we have in this case adopted the German.\r\nThe Barmaster acted always by the consent and with the approval of a\r\njury of from 12 to 24 members. In this instance the English had\r\nfunctions much like a modern jury, while the _Geschwornen_ of Saxony had\r\nmuch more widely extended powers. The German _Geschwornen_ were in the\r\nmain Inspectors; despite this, however, we have not felt justified in\r\nadopting any other than the literal English for the Latin and German\r\nterms. We have vacillated a great deal over the term _Praefectus\r\nFodinae_, the German _Steiger_ having, like the Cornish \"Captain,\" in\r\nthese days degenerated into a foreman, whereas the duties as described\r\nwere not only those of the modern Superintendent or Manager, but also\r\nthose of Treasurer of the Company, for he made the calls on shares and\r\npaid the dividends. The term Purser has been used for centuries in\r\nEnglish mining for the Accountant or Cashier, but his functions were\r\nlimited to paying dividends, wages, etc., therefore we have considered\r\nit better not to adopt the latter term, and have compromised upon the\r\nterm Superintendent or Manager, although it has a distinctly modern\r\nflavor. The word for _area_ has also caused much hesitation, and the\r\n\"meer\" has finally been adopted with some doubt. The title described by\r\nAgricola has a very close equivalent in the meer of old Derbyshire. As\r\nwill be seen later, the mines of Saxony were Regal property, and were\r\nheld subject to two essential conditions, _i.e._, payment of a tithe,\r\nand continuous operation. This form of title thus approximates more\r\nclosely to the \"lease\" of Australia than to the old Cornish _sett_, or\r\nthe American _claim_. The _fundgrube_ of Saxony and Agricola's\r\nequivalent, the _area capitis_--head lease--we have rendered literally\r\nas \"head meer,\" although in some ways \"founders' meer\" might be better,\r\nfor, in Derbyshire, this was called the \"finder's\" or founder's meer,\r\nand was awarded under similar circumstances. It has also an analogy in\r\nAustralian law in the \"reward\" leases. The term \"measure\" has the merit\r\nof being a literal rendering of the Latin, and also of being the\r\nidentical term in the same use in the High Peak. The following table of\r\nthe principal terms gives the originals of the Latin text, their German\r\nequivalents according in the Glossary and other sources, and those\r\nadopted in the translation:--\r\n\r\n     AGRICOLA.

For further notes see Appendix C.\r\n\r\n[3] _Subcisivum_--\"Remainder.\" German Glossary, _Ueberschar_. The term\r\nused in Mendip and Derbyshire was _primgap_ or _primegap_. It did not,\r\nhowever, in this case belong to adjacent mines, but to the landlord.\r\n\r\n[4] _Adversum_. Glossary, _gegendrumb_. The _Bergwerk Lexicon_,\r\nChemnitz, 1743, gives _gegendrom_ or _gegentramm_, and defines it as the\r\n_masse_ or lease next beyond a stream.\r\n\r\n[5] _Quadratum_. Glossary, _vierung_. The _vierung_ in old Saxon title\r\nmeant a definite zone on either side of the vein, 3-1/2 _lachter_\r\n(_lachter_ = 5 ft. 7.5 inches) into the hangingwall and the same into\r\nthe footwall, the length of one _vierung_ being 7 _lachter_ along the\r\nstrike. It must be borne in mind that the form of rights here referred\r\nto entitled the miner to follow his vein, carrying the side line with\r\nhim in depth the same distance from the vein, in much the same way as\r\nwith the Apex Law of the United States. From this definition as given in\r\nthe _Bergwerk Lexicon_, p. 585, it would appear that the vein itself was\r\nnot included in the measurements, but that they started from the walls.\r\n\r\n[6] HISTORICAL NOTE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF MINING LAW.--There is no\r\nbranch of the law of property, of which the development is more\r\ninteresting and illuminating from a social point of view than that\r\nrelating to minerals. Unlike the land, the minerals have ever been\r\nregarded as a sort of fortuitous property, for the title of which there\r\nhave been four principal claimants--that is, the Overlord, as\r\nrepresented by the King, Prince, Bishop, or what not; the Community or\r\nthe State, as distinguished from the Ruler; the Landowner; and the Mine\r\nOperator, to which class belongs the Discoverer. The one of these that\r\npossessed the dominant right reflects vividly the social state and\r\nsentiment of the period. The Divine Right of Kings; the measure of\r\nfreedom of their subjects; the tyranny of the land-owning class; the\r\nrights of the Community as opposed to its individual members; the rise\r\nof individualism; and finally, the modern return to more communal view,\r\nhave all been reflected promptly in the mineral title. Of these parties\r\nthe claims of the Overlord have been limited only by the resistance of\r\nhis subjects; those of the State limited by the landlord; those of the\r\nlandlord by the Sovereign or by the State; while the miner, ever in a\r\nminority in influence as well as in numbers, has been buffeted from\r\npillar to post, his only protection being the fact that all other\r\nparties depended upon his exertion and skill.\r\n\r\nThe conception as to which of these classes had a right in the title\r\nhave been by no means the same in different places at the same time, and\r\nin all it varies with different periods; but the whole range of\r\nlegislation indicates the encroachment of one factor in the community\r\nover another, so that their relative rights have been the cause of\r\nnever-ending contention, ever since a record of civil and economic\r\ncontentions began. In modern times, practically over the whole world,\r\nthe State has in effect taken the rights from the Overlord, but his\r\nclaims did not cease until his claims over the bodies of his subjects\r\nalso ceased. However, he still remains in many places with his picture\r\non the coinage. The Landlord has passed through many vicissitudes; his\r\ncomplete right to minerals was practically never admitted until the\r\ndoctrine of _laissez-faire_ had become a matter of faith, and this just\r\nin time to vest him with most of the coal and iron deposits in the\r\nworld; this, no doubt, being also partially due to the little regard in\r\nwhich such deposits were generally held at that time, and therefore to\r\nthe little opposition to his ever-ready pretentions. Their numbers,\r\nhowever, and their prominence in the support of the political powers _de\r\njure_ have usually obtained them some recognition. In the rise of\r\nindividualism, the apogee of the _laissez-faire_ fetish came about the\r\ntime of the foundation of the United States, and hence the relaxation in\r\nthe claims of the State in that country and the corresponding position\r\nattained by the landlord and miner. The discoverer and the\r\noperator--that is, the miner himself--has, however, had to be reckoned\r\nwith by all three of the other claimants, because they have almost\r\nuniversally sought to escape the risks of mining, to obtain the most\r\nskilful operation, and to stimulate the productivity of the mines;\r\nthereupon the miner has secured at least partial consideration. This\r\nstands out in all times and all places, and while the miner has had to\r\ntake the risks of his fortuitous calling, the Overlord, State, or\r\nLandlord have all made for complacent safety by demanding some kind of a\r\ntithe on his exertions. Moreover, there has often been a low cunning\r\ndisplayed by these powers in giving something extra to the first\r\ndiscoverer. In these relations of the powers to the mine operator, from\r\nthe very first we find definite records of the imposition of certain\r\nconditions with extraordinary persistence--so fixed a notion that even\r\nthe United States did not quite escape it. This condition was, no doubt,\r\ndesigned as a stimulus to productive activity, and was the requirement\r\nthat the miner should continuously employ himself digging in the piece\r\nof ground allotted to him. The Greeks, Romans, Mediaeval Germans, old and\r\nmodern Englishmen, modern Australians, all require the miner to keep\r\ncontinuously labouring at his mines, or lose his title. The American, as\r\nhis inauguration of government happened when things were easier for\r\nindividuals, allows him a vacation of 11 months in the year for a few\r\nyears, and finally a holiday altogether. There are other points where\r\nthe Overlord, the State, or the Landlord have always considered that\r\nthey had a right to interfere, principally as to the way the miner does\r\nhis work, lest he should miss, or cause to be missed, some of the\r\nmineral; so he has usually been under pains and penalties as to his\r\nmethods--these quite apart from the very proper protection to human\r\nlife, which is purely a modern invention, largely of the miner himself.\r\nSomebody has had to keep peace and settle disputes among the usually\r\nturbulent miners (for what other sort of operators would undertake the\r\nhazards and handicaps?), and therefore special officials and codes, or\r\nCourts, for his benefit are of the oldest and most persistent of\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nBetween the Overlord and the Landowner the fundamental conflict of view\r\nas to their respective rights has found its interpretation in the form\r\nof the mineral title. The Overlord claimed the metals as distinguished\r\nfrom the land, while the landowner claimed all beneath his soil.\r\nTherefore, we find two forms of title--that in which the miner could\r\nfollow the ore regardless of the surface (the \"apex\" conception), and\r\nthat in which the boundaries were vertical from the land surface. Lest\r\nthe Americans think that the Apex Law was a sin original to themselves,\r\nwe may mention that it was made use of in Europe a few centuries before\r\nAgricola, who will be found to set it out with great precision.\r\n\r\nFrom these points of view, more philosophical than legal, we present a\r\nfew notes on various ancient laws of mines, though space forbids a\r\ndiscussion of a tithe of the amount it deserves at some experienced\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nOf the Ancient Egyptian, Lydian, Assyrian, Persian, Indian, and Chinese\r\nlaws as to mines we have no record, but they were of great simplicity,\r\nfor the bodies as well as the property of subjects were at the abject\r\ndisposition of the Overlord. We are informed on countless occasions of\r\nEmperors, Kings, and Princes of various degree among these races, owning\r\nand operating mines with convicts, soldiers, or other slaves, so we may\r\ntake it for certain that continuous labour was enforced, and that the\r\nboundaries, inspection, and landlords did not cause much anxiety.\r\nHowever, herein lies the root of regalian right.\r\n\r\nOur first glimpse of a serious right of the subject to mines is among\r\nsome of the Greek States, as could be expected from their form of\r\ngovernment. With republican ideals, a rich mining district at Mount\r\nLaurion, an enterprising and contentious people, it would be surprising\r\nindeed if Athenian Literature was void on the subject. While we know\r\nthat the active operation of these mines extended over some 500 years,\r\nfrom 700 to 200 B.C., the period of most literary reference was from 400\r\nto 300 B.C. Our information on the subject is from two of Demosthenes'\r\norations--one against Pantaenetus, the other against Phaenippus--the\r\nfirst mining lawsuit in which the address of counsel is extant. There is\r\nalso available some information in Xenophon's Essay upon the Revenues,\r\nAristotle's Constitution of Athens, Lycurgus' prosecution of Diphilos,\r\nthe Tablets of the Poletae, and many incidental references and\r\ninscriptions of minor order. The minerals were the property of the\r\nState, a conception apparently inherited from the older civilizations.\r\nLeases for exploitation were granted to individuals for terms of three\r\nto ten years, depending upon whether the mines had been previously\r\nworked, thus a special advantage was conferred upon the pioneer. The\r\nleases did not carry surface rights, but the boundaries at Mt. Laurion\r\nwere vertical, as necessarily must be the case everywhere in horizontal\r\ndeposits. What they were elsewhere we do not know. The landlord\r\napparently got nothing. The miner must continuously operate his mine,\r\nand was required to pay a large tribute to the State, either in the\r\ninitial purchase of his lease or in annual rent. There were elaborate\r\nregulations as to interference and encroachment, and proper support of\r\nthe workings. Diphilos was condemned to death and his fortune\r\nconfiscated for robbing pillars. The mines were worked with slaves.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were most intensive miners and searchers after metallic\r\nwealth already mined. The latter was obviously the objective of most\r\nRoman conquest, and those nations rich in these commodities, at that\r\ntime necessarily possessed their own mines. Thus a map showing the\r\nextensions of Empire coincides in an extraordinary manner with the metal\r\ndistribution of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Further, the great\r\nindentations into the periphery of the Imperial map, though many were\r\nrich from an agricultural point of view, had no lure to the Roman\r\nbecause they had no mineral wealth. On the Roman law of mines the\r\nstudent is faced with many perplexities. With the conquest of the older\r\nStates, the plunderers took over the mines and worked them, either by\r\nleases from the State to public companies or to individuals; or even in\r\nsome cases worked them directly by the State. There was thus maintained\r\nthe concept of State ownership of the minerals which, although\r\napparently never very specifically defined, yet formed a basis of\r\nsupport to the contention of regalian rights in Europe later on.\r\nParallel with this system, mines were discovered and worked by\r\nindividuals under tithe to the State, and in Pliny (XXXIV, 49) there is\r\nreference to the miners in Britain limiting their own output. Individual\r\nmining appears to have increased with any relaxation of central\r\nauthority, as for instance under Augustus. It appears, as a rule, that\r\nthe mines were held on terminable leases, and that the State did at\r\ntimes resume them; the labour was mostly slaves. As to the detailed\r\nconditions under which the mine operator held his title, we know less\r\nthan of the Greeks--in fact, practically nothing other than that he paid\r\na tithe. The Romans maintained in each mining district an official--the\r\n_Procurator Metallorum_--who not only had general charge of the leasing\r\nof the mines on behalf of the State, but was usually the magistrate of\r\nthe district. A bronze tablet found near Aljustrel, in Portugal, in\r\n1876, generally known as the Aljustrel Tablet, appears to be the third\r\nof a series setting out the regulations of the mining district. It\r\nrefers mostly to the regulation of public auctions, the baths, barbers,\r\nand tradesmen; but one clause (VII.) is devoted to the regulation of\r\nthose who work dumps of scoria, etc., and provides for payment to the\r\nadministrator of the mines of a _capitation_ on the slaves employed. It\r\ndoes not, however, so far as we can determine, throw any light upon the\r\nactual regulations for working the mines. (Those interested will find\r\nample detail in Jacques Flach, \"_La Table de Bronze d'Aljustrel:\r\nNouvelle Revue Historique de Droit Francais et Etranger_,\" 1878, p. 655;\r\n_Estacio da Veiga, Memorias da Acad. Real das Ciencias de Lisbon, Nova\r\nScrie, Tome V, Part II_, Lisbon, 1882.) Despite the systematic law of\r\nproperty evolved by the Romans, the codes contain but small reference to\r\nmines, and this in itself is indirect evidence of the concept that they\r\nwere the property of the State. Any general freedom of the metals would\r\nhave given rise to a more extensive body of law. There are, of course,\r\nthe well-known sections in the Justinian and Theodosian Codes, but the\r\nformer in the main bears on the collection of the tithe and the\r\nstimulation of mining by ordering migrant miners to return to their own\r\nhearths. There is also some intangible prohibition of mining near\r\nedifices. There is in the Theodosian code evident extension of\r\nindividual right to mine or quarry, and this \"freeing\" of the mines was\r\nlater considerably extended. The Empire was, however, then on the\r\ndecline; and no doubt it was hoped to stimulate the taxable commodities.\r\nThere is nothing very tangible as to the position of the landlord with\r\nregard to minerals found on his property; the metals were probably of\r\ninsufficient frequency on the land of Italian landlords to matter much,\r\nand the attitude toward subject races was not usually such as to require\r\nan extensive body of law.\r\n\r\nIn the chaos of the Middle Ages, Europe was governed by hundreds of\r\npotentates, great and small, who were unanimous on one point, and this\r\nthat the minerals were their property. In the bickerings among\r\nthemselves, the stronger did not hesitate to interpret the Roman law in\r\naffirming regalian rights as an excuse to dispossess the weaker. The\r\nrights to the mines form no small part of the differences between these\r\nPotentates and the more important of their subjects; and with the\r\ngradual accretion of power into a few hands, we find only the most\r\npowerful of vassals able to resist such encroachment. However, as to\r\nwhat position the landlord or miner held in these rights, we have little\r\nindication until about the beginning of the 13th century, after which\r\nthere appear several well-known charters, which as time went on were\r\nelaborated into practical codes of mining law. The earliest of these\r\ncharters are those of the Bishop of Trent, 1185; that of the Harz\r\nMiners, 1219; of the town of Iglau in 1249. Many such in connection with\r\nother districts appear throughout the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries.\r\n(References to the most important of such charters may be found in\r\nSternberg, _Umrisse der Geschichte des Bergbaues_, Prague, 1838;\r\nEisenhart, _De Regali Metalli Fodinarium_, Helmestadt, 1681; Gmelin,\r\n_Beytraege zur Geschichte des Teutschen Bergbaus_, Halle, 1783;\r\nInama-Sternegg, _Deutsche Wirthschaftsgeschichte_, Leipzig, 1879-1901;\r\nTransactions, Royal Geol. Soc. Cornwall VI, 155; Lewis, The Stannaries,\r\nNew York, 1908.) By this time a number of mining communities had grown\r\nup, and the charters in the main are a confirmation to them of certain\r\nprivileges; they contain, nevertheless, rigorous reservation of the\r\nregalian right. The landlord, where present, was usually granted some\r\ninterest in the mine, but had to yield to the miner free entry. The\r\nminer was simply a sort of tributer to the Crown, loaded with an\r\nobligation when upon private lands to pay a further portion of his\r\nprofits to the landlord. He held tenure only during strenuous operation.\r\nHowever, it being necessary to attract skilled men, they were granted\r\nmany civil privileges not general to the people; and from many of the\r\nprincipal mining towns \"free cities\" were created, possessing a measure\r\nof self-government. There appear in the Iglau charter of 1249 the first\r\nsymptoms of the \"apex\" form of title, this being the logical development\r\nof the conception that the minerals were of quite distinct ownership\r\nfrom the land. The law, as outlined by Agricola, is much the same as set\r\nout in the Iglavian Charter of three centuries before, and we must\r\nbelieve that such fully developed conceptions as that charter conveys\r\nwere but the confirmation of customs developed over generations.\r\n\r\nIn France the landlord managed to maintain a stronger position\r\n_vis-a-vis_ with the Crown, despite much assertion of its rights; and as\r\na result, while the landlord admitted the right to a tithe for the\r\nCrown, he maintained the actual possession, and the boundaries were\r\ndefined with the land.\r\n\r\nIn England the law varied with special mining communities, such as\r\nCornwall, Devon, the Forest of Dean, the Forest of Mendip, Alston Moor,\r\nand the High Peak, and they exhibit a curious complex of individual\r\ngrowth, of profound interest to the student of the growth of\r\ninstitutions. These communities were of very ancient origin, some of\r\nthem at least pre-Roman; but we are, except for the reference in Pliny,\r\npractically without any idea of their legal doings until after the\r\nNorman occupation (1066 A.D.). The genius of these conquerors for\r\nsystematic government soon led them to inquire into the doings of these\r\ncommunities, and while gradually systematising their customs into law,\r\nthey lost no occasion to assert the regalian right to the minerals. In\r\nthe two centuries subsequent to their advent there are on record\r\nnumerous inquisitions, with the recognition and confirmation of \"the\r\ncustoms and liberties which had existed from time immemorial,\" always\r\nwith the reservation to the Crown of some sort of royalty. Except for\r\nthe High Peak in Derbyshire, the period and origin of these \"customs and\r\nliberties\" are beyond finding out, as there is practically no record of\r\nEnglish History between the Roman withdrawal and the Norman occupation.\r\nThere may have been \"liberties\" under the Romans, but there is not a\r\nshred of evidence on the subject, and our own belief is that the forms\r\nof self-government which sprang up were the result of the Roman\r\nevacuation. The miner had little to complain of in the Norman treatment\r\nin these matters; but between the Crown and the landlord as represented\r\nby the Barons, Lords of the Manor, etc., there were wide differences of\r\nopinion on the regalian rights, for in the extreme interpretation of the\r\nCrown it tended greatly to curtail the landlord's position in the\r\nmatter, and the success of the Crown on this subject was by no means\r\nuniversal. In fact, a considerable portion of English legal history of\r\nmines is but the outcropping of this conflict, and one of the\r\nconcessions wrung from King John at Runnymede in 1215 was his\r\nabandonment of a portion of such claims.\r\n\r\nThe mining communities of Cornwall and Devon were early in the\r\n13th century definitely chartered into corporations--\"The\r\nStannaries\"--possessing definite legislative and executive functions,\r\njudicial powers, and practical self-government; but they were required\r\nto make payment of the tithe in the shape of \"coinage\" on the tin. Such\r\nrecognition, while but a ratification of prior custom, was not obtained\r\nwithout struggle, for the Norman Kings early asserted wide rights over\r\nthe mines. Tangible record of mining in these parts, from a legal point\r\nof view, practically begins with a report by William de Wrotham in 1198\r\nupon his arrangements regarding the coinage. A charter of King John in\r\n1201, while granting free right of entry to the miners, thus usurped the\r\nrights of the landlords--a claim which he was compelled by the Barons to\r\nmoderate; the Crown, as above mentioned did maintain its right to a\r\nroyalty, but the landlord held the minerals. It is not, however, until\r\nthe time of Richard Carew's \"Survey of Cornwall\" (London, 1602) that we\r\nobtain much insight into details of miners' title, and the customs there\r\nset out were maintained in broad principle down to the 19th century. At\r\nCarew's time the miner was allowed to prospect freely upon \"Common\" or\r\nwastrel lands (since mostly usurped by landlords), and upon mineral\r\ndiscovery marked his boundaries, within which he was entitled to the\r\nvertical contents. Even upon such lands, however, he must acknowledge\r\nthe right of the lord of the manor to a participation in the mine. Upon\r\n\"enclosed\" lands he had no right of entry without the consent of the\r\nlandlord; in fact, the minerals belonged to the land as they do to-day\r\nexcept where voluntarily relinquished. In either case he was compelled\r\nto \"renew his bounds\" once a year, and to operate more or less\r\ncontinuously to maintain the right once obtained. There thus existed a\r\n\"labour condition\" of variable character, usually imposed more or less\r\nvigorously in the bargains with landlords. The regulations in Devonshire\r\ndiffered in the important particular that the miner had right of entry\r\nto private lands, although he was not relieved of the necessity to give\r\na participation of some sort to the landlord. The Forests of Dean,\r\nMendip, and other old mining communities possessed a measure of\r\nself-government, which do not display any features in their law\r\nfundamentally different from those of Cornwall and Devon. The High Peak\r\nlead mines of Derbyshire, however, exhibit one of the most profoundly\r\ninteresting of these mining communities. As well as having distinctively\r\nSaxon names for some of the mines, the customs there are of undoubted\r\nSaxon origin, and as such their ratification by the Normans caused the\r\nsurvival of one of the few Saxon institutions in England--a fact which,\r\nwe believe, has been hitherto overlooked by historians. Beginning with\r\ninquisitions by Edward I. in 1288, there is in the Record Office a\r\nwealth of information, the bare titles of which form too extensive a\r\nlist to set out here. (Of published works, the most important are Edward\r\nManlove's \"The Liberties and Customs of the Lead Mines within the\r\nWapentake of Wirksworth,\" London, 1653, generally referred to as the\r\n\"Rhymed Chronicle\"; Thomas Houghton, \"Rara Avis in Terra,\" London, 1687;\r\nWilliam Hardy, \"The Miner's Guide,\" Sheffield, 1748; Thomas Tapping,\r\n\"High Peak Mineral Customs,\" London, 1851.) The miners in this district\r\nwere presided over by a \"Barmaster,\" \"Barghmaster,\" or \"Barmar,\" as he\r\nwas variously spelled, all being a corruption of the German Bergmeister,\r\nwith precisely the same functions as to the allotment of title,\r\nsettlement of disputes, etc., as his Saxon progenitor had, and, like\r\nhim, he was advised by a jury. The miners had entry to all lands except\r\nchurchyards (this regulation waived upon death), and a few similar\r\nexceptions, and was subject to royalty to the Crown and the landlord.\r\nThe discoverer was entitled to a finder's \"meer\" of extra size, and his\r\ntitle was to the vein within the end lines, _i.e._, the \"apex\" law. This\r\ntitle was held subject to rigorous labour conditions, amounting to\r\nforfeiture for failure to operate the mine for a period of nine weeks.\r\nSpace does not permit of the elaboration of the details of this subject,\r\nwhich we hope to pursue elsewhere in its many historical bearings. Among\r\nthese we may mention that if the American \"Apex law\" is of English\r\ndescent, it must be laid to the door of Derbyshire, and not of Cornwall,\r\nas is generally done. Our own belief, however, is that the American\r\n\"apex\" conception came straight from Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to follow these inquiries into mining law beyond\r\nthe 15th century, but we may point out that with the growth of the\r\nsentiment of individualism the miners and landlords obtained steadily\r\nwider and wider rights at the cost of the State, until well within the\r\n19th century. The growth of stronger communal sentiment since the middle\r\nof the last century has already found its manifestation in the\r\nlegislation with regard to mines, for the laws of South Africa,\r\nAustralia, and England, and the agitation in the United States are all\r\ntoward greater restrictions on the mineral ownership in favour of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[7] ?_De Limitibus et de Re Agraria_ of Sextus Julius Frontinus (about\r\n50-90 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[8] Such a form of ownership is very old. Apparently upon the\r\ninstigation of Xenophon (see Note 7, p. 29) the Greeks formed companies\r\nto work the mines of Laurion, further information as to which is given\r\nin note 6, p. 27. Pliny (Note 7, p. 232) mentions the Company working\r\nthe quicksilver mines in Spain. In fact, company organization was very\r\ncommon among the Romans, who speculated largely in the shares,\r\nespecially in those companies which farmed the taxes of the provinces,\r\nor leased public lands, or took military and civil contracts.\r\n\r\n[9] The Latin text gives one-sixth, obviously an error.\r\n\r\n[10] A _symposium_ is a banquet, and a _symbola_ is a contribution of\r\nmoney to a banquet. This sentence is probably a play on the old German\r\n_Zeche_, mine, this being also a term for a drinking bout.\r\n\r\n[11] In the Latin text this is \"three\"--obviously an error.\r\n\r\n[12] See Note 9, p. 74, for further information with regard to these\r\nmines. The Rhenish gulden was about 6.9 shillings, or $1.66. Silver was\r\nworth about this amount per Troy ounce at this period, so that roughly,\r\nsilver of a value of 1,100 gulden would be about 1,100 Troy ounces. The\r\nSaxon thaler was worth about 4.64 shillings or about $1.11. The thaler,\r\ntherefore, represented about .65 Troy ounces of silver, so that 300\r\nthalers were about 195 Troy ounces, and 225 thalers about 146 Troy\r\nounces.\r\n\r\n[13] _Opera continens_. The Glossary gives _schicht_,--the origin of the\r\nEnglish \"shift.\"\r\n\r\n[14] The terms in the Latin text are _donator_, a giver of a gift, and\r\n_donatus_, a receiver. It appears to us, however, that some\r\nconsideration passed, and we have, therefore, used \"seller\" and \"buyer.\"\r\n\r\n[15] See Note 29, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[16] _Decemviri_--\"The Ten Men.\" The original _Decemviri_ were a body\r\nappointed by the Romans in 452 B.C., principally to codify the law. Such\r\ncommissions were afterward instituted for other purposes, but the\r\nanalogy of the above paragraph is a little remote.\r\n\r\n[17] This work was apparently never published; see Appendix A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last book I have explained the methods of delimiting the meers\r\nalong each kind of vein, and the duties of mine officials. In this\r\nbook[1] I will in like manner explain the principles of underground\r\nmining and the art of surveying. First then, I will proceed to deal with\r\nthose matters which pertain to the former heading, since both the\r\nsubject and methodical arrangement require it. And so I will describe\r\nfirst of all the digging of shafts, tunnels, and drifts on _venae\r\nprofundae_; next I will discuss the good indications shown by\r\n_canales_[2], by the materials which are dug out, and by the rocks; then\r\nI will speak of the tools by which veins and rocks are broken down and\r\nexcavated; the method by which fire shatters the hard veins; and\r\nfurther, of the machines with which water is drawn from the shafts and\r\nair is forced into deep shafts and long tunnels, for digging is impeded\r\nby the inrush of the former or the failure of the latter; next I will\r\ndeal with the two kinds of shafts, and with the making of them and of\r\ntunnels; and finally, I will describe the method of mining _venae\r\ndilatatae_, _venae cumulatae_, and stringers.\r\n\r\nNow when a miner discovers a _vena profunda_ he begins sinking a shaft\r\nand above it sets up a windlass, and builds a shed over the shaft to\r\nprevent the rain from falling in, lest the men who turn the windlass be\r\nnumbed by the cold or troubled by the rain. The windlass men also place\r\ntheir barrows in it, and the miners store their iron tools and other\r\nimplements therein. Next to the shaft-house another house is built,\r\nwhere the mine foreman and the other workmen dwell, and in which are\r\nstored the ore and other things which are dug out. Although some persons\r\nbuild only one house, yet because sometimes boys and other living things\r\nfall into the shafts, most miners deliberately place one house apart\r\nfrom the other, or at least separate them by a wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 103 (Shafts): Three vertical shafts, of which the first,\r\nA, does not reach the tunnel; the second, B, reaches the tunnel; to the\r\nthird, C, the tunnel has not yet been driven. D--Tunnel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 104 (Shafts): Three inclined shafts, of which A does not\r\nyet reach the tunnel; B reaches the tunnel; to the third, C, the tunnel\r\nhas not yet been driven. D--Tunnel.]\r\n\r\nNow a shaft is dug, usually two fathoms long, two-thirds of a fathom\r\nwide, and thirteen fathoms deep; but for the purpose of connecting with\r\na tunnel which has already been driven in a hill, a shaft may be sunk to\r\na depth of only eight fathoms, at other times to fourteen, more or\r\nless[3]. A shaft may be made vertical or inclined, according as the vein\r\nwhich the miners follow in the course of digging is vertical or\r\ninclined. A tunnel is a subterranean ditch driven lengthwise, and is\r\nnearly twice as high as it is broad, and wide enough that workmen and\r\nothers may be able to pass and carry their loads. It is usually one and\r\na quarter fathoms high, while its width is about three and\r\nthree-quarters feet. Usually two workmen are required to drive it, one\r\nof whom digs out the upper and the other the lower part, and the one\r\ngoes forward, while the other follows closely after. Each sits upon\r\nsmall boards fixed securely from the footwall to the hangingwall, or if\r\nthe vein is a soft one, sometimes on a wedge-shaped plank fixed on to\r\nthe vein itself. Miners sink more inclined shafts than vertical, and\r\nsome of each kind do not reach to tunnels, while some connect with them.\r\nBut as for some shafts, though they have already been sunk to the\r\nrequired depth, the tunnel which is to pierce the mountain may not yet\r\nhave been driven far enough to connect with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 105 (Shafts): A--Shaft. B, C--Drift. D--Another shaft.\r\nE--Tunnel. F--Mouth of tunnel.]\r\n\r\nIt is advantageous if a shaft connects with a tunnel, for then the\r\nminers and other workmen carry on more easily the work they have\r\nundertaken; but if the shaft is not so deep, it is usual to drift from\r\none or both sides of it. From these openings the owner or foreman\r\nbecomes acquainted with the veins and stringers that unite with the\r\nprincipal vein, or cut across it, or divide it obliquely; however, my\r\ndiscourse is now concerned mainly with _vena profunda_, but most of all\r\nwith the metallic material which it contains. Excavations of this kind\r\nwere called by the Greeks [Greek: kryptai] for, extending along after\r\nthe manner of a tunnel, they are entirely hidden within the ground.\r\nThis kind of an opening, however, differs from a tunnel in that it is\r\ndark throughout its length, whereas a tunnel has a mouth open to\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of shafts, tunnels, and drifts. I will now speak of the\r\nindications given by the _canales_, by the materials which are dug out,\r\nand by the rocks. These indications, as also many others which I will\r\nexplain, are to a great extent identical in _venae dilatatae_ and _venae\r\ncumulatae_ with _venae profundae_.\r\n\r\nWhen a stringer junctions with a main vein and causes a swelling, a\r\nshaft should be sunk at the junction. But when we find the stringer\r\nintersecting the main vein crosswise or obliquely, if it descends\r\nvertically down to the depths of the earth, a second shaft should be\r\nsunk to the point where the stringer cuts the main vein; but if the\r\nstringer cuts it obliquely the shaft should be two or three fathoms\r\nback, in order that the junction may be pierced lower down. At such\r\njunctions lies the best hope of finding the ore for the sake of which we\r\nexplore the ground, and if ore has already been found, it is usually\r\nfound in much greater abundance at that spot. Again, if several\r\nstringers descend into the earth, the miner, in order to pierce through\r\nthe point of contact, should sink the shaft in the midst of these\r\nstringers, or else calculate on the most prominent one.\r\n\r\nSince an inclined vein often lies near a vertical vein, it is advisable\r\nto sink a shaft at the spot where a stringer or cross-vein cuts them\r\nboth; or where a _vena dilatata_ or a stringer _dilatata_ passes\r\nthrough, for minerals are usually found there. In the same way we have a\r\ngood prospect of finding metal at the point where an inclined vein joins\r\na vertical one; this is why miners cross-cut the hangingwall or footwall\r\nof a main vein, and in these openings seek for a vein which may junction\r\nwith the principal vein a few fathoms below. Nay, further, these same\r\nminers, if no stringer or cross-vein intersects the main vein so that\r\nthey can follow it in their workings, even cross-cut through the solid\r\nrock of the hangingwall or footwall. These cross-cuts are likewise\r\ncalled \"[Greek: kryptai],\" whether the beginning of the opening which\r\nhas to be undertaken is made from a tunnel or from a drift. Miners have\r\nsome hope when only a cross vein cuts a main vein. Further, if a vein\r\nwhich cuts the main vein obliquely does not appear anywhere beyond it,\r\nit is advisable to dig into that side of the main vein toward which the\r\noblique vein inclines, whether the right or left side, that we may\r\nascertain if the main vein has absorbed it; if after cross-cutting six\r\nfathoms it is not found, it is advisable to dig on the other side of the\r\nmain vein, that we may know for certain whether it has carried it\r\nforward. The owners of a main vein can often dig no less profitably on\r\nthat side where the vein which cuts the main vein again appears, than\r\nwhere it first cuts it; the owners of the intersecting vein, when that\r\nis found again, recover their title, which had in a measure been lost.\r\n\r\nThe common miners look favourably upon the stringers which come from the\r\nnorth and join the main vein; on the other hand, they look unfavourably\r\nupon those which come from the south, and say that these do much harm to\r\nthe main vein, while the former improve it. But I think that miners\r\nshould not neglect either of them: as I showed in Book III, experience\r\ndoes not confirm those who hold this opinion about veins, so now again\r\nI could furnish examples of each kind of stringers rejected by the\r\ncommon miners which have proved good, but I know this could be of little\r\nor no benefit to posterity.\r\n\r\nIf the miners find no stringers or veins in the hangingwall or footwall\r\nof the main vein, and if they do not find much ore, it is not worth\r\nwhile to undertake the labour of sinking another shaft. Nor ought a\r\nshaft to be sunk where a vein is divided into two or three parts, unless\r\nthe indications are satisfactory that those parts may be united and\r\njoined together a little later. Further, it is a bad indication for a\r\nvein rich in mineral to bend and turn hither and thither, for unless it\r\ngoes down again into the ground vertically or inclined, as it first\r\nbegan, it produces no more metal; and even though it does go down again,\r\nit often continues barren. Stringers which in their outcrops bear\r\nmetals, often disappoint miners, no metal being found in depth. Further,\r\ninverted seams in the rocks are counted among the bad indications.\r\n\r\nThe miners hew out the whole of solid veins when they show clear\r\nevidence of being of good quality; similarly they hew out the drusy[4]\r\nveins, especially if the cavities are plainly seen to have formerly\r\nborne metal, or if the cavities are few and small. They do not dig\r\nbarren veins through which water flows, if there are no metallic\r\nparticles showing; occasionally, however, they dig even barren veins\r\nwhich are free from water, because of the pyrites which is devoid of all\r\nmetal, or because of a fine black soft substance which is like wool.\r\nThey dig stringers which are rich in metal, or sometimes, for the\r\npurpose of searching for the vein, those that are devoid of ore which\r\nlie near the hangingwall or footwall of the main vein. This then,\r\ngenerally speaking, is the mode of dealing with stringers and veins.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the metallic material which is found in the\r\n_canales_ of _venae profundae_, _venae dilatatae_, and _venae\r\ncumulatae_, being in all these either cohesive and continuous, or\r\nscattered and dispersed among them, or swelling out in bellying shapes,\r\nor found in veins or stringers which originate from the main vein and\r\nramify like branches; but these latter veins and stringers are very\r\nshort, for after a little space they do not appear again. If we come\r\nacross a small quantity of metallic material it is an indication; but if\r\na large quantity, it is not an \"indication,\" but the very thing for\r\nwhich we explore the earth. As soon as a miner who searches for veins\r\ndiscovers pure metal or minerals, or rich metallic material, or a great\r\nabundance of material which is poor in metal, let him sink a shaft on\r\nthe spot without any delay. If the material appears more abundant or of\r\nbetter quality on the one side, he will incline his digging in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nGold, silver, copper, and quicksilver are often found native[5]; less\r\noften iron and bismuth; almost never tin and lead. Nevertheless\r\ntin-stone is not far removed from the pure white tin which is melted out\r\nof them, and galena, from which lead is obtained, differs little from\r\nthat metal itself.\r\n\r\nNow we may classify gold ores. Next after native gold, we come to the\r\n_rudis_[6], of yellowish green, yellow, purple, black, or outside red\r\nand inside gold colour. These must be reckoned as the richest ores,\r\nbecause the gold exceeds the stone or earth in weight. Next come all\r\ngold ores of which each one hundred _librae_ contains more than three\r\n_unciae_ of gold[7]; for although but a small proportion of gold is\r\nfound in the earth or stone, yet it equals in value other metals of\r\ngreater weight.[8] All other gold ores are considered poor, because the\r\nearth or stone too far outweighs the gold. A vein which contains a\r\nlarger proportion of silver than of gold is rarely found to be a rich\r\none. Earth, whether it be dry or wet, rarely abounds in gold; but in dry\r\nearth there is more often found a greater quantity of gold, especially\r\nif it has the appearance of having been melted in a furnace, and if it\r\nis not lacking in scales resembling mica. The solidified juices, azure,\r\nchrysocolla, orpiment, and realgar, also frequently contain gold.\r\nLikewise native or _rudis_ gold is found sometimes in large, and\r\nsometimes in small quantities in quartz, schist, marble, and also in\r\nstone which easily melts in fire of the second degree, and which is\r\nsometimes so porous that it seems completely decomposed. Lastly, gold is\r\nfound in pyrites, though rarely in large quantities.\r\n\r\nWhen considering silver ores other than native silver, those ores are\r\nclassified as rich, of which each one hundred _librae_ contains more\r\nthan three _librae_ of silver. This quality comprises _rudis_ silver,\r\nwhether silver glance or ruby silver, or whether white, or black, or\r\ngrey, or purple, or yellow, or liver-coloured, or any other. Sometimes\r\nquartz, schist, or marble is of this quality also, if much native or\r\n_rudis_ silver adheres to it. But that ore is considered of poor quality\r\nif three _librae_ of silver at the utmost are found in each one hundred\r\n_librae_ of it[9]. Silver ore usually contains a greater quantity than\r\nthis, because Nature bestows quantity in place of quality; such ore is\r\nmixed with all kinds of earth and stone compounds, except the various\r\nkinds of _rudis_ silver; especially with pyrites, _cadmia metallica\r\nfossilis_, galena, _stibium_, and others.\r\n\r\nAs regards other kinds of metal, although some rich ores are found,\r\nstill, unless the veins contain a large quantity of ore, it is very\r\nrarely worth while to dig them. The Indians and some other races do\r\nsearch for gems in veins hidden deep in the earth, but more often they\r\nare noticed from their clearness, or rather their brilliancy, when\r\nmetals are mined. When they outcrop, we follow veins of marble by mining\r\nin the same way as is done with rock or building-stones when we come\r\nupon them. But gems, properly so called, though they sometimes have\r\nveins of their own, are still for the most part found in mines and rock\r\nquarries, as the lodestone in iron mines, the emery in silver mines, the\r\n_lapis judaicus_, _trochites_, and the like in stone quarries where the\r\ndiggers, at the bidding of the owners, usually collect them from the\r\nseams in the rocks.[10] Nor does the miner neglect the digging of\r\n\"extraordinary earths,\"[11] whether they are found in gold mines,\r\nsilver mines, or other mines; nor do other miners neglect them if they\r\nare found in stone quarries, or in their own veins; their value is\r\nusually indicated by their taste. Nor, lastly, does the miner fail to\r\ngive attention to the solidified juices which are found in metallic\r\nveins, as well as in their own veins, from which he collects and gathers\r\nthem. But I will say no more on these matters, because I have explained\r\nmore fully all the metals and mineral substances in the books \"_De\r\nNatura Fossilium_.\"\r\n\r\nBut I will return to the indications. If we come upon earth which is\r\nlike lute, in which there are particles of any sort of metal, native or\r\n_rudis_, the best possible indication of a vein is given to miners, for\r\nthe metallic material from which the particles have become detached is\r\nnecessarily close by. But if this kind of earth is found absolutely\r\ndevoid of all metallic material, but fatty, and of white, green, blue,\r\nand similar colours, they must not abandon the work that has been\r\nstarted. Miners have other indications in the veins and stringers, which\r\nI have described already, and in the rocks, about which I will speak a\r\nlittle later. If the miner comes across other dry earths which contain\r\nnative or _rudis_ metal, that is a good indication; if he comes across\r\nyellow, red, black, or some other \"extraordinary\" earth, though it is\r\ndevoid of mineral, it is not a bad indication. Chrysocolla, or azure, or\r\nverdigris, or orpiment, or realgar, when they are found, are counted\r\namong the good indications. Further, where underground springs throw up\r\nmetal we ought to continue the digging we have begun, for this points to\r\nthe particles having been detached from the main mass like a fragment\r\nfrom a body. In the same way the thin scales of any metal adhering to\r\nstone or rock are counted among the good indications. Next, if the veins\r\nwhich are composed partly of quartz, partly of clayey or dry earth,\r\ndescend one and all into the depths of the earth together, with their\r\nstringers, there is good hope of metal being found; but if the stringers\r\nafterward do not appear, or little metallic material is met with, the\r\ndigging should not be given up until there is nothing remaining. Dark or\r\nblack or horn or liver-coloured quartz is usually a good sign; white is\r\nsometimes good, sometimes no sign at all. But calc-spar, showing itself\r\nin a _vena profunda_, if it disappears a little lower down is not a good\r\nindication; for it did not belong to the vein proper, but to some\r\nstringer. Those kinds of stone which easily melt in fire, especially if\r\nthey are translucent (fluorspar?), must be counted among the medium\r\nindications, for if other good indications are present they are good,\r\nbut if no good indications are present, they give no useful\r\nsignificance. In the same way we ought to form our judgment with regard\r\nto gems. Veins which at the hangingwall and footwall have horn-coloured\r\nquartz or marble, but in the middle clayey earth, give some hope;\r\nlikewise those give hope in which the hangingwall or footwall shows\r\niron-rust coloured earth, and in the middle greasy and sticky earth;\r\nalso there is hope for those which have at the hanging or footwall that\r\nkind of earth which we call \"soldiers' earth,\" and in the middle black\r\nearth or earth which looks as if burnt. The special indication of gold\r\nis orpiment; of silver is bismuth and _stibium_; of copper is verdigris,\r\n_melanteria_, _sory_, _chalcitis_, _misy_, and vitriol; of tin is the\r\nlarge pure black stones of which the tin itself is made, and a material\r\nthey dig up resembling litharge; of iron, iron rust. Gold and copper are\r\nequally indicated by chrysocolla and azure; silver and lead, by the\r\nlead. But, though miners rightly call bismuth \"the roof of silver,\" and\r\nthough copper pyrites is the common parent of vitriol and _melanteria_,\r\nstill these sometimes have their own peculiar minerals, just as have\r\norpiment and _stibium_.\r\n\r\nNow, just as certain vein materials give miners a favourable indication,\r\nso also do the rocks through which the _canales_ of the veins wind their\r\nway, for sand discovered in a mine is reckoned among the good\r\nindications, especially if it is very fine. In the same way schist, when\r\nit is of a bluish or blackish colour, and also limestone, of whatever\r\ncolour it may be, is a good sign for a silver vein. There is a rock of\r\nanother kind that is a good sign; in it are scattered tiny black stones\r\nfrom which tin is smelted; especially when the whole space between the\r\nveins is composed of this kind of rock. Very often indeed, this good\r\nkind of rock in conjunction with valuable stringers contains within its\r\nfolds the _canales_ of mineral bearing veins: if it descends vertically\r\ninto the earth, the benefit belongs to that mine in which it is seen\r\nfirst of all; if inclined, it benefits the other neighbouring mines[12].\r\nAs a result the miner who is not ignorant of geometry can calculate from\r\nthe other mines the depth at which the _canales_ of a vein bearing rich\r\nmetal will wind its way through the rock into his mine. So much for\r\nthese matters.\r\n\r\nI now come to the mode of working, which is varied and complex, for in\r\nsome places they dig crumbling ore, in others hard ore, in others a\r\nharder ore, and in others the hardest kind of ore. In the same way, in\r\nsome places the hangingwall rock is soft and fragile, in others hard, in\r\nothers harder, and in still others of the hardest sort. I call that ore\r\n\"crumbling\" which is composed of earth, and of soft solidified juices;\r\nthat ore \"hard\" which is composed of metallic minerals and moderately\r\nhard stones, such as for the most part are those which easily melt in a\r\nfire of the first and second orders, like lead and similar materials. I\r\ncall that ore \"harder\" when with those I have already mentioned are\r\ncombined various sorts of quartz, or stones which easily melt in fire of\r\nthe third degree, or pyrites, or _cadmia_, or very hard marble. I call\r\nthat ore hardest, which is composed throughout the whole vein of these\r\nhard stones and compounds. The hanging or footwalls of a vein are hard,\r\nwhen composed of rock in which there are few stringers or seams; harder,\r\nin which they are fewer; hardest, in which they are fewest or none at\r\nall. When these are absent, the rock is quite devoid of water which\r\nsoftens it. But the hardest rock of the hanging or footwall, however, is\r\nseldom as hard as the harder class of ore.\r\n\r\nMiners dig out crumbling ore with the pick alone. When the metal has not\r\nyet shown itself, they do not discriminate between the hangingwall and\r\nthe veins; when it has once been found, they work with the utmost care.\r\nFor first of all they tear away the hangingwall rock separately from the\r\nvein, afterward with a pick they dislodge the crumbling vein from the\r\nfootwall into a dish placed underneath to prevent any of the metal from\r\nfalling to the ground. They break a hard vein loose from the footwall by\r\nblows with a hammer upon the first kind of iron tool[13], all of which\r\nare designated by appropriate names, and with the same tools they hew\r\naway the hard hangingwall rock. They hew out the hangingwall rock in\r\nadvance more frequently, the rock of the footwall more rarely; and\r\nindeed, when the rock of the footwall resists iron tools, the rock of\r\nthe hangingwall certainly cannot be broken unless it is allowable to\r\nshatter it by fire. With regard to the harder veins which are tractable\r\nto iron tools, and likewise with regard to the harder and hardest kind\r\nof hangingwall rock, they generally attack them with more powerful iron\r\ntools, in fact, with the fourth kind of iron tool, which are called by\r\ntheir appropriate names; but if these are not ready to hand, they use\r\ntwo or three iron tools of the first kind together. As for the hardest\r\nkind of metal-bearing vein, which in a measure resists iron tools, if\r\nthe owners of the neighbouring mines give them permission, they break it\r\nwith fires. But if these owners refuse them permission, then first of\r\nall they hew out the rock of the hangingwall, or of the footwall if it\r\nbe less hard; then they place timbers set in hitches in the hanging or\r\nfootwall, a little above the vein, and from the front and upper part,\r\nwhere the vein is seen to be seamed with small cracks, they drive into\r\none of the little cracks one of the iron tools which I have mentioned;\r\nthen in each fracture they place four thin iron blocks, and in order to\r\nhold them more firmly, if necessary, they place as many thin iron plates\r\nback to back; next they place thinner iron plates between each two iron\r\nblocks, and strike and drive them by turns with hammers, whereby the\r\nvein rings with a shrill sound; and the moment when it begins to be\r\ndetached from the hangingwall or footwall rock, a tearing sound is\r\nheard. As soon as this grows distinct the miners hastily flee away; then\r\na great crash is heard as the vein is broken and torn, and falls down.\r\nBy this method they throw down a portion of a vein weighing a hundred\r\npounds more or less. But if the miners by any other method hew the\r\nhardest kind of vein which is rich in metal, there remain certain\r\ncone-shaped portions which can be cut out afterward only with\r\ndifficulty. As for this knob of hard ore, if it is devoid of metal, or\r\nif they are not allowed to apply fire to it, they proceed round it by\r\ndigging to the right or left, because it cannot be broken into by iron\r\nwedges without great expense. Meantime, while the workmen are carrying\r\nout the task they have undertaken, the depths of the earth often resound\r\nwith sweet singing, whereby they lighten a toil which is of the severest\r\nkind and full of the greatest dangers.\r\n\r\nAs I have just said, fire shatters the hardest rocks, but the method of\r\nits application is not simple[14]. For if a vein held in the rocks\r\ncannot be hewn out because of the hardness or other difficulty, and the\r\ndrift or tunnel is low, a heap of dried logs is placed against the rock\r\nand fired; if the drift or tunnel is high, two heaps are necessary, of\r\nwhich one is placed above the other, and both burn until the fire has\r\nconsumed them. This force does not generally soften a large portion of\r\nthe vein, but only some of the surface. When the rock in the hanging or\r\nfootwall can be worked by the iron tools and the vein is so hard that it\r\nis not tractable to the same tools, then the walls are hollowed out; if\r\nthis be in the end of the drift or tunnel or above or below, the vein is\r\nthen broken by fire, but not by the same method; for if the hollow is\r\nwide, as many logs are piled into it as possible, but if narrow, only a\r\nfew. By the one method the greater fire separates the vein more\r\ncompletely from the footwall or sometimes from the hangingwall, and by\r\nthe other, the smaller fire breaks away less of the vein from the rock,\r\nbecause in that case the fire is confined and kept in check by portions\r\nof the rock which surround the wood held in such a narrow excavation.\r\nFurther, if the excavation is low, only one pile of logs is placed in\r\nit, if high, there are two, one placed above the other, by which plan\r\nthe lower bundle being kindled sets alight the upper one; and the fire\r\nbeing driven by the draught into the vein, separates it from the rock\r\nwhich, however hard it may be, often becomes so softened as to be the\r\nmost easily breakable of all. Applying this principle, Hannibal, the\r\nCarthaginian General, imitating the Spanish miners, overcame the\r\nhardness of the Alps by the use of vinegar and fire. Even if a vein is a\r\nvery wide one, as tin veins usually are, miners excavate into the small\r\nstreaks, and into those hollows they put dry wood and place amongst them\r\nat frequent intervals sticks, all sides of which are shaved down\r\nfan-shaped, which easily take light, and when once they have taken fire\r\ncommunicate it to the other bundles of wood, which easily ignite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 120 (Fire-setting): A--Kindled logs. B--Sticks shaved down\r\nfan-shaped. C--Tunnel.]\r\n\r\nWhile the heated veins and rock are giving forth a foetid vapour and the\r\nshafts or tunnels are emitting fumes, the miners and other workmen do\r\nnot go down in the mines lest the stench affect their health or actually\r\nkill them, as I will explain in greater detail when I come to speak of\r\nthe evils which affect miners. The _Bergmeister_, in order to prevent\r\nworkmen from being suffocated, gives no one permission to break veins or\r\nrock by fire in shafts or tunnels where it is possible for the poisonous\r\nvapour and smoke to permeate the veins or stringers and pass through\r\ninto the neighbouring mines, which have no hard veins or rock. As for\r\nthat part of a vein or the surface of the rock which the fire has\r\nseparated from the remaining mass, if it is overhead, the miners\r\ndislodge it with a crowbar, or if it still has some degree of hardness,\r\nthey thrust a smaller crowbar into the cracks and so break it down, but\r\nif it is on the sides they break it with hammers. Thus broken off, the\r\nrock tumbles down; or if it still remains, they break it off with picks.\r\nRock and earth on the one hand, and metal and ore on the other, are\r\nfilled into buckets separately and drawn up to the open air or to the\r\nnearest tunnel. If the shaft is not deep, the buckets are drawn up by a\r\nmachine turned by men; if it is deep, they are drawn by machines turned\r\nby horses.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that a rush of water or sometimes stagnant air hinders\r\nthe mining; for this reason miners pay the greatest attention to these\r\nmatters, just as much as to digging, or they should do so. The water of\r\nthe veins and stringers and especially of vacant workings, must be\r\ndrained out through the shafts and tunnels. Air, indeed, becomes\r\nstagnant both in tunnels and in shafts; in a deep shaft, if it be by\r\nitself, this occurs if it is neither reached by a tunnel nor connected\r\nby a drift with another shaft; this occurs in a tunnel if it has been\r\ndriven too far into a mountain and no shaft has yet been sunk deep\r\nenough to meet it; in neither case can the air move or circulate. For\r\nthis reason the vapours become heavy and resemble mist, and they smell\r\nof mouldiness, like a vault or some underground chamber which has been\r\ncompletely closed for many years. This suffices to prevent miners from\r\ncontinuing their work for long in these places, even if the mine is full\r\nof silver or gold, or if they do continue, they cannot breathe freely\r\nand they have headaches; this more often happens if they work in these\r\nplaces in great numbers, and bring many lamps, which then supply them\r\nwith a feeble light, because the foul air from both lamps and men make\r\nthe vapours still more heavy.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of water is drawn from the shafts by machines of\r\ndifferent kinds which men turn or work. If so great a quantity has\r\nflowed into one shaft as greatly to impede mining, another shaft is sunk\r\nsome fathoms distant from the first, and thus in one of them work and\r\nlabour are carried on without hindrance, and the water is drained into\r\nthe other, which is sunk lower than the level of the water in the first\r\none; then by these machines or by those worked by horses, the water is\r\ndrawn up into the drain and flows out of the shaft-house or the mouth of\r\nthe nearest tunnel. But when into the shaft of one mine, which is sunk\r\nmore deeply, there flows all the water of all the neighbouring mines,\r\nnot only from that vein in which the shaft is sunk, but also from other\r\nveins, then it becomes necessary for a large sump to be made to collect\r\nthe water; from this sump the water is drained by machines which draw it\r\nthrough pipes, or by ox-hides, about which I will say more in the next\r\nbook. The water which pours into the tunnels from the veins and\r\nstringers and seams in the rocks is carried away in the drains.\r\n\r\nAir is driven into the extremities of deep shafts and long tunnels by\r\npowerful blowing machines, as I will explain in the following book,\r\nwhich will deal with these machines also. The outer air flows\r\nspontaneously into the caverns of the earth, and when it can pass\r\nthrough them comes out again. This, however, comes about in different\r\nways, for in spring and summer it flows into the deeper shafts,\r\ntraverses the tunnels or drifts, and finds its way out of the shallower\r\nshafts; similarly at the same season it pours into the lowest tunnel\r\nand, meeting a shaft in its course, turns aside to a higher tunnel and\r\npasses out therefrom; but in autumn and winter, on the other hand, it\r\nenters the upper tunnel or shaft and comes out at the deeper ones. This\r\nchange in the flow of air currents occurs in temperate regions at the\r\nbeginning of spring and the end of autumn, but in cold regions at the\r\nend of spring and the beginning of autumn. But at each period, before\r\nthe air regularly assumes its own accustomed course, generally for a\r\nspace of fourteen days it undergoes frequent variations, now blowing\r\ninto an upper shaft or tunnel, now into a lower one. But enough of this,\r\nlet us now proceed to what remains.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of shafts, one of the depth already described, of\r\nwhich kind there are usually several in one mine; especially if the mine\r\nis entered by a tunnel and is metal-bearing. For when the first tunnel\r\nis connected with the first shaft, two new shafts are sunk; or if the\r\ninrush of water hinders sinking, sometimes three are sunk; so that one\r\nmay take the place of a sump and the work of sinking which has been\r\nbegun may be continued by means of the remaining two shafts; the same is\r\ndone in the case of the second tunnel and the third, or even the fourth,\r\nif so many are driven into a mountain. The second kind of shaft is very\r\ndeep, sometimes as much as sixty, eighty, or one hundred fathoms. These\r\nshafts continue vertically toward the depths of the earth, and by means\r\nof a hauling-rope the broken rock and metalliferous ores are drawn out\r\nof the mine; for which reason miners call them vertical shafts. Over\r\nthese shafts are erected machines by which water is extracted; when they\r\nare above ground the machines are usually worked by horses, but when\r\nthey are in tunnels, other kinds are used which are turned by\r\nwater-power. Such are the shafts which are sunk when a vein is rich in\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nNow shafts, of whatever kind they may be, are supported in various ways.\r\nIf the vein is hard, and also the hanging and footwall rock, the shaft\r\ndoes not require much timbering, but timbers are placed at intervals,\r\none end of each of which is fixed in a hitch cut into the rock of the\r\nhangingwall and the other fixed into a hitch cut in the footwall. To\r\nthese timbers are fixed small timbers along the footwall, to which are\r\nfastened the lagging and ladders. The lagging is also fixed to the\r\ntimbers, both to those which screen off the shaft on the ends from the\r\nvein, and to those which screen off the rest of the shaft from that part\r\nin which the ladders are placed. The lagging on the sides of the shaft\r\nconfine the vein, so as to prevent fragments of it which have become\r\nloosened by water from dropping into the shaft and terrifying, or\r\ninjuring, or knocking off the miners and other workmen who are going up\r\nor down the ladders from one part of the mine to another. For the same\r\nreason, the lagging between the ladders and the haulage-way on the other\r\nhand, confine and shut off from the ladders the fragments of rock which\r\nfall from the buckets or baskets while they are being drawn up;\r\nmoreover, they make the arduous and difficult descent and ascent to\r\nappear less terrible, and in fact to be less dangerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 123 (Timbering Shafts): A--Wall plates. B--Dividers.\r\nC--Long end posts. D--End plates.]\r\n\r\nIf a vein is soft and the rock of the hanging and footwalls is weak, a\r\ncloser structure is necessary; for this purpose timbers are joined\r\ntogether, in rectangular shapes and placed one after the other without a\r\nbreak. These are arranged on two different systems; for either the\r\nsquare ends of the timbers, which reach from the hangingwall to the\r\nfootwall, are fixed into corresponding square holes in the timbers which\r\nlie along the hanging or footwall, or the upper part of the end of one\r\nand the lower part of the end of the other are cut out and one laid on\r\nthe other. The great weight of these joined timbers is sustained by\r\nstout beams placed at intervals, which are deeply set into hitches in\r\nthe footwall and hangingwall, but are inclined. In order that these\r\njoined timbers may remain stationary, wooden wedges or poles cut from\r\ntrees are driven in between the timbers and the vein and the hangingwall\r\nand the footwall; and the space which remains empty is filled with loose\r\ndirt. If the hanging and footwall rock is sometimes hard and sometimes\r\nsoft, and the vein likewise, solid joined timbers are not used, but\r\ntimbers are placed at intervals; and where the rock is soft and the vein\r\ncrumbling, carpenters put in lagging between them and the wall rocks,\r\nand behind these they fill with loose dirt; by this means they fill up\r\nthe void.\r\n\r\nWhen a very deep shaft, whether vertical or inclined, is supported by\r\njoined timbers, then, since they are sometimes of bad material and a\r\nfall is threatened, for the sake of greater firmness three or four pairs\r\nof strong end posts are placed between these, one pair on the\r\nhangingwall side, the other on the footwall side. To prevent them from\r\nfalling out of position and to make them firm and substantial, they are\r\nsupported by frequent end plates, and in order that these may be more\r\nsecurely fixed they are mortised into the posts. Further, in whatever\r\nway the shaft may be timbered, dividers are placed upon the wall plates,\r\nand to these is fixed lagging, and this marks off and separates the\r\nladder-way from the remaining part of the shaft. If a vertical shaft is\r\na very deep one, planks are laid upon the timbers by the side of the\r\nladders and fixed on to the timbers, in order that the men who are going\r\nup or down may sit or stand upon them and rest when they are tired. To\r\nprevent danger to the shovellers from rocks which, after being drawn up\r\nfrom so deep a shaft fall down again, a little above the bottom of the\r\nshaft small rough sticks are placed close together on the timbers, in\r\nsuch a way as to cover the whole space of the shaft except the\r\nladder-way. A hole, however, is left in this structure near the\r\nfootwall, which is kept open so that there may be one opening to the\r\nshaft from the bottom, that the buckets full of the materials which have\r\nbeen dug out may be drawn from the shaft through it by machines, and may\r\nbe returned to the same place again empty; and so the shovellers and\r\nother workmen, as it were hiding beneath this structure, remain\r\nperfectly safe in the shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 125 (Timbering Tunnels): A--Posts. B--Caps. C--Sills.\r\nD--Doors. E--Lagging. F--Drains.]\r\n\r\nIn mines on one vein there are driven one, two, or sometimes three or\r\nmore tunnels, always one above the other. If the vein is solid and hard,\r\nand likewise the hanging and footwall rock, no part of the tunnel needs\r\nsupport, beyond that which is required at the mouth, because at that\r\nspot there is not yet solid rock; if the vein is soft, and the hanging\r\nand footwall rock are likewise soft, the tunnel requires frequent strong\r\ntimbering, which is provided in the following way. First, two dressed\r\nposts are erected and set into the tunnel floor, which is dug out a\r\nlittle; these are of medium thickness, and high enough that their ends,\r\nwhich are cut square, almost touch the top of the tunnel; then upon them\r\nis placed a smaller dressed cap, which is mortised into the heads of the\r\nposts; at the bottom, other small timbers, whose ends are similarly\r\nsquared, are mortised into the posts. At each interval of one and a half\r\nfathoms, one of these sets is erected; each one of these the miners call\r\na \"little doorway,\" because it opens a certain amount of passage way;\r\nand indeed, when necessity requires it, doors are fixed to the timbers\r\nof each little doorway so that it can be closed. Then lagging of planks\r\nor of poles is placed upon the caps lengthwise, so as to reach from one\r\nset of timbers to another, and is laid along the sides, in case some\r\nportion of the body of the mountain may fall, and by its bulk impede\r\npassage or crush persons coming in or out. Moreover, to make the timbers\r\nremain stationary, wooden pegs are driven between them and the sides of\r\nthe tunnel. Lastly, if rock or earth are carried out in wheelbarrows,\r\nplanks joined together are laid upon the sills; if the rock is hauled\r\nout in trucks, then two timbers three-quarters of a foot thick and wide\r\nare laid on the sills, and, where they join, these are usually hollowed\r\nout so that in the hollow, as in a road, the iron pin of the truck may\r\nbe pushed along; indeed, because of this pin in the groove, the truck\r\ndoes not leave the worn track to the left or right. Beneath the sills\r\nare the drains through which the water flows away.\r\n\r\nMiners timber drifts in the same way as tunnels. These do not, however,\r\nrequire sill-pieces, or drains; for the broken rock is not hauled very\r\nfar, nor does the water have far to flow. If the vein above is\r\nmetal-bearing, as it sometimes is for a distance of several fathoms,\r\nthen from the upper part of tunnels or even drifts that have already\r\nbeen driven, other drifts are driven again and again until that part of\r\nthe vein is reached which does not yield metal. The timbering of these\r\nopenings is done as follows: stulls are set at intervals into hitches in\r\nthe hanging and footwall, and upon them smooth poles are laid\r\ncontinuously; and that they may be able to bear the weight, the stulls\r\nare generally a foot and a half thick. After the ore has been taken out\r\nand the mining of the vein is being done elsewhere, the rock then\r\nbroken, especially if it cannot be taken away without great difficulty,\r\nis thrown into these openings among the timber, and the carriers of the\r\nore are saved toil, and the owners save half the expense. This then,\r\ngenerally speaking, is the method by which everything relating to the\r\ntimbering of shafts, tunnels, and drifts is carried out.\r\n\r\nAll that I have hitherto written is in part peculiar to _venae\r\nprofundae_, and in part common to all kinds of veins; of what follows,\r\npart is specially applicable to _venae dilatatae_, part to _venae\r\ncumulatae_. But first I will describe how _venae dilatatae_ should be\r\nmined. Where torrents, rivers, or streams have by inundations washed\r\naway part of the slope of a mountain or a hill, and have disclosed a\r\n_vena dilatata_, a tunnel should be driven first straight and narrow,\r\nand then wider, for nearly all the vein should be hewn away; and when\r\nthis tunnel has been driven further, a shaft which supplies air should\r\nbe sunk in the mountain or hill, and through it from time to time the\r\nore, earth, and rock can be drawn up at less expense than if they be\r\ndrawn out through the very great length of the tunnel; and even in those\r\nplaces to which the tunnel does not yet reach, miners dig shafts in\r\norder to open a _vena dilatata_ which they conjecture must lie beneath\r\nthe soil. In this way, when the upper layers are removed, they dig\r\nthrough rock sometimes of one kind and colour, sometimes of one kind but\r\ndifferent colours, sometimes of different kinds but of one colour, and,\r\nlastly, of different kinds and different colours. The thickness of rock,\r\nboth of each single stratum and of all combined, is uncertain, for the\r\nwhole of the strata are in some places twenty fathoms deep, in others\r\nmore than fifty; individual strata are in some places half a foot thick;\r\nin others, one, two, or more feet; in others, one, two, three, or more\r\nfathoms. For example, in those districts which lie at the foot of the\r\nHarz mountains, there are many different coloured strata, covering a\r\ncopper _vena dilatata_. When the soil has been stripped, first of all is\r\ndisclosed a stratum which is red, but of a dull shade and of a thickness\r\nof twenty, thirty, or five and thirty fathoms. Then there is another\r\nstratum, also red, but of a light shade, which has usually a thickness\r\nof about two fathoms. Beneath this is a stratum of ash-coloured clay\r\nnearly a fathom thick, which, although it is not metalliferous, is\r\nreckoned a vein. Then follows a third stratum, which is ashy, and about\r\nthree fathoms thick. Beneath this lies a vein of ashes to the thickness\r\nof five fathoms, and these ashes are mixed with rock of the same colour.\r\nJoined to the last, and underneath, comes a stratum, the fourth in\r\nnumber, dark in colour and a foot thick. Under this comes the fifth\r\nstratum, of a pale or yellowish colour, two feet thick; underneath\r\nwhich is the sixth stratum, likewise dark, but rough and three feet\r\nthick. Afterward occurs the seventh stratum, likewise of dark colour,\r\nbut still darker than the last, and two feet thick. This is followed by\r\nan eighth stratum, ashy, rough, and a foot thick. This kind, as also the\r\nothers, is sometimes distinguished by stringers of the stone which\r\neasily melts in fire of the second order. Beneath this is another ashy\r\nrock, light in weight, and five feet thick. Next to this comes a lighter\r\nash-coloured one, a foot thick; beneath this lies the eleventh stratum,\r\nwhich is dark and very much like the seventh, and two feet thick. Below\r\nthe last is a twelfth stratum of a whitish colour and soft, also two\r\nfeet thick; the weight of this rests on a thirteenth stratum, ashy and\r\none foot thick, whose weight is in turn supported by a fourteenth\r\nstratum, which is blackish and half a foot thick. There follows this,\r\nanother stratum of black colour, likewise half a foot thick, which is\r\nagain followed by a sixteenth stratum still blacker in colour, whose\r\nthickness is also the same. Beneath this, and last of all, lies the\r\ncupriferous stratum, black coloured and schistose, in which there\r\nsometimes glitter scales of gold-coloured pyrites in the very thin\r\nsheets, which, as I said elsewhere, often take the forms of various\r\nliving things.[15]\r\n\r\nThe miners mine out a _vena dilatata_ laterally and longitudinally by\r\ndriving a low tunnel in it, and if the nature of the work and place\r\npermit, they sink also a shaft in order to discover whether there is a\r\nsecond vein beneath the first one; for sometimes beneath it there are\r\ntwo, three, or more similar metal-bearing veins, and these are excavated\r\nin the same way laterally and longitudinally. They generally mine _venae\r\ndilatatae_ lying down; and to avoid wearing away their clothes and\r\ninjuring their left shoulders they usually bind on themselves small\r\nwooden cradles. For this reason, this particular class of miners, in\r\norder to use their iron tools, are obliged to bend their necks to the\r\nleft, not infrequently having them twisted. Now these veins also\r\nsometimes divide, and where these parts re-unite, ore of a richer and a\r\nbetter quality is generally found; the same thing occurs where the\r\nstringers, of which they are not altogether devoid, join with them, or\r\ncut them crosswise, or divide them obliquely. To prevent a mountain or\r\nhill, which has in this way been undermined, from subsiding by its\r\nweight, either some natural pillars and arches are left, on which the\r\npressure rests as on a foundation, or timbering is done for support.\r\nMoreover, the materials which are dug out and which are devoid of metal\r\nare removed in bowls, and are thrown back, thus once more filling the\r\ncaverns.\r\n\r\nNext, as to _venae cumulatae_. These are dug by a somewhat different\r\nmethod, for when one of these shows some metal at the top of the ground,\r\nfirst of all one shaft is sunk; then, if it is worth while, around this\r\none many shafts are sunk and tunnels are driven into the mountain. If a\r\ntorrent or spring has torn fragments of metal from such a vein, a tunnel\r\nis first driven into the mountain or hill for the purpose of searching\r\nfor the ore; then when it is found, a vertical shaft is sunk in it.\r\nSince the whole mountain, or more especially the whole hill, is\r\nundermined, seeing that the whole of it is composed of ore, it is\r\nnecessary to leave the natural pillars and arches, or the place is\r\ntimbered. But sometimes when a vein is very hard it is broken by fire,\r\nwhereby it happens that the soft pillars break up, or the timbers are\r\nburnt away, and the mountain by its great weight sinks into itself, and\r\nthen the shaft buildings are swallowed up in the great subsidence.\r\nTherefore, about a _vena cumulata_ it is advisable to sink some shafts\r\nwhich are not subject to this kind of ruin, through which the materials\r\nthat are excavated may be carried out, not only while the pillars and\r\nunderpinnings still remain whole and solid, but also after the supports\r\nhave been destroyed by fire and have fallen. Since ore which has thus\r\nfallen must necessarily be broken by fire, new shafts through which the\r\nsmoke can escape must be sunk in the abyss. At those places where\r\nstringers intersect, richer ore is generally obtained from the mine;\r\nthese stringers, in the case of tin mines, sometimes have in them black\r\nstones the size of a walnut. If such a vein is found in a plain, as not\r\ninfrequently happens in the case of iron, many shafts are sunk, because\r\nthey cannot be sunk very deep. The work is carried on by this method\r\nbecause the miners cannot drive a tunnel into a level plain of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThere remain the stringers in which gold alone is sometimes found, in\r\nthe vicinity of rivers and streams, or in swamps. If upon the soil being\r\nremoved, many of these are found, composed of earth somewhat baked and\r\nburnt, as may sometimes be seen in clay pits, there is some hope that\r\ngold may be obtained from them, especially if several join together. But\r\nthe very point of junction must be pierced, and the length and width\r\nsearched for ore, and in these places very deep shafts cannot be sunk.\r\n\r\nI have completed one part of this book, and now come to the other, in\r\nwhich I will deal with the art of surveying. Miners measure the solid\r\nmass of the mountains in order that the owners may lay out their plans,\r\nand that their workmen may not encroach on other people's possessions.\r\nThe surveyor either measures the interval not yet wholly dug through,\r\nwhich lies between the mouth of a tunnel and a shaft to be sunk to that\r\ndepth, or between the mouth of a shaft and the tunnel to be driven to\r\nthat spot which lies under the shaft, or between both, if the tunnel is\r\nneither so long as to reach to the shaft, nor the shaft so deep as to\r\nreach to the tunnel; and thus on both sides work is still to be done. Or\r\nin some cases, within the tunnels and drifts, are to be fixed the\r\nboundaries of the meers, just as the _Bergmeister_ has determined the\r\nboundaries of the same meers above ground.[16]\r\n\r\nEach method of surveying depends on the measuring of triangles. A small\r\ntriangle should be laid out, and from it calculations must be made\r\nregarding a larger one. Most particular care must be taken that we do\r\nnot deviate at all from a correct measuring; for if, at the beginning,\r\nwe are drawn by carelessness into a slight error, this at the end will\r\nproduce great errors. Now these triangles are of many shapes, since\r\nshafts differ among themselves and are not all sunk by one and the same\r\nmethod into the depths of the earth, nor do the slopes of all mountains\r\ncome down to the valley or plain in the same manner. For if a shaft is\r\nvertical, there is a triangle with a right angle, which the Greeks call\r\n[Greek: orthogonion] and this, according to the inequalities of the\r\nmountain slope, has either two equal sides or three unequal sides. The\r\nGreeks call the former [Greek: trigonon isoskeles] the latter [Greek:\r\nskalenon] for a right angle triangle cannot have three equal sides. If a\r\nshaft is inclined and sunk in the same vein in which the tunnel is\r\ndriven, a triangle is likewise made with a right angle, and this again,\r\naccording to the various inequalities of the mountain slope, has either\r\ntwo equal or three unequal sides. But if a shaft is inclined and is sunk\r\nin one vein, and a tunnel is driven in another vein, then a triangle\r\ncomes into existence which has either an obtuse angle or all acute\r\nangles. The former the Greeks call [Greek: amblygonion], the latter\r\n[Greek: oxygonion]. That triangle which has an obtuse angle cannot have\r\nthree equal sides, but in accordance with the different mountain slopes\r\nhas either two equal sides or three unequal sides. That triangle which\r\nhas all acute angles in accordance with the different mountain slopes\r\nhas either three equal sides, which the Greeks call [Greek: trigonon\r\nisopleuron] or two equal sides or three unequal sides.\r\n\r\nThe surveyor, as I said, employs his art when the owners of the mines\r\ndesire to know how many fathoms of the intervening ground require to be\r\ndug; when a tunnel is being driven toward a shaft and does not yet reach\r\nit; or when the shaft has not yet been sunk to the depth of the bottom\r\nof the tunnel which is under it; or when neither the tunnel reaches to\r\nthat point, nor has the shaft been sunk to it. It is of importance that\r\nminers should know how many fathoms remain from the tunnel to the shaft,\r\nor from the shaft to the tunnel, in order to calculate the expenditure;\r\nand in order that the owners of a metal-bearing mine may hasten the\r\nsinking of a shaft and the excavation of the metal, before the tunnel\r\nreaches that point and the tunnel owners excavate part of the metal by\r\nany right of their own; and on the other hand, it is important that the\r\nowners of a tunnel may similarly hasten their driving before a shaft can\r\nbe sunk to the depth of a tunnel, so that they may excavate the metal to\r\nwhich they will have a right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 131 (Surveying): A--Upright forked posts.

L--Weight of third cord. M--First side minor triangle.\r\nN--Second side minor triangle. O--Third side minor triangle. P--The\r\nminor triangle.]\r\n\r\nThe surveyor, first of all, if the beams of the shaft-house do not give\r\nhim the opportunity, sets a pair of forked posts by the sides of the\r\nshaft in such a manner that a pole may be laid across them. Next, from\r\nthe pole he lets down into the shaft a cord with a weight attached to\r\nit. Then he stretches a second cord, attached to the upper end of the\r\nfirst cord, right down along the slope of the mountain to the bottom of\r\nthe mouth of the tunnel, and fixes it to the ground. Next, from the same\r\npole not far from the first cord, he lets down a third cord, similarly\r\nweighted, so that it may intersect the second cord, which descends\r\nobliquely. Then, starting from that point where the third cord cuts the\r\nsecond cord which descends obliquely to the mouth of the tunnel, he\r\nmeasures the second cord upward to where it reaches the end of the\r\nfirst cord, and makes a note of this first side of the minor\r\ntriangle[17]. Afterward, starting again from that point where the third\r\ncord intersects the second cord, he measures the straight space which\r\nlies between that point and the opposite point on the first cord, and in\r\nthat way forms the minor triangle, and he notes this second side of the\r\nminor triangle in the same way as before. Then, if it is necessary, from\r\nthe angle formed by the first cord and the second side of the minor\r\ntriangle, he measures upward to the end of the first cord and also makes\r\na note of this third side of the minor triangle. The third side of the\r\nminor triangle, if the shaft is vertical or inclined and is sunk on the\r\nsame vein in which the tunnel is driven, will necessarily be the same\r\nlength as the third cord above the point where it intersects the second\r\ncord; and so, as often as the first side of the minor triangle is\r\ncontained in the length of the whole cord which descends obliquely, so\r\nmany times the length of the second side of the minor triangle indicates\r\nthe distance between the mouth of the tunnel and the point to which the\r\nshaft must be sunk; and similarly, so many times the length of the third\r\nside of the minor triangle gives the distance between the mouth of the\r\nshaft and the bottom of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a level bench on the mountain slope, the surveyor first\r\nmeasures across this with a measuring-rod; then at the edges of this\r\nbench he sets up forked posts, and applies the principle of the triangle\r\nto the two sloping parts of the mountain; and to the fathoms which are\r\nthe length of that part of the tunnel determined by the triangles, he\r\nadds the number of fathoms which are the width of the bench. But if\r\nsometimes the mountain side stands up, so that a cord cannot run down\r\nfrom the shaft to the mouth of the tunnel, or, on the other hand, cannot\r\nrun up from the mouth of the tunnel to the shaft, and, therefore, one\r\ncannot connect them in a straight line, the surveyor, in order to fix an\r\naccurate triangle, measures the mountain; and going downward he\r\nsubstitutes for the first part of the cord a pole one fathom long, and\r\nfor the second part a pole half a fathom long. Going upward, on the\r\ncontrary, for the first part of the cord he substitutes a pole half a\r\nfathom long, and for the next part, one a whole fathom long; then where\r\nhe requires to fix his triangle he adds a straight line to these angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 133 (Surveying Triangle): A triangle having a right angle\r\nand two equal sides.]\r\n\r\nTo make this system of measuring clear and more explicit, I will proceed\r\nby describing each separate kind of triangle. When a shaft is vertical\r\nor inclined, and is sunk in the same vein on which the tunnel is driven,\r\nthere is created, as I said, a triangle containing a right angle. Now if\r\nthe minor triangle has the two sides equal, which, in accordance with\r\nthe numbering used by surveyors, are the second and third sides, then\r\nthe second and third sides of the major triangle will be equal; and so\r\nalso the intervening distances will be equal which lie between the mouth\r\nof the tunnel and the bottom of the shaft, and which lie between the\r\nmouth of the shaft and the bottom of the tunnel. For example, if the\r\nfirst side of the minor triangle is seven feet long and the second and\r\nlikewise the third sides are five feet, and the length shown by the\r\ncord for the side of the major triangle is 101 times seven feet, that is\r\n117 fathoms and five feet, then the intervening space, of course,\r\nwhether the whole of it has been already driven through or has yet to be\r\ndriven, will be one hundred times five feet, which makes eighty-three\r\nfathoms and two feet. Anyone with this example of proportions will be\r\nable to construct the major and minor triangles in the same way as I\r\nhave done, if there be the necessary upright posts and cross-beams. When\r\na shaft is vertical the triangle is absolutely upright; when it is\r\ninclined and is sunk on the same vein in which the tunnel is driven, it\r\nis inclined toward one side. Therefore, if a tunnel has been driven into\r\nthe mountain for sixty fathoms, there remains a space of ground to be\r\npenetrated twenty-three fathoms and two feet long; for five feet of the\r\nsecond side of the major triangle, which lies above the mouth of the\r\nshaft and corresponds with the first side of the minor triangle, must\r\nnot be added. Therefore, if the shaft has been sunk in the middle of the\r\nhead meer, a tunnel sixty fathoms long will reach to the boundary of the\r\nmeer only when the tunnel has been extended a further two fathoms and\r\ntwo feet; but if the shaft is located in the middle of an ordinary meer,\r\nthen the boundary will be reached when the tunnel has been driven a\r\nfurther length of nine fathoms and two feet. Since a tunnel, for every\r\none hundred fathoms of length, rises in grade one fathom, or at all\r\nevents, ought to rise as it proceeds toward the shaft, one more fathom\r\nmust always be taken from the depth allowed to the shaft, and one added\r\nto the length allowed to the tunnel. Proportionately, because a tunnel\r\nfifty fathoms long is raised half a fathom, this amount must be taken\r\nfrom the depth of the shaft and added to the length of the tunnel. In\r\nthe same way if a tunnel is one hundred or fifty fathoms shorter or\r\nlonger, the same proportion also must be taken from the depth of the one\r\nand added to the length of the other. For this reason, in the case\r\nmentioned above, half a fathom and a little more must be added to the\r\ndistance to be driven through, so that there remain twenty-three\r\nfathoms, five feet, two palms, one and a half digits and a fifth of a\r\ndigit; that is, if even the minutest proportions are carried out; and\r\nsurveyors do not neglect these without good cause. Similarly, if the\r\nshaft is seventy fathoms deep, in order that it may reach to the bottom\r\nof the tunnel, it still must be sunk a further depth of thirteen fathoms\r\nand two feet, or rather twelve fathoms and a half, one foot, two digits,\r\nand four-fifths of half a digit. And in this instance five feet must be\r\ndeducted from the reckoning, because these five feet complete the third\r\nside of the minor triangle, which is above the mouth of the shaft, and\r\nfrom its depth there must be deducted half a fathom, two palms, one and\r\na half digits and the fifth part of half a digit. But if the tunnel has\r\nbeen driven to a point where it is under the shaft, then to reach the\r\nroof of the tunnel the shaft must still be sunk a depth of eleven\r\nfathoms, two and a half feet, one palm, two digits, and four-fifths of\r\nhalf a digit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 134 (Surveying Triangle): A triangle having a right angle\r\nand three unequal sides.]\r\n\r\nIf a minor triangle is produced of the kind having three unequal sides,\r\nthen the sides of the greater triangle cannot be equal; that is, if the\r\nfirst side of the minor triangle is eight feet long, the second six feet\r\nlong, and the third five feet long, and the cord along the side of the\r\ngreater triangle, not to go too far from the example just given, is one\r\nhundred and one times eight feet, that is, one hundred and thirty-four\r\nfathoms and four feet, the distance which lies between the mouth of the\r\ntunnel and the bottom of the shaft will occupy one hundred times six\r\nfeet in length, that is, one hundred fathoms. The distance between the\r\nmouth of the shaft and the bottom of the tunnel is one hundred times\r\nfive feet, that is, eighty-three fathoms and two feet. And so, if the\r\ntunnel is eighty-five fathoms long, the remainder to be driven into the\r\nmountain is fifteen fathoms long, and here, too, a correction in\r\nmeasurement must be taken from the depth of the shaft and added to the\r\nlength of the tunnel; what this is precisely, I will pursue no further,\r\nsince everyone having a small knowledge of arithmetic can work it out.\r\nIf the shaft is sixty-seven fathoms deep, in order that it may reach the\r\nbottom of the tunnel, the further distance required to be sunk amounts\r\nto sixteen fathoms and two feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 135a (Surveying Triangle): Triangle having an obtuse angle\r\nand two equal sides.]\r\n\r\nThe surveyor employs this same method in measuring the mountain, whether\r\nthe shaft and tunnel are on one and the same vein, whether the vein is\r\nvertical or inclined, or whether the shaft is on the principal vein and\r\nthe tunnel on a transverse vein descending vertically to the depths of\r\nthe earth; in the latter case the excavation is to be made where the\r\ntransverse vein cuts the vertical vein. If the principal vein descends\r\non an incline and the cross-vein descends vertically, then a minor\r\ntriangle is created having one obtuse angle or all three angles acute.\r\nIf the minor triangle has one angle obtuse and the two sides which are\r\nthe second and third are equal, then the second and third sides of the\r\nmajor triangle will be equal, so that if the first side of the minor\r\ntriangle is nine feet, the second, and likewise the third, will be five\r\nfeet. Then the first side of the major triangle will be one hundred and\r\none times nine feet, or one hundred and fifty-one and one-half fathoms,\r\nand each of the other sides of the major triangle will be one hundred\r\ntimes five feet, that is, eighty-three fathoms and two feet. But when\r\nthe first shaft is inclined, generally speaking, it is not deep; but\r\nthere are usually several, all inclined, and one always following the\r\nother. Therefore, if a tunnel is seventy-seven fathoms long, it will\r\nreach to the middle of the bottom of a shaft when six fathoms and two\r\nfeet further have been sunk. But if all such inclined shafts are\r\nseventy-six fathoms deep, in order that the last one may reach the\r\nbottom of the tunnel, a depth of seven fathoms and two feet remains to\r\nbe sunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 135b (Surveying Triangle): Triangle having an obtuse angle\r\nand three unequal sides.]\r\n\r\nIf a minor triangle is made which has an obtuse angle and three unequal\r\nsides, then again the sides of the large triangle cannot be equal. For\r\nexample, if the first side of the minor triangle is six feet long, the\r\nsecond three feet, and the third four feet, and the cord along the side\r\nof the greater triangle one hundred and one times six feet, that is, one\r\nhundred and one fathoms, the distance between the mouth of the tunnel\r\nand the bottom of the last shaft will be a length one hundred times\r\nthree feet, or fifty fathoms; but the depth that lies between the mouth\r\nof the first shaft and the bottom of the tunnel is one hundred times\r\nfour feet, or sixty-six fathoms and four feet. Therefore, if a tunnel is\r\nforty-four fathoms long, the remaining distance to be driven is six\r\nfathoms. If the shafts are fifty-eight fathoms deep, the newest will\r\ntouch the bottom of the tunnel when eight fathoms and four feet have\r\nbeen sunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 136a (Surveying Triangle): A triangle having all its\r\nangles acute and its three sides equal.]\r\n\r\nIf a minor triangle is produced which has all its angles acute and its\r\nthree sides equal, then necessarily the second and third sides of the\r\nminor triangle will be equal, and likewise the sides of the major\r\ntriangle frequently referred to will be equal. Thus if each side of the\r\nminor triangle is six feet long, and the cord measurement for the side\r\nof the major triangle is one hundred and one times six feet, that is,\r\none hundred and one fathoms, then both the distances to be dug will be\r\none hundred fathoms. And thus if the tunnel is ninety fathoms long, it\r\nwill reach the middle of the bottom of the last shaft when ten fathoms\r\nfurther have been driven. If the shafts are ninety-five fathoms deep,\r\nthe last will reach the bottom of the tunnel when it is sunk a further\r\ndepth of five fathoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 136b (Surveying Triangle): Triangle having all its angles\r\nacute and two sides equal, A, B, unequal side C.]\r\n\r\nIf a triangle is made which has all its angles acute, but only two sides\r\nequal, namely, the first and third, then the second and third sides are\r\nnot equal; therefore the distances to be dug cannot be equal. For\r\nexample, if the first side of the minor triangle is six feet long, and\r\nthe second is four feet, and the third is six feet, and the cord\r\nmeasurement for the side of the major triangle is one hundred and one\r\ntimes six feet, that is, one hundred and one fathoms, then the distance\r\nbetween the mouth of the tunnel and the bottom of the last shaft will be\r\nsixty-six fathoms and four feet. But the distance from the mouth of the\r\nfirst shaft to the bottom of the tunnel is one hundred fathoms. So if\r\nthe tunnel is sixty fathoms long, the remaining distance to be driven\r\ninto the mountain is six fathoms and four feet. If the shaft is\r\nninety-seven fathoms deep, the last one will reach the bottom of the\r\ntunnel when a further depth of three fathoms has been sunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 137 (Surveying Triangle): A triangle having all its angles\r\nacute and its three sides unequal.]\r\n\r\nIf a minor triangle is produced which has all its angles acute, but its\r\nthree sides unequal, then again the distances to be dug cannot be equal.\r\nFor example, if the first side of the minor triangle is seven feet long,\r\nthe second side is four feet, and the third side is six feet, and the\r\ncord measurement for the side of the major triangle is one hundred and\r\none times seven feet or one hundred and seventeen fathoms and four feet,\r\nthe distance between the mouth of the tunnel and the bottom of the last\r\nshaft will be four hundred feet or sixty-six fathoms, and the depth\r\nbetween the mouth of the first shaft and the bottom of the tunnel will\r\nbe one hundred fathoms. Therefore, if a tunnel is fifty fathoms long, it\r\nwill reach the middle of the bottom of the newest shaft when it has been\r\ndriven sixteen fathoms and four feet further. But if the shafts are then\r\nninety-two fathoms deep, the last shaft will reach the bottom of the\r\ntunnel when it has been sunk a further eight fathoms.\r\n\r\nThis is the method of the surveyor in measuring the mountain, if the\r\nprincipal vein descends inclined into the depths of the earth or the\r\ntransverse vein is vertical. But if they are both inclined, the surveyor\r\nuses the same method, or he measures the slope of the mountain\r\nseparately from the slope of the shaft. Next, if a transverse vein in\r\nwhich a tunnel is driven does not cut the principal vein in that spot\r\nwhere the shaft is sunk, then it is necessary for the starting point of\r\nthe survey to be in the other shaft in which the transverse vein cuts\r\nthe principal vein. But if there be no shaft on that spot where the\r\noutcrop of the transverse vein cuts the outcrop of the principal vein,\r\nthen the surface of the ground which lies between the shafts must be\r\nmeasured, or that between the shaft and the place where the outcrop of\r\nthe one vein intersects the outcrop of the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 138 (Hemicycle): A--Waxed semicircle of the hemicycle.\r\nB--Semicircular lines.

B--Lines of the rod which separate major spaces.]\r\n\r\nSome surveyors, although they use three cords, nevertheless ascertain\r\nonly the length of a tunnel by that method of measuring, and determine\r\nthe depth of a shaft by another method; that is, by the method by which\r\ncords are re-stretched on a level part of the mountain or in a valley,\r\nor in flat fields, and are measured again. Some, however, do not employ\r\nthis method in surveying the depth of a shaft and the length of a\r\ntunnel, but use only two cords, a graduated hemicycle[18] and a rod half\r\na fathom long. They suspend in the shaft one cord, fastened from the\r\nupper pole and weighted, just as the others do. Fastened to the upper\r\nend of this cord, they stretch another right down the slope of the\r\nmountain to the bottom of the mouth of the tunnel and fix it to the\r\nground. Then to the upper part of this second cord they apply on its\r\nlower side the broad part of a hemicycle. This consists of half a\r\ncircle, the outer margin of which is covered with wax, and within this\r\nare six semi-circular lines. From the waxed margin through the first\r\nsemi-circular line, and reaching to the second, there proceed straight\r\nlines converging toward the centre of the hemicycle; these mark the\r\nmiddles of intervening spaces lying between other straight lines which\r\nextend to the fourth semi-circular line. But all lines whatsoever, from\r\nthe waxed margin up to the fourth line, whether they go beyond it or\r\nnot, correspond with the graduated lines which mark the minor spaces of\r\na rod. Those which go beyond the fourth line correspond with the lines\r\nmarking the major spaces on the rod, and those which proceed further,\r\nmark the middle of the intervening space which lies between the others.\r\nThe straight lines, which run from the fifth to the sixth semi-circular\r\nline, show nothing further. Nor does the line which measures the half,\r\nshow anything when it has already passed from the sixth straight line to\r\nthe base of the hemicycle. When the hemicycle is applied to the cord, if\r\nits tongue indicates the sixth straight line which lies between the\r\nsecond and third semi-circular lines, the surveyor counts on the rod six\r\nlines which separate the minor spaces, and if the length of this portion\r\nof the rod be taken from the second cord, as many times as the cord\r\nitself is half-fathoms long, the remaining length of cord shows the\r\ndistance the tunnel must be driven to reach under the shaft. But if he\r\nsees that the tongue has gone so far that it marks the sixth line\r\nbetween the fourth and fifth semi-circular lines, he counts six lines\r\nwhich separate the major spaces on the rod; and this entire space is\r\ndeducted from the length of the second cord, as many times as the number\r\nof whole fathoms which the cord contains; and then, in like manner, the\r\nremaining length of cord shows us the distance the tunnel must be driven\r\nto reach under the shaft.[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 139 (Surveying Triangle): Stretched cords: A--First cord.\r\nB--Second cord. C--Third cord. D--Triangle.]\r\n\r\nBoth these surveyors, as well as the others, in the first place make\r\nuse of the haulage rope. These they measure by means of others made of\r\nlinden bark, because the latter do not stretch at all, while the former\r\nbecome very slack. These cords they stretch on the surveyor's field, the\r\nfirst one to represent the parts of mountain slopes which descend\r\nobliquely. Then the second cord, which represents the length of the\r\ntunnel to be driven to reach the shaft, they place straight, in such a\r\ndirection that one end of it can touch the lower end of the first cord;\r\nthen they similarly lay the third cord straight, and in such a direction\r\nthat its upper end may touch the upper end of the first cord, and its\r\nlower end the other extremity of the second cord, and thus a triangle is\r\nformed. This third cord is measured by the instrument with the index, to\r\ndetermine its relation to the perpendicular; and the length of this cord\r\nshows the depth of the shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 140 (Surveying Triangles): Stretched cords: A--First.\r\nB--Second. B--Third. C--Fourth. C--Fifth. D--Quadrangle.]\r\n\r\nSome surveyors, to make their system of measuring the depth of a shaft\r\nmore certain, use five stretched cords: the first one descending\r\nobliquely; two, that is to say the second and third, for ascertaining\r\nthe length of the tunnel; two for the depth of the shaft; in which way\r\nthey form a quadrangle divided into two equal triangles, and this tends\r\nto greater accuracy.\r\n\r\nThese systems of measuring the depth of a shaft and the length of a\r\ntunnel, are accurate when the vein and also the shaft or shafts go down\r\nto the tunnel vertically or inclined, in an uninterrupted course. The\r\nsame is true when a tunnel runs straight on to a shaft. But when each of\r\nthem bends now in this, now in that direction, if they have not been\r\ncompletely driven and sunk, no living man is clever enough to judge how\r\nfar they are deflected from a straight course. But if the whole of\r\neither one of the two has been excavated its full distance, then we can\r\nestimate more easily the length of one, or the depth of the other; and\r\nso the location of the tunnel, which is below a newly-started shaft, is\r\ndetermined by a method of surveying which I will describe. First of all\r\na tripod is fixed at the mouth of the tunnel, and likewise at the mouth\r\nof the shaft which has been started, or at the place where the shaft\r\nwill be started. The tripod is made of three stakes fixed to the ground,\r\na small rectangular board being placed upon the stakes and fixed to\r\nthem, and on this is set a compass. Then from the lower tripod a\r\nweighted cord is let down perpendicularly to the earth, close to which\r\ncord a stake is fixed in the ground. To this stake another cord is tied\r\nand drawn straight into the tunnel to a point as far as it can go\r\nwithout being bent by the hangingwall or the footwall of the vein. Next,\r\nfrom the cord which hangs from the lower tripod, a third cord likewise\r\nfixed is brought straight up the sloping side of the mountain to the\r\nstake of the upper tripod, and fastened to it. In order that the\r\nmeasuring of the depth of the shaft may be more certain, the third cord\r\nshould touch one and the same side of the cord hanging from the lower\r\ntripod which is touched by the second cord--the one which is drawn into\r\nthe tunnel. All this having been correctly carried out, the surveyor,\r\nwhen at length the cord which has been drawn straight into the tunnel is\r\nabout to be bent by the hangingwall or footwall, places a plank in the\r\nbottom of the tunnel and on it sets the orbis, an instrument which has\r\nan indicator peculiar to itself. This instrument, although it also has\r\nwaxed circles, differs from the other, which I have described in the\r\nthird book. But by both these instruments, as well as by a rule and a\r\nsquare, he determines whether the stretched cords reach straight to the\r\nextreme end of the tunnel, or whether they sometimes reach straight, and\r\nare sometimes bent by the footwall or hangingwall. Each instrument is\r\ndivided into parts, but the compass into twenty-four parts, the orbis\r\ninto sixteen parts; for first of all it is divided into four principal\r\nparts, and then each of these is again divided into four. Both have\r\nwaxed circles, but the compass has seven circles, and the orbis only\r\nfive circles. These waxed circles the surveyor marks, whichever\r\ninstrument he uses, and by the succession of these same marks he notes\r\nany change in the direction in which the cord extends. The orbis has an\r\nopening running from its outer edge as far as the centre, into which\r\nopening he puts an iron screw, to which he binds the second cord, and by\r\nscrewing it into the plank, fixes it so that the orbis may be immovable.\r\nHe takes care to prevent the second cord, and afterward the others which\r\nare put up, from being pulled off the screw, by employing a heavy iron,\r\ninto an opening of which he fixes the head of the screw. In the case of\r\nthe compass, since it has no opening, he merely places it by the side of\r\nthe screw. That the instrument does not incline forward or backward, and\r\nin that way the measurement become a greater length than it should be,\r\nhe sets upon the instrument a standing plummet level, the tongue of\r\nwhich, if the instrument is level, indicates no numbers, but the point\r\nfrom which the numbers start.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 142 (Compass): Compass. A, B, C, D, E, F, G are the seven\r\nwaxed circles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 142A (Orbis): A, B, C, D, E--Five waxed circles of the\r\n_orbis_. F--Opening of same. G--Screw. H--Perforated iron.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 143 (Miner using level): A--Standing plummet level.\r\nB--Tongue. C--Level and tongue.]\r\n\r\nWhen the surveyor has carefully observed each separate angle of the\r\ntunnel and has measured such parts as he ought to measure, then he lays\r\nthem out in the same way on the surveyor's field[20] in the open air,\r\nand again no less carefully observes each separate angle and measures\r\nthem. First of all, to each angle, according as the calculation of his\r\ntriangle and his art require it, he lays out a straight cord as a line.\r\nThen he stretches a cord at such an angle as represents the slope of\r\nthe mountain, so that its lower end may reach the end of the straight\r\ncord; then he stretches a third cord similarly straight and at such an\r\nangle, that with its upper end it may reach the upper end of the second\r\ncord, and with its lower end the last end of the first cord. The length\r\nof the third cord shows the depth of the shaft, as I said before, and at\r\nthe same time that point on the tunnel to which the shaft will reach\r\nwhen it has been sunk.\r\n\r\nIf one or more shafts reach the tunnel through intermediate drifts and\r\nshafts, the surveyor, starting from the nearest which is open to the\r\nair, measures in a shorter time the depth of the shaft which requires to\r\nbe sunk, than if he starts from the mouth of the tunnel. First of all he\r\nmeasures that space on the surface which lies between the shaft which\r\nhas been sunk and the one which requires to be sunk. Then he measures\r\nthe incline of all the shafts which it is necessary to measure, and the\r\nlength of all the drifts with which they are in any way connected to the\r\ntunnel. Lastly, he measures part of the tunnel; and when all this is\r\nproperly done, he demonstrates the depth of the shaft and the point in\r\nthe tunnel to which the shaft will reach. But sometimes a very deep\r\nstraight shaft requires to be sunk at the same place where there is a\r\nprevious inclined shaft, and to the same depth, in order that loads may\r\nbe raised and drawn straight up by machines. Those machines on the\r\nsurface are turned by horses; those inside the earth, by the same means,\r\nand also by water-power. And so, if it becomes necessary to sink such a\r\nshaft, the surveyor first of all fixes an iron screw in the upper part\r\nof the old shaft, and from the screw he lets down a cord as far as the\r\nfirst angle, where again he fixes a screw, and again lets down the cord\r\nas far as the second angle; this he repeats again and again until the\r\ncord reaches to the bottom of the shaft. Then to each angle of the cord\r\nhe applies a hemicycle, and marks the waxed semi-circle according to the\r\nlines which the tongue indicates, and designates it by a number, in case\r\nit should be moved; then he measures the separate parts of the cord with\r\nanother cord made of linden bark. Afterward, when he has come back out\r\nof the shaft, he goes away and transfers the markings from the waxed\r\nsemi-circle of the hemicycle to an orbis similarly waxed. Lastly, the\r\ncords are stretched on the surveyor's field, and he measures the angles,\r\nas the system of measuring by triangles requires, and ascertains which\r\npart of the footwall and which part of the hangingwall rock must be cut\r\naway in order that the shaft may descend straight. But if the surveyor\r\nis required to show the owners of the mine, the spot in a drift or a\r\ntunnel in which a shaft needs to be raised from the bottom upward, that\r\nit should cut through more quickly, he begins measuring from the bottom\r\nof the drift or tunnel, at a point beyond the spot at which the bottom\r\nof the shaft will arrive, when it has been sunk. When he has measured\r\nthe part of the drift or tunnel up to the first shaft which connects\r\nwith an upper drift, he measures the incline of this shaft by applying a\r\nhemicycle or orbis to the cord. Then in a like manner he measures the\r\nupper drift and the incline shaft which is sunk therein toward which a\r\nraise is being dug, then again all the cords are stretched in the\r\nsurveyor's field, the last cord in such a way that it reaches the first,\r\nand then he measures them. From this measurement is known in what part\r\nof the drift or tunnel the raise should be made, and how many fathoms\r\nof vein remain to be broken through in order that the shaft may be\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nI have described the first reason for surveying; I will now describe\r\nanother. When one vein comes near another, and their owners are\r\ndifferent persons who have late come into possession, whether they drive\r\na tunnel or a drift, or sink a shaft, they may encroach, or seem to\r\nencroach, without any lawful right, upon the boundaries of the older\r\nowners, for which reason the latter very often seek redress, or take\r\nlegal proceedings. The surveyor either himself settles the dispute\r\nbetween the owners, or by his art gives evidence to the judges for\r\nmaking their decision, that one shall not encroach on the mine of the\r\nother. Thus, first of all he measures the mines of each party with a\r\nbasket rope and cords of linden bark; and having applied to the cords an\r\norbis or a compass, he notes the directions in which they extend. Then\r\nhe stretches the cords on the surveyor's field; and starting from that\r\npoint whose owners are in possession of the old meer toward the other,\r\nwhether it is in the hanging or footwall of the vein, he stretches a\r\ncross-cord in a straight line, according to the sixth division of the\r\ncompass, that is, at a right angle to the vein, for a distance of three\r\nand a half fathoms, and assigns to the older owners that which belongs\r\nto them. But if both ends of one vein are being dug out in two tunnels,\r\nor drifts from opposite directions, the surveyor first of all considers\r\nthe lower tunnel or drift and afterward the upper one, and judges how\r\nmuch each of them has risen little by little. On each side strong men\r\ntake in their hands a stretched cord and hold it so that there is no\r\npoint where it is not strained tight; on each side the surveyor supports\r\nthe cord with a rod half a fathom long, and stays the rod at the end\r\nwith a short stick as often as he thinks it necessary. But some fasten\r\ncords to the rods to make them steadier. The surveyor attaches a\r\nsuspended plummet level to the middle of the cord to enable him to\r\ncalculate more accurately on both sides, and from this he ascertains\r\nwhether one tunnel has risen more than another, or in like manner one\r\ndrift more than another. Afterward he measures the incline of the shafts\r\non both sides, so that he can estimate their position on each side. Then\r\nhe easily sees how many fathoms remain in the space which must be broken\r\nthrough. But the grade of each tunnel, as I said, should rise one fathom\r\nin the distance of one hundred fathoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 146 (Plummet cord and weight): Indicator of a suspended\r\nplummet level.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 147 (Compass): A--Needle of the instrument. B--Its tongue.\r\nC, D, E--Holes in the tongue.]\r\n\r\nThe Swiss surveyors, when they wish to measure tunnels driven into the\r\nhighest mountains, also use a rod half a fathom long, but composed of\r\nthree parts, which screw together, so that they may be shortened. They\r\nuse a cord made of linden bark to which are fastened slips of paper\r\nshowing the number of fathoms. They also employ an instrument peculiar\r\nto them, which has a needle; but in place of the waxed circles they\r\ncarry in their hands a chart on which they inscribe the readings of the\r\ninstrument. The instrument is placed on the back part of the rod so that\r\nthe tongue, and the extended cord which runs through the three holes in\r\nthe tongue, demonstrates the direction, and they note the number of\r\nfathoms. The tongue shows whether the cord inclines forward or backward.\r\nThe tongue does not hang, as in the case of the suspended plummet\r\nlevel, but is fixed to the instrument in a half-lying position. They\r\nmeasure the tunnels for the purpose of knowing how many fathoms they\r\nhave been increased in elevation; how many fathoms the lower is distant\r\nfrom the upper one; how many fathoms of interval is not yet pierced\r\nbetween the miners who on opposite sides are digging on the same vein,\r\nor cross-stringers, or two veins which are approaching one another.\r\n\r\nBut I return to our mines. If the surveyor desires to fix the boundaries\r\nof the meer within the tunnels or drifts, and mark to them with a sign\r\ncut in the rock, in the same way that the _Bergmeister_ has marked these\r\nboundaries above ground, he first of all ascertains, by measuring in the\r\nmanner which I have explained above, which part of the tunnel or drift\r\nlies beneath the surface boundary mark, stretching the cords along the\r\ndrifts to a point beyond that spot in the rock where he judges the mark\r\nshould be cut. Then, after the same cords have been laid out on the\r\nsurveyor's field, he starts from that upper cord at a point which shows\r\nthe boundary mark, and stretches another cross-cord straight downward\r\naccording to the sixth division of the compass--that is at a right\r\nangle. Then that part of the lowest cord which lies beyond the part to\r\nwhich the cross-cord runs being removed, it shows at what point the\r\nboundary mark should be cut into the rock of the tunnel or drift. The\r\ncutting is made in the presence of the two Jurors and the manager and\r\nthe foreman of each mine. For as the _Bergmeister_ in the presence of\r\nthese same persons sets the boundary stones on the surface, so the\r\nsurveyor cuts in the rock a sign which for this reason is called the\r\nboundary rock. If he fixes the boundary mark of a meer in which a shaft\r\nhas recently begun to be sunk on a vein, first of all he measures and\r\nnotes the incline of that shaft by the compass or by another way with\r\nthe applied cords; then he measures all the drifts up to that one in\r\nwhose rock the boundary mark has to be cut. Of these drifts he measures\r\neach angle; then the cords, being laid out on the surveyor's field, in a\r\nsimilar way he stretches a cross-cord, as I said, and cuts the sign on\r\nthe rock. But if the underground boundary rock has to be cut in a drift\r\nwhich lies beneath the first drift, the surveyor starts from the mark in\r\nthe first drift, notes the different angles, one by one, takes his\r\nmeasurements, and in the lower drift stretches a cord beyond that place\r\nwhere he judges the mark ought to be cut; and then, as I said before,\r\nlays out the cords on the surveyor's field. Even if a vein runs\r\ndifferently in the lower drift from the upper one, in which the first\r\nboundary mark has been cut in the rock, still, in the lower drift the\r\nmark must be cut in the rock vertically beneath. For if he cuts the\r\nlower mark obliquely from the upper one some part of the possession of\r\none mine is taken away to its detriment, and given to the other.\r\nMoreover, if it happens that the underground boundary mark requires to\r\nbe cut in an angle, the surveyor, starting from that angle, measures one\r\nfathom toward the front of the mine and another fathom toward the back,\r\nand from these measurements forms a triangle, and dividing its middle by\r\na cross-cord, makes his cutting for the boundary mark.\r\n\r\nLastly, the surveyor sometimes, in order to make more certain, finds the\r\nboundary of the meers in those places where many old boundary marks are\r\ncut in the rock. Then, starting from a stake fixed on the surface, he\r\nfirst of all measures to the nearest mine; then he measures one shaft\r\nafter another; then he fixes a stake on the surveyors' field, and making\r\na beginning from it stretches the same cords in the same way and\r\nmeasures them, and again fixes in the ground a stake which for him will\r\nsignify the end of his measuring. Afterward he again measures\r\nunderground from that spot at which he left off, as many shafts and\r\ndrifts as he can remember. Then he returns to the surveyor's field, and\r\nstarting again from the second stake, makes his measurements; and he\r\ndoes this as far as the drift in which the boundary mark must be cut in\r\nthe rock. Finally, commencing from the stake first fixed in the ground,\r\nhe stretches a cross-cord in a straight line to the last stake, and this\r\nshows the length of the lowest drift. The point where they touch, he\r\njudges to be the place where the underground boundary mark should be\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] It has been suggested that we should adopt throughout this volume\r\nthe mechanical and mining terms used in English mines at Agricola's\r\ntime. We believe, however, that but a little inquiry would illustrate\r\nthe undesirability of this course as a whole. Where there is choice in\r\nmodern miner's nomenclature between an old and a modern term, we have\r\nleaned toward age, if it be a term generally understood. But except\r\nwhere the subject described has itself become obsolete, we have revived\r\nno obsolete terms. In substantiation of this view, we append a few\r\nexamples of terms which served the English miner well for centuries,\r\nsome of which are still extant in some local communities, yet we believe\r\nthey would carry as little meaning to the average reader as would the\r\nreproduction of the Latin terms coined by Agricola.\r\n\r\n  Rake     = A perpendicular vein.\r\n  Woughs   = Walls of the vein.\r\n  Shakes   = Cracks in the walls.\r\n  Flookan  = Gouge.\r\n  Bryle    = Outcrop.\r\n  Hade     = Incline or underlay of the vein.\r\n  Dawling  = Impoverishment of the vein.\r\n  Rither   = A \"horse\" in a vein.\r\n  Twitches = \"Pinching\" of a vein.\r\n  Slough   = Drainage tunnel.\r\n  Sole     = Lowest drift.\r\n  Stool    = Face of a drift or stope.\r\n  Winds }\r\n  Turn  }  = Winze.\r\n  Dippas}\r\n  Grove    = Shaft.\r\n  Dutins   = Set of timber.\r\n  Stemple  = Post or stull.\r\n  Laths    = Lagging.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the author's coinage and adaptations of terms in this\r\nbook we may cite:--\r\n\r\n  _Fossa latens_                = Drift.\r\n  _Fossa latens transversa_     = Crosscut.\r\n  _Tectum_                      = Hangingwall.\r\n  _Fundamentum_                 = Footwall.\r\n  _Tigna per intervalla posita_ = Wall plate.\r\n  _Arbores dissectae_           = Lagging.\r\n  _Formae_                      = Hitches.\r\n\r\nWe have adopted the term \"tunnel\" for openings by way of outlet to the\r\nmine. The word in this narrow sense is as old as \"adit,\" a term less\r\nexpressive and not so generally used in the English-speaking mining\r\nworld. We have for the same reason adopted the word \"drift\" instead of\r\nthe term \"level\" so generally used in America, because that term always\r\nleads to confusion in discussion of mine surveys. We may mention,\r\nhowever, that the term \"level\" is a heritage from the Derbyshire mines,\r\nand is of an equally respectable age as \"drift.\"\r\n\r\n[2] See note on p. 46-47. The _canales_, as here used, were the openings\r\nin the earth, in which minerals were deposited.\r\n\r\n[3] This statement, as will appear by the description later on, refers\r\nto the depth of winzes or to the distance between drifts, that is \"the\r\nlift.\" We have not, however, been justified in using the term \"winze,\"\r\nbecause some of these were openings to the surface. As showing the\r\nconsiderable depth of shafts in Agricola's time, we may quote the\r\nfollowing from _Bermannus_ (p. 442): \"The depths of our shafts forced us\r\nto invent hauling machines suitable for them. There are some of them\r\nlarger and more ingenious than this one, for use in deep shafts, as, for\r\ninstance, those in my native town of Geyer, but more especially at\r\nSchneeberg, where the shaft of the mine from which so much treasure was\r\ntaken in our memory has reached the depth of about 200 fathoms (feet?),\r\nwherefore the necessity of this kind of machinery. _Naevius_: What an\r\nenormous depth! Have you reached the Inferno? _Bermannus_: Oh, at\r\nKuttenberg there are shafts more than 500 fathoms (feet?) deep.\r\n_Naevius_: And not yet reached the Kingdom of Pluto?\" It is impossible\r\nto accept these as fathoms, as this would in the last case represent\r\n3,000 feet vertically. The expression used, however, for fathoms is\r\n_passus_, presumably the Roman measure equal to 58.1 inches.\r\n\r\n[4] _Cavernos_. The Glossary gives _drusen_, our word _drusy_ having had\r\nthis origin.\r\n\r\n[5] _Purum_,--\"pure.\" _Interpretatio_ gives the German as\r\n_gedigen_,--\"native.\"\r\n\r\n[6] _Rudis_,--\"Crude.\" By this expression the author really means ores\r\nvery rich in any designated metal. In many cases it serves to indicate\r\nthe minerals of a given metal, as distinguished from the metal itself.\r\nOur system of mineralogy obviously does not afford an acceptable\r\nequivalent. Agricola (_De Nat. Foss._, p. 360) says: \"I find it\r\nnecessary to call each genus (of the metallic minerals) by the name of\r\nits own metal, and to this I add a word which differentiates it from the\r\npure (_puro_) metal, whether the latter has been mined or smelted; so I\r\nspeak of _rudis_ gold, silver, quicksilver, copper, tin, bismuth, lead,\r\nor iron. This is not because I am unaware that Varro called silver\r\n_rudis_ which had not yet been refined and stamped, but because a word\r\nwhich will distinguish the one from the other is not to be found.\"\r\n\r\n[7] The reasons for retaining the Latin weights are given in the\r\nAppendix on Weights and Measures. A _centumpondium_ weighs 70.6 lbs.\r\navoirdupois, an _uncia_ 412.2 Troy grains, therefore, this value is\r\nequal to 72 ounces 18 pennyweights per short ton.\r\n\r\n[8] Agricola mentions many minerals in _De Re Metallica_, but without\r\nsuch description as would make possible a hazard at their identity. From\r\nhis _De Natura Fossilium_, however, and from other mineralogies of the\r\n16th Century, some can be fully identified and others surmised. While we\r\nconsider it desirable to set out the probable composition of these\r\nminerals, on account of the space required, the reasons upon which our\r\nopinion has been based cannot be given in detail, as that would require\r\nextensive quotations. In a general way, we have throughout the text\r\nstudiously evaded the use of modern mineralogical terms--unless the term\r\nused to-day is of Agricola's age--and have adopted either old English\r\nterms of pre-chemistry times or more loose terms used by common miners.\r\nObviously modern mineralogic terms imply a precision of knowledge not\r\nexisting at that period. It must not be assumed that the following is by\r\nany means a complete list of the minerals described by Agricola, but\r\nthey include most of those referred to in this chapter. His system of\r\nmineralogy we have set out in note 4, p. 1, and it requires no further\r\ncomment here. The grouping given below is simply for convenience and\r\ndoes not follow Agricola's method. Where possible, we tabulate in\r\ncolumns the Latin term used in _De Re Metallica_; the German equivalent\r\ngiven by the Author in either the _Interpretatio_ or the Glossary; our\r\nview of the probable modern equivalent based on investigation of his\r\nother works and other ancient mineralogies, and lastly the terms we have\r\nadopted in the text. The German spelling is that given in the original.\r\nAs an indication of Agricola's position as a mineralogist, we mark with\r\nan asterisk the minerals which were first specifically described by him.\r\nWe also give some notes on matters of importance bearing on the\r\nnomenclature used in _De Re Metallica_. Historical notes on the chief\r\nmetals will be found elsewhere, generally with the discussion of\r\nsmelting methods. We should not omit to express our indebtedness to\r\nDana's great \"System of Mineralogy,\" in the matter of correlation of\r\nmany old and modern minerals.\r\n\r\nGOLD MINERALS. Agricola apparently believed that there were various gold\r\nminerals, green, yellow, purple, black, etc. There is nothing, however,\r\nin his works that permits of any attempt to identify them, and his\r\nclassification seems to rest on gangue colours.\r\n\r\nSILVER MINERALS.\r\n\r\n  _Argentum purum in  _Gedigen silber_        --            *Native silver\r\n    venis reperitur_\r\n\r\n  _Argentum rude_     _Gedigen silber         --            _Rudis_ silver, or\r\n                        ertz_                                 pure silver\r\n                                                              minerals\r\n\r\n  _Argentum rude      _Glas ertz_        Argentite          *Silver glance\r\n    plumbei coloris_                      (Ag_{2}S)\r\n\r\n  _Argentum rude      _Rot gold ertz_    Pyrargyrite        *Red silver\r\n    rubrum_                               (Ag_{3}SbS_{3})\r\n\r\n  _Argentum rude      _Durchsichtig      Proustite          *Ruby silver\r\n    rubrum              rod gulden        (Ag_{3}AsS_{3})\r\n    translucidum_       ertz_\r\n\r\n  _Argentum rude      _Weis rod gulden        --            White silver\r\n    album_              ertz: Dan es\r\n                        ist frisch wie\r\n                        offtmals rod\r\n                        gulden ertz\r\n                        pfleget zusein_\r\n\r\n  _Argentum rude      _Gedigen           Part Bromyrite     Liver-coloured\r\n    jecoris             leberfarbig        (Ag Br)           silver\r\n    colore_             ertz_\r\n\r\n  _Argentum rude      _Gedigen               --             Yellow silver\r\n    luteum_             geelertz_\r\n\r\n  _Argentum rude      _Gedigen graw    }                  { *Grey silver\r\n    cineraceum_         ertz_          } Part Cerargurite {\r\n                                       } (Ag Cl) (Horn    {\r\n  _Argentum rude      _Gedigen         } Silver) Part     { *Black silver\r\n    nigrum_            schwartz ertz_  } Stephanite       {\r\n                                       } (Ag_{5}SbS_{4})  {\r\n  _Argentum rude      _Gedigen braun   }                  { *Purple silver\r\n    purpureum_          ertz_          }                  {\r\n\r\nThe last six may be in part also alteration products from all silver\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for indefiniteness in determination usually lie in the\r\nfailure of ancient authors to give sufficient or characteristic\r\ndescriptions. In many cases Agricola is sufficiently definite as to\r\nassure certainty, as the following description of what we consider to be\r\nsilver glance, from _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 360), will indicate:\r\n\"Lead-coloured _rudis_ silver is called by the Germans from the word\r\nglass (_glasertz_), not from lead. Indeed, it has the colour of the\r\nlatter or of galena (_plumbago_), but not of glass, nor is it\r\ntransparent like glass, which one might indeed expect had the name been\r\ncorrectly derived. This mineral is occasionally so like galena in\r\ncolour, although it is darker, that one who is not experienced in\r\nminerals is unable to distinguish between the two at sight, but in\r\nsubstance they differ greatly from one another. Nature has made this\r\nkind of silver out of a little earth and much silver. Whereas galena\r\nconsists of stone and lead containing some silver. But the distinction\r\nbetween them can be easily determined, for galena may be ground to\r\npowder in a mortar with a pestle, but this treatment flattens out this\r\nkind of _rudis_ silver. Also galena, when struck by a mallet or bitten\r\nor hacked with a knife, splits and breaks to pieces; whereas this silver\r\nis malleable under the hammer, may be dented by the teeth, and cut with\r\na knife.\"\r\n\r\nCOPPER MINERALS.\r\n\r\n  _Aes purum          _Gedigen kupfer_   Native copper      Native copper\r\n    fossile_\r\n\r\n  _Aes rude           _Kupferglas ertz_  Chalcocite         *Copper glance\r\n    plumbei                               (Cu_{2}S)\r\n    coloris_\r\n\r\n  _Chalcitis_         _Rodt atrament_    A decomposed       _Chalcitis_ (see\r\n                                           copper or          notes on p. 573)\r\n                                           iron sulphide\r\n\r\n  _Pyrites aurei    } _Geelkis oder    { Part chalcopyrite  Copper pyrites\r\n    colore_         }   kupferkis_     {  (Cu Fe S) part\r\n                    }                  {  bornite\r\n  _Pyrites aerosus_ }                  {  (Cu_{3}FeS_{3})\r\n\r\n  _Caeruleum_         _Berglasur_        Azurite            Azure\r\n\r\n  _Chrysocolla_       _Berggruen und    { Part chrysocolla   Chrysocolla (see\r\n                        schifergruen_   { Part Malachite      note 7, p. 560)\r\n\r\n  _Molochites_        _Molochit_         Malachite          Malachite\r\n\r\n  _Lapis aerarius_    _Kupfer ertz_          --             Copper ore\r\n\r\n  _Aes caldarium    } _Lebeter kupfer_  { When used for\r\n    rubrum fuscum_  }                   {   an ore, is      *Ruby copper ore\r\n         or         }                   {   probably\r\n  _Aes sui coloris_ } _Rotkupfer_       {   cuprite\r\n\r\n  _Aes nigrum_        _Schwartz kupfer_  Probably CuO from  *Black copper\r\n                                           oxidation of\r\n                                           other minerals\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above the Author uses the following, which were in\r\nthe main artificial products:\r\n\r\n  _Aerugo_            _Gruenspan oder     Verdigris          Verdigris\r\n                        Spanschgruen_\r\n\r\n  _Aes luteum_        _Gelfarkupfer_   } Impure blister   { Unrefined copper\r\n                                       }   copper         {  (see note 16,\r\n                                       }                  {  p. 511)\r\n  _Aes caldarium_     _Lebeterkupfer_  }                  {\r\n\r\n  _Aeris flos_        _Kupferbraun_    } Cupric oxide     { Copper flower\r\n                                       }   scales         {\r\n                                       }                  {\r\n  _Aeris squama_      _Kupferhammer-   }                  { Copper scale (see\r\n                        schlag_        }                  {   note 9, p. 233)\r\n\r\n  _Atramentum         _Blaw kupfer       Chalcanthite       Native blue\r\n    sutorium            wasser_                               vitriol (see\r\n    caeruleum_ or                                             note on p. 572)\r\n    _chalcanthum_\r\n\r\nBlue and green copper minerals were distinguished by all the ancient\r\nmineralogists. Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny, etc., all give\r\nsufficient detail to identify their _cyanus_ and _caeruleum_ partly with\r\nmodern azurite, and their _chrysocolla_ partly with the modern mineral\r\nof the same name. However, these terms were also used for vegetable\r\npigments, as well as for the pigments made from the minerals. The Greek\r\norigin of _chrysocolla_ (_chrysos_, gold and _kolla_, solder) may be\r\nblamed with another and distinct line of confusion, in that this term\r\nhas been applied to soldering materials, from Greek down to modern\r\ntimes, some of the ancient mineralogists even asserting that the copper\r\nmineral _chrysocolla_ was used for this purpose. Agricola uses\r\n_chrysocolla_ for borax, but is careful to state in every case (see note\r\nxx., p. x): \"_Chrysocolla_ made from _nitrum_,\" or \"_Chrysocolla_ which\r\nthe Moors call Borax.\" Dioscorides and Pliny mention substances which\r\nwere evidently copper sulphides, but no description occurs prior to\r\nAgricola that permits a hazard as to different species.\r\n\r\nLEAD MINERALS.\r\n\r\n  _Plumbarius lapis_  _Glantz_           Galena             Galena\r\n\r\n  _Galena_            _Glantz und        Galena             Galena\r\n                        pleiertz_\r\n\r\n  _Plumbum nigrum   } _Pleiertz oder     Cerussite          Yellow lead ore\r\n    lutei coloris_  }   pleischweis_       (PbCO_{3})\r\n                    }\r\n  _Plumbago         }\r\n    metallica_      }\r\n\r\n  _Cerussa_           _Pleiweis_         Artificial         White-lead (see\r\n                                           White-lead         note 4, p. 440)\r\n\r\n  _Ochra facticia_    _Pleigeel_         Massicot (Pb O)    *Lead-ochre (see\r\n    or _ochra                                                 note 8, p. 232)\r\n    plumbaria_\r\n\r\n  _Molybdaena_      } _Herdplei_         Part litharge      Hearth-lead (see\r\n                    }                                         note 37, p. 476)\r\n  _Plumbago         }\r\n    fornacis_       }\r\n\r\n  _Spuma argenti_   } _Glett_            Litharge           Litharge (see note\r\n                    }                                         on p. 465)\r\n  _Lithargyrum_     }\r\n\r\n  _Minium             _Menning_          Minium             Red-lead (see note\r\n    secundarium_                          (Pb_{3}O_{4})       7, p. 232)\r\n\r\nSo far as we can determine, all of these except the first three were\r\nbelieved by Agricola to be artificial products. Of the first three,\r\ngalena is certain enough, but while he obviously was familiar with the\r\nalteration lead products, his descriptions are inadequate and much\r\nconfused with the artificial oxides. Great confusion arises in the\r\nancient mineralogies over the terms _molybdaena_, _plumbago_, _plumbum_,\r\n_galena_, and _spuma argenti_, all of which, from Roman mineralogists\r\ndown to a century after Agricola, were used for lead in some form.\r\nFurther discussion of such confusion will be found in note 37, p. 476.\r\nAgricola in _Bermannus_ and _De Natura Fossilium_, devotes pages to\r\nendeavouring to reconcile the ancient usages of these terms, and all the\r\nconfusion existing in Agricola's time was thrice confounded when the\r\nnames _molybdaena_ and _plumbago_ were assigned to non-lead minerals.\r\n\r\nTIN. Agricola knew only one tin mineral: _Lapilli nigri ex quibus\r\nconflatur plumbum candidum_, _i.e._, \"Little black stones from which tin\r\nis smelted,\" and he gives the German equivalent as _zwitter_,\r\n\"tin-stone.\" He describes them as being of different colours, but\r\nprobably due to external causes.\r\n\r\nANTIMONY. (_Interpretatio_,--_spiesglas_.) The _stibi_ or _stibium_ of\r\nAgricola was no doubt the sulphide, and he follows Dioscorides in\r\ndividing it into male and female species. This distinction, however, is\r\nimpossible to apply from the inadequate descriptions given. The mineral\r\nand metal known to Agricola and his predecessors was almost always the\r\nsulphide, and we have not felt justified in using the term antimony\r\nalone, as that implies the refined product, therefore, we have adopted\r\neither the Latin term or the old English term \"grey antimony.\" The\r\nsmelted antimony of commerce sold under the latter term was the\r\nsulphide. For further notes see p. 428.\r\n\r\nBISMUTH*. _Plumbum cinereum_ (_Interpretatio_,--_bismut_). Agricola\r\nstates that this mineral occasionally occurs native, \"but more often as\r\na mineral of another colour\" (_De Nat. Fos._, p. 337), and he also\r\ndescribes its commonest form as black or grey. This, considering his\r\nlocalities, would indicate the sulphide, although he assigns no special\r\nname to it. Although bismuth is mentioned before Agricola in the\r\n_Nuetzliche Bergbuechlin_, he was the first to describe it (see p. 433).\r\n\r\nQUICKSILVER. Apart from native quicksilver, Agricola adequately\r\ndescribes cinnabar only. The term used by him for the mineral is _minium\r\nnativum_ (_Interpretatio_,--_bergzinober_ or _cinnabaris_). He makes the\r\ncurious statement _(De Nat. Fos._ p. 335) that _rudis_ quicksilver also\r\noccurs liver-coloured and blackish,--probably gangue colours. (See p.\r\n432).\r\n\r\nARSENICAL MINERALS. Metallic arsenic was unknown, although it has been\r\nmaintained that a substance mentioned by Albertus Magnus (_De Rebus\r\nMetallicis_) was the metallic form. Agricola, who was familiar with all\r\nAlbertus's writings, makes no mention of it, and it appears to us that\r\nthe statement of Albertus referred only to the oxide from sublimation.\r\nOur word \"arsenic\" obviously takes root in the Greek for orpiment, which\r\nwas also used by Pliny (XXXIV, 56) as _arrhenicum_, and later was\r\nmodified to _arsenicum_ by the Alchemists, who applied it to the oxide.\r\nAgricola gives the following in _Bermannus_ (p. 448), who has been\r\npreviously discussing realgar and orpiment:--\"_Ancon_: Avicenna also has\r\na white variety. _Bermannus_: I cannot at all believe in a mineral of a\r\nwhite colour; perhaps he was thinking of an artificial product; there\r\nare two which the Alchemists make, one yellow and the other white, and\r\nthey are accounted the most powerful poisons to-day, and are called only\r\nby the name _arsenicum_.\" In _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 219) is described\r\nthe making of \"the white variety\" by sublimating orpiment, and also it\r\nis noted that realgar can be made from orpiment by heating the latter\r\nfor five hours in a sealed crucible. In _De Re Metallica_ (Book X.), he\r\nrefers to _auripigmentum facticum_, and no doubt means the realgar made\r\nfrom orpiment. The four minerals of arsenic base mentioned by Agricola\r\nwere:--\r\n\r\n  _Auripigmentum_     _Operment_         Orpiment           Orpiment\r\n                                          (As_{2}S_{3})\r\n\r\n  _Sandaraca_         _Rosgeel_          Realgar (As S)     Realgar\r\n\r\n  _Arsenicum_         _Arsenik_          Artificial         White arsenic\r\n                                           arsenical oxide\r\n\r\n  _Lapis subrutilus   _Mistpuckel_       Arsenopyrite       *Mispickel\r\n     atque ...                             (Fe As S)\r\n     splendens_\r\n\r\nWe are somewhat uncertain as to the identification of the last. The\r\nyellow and red sulphides, however, were well known to the Ancients, and\r\nare described by Aristotle, Theophrastus (71 and 89), Dioscorides (V,\r\n81), Pliny (XXXIII, 22, etc.); and Strabo (XII, 3, 40) mentions a mine\r\nof them near Pompeiopolis, where, because of its poisonous character\r\nnone but slaves were employed. The Ancients believed that the yellow\r\nsulphide contained gold--hence the name _auripigmentum_, and Pliny\r\ndescribes the attempt of the Emperor Caligula to extract the gold from\r\nit, and states that he did obtain a small amount, but unprofitably. So\r\nlate a mineralogist as Hill (1750) held this view, which seemed to be\r\ngeneral. Both realgar and orpiment were important for pigments,\r\nmedicinal purposes, and poisons among the Ancients. In addition to the\r\nabove, some arsenic-cobalt minerals are included under _cadmia_.\r\n\r\nIRON MINERALS.\r\n\r\n  _Ferrum purum_      _Gedigen eisen_    Native iron        *Native iron\r\n\r\n  _Terra ferria_      _Eisen ertz_     } Various soft and } Ironstone\r\n                                       }   hard iron      }\r\n  _Ferri vena_        _Eisen ertz_     }   ores, probably }\r\n                                       }   mostly hematite}\r\n  _Galenae genus      _Eisen glantz_   }                  }\r\n    tertium omnis                      }                  }\r\n    metalli                            }                  }\r\n    inanissimi_                        }                  }\r\n                                       }                  }\r\n  _Schistos_          _Glaskoepfe oder  }                  }\r\n                        bluetstein_     }                  }\r\n                                       }                  }\r\n  _Ferri vena         _Leber ertz_     }                  }\r\n    jecoris colore_                    }                  }\r\n\r\n  _Ferrugo_           _Ruest_             Part limonite      Iron rust\r\n\r\n  _Magnes_            _Siegelstein       Magnetite          Lodestone\r\n                        oder magnet_\r\n\r\n  _Ochra nativa_      _Berg geel_        Limonite           Yellow ochre or\r\n                                                              ironstone\r\n\r\n  _Haematites_        _Bluet stein_    { Part hematite       Bloodstone or\r\n                                      { Part jasper           ironstone\r\n\r\n  _Schistos_          _Glas koepfe_       Part limonite      Ironstone\r\n\r\n  _Pyrites_           _Kis_              Pyrites            Pyrites\r\n\r\n  _Pyrites argenti    _wasser oder       Marcasite          *White iron\r\n    coloris_            weisser kis_                          pyrites\r\n\r\n  _Misy_              _Gel atrament_     Part copiapite     _Misy_ (see note\r\n                                                              on p. 573)\r\n\r\n  _Sory_              _Graw und          Partly a           _Sory_ (see note\r\n                        schwartz           decomposed iron    on p. 573)\r\n                        atrament_          pyrite\r\n\r\n  _Melanteria_        _Schwartz und     Melanterite         _Melanteria_ (see\r\n                        grau atrament_    (native vitriol)    note on p. 573)\r\n\r\nThe classification of iron ores on the basis of exterior\r\ncharacteristics, chiefly hardness and brilliancy, does not justify a\r\nmore narrow rendering than \"ironstone.\" Agricola (_De Nat. Fos._, Book\r\nV.) gives elaborate descriptions of various iron ores, but the\r\ndescriptions under any special name would cover many actual minerals.\r\nThe subject of pyrites is a most confused one; the term originates from\r\nthe Greek word for fire, and referred in Greek and Roman times to almost\r\nany stone that would strike sparks. By Agricola it was a generic term in\r\nsomewhat the same sense that it is still used in mineralogy, as, for\r\ninstance, iron pyrite, copper pyrite, etc. So much was this the case\r\nlater on, that Henckel, the leading mineralogist of the 18th Century,\r\nentitled his large volume _Pyritologia_, and in it embraces practically\r\nall the sulphide minerals then known. The term _marcasite_, of mediaeval\r\nArabic origin, seems to have had some vogue prior and subsequent to\r\nAgricola. He, however, puts it on one side as merely a synonym for\r\npyrite, nor can it be satisfactorily defined in much better terms.\r\nAgricola apparently did not recognise the iron base of pyrites, for he\r\nsays (_De Nat. Fos._, p. 366): \"Sometimes, however, pyrites do not\r\ncontain any gold, silver, copper, or lead, and yet it is not a pure\r\nstone, but a compound, and consists of stone and a substance which is\r\nsomewhat metallic, which is a species of its own.\" Many varieties were\r\nknown to him and described, partly by their other metal association, but\r\nchiefly by their colour.\r\n\r\nCADMIA. The minerals embraced under this term by the old mineralogists\r\nform one of the most difficult chapters in the history of mineralogy.\r\nThese complexities reached their height with Agricola, for at this time\r\nvarious new minerals classed under this heading had come under debate.\r\nAll these minerals were later found to be forms of zinc, cobalt, or\r\narsenic, and some of these minerals were in use long prior to Agricola.\r\nFrom Greek and Roman times down to long after Agricola, brass was made\r\nby cementing zinc ore with copper. Aristotle and Strabo mention an earth\r\nused to colour copper, but give no details. It is difficult to say what\r\nzinc mineral the _cadmium_ of Dioscorides (V, 46) and Pliny (XXXIV, 2),\r\nreally was. It was possibly only furnace calamine, or perhaps blende for\r\nit was associated with copper. They amply describe _cadmia_ produced in\r\ncopper furnaces, and _pompholyx_ (zinc oxide). It was apparently not\r\nuntil Theophilus (1150) that the term _calamina_ appears for that\r\nmineral. Precisely when the term \"zinc,\" and a knowledge of the metal,\r\nfirst appeared in Europe is a matter of some doubt; it has been\r\nattributed to Paracelsus, a contemporary of Agricola (see note on p.\r\n409), but we do not believe that author's work in question was printed\r\nuntil long after. The quotations from Agricola given below, in which\r\n_zincum_ is mentioned in an obscure way, do not appear in the first\r\neditions of these works, but only in the revised edition of 1559. In\r\nother words, Agricola himself only learned of a substance under this\r\nname a short period before his death in 1555. The metal was imported\r\ninto Europe from China prior to this time. He however does describe\r\nactual metallic zinc under the term _conterfei_, and mentions its\r\noccurrence in the cracks of furnace walls. (See also notes on p. 409).\r\n\r\nThe word cobalt (German _kobelt_) is from the Greek word _cobalos_,\r\n\"mime,\" and its German form was the term for gnomes and goblins. It\r\nappears that the German miners, finding a material (Agricola's\r\n\"corrosive material\") which injured their hands and feet, connected it\r\nwith the goblins, or used the term as an epithet, and finally it became\r\nestablished for certain minerals (see note 21, p. 214, on this subject).\r\nThe first written appearance of the term in connection with minerals,\r\nappears in Agricola's _Bermannus_ (1530). The first practical use of\r\ncobalt was in the form of _zaffre_ or cobalt blue. There seems to be no\r\nmention of the substance by the Greek or Roman writers, although\r\nanalyses of old colourings show some traces of cobalt, but whether\r\naccidental or not is undetermined. The first mention we know of, was by\r\nBiringuccio in 1540 (_De La Pirotechnia_, Book II, Chap. IX.), who did\r\nnot connect it with the minerals then called _cobalt_ or _cadmia_.\r\n\"_Zaffera_ is another mineral substance, like a metal of middle weight,\r\nwhich will not melt alone, but accompanied by vitreous substances it\r\nmelts into an azure colour so that those who colour glass, or paint\r\nvases or glazed earthenware, make use of it. Not only does it serve for\r\nthe above-mentioned operations, but if one uses too great a quantity of\r\nit, it will be black and all other colours, according to the quantity\r\nused.\" Agricola, although he does not use the word _zaffre_, does refer\r\nto a substance of this kind, and in any event also missed the relation\r\nbetween _zaffre_ and cobalt, as he seems to think (_De Nat. Fos._, p.\r\n347) that _zaffre_ came from bismuth, a belief that existed until long\r\nafter his time. The cobalt of the Erzgebirge was of course, intimately\r\nassociated with this mineral. He says, \"the slag of bismuth, mixed\r\ntogether with metalliferous substances, which when melted make a kind of\r\nglass, will tint glass and earthenware vessels blue.\" _Zaffre_ is the\r\nroasted mineral ground with sand, while _smalt_, a term used more\r\nfrequently, is the fused mixture with sand.\r\n\r\nThe following are the substances mentioned by Agricola, which, we\r\nbelieve, relate to cobalt and zinc minerals, some of them arsenical\r\ncompounds. Other arsenical minerals we give above.\r\n\r\n  _Cadmia fossilis_   _Calmei_; _lapis   Calamine           Calamine\r\n                        calaminaris_\r\n\r\n  _Cadmia metallica_  _Kobelt_           Part cobalt        *_Cadmia\r\n                                                              metallica_\r\n\r\n  _Cadmia fornacis_   _Mitlere und       Furnace            Furnace accretions\r\n                        obere              accretions or\r\n                        offenbrueche_       furnace calamine\r\n\r\n  _Bituminosa         _Kobelt des        (Mannsfeld copper  _Bituminosa cadmia_\r\n    cadmia_             bergwacht_         schists)           (see note 4,\r\n                                                              p. 273)\r\n\r\n  _Galena inanis_     _Blende_           Sphalerite*        *Blende\r\n                                           (Zn S)\r\n\r\n  _Cobaltum               --             Smallite*        } _Cadmia metallica_\r\n    cineraceum_                            (CoAs_{2})     }\r\n                                                          }\r\n  _Cobaltum nigrum_       --             Abolite*         }\r\n                                                          }\r\n  _Cobaltum ferri         --             Cobaltite        }\r\n    colore_                                 (CoAsS)       }\r\n\r\n  _Zincum_            _Zinck_            Zinc               Zinc\r\n\r\n  _Liquor Candidus    _Conterfei_        Zinc               See note 48, p. 408\r\n    ex fornace ...\r\n    etc._\r\n\r\n  _Atramentum             --             Goslarite          *Native white\r\n    sutorium,                              (Zn SO_{4})        vitriol\r\n    candidum, potissimum\r\n    reperitur Goselariae_\r\n\r\n  _Spodos             _Geeler zechen   } Either natural   { Grey _spodos_\r\n    subterranea         rauch_         }   or artificial  {\r\n    cinerea_                           }   zinc oxides,   {\r\n                                       }   no doubt       {\r\n  _Spodos             _Schwartzer      }   containing     { Black _spodos_\r\n    subterranea         zechen rauch,  }   arsenical      {\r\n    nigra_              auff dem       }   oxides         {\r\n                        Altenberge     }                  {\r\n                        nennet man in  }                  {\r\n                        kis_           }                  {\r\n                                       }                  {\r\n  _Spodos             _Grauer zechen   }                  { Green _spodos_\r\n    subterranea         rauch_         }                  {\r\n    viridis_                           }                  {\r\n                                       }                  {\r\n  _Pompholyx_         _Huettenrauch_    }                  { _Pompholyx_ (see\r\n                                       }                  {   note 26, p. 394)\r\n\r\nAs seen from the following quotations from Agricola, on _cadmia_ and\r\ncobalt, there was infinite confusion as to the zinc, cobalt, and arsenic\r\nminerals; nor do we think any good purpose is served by adding to the\r\nalready lengthy discussion of these passages, the obscurity of which is\r\nnatural to the state of knowledge; but we reproduce them as giving a\r\nfairly clear idea of the amount of confusion then existing. It is,\r\nhowever, desirable to bear in mind that the mines familiar to Agricola\r\nabounded in complex mixtures of cobalt, nickel, arsenic, bismuth, zinc,\r\nand antimony. Agricola frequently mentions the garlic odour from _cadmia\r\nmetallica_, which, together with the corrosive qualities mentioned\r\nbelow, would obviously be due to arsenic. _Bermannus_ (p. 459). \"This\r\nkind of pyrites miners call _cobaltum_, if it be allowed to me to use\r\nour German name. The Greeks call it _cadmia_. The juices, however, out\r\nof which pyrites and silver are formed, appear to solidify into one\r\nbody, and thus is produced what they call _cobaltum_. There are some who\r\nconsider this the same as pyrites, because it is almost the same. There\r\nare some who distinguish it as a species, which pleases me, for it has\r\nthe distinctive property of being extremely corrosive, so that it\r\nconsumes the hands and feet of the workmen, unless they are well\r\nprotected, which I do not believe that pyrites can do. Three kinds are\r\nfound, and distinguished more by the colour than by other properties;\r\nthey are black (abolite?), grey (smallite?), and iron colour (cobalt\r\nglance?). Moreover, it contains more silver than does pyrites....\"\r\n_Bermannus_ (p. 431). \"It (a sort of pyrites) is so like the colour of\r\ngalena that not without cause might anybody have doubt in deciding\r\nwhether it be pyrites or galena.... Perhaps this kind is neither pyrites\r\nnor galena, but has a genus of its own. For it has not the colour of\r\npyrites, nor the hardness. It is almost the colour of galena, but of\r\nentirely different components. From it there is made gold and silver,\r\nand a great quantity is dug out from Reichenstein which is in Silesia,\r\nas was lately reported to me. Much more is found at Raurici, which they\r\ncall _zincum_; which species differs from pyrites, for the latter\r\ncontains more silver than gold, the former only gold, or hardly any\r\nsilver.\"\r\n\r\n(_De Natura Fossilium_, p. 170). \"_Cadmia fossilis_ has an odour like\r\ngarlic\" ... (p. 367). \"We now proceed with _cadmia_, not the _cadmia\r\nfornacis_ (furnace accretions) of which I spoke in the last book, nor\r\nthe _cadmia fossilis_ (calamine) devoid of metal, which is used to\r\ncolour copper, whose nature I explained in Book V, but the metallic\r\nmineral (_fossilis metallica_), which Pliny states to be an ore from\r\nwhich copper is made. The Ancients have left no record that another\r\nmetal could be smelted from it. Yet it is a fact that not only copper\r\nbut also silver may be smelted from it, and indeed occasionally both\r\ncopper and silver together. Sometimes, as is the case with pyrites, it\r\nis entirely devoid of metal. It is frequently found in copper mines, but\r\nmore frequently still in silver mines. And there are likewise veins of\r\n_cadmia_ itself.... There are several species of the _cadmia fossilis_\r\njust as there were of _cadmia fornacum_. For one kind has the form of\r\ngrapes and another of broken tiles, a third seems to consist of layers.\r\nBut the _cadmia fossilis_ has much stronger properties than that which\r\nis produced in the furnaces. Indeed, it often possesses such highly\r\ncorrosive power that it corrodes the hands and feet of the miners. It,\r\ntherefore, differs from pyrites in colour and properties. For pyrites,\r\nif it does not contain vitriol, is generally either of a gold or silver\r\ncolour, rarely of any other. _Cadmia_ is either black or brown or grey,\r\nor else reddish like copper when melted in the furnace.... For this\r\n_cadmia_ is put in a suitable vessel, in the same way as quicksilver, so\r\nthat the heat of the fire will cause it to sublimate, and from it is\r\nmade a black or brown or grey body which the Alchemists call 'sublimated\r\n_cadmia_' (_cadmiam sublimatam_). This possesses corrosive properties of\r\nthe highest degree. Cognate with _cadmia_ and pyrites is a compound\r\nwhich the Noricians and Rhetians call _zincum_. This contains gold and\r\nsilver, and is either red or white. It is likewise found in the Sudetian\r\nmountains, and is devoid of those metals.... With this _cadmia_ is\r\nnaturally related mineral _spodos_, known to the Moor Serapion, but\r\nunknown to the Greeks; and also _pompholyx_--for both are produced by\r\nfire where the miners, breaking the hard rocks in drifts, tunnels, and\r\nshafts, burn the _cadmia_ or pyrites or galena or other similar\r\nminerals. From _cadmia_ is made black, brown, and grey _spodos_; from\r\npyrites, white _pompholyx_ and _spodos_; from galena is made yellow or\r\ngrey _spodos_. But _pompholyx_ produced from copper stone (_lapide\r\naeroso_) after some time becomes green. The black _spodos_, similar to\r\nsoot, is found at Altenberg in Meissen. The white _pompholyx_, like wool\r\nwhich floats in the air in summer, is found in Hildesheim in the seams\r\nin the rocks of almost all quarries except in the sandstone. But the\r\ngrey and the brown and the yellow _pompholyx_ are found in those silver\r\nmines where the miners break up the rocks by fire. All consist of very\r\nfine particles which are very light, but the lightest of all is white\r\n_pompholyx_.\"\r\n\r\nQUARTZ MINERALS.\r\n\r\n  _Quarzum_ (\"which   _Quertz oder       Quartz             Quartz (see note\r\n    Latins call         kiselstein_                           15, p. 380)\r\n    _silex_\")\r\n\r\n  _Silex_             _Hornstein oder    Flinty or jaspery  Hornstone\r\n                        feurstein_         quartz\r\n\r\n  _Crystallum_        _Crystal_          Clear crystals     Crystal\r\n\r\n  _Achates_           _Achat_            Agate              Agate\r\n\r\n  _Sarda_             _Carneol_          Carnelian          Carnelian\r\n\r\n  _Jaspis_            _Jaspis_           Part coloured      _Jaspis_\r\n                                           quartz, part\r\n                                           jade\r\n\r\n  _Murrhina_          _Chalcedonius_     Chalcedony         Chalcedony\r\n\r\n  _Coticula_          _Goldstein_        A black silicious  Touchstone (see\r\n                                           stone              note 37, p. 252)\r\n\r\n  _Amethystus_        _Amethyst_         Amethyst           Amethyst\r\n\r\nLIME MINERALS.\r\n\r\n  _Lapis            } _Gips_             Gypsum             Gypsum\r\n    specularis_     }\r\n                    }\r\n  _Gypsum_          }\r\n\r\n  _Marmor_            _Marmelstein_      Marble             Marble\r\n\r\n  _Marmor             _Alabaster_        Alabaster          Alabaster\r\n    alabastrites_\r\n\r\n  _Marmor glarea_         --             Calcite (?)

(_Magnes_; _Interpretatio_ gives _Siegelstein oder magnet_).\r\nThe lodestone was well-known to the Ancients under various\r\nnames--_magnes_, _magnetis_, _heraclion_, and _sideritis_. A review of\r\nthe ancient opinions as to its miraculous properties would require more\r\nspace than can be afforded. It is mentioned by many Greek writers,\r\nincluding Hippocrates (460-372 B.C.) and Aristotle; while Theophrastus\r\n(53), Dioscorides (V, 105), and Pliny (XXXIV, 42, XXXVI, 25) describe it\r\nat length. The Ancients also maintained the existence of a stone,\r\n_theamedes_, having repellant properties, and the two were supposed to\r\nexist at times in the same stone.\r\n\r\nEMERY. (_Smiris_; _Interpretatio_ gives _smirgel_). Agricola (_De Natura\r\nFossilium_, p. 265) says: \"The ring-makers polish and clean their hard\r\ngems with _smiris_. The glaziers use it to cut their glass into sheets.\r\nIt is found in the silver mines of Annaberg in Meissen and elsewhere.\"\r\nStones used for polishing gems are noted by the ancient authors, and\r\nDana (Syst. of Mineralogy, p. 211) considers the stone of Armenia, of\r\nTheophrastus (77), to be emery, although it could quite well be any hard\r\nstone, such as Novaculite--which is found in Armenia. Dioscorides (V,\r\n166) describes a stone with which the engravers polish gems.\r\n\r\nLAPIS JUDAICUS. (_Interpretatio_ gives _Jueden stein_). This was\r\nundoubtedly a fossil, possibly a _pentremites_. Agricola (_De Natura\r\nFossilium_, p. 256) says: \"It is shaped like an acorn, from the obtuse\r\nend to the point proceed raised lines, all equidistant, etc.\" Many\r\nfossils were included among the semi-precious stones by the Ancients.\r\nPliny (XXXVII, 55, 66, 73) describes many such stones, among them the\r\n_balanites_, _phoenicitis_ and the _pyren_, which resemble the above.\r\n\r\nTROCHITIS. (_Interpretatio_ gives _spangen oder rederstein_). This was\r\nalso a fossil, probably crinoid stems. Agricola (_De Natura Fossilium_,\r\np. 256) describes it: \"_Trochites_ is so called from a wheel, and is\r\nrelated to _lapis judaicus_. Nature has indeed given it the shape of a\r\ndrum (_tympanum_). The round part is smooth, but on both ends as it were\r\nthere is a module from which on all sides there extend radii to the\r\nouter edge, which corresponds with the radii. These radii are so much\r\nraised that it is fluted. The size of these _trochites_ varies greatly,\r\nfor the smallest is so little that the largest is ten times as big, and\r\nthe largest are a digit in length by a third of a digit in thickness ...\r\nwhen immersed in vinegar they make bubbles.\"\r\n\r\n[11] The \"extraordinary earths\" of Agricola were such substances as\r\nochres, tripoli, fullers earth, potters' clay, clay used for medicinal\r\npurposes, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[12] Presumably the ore-body dips into a neighbouring property.\r\n\r\n[13] The various kinds of iron tools are described in great detail in\r\nBook VI.\r\n\r\n[14] Fire-setting as an aid to breaking rock is of very ancient origin,\r\nand moreover it persisted in certain German and Norwegian mines down to\r\nthe end of the 19th century--270 years after the first application of\r\nexplosives to mining. The first specific reference to fire-setting in\r\nmining is by Agatharchides (2nd century B.C.) whose works are not\r\nextant, but who is quoted by both Diodorus Siculus and Photius, for\r\nwhich statement see note 8, p. 279. Pliny (XXXIII, 21) says:\r\n\"Occasionally a kind of silex is met with, which must be broken with\r\nfire and vinegar, or as the tunnels are filled with suffocating fumes\r\nand smoke, they frequently use bruising machines, carrying 150 _librae_\r\nof iron.\" This combination of fire and vinegar he again refers to\r\n(XXIII, 27), where he dilates in the same sentence on the usefulness of\r\nvinegar for breaking rock and for salad dressing. This myth about\r\nbreaking rocks with fire and vinegar is of more than usual interest, and\r\nits origin seems to be in the legend that Hannibal thus broke through\r\nthe Alps. Livy (59 B.C., 17 A.D.) seems to be the first to produce this\r\nmyth in writing; and, in any event, by Pliny's time (23-79 A.D.) it had\r\nbecome an established method--in literature. Livy (XXI, 37) says, in\r\nconnection with Hannibal's crossing of the Alps: \"They set fire to it\r\n(the timber) when a wind had arisen suitable to excite the fire, then\r\nwhen the rock was hot it was crumbled by pouring on vinegar (_infuso\r\naceto_). In this manner the cliff heated by the fire was broken by iron\r\ntools, and the declivities eased by turnings, so that not only the\r\nbeasts of burden but also the elephants could be led down.\" Hannibal\r\ncrossed the Alps in 218 B.C. and Livy's account was written 200 years\r\nlater, by which time Hannibal's memory among the Romans was generally\r\nsurrounded by Herculean fables. Be this as it may, by Pliny's time the\r\nvinegar was generally accepted, and has been ceaselessly debated ever\r\nsince. Nor has the myth ceased to grow, despite the remarks of Gibbon,\r\nLavalette, and others. A recent historian (Hennebert, _Histoire d'\r\nAnnibal_ II, p. 253) of that famous engineer and soldier, soberly sets\r\nout to prove that inasmuch as literal acceptance of ordinary vinegar is\r\nimpossible, the Phoenicians must have possessed some mysterious high\r\nexplosive. A still more recent biographer swallows this argument _in\r\ntoto_. (Morris, \"Hannibal,\" London, 1903, p. 103). A study of the\r\ncommentators of this passage, although it would fill a volume with\r\nsterile words, would disclose one generalization: That the real scholars\r\nhave passed over the passage with the comment that it is either a\r\ncorruption or an old woman's tale, but that hosts of soldiers who set\r\nabout the biography of famous generals and campaigns, almost to a man\r\ntake the passage seriously, and seriously explain it by way of the rock\r\nbeing limestone, or snow, or by the use of explosives, or other\r\nfoolishness. It has been proposed, although there are grammatical\r\nobjections, that the text is slightly corrupt and read _infosso acuto_,\r\ninstead of _infuso aceto_, in which case all becomes easy from a mining\r\npoint of view. If so, however, it must be assumed that the corruption\r\noccurred during the 20 years between Livy and Pliny.\r\n\r\nBy the use of fire-setting in recent times at Koenigsberg (Arthur L.\r\nCollins, \"Fire-setting,\" Federated Inst. of Mining Engineers, Vol. V, p.\r\n82) an advance of from 5 to 20 feet per month in headings was\r\naccomplished, and on the score of economy survived the use of gunpowder,\r\nbut has now been abandoned in favour of dynamite. We may mention that\r\nthe use of gunpowder for blasting was first introduced at Schemnitz by\r\nCaspar Weindle, in 1627, but apparently was not introduced into English\r\nmines for nearly 75 years afterward, as the late 17th century English\r\nwriters continue to describe fire-setting.\r\n\r\n[15] The strata here enumerated are given in the Glossary of _De Re\r\nMetallica_ as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Corium terrae_            _Die erd oder leim._\r\n  _Saxum rubrum_             _Rot gebirge._\r\n  _Alterum item rubrum_      _Roterkle._\r\n  _Argilla cinerea_          _Thone._\r\n  _Tertium saxum_            _Gerhulle._\r\n  _Cineris vena_             _Asche._\r\n  _Quartum saxum_            _Gniest._\r\n  _Quintum saxum_            _Schwehlen._\r\n  _Sextum saxum_             _Oberrauchstein._\r\n  _Septimum saxum_           _Zechstein._\r\n  _Octavum saxum_            _Underrauchstein._\r\n  _Nonum saxum_              _Blitterstein._\r\n  _Decimum saxum_            _Oberschuelen._\r\n  _Undecimum saxum_          _Mittelstein._\r\n  _Duodecimum saxum_         _Underschuelen._\r\n  _Decimumtertium saxum_     _Dach._\r\n  _Decimumquartum saxum_     _Norweg._\r\n  _Decimumquintum saxum_     _Lotwerg._\r\n  _Decimumsextum saxum_      _Kamme._\r\n  _Lapis aerosus fissilis_   _Schifer._\r\n\r\nThe description is no doubt that of the Mannsfeld cupriferous slates. It\r\nis of some additional interest as the first attempt at stratigraphic\r\ndistinctions, although this must not be taken too literally, for we have\r\nrendered the different numbered \"_saxum_\" in this connection as\r\n\"stratum.\" The German terms given by Agricola above, can many of them be\r\nidentified in the miners' terms to-day for the various strata at\r\nMannsfeld. Over the _kupferschiefer_ the names to-day are _kammschale_,\r\n_dach_, _faule_, _zechstein_, _rauchwacke_, _rauchstein_, _asche_. The\r\nrelative thickness of these beds is much the same as given by Agricola.\r\nThe stringers in the 8th stratum of stone, which fuse in the fire of the\r\nsecond order, were possibly calcite. The _rauchstein_ of the modern\r\nsection is distinguished by stringers of calcite, which give it at times\r\na brecciated appearance.\r\n\r\n[16] The history of surveying and surveying instruments, and in a\r\nsubsidiary way their application to mine work, is a subject upon which\r\nthere exists a most extensive literature. However, that portion of such\r\nhistory which relates to the period prior to Agricola represents a much\r\nless proportion of the whole than do the citations to this chapter in\r\n_De Re Metallica_, which is the first comprehensive discussion of the\r\nmining application. The history of such instruments is too extensive to\r\nbe entered upon in a footnote, but there are some fundamental\r\nconsiderations which, if they had been present in the minds of\r\nhistorical students of this subject, would have considerably abridged\r\nthe literature on it. First, there can be no doubt that measuring cords\r\nor rods and boundary stones existed almost from the first division of\r\nland. There is, therefore, no need to try to discover their origins.\r\nSecond, the history of surveying and surveying instruments really begins\r\nwith the invention of instruments for taking levels, or for the\r\ndetermination of angles with a view to geometrical calculation. The\r\nmeagre facts bearing upon this subject do not warrant the endless\r\nexpansion they have received by argument as to what was probable, in\r\norder to accomplish assumed methods of construction among the Ancients.\r\nFor instance, the argument that in carrying the Grand Canal over\r\nwatersheds with necessary reservoir supply, the Chinese must have had\r\naccurate levelling and surveying instruments before the Christian Era,\r\nand must have conceived in advance a completed work, does not hold water\r\nwhen any investigation will demonstrate that the canal grew by slow\r\naccretion from the lateral river systems, until it joined almost by\r\naccident. Much the same may be said about the preconception of\r\nengineering results in several other ancient works. There can be no\r\ncertainty as to who first invented instruments of the order mentioned\r\nabove; for instance, the invention of the dioptra has been ascribed to\r\nHero, _vide_ his work on the _Dioptra_. He has been assumed to have\r\nlived in the 1st or 2nd Century B.C. Recent investigations, however,\r\nhave shown that he lived about 100 A.D. (Sir Thomas Heath, Encyc. Brit.\r\n11th Ed., XIII, 378). As this instrument is mentioned by Vitruvius (50\r\n-0 B.C.) the myth that Hero was the inventor must also disappear.\r\nIncidentally Vitruvius (VIII, 5) describes a levelling instrument called\r\na _chorobates_, which was a frame levelled either by a groove of water\r\nor by plumb strings. Be the inventor of the _dioptra_ who he may, Hero's\r\nwork on that subject contains the first suggestion of mine surveys in\r\nthe problems (XIII, XIV, XV, XVI), where geometrical methods are\r\nelucidated for determining the depths required for the connection of\r\nshafts and tunnels. On the compass we give further notes on p. 56. It\r\nwas probably an evolution of the 13th Century. As to the application of\r\nangle- and level-determining instruments to underground surveys, so far\r\nas we know there is no reference prior to Agricola, except that of Hero.\r\nMr. Bennett Brough (Cantor Lecture, London, 1892) points out that the\r\n_Nuetzliche Bergbuechlin_ (see Appendix) describes a mine compass, but\r\nthere is not the slightest reference to its use for anything but surface\r\ndirection of veins.\r\n\r\nAlthough map-making of a primitive sort requires no instruments, except\r\nlegs, the oldest map in the world possesses unusual interest because it\r\nhappens to be a map of a mining region. This well-known Turin papyrus\r\ndates from Seti I. (about 1300 B.C.), and it represents certain gold\r\nmines between the Nile and the Red Sea. The best discussion is by Chabas\r\n(_Inscriptions des Mines d'Or_, Chalons-sur-Saone, Paris, 1862, p.\r\n30-36). Fragments of another papyrus, in the Turin Museum, are\r\nconsidered by Lieblein (_Deux Papyras Hieratiques_, Christiania, 1868)\r\nalso to represent a mine of the time of Rameses I. If so, this one dates\r\nfrom about 1400 B.C. As to an actual map of underground workings\r\n(disregarding illustrations) we know of none until after Agricola's\r\ntime. At his time maps were not made, as will be gathered from the text.\r\n\r\n[17] For greater clarity we have in a few places interpolated the terms\r\n\"major\" and \"minor\" triangles.\r\n\r\n[18] The names of the instruments here described in the original text,\r\ntheir German equivalents in the Glossary, and the terms adopted in\r\ntranslation are given below:--\r\n\r\n  LATIN TEXT.

I will\r\nnow speak first of all, of the iron tools with which veins and rocks are\r\nbroken, then of the buckets into which the lumps of earth, rock, metal,\r\nand other excavated materials are thrown, in order that they may be\r\ndrawn, conveyed, or carried out. Also, I will speak of the water vessels\r\nand drains, then of the machines of different kinds,[1] and lastly of\r\nthe maladies of miners. And while all these matters are being described\r\naccurately, many methods of work will be explained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 150 (Iron tools): A--First \"iron tool.\" B--Second.\r\nC--Third. D--Fourth.[2] E--Wedge. F--Iron block. G--Iron plate.\r\nH--Wooden handle. I--Handle inserted in first tool.]\r\n\r\nThere are certain iron tools which the miners designate by names of\r\ntheir own, and besides these, there are wedges, iron blocks, iron\r\nplates, hammers, crowbars, pikes, picks, hoes, and shovels. Of those\r\nwhich are especially referred to as \"iron tools\" there are four\r\nvarieties, which are different from one another in length or thickness,\r\nbut not in shape, for the upper end of all of them is broad and square,\r\nso that it can be struck by the hammer. The lower end is pointed so as\r\nto split the hard rocks and veins with its point. All of these have eyes\r\nexcept the fourth. The first, which is in daily use among miners, is\r\nthree-quarters of a foot long, a digit and a half wide, and a digit\r\nthick. The second is of the same width as the first, and the same\r\nthickness, but one and one half feet long, and is used to shatter the\r\nhardest veins in such a way that they crack open. The third is the same\r\nlength as the second, but is a little wider and thicker; with this one\r\nthey dig the bottoms of those shafts which slowly accumulate water. The\r\nfourth is nearly three palms and one digit long, two digits thick, and\r\nin the upper end it is three digits wide, in the middle it is one palm\r\nwide, and at the lower end it is pointed like the others; with this they\r\ncut out the harder veins. The eye in the first tool is one palm distant\r\nfrom the upper end, in the second and third it is seven digits distant;\r\neach swells out around the eye on both sides, and into it they fit a\r\nwooden handle, which they hold with one hand, while they strike the iron\r\ntool with a hammer, after placing it against the rock. These tools are\r\nmade larger or smaller as necessary. The smiths, as far as possible,\r\nsharpen again all that become dull.\r\n\r\nA wedge is usually three palms and two digits long and six digits wide;\r\nat the upper end, for a distance of a palm, it is three digits thick,\r\nand beyond that point it becomes thinner by degrees, until finally it is\r\nquite sharp.\r\n\r\nThe iron block is six digits in length and width; at the upper end it\r\nis two digits thick, and at the bottom a digit and a half. The iron\r\nplate is the same length and width as the iron block, but it is very\r\nthin. All of these, as I explained in the last book, are used when the\r\nhardest kind of veins are hewn out. Wedges, blocks, and plates, are\r\nlikewise made larger or smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 151 (Hammers): A--Smallest of the smaller hammers.\r\nB--Intermediate. C--Largest. D--Small kind of the larger hammer.\r\nE--Large kind. F--Wooden handle. G--Handle fixed in the smallest\r\nhammer.]\r\n\r\nHammers are of two kinds, the smaller ones the miners hold in one hand,\r\nand the larger ones they hold with both hands. The former, because of\r\ntheir size and use, are of three sorts. With the smallest, that is to\r\nsay, the lightest, they strike the second \"iron tool;\" with the\r\nintermediate one the first \"iron tool;\" and with the largest the third\r\n\"iron tool\"; this one is two digits wide and thick. Of the larger sort\r\nof hammers there are two kinds; with the smaller they strike the fourth\r\n\"iron tool;\" with the larger they drive the wedges into the cracks; the\r\nformer are three, and the latter five digits wide and thick, and a foot\r\nlong. All swell out in their middle, in which there is an eye for a\r\nhandle, but in most cases the handles are somewhat light, in order that\r\nthe workmen may be able to strike more powerful blows by the hammer's\r\nfull weight being thus concentrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 152a (Crowbars): A--Round crowbar. B--Flat crowbar.\r\nC--Pike.]\r\n\r\nThe iron crowbars are likewise of two kinds, and each kind is pointed\r\nat one end. One is rounded, and with this they pierce to a shaft full of\r\nwater when a tunnel reaches to it; the other is flat, and with this they\r\nknock out of the stopes on to the floor, the rocks which have been\r\nsoftened by the fire, and which cannot be dislodged by the pike. A\r\nminer's pike, like a sailor's, is a long rod having an iron head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 152b (Picks): A--Pick. B--Hoe. C--Shovel.]\r\n\r\nThe miner's pick differs from a peasant's pick in that the latter is\r\nwide at the bottom and sharp, but the former is pointed. It is used to\r\ndig out ore which is not hard, such as earth. Likewise a hoe and shovel\r\nare in no way different from the common articles, with the one they\r\nscrape up earth and sand, with the other they throw it into vessels.\r\n\r\nNow earth, rock, mineral substances and other things dug out with the\r\npick or hewn out with the \"iron tools\" are hauled out of the shaft in\r\nbuckets, or baskets, or hide buckets; they are drawn out of tunnels in\r\nwheelbarrows or open trucks, and from both they are sometimes carried in\r\ntrays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 154a (Buckets for hoisting ore)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 154b (Buckets for hoisting ore): A--Small bucket. B--Large\r\nbucket. C--Staves. D--Iron hoops. E--Iron straps. F--Iron straps on the\r\nbottom. G--Hafts. H--Iron bale. I--Hook of drawing-rope. K--Basket.\r\nL--Hide bucket or sack.]\r\n\r\nBuckets are of two kinds, which differ in size, but not in material or\r\nshape. The smaller for the most part hold only about one _metreta_; the\r\nlarger are generally capable of carrying one-sixth of a _congius_;\r\nneither is of unchangeable capacity, but they often vary.[3] Each is\r\nmade of staves circled with hoops, one of which binds the top and the\r\nother the bottom. The hoops are sometimes made of hazel and oak, but\r\nthese are easily broken by dashing against the shaft, while those made\r\nof iron are more durable. In the larger buckets the staves are thicker\r\nand wider, as also are both hoops, and in order that the buckets may be\r\nmore firm and strong, they have eight iron straps, somewhat broad, four\r\nof which run from the upper hoop downwards, and four from the lower hoop\r\nupwards, as if to meet each other. The bottom of each bucket, both\r\ninside and outside, is furnished with two or three straps of iron, which\r\nrun from one side of the lower hoop to the other, but the straps which\r\nare on the outside are fixed crosswise. Each bucket has two iron hafts\r\nwhich project above the edge, and it has an iron semi-circular bale\r\nwhose lower ends are fixed directly into the hafts, that the bucket may\r\nbe handled more easily. Each kind of bucket is much deeper than it is\r\nwide, and each is wider at the top, in order that the material which is\r\ndug out may be the more easily poured in and poured out again. Into the\r\nsmaller buckets strong boys, and into larger ones men, fill earth from\r\nthe bottom of the shaft with hoes; or the other material dug up is\r\nshovelled into them or filled in with their hands, for which reason\r\nthese men are called \"shovellers.[4]\" Afterward they fix the hook of the\r\ndrawing-rope into the bale; then the buckets are drawn up by\r\nmachines--the smaller ones, because of their lighter weight, by machines\r\nturned by men, and the larger ones, being heavier, by the machines\r\nturned by horses. Some, in place of these buckets, substitute baskets\r\nwhich hold just as much, or even more, since they are lighter than the\r\nbuckets; some use sacks made of ox-hide instead of buckets, and the\r\ndrawing-rope hook is fastened to their iron bale, usually three of these\r\nfilled with excavated material are drawn up at the same time as three\r\nare being lowered and three are being filled by boys. The latter are\r\ngenerally used at Schneeberg and the former at Freiberg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 155 (Wheelbarrows): A--Small wheelbarrow. B--Long planks\r\nthereof. C--End-boards. D--Small wheel. E--Larger barrow. F--Front\r\nend-board thereof.]\r\n\r\nThat which we call a _cisium_[5] is a vehicle with one wheel, not with\r\ntwo, such as horses draw. When filled with excavated material it is\r\npushed by a workman out of tunnels or sheds. It is made as follows: two\r\nplanks are chosen about five feet long, one foot wide, and two digits\r\nthick; of each of these the lower side is cut away at the front for a\r\nlength of one foot, and at the back for a length of two feet, while the\r\nmiddle is left whole. Then in the front parts are bored circular holes,\r\nin order that the ends of an axle may revolve in them. The intermediate\r\nparts of the planks are perforated twice near the bottom, so as to\r\nreceive the heads of two little cleats on which the planks are fixed;\r\nand they are also perforated in the middle, so as to receive the heads\r\nof two end-boards, while keys fixed in these projecting heads strengthen\r\nthe whole structure. The handles are made out of the extreme ends of the\r\nlong planks, and they turn downward at the ends that they may be grasped\r\nmore firmly in the hands. The small wheel, of which there is only one,\r\nneither has a nave nor does it revolve around the axle, but turns around\r\nwith it. From the felloe, which the Greeks called [Greek: apsides], two\r\ntransverse spokes fixed into it pass through the middle of the axle\r\ntoward the opposite felloe; the axle is square, with the exception of\r\nthe ends, each of which is rounded so as to turn in the opening. A\r\nworkman draws out this barrow full of earth and rock and draws it back\r\nempty. Miners also have another wheelbarrow, larger than this one, which\r\nthey use when they wash earth mixed with tin-stone on to which a stream\r\nhas been turned. The front end-board of this one is deeper, in order\r\nthat the earth which has been thrown into it may not fall out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 156 (Trucks): A--Rectangular iron bands on truck. B--Its\r\niron straps. C--Iron axle. D--Wooden rollers. E--Small iron keys.\r\nF--Large blunt iron pin. G--Same truck upside down.]\r\n\r\nThe open truck has a capacity half as large again as a wheelbarrow; it\r\nis about four feet long and about two and a half feet wide and deep; and\r\nsince its shape is rectangular, it is bound together with three\r\nrectangular iron bands, and besides these there are iron straps on all\r\nsides. Two small iron axles are fixed to the bottom, around the ends of\r\nwhich wooden rollers revolve on either side; in order that the rollers\r\nshall not fall off the immovable axles, there are small iron keys. A\r\nlarge blunt pin fixed to the bottom of the truck runs in a groove of a\r\nplank in such a way that the truck does not leave the beaten track.\r\nHolding the back part with his hands, the carrier pushes out the truck\r\nladen with excavated material, and pushes it back again empty. Some\r\npeople call it a \"dog\"[6], because when it moves it makes a noise which\r\nseems to them not unlike the bark of a dog. This truck is used when they\r\ndraw loads out of the longest tunnels, both because it is moved more\r\neasily and because a heavier load can be placed in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 157 (Batea): A--Small batea. B--Rope. C--Large batea.]\r\n\r\nBateas[7] are hollowed out of a single block of wood; the smaller kind\r\nare generally two feet long and one foot wide. When they have been\r\nfilled with ore, especially when but little is dug from the shafts and\r\ntunnels, men either carry them out on their shoulders, or bear them away\r\nhung from their necks. Pliny[8] is our authority that among the\r\nancients everything which was mined was carried out on men's shoulders,\r\nbut in truth this method of carrying forth burdens is onerous, since it\r\ncauses great fatigue to a great number of men, and involves a large\r\nexpenditure for labour; for this reason it has been rejected and\r\nabandoned in our day. The length of the larger batea is as much as three\r\nfeet, the width up to a foot and a palm. In these bateas the metallic\r\nearth is washed for the purpose of testing it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 158a (Buckets for hoisting water): A--Smaller\r\nwater-bucket. B--Larger water-bucket. C--Dipper.]\r\n\r\nWater-vessels differ both in the use to which they are put and in the\r\nmaterial of which they are made; some draw the water from the shafts and\r\npour it into other things, as dippers; while some of the vessels filled\r\nwith water are drawn out by machines, as buckets and bags; some are made\r\nof wood, as the dippers and buckets, and others of hides, as the bags.\r\nThe water-buckets, just like the buckets which are filled with dry\r\nmaterial, are of two kinds, the smaller and the larger, but these are\r\nunlike the other buckets at the top, as in this case they are narrower,\r\nin order that the water may not be spilled by being bumped against the\r\ntimbers when they are being drawn out of the shafts, especially those\r\nconsiderably inclined. The water is poured into these buckets by\r\ndippers, which are small wooden buckets, but unlike the water-buckets,\r\nthey are neither narrow at the top nor bound with iron hoops, but with\r\nhazel,--because there is no necessity for either. The smaller buckets\r\nare drawn up by machines turned by men, the larger ones by those turned\r\nby horses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 158b (Bags for hoisting water): A--Water-bag which takes\r\nin water by itself. B--Water-bag into which water pours when it is\r\npushed with a shovel.]\r\n\r\nOur people give the name of water-bags to those very large skins for\r\ncarrying water which are made of two, or two and a half, ox-hides. When\r\nthese water-bags have undergone much wear and use, first the hair comes\r\noff them and they become bald and shining; after this they become torn.\r\nIf the tear is but a small one, a piece of smooth notched stick is put\r\ninto the broken part, and the broken bag is bound into its notches on\r\neither side and sewn together; but if it is a large one, they mend it\r\nwith a piece of ox-hide. The water-bags are fixed to the hook of a\r\ndrawing-chain and let down and dipped into the water, and as soon as\r\nthey are filled they are drawn up by the largest machine. They are of\r\ntwo kinds; the one kind take in the water by themselves; the water pours\r\ninto the other kind when it is pushed in a certain way by a wooden\r\nshovel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 159 (Trough): A--Trough. B--Hopper.]\r\n\r\nWhen the water has been drawn out from the shafts, it is run off in\r\ntroughs, or into a hopper, through which it runs into the trough.\r\nLikewise the water which flows along the sides of the tunnels is carried\r\noff in drains. These are composed of two hollowed beams joined firmly\r\ntogether, so as to hold the water which flows through them, and they are\r\ncovered by planks all along their course, from the mouth of the tunnel\r\nright up to the extreme end of it, to prevent earth or rock falling into\r\nthem and obstructing the flow of the water. If much mud gradually\r\nsettles in them the planks are raised and the drains are cleaned out,\r\nfor they would otherwise become stopped up and obstructed by this\r\naccident. With regard to the trough lying above ground, which miners\r\nplace under the hoppers which are close by the shaft houses, these are\r\nusually hollowed out of single trees. Hoppers are generally made of four\r\nplanks, so cut on the lower side and joined together that the top part\r\nof the hopper is broader and the bottom part narrower.\r\n\r\nI have sufficiently indicated the nature of the miners' iron tools and\r\ntheir vessels. I will now explain their machines, which are of three\r\nkinds, that is, hauling machines, ventilating machines, and ladders. By\r\nmeans of the hauling machines loads are drawn out of the shafts; the\r\nventilating machines receive the air through their mouths and blow it\r\ninto shafts or tunnels, for if this is not done, diggers cannot carry on\r\ntheir labour without great difficulty in breathing; by the steps of the\r\nladders the miners go down into the shafts and come up again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 161 (Windlass): A--Timber placed in front of the shaft.\r\nB--Timber placed at the back of the shaft. C--Pointed stakes.\r\nD--Cross-timbers. E--Posts or thick planks. F--Iron sockets. G--Barrel.\r\nH--Ends of barrel. I--Pieces of wood. K--handle. L--Drawing-rope. M--Its\r\nhook. N--Bucket. O--Bale of the bucket.]\r\n\r\nHauling machines are of varied and diverse forms, some of them being\r\nmade with great skill, and if I am not mistaken, they were unknown to\r\nthe Ancients. They have been invented in order that water may be drawn\r\nfrom the depths of the earth to which no tunnels reach, and also the\r\nexcavated material from shafts which are likewise not connected with a\r\ntunnel, or if so, only with very long ones. Since shafts are not all of\r\nthe same depth, there is a great variety among these hauling machines.\r\nOf those by which dry loads are drawn out of the shafts, five sorts are\r\nin the most common use, of which I will now describe the first. Two\r\ntimbers a little longer than the shaft are placed beside it, the one in\r\nthe front of the shaft, the other at the back. Their extreme ends have\r\nholes through which stakes, pointed at the bottom like wedges, are\r\ndriven deeply into the ground, so that the timbers may remain\r\nstationary. Into these timbers are mortised the ends of two\r\ncross-timbers, one laid on the right end of the shaft, while the other\r\nis far enough from the left end that between it and that end there\r\nremains suitable space for placing the ladders. In the middle of the\r\ncross-timbers, posts are fixed and secured with iron keys. In hollows at\r\nthe top of these posts thick iron sockets hold the ends of the barrel,\r\nof which each end projects beyond the hollow of the post, and is\r\nmortised into the end of another piece of wood a foot and a half long, a\r\npalm wide and three digits thick; the other end of these pieces of wood\r\nis seven digits wide, and into each of them is fixed a round handle,\r\nlikewise a foot and a half long. A winding-rope is wound around the\r\nbarrel and fastened to it at the middle part. The loop at each end of\r\nthe rope has an iron hook which is engaged in the bale of a bucket, and\r\nso when the windlass revolves by being turned by the cranks, a loaded\r\nbucket is always being drawn out of the shaft and an empty one is being\r\nsent down into it. Two robust men turn the windlass, each having a\r\nwheelbarrow near him, into which he unloads the bucket which is drawn up\r\nnearest to him; two buckets generally fill a wheelbarrow; therefore when\r\nfour buckets have been drawn up, each man runs his own wheelbarrow out\r\nof the shed and empties it. Thus it happens that if shafts are dug deep,\r\na hillock rises around the shed of the windlass. If a vein is not\r\nmetal-bearing, they pour out the earth and rock without discriminating;\r\nwhereas if it is metal-bearing, they preserve these materials, which\r\nthey unload separately and crush and wash. When they draw up buckets of\r\nwater they empty the water through the hopper into a trough, through\r\nwhich it flows away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 162 (Windlass): A--Barrel. B--Straight levers. C--Usual\r\ncrank. D--Spokes of wheel. E--Rim of the same wheel.]\r\n\r\nThe next kind of machine, which miners employ when the shaft is deeper,\r\ndiffers from the first in that it possesses a wheel as well as cranks.\r\nThis windlass, if the load is not being drawn up from a great depth, is\r\nturned by one windlass man, the wheel taking the place of the other man.\r\nBut if the depth is greater, then the windlass is turned by three men,\r\nthe wheel being substituted for a fourth, because the barrel having been\r\nonce set in motion, the rapid revolutions of the wheel help, and it can\r\nbe turned more easily. Sometimes masses of lead are hung on to this\r\nwheel, or are fastened to the spokes, in order that when it is turned\r\nthey depress the spokes by their weight and increase the motion; some\r\npersons for the same reason fasten into the barrel two, three, or four\r\niron rods, and weight their ends with lumps of lead. The windlass wheel\r\ndiffers from the wheel of a carriage and from the one which is turned\r\nby water power, for it lacks the buckets of a water-wheel and it lacks\r\nthe nave of a carriage wheel. In the place of the nave it has a thick\r\nbarrel, in which are mortised the lower ends of the spokes, just as\r\ntheir upper ends are mortised into the rim. When three windlass men turn\r\nthis machine, four straight levers are fixed to the one end of the\r\nbarrel, and to the other the crank which is usual in mines, and which is\r\ncomposed of two limbs, of which the rounded horizontal one is grasped by\r\nthe hands; the rectangular limb, which is at right angles to the\r\nhorizontal one, has mortised in its lower end the round handle, and in\r\nthe upper end the end of the barrel. This crank is worked by one man,\r\nthe levers by two men, of whom one pulls while the other pushes; all\r\nwindlass workers, whatsoever kind of a machine they may turn, are\r\nnecessarily robust that they can sustain such great toil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 163 (Tread whim): A--Upright axle. B--Block. C--Roof beam.\r\nD--Wheel. E--Toothed-drum. F--Horizontal axle. G--Drum composed of\r\nrundles. H--Drawing rope. I--Pole. K--Upright posts. L--Cleats on the\r\nwheel.]\r\n\r\nThe third kind of machine is less fatiguing for the workman, while it\r\nraises larger loads; even though it is slower, like all other machines\r\nwhich have drums, yet it reaches greater depths, even to a depth of 180\r\nfeet. It consists of an upright axle with iron journals at its\r\nextremities, which turn in two iron sockets, the lower of which is fixed\r\nin a block set in the ground and the upper one in the roof beam. This\r\naxle has at its lower end a wheel made of thick planks joined firmly\r\ntogether, and at its upper end a toothed drum; this toothed drum turns\r\nanother drum made of rundles, which is on a horizontal axle. A\r\nwinding-rope is wound around this latter axle, which turns in iron\r\nbearings set in the beams. So that they may not fall, the two workmen\r\ngrasp with their hands a pole fixed to two upright posts, and then\r\npushing the cleats of the lower wheel backward with their feet, they\r\nrevolve the machine; as often as they have drawn up and emptied one\r\nbucket full of excavated material, they turn the machine in the opposite\r\ndirection and draw out another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 165 (Horse whim): A--Upright beams. B--Sills laid flat\r\nupon the ground. C--Posts. D--Area. E--Sill set at the bottom of the\r\nhole. F--Axle. G--Double cross-beams. H--Drum. I--Winding-ropes.\r\nK--Bucket. L--Small pieces of wood hanging from double cross-beams.\r\nM--Short wooden block. N--Chain. O--Pole bar. P--Grappling hook. (Some\r\nmembers mentioned in the text are not shown).]\r\n\r\nThe fourth machine raises burdens once and a half as large again as the\r\ntwo machines first explained. When it is made, sixteen beams are erected\r\neach forty feet long, one foot thick and one foot wide, joined at the\r\ntop with clamps and widely separated at the bottom. The lower ends of\r\nall of them are mortised into separate sills laid flat upon the ground;\r\nthese sills are five feet long, a foot and a half wide, and a foot\r\nthick. Each beam is also connected with its sill by a post, whose upper\r\nend is mortised into the beam and its lower end mortised into the sill;\r\nthese posts are four feet long, one foot thick, and one foot wide. Thus\r\na circular area is made, the diameter of which is fifty feet; in the\r\nmiddle of this area a hole is sunk to a depth of ten feet, and rammed\r\ndown tight, and in order to give it sufficient firmness, it is\r\nstrengthened with contiguous small timbers, through which pins are\r\ndriven, for by them the earth around the hole is held so that it cannot\r\nfall in. In the bottom of the hole is planted a sill, three or four feet\r\nlong and a foot and a half thick and wide; in order that it may remain\r\nfixed, it is set into the small timbers; in the middle of it is a steel\r\nsocket in which the pivot of the axle turns. In like manner a timber is\r\nmortised into two of the large beams, at the top beneath the clamps;\r\nthis has an iron bearing in which the other iron journal of the axle\r\nrevolves. Every axle used in mining, to speak of them once for all, has\r\ntwo iron journals, rounded off on all sides, one fixed with keys in the\r\ncentre of each end. That part of this journal which is fixed to the end\r\nof the axle is as broad as the end itself and a digit thick; that which\r\nprojects beyond the axle is round and a palm thick, or thicker if\r\nnecessity requires; the ends of each miner's axle are encircled and\r\nbound by an iron band to hold the journal more securely. The axle of\r\nthis machine, except at the ends, is square, and is forty feet long, a\r\nfoot and a half thick and wide. Mortised and clamped into the axle above\r\nthe lower end are the ends of four inclined beams; their outer ends\r\nsupport two double cross-beams similarly mortised into them; the\r\ninclined beams are eighteen feet long, three palms thick, and five wide.\r\nThe two cross-beams are fixed to the axle and held together by wooden\r\nkeys so that they will not separate, and they are twenty-four feet long.\r\nNext, there is a drum which is made of three wheels, of which the middle\r\none is seven feet distant from the upper one and from the lower one; the\r\nwheels have four spokes which are supported by the same number of\r\ninclined braces, the lower ends of which are joined together round the\r\naxle by a clamp; one end of each spoke is mortised into the axle and the\r\nother into the rim. There are rundles all round the wheels, reaching\r\nfrom the rim of the lowest one to the rim of the middle one, and\r\nlikewise from the rim of the middle wheel to the rim of the top one;\r\naround these rundles are wound the drawing-ropes, one between the lowest\r\nwheel and the middle one, the other between the middle and top wheels.\r\nThe whole of this construction is shaped like a cone, and is covered\r\nwith a shingle roof, with the exception of that square part which faces\r\nthe shaft. Then cross-beams, mortised at both ends, connect a double row\r\nof upright posts; all of these are eighteen feet long, but the posts are\r\none foot thick and one foot wide, and the cross-beams are three palms\r\nthick and wide. There are sixteen posts and eight cross-beams, and upon\r\nthese cross-beams are laid two timbers a foot wide and three palms\r\nthick, hollowed out to a width of half a foot and to a depth of five\r\ndigits; the one is laid upon the upper cross-beams and the other upon\r\nthe lower; each is long enough to reach nearly from the drum of the whim\r\nto the shaft. Near the same drum each timber has a small round wooden\r\nroller six digits thick, whose ends are covered with iron bands and\r\nrevolve in iron rings. Each timber also has a wooden pulley, which\r\ntogether with its iron axle revolves in holes in the timber. These\r\npulleys are hollowed out all round, in order that the drawing-rope may\r\nnot slip out of them, and thus each rope is drawn tight and turns over\r\nits own roller and its own pulley. The iron hook of each rope is engaged\r\nwith the bale of the bucket. Further, with regard to the double\r\ncross-beams which are mortised to the lower part of the main axle, to\r\neach end of them there is mortised a small piece of wood four feet long.\r\nThese appear to hang from the double cross-beams, and a short wooden\r\nblock is fixed to the lower part of them, on which a driver sits. Each\r\nof these blocks has an iron clavis which holds a chain, and that in turn\r\na pole-bar. In this way it is possible for two horses to draw this whim,\r\nnow this way and now that; turn by turn one bucket is drawn out of the\r\nshaft full and another is let down into it empty; if, indeed, the shaft\r\nis very deep four horses turn the whim. When a bucket has been drawn up,\r\nwhether filled with dry or wet materials, it must be emptied, and a\r\nworkman inserts a grappling hook and overturns it; this hook hangs on a\r\nchain made of three or four links, fixed to a timber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 167 (Horse whim): A--Toothed drum which is on the upright\r\naxle. B--Horizontal axle. C--Drum which is made of rundles. D--Wheel\r\nnear it. E--Drum made of hubs. F--Brake. G--Oscillating beam. H--Short\r\nbeam. I--Hook.]\r\n\r\nThe fifth machine is partly like the whim, and partly like the third rag\r\nand chain pump, which draws water by balls when turned by horse power,\r\nas I will explain a little later. Like this pump, it is turned by horse\r\npower and has two axles, namely, an upright one--about whose lower end,\r\nwhich descends into an underground chamber, there is a toothed drum--and\r\na horizontal one, around which there is a drum made of rundles. It has\r\nindeed two drums around its horizontal axle, similar to those of the big\r\nmachine, but smaller, because it draws buckets from a shaft almost two\r\nhundred and forty feet deep. One drum is made of hubs to which cleats\r\nare fixed, and the other is made of rundles; and near the latter is a\r\nwheel two feet deep, measured on all sides around the axle, and one foot\r\nwide; and against this impinges a brake,[10] which holds the whim when\r\noccasion demands that it be stopped. This is necessary when the hide\r\nbuckets are emptied after being drawn up full of rock fragments or\r\nearth, or as often as water is poured out of buckets similarly drawn up;\r\nfor this machine not only raises dry loads, but also wet ones, just like\r\nthe other four machines which I have already described. By this also,\r\ntimbers fastened on to its winding-chain are let down into a shaft. The\r\nbrake is made of a piece of wood one foot thick and half a foot long,\r\nprojecting from a timber that is suspended by a chain from one end of a\r\nbeam which oscillates on an iron pin, this in turn being supported in\r\nthe claws of an upright post; and from the other end of this oscillating\r\nbeam a long timber is suspended by a chain, and from this long timber\r\nagain a short beam is suspended. A workman sits on the short beam when\r\nthe machine needs to be stopped, and lowers it; he then inserts a plank\r\nor small stick so that the two timbers are held down and cannot be\r\nraised. In this way the brake is raised, and seizing the drum, presses\r\nit so tightly that sparks often fly from it; the suspended timber to\r\nwhich the short beam is attached, has several holes in which the chain\r\nis fixed, so that it may be raised as much as is convenient. Above\r\nthis wheel there are boards to prevent the water from dripping down and\r\nwetting it, for if it becomes wet the brake will not grip the machine so\r\nwell. Near the other drum is a pin from which hangs a chain, in the last\r\nlink of which there is an iron hook three feet long; a ring is fixed to\r\nthe bottom of the bucket, and this hook, being inserted into it, holds\r\nthe bucket back so that the water may be poured out or the fragments of\r\nrock emptied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 168 (Sleigh for Ore): A--Sledge with box placed on it.\r\nB--Sledge with sacks placed on it. C--Stick. D--Dogs with pack-saddles.\r\nE--Pigskin sacks tied to a rope.]\r\n\r\nThe miners either carry, draw, or roll down the mountains the ore which\r\nis hauled out of the shafts by these five machines or taken out of the\r\ntunnels. In the winter time our people place a box on a sledge and draw\r\nit down the low mountains with a horse; and in this season they also\r\nfill sacks made of hide and load them on dogs, or place two or three of\r\nthem on a small sledge which is higher in the fore part and lower at the\r\nback. Sitting on these sacks, not without risk of his life, the bold\r\ndriver guides the sledge as it rushes down the mountain into the valleys\r\nwith a stick, which he carries in his hand; when it is rushing down too\r\nquickly he arrests it with the stick, or with the same stick brings it\r\nback to the track when it is turning aside from its proper course. Some\r\nof the Noricians[11] collect ore during the winter into sacks made of\r\nbristly pigskins, and drag them down from the highest mountains, which\r\nneither horses, mules nor asses can climb. Strong dogs, that are trained\r\nto bear pack saddles, carry these sacks when empty into the mountains.\r\nWhen they are filled with ore, bound with thongs, and fastened to a\r\nrope, a man, winding the rope round his arm or breast, drags them down\r\nthrough the snow to a place where horses, mules, or asses bearing\r\npack-saddles can climb. There the ore is removed from the pigskin sacks\r\nand put into other sacks made of double or triple twilled linen thread,\r\nand these placed on the pack-saddles of the beasts are borne down to the\r\nworks where the ores are washed or smelted. If, indeed, the horses,\r\nmules, or asses are able to climb the mountains, linen sacks filled with\r\nore are placed on their saddles, and they carry these down the narrow\r\nmountain paths, which are passable neither by wagons nor sledges, into\r\nthe valleys lying below the steeper portions of the mountains. But on\r\nthe declivity of cliffs which beasts cannot climb, are placed long open\r\nboxes made of planks, with transverse cleats to hold them together; into\r\nthese boxes is thrown the ore which has been brought in wheelbarrows,\r\nand when it has run down to the level it is gathered into sacks, and the\r\nbeasts either carry it away on their backs or drag it away after it has\r\nbeen thrown into sledges or wagons. When the drivers bring ore down\r\nsteep mountain slopes they use two-wheeled carts, and they drag behind\r\nthem on the ground the trunks of two trees, for these by their weight\r\nhold back the heavily-laden carts, which contain ore in their boxes, and\r\ncheck their descent, and but for these the driver would often be obliged\r\nto bind chains to the wheels. When these men bring down ore from\r\nmountains which do not have such declivities, they use wagons whose beds\r\nare twice as long as those of the carts. The planks of these are so put\r\ntogether that, when the ore is unloaded by the drivers, they can be\r\nraised and taken apart, for they are only held together by bars. The\r\ndrivers employed by the owners of the ore bring down thirty or sixty\r\nwagon-loads, and the master of the works marks on a stick the number of\r\nloads for each driver. But some ore, especially tin, after being taken\r\nfrom the mines, is divided into eight parts, or into nine, if the owners\r\nof the mine give \"ninth parts\" to the owners of the tunnel. This is\r\noccasionally done by measuring with a bucket, but more frequently planks\r\nare put together on a spot where, with the addition of the level ground\r\nas a base, it forms a hollow box. Each owner provides for removing,\r\nwashing, and smelting that portion which has fallen to him.\r\n(Illustration p. 170).\r\n\r\n[Illustration 170 (Wagons for Hauling Ore): A--Horses with pack-saddles.\r\nB--Long box placed on the slope of the cliff.

As I have said, the same\r\nmachines raise not only dry loads, but also wet ones, or water; but\r\nbefore I explain the varied and diverse kinds of machines by which\r\nminers are wont to draw water alone, I will explain how heavy bodies,\r\nsuch as axles, iron chains, pipes, and heavy timbers, should be lowered\r\ninto deep vertical shafts. A windlass is erected whose barrel has on\r\neach end four straight levers; it is fixed into upright beams and around\r\nit is wound a rope, one end of which is fastened to the barrel and the\r\nother to those heavy bodies which are slowly lowered down by workmen;\r\nand if these halt at any part of the shaft they are drawn up a little\r\nway. When these bodies are very heavy, then behind this windlass another\r\nis erected just like it, that their combined strength may be equal to\r\nthe load, and that it may be lowered slowly. Sometimes for the same\r\nreason, a pulley is fastened with cords to the roof-beam, and the rope\r\ndescends and ascends over it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 171 (Windlass): A--Windlass. B--Straight levers.\r\nC--Upright beams. D--Rope. E--Pulley. F--Timbers to be lowered.]\r\n\r\nWater is either hoisted or pumped out of shafts. It is hoisted up after\r\nbeing poured into buckets or water-bags; the water-bags are generally\r\nbrought up by a machine whose water-wheels have double paddles, while\r\nthe buckets are brought up by the five machines already described,\r\nalthough in certain localities the fourth machine also hauls up\r\nwater-bags of moderate size. Water is drawn up also by chains of\r\ndippers, or by suction pumps, or by \"rag and chain\" pumps.[12] When\r\nthere is but a small quantity, it is either brought up in buckets or\r\ndrawn up by chains of dippers or suction pumps, and when there is much\r\nwater it is either drawn up in hide bags or by rag and chain pumps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 173 (Chain Pumps): A--Iron frame.

Y--Lower drum or balance\r\nweight.]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I will describe the machines which draw water by chains of\r\ndippers, of which there are three kinds. For the first, a frame is made\r\nentirely of iron bars; it is two and a half feet high, likewise two and\r\na half feet long, and in addition one-sixth and one-quarter of a digit\r\nlong, one-fourth and one-twenty-fourth of a foot wide. In it there are\r\nthree little horizontal iron axles, which revolve in bearings or wide\r\npillows of steel, and also four iron wheels, of which two are made with\r\nrundles and the same number are toothed. Outside the frame, around the\r\nlowest axle, is a wooden fly-wheel, so that it can be more readily\r\nturned, and inside the frame is a smaller drum which is made of eight\r\nrundles, one-sixth and one twenty-fourth of a foot long. Around the\r\nsecond axle, which does not project beyond the frame, and is therefore\r\nonly two and a half feet and one-twelfth and one-third part of a digit\r\nlong, there is on the one side, a smaller toothed wheel, which has\r\nforty-eight teeth, and on the other side a larger drum, which is\r\nsurrounded by twelve rundles one-quarter of a foot long. Around the\r\nthird axle, which is one inch and one-third thick, is a larger toothed\r\nwheel projecting one foot from the axle in all directions, which has\r\nseventy-two teeth. The teeth of each wheel are fixed in with screws,\r\nwhose threads are screwed into threads in the wheel, so that those teeth\r\nwhich are broken can be replaced by others; both the teeth and rundles\r\nare steel. The upper axle projects beyond the frame, and is so skilfully\r\nmortised into the body of another axle that it has the appearance of\r\nbeing one; this axle proceeds through a frame made of beams which stands\r\naround the shaft, into an iron fork set in a stout oak timber, and turns\r\non a roller made of pure steel. Around this axle is a drum of the kind\r\npossessed by those machines which draw water by rag and chain; this drum\r\nhas triple curved iron clamps, to which the links of an iron chain hook\r\nthemselves, so that a great weight cannot tear them away. These links\r\nare not whole like the links of other chains, but each one being curved\r\nin the upper part on each side catches the one which comes next, whereby\r\nit presents the appearance of a double chain. At the point where one\r\ncatches the other, dippers made of iron or brass plates and holding half\r\na _congius_[13] are bound to them with thongs; thus, if there are one\r\nhundred links there will be the same number of dippers pouring out\r\nwater. When the shafts are inclined, the mouths of the dippers project\r\nand are covered on the top that they may not spill out the water, but\r\nwhen the shafts are vertical the dippers do not require a cover. By\r\nfitting the end of the lowest small axle into the crank, the man who\r\nworks the crank turns the axle, and at the same time the drum whose\r\nrundles turn the toothed wheel of the second axle; by this wheel is\r\ndriven the one that is made of rundles, which again turns the toothed\r\nwheel of the upper small axle and thus the drum to which the clamps are\r\nfixed. In this way the chain, together with the empty dippers, is slowly\r\nlet down, close to the footwall side of the vein, into the sump to the\r\nbottom of the balance drum, which turns on a little iron axle, both ends\r\nof which are set in a thick iron bearing. The chain is rolled round the\r\ndrum and the dippers fill with water; the chain being drawn up close to\r\nthe hangingwall side, carries the dippers filled with water above the\r\ndrum of the upper axle. Thus there are always three of the dippers\r\ninverted and pouring water into a lip, from which it flows away into the\r\ndrain of the tunnel. This machine is less useful, because it cannot be\r\nconstructed without great expense, and it carries off but little water\r\nand is somewhat slow, as also are other machines which possess a great\r\nnumber of drums.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 174 (Chain Pumps): A--Wheel which is turned by treading.\r\nB--Axle. C--Double chain. D--Link of double chain. E--Dippers. F--Simple\r\nclamps. G--Clamp with triple curves.]\r\n\r\nThe next machine of this kind, described in a few words by\r\nVitruvius,[14] more rapidly brings up dippers, holding a _congius_; for\r\nthis reason, it is more useful than the first one for drawing water out\r\nof shafts, into which much water is continually flowing. This machine\r\nhas no iron frame nor drums, but has around its axle a wooden wheel\r\nwhich is turned by treading; the axle, since it has no drum, does not\r\nlast very long. In other respects this pump resembles the first kind,\r\nexcept that it differs from it by having a double chain. Clamps should\r\nbe fixed to the axle of this machine, just as to the drum of the other\r\none; some of these are made simple and others with triple curves, but\r\neach kind has four barbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 175 (Chain Pumps): A--Wheel whose paddles are turned by\r\nthe force of the stream. B--Axle. C--Drum of axle, to which clamps are\r\nfixed. D--Chain. E--Link. F--Dippers. G--Balance drum.]\r\n\r\nThe third machine, which far excels the two just described, is made when\r\na running stream can be diverted to a mine; the impetus of the stream\r\nstriking the paddles revolves a water-wheel in place of the wheel turned\r\nby treading. With regard to the axle, it is like the second machine, but\r\nthe drum which is round the axle, the chain, and the balance drum, are\r\nlike the first machine. It has much more capacious dippers than even the\r\nsecond machine, but since the dippers are frequently broken, miners\r\nrarely use these machines; for they prefer to lift out small quantities\r\nof water by the first five machines or to draw it up by suction pumps,\r\nor, if there is much water, to drain it by the rag and chain pump or to\r\nbring it up in water-bags.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 177 (Suction Pumps): A--Sump.

I will now explain the other,\r\nthat is the pump which draws, by means of pistons, water which has been\r\nraised by suction. Of these there are seven varieties, which though they\r\ndiffer from one another in structure, nevertheless confer the same\r\nbenefits upon miners, though some to a greater degree than others. The\r\nfirst pump is made as follows. Over the sump is placed a flooring,\r\nthrough which a pipe--or two lengths of pipe, one of which is joined\r\ninto the other--are let down to the bottom of the sump; they are\r\nfastened with pointed iron clamps driven in straight on both sides, so\r\nthat the pipes may remain fixed. The lower end of the lower pipe is\r\nenclosed in a trunk two feet deep; this trunk, hollow like the pipe,\r\nstands at the bottom of the sump, but the lower opening of it is blocked\r\nwith a round piece of wood; the trunk has perforations round about,\r\nthrough which water flows into it. If there is one length of pipe, then\r\nin the upper part of the trunk which has been hollowed out there is\r\nenclosed a box of iron, copper, or brass, one palm deep, but without a\r\nbottom, and a rounded valve so tightly closes it that the water, which\r\nhas been drawn up by suction, cannot run back; but if there are two\r\nlengths of pipe, the box is enclosed in the lower pipe at the point of\r\njunction. An opening or a spout in the upper pipe reaches to the drain\r\nof the tunnel. Thus the workman, eager at his labour, standing on the\r\nflooring boards, pushes the piston down into the pipe and draws it out\r\nagain. At the top of the piston-rod is a hand-bar and the bottom is\r\nfixed in a shoe; this is the name given to the leather covering, which\r\nis almost cone-shaped, for it is so stitched that it is tight at the\r\nlower end, where it is fixed to the piston-rod which it surrounds, but\r\nin the upper end where it draws the water it is wide open. Or else an\r\niron disc one digit thick is used, or one of wood six digits thick, each\r\nof which is far superior to the shoe. The disc is fixed by an iron key\r\nwhich penetrates through the bottom of the piston-rod, or it is screwed\r\non to the rod; it is round, with its upper part protected by a cover,\r\nand has five or six openings, either round or oval, which taken together\r\npresent a star-like appearance; the disc has the same diameter as the\r\ninside of the pipe, so that it can be just drawn up and down in it. When\r\nthe workman draws the piston up, the water which has passed in at the\r\nopenings of the disc, whose cover is then closed, is raised to the hole\r\nor little spout, through which it flows away; then the valve of the box\r\nopens, and the water which has passed into the trunk is drawn up by the\r\nsuction and rises into the pipe; but when the workman pushes down the\r\npiston, the valve closes and allows the disc again to draw in the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 178 (Suction Pumps): A--Erect timber. B--Axle. C--Sweep\r\nwhich turns about the axle. D--Piston rod. E--Cross-bar. F--Ring with\r\nwhich two pipes are generally joined.]\r\n\r\nThe piston of the second pump is more easily moved up and down. When\r\nthis pump is made, two beams are placed over the sump, one near the\r\nright side of it, and the other near the left. To one beam a pipe is\r\nfixed with iron clamps; to the other is fixed either the forked branch\r\nof a tree or a timber cut out at the top in the shape of a fork, and\r\nthrough the prongs of the fork a round hole is bored. Through a wide\r\nround hole in the middle of a sweep passes an iron axle, so fastened\r\nin the holes in the fork that it remains fixed, and the sweep turns on\r\nthis axle. In one end of the sweep the upper end of a piston-rod is\r\nfastened with an iron key; at the other end a cross-bar is also fixed,\r\nto the extreme ends of which are handles to enable it to be held more\r\nfirmly in the hands. And so when the workman pulls the cross-bar upward,\r\nhe forces the piston into the pipe; when he pushes it down again he\r\ndraws the piston out of the pipe; and thus the piston carries up the\r\nwater which has been drawn in at the openings of the disc, and the water\r\nflows away through the spout into the drains. This pump, like the next\r\none, is identical with the first in all that relates to the piston,\r\ndisc, trunk, box, and valve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 179 (Suction Pumps): A--Posts. B--Axle. C--Wooden bars.\r\nD--Piston rod. E--Short piece of wood. F--Drain. G--This man is\r\ndiverting the water which is flowing out of the drain, to prevent it\r\nfrom flowing into the trenches which are being dug.]\r\n\r\nThe third pump is not unlike the one just described, but in place of one\r\nupright, posts are erected with holes at the top, and in these holes the\r\nends of an axle revolve. To the middle of this axle are fixed two wooden\r\nbars, to the end of one of which is fixed the piston, and to the end of\r\nthe other a heavy piece of wood, but short, so that it can pass between\r\nthe two posts and may move backward and forward. When the workman pushes\r\nthis piece of wood, the piston is drawn out of the pipe; when it returns\r\nby its own weight, the piston is pushed in. In this way, the water\r\nwhich the pipe contains is drawn through the openings in the disc and\r\nemptied by the piston through the spout into the drain. There are some\r\nwho place a hand-bar underneath in place of the short piece of wood.\r\nThis pump, as also the last before described, is less generally used\r\namong miners than the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 180 (Duplex suction Pumps): A--Box.

K--Leathers. L--Eyes in the axle. M--Rods whose ends are\r\nweighted with lumps of lead. N--Crank. (_This plate is unlettered in the\r\nfirst edition but corrected in those later._)]\r\n\r\nThe fourth kind is not a simple pump but a duplex one. It is made as\r\nfollows. A rectangular block of beechwood, five feet long, two and a\r\nhalf feet wide, and one and a half feet thick, is cut in two and\r\nhollowed out wide and deep enough so that an iron axle with cranks can\r\nrevolve in it. The axle is placed between the two halves of this box,\r\nand the first part of the axle, which is in contact with the wood, is\r\nround and the straight end forms a journal. Then the axle is bent down\r\nthe depth of a foot and again bent so as to continue straight, and at\r\nthis point a round piston-rod hangs from it; next it is bent up as far\r\nas it was bent down; then it continues a little way straight again, and\r\nthen it is bent up a foot and again continues straight, at which point a\r\nsecond round piston-rod is hung from it; afterward it is bent down the\r\nsame distance as it was bent up the last time; the other end of it,\r\nwhich also acts as a journal, is straight. This part which protrudes\r\nthrough the wood is protected by two iron washers in the shape of discs,\r\nto which are fastened two leather washers of the same shape and size, in\r\norder to prevent the water which is drawn into the box from gushing out.\r\nThese discs are around the axle; one of them is inside the box and the\r\nother outside. Beyond this, the end of the axle is square and has two\r\neyes, in which are fixed two iron rods, and to their ends are weighted\r\nlumps of lead, so that the axle may have a greater propensity to\r\nrevolve; this axle can easily be turned when its end has been mortised\r\nin a crank. The upper part of the box is the shallower one, and the\r\nlower part the deeper; the upper part is bored out once straight down\r\nthrough the middle, the diameter of the opening being the same as the\r\noutside diameter of the column pipe; the lower box has, side by side,\r\ntwo apertures also bored straight down; these are for two pipes, the\r\nspace of whose openings therefore is twice as great as that of the upper\r\npart; this lower part of the box is placed upon the two pipes, which are\r\nfitted into it at their upper ends, and the lower ends of these pipes\r\npenetrate into trunks which stand in the sump. These trunks have\r\nperforations through which the water flows into them. The iron axle is\r\nplaced in the inside of the box, then the two iron piston-rods which\r\nhang from it are let down through the two pipes to the depth of a foot.\r\nEach piston has a screw at its lower end which holds a thick iron plate,\r\nshaped like a disc and full of openings, covered with a leather, and\r\nsimilarly to the other pump it has a round valve in a little box. Then\r\nthe upper part of the box is placed upon the lower one and properly\r\nfitted to it on every side, and where they join they are bound by wide\r\nthick iron plates, and held with small wide iron wedges, which are\r\ndriven in and are fastened with clamps. The first length of column pipe\r\nis fixed into the upper part of the box, and another length of pipe\r\nextends it, and a third again extends this one, and so on, another\r\nextending on another, until the uppermost one reaches the drain of the\r\ntunnel. When the crank worker turns the axle, the pistons in turn draw\r\nthe water through their discs; since this is done quickly, and since the\r\narea of openings of the two pipes over which the box is set, is twice as\r\nlarge as the opening of the column pipe which rises from the box, and\r\nsince the pistons do not lift the water far up, the impetus of the water\r\nfrom the lower pipes forces it to rise and flow out of the column pipe\r\ninto the drain of the tunnel. Since a wooden box frequently cracks open,\r\nit is better to make it of lead or copper or brass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 182 (Suction Pumps): A--Tappets of piston-rods. B--Cams of\r\nthe barrel. C--Square upper parts of piston-rods. D--Lower rounded parts\r\nof piston-rods. E--Cross-beams. F--Pipes. G--Apertures of pipes.\r\nH--Trough. (Fifth kind of pump--see p. 181).]\r\n\r\nThe fifth kind of pump is still less simple, for it is composed of two\r\nor three pumps whose pistons are raised by a machine turned by men, for\r\neach piston-rod has a tappet which is raised, each in succession, by two\r\ncams on a barrel; two or four strong men turn it. When the pistons\r\ndescend into the pipes their discs draw the water; when they are raised\r\nthese force the water out through the pipes. The upper part of each of\r\nthese piston-rods, which is half a foot square, is held in a slot in a\r\ncross-beam; the lower part, which drops down into the pipes, is made of\r\nanother piece of wood and is round. Each of these three pumps is\r\ncomposed of two lengths of pipe fixed to the shaft timbers. This\r\nmachine draws the water higher, as much as twenty-four feet. If the\r\ndiameter of the pipes is large, only two pumps are made; if smaller,\r\nthree, so that by either method the volume of water is the same. This\r\nalso must be understood regarding the other machines and their pipes.\r\nSince these pumps are composed of two lengths of pipe, the little iron\r\nbox having the iron valve which I described before, is not enclosed in a\r\ntrunk, but is in the lower length of pipe, at that point where it joins\r\nthe upper one; thus the rounded part of the piston-rod is only as long\r\nas the upper length of pipe; but I will presently explain this more\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 183 (Suction Pumps): A--Water-wheel. B--Axle. C--Trunk on\r\nwhich the lowest pipe stands. D--Basket surrounding trunk. (Sixth kind\r\nof pump--see p. 184.)]\r\n\r\nThe sixth kind of pump would be just the same as the fifth were it not\r\nthat it has an axle instead of a barrel, turned not by men but by a\r\nwater-wheel, which is revolved by the force of water striking its\r\nbuckets. Since water-power far exceeds human strength, this machine\r\ndraws water through its pipes by discs out of a shaft more than one\r\nhundred feet deep. The bottom of the lowest pipe, set in the sump, not\r\nonly of this pump but also of the others, is generally enclosed in a\r\nbasket made of wicker-work, to prevent wood shavings and other things\r\nbeing sucked in. (See p. 183.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration 185 (Suction Pumps): A--shaft. B--Bottom pump. C--First\r\ntank. D--Second pump. E--Second tank. F--Third pump. G--Trough. H--The\r\niron set in the axle. I--First pump rod. K--Second pump rod. L--Third\r\npump rod. M--First piston rod. N--Second piston rod. O--Third piston\r\nrod. P--Little axles. Q--\"Claws.\"]\r\n\r\nThe seventh kind of pump, invented ten years ago, which is the most\r\ningenious, durable, and useful of all, can be made without much expense.\r\nIt is composed of several pumps, which do not, like those last\r\ndescribed, go down into the shaft together, but of which one is below\r\nthe other, for if there are three, as is generally the case, the lower\r\none lifts the water of the sump and pours it out into the first tank;\r\nthe second pump lifts again from that tank into a second tank, and the\r\nthird pump lifts it into the drain of the tunnel. A wheel fifteen feet\r\nhigh raises the piston-rods of all these pumps at the same time and\r\ncauses them to drop together. The wheel is made to revolve by paddles,\r\nturned by the force of a stream which has been diverted to the mountain.\r\nThe spokes of the water-wheel are mortised in an axle six feet long and\r\none foot thick, each end of which is surrounded by an iron band, but in\r\none end there is fixed an iron journal; to the other end is attached an\r\niron like this journal in its posterior part, which is a digit thick and\r\nas wide as the end of the axle itself. Then the iron extends\r\nhorizontally, being rounded and about three digits in diameter, for the\r\nlength of a foot, and serves as a journal; thence, it bends to a height\r\nof a foot in a curve, like the horn of the moon, after which it again\r\nextends straight out for one foot; thus it comes about that this last\r\nstraight portion, as it revolves in an orbit becomes alternately a foot\r\nhigher and a foot lower than the first straight part. From this round\r\niron crank there hangs the first flat pump-rod, for the crank is fixed\r\nin a perforation in the upper end of this flat pump-rod just as the iron\r\nkey of the first set of \"claws\" is fixed into the lower end. In order to\r\nprevent the pump-rod from slipping off it, as it could easily do, and\r\nthat it may be taken off when necessary, its opening is wider than the\r\ncorresponding part of the crank, and it is fastened on both sides by\r\niron keys. To prevent friction, the ends of the pump-rods are protected\r\nby iron plates or intervening leathers. This first pump-rod is about\r\ntwelve feet long, the other two are twenty-six feet, and each is a palm\r\nwide and three digits thick. The sides of each pump-rod are covered and\r\nprotected by iron plates, which are held on by iron screws, so that a\r\npart which has received damage can be repaired. In the \"claws\" is set a\r\nsmall round axle, a foot and a half long and two palms thick. The ends\r\nare encircled by iron bands to prevent the iron journals which revolve\r\nin the iron bearings of the wood from slipping out of it.[15] From this\r\nlittle axle the wooden \"claws\" extend two feet, with a width and\r\nthickness of six digits; they are three palms distant from each other,\r\nand both the inner and outer sides are covered with iron plates. Two\r\nrounded iron keys two digits thick are immovably fixed into the claws.\r\nThe one of these keys perforates the lower end of the first pump-rod,\r\nand the upper end of the second pump-rod which is held fast. The other\r\nkey, which is likewise immovable, perforates the iron end of the first\r\npiston-rod, which is bent in a curve and is immovable. Each such\r\npiston-rod is thirteen feet long and three digits thick, and descends\r\ninto the first pipe of each pump to such depth that its disc nearly\r\nreaches the valve-box. When it descends into the pipe, the water,\r\npenetrating through the openings of the disc, raises the leather, and\r\nwhen the piston-rod is raised the water presses down the leather, and\r\nthis supports its weight; then the valve closes the box as a door closes\r\nan entrance. The pipes are joined by two iron bands, one palm wide, one\r\noutside the other, but the inner one is sharp all round that it may fit\r\ninto each pipe and hold them together. Although at the present time\r\npipes lack the inner band, still they have nipples by which they are\r\njoined together, for the lower end of the upper one holds the upper end\r\nof the lower one, each being hewn away for a length of seven digits, the\r\nformer inside, the latter outside, so that the one can fit into the\r\nother. When the piston-rod descends into the first pipe, that valve\r\nwhich I have described is closed; when the piston-rod is raised, the\r\nvalve is opened so that the water can run in through the perforations.\r\nEach one of such pumps is composed of two lengths of pipe, each of which\r\nis twelve feet long, and the inside diameter is seven digits. The lower\r\none is placed in the sump of the shaft, or in a tank, and its lower end\r\nis blocked by a round piece of wood, above which there are six\r\nperforations around the pipe through which the water flows into it. The\r\nupper part of the upper pipe has a notch one foot deep and a palm wide,\r\nthrough which the water flows away into a tank or trough. Each tank is\r\ntwo feet long and one foot wide and deep. There is the same number of\r\naxles, \"claws,\" and rods of each kind as there are pumps; if there are\r\nthree pumps, there are only two tanks, because the sump of the shaft and\r\nthe drain of the tunnel take the place of two. The following is the way\r\nthis machine draws water from a shaft. The wheel being turned raises the\r\nfirst pump-rod, and the pump-rod raises the first \"claw,\" and thus also\r\nthe second pump-rod, and the first piston-rod; then the second pump-rod\r\nraises the second \"claw,\" and thus the third pump-rod and the second\r\npiston-rod; then the third pump-rod raises the third \"claw\" and the\r\nthird piston-rod, for there hangs no pump-rod from the iron key of\r\nthese claws, for it can be of no use in the last pump. In turn, when the\r\nfirst pump-rod descends, each set of \"claws\" is lowered, each pump-rod\r\nand each piston-rod. And by this system, at the same time the water is\r\nlifted into the tanks and drained out of them; from the sump at the\r\nbottom of the shaft it is drained out, and it is poured into the trough\r\nof the tunnel. Further, around the main axle there may be placed two\r\nwater wheels, if the river supplies enough water to turn them, and from\r\nthe back part of each round iron crank, one or two pump-rods can be\r\nhung, each of which can move the piston-rods of three pumps. Lastly, it\r\nis necessary that the shafts from which the water is pumped out in pipes\r\nshould be vertical, for as in the case of the hauling machines, all\r\npumps which have pipes do not draw the water so high if the pipes are\r\ninclined in inclined shafts, as if they are placed vertically in\r\nvertical shafts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 187 (Suction Pumps): A--Water wheel of upper machine.\r\nB--Its pump. C--Its trough. D--Wheel of lower machine. E--Its pump.\r\nF--Race.]\r\n\r\nIf the river does not supply enough water-power to turn the\r\nlast-described pump, which happens because of the nature of the locality\r\nor occurs during the summer season when there are daily droughts, a\r\nmachine is built with a wheel so low and light that the water of ever so\r\nlittle a stream can turn it. This water, falling into a race, runs\r\ntherefrom on to a second high and heavy wheel of a lower machine, whose\r\npump lifts the water out of a deep shaft. Since, however, the water of\r\nso small a stream cannot alone revolve the lower water-wheel, the axle\r\nof the latter is turned at the start with a crank worked by two men, but\r\nas soon as it has poured out into a pool the water which has been drawn\r\nup by the pumps, the upper wheel draws up this water by its own pump,\r\nand pours it into the race, from which it flows on to the lower\r\nwater-wheel and strikes its buckets. So both this water from the mine,\r\nas well as the water of the stream, being turned down the races on to\r\nthat subterranean wheel of the lower machine, turns it, and water is\r\npumped out of the deeper part of the shaft by means of two or three\r\npumps.[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 189 (Duplex suction Pumps): A--Upper axle. B--Wheel whose\r\nbuckets the force of the stream strikes. C--Toothed drum. D--Second\r\naxle. E--Drum composed of rundles. F--Curved round irons. G--Rows of\r\npumps.]\r\n\r\nIf the stream supplies enough water straightway to turn a higher and\r\nheavier water-wheel, then a toothed drum is fixed to the other end of\r\nthe axle, and this turns the drum made of rundles on another axle set\r\nbelow it. To each end of this lower axle there is fitted a crank of\r\nround iron curved like the horns of the moon, of the kind employed in\r\nmachines of this description. This machine, since it has rows of pumps\r\non each side, draws great quantities of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 191 (Rag and Chain Pumps): A--Wheel. B--Axle. C--Journals.\r\nD--Pillows. E--Drum. F--Clamps. G--Drawing-chain. H--Timbers. I--Balls.\r\nK--Pipe. L--Race of stream.]\r\n\r\nOf the rag and chain pumps there are six kinds known to us, of which the\r\nfirst is made as follows: A cave is dug under the surface of earth or in\r\na tunnel, and timbered on all sides by stout posts and planks, to\r\nprevent either the men from being crushed or the machine from being\r\nbroken by its collapse. In this cave, thus timbered, is placed a\r\nwater-wheel fitted to an angular axle. The iron journals of the axle\r\nrevolve in iron pillows, which are held in timbers of sufficient\r\nstrength. The wheel is generally twenty-four feet high, occasionally\r\nthirty, and in no way different from those which are made for grinding\r\ncorn, except that it is a little narrower. The axle has on one side a\r\ndrum with a groove in the middle of its circumference, to which are\r\nfixed many four-curved iron clamps. In these clamps catch the links of\r\nthe chain, which is drawn through the pipes out of the sump, and which\r\nagain falls, through a timbered opening, right down to the bottom into\r\nthe sump to a balancing drum. There is an iron band around the small\r\naxle of the balancing drum, each journal of which revolves in an iron\r\nbearing fixed to a timber. The chain turning about this drum brings up\r\nthe water by the balls through the pipes. Each length of pipe is\r\nencircled and protected by five iron bands, a palm wide and a digit\r\nthick, placed at equal distances from each other; the first band on the\r\npipe is shared in common with the preceding length of pipe into which it\r\nis fitted, the last band with the succeeding length of pipe which is\r\nfitted into it. Each length of pipe, except the first, is bevelled on\r\nthe outer circumference of the upper end to a distance of seven digits\r\nand for a depth of three digits, in order that it may be inserted into\r\nthe length of pipe which goes before it; each, except the last, is\r\nreamed out on the inside of the lower end to a like distance, but to the\r\ndepth of a palm, that it may be able to take the end of the pipe which\r\nfollows. And each length of pipe is fixed with iron clamps to the\r\ntimbers of the shaft, that it may remain stationary. Through this\r\ncontinuous series of pipes, the water is drawn by the balls of the chain\r\nup out of the sump as far as the tunnel, where it flows but into the\r\ndrains through an aperture in the highest pipe. The balls which lift the\r\nwater are connected by the iron links of the chain, and are six feet\r\ndistant from one another; they are made of the hair of a horse's tail\r\nsewn into a covering to prevent it from being pulled out by the iron\r\nclamps on the drum; the balls are of such size that one can be held in\r\neach hand. If this machine is set up on the surface of the earth, the\r\nstream which turns the water-wheel is led away through open-air ditches;\r\nif in a tunnel, the water is led away through the subterranean drains.\r\nThe buckets of the water-wheel, when struck by the impact of the stream,\r\nmove forward and turn the wheel, together with the drum, whereby the\r\nchain is wound up and the balls expel the water through the pipes. If\r\nthe wheel of this machine is twenty-four feet in diameter, it draws\r\nwater from a shaft two hundred and ten feet deep; if thirty feet in\r\ndiameter, it will draw water from a shaft two hundred and forty feet\r\ndeep. But such work requires a stream with greater water-power.\r\n\r\nThe next pump has two drums, two rows of pipes and two drawing-chains\r\nwhose balls lift out the water; otherwise they are like the last pump.\r\nThis pump is usually built when an excessive amount of water flows into\r\nthe sump. These two pumps are turned by water-power; indeed, water draws\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe following is the way of indicating the increase or decrease of the\r\nwater in an underground sump, whether it is pumped by this rag and chain\r\npump or by the first pump, or the third, or some other. From a beam\r\nwhich is as high above the shaft as the sump is deep, is hung a cord, to\r\none end of which there is fastened a stone, the other end being attached\r\nto a plank. The plank is lowered down by an iron wire fastened to the\r\nother end; when the stone is at the mouth of the shaft the plank is\r\nright down the shaft in the sump, in which water it floats. This plank\r\nis so heavy that it can drag down the wire and its iron clasp and hook,\r\ntogether with the cord, and thus pull the stone upwards. Thus, as the\r\nwater decreases, the plank descends and the stone is raised; on the\r\ncontrary, when the water increases the plank rises and the stone is\r\nlowered. When the stone nearly touches the beam, since this indicates\r\nthat the water has been exhausted from the sump by the pump, the\r\noverseer in charge of the machine closes the water-race and stops the\r\nwater-wheel; when the stone nearly touches the ground at the side of the\r\nshaft, this indicates that the sump is full of water which has again\r\ncollected in it, because the water raises the plank and thus the stone\r\ndrags back both the rope and the iron wire; then the overseer opens the\r\nwater-race, whereupon the water of the stream again strikes the buckets\r\nof the water-wheel and turns the pump. As workmen generally cease from\r\ntheir labours on the yearly holidays, and sometimes on working days,\r\nand are thus not always near the pump, and as the pump, if necessary,\r\nmust continue to draw water all the time, a bell rings aloud\r\ncontinuously, indicating that this pump, or any other kind, is uninjured\r\nand nothing is preventing its turning. The bell is hung by a cord from a\r\nsmall wooden axle held in the timbers which stand over the shaft, and a\r\nsecond long cord whose upper end is fastened to the small axle is\r\nlowered into the shaft; to the lower end of this cord is fastened a\r\npiece of wood; and as often as a cam on the main axle strikes it, so\r\noften does the bell ring and give forth a sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 193 (Rag and Chain Pumps): A--Upright axle. B--Toothed\r\nwheel. C--Teeth. D--Horizontal axle. E--Drum which is made of rundles.\r\nF--Second drum. G--Drawing-chain. H--The balls.]\r\n\r\nThe third pump of this kind is employed by miners when no river capable\r\nof turning a water-wheel can be diverted, and it is made as follows.\r\nThey first dig a chamber and erect strong timbers and planks to prevent\r\nthe sides from falling in, which would overwhelm the pump and kill the\r\nmen. The roof of the chamber is protected with contiguous timbers, so\r\narranged that the horses which pull the machine can travel over it. Next\r\nthey again set up sixteen beams forty feet long and one foot wide and\r\nthick, joined by clamps at the top and spreading apart at the bottom,\r\nand they fit the lower end of each beam into a separate sill laid flat\r\non the ground, and join these by a post; thus there is created a\r\ncircular area of which the diameter is fifty feet. Through an opening in\r\nthe centre of this area there descends an upright square axle,\r\nforty-five feet long and a foot and a half wide and thick; its lower\r\npivot revolves in a socket in a block laid flat on the ground in the\r\nchamber, and the upper pivot revolves in a bearing in a beam which is\r\nmortised into two beams at the summit beneath the clamps; the lower\r\npivot is seventeen feet distant from either side of the chamber, _i.e._,\r\nfrom its front and rear. At the height of a foot above its lower end,\r\nthe axle has a toothed wheel, the diameter of which is twenty-two feet.\r\nThis wheel is composed of four spokes and eight rim pieces; the spokes\r\nare fifteen feet long and three-quarters of a foot wide and thick[17];\r\none end of them is mortised in the axle, the other in the two rims where\r\nthey are joined together. These rims are three-quarters of a foot thick\r\nand one foot wide, and from them there rise and project upright teeth\r\nthree-quarters of a foot high, half a foot wide, and six digits thick.\r\nThese teeth turn a second horizontal axle by means of a drum composed of\r\ntwelve rundles, each three feet long and six digits wide and thick. This\r\ndrum, being turned, causes the axle to revolve, and around this axle\r\nthere is a drum having iron clamps with fourfold curves in which catch\r\nthe links of a chain, which draws water through pipes by means of balls.\r\nThe iron journals of this horizontal axle revolve on pillows which are\r\nset in the centre of timbers. Above the roof of the chamber there are\r\nmortised into the upright axle the ends of two beams which rise\r\nobliquely; the upper ends of these beams support double cross-beams,\r\nlikewise mortised to the axle. In the outer end of each cross-beam there\r\nis mortised a small wooden piece which appears to hang down; in this\r\nwooden piece there is similarly mortised at the lower end a short\r\nboard; this has an iron key which engages a chain, and this chain again\r\na pole-bar. This machine, which draws water from a shaft two hundred and\r\nforty feet deep, is worked by thirty-two horses; eight of them work for\r\nfour hours, and then these rest for twelve hours, and the same number\r\ntake their place. This kind of machine is employed at the foot of the\r\nHarz[18] mountains and in the neighbourhood. Further, if necessity\r\narises, several pumps of this kind are often built for the purpose of\r\nmining one vein, but arranged differently in different localities\r\nvarying according to the depth. At Schemnitz, in the Carpathian\r\nmountains, there are three pumps, of which the lowest lifts water from\r\nthe lowest sump to the first drains, through which it flows into the\r\nsecond sump; the intermediate one lifts from the second sump to the\r\nsecond drain, from which it flows into the third sump; and the upper one\r\nlifts it to the drains of the tunnel, through which it flows away. This\r\nsystem of three machines of this kind is turned by ninety-six horses;\r\nthese horses go down to the machines by an inclined shaft, which slopes\r\nand twists like a screw and gradually descends. The lowest of these\r\nmachines is set in a deep place, which is distant from the surface of\r\nthe ground 660 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 194 (Rag and Chain Pumps): A--Axle. B--Drum.\r\nC--Drawing-chain. D--Balls. E--Clamps.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth species of pump belongs to the same genera, and is made as\r\nfollows. Two timbers are erected, and in openings in them, the ends of a\r\nbarrel revolve. Two or four strong men turn the barrel, that is to say,\r\none or two pull the cranks, and one or two push them, and in this way\r\nhelp the others; alternately another two or four men take their place.\r\nThe barrel of this machine, just like the horizontal axle of the other\r\nmachines, has a drum whose iron clamps catch the links of a\r\ndrawing-chain. Thus water is drawn through the pipes by the balls from a\r\ndepth of forty-eight feet. Human strength cannot draw water higher than\r\nthis, because such very heavy labour exhausts not only men, but even\r\nhorses; only water-power can drive continuously a drum of this kind.\r\nSeveral pumps of this kind, as of the last, are often built for the\r\npurpose of mining on a single vein, but they are arranged differently\r\nfor different positions and depths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 195 (Rag and Chain Pumps): A--Axles. B--Levers. C--Toothed\r\ndrum. D--Drum made of rundles. E--Drum in which iron clamps are fixed.]\r\n\r\nThe fifth pump of this kind is partly like the third and partly like\r\nthe fourth, because it is turned by strong men like the last, and like\r\nthe third it has two axles and three drums, though each axle is\r\nhorizontal. The journals of each axle are so fitted in the pillows of\r\nthe beams that they cannot fly out; the lower axle has a crank at one\r\nend and a toothed drum at the other end; the upper axle has at one end a\r\ndrum made of rundles, and at the other end, a drum to which are fixed\r\niron clamps, in which the links of a chain catch in the same way as\r\nbefore, and from the same depth, draw water through pipes by means of\r\nballs. This revolving machine is turned by two pairs of men alternately,\r\nfor one pair stands working while the other sits taking a rest; while\r\nthey are engaged upon the task of turning, one pulls the crank and the\r\nother pushes, and the drums help to make the pump turn more easily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 197 (Rag and Chain Pumps): A--Axles. B--Wheel which is\r\nturned by treading. C--Toothed wheel. D--Drum made of rundles. E--Drum\r\nto which are fixed iron clamps. F--Second wheel. G--Balls.]\r\n\r\nThe sixth pump of this kind likewise has two axles. At one end of the\r\nlower axle is a wheel which is turned by two men treading, this is\r\ntwenty-three feet high and four feet wide, so that one man may stand\r\nalongside the other. At the other end of this axle is a toothed wheel.\r\nThe upper[19] axle has two drums and one wheel; the first drum is made\r\nof rundles, and to the other there are fixed the iron clamps. The wheel\r\nis like the one on the second machine which is chiefly used for drawing\r\nearth and broken rock out of shafts. The treaders, to prevent themselves\r\nfrom falling, grasp in their hands poles which are fixed to the inner\r\nsides of the wheel. When they turn this wheel, the toothed drum being\r\nmade to revolve, sets in motion the other drum which is made of rundles,\r\nby which means again the links of the chain catch to the cleats of the\r\nthird drum and draw water through pipes by means of balls,--from a depth\r\nof sixty-six feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 199 (Baling Water): A--Reservoir.

P, Q--Men emptying bags.]\r\n\r\nBut the largest machine of all those which draw water is the one which\r\nfollows. First of all a reservoir is made in a timbered chamber; this\r\nreservoir is eighteen feet long and twelve feet wide and high. Into this\r\nreservoir a stream is diverted through a water-race or through the\r\ntunnel; it has two entrances and the same number of gates. Levers are\r\nfixed to the upper part of these gates, by which they can be raised and\r\nlet down again, so that by one way the gates are opened and in the other\r\nway closed. Beneath the openings are two plank troughs which carry the\r\nwater flowing from the reservoir, and pour it on to the buckets of the\r\nwater-wheel, the impact of which turns the wheel. The shorter trough\r\ncarries the water, which strikes the buckets that turn the wheel toward\r\nthe reservoir, and the longer trough carries the water which strikes\r\nthose buckets that turn the wheel in the opposite direction. The casing\r\nor covering of the wheel is made of joined boards to which strips are\r\naffixed on the inner side. The wheel itself is thirty-six feet in\r\ndiameter, and is mortised to an axle, and it has, as I have already\r\nsaid, two rows of buckets, of which one is set the opposite way to the\r\nother, so that the wheel may be turned toward the reservoir or in the\r\nopposite direction. The axle is square and is thirty-five feet long\r\nand two feet thick and wide. Beyond the wheel, at a distance of six\r\nfeet, the axle has four hubs, one foot wide and thick, each one of which\r\nis four feet distant from the next; to these hubs are fixed by iron\r\nnails as many pieces of wood as are necessary to cover the hubs, and, in\r\norder that the wood pieces may fit tight, they are broader on the\r\noutside and narrower on the inside; in this way a drum is made, around\r\nwhich is wound a chain to whose ends are hooked leather bags. The reason\r\nwhy a drum of this kind is made, is that the axle may be kept in good\r\ncondition, because this drum when it becomes worn away by use can be\r\nrepaired easily. Further along the axle, not far from the end, is\r\nanother drum one foot broad, projecting two feet on all sides around the\r\naxle. And to this, when occasion demands, a brake is applied forcibly\r\nand holds back the machine; this kind of brake I have explained before.\r\nNear the axle, in place of a hopper, there is a floor with a\r\nconsiderable slope, having in front of the shaft a width of fifteen feet\r\nand the same at the back; at each side of it there is a stout post\r\ncarrying an iron chain which has a large hook. Five men operate this\r\nmachine; one lets down the doors which close the reservoir gates, or by\r\ndrawing down the levers, opens the water-races; this man, who is the\r\ndirector of this machine, stands in a hanging cage beside the reservoir.\r\nWhen one bag has been drawn out nearly as far as the sloping floor, he\r\ncloses the water gate in order that the wheel may be stopped; when the\r\nbag has been emptied he opens the other water gate, in order that the\r\nother set of buckets may receive the water and drive the wheel in the\r\nopposite direction. If he cannot close the water-gate quickly enough,\r\nand the water continues to flow, he calls out to his comrade and bids\r\nhim raise the brake upon the drum and stop the wheel. Two men\r\nalternately empty the bags, one standing on that part of the floor which\r\nis in front of the shaft, and the other on that part which is at the\r\nback. When the bag has been nearly drawn up--of which fact a certain\r\nlink of the chain gives warning--the man who stands on the one part of\r\nthe floor, catches a large iron hook in one link of the chain, and pulls\r\nout all the subsequent part of the chain toward the floor, where the bag\r\nis emptied by the other man. The object of this hook is to prevent the\r\nchain, by its own weight, from pulling down the other empty bag, and\r\nthus pulling the whole chain from its axle and dropping it down the\r\nshaft. His comrade in the work, seeing that the bag filled with water\r\nhas been nearly drawn out, calls to the director of the machine and bids\r\nhim close the water of the tower so that there will be time to empty the\r\nbag; this being emptied, the director of the machine first of all\r\nslightly opens the other water-gate of the tower to allow the end of the\r\nchain, together with the empty bag, to be started into the shaft again,\r\nand then opens entirely the water-gates. When that part of the chain\r\nwhich has been pulled on to the floor has been wound up again, and has\r\nbeen let down over the shaft from the drum, he takes out the large hook\r\nwhich was fastened into a link of the chain. The fifth man stands in a\r\nsort of cross-cut beside the sump, that he may not be hurt, if it should\r\nhappen that a link is broken and part of the chain or anything else\r\nshould fall down; he guides the bag with a wooden shovel, and fills it\r\nwith water if it fails to take in the water spontaneously. In these\r\ndays, they sew an iron band into the top of each bag that it may\r\nconstantly remain open, and when lowered into the sump may fill itself\r\nwith water, and there is no need for a man to act as governor of the\r\nbags. Further, in these days, of those men who stand on the floor the\r\none empties the bags, and the other closes the gates of the reservoir\r\nand opens them again, and the same man usually fixes the large hook in\r\nthe link of the chain. In this way, three men only are employed in\r\nworking this machine; or even--since sometimes the one who empties the\r\nbag presses the brake which is raised against the other drum and thus\r\nstops the wheel--two men take upon themselves the whole labour.\r\n\r\nBut enough of haulage machines; I will now speak of ventilating\r\nmachines. If a shaft is very deep and no tunnel reaches to it, or no\r\ndrift from another shaft connects with it, or when a tunnel is of great\r\nlength and no shaft reaches to it, then the air does not replenish\r\nitself. In such a case it weighs heavily on the miners, causing them to\r\nbreathe with difficulty, and sometimes they are even suffocated, and\r\nburning lamps are also extinguished. There is, therefore, a necessity\r\nfor machines which the Greeks call [Greek: pneumatikai] and the Latins\r\n_spiritales_--though they do not give forth any sound--which enable the\r\nminers to breathe easily and carry on their work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 201 (Windsails for Ventilation): A--Sills. B--Pointed\r\nstakes. C--Cross-beams. D--Upright planks. E--Hollows. F--Winds.\r\nG--Covering disc. H--Shafts. I--Machine without a covering.]\r\n\r\nThese devices are of three genera. The first receives and diverts into\r\nthe shaft the blowing of the wind, and this genus is divided into three\r\nspecies, of which the first is as follows. Over the shaft--to which no\r\ntunnel connects--are placed three sills a little longer than the shaft,\r\nthe first over the front, the second over the middle, and the third over\r\nthe back of the shaft. Their ends have openings, through which pegs,\r\nsharpened at the bottom, are driven deeply into the ground so as to hold\r\nthem immovable, in the same way that the sills of the windlass are\r\nfixed. Each of these sills is mortised into each of three cross-beams,\r\nof which one is at the right side of the shaft, the second at the left,\r\nand the third in the middle. To the second sill and the second\r\ncross-beam--each of which is placed over the middle of the shaft--planks\r\nare fixed which are joined in such a manner that the one which precedes\r\nalways fits into the groove of the one which follows. In this way four\r\nangles and the same number of intervening hollows are created, which\r\ncollect the winds that blow from all directions. The planks are roofed\r\nabove with a cover made in a circular shape, and are open below, in\r\norder that the wind may not be diverted upward and escape, but may be\r\ncarried downward; and thereby the winds of necessity blow into the\r\nshafts through these four openings. However, there is no need to roof\r\nthis kind of machine in those localities in which it can be so placed\r\nthat the wind can blow down through its topmost part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 202 (Windsails for Ventilation): A--Projecting mouth of\r\nconduit. B--Planks fixed to the mouth of the conduit which does not\r\nproject.]\r\n\r\nThe second machine of this genus turns the blowing wind into a shaft\r\nthrough a long box-shaped conduit, which is made of as many lengths of\r\nplanks, joined together, as the depth of the shaft requires; the joints\r\nare smeared with fat, glutinous clay moistened with water. The mouth of\r\nthis conduit either projects out of the shaft to a height of three or\r\nfour feet, or it does not project; if it projects, it is shaped like a\r\nrectangular funnel, broader and wider at the top than the conduit\r\nitself, that it may the more easily gather the wind; if it does not\r\nproject, it is not broader than the conduit, but planks are fixed to it\r\naway from the direction in which the wind is blowing, which catch the\r\nwind and force it into the conduit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 203 (Windsails for Ventilation): A--Wooden barrels.\r\nB--Hoops. C--Blow-holes. D--Pipe. E--Table. F--Axle. G--Opening in the\r\nbottom of the barrel. H--Wing.]\r\n\r\nThe third of this genus of machine is made of a pipe or pipes and a\r\nbarrel. Above the uppermost pipe there is erected a wooden barrel, four\r\nfeet high and three feet in diameter, bound with wooden hoops; it has a\r\nsquare blow-hole always open, which catches the breezes and guides them\r\ndown either by a pipe into a conduit or by many pipes into the shaft. To\r\nthe top of the upper pipe is attached a circular table as thick as the\r\nbottom of the barrel, but of a little less diameter, so that the barrel\r\nmay be turned around on it; the pipe projects out of the table and is\r\nfixed in a round opening in the centre of the bottom of the barrel. To\r\nthe end of the pipe a perpendicular axle is fixed which runs through the\r\ncentre of the barrel into a hole in the cover, in which it is fastened,\r\nin the same way as at the bottom. Around this fixed axle and the table\r\non the pipe, the movable barrel is easily turned by a zephyr, or much\r\nmore by a wind, which govern the wing on it. This wing is made of thin\r\nboards and fixed to the upper part of the barrel on the side furthest\r\naway from the blow-hole; this, as I have said, is square and always\r\nopen. The wind, from whatever quarter of the world it blows, drives the\r\nwing straight toward the opposite direction, in which way the barrel\r\nturns the blow-hole towards the wind itself; the blow-hole receives the\r\nwind, and it is guided down into the shaft by means of the conduit or\r\npipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 204 (Ventilation Fans): A--Drum. B--Box-shaped casing.\r\nC--Blow-hole. D--Second hole. E--Conduit. F--Axle. G--Lever of axle.\r\nH--Rods.]\r\n\r\nThe second genus of blowing machine is made with fans, and is likewise\r\nvaried and of many forms, for the fans are either fitted to a windlass\r\nbarrel or to an axle. If to an axle, they are either contained in a\r\nhollow drum, which is made of two wheels and a number of boards joining\r\nthem together, or else in a box-shaped casing. The drum is stationary\r\nand closed on the sides, except for round holes of such size that the\r\naxle may turn in them; it has two square blow-holes, of which the upper\r\none receives the air, while the lower one empties into the conduit\r\nthrough which the air is led down the shaft. The ends of the axle, which\r\nproject on each side of the drum, are supported by forked posts or\r\nhollowed beams plated with thick iron; one end of the axle has a crank,\r\nwhile in the other end are fixed four rods with thick heavy ends, so\r\nthat they weight the axle, and when turned, make it prone to motion as\r\nit revolves. And so, when the workman turns the axle by the crank, the\r\nfans, the description of which I will give a little later, draw in the\r\nair by the blow-hole, and force it through the other blow-hole which\r\nleads to the conduit, and through this conduit the air penetrates into\r\nthe shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 205 (Ventilation Fans): A--Box-shaped casing placed on the\r\nground. B--Its blow-hole. C--Its axle with fans. D--Crank of the axle.\r\nE--Rods of same. F--Casing set on timbers. G--Sails which the axle has\r\noutside the casing.]\r\n\r\nThe one with the box-shaped casing is furnished with just the same\r\nthings as the drum, but the drum is far superior to the box; for the\r\nfans so fill the drum that they almost touch it on every side, and drive\r\ninto the conduit all the air that has been accumulated; but they cannot\r\nthus fill the box-shaped casing, on account of its angles, into which\r\nthe air partly retreats; therefore it cannot be as useful as the drum.\r\nThe kind with a box-shaped casing is not only placed on the ground, but\r\nis also set up on timbers like a windmill, and its axle, in place of a\r\ncrank, has four sails outside, like the sails of a windmill. When these\r\nare struck by the wind they turn the axle, and in this way its\r\nfans--which are placed within the casing--drive the air through the\r\nblow-hole and the conduit into the shaft. Although this machine has no\r\nneed of men whom it is necessary to pay to work the crank, still when\r\nthe sky is devoid of wind, as it often is, the machine does not turn,\r\nand it is therefore less suitable than the others for ventilating a\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 206 (Ventilation Fans): A--Hollow drum. B--Its blow-hole.\r\nC--Axle with fans. D--Drum which is made of rundles. E--Lower axle.\r\nF--Its toothed wheel. G--Water wheel.]\r\n\r\nIn the kind where the fans are fixed to an axle, there is generally a\r\nhollow stationary drum at one end of the axle, and on the other end is\r\nfixed a drum made of rundles. This rundle drum is turned by the toothed\r\nwheel of a lower axle, which is itself turned by a wheel whose buckets\r\nreceive the impetus of water. If the locality supplies an abundance of\r\nwater this machine is most useful, because to turn the crank does not\r\nneed men who require pay, and because it forces air without cessation\r\nthrough the conduit into the shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 207 (Ventilation Fans): A--First kind of fan. B--Second\r\nkind of fan. C--Third kind of fan. D--Quadrangular part of axle.\r\nE--Round part of same. F--Crank.]\r\n\r\nOf the fans which are fixed on to an axle contained in a drum or box,\r\nthere are three sorts. The first sort is made of thin boards of such\r\nlength and width as the height and width of the drum or box require; the\r\nsecond sort is made of boards of the same width, but shorter, to which\r\nare bound long thin blades of poplar or some other flexible wood; the\r\nthird sort has boards like the last, to which are bound double and\r\ntriple rows of goose feathers. This last is less used than the second,\r\nwhich in turn is less used than the first. The boards of the fan are\r\nmortised into the quadrangular parts of the barrel axle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 208 (Bellows for mine ventilation): A--Smaller part of\r\nshaft. B--Square conduit. C--Bellows. D--Larger part of shaft.]\r\n\r\nBlowing machines of the third genus, which are no less varied and of no\r\nfewer forms than those of the second genus, are made with bellows, for\r\nby its blasts the shafts and tunnels are not only furnished with air\r\nthrough conduits or pipes, but they can also be cleared by suction of\r\ntheir heavy and pestilential vapours. In the latter case, when the\r\nbellows is opened it draws the vapours from the conduits through its\r\nblow-hole and sucks these vapours into itself; in the former case, when\r\nit is compressed, it drives the air through its nozzle into the conduits\r\nor pipes. They are compressed either by a man, or by a horse or by\r\nwater-power; if by a man, the lower board of a large bellows is fixed to\r\nthe timbers above the conduit which projects out of the shaft, and so\r\nplaced that when the blast is blown through the conduit, its nozzle is\r\nset in the conduit. When it is desired to suck out heavy or pestilential\r\nvapours, the blow-hole of the bellows is fitted all round the mouth of\r\nthe conduit. Fixed to the upper bellows board is a lever which couples\r\nwith another running downward from a little axle, into which it is\r\nmortised so that it may remain immovable; the iron journals of this\r\nlittle axle revolve in openings of upright posts; and so when the\r\nworkman pulls down the lever the upper board of the bellows is raised,\r\nand at the same time the flap of the blow-hole is dragged open by the\r\nforce of the wind. If the nozzle of the bellows is enclosed in the\r\nconduit it draws pure air into itself, but if its blow-hole is fitted\r\nall round the mouth of the conduit it exhausts the heavy and\r\npestilential vapours out of the conduit and thus from the shaft, even if\r\nit is one hundred and twenty feet deep. A stone placed on the upper\r\nboard of the bellows depresses it and then the flap of the blow-hole is\r\nclosed. The bellows, by the first method, blows fresh air into the\r\nconduit through its nozzle, and by the second method blows out through\r\nthe nozzle the heavy and pestilential vapours which have been collected.\r\nIn this latter case fresh air enters through the larger part of the\r\nshaft, and the miners getting the benefit of it can sustain their toil.\r\nA certain smaller part of the shaft which forms a kind of estuary,\r\nrequires to be partitioned off from the other larger part by\r\nuninterrupted lagging, which reaches from the top of the shaft to the\r\nbottom; through this part the long but narrow conduit reaches down\r\nnearly to the bottom of the shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 209 (Bellows for mine ventilation): A--Tunnel. B--Pipe.\r\nC--Nozzle of double bellows.]\r\n\r\nWhen no shaft has been sunk to such depth as to meet a tunnel driven far\r\ninto a mountain, these machines should be built in such a manner that\r\nthe workman can move them about. Close by the drains of the tunnel\r\nthrough which the water flows away, wooden pipes should be placed and\r\njoined tightly together in such a manner that they can hold the air;\r\nthese should reach from the mouth of the tunnel to its furthest end. At\r\nthe mouth of the tunnel the bellows should be so placed that through its\r\nnozzle it can blow its accumulated blasts into the pipes or the conduit;\r\nsince one blast always drives forward another, they penetrate into the\r\ntunnel and change the air, whereby the miners are enabled to continue\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 211 (Bellows for mine ventilation): A--Machine first\r\ndescribed.

R--Its drum which is made of rundles.]\r\n\r\nIf heavy vapours need to be drawn off from the tunnels, generally three\r\ndouble or triple bellows, without nozzles and closed in the forepart,\r\nare placed upon benches. A workman compresses them by treading with his\r\nfeet, just as persons compress those bellows of the organs which give\r\nout varied and sweet sounds in churches. These heavy vapours are thus\r\ndrawn along the air-pipes and through the blow-hole of the lower bellows\r\nboard, and are expelled through the blow-hole of the upper bellows board\r\ninto the open air, or into some shaft or drift. This blow-hole has a\r\nflap-valve, which the noxious blast opens, as often as it passes out.\r\nSince one volume of air constantly rushes in to take the place of\r\nanother which has been drawn out by the bellows, not only is the heavy\r\nair drawn out of a tunnel as great as 1,200 feet long, or even longer,\r\nbut also the wholesome air is naturally drawn in through that part of\r\nthe tunnel which is open outside the conduits. In this way the air is\r\nchanged, and the miners are enabled to carry on the work they have\r\nbegun. If machines of this kind had not been invented, it would be\r\nnecessary for miners to drive two tunnels into a mountain, and\r\ncontinually, at every two hundred feet at most, to sink a shaft from the\r\nupper tunnel to the lower one, that the air passing into the one, and\r\ndescending by the shafts into the other, would be kept fresh for the\r\nminers; this could not be done without great expense.\r\n\r\nThere are two different machines for operating, by means of horses, the\r\nabove described bellows. The first of these machines has on its axle a\r\nwooden wheel, the rim of which is covered all the way round by steps; a\r\nhorse is kept continually within bars, like those within which horses\r\nare held to be shod with iron, and by treading these steps with its feet\r\nit turns the wheel, together with the axle; the cams on the axle press\r\ndown the sweeps which compress the bellows. The way the instrument is\r\nmade which raises the bellows again, and also the benches on which the\r\nbellows rest, I will explain more clearly in Book IX. Each bellows, if\r\nit draws heavy vapours out of a tunnel, blows them out of the hole in\r\nthe upper board; if they are drawn out of a shaft, it blows them out\r\nthrough its nozzle. The wheel has a round hole, which is transfixed with\r\na pole when the machine needs to be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe second machine has two axles; the upright one is turned by a horse,\r\nand its toothed drum turns a drum made of rundles on a horizontal axle;\r\nin other respects this machine is like the last. Here, also, the nozzles\r\nof the bellows placed in the conduits blow a blast into the shaft or\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 212 (Ventilating with Damp Cloth): A--Tunnel. B--Linen\r\ncloth.]\r\n\r\nIn the same way that this last machine can refresh the heavy air of a\r\nshaft or tunnel, so also could the old system of ventilating by the\r\nconstant shaking of linen cloths, which Pliny[20] has explained; the air\r\nnot only grows heavier with the depth of a shaft, of which fact he has\r\nmade mention, but also with the length of a tunnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 213 (Descent into Mines): A--Descending into the shaft by\r\nladders. B--By sitting on a stick. C--By sitting on the dirt.\r\nD--Descending by steps cut in the rock.]\r\n\r\nThe climbing machines of miners are ladders, fixed to one side of the\r\nshaft, and these reach either to the tunnel or to the bottom of the\r\nshaft. I need not describe how they are made, because they are used\r\neverywhere, and need not so much skill in their construction as care in\r\nfixing them. However, miners go down into mines not only by the steps of\r\nladders, but they are also lowered into them while sitting on a stick or\r\na wicker basket, fastened to the rope of one of the three drawing\r\nmachines which I described at first. Further, when the shafts are much\r\ninclined, miners and other workmen sit in the dirt which surrounds their\r\nloins and slide down in the same way that boys do in winter-time when\r\nthe water on some hillside has congealed with the cold, and to prevent\r\nthemselves from falling, one arm is wound about a rope, the upper end of\r\nwhich is fastened to a beam at the mouth of the shaft, and the lower end\r\nto a stake fixed in the bottom of the shaft. In these three ways miners\r\ndescend into the shafts. A fourth way may be mentioned which is employed\r\nwhen men and horses go down to the underground machines and come up\r\nagain, that is by inclined shafts which are twisted like a screw and\r\nhave steps cut in the rock, as I have already described.\r\n\r\nIt remains for me to speak of the ailments and accidents of miners, and\r\nof the methods by which they can guard against these, for we should\r\nalways devote more care to maintaining our health, that we may freely\r\nperform our bodily functions, than to making profits. Of the illnesses,\r\nsome affect the joints, others attack the lungs, some the eyes, and\r\nfinally some are fatal to men.\r\n\r\nWhere water in shafts is abundant and very cold, it frequently injures\r\nthe limbs, for cold is harmful to the sinews. To meet this, miners\r\nshould make themselves sufficiently high boots of rawhide, which protect\r\ntheir legs from the cold water; the man who does not follow this advice\r\nwill suffer much ill-health, especially when he reaches old age. On the\r\nother hand, some mines are so dry that they are entirely devoid of\r\nwater, and this dryness causes the workmen even greater harm, for the\r\ndust which is stirred and beaten up by digging penetrates into the\r\nwindpipe and lungs, and produces difficulty in breathing, and the\r\ndisease which the Greeks call [Greek: asthma]. If the dust has corrosive\r\nqualities, it eats away the lungs, and implants consumption in the body;\r\nhence in the mines of the Carpathian Mountains women are found who have\r\nmarried seven husbands, all of whom this terrible consumption has\r\ncarried off to a premature death. At Altenberg in Meissen there is found\r\nin the mines black _pompholyx_, which eats wounds and ulcers to the\r\nbone; this also corrodes iron, for which reason the keys of their sheds\r\nare made of wood. Further, there is a certain kind of _cadmia_[21] which\r\neats away the feet of the workmen when they have become wet, and\r\nsimilarly their hands, and injures their lungs and eyes. Therefore, for\r\ntheir digging they should make for themselves not only boots of\r\nrawhide, but gloves long enough to reach to the elbow, and they should\r\nfasten loose veils over their faces; the dust will then neither be drawn\r\nthrough these into their windpipes and lungs, nor will it fly into their\r\neyes. Not dissimilarly, among the Romans[22] the makers of vermilion\r\ntook precautions against breathing its fatal dust.\r\n\r\nStagnant air, both that which remains in a shaft and that which remains\r\nin a tunnel, produces a difficulty in breathing; the remedies for this\r\nevil are the ventilating machines which I have explained above. There is\r\nanother illness even more destructive, which soon brings death to men\r\nwho work in those shafts or levels or tunnels in which the hard rock is\r\nbroken by fire. Here the air is infected with poison, since large and\r\nsmall veins and seams in the rocks exhale some subtle poison from the\r\nminerals, which is driven out by the fire, and this poison itself is\r\nraised with the smoke not unlike _pompholyx_,[23] which clings to the\r\nupper part of the walls in the works in which ore is smelted. If this\r\npoison cannot escape from the ground, but falls down into the pools and\r\nfloats on their surface, it often causes danger, for if at any time the\r\nwater is disturbed through a stone or anything else, these fumes rise\r\nagain from the pools and thus overcome the men, by being drawn in with\r\ntheir breath; this is even much worse if the fumes of the fire have not\r\nyet all escaped. The bodies of living creatures who are infected with\r\nthis poison generally swell immediately and lose all movement and\r\nfeeling, and they die without pain; men even in the act of climbing from\r\nthe shafts by the steps of ladders fall back into the shafts when the\r\npoison overtakes them, because their hands do not perform their office,\r\nand seem to them to be round and spherical, and likewise their feet. If\r\nby good fortune the injured ones escape these evils, for a little while\r\nthey are pale and look like dead men. At such times, no one should\r\ndescend into the mine or into the neighbouring mines, or if he is in\r\nthem he should come out quickly. Prudent and skilled miners burn the\r\npiles of wood on Friday, towards evening, and they do not descend into\r\nthe shafts nor enter the tunnels again before Monday, and in the\r\nmeantime the poisonous fumes pass away.\r\n\r\nThere are also times when a reckoning has to be made with Orcus,[24] for\r\nsome metalliferous localities, though such are rare, spontaneously\r\nproduce poison and exhale pestilential vapour, as is also the case with\r\nsome openings in the ore, though these more often contain the noxious\r\nfumes. In the towns of the plains of Bohemia there are some caverns\r\nwhich, at certain seasons of the year, emit pungent vapours which put\r\nout lights and kill the miners if they linger too long in them. Pliny,\r\ntoo, has left a record that when wells are sunk, the sulphurous or\r\naluminous vapours which arise kill the well-diggers, and it is a test of\r\nthis danger if a burning lamp which has been let down is extinguished.\r\nIn such cases a second well is dug to the right or left, as an\r\nair-shaft, which draws off these noxious vapours. On the plains they\r\nconstruct bellows which draw up these noxious vapours and remedy this\r\nevil; these I have described before.\r\n\r\nFurther, sometimes workmen slipping from the ladders into the shafts\r\nbreak their arms, legs, or necks, or fall into the sumps and are\r\ndrowned; often, indeed, the negligence of the foreman is to blame, for\r\nit is his special work both to fix the ladders so firmly to the timbers\r\nthat they cannot break away, and to cover so securely with planks the\r\nsumps at the bottom of the shafts, that the planks cannot be moved nor\r\nthe men fall into the water; wherefore the foreman must carefully\r\nexecute his own work. Moreover, he must not set the entrance of the\r\nshaft-house toward the north wind, lest in winter the ladders freeze\r\nwith cold, for when this happens the men's hands become stiff and\r\nslippery with cold, and cannot perform their office of holding. The men,\r\ntoo, must be careful that, even if none of these things happen, they do\r\nnot fall through their own carelessness.\r\n\r\nMountains, too, slide down and men are crushed in their fall and perish.\r\nIn fact, when in olden days Rammelsberg, in Goslar, sank down, so many\r\nmen were crushed in the ruins that in one day, the records tell us,\r\nabout 400 women were robbed of their husbands. And eleven years ago,\r\npart of the mountain of Altenberg, which had been excavated, became\r\nloose and sank, and suddenly crushed six miners; it also swallowed up a\r\nhut and one mother and her little boy. But this generally occurs in\r\nthose mountains which contain _venae cumulatae_. Therefore, miners\r\nshould leave numerous arches under the mountains which need support, or\r\nprovide underpinning. Falling pieces of rock also injure their limbs,\r\nand to prevent this from happening, miners should protect the shafts,\r\ntunnels, and drifts.\r\n\r\nThe venomous ant which exists in Sardinia is not found in our mines.\r\nThis animal is, as Solinus[25] writes, very small and like a spider in\r\nshape; it is called _solifuga_, because it shuns (_fugit_) the light\r\n(_solem_). It is very common in silver mines; it creeps unobserved and\r\nbrings destruction upon those who imprudently sit on it. But, as the\r\nsame writer tells us, springs of warm and salubrious waters gush out in\r\ncertain places, which neutralise the venom inserted by the ants.\r\n\r\nIn some of our mines, however, though in very few, there are other\r\npernicious pests. These are demons of ferocious aspect, about which I\r\nhave spoken in my book _De Animantibus Subterraneis_. Demons of this\r\nkind are expelled and put to flight by prayer and fasting.[26]\r\n\r\nSome of these evils, as well as certain other things, are the reason why\r\npits are occasionally abandoned. But the first and principal cause is\r\nthat they do not yield metal, or if, for some fathoms, they do bear\r\nmetal they become barren in depth. The second cause is the quantity of\r\nwater which flows in; sometimes the miners can neither divert this water\r\ninto the tunnels, since tunnels cannot be driven so far into the\r\nmountains, or they cannot draw it out with machines because the shafts\r\nare too deep; or if they could draw it out with machines, they do not\r\nuse them, the reason undoubtedly being that the expenditure is greater\r\nthan the profits of a moderately poor vein. The third cause is the\r\nnoxious air, which the owners sometimes cannot overcome either by skill\r\nor expenditure, for which reason the digging is sometimes abandoned, not\r\nonly of shafts, but also of tunnels. The fourth cause is the poison\r\nproduced in particular places, if it is not in our power either\r\ncompletely to remove it or to moderate its effects. This is the reason\r\nwhy the caverns in the Plain known as Laurentius[27] used not to be\r\nworked, though they were not deficient in silver. The fifth cause are\r\nthe fierce and murderous demons, for if they cannot be expelled, no one\r\nescapes from them. The sixth cause is that the underpinnings become\r\nloosened and collapse, and a fall of the mountain usually follows; the\r\nunderpinnings are then only restored when the vein is very rich in\r\nmetal. The seventh cause is military operations. Shafts and tunnels\r\nshould not be re-opened unless we are quite certain of the reasons why\r\nthe miners have deserted them, because we ought not to believe that our\r\nancestors were so indolent and spiritless as to desert mines which could\r\nhave been carried on with profit. Indeed, in our own days, not a few\r\nminers, persuaded by old women's tales, have re-opened deserted shafts\r\nand lost their time and trouble. Therefore, to prevent future\r\ngenerations from being led to act in such a way, it is advisable to set\r\ndown in writing the reason why the digging of each shaft or tunnel has\r\nbeen abandoned, just as it is agreed was once done at Freiberg, when the\r\nshafts were deserted on account of the great inrush of water.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This Book is devoted in the main to winding, ventilating, and\r\npumping machinery. Their mechanical principles are very old. The block\r\nand pulley, the windlass, the use of water-wheels, the transmission of\r\npower through shafts and gear-wheels, chain-pumps, piston-pumps with\r\nvalves, were all known to the Greeks and Romans, and possibly earlier.\r\nMachines involving these principles were described by Ctesibius, an\r\nAlexandrian of 250 B.C., by Archimedes (287-212 B.C.), and by Vitruvius\r\n(1st Century B.C.) As to how far these machines were applied to mining\r\nby the Ancients we have but little evidence, and this largely in\r\nconnection with handling water. Diodorus Siculus (1st Century B.C.)\r\nreferring to the Spanish mines, says (Book V.): \"Sometimes at great\r\ndepths they meet great rivers underground, but by art give check to the\r\nviolence of the streams, for by cutting trenches they divert the\r\ncurrent, and being sure to gain what they aim at when they have begun,\r\nthey never leave off till they have finished it. And they admirably pump\r\nout the water with those instruments called Egyptian pumps, invented by\r\nArchimedes, the Syracusan, when he was in Egypt. By these, with constant\r\npumping by turns they throw up the water to the mouth of the pit and\r\nthus drain the mine; for this engine is so ingeniously contrived that a\r\nvast quantity of water is strangely and with little labour cast out.\"\r\n\r\nStrabo (63 B.C.-24 A.D., III., 2, 9), also referring to Spanish mines,\r\nquoting from Posidonius (about 100 B.C.), says: \"He compares with these\r\n(the Athenians) the activity and diligence of the Turdetani, who are in\r\nthe habit of cutting tortuous and deep tunnels, and draining the streams\r\nwhich they frequently encounter by means of Egyptian screws.\"\r\n(Hamilton's Tran., Vol. I., p. 221). The \"Egyptian screw\" was\r\nArchimedes' screw, and was thus called because much used by the\r\nEgyptians for irrigation. Pliny (XXXIII., 31) also says, in speaking of\r\nthe Spanish silver-lead mines: \"The mountain has been excavated for a\r\ndistance of 1,500 paces, and along this distance there are\r\nwater-carriers standing by torch-light night and day steadily baling the\r\nwater (thus) making quite a river.\" The re-opening of the mines at Rio\r\nTinto in the middle of the 18th Century disclosed old Roman stopes, in\r\nwhich were found several water-wheels. These were about 15 feet in\r\ndiameter, lifting the water by the reverse arrangement to an overshot\r\nwater-wheel. A wooden Archimedian screw was also found in the\r\nneighbourhood. (Nash, The Rio Tinto Mine, its History and Romance,\r\nLondon, 1904).\r\n\r\nUntil early in the 18th Century, water formed the limiting factor in the\r\ndepth of mines. To the great devotion to this water problem we owe the\r\ninvention of the steam engine. In 1705 Newcomen--no doubt inspired by\r\nSavery's unsuccessful attempt--invented his engine, and installed the\r\nfirst one on a colliery at Wolverhampton, in Staffordshire. With its\r\nsuccess, a new era was opened to the miner, to be yet further extended\r\nby Watt's improvements sixty years later. It should be a matter of\r\nsatisfaction to mining engineers that not only was the steam engine the\r\nhandiwork of their profession, but that another mining engineer,\r\nStephenson, in his effort to further the advance of his calling,\r\ninvented the locomotive.\r\n\r\n[2] While these particular tools serve the same purpose as the \"gad\" and\r\nthe \"moil,\" the latter are not fitted with handles, and we have,\r\ntherefore, not felt justified in adopting these terms, but have given a\r\nliteral rendering of the Latin.\r\n\r\nThe Latin and old German terms for these tools were:--\r\n\r\n  First Iron tool = _Ferramentum primum_    = _Bergeisen_.\r\n  Second   \"      =      \"      _secundum_  = _Rutzeisen_.\r\n  Third    \"      =      \"      _tertium_   = _Sumpffeisen_.\r\n  Fourth   \"      =      \"      _quartum_   = _Fimmel_.\r\n  Wedge           = _Cuneus_                = _Keil_.\r\n  Iron block      = _Lamina_                = _Plotz_.\r\n  Iron plate      = _Bractea_               = _Feder_.\r\n\r\nThe German words obviously had local value and do not bear translation\r\nliterally.\r\n\r\n[3] One _metreta_, a Greek measure, equalled about nine English gallons,\r\nand a _congius_ contained about six pints.\r\n\r\n[4] _Ingestores_. This is a case of Agricola coining a name for workmen\r\nfrom the work, the term being derived from _ingero_, to pour or to throw\r\nin, used in the previous clause--hence the \"reason.\" See p. xxxi.\r\n\r\n[5] _Cisium_. A two-wheeled cart. In the preface Agricola gives this as\r\nan example of his intended adaptations. See p. xxxi.\r\n\r\n[6] _Canis_. The Germans in Agricola's time called a truck a _hundt_--a\r\nhound.\r\n\r\n[7] _Alveus_,--\"Tray.\" The Spanish term _batea_ has been so generally\r\nadopted into the mining vocabulary for a wooden bowl for these purposes,\r\nthat we introduce it here.\r\n\r\n[8] Pliny (XXXIII., 21). \"The fragments are carried on workmen's\r\nshoulders; night and day each passes the material to his neighbour, only\r\nthe last of them seeing the daylight.\"\r\n\r\n[10] _Harpago_,--A \"grapple\" or \"hook.\"\r\n\r\n[11] Ancient Noricum covered the region of modern Tyrol, with parts of\r\nBavaria, Salzburg, etc.\r\n\r\n[12] _Machina quae pilis aquas haurit_. \"Machine which draws water with\r\nballs.\" This apparatus is identical with the Cornish \"rag and chain\r\npump\" of the same period, and we have therefore adopted that term.\r\n\r\n[13] A _congius_ contained about six pints.\r\n\r\n[14] Vitruvius (X., 9). \"But if the water is to be supplied to still\r\nhigher places, a double chain of iron is made to revolve on the axis of\r\nthe wheel, long enough to reach to the lower level. This is furnished\r\nwith brazen buckets, each holding about a _congius_. Then by turning the\r\nwheel, the chain also turns upon the axis and brings the buckets to the\r\ntop thereof, on passing which they are inverted and pour into the\r\nconduits the water they have raised.\"\r\n\r\n[15] This description certainly does not correspond in every particular\r\nwith the illustration.\r\n\r\n[16] There is a certain deficiency in the hydraulics of this machine.\r\n\r\n[17] The dimensions given in this description for the various members do\r\nnot tally.\r\n\r\n[18] _Melibocian_,--the Harz.\r\n\r\n[19] In the original text this is given as \"lower,\" and appears to be an\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n[20] Pliny (XXXI, 28). \"In deep wells, the occurrence of _sulphurata_ or\r\n_aluminosa_ vapor is fatal to the diggers. The presence of this peril is\r\nshown if a lighted lamp let down into the well is extinguished. If so,\r\nother wells are sunk to the right and left, which carry off these\r\nnoxious gases. Apart from these evils, the air itself becomes noxious\r\nwith depth, which can be remedied by constantly shaking linen cloths,\r\nthus setting the air in motion.\"\r\n\r\n[21] This is given in the German translation as _kobelt_. The _kobelt_\r\n(or _cobaltum_ of Agricola) was probably arsenical-cobalt, a mineral\r\ncommon in the Saxon mines. The origin of the application of the word\r\ncobalt to a mineral appears to lie in the German word for the gnomes and\r\ngoblins (_kobelts_) so universal to Saxon miners' imaginations,--this\r\nword in turn probably being derived from the Greek _cobali_ (mimes). The\r\nsuffering described above seems to have been associated with the\r\nmalevolence of demons, and later the word for these demons was attached\r\nto this disagreeable ore. A quaint series of mining \"sermons,\" by Johann\r\nMathesius, entitled _Sarepta oder Bergpostill_, Nuernberg, 1562, contains\r\nthe following passage (p. 154) which bears out this view. We retain the\r\noriginal and varied spelling of cobalt and also add another view of\r\nMathesius, involving an experience of Solomon and Hiram of Tyre with\r\nsome mines containing cobalt.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes, however, from dry hard veins a certain black, greenish, grey\r\nor ash-coloured earth is dug out, often containing good ore, and this\r\nmineral being burnt gives strong fumes and is extracted like 'tutty.' It\r\nis called _cadmia fossilis_. You miners call it _cobelt_. Germans call\r\nthe Black Devil and the old Devil's furies, old and black _cobel_, who\r\ninjure people and their cattle with their witchcrafts. Now the Devil is\r\na wicked, malicious spirit, who shoots his poisoned darts into the\r\nhearts of men, as sorcerers and witches shoot at the limbs of cattle and\r\nmen, and work much evil and mischief with _cobalt_ or _hipomane_ or\r\nhorses' poison. After quicksilver and _rotgueltigen_ ore, are _cobalt_\r\nand _wismuth_ fumes; these are the most poisonous of the metals, and\r\nwith them one can kill flies, mice, cattle, birds, and men. So, fresh\r\n_cobalt_ and _kisswasser_ (vitriol?) devour the hands and feet of\r\nminers, and the dust and fumes of _cobalt_ kill many mining people and\r\nworkpeople who do much work among the fumes of the smelters. Whether or\r\nnot the Devil and his hellish crew gave their name to _cobelt_, or\r\n_kobelt_, nevertheless, _cobelt_ is a poisonous and injurious metal even\r\nif it contains silver. I find in I. Kings 9, the word _Cabul_. When\r\nSolomon presented twenty towns in Galilee to the King of Tyre, Hiram\r\nvisited them first, and would not have them, and said the land was well\r\nnamed _Cabul_ as Joshua had christened it. It is certain from Joshua\r\nthat these twenty towns lay in the Kingdom of Aser, not far from our\r\n_Sarepta_, and that there had been iron and copper mines there, as Moses\r\nsays in another place. Inasmuch, then, as these twenty places were\r\nmining towns, and _cobelt_ is a metal, it appears quite likely that the\r\nmineral took its name from the land of Cabul. History and circumstances\r\nbear out the theory that Hiram was an excellent and experienced miner,\r\nwho obtained much gold from Ophir, with which he honoured Solomon.\r\nTherefore, the Great King wished to show his gratitude to his good\r\nneighbour by honouring a miner with mining towns. But because the King\r\nof Tyre was skilled in mines, he first inspected the new mines, and saw\r\nthat they only produced poor metal and much wild _cobelt_ ore, therefore\r\nhe preferred to find his gold by digging the gold and silver in India\r\nrather than by getting it by the _cobelt_ veins and ore. For truly,\r\n_cobelt_ ores are injurious, and are usually so embedded in other ore\r\nthat they rob them in the fire and consume (_madtet und frist_) much\r\nlead before the silver is extracted, and when this happens it is\r\nespecially _speysig_. Therefore Hiram made a good reckoning as to the\r\nmines and would not undertake all the expense of working and smelting,\r\nand so returned Solomon the twenty towns.\"\r\n\r\n[22] Pliny (XXXIII, 40). \"Those employed in the works preparing\r\nvermilion, cover their faces with a bladder-skin, that they may not\r\ninhale the pernicious powder, yet they can see through the skin.\"\r\n\r\n[23] _Pompholyx_ was a furnace deposit, usually mostly zinc oxide, but\r\noften containing arsenical oxide, and to this latter quality this\r\nreference probably applies. The symptoms mentioned later in the text\r\namply indicate arsenical poisoning, of which a sort of spherical effect\r\non the hands is characteristic. See also note on p. 112 for discussion\r\nof \"corrosive\" _cadmia_; further information on _pompholyx_ is given in\r\nNote 26, p. 394.\r\n\r\n[24] Orcus, the god of the infernal regions,--otherwise Pluto.\r\n\r\n[25] Caius Julius Solinus was an unreliable Roman Grammarian of the 3rd\r\nCentury. There is much difference of opinion as to the precise animal\r\nmeant by _solifuga_. The word is variously spelled _solipugus, solpugus,\r\nsolipuga, solipunga_, etc., and is mentioned by Pliny (VIII., 43), and\r\nother ancient authors all apparently meaning a venomous insect, either\r\nan ant or a spider. The term in later times indicated a scorpion.\r\n\r\n[26] The presence of demons or gnomes in the mines was so general a\r\nbelief that Agricola fully accepted it. This is more remarkable, in view\r\nof our author's very general scepticism regarding the supernatural. He,\r\nhowever, does not classify them all as bad--some being distinctly\r\nhelpful. The description of gnomes of kindly intent, which is contained\r\nin the last paragraph in _De Animantibus_ is of interest:--\r\n\r\n\"Then there are the gentle kind which the Germans as well as the Greeks\r\ncall cobalos, because they mimic men. They appear to laugh with glee and\r\npretend to do much, but really do nothing. They are called little\r\nminers, because of their dwarfish stature, which is about two feet. They\r\nare venerable looking and are clothed like miners in a filleted garment\r\nwith a leather apron about their loins. This kind does not often trouble\r\nthe miners, but they idle about in the shafts and tunnels and really do\r\nnothing, although they pretend to be busy in all kinds of labour,\r\nsometimes digging ore, and sometimes putting into buckets that which has\r\nbeen dug. Sometimes they throw pebbles at the workmen, but they rarely\r\ninjure them unless the workmen first ridicule or curse them. They are\r\nnot very dissimilar to Goblins, which occasionally appear to men when\r\nthey go to or from their day's work, or when they attend their cattle.\r\nBecause they generally appear benign to men, the Germans call them\r\n_guteli_. Those called _trulli_, which take the form of women as well as\r\nmen, actually enter the service of some people, especially the _Suions_.\r\nThe mining gnomes are especially active in the workings where metal has\r\nalready been found, or where there are hopes of discovering it, because\r\nof which they do not discourage the miners, but on the contrary\r\nstimulate them and cause them to labour more vigorously.\"\r\n\r\nThe German miners were not alone in such beliefs, for miners generally\r\naccepted them--even to-day the faith in \"knockers\" has not entirely\r\ndisappeared from Cornwall. Neither the sea nor the forest so lends\r\nitself to the substantiation of the supernatural as does the mine. The\r\ndead darkness, in which the miners' lamps serve only to distort every\r\nshape, the uncanny noises of restless rocks whose support has been\r\nundermined, the approach of danger and death without warning, the sudden\r\nvanishing or discovery of good fortune, all yield a thousand\r\ncorroborations to minds long steeped in ignorance and prepared for the\r\nmiraculous through religious teaching.\r\n\r\n[27] The Plains of Laurentius extend from the mouth of the Tiber\r\nsouthward--say twenty miles south of Rome. What Agricola's authority was\r\nfor silver mines in this region we cannot discover. This may, however,\r\nrefer to the lead-silver district of the Attic Peninsula, Laurion being\r\nsometimes Latinized as _Laurium_ or _Laurius_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the Sixth Book has described the iron tools, the vessels and the\r\nmachines used in mines, this Book will describe the methods of\r\nassaying[1] ores; because it is desirable to first test them in order\r\nthat the material mined may be advantageously smelted, or that the dross\r\nmay be purged away and the metal made pure. Although writers have\r\nmentioned such tests, yet none of them have set down the directions for\r\nperforming them, wherefore it is no wonder that those who come later\r\nhave written nothing on the subject. By tests of this kind miners can\r\ndetermine with certainty whether ores contain any metal in them or not;\r\nor if it has already been indicated that the ore contains one or more\r\nmetals, the tests show whether it is much or little; the miners also\r\nascertain by such tests the method by which the metal can be separated\r\nfrom that part of the ore devoid of it; and further, by these tests,\r\nthey determine that part in which there is much metal from that part in\r\nwhich there is little. Unless these tests have been carefully applied\r\nbefore the metals are melted out, the ore cannot be smelted without\r\ngreat loss to the owners, for the parts which do not easily melt in the\r\nfire carry the metals off with them or consume them. In the last case,\r\nthey pass off with the fumes; in the other case they are mixed with the\r\nslag and furnace accretions, and in such event the owners lose the\r\nlabour which they have spent in preparing the furnaces and the\r\ncrucibles, and further, it is necessary for them to incur fresh\r\nexpenditure for fluxes and other things. Metals, when they have been\r\nmelted out, are usually assayed in order that we may ascertain what\r\nproportion of silver is in a _centumpondium_ of copper or lead, or what\r\nquantity of gold is in one _libra_ of silver; and, on the other hand,\r\nwhat proportion of copper or lead is contained in a _centumpondium_ of\r\nsilver, or what quantity of silver is contained in one _libra_ of gold.\r\nAnd from this we can calculate whether it will be worth while to\r\nseparate the precious metals from the base metals, or not. Further, a\r\ntest of this kind shows whether coins are good or are debased; and\r\nreadily detects silver, if the coiners have mixed more than is lawful\r\nwith the gold; or copper, if the coiners have alloyed with the gold or\r\nsilver more of it than is allowable. I will explain all these methods\r\nwith the utmost care that I can.\r\n\r\nThe method of assaying ore used by mining people, differs from smelting\r\nonly by the small amount of material used. Inasmuch as, by smelting a\r\nsmall quantity, they learn whether the smelting of a large quantity\r\nwill compensate them for their expenditure; hence, if they are not\r\nparticular to employ assays, they may, as I have already said, sometimes\r\nsmelt the metal from the ore with a loss or sometimes without any\r\nprofit; for they can assay the ore at a very small expense, and smelt\r\nit only at a great expense. Both processes, however, are carried out in\r\nthe same way, for just as we assay ore in a little furnace, so do we\r\nsmelt it in the large furnace. Also in both cases charcoal and not wood\r\nis burned. Moreover, in the crucible when metals are tested, be they\r\ngold, silver, copper, or lead, they are mixed in precisely the same way\r\nas they are mixed in the blast furnace when they are smelted. Further,\r\nthose who assay ores with fire, either pour out the metal in a liquid\r\nstate, or, when it has cooled, break the crucible and clean the metal\r\nfrom slag; and in the same way the smelter, as soon as the metal flows\r\nfrom the furnace into the forehearth, pours in cold water and takes the\r\nslag from the metal with a hooked bar. Finally, in the same way that\r\ngold and silver are separated from lead in a cupel, so also are they\r\nseparated in the cupellation furnace.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the assayer who is testing ore or metals should be\r\nprepared and instructed in all things necessary in assaying, and that he\r\nshould close the doors of the room in which the assay furnace stands,\r\nlest anyone coming at an inopportune moment might disturb his thoughts\r\nwhen they are intent on the work. It is also necessary for him to place\r\nhis balances in a case, so that when he weighs the little buttons of\r\nmetal the scales may not be agitated by a draught of air, for that is a\r\nhindrance to his work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 223a (Muffle Furnace): Round assay furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 223b (Muffle Furnace): Rectangular assay furnace.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 224 (Muffle Assay Furnace): A--Openings in the plate.\r\nB--Part of plate which projects beyond the furnace.]\r\n\r\nNow I will describe the different things which are necessary in\r\nassaying, beginning with the assay furnace, of which one differs from\r\nanother in shape, material, and the place in which it is set. In shape,\r\nthey may be round or rectangular, the latter shape being more suited to\r\nassaying ores. The materials of the assay furnaces differ, in that one\r\nis made of bricks, another of iron, and certain ones of clay. The one of\r\nbricks is built on a chimney-hearth which is three and a half feet high;\r\nthe iron one is placed in the same position, and also the one of clay.\r\nThe brick one is a cubit high, a foot wide on the inside, and one foot\r\ntwo digits long; at a point five digits above the hearth--which is\r\nusually the thickness of an unbaked[2] brick--an iron plate is laid, and\r\nsmeared over with lute on the upper side to prevent it from being\r\ninjured by the fire; in front of the furnace above the plate is a mouth\r\na palm high, five digits wide, and rounded at the top. The iron plate\r\nhas three openings which are one digit wide and three digits long, one\r\nis at each side and the third at the back; through them sometimes the\r\nash falls from the burning charcoal, and sometimes the draught blows\r\nthrough the chamber which is below the iron plate, and stimulates the\r\nfire. For this reason this furnace when used by metallurgists is named\r\nfrom assaying, but when used by the alchemists it is named from the\r\nwind[3]. The part of the iron plate which projects from the furnace is\r\ngenerally three-quarters of a palm long and a palm wide; small pieces\r\nof charcoal, after being laid thereon, can be placed quickly in the\r\nfurnace through its mouth with a pair of tongs, or again, if necessary,\r\ncan be taken out of the furnace and laid there.\r\n\r\nThe iron assay furnace is made of four iron bars a foot and a half high;\r\nwhich at the bottom are bent outward and broadened a short distance to\r\nenable them to stand more firmly; the front part of the furnace is made\r\nfrom two of these bars, and the back part from two of them; to these\r\nbars on both sides are joined and welded three iron cross-bars, the\r\nfirst at a height of a palm from the bottom, the second at a height of a\r\nfoot, and the third at the top. The upright bars are perforated at that\r\npoint where the side cross-bars are joined to them, in order that three\r\nsimilar iron bars on the remaining sides can be engaged in them; thus\r\nthere are twelve cross-bars, which make three stages at unequal\r\nintervals. At the lower stage, the upright bars are distant from each\r\nother one foot and five digits; and at the middle stage the front is\r\ndistant from the back three palms and one digit, and the sides are\r\ndistant from each other three palms and as many digits; at the highest\r\nstage from the front to the back there is a distance of two palms, and\r\nbetween the sides three palms, so that in this way the furnace becomes\r\nnarrower at the top. Furthermore, an iron rod, bent to the shape of the\r\nmouth, is set into the lowest bar of the front; this mouth, just like\r\nthat of the brick furnace, is a palm high and five digits wide. Then the\r\nfront cross-bar of the lower stage is perforated on each side of the\r\nmouth, and likewise the back one; through these perforations there pass\r\ntwo iron rods, thus making altogether four bars in the lower stage, and\r\nthese support an iron plate smeared with lute; part of this plate also\r\nprojects outside the furnace. The outside of the furnace from the lower\r\nstage to the upper, is covered with iron plates, which are bound to the\r\nbars by iron wires, and smeared with lute to enable them to bear the\r\nheat of the fire as long as possible.\r\n\r\nAs for the clay furnace, it must be made of fat, thick clay, medium so\r\nfar as relates to its softness or hardness. This furnace has exactly the\r\nsame height as the iron one, and its base is made of two earthenware\r\ntiles, one foot and three palms long and one foot and one palm wide.\r\nEach side of the fore part of both tiles is gradually cut away for the\r\nlength of a palm, so that they are half a foot and a digit wide, which\r\npart projects from the furnace; the tiles are about a digit and a half\r\nthick. The walls are similarly of clay, and are set on the lower tiles\r\nat a distance of a digit from the edge, and support the upper tiles; the\r\nwalls are three digits high and have four openings, each of which is\r\nabout three digits high; those of the back part and of each side are\r\nfive digits wide, and of the front, a palm and a half wide, to enable\r\nthe freshly made cupels to be conveniently placed on the hearth, when it\r\nhas been thoroughly warmed, that they may be dried there. Both tiles are\r\nbound on the outer edge with iron wire, pressed into them, so that they\r\nwill be less easily broken; and the tiles, not unlike the iron\r\nbed-plate, have three openings three digits long and a digit wide, in\r\norder that when the upper one on account of the heat of the fire or for\r\nsome other reason has become damaged, the lower one may be exchanged and\r\ntake its place. Through these holes, the ashes from the burning\r\ncharcoal, as I have stated, fall down, and air blows into the furnace\r\nafter passing through the openings in the walls of the chamber. The\r\nfurnace is rectangular, and inside at the lower part it is three palms\r\nand one digit wide and three palms and as many digits long. At the upper\r\npart it is two palms and three digits wide, so that it also grows\r\nnarrower; it is one foot high; in the middle of the back it is cut out\r\nat the bottom in the shape of a semicircle, of half a digit radius. Not\r\nunlike the furnace before described, it has in its forepart a mouth\r\nwhich is rounded at the top, one palm high and a palm and a digit wide.\r\nIts door is also made of clay, and this has a window and a handle; even\r\nthe lid of the furnace which is made of clay has its own handle,\r\nfastened on with iron wire. The outer parts and sides of this furnace\r\nare bound with iron wires, which are usually pressed in, in the shape of\r\ntriangles. The brick furnaces must remain stationary; the clay and iron\r\nones can be carried from one place to another. Those of brick can be\r\nprepared more quickly, while those of iron are more lasting, and those\r\nof clay are more suitable. Assayers also make temporary furnaces in\r\nanother way; they stand three bricks on a hearth, one on each side and a\r\nthird one at the back, the forepart lies open to the draught, and on\r\nthese bricks is placed an iron plate, upon which they again stand three\r\nbricks, which hold and retain the charcoal.\r\n\r\nThe setting of one furnace differs from another, in that some are placed\r\nhigher and others lower; that one is placed higher, in which the man who\r\nis assaying the ore or metals introduces the scorifier through the mouth\r\nwith the tongs; that one is placed lower, into which he introduces the\r\ncrucible through its open top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 227 (Crucible Assay Furnace): A--Iron hoop. B--Double\r\nbellows. C--Its nozzle. D--Lever.]\r\n\r\nIn some cases the assayer uses an iron hoop[4] in place of a furnace;\r\nthis is placed upon the hearth of a chimney, the lower edge being daubed\r\nwith lute to prevent the blast of the bellows from escaping under it. If\r\nthe blast is given slowly, the ore will be smelted and the copper will\r\nmelt in the triangular crucible, which is placed in it and taken away\r\nagain with the tongs. The hoop is two palms high and half a digit thick;\r\nits diameter is generally one foot and one palm, and where the blast\r\nfrom the bellows enters into it, it is notched out. The bellows is a\r\ndouble one, such as goldworkers use, and sometimes smiths. In the middle\r\nof the bellows there is a board in which there is an air-hole, five\r\ndigits wide and seven long, covered by a little flap which is fastened\r\nover the air-hole on the lower side of the board; this flap is of equal\r\nlength and width. The bellows, without its head, is three feet long, and\r\nat the back is one foot and one palm wide and somewhat rounded, and it\r\nis three palms wide at the head; the head itself is three palms long and\r\ntwo palms and a digit wide at the part where it joins the boards, then\r\nit gradually becomes narrower. The nozzle, of which there is only one,\r\nis one foot and two digits long; this nozzle, and one-half of the head\r\nin which the nozzle is fixed, are placed in an opening of the wall, this\r\nbeing one foot and one palm thick; it reaches only to the iron hoop on\r\nthe hearth, for it does not project beyond the wall. The hide of the\r\nbellows is fixed to the bellows-boards with its own peculiar kind of\r\niron nails. It joins both bellows-boards to the head, and over it there\r\nare cross strips of hide fixed to the bellows-boards with broad-headed\r\nnails, and similarly fixed to the head. The middle board of the bellows\r\nrests on an iron bar, to which it is fastened with iron nails clinched\r\non both ends, so that it cannot move; the iron bar is fixed between two\r\nupright posts, through which it penetrates. Higher up on these upright\r\nposts there is a wooden axle, with iron journals which revolve in the\r\nholes in the posts. In the middle of this axle there is mortised a\r\nlever, fixed with iron nails to prevent it from flying out; the lever is\r\nfive and a half feet long, and its posterior end is engaged in the iron\r\nring of an iron rod which reaches to the \"tail\" of the lowest\r\nbellows-board, and there engages another similar ring. And so when the\r\nworkman pulls down the lever, the lower part of the bellows is raised\r\nand drives the wind into the nozzle; then the wind, penetrating through\r\nthe hole in the middle bellows-board, which is called the air-hole,\r\nlifts up the upper part of the bellows, upon whose upper board is a\r\npiece of lead, heavy enough to press down that part of the bellows\r\nagain, and this being pressed down blows a blast through the nozzle.\r\nThis is the principle of the double bellows, which is peculiar to the\r\niron hoop where are placed the triangular crucibles in which copper ore\r\nis smelted and copper is melted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 228 (Muffles): A--Broad little windows of muffle.\r\nB--Narrow ones. C--Openings in the back thereof.]\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the furnaces and the iron hoop; I will now speak of the\r\nmuffles and the crucibles. The muffle is made of clay, in the shape of\r\nan inverted gutter tile; it covers the scorifiers, lest coal dust fall\r\ninto them and interfere with the assay. It is a palm and a half broad,\r\nand the height, which corresponds with the mouth of the furnace, is\r\ngenerally a palm, and it is nearly as long as the furnace; only at the\r\nfront end does it touch the mouth of the furnace, everywhere else on the\r\nsides and at the back there is a space of three digits, to allow the\r\ncharcoal to lie in the open space between it and the furnace. The muffle\r\nis as thick as a fairly thick earthen jar; its upper part is entire; the\r\nback has two little windows, and each side has two or three or even\r\nfour, through which the heat passes into the scorifiers and melts the\r\nore. In place of little windows, some muffles have small holes, ten in\r\nthe back and more on each side. Moreover, in the back below the little\r\nwindows, or small holes, there are cut away three semi-circular notches\r\nhalf a digit high, and on each side there are four. The back of the\r\nmuffle is generally a little lower than the front.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 229 (Containers): A--Scorifier. B--Triangular crucible.\r\nC--Cupel.]\r\n\r\nThe crucibles differ in the materials from which they are made, because\r\nthey are made of either clay or ashes; and those of clay, which we also\r\ncall \"earthen,\" differ in shape and size. Some are made in the shape of\r\na moderately thick salver (scorifiers), three digits wide, and of a\r\ncapacity of an _uncia_ measure; in these the ore mixed with fluxes is\r\nmelted, and they are used by those who assay gold or silver ore. Some\r\nare triangular and much thicker and more capacious, holding five, or\r\nsix, or even more _unciae_; in these copper is melted, so that it can be\r\npoured out, expanded, and tested with fire, and in these copper ore is\r\nusually melted.\r\n\r\nThe cupels are made of ashes; like the preceding scorifiers they are\r\ntray-shaped, and their lower part is very thick but their capacity is\r\nless. In these lead is separated from silver, and by them assays are\r\nconcluded. Inasmuch as the assayers themselves make the cupels,\r\nsomething must be said about the material from which they are made, and\r\nthe method of making them. Some make them out of all kinds of ordinary\r\nashes; these are not good, because ashes of this kind contain a certain\r\namount of fat, whereby such cupels are easily broken when they are hot.\r\nOthers make them likewise out of any kind of ashes which have been\r\npreviously leached; of this kind are the ashes into which warm water has\r\nbeen infused for the purpose of making lye. These ashes, after being\r\ndried in the sun or a furnace, are sifted in a hair sieve; and although\r\nwarm water washes away the fat from the ashes, still the cupels which\r\nare made from such ashes are not very good because they often contain\r\ncharcoal dust, sand, and pebbles. Some make them in the same way out of\r\nany kind of ashes, but first of all pour water into the ashes and remove\r\nthe scum which floats thereon; then, after it has become clear, they\r\npour away the water, and dry the ashes; they then sift them and make the\r\ncupels from them. These, indeed, are good, but not of the best quality,\r\nbecause ashes of this kind are also not devoid of small pebbles and\r\nsand. To enable cupels of the best quality to be made, all the\r\nimpurities must be removed from the ashes. These impurities are of two\r\nkinds; the one sort light, to which class belong charcoal dust and fatty\r\nmaterial and other things which float in water, the other sort heavy,\r\nsuch as small stones, fine sand, and any other materials which settle in\r\nthe bottom of a vessel. Therefore, first of all, water should be poured\r\ninto the ashes and the light impurities removed; then the ashes should\r\nbe kneaded with the hands, so that they will become properly mixed with\r\nthe water. When the water has become muddy and turbid, it should be\r\npoured into a second vessel. In this way the small stones and fine sand,\r\nor any other heavy substance which may be there, remain in the first\r\nvessel, and should be thrown away. When all the ashes have settled in\r\nthis second vessel, which will be shown if the water has become clear\r\nand does not taste of the flavour of lye, the water should be thrown\r\naway, and the ashes which have settled in the vessel should be dried in\r\nthe sun or in a furnace. This material is suitable for the cupels,\r\nespecially if it is the ash of beech wood or other wood which has a\r\nsmall annual growth; those ashes made from twigs and limbs of vines,\r\nwhich have rapid annual growth, are not so good, for the cupels made\r\nfrom them, since they are not sufficiently dry, frequently crack and\r\nbreak in the fire and absorb the metals. If ashes of beech or similar\r\nwood are not to be had, the assayer makes little balls of such ashes as\r\nhe can get, after they have been cleared of impurities in the manner\r\nbefore described, and puts them in a baker's or potter's oven to burn,\r\nand from these the cupels are made, because the fire consumes whatever\r\nfat or damp there may be. As to all kinds of ashes, the older they are\r\nthe better, for it is necessary that they should have the greatest\r\npossible dryness. For this reason ashes obtained from burned bones,\r\nespecially from the bones of the heads of animals, are the most suitable\r\nfor cupels, as are also those ashes obtained from the horns of deer and\r\nthe spines of fishes. Lastly, some take the ashes which are obtained\r\nfrom burnt scrapings of leather, when the tanners scrape the hides to\r\nclear them from hair. Some prefer to use compounds, that one being\r\nrecommended which has one and a half parts of ashes from the bones of\r\nanimals or the spines of fishes, and one part of beech ashes, and half a\r\npart of ashes of burnt hide scrapings. From this mixture good cupels are\r\nmade, though far better ones are obtained from equal portions of ashes\r\nof burnt hide scrapings, ashes of the bones of heads of sheep and\r\ncalves, and ashes of deer horns. But the best of all are produced from\r\ndeer horns alone, burnt to powder; this kind, by reason of its extreme\r\ndryness, absorbs metals least of all. Assayers of our own day, however,\r\ngenerally make the cupels from beech ashes. These ashes, after being\r\nprepared in the manner just described, are first of all sprinkled with\r\nbeer or water, to make them stick together, and are then ground in a\r\nsmall mortar. They are ground again after being mixed with the ashes\r\nobtained from the skulls of beasts or from the spines of fishes; the\r\nmore the ashes are ground the better they are. Some rub bricks and\r\nsprinkle the dust so obtained, after sifting it, into the beech ashes,\r\nfor dust of this kind does not allow the hearth-lead to absorb the gold\r\nor silver by eating away the cupels. Others, to guard against the same\r\nthing, moisten the cupels with white of egg after they have been made,\r\nand when they have been dried in the sun, again crush them; especially\r\nif they want to assay in it an ore of copper which contains iron. Some\r\nmoisten the ashes again and again with cow's milk, and dry them, and\r\ngrind them in a small mortar, and then mould the cupels. In the works in\r\nwhich silver is separated from copper, they make cupels from two parts\r\nof the ashes of the crucible of the cupellation furnace, for these ashes\r\nare very dry, and from one part of bone-ash. Cupels which have been made\r\nin these ways also need to be placed in the sun or in a furnace;\r\nafterward, in whatever way they have been made, they must be kept a long\r\ntime in dry places, for the older they are, the dryer and better they\r\nare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 231 (Cupel Moulds and Pestles): A--Little mould.\r\nB--Inverted mould. C--Pestle. D--Its knob. E--Second pestle.]\r\n\r\nNot only potters, but also the assayers themselves, make scorifiers and\r\ntriangular crucibles. They make them out of fatty clay, which is dry[5],\r\nand neither hard nor soft. With this clay they mix the dust of old\r\nbroken crucibles, or of burnt and worn bricks; then they knead with a\r\npestle the clay thus mixed with dust, and then dry it. As to these\r\ncrucibles, the older they are, the dryer and better they are. The\r\nmoulds in which the cupels are moulded are of two kinds, that is, a\r\nsmaller size and a larger size. In the smaller ones are made the cupels\r\nin which silver or gold is purged from the lead which has absorbed it;\r\nin the larger ones are made cupels in which silver is separated from\r\ncopper and lead. Both moulds are made out of brass and have no bottom,\r\nin order that the cupels can be taken out of them whole. The pestles\r\nalso are of two kinds, smaller and larger, each likewise of brass, and\r\nfrom the lower end of them there projects a round knob, and this alone\r\nis pressed into the mould and makes the hollow part of the cupel. The\r\npart which is next to the knob corresponds to the upper part of the\r\nmould.\r\n\r\nSo much for these matters. I will now speak of the preparation of the\r\nore for assaying. It is prepared by roasting, burning, crushing, and\r\nwashing. It is necessary to take a fixed weight of ore in order that one\r\nmay determine how great a portion of it these preparations consume. The\r\nhard stone containing the metal is burned in order that, when its\r\nhardness has been overcome, it can be crushed and washed; indeed, the\r\nvery hardest kind, before it is burned, is sprinkled with vinegar, in\r\norder that it may more rapidly soften in the fire. The soft stone should\r\nbe broken with a hammer, crushed in a mortar and reduced to powder; then\r\nit should be washed and then dried again. If earth is mixed with the\r\nmineral, it is washed in a basin, and that which settles is assayed in\r\nthe fire after it is dried. All mining products which are washed must\r\nagain be dried. But ore which is rich in metal is neither burned nor\r\ncrushed nor washed, but is roasted, lest that method of preparation\r\nshould lose some of the metal. When the fires have been kindled, this\r\nkind of ore is roasted in an enclosed pot, which is stopped up with\r\nlute. A less valuable ore is even burned on a hearth, being placed upon\r\nthe charcoal; for we do not make a great expenditure upon metals, if\r\nthey are not worth it. However, I will go into fuller details as to all\r\nthese methods of preparing ore, both a little later, and in the\r\nfollowing Book.\r\n\r\nFor the present, I have decided to explain those things which mining\r\npeople usually call fluxes[6] because they are added to ores, not only\r\nfor assaying, but also for smelting. Great power is discovered in all\r\nthese fluxes, but we do not see the same effects produced in every case;\r\nand some are of a very complicated nature. For when they have been mixed\r\nwith the ore and are melted in either the assay or the smelting furnace,\r\nsome of them, because they melt easily, to some extent melt the ore;\r\nothers, because they either make the ore very hot or penetrate into it,\r\ngreatly assist the fire in separating the impurities from the metals,\r\nand they also mix the fused part with the lead, or they partly protect\r\nfrom the fire the ore whose metal contents would be either consumed in\r\nthe fire, or carried up with the fumes and fly out of the furnace; some\r\nfluxes absorb the metals. To the first order belongs lead, whether it be\r\nreduced to little granules or resolved into ash by fire, or red-lead[7],\r\nor ochre made from lead[8], or litharge, or hearth-lead, or galena;\r\nalso copper, the same either roasted or in leaves or filings[9]; also\r\nthe slags of gold, silver, copper, and lead; also soda[10], its slags,\r\nsaltpetre, burned alum, vitriol, _sal tostus_, and melted salt[11];\r\nstones which easily melt in hot furnaces, the sand which is made from\r\nthem[12]; soft _tophus_[13], and a certain white schist[14]. But lead,\r\nits ashes, red-lead, ochre, and litharge, are more efficacious for ores\r\nwhich melt easily; hearth-lead for those which melt with difficulty; and\r\ngalena for those which melt with greater difficulty. To the second order\r\nbelong iron filings, their slag, _sal artificiosus_, argol, dried lees\r\nof vinegar[15], and the lees of the _aqua_ which separates gold from\r\nsilver[16]; these lees and _sal artificiosus_ have the power of\r\npenetrating into ore, the argol to a considerable degree, the lees of\r\nvinegar to a greater degree, but most of all those of the _aqua_ which\r\nseparates gold from silver; filings and slags of iron, since they melt\r\nmore slowly, have the power of heating the ore. To the third order\r\nbelong pyrites, the cakes which are melted from them, soda, its slags,\r\nsalt, iron, iron scales, iron filings, iron slags, vitriol, the sand\r\nwhich is resolved from stones which easily melt in the fire, and\r\n_tophus_; but first of all are pyrites and the cakes which are melted\r\nfrom it, for they absorb the metals of the ore and guard them from the\r\nfire which consumes them. To the fourth order belong lead and copper,\r\nand their relations. And so with regard to fluxes, it is manifest that\r\nsome are natural, others fall in the category of slags, and the rest are\r\npurged from slag. When we assay ores, we can without great expense add\r\nto them a small portion of any sort of flux, but when we smelt them we\r\ncannot add a large portion without great expense. We must, therefore,\r\nconsider how great the cost is, to avoid incurring a greater expense on\r\nsmelting an ore than the profit we make out of the metals which it\r\nyields.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the fumes which the ore emits after being placed on a hot\r\nshovel or an iron plate, indicates what flux is needed in addition to\r\nthe lead, for the purpose of either assaying or smelting. If the fumes\r\nhave a purple tint, it is best of all, and the ore does not generally\r\nrequire any flux whatever. If the fumes are blue, there should be added\r\ncakes melted out of pyrites or other cupriferous rock; if yellow,\r\nlitharge and sulphur should be added; if red, glass-galls[17] and salt;\r\nif green, then cakes melted from cupriferous stones, litharge, and\r\nglass-galls; if the fumes are black, melted salt or iron slag, litharge\r\nand white lime rock. If they are white, sulphur and iron which is eaten\r\nwith rust; if they are white with green patches, iron slag and sand\r\nobtained from stones which easily melt; if the middle part of the fumes\r\nare yellow and thick, but the outer parts green, the same sand and iron\r\nslag. The colour of the fumes not only gives us information as to the\r\nproper remedies which should be applied to each ore, but also more or\r\nless indication as to the solidified juices which are mixed with it, and\r\nwhich give forth such fumes. Generally, blue fumes signify that the ore\r\ncontains azure yellow, orpiment; red, realgar; green, chrysocolla;\r\nblack, black bitumen; white, tin[18]; white with green patches, the same\r\nmixed with chrysocolla; the middle part yellow and other parts green\r\nshow that it contains sulphur. Earth, however, and other things dug up\r\nwhich contain metals, sometimes emit similarly coloured fumes.\r\n\r\nIf the ore contains any _stibium_, then iron slag is added to it; if\r\npyrites, then are added cakes melted from a cupriferous stone and sand\r\nmade from stones which easily melt. If the ore contains iron, then\r\npyrites and sulphur are added; for just as iron slag is the flux for an\r\nore mixed with sulphur, so on the contrary, to a gold or silver ore\r\ncontaining iron, from which they are not easily separated, is added\r\nsulphur and sand made from stones which easily melt.\r\n\r\n_Sal artificiosus_[19] suitable for use in assaying ore is made in many\r\nways. By the first method, equal portions of argol, lees of vinegar, and\r\nurine, are all boiled down together till turned into salt. The second\r\nmethod is from equal portions of the ashes which wool-dyers use, of\r\nlime, of argol purified, and of melted salt; one _libra_ of each of\r\nthese ingredients is thrown into twenty _librae_ of urine; then all are\r\nboiled down to one-third and strained, and afterward there is added to\r\nwhat remains one _libra_ and four _unciae_ of unmelted salt, eight\r\npounds of lye being at the same time poured into the pots, with litharge\r\nsmeared around on the inside, and the whole is boiled till the salt\r\nbecomes thoroughly dry. The third method follows. Unmelted salt, and\r\niron which is eaten with rust, are put into a vessel, and after urine\r\nhas been poured in, it is covered with a lid and put in a warm place for\r\nthirty days; then the iron is washed in the urine and taken out, and the\r\nresidue is boiled until it is turned into salt. In the fourth method by\r\nwhich _sal artificiosus_ is prepared, the lye made from equal portions\r\nof lime and the ashes which wool-dyers use, together with equal portions\r\nof salt, soap, white argol, and saltpetre, are boiled until in the end\r\nthe mixture evaporates and becomes salt. This salt is mixed with the\r\nconcentrates from washing, to melt them.\r\n\r\nSaltpetre is prepared in the following manner, in order that it may be\r\nsuitable for use in assaying ore. It is placed in a pot which is smeared\r\non the inside with litharge, and lye made of quicklime is repeatedly\r\npoured over it, and it is heated until the fire consumes it. Wherefore\r\nthe saltpetre does not kindle with the fire, since it has absorbed the\r\nlime which preserves it, and thus it is prepared[20].\r\n\r\nThe following compositions[21] are recommended to smelt all ores which\r\nthe heat of fire breaks up or melts only with difficulty. Of these, one\r\nis made from stones of the third order, which easily melt when thrown\r\ninto hot furnaces. They are crushed into pure white powder, and with\r\nhalf an _uncia_ of this powder there are mixed two _unciae_ of yellow\r\nlitharge, likewise crushed. This mixture is put into a scorifier large\r\nenough to hold it, and placed under the muffle of a hot furnace; when\r\nthe charge flows like water, which occurs after half an hour, it is\r\ntaken out of the furnace and poured on to a stone, and when it has\r\nhardened it has the appearance of glass, and this is likewise crushed.\r\nThis powder is sprinkled over any metalliferous ore which does not\r\neasily melt when we are assaying it, and it causes the slag to exude.\r\n\r\nOthers, in place of litharge, substitute lead ash,[22] which is made in\r\nthe following way: sulphur is thrown into lead which has been melted in\r\na crucible, and it soon becomes covered with a sort of scum; when this\r\nis removed, sulphur is again thrown in, and the skin which forms is\r\nagain taken off; this is frequently repeated, in fact until all the lead\r\nis turned into powder. There is a powerful flux compound which is made\r\nfrom one _uncia_ each of prepared saltpetre, melted salt, glass-gall,\r\nand argol, and one-third of an _uncia_ of litharge and a _bes_ of glass\r\nground to powder; this flux, being added to an equal weight of ore,\r\nliquefies it. A more powerful flux is made by placing together in a pot,\r\nsmeared on the inside with litharge, equal portions of white argol,\r\ncommon salt, and prepared saltpetre, and these are heated until a white\r\npowder is obtained from them, and this is mixed with as much litharge;\r\none part of this compound is mixed with two parts of the ore which is to\r\nbe assayed. A still more powerful flux than this is made out of ashes of\r\nblack lead, saltpetre, orpiment, _stibium_, and dried lees of the _aqua_\r\nwith which gold workers separate gold from silver. The ashes of lead[23]\r\nare made from one pound of lead and one pound of sulphur; the lead is\r\nflattened out into sheets by pounding with a hammer, and placed\r\nalternately with sulphur in a crucible or pot, and they are heated\r\ntogether until the fire consumes the sulphur and the lead turns to\r\nashes. One _libra_ of crushed saltpetre is mixed with one _libra_ of\r\norpiment similarly ground to powder, and the two are cooked in an iron\r\npan until they liquefy; they are then poured out, and after cooling are\r\nagain ground to powder. A _libra_ of _stibium_ and a _bes_ of the dried\r\nlees (_of what?_) are placed alternately in a crucible and heated to the\r\npoint at which they form a button, which is similarly reduced to powder.\r\nA _bes_ of this powder and one _libra_ of the ashes of lead, as well as\r\na _libra_ of powder made out of the saltpetre and orpiment, are mixed\r\ntogether and a powder is made from them, one part of which added to two\r\nparts of ore liquefies it and cleanses it of dross. But the most\r\npowerful flux is one which has two _drachmae_ of sulphur and as much\r\nglass-galls, and half an _uncia_ of each of the following,--_stibium_,\r\nsalt obtained from boiled urine, melted common salt, prepared saltpetre,\r\nlitharge, vitriol, argol, salt obtained from ashes of musk ivy, dried\r\nlees of the _aqua_ by which gold-workers separate gold from silver, alum\r\nreduced by fire to powder, and one _uncia_ of camphor[24] combined with\r\nsulphur and ground into powder. A half or whole portion of this mixture,\r\nas the necessity of the case requires, is mixed with one portion of the\r\nore and two portions of lead, and put in a scorifier; it is sprinkled\r\nwith powder of crushed Venetian glass, and when the mixture has been\r\nheated for an hour and a half or two hours, a button will settle in the\r\nbottom of the scorifier, and from it the lead is soon separated.\r\n\r\nThere is also a flux which separates sulphur, orpiment and realgar from\r\nmetalliferous ore. This flux is composed of equal portions of iron slag,\r\nwhite _tophus_, and salt. After these juices have been secreted, the\r\nores themselves are melted, with argol added to them. There is one flux\r\nwhich preserves _stibium_ from the fire, that the fire may not consume\r\nit, and which preserves the metals from the _stibium_; and this is\r\ncomposed of equal portions of sulphur, prepared saltpetre, melted salt,\r\nand vitriol, heated together in lye until no odour emanates from the\r\nsulphur, which occurs after a space of three or four hours.[25]\r\n\r\nIt is also worth while to substitute certain other mixtures. Take two\r\nportions of ore properly prepared, one portion of iron filings, and\r\nlikewise one portion of salt, and mix; then put them into a scorifier\r\nand place them in a muffle furnace; when they are reduced by the fire\r\nand run together, a button will settle in the bottom of the scorifier.\r\nOr else take equal portions of ore and of lead ochre, and mix with them\r\na small quantity of iron filings, and put them into a scorifier, then\r\nscatter iron filings over the mixture. Or else take ore which has been\r\nground to powder and sprinkle it in a crucible, and then sprinkle over\r\nit an equal quantity of salt that has been three or four times moistened\r\nwith urine and dried; then, again and again alternately, powdered ore\r\nand salt; next, after the crucible has been covered with a lid and\r\nsealed, it is placed upon burning charcoal. Or else take one portion of\r\nore, one portion of minute lead granules, half a portion of Venetian\r\nglass, and the same quantity of glass-galls. Or else take one portion of\r\nore, one portion of lead granules, half a portion of salt, one-fourth of\r\na portion of argol, and the same quantity of lees of the _aqua_ which\r\nseparates gold from silver. Or else take equal portions of prepared ore\r\nand a powder in which there are equal portions of very minute lead\r\ngranules, melted salt, _stibium_ and iron slag. Or else take equal\r\nportions of gold ore, vitriol, argol, and of salt. So much for the\r\nfluxes.\r\n\r\nIn the assay furnace, when it has been prepared in the way in which I\r\nhave described, is first placed a muffle. Then selected pieces of live\r\ncharcoals are laid on it, for, from pieces of inferior quality, a great\r\nquantity of ash collects around the muffle and hinders the action of the\r\nfire. Then the scorifiers are placed under the muffle with tongs, and\r\nglowing coals are placed under the fore part of the muffle to warm the\r\nscorifiers more quickly; and when the lead or ore is to be placed in the\r\nscorifiers, they are taken out again with the tongs. When the scorifiers\r\nglow in the heat, first of all the ash or small charcoals, if any have\r\nfallen into them, should be blown away with an iron pipe two feet long\r\nand a digit in diameter; this same thing must be done if ash or small\r\ncoal has fallen into the cupels. Next, put in a small ball of lead with\r\nthe tongs, and when this lead has begun to be turned into fumes and\r\nconsumed, add to it the prepared ore wrapped in paper. It is preferable\r\nthat the assayer should wrap it in paper, and in this way put it in the\r\nscorifier, than that he should drop it in with a copper ladle; for when\r\nthe scorifiers are small, if he uses a ladle he frequently spills some\r\npart of the ore. When the paper is burnt, he stirs the ore with a small\r\ncharcoal held in the tongs, so that the lead may absorb the metal which\r\nis mixed in the ore; when this mixture has taken place, the slag partly\r\nadheres by its circumference to the scorifier and makes a kind of black\r\nring, and partly floats on the lead in which is mixed the gold or\r\nsilver; then the slag must be removed from it.\r\n\r\nThe lead used must be entirely free from every trace of silver, as is\r\nthat which is known as _Villacense_.[26] But if this kind is not\r\nobtainable, the lead must be assayed separately, to determine with\r\ncertainty that proportion of silver it contains, so that it may be\r\ndeducted from the calculation of the ore, and the result be exact; for\r\nunless such lead be used, the assay will be false and misleading. The\r\nlead balls are made with a pair of iron tongs, about one foot long; its\r\niron claws are so formed that when pressed together they are egg-shaped;\r\neach claw contains a hollow cup, and when the claws are closed there\r\nextends upward from the cup a passage, so there are two openings, one of\r\nwhich leads to each hollow cup. And so when the molten lead is poured in\r\nthrough the openings, it flows down into the hollow cup, and two balls\r\nare formed by one pouring.\r\n\r\nIn this place I ought not to omit mention of another method of assaying\r\nemployed by some assayers. They first of all place prepared ore in the\r\nscorifiers and heat it, and afterward they add the lead. Of this method\r\nI cannot approve, for in this way the ore frequently becomes cemented,\r\nand for this reason it does not stir easily afterward, and is very slow\r\nin mixing with the lead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 240a (Tongs): A--Claws of the tongs. B--Iron, giving form\r\nof an egg. C--Opening.]\r\n\r\nIf the whole space of the furnace covered by the muffle is not filled\r\nwith scorifiers, cupels are put in the empty space, in order that they\r\nmay become warmed in the meantime. Sometimes, however, it is filled with\r\nscorifiers, when we are assaying many different ores, or many portions\r\nof one ore at the same time. Although the cupels are usually dried in\r\none hour, yet smaller ones are done more quickly, and the larger ones\r\nmore slowly. Unless the cupels are heated before the metal mixed with\r\nlead is placed in them, they frequently break, and the lead always\r\nsputters and sometimes leaps out of them; if the cupel is broken or the\r\nlead leaps out of it, it is necessary to assay another portion of ore;\r\nbut if the lead only sputters, then the cupels should be covered with\r\nbroad thin pieces of glowing charcoal, and when the lead strikes these,\r\nit falls back again, and thus the mixture is slowly exhaled. Further, if\r\nin the cupellation the lead which is in the mixture is not consumed, but\r\nremains fixed and set, and is covered by a kind of skin, this is a sign\r\nthat it has not been heated by a sufficiently hot fire; put into the\r\nmixture, therefore, a dry pine stick, or a twig of a similar tree, and\r\nhold it in the hand in order that it can be drawn away when it has been\r\nheated. Then take care that the heat is sufficient and equal; if the\r\nheat has not passed all round the charge, as it should when everything\r\nis done rightly, but causes it to have a lengthened shape, so that it\r\nappears to have a tail, this is a sign that the heat is deficient where\r\nthe tail lies. Then in order that the cupel may be equally heated by the\r\nfire, turn it around with a small iron hook, whose handle is likewise\r\nmade of iron and is a foot and a half long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 240b (Hook): Small iron hook.]\r\n\r\nNext, if the mixture has not enough lead, add as much of it as is\r\nrequired with the iron tongs, or with the brass ladle to which is\r\nfastened a very long handle. In order that the charge may not be cooled,\r\nwarm the lead beforehand. But it is better at first to add as much lead\r\nas is required to the ore which needs melting, rather than afterward\r\nwhen the melting has been half finished, that the whole quantity may not\r\nvanish in fumes, but part of it remain fast. When the heat of the fire\r\nhas nearly consumed the lead, then is the time when the gold and silver\r\ngleam in their varied colours, and when all the lead has been consumed\r\nthe gold or silver settles in the cupel. Then as soon as possible remove\r\nthe cupel out of the furnace, and take the button out of it while it is\r\nstill warm, in order that it does not adhere to the ashes. This\r\ngenerally happens if the button is already cold when it is taken out. If\r\nthe ashes do adhere to it, do not scrape it with a knife, lest some of\r\nit be lost and the assay be erroneous, but squeeze it with the iron\r\ntongs, so that the ashes drop off through the pressure. Finally, it is\r\nof advantage to make two or three assays of the same ore at the same\r\ntime, in order that if by chance one is not successful, the second, or\r\nin any event the third, may be certain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 241 (Shield for Muffle Furnace): A--Handle of tablet.\r\nB--Its crack.]\r\n\r\nWhile the assayer is assaying the ore, in order to prevent the great\r\nheat of the fire from injuring his eyes, it will be useful for him\r\nalways to have ready a thin wooden tablet, two palms wide, with a handle\r\nby which it may be held, and with a slit down the middle in order that\r\nhe may look through it as through a crack, since it is necessary for him\r\nto look frequently within and carefully to consider everything.\r\n\r\nNow the lead which has absorbed the silver from a metallic ore is\r\nconsumed in the cupel by the heat in the space of three quarters of an\r\nhour. When the assays are completed the muffle is taken out of the\r\nfurnace, and the ashes removed with an iron shovel, not only from the\r\nbrick and iron furnaces, but also from the earthen one, so that the\r\nfurnace need not be removed from its foundation.\r\n\r\nFrom ore placed in the triangular crucible a button is melted out, from\r\nwhich metal is afterward made. First of all, glowing charcoal is put\r\ninto the iron hoop, then is put in the triangular crucible, which\r\ncontains the ore together with those things which can liquefy it and\r\npurge it of its dross; then the fire is blown with the double bellows,\r\nand the ore is heated until the button settles in the bottom of the\r\ncrucible. We have explained that there are two methods of assaying\r\nore,--one, by which the lead is mixed with ore in the scorifier and\r\nafterward again separated from it in the cupel; the other, by which it\r\nis first melted in the triangular earthen crucible and afterward mixed\r\nwith lead in the scorifier, and later separated from it in the cupel.\r\nNow let us consider which is more suitable for each ore, or, if neither\r\nis suitable, by what other method in one way or another we can assay it.\r\n\r\nWe justly begin with a gold ore, which we assay by both methods, for if\r\nit is rich and seems not to be strongly resistant to fire, but to\r\nliquefy easily, one _centumpondium_ of it (known to us as the lesser\r\nweights),[27] together with one and a half, or two _unciae_ of lead of\r\nthe larger weights, are mixed together and placed in the scorifier, and\r\nthe two are heated in the fire until they are well mixed. But since such\r\nan ore sometimes resists melting, add a little salt to it, either _sal\r\ntorrefactus_ or _sal artificiosus_, for this will subdue it, and prevent\r\nthe alloy from collecting much dross; stir it frequently with an iron\r\nrod, in order that the lead may flow around the gold on every side, and\r\nabsorb it and cast out the waste. When this has been done, take out the\r\nalloy and cleanse it of slag; then place it in the cupel and heat it\r\nuntil it exhales all the lead, and a bead of gold settles in the bottom.\r\n\r\nIf the gold ore is seen not to be easily melted in the fire, roast it\r\nand extinguish it with brine. Do this again and again, for the more\r\noften you roast it and extinguish it, the more easily the ore can be\r\ncrushed fine, and the more quickly does it melt in the fire and give up\r\nwhatever dross it possesses. Mix one part of this ore, when it has been\r\nroasted, crushed, and washed, with three parts of some powder compound\r\nwhich melts ore, and six parts of lead. Put the charge into the\r\ntriangular crucible, place it in the iron hoop to which the double\r\nbellows reaches, and heat first in a slow fire, and afterward gradually\r\nin a fiercer fire, till it melts and flows like water. If the ore does\r\nnot melt, add to it a little more of these fluxes, mixed with an equal\r\nportion of yellow litharge, and stir it with a hot iron rod until it all\r\nmelts. Then take the crucible out of the hoop, shake off the button when\r\nit has cooled, and when it has been cleansed, melt first in the\r\nscorifier and afterward in the cupel. Finally, rub the gold which has\r\nsettled in the bottom of the cupel, after it has been taken out and\r\ncooled, on the touchstone, in order to find out what proportion of\r\nsilver it contains. Another method is to put a _centumpondium_ (of the\r\nlesser weights) of gold ore into the triangular crucible, and add to it\r\na _drachma_ (of the larger weights) of glass-galls. If it resists\r\nmelting, add half a _drachma_ of roasted argol, and if even then it\r\nresists, add the same quantity of roasted lees of vinegar, or lees of\r\nthe _aqua_ which separates gold from silver, and the button will settle\r\nin the bottom of the crucible. Melt this button again in the scorifier\r\nand a third time in the cupel.\r\n\r\nWe determine in the following way, before it is melted in the muffle\r\nfurnace, whether pyrites contains gold in it or not: if, after being\r\nthree times roasted and three times quenched in sharp vinegar, it has\r\nnot broken nor changed its colour, there is gold in it. The vinegar by\r\nwhich it is quenched should be mixed with salt that is put in it, and\r\nfrequently stirred and dissolved for three days. Nor is pyrites devoid\r\nof gold, when, after being roasted and then rubbed on the touchstone, it\r\ncolours the touchstone in the same way that it coloured it when rubbed\r\nin its crude state. Nor is gold lacking in that, whose concentrates from\r\nwashing, when heated in the fire, easily melt, giving forth little smell\r\nand remaining bright; such concentrates are heated in the fire in a\r\nhollowed piece of charcoal covered over with another charcoal.\r\n\r\nWe also assay gold ore without fire, but more often its sand or the\r\nconcentrates which have been made by washing, or the dust gathered up by\r\nsome other means. A little of it is slightly moistened with water and\r\nheated until it begins to exhale an odour, and then to one portion of\r\nore are placed two portions of quicksilver[28] in a wooden dish as deep\r\nas a basin. They are mixed together with a little brine, and are then\r\nground with a wooden pestle for the space of two hours, until the\r\nmixture becomes of the thickness of dough, and the quicksilver can no\r\nlonger be distinguished from the concentrates made by the washing, nor\r\nthe concentrates from the quicksilver. Warm, or at least tepid, water is\r\npoured into the dish and the material is washed until the water runs out\r\nclear. Afterward cold water is poured into the same dish, and soon the\r\nquicksilver, which has absorbed all the gold, runs together into a\r\nseparate place away from the rest of the concentrates made by washing.\r\nThe quicksilver is afterward separated from the gold by means of a pot\r\ncovered with soft leather, or with canvas made of woven threads of\r\ncotton; the amalgam is poured into the middle of the cloth or leather,\r\nwhich sags about one hand's breadth; next, the leather is folded over\r\nand tied with a waxed string, and the dish catches the quicksilver which\r\nis squeezed through it. As for the gold which remains in the leather, it\r\nis placed in a scorifier and purified by being placed near glowing\r\ncoals. Others do not wash away the dirt with warm water, but with strong\r\nlye and vinegar, for they pour these liquids into the pot, and also\r\nthrow into it the quicksilver mixed with the concentrates made by\r\nwashing. Then they set the pot in a warm place, and after twenty-four\r\nhours pour out the liquids with the dirt, and separate the quicksilver\r\nfrom the gold in the manner which I have described. Then they pour urine\r\ninto a jar set in the ground, and in the jar place a pot with holes in\r\nthe bottom, and in the pot they place the gold; then the lid is put on\r\nand cemented, and it is joined with the jar; they afterward heat it till\r\nthe pot glows red. After it has cooled, if there is copper in the gold\r\nthey melt it with lead in a cupel, that the copper may be separated from\r\nit; but if there is silver in the gold they separate them by means of\r\nthe _aqua_ which has the power of parting these two metals. There are\r\nsome who, when they separate gold from quicksilver, do not pour the\r\namalgam into a leather, but put it into a gourd-shaped earthen vessel,\r\nwhich they place in the furnace and heat gradually over burning\r\ncharcoal; next, with an iron plate, they cover the opening of the\r\noperculum, which exudes vapour, and as soon as it has ceased to exude,\r\nthey smear it with lute and heat it for a short time; then they remove\r\nthe operculum from the pot, and wipe off the quicksilver which adheres\r\nto it with a hare's foot, and preserve it for future use. By the latter\r\nmethod, a greater quantity of quicksilver is lost, and by the former\r\nmethod, a smaller quantity.\r\n\r\nIf an ore is rich in silver, as is _rudis_ silver[29], frequently silver\r\nglance, or rarely ruby silver, gray silver, black silver, brown silver,\r\nor yellow silver, as soon as it is cleansed and heated, a\r\n_centumpondium_ (of the lesser weights) of it is placed in an _uncia_ of\r\nmolten lead in a cupel, and is heated until the lead exhales. But if the\r\nore is of poor or moderate quality, it must first be dried, then\r\ncrushed, and then to a _centumpondium_ (of the lesser weights) an\r\n_uncia_ of lead is added, and it is heated in the scorifier until it\r\nmelts. If it is not soon melted by the fire, it should be sprinkled with\r\na little powder of the first order of fluxes, and if then it does not\r\nmelt, more is added little by little until it melts and exudes its slag;\r\nthat this result may be reached sooner, the powder which has been\r\nsprinkled over it should be stirred in with an iron rod. When the\r\nscorifier has been taken out of the assay furnace, the alloy should be\r\npoured into a hole in a baked brick; and when it has cooled and been\r\ncleansed of the slag, it should be placed in a cupel and heated until it\r\nexhales all its lead; the weight of silver which remains in the cupel\r\nindicates what proportion of silver is contained in the ore.\r\n\r\nWe assay copper ore without lead, for if it is melted with it, the\r\ncopper usually exhales and is lost. Therefore, a certain weight of such\r\nan ore is first roasted in a hot fire for about six or eight hours;\r\nnext, when it has cooled, it is crushed and washed; then the\r\nconcentrates made by washing are again roasted, crushed, washed, dried,\r\nand weighed. The portion which it has lost whilst it is being roasted\r\nand washed is taken into account, and these concentrates by washing\r\nrepresent the cake which will be melted out of the copper ore. Place\r\nthree _centumpondia_ (lesser weights) of this, mixed with three\r\n_centumpondia_ (lesser weights) each of copper scales[30], saltpetre,\r\nand Venetian glass, mixed, into the triangular crucible, and place it in\r\nthe iron hoop which is set on the hearth in front of the double bellows.\r\nCover the crucible with charcoal in such a way that nothing may fall\r\ninto the ore which is to be melted, and so that it may melt more\r\nquickly. At first blow a gentle blast with the bellows in order that the\r\nore may be heated gradually in the fire; then blow strongly till it\r\nmelts, and the fire consumes that which has been added to it, and the\r\nore itself exudes whatever slag it possesses. Next, cool the crucible\r\nwhich has been taken out, and when this is broken you will find the\r\ncopper; weigh this, in order to ascertain how great a portion of the ore\r\nthe fire has consumed. Some ore is only once roasted, crushed, and\r\nwashed; and of this kind of concentrates, three _centumpondia_ (lesser\r\nweights) are taken with one _centumpondium_ each of common salt, argol\r\nand glass-galls. Heat them in the triangular crucible, and when the\r\nmixture has cooled a button of pure copper will be found, if the ore is\r\nrich in this metal. If, however, it is less rich, a stony lump results,\r\nwith which the copper is intermixed; this lump is again roasted,\r\ncrushed, and, after adding stones which easily melt and saltpetre, it is\r\nagain melted in another crucible, and there settles in the bottom of the\r\ncrucible a button of pure copper. If you wish to know what proportion of\r\nsilver is in this copper button, melt it in a cupel after adding lead.\r\nWith regard to this test I will speak later.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to know quickly what portion of silver the copper ore\r\ncontains, roast the ore, crush and wash it, then mix a little yellow\r\nlitharge with one _centumpondium_ (lesser weights) of the concentrates,\r\nand put the mixture into a scorifier, which they place under the muffle\r\nin a hot furnace for the space of half an hour. When the slag exudes, by\r\nreason of the melting force which is in the litharge, they take the\r\nscorifier out; when it has cooled, they cleanse it of slag and again\r\ncrush it, and with one _centumpondium_ of it they mix one and a half\r\n_unciae_ of lead granules. They then put it into another scorifier,\r\nwhich they place under the muffle in a hot furnace, adding to the\r\nmixture a little of the powder of some one of the fluxes which cause ore\r\nto melt; when it has melted they take it out, and after it has cooled,\r\ncleanse it of slag; lastly, they heat it in the cupel till it has\r\nexhaled all of the lead, and only silver remains.\r\n\r\nLead ore may be assayed by this method: crush half an _uncia_ of pure\r\nlead-stone and the same quantity of the _chrysocolla_ which they call\r\nborax, mix them together, place them in a crucible, and put a glowing\r\ncoal in the middle of it. As soon as the borax crackles and the\r\nlead-stone melts, which soon occurs, remove the coal from the crucible,\r\nand the lead will settle to the bottom of it; weigh it out, and take\r\naccount of that portion of it which the fire has consumed. If you also\r\nwish to know what portion of silver is contained in the lead, melt the\r\nlead in the cupel until all of it exhales.\r\n\r\nAnother way is to roast the lead ore, of whatsoever quality it be, wash\r\nit, and put into the crucible one _centumpondium_ of the concentrates,\r\ntogether with three _centumpondia_ of the powdered compound which melts\r\nore, mixed together, and place it in the iron hoop that it may melt;\r\nwhen it has cooled, cleanse it of its slag, and complete the test as I\r\nhave already said. Another way is to take two _unciae_ of prepared ore,\r\nfive _drachmae_ of roasted copper, one _uncia_ of glass, or glass-galls\r\nreduced to powder, a _semi-uncia_ of salt, and mix them. Put the mixture\r\ninto the triangular crucible, and heat it over a gentle fire to prevent\r\nit from breaking; when the mixture has melted, blow the fire vigorously\r\nwith the bellows; then take the crucible off the live coals and let it\r\ncool in the open air; do not pour water on it, lest the lead button\r\nbeing acted upon by the excessive cold should become mixed with the\r\nslag, and the assay in this way be erroneous. When the crucible has\r\ncooled, you will find in the bottom of it the lead button. Another way\r\nis to take two _unciae_ of ore, a _semi-uncia_ of litharge, two\r\n_drachmae_ of Venetian glass and a _semi-uncia_ of saltpetre. If there\r\nis difficulty in melting the ore, add to it iron filings, which, since\r\nthey increase the heat, easily separate the waste from lead and other\r\nmetals. By the last way, lead ore properly prepared is placed in the\r\ncrucible, and there is added to it only the sand made from stones which\r\neasily melt, or iron filings, and then the assay is completed as\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nYou can assay tin ore by the following method. First roast it, then\r\ncrush, and afterward wash it; the concentrates are again roasted,\r\ncrushed, and washed. Mix one and a half _centumpondia_ of this with one\r\n_centumpondium_ of the _chrysocolla_ which they call borax; from the\r\nmixture, when it has been moistened with water, make a lump. Afterwards,\r\nperforate a large round piece of charcoal, making this opening a palm\r\ndeep, three digits wide on the upper side and narrower on the lower\r\nside; when the charcoal is put in its place the latter should be on the\r\nbottom and the former uppermost. Let it be placed in a crucible, and let\r\nglowing coal be put round it on all sides; when the perforated piece of\r\ncoal begins to burn, the lump is placed in the upper part of the\r\nopening, and it is covered with a wide piece of glowing coal, and after\r\nmany pieces of coal have been put round it, a hot fire is blown up with\r\nthe bellows, until all the tin has run out of the lower opening of the\r\ncharcoal into the crucible. Another way is to take a large piece of\r\ncharcoal, hollow it out, and smear it with lute, that the ore may not\r\nleap out when white hot. Next, make a small hole through the middle of\r\nit, then fill up the large opening with small charcoal, and put the ore\r\nupon this; put fire in the small hole and blow the fire with the nozzle\r\nof a hand bellows; place the piece of charcoal in a small crucible,\r\nsmeared with lute, in which, when the melting is finished, you will find\r\na button of tin.\r\n\r\nIn assaying bismuth ore, place pieces of ore in the scorifier, and put\r\nit under the muffle in a hot furnace; as soon as they are heated, they\r\ndrip with bismuth, which runs together into a button.\r\n\r\nQuicksilver ore is usually tested by mixing one part of broken ore with\r\nthree-parts of charcoal dust and a handful of salt. Put the mixture into\r\na crucible or a pot or a jar, cover it with a lid, seal it with lute,\r\nplace it on glowing charcoal, and as soon as a burnt cinnabar colour\r\nshows in it, take out the vessel; for if you continue the heat too long\r\nthe mixture exhales the quicksilver with the fumes. The quicksilver\r\nitself, when it has become cool, is found in the bottom of the crucible\r\nor other vessel. Another way is to place broken ore in a gourd-shaped\r\nearthen vessel, put it in the assay furnace, and cover with an operculum\r\nwhich has a long spout; under the spout, put an ampulla to receive the\r\nquicksilver which distills. Cold water should be poured into the\r\nampulla, so that the quicksilver which has been heated by the fire may\r\nbe continuously cooled and gathered together, for the quicksilver is\r\nborne over by the force of the fire, and flows down through the spout of\r\nthe operculum into the ampulla. We also assay quicksilver ore in the\r\nvery same way in which we smelt it. This I will explain in its proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nLastly, we assay iron ore in the forge of a blacksmith. Such ore is\r\nburned, crushed, washed, and dried; a magnet is laid over the\r\nconcentrates, and the particles of iron are attracted to it; these are\r\nwiped off with a brush, and are caught in a crucible, the magnet being\r\ncontinually passed over the concentrates and the particles wiped off, so\r\nlong as there remain any particles which the magnet can attract to it.\r\nThese particles are heated in the crucible with saltpetre until they\r\nmelt, and an iron button is melted out of them. If the magnet easily and\r\nquickly attracts the particles to it, we infer that the ore is rich in\r\niron; if slowly, that it is poor; if it appears actually to repel the\r\nore, then it contains little or no iron. This is enough for the assaying\r\nof ores.\r\n\r\nI will now speak of the assaying of the metal alloys. This is done both\r\nby coiners and merchants who buy and sell metal, and by miners, but most\r\nof all by the owners and mine masters, and by the owners and masters of\r\nthe works in which the metals are smelted, or in which one metal is\r\nparted from another.\r\n\r\nFirst I will describe the way assays are usually made to ascertain what\r\nportion of precious metal is contained in base metal. Gold and silver\r\nare now reckoned as precious metals and all the others as base metals.\r\nOnce upon a time the base metals were burned up, in order that the\r\nprecious metals should be left pure; the Ancients even discovered by\r\nsuch burning what portion of gold was contained in silver, and in this\r\nway all the silver was consumed, which was no small loss. However, the\r\nfamous mathematician, Archimedes[31], to gratify King Hiero, invented a\r\nmethod of testing the silver, which was not very rapid, and was more\r\naccurate for testing a large mass than a small one. This I will explain\r\nin my commentaries. The alchemists have shown us a way of separating\r\nsilver from gold by which neither of them is lost[32].\r\n\r\nGold which contains silver,[33] or silver which contains gold, is first\r\nrubbed on the touchstone. Then a needle in which there is a similar\r\namount of gold or silver is rubbed on the same touchstone, and from the\r\nlines which are produced in this way, is perceived what portion of\r\nsilver there is in the gold, or what portion of gold there is in the\r\nsilver. Next there is added to the silver which is in the gold, enough\r\nsilver to make it three times as much as the gold. Then lead is placed\r\nin a cupel and melted; a little later, a small amount of copper is put\r\nin it, in fact, half an _uncia_ of it, or half an _uncia_ and a\r\n_sicilicus_ (of the smaller weights) if the gold or silver does not\r\ncontain any copper. The cupel, when the lead and copper are wanting,\r\nattracts the particles of gold and silver, and absorbs them. Finally,\r\none-third of a _libra_ of the gold, and one _libra_[34] of the silver\r\nmust be placed together in the same cupel and melted; for if the gold\r\nand silver were first placed in the cupel and melted, as I have already\r\nsaid, it absorbs particles of them, and the gold, when separated from\r\nthe silver, will not be found pure. These metals are heated until the\r\nlead and the copper are consumed, and again, the same weight of each is\r\nmelted in the same manner in another cupel. The buttons are pounded with\r\na hammer and flattened out, and each little leaf is shaped in the form\r\nof a tube, and each is put into a small glass ampulla. Over these there\r\nis poured one _uncia_ and one _drachma_ (of the large weight) of the\r\nthird quality _aqua valens_, which I will describe in the Tenth Book.\r\nThis is heated over a slow fire, and small bubbles, resembling pearls in\r\nshape, will be seen to adhere to the tubes. The redder the _aqua_\r\nappears, the better it is judged to be; when the redness has vanished,\r\nsmall white bubbles are seen to be resting on the tubes, resembling\r\npearls not only in shape, but also in colour. After a short time the\r\n_aqua_ is poured off and other is poured on; when this has again raised\r\nsix or eight small white bubbles, it is poured off and the tubes are\r\ntaken out and washed four or five times with spring water; or if they\r\nare heated with the same water, when it is boiling, they will shine more\r\nbrilliantly. Then they are placed in a saucer, which is held in the hand\r\nand gradually dried by the gentle heat of the fire; afterward the saucer\r\nis placed over glowing charcoal and covered with a charcoal, and a\r\nmoderate blast is blown upon it with the mouth and then a blue flame\r\nwill be emitted. In the end the tubes are weighed, and if their weights\r\nprove equal, he who has undertaken this work has not laboured in vain.\r\nLastly, both are placed in another balance-pan and weighed; of each tube\r\nfour grains must not be counted, on account of the silver which remains\r\nin the gold and cannot be separated from it. From the weight of the\r\ntubes we learn the weight both of the gold and of the silver which is in\r\nthe button. If some assayer has omitted to add so much silver to the\r\ngold as to make it three times the quantity, but only double, or two and\r\na half times as much, he will require the stronger quality of _aqua_\r\nwhich separates gold from silver, such as the fourth quality. Whether\r\nthe _aqua_ which he employs for gold and silver is suitable for the\r\npurpose, or whether it is more or less strong than is right, is\r\nrecognised by its effect. That of medium strength raises the little\r\nbubbles on the tubes and is found to colour the ampulla and the\r\noperculum a strong red; the weaker one is found to colour them a light\r\nred, and the stronger one to break the tubes. To pure silver in which\r\nthere is some portion of gold, nothing should be added when they are\r\nbeing heated in the cupel prior to their being parted, except a _bes_ of\r\nlead and one-fourth or one-third its amount of copper of the lesser\r\nweights. If the silver contains in itself a certain amount of copper,\r\nlet it be weighed, both after it has been melted with the lead, and\r\nafter the gold has been parted from it; by the former we learn how much\r\ncopper is in it, by the latter how much gold. Base metals are burnt up\r\neven to-day for the purpose of assay, because to lose so little of the\r\nmetal is small loss, but from a large mass of base metal, the precious\r\nmetal is always extracted, as I will explain in Books X. and XI.\r\n\r\nWe assay an alloy of copper and silver in the following way. From a few\r\ncakes of copper the assayer cuts out portions, small samples from small\r\ncakes, medium samples from medium cakes, and large samples from large\r\ncakes; the small ones are equal in size to half a hazel nut, the large\r\nones do not exceed the size of half a chestnut, and those of medium size\r\ncome between the two. He cuts out the samples from the middle of the\r\nbottom of each cake. He places the samples in a new, clean, triangular\r\ncrucible and fixes to them pieces of paper upon which are written the\r\nweight of the cakes of copper, of whatever size they may be; for\r\nexample, he writes, \"These samples have been cut from copper which\r\nweighs twenty _centumpondia_.\" When he wishes to know how much silver\r\none _centumpondium_ of copper of this kind has in it, first of all he\r\nthrows glowing coals into the iron hoop, then adds charcoal to it. When\r\nthe fire has become hot, the paper is taken out of the crucible and put\r\naside, he then sets that crucible on the fire and gradually heats it for\r\na quarter of an hour until it becomes red hot. Then he stimulates the\r\nfire by blowing with a blast from the double bellows for half an hour,\r\nbecause copper which is devoid of lead requires this time to become hot\r\nand to melt; copper not devoid of lead melts quicker. When he has blown\r\nthe bellows for about the space of time stated, he removes the glowing\r\ncharcoal with the tongs, and stirs the copper with a splinter of wood,\r\nwhich he grasps with the tongs. If it does not stir easily, it is a sign\r\nthat the copper is not wholly liquefied; if he finds this is the case,\r\nhe again places a large piece of charcoal in the crucible, and replaces\r\nthe glowing charcoal which had been removed, and again blows the bellows\r\nfor a short time. When all the copper has melted he stops using the\r\nbellows, for if he were to continue to use them, the fire would consume\r\npart of the copper, and then that which remained would be richer than\r\nthe cake from which it had been cut; this is no small mistake.\r\nTherefore, as soon as the copper has become sufficiently liquefied, he\r\npours it out into a little iron mould, which may be large or small,\r\naccording as more or less copper is melted in the crucible for the\r\npurpose of the assay. The mould has a handle, likewise made of iron, by\r\nwhich it is held when the copper is poured in, after which, he plunges\r\nit into a tub of water placed near at hand, that the copper may be\r\ncooled. Then he again dries the copper by the fire, and cuts off its\r\npoint with an iron wedge; the portion nearest the point he hammers on an\r\nanvil and makes into a leaf, which he cuts into pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 250 (Copper Mould for Assaying): A--Iron mould. B--Its\r\nhandle.]\r\n\r\nOthers stir the molten copper with a stick of linden tree charcoal, and\r\nthen pour it over a bundle of new clean birch twigs, beneath which is\r\nplaced a wooden tub of sufficient size and full of water, and in this\r\nmanner the copper is broken up into little granules as small as hemp\r\nseeds. Others employ straw in place of twigs. Others place a broad stone\r\nin a tub and pour in enough water to cover the stone, then they run out\r\nthe molten copper from the crucible on to the stone, from which the\r\nminute granules roll off; others pour the molten copper into water and\r\nstir it until it is resolved into granules. The fire does not easily\r\nmelt the copper in the cupel unless it has been poured and a thin leaf\r\nmade of it, or unless it has been resolved into granules or made into\r\nfilings; and if it does not melt, all the labour has been undertaken in\r\nvain. In order that they may be accurately weighed out, silver and lead\r\nare resolved into granules in the same manner as copper. But to return\r\nto the assay of copper. When the copper has been prepared by these\r\nmethods, if it is free of lead and iron, and rich in silver, to each\r\n_centumpondium_ (lesser weights) add one and a half _unciae_ of lead\r\n(larger weights). If, however, the copper contains some lead, add one\r\n_uncia_ of lead; if it contains iron, add two _unciae_. First put the\r\nlead into a cupel, and after it begins to smoke, add the copper; the\r\nfire generally consumes the copper, together with the lead, in about one\r\nhour and a quarter. When this is done, the silver will be found in the\r\nbottom of the cupel. The fire consumes both of those metals more quickly\r\nif they are heated in that furnace which draws in air. It is better to\r\ncover the upper half of it with a lid, and not only to put on the muffle\r\ndoor, but also to close the window of the muffle door with a piece of\r\ncharcoal, or with a piece of brick. If the copper be such that the\r\nsilver can only be separated from it with difficulty, then before it is\r\ntested with fire in the cupel, lead should first be put into the\r\nscorifier, and then the copper should be added with a moderate quantity\r\nof melted salt, both that the lead may absorb the copper and that the\r\ncopper may be cleansed of the dross which abounds in it.\r\n\r\nTin which contains silver should not at the beginning of the assay be\r\nplaced in a cupel, lest the silver, as often happens, be consumed and\r\nconverted into fumes, together with the tin. As soon as the lead[35] has\r\nbegun to fume in the scorifier, then add that[36] to it. In this way the\r\nlead will take the silver and the tin will boil and turn into ashes,\r\nwhich may be removed with a wooden splinter. The same thing occurs if\r\nany alloy is melted in which there is tin. When the lead has absorbed\r\nthe silver which was in the tin, then, and not till then, it is heated\r\nin the cupel. First place the lead with which the silver is mixed, in an\r\niron pan, and stand it on a hot furnace and let it melt; afterward pour\r\nthis lead into a small iron mould, and then beat it out with a hammer on\r\nan anvil and make it into leaves in the same way as the copper. Lastly,\r\nplace it in the cupel, which assay can be carried out in the space of\r\nhalf an hour. A great heat is harmful to it, for which reason there is\r\nno necessity either to cover the half of the furnace with a lid or to\r\nclose up its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe minted metal alloys, which are known as money, are assayed in the\r\nfollowing way. The smaller silver coins which have been picked out from\r\nthe bottom and top and sides of a heap are first carefully cleansed;\r\nthen, after they have been melted in the triangular crucible, they are\r\neither resolved into granules, or made into thin leaves. As for the\r\nlarge coins which weigh a _drachma_, a _sicilicus_, half an _uncia_, or\r\nan _uncia_, beat them into leaves. Then take a _bes_ of the granules, or\r\nan equal weight of the leaves, and likewise take another _bes_ in the\r\nsame way. Wrap each sample separately in paper, and afterwards place two\r\nsmall pieces of lead in two cupels which have first been heated. The\r\nmore precious the money is, the smaller portion of lead do we require\r\nfor the assay, the more base, the larger is the portion required; for if\r\na _bes_ of silver is said to contain only half an _uncia_ or one _uncia_\r\nof copper, we add to the _bes_ of granules half an _uncia_ of lead. If\r\nit is composed of equal parts of silver and copper, we add an _uncia_ of\r\nlead, but if in a _bes_ of copper there is only half an _uncia_ or one\r\n_uncia_ of silver, we add an _uncia_ and a half of lead. As soon as the\r\nlead has begun to fume, put into each cupel one of the papers in which\r\nis wrapped the sample of silver alloyed with copper, and close the mouth\r\nof the muffle with charcoal. Heat them with a gentle fire until all the\r\nlead and copper are consumed, for a hot fire by its heat forces the\r\nsilver, combined with a certain portion of lead, into the cupel, in\r\nwhich way the assay is rendered erroneous. Then take the beads out of\r\nthe cupel and clean them of dross. If neither depresses the pan of the\r\nbalance in which it is placed, but their weight is equal, the assay has\r\nbeen free from error; but if one bead depresses its pan, then there is\r\nan error, for which reason the assay must be repeated. If the _bes_ of\r\ncoin contains but seven _unciae_ of pure silver it is because the King,\r\nor Prince, or the State who coins the money, has taken one _uncia_,\r\nwhich he keeps partly for profit and partly for the expense of coining,\r\nhe having added copper to the silver. Of all these matters I have\r\nwritten extensively in my book _De Precio Metallorum et Monetis_.\r\n\r\nWe assay gold coins in various ways. If there is copper mixed with the\r\ngold, we melt them by fire in the same way as silver coins; if there is\r\nsilver mixed with the gold, they are separated by the strongest _aqua\r\nvalens_; if there is copper and silver mixed with the gold, then in the\r\nfirst place, after the addition of lead, they are heated in the cupel\r\nuntil the fire consumes the copper and the lead, and afterward the gold\r\nis parted from the silver.\r\n\r\nIt remains to speak of the touchstone[37] with which gold and silver are\r\ntested, and which was also used by the Ancients. For although the assay\r\nmade by fire is more certain, still, since we often have no furnace, nor\r\nmuffle, nor crucibles, or some delay must be occasioned in using them,\r\nwe can always rub gold or silver on the touchstone, which we can have in\r\nreadiness. Further, when gold coins are assayed in the fire, of what use\r\nare they afterward? A touchstone must be selected which is thoroughly\r\nblack and free of sulphur, for the blacker it is and the more devoid of\r\nsulphur, the better it generally is; I have written elsewhere of its\r\nnature[38]. First the gold is rubbed on the touchstone, whether it\r\ncontains silver or whether it is obtained from the mines or from the\r\nsmelting; silver also is rubbed in the same way. Then one of the\r\nneedles, that we judge by its colour to be of similar composition, is\r\nrubbed on the touchstone; if this proves too pale, another needle which\r\nhas a stronger colour is rubbed on the touchstone; and if this proves\r\ntoo deep in colour, a third which has a little paler colour is used. For\r\nthis will show us how great a proportion of silver or copper, or silver\r\nand copper together, is in the gold, or else how great a proportion of\r\ncopper is in silver.\r\n\r\nThese needles are of four kinds.[39] The first kind are made of gold and\r\nsilver, the second of gold and copper, the third of gold, silver, and\r\ncopper, and the fourth of silver and copper. The first three kinds of\r\nneedles are used principally for testing gold, and the fourth for\r\nsilver. Needles of this kind are prepared in the following ways. The\r\nlesser weights correspond proportionately to the larger weights, and\r\nboth of them are used, not only by mining people, but by coiners also.\r\nThe needles are made in accordance with the lesser weights, and each set\r\ncorresponds to a _bes_, which, in our own vocabulary, is called a\r\n_mark_. The _bes_, which is employed by those who coin gold, is divided\r\ninto twenty-four double _sextulae_, which are now called after the\r\nGreek name _ceratia_; and each double _sextula_ is divided into four\r\n_semi-sextulae_, which are called _granas_; and each _semi-sextula_ is\r\ndivided into three units of four _siliquae_ each, of which each unit is\r\ncalled a _grenlin_. If we made the needles to be each four _siliquae_,\r\nthere would be two hundred and eighty-eight in a _bes_, but if each were\r\nmade to be a _semi-sextula_ or a double _scripula_, then there would be\r\nninety-six in a _bes_. By these two methods too many needles would be\r\nmade, and the majority of them, by reason of the small difference in the\r\nproportion of the gold, would indicate nothing, therefore it is\r\nadvisable to make them each of a double _sextula_; in this way\r\ntwenty-four needles are made, of which the first is made of twenty-three\r\n_duellae_ of silver and one of gold. Fannius is our authority that the\r\nAncients called the double _sextula_ a _duella_. When a bar of silver is\r\nrubbed on the touchstone and colours it just as this needle does, it\r\ncontains one _duella_ of gold. In this manner we determine by the other\r\nneedles what proportion of gold there is, or when the gold exceeds the\r\nsilver in weight, what proportion of silver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 255 (Touch-needles)]\r\n\r\nThe needles are made[40]:--\r\n\r\n  The 1st needle of 23 _duellae_ of silver and 1 _duella_ of gold.\r\n   \"  2nd    \"      22    \"          \"         2 _duellae_ of gold.\r\n   \"  3rd    \"      21    \"          \"         3      \"        \"\r\n   \"  4th    \"      20    \"          \"         4      \"        \"\r\n   \"  5th    \"      19    \"          \"         5      \"        \"\r\n   \"  6th    \"      18    \"          \"         6      \"        \"\r\n   \"  7th    \"      17    \"          \"         7      \"        \"\r\n   \"  8th    \"      16    \"          \"         8      \"        \"\r\n   \"  9th    \"      15    \"          \"         9      \"        \"\r\n   \"  10th   \"      14    \"          \"        10      \"        \"\r\n   \"  11th   \"      13    \"          \"        11      \"        \"\r\n   \"  12th   \"      12    \"          \"        12      \"        \"\r\n   \"  13th   \"      11    \"          \"        13      \"        \"\r\n   \"  14th   \"      10    \"          \"        14      \"        \"\r\n   \"  15th   \"       9    \"          \"        15      \"        \"\r\n   \"  16th   \"       8    \"          \"        16      \"        \"\r\n   \"  17th   \"       7    \"          \"        17      \"        \"\r\n   \"  18th   \"       6    \"          \"        18      \"        \"\r\n   \"  19th   \"       5    \"          \"        19      \"        \"\r\n   \"  20th   \"       4    \"          \"        20      \"        \"\r\n   \"  21st   \"       3    \"          \"        21      \"        \"\r\n   \"  22nd   \"       2    \"          \"        22      \"        \"\r\n   \"  23rd   \"       1    \"          \"        23      \"        \"\r\n   \"  24th   \"       pure gold\r\n\r\nBy the first eleven needles, when they are rubbed on the touchstone, we\r\ntest what proportion of gold a bar of silver contains, and with the\r\nremaining thirteen we test what proportion of silver is in a bar of\r\ngold; and also what proportion of either may be in money.\r\n\r\nSince some gold coins are composed of gold and copper, thirteen needles\r\nof another kind are made as follows:--\r\n\r\n  The 1st of 12 _duellae_ of gold and 12 _duellae_ of copper.\r\n   \"  2nd  \" 13    \"          \"       11    \"           \"\r\n   \"  3rd  \" 14    \"          \"       10    \"           \"\r\n   \"  4th  \" 15    \"          \"        9    \"           \"\r\n   \"  5th  \" 16    \"          \"        8    \"           \"\r\n   \"  6th  \" 17    \"          \"        7    \"           \"\r\n   \"  7th  \" 18    \"          \"        6    \"           \"\r\n   \"  8th  \" 19    \"          \"        5    \"           \"\r\n   \"  9th  \" 20    \"          \"        4    \"           \"\r\n   \" 10th  \" 21    \"          \"        3    \"           \"\r\n   \" 11th  \" 22    \"          \"        2    \"           \"\r\n   \" 12th  \" 23    \"          \"        1    \"           \"\r\n   \" 13th  \" pure gold.\r\n\r\nThese needles are not much used, because gold coins of that kind are\r\nsomewhat rare; the ones chiefly used are those in which there is much\r\ncopper. Needles of the third kind, which are composed of gold, silver,\r\nand copper, are more largely used, because such gold coins are common.\r\nBut since with the gold there are mixed equal or unequal portions of\r\nsilver and copper, two sorts of needles are made. If the proportion of\r\nsilver and copper is equal, the needles are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                Gold.               Silver.

Of these\r\nneedles, the first is composed of twelve _duellae_ of gold and six of\r\nsilver, and the same number of copper. The second, of twelve _duellae_\r\nand one _sextula_ of gold and five _duellae_ and one and a half\r\n_sextulae_ of silver, and the same number of _duellae_ and one and a\r\nhalf _sextulae_ of copper.

The _bes_ by\r\nwhich we weigh the silver is divided in two different ways. It is either\r\ndivided twelve times, into units of five _drachmae_ and one _scripulum_\r\neach, which the ordinary people call _nummi_[41]; each of these units\r\nwe again divide into twenty-four units of four _siliquae_ each, which\r\nthe same ordinary people call a _grenlin_; or else the _bes_ is divided\r\ninto sixteen _semunciae_ which are called _loths_, each of which is\r\nagain divided into eighteen units of four _siliquae_ each, which they\r\ncall _grenlin_. Or else the _bes_ is divided into sixteen _semunciae_,\r\nof which each is divided into four _drachmae_, and each _drachma_ into\r\nfour _pfennige_. Needles are made in accordance with each method of\r\ndividing the _bes_. According to the first method, to the number of\r\ntwenty-four half _nummi_; according to the second method, to the number\r\nof thirty-one half _semunciae_, that is to say a _sicilicus_; for if the\r\nneedles were made to the number of the smaller weights, the number of\r\nneedles would again be too large, and not a few of them, by reason of\r\nthe small difference in proportion of silver or copper, would have no\r\nsignificance. We test both bars and coined money composed of silver and\r\ncopper by both scales. The one is as follows: the first needle is made\r\nof twenty-three parts of copper and one part silver; whereby, whatsoever\r\nbar or coin, when rubbed on the touchstone, colours it just as this\r\nneedle does, in that bar or money there is one twenty-fourth part of\r\nsilver, and so also, in accordance with the proportion of silver, is\r\nknown the remaining proportion of the copper.\r\n\r\n  The 1st needle is made of 23 parts of copper and 1 of silver.\r\n   \" 2nd    \"        \"      22   \"        \"        2      \"\r\n   \" 3rd    \"        \"      21   \"        \"        3      \"\r\n   \" 4th    \"        \"      20   \"        \"        4      \"\r\n   \" 5th    \"        \"      19   \"        \"        5      \"\r\n   \" 6th    \"        \"      18   \"        \"        6      \"\r\n   \" 7th    \"        \"      17   \"        \"        7      \"\r\n   \" 8th    \"        \"      16   \"        \"        8      \"\r\n   \" 9th    \"        \"      15   \"        \"        9      \"\r\n   \" 10th   \"        \"      14   \"        \"       10      \"\r\n   \" 11th   \"        \"      13   \"        \"       11      \"\r\n   \" 12th   \"        \"      12   \"        \"       12      \"\r\n   \" 13th   \"        \"      11   \"        \"       13      \"\r\n   \" 14th   \"        \"      10   \"        \"       14      \"\r\n   \" 15th   \"        \"       9   \"        \"       15      \"\r\n   \" 16th   \"        \"       8   \"        \"       16      \"\r\n   \" 17th   \"        \"       7   \"        \"       17      \"\r\n   \" 18th   \"        \"       6   \"        \"       18      \"\r\n   \" 19th   \"        \"       5   \"        \"       19      \"\r\n   \" 20th   \"        \"       4   \"        \"       20      \"\r\n   \" 21st   \"        \"       3   \"        \"       21      \"\r\n   \" 22nd   \"        \"       2   \"        \"       22      \"\r\n   \" 23rd   \"        \"       1   \"        \"       23      \"\r\n   \" 24th of pure silver.\r\n\r\nThe other method of making needles is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                        Copper.

Perhaps I have used more words than those most highly\r\nskilled in the art may require, but it is necessary for the\r\nunderstanding of these matters.\r\n\r\nI will now speak of the weights, of which I have frequently made\r\nmention. Among mining people these are of two kinds, that is, the\r\ngreater weights and the lesser weights. The _centumpondium_ is the first\r\nand largest weight, and of course consists of one hundred _librae_, and\r\nfor that reason is called a hundred weight.\r\n\r\nThe various weights are:--\r\n\r\n  1st = 100 _librae_ = _centumpondium_.\r\n  2nd =  50     \"\r\n  3rd =  25     \"\r\n  4th =  16     \"\r\n  5th =   8     \"\r\n  6th =   4     \"\r\n  7th =   2     \"\r\n  8th =   1 _libra_.\r\n\r\nThis _libra_ consists of sixteen _unciae_, and the half part of the\r\n_libra_ is the _selibra_, which our people call a _mark_, and consists\r\nof eight _unciae_, or, as they divide it, of sixteen _semunciae_:--\r\n\r\n   9th = 8 _unciae_.\r\n  10th = 8 _semunciae_.\r\n  11th = 4     \"\r\n  12th = 2     \"\r\n  13th = 1 _semuncia_.\r\n  14th = 1 _sicilicus_.\r\n  15th = 1 _drachma_.\r\n  16th = 1 _dimidi-drachma_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 262 (Weights for Assay Balances)]\r\n\r\nThe above is how the \"greater\" weights are divided. The \"lesser\" weights\r\nare made of silver or brass or copper. Of these, the first and largest\r\ngenerally weighs one _drachma_, for it is necessary for us to weigh, not\r\nonly ore, but also metals to be assayed, and smaller quantities of lead.\r\nThe first of these weights is called a _centumpondium_ and the number of\r\n_librae_ in it corresponds to the larger scale, being likewise one\r\nhundred[42].\r\n\r\n  The  1st is called  1 _centumpondium_.\r\n   \"   2nd    \"      50 _librae_.\r\n   \"   3rd    \"      25     \"\r\n   \"   4th    \"      16     \"\r\n   \"   5th    \"       8     \"\r\n   \"   6th    \"       4     \"\r\n   \"   7th    \"       2     \"\r\n   \"   8th    \"       1     \"\r\n   \"   9th    \"       1 _selibra_.\r\n   \"  10th    \"       8 _semunciae_.\r\n   \"  11th    \"       4     \"\r\n   \"  12th    \"       2     \"\r\n   \"  13th    \"       1     \"\r\n   \"  14th    \"       1 _sicilicus_.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth is the last, for the proportionate weights which\r\ncorrespond with a _drachma_ and half a _drachma_ are not used. On all\r\nthese weights of the lesser scale, are written the numbers of _librae_\r\nand of _semunciae_. Some copper assayers divide both the lesser and\r\ngreater scale weights into divisions of a different scale. Their largest\r\nweight of the greater scale weighs one hundred and twelve _librae_,\r\nwhich is the first unit of measurement.\r\n\r\n   1st  = 112 _librae_.\r\n   2nd  =  64     \"\r\n   3rd  =  32     \"\r\n   4th  =  16     \"\r\n   5th  =   8     \"\r\n   6th  =   4     \"\r\n   7th  =   2     \"\r\n   8th  =   1     \"\r\n   9th  =   1 _selibra_ or sixteen _semunciae_.\r\n  10th  =   8 _semunciae_.\r\n  11th  =   4     \"\r\n  12th  =   2     \"\r\n  13th  =   1     \"\r\n\r\nAs for the _selibra_ of the lesser weights, which our people, as I have\r\noften said, call a _mark_, and the Romans call a _bes_, coiners who coin\r\ngold, divide it just like the greater weights scale, into twenty-four\r\nunits of two _sextulae_ each, and each unit of two _sextulae_ is divided\r\ninto four _semi-sextulae_ and each _semi-sextula_ into three units of\r\nfour _siliquae_ each. Some also divide the separate units of four\r\n_siliquae_ into four individual _siliquae_, but most, omitting the\r\n_semi-sextulae_, then divide the double _sextula_ into twelve units of\r\nfour _siliquae_ each, and do not divide these into four individual\r\n_siliquae_. Thus the first and greatest unit of measurement, which is\r\nthe _bes_, weighs twenty-four double _sextulae_.\r\n\r\n  The 2nd = 12 double _sextulae_.\r\n   \"  3rd =  6   \"          \"\r\n   \"  4th =  3   \"          \"\r\n   \"  5th =  2   \"          \"\r\n   \"  6th =  1   \"          \"\r\n   \"  7th =  2 _semi-sextulae_ or four _semi-sextulae_.\r\n   \"  8th =  1 _semi-sextula_ or 3 units of 4 _siliquae_ each.\r\n   \"  9th =  2 units of four _siliquae_ each.\r\n   \" 10th =  1   \"       \"     \"\r\n\r\nCoiners who mint silver also divide the _bes_ of the lesser weights in\r\nthe same way as the greater weights; our people, indeed, divide it into\r\nsixteen _semunciae_, and the _semuncia_ into eighteen units of four\r\n_siliquae_ each.\r\n\r\nThere are ten weights which are placed in the other pan of the balance,\r\nwhen they weigh the silver which remains from the copper that has been\r\nconsumed, when they assay the alloy with fire.\r\n\r\n  The 1st = 16 _semunciae_ = 1 _bes_.\r\n   \"  2nd =  8       \"\r\n   \"  3rd =  4       \"\r\n   \"  4th =  2       \"\r\n   \"  5th =  1       \"   or 18 units of 4 _siliquae_ each.\r\n   \"  6th =  9 units of 4 _siliquae_ each.\r\n   \"  7th =  6       \"       \"\r\n   \"  8th =  3       \"       \"\r\n   \"  9th =  2       \"       \"\r\n   \" 10th =  1       \"       \"\r\n\r\nThe coiners of Nuremberg who mint silver, divide the _bes_ into sixteen\r\n_semunciae_, but divide the _semuncia_ into four _drachmae_, and the\r\n_drachma_ into four _pfennige_. They employ nine weights.\r\n\r\n  The 1st = 16 _semunciae_.\r\n   \"  2nd =  8       \"\r\n   \"  3rd =  4       \"\r\n   \"  4th =  2       \"\r\n   \"  5th =  1       \"\r\n\r\nFor they divide the _bes_ in the same way as our own people, but since\r\nthey divide the _semuncia_ into four _drachmae_,\r\n\r\n  the 6th weight = 2 _drachmae_.\r\n   \"  7th   \"    = 1 _drachma_ or 4 _pfennige_.\r\n   \"  8th   \"    = 2 _pfennige_.\r\n   \"  9th   \"    = 1 _pfennig_.\r\n\r\nThe men of Cologne and Antwerp[43] divide the _bes_ into twelve units of\r\nfive _drachmae_ and one _scripulum_, which weights they call _nummi_.\r\nEach of these they again divide into twenty-four units of four\r\n_siliquae_ each, which they call _grenlins_. They have ten weights, of\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n  the 1st = 12 _nummi_ = 1 _bes_.\r\n   \"  2nd =  6   \"\r\n   \"  3rd =  3   \"\r\n   \"  4th =  2   \"\r\n   \"  5th =  1   \"     = 24 units of 4 _siliquae_ each.\r\n   \"  6th = 12 units of 4 _siliquae_ each.\r\n   \"  7th =  6   \"           \"\r\n   \"  8th =  3   \"           \"\r\n   \"  9th =  2   \"           \"\r\n   \" 10th =  1   \"           \"\r\n\r\nAnd so with them, just as with our own people, the _mark_ is divided\r\ninto two hundred and eighty-eight _grenlins_, and by the people of\r\nNuremberg it is divided into two hundred and fifty-six _pfennige_.\r\nLastly, the Venetians divide the _bes_ into eight _unciae_. The _uncia_\r\ninto four _sicilici_, the _sicilicus_ into thirty-six _siliquae_. They\r\nmake twelve weights, which they use whenever they wish to assay alloys\r\nof silver and copper. Of these\r\n\r\n  the 1st =  8 _unciae_ = 1 _bes_.\r\n   \"  2nd =  4    \"\r\n   \"  3rd =  2    \"\r\n   \"  4th =  1    \"  or 4 _sicilici_.\r\n   \"  5th =  2 _sicilici_.\r\n   \"  6th =  1 _sicilicus_.\r\n   \"  7th = 18 _siliquae_.\r\n   \"  8th =  9    \"\r\n   \"  9th =  6    \"\r\n   \" 10th =  3    \"\r\n   \" 11th =  2    \"\r\n   \" 12th =  1    \"\r\n\r\nSince the Venetians divide the _bes_ into eleven hundred and fifty-two\r\n_siliquae_, or two hundred and eighty-eight units of 4 _siliquae_ each,\r\ninto which number our people also divide the _bes_, they thus make the\r\nsame number of _siliquae_, and both agree, even though the Venetians\r\ndivide the _bes_ into smaller divisions.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the system of weights, both of the greater and the lesser\r\nkinds, which metallurgists employ, and likewise the system of the lesser\r\nweights which coiners and merchants employ, when they are assaying\r\nmetals and coined money. The _bes_ of the larger weight with which they\r\nprovide themselves when they weigh large masses of these things, I have\r\nexplained in my work _De Mensuris et Ponderibus_, and in another book,\r\n_De Precio Metallorum et Monetis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 265 (Balances): A--First small balance. B--Second.\r\nC--Third, placed in a case.]\r\n\r\nThere are three small balances by which we weigh ore, metals, and\r\nfluxes. The first, by which we weigh lead and fluxes, is the largest\r\namong these smaller balances, and when eight _unciae_ (of the greater\r\nweights) are placed in one of its pans, and the same number in the\r\nother, it sustains no damage. The second is more delicate, and by this\r\nwe weigh the ore or the metal, which is to be assayed; this is well able\r\nto carry one _centumpondium_ of the lesser weights in one pan, and in\r\nthe other, ore or metal as heavy as that weight. The third is the most\r\ndelicate, and by this we weigh the beads of gold or silver, which, when\r\nthe assay is completed, settle in the bottom of the cupel. But if anyone\r\nweighs lead in the second balance, or an ore in the third, he will do\r\nthem much injury.\r\n\r\nWhatsoever small amount of metal is obtained from a _centumpondium_ of\r\nthe lesser weights of ore or metal alloy, the same greater weight of\r\nmetal is smelted from a _centumpondium_ of the greater weight of ore or\r\nmetal alloy.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] We have but little record of anything which could be called\r\n\"assaying\" among the Greeks and Romans. The fact, however, that they\r\nmade constant use of the touchstone (see note 37, p. 252) is sufficient\r\nproof that they were able to test the purity of gold and silver. The\r\ndescription of the touchstone by Theophrastus contains several\r\nreferences to \"trial\" by fire (see note 37, p. 252). They were adepts at\r\nmetal working, and were therefore familiar with melting metals on a\r\nsmall scale, with the smelting of silver, lead, copper, and tin ores\r\n(see note 1, p. 353) and with the parting of silver and lead by\r\ncupellation. Consequently, it would not require much of an imaginative\r\nflight to conclude that there existed some system of tests of ore and\r\nmetal values by fire. Apart from the statement of Theophrastus referred\r\nto, the first references made to anything which might fill the _role_ of\r\nassaying are from the Alchemists, particularly Geber (prior to 1300),\r\nfor they describe methods of solution, precipitation, distillation,\r\nfusing in crucibles, cupellation, and of the parting of gold and silver\r\nby acid and by sulphur, antimony, or cementation. However, they were not\r\nbent on determining quantitative values, which is the fundamental object\r\nof the assayer's art, and all their discussion is shrouded in an obscure\r\ncloak of gibberish and attempted mysticism. Nevertheless, therein lies\r\nthe foundation of many cardinal assay methods, and even of chemistry\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe first explicit records of assaying are the anonymous booklets\r\npublished in German early in the 16th Century under the title\r\n_Probierbuechlein_. Therein the art is disclosed well advanced toward\r\nmaturity, so far as concerns gold and silver, with some notes on lead\r\nand copper. We refer the reader to Appendix B for fuller discussion of\r\nthese books, but we may repeat here that they are a collection of\r\ndisconnected recipes lacking in arrangement, the items often repeated,\r\nand all apparently the inheritance of wisdom passed from father to son\r\nover many generations. It is obviously intended as a sort of reminder to\r\nthose already skilled in the art, and would be hopeless to a novice.\r\nApart from some notes in Biringuccio (Book III, Chaps. 1 and 2) on\r\nassaying gold and silver, there is nothing else prior to _De Re\r\nMetallica_. Agricola was familiar with these works and includes their\r\nmaterial in this chapter. The very great advance which his account\r\nrepresents can only be appreciated by comparison, but the exhaustive\r\npublication of other works is foreign to the purpose of these notes.\r\nAgricola introduces system into the arrangement of his materials,\r\ndescribes implements, and gives a hundred details which are wholly\r\nomitted from the previous works, all in a manner which would enable a\r\nbeginner to learn the art. Furthermore, the assaying of lead, copper,\r\ntin, quicksilver, iron, and bismuth, is almost wholly new, together with\r\nthe whole of the argument and explanations. We would call the attention\r\nof students of the history of chemistry to the general oversight of\r\nthese early 16th Century attempts at analytical chemistry, for in them\r\nlie the foundations of that science. The statement sometimes made that\r\nAgricola was the first assayer, is false if for no other reason than\r\nthat science does not develop with such strides at any one human hand.\r\nHe can, however, fairly be accounted as the author of the first proper\r\ntext-book upon assaying. Those familiar with the art will be astonished\r\nat the small progress made since his time, for in his pages appear most\r\nof the reagents and most of the critical operations in the dry analyses\r\nof gold, silver, lead, copper, tin, bismuth, quicksilver, and iron of\r\nto-day. Further, there will be recognised many of the \"kinks\" of the art\r\nused even yet, such as the method of granulation, duplicate assays, the\r\n\"assay ton\" method of weights, the use of test lead, the introduction of\r\ncharges in leaf lead, and even the use of beer instead of water to damp\r\nbone-ash.\r\n\r\nThe following table is given of the substances mentioned requiring some\r\ncomment, and the terms adopted in this book, with notes for convenience\r\nin reference. The German terms are either from Agricola's Glossary of\r\n_De Re Metallica_, his _Interpretatio_, or the German Translation. We\r\nhave retained the original German spelling. The fifth column refers to\r\nthe page where more ample notes are given:--\r\n\r\n  Terms             Latin.           German.          Remarks.

Appendix).\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] _Crudorum_,--unbaked?\r\n\r\n[3] This reference is not very clear. Apparently the names refer to the\r\nGerman terms _probier ofen_ and _windt ofen_.\r\n\r\n[4] _Circulus_. This term does not offer a very satisfactory equivalent,\r\nas such a furnace has no distinctive name in English. It is obviously a\r\nsort of forge for fusing in crucibles.\r\n\r\n[5] _Spissa_,--\"Dry.\" This term is used in contra-distinction to\r\n_pingue_, unctuous or \"fatty.\"\r\n\r\n[6] _Additamenta_,--\"Additions.\" Hence the play on words.\r\n\r\nWe have adopted \"flux\" because the old English equivalent for all these\r\nmaterials was \"flux,\" although in modern nomenclature the term is\r\ngenerally restricted to those substances which, by chemical combination\r\nin the furnace, lower the melting point of some of the charge. The\r\n\"additions\" of Agricola, therefore, include reducing, oxidizing,\r\nsulphurizing, desulphurizing, and collecting agents as well as fluxes. A\r\ncritical examination of the fluxes mentioned in the next four pages\r\ngives point to the Author's assertion that \"some are of a very\r\ncomplicated nature.\" However, anyone of experience with home-taught\r\nassayers has come in contact with equally extraordinary combinations.\r\nThe four orders of \"additions\" enumerated are quite impossible to\r\nreconcile from a modern metallurgical point of view.\r\n\r\n[7] _Minium secundarium_. (_Interpretatio_,--_menning_. Pb_{3}O_{4}).\r\nAgricola derived his Latin term from Pliny. There is great confusion in\r\nthe ancient writers on the use of the word _minium_, for prior to the\r\nMiddle Ages it was usually applied to vermilion derived from cinnabar.\r\nVermilion was much adulterated with red-lead, even in Roman times, and\r\nfinally in later centuries the name came to be appropriated to the lead\r\nproduct. Theophrastus (103) mentions a substitute for vermilion, but, in\r\nspite of commentators, there is no evidence that it was red-lead. The\r\nfirst to describe the manufacture of real red-lead was apparently\r\nVitruvius (VII, 12), who calls it _sandaraca_ (this name was usually\r\napplied to red arsenical sulphide), and says: \"White-lead is heated in a\r\nfurnace and by the force of the fire becomes red lead. This invention\r\nwas the result of observation in the case of an accidental fire, and by\r\nthe process a much better material is obtained than from the mines.\" He\r\ndescribes _minium_ as the product from cinnabar. Dioscorides (V, 63),\r\nafter discussing white-lead, says it may be burned until it becomes the\r\ncolour of _sandaracha_, and is called _sandyx_. He also states (V, 69)\r\nthat those are deceived who consider cinnabar to be the same as\r\n_minium_, for _minium_ is made in Spain out of stone mixed with silver\r\nsands. Therefore he is not in agreement with Vitruvius and Pliny on the\r\nuse of the term. Pliny (XXXIII, 40) says: \"These barren stones\r\n(apparently lead ores barren of silver) may be recognised by their\r\ncolour; it is only in the furnace that they turn red. After being\r\nroasted it is pulverized and is _minium secundarium_. It is known to few\r\nand is very inferior to the natural kind made from those sands we have\r\nmentioned (_cinnabar_). It is with this that the genuine _minium_ is\r\nadulterated in the works of the Company.\" This proprietary company who\r\nheld a monopoly of the Spanish quicksilver mines, \"had many methods of\r\nadulterating it (_minium_)--a source of great plunder to the Company.\"\r\nPliny also describes the making of red lead from white.\r\n\r\n[8] _Ochra plumbaria_. (_Interpretatio_,--_pleigeel_; modern\r\nGerman,--_Bleigelb_). The German term indicates that this \"Lead Ochre,\"\r\na form of PbO, is what in the English trade is known as _massicot_, or\r\n_masticot_. This material can be a partial product from almost any\r\ncupellation where oxidation takes place below the melting point of the\r\noxide. It may have been known to the Ancients among the various species\r\ninto which they divided litharge, but there is no valid reason for\r\nassigning to it any special one of their terms, so far as we can see.\r\n\r\n[9] There are four forms of copper named as re-agents by Agricola:\r\n\r\n  Copper filings    _Aeris scobs elimata._\r\n  Copper scales     _Aeris squamae._\r\n  Copper flowers    _Aeris flos._\r\n  Roasted copper    _Aes ustum._\r\n\r\nThe first of these was no doubt finely divided copper metal; the second,\r\nthird, and fourth were probably all cupric oxide. According to Agricola\r\n(_De Nat. Fos._, p. 352), the scales were the result of hammering the\r\nmetal; the flowers came off the metal when hot bars were quenched in\r\nwater, and a third kind were obtained from calcining the metal. \"Both\r\nflowers (_flos_) and hammer-scales (_squama_) have the same properties\r\nas _crematum_ copper.... The particles of flower copper are finer than\r\nscales or _crematum_ copper.\" If we assume that the verb _uro_ used in\r\n_De Re Metallica_ is of the same import as _cremo_ in the _De Natura\r\nFossilium_, we can accept this material as being merely cupric oxide,\r\nbut the _aes ustum_ of Pliny--Agricola's usual source of technical\r\nnomenclature--is probably an artificial sulphide. Dioscorides (V, 47),\r\nwho is apparently the source of Pliny's information, says:--\"Of _chalcos\r\ncecaumenos_, the best is red, and pulverized resembles the colour of\r\ncinnabar; if it turns black, it is over-burnt. It is made from broken\r\nship nails put into a rough earthen pot, with alternate layers of equal\r\nparts of sulphur and salt. The opening should be smeared with potter's\r\nclay and the pot put in the furnace until it is thoroughly heated,\" etc.\r\nPliny (XXXIV, 23) states: \"Moreover Cyprian copper is roasted in crude\r\nearthen pots with an equal amount of sulphur; the apertures of the pots\r\nare well luted, and they are kept in the furnace until the pot is\r\nthoroughly heated. Some add salt, others use _alumen_ instead of\r\nsulphur, others add nothing, but only sprinkle it with vinegar.\"\r\n\r\n[10] The reader is referred to note 6, p. 558, for more ample discussion\r\nof the alkalis. Agricola gives in this chapter four substances of that\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\n     Soda (_nitrum_). Lye. \"Ashes which wool-dyers use.\" \"Salt made\r\n     from the ashes of musk ivy.\"\r\n\r\nThe last three are certainly potash, probably impure. While the first\r\nmight be either potash or soda, the fact that the last three are\r\nmentioned separately, together with other evidence, convinces us that by\r\nthe first is intended the _nitrum_ so generally imported into Europe\r\nfrom Egypt during the Middle Ages. This imported salt was certainly the\r\nnatural bicarbonate, and we have, therefore, used the term \"soda.\"\r\n\r\n[11] In this chapter are mentioned seven kinds of common salt:\r\n\r\n  Salt            _Sal._\r\n  Rock salt       _Sal fossilis._\r\n  \"Made\" salt     _Sal facticius._\r\n  Refined salt    _Sal purgatius._\r\n  Melted salt     _Sal liquefactus._\r\n\r\nAnd in addition _sal tostus_ and _sal torrefactus_. _Sal facticius_ is\r\nused in distinction from rock-salt. The melted salt would apparently be\r\nsalt-glass. What form the _sal tostus_ and _sal torrefactus_ could have\r\nwe cannot say, however, but they were possibly some form of heated salt;\r\nthey may have been combinations after the order of _sal artificiosus_\r\n(see p. 236).\r\n\r\n[12] \"Stones which easily melt in hot furnaces and sand which is made\r\nfrom them\" (_lapides qui in ardentibus fornacibus facile liquescunt\r\narenae ab eis resolutae_). These were probably quartz in this instance,\r\nalthough fluorspar is also included in this same genus. For fuller\r\ndiscussion see note on p. 380.\r\n\r\n[13] _Tophus_. (_Interpretatio_, _Toffstein oder topstein_). According\r\nto Dana (Syst. of Min., p. 678), the German _topfstein_ was English\r\npotstone or soapstone, a magnesian silicate. It is scarcely possible,\r\nhowever, that this is what Agricola meant by this term, for such a\r\nsubstance would be highly infusible. Agricola has a good deal to say\r\nabout this mineral in _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 189 and 313), and from\r\nthese descriptions it would seem to be a tufaceous limestone of various\r\nsorts, embracing some marls, stalagmites, calcareous sinter, etc. He\r\nstates: \"Generally fire does not melt it, but makes it harder and breaks\r\nit into powder. Tophus is said to be a stone found in caverns, made from\r\nthe dripping of stone juice solidified by cold ... sometimes it is found\r\ncontaining many shells, and likewise the impressions of alder leaves;\r\nour people make lime by burning it.\" Pliny, upon whom Agricola depends\r\nlargely for his nomenclature, mentions such a substance (XXXVI, 48):\r\n\"Among the multitude of stones there is _tophus_. It is unsuitable for\r\nbuildings, because it is perishable and soft. Still, however, there are\r\nsome places which have no other, as Carthage, in Africa. It is eaten\r\naway by the emanations from the sea, crumbled to dust by the wind, and\r\nwashed away by the rain.\" In fact, _tophus_ was a wide genus among the\r\nolder mineralogists, Wallerius (_Meditationes Physico-Chemicae De\r\nOrigine Mundi_, Stockholm, 1776, p. 186), for instance, gives 22\r\nvarieties. For the purposes for which it is used we believe it was\r\nalways limestone of some form.\r\n\r\n[14] _Saxum fissile album._ (_The Interpretatio_ gives the German as\r\n_schifer_). Agricola mentions it in _Bermannus_ (459), in _De Natura\r\nFossilium_ (p. 319), but nothing definite can be derived from these\r\nreferences. It appears to us from its use to have been either a\r\nquartzite or a fissile limestone.\r\n\r\n[15] Argol (_Feces vini siccae_,--\"Dried lees of wine.\" Germ. trans.\r\ngives _die wein heffen_, although the usual German term of the period\r\nwas _weinstein_). The lees of wine were the crude tartar or argols of\r\ncommerce and modern assayers. The argols of white wine are white, while\r\nthey are red from red wine. The white argol which Agricola so often\r\nspecifies would have no special excellence, unless it may be that it is\r\nless easily adulterated. Agricola (_De Nat. Fos._, p. 344) uses the\r\nexpression \"_Fex vini sicca_ called _tartarum_\"--one of the earliest\r\nappearances of the latter term in this connection. The use of argol is\r\nvery old, for Dioscorides (1st Century A.D.) not only describes argol,\r\nbut also its reduction to impure potash. He says (V, 90): \"The lees\r\n(_tryx_) are to be selected from old Italian wine; if not, from other\r\nsimilar wine. Lees of vinegar are much stronger. They are carefully\r\ndried and then burnt. There are some who burn them in a new earthen pot\r\non a large fire until they are thoroughly incinerated. Others place a\r\nquantity of the lees on live coals and pursue the same method. The test\r\nas to whether it is completely burned, is that it becomes white or blue,\r\nand seems to burn the tongue when touched. The method of burning lees of\r\nvinegar is the same.... It should be used fresh, as it quickly grows\r\nstale; it should be placed in a vessel in a secluded place.\" Pliny\r\n(XXIII, 31) says: \"Following these, come the lees of these various\r\nliquids. The lees of wine (_vini faecibus_) are so powerful as to be\r\nfatal to persons on descending into the vats. The test for this is to\r\nlet down a lamp, which, if extinguished, indicates the peril.... Their\r\nvirtues are greatly increased by the action of fire.\" Matthioli,\r\ncommenting on this passage from Dioscorides in 1565, makes the following\r\nremark (p. 1375): \"The precipitate of the wine which settles in the\r\ncasks of the winery forms stone-like crusts, and is called by the\r\nworks-people by the name _tartarum_.\" It will be seen above that these\r\nlees were rendered stronger by the action of fire, in which case the\r\ntartar was reduced to potassium carbonate. The _weinstein_ of the old\r\nGerman metallurgists was often the material lixiviated from the\r\nincinerated tartar.\r\n\r\nDried lees of vinegar (_siccae feces aceti_; _Interpretatio_, _die heffe\r\ndes essigs_). This would also be crude tartar. Pliny (XXIII, 32) says:\r\n\"The lees of vinegar (_faex aceti_); owing to the more acrid material\r\nare more aggravating in their effects.... When combined with\r\n_melanthium_ it heals the bites of dogs and crocodiles.\"\r\n\r\n[16] Dried lees of _aqua_ which separates gold and silver. (_Siccae\r\nfeces aquarum quae aurum ab argento secernunt_. German translation, _Der\r\nscheidwasser heffe_). There is no pointed description in Agricola's\r\nworks, or in any other that we can find, as to what this material was.\r\nThe \"separating _aqua_\" was undoubtedly nitric acid (see p. 439, Book\r\nX). There are two precipitates possible, both referred to as\r\n_feces_,--the first, a precipitate of silver chloride from clarifying\r\nthe _aqua valens_, and the second, the residues left in making the acid\r\nby distillation. It is difficult to believe that silver chloride was the\r\n_feces_ referred to in the text, because such a precipitate would be\r\nobviously misleading when used as a flux through the addition of silver\r\nto the assays, too expensive, and of no merit for this purpose.\r\nTherefore one is driven to the conclusion that the _feces_ must have\r\nbeen the residues left in the retorts when nitric acid was prepared. It\r\nwould have been more in keeping with his usual mode of expression,\r\nhowever, to have referred to this material as a _residuus_. The\r\nmaterials used for making acid varied greatly, so there is no telling\r\nwhat such a _feces_ contained. A list of possibilities is given in note\r\n8, p. 443. In the main, the residue would be undigested vitriol, alum,\r\nsaltpetre, salt, etc., together with potassium, iron, and alum\r\nsulphates. The _Probierbuechlin_ (p. 27) also gives this re-agent under\r\nthe term _Toden kopff das ist schlam oder feces auss dem scheydwasser_.\r\n\r\n[17] _Recrementum vitri_. (_Interpretatio_, _Glassgallen_). Formerly,\r\nwhen more impure materials were employed than nowadays, the surface of\r\nthe mass in the first melting of glass materials was covered with salts,\r\nmostly potassium and sodium sulphates and chlorides which escaped\r\nperfect vitrification. This \"slag\" or \"_glassgallen_\" of Agricola was\r\nalso termed _sandiver_.\r\n\r\n[18] The whole of this expression is \"_candidus, candido_.\" It is by no\r\nmeans certain that this is tin, for usually tin is given as _plumbum\r\ncandidum_.\r\n\r\n[19] _Sal artificiosus_. These are a sort of stock fluxes. Such mixtures\r\nare common in all old assay books, from the _Probierbuechlin_ to later\r\nthan John Cramer in 1737 (whose Latin lectures on Assaying were\r\npublished in English under the title of \"Elements of the Art of Assaying\r\nMetals,\" London, 1741). Cramer observes (p. 51) that: \"Artificers\r\ncompose a great many fluxes with the above-mentioned salts and with the\r\nreductive ones; nay, some use as many different fluxes as there are\r\ndifferent ores and metals; all which, however, we think needless to\r\ndescribe. It is better to have explained a few of the simpler ones,\r\nwhich serve for all the others, and are very easily prepared, than to\r\ntire the reader with confused compositions: and this chiefly because\r\nunskilled artificers sometimes attempt to obtain with many ingredients\r\nof the same nature heaped up beyond measure, and with much labour,\r\nthough not more properly and more securely, what might have been easily\r\neffected, with one only and the same ingredient, thus increasing the\r\nnumber, not at all the virtue of the things employed. Nevertheless, if\r\nanyone loves variety, he may, according to the proportions and cautions\r\nabove prescribed, at his will chuse among the simpler kinds such as will\r\nbest suit his purpose, and compose a variety of fluxes with them.\"\r\n\r\n[20] This operation apparently results in a coating to prevent the\r\ndeflagration of the saltpetre--in fact, it might be permitted to\r\ntranslate _inflammatur_ \"deflagrate,\" instead of kindle.\r\n\r\n[21] The results which would follow from the use of these \"fluxes\" would\r\nobviously depend upon the ore treated. They can all conceivably be\r\nsuccessful. Of these, the first is the lead-glass of the German\r\nassayers--a flux much emphasized by all old authorities, including\r\nLohneys, Ercker and Cramner, and used even yet. The \"powerful flux\"\r\nwould be a reducing, desulphurizing, and an acid flux. The \"more\r\npowerful\" would be a basic flux in which the reducing action of the\r\nargols would be largely neutralised by the nitre. The \"still more\r\npowerful\" would be a strongly sulphurizing basic flux, while the \"most\r\npowerful\" would be a still more sulphurizing flux, but it is badly mixed\r\nas to its oxidation and basic properties. (See also note 19 on _sal\r\nartificiosus_).\r\n\r\n[22] Lead ash (_Cinis Plumbi_. Glossary, _Pleyasch_).--This was\r\nobviously, from the method of making, an artificial lead sulphide.\r\n\r\n[23] Ashes of lead (_Nigri plumbi cinis_). This, as well as lead ash,\r\nwas also an artificial lead sulphide. Such substances were highly valued\r\nby the Ancients for medicinal purposes. Dioscorides (V, 56) says:\r\n\"Burned lead (_Molybdos cecaumenos_) is made in this way: Sprinkle\r\nsulphur over some very thinnest lead plates and put them into a new\r\nearthen pot, add other layers, putting sulphur between each layer until\r\nthe pot is full; set it alight and stir the melted lead with an iron rod\r\nuntil it is entirely reduced to ashes and until none of the lead remains\r\nunburned. Then take it off, first stopping up your nose, because the\r\nfumes of burnt lead are very injurious. Or burn the lead filings in a\r\npot with sulphur as aforesaid.\" Pliny (XXXIV., 50) gives much the same\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n[24] Camphor (_camphora_). This was no doubt the well-known gum.\r\nAgricola, however, believed that camphor (_De Nat. Fossilium_, p. 224)\r\nwas a species of bitumen, and he devotes considerable trouble to the\r\nrefutation of the statements by the Arabic authors that it was a gum. In\r\nany event, it would be a useful reducing agent.\r\n\r\n[25] Inasmuch as orpiment and realgar are both arsenical sulphides, the\r\nuse of iron \"slag,\" if it contains enough iron, would certainly matte\r\nthe sulphur and arsenic. Sulphur and arsenic are the \"juices\" referred\r\nto (see note 4, p. 1). It is difficult to see the object of preserving\r\nthe antimony with such a sulphurizing \"addition,\" unless it was desired\r\nto secure a regulus of antimony alone from a given antimonial ore.\r\n\r\n[26] The lead free from silver, called _villacense_, was probably from\r\nBleyberg, not far from Villach in Upper Austria, this locality having\r\nbeen for centuries celebrated for its pure lead. These mines were worked\r\nprior to, and long after, Agricola's time.\r\n\r\n[27] This method of proportionate weights for assay charges is simpler\r\nthan the modern English \"assay ton,\" both because of the use of 100\r\nunits in the standard of weight (the _centumpondium_), and because of\r\nthe lack of complication between the Avoirdupois and Troy scales. For\r\ninstance, an ore containing a _libra_ of silver to the _centumpondium_\r\nwould contain 1/100th part, and the same ratio would obtain, no matter\r\nwhat the actual weight of a _centumpondium_ of the \"lesser weight\" might\r\nbe. To follow the matter still further, an _uncia_ being 1/1,200 of a\r\n_centumpondium_, if the ore ran one \"_uncia_ of the lesser weight\" to\r\nthe \"_centumpondium_ of the lesser weight,\" it would also run one actual\r\n_uncia_ to the actual _centumpondium_; it being a matter of indifference\r\nwhat might be the actual weight of the _centumpondium_ upon which the\r\nscale of lesser weights is based. In fact Agricola's statement (p. 261)\r\nindicates that it weighed an actual _drachma_. We have, in some places,\r\ninterpolated the expressions \"lesser\" and \"greater\" weights for clarity.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first mention of this scheme of lesser weights, as it\r\nappears in the _Probierbuechlein_ (1500? see Appendix B) and Biringuccio\r\n(1540). For a more complete discussion of weights and measures see\r\nAppendix C. For convenience, we repeat here the Roman scale, although,\r\nas will be seen in the Appendix, Agricola used the Latin terms in many\r\nplaces merely as nomenclature equivalents of the old German scale.\r\n\r\n                                                                   Ozs.\r\n                                                                       dwts.\r\n                                         Troy                             gr.\r\n                                        Grains.                per short ton.\r\n    1 _Siliqua_                            2.87 Per _Centumpondium_  0   3  9\r\n    6 _Siliquae_  =  1 _Scripulum_         17.2  \"       \"           1   0  6\r\n    4 _Scripula_  =  1 _Sextula_           68.7  \"       \"           4   1  0\r\n    6 _Sextulae_  =  1 _Uncia_            412.2  \"       \"          24   6  2\r\n   12 _Unciae_    =  1 _Libra_           4946.4  \"       \"         291  13  8\r\n  100 _Librae_    =  1 _Centumpondium_ 494640.0\r\n\r\nHowever Agricola may occasionally use\r\n\r\n   16 _Unciae_    =  1 _Libra_           6592.0 (?)\r\n  100 _Librae_    =  1 _Centumpondium_ 659200.0 (?)\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n\r\n                                                                    Oz.\r\n                                                                       dwts.\r\n                                                                           gr.\r\n                                                                per short ton.\r\n  1 _Scripulum_                            17.2 Per _Centumpondium_  1   0   6\r\n  3 _Scripula_    =  1 _Drachma_           51.5  \"        \"          3   0  19\r\n  2 _Drachmae_    =  1 _Sicilicus_        103.0  \"        \"          6   1  15\r\n  4 _Sicilici_    =  1 _Uncia_            412.2  \"        \"         24   6  12\r\n  8 _Unciae_      =  1 _Bes_             3297.6  \"        \"        194  12   0\r\n\r\n[28] The amalgamation of gold ores is fully discussed in note 12, p.\r\n297.\r\n\r\n[29] For discussion of the silver ores, see note 8, p. 108. _Rudis_\r\nsilver was a fairly pure silver mineral, the various coloured silvers\r\nwere partly horn-silver and partly alteration products.\r\n\r\n[30] It is difficult to see why copper scales (_squamae aeris_--copper\r\noxide?) are added, unless it be to collect a small ratio of copper in\r\nthe ore. This additional copper is not mentioned again, however. The\r\nwhole of this statement is very confused.\r\n\r\n[31] This old story runs that Hiero, King of Syracuse, asked Archimedes\r\nto tell him whether a crown made for him was pure gold or whether it\r\ncontained some proportion of silver. Archimedes is said to have puzzled\r\nover it until he noticed the increase in water-level upon entering his\r\nbath. Whereupon he determined the matter by immersing bars of pure gold\r\nand pure silver, and thus determining the relative specific weights. The\r\nbest ancient account of this affair is to be found in Vitruvius, IX,\r\nPreface. The story does not seem very probable, seeing that\r\nTheophrastus, who died the year Archimedes was born, described the\r\ntouchstone in detail, and that it was of common knowledge among the\r\nGreeks before (see note 37). In any event, there is not sufficient\r\nevidence in this story on which to build the conclusion of Meyer (Hist.\r\nof Chemistry, p. 14) and others, that, inasmuch as Archimedes was unable\r\nto solve the problem until his discovery of specific weights, therefore\r\nthe Ancients could not part gold and silver. The probability that he did\r\nnot want to injure the King's jewellery would show sufficient reason for\r\nhis not parting these metals. It seems probable that the Ancients did\r\npart gold and silver by cementation. (See note on p. 458).\r\n\r\n[32] The Alchemists (with whose works Agricola was familiar--_vide_\r\npreface) were the inventors of nitric acid separation. (See note on p.\r\n460).\r\n\r\n[33] Parting gold and silver by nitric acid is more exhaustively\r\ndiscussed in Book X. and note 10, p. 443.\r\n\r\n[34] The lesser weights, probably.\r\n\r\n[35] Lead and Tin seem badly mixed in this paragraph.\r\n\r\n[36] It is not clear what is added.\r\n\r\n[37] HISTORICAL NOTE ON TOUCHSTONE. (_Coticula_.\r\n_Interpretatio_,--_Goldstein_). Theophrastus is, we believe, the first\r\nto describe the touchstone, although it was generally known to the\r\nGreeks, as is evidenced by the metaphors of many of the poets,--Pindar,\r\nTheognis, Euripides, etc. The general knowledge of the constituents of\r\nalloys which is implied, raises the question as to whether the Greeks\r\ndid not know a great deal more about parting metals, than has been\r\nattributed to them. Theophrastus says (78-80): \"The nature of the stone\r\nwhich tries gold is also very wonderful, as it seems to have the same\r\npower with fire; which is also a test of that metal. Some people have\r\nfor this reason questioned the truth of this power in the stone, but\r\ntheir doubts are ill-founded, for this trial is not of the same nature\r\nor made in the same manner as the other. The trial by fire is by the\r\ncolour and by the quantity lost by it; but that by the stone is made\r\nonly by rubbing the metal on it; the stone seeming to have the power to\r\nreceive separately the distinct particles of different metals. It is\r\nsaid also that there is a much better kind of this stone now found out,\r\nthan that which was formerly used; insomuch that it now serves not only\r\nfor the trial of refined gold, but also of copper or silver coloured\r\nwith gold; and shows how much of the adulterating matter by weight is\r\nmixed with gold; this has signs which it yields from the smallest weight\r\nof the adulterating matter, which is a grain, from thence a colybus, and\r\nthence a quadrans or semi-obolus, by which it is easy to distinguish if,\r\nand in what degree, that metal is adulterated. All these stones are\r\nfound in the River Tmolus; their texture is smooth and like that of\r\npebbles; their figure broad, not round; and their bigness twice that of\r\nthe common larger sort of pebbles. In their use in the trial of metals\r\nthere is a difference in power between their upper surface, which has\r\nlain toward the sun, and their under, which has been to the earth; the\r\nupper performing its office the more nicely; and this is consonant to\r\nreason, as the upper part is dryer; for the humidity of the other\r\nsurface hinders its receiving so well the particles of metals; for the\r\nsame reason also it does not perform its office as well in hot weather\r\nas in colder, for in the hot it emits a kind of humidity out of its\r\nsubstance, which runs all over it. This hinders the metalline particles\r\nfrom adhering perfectly, and makes mistakes in the trials. This\r\nexudation of a humid matter is also common to many other stones, among\r\nothers, to those of which statues are made; and this has been looked on\r\nas peculiar to the statue.\" (Based on Hill's trans.) This humid\r\n\"exudation of fine-grained stones in summer\" would not sound abnormal if\r\nit were called condensation. Pliny (XXXIII, 43) says: \"The mention of\r\ngold and silver should be accompanied by that of the stone called\r\n_coticula_. Formerly, according to Theophrastus, it was only to be found\r\nin the river Tmolus but now found in many parts, it was found in small\r\npieces never over four inches long by two broad. That side which lay\r\ntoward the sun is better than that toward the ground. Those experienced\r\nwith the _coticula_ when they rub ore (_vena_) with it, can at once say\r\nhow much gold it contains, how much silver or copper. This method is so\r\naccurate that they do not mistake it to a scruple.\" This purported use\r\nfor determining values of _ore_ is of about Pliny's average accuracy.\r\nThe first detailed account of touch-needles and their manner of making,\r\nwhich we have been able to find, is that of the _Probierbuechlein_ (1527?\r\nsee Appendix) where many of the tables given by Agricola may be found.\r\n\r\n[38] _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 267) and _De Ortu et Causis\r\nSubterraneorum_ (p. 59). The author does not add any material\r\nmineralogical information to the quotations from Theophrastus and Pliny\r\ngiven above.\r\n\r\n[39] In these tables Agricola has simply adopted Roman names as\r\nequivalents of the old German weights, but as they did not always\r\napproximate in proportions, he coined terms such as \"units of 4\r\n_siliquae_,\" etc. It might seem more desirable to have introduced the\r\nGerman terms into this text, but while it would apply in this instance,\r\nas we have discussed on p. 259, the actual values of the Roman weights\r\nare very different from the German, and as elsewhere in the book actual\r\nRoman weights are applied, we have considered it better to use the Latin\r\nterms consistently throughout. Further, the obsolete German would be to\r\nmost readers but little improvement upon the Latin. For convenience of\r\nreaders we set out the various scales as used by Agricola, together with\r\nthe German:--\r\n\r\n            ROMAN SCALE.

The Latin terms adopted by Agricola are given\r\nbelow, together with the German:--\r\n\r\n                                                 Number in one  Value in\r\n  Roman Term.

Agricola also\r\nuses:\r\n\r\n  _Selibra_          _Halb-pfundt_\r\n  _Libra_            _Pfundt_\r\n  _Centumpondium_    _Centner_.\r\n\r\nAs the Roman _libra_ contains 12 _unciae_ and the German _pfundt_ 16\r\n_untzen_, the actual weights of these latter quantities are still\r\nfurther apart--the former 4946 and the latter 7219 Troy grains.\r\n\r\n[40] There are no tables in the Latin text, the whole having been\r\nwritten out _in extenso_, but they have now been arranged as above, as\r\nbeing in a much more convenient and expressive form.\r\n\r\n[41] See note 39 above.\r\n\r\n[42] See note 27, p. 242, for discussion of this \"Assay ton\"\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n[43] _Agrippinenses_ and _Antuerpiani_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions of assaying were explained in the last Book, and I have now\r\ncome to a greater task, that is, to the description of how we extract\r\nthe metals. First of all I will explain the method of preparing the\r\nore[1]; for since Nature usually creates metals in an impure state,\r\nmixed with earth, stones, and solidified juices, it is necessary to\r\nseparate most of these impurities from the ores as far as can be, before\r\nthey are smelted, and therefore I will now describe the methods by which\r\nthe ores are sorted, broken with hammers, burnt, crushed with stamps,\r\nground into powder, sifted, washed, roasted, and calcined[2].\r\n\r\nI will start at the beginning with the first sort of work. Experienced\r\nminers, when they dig the ore, sort the metalliferous material from\r\nearth, stones, and solidified juices before it is taken from the shafts\r\nand tunnels, and they put the valuable metal in trays and the waste into\r\nbuckets. But if some miner who is inexperienced in mining matters has\r\nomitted to do this, or even if some experienced miner, compelled by some\r\nunavoidable necessity, has been unable to do so, as soon as the material\r\nwhich has been dug out has been removed from the mine, all of it should\r\nbe examined, and that part of the ore which is rich in metal sorted from\r\nthat part of it which is devoid of metal, whether such part be earth, or\r\nsolidified juices, or stones. To smelt waste together with an ore\r\ninvolves a loss, for some expenditure is thrown away, seeing that out of\r\nearth and stones only empty and useless slags are melted out, and\r\nfurther, the solidified juices also impede the smelting of the metals\r\nand cause loss. The rock which lies contiguous to rich ore should also\r\nbe broken into small pieces, crushed, and washed, lest any of the\r\nmineral should be lost. When, either through ignorance or carelessness,\r\nthe miners while excavating have mixed the ore with earth or broken\r\nrock, the work of sorting the crude metal or the best ore is done not\r\nonly by men, but also by boys and women. They throw the mixed material\r\nupon a long table, beside which they sit for almost the whole day, and\r\nthey sort out the ore; when it has been sorted out, they collect it in\r\ntrays, and when collected they throw it into tubs, which are carried to\r\nthe works in which the ores are smelted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 268 (Sorting Ore): A--Long table. B--Tray. C--Tub.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 269 (Cutting Metal): A--Masses of metal. B--Hammer.\r\nC--Chisel. D--Tree stumps. E--Iron tool similar to a pair of shears.]\r\n\r\nThe metal which is dug out in a pure or crude state, to which class\r\nbelong native silver, silver glance, and gray silver, is placed on a\r\nstone by the mine foreman and flattened out by pounding with heavy\r\nsquare hammers. These masses, when they have been thus flattened out\r\nlike plates, are placed either on the stump of a tree, and cut into\r\npieces by pounding an iron chisel into them with a hammer, or else they\r\nare cut with an iron tool similar to a pair of shears. One blade of\r\nthese shears is three feet long, and is firmly fixed in a stump, and the\r\nother blade which cuts the metal is six feet long. These pieces of\r\nmetal are afterward heated in iron basins and smelted in the cupellation\r\nfurnace by the smelters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 270 (Spalling Ore): A--Tables. B--Upright planks.\r\nC--Hammer. D--Quadrangular hammer. E--Deeper vessel. F--Shallower\r\nvessel. G--Iron rod.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the miners, in the shafts or tunnels, have sorted over the\r\nmaterial which they mine, still the ore which has been broken down and\r\ncarried out must be broken into pieces by a hammer or minutely crushed,\r\nso that the more valuable and better parts can be distinguished from the\r\ninferior and worthless portions. This is of the greatest importance in\r\nsmelting ore, for if the ore is smelted without this separation, the\r\nvaluable part frequently receives great damage before the worthless part\r\nmelts in the fire, or else the one consumes the other; this latter\r\ndifficulty can, however, be partly avoided by the exercise of care and\r\npartly by the use of fluxes. Now, if a vein is of poor quality, the\r\nbetter portions which have been broken down and carried out should be\r\nthrown together in one place, and the inferior portion and the rock\r\nthrown away. The sorters place a hard broad stone on a table; the tables\r\nare generally four feet square and made of joined planks, and to the\r\nedge of the sides and back are fixed upright planks, which rise about a\r\nfoot from the table; the front, where the sorter sits, is left open. The\r\nlumps of ore, rich in gold or silver, are put by the sorters on the\r\nstone and broken up with a broad, but not thick, hammer; they either\r\nbreak them into pieces and throw them into one vessel, or they break and\r\nsort--whence they get their name--the more precious from the worthless,\r\nthrowing and collecting them separately into different vessels. Other\r\nmen crush the lumps of ore less rich in gold or silver, which have\r\nlikewise been put on the stone, with a broad thick hammer, and when it\r\nhas been well crushed, they collect it and throw it into one vessel.\r\nThere are two kinds of vessels; one is deeper, and a little wider in the\r\ncentre than at the top or bottom; the other is not so deep though it is\r\nbroader at the bottom, and becomes gradually a little narrower toward\r\nthe top. The latter vessel is covered with a lid, while the former is\r\nnot covered; an iron rod through the handles, bent over on either end,\r\nis grasped in the hand when the vessel is carried. But, above all, it\r\nbehooves the sorters to be assiduous in their labours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 271 (Spalling Ore): A--Pyrites. B--Leggings. C--Gloves.\r\nD--Hammer.]\r\n\r\nBy another method of breaking ore with hammers, large hard fragments of\r\nore are broken before they are burned. The legs of the workmen--at all\r\nevents of those who crush pyrites in this manner with large hammers in\r\nGoslar--are protected with coverings resembling leggings, and their\r\nhands are protected with long gloves, to prevent them from being\r\ninjured by the chips which fly away from the fragments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 272 (Spalling Ore): A--Area paved with stones. B--Broken\r\nore. C--Area covered with broken ore. D--Iron tool. E--Its handle.\r\nF--Broom. G--Short strake. H--Wooden hoe.]\r\n\r\nIn that district of Greater Germany which is called Westphalia and in\r\nthat district of Lower Germany which is named Eifel, the broken ore\r\nwhich has been burned, is thrown by the workmen into a round area paved\r\nwith the hardest stones, and the fragments are pounded up with iron\r\ntools, which are very much like hammers in shape and are used like\r\nthreshing sledges. This tool is a foot long, a palm wide, and a digit\r\nthick, and has an opening in the middle just as hammers have, in which\r\nis fixed a wooden handle of no great thickness, but up to three and a\r\nhalf feet long, in order that the workmen can pound the ore with greater\r\nforce by reason of its weight falling from a greater height. They strike\r\nand pound with the broad side of the tool, in the same way as corn is\r\npounded out on a threshing floor with the threshing sledges, although\r\nthe latter are made of wood and are smooth and fixed to poles. When the\r\nore has been broken into small pieces, they sweep it together with\r\nbrooms and remove it to the works, where it is washed in a short\r\nstrake, at the head of which stands the washer, who draws the water\r\nupward with a wooden hoe. The water running down again, carries all the\r\nlight particles into a trough placed underneath. I shall deal more fully\r\nwith this method of washing a little later.\r\n\r\nOre is burned for two reasons; either that from being hard, it may\r\nbecome soft and more easily broken and more readily crushed with a\r\nhammer or stamps, and then can be smelted; or that the fatty things,\r\nthat is to say, sulphur, bitumen, orpiment, or realgar[3] may be\r\nconsumed. Sulphur is frequently found in metallic ores, and, generally\r\nspeaking, is more harmful to the metals, except gold, than are the other\r\nthings. It is most harmful of all to iron, and less to tin than to\r\nbismuth, lead, silver, or copper. Since very rarely gold is found in\r\nwhich there is not some silver, even gold ores containing sulphur ought\r\nto be roasted before they are smelted, because, in a very vigorous\r\nfurnace fire, sulphur resolves metal into ashes and makes slag of it.\r\nBitumen acts in the same way, in fact sometimes it consumes silver,\r\nwhich we may see in bituminous _cadmia_[4].\r\n\r\n[Illustration 274 (Stall Roasting Ore): A--Area. B--Wood. C--Ore.\r\nD--Cone-shaped piles. E--Canal.]\r\n\r\nI now come to the methods of roasting, and first of all to that one\r\nwhich is common to all ores. The earth is dug out to the required\r\nextent, and thus is made a quadrangular area of fair size, open at the\r\nfront, and above this, firewood is laid close together, and on it other\r\nwood is laid transversely, likewise close together, for which reason our\r\ncountrymen call this pile of wood a crate; this is repeated until the\r\npile attains a height of one or two cubits. Then there is placed upon it\r\na quantity of ore that has been broken into small pieces with a hammer;\r\nfirst the largest of these pieces, next those of medium size, and lastly\r\nthe smallest, and thus is built up a gently sloping cone. To prevent it\r\nfrom becoming scattered, fine sand of the same ore is soaked with water\r\nand smeared over it and beaten on with shovels; some workers, if they\r\ncannot obtain such fine sand, cover the pile with charcoal-dust, just as\r\ndo charcoal-burners. But at Goslar, the pile, when it has been built up\r\nin the form of a cone, is smeared with _atramentum sutorium rubrum_[5],\r\nwhich is made by the leaching of roasted pyrites soaked with water. In\r\nsome districts the ore is roasted once, in others twice, in others three\r\ntimes, as its hardness may require. At Goslar, when pyrites is roasted\r\nfor the third time, that which is placed on the top of the pyre exudes a\r\ncertain greenish, dry, rough, thin substance, as I have elsewhere\r\nwritten[6]; this is no more easily burned by the fire than is asbestos.\r\nVery often also, water is put on to the ore which has been roasted,\r\nwhile it is still hot, in order to make it softer and more easily\r\nbroken; for after fire has dried up the moisture in the ore, it breaks\r\nup more easily while it is still hot, of which fact burnt limestone\r\naffords the best example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 275 (Heap Roasting Ore): A--Lighted pyre. B--Pyre which is\r\nbeing constructed. C--Ore. D--Wood. E--Pile of the same wood.]\r\n\r\nBy digging out the earth they make the areas much larger, and square;\r\nwalls should be built along the sides and back to hold the heat of the\r\nfire more effectively, and the front should be left open. In these\r\ncompartments tin ore is roasted in the following manner. First of all\r\nwood about twelve feet long should be laid in the area in four layers,\r\nalternately straight and transverse. Then the larger pieces of ore\r\nshould be laid upon them, and on these again the smaller ones, which\r\nshould also be placed around the sides; the fine sand of the same ore\r\nshould also be spread over the pile and pounded with shovels, to prevent\r\nthe pile from falling before it has been roasted; the wood should then\r\nbe fired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 276 (Stall Roasting Ore): A--Burning pyre which is\r\ncomposed of lead ore with wood placed above it. B--Workman throwing ore\r\ninto another area. C--Oven-shaped furnace. D--Openings through which the\r\nsmoke escapes.]\r\n\r\nLead ore, if roasting is necessary, should be piled in an area just like\r\nthe last, but sloping, and the wood should be placed over it. A tree\r\ntrunk should be laid right across the front of the ore to prevent it\r\nfrom falling out. The ore, being roasted in this way, becomes partly\r\nmelted and resembles slag. Thuringian pyrites, in which there is gold,\r\nsulphur, and vitriol, after the last particle of vitriol has been\r\nobtained by heating it in water, is thrown into a furnace, in which logs\r\nare placed. This furnace is very similar to an oven in shape, in order\r\nthat when the ore is roasted the valuable contents may not fly away with\r\nthe smoke, but may adhere to the roof of the furnace. In this way\r\nsulphur very often hangs like icicles from the two openings of the roof\r\nthrough which the smoke escapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 277 (Hearths for roasting): A--Iron plates full of holes.\r\nB--Walls.

K--Middle\r\nwall. L--Pots which are filled with ore. M--Lids of same pots.\r\nN--Grating.]\r\n\r\nIf pyrites or _cadmia_, or any other ore containing metal, possesses a\r\ngood deal of sulphur or bitumen, it should be so roasted that neither is\r\nlost. For this purpose it is thrown on an iron plate full of holes, and\r\nroasted with charcoal placed on top; three walls support this plate, two\r\non the sides and the third at the back. Beneath the plate are placed\r\npots containing water, into which the sulphurous or bituminous vapour\r\ndescends, and in the water the fat accumulates and floats on the top. If\r\nit is sulphur, it is generally of a yellow colour; if bitumen, it is\r\nblack like pitch. If these were not drawn out they would do much harm to\r\nthe metal, when the ore is being smelted. When they have thus been\r\nseparated they prove of some service to man, especially the sulphurous\r\nkind. From the vapour which is carried down, not into the water, but\r\ninto the ground, there is created a sulphurous or a bituminous substance\r\nresembling _pompholyx_[7], and so light that it can be blown away with a\r\nbreath. Some employ a vaulted furnace, open at the front and divided\r\ninto two chambers. A wall built in the middle of the furnace divides the\r\nlower chamber into two equal parts, in which are set pots containing\r\nwater, as above described. The upper chamber is again divided into three\r\nparts, the middle one of which is always open, for in it the wood is\r\nplaced, and it is not broader than the middle wall, of which it forms\r\nthe topmost portion. The other two compartments have iron doors which\r\nare closed, and which, together with the roof, keep in the heat when the\r\nwood is lighted. In these upper compartments are iron bars which take\r\nthe place of a floor, and on these are arranged pots without bottoms,\r\nhaving in place of a bottom, a grating made of iron wire, fixed to each,\r\nthrough the openings of which the sulphurous or bituminous vapours\r\nroasted from the ore run into the lower pots. Each of the upper pots\r\nholds a hundred pounds of ore; when they are filled they are covered\r\nwith lids and smeared with lute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 278 (Heap Roasting): A--Heap of cupriferous stones.\r\nB--Kindled heap. C--Stones being taken to the beds of faggots.]\r\n\r\nIn Eisleben and the neighbourhood, when they roast the schistose stone\r\nfrom which copper is smelted, and which is not free from bitumen, they\r\ndo not use piles of logs, but bundles of faggots. At one time, they used\r\nto pile this kind of stone, when extracted from the pit, on bundles of\r\nfaggots and roast it by firing the faggots; nowadays, they first of all\r\ncarry these same stones to a heap, where they are left to lie for some\r\ntime in such a way as to allow the air and rain to soften them. Then\r\nthey make a bed of faggot bundles near the heap, and carry the nearest\r\nstones to this bed; afterward they again place bundles of faggots in the\r\nempty place from which the first stones have been removed, and pile over\r\nthis extended bed, the stones which lay nearest to the first lot; and\r\nthey do this right up to the end, until all the stones have been piled\r\nmound-shape on a bed of faggots. Finally they fire the faggots, not,\r\nhowever, on the side where the wind is blowing, but on the opposite\r\nside, lest the fire blown up by the force of the wind should consume the\r\nfaggots before the stones are roasted and made soft; by this method the\r\nstones which are adjacent to the faggots take fire and communicate it to\r\nthe next ones, and these again to the adjoining ones, and in this way\r\nthe heap very often burns continuously for thirty days or more. This\r\nschist rock when rich in copper, as I have said elsewhere, exudes a\r\nsubstance of a nature similar to asbestos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 284 (Stamp-mill): A--Mortar. B--Upright posts.\r\nC--Cross-beams. D--Stamps. E--Their heads. F--Axle (cam-shaft). G--Tooth\r\nof the stamp (tappet). H--Teeth of axle (cams).]\r\n\r\nOre is crushed with iron-shod stamps, in order that the metal may be\r\nseparated from the stone and the hangingwall rock.[8] The machines which\r\nminers use for this purpose are of four kinds, and are made by the\r\nfollowing method. A block of oak timber six feet long, two feet and a\r\npalm square, is laid on the ground. In the middle of this is fixed a\r\nmortar-box, two feet and six digits long, one foot and six digits deep;\r\nthe front, which might be called a mouth, lies open; the bottom is\r\ncovered with a plate of iron, a palm thick and two palms and as many\r\ndigits wide, each end of which is wedged into the timber with broad\r\nwedges, and the front and back part of it are fixed to the timber with\r\niron nails. To the sides of the mortar above the block are fixed two\r\nupright posts, whose upper ends are somewhat cut back and are mortised\r\nto the timbers of the building. Two and a half feet above the mortar\r\nare placed two cross-beams joined together, one in front and one in the\r\nback, the ends of which are mortised into the upright posts already\r\nmentioned. Through each mortise is bored a hole, into which is driven an\r\niron clavis; one end of the clavis has two horns, and the other end is\r\nperforated in order that a wedge driven through, binds the beams more\r\nfirmly; one horn of the clavis turns up and the other down. Three and a\r\nhalf feet above the cross-beams, two other cross-beams of the same kind\r\nare again joined in a similar manner; these cross-beams have square\r\nopenings, in which the iron-shod stamps are inserted. The stamps are not\r\nfar distant from each other, and fit closely in the cross-beams. Each\r\nstamp has a tappet at the back, which requires to be daubed with grease\r\non the lower side that it can be raised more easily. For each stamp\r\nthere are on a cam-shaft, two cams, rounded on the outer end, which\r\nalternately raise the stamp, in order that, by its dropping into the\r\nmortar, it may with its iron head pound and crush the rock which has\r\nbeen thrown under it. To the cam-shaft is fixed a water-wheel whose\r\nbuckets are turned by water-power. Instead of doors, the mouth of the\r\nmortar has a board, which is fitted into notches cut out of the front of\r\nthe block. This board can be raised, in order that when the mouth is\r\nopen, the workmen can remove with a shovel the fine sand, and likewise\r\nthe coarse sand and broken rock, into which the rocks have been crushed;\r\nthis board can be lowered, so that the mouth thus being closed, the\r\nfresh rock thrown in may be crushed with the iron-shod stamps. If an oak\r\nblock is not available, two timbers are placed on the ground and joined\r\ntogether with iron clamps, each of the timbers being six feet long, a\r\nfoot wide, and a foot and a half thick. Such depth as should be allowed\r\nto the mortar, is obtained by cutting out the first beam to a width of\r\nthree-quarters of a foot and to a length of two and a third and one\r\ntwenty-fourth of a foot. In the bottom of the part thus dug out, there\r\nshould be laid a very hard rock, a foot thick and three-quarters of a\r\nfoot wide; about it, if any space remains, earth or sand should be\r\nfilled in and pounded. On the front, this bed rock is covered with a\r\nplank; this rock when it has been broken, should be taken away and\r\nreplaced by another. A smaller mortar having room for only three stamps\r\nmay also be made in the same manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 285 (Stamps): A--Stamp. B--Stem cut out in lower part.\r\nC--Shoe. D--The other shoe, barbed and grooved. E--Quadrangular iron\r\nband. F--Wedge. G--Tappet. H--Angular cam-shaft. I--Cams. K--Pair of\r\ncompasses.]\r\n\r\nThe stamp-stems are made of small square timbers nine feet long and half\r\na foot wide each way. The iron head of each is made in the following\r\nway; the lower part of the head is three palms long and the upper part\r\nthe same length. The lower part is a palm square in the middle for two\r\npalms, then below this, for a length of two digits it gradually spreads\r\nuntil it becomes five digits square; above the middle part, for a length\r\nof two digits, it again gradually swells out until it becomes a palm and\r\na half square. Higher up, where the head of the shoe is enclosed in the\r\nstem, it is bored through and similarly the stem itself is pierced, and\r\nthrough the opening of each, there passes a broad iron wedge, which\r\nprevents the head falling off the stem. To prevent the stamp head from\r\nbecoming broken by the constant striking of fragments of ore or rocks,\r\nthere is placed around it a quadrangular iron band a digit thick, seven\r\ndigits wide, and six digits deep. Those who use three stamps, as is\r\ncommon, make them much larger, and they are made square and three palms\r\nbroad each way; then the iron shoe of each has a total length of two\r\nfeet and a palm; at the lower end, it is hexagonal, and at that point it\r\nis seven digits wide and thick. The lower part of it which projects\r\nbeyond the stem is one foot and two palms long; the upper part, which is\r\nenclosed in the stem, is three palms long; the lower part is a palm\r\nwide and thick; then gradually the upper part becomes narrower and\r\nthinner, so that at the top it is three digits and a half wide and two\r\nthick. It is bored through at the place where the angles have been\r\nsomewhat cut away; the hole is three digits long and one wide, and is\r\none digit's distance from the top. There are some who make that part of\r\nthe head which is enclosed in the stem, barbed and grooved, in order\r\nthat when the hooks have been fixed into the stem and wedges fitted to\r\nthe grooves, it may remain tightly fixed, especially when it is also\r\nheld with two quadrangular iron bands. Some divide the cam-shaft with a\r\ncompass into six sides, others into nine; it is better for it to be\r\ndivided into twelve sides, in order that successively one side may\r\ncontain a cam and the next be without one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 286 (Stamp-mill): A--Box. Although the upper part is not\r\nopen, it is shown open here, that the wheel may be seen. B--Wheel.\r\nC--Cam-shaft. D--Stamps.]\r\n\r\nThe water-wheel is entirely enclosed under a quadrangular box, in case\r\neither the deep snows or ice in winter, or storms, may impede its\r\nrunning and its turning around. The joints in the planks are stopped all\r\naround with moss. The cover, however, has one opening, through which\r\nthere passes a race bringing down water which, dropping on the buckets\r\nof the wheel, turns it round, and flows out again in the lower race\r\nunder the box. The spokes of the water-wheel are not infrequently\r\nmortised into the middle of the cam-shaft; in this case the cams on\r\nboth sides raise the stamps, which either both crush dry or wet ore, or\r\nelse the one set crushes dry ore and the other set wet ore, just as\r\ncircumstances require the one or the other; further, when the one set is\r\nraised and the iron clavises in them are fixed into openings in the\r\nfirst cross-beam, the other set alone crushes the ore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 287 (Handling stamped material): A--Box laid flat on the\r\nground.

E--Box suspended from a beam, the inside being visible.\r\nF--Box suspended from a beam, the outside being visible.]\r\n\r\nBroken rock or stones, or the coarse or fine sand, are removed from the\r\nmortar of this machine and heaped up, as is also done with the same\r\nmaterials when raked out of the dump near the mine. They are thrown by a\r\nworkman into a box, which is open on the top and the front, and is three\r\nfeet long and nearly a foot and a half wide. Its sides are sloping and\r\nmade of planks, but its bottom is made of iron wire netting, and\r\nfastened with wire to two iron rods, which are fixed to the two side\r\nplanks. This bottom has openings, through which broken rock of the size\r\nof a hazel nut cannot pass; the pieces which are too large to pass\r\nthrough are removed by the workman, who again places them under stamps,\r\nwhile those which have passed through, together with the coarse and fine\r\nsand, he collects in a large vessel and keeps for the washing. When he\r\nis performing his laborious task he suspends the box from a beam by two\r\nropes. This box may rightly be called a quadrangular sieve, as may also\r\nthat kind which follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 288 (Sifting Ore): A--Sieve. B--Small planks. C--Post.\r\nD--Bottom of sieve. E--Open box. F--Small cross-beam. G--Upright posts.]\r\n\r\nSome employ a sieve shaped like a wooden bucket, bound with two iron\r\nhoops; its bottom, like that of the box, is made of iron wire netting.\r\nThey place this on two small cross-planks fixed upon a post set in the\r\nground. Some do not fix the post in the ground, but stand it on the\r\nground until there arises a heap of the material which has passed\r\nthrough the sieve, and in this the post is fixed. With an iron shovel\r\nthe workman throws into this sieve broken rock, small stones, coarse and\r\nfine sand raked out of the dump; holding the handles of the sieve in his\r\nhands, he agitates it up and down in order that by this movement the\r\ndust, fine and coarse sand, small stones, and fine broken rock may fall\r\nthrough the bottom. Others do not use a sieve, but an open box, whose\r\nbottom is likewise covered with wire netting; this they fix on a small\r\ncross-beam fastened to two upright beams and tilt it backward and\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 289 (Sifting Ore): A--Box. B--Bale. C--Rope. D--Beam.\r\nE--Handles. F--Five-toothed rake. G--Sieve. H--Its handles. I--Pole.\r\nK--Rope. L--Timber.]\r\n\r\nSome use a sieve made of copper, having square copper handles on both\r\nsides, and through these handles runs a pole, of which one end projects\r\nthree-quarters of a foot beyond one handle; the workman then places that\r\nend in a rope which is suspended from a beam, and rapidly shakes the\r\npole alternately backward and forward. By this movement the small\r\nparticles fall through the bottom of the sieve. In order that the end of\r\nthe pole may be easily placed in the rope, a stick, two palms long,\r\nholds open the lower part of the rope as it hangs double, each end of\r\nthe rope being tied to the beam; part of the rope, however, hangs beyond\r\nthe stick to a length of half a foot. A large box is also used for this\r\npurpose, of which the bottom is either made of a plank full of holes or\r\nof iron netting, as are the other boxes. An iron bale is fastened from\r\nthe middle of the planks which form its sides; to this bale is fastened\r\na rope which is suspended from a wooden beam, in order that the box may\r\nbe moved or tilted in any direction. There are two handles on each end,\r\nnot unlike the handles of a wheelbarrow; these are held by two workmen,\r\nwho shake the box to and fro. This box is the one principally used by\r\nthe Germans who dwell in the Carpathian mountains. The smaller particles\r\nare separated from the larger ones by means of three boxes and two\r\nsieves, in order that those which pass through each, being of equal\r\nsize, may be washed together; for the bottoms of both the boxes and\r\nsieves have openings which do not let through broken rock of the size of\r\na hazel nut. As for the dry remnants in the bottoms of the sieves, if\r\nthey contain any metal the miners put them under the stamps. The larger\r\npieces of broken rock are not separated from the smaller by this method\r\nuntil the men and boys, with five-toothed rakes, have separated them\r\nfrom the rock fragments, the little stones, the coarse and the fine sand\r\nand earth, which have been thrown on to the dumps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 291 (Sifting Ore): A--Workman carrying broken rock in a\r\nbarrow.

Y--Plugs.]\r\n\r\nAt Neusohl, in the Carpathians, there are mines where the veins of\r\ncopper lie in the ridges and peaks of the mountains, and in order to\r\nsave expense being incurred by a long and difficult transport, along a\r\nrough and sometimes very precipitous road, one workman sorts over the\r\ndumps which have been thrown out from the mines, and another carries in\r\na wheelbarrow the earth, fine and coarse sand, little stones, broken\r\nrock, and even the poorer ore, and overturns the barrow into a long open\r\nchute fixed to a steep rock. This chute is held apart by small cleats,\r\nand the material slides down a distance of about one hundred and fifty\r\nfeet into a short box, whose bottom is made of a thick copper plate,\r\nfull of holes. This box has two handles by which it is shaken to and\r\nfro, and at the top there are two bales made of hazel sticks, in which\r\nis fixed the iron hook of a rope hung from the branch of a tree or from\r\na wooden beam which projects from an upright post. From time to time a\r\nsifter pulls this box and thrusts it violently against the tree or post,\r\nby which means the small particles passing through its holes descend\r\ndown another chute into another short box, in whose bottom there are\r\nsmaller holes. A second sifter, in like manner, thrusts this box\r\nviolently against a tree or post, and a second time the smaller\r\nparticles are received into a third chute, and slide down into a third\r\nbox, whose bottom has still smaller holes. A third sifter, in like\r\nmanner, thrusts this box violently against a tree or post, and for the\r\nthird time the tiny particles fall through the holes upon a table. While\r\nthe workman is bringing in the barrow, another load which has been\r\nsorted from the dump, each sifter withdraws the hooks from his bale and\r\ncarries away his own box and overturns it, heaping up the broken rock or\r\nsand which remains in the bottom of it. As for the tiny particles which\r\nhave slid down upon the table, the first washer--for there are as many\r\nwashers as sifters--sweeps them off and in a tub nearly full of water,\r\nwashes them through a sieve whose holes are smaller than the holes of\r\nthe third box. When this tub has been filled with the material which has\r\npassed through the sieve, he draws out the plug to let the water run\r\naway; then he removes with a shovel that which has settled in the tub\r\nand throws it upon the table of a second washer, who washes it in a\r\nsieve with smaller holes. The sediment which has this time settled in\r\nhis tub, he takes out and throws on the table of a third washer, who\r\nwashes it in a sieve with the smallest holes. The copper concentrates\r\nwhich have settled in the last tub are taken out and smelted; the\r\nsediment which each washer has removed with a limp is washed on a canvas\r\nstrake. The sifters at Altenberg, in the tin mines of the mountains\r\nbordering on Bohemia, use such boxes as I have described, hung from\r\nwooden beams. These, however, are a little larger and open in the front,\r\nthrough which opening the broken rock which has not gone through the\r\nsieve can be shaken out immediately by thrusting the sieve against its\r\npost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 292 (Sifting Ore): A--Sieve.

K--Man with shovel removing from the tub the material\r\nwhich has passed through the sieve.]\r\n\r\nIf the ore is rich in metal, the earth, the fine and coarse sand, and\r\nthe pieces of rock which have been broken from the hangingwall, are dug\r\nout of the dump with a spade or rake and, with a shovel, are thrown into\r\na large sieve or basket, and washed in a tub nearly full of water. The\r\nsieve is generally a cubit broad and half a foot deep; its bottom has\r\nholes of such size that the larger pieces of broken rock cannot pass\r\nthrough them, for this material rests upon the straight and cross iron\r\nwires, which at their points of contact are bound by small iron clips.\r\nThe sieve is held together by an iron band and by two cross-rods\r\nlikewise of iron; the rest of the sieve is made of staves in the shape\r\nof a little tub, and is bound with two iron hoops; some, however, bind\r\nit with hoops of hazel or oak, but in that case they use three of them.\r\nOn each side it has handles, which are held in the hands by whoever\r\nwashes the metalliferous material. Into this sieve a boy throws the\r\nmaterial to be washed, and a woman shakes it up and down, turning it\r\nalternately to the right and to the left, and in this way passes\r\nthrough it the smaller pieces of earth, sand, and broken rock. The\r\nlarger pieces remain in the sieve, and these are taken out, placed in a\r\nheap and put under the stamps. The mud, together with fine sand, coarse\r\nsand, and broken rock, which remain after the water has been drawn out\r\nof the tub, is removed by an iron shovel and washed in the sluice, about\r\nwhich I will speak a little later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 293 (Sifting Ore): A--Basket. B--Its handles. C--Dish.\r\nD--Its back part. E--Its front part. F--Handles of same.]\r\n\r\nThe Bohemians use a basket a foot and a half broad and half a foot deep,\r\nbound together by osiers. It has two handles by which it is grasped,\r\nwhen they move it about and shake it in the tub or in a small pool\r\nnearly full of water. All that passes through it into the tub or pool\r\nthey take out and wash in a bowl, which is higher in the back part and\r\nlower and flat in the front; it is grasped by the two handles and shaken\r\nin the water, the lighter particles flowing away, and the heavier and\r\nmineral portion sinking to the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 294 (Mills for Grinding Ore): A--Axle. B--Water-wheel.\r\nC--Toothed drum. D--Drum made of rundles. E--Iron axle. F--Millstone.\r\nG--Hopper. H--Round wooden plate. I--Trough.]\r\n\r\nGold ore, after being broken with hammers or crushed by the stamps, and\r\neven tin ore, is further milled to powder. The upper millstone, which\r\nis turned by water-power, is made in the following way. An axle is\r\nrounded to compass measure, or is made angular, and its iron pinions\r\nturn in iron sockets which are held in beams. The axle is turned by a\r\nwater-wheel, the buckets of which are fixed to the rim and are struck by\r\nthe force of a stream. Into the axle is mortised a toothed drum, whose\r\nteeth are fixed in the side of the rim. These teeth turn a second drum\r\nof rundles, which are made of very hard material. This drum surrounds an\r\niron axle which has a pinion at the bottom and revolves in an iron cup\r\nin a timber. At the top of the iron axle is an iron tongue, dove-tailed\r\ninto the millstone, and so when the teeth of the one drum turn the\r\nrundles of the other, the millstone is made to turn round. An\r\noverhanging machine supplies it with ore through a hopper, and the ore,\r\nbeing ground to powder, is discharged from a round wooden plate into a\r\ntrough and flowing away through it accumulates on the floor; from there\r\nthe ore is carried away and reserved for washing. Since this method of\r\ngrinding requires the millstone to be now raised and now lowered, the\r\ntimber in whose socket the iron of the pinion axle revolves, rests upon\r\ntwo beams, which can be raised and lowered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 296 (Mills for Grinding Ore): A--First mill.

K--Lever of the upper millstone. L--Its\r\nopening.]\r\n\r\nThere are three mills in use in milling gold ores, especially for\r\nquartz[11] which is not lacking in metal. They are not all turned by\r\nwater-power, but some by the strength of men, and two of them even by\r\nthe power of beasts of burden. The first revolving one differs from the\r\nnext only in its driving wheel, which is closed in and turned by men\r\ntreading it, or by horses, which are placed inside, or by asses, or even\r\nby strong goats; the eyes of these beasts are covered by linen bands.\r\nThe second mill, both when pushed and turned round, differs from the two\r\nabove by having an upright axle in the place of the horizontal one; this\r\naxle has at its lower end a disc, which two workmen turn by treading\r\nback its cleats with their feet, though frequently one man sustains all\r\nthe labour; or sometimes there projects from the axle a pole which is\r\nturned by a horse or an ass, for which reason it is called an\r\n_asinaria_. The toothed drum which is at the upper end of the axle turns\r\nthe drum which is made of rundles, and together with it the millstone.\r\n\r\nThe third mill is turned round and round, and not pushed by hand; but\r\nbetween this and the others there is a great distinction, for the lower\r\nmillstone is so shaped at the top that it can hold within it the upper\r\nmillstone, which revolves around an iron axle; this axle is fastened in\r\nthe centre of the lower stone and passes through the upper stone. A\r\nworkman, by grasping in his hand an upright iron bar placed in the upper\r\nmillstone, moves it round. The middle of the upper millstone is bored\r\nthrough, and the ore, being thrown into this opening, falls down upon\r\nthe lower millstone and is there ground to powder, which gradually runs\r\nout through its opening; it is washed by various methods before it is\r\nmixed with quicksilver, which I will explain presently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 299 (Stamp-mill): A--Water-wheel.

BB--Paddles.]\r\n\r\nSome people build a machine which at one and the same time can crush,\r\ngrind, cleanse, and wash the gold ore, and mix the gold with\r\nquicksilver. This machine has one water-wheel, which is turned by a\r\nstream striking its buckets; the main axle on one side of the\r\nwater-wheel has long cams, which raise the stamps that crush the dry\r\nore. Then the crushed ore is thrown into the hopper of the upper\r\nmillstone, and gradually falling through the opening, is ground to\r\npowder. The lower millstone is square, but has a round depression in\r\nwhich the round, upper millstone turns, and it has an outlet from which\r\nthe powder falls into the first tub. A vertical iron axle is dove-tailed\r\ninto a cross-piece, which is in turn fixed into the upper millstone; the\r\nupper pinion of this axle is held in a bearing fixed in a beam; the drum\r\nof the vertical axle is made of rundles, and is turned by the toothed\r\ndrum on the main axle, and thus turns the millstone. The powder falls\r\ncontinually into the first tub, together with water, and from there runs\r\ninto a second tub which is set lower down, and out of the second into a\r\nthird, which is the lowest; from the third, it generally flows into a\r\nsmall trough hewn out of a tree trunk. Quicksilver[12] is placed in\r\neach tub, across which is fixed a small plank, and through a hole in the\r\nmiddle of each plank there passes a small upright axle, which is\r\nenlarged above the plank to prevent it from dropping into the tub lower\r\nthan it should. At the lower end of the axle three sets of paddles\r\nintersect, each made from two little boards fixed to the axle opposite\r\neach other. The upper end of this axle has a pinion held by a bearing\r\nset in a beam, and around each of these axles is a small drum made of\r\nrundles, each of which is turned by a small toothed drum on a horizontal\r\naxle, one end of which is mortised into the large horizontal axle, and\r\nthe other end is held in a hollow covered with thick iron plates in a\r\nbeam. Thus the paddles, of which there are three sets in each tub, turn\r\nround, and agitating the powder, thoroughly mix it with water and\r\nseparate the minute particles of gold from it, and these are attracted\r\nby the quicksilver and purified. The water carries away the waste. The\r\nquicksilver is poured into a bag made of leather or cloth woven from\r\ncotton, and when this bag is squeezed, as I have described elsewhere,\r\nthe quicksilver drips through it into a jar placed underneath. The pure\r\ngold[13] remains in the bag. Some people substitute three broad sluices\r\nfor the tubs, each of which has an angular axle on which are set six\r\nnarrow spokes, and to them are fixed the same number of broad paddles;\r\nthe water that is poured in strikes these paddles and turns them round,\r\nand they agitate the powder which is mixed with the water and separate\r\nthe metal from it. If the powder which is being treated contains gold\r\nparticles, the first method of washing is far superior, because the\r\nquicksilver in the tubs immediately attracts the gold; if it is powder\r\nin which are the small black stones from which tin is smelted, this\r\nlatter method is not to be despised. It is very advantageous to place\r\ninterlaced fir boughs in the sluices in which such tin-stuff is washed,\r\nafter it has run through the launders from the mills, because the fine\r\ntin-stone is either held back by the twigs, or if the current carries\r\nthem along they fall away from the water and settle down.\r\n\r\nSeven methods of washing are in common use for the ores of many metals;\r\nfor they are washed either in a simple buddle, or in a divided buddle,\r\nor in an ordinary strake, or in a large tank, or in a short strake, or\r\nin a canvas strake, or in a jigging sieve. Other methods of washing are\r\neither peculiar to some particular metal, or are combined with the\r\nmethod of crushing wet ore by stamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 301 (Buddles): A--Head of buddle. B--Pipe. C--Buddle.\r\nD--Board. E--Transverse buddle. F--Shovel. G--Scrubber.]\r\n\r\nA simple buddle is made in the following way. In the first place, the\r\nhead is higher than the rest of the buddle, and is three feet long and a\r\nfoot and a half broad; this head is made of planks laid upon a timber\r\nand fastened, and on both sides, side-boards are set up so as to hold\r\nthe water, which flows in through a pipe or trough, so that it shall\r\nfall straight down. The middle of the head is somewhat depressed in\r\norder that the broken rock and the larger metallic particles may settle\r\ninto it. The buddle is sunk into the earth to a depth of three-quarters\r\nof a foot below the head, and is twelve feet long and a foot and a half\r\nwide and deep; the bottom and each side are lined with planks to prevent\r\nthe earth, when it is softened by the water, from falling in or from\r\nabsorbing the metallic particles. The lower end of the buddle is\r\nobstructed by a board, which is not as high as the sides. To this\r\nstraight buddle there is joined a second transverse buddle, six feet\r\nlong and a foot and a half wide and deep, similarly lined with planks;\r\nat the lower end it is closed up with a board, also lower than the\r\nsides of the buddle so that the water can flow away; this water falls\r\ninto a launder and is carried outside the building. In this simple\r\nbuddle is washed the metallic material which has passed on to the floor\r\nof the works through the five large sieves. When this has been gathered\r\ninto a heap, the washer throws it into the head of the buddle, and water\r\nis poured upon it through the pipe or small trough, and the portion\r\nwhich sinks and settles in the middle of the head compartment he stirs\r\nwith a wooden scrubber,--this is what we will henceforth call the\r\nimplement made of a stick to which is fixed a piece of wood a foot long\r\nand a palm broad. The water is made turbid by this stirring, and carries\r\nthe mud and sand and small particles of metal into the buddle below.\r\nTogether with the broken rock, the larger metallic particles remain in\r\nthe head compartment, and when these have been removed, boys throw them\r\nupon the platform of a washing tank or the short strake, and separate\r\nthem from the broken rock. When the buddle is full of mud and sand, the\r\nwasher closes the pipe through which the water flows into the head; very\r\nsoon the water which remains in the buddle flows away, and when this has\r\ntaken place, he removes with a shovel the mud and sand which are mixed\r\nwith minute particles of metal, and washes them on a canvas strake.\r\nSometimes before the buddles have been filled full, the boys throw the\r\nmaterial into a bowl and carry it to the strakes and wash it.\r\n\r\nPulverized ore is washed in the head of this kind of a buddle; but\r\nusually when tin-stone is washed in it, interlacing fir boughs are put\r\ninto the buddle, in the same manner as in the sluice when wet ore is\r\ncrushed with stamps. The larger tin-stone particles, which sink in the\r\nupper part of the buddle, are washed separately in a strake; those\r\nparticles which are of medium size, and settle in the middle part, are\r\nwashed separately in the same way; and the mud mixed with minute\r\nparticles of tin-stone, which has settled in the lowest part of the\r\nbuddle below the fir boughs, is washed separately on the canvas strakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 302 (Buddles): A--Pipe. B--Cross launder. C--Small\r\ntroughs. D--Head of the buddle. E--Wooden scrubber. F--Dividing boards.\r\nG--Short strake.]\r\n\r\nThe divided buddle differs from the last one by having several\r\ncross-boards, which, being placed inside it, divide it off like steps;\r\nif the buddle is twelve feet long, four of them are placed within; if\r\nnine feet long, three. The nearer each one is to the head, the greater\r\nis its height; the further from the head, the lower it is; and so when\r\nthe highest is a foot and a palm high, the second is usually a foot and\r\nthree digits high, the third a foot and two digits, and the lowest a\r\nfoot and one digit. In this buddle is generally washed that\r\nmetalliferous material which has been sifted through the large sieve\r\ninto the tub containing water. This material is continuously thrown with\r\nan iron shovel into the head of the buddle, and the water which has been\r\nlet in is stirred up by a wooden scrubber, until the buddle is full,\r\nthen the cross-boards are taken out by the washer, and the water is\r\ndrained off; next the metalliferous material which has settled in the\r\ncompartments is again washed, either on a short strake or on the canvas\r\nstrakes or in the jigging sieves. Since a short strake is often united\r\nwith the upper part of this buddle, a pipe in the first place carries\r\nthe water into a cross launder, from which it flows down through one\r\nlittle launder into the buddle, and through another into the short\r\nstrake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 303 (Washing material): A--Head. B--Strake. C--Trowel.\r\nD--Scrubber. E--Canvas. F--Rod by which the canvas is made smooth.]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary strake, so far as the planks are concerned, is not unlike\r\nthe last two. The head of this, as of the others, is first made of earth\r\nstamped down, then covered with planks; and where it is necessary, earth\r\nis thrown in and beaten down a second time, so that no crevice may\r\nremain through which water carrying the particles of metal can escape.\r\nThe water ought to fall straight down into the strake, which has a\r\nlength of eight feet and a breadth of a foot and a half; it is\r\nconnected with a transverse launder, which then extends to a settling\r\npit outside the building. A boy with a shovel or a ladle takes the\r\nimpure concentrates or impure tin-stone from a heap, and throws them\r\ninto the head of the strake or spreads them over it. A washer with a\r\nwooden scrubber then agitates them in the strake, whereby the mud mixed\r\nwith water flows away into the transverse launder, and the concentrates\r\nor the tin-stone settle on the strake. Since sometimes the concentrates\r\nor fine tin-stone flow down together with the mud into the transverse\r\nlaunder, a second washer closes it, after a distance of about six feet,\r\nwith a cross-board and frequently stirs the mud with a shovel, in order\r\nthat when mixed with water it may flow out into the settling-pit; and\r\nthere remains in the launder only the concentrates or tin-stone. The\r\ntin-stuff of Schlackenwald and Erbisdorff is washed in this kind of a\r\nstrake once or twice; those of Altenberg three or four times; those of\r\nGeyer often seven times; for in the ore at Schlackenwald and Erbisdorff\r\nthe tin-stone particles are of a fair size, and are crushed with stamps;\r\nat Altenberg they are of much smaller size, and in the broken ore at\r\nGeyer only a few particles of tin-stone can be seen occasionally.\r\n\r\nThis method of washing was first devised by the miners who treated tin\r\nore, whence it passed on from the works of the tin workers to those of\r\nthe silver workers and others; this system is even more reliable than\r\nwashing in jigging-sieves. Near this ordinary strake there is generally\r\na canvas strake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 305 (Washing material): A--Upper cross launder. B--Small\r\nlaunders. C--Heads of strakes. D--Strakes. E--Lower transverse launder.\r\nF--Settling pit. G--Socket in the sill. H--Halved iron rings fixed to\r\nbeam. I--Pole. K--Its little scrubber. L--Second small scrubber.]\r\n\r\nIn modern times two ordinary strakes, similarly made, are generally\r\njoined together; the head of one is three feet distant from that of the\r\nother, while the bodies are four feet distant from each other, and there\r\nis only one cross launder under the two strakes. One boy shovels, from\r\nthe heap into the head of each, the concentrates or tin-stone mixed with\r\nmud. There are two washers, one of whom sits at the right side of one\r\nstrake, and the other at the left of the other strake, and each pursues\r\nhis task, using the following sort of implement. Under each strake is a\r\nsill, from a socket in which a round pole rises, and is held by half an\r\niron ring in a beam of the building, so that it may revolve; this pole\r\nis nine feet long and a palm thick. Penetrating the pole is a small\r\nround piece of wood, three palms long and as many digits thick, to which\r\nis affixed a small board two feet long and five digits wide, in an\r\nopening of which one end of a small axle revolves, and to this axle is\r\nfixed the handle of a little scrubber. The other end of this axle turns\r\nin an opening of a second board, which is likewise fixed to a small\r\nround piece of wood; this round piece, like the first one, is three\r\npalms long and as many digits thick, and is used by the washer as a\r\nhandle. The little scrubber is made of a stick three feet long, to the\r\nend of which is fixed a small tablet of wood a foot long, six digits\r\nbroad, and a digit and a half thick. The washer constantly moves the\r\nhandle of this implement with one hand; in this way the little scrubber\r\nstirs the concentrates or the fine tin-stone mixed with mud in the head\r\nof the strake, and the mud, on being stirred, flows on to the strake. In\r\nthe other hand he holds a second little scrubber, which has a handle\r\nof half the length, and with this he ceaselessly stirs the concentrates\r\nor tin-stone which have settled in the upper part of the strake; in this\r\nway the mud and water flow down into the transverse launder, and from it\r\ninto the settling-pit which is outside the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 306 (Washing material): A--Trough. B--Platform. C--Wooden\r\nscrubber.]\r\n\r\nBefore the short strake and the jigging-sieve had been invented,\r\nmetalliferous ores, especially tin, were crushed dry with stamps and\r\nwashed in a large trough hollowed out of one or two tree trunks; and at\r\nthe head of this trough was a platform, on which the ore was thrown\r\nafter being completely crushed. The washer pulled it down into the\r\ntrough with a wooden scrubber which had a long handle, and when the\r\nwater had been let into the trough, he stirred the ore with the same\r\nscrubber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 307 (Washing material): A--Short strake. B--Small launder.\r\nC--Transverse launder. D--Wooden scrubber.]\r\n\r\nThe short strake is narrow in the upper part where the water flows down\r\ninto it through the little launder; in fact it is only two feet wide; at\r\nthe lower end it is wider, being three feet and as many palms. At the\r\nsides, which are six feet long, are fixed boards two palms high. In\r\nother respects the head resembles the head of the simple buddle, except\r\nthat it is not depressed in the middle. Beneath is a cross launder\r\nclosed by a low board. In this short strake not only is ore agitated and\r\nwashed with a wooden scrubber, but boys also separate the concentrates\r\nfrom the broken rock in them and collect them in tubs. The short strake\r\nis now rarely employed by miners, owing to the carelessness of the boys,\r\nwhich has been frequently detected; for this reason, the jigging-sieve\r\nhas taken its place. The mud which settles in the launder, if the ore is\r\nrich, is taken up and washed in a jigging-sieve or on a canvas strake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 308 (Washing material): A--Beams. B--Canvas. C--Head of\r\nstrake. D--Small launder. E--Settling pit or tank. F--Wooden scrubber.\r\nG--Tubs.]\r\n\r\nA canvas strake is made in the following way. Two beams, eighteen feet\r\nlong and half a foot broad and three palms thick, are placed on a slope;\r\none half of each of these beams is partially cut away lengthwise, to\r\nallow the ends of planks to be fastened in them, for the bottom is\r\ncovered by planks three feet long, set crosswise and laid close\r\ntogether. One half of each supporting beam is left intact and rises a\r\npalm above the planks, in order that the water that is running down may\r\nnot escape at the sides, but shall flow straight down. The head of the\r\nstrake is higher than the rest of the body, and slopes so as to enable\r\nthe water to flow away. The whole strake is covered by six stretched\r\npieces of canvas, smoothed with a stick. The first of them occupies the\r\nlowest division, and the second is so laid as to slightly overlap it; on\r\nthe second division, the third is similarly laid, and so on, one on the\r\nother. If they are laid in the opposite way, the water flowing down\r\ncarries the concentrates or particles of tin-stone under the canvas, and\r\na useless task is attempted. Boys or men throw the concentrates or\r\ntin-stuff mixed with mud into the head of the strake, after the canvas\r\nhas been thus stretched, and having opened the small launder they let\r\nthe water flow in; then they stir the concentrates or tin-stone with a\r\nwooden scrubber till the water carries them all on to the canvas; next\r\nthey gently sweep the linen with the wooden scrubber until the mud flows\r\ninto the settling-pit or into the transverse launder. As soon as there\r\nis little or no mud on the canvas, but only concentrates or tin-stone,\r\nthey carry the canvas away and wash it in a tub placed close by. The\r\ntin-stone settles in the tub, and the men return immediately to the same\r\ntask. Finally, they pour the water out of the tub, and collect the\r\nconcentrates or tin-stone. However, if either concentrates or tin-stone\r\nhave washed down from the canvas and settled in the settling-pit or in\r\nthe transverse launder, they wash the mud again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 309 (Collecting concentrates): A--Canvas strake. B--Man\r\ndashing water on the canvas. C--Bucket. D--Bucket of another kind.\r\nE--Man removing concentrates or tin-stone from the trough.]\r\n\r\nSome neither remove the canvas nor wash it in the tubs, but place over\r\nit on each edge narrow strips, of no great thickness, and fix them to\r\nthe beams with nails. They agitate the metalliferous material with\r\nwooden scrubbers and wash it in a similar way. As soon as little or no\r\nmud remains on the canvas, but only concentrates or fine tin-stone, they\r\nlift one beam so that the whole strake rests on the other, and dash it\r\nwith water, which has been drawn with buckets out of the small tank, and\r\nin this way all the sediment which clings to the canvas falls into the\r\ntrough placed underneath. This trough is hewn out of a tree and placed\r\nin a ditch dug in the ground; the interior of the trough is a foot wide\r\nat the top, but narrower in the bottom, because it is rounded out. In\r\nthe middle of this trough they put a cross-board, in order that the\r\nfairly large particles of concentrates or fairly large-sized tin-stone\r\nmay remain in the forepart into which they have fallen, and the fine\r\nconcentrates or fine tin-stone in the lower part, for the water flows\r\nfrom one into the other, and at last flows down through an opening into\r\nthe pit. As for the fairly large-sized concentrates or tin-stone which\r\nhave been removed from the trough, they are washed again on the ordinary\r\nstrake. The fine concentrates and fine tin-stone are washed again on\r\nthis canvas strake. By this method, the canvas lasts longer because it\r\nremains fixed, and nearly double the work is done by one washer as\r\nquickly as can be done by two washers by the other method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 311 (Jigging Sieve): A--Fine sieves. B--Limp. C--Finer\r\nsieve. D--Finest sieve.]\r\n\r\nThe jigging sieve has recently come into use by miners. The\r\nmetalliferous material is thrown into it and sifted in a tub nearly full\r\nof water. The sieve is shaken up and down, and by this movement all the\r\nmaterial below the size of a pea passes through into the tub, and the\r\nrest remains on the bottom of the sieve. This residue is of two kinds,\r\nthe metallic particles, which occupy the lower place, and the particles\r\nof rock and earth, which take the higher place, because the heavy\r\nsubstance always settles, and the light is borne upward by the force of\r\nthe water. This light material is taken away with a limp, which is a\r\nthin tablet of wood almost semicircular in shape, three-quarters of a\r\nfoot long, and half a foot wide. Before the lighter portion is taken\r\naway the contents of the sieve are generally divided crosswise with a\r\nlimp, to enable the water to penetrate into it more quickly. Afterward\r\nfresh material is again thrown into the sieve and shaken up and down,\r\nand when a great quantity of metallic particles have settled in the\r\nsieve, they are taken out and put into a tray close by. But since there\r\nfall into the tub with the mud, not only particles of gold or silver,\r\nbut also of sand, pyrites, _cadmia_, galena, quartz, and other\r\nsubstances, and since the water cannot separate these from the metallic\r\nparticles because they are all heavy, this muddy mixture is washed a\r\nsecond time, and the part which is useless is thrown away. To prevent\r\nthe sieve passing this sand again too quickly, the washer lays small\r\nstones or gravel in the bottom of the sieve. However, if the sieve is\r\nnot shaken straight up and down, but is tilted to one side, the small\r\nstones or broken ore move from one part to another, and the metallic\r\nmaterial again falls into the tub, and the operation is frustrated. The\r\nminers of our country have made an even finer sieve, which does not fail\r\neven with unskilled washers; in washing with this sieve they have no\r\nneed for the bottom to be strewn with small stones. By this method the\r\nmud settles in the tub with the very fine metallic particles, and the\r\nlarger sizes of metal remain in the sieve and are covered with the\r\nvalueless sand, and this is taken away with a limp. The concentrates\r\nwhich have been collected are smelted together with other things. The\r\nmud mixed with the very fine metallic particles is washed for a third\r\ntime and in the finest sieve, whose bottom is woven of hair. If the ore\r\nis rich in metal, all the material which has been removed by the limp is\r\nwashed on the canvas strakes, or if the ore is poor it is thrown away.\r\n\r\nI have explained the methods of washing which are used in common for the\r\nores of many metals. I now come to another method of crushing ore, for I\r\nought to speak of this before describing those methods of washing which\r\nare peculiar to ores of particular metals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 313 (Stamp-mill): A--Mortar. B--Open end of mortar.\r\nC--Slab of rock. D--Iron sole plates. E--Screen. F--Launder. G--Wooden\r\nshovel. H--Settling pit. I--Iron shovel. K--Heap of material which has\r\nsettled. L--Ore which requires crushing. M--Small launder.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1512, George, the illustrious Duke of Saxony[14], gave the\r\noverlordship of all the dumps ejected from the mines in Meissen to the\r\nnoble and wise Sigismund Maltitz, father of John, Bishop of Meissen.\r\nRejecting the dry stamps, the large sieve, and the stone mills of\r\nDippoldswalde and Altenberg, in which places are dug the small black\r\nstones from which tin is smelted, he invented a machine which could\r\ncrush the ore wet under iron-shod stamps. That is called \"wet ore\" which\r\nis softened by water which flows into the mortar box, and they are\r\nsometimes called \"wet stamps\" because they are drenched by the same\r\nwater; and on the other hand, the other kinds are called \"dry stamps\" or\r\n\"dry ore,\" because no water is used to soften the ore when the stamps\r\nare crushing. But to return to our subject. This machine is not\r\ndissimilar to the one which crushes the ore with dry iron-shod stamps,\r\nbut the heads of the wet stamps are larger by half than the heads of the\r\nothers. The mortar-box, which is made of oak or beech timber, is set up\r\nin the space between the upright posts; it does not open in front, but\r\nat one end, and it is three feet long, three-quarters of a foot wide,\r\nand one foot and six digits deep. If it has no bottom, it is set up in\r\nthe same way over a slab of hard, smooth rock placed in the ground,\r\nwhich has been dug down a little. The joints are stopped up all round\r\nwith moss or cloth rags. If the mortar has a bottom, then an iron\r\nsole-plate, three feet long, three-quarters of a foot wide, and a palm\r\nthick, is placed in it. In the opening in the end of the mortar there is\r\nfixed an iron plate full of holes, in such a way that there is a space\r\nof two digits between it and the shoe of the nearest stamp, and the same\r\ndistance between this screen and the upright post, in an opening through\r\nwhich runs a small but fairly long launder. The crushed particles of\r\nsilver ore flow through this launder with the water into a settling-pit,\r\nwhile the material which settles in the launder is removed with an iron\r\nshovel to the nearest planked floor; that material which has settled in\r\nthe pit is removed with an iron shovel on to another floor. Most people\r\nmake two launders, in order that while the workman empties one of them\r\nof the accumulation which has settled in it, a fresh deposit may be\r\nsettling in the other. The water flows in through a small launder at the\r\nother end of the mortar that is near the water-wheel which turns the\r\nmachine. The workman throws the ore to be crushed into the mortar in\r\nsuch a way that the pieces, when they are thrown in among the stamps, do\r\nnot impede the work. By this method a silver or gold ore is crushed very\r\nfine by the stamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 314 (Buddle): A--Launder reaching to the screen.\r\nB--Transverse trough. C--Spouts. D--Large buddles.

H--Cross trough.]\r\n\r\nWhen tin ore is crushed by this kind of iron-shod stamps, as soon as\r\ncrushing begins, the launder which extends from the screen discharges\r\nthe water carrying the fine tin-stone and fine sand into a transverse\r\ntrough, from which the water flows down through the spouts, which pierce\r\nthe side of the trough, into the one or other of the large buddles set\r\nunderneath. The reason why there are two is that, while the washer\r\nempties the one which is filled with fine tin-stone and sand, the\r\nmaterial may flow into the other. Each buddle is twelve feet long, one\r\ncubit deep, and a foot and a half broad. The tin-stone which settles in\r\nthe upper part of the buddles is called the large size; these are\r\nfrequently stirred with a shovel, in order that the medium sized\r\nparticles of tin-stone, and the mud mixed with the very fine particles\r\nof the stones may flow away. The particles of medium size generally\r\nsettle in the middle part of the buddle, where they are arrested by\r\ninterwoven fir twigs. The mud which flows down with the water settles\r\nbetween the twigs and the board which closes the lower end of the\r\nbuddle. The tin-stone of large size is removed separately from the\r\nbuddle with a shovel; those of medium size are also removed separately,\r\nand likewise the mud is removed separately, for they are separately\r\nwashed on the canvas strakes and on the ordinary strake, and separately\r\nroasted and smelted. The tin-stone which has settled in the middle part\r\nof the buddle, is also always washed separately on the canvas strakes;\r\nbut if the particles are nearly equal in size to those which have\r\nsettled in the upper part of the buddle, they are washed with them in\r\nthe ordinary strake and are roasted and smelted with them. However, the\r\nmud is never washed with the others, either on the canvas strakes or on\r\nthe ordinary strake, but separately, and the fine tin-stone which is\r\nobtained from it is roasted and smelted separately. The two large\r\nbuddles discharge into a cross trough, and it again empties through a\r\nlaunder into a settling-pit which is outside the building.\r\n\r\nThis method of washing has lately undergone a considerable change; for\r\nthe launder which carries the water, mixed with the crushed tin-stone\r\nand fine sand which flow from the openings of the screen, does not reach\r\nto a transverse trough which is inside the same room, but runs straight\r\nthrough a partition into a small settling-pit. A boy draws a\r\nthree-toothed rake through the material which has settled in the portion\r\nof the launder outside the room, by which means the larger sized\r\nparticles of tin-stone settle at the bottom, and these the washer takes\r\nout with the wooden shovel and carries into the room; this material is\r\nthrown into an ordinary strake and swept with a wooden scrubber and\r\nwashed. As for those tin-stone particles which the water carries off\r\nfrom the strake, after they have been brought back on to the strake, he\r\nwashes them again until they are clean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 315 (Buddle): A--First launder.

(This picture does not entirely agree with the\r\ntext).]\r\n\r\nThe remaining tin-stone, mixed with sand, flows into the small\r\nsettling-pit which is within the building, and this discharges into two\r\nlarge buddles. The tin-stone of moderate size, mixed with those of\r\nfairly large size, settle in the upper part, and the small size in the\r\nlower part; but both are impure, and for this reason they are taken out\r\nseparately and the former is washed twice, first in a buddle like the\r\nsimple buddle, and afterward on an ordinary strake. Likewise the latter\r\nis washed twice, first on a canvas strake and afterward on an ordinary\r\nstrake. This buddle, which is like the simple buddle, differs from it in\r\nthe head, the whole of which in this case is sloping, while in the case\r\nof the other it is depressed in the centre. In order that the boy may be\r\nable to rest the shovel with which he cleanses the tin-stone, this\r\nsluice has a small wooden roller which turns in holes in two thick\r\nboards fixed to the sides of the buddle; if he did not do this, he would\r\nbecome over-exhausted by his task, for he spends whole days standing\r\nover these labours. The large buddle, the one like the simple buddle,\r\nthe ordinary strake, and the canvas strakes, are erected within a\r\nspecial building. In this building there is a stove that gives out heat\r\nthrough the earthen tiles or iron plates of which it is composed, in\r\norder that the washers can pursue their labours even in winter, if the\r\nrivers are not completely frozen over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 317 (Workroom with settling-pit): A--Launder from the\r\nscreen of the mortar-box. B--Three-toothed rake. C--Small settling-pit.\r\nD--Canvas. E--Strakes. F--Brooms.]\r\n\r\nOn the canvas strakes are washed the very fine tin-stone mixed with mud\r\nwhich has settled in the lower end of the large buddle, as well as in\r\nthe lower end of the simple buddle and of the ordinary strake. The\r\ncanvas is cleaned in a trough hewn out of one tree trunk and partitioned\r\noff with two boards, so that three compartments are made. The first and\r\nsecond pieces of canvas are washed in the first compartment, the third\r\nand fourth in the second compartment, the fifth and sixth in the third\r\ncompartment. Since among the very fine tin-stone there are usually some\r\ngrains of stone, rock, or marble, the master cleanses them on the\r\nordinary strake, lightly brushing the top of the material with a broom,\r\nthe twigs of which do not all run the same way, but some straight and\r\nsome crosswise. In this way the water carries off these impurities from\r\nthe strake into the settling-pit because they are lighter, and leaves\r\nthe tin-stone on the table because it is heavier.\r\n\r\nBelow all buddles or strakes, both inside and outside the building,\r\nthere are placed either settling-pits or cross-troughs into which they\r\ndischarge, in order that the water may carry on down into the stream but\r\nvery few of the most minute particles of tin-stone. The large\r\nsettling-pit which is outside the building is generally made of joined\r\nflooring, and is eight feet in length, breadth and depth. When a large\r\nquantity of mud, mixed with very fine tin-stone, has settled in it,\r\nfirst of all the water is let out by withdrawing a plug, then the mud\r\nwhich is taken out is washed outside the house on the canvas strakes,\r\nand afterward the concentrates are washed on the strake which is inside\r\nthe building. By these methods the very finest tin-stone is made clean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 318 (Streaming for Tin): A--River. B--Weir. C--Gate.\r\nD--Area. E--Meadow. F--Fence. G--Ditch.]\r\n\r\nThe mud mixed with the very fine tin-stone, which has neither settled in\r\nthe large settling-pit nor in the transverse launder which is outside\r\nthe room and below the canvas strakes, flows away and settles in the bed\r\nof the stream or river. In order to recover even a portion of the fine\r\ntin-stone, many miners erect weirs in the bed of the stream or river,\r\nvery much like those that are made above the mills, to deflect the\r\ncurrent into the races through which it flows to the water-wheels. At\r\none side of each weir there is an area dug out to a depth of five or six\r\nor seven feet, and if the nature of the place will permit, extending\r\nin every direction more than sixty feet. Thus, when the water of the\r\nriver or stream in autumn and winter inundates the land, the gates of\r\nthe weir are closed, by which means the current carries the mud mixed\r\nwith fine tin-stone into the area. In spring and summer this mud is\r\nwashed on the canvas strakes or on the ordinary strake, and even the\r\nfinest black-tin is collected. Within a distance of four thousand\r\nfathoms along the bed of the stream or river below the buildings in\r\nwhich the tin-stuff is washed, the miners do not make such weirs, but\r\nput inclined fences in the meadows, and in front of each fence they dig\r\na ditch of the same length, so that the mud mixed with the fine\r\ntin-stone, carried along by the stream or river when in flood, may\r\nsettle in the ditch and cling to the fence. When this mud is collected,\r\nit is likewise washed on canvas strakes and on the ordinary strake, in\r\norder that the fine tin-stone may be separated from it. Indeed we may\r\nsee many such areas and fences collecting mud of this kind in Meissen\r\nbelow Altenberg in the river Moglitz,--which is always of a reddish\r\ncolour when the rock containing the black tin is being crushed under the\r\nstamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 320 (Stamp-mill): A--First machine.

M--Its mortar-box.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the stamping machines. Some usually set up four\r\nmachines of this kind in one place, that is to say, two above and the\r\nsame number below. By this plan it is necessary that the current which\r\nhas been diverted should fall down from a greater height upon the upper\r\nwater-wheels, because these turn axles whose cams raise heavier stamps.\r\nThe stamp-stems of the upper machines should be nearly twice as long as\r\nthe stems of the lower ones, because all the mortar-boxes are placed on\r\nthe same level. These stamps have their tappets near their upper ends,\r\nnot as in the case of the lower stamps, which are placed just above the\r\nbottom. The water flowing down from the two upper water-wheels is caught\r\nin two broad races, from which it falls on to the two lower\r\nwater-wheels. Since all these machines have the stamps very close\r\ntogether, the stems should be somewhat cut away, to prevent the iron\r\nshoes from rubbing each other at the point where they are set into the\r\nstems. Where so many machines cannot be constructed, by reason of the\r\nnarrowness of the valley, the mountain is excavated and levelled in two\r\nplaces, one of which is higher than the other, and in this case two\r\nmachines are constructed and generally placed in one building. A broad\r\nrace receives in the same way the water which flows down from the upper\r\nwater-wheel, and similarly lets it fall on the lower water-wheel. The\r\nmortar-boxes are not then placed on one level, but each on the level\r\nwhich is appropriate to its own machine, and for this reason, two\r\nworkmen are then required to throw ore into the mortar-boxes. When no\r\nstream can be diverted which will fall from a higher place upon the top\r\nof the water-wheel, one is diverted which will turn the foot of the\r\nwheel; a great quantity of water from the stream is collected in one\r\npool capable of holding it, and from this place, when the gates are\r\nraised, the water is discharged against the wheel which turns in the\r\nrace. The buckets of a water-wheel of this kind are deeper and bent\r\nback, projecting upward; those of the former are shallower and bent\r\nforward, inclining downward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 321 (Stamp-mill): A--Stamps.

H--Canvas strake.\r\nI--Bowls shaped like a small boat. K--Settling-pit under the canvas\r\nstrake.]\r\n\r\nFurther, in the Julian and Rhaetian Alps[15] and in the Carpathian\r\nMountains, gold or even silver ore is now put under stamps, which are\r\nsometimes placed more than twenty in a row, and crushed wet in a long\r\nmortar-box. The mortar has two plates full of holes through which the\r\nore, after being crushed, flows out with the water into the transverse\r\nlaunder placed underneath, and from there it is carried down by two\r\nspouts into the heads of the canvas strakes. Each head is made of a\r\nthick broad plank, which can be raised and set upright, and to which on\r\neach side are fixed pieces projecting upward. In this plank there are\r\nmany cup-like depressions equal in size and similar in shape, in each of\r\nwhich an egg could be placed. Right down in these depressions are small\r\ncrevices which can retain the concentrates of gold or silver, and when\r\nthe hollows are nearly filled with these materials, the plank is raised\r\non one side so that the concentrates will fall into a large bowl. The\r\ncup-like depressions are washed out by dashing them with water. These\r\nconcentrates are washed separately in different bowls from those which\r\nhave settled on the canvas. This bowl is smooth and two digits wide and\r\ndeep, being in shape very similar to a small boat; it is broad in the\r\nfore part, narrow in the back, and in the middle of it there is a cross\r\ngroove, in which the particles of pure gold or silver settle, while the\r\ngrains of sand, since they are lighter, flow out of it.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Moravia, gold ore, which consists of quartz mixed with\r\ngold, is placed under the stamps and crushed wet. When crushed fine it\r\nflows out through a launder into a trough, is there stirred by a wooden\r\nscrubber, and the minute particles of gold which settle in the upper end\r\nof the trough are washed in a black bowl.\r\n\r\nSo far I have spoken of machines which crush wet ore with iron-shod\r\nstamps. I will now explain the methods of washing which are in a measure\r\npeculiar to the ore of certain metals, beginning with gold. The ore\r\nwhich contains particles of this metal, and the sand of streams and\r\nrivers which contains grains of it, are washed in frames or bowls; the\r\nsands especially are also washed in troughs. More than one method is\r\nemployed for washing on frames, for these frames either pass or retain\r\nthe particles or concentrates of gold; they pass them if they have\r\nholes, and retain them if they have no holes. But either the frame\r\nitself has holes, or a box is substituted for it; if the frame itself is\r\nperforated it passes the particles or concentrates of gold into a\r\ntrough; if the box has them, it passes the gold material into the long\r\nsluice. I will first speak of these two methods of washing. The frame is\r\nmade of two planks joined together, and is twelve feet long and three\r\nfeet wide, and is full of holes large enough for a pea to pass. To\r\nprevent the ore or sand with which the gold is mixed from falling out at\r\nthe sides, small projecting edge-boards are fixed to it. This frame is\r\nset upon two stools, the first of which is higher than the second, in\r\norder that the gravel and small stones can roll down it. The washer\r\nthrows the ore or sand into the head of the frame, which is higher, and\r\nopening the small launder, lets the water into it, and then agitates it\r\nwith a wooden scrubber. In this way, the gravel and small stones roll\r\ndown the frame on to the ground, while the particles or concentrates of\r\ngold, together with the sand, pass through the holes into the trough\r\nwhich is placed under the frame, and after being collected are washed in\r\nthe bowl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 322 (Frames for Washing Ore or Alluvial): A--Head of\r\nframe.

C--Bottom of inverted box. D--Open part of it. E--Iron hoe.\r\nF--Riffles. G--Small launder. H--Bowl with which settlings are taken\r\naway. I--Black bowl in which they are washed.]\r\n\r\nA box which has a bottom made of a plate full of holes, is placed over\r\nthe upper end of a sluice, which is fairly long but of moderate width.\r\nThe gold material to be washed is thrown into this box, and a great\r\nquantity of water is let in. The lumps, if ore is being washed, are\r\nmashed with an iron shovel. The fine portions fall through the bottom of\r\nthe box into the sluice, but the coarse pieces remain in the box, and\r\nthese are removed with a scraper through an opening which is nearly in\r\nthe middle of one side. Since a large amount of water is necessarily let\r\ninto the box, in order to prevent it from sweeping away any particles of\r\ngold which have fallen into the sluice, the sluice is divided off by\r\nten, or if it is as long again, by fifteen riffles. These riffles are\r\nplaced equidistant from one another, and each is higher than the one\r\nnext toward the lower end of the sluice. The little compartments which\r\nare thus made are filled with the material and the water which flows\r\nthrough the box; as soon as these compartments are full and the water\r\nhas begun to flow over clear, the little launder through which this\r\nwater enters into the box is closed, and the water is turned in another\r\ndirection. Then the lowest riffle is removed from the sluice, and the\r\nsediment which has accumulated flows out with the water and is caught in\r\na bowl. The riffles are removed one by one and the sediment from each is\r\ntaken into a separate bowl, and each is separately washed and cleansed\r\nin a bowl. The larger particles of gold concentrates settle in the\r\nhigher compartments, the smaller size, in the lower compartments. This\r\nbowl is shallow and smooth, and smeared with oil or some other slippery\r\nsubstance, so that the tiny particles of gold may not cling to it, and\r\nit is painted black, that the gold may be more easily discernible; on\r\nthe exterior, on both sides and in the middle, it is slightly hollowed\r\nout in order that it may be grasped and held firmly in the hands when\r\nshaken. By this method the particles or concentrates of gold settle in\r\nthe back part of the bowl; for if the back part of the bowl is tapped or\r\nshaken with one hand, as is usual, the contents move toward the fore\r\npart. In this way the Moravians, especially, wash gold ore.\r\n\r\nThe gold particles are also caught on frames which are either bare or\r\ncovered. If bare, the particles are caught in pockets; if covered, they\r\ncling to the coverings. Pockets are made in various ways, either with\r\niron wire or small cross-boards fixed to the frame, or by holes which\r\nare sunk into the sluice itself or into its head, but which do not quite\r\ngo through. These holes are round or square, or are grooves running\r\ncrosswise. The frames are either covered with skins, pieces of cloth, or\r\nturf, which I will deal with one by one in turn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 324 (Frames for Washing Ore or Alluvial): A--Plank.\r\nB--Side-boards. C--Iron wire. D--Handles.]\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the sand which contains the particles of gold from\r\nspilling out, the washer fixes side-boards to the edges of a plank which\r\nis six feet long and one and a quarter wide. He then lays crosswise many\r\niron wires a digit apart, and where they join he fixes them to the\r\nbottom plank with iron nails. Then he makes the head of the frame\r\nhigher, and into this he throws the sand which needs washing, and taking\r\nin his hands the handles which are at the head of the frame, he draws it\r\nbackward and forward several times in the river or stream. In this way\r\nthe small stones and gravel flow down along the frame, and the sand\r\nmixed with particles of gold remains in the pockets between the strips.\r\nWhen the contents of the pockets have been shaken out and collected in\r\none place, he washes them in a bowl and thus cleans the gold dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 326 (Frames for Washing Ore or Alluvial): A--Head of the\r\nsluice. B--Riffles. C--Wooden scrubber. D--Pointed stick. E--Dish.\r\nF--Its cup-like depression. G--Grooved dish.]\r\n\r\nOther people, among whom are the Lusitanians[16], fix to the sides of a\r\nsluice, which is about six feet long and a foot and a half broad, many\r\ncross-strips or riffles, which project backward and are a digit apart.\r\nThe washer or his wife lets the water into the head of the sluice, where\r\nhe throws the sand which contains the particles of gold. As it flows\r\ndown he agitates it with a wooden scrubber, which he moves transversely\r\nto the riffles. He constantly removes with a pointed wooden stick the\r\nsediment which settles in the pockets between the riffles, and in this\r\nway the particles of gold settle in them, while the sand and other\r\nvalueless materials are carried by the water into a tub placed below the\r\nsluice. He removes the particles of metal with a small wooden shovel\r\ninto a wooden bowl. This bowl does not exceed a foot and a quarter in\r\nbreadth, and by moving it up and down in the stream he cleanses the gold\r\ndust, for the remaining sand flows out of the dish, and the gold dust\r\nsettles in the middle of it, where there is a cup-like depression. Some\r\nmake use of a bowl which is grooved inside like a shell, but with a\r\nsmooth lip where the water flows out. This smooth place, however, is\r\nnarrower where the grooves run into it, and broader where the water\r\nflows out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 327 (Frames for Washing Ore or Alluvial): A--Head of the\r\nsluice. B--Side-boards. C--Lower end of the sluice. D--Pockets.\r\nE--Grooves. F--Stools. G--Shovel. H--Tub set below. I--Launder.]\r\n\r\nThe cup-like pockets and grooves are cut or burned at the same time into\r\nthe bottom of the sluice; the bottom is composed of three planks ten\r\nfeet long, and is about four feet wide; but the lower end, through which\r\nthe water is discharged, is narrower. This sluice, which likewise has\r\nside-boards fixed to its edges, is full of rounded pockets and of\r\ngrooves which lead to them, there being two grooves to one pocket, in\r\norder that the water mixed with sand may flow into each pocket through\r\nthe upper groove, and that after the sand has partly settled, the water\r\nmay again flow out through the lower groove. The sluice is set in the\r\nriver or stream or on the bank, and placed on two stools, of which the\r\nfirst is higher than the second in order that the gravel and small\r\nstones may roll down the sluice. The washer throws sand into the head\r\nwith a shovel, and opening the launder, lets in the water, which carries\r\nthe particles of metal with a little sand down into the pockets, while\r\nthe gravel and small stones with the rest of the sand falls into a tub\r\nplaced below the sluice. As soon as the pockets are filled, he brushes\r\nout the concentrates and washes them in a bowl. He washes again and\r\nagain through this sluice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 328 (Frames for Washing Ore or Alluvial): A--Cross\r\ngrooves. B--Tub set under the sluice. C--Another tub.]\r\n\r\nSome people cut a number of cross-grooves, one palm distant from each\r\nother, in a sluice similarly composed of three planks eight feet long.\r\nThe upper edge of these grooves is sloping, that the particles of gold\r\nmay slip into them when the washer stirs the sand with a wooden shovel;\r\nbut their lower edge is vertical so that the gold particles may thus be\r\nunable to slide out of them. As soon as these grooves are full of gold\r\nparticles mixed with fine sand, the sluice is removed from the stools\r\nand raised up on its head. The head in this case is nothing but the\r\nupper end of the planks of which the sluice is composed. In this way the\r\nmetallic particles, being turned over backward, fall into another tub,\r\nfor the small stones and gravel have rolled down the sluice. Some people\r\nplace large bowls under the sluice instead of tubs, and as in the other\r\ncases, the unclean concentrates are washed in the small bowl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 329 (Frames for Washing Ore or Alluvial): A--Sluice\r\ncovered with canvas. B--Its head full of pockets and grooves. C--Head\r\nremoved and washed in a tub. D--Sluice which has square pockets.\r\nE--Sluice to whose planks small shavings cling. F--Broom. G--Skins of\r\noxen. H--Wooden scrubber.]\r\n\r\nThe Thuringians cut rounded pockets, a digit in diameter and depth, in\r\nthe head of the sluice, and at the same time they cut grooves reaching\r\nfrom one to another. The sluice itself they cover with canvas. The sand\r\nwhich is to be washed, is thrown into the head and stirred with a\r\nwooden scrubber; in this way the water carries the light particles of\r\ngold on to the canvas, and the heavy ones sink in the pockets, and when\r\nthese hollows are full, the head is removed and turned over a tub, and\r\nthe concentrates are collected and washed in a bowl. Some people make\r\nuse of a sluice which has square pockets with short vertical recesses\r\nwhich hold the particles of gold. Other workers use a sluice made of\r\nplanks, which are rough by reason of the very small shavings which still\r\ncling to them; these sluices are used instead of those with coverings,\r\nof which this sluice is bare, and when the sand is washed, the particles\r\nof gold cling no less to these shavings than to canvas, or skins, or\r\ncloths, or turf. The washer sweeps the sluice upward with a broom, and\r\nwhen he has washed as much of the sand as he wishes, he lets a more\r\nabundant supply of water into the sluice again to wash out the\r\nconcentrates, which he collects in a tub set below the sluice, and then\r\nwashes again in a bowl. Just as Thuringians cover the sluice with\r\ncanvas, so some people cover it with the skins of oxen or horses. They\r\npush the auriferous sand upward with a wooden scrubber, and by this\r\nsystem the light material flows away with the water, while the particles\r\nof gold settle among the hairs; the skins are afterward washed in a tub;\r\nand the concentrates are collected in a bowl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 330 (Washing material in spring): A--Spring. B--Skin.\r\nC--Argonauts.]\r\n\r\nThe Colchians[17] placed the skins of animals in the pools of springs;\r\nand since many particles of gold had clung to them when they were\r\nremoved, poets invented the \"golden fleece\" of the Colchians. In like\r\nmanner, it can be contrived by the methods of miners that skins should\r\ntake up, not only particles of gold, but also of silver and gems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 331 (Frames for Washing Ore or Alluvial): A--Head of\r\nframe. B--Frame. C--Cloth. D--small launder. E--Tub set below the frame.\r\nF--Tub in which cloth is washed.]\r\n\r\nMany people cover the frame with a green cloth as long and wide as the\r\nframe itself, and fasten it with iron nails in such a way that they can\r\neasily draw them out and remove the cloth. When the cloth appears to be\r\ngolden because of the particles which adhere to it, it is washed in a\r\nspecial tub and the particles are collected in a bowl. The remainder\r\nwhich has run down into the tub is again washed on the frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 332 (Frames for Washing Ore or Alluvial): A--Cloth full\r\nof small knots, spread out. B--Small knots more conspicuously shown.\r\nC--Tub in which cloth is washed.]\r\n\r\nSome people, in place of a green cloth, use a cloth of tightly woven\r\nhorsehair, which has a rough knotty surface. Since these knots stand out\r\nand the cloth is rough, even the very small particles of gold adhere to\r\nit; these cloths are likewise washed in a tub with water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 333 (Frames for Washing Ore or Alluvial): A--Head of\r\nframe. B--Small launder through which water flows into head of frame.\r\nC--Pieces of turf. D--Trough placed under frame. E--Tub in which pieces\r\nof turf are washed.]\r\n\r\nSome people construct a frame not unlike the one covered with canvas,\r\nbut shorter. In place of the canvas they set pieces of turf in rows.\r\nThey wash the sand, which has been thrown into the head of the frame, by\r\nletting in water. In this way the particles of gold settle in the turf,\r\nthe mud and sand, together with the water, are carried down into the\r\nsettling-pit or trough below, which is opened when the work is finished.\r\nAfter all the water has passed out of the settling-pit, the sand and mud\r\nare carried away and washed over again in the same manner. The particles\r\nwhich have clung to the turf are afterward washed down into the\r\nsettling-pit or trough by a stronger current of the water, which is let\r\ninto the frame through a small launder. The concentrates are finally\r\ncollected and washed in a bowl. Pliny was not ignorant of this method of\r\nwashing gold. \"The ulex,\" he says, \"after being dried, is burnt, and its\r\nashes are washed over a grassy turf, that the gold may settle on it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration 334 (Trays for Washing Alluvial): A--Tray. B--Bowl-like\r\ndepression. C--Handles.]\r\n\r\nSand mixed with particles of gold is also washed in a tray, or in a\r\ntrough or bowl. The tray is open at the further end, is either hewn out\r\nof a squared trunk of a tree or made out of a thick plank to which\r\nside-boards are fixed, and is three feet long, a foot and a half wide,\r\nand three digits deep. The bottom is hollowed out into the shape of an\r\nelongated bowl whose narrow end is turned toward the head, and it has\r\ntwo long handles, by which it is drawn backward and forward in the\r\nriver. In this way the fine sand is washed, whether it contains\r\nparticles of gold or the little black stones from which tin is made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 335 (Trough for washing alluvial): A--Trough. B--Its open\r\nend. C--End that may be closed. D--Stream. E--Hoe. F--End-board.\r\nG--Bag.]\r\n\r\nThe Italians who come to the German mountains seeking gold, in order to\r\nwash the river sand which contains gold-dust and garnets,[19] use a\r\nfairly long shallow trough hewn out of a tree, rounded within and\r\nwithout, open at one end and closed at the other, which they turn in the\r\nbed of the stream in such a way that the water does not dash into it,\r\nbut flows in gently. They stir the sand, which they throw into it, with\r\na wooden hoe, also rounded. To prevent the particles of gold or garnets\r\nfrom running out with the light sand, they close the end with a board\r\nsimilarly rounded, but lower than the sides of the trough. The\r\nconcentrates of gold or garnets which, with a small quantity of heavy\r\nsand, have settled in the trough, they wash in a bowl and collect in\r\nbags and carry away with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 336 (Bowls for Alluvial Washing): A--Large bowl. B--Ropes.\r\nC--Beam. D--Other large bowl which coiners use. E--Small bowl.]\r\n\r\nSome people wash this kind of sand in a large bowl which can easily be\r\nshaken, the bowl being suspended by two ropes from a beam in a building.\r\nThe sand is thrown into it, water is poured in, then the bowl is shaken,\r\nand the muddy water is poured out and clear water is again poured in,\r\nthis being done again and again. In this way, the gold particles settle\r\nin the back part of the bowl because they are heavy, and the sand in the\r\nfront part because it is light; the latter is thrown away, the former\r\nkept for smelting. The one who does the washing then returns immediately\r\nto his task. This method of washing is rarely used by miners, but\r\nfrequently by coiners and goldsmiths when they wash gold, silver, or\r\ncopper. The bowl they employ has only three handles, one of which they\r\ngrasp in their hands when they shake the bowl, and in the other two is\r\nfastened a rope by which the bowl is hung from a beam, or from a\r\ncross-piece which is upheld by the forks of two upright posts fixed in\r\nthe ground. Miners frequently wash ore in a small bowl to test it. This\r\nbowl, when shaken, is held in one hand and thumped with the other hand.\r\nIn other respects this method of washing does not differ from the last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 337 (Ground Sluicing): A--Stream. B--Ditch. C--Mattock.\r\nD--Pieces of turf. E--Seven-pronged fork. F--Iron shovel. G--Trough.\r\nH--Another trough below it. I--Small wooden trowel.]\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the various methods of washing sand which contains\r\ngrains of gold; I will now speak of the methods of washing the material\r\nin which are mixed the small black stones from which tin is made[20].\r\nEight such methods are in use, and of these two have been invented\r\nlately. Such metalliferous material is usually found torn away from\r\nveins and stringers and scattered far and wide by the impetus of water,\r\nalthough sometimes _venae dilatatae_ are composed of it. The miners dig\r\nout the latter material with a broad mattock, while they dig the former\r\nwith a pick. But they dig out the little stones, which are not rare in\r\nthis kind of ore, with an instrument like the bill of a duck. In\r\ndistricts which contain this material, if there is an abundant supply of\r\nwater, and if there are valleys or gentle slopes and hollows, so that\r\nrivers can be diverted into them, the washers in summer-time first of\r\nall dig a long ditch sloping so that the water will run through it\r\nrapidly. Into the ditch is thrown the metallic material, together with\r\nthe surface material, which is six feet thick, more or less, and often\r\ncontains moss, roots of plants, shrubs, trees, and earth; they are all\r\nthrown in with a broad mattock, and the water flows through the ditch.\r\nThe sand and tin-stone, as they are heavy, sink to the bottom of the\r\nditch, while the moss and roots, as they are light, are carried away by\r\nthe water which flows through the ditch. The bottom of the ditch is\r\nobstructed with turf and stones in order to prevent the water from\r\ncarrying away the tin-stone at the same time. The washers, whose feet\r\nare covered with high boots made of hide, though not of rawhide,\r\nthemselves stand in the ditch and throw out of it the roots of the\r\ntrees, shrubs, and grass with seven-pronged wooden forks, and push back\r\nthe tin-stone toward the head of the ditch. After four weeks, in which\r\nthey have devoted much work and labour, they raise the tin-stone in the\r\nfollowing way; the sand with which it is mixed is repeatedly lifted from\r\nthe ditch with an iron shovel and agitated hither and thither in the\r\nwater, until the sand flows away and only the tin-stone remains on the\r\nshovel. The tin-stone is all collected together and washed again in a\r\ntrough by pushing it up and turning it over with a wooden trowel, in\r\norder that the remaining sand may separate from it. Afterward they\r\nreturn to their task, which they continue until the metalliferous\r\nmaterial is exhausted, or until the water can no longer be diverted into\r\nthe ditches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 338 (Sluicing Tin): A--Trough.

L--Pick like\r\nthe beak of a duck with which the miner digs out the material from which\r\nthe small stones are obtained.]\r\n\r\nThe trough which I mentioned is hewn out of the trunk of a tree and the\r\ninterior is five feet long, three-quarters of a foot deep, and six\r\ndigits wide. It is placed on an incline and under it is put a tub which\r\ncontains interwoven fir twigs, or else another trough is put under it,\r\nthe interior of which is three feet long and one foot wide and deep; the\r\nfine tin-stone, which has run out with the water, settles in the bottom.\r\nSome people, in place of a trough, put a square launder underneath, and\r\nin like manner they wash the tin-stone in this by agitating it up and\r\ndown and turning it over with a small wooden trowel. A transverse trough\r\nis put under the launder, which is either open on one end and drains off\r\ninto a tub or settling-pit, or else is closed and perforated through the\r\nbottom; in this case, it drains into a ditch beneath, where the water\r\nfalls when the plug has been partly removed. The nature of this ditch I\r\nwill now describe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 340 (Sluicing Tin): A--Launder. B--Interlacing fir twigs.\r\nC--Logs; three on one side, for the fourth cannot be seen because the\r\nditch is so full with material now being washed. D--Logs at the head of\r\nthe ditch. E--Barrow. F--Seven-pronged fork. G--Hoe.]\r\n\r\nIf the locality does not supply an abundance of water, the washers dig a\r\nditch thirty or thirty-six feet long, and cover the bottom, the full\r\nlength, with logs joined together and hewn on the side which lies flat\r\non the ground. On each side of the ditch, and at its head also, they\r\nplace four logs, one above the other, all hewn smooth on the inside. But\r\nsince the logs are laid obliquely along the sides, the upper end of the\r\nditch is made four feet wide and the tail end, two feet. The water has a\r\nhigh drop from a launder and first of all it falls into interlaced fir\r\ntwigs, in order that it shall fall straight down for the most part in an\r\nunbroken stream and thus break up the lumps by its weight. Some do not\r\nplace these twigs under the end of the launder, but put a plug in its\r\nmouth, which, since it does not entirely close the launder, nor\r\naltogether prevent the discharge from it, nor yet allow the water to\r\nspout far afield, makes it drop straight down. The workman brings in a\r\nwheelbarrow the material to be washed, and throws it into the ditch. The\r\nwasher standing in the upper end of the ditch breaks the lumps with a\r\nseven-pronged fork, and throws out the roots of trees, shrubs, and grass\r\nwith the same instrument, and thereby the small black stones settle\r\ndown. When a large quantity of the tin-stone has accumulated, which\r\ngenerally happens when the washer has spent a day at this work, to\r\nprevent it from being washed away he places it upon the bank, and other\r\nmaterial having been again thrown into the upper end of the ditch, he\r\ncontinues the task of washing. A boy stands at the lower end of the\r\nditch, and with a thin pointed hoe stirs up the sediment which has\r\nsettled at the lower end, to prevent the washed tin-stone from being\r\ncarried further, which occurs when the sediment has accumulated to such\r\nan extent that the fir branches at the outlet of the ditch are covered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 341 (Sifting Ore): A--Strakes. B--Tank. C--Launder.\r\nD--Plug. E--Wooden shovel. F--Wooden mallet. G--Wooden shovel with short\r\nhandle. H--The plug in the strake. I--Tank placed under the plug.]\r\n\r\nThe third method of washing materials of this kind follows. Two strakes\r\nare made, each of which is twelve feet long and a foot and a half wide\r\nand deep. A tank is set at their head, into which the water flows\r\nthrough a little launder. A boy throws the ore into one strake; if it is\r\nof poor quality he puts in a large amount of it, if it is rich he puts\r\nin less. The water is let in by removing the plug, the ore is stirred\r\nwith a wooden shovel, and in this way the tin-stone, mixed with the\r\nheavier material, settles in the bottom of the strake, and the water\r\ncarries the light material into the launder, through which it flows on\r\nto a canvas strake. The very fine tin-stone, carried by the water,\r\nsettles on to the canvas and is cleansed. A low cross-board is placed in\r\nthe strake near the head, in order that the largest sized tin-stone may\r\nsettle there. As soon as the strake is filled with the material which\r\nhas been washed, he closes the mouth of the tank and continues washing\r\nin the other strake, and then the plug is withdrawn and the water and\r\ntin-stone flow down into a tank below. Then he pounds the sides of the\r\nloaded strake with a wooden mallet, in order that the tin-stone clinging\r\nto the sides may fall off; all that has settled in it, he throws out\r\nwith a wooden shovel which has a short handle. Silver slags which have\r\nbeen crushed under the stamps, also fragments of silver-lead alloy and\r\nof cakes melted from pyrites, are washed in a strake of this kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 342 (Sifting Ore): A--Sieve. B--Tub. C--Water flowing out\r\nof the bottom of it. D--Strake. E--Three-toothed rake. F--Wooden\r\nscrubber.]\r\n\r\nMaterial of this kind is also washed while wet, in a sieve whose bottom\r\nis made of woven iron wire, and this is the fourth method of washing.\r\nThe sieve is immersed in the water which is contained in a tub, and is\r\nviolently shaken. The bottom of this tub has an opening of such size\r\nthat as much water, together with tailings from the sieve, can flow\r\ncontinuously out of it as water flows into it. The material which\r\nsettles in the strake, a boy either digs over with a three-toothed iron\r\nrake or sweeps with a wooden scrubber; in this way the water carries off\r\na great part of both sand and mud. The tin-stone or metalliferous\r\nconcentrates settle in the strake and are afterward washed in another\r\nstrake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 343 (Sluicing Tin): A--Box. B--Perforated plate.\r\nC--Trough. D--Cross-boards. E--Pool. F--Launder. G--Shovel. H--Rake.]\r\n\r\nThese are ancient methods of washing material which contains tin-stone;\r\nthere follow two modern methods. If the tin-stone mixed with earth or\r\nsand is found on the slopes of mountains or hills, or in the level\r\nfields which are either devoid of streams or into which a stream cannot\r\nbe diverted, miners have lately begun to employ the following method of\r\nwashing, even in the winter months. An open box is constructed of\r\nplanks, about six feet long, three feet wide, and two feet and one palm\r\ndeep. At the upper end on the inside, an iron plate three feet long and\r\nwide is fixed, at a depth of one foot and a half from the top; this\r\nplate is very full of holes, through which tin-stone about the size of a\r\npea can fall. A trough hewn from a tree is placed under the box, and\r\nthis trough is about twenty-four feet long and three-quarters of a foot\r\nwide and deep; very often three cross-boards are placed in it, dividing\r\nit off into compartments, each one of which is lower than the next. The\r\nturbid waters discharge into a settling-pit.\r\n\r\nThe metalliferous material is sometimes found not very deep beneath the\r\nsurface of the earth, but sometimes so deep that it is necessary to\r\ndrive tunnels and sink shafts. It is transported to the washing-box in\r\nwheelbarrows, and when the washers are about to begin they lay a small\r\nlaunder, through which there flows on to the iron plate so much water\r\nas is necessary for this washing. Next, a boy throws the metalliferous\r\nmaterial on to the iron plate with an iron shovel and breaks the small\r\nlumps, stirring them this way and that with the same implement. Then the\r\nwater and sand penetrating the holes of the plate, fall into the box,\r\nwhile all the coarse gravel remains on the plate, and this he throws\r\ninto a wheelbarrow with the same shovel. Meantime, a younger boy\r\ncontinually stirs the sand under the plate with a wooden scrubber nearly\r\nas wide as the box, and drives it to the upper end of the box; the\r\nlighter material, as well as a small amount of tin-stone, is carried by\r\nthe water down into the underlying trough. The boys carry on this labour\r\nwithout intermission until they have filled four wheelbarrows with the\r\ncoarse and worthless residues, which they carry off and throw away, or\r\nthree wheelbarrows if the material is rich in black tin. Then the\r\nforeman has the plank removed which was in front of the iron plate, and\r\non which the boy stood. The sand, mixed with the tin-stone, is\r\nfrequently pushed backward and forward with a scrubber, and the same\r\nsand, because it is lighter, takes the upper place, and is removed as\r\nsoon as it appears; that which takes the lower place is turned over with\r\na spade, in order that any that is light can flow away; when all the\r\ntin-stone is heaped together, he shovels it out of the box and carries\r\nit away. While the foreman does this, one boy with an iron hoe stirs the\r\nsand mixed with fine tin-stone, which has run out of the box and has\r\nsettled in the trough and pushes it back to the uppermost part of the\r\ntrough, and this material, since it contains a very great amount of\r\ntin-stone, is thrown on to the plate and washed again. The material\r\nwhich has settled in the lowest part of the trough is taken out\r\nseparately and piled in a heap, and is washed on the ordinary strake;\r\nthat which has settled in the pool is washed on the canvas strake. In\r\nthe summer-time this fruitful labour is repeated more often, in fact ten\r\nor eleven times. The tin-stone which the foreman removes from the box,\r\nis afterward washed in a jigging sieve, and lastly in a tub, where at\r\nlength all the sand is separated out. Finally, any material in which are\r\nmixed particles of other metals, can be washed by all these methods,\r\nwhether it has been disintegrated from veins or stringers, or whether it\r\noriginated from _venae dilatatae_, or from streams and rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 345 (Ground Sluicing): A--Launder. B--Cross trough. C--Two\r\nspouts. D--Boxes. E--Plate. F--Grating. G--Shovels. H--Second cross\r\ntrough. I--Strake. K--Wooden scrubber. L--Third cross trough.\r\nM--Launder. N--Three-toothed rake.]\r\n\r\nThe sixth method of washing material of this kind is even more modern\r\nand more useful than the last. Two boxes are constructed, into each of\r\nwhich water flows through spouts from a cross trough into which it has\r\nbeen discharged through a pipe or launder. When the material has been\r\nagitated and broken up with iron shovels by two boys, part of it runs\r\ndown and falls through the iron plates full of holes, or through the\r\niron grating, and flows out of the box over a sloping surface into\r\nanother cross trough, and from this into a strake seven feet long and\r\ntwo and a half feet wide. Then the foreman again stirs it with a wooden\r\nscrubber that it may become clean. As for the material which has flowed\r\ndown with the water and settled in the third cross trough, or in the\r\nlaunder which leads from it, a third boy rakes it with a two-toothed\r\nrake; in this way the fine tin-stone settles down and the water carries\r\noff the valueless sand into the creek. This method of washing is most\r\nadvantageous, for four men can do the work of washing in two boxes,\r\nwhile the last method, if doubled, requires six men, for it requires two\r\nboys to throw the material to be washed on to the plate and to stir it\r\nwith iron shovels; two more are required with wooden scrubbers to keep\r\nstirring the sand, mixed with the tin-stone, under the plate, and to\r\npush it toward the upper end of the box; further, two foremen are\r\nrequired to clean the tin-stone in the way I have described. In the\r\nplace of a plate full of holes, they now fix in the boxes a grating made\r\nof iron wire as thick as the stalks of rye; that these may not be\r\ndepressed by the weight and become bent, three iron bars support them,\r\nbeing laid crosswise underneath. To prevent the grating from being\r\nbroken by the iron shovels with which the material is stirred in\r\nwashing, five or six iron rods are placed on top in cross lines, and are\r\nfixed to the box so that the shovels may rub them instead of the\r\ngrating; for this reason the grating lasts longer than the plates,\r\nbecause it remains intact, while the rods, when worn by rubbing, can\r\neasily be replaced by others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 346 (Ground Sluicing): A--Pits. B--Torrent.\r\nC--Seven-pronged fork. D--Shovel.]\r\n\r\nMiners use the seventh method of washing when there is no stream of\r\nwater in the part of the mountain which contains the black tin, or\r\nparticles of gold, or of other metals. In this case they frequently dig\r\nmore than fifty ditches on the slope below, or make the same number of\r\npits, six feet long, three feet wide, and three-quarters of a foot deep,\r\nnot any great distance from each other. At the season when a torrent\r\nrises from storms of great violence or long duration, and rushes down\r\nthe mountain, some of the miners dig the metalliferous material in the\r\nwoods with broad hoes and drag it to the torrent. Other miners divert\r\nthe torrent into the ditches or pits, and others throw the roots of\r\ntrees, shrubs, and grass out of the ditches or pits with seven-pronged\r\nwooden forks. When the torrent has run down, they remove with shovels\r\nthe uncleansed tin-stone or particles of metal which have settled in the\r\nditches or pits, and cleanse it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 347 (Ground Sluicing): A--Gully. B--Ditch. C--Torrent.\r\nD--Sluice box employed by the Lusitanians.]\r\n\r\nThe eighth method is also employed in the regions which the Lusitanians\r\nhold in their power and sway, and is not dissimilar to the last. They\r\ndrive a great number of deep ditches in rows in the gullies, slopes,\r\nand hollows of the mountains. Into these ditches the water, whether\r\nflowing down from snow melted by the heat of the sun or from rain,\r\ncollects and carries together with earth and sand, sometimes tin-stone,\r\nor, in the case of the Lusitanians, the particles of gold loosened from\r\nveins and stringers. As soon as the waters of the torrent have all run\r\naway, the miners throw the material out of the ditches with iron\r\nshovels, and wash it in a common sluice box.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 348 (Trough for washing alluvial): A--Trough. B--Launder.\r\nC--Hoe. D--Sieve.]\r\n\r\nThe Poles wash the impure lead from _venae dilatatae_ in a trough ten\r\nfeet long, three feet wide, and one and one-quarter feet deep. It is\r\nmixed with moist earth and is covered by a wet and sandy clay, and so\r\nfirst of all the clay, and afterward the ore, is dug out. The ore is\r\ncarried to a stream or river, and thrown into a trough into which water\r\nis admitted by a little launder, and the washer standing at the lower\r\nend of the trough drags the ore out with a narrow and nearly pointed\r\nhoe, whose wooden handle is nearly ten feet long. It is washed over\r\nagain once or twice in the same way and thus made pure. Afterward when\r\nit has been dried in the sun they throw it into a copper sieve, and\r\nseparate the very small pieces which pass through the sieve from the\r\nlarger ones; of these the former are smelted in a faggot pile and the\r\nlatter in the furnace. Of such a number then are the methods of washing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 349 (Tin burning Furnace): A--Furnace. B--Its mouth.\r\nC--Poker. D--Rake with two teeth. E--Hoe.]\r\n\r\nOne method of burning is principally employed, and two of roasting. The\r\nblack tin is burned by a hot fire in a furnace similar to an oven[21];\r\nit is burned if it is a dark-blue colour, or if pyrites and the stone\r\nfrom which iron is made are mixed with it, for the dark blue colour if\r\nnot burnt, consumes the tin. If pyrites and the other stone are not\r\nvolatilised into fumes in a furnace of this kind, the tin which is made\r\nfrom the tin-stone is impure. The tin-stone is thrown either into the\r\nback part of the furnace, or into one side of it; but in the former case\r\nthe wood is placed in front, in the latter case alongside, in such a\r\nmanner, however, that neither firebrands nor coals may fall upon the\r\ntin-stone itself or touch it. The fuel is manipulated by a poker made of\r\nwood. The tin-stone is now stirred with a rake with two teeth, and now\r\nagain levelled down with a hoe, both of which are made of iron. The very\r\nfine tin-stone requires to be burned less than that of moderate size,\r\nand this again less than that of the largest size. While the tin-stone\r\nis being thus burned, it frequently happens that some of the material\r\nruns together.\r\n\r\nThe burned tin-stone should then be washed again on the strake, for in\r\nthis way the material which has been run together is carried away by the\r\nwater into the cross-trough, where it is gathered up and worked over,\r\nand again washed on the strake. By this method the metal is separated\r\nfrom that which is devoid of metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 350 (Stall Roasting Matte): A--Pits. B--Wood. C--Cakes.\r\nD--Launder.]\r\n\r\nCakes from pyrites, or _cadmia_, or cupriferous stones, are roasted in\r\nquadrangular pits, of which the front and top are open, and these pits\r\nare generally twelve feet long, eight feet wide, and three feet deep.\r\nThe cakes of melted pyrites are usually roasted twice over, and those of\r\n_cadmia_ once. These latter are first rolled in mud moistened with\r\nvinegar, to prevent the fire from consuming too much of the copper with\r\nthe bitumen, or sulphur, or orpiment, or realgar. The cakes of pyrites\r\nare first roasted in a slow fire and afterward in a fierce one, and in\r\nboth cases, during the whole following night, water is let in, in order\r\nthat, if there is in the cakes any alum or vitriol or saltpetre capable\r\nof injuring the metals, although it rarely does injure them, the water\r\nmay remove it and make the cakes soft. The solidified juices are nearly\r\nall harmful to the metal, when cakes or ore of this kind are smelted.\r\nThe cakes which are to be roasted are placed on wood piled up in the\r\nform of a crate, and this pile is fired[22].\r\n\r\n[Illustration 351 (Matte Roasting): A--Cakes. B--Bundles of faggots.\r\nC--Furnaces.]\r\n\r\nThe cakes which are made of copper smelted from schist are first thrown\r\nupon the ground and broken, and then placed in the furnace on bundles of\r\nfaggots, and these are lighted. These cakes are generally roasted seven\r\ntimes and occasionally nine times. While this is being done, if they are\r\nbituminous, then the bitumen burns and can be smelled. These furnaces\r\nhave a structure like the structure of the furnaces in which ore is\r\nsmelted, except that they are open in front; they are six feet high and\r\nfour feet wide. As for this kind of furnace, three of them are required\r\nfor one of those in which the cakes are melted. First of all they are\r\nroasted in the first furnace, then when they are cooled, they are\r\ntransferred into the second furnace and again roasted; later they are\r\ncarried to the third, and afterward back to the first, and this order is\r\npreserved until they have been roasted seven or nine times.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] As would be expected, practically all the technical terms used by\r\nAgricola in this chapter are adaptations. The Latin terms, _canalis_,\r\n_area_, _lacus_, _vasa_, _cribrum_, and _fossa_, have had to be pressed\r\ninto service for many different devices, largely by extemporised\r\ncombinations. Where the devices described have become obsolete, we have\r\nadopted the nomenclature of the old works on Cornish methods. The\r\nfollowing examples may be of interest:--\r\n\r\n  Simple buddle   = _Canalis simplex_\r\n  Divided buddle  = _Canalis tabellis distinctus_\r\n  Ordinary strake = _Canalis devexus_\r\n  Short strake    = _Area curta_\r\n  Canvas strake   = _Area linteis extensis contecta_\r\n  Limp            = _Radius_.\r\n\r\nThe strake (or streke) when applied to alluvial tin, would have been\r\ntermed a \"tye\" in some parts of Cornwall, and the \"short strake\" a\r\n\"gounce.\" In the case of the stamp mill, inasmuch as almost every\r\nmechanical part has its counterpart in a modern mill, we have considered\r\nthe reader will have less difficulty if the modern designations are used\r\ninstead of the old Cornish. The following are the essential terms in\r\nmodern, old Cornish, and Latin:--\r\n\r\n  Stamp          Stamper      _Pilum_\r\n  Stamp-stem     Lifter       _Pilum_\r\n  Shoes          Stamp-heads  _Capita_\r\n  Mortar-box     Box          _Capsa_\r\n  Cam-shaft      Barrell      _Axis_\r\n  Cams           Caps         _Dentes_\r\n  Tappets        Tongues      _Pili dentes_\r\n  Screen         Crate        _Laminae foraminum plenae_\r\n  Settling pit   Catchers     _Lacus_\r\n  Jigging sieve  Dilleugher   _Cribrum angustum_\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Agricola uses four Latin verbs in connection with heat operations at\r\ntemperatures under the melting point: _Calefacio_, _uro_, _torreo_, and\r\n_cremo_. The first he always uses in the sense of \"to warm\" or \"to\r\nheat,\" but the last three he uses indiscriminately in much the same way\r\nas the English verbs burn, roast, and calcine are used; but in general\r\nhe uses the Latin verbs in the order given to indicate degrees of heat.\r\nWe have used the English verbs in their technical sense as indicated by\r\nthe context.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to say when roasting began as a distinct and\r\nseparate metallurgical step in sulphide ore treatment. The Greeks and\r\nRomans worked both lead and copper sulphides (see note on p. 391, and\r\nnote on p. 403), but neither in the remains of old works nor in their\r\nliterature is there anything from which satisfactory details of such a\r\nstep can be obtained. The Ancients, of course, understood lime-burning,\r\nand calcined several salts to purify them or to render them more\r\ncaustic. Practically the only specific mention is by Pliny regarding\r\nlead ores (see p. 391). Even the statement of Theophilus (1050-1100,\r\nA.D.), may refer simply to rendering ore more fragile, for he says (p.\r\n305) in regard to copper ore: \"This stone dug up in abundance is placed\r\nupon a pile and burned (_comburitur_) after the manner of lime. Nor does\r\nit change colour, but loses its hardness and can be broken up, and\r\nafterward it is smelted.\" The _Probierbuechlein_ casually mentions\r\nroasting prior to assaying, and Biringuccio (III, 2) mentions\r\nincidentally that \"dry and ill-disposed ores before everything must be\r\nroasted in an open oven so that the air can get in.\" He gives no further\r\ninformation; and therefore this account of Agricola's becomes\r\npractically the first. Apparently roasting, as a preliminary to the\r\ntreatment of copper sulphides, did not come into use in England until\r\nsome time later than Agricola, for in Col. Grant Francis' \"Smelting of\r\nCopper in the Swansea District\" (London, 1881, p. 29), a report is set\r\nof the \"Doeinges of Jochim Ganse\"--an imported German--at the \"Mynes by\r\nKeswicke in Cumberland, A.D., 1581,\" wherein the delinquencies of the\r\nthen current practice are described: \"Thei never coulde, nether yet can\r\nmake (copper) under XXII. tymes passinge thro the fire, and XXII. weekes\r\ndoeing thereof ane sometyme more. But now the nature of these IX.\r\nhurtfull humors abovesaid being discovered and opened by Jochim's way of\r\ndoeing, we can, by his order of workeinge, so correct theim, that parte\r\nof theim beinge by nature hurtfull to the copper in wasteinge of it, ar\r\nby arte maide freindes, and be not onely an encrease to the copper, but\r\nfurther it in smeltinge; and the rest of the other evill humors shalbe\r\nso corrected, and their humors so taken from them, that by once\r\nrosteinge and once smeltinge the ure (which shalbe done in the space of\r\nthree dayes), the same copper ure shall yeeld us black copper.\" Jochim\r\nproposed by 'rostynge' to be rid of \"sulphur, arsineque, and antimony.\"\r\n\r\n[3] _Orpiment_ and _realgar_ are the red and yellow arsenical sulphides.\r\n(See note on p. 111).\r\n\r\n[4] _Cadmia bituminosa_. The description of this substance by Agricola,\r\ngiven below, indicates that it was his term for the complex\r\ncopper-zinc-arsenic-cobalt minerals found in the well-known, highly\r\nbituminous, copper schists at Mannsfeld. The later Mineralogists,\r\nWallerius (_Mineralogia_, Stockholm, 1747), Valmont De Bomare\r\n(_Mineralogie_, Paris, 1762), and others assume Agricola's _cadmia\r\nbituminosa_ to be \"black arsenic\" or \"arsenic noir,\" but we see no\r\nreason for this assumption. Agricola's statement (_De Nat. Foss._, p.\r\n369) is \"... the schistose stone dug up at the foot of the Melibocus\r\nMountains, or as they are now called the Harz (_Hercynium_), near\r\nEisleben, Mannsfeld, and near Hettstedt, is similar to _spinos_ (a\r\nbituminous substance described by Theophrastus), if not identical with\r\nit. This is black, bituminous, and cupriferous, and when first extracted\r\nfrom the mine it is thrown out into an open space and heaped up in a\r\nmound. Then the lower part of the mound is surrounded by faggots, on to\r\nwhich are likewise thrown stones of the same kind. Then the faggots are\r\nkindled and the fire soon spreads to the stones placed upon them; by\r\nthese the fire is communicated to the next, which thus spreads to the\r\nwhole heap. This easy reception of fire is a characteristic which\r\nbitumen possesses in common with sulphur. Yet the small, pure and black\r\nbituminous ore is distinguished from the stones as follows: when they\r\nburn they emit the kind of odour which is usually given off by burning\r\nbituminous coal, and besides, if while they are burning a small shower\r\nof rain should fall, they burn more brightly and soften more quickly.\r\nIndeed, when the wind carries the fumes so that they descend into nearby\r\nstanding waters, there can be seen floating in it something like a\r\nbituminous liquid, either black, or brown, or purple, which is\r\nsufficient to indicate that those stones were bituminous. And that genus\r\nof stones has been recently found in the Harz in layers, having\r\noccasionally gold-coloured specks of pyrites adhering to them,\r\nrepresenting various flat sea-fish or pike or perch or birds, and\r\npoultry cocks, and sometimes salamanders.\"\r\n\r\n[5] _Atramentum sutorium rubrum_. Literally, this would be red vitriol.\r\nThe German translation gives _rot kupferwasser_, also red vitriol. We\r\nmust confess that we cannot make this substance out, nor can we find it\r\nmentioned in the other works of Agricola. It may be the residue from\r\nleaching roasted pyrites for vitriol, which would be reddish oxide of\r\niron.\r\n\r\n[6] The statement \"elsewhere\" does not convey very much more\r\ninformation. It is (_De Nat. Fos._, p. 253): \"When Goslar pyrites and\r\nEisleben (copper) schists are placed on the pyre and roasted for the\r\nthird time, they both exude a certain substance which is of a greenish\r\ncolour, dry, rough, and fibrous (_tenue_). This substance, like\r\nasbestos, is not consumed by the fire. The schists exude it more\r\nplentifully than the pyrites.\" The _Interpretatio_ gives _federwis_, as\r\nthe German equivalent of _amiantus_ (asbestos). This term was used for\r\nthe feathery alum efflorescence on aluminous slates.\r\n\r\n[7] Bearing in mind that bituminous cadmia contained arsenical-cobalt\r\nminerals, this substance \"resembling _pompholyx_\" would probably be\r\narsenic oxide. In _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 368). Agricola discusses the\r\n_pompholyx_ from _cadmia_ at length and pronounces it to be of\r\nremarkably \"corrosive\" quality. (See also note on p. 112.)\r\n\r\n[8] HISTORICAL NOTE ON CRUSHING AND CONCENTRATION OF ORES. There can be\r\nno question that the first step in the metallurgy of ores was direct\r\nsmelting, and that this antedates human records. The obvious advantages\r\nof reducing the bulk of the material to be smelted by the elimination of\r\nbarren portions of the ore, must have appealed to metallurgists at a\r\nvery early date. Logically, therefore, we should find the second step in\r\nmetallurgy to be concentration in some form. The question of crushing is\r\nso much involved with concentration that we have not endeavoured to keep\r\nthem separate. The earliest indication of these processes appears to be\r\ncertain inscriptions on monuments of the IV Dynasty (4,000 B.C.?)\r\ndepicting gold washing (Wilkinson, The Ancient Egyptians, London, 1874,\r\nII, p. 137). Certain stelae of the XII Dynasty (2,400 B.C.) in the\r\nBritish Museum (144 Bay 1 and 145 Bay 6) refer to gold washing in the\r\nSudan, and one of them appears to indicate the working of gold ore as\r\ndistinguished from alluvial. The first written description of the\r\nEgyptian methods--and probably that reflecting the most ancient\r\ntechnology of crushing and concentration--is that of Agatharchides, a\r\nGreek geographer of the second Century B.C. This work is lost, but the\r\npassage in question is quoted by Diodorus Siculus (1st Century B.C.) and\r\nby Photius (died 891 A.D.). We give Booth's translation of Diodorus\r\n(London, 1700, p. 89), slightly amended: \"In the confines of Egypt and\r\nthe neighbouring countries of Arabia and Ethiopia there is a place full\r\nof rich gold mines, out of which with much cost and pains of many\r\nlabourers gold is dug. The soil here is naturally black, but in the body\r\nof the earth run many white veins, shining like white marble, surpassing\r\nin lustre all other bright things. Out of these laborious mines, those\r\nappointed overseers cause the gold to be dug up by the labour of a vast\r\nmultitude of people. For the Kings of Egypt condemn to these mines\r\nnotorious criminals, captives taken in war, persons sometimes falsely\r\naccused, or against whom the King is incens'd; and not only they\r\nthemselves, but sometimes all their kindred and relations together with\r\nthem, are sent to work here, both to punish them, and by their labour to\r\nadvance the profit and gain of the Kings. There are infinite numbers\r\nupon these accounts thrust down into these mines, all bound in fetters,\r\nwhere they work continually, without being admitted any rest night or\r\nday, and so strictly guarded that there is no possibility or way left to\r\nmake an escape. For they set over them barbarians, soldiers of various\r\nand strange languages, so that it is not possible to corrupt any of the\r\nguard by discoursing one with another, or by the gaining insinuations of\r\nfamiliar converse. The earth which is hardest and full of gold they\r\nsoften by putting fire under it, and then work it out with their hands.\r\nThe rocks thus soften'd and made more pliant and yielding, several\r\nthousands of profligate wretches break in pieces with hammers and\r\npickaxes. There is one artist that is the overseer of the whole work,\r\nwho marks out the stone, and shows the labourers the way and manner how\r\nhe would have it done. Those that are the strongest amongst them that\r\nare appointed to this slavery, provided with sharp iron pickaxes, cleave\r\nthe marble-shining rock by mere force and strength, and not by arts or\r\nsleight-of-hand. They undermine not the rock in a direct line, but\r\nfollow the bright shining vein of the mine. They carry lamps fastened to\r\ntheir foreheads to give them light, being otherwise in perfect darkness\r\nin the various windings and turnings wrought in the mine; and having\r\ntheir bodies appearing sometimes of one colour and sometimes of another\r\n(according to the nature of the mine where they work) they throw the\r\nlumps and pieces of the stone cut out of the rock upon the floor. And\r\nthus they are employed continually without intermission, at the very nod\r\nof the overseer, who lashes them severely besides. And there are little\r\nboys who penetrate through the galleries into the cavities and with\r\ngreat labour and toil gather up the lumps and pieces hewed out of the\r\nrock as they are cast upon the ground, and carry them forth and lay them\r\nupon the bank. Those that are over thirty years of age take a piece of\r\nthe rock of such a certain quantity, and pound it in a stone mortar with\r\niron pestles till it be as small as a vetch; then those little stones so\r\npounded are taken from them by women and older men, who cast them into\r\nmills that stand together there near at hand in a long row, and two or\r\nthree of them being employed at one mill they grind a certain measure\r\ngiven to them at a time, until it is as small as fine meal. No care at\r\nall is taken of the bodies of these poor creatures, so that they have\r\nnot a rag so much as to cover their nakedness, and no man that sees them\r\ncan choose but commiserate their sad and deplorable condition. For\r\nthough they are sick, maimed, or lame, no rest nor intermission in the\r\nleast is allowed them; neither the weakness of old age, nor women's\r\ninfirmities are any plea to excuse them; but all are driven to their\r\nwork with blows and cudgelling, till at length, overborne with the\r\nintolerable weight of their misery, they drop down dead in the midst of\r\ntheir insufferable labours; so that these miserable creatures always\r\nexpect the future to be more terrible than even the present, and\r\ntherefore long for death as far more desirable than life.\r\n\r\n\"At length the masters of the work take the stone thus ground to powder,\r\nand carry it away in order to perfect it. They spread the mineral so\r\nground upon a broad board, somewhat sloping, and pouring water upon it,\r\nrub it and cleanse it; and so all the earthy and drossy part being\r\nseparated from the rest by the water, it runs off the board, and the\r\ngold by reason of its weight remains behind. Then washing it several\r\ntimes again, they first rub it lightly with their hands; afterward they\r\ndraw off any earthy and drossy matter with slender sponges gently\r\napplied to the powdered dust, till it be clean, pure gold. At last other\r\nworkmen take it away by weight and measure, and these put it into\r\nearthen pots, and according to the quantity of the gold in every pot\r\nthey mix with it some lead, grains of salt, a little tin and barley\r\nbran. Then, covering every pot close, and carefully daubing them over\r\nwith clay, they put them in a furnace, where they abide five days and\r\nnights together; then after a convenient time that they have stood to\r\ncool, nothing of the other matter is to be found in the pots but only\r\npure, refined gold, some little thing diminished in the weight. And thus\r\ngold is prepared in the borders of Egypt, and perfected and completed\r\nwith so many and so great toils and vexations. And, therefore, I cannot\r\nbut conclude that nature itself teaches us, that as gold is got with\r\nlabour and toil, so it is kept with difficulty; it creates everywhere\r\nthe greatest cares; and the use of it is mixed both with pleasure and\r\nsorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe remains at Mt. Laurion show many of the ancient mills and\r\nconcentration works of the Greeks, but we cannot be absolutely certain\r\nat what period in the history of these mines crushing and concentration\r\nwere introduced. While the mines were worked with great activity prior\r\nto 500 B.C. (see note 6, p. 27), it was quite feasible for the ancient\r\nminer to have smelted these argentiferous lead ores direct. However, at\r\nsome period prior to the decadence of the mines in the 3rd Century B.C.,\r\nthere was in use an extensive system of milling and concentration. For\r\nthe following details we are indebted mostly to Edouard Ardaillon (_Les\r\nMines Du Laurion dans l'Antiquite_, Chap. IV.). The ore was first\r\nhand-picked (in 1869 one portion of these rejects was estimated at\r\n7,000,000 tons) and afterward it was apparently crushed in stone mortars\r\nsome 16 to 24 inches in diameter, and thence passed to the mills. These\r\nmills, which crushed dry, were of the upper and lower millstone order,\r\nlike the old-fashioned flour mills, and were turned by hand. The stones\r\nwere capable of adjustment in such a way as to yield different sizes.\r\nThe sand was sifted and the oversize returned to the mills. From the\r\nmills it was taken to washing plants, which consisted essentially of an\r\ninclined area, below which a canal, sometimes with riffles, led through\r\na series of basins, ultimately returning the water again to near the\r\nhead of the area. These washing areas, constructed with great care, were\r\nmade of stone cemented over smoothly, and were so efficiently done as to\r\nremain still intact. In washing, a workman brushed upward the pulp\r\nplaced on the inclined upper portion of the area, thus concentrating\r\nthere a considerable proportion of the galena; what escaped had an\r\nopportunity to settle in the sequence of basins, somewhat on the order\r\nof the buddle. A quotation by Strabo (III, 2, 10) from the lost work of\r\nPolybius (200-125 B.C.) also indicates concentration of lead-silver ores\r\nin Spain previous to the Christian era: \"Polybius speaking of the silver\r\nmines of New Carthage, tells us that they are extremely large, distant\r\nfrom the city about 20 stadia, and occupy a circuit of 400 stadia, that\r\nthere are 40,000 men regularly engaged in them, and that they yield\r\ndaily to the Roman people (a revenue of) 25,000 drachmae. The rest of\r\nthe process I pass over, as it is too long, but as for the silver ore\r\ncollected, he tells us that it is broken up, and sifted through sieves\r\nover water; that what remains is to be again broken, and the water\r\nhaving been strained off, it is to be sifted and broken a third time.\r\nThe dregs which remain after the fifth time are to be melted, and the\r\nlead being poured off, the silver is obtained pure. These silver mines\r\nstill exist; however, they are no longer the property of the state,\r\nneither these nor those elsewhere, but are possessed by private\r\nindividuals. The gold mines, on the contrary, nearly all belong to the\r\nstate. Both at Castlon and other places there are singular lead mines\r\nworked. They contain a small proportion of silver, but not sufficient to\r\npay for the expense of refining.\" (Hamilton's Translation, Vol. I., p.\r\n222). While Pliny gives considerable information on vein mining and on\r\nalluvial washing, the following obscure passage (XXXIII, 21) appears to\r\nbe the only reference to concentration of ores: \"That which is dug out\r\nis crushed, washed, roasted, and ground to powder. This powder is called\r\n_apitascudes_, while the silver (lead?) which becomes disengaged in the\r\nfurnace is called _sudor_ (sweat). That which is ejected from the\r\nchimney is called _scoria_ as with other metals. In the case of gold\r\nthis _scoria_ is crushed and melted again.\" It is evident enough from\r\nthese quotations that the Ancients by \"washing\" and \"sifting,\" grasped\r\nthe practical effect of differences in specific gravity of the various\r\ncomponents of an ore. Such processes are barely mentioned by other\r\nmediaeval authors, such as Theophilus, Biringuccio, etc., and thus the\r\naccount in this chapter is the first tangible technical description.\r\nLead mining has been in active progress in Derbyshire since the 13th\r\ncentury, and concentration was done on an inclined board until the 16th\r\ncentury, when William Humphrey (see below) introduced the jigging sieve.\r\nSome further notes on this industry will be found in note 1, p. 77.\r\nHowever, the buddle and strake which appear at that time, are but modest\r\nimprovements over the board described by Agatharchides in the quotation\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe ancient crushing appliances, as indicated by the ancient authors and\r\nby the Greek and Roman remains scattered over Europe, were hand-mortars\r\nand mill-stones of the same order as those with which they ground flour.\r\nThe stamp-mill, the next advance over grinding in mill-stones, seems to\r\nhave been invented some time late in the 15th or early in the 16th\r\ncenturies, but who invented it is unknown. Beckmann (Hist. of\r\nInventions, II, p. 335) says: \"In the year 1519 the process of sifting\r\nand wet-stamping was established at Joachimsthal by Paul Grommestetter,\r\na native of Schwarz, named on that account the Schwarzer, whom Melzer\r\npraises as an ingenious and active washer; and we are told that he had\r\nbefore introduced the same improvements at Schneeberg. Soon after, that\r\nis in 1521, a large stamping-work was erected at Joachimsthal, and the\r\nprocess of washing was begun. A considerable saving was thus made, as a\r\ngreat many metallic particles were before left in the washed sand, which\r\nwas either thrown away or used as mortar for building. In the year 1525,\r\nHans Poertner employed at Schlackenwalde the wet method of stamping,\r\nwhereas before that period the ore there was ground. In the Harz this\r\ninvention was introduced at Wildenmann by Peter Philip, who was\r\nassay-master there soon after the works at the Upper Harz were resumed\r\nby Duke Henry the Younger, about the year 1524. This we learn from the\r\npapers of Herdan Hacke or Haecke, who was preacher at Wildenmann in\r\n1572.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the great amount of direct and indirect reference to tin\r\nmining in Cornwall, covering four centuries prior to Agricola, it would\r\nbe natural to expect some statement bearing upon the treatment of ore.\r\nCuriously enough, while alluvial washing and smelting of the black-tin\r\nare often referred to, there is nothing that we have been able to find,\r\nprior to Richard Carew's \"Survey of Cornwall\" (London, 1602, p. 12)\r\nwhich gives any tangible evidence on the technical phases of\r\nore-dressing. In any event, an inspection of charters, tax-rolls,\r\nStannary Court proceedings, etc., prior to that date gives the\r\nimpression that vein mining was a very minor portion of the source of\r\nproduction. Although Carew's work dates 45 years after Agricola, his\r\ndescription is of interest: \"As much almost dooth it exceede credite,\r\nthat the Tynne, for and in so small quantitie digged up with so great\r\ntoyle, and passing afterwards thorow the managing of so many hands, ere\r\nit comes to sale, should be any way able to acquite the cost: for being\r\nonce brought above ground in the stone, it is first broken in peeces\r\nwith hammers; and then carryed, either in waynes, or on horses' backs,\r\nto a stamping mill, where three, and in some places sixe great logges of\r\ntimber, bounde at the ends with yron, and lifted up and downe by a\r\nwheele, driven with the water, doe break it smaller. If the stones be\r\nover-moyst, they are dried by the fire in an yron cradle or grate. From\r\nthe stamping mill, it passeth to the crazing mill, which betweene two\r\ngrinding stones, turned also with a water-wheel, bruseth the same to a\r\nfind sand; howbeit, of late times they mostly use wet stampers, and so\r\nhave no need of the crazing mills for their best stuffe, but only for\r\nthe crust of their tayles. The streame, after it hath forsaken the mill,\r\nis made to fall by certayne degrees, one somewhat distant from another;\r\nupon each of which, at every discent, lyeth a greene turfe, three or\r\nfoure foote square, and one foote thick. On this the Tinner layeth a\r\ncertayne portion of the sandie Tinne, and with his shovel softly tosseth\r\nthe same to and fro, that, through this stirring, the water which\r\nrunneth over it may wash away the light earth from the Tinne, which of a\r\nheavier substance lyeth fast on the turfe. Having so clensed one\r\nportion, he setteth the same aside, and beginneth with another, until\r\nhis labour take end with his taske. The best of those turfes (for all\r\nsorts serve not) are fetched about two miles to the eastwards of S.\r\nMichael's Mount, where at low water they cast aside the sand, and dig\r\nthem up; they are full of rootes of trees, and on some of them nuts have\r\nbeen found, which confirmeth my former assertion of the sea's intrusion.\r\nAfter it is thus washed, they put the remnant into a wooden dish, broad,\r\nflat, and round, being about two foote over, and having two handles\r\nfastened at the sides, by which they softly shogge the same to and fro\r\nin the water betweene their legges, as they sit over it, untill\r\nwhatsoever of the earthie substance that was yet left be flitted away.\r\nSome of later time, with a sleighter invention, and lighter labour, doe\r\ncause certayne boyes to stir it up and down with their feete, which\r\nworketh the same effect; the residue, after this often clensing, they\r\ncall Blacke Tynne.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the \"wet stampers\" and the buddle--worked with\r\n\"boyes feete\"--are \"innovations of late times.\" And the interesting\r\nquestion arises as to whether Cornwall did not derive the stamp-mill,\r\nbuddle, and strake, from the Germans. The first adequate detailed\r\ndescription of Cornish appliances is that of Pryce (_Mineralogia\r\nCornubiensis_, London, 1778) where the apparatus is identical with that\r\ndescribed by Agricola 130 years before. The word \"stamper\" of Cornwall\r\nis of German origin, from _stampfer_, or, as it is often written in old\r\nGerman works, _stamper_. However, the pursuit of the subject through\r\netymology ends here, for no derivatives in German can be found for\r\nbuddle, tye, strake, or other collateral terms. The first tangible\r\nevidence of German influence is to be found in Carew who, continuing\r\nafter the above quotation, states: \"But sithence I gathered stickes to\r\nthe building of this poore nest, Sir Francis Godolphin (whose kind helpe\r\nhath much advanced this my playing labour) entertained a Dutch Mynerall\r\nman, and taking light from his experience, but building thereon farre\r\nmore profitable conclusions of his owne invention, hath practised a more\r\nsaving way in these matters, and besides, made Tynne with good profit of\r\nthat refuse which Tynners rejected as nothing worth.\" Beyond this\r\nquotation we can find no direct evidence of the influence of \"Dutch\r\nMynerall men\" in Cornish tin mining at this time. There can be no doubt,\r\nhowever, that in copper mining in Cornwall and elsewhere in England, the\r\n\"Dutch Mynerall men\" did play a large part in the latter part of the\r\n16th Century. Pettus (_Fodinae Regales_, London, 1670, p. 20) states that\r\n\"about the third year of Queen Elizabeth (1561) she by the advice of her\r\nCouncil sent over for some Germans experienced in mines, and being\r\nsupplied, she, on the tenth of October, in the sixth of her reign,\r\ngranted the mines of eight counties ... to Houghsetter, a German whose\r\nname and family still continue in Cardiganshire.\" Elizabeth granted\r\nlarge mining rights to various Germans, and the opening paragraphs of\r\ntwo out of several Charters may be quoted in point. This grant is dated\r\n1565, and in part reads: \"ELIZABETH, by the Grace of God, Queen of\r\nEngland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. To all Men to\r\nwhom these Letters Patents shall come, Greeting. Where heretofore we\r\nhave granted Privileges to Cornelius de Voz, for the Mining and Digging\r\nin our Realm of England, for Allom and Copperas, and for divers Ewers of\r\nMetals that were to be found in digging for the said Allom and Copperas,\r\nincidently and consequently without fraud or guile, as by the same our\r\nPrivilege may appear.

To all Men to whom these our Letters Patents\r\nshall come, Greeting. Where we have received credible Information that\r\nour faithful and well-beloved Subject William Humfrey, Saymaster of our\r\nMint within our Tower of London, by his great Endeavour, Labour, and\r\nCharge, hath brought into this our Realm of England one Christopher\r\nShutz, an Almain, born at _St. Annen Berg_, under the Obedience of the\r\nElecter of Saxony; a Workman as it is reported, of great Cunning,\r\nKnowledge, and Experience, as well in the finding of the Calamin Stone,\r\ncall'd in Latin, _lapis calaminaris_, and in the right and proper use\r\nand commodity thereof, for the Composition of the mix'd Metal commonly\r\ncall'd _latten_, etc.\" Col. Grant-Francis, in his most valuable\r\ncollection (Smelting of Copper in the Swansea District, London, 1881)\r\nhas published a collection of correspondence relating to early mining\r\nand smelting operations in Great Britain. And among them (p. 1., etc.)\r\nare letters in the years 1583-6 from William Carnsewe and others to\r\nThomas Smyth, with regard to the first smelter erected at Neath, which\r\nwas based upon copper mines in Cornwall. He mentions \"Mr. Weston's (a\r\npartner) provydence in bringynge hys Dutch myners hether to aplye such\r\nbusinys in this countrye ys more to be commendyd than his ignorance of\r\nour countrymen's actyvytyes in suche matters.\" The principal \"Dutche\r\nMineral Master\" referred to was one Ulrick Frosse, who had charge of the\r\nmine at Perin Sands in Cornwall, and subsequently of the smelter at\r\nNeath. Further on is given (p. 25) a Report by Jochim Gaunse upon the\r\nSmelting of copper ores at Keswick in Cumberland in 1581, referred to in\r\nnote 2, p. 267. The Daniel Hochstetter mentioned in the Charter above,\r\ntogether with other German and English gentlemen, formed the \"Company of\r\nMines Royal\" and among the properties worked were those with which\r\nGaunse's report is concerned. There is in the Record Office, London\r\n(Exchequer K.R. Com. Derby 611. Eliz.) the record of an interesting\r\ninquisition into Derbyshire methods in which a then recent great\r\nimprovement was the jigging sieve, the introduction of which was due to\r\nWilliam Humphrey (mentioned above). It is possible that he learned of it\r\nfrom the German with whom he was associated. Much more evidence of the\r\nactivity of the Germans in English mining at this period can be adduced.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Cornwall has laid claims to having taught the art of\r\ntin mining and metallurgy to the Germans. Matthew Paris, a Benedictine\r\nmonk, by birth an Englishman, who died in 1259, relates (_Historia Major\r\nAngliae_, London, 1571) that a Cornishman who fled to Germany on account\r\nof a murder, first discovered tin there in 1241, and that in consequence\r\nthe price of tin fell greatly. This statement is recalled with great\r\npersistence by many writers on Cornwall. (Camden, _Britannia_, London,\r\n1586; Borlase, Natural History of Cornwall, Oxford, 1758; Pryce,\r\n_Mineralogia Cornubiensis_, London, 1778, p. 70, and others).\r\n\r\n[11] _Lapidibus liquescentibus_. (See note 15, p. 380).\r\n\r\n[12] HISTORICAL NOTE ON AMALGAMATION. The recovery of gold by the use of\r\nmercury possibly dates from Roman times, but the application of the\r\nprocess to silver does not seem to go back prior to the 16th Century.\r\nQuicksilver was well-known to the Greeks, and is described by\r\nTheophrastus (105) and others (see note 58, p. 432, on quicksilver).\r\nHowever, the Greeks made no mention of its use for amalgamation, and, in\r\nfact, Dioscorides (V, 70) says \"it is kept in vessels of glass, lead,\r\ntin or silver; if kept in vessels of any other kind it consumes them and\r\nflows away.\" It was used by them for medicinal purposes. The Romans\r\namalgamated gold with mercury, but whether they took advantage of the\r\nprinciple to recover gold from ores we do not know. Vitruvius (VII, 8)\r\nmakes the following statement:--\"If quicksilver be placed in a vessel\r\nand a stone of a hundred pounds' weight be placed on it, it will swim at\r\nthe top, and will, notwithstanding its weight, be incapable of pressing\r\nthe liquid so as to break or separate it. If this be taken out, and only\r\na single scruple of gold be put in, that will not swim, but immediately\r\ndescend to the bottom. This is a proof that the gravity of a body does\r\nnot depend on its weight, but on its nature. Quicksilver is used for\r\nmany purposes; without it, neither silver nor brass can be properly\r\ngilt. When gold is embroidered on a garment which is worn out and no\r\nlonger fit for use, the cloth is burnt over the fire in earthen pots;\r\nthe ashes are thrown into water and quicksilver added to them; this\r\ncollects all the particles of gold and unites with them. The water is\r\nthen poured off and the residuum placed in a cloth, which, when squeezed\r\nwith the hands, suffers the liquid quicksilver to pass through the pores\r\nof the cloth, but retains the gold in a mass within it.\" (Gwilt's\r\nTrans., p. 217). Pliny is rather more explicit (XXXIII, 32): \"All floats\r\non it (quicksilver) except gold. This it draws into itself, and on that\r\naccount is the best means of purifying; for, on being repeatedly\r\nagitated in earthen pots it casts out the other things and the\r\nimpurities. These things being rejected, in order that it may give up\r\nthe gold, it is squeezed in prepared skins, through which, exuding like\r\nperspiration, it leaves the gold pure.\" It may be noted particularly\r\nthat both these authors state that gold is the only substance that does\r\nnot float, and, moreover, nowhere do we find any reference to silver\r\ncombining with mercury, although Beckmann (Hist. of Inventions, Vol. I,\r\np. 14) not only states that the above passage from Pliny refers to\r\nsilver, but in further error, attributes the origin of silver\r\namalgamation of ores to the Spaniards in the Indies.\r\n\r\nThe Alchemists of the Middle Ages were well aware that silver would\r\namalgamate with mercury. There is, however, difficulty in any conclusion\r\nthat it was applied by them to separating silver or gold from ore. The\r\ninvolved gibberish in which most of their utterances was couched,\r\nobscures most of their reactions in any event. The School of Geber\r\n(Appendix B) held that all metals were a compound of \"spiritual\" mercury\r\nand sulphur, and they clearly amalgamated silver with mercury, and\r\nseparated them by distillation. The _Probierbuechlein_ (1520?) describes\r\na method of recovering silver from the cement used in parting gold and\r\nsilver, by mixing the cement (silver chlorides) with quicksilver.\r\nAgricola nowhere in this work mentions the treatment of silver ores by\r\namalgamation, although he was familiar with Biringuccio (_De La\r\nPirotechnia_), as he himself mentions in the Preface. This work,\r\npublished at least ten years before _De Re Metallica_, contains the\r\nfirst comprehensive account of silver amalgamation. There is more than\r\nusual interest in the description, because, not only did it precede _De\r\nRe Metallica_, but it is also a specific explanation of the fundamental\r\nessentials of the Patio Process long before the date when the Spaniards\r\ncould possibly have invented that process in Mexico. We quote Mr. A.\r\nDick's translation from Percy (Metallurgy of Silver and Gold, p. 560):\r\n\r\n\"He was certainly endowed with much useful and ingenious thought who\r\ninvented the short method of extracting metal from the sweepings\r\nproduced by those arts which have to do with gold and silver, every\r\nsubstance left in the refuse by smelters, and also the substance from\r\ncertain ores themselves, without the labour of fusing, but by the sole\r\nmeans and virtue of mercury. To effect this, a large basin is first\r\nconstructed of stone or timber and walled, into which is fitted a\r\nmillstone made to turn like that of a mill. Into the hollow of this\r\nbasin is placed matter containing gold (_della materia vra che tiene\r\noro_), well ground in a mortar and afterward washed and dried; and, with\r\nthe above-mentioned millstone, it is ground while being moistened with\r\nvinegar, or water, in which has been dissolved corrosive sublimate\r\n(_solimato_), verdigris (_verde rame_), and common salt. Over these\r\nmaterials is then put as much mercury as will cover them; they are then\r\nstirred for an hour or two, by turning the millstone, either by hand, or\r\nhorse-power, according to the plan adopted, bearing in mind that the\r\nmore the mercury and the materials are bruised together by the\r\nmillstone, the more the mercury may be trusted to have taken up the\r\nsubstance which the materials contain. The mercury, in this condition,\r\ncan then be separated from the earthy matter by a sieve, or by washing,\r\nand thus you will recover the auriferous mercury (_el vro mercurio_).\r\nAfter this, by driving off the mercury by means of a flask (_i.e._, by\r\nheating in a retort or an alembic), or by passing it through a bag,\r\nthere will remain, at the bottom, the gold, silver, or copper, or\r\nwhatever metal was placed in the basin under the millstone to be ground.\r\nHaving been desirous of knowing this secret, I gave to him who taught it\r\nto me a ring with a diamond worth 25 ducats; he also required me to give\r\nhim the eighth part of any profit I might make by using it. This I\r\nwished to tell you, not that you should return the ducats to me for\r\nteaching you the secret, but in order that you should esteem it all the\r\nmore and hold it dear.\"\r\n\r\nIn another part of the treatise Biringuccio states that washed\r\n(concentrated) ores may be ultimately reduced either by lead or mercury.\r\nConcerning these silver concentrates he writes: \"Afterward drenching\r\nthem with vinegar in which has been put green copper (_i.e._,\r\nverdigris); or drenching them with water in which has been dissolved\r\nvitriol and green copper....\" He next describes how this material should\r\nbe ground with mercury. The question as to who was the inventor of\r\nsilver amalgamation will probably never be cleared up. According to\r\nUlloa (_Relacion Historica Del Viage a la America Meridional_, Madrid,\r\n1748) Dom Pedro Fernandes De Velasco discovered the process in Mexico in\r\n1566. The earliest technical account is that of Father Joseph De Acosta\r\n(_Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias_, Seville, 1590, English trans.\r\nEdward Grimston, London, 1604, re-published by the Hakluyt Society,\r\n1880). Acosta was born in 1540, and spent the years 1570 to 1585 in\r\nPeru, and 1586 in Mexico. It may be noted that Potosi was discovered in\r\n1545. He states that refining silver with mercury was introduced at\r\nPotosi by Pedro Fernandes de Velasco from Mexico in 1571, and states\r\n(Grimston's Trans., Vol. I, p. 219): \"... They put the powder of the\r\nmetall into the vessels upon furnaces, whereas they anoint it and\r\nmortifie it with brine, putting to every fiftie quintalles of powder\r\nfive quintalles of salt. And this they do for that the salt separates\r\nthe earth and filth, to the end the quicksilver may the more easily draw\r\nthe silver unto it. After, they put quicksilver into a piece of holland\r\nand presse it out upon the metall, which goes forth like a dewe, alwaies\r\nturning and stirring the metall, to the end it may be well incorporate.\r\nBefore the invention of these furnaces of fire, they did often mingle\r\ntheir metall with quicksilver in great troughes, letting it settle some\r\ndaies, and did then mix it and stirre it againe, until they thought all\r\nthe quicksilver were well incorporate with the silver, the which\r\ncontinued twentie daies and more, and at least nine daies.\" Frequent\r\nmention of the different methods of silver amalgamation is made by the\r\nSpanish writers subsequent to this time, the best account being that of\r\nAlonso Barba, a priest. Barba was a native of Lepe, in Andalusia, and\r\nfollowed his calling at various places in Peru from about 1600 to about\r\n1630, and at one time held the Curacy of St. Bernard at Potosi. In 1640\r\nhe published at Madrid his _Arte de los Metales_, etc., in five books.\r\nThe first two books of this work were translated into English by the\r\nEarl of Sandwich, and published in London in 1674, under the title \"The\r\nFirst Book of the Art of Metals.\" This translation is equally wretched\r\nwith those in French and German, as might be expected from the\r\ntranslators' total lack of technical understanding. Among the methods of\r\nsilver amalgamation described by Barba is one which, upon later\r\n\"discovery\" at Virginia City, is now known as the \"Washoe Process.\" None\r\nof the Spanish writers, so far as we know, make reference to\r\nBiringuccio's account, and the question arises whether the Patio Process\r\nwas an importation from Europe or whether it was re-invented in Mexico.\r\nWhile there is no direct evidence on the point, the presumption is in\r\nfavour of the former.\r\n\r\nThe general introduction of the amalgamation of silver ores into Central\r\nEurope seems to have been very slow, and over 200 years elapsed after\r\nits adoption in Peru and Mexico before it received serious attention by\r\nthe German Metallurgists. Ignaz Elder v. Born was the first to establish\r\nthe process effectually in Europe, he having in 1784 erected a\r\n\"quick-mill\" at Glasshutte, near Shemnitz. He published an elaborate\r\naccount of a process which he claimed as his own, under the title _Ueber\r\ndas Anquicken der Gold und Silberhaeltigen Erze_, Vienna, 1786. The only\r\nthing new in his process seems to have been mechanical agitation.\r\nAccording to Born, a Spaniard named Don Juan de Corduba, in the year\r\n1588, applied to the Court at Vienna offering to extract silver from\r\nores with mercury. Various tests were carried out under the celebrated\r\nLazarus Erckern, and although it appears that some vitriol and salt were\r\nused, the trials apparently failed, for Erckern concluded his report\r\nwith the advice: \"That their Lordships should not suffer any more\r\nexpense to be thrown away upon this experiment.\" Born's work was\r\ntranslated into English by R. E. Raspe, under the title--\"Baron Inigo\r\nBorn's New Process of Amalgamation, etc.,\" London, 1791. Some interest\r\nattaches to Raspe, in that he was not only the author of \"Baron\r\nMunchausen,\" but was also the villain in Scott's \"Antiquary.\" Raspe was\r\na German Professor at Cassel, who fled to England to avoid arrest for\r\ntheft. He worked at various mines in Cornwall, and in 1791 involved Sir\r\nJohn Sinclair in a fruitless mine, but disappeared before that was\r\nknown. The incident was finally used by Sir Walter Scott in this novel.\r\n\r\n[13] _Aurum in ea remanet purum_. This same error of assuming squeezed\r\namalgam to be pure gold occurs in Pliny; see previous footnote.\r\n\r\n[14] George, Duke of Saxony, surnamed \"The Bearded,\" was born 1471, and\r\ndied 1539. He was chiefly known for his bitter opposition to the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\n[15] The Julian Alps are a section east of the Carnic Alps and lie north\r\nof Trieste. The term Rhaetian Alps is applied to that section along the\r\nSwiss Italian Boundary, about north of Lake Como.\r\n\r\n[16] Ancient Lusitania comprised Portugal and some neighbouring portions\r\nof Spain.\r\n\r\n[17] Colchis, the traditional land of the Golden Fleece, lay between the\r\nCaucasus on the north, Armenia on the south, and the Black Sea on the\r\nwest. If Agricola's account of the metallurgical purpose of the fleece\r\nis correct, then Jason must have had real cause for complaint as to the\r\ntangible results of his expedition. The fact that we hear nothing of the\r\nfleece after the day it was taken from the dragon would thus support\r\nAgricola's theory. Tons of ink have been expended during the past thirty\r\ncenturies in explanations of what the fleece really was. These\r\nexplanations range through the supernatural and metallurgical, but more\r\nrecent writers have endeavoured to construct the journey of the\r\nArgonauts into an epic of the development of the Greek trade in gold\r\nwith the Euxine. We will not attempt to traverse them from a\r\nmetallurgical point of view further than to maintain that Agricola's\r\nexplanation is as probable and equally as ingenious as any other,\r\nalthough Strabo (XI, 2, 19.) gives much the same view long before.\r\n\r\nAlluvial mining--gold washing--being as old as the first glimmer of\r\ncivilization, it is referred to, directly or indirectly, by a great\r\nmajority of ancient writers, poets, historians, geographers, and\r\nnaturalists. Early Egyptian inscriptions often refer to this industry,\r\nbut from the point of view of technical methods the description by Pliny\r\nis practically the only one of interest, and in Pliny's chapter on the\r\nsubject, alluvial is badly confused with vein mining. This passage\r\n(XXXIII, 21) is as follows: \"Gold is found in the world in three ways,\r\nto say nothing of that found in India by the ants, and in Scythia by the\r\nGriffins. The first is as gold dust found in streams, as, for instance,\r\nin the Tagus in Spain, in the Padus in Italy, in the Hebrus in Thracia,\r\nin the Pactolus in Asia, and in the Ganges in India; indeed, there is no\r\ngold found more perfect than this, as the current polishes it thoroughly\r\nby attrition.... Others by equal labour and greater expense bring rivers\r\nfrom the mountain heights, often a hundred miles, for the purpose of\r\nwashing this debris. The ditches thus made are called _corrugi_, from\r\nour word _corrivatio_, I suppose; and these entail a thousand fresh\r\nlabours. The fall must be steep, that the water may rush down from very\r\nhigh places, rather than flow gently. The ditches across the valleys are\r\njoined by aqueducts, and in other places, impassable rocks have to be\r\ncut away and forced to make room for troughs of hollowed-out logs. Those\r\nwho cut the rocks are suspended by ropes, so that to those who watch\r\nthem from a distance, the workmen seem not so much beasts as birds.\r\nHanging thus, they take the levels and trace the lines which the ditch\r\nis to take; and thus, where there is no place for man's footstep,\r\nstreams are dragged by men. The water is vitiated for washing if the\r\ncurrent of the stream carries mud with it. This kind of earth is called\r\n_urium_, hence these ditches are laid out to carry the water over beds\r\nof pebbles to avoid this _urium_. When they have reached the head of the\r\nfall, at the top of the mountain, reservoirs are excavated a couple of\r\nhundred feet long and wide, and about ten feet deep. In these reservoirs\r\nthere are generally five gates left, about three feet square, so that\r\nwhen the reservoir is full, the gates are opened, and the torrent bursts\r\nforth with such violence that the rocks are hurled along. When they have\r\nreached the plain there is yet more labour. Trenches called _agogae_ are\r\ndug for the flow of the water. The bottoms of these are spread at\r\nregular intervals with _ulex_ to catch the gold. This _ulex_ is similar\r\nto rosemary, rough and prickly. The sides, too, are closed in with\r\nplanks and are suspended when crossing precipitous spots. The earth is\r\ncarried to the sea and thus the shattered mountain is washed away and\r\nscattered; and this deposition of the earth in the sea has extended the\r\nshore of Spain.... The gold procured from _arrugiae_ does not require to\r\nbe melted, but is already pure gold. It is found in lumps, in shafts as\r\nwell, sometimes even exceeding ten _librae_ in weight. These lumps are\r\ncalled _palagae_ and _palacurnae_, while the small grains are called\r\n_baluce_. The Ulex is dried and burnt and the ashes are washed on a bed\r\nof grassy turf in order that the gold may settle thereon.\"\r\n\r\n[19] _Carbunculus Carchedonius_--Carthaginian carbuncle. The German is\r\ngiven by Agricola in the _Interpretatio_ as _granat_, _i.e._, garnet.\r\n\r\n[20] As the concentration of crushed tin ore has been exhaustively\r\ntreated of already, the descriptions from here on probably refer\r\nentirely to alluvial tin.\r\n\r\n[21] From a metallurgical point of view all of these operations are\r\nroasting. Even to-day, however, the expression \"burning\" tin is in use\r\nin some parts of Cornwall, and in former times it was general.\r\n\r\n[22] There can be no doubt that these are mattes, as will develop in\r\nBook IX. The German term in the Glossary for _panes ex pyrite_ is\r\n_stein_, the same as the modern German for matte. Orpiment and realgar\r\nare the yellow and red arsenical sulphides. The _cadmia_ was no doubt\r\nthe cobalt-arsenic minerals (see note on p. 112). The \"solidified\r\njuices\" were generally anything that could be expelled short of\r\nsmelting, _i.e._, roasted off or leached out, as shown in note 4, p. 1;\r\nthey embrace the sulphates, salts, sulphur, bitumen, and arsenical\r\nsulphides, etc. For further information on leaching out the sulphates,\r\nalum, etc., see note 10, p. 564.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I have written of the varied work of preparing the ores, I will\r\nnow write of the various methods of smelting them. Although those who\r\nburn, roast and calcine[2] the ore, take from it something which is\r\nmixed or combined with the metals; and those who crush it with stamps\r\ntake away much; and those who wash, screen and sort it, take away still\r\nmore; yet they cannot remove all which conceals the metal from the eye\r\nand renders it crude and unformed. Wherefore smelting is necessary, for\r\nby this means earths, solidified juices, and stones are separated from\r\nthe metals so that they obtain their proper colour and become pure, and\r\nmay be of great use to mankind in many ways. When the ore is smelted,\r\nthose things which were mixed with the metal before it was melted are\r\ndriven forth, because the metal is perfected by fire in this manner.\r\nSince metalliferous ores differ greatly amongst themselves, first as to\r\nthe metals which they contain, then as to the quantity of the metal\r\nwhich is in them, and then by the fact that some are rapidly melted by\r\nfire and others slowly, there are, therefore, many methods of smelting.\r\nConstant practice has taught the smelters by which of these methods\r\nthey can obtain the most metal from any one ore. Moreover, while\r\nsometimes there are many methods of smelting the same ore, by which an\r\nequal weight of metal is melted out, yet one is done at a greater cost\r\nand labour than the others. Ore is either melted with a furnace or\r\nwithout one; if smelted with a furnace the tap-hole is either\r\ntemporarily closed or always open, and if smelted without a furnace, it\r\nis done either in pots or in trenches. But in order to make this matter\r\nclearer, I will describe each in detail, beginning with the buildings\r\nand the furnaces.\r\n\r\nA wall which will be called the \"second wall\" is constructed of brick\r\nor stone, two feet and as many palms thick, in order that it may be\r\nstrong enough to bear the weight. It is built fifteen feet high, and its\r\nlength depends on the number of furnaces which are put in the works;\r\nthere are usually six furnaces, rarely more, and often less. There are\r\nthree furnace walls, a back one which is against the \"second\" wall, and\r\ntwo side ones, of which I will speak later. These should be made of\r\nnatural stone, as this is more serviceable than burnt bricks, because\r\nbricks soon become defective and crumble away, when the smelter or his\r\ndeputy chips off the accretions which adhere to the walls when the ore\r\nis smelted. Natural stone resists injury by the fire and lasts a long\r\ntime, especially that which is soft and devoid of cracks; but, on the\r\ncontrary, that which is hard and has many cracks is burst asunder by the\r\nfire and destroyed. For this reason, furnaces which are made of the\r\nlatter are easily weakened by the fire, and when the accretions are\r\nchipped off they crumble to pieces. The front furnace wall should be\r\nmade of brick, and there should be in the lower part a mouth three palms\r\nwide and one and a half feet high, when the hearth is completed. A hole\r\nslanting upward, three palms long, is made through the back furnace\r\nwall, at the height of a cubit, before the hearth has been prepared;\r\nthrough this hole and a hole one foot long in the \"second\" wall--as the\r\nback of this wall has an arch--is inserted a pipe of iron or bronze, in\r\nwhich are fixed the nozzles of the bellows. The whole of the front\r\nfurnace wall is not more than five feet high, so that the ore may be\r\nconveniently put into the furnace, together with those things which the\r\nmaster needs for his work of smelting. Both the side walls of the\r\nfurnace are six feet high, and the back one seven feet, and they are\r\nthree palms thick. The interior of the furnace is five palms wide, six\r\npalms and a digit long, the width being measured by the space which lies\r\nbetween the two side walls, and the length by the space between the\r\nfront and the back walls; however, the upper part of the furnace widens\r\nout somewhat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 357 (Blast Furnaces): A--Furnaces. B--Forehearths.]\r\n\r\nThere are two doors in the second wall if there are six furnaces, one of\r\nthe doors being between the second and third furnaces and the other\r\nbetween the fourth and fifth furnaces. They are a cubit wide and six\r\nfeet high, in order that the smelters may not have mishaps in coming and\r\ngoing. It is necessary to have a door to the right of the first furnace,\r\nand similarly one to the left of the last, whether the wall is longer or\r\nnot. The second wall is carried further when the rooms for the\r\ncupellation furnaces, or any other building, adjoin the rooms for the\r\nblast furnaces, these buildings being only divided by a partition. The\r\nsmelter, and the ones who attend to the first and the last furnaces, if\r\nthey wish to look at the bellows or to do anything else, go out through\r\nthe doors at the end of the wall, and the other people go through the\r\nother doors, which are the common ones. The furnaces are placed at a\r\ndistance of six feet from one another, in order that the smelters and\r\ntheir assistants may more easily sustain the fierceness of the heat.\r\nInasmuch as the interior of each furnace is five palms wide and each is\r\nsix feet distant from the other, and inasmuch as there is a space of\r\nfour feet three palms at the right side of the first furnace and as much\r\nat the left side of the last furnace, and there are to be six furnaces\r\nin one building, then it is necessary to make the second wall fifty-two\r\nfeet long; because the total of the widths of all of the furnaces is\r\nseven and a half feet, the total of the spaces between the furnaces is\r\nthirty feet, the space on the outer sides of the first and last furnaces\r\nis nine feet and two palms, and the thickness of the two transverse\r\nwalls is five feet, which make a total measurement of fifty-two feet.[3]\r\n\r\nOutside each furnace hearth there is a small pit full of powder which is\r\ncompressed by ramming, and in this manner is made the forehearth which\r\nreceives the metal flowing from the furnaces. Of this I will speak\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 358 (Blast Furnaces): A--Furnaces. B--Forehearth. C--Door.\r\nD--Water tank. E--Stone which covers it. F--Material of the vent walls.\r\nG--Stone which covers it. H--Pipe exhaling the vapour.]\r\n\r\nBuried about a cubit under the forehearth and the hearth of the furnace\r\nis a transverse water-tank, three feet long, three palms wide and a\r\ncubit deep. It is made of stone or brick, with a stone cover, for if it\r\nwere not covered, the heat would draw the moisture from below and the\r\nvapour might be blown into the hearth of the furnace as well as into the\r\nforehearth, and would dampen the blast. The moisture would vitiate the\r\nblast, and part of the metal would be absorbed and part would be mixed\r\nwith the slags, and in this manner the melting would be greatly damaged.\r\nFrom each water-tank is built a walled vent, to the same depth as the\r\ntank, but six digits wide; this vent slopes upward, and sooner or\r\nlater penetrates through to the other side of the wall, against which\r\nthe furnace is built. At the end of this vent there is an opening where\r\nthe steam, into which the water has been converted, is exhausted through\r\na copper or iron tube or pipe. This method of making the tank and the\r\nvent is much the best. Another kind has a similar vent but a different\r\ntank, for it does not lie transversely under the forehearth, but\r\nlengthwise; it is two feet and a palm long, and a foot and three palms\r\nwide, and a foot and a palm deep. This method of making tanks is not\r\ncondemned by us, as is the construction of those tanks without a vent;\r\nthe latter, which have no opening into the air through which the vapour\r\nmay discharge freely, are indeed to be condemned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 359 (Bellows for blast furnaces)]\r\n\r\nFifteen feet behind the second wall is constructed the first wall,\r\nthirteen feet high. In both of these are fixed roof beams[4], which are\r\na foot wide and thick, and nineteen feet and a palm long; these are\r\nplaced three feet distant from one another. As the second wall is two\r\nfeet higher than the first wall, recesses are cut in the back of it two\r\nfeet high, one foot wide, and a palm deep, and in these recesses, as it\r\nwere in mortises, are placed one end of each of the beams. Into these\r\nends are mortised the bottoms of just as many posts; these posts are\r\ntwenty-four feet high, three palms wide and thick, and from the tops of\r\nthe posts the same number of rafters stretch downward to the ends of the\r\nbeams superimposed on the first wall; the upper ends of the rafters are\r\nmortised into the posts and the lower ends are mortised into the ends of\r\nthe beams laid on the first wall; the rafters support the roof, which\r\nconsists of burnt tiles. Each separate rafter is propped up by a\r\nseparate timber, which is a cross-beam, and is joined to its post.\r\nPlanks close together are affixed to the posts above the furnaces; these\r\nplanks are about two digits thick and a palm wide, and they, together\r\nwith the wicker work interposed between the timbers, are covered with\r\nlute so that there may be no risk of fire to the timbers and\r\nwicker-work. In this practical manner is constructed the back part of\r\nthe works, which contains the bellows, their frames, the mechanism for\r\ncompressing the bellows, and the instrument for distending them, of all\r\nof which I will speak hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 361 (Plan of Smelter Building): The four long walls:\r\nA--First. B--Second. C--Third. D--Fourth. The seven transverse walls:\r\nE--First. F--Second. G--Third. H--Fourth. I--Fifth. K--Sixth.\r\nL--Seventh, or middle.]\r\n\r\nIn front of the furnaces is constructed the third long wall and likewise\r\nthe fourth. Both are nine feet high, but of the same length and\r\nthickness as the other two, the fourth being nine feet distant from the\r\nthird; the third is twenty-one and a half feet from the second. At a\r\ndistance of twelve feet from the second wall, four posts seven and a\r\nhalf feet high, a cubit wide and thick, are set upon rock laid\r\nunderneath. Into the tops of the posts the roof beam is mortised; this\r\nroof beam is two feet and as many palms longer than the distance between\r\nthe second and the fifth transverse walls, in order that its ends may\r\nrest on the transverse walls. If there should not be so long a beam at\r\nhand, two are substituted for it. As the length of the long beam is as\r\nabove, and as the posts are equidistant, it is necessary that the posts\r\nshould be a distance of nine feet, one palm, two and two-fifths digits\r\nfrom each other, and the end ones this distance from the transverse\r\nwalls. On this longitudinal beam and to the third and fourth walls are\r\nfixed twelve secondary beams twenty-four feet long, one foot wide, three\r\npalms thick, and distant from each other three feet, one palm, and two\r\ndigits. In these secondary beams, where they rest on the longitudinal\r\nbeams, are mortised the ends of the same number of rafters as there are\r\nposts which stand on the second wall. The ends of the rafters do not\r\nreach to the tops of the posts, but are two feet away from them, that\r\nthrough this opening, which is like the open part of a forge, the\r\nfurnaces can emit their fumes. In order that the rafters should not fall\r\ndown, they are supported partly by iron rods, which extend from each\r\nrafter to the opposite post, and partly supported by a few tie-beams,\r\nwhich in the same manner extend from some rafters to the posts opposite,\r\nand give them stability. To these tie-beams, as well as to the rafters\r\nwhich face the posts, a number of boards, about two digits thick and a\r\npalm wide, are fixed at a distance of a palm from each other, and are\r\ncovered with lute so that they do not catch fire. In the secondary\r\nbeams, where they are laid on the fourth wall, are mortised the lower\r\nends of the same number of rafters as those in a set of rafters[5]\r\nopposite them. From the third long wall these rafters are joined and\r\ntied to the ends of the opposite rafters, so that they may not slip, and\r\nbesides they are strengthened with substructures which are made of cross\r\nand oblique timbers. The rafters support the roof.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the front part of the building is made, and is divided\r\ninto three parts; the first part is twelve feet wide and is under the\r\nhood, which consists of two walls, one vertical and one inclined. The\r\nsecond part is the same number of feet wide and is for the reception of\r\nthe ore to be smelted, the fluxes, the charcoal, and other things which\r\nare needed by the smelter. The third part is nine feet wide and contains\r\ntwo separate rooms of equal size, in one of which is the assay furnace,\r\nwhile the other contains the metal to be melted in the cupellation\r\nfurnaces. It is thus necessary that in the building there should be,\r\nbesides the four long walls, seven transverse walls, of which the first\r\nis constructed from the upper end of the first long wall to the upper\r\nend of the second long wall; the second proceeds from the end of this to\r\nthe end of the third long wall; the third likewise from this end of the\r\nlast extends to the end of the fourth long wall; the fourth leads from\r\nthe lower end of the first long wall to the lower end of the second long\r\nwall; the fifth extends from the end of this to the end of the third\r\nlong wall; the sixth extends from this last end to the end of the fourth\r\nlong wall; the seventh divides into two parts the space between the\r\nthird and fourth long walls.\r\n\r\nTo return to the back part of the building, in which, as I said, are the\r\nbellows[6], their frames, the machinery for compressing them, and the\r\ninstrument for distending them. Each bellows consists of a body and a\r\nhead. The body is composed of two \"boards,\" two bows, and two hides. The\r\nupper board is a palm thick, five feet and three palms long, and two and\r\na half feet wide at the back part, where each of the sides is a little\r\ncurved, and it is a cubit wide at the front part near the head. The\r\nwhole of the body of the bellows tapers toward the head. That which we\r\nnow call the \"board\" consists of two pieces of pine, joined and glued\r\ntogether, and of two strips of linden wood which bind the edges of the\r\nboard, these being seven digits wide at the back, and in front near the\r\nhead of the bellows one and a half digits wide. These strips are glued\r\nto the boards, so that there shall be less damage from the iron nails\r\ndriven through the hide. There are some people who do not surround the\r\nboards with strips, but use boards only, which are very thick. The upper\r\nboard has an aperture and a handle; the aperture is in the middle of the\r\nboard and is one foot three palms distant from where the board joins the\r\nhead of the bellows, and is six digits long and four wide. The lid for\r\nthis aperture is two palms and a digit long and wide, and three digits\r\nthick; toward the back of the lid is a little notch cut into the surface\r\nso that it may be caught by the hand; a groove is cut out of the top of\r\nthe front and sides, so that it may engage in mouldings a palm wide and\r\nthree digits thick, which are also cut out in a similar manner under the\r\nedges. Now, when the lid is drawn forward the hole is closed, and when\r\ndrawn back it is opened; the smelter opens the aperture a little so that\r\nthe air may escape from the bellows through it, if he fears the hides\r\nmight be burst when the bellows are too vigorously and quickly inflated;\r\nhe, however, closes the aperture if the hides are ruptured and the air\r\nescapes. Others perforate the upper board with two or three round holes\r\nin the same place as the rectangular one, and they insert plugs in them\r\nwhich they draw out when it is necessary. The wooden handle is seven\r\npalms long, or even longer, in order that it may extend outside;\r\none-half of this handle, two palms wide and one thick, is glued to the\r\nend of the board and fastened with pegs covered with glue; the other\r\nhalf projects beyond the board, and is rounded and seven digits thick.\r\nBesides this, to the handle and to the board is fixed a cleat two feet\r\nlong, as many palms wide and one palm thick, and to the under side of\r\nthe same board, at a distance of three palms from the end, is fixed\r\nanother cleat two feet long, in order that the board may sustain the\r\nforce of distension and compression; these two cleats are glued to the\r\nboard, and are fastened to it with pegs covered with glue.\r\n\r\nThe lower bellows-board, like the upper, is made of two pieces of pine\r\nand of two strips of linden wood, all glued together; it is of the same\r\nwidth and thickness as the upper board, but is a cubit longer, this\r\nextension being part of the head of which I have more to say a little\r\nlater. This lower bellows-board has an air-hole and an iron ring. The\r\nair-hole is about a cubit distant from the posterior end, and it is\r\nmidway between the sides of the bellows-board, and is a foot long and\r\nthree palms wide; it is divided into equal parts by a small rib which\r\nforms part of the board, and is not cut from it; this rib is a palm long\r\nand one-third of a digit wide. The flap of the air-hole is a foot and\r\nthree digits long, three palms and as many digits wide; it is a thin\r\nboard covered with goat skin, the hairy part of which is turned toward\r\nthe ground. There is fixed to one end of the flap, with small iron\r\nnails, one-half of a doubled piece of leather a palm wide and as long as\r\nthe flap is wide; the other half of the leather, which is behind the\r\nflap, is twice perforated, as is also the bellows-board, and these\r\nperforations are seven digits apart. Passing through these a string is\r\ntied on the under side of the board; and thus the flap when tied to the\r\nboard does not fall away. In this manner are made the flap and the\r\nair-hole, so when the bellows are distended the flap opens, when\r\ncompressed it closes. At a distance of about a foot beyond the air-hole\r\na slightly elliptical iron ring, two palms long and one wide, is\r\nfastened by means of an iron staple to the under part of the\r\nbellows-board; it is at a distance of three palms from the back of the\r\nbellows. In order that the lower bellows-board may remain stationary, a\r\nwooden bolt is driven into the ring, after it penetrates through the\r\nhole in the transverse supporting plank which forms part of the frame\r\nfor the bellows. There are some who dispense with the ring and fasten\r\nthe bellows-board to the frame with two iron screws something like\r\nnails.\r\n\r\nThe bows are placed between the two boards and are of the same length as\r\nthe upper board. They are both made of four pieces of linden wood three\r\ndigits thick, of which the two long ones are seven digits wide at the\r\nback and two and a half at the front; the third piece, which is at the\r\nback, is two palms wide. The ends of the bows are a little more than a\r\ndigit thick, and are mortised to the long pieces, and both having been\r\nbored through, wooden pegs covered with glue are fixed in the holes;\r\nthey are thus joined and glued to the long pieces. Each of the ends is\r\nbowed (_arcuatur_) to meet the end of the long part of the bow, whence\r\nits name \"bow\" originated. The fourth piece keeps the ends of the bow\r\ndistended, and is placed a cubit distant from the head of the bellows;\r\nthe ends of this piece are mortised into the ends of the bow and are\r\njoined and glued to them; its length without the tenons is a foot, and\r\nits width a palm and two digits. There are, besides, two other very\r\nsmall pieces glued to the head of the bellows and to the lower board,\r\nand fastened to them by wooden pegs covered with glue, and they are\r\nthree palms and two digits long, one palm high, and a digit thick, one\r\nhalf being slightly cut away. These pieces keep the ends of the bow away\r\nfrom the hole in the bellows-head, for if they were not there, the ends,\r\nforced inward by the great and frequent movement, would be broken.\r\n\r\nThe leather is of ox-hide or horse-hide, but that of the ox is far\r\npreferable to that of the horse. Each of these hides, for there are two,\r\nis three and a half feet wide where they are joined at the back part of\r\nthe bellows. A long leathern thong is laid along each of the\r\nbellows-boards and each of the bows, and fastened by T-shaped iron nails\r\nfive digits long; each of the horns of the nails is two and a half\r\ndigits long and half a digit wide. The hide is attached to the\r\nbellows-boards by means of these nails, so that a horn of one nail\r\nalmost touches the horn of the next; but it is different with the bows,\r\nfor the hide is fastened to the back piece of the bow by only two nails,\r\nand to the two long pieces by four nails. In this practical manner they\r\nput ten nails in one bow and the same number in the other. Sometimes\r\nwhen the smelter is afraid that the vigorous motion of the bellows may\r\npull or tear the hide from the bows, he also fastens it with little\r\nstrips of pine by means of another kind of nail, but these strips cannot\r\nbe fastened to the back pieces of the bow, because these are somewhat\r\nbent. Some people do not fix the hide to the bellows-boards and bows by\r\niron nails, but by iron screws, screwed at the same time through strips\r\nlaid over the hide. This method of fastening the hide is less used than\r\nthe other, although there is no doubt that it surpasses it in\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nLastly, the head of the bellows, like the rest of the body, consists of\r\ntwo boards, and of a nozzle besides. The upper board is one cubit long,\r\none and a half palms thick. The lower board is part of the whole of the\r\nlower bellows-board; it is of the same length as the upper piece, but a\r\npalm and a digit thick. From these two glued together is made the head,\r\ninto which, when it has been perforated, the nozzle is fixed. The back\r\npart of the head, where it is attached to the rest of the bellows-body,\r\nis a cubit wide, but three palms forward it becomes two digits narrower.\r\nAfterward it is somewhat cut away so that the front end may be rounded,\r\nuntil it is two palms and as many digits in diameter, at which point it\r\nis bound with an iron ring three digits wide.\r\n\r\nThe nozzle is a pipe made of a thin plate of iron; the diameter in front\r\nis three digits, while at the back, where it is encased in the head of\r\nthe bellows, it is a palm high and two palms wide. It thus gradually\r\nwidens out, especially at the back, in order that a copious wind can\r\npenetrate into it; the whole nozzle is three feet long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 365 (Bellows for blast furnaces): A--Upper bellows-board.\r\nB--Lower bellows-board.

XX--Whole bellows.]\r\n\r\nThe upper bellows-board is joined to the head of the bellows in the\r\nfollowing way. An iron plate[7], a palm wide and one and a half palms\r\nlong, is first fastened to the head at a distance of three digits from\r\nthe end; from this plate there projects a piece three digits long and\r\ntwo wide, curved in a small circle. The other side has a similar plate.\r\nThen in the same part of the upper board are fixed two other iron\r\nplates, distant two digits from the edge, each of which are six digits\r\nwide and seven long; in each of these plates the middle part is cut away\r\nfor a little more than three digits in length and for two in depth, so\r\nthat the curved part of the plates on the head corresponding to them may\r\nfit into this cut out part. From both sides of each plate there project\r\npieces, three digits long and two digits wide, similarly curved into\r\nsmall circles. A little iron pin is passed through these curved pieces\r\nof the plates, like a little axle, so that the upper board of the\r\nbellows may turn upon it. The little axle is six digits long and a\r\nlittle more than a digit thick, and a small groove is cut out of the\r\nupper board, where the plates are fastened to it, in such a manner that\r\nthe little axle when fixed to the plates may not fall out. Both plates\r\nfastened to the bellows-board are affixed by four iron nails, of which\r\nthe heads are on the inner part of the board, whereas the points,\r\nclinched at the top, are transformed into heads, so to speak. Each of\r\nthe other plates is fastened to the head of the bellows by means of a\r\nnail with a wide head, and by two other nails of which the heads are on\r\nthe edge of the bellows-head. Midway between the two plates on the\r\nbellows-board there remains a space two palms wide, which is covered by\r\nan iron plate fastened to the board by little nails; and another plate\r\ncorresponding to this is fastened to the head between the other two\r\nplates; they are two palms and the same number of digits wide.\r\n\r\nThe hide is common to the head as to all the other parts of the body;\r\nthe plates are covered with it, as well as the front part of the upper\r\nbellows-board, and both the bows and the back of the head of the\r\nbellows, so that the wind may not escape from that part of the bellows.\r\nIt is three palms and as many digits wide, and long enough to extend\r\nfrom one of the sides of the lower board over the back of the upper; it\r\nis fastened by many T-headed nails on one side to the upper board, and\r\non the other side to the head of the bellows, and both ends are fastened\r\nto the lower bellows-board.\r\n\r\nIn the above manner the bellows is made. As two are required for each\r\nfurnace, it is necessary to have twelve bellows, if there are to be six\r\nfurnaces in one works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 368 (Bellows for blast furnaces): A--Front sill. B--Back\r\nsill. C--Front posts. D--Their slots. E--Beam imposed upon them.\r\nF--Higher posts. G--Their slots. H--Beam imposed upon them. I--Timber\r\njoined in the mortises of the posts. K--Planks. L--Transverse supporting\r\nplanks. M--The holes in them. N--Pipe. O--Its front end. P--Its rear\r\nend.]\r\n\r\nNow it is time to describe their framework. First, two sills a little\r\nshorter than the furnace wall are placed on the ground. The front one of\r\nthese is three palms wide and thick, and the back one three palms and\r\ntwo digits. The front one is two feet distant from the back wall of the\r\nfurnace, and the back one is six feet three palms distant from the front\r\none. They are set into the earth, that they may remain firm; there are\r\nsome who accomplish this by means of pegs which, through several holes,\r\npenetrate deeply into the ground.\r\n\r\nThen twelve short posts are erected, whose lower ends are mortised into\r\nthe sill that is near the back of the furnace wall; these posts are two\r\nfeet high, exclusive of the tenons, and are three palms and the same\r\nnumber of digits wide, and two palms thick. A slot one and a half palms\r\nwide is cut through them, beginning two palms from the bottom and\r\nextending for a height of three palms. All the posts are not placed at\r\nthe same intervals, the first being at a distance of three feet five\r\ndigits from the second, and likewise the third from the fourth, but the\r\nsecond is two feet one palm and three digits from the third; the\r\nintervals between the other posts are arranged in the same manner, equal\r\nand unequal, of which each four pertain to two furnaces. The upper ends\r\nof these posts are mortised into a transverse beam which is twelve feet,\r\ntwo palms, and three digits long, and projects five digits beyond the\r\nfirst post and to the same distance beyond the fourth; it is two palms\r\nand the same number of digits wide, and two palms thick. Since each\r\nseparate transverse beam supports four bellows, it is necessary to have\r\nthree of them.\r\n\r\nBehind the twelve short posts the same number of higher posts are\r\nerected, of which each has the middle part of the lower end cut out, so\r\nthat its two resulting lower ends are mortised into the back sill; these\r\nposts, exclusive of the tenons, are twelve feet and two palms high, and\r\nare five palms wide and two palms thick. They are cut out from the\r\nbottom upward, the slot being four feet and five digits high and six\r\ndigits wide. The upper ends of these posts are mortised into a long beam\r\nimposed upon them; this long beam is placed close under the timbers\r\nwhich extend from the wall at the back of the furnace to the first long\r\nwall; the beam is three palms wide and two palms thick, and forty-three\r\nfeet long. If such a long one is not at hand, two or three may be\r\nsubstituted for it, which when joined together make up that length.\r\nThese higher posts are not placed at equal distances, but the first is\r\nat a distance of two feet three palms one digit from the second, and the\r\nthird is at the same distance from the fourth; while the second is at a\r\ndistance of one foot three palms and the same number of digits from the\r\nthird, and in the same manner the rest of the posts are arranged at\r\nequal and unequal intervals. Moreover, there is in every post, where it\r\nfaces the shorter post, a mortise at a foot and a digit above the slot;\r\nin these mortises of the four posts is tenoned a timber which itself has\r\nfour mortises. Tenons are enclosed in mortises in order that they may be\r\nbetter joined, and they are transfixed with wooden pins. This timber is\r\nthirteen feet three palms one digit long, and it projects beyond the\r\nfirst post a distance of two palms and two digits, and to the same\r\nnumber of palms and digits beyond the fourth post. It is two palms and\r\nas many digits wide, and also two palms thick. As there are twelve posts\r\nit is necessary to have three timbers of this kind.\r\n\r\nOn each of these timbers, and on each of the cross-beams which are laid\r\nupon the shorter posts, are placed four planks, each nine feet long, two\r\npalms three digits wide, and two palms one digit thick. The first plank\r\nis five feet one palm one digit distant from the second, at the front as\r\nwell as at the back, for each separate plank is placed outside of the\r\nposts. The third is at the same distance from the fourth, but the second\r\nis one foot and three digits distant from the third. In the same manner\r\nthe rest of the eight planks are arranged at intervals, the fifth from\r\nthe sixth and the seventh from the eighth are at the same distances as\r\nthe first from the second and the third from the fourth; the sixth is at\r\nthe same distance from the seventh as the second from the third.\r\n\r\nTwo planks support one transverse plank six feet long, one foot wide,\r\none palm thick, placed at a distance of three feet and two palms from\r\nthe back posts. When there are six of these supporting planks, on each\r\nseparate one are placed two bellows; the lower bellows-boards project a\r\npalm beyond them. From each of the bellows-boards an iron ring descends\r\nthrough a hole in its supporting plank, and a wooden peg is driven into\r\nthe ring, so that the bellows-board may remain stationary, as I stated\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe two bellows communicate, each by its own plank, to the back of a\r\ncopper pipe in which are set both of the nozzles, and their ends are\r\ntightly fastened in it. The pipe is made of a rolled copper or iron\r\nplate, a foot and two palms and the same number of digits long; the\r\nplate is half a digit thick, but a digit thick at the back. The interior\r\nof the pipe is three digits wide, and two and a half digits high in the\r\nfront, for it is not absolutely round; and at the back it is a foot and\r\ntwo palms and three digits in diameter. The plate from which the pipe is\r\nmade is not entirely joined up, but at the front there is left a crack\r\nhalf a digit wide, increasing at the back to three digits. This pipe is\r\nplaced in the hole in the furnace, which, as I said, was in the middle\r\nof the wall and the arch. The nozzles of the bellows, placed in this\r\npipe, are a distance of five digits from its front end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 370 (Bellows for blast furnaces): A--Lever which when\r\ndepressed by means of a cam compresses the bellows.

These levers are\r\neight feet three palms long, one palm wide and thick, and the ends are\r\ninserted in the slots of the posts; they project beyond the front posts\r\nto a distance of two palms, and the same distance beyond the back posts\r\nin order that each may have its end depressed by its two cams on the\r\naxle. The cams not only penetrate into the slots of the back posts, but\r\nproject three digits beyond them. An iron pin is set in round holes made\r\nthrough both sides of the slot of each front post, at three palms and as\r\nmany digits from the bottom; the pin penetrates the lever, which turns\r\nabout it when depressed or raised. The back of the lever for the length\r\nof a cubit is a palm and a digit wider than the rest, and is perforated;\r\nin this hole is engaged a bar six feet and two palms long, three digits\r\nwide, and about one and one-half digits thick; it is somewhat hooked at\r\nthe upper end, and approaches the handle of the bellows. Under the lever\r\nthere is a nail, which penetrates through a hole in the bar, so that the\r\nlever and bar may move together. The bar is perforated in the upper end\r\nat a distance of six digits from the top; this hole is two palms long\r\nand a digit wide, and in it is engaged the hook of an iron implement\r\nwhich is a digit thick. At the upper part this implement has either a\r\nround or square opening, like a link, and at the lower end is hooked;\r\nthe link is two digits high and wide and the hook is three digits long;\r\nthe middle part between the link and the hook is three palms and two\r\ndigits long. The link of this implement engages either the handle of the\r\nbellows, or else a large ring which does engage it. This iron ring is a\r\ndigit thick, two palms wide on the inside of the upper part, and two\r\ndigits in the lower part, and this iron ring, not unlike the first one,\r\nengages the handle of the bellows. The iron ring either has its narrower\r\npart turned upward, and in it is engaged the ring of another iron\r\nimplement, similar to the first, whose hook, extending upward, grips the\r\nrope fastened to the iron ring holding the end of the second lever, of\r\nwhich I will speak presently; or else the iron ring grips this lever,\r\nand then in its hook is engaged the ring of the other implement whose\r\nring engages the handle of the bellows, and in this case the rope is\r\ndispensed with.\r\n\r\nResting on beams fixed in the two walls is a longitudinal beam, at a\r\ndistance of four and a half feet from the back posts; it is two palms\r\nwide, one and a half palms thick. There are mortised into this\r\nlongitudinal beam the lower ends of upper posts three palms wide and two\r\nthick, which are six feet two palms high, exclusive of their tenons. The\r\nupper ends of these posts are mortised into an upper longitudinal beam,\r\nwhich lies close under the rafters of the building; this upper\r\nlongitudinal beam is two palms wide and one thick. The upper posts have\r\na slot cut out upward from a point two feet from the bottom, and the\r\nslot is two feet high and six digits wide. Through these upper posts a\r\nround hole is bored from one side to the other at a point three feet one\r\npalm from the bottom, and a small iron axle penetrates through the hole\r\nand is fastened there. Around this small iron axle turns the second\r\nlever when it is depressed and raised. This lever is eight feet long,\r\nand its other end is three digits wider than the rest of the lever; at\r\nthis widest point is a hole two digits wide and three high, in which is\r\nfixed an iron ring, to which is tied the rope I have mentioned; it is\r\nfive palms long, its upper loop is two palms and as many digits wide,\r\nand the lower one is one palm one digit wide. This half of the second\r\nlever, the end of which I have just mentioned, is three palms high and\r\none wide; it projects three feet beyond the slot of the post on which it\r\nturns; the other end, which faces the back wall of the furnaces, is one\r\nfoot and a palm high and a foot wide.\r\n\r\nOn this part of the lever stands and is fixed a box three and a half\r\nfeet long, one foot and one palm wide, and half a foot deep; but these\r\nmeasurements vary; sometimes the bottom of this box is narrower,\r\nsometimes equal in width to the top. In either case, it is filled with\r\nstones and earth to make it heavy, but the smelters have to be on their\r\nguard and make provision against the stones falling out, owing to the\r\nconstant motion; this is prevented by means of an iron band which is\r\nplaced over the top, both ends being wedge-shaped and driven into the\r\nlever so that the stones can be held in. Some people, in place of the\r\nbox, drive four or more pegs into the lever and put mud between them,\r\nthe required amount being added to the weight or taken away from it.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be considered the method of using this machine. The\r\nlower lever, being depressed by the cams, compresses the bellows, and\r\nthe compression drives the air through the nozzle. Then the weight of\r\nthe box on the other end of the upper lever raises the upper\r\nbellows-board, and the air is drawn in, entering through the air-hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 372 (Bellows for blast furnaces): A--Axle. B--Water-wheel.\r\nC--Drum composed of rundles. D--Other axle. E--Toothed wheel. F--Its\r\nspokes. G--Its segments. H--Its teeth. I--Cams of the axle.]\r\n\r\nThe machine whose cams depress the lower lever is made as follows. First\r\nthere is an axle, on whose end outside the building is a water-wheel; at\r\nthe other end, which is inside the building, is a drum made of rundles.\r\nThis drum is composed of two double hubs, a foot apart, which are five\r\ndigits thick, the radius all round being a foot and two digits; but they\r\nare double, because each hub is composed of two discs, equally thick,\r\nfastened together with wooden pegs glued in. These hubs are sometimes\r\ncovered above and around by iron plates. The rundles are thirty in\r\nnumber, a foot and two palms and the same number of digits long, with\r\neach end fastened into a hub; they are rounded, three digits in\r\ndiameter, and the same number of digits apart. In this practical manner\r\nis made the drum composed of rundles.\r\n\r\nThere is a toothed wheel, two palms and a digit thick, on the end of\r\nanother axle; this wheel is composed of a double disc[8]. The inner disc\r\nis composed of four segments a palm thick, everywhere two palms and a\r\ndigit wide. The outer disc, like the inner, is made of four segments,\r\nand is a palm and a digit thick; it is not equally wide, but where the\r\nhead of the spokes are inserted it is a foot and a palm and digit wide,\r\nwhile on each side of the spokes it becomes a little narrower, until the\r\nnarrowest part is only two palms and the same number of digits wide. The\r\nouter segments are joined to the inner ones in such a manner that, on\r\nthe one hand, an outer segment ends in the middle of an inner one, and,\r\non the other hand, the ends of the inner segments are joined in the\r\nmiddle of the outer ones; there is no doubt that by this kind of joining\r\nthe wheel is made stronger. The outer segments are fastened to the inner\r\nby means of a large number of wooden pegs. Each segment, measured over\r\nits round back, is four feet and three palms long. There are four\r\nspokes, each two palms wide and a palm and a digit thick; their length,\r\nexcluding the tenons, being two feet and three digits. One end of the\r\nspoke is mortised into the axle, where it is firmly fastened with pegs;\r\nthe wide part of the other end, in the shape of a triangle, is mortised\r\ninto the outer segment opposite it, keeping the shape of the same as far\r\nas the segment ascends. They also are joined together with wooden pegs\r\nglued in, and these pegs are driven into the spokes under the inner\r\ndisc. The parts of the spokes in the shape of the triangle are on the\r\ninside; the outer part is simple. This triangle has two sides equal, the\r\nerect ones as is evident, which are a palm long; the lower side is not\r\nof the same length, but is five digits long, and a mortise of the same\r\nshape is cut out of the segments. The wheel has sixty teeth, since it is\r\nnecessary that the rundle drum should revolve twice while the toothed\r\nwheel revolves once. The teeth are a foot long, and project one palm\r\nfrom the inner disc of the wheel, and three digits from the outer disc;\r\nthey are a palm wide and two and a half digits thick, and it is\r\nnecessary that they should be three digits apart, as were the rundles.\r\n\r\nThe axle should have a thickness in proportion to the spokes and the\r\nsegments. As it has two cams to depress each of the levers, it is\r\nnecessary that it should have twenty-four cams, which project beyond it\r\na foot and a palm and a digit. The cams are of almost semicircular\r\nshape, of which the widest part is three palms and a digit wide, and\r\nthey are a palm thick; they are distributed according to the four sides\r\nof the axle, on the upper, the lower and the two lateral sides. The axle\r\nhas twelve holes, of which the first penetrates through from the upper\r\nside to the lower, the second from one lateral side to the other; the\r\nfirst hole is four feet two palms distant from the second; each\r\nalternate one of these holes is made in the same direction, and they are\r\narranged at equal intervals. Each single cam must be opposite another;\r\nthe first is inserted into the upper part of the first hole, the second\r\ninto the lower part of the same hole, and so fixed by pegs that they do\r\nnot fall out; the third cam is inserted into that part of the second\r\nhole which is on the right side, and the fourth into that part on the\r\nleft. In like manner all the cams are inserted into the consecutive\r\nholes, for which reason it happens that the cams depress the levers of\r\nthe bellows in rotation. Finally we must not omit to state that this is\r\nonly one of many such axles having cams and a water-wheel.\r\n\r\nI have arrived thus far with many words, and yet it is not unreasonable\r\nthat I have in this place pursued the subject minutely, since the\r\nsmelting of all the metals, to which I am about to proceed, could not be\r\nundertaken without it.\r\n\r\nThe ores of gold, silver, copper, and lead, are smelted in a furnace by\r\nfour different methods. The first method is for the rich ores of gold or\r\nsilver, the second for the mediocre ores, the third for the poor ores,\r\nand the fourth method is for those ores which contain copper or lead,\r\nwhether they contain precious metals or are wanting in them. The\r\nsmelting of the first ores is performed in the furnace of which the\r\ntap-hole is intermittently closed; the other three ores are melted in\r\nfurnaces of which the tap-holes are always open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 373 (Stamp-mill): A--Charcoal. B--Mortar-box. C--Stamps.]\r\n\r\nFirst, I will speak of the manner in which the furnaces are prepared for\r\nthe smelting of the ores, and of the first method of smelting. The\r\npowder from which the hearth and forehearth should be made is composed\r\nof charcoal and earth (clay?). The charcoal is crushed by the stamps in\r\na mortar-box, the front of which is closed by a board at the top, while\r\nthe charcoal, crushed to powder, is removed through the open part\r\nbelow; the stamps are not shod with iron, but are made entirely of wood,\r\nalthough at the lower part they are bound round at the wide part by an\r\niron band.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 374 (Clay Washing): A--Tub. B--Sieve. C--Rods.\r\nD--Bench-frame.]\r\n\r\nThe powder into which the charcoal is crushed is thrown on to a sieve\r\nwhose bottom consists of interwoven withes of wood. The sieve is drawn\r\nbackward and forward over two wooden or iron rods placed in a triangular\r\nposition on a tub, or over a bench-frame set on the floor of the\r\nbuilding; the powder which falls into the tub or on to the floor is of\r\nsuitable size, but the pieces of small charcoal which remain in the\r\nsieve are emptied out and thrown back under the stamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 375 (Clay Washing): A--Screen. B--Poles. C--Shovel.\r\nD--Two-wheeled cart. E--Hand-sieve. F--Narrow boards. G--Box. H--Covered\r\npit.]\r\n\r\nWhen the earth is dug up it is first exposed to the sun that it may dry.\r\nLater on it is thrown with a shovel on to a screen--set up obliquely and\r\nsupported by poles,--made of thick, loosely woven hazel withes, and in\r\nthis way the fine earth and its small lumps pass through the holes of\r\nthe screen, but the clods and stones do not pass through, but run down\r\nto the ground. The earth which passes through the screen is conveyed in\r\na two-wheeled cart to the works and there sifted. This sieve, which is\r\nnot dissimilar to the one described above, is drawn backward and\r\nforward upon narrow boards of equal length placed over a long box; the\r\npowder which falls through the sieve into the box is suitable for the\r\nmixture; the lumps that remain in the sieve are thrown away by some\r\npeople, but by others they are placed under the stamps. This powdered\r\nearth is mixed with powdered charcoal, moistened, and thrown into a pit,\r\nand in order that it may remain good for a long time, the pit is covered\r\nup with boards so that the mixture may not become contaminated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 377 (Implements for Furnace Work): A--Furnace.

The interior of the new furnace is lined with\r\nlute, so that the cracks in the walls, if there are any, may be filled\r\nup, but especially in order to preserve the rock from injury by fire. In\r\nold furnaces in which ore has been melted, as soon as the rocks have\r\ncooled the assistant chips away, with a spatula, the accretions which\r\nadhere to the walls, and then breaks them up with an iron hoe or a rake\r\nwith five teeth. The cracks of the furnace are first filled in with\r\nfragments of rock or brick, which he does by passing his hand into the\r\nfurnace through its mouth, or else, having placed a ladder against it,\r\nhe mounts by the rungs to the upper open part of the furnace. To the\r\nupper part of the ladder a board is fastened that he may lean and\r\nrecline against it. Then standing on the same ladder, with a wooden\r\nspatula, he smears the furnace walls over with lute; this spatula is\r\nfour feet long, a digit thick, and for a foot upward from the bottom it\r\nis a palm wide, or even wider, generally two and a half digits. He\r\nspreads the lute equally over the inner walls of the furnace. The mouth\r\nof the copper pipe[9] should not protrude from the lute, lest sows[10]\r\nform round about it and thus impede the melting, for the furnace bellows\r\ncould not force a blast through them. Then the same assistant throws a\r\nlittle powdered charcoal into the pit of the forehearth and sprinkles it\r\nwith pulverised earth. Afterward, with a bucket he pours water into it\r\nand sweeps this all over the forehearth pit, and with the broom drives\r\nthe turbid water into the furnace hearth and likewise sweeps it out.\r\nNext he throws the mixed and moistened powder into the furnace, and then\r\na second time mounting the steps of the ladder, he introduces the rammer\r\ninto the furnace and pounds the powder so that the hearth is made solid.\r\nThe rammer is rounded and three palms long; at the bottom it is five\r\ndigits in diameter, at the top three and a half, therefore it is made in\r\nthe form of a truncated cone; the handle of the rammer is round and five\r\nfeet long and two and a half digits thick; the upper part of the\r\nrammer, where the handle is inserted, is bound with an iron band two\r\ndigits wide. There are some who, instead, use two rounded rammers three\r\nand a half digits in diameter, the same at the bottom as at the top.\r\nSome people prefer two wooden spatulas, or a rammer spatula.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, mixed and moistened powder is thrown and pounded\r\nwith a rammer in the forehearth pit, which is outside the furnace. When\r\nthis is nearly completed, powder is again put in, and pushed with the\r\nrammer up toward the protruding copper pipe, so that from a point a\r\ndigit under the mouth of the copper pipe the hearth slopes down into the\r\ncrucible of the forehearth,[11] and the metal can run down. The same is\r\nrepeated until the forehearth pit is full, then afterward this is\r\nhollowed out with a curved blade; this blade is of iron, two palms and\r\nas many digits long, three digits wide, blunt at the top and sharp at\r\nthe bottom. The crucible of the forehearth must be round, a foot in\r\ndiameter and two palms deep if it has to contain a _centumpondium_ of\r\nlead, or if only seventy _librae_, then three palms in diameter and two\r\npalms deep like the other. When the forehearth has been hollowed out it\r\nis pounded with a round bronze rammer. This is five digits high and the\r\nsame in diameter, having a curved round handle one and a half digits\r\nthick; or else another bronze rammer is used, which is fashioned in the\r\nshape of a cone, truncated at the top, on which is imposed another cut\r\naway at the bottom, so that the middle part of the rammer may be grasped\r\nby the hand; this is six digits high, and five digits in diameter at the\r\nlower end and four at the top. Some use in its place a wooden spatula\r\ntwo and a half palms wide at the lower end and one palm thick.\r\n\r\nThe assistant, having prepared the forehearth, returns to the furnace\r\nand besmears both sides as well as the top of the mouth with simple\r\nlute. In the lower part of the mouth he places lute that has been dipped\r\nin charcoal dust, to guard against the risk of the lute attracting to\r\nitself the powder of the hearth and vitiating it. Next he lays in the\r\nmouth of the furnace a straight round rod three quarters of a foot long\r\nand three digits in diameter. Afterward he places a piece of charcoal on\r\nthe lute, of the same length and width as the mouth, so that it is\r\nentirely closed up; if there be not at hand one piece of charcoal so\r\nlarge, he takes two instead. When the mouth is thus closed up, he throws\r\ninto the furnace a wicker basket full of charcoal, and in order that the\r\npiece of charcoal with which the mouth of the furnace is closed should\r\nnot then fall out, the master holds it in with his hand. The pieces of\r\ncharcoal which are thrown into the furnace should be of medium size, for\r\nif they are large they impede the blast of the bellows and prevent it\r\nfrom blowing through the tap-hole of the furnace into the forehearth to\r\nheat it. Then the master covers over the charcoal, placed at the mouth\r\nof the furnace, with lute and extracts the wooden rod, and thus the\r\nfurnace is prepared. Afterward the assistant throws four or five larger\r\nbaskets full of charcoal into the furnace, filling it right up; he also\r\nthrows a little charcoal into the forehearth, and places glowing coals\r\nupon it in order that it may be kindled, but in order that the flames of\r\nthis fire should not enter through the tap-hole of the furnace and fire\r\nthe charcoal inside, he covers the tap-hole with lute or closes it with\r\nfragments of pottery. Some do not warm the forehearth the same evening,\r\nbut place large charcoals round the edge of it, one leaning on the\r\nother; those who follow the first method sweep out the forehearth in the\r\nmorning, and clean out the little pieces of charcoal and cinders, while\r\nthose who follow the latter method take, early in the morning, burning\r\nfirebrands, which have been prepared by the watchman of the works, and\r\nplace them on the charcoal.\r\n\r\nAt the fourth hour the master begins his work. He first inserts a small\r\npiece of glowing coal into the furnace, through the bronze nozzle-pipe\r\nof the bellows, and blows up the fire with the bellows; thus within the\r\nspace of half an hour the forehearth, as well as the hearth, becomes\r\nwarmed, and of course more quickly if on the preceding day ores have\r\nbeen smelted in the same furnace, but if not then it warms more slowly.\r\nIf the hearth and forehearth are not warmed before the ore to be smelted\r\nis thrown in, the furnace is injured and the metals lost; or if the\r\npowder from which both are made is damp in summer or frozen in winter,\r\nthey will be cracked, and, giving out a sound like thunder, they will\r\nblow out the metals and other substances with great peril to the\r\nworkmen. After the furnace has been warmed, the master throws in slags,\r\nand these, when melted, flow out through the tap-hole into the\r\nforehearth. Then he closes up the tap-hole at once with mixed lute and\r\ncharcoal dust; this plug he fastens with his hand to a round wooden\r\nrammer that is five digits thick, two palms high, with a handle three\r\nfeet long. The smelter extracts the slags from the forehearth with a\r\nhooked bar; if the ore to be smelted is rich in gold or silver he puts\r\ninto the forehearth a _centumpondium_ of lead, or half as much if the\r\nore is poor, because the former requires much lead, the latter little;\r\nhe immediately throws burning firebrands on to the lead so that it\r\nmelts. Afterward he performs everything according to the usual manner\r\nand order, whereby he first throws into the furnace as many cakes melted\r\nfrom pyrites[12], as he requires to smelt the ore; then he puts in two\r\nwicker baskets full of ore with litharge and hearth-lead[13], and stones\r\nwhich fuse easily by fire of the second order, all mixed together; then\r\none wicker basket full of charcoal, and lastly the slags. The furnace\r\nnow being filled with all the things I have mentioned, the ore is slowly\r\nsmelted; he does not put too much of it against the back wall of the\r\nfurnace, lest sows should form around the nozzles of the bellows and the\r\nblast be impeded and the fire burn less fiercely.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, is the custom of many most excellent smelters, who know\r\nhow to govern the four elements[14]. They combine in right proportion\r\nthe ores, which are part earth, placing no more than is suitable in the\r\nfurnaces; they pour in the needful quantity of water; they moderate with\r\nskill the air from the bellows; they throw the ore into that part of the\r\nfire which burns fiercely. The master sprinkles water into each part of\r\nthe furnace to dampen the charcoal slightly, so that the minute parts of\r\nore may adhere to it, which otherwise the blast of the bellows and the\r\nforce of the fire would agitate and blow away with the fumes. But as the\r\nnature of the ores to be smelted varies, the smelters have to arrange\r\nthe hearth now high, now low, and to place the pipe in which the nozzles\r\nof the bellows are inserted sometimes on a great and sometimes at a\r\nslight angle, so that the blast of the bellows may blow into the\r\nfurnace in either a mild or a vigorous manner. For those ores which heat\r\nand fuse easily, a low hearth is necessary for the work of the smelters,\r\nand the pipe must be placed at a gentle angle to produce a mild blast\r\nfrom the bellows. On the contrary, those ores that heat and fuse slowly\r\nmust have a high hearth, and the pipe must be placed at a steep incline\r\nin order to blow a strong blast of the bellows, and it is necessary, for\r\nthis kind of ore, to have a very hot furnace in which slags, or cakes\r\nmelted from pyrites, or stones which melt easily in the fire[15], are\r\nfirst melted, so that the ore should not settle in the hearth of the\r\nfurnace and obstruct and choke up the tap-hole, as the minute metallic\r\nparticles that have been washed from the ores are wont to do. Large\r\nbellows have wide nozzles, for if they were narrow the copious and\r\nstrong blast would be too much compressed and too acutely blown into the\r\nfurnace, and then the melted material would be chilled, and would form\r\nsows around the nozzle, and thus obstruct the opening into the furnace,\r\nwhich would cause great damage to the proprietors' property. If the ores\r\nagglomerate and do not fuse, the smelter, mounting on the ladder placed\r\nagainst the side of the furnace, divides the charge with a pointed or\r\nhooked bar, which he also pushes down into the pipe in which the nozzle\r\nof the bellows is placed, and by a downward movement dislodges the ore\r\nand the sows from around it.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of an hour, when the lead which the assistant has placed\r\nin the forehearth is melted, the master opens the tap-hole of the\r\nfurnace with a tapping-bar. This bar is made of iron, is three and a\r\nhalf feet long, the forward end pointed and a little curved, and the\r\nback end hollow so that into it may be inserted a wooden handle, which\r\nis three feet long and thick enough to be well grasped by the hand. The\r\nslag first flows from the furnace into the forehearth, and in it are\r\nstones mixed with metal or with the metal adhering to them partly\r\naltered, the slag also containing earth and solidified juices. After\r\nthis the material from the melted pyrites flows out, and then the molten\r\nlead contained in the forehearth absorbs the gold and silver. When that\r\nwhich has run out has stood for some time in the forehearth, in order to\r\nbe able to separate one from the other, the master first either skims\r\noff the slags with the hooked bar or else lifts them off with an iron\r\nfork; the slags, as they are very light, float on the top. He next draws\r\noff the cakes of melted pyrites, which as they are of medium weight hold\r\nthe middle place; he leaves in the forehearth the alloy of gold or\r\nsilver with the lead, for these being the heaviest, sink to the bottom.\r\nAs, however, there is a difference in slags, the uppermost containing\r\nlittle metal, the middle more, and the lowest much, he puts these away\r\nseparately, each in its own place, in order that to each heap, when it\r\nis re-smelted, he may add the proper fluxes, and can put in as much lead\r\nas is demanded for the metal in the slag; when the slag is re-melted, if\r\nit emits much odour, there is some metal in it; if it emits no odour,\r\nthen it contains none. He puts the cakes of melted pyrites away\r\nseparately, as they were nearest in the forehearth to the metal, and\r\ncontain a little more of it than the slags; from all these cakes a\r\nconical mound is built up, by always placing the widest of them at the\r\nbottom. The hooked bar has a hook on the end, hence its name; otherwise\r\nit is similar to other bars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 383 (Blast Furnaces): A, B, C--Three furnaces.

N--Another mine captain opens a chest in which his\r\nthings are kept.]\r\n\r\nAfterward the master closes up the tap-hole and fills the furnace with\r\nthe same materials I described above, and again, the ores having been\r\nmelted, he opens the tap-hole, and with a hooked bar extracts the slags\r\nand the cakes melted from pyrites, which have run down into the\r\nforehearth. He repeats the same operation until a certain and definite\r\npart of the ore has been smelted, and the day's work is at an end; if\r\nthe ore was rich the work is finished in eight hours; if poor, it takes\r\na longer time. But if the ore was so rich as to be smelted in less than\r\neight hours, another operation is in the meanwhile combined with the\r\nfirst, and both are performed in the space of ten hours. When all the\r\nore has been smelted, he throws into the furnace a basket full of\r\nlitharge or hearth-lead, so that the metal which has remained in the\r\naccretions may run out with these when melted. When he has finally drawn\r\nout of the forehearth the slags and the cakes melted from pyrites, he\r\ntakes out, with a ladle, the lead alloyed with gold or silver and pours\r\nit into little iron or copper pans, three palms wide and as many digits\r\ndeep, but first lined on the inside with lute and dried by warming, lest\r\nthe glowing molten substances should break through. The iron ladle is\r\ntwo palms wide, and in other respects it is similar to the others, all\r\nof which have a sufficiently long iron shaft, so that the fire should\r\nnot burn the wooden part of the handle. When the alloy has been poured\r\nout of the forehearth, the smelter foreman and the mine captain weigh\r\nthe cakes.\r\n\r\nThen the master breaks out the whole of the mouth of the furnace with a\r\ncrowbar, and with that other hooked bar, the rabble and the five-toothed\r\nrake, he extracts the accretions and the charcoal. This crowbar is not\r\nunlike the other hooked one, but larger and wider; the handle of the\r\nrabble is six feet long and is half of iron and half of wood. The\r\nfurnace having cooled, the master chips off the accretions clinging to\r\nthe walls with a rectangular spatula six digits long, a palm broad, and\r\nsharp on the front edge; it has a round handle four feet long, half of\r\nit being of iron and half of wood. This is the first method of smelting\r\nores.\r\n\r\nBecause they generally consist of unequal constituents, some of which\r\nmelt rapidly and others slowly, the ores rich in gold and silver cannot\r\nbe smelted as rapidly or as easily by the other methods as they can by\r\nthe first method, for three important reasons. The first reason is that,\r\nas often as the closed tap-hole of the furnace is opened with a\r\ntapping-bar, so often can the smelter observe whether the ore is\r\nmelting too quickly or too slowly, or whether it is flaming in scattered\r\nbits, and not uniting in one mass; in the first case the ore is smelting\r\ntoo slowly and not without great expense; in the second case the metal\r\nmixes with the slag which flows out of the furnace into the forehearth,\r\nwherefore there is the expense of melting it again; in the third case,\r\nthe metal is consumed by the violence of the fire. Each of these evils\r\nhas its remedy; if the ore melts slowly or does not come together, it is\r\nnecessary to add some amount of fluxes which melt the ore; or if they\r\nmelt too readily, to decrease the amount.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that each time that the furnace is opened with a\r\ntapping-bar, it flows out into the forehearth, and the smelter is able\r\nto test the alloy of gold and lead or of silver with lead, which is\r\ncalled _stannum_.[16] When the tap-hole is opened the second or third\r\ntime, this test shows us whether the alloy of gold or silver has become\r\nricher, or whether the lead is too debilitated and wanting in strength\r\nto absorb any more gold or silver. If it has become richer, some portion\r\nof lead added to it should renew its strength; if it has not become\r\nricher, it is poured out of the forehearth that it may be replaced with\r\nfresh lead.\r\n\r\nThe third reason is that if the tap-hole of the furnace is always open\r\nwhen the ore and other things are being smelted, the fluxes, which are\r\neasily melted, run out of the furnace before the rich gold and silver\r\nores, for these are sometimes of a kind that oppose and resist melting\r\nby the fire for a longer period. It follows in this case, that some part\r\nof the ore is either consumed or is mixed with the accretions, and as a\r\nresult little lumps of ore not yet melted are now and then found in the\r\naccretions. Therefore when these ores are being smelted, the tap-hole of\r\nthe furnace should be closed for a time, as it is necessary to heat and\r\nmix the ore and the fluxes at the same time; since the fluxes fuse more\r\nrapidly than the ore, when the molten fluxes are held in the furnace,\r\nthey thus melt the ore which does not readily fuse or mix with the lead.\r\nThe lead absorbs the gold or silver, just as tin or lead when melted in\r\nthe forehearth absorbs the other unmelted metal which has been thrown\r\ninto it. But if the molten matter is poured upon that which is not\r\nmolten, it runs off on all sides and consequently does not melt it. It\r\nfollows from all this that ores rich in gold or silver, when put into a\r\nfurnace with its tap-hole always open, cannot for that reason be smelted\r\nso successfully as in one where the tap-hole is closed for a time, so\r\nthat during this time the ore may be melted by the molten fluxes.\r\nAfterward, when the tap-hole has been opened, they flow into the\r\nforehearth and mix there with the molten lead. This method of smelting\r\nthe ores is used by us and by the Bohemians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 385 (Blast Furnaces): A, B--Two furnaces. C--Forehearths.\r\nD--Dipping-pot.

L--The master stands at the other furnace and\r\nprepares the forehearth by ramming it with two rammers. M--Crowbar.]\r\n\r\nThe three remaining methods of smelting ores are similar to each other\r\nin that the tap-holes of the furnaces always remain open, so that the\r\nmolten metals may continually run out. They differ greatly from each\r\nother, however, for the tap-hole of the first of this kind is deeper\r\nin the furnace and narrower than that of the third, and besides it is\r\ninvisible and concealed. It easily discharges into the forehearth, which\r\nis one and a half feet higher than the floor of the building, in order\r\nthat below it to the left a dipping-pot can be made. When the forehearth\r\nis nearly full of the slags, which well up from the invisible tap-hole\r\nof the furnace, they are skimmed off from the top with a hooked bar;\r\nthen the alloy of gold or silver with lead and the melted pyrites, being\r\nuncovered, flow into the dipping-pot, and the latter are made into\r\ncakes; these cakes are broken and thrown back into the furnace so that\r\nall their metal may be smelted out. The alloy is poured into little iron\r\nmoulds.\r\n\r\nThe smelter, besides lead and cognate things, uses fluxes which combine\r\nwith the ore, of which I gave a sufficient account in Book VII. The\r\nmetals which are melted from ores that fuse readily in the fire, are\r\nprofitable because they are smelted in a short time, while those which\r\nare difficult to fuse are not as profitable, because they take a long\r\ntime. When fluxes remain in the furnace and do not melt, they are not\r\nsuitable; for this reason, accretions and slags are the most convenient\r\nfor smelting, because they melt quickly. It is necessary to have an\r\nindustrious and experienced smelter, who in the first place takes care\r\nnot to put into the furnace more ores mixed with fluxes than it can\r\naccommodate.\r\n\r\nThe powder out of which this furnace hearth and the adjoining forehearth\r\nand the dipping-pot are usually made, consists mostly of equal\r\nproportions of charcoal dust and of earth, or of equal parts of the same\r\nand of ashes. When the hearth of the furnace is prepared, a rod that\r\nwill reach to the forehearth is put into it, higher up if the ore to be\r\nsmelted readily fuses, and lower down if it fuses with difficulty. When\r\nthe dipping-pot and forehearth are finished, the rod is drawn out of the\r\nfurnace so that the tap-hole is open, and through it the molten material\r\nflows continuously into the forehearth, which should be very near the\r\nfurnace in order that it may keep very hot and the alloy thus be made\r\npurer. If the ore to be smelted does not melt easily, the hearth of the\r\nfurnace must not be made too sloping, lest the molten fluxes should run\r\ndown into the forehearth before the ore is smelted, and the metal thus\r\nremain in the accretions on the sides of the furnace. The smelter must\r\nnot ram the hearth so much that it becomes too hard, nor make the\r\nmistake of ramming the lower part of the mouth to make it hard, for it\r\ncould not breathe[17], nor could the molten matter flow freely out of\r\nthe furnace. The ore which does not readily melt is thrown as much as\r\npossible to the back of the furnace, and toward that part where the fire\r\nburns very fiercely, so that it may be smelted longer. In this way the\r\nsmelter may direct it whither he wills. Only when it glows at the part\r\nnear the bellows' nozzle does it signify that all the ore is smelted\r\nwhich has been thrown to the side of the furnace in which the nozzles\r\nare placed. If the ore is easily melted, one or two wicker baskets full\r\nare thrown into the front part of the furnace so that the fire, being\r\ndriven back by it, may also smelt the ore and the sows that form round\r\nabout the nozzles of the bellows. This process of smelting is very\r\nancient among the Tyrolese[18], but not so old among the Bohemians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 387 (Blast Furnaces): A, B--Two furnaces.

N--Ladle.]\r\n\r\nThe second method of smelting ores stands in a measure midway between\r\nthat one performed in a furnace of which the tap-hole is closed\r\nintermittently, and the first of the methods performed in a furnace\r\nwhere the tap-hole is always open. In this manner are smelted the ores\r\nof gold and silver that are neither very rich nor very poor, but\r\nmediocre, which fuse easily and are readily absorbed by the lead. It was\r\nfound that in this way a large quantity of ore could be smelted at one\r\noperation without much labour or great expense, and could thus be\r\nalloyed with lead. This furnace has two crucibles, one of which is half\r\ninside the furnace and half outside, so that the lead being put into\r\nthis crucible, the part of the lead which is in the furnace absorbs the\r\nmetals of the ores which easily fuse; the other crucible is lower, and\r\nthe alloy and the molten pyrites run into it. Those who make use of this\r\nmethod of smelting, tap the alloy of gold or silver with lead from the\r\nupper crucible once or twice if need be, and throw in other lead or\r\nlitharge, and each absorbs that flux which is nearest. This method of\r\nsmelting is in use in Styria[19].\r\n\r\n[Illustration 389 (Furnaces): A, B--Two furnaces. C--Tap-holes of\r\nfurnaces. D--Forehearths. E--Their tap-holes. F--Dipping-pots.

K--Barrow on which is a box\r\nmade of wicker work in which the coals are measured. L--Iron spade.]\r\n\r\nThe furnace in the third method of smelting ores has the tap-hole\r\nlikewise open, but the furnace is higher and wider than the others, and\r\nits bellows are larger; for these reasons a larger charge of the ore can\r\nbe thrown into it. When the mines yield a great abundance of ore for the\r\nsmelter, they smelt in the same furnace continuously for three days and\r\nthree nights, providing there be no defect either in the hearth or in\r\nthe forehearth. In this kind of a furnace almost every kind of accretion\r\nwill be found. The forehearth of the furnace is not unlike the\r\nforehearth of the first furnace of all, except that it has a tap-hole.\r\nHowever, because large charges of ore are smelted uninterruptedly, and\r\nthe melted material runs out and the slags are skimmed off, there is\r\nneed for a second forehearth crucible, into which the molten material\r\nruns through an opened tap-hole when the first is full. When a smelter\r\nhas spent twelve hours' labour on this work, another always takes his\r\nplace. The ores of copper and lead and the poorest ores of gold and\r\nsilver are smelted by this method, because they cannot be smelted by the\r\nother three methods on account of the greater expense occasioned. Yet by\r\nthis method a _centumpondium_ of ore containing only one or two\r\n_drachmae_ of gold, or only a half to one _uncia_, of silver,[20] can be\r\nsmelted; because there is a large amount of ore in each charge, smelting\r\nis continuous, and without expensive fluxes such as lead, litharge, and\r\nhearth-lead. In this method of smelting we must use only cupriferous\r\npyrites which easily melt in the fire, in truth the cakes melted out\r\nfrom this, if they no longer absorb much gold or silver, are\r\nreplenished again from crude pyrites alone. If from this poor ore, with\r\nmelted pyrites alone, material for cakes cannot be made, there are added\r\nother fluxes which have not previously been melted. These fluxes are,\r\nnamely, lead ore, stones easily fused by fire of the second order and\r\nsand made from them, limestone, _tophus_, white schist, and iron\r\nstone[21].\r\n\r\nAlthough this method of smelting ores is rough and might not seem to be\r\nof great use, yet it is clever and useful; for a great weight of ores,\r\nin which the gold, silver, or copper are in small quantities, may be\r\nreduced into a few cakes containing all the metal. If on being first\r\nmelted they are too crude to be suitable for the second melting, in\r\nwhich the lead absorbs the precious metals that are in the cakes, or in\r\nwhich the copper is melted out of them, yet they can be made suitable if\r\nthey are repeatedly roasted, sometimes as often as seven or eight times,\r\nas I have explained in the last book. Smelters of this kind are so\r\nclever and expert, that in smelting they take out all the gold and\r\nsilver which the assayer in assaying the ores has stated to be contained\r\nin them, because if during the first operation, when he makes the cakes,\r\nthere is a _drachma_ of gold or half an _uncia_ of silver lost from the\r\nores, the smelter obtains it from the slags by the second smelting. This\r\nmethod of smelting ores is old and very common to most of those who use\r\nother methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 393 (Lead smelting Furnaces): A--Furnace of the Carni.\r\nB--Low wall. C--Wood.

T--Crucibles.\r\nV--Polish hearth.]\r\n\r\nAlthough lead ores are usually smelted in the third furnace--whose\r\ntap-hole is always open,--yet not a few people melt them in special\r\nfurnaces by a method which I will briefly explain. The _Carni_[22] first\r\nburn such lead ores, and afterward break and crush them with large round\r\nmallets. Between the two low walls of a hearth, which is inside a\r\nfurnace made of and vaulted with a rock that resists injury by the fire\r\nand does not burn into chalk, they place green wood with a layer of dry\r\nwood on the top of it; then they throw the ore on to this, and when the\r\nwood is kindled the lead drips down and runs on to the underlying\r\nsloping hearth[23]. This hearth is made of pulverised charcoal and\r\nearth, as is also a large crucible, one-half of which lies under the\r\nfurnace and the other half outside it, into which runs the lead. The\r\nsmelter, having first skimmed off the slags and other things with a hoe,\r\npours the lead with a ladle into moulds, taking out the cakes after they\r\nhave cooled. At the back of the furnace is a rectangular hole, so that\r\nthe fire may be allowed more draught, and so that the smelter can crawl\r\nthrough it into the furnace if necessity demands.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons who inhabit Gittelde, when smelting lead ore in a furnace not\r\nunlike a baking oven, put the wood in through a hole at the back of the\r\nfurnace, and when it begins to burn vigorously the lead trickles out of\r\nthe ore into a forehearth. When this is full, the smelting being\r\naccomplished, the tap-hole is opened with a bar, and in this way the\r\nlead, together with the slags, runs into the dipping-pots below.\r\nAfterward the cakes of lead, when they are cold, are taken from the\r\nmoulds.\r\n\r\nIn Westphalia they heap up ten wagon-loads of charcoal on some hillside\r\nwhich adjoins a level place, and the top of the heap being made flat,\r\nstraw is thrown upon it to the thickness of three or four digits. On the\r\ntop of this is laid as much pure lead ore as the heap can bear; then\r\nthe charcoal is kindled, and when the wind blows, it fans the fire so\r\nthat the ore is smelted. In this wise the lead, trickling down from the\r\nheap, flows on to the level and forms broad thin slabs. A few hundred\r\npounds of lead ore are kept at hand, which, if things go well, are\r\nscattered over the heap. These broad slabs are impure and are laid upon\r\ndry wood which in turn is placed on green wood laid over a large\r\ncrucible, and the former having been kindled, the lead is re-melted.\r\n\r\nThe Poles use a hearth of bricks four feet high, sloping on both sides\r\nand plastered with lute. On the upper level part of the hearth large\r\npieces of wood are piled, and on these is placed small wood with lute\r\nput in between; over the top are laid wood shavings, and upon these\r\nagain pure lead ore covered with large pieces of wood. When these are\r\nkindled, the ore melts and runs down on to the lower layer of wood;\r\nand when this is consumed by the fire, the metal is collected. If\r\nnecessity demand, it is melted over and over again in the same manner,\r\nbut it is finally melted by means of wood laid over the large crucible,\r\nthe slabs of lead being placed upon it.\r\n\r\nThe concentrates from washing are smelted together with slags (fluxes?)\r\nin a third furnace, of which the tap-hole is always open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 395 (Blast Furnaces): A--Furnaces. B--Vaulted roof.\r\nC--Columns. D--Dust-chamber. E--Opening. F--Chimney. G--Window. H--Door.\r\nI--Chute.]\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to build vaulted dust-chambers over the furnaces,\r\nespecially over those in which the precious ores are to be smelted, in\r\norder that the thicker part of the fumes, in which metals are not\r\nwanting, may be caught and saved. In this way two or more furnaces are\r\ncombined under the same vaulted ceiling, which is supported by the wall,\r\nagainst which the furnaces are built, and by four columns. Under this\r\nthe smelters of the ore perform their work. There are two openings\r\nthrough which the fumes rise from the furnaces into the wide vaulted\r\nchamber, and the wider this is the more fumes it collects; in the middle\r\nof this chamber over the arch is an opening three palms high and two\r\nwide. This catches the fumes of both furnaces, which have risen up from\r\nboth sides of the vaulted chamber to its arch, and have fallen again\r\nbecause they could not force their way out; and they thus pass out\r\nthrough the opening mentioned, into the chimney which the Greeks call\r\n[Greek: kapnodoche], the name being taken from the object. The chimney\r\nhas thin iron plates fastened into the walls, to which the thinner\r\nmetallic substances adhere when ascending with the fumes. The thicker\r\nmetallic substances, or _cadmia_,[25] adhere to the vaulted chamber, and\r\noften harden into stalactites. On one side of the chamber is a window in\r\nwhich are set panes of glass, so that the light may be transmitted, but\r\nthe fumes kept in; on the other side is a door, which is kept entirely\r\nclosed while the ores are being smelted in the furnaces, so that none of\r\nthe fumes may escape. It is opened in order that the workman, passing\r\nthrough it, may be enabled to enter the chamber and remove the soot and\r\n_pompholyx_[26] and chip off the _cadmia_; this sweeping is done twice\r\na year. The soot mixed with _pompholyx_ and the _cadmia_, being chipped\r\noff, is thrown down through a long chute made of four boards joined in\r\nthe shape of a rectangle, that they should not fly away. They fall on to\r\nthe floor, and are sprinkled with salt water, and are again smelted with\r\nore and litharge, and become an emolument to the proprietors. Such\r\nchambers, which catch the metallic substances that rise with the fumes,\r\nare profitable for all metalliferous ores; but especially for the minute\r\nmetallic particles collected by washing crushed ores and rock, because\r\nthese usually fly out with the fire of the furnaces.\r\n\r\nI have explained the four general methods of smelting ores; now I will\r\nstate how the ores of each metal are smelted, or how the metal is\r\nobtained from the ore. I will begin with gold. Its sand, the\r\nconcentrates from washing, or the gold dust collected in any other\r\nmanner, should very often not be smelted, but should be mixed with\r\nquicksilver and washed with tepid water, so that all the impurities may\r\nbe eliminated. This method I explained in Book VII. Or they are placed\r\nin the _aqua_ which separates gold from silver, for this also separates\r\nits impurities. In this method we see the gold sink in the glass\r\nampulla, and after all the _aqua_ has been drained from the particles,\r\nit frequently remains as a gold-coloured residue at the bottom; this\r\npowder, when it has been moistened with oil made from argol[27], is then\r\ndried and placed in a crucible, where it is melted with borax or with\r\nsaltpetre and salt; or the same very fine dust is thrown into molten\r\nsilver, which absorbs it, and from this it is again parted by _aqua\r\nvalens_[28].\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to smelt gold ore either outside the blast furnace in a\r\ncrucible, or inside the blast furnace; in the former case a small charge\r\nof ore is used, in the latter a large charge of it. _Rudis_ gold, of\r\nwhatever colour it is, is crushed with a _libra_ each of sulphur and\r\nsalt, a third of a _libra_ of copper, and a quarter of a _libra_ of\r\nargol; they should be melted in a crucible on a slow fire for three\r\nhours, then the alloy is put into molten silver that it may melt more\r\nrapidly. Or a _libra_ of the same crude gold, crushed up, is mixed\r\ntogether with half a _libra_ of _stibium_ likewise crushed, and put into\r\na crucible with half an _uncia_ of copper filings, and heated until they\r\nmelt, then a sixth part of granulated lead is thrown into the same\r\ncrucible. As soon as the mixture emits an odour, iron-filings are added\r\nto it, or if these are not at hand, iron hammer-scales, for both of\r\nthese break the strength of the _stibium_. When the fire consumes it,\r\nnot alone with it is some strength of the _stibium_ consumed, but some\r\nparticles of gold and also of silver, if it be mixed with the gold[29].\r\nWhen the button has been taken out of the crucible and cooled, it is\r\nmelted in a cupel, first until the antimony is exhaled, and thereafter\r\nuntil the lead is separated from it.\r\n\r\nCrushed pyrites which contains gold is smelted in the same way; it and\r\nthe _stibium_ should be of equal weight and in truth the gold may be\r\nmade from them in a number of different ways[30]. One part of crushed\r\nmaterial is mixed with six parts of copper, one part of sulphur, half a\r\npart of salt, and they are all placed in a pot and over them is poured\r\nwine distilled by heating liquid argol in an ampulla. The pot is covered\r\nand smeared over with lute and is put in a hot place, so that the\r\nmixture moistened with wine may dry for the space of six days, then it\r\nis heated for three hours over a gentle fire that it may combine more\r\nrapidly with the lead. Finally it is put into a cupel and the gold is\r\nseparated from the lead[31].\r\n\r\nOr else one _libra_ of the concentrates from washing pyrites, or other\r\nstones to which gold adheres, is mixed with half a _libra_ of salt, half\r\na _libra_ of argol, a third of a _libra_ of glass-galls, a sixth of a\r\n_libra_ of gold or silver slags, and a _sicilicus_ of copper. The\r\ncrucible into which these are put, after it has been covered with a lid,\r\nis sealed with lute and placed in a small furnace that is provided with\r\nsmall holes through which the air is drawn in, and then it is heated\r\nuntil it turns red and the substances put in have alloyed; this should\r\ntake place within four or five hours. The alloy having cooled, it is\r\nagain crushed to powder and a pound of litharge is added to it; then it\r\nis heated again in another crucible until it melts. The button is taken\r\nout, purged of slag, and placed in a cupel, where the gold is separated\r\nfrom the lead.\r\n\r\nOr to a _libra_ of the powder prepared from such metalliferous\r\nconcentrates, is added a _libra_ each of salt, of saltpetre, of argol,\r\nand of glass-galls, and it is heated until it melts. When cooled and\r\ncrushed, it is washed, then to it is added a _libra_ of silver, a third\r\nof copper filings, a sixth of litharge, and it is likewise heated again\r\nuntil it melts. After the button has been purged of slag, it is put into\r\nthe cupel, and the gold and silver are separated from the lead; the gold\r\nis parted from the silver with _aqua valens_. Or else a _libra_ of the\r\npowder prepared from such metalliferous concentrates, a quarter of a\r\n_libra_ of copper filings, and two _librae_ of that second powder[32]\r\nwhich fuses ores, are heated until they melt. The mixture when cooled is\r\nagain reduced to powder, roasted and washed, and in this manner a blue\r\npowder is obtained. Of this, and silver, and that second powder which\r\nfuses ores, a _libra_ each are taken, together with three _librae_ of\r\nlead, and a quarter of a _libra_ of copper, and they are heated together\r\nuntil they melt; then the button is treated as before. Or else a _libra_\r\nof the powder prepared from such metalliferous concentrates, half a\r\n_libra_ of saltpetre, and a quarter of a _libra_ of salt are heated\r\nuntil they melt. The alloy when cooled is again crushed to powder, one\r\n_libra_ of which is absorbed by four pounds of molten silver. Or else a\r\n_libra_ of the powder made from that kind of concentrates, together with\r\na _libra_ of sulphur, a _libra_ and a half of salt, a third of a _libra_\r\nof salt made from argol, and a third of a _libra_ of copper resolved\r\ninto powder with sulphur, are heated until they melt. Afterward the lead\r\nis re-melted, and the gold is separated from the other metals. Or else a\r\n_libra_ of the powder of this kind of concentrates, together with two\r\n_librae_ of salt, half a _libra_ of sulphur, and one _libra_ of\r\nlitharge, are heated, and from these the gold is melted out. By these\r\nand similar methods concentrates containing gold, if there be a small\r\nquantity of them or if they are very rich, can be smelted outside the\r\nblast furnace.\r\n\r\nIf there be much of them and they are poor, then they are smelted in the\r\nblast furnace, especially the ore which is not crushed to powder, and\r\nparticularly when the gold mines yield an abundance of it[33]. The gold\r\nconcentrates mixed with litharge and hearth-lead, to which are added\r\niron-scales, are smelted in the blast furnace whose tap-hole is\r\nintermittently closed, or else in the first or the second furnaces in\r\nwhich the tap-hole is always open. In this manner an alloy of gold and\r\nlead is obtained which is put into the cupellation furnace. Two parts of\r\nroasted pyrites or _cadmia_ which contain gold, are put with one part of\r\nunroasted, and are smelted together in the third furnace whose tap-hole\r\nis always open, and are made into cakes. When these cakes have been\r\nrepeatedly roasted, they are re-smelted in the furnace whose tap-hole is\r\ntemporarily closed, or in one of the two others whose tap-holes are\r\nalways open. In this manner the lead absorbs the gold, whether pure or\r\nargentiferous or cupriferous, and the alloy is taken to the cupellation\r\nfurnace. Pyrites, or other gold ore which is mixed with much material\r\nthat is consumed by fire and flies out of the furnace, is melted with\r\nstone from which iron is melted, if this is at hand. Six parts of such\r\npyrites, or of gold ore reduced to powder and sifted, four of stone from\r\nwhich iron is made, likewise crushed, and three of slaked lime, are\r\nmixed together and moistened with water; to these are added two and a\r\nhalf parts of the cakes which contain some copper, together with one and\r\na half parts of slag. A basketful of fragments of the cakes is thrown\r\ninto the furnace, then the mixture of other things, and then the slag.\r\nNow when the middle part of the forehearth is filled with the molten\r\nmaterial which runs down from the furnace, the slags are first skimmed\r\noff, and then the cakes made of pyrites; afterward the alloy of copper,\r\ngold and silver, which settles at the bottom, is taken out. The cakes\r\nare gently roasted and re-smelted with lead, and made into cakes, which\r\nare carried to other works. The alloy of copper, gold, and silver is not\r\nroasted, but is re-melted again in a crucible with an equal portion of\r\nlead. Cakes are also made much richer in copper and gold than those I\r\nspoke of. In order that the alloy of gold and silver may be made\r\nricher, to eighteen _librae_ of it are added forty-eight _librae_ of\r\ncrude ore, three _librae_ of the stone from which iron is made, and\r\nthree-quarters of a _libra_ of the cakes made from pyrites, and mixed\r\nwith lead, all are heated together in the crucible until they melt. When\r\nthe slag and the cakes melted from pyrites have been skimmed off, the\r\nalloy is carried to other furnaces.\r\n\r\nThere now follows silver, of which the native silver or the lumps of\r\n_rudis_ silver[34] obtained from the mines are not smelted in the blast\r\nfurnaces, but in small iron pans, of which I will speak at the proper\r\nplace; these lumps are heated and thrown into molten silver-lead alloy\r\nin the cupellation furnace when the silver is being separated from the\r\nlead, and refined. The tiny flakes or tiny lumps of silver adhering to\r\nstones or marble or rocks, or again the same little lumps mixed with\r\nearth, or silver not pure enough, should be smelted in the furnace of\r\nwhich the tap-hole is only closed for a short time, together with cakes\r\nmelted from pyrites, with silver slags, and with stones which easily\r\nfuse in fire of the second order.\r\n\r\nIn order that particles of silver should not fly away[35] from the lumps\r\nof ore consisting of minute threads of pure silver and twigs of native\r\nsilver, they are enclosed in a pot, and are placed in the same furnace\r\nwhere the rest of the silver ores are being smelted. Some people smelt\r\nlumps of native silver not sufficiently pure, in pots or triangular\r\ncrucibles, whose lids are sealed with lute. They do not place these pots\r\nin the blast furnace, but arrange them in the assay furnace into which\r\nthe draught of the air blows through small holes. To one part of the\r\nnative silver they add three parts of powdered litharge, as many parts\r\nof hearth-lead, half a part of galena[36], and a small quantity of salt\r\nand iron-scales. The alloy which settles at the bottom of the other\r\nsubstances in the pot is carried to the cupellation furnace, and the\r\nslags are re-melted with the other silver slags. They crush under the\r\nstamps and wash the pots or crucibles to which silver-lead alloy or\r\nslags adhere, and having collected the concentrates they smelt them\r\ntogether with the slags. This method of smelting _rudis_ silver, if\r\nthere is a small quantity of it, is the best, because the smallest\r\nportion of silver does not fly out of the pot or the crucible, and get\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nIf bismuth ore or antimony ore or lead ore[37] contains silver, it is\r\nsmelted with the other ores of silver; likewise galena or pyrites, if\r\nthere is a small amount of it. If there be much galena, whether it\r\ncontain a large or a small amount of silver, it is smelted separately\r\nfrom the others; which process I will explain a little further on.\r\n\r\nBecause lead and copper ores and their metals have much in common with\r\nsilver ores, it is fitting that I should say a great deal concerning\r\nthem, both now and later on. Also in the same manner, pyrites are\r\nsmelted separately if there be much of them. To three parts of roasted\r\nlead or copper ore and one part of crude ore, are added concentrates if\r\nthey were made by washing the same ore, together with slags, and all are\r\nput in the third furnace whose tap-hole is always open. Cakes are made\r\nfrom this charge, which, when they have been quenched with water, are\r\nroasted. Of these roasted cakes generally four parts are again mixed\r\nwith one part of crude pyrites and re-melted in the same furnace. Cakes\r\nare again made from this charge, and if there is a large amount of\r\ncopper in these cakes, copper is made immediately after they have been\r\nroasted and re-melted; if there is little copper in the cakes they are\r\nalso roasted, but they are re-smelted with a little soft slag. In this\r\nmethod the molten lead in the forehearth absorbs the silver. From the\r\npyritic material which floats on the top of the forehearth are made\r\ncakes for the third time, and from them when they have been roasted and\r\nre-smelted is made copper. Similarly, three parts of roasted\r\n_cadmia_[38] in which there is silver, are mixed with one part of crude\r\npyrites, together with slag, and this charge is smelted and cakes are\r\nmade from it; these cakes having been roasted are re-smelted in the same\r\nfurnace. By this method the lead contained in the forehearth absorbs the\r\nsilver, and the silver-lead is taken to the cupellation furnace. Crude\r\nquartz and stones which easily fuse in fire of the third order, together\r\nwith other ores in which there is a small amount of silver, ought to be\r\nmixed with crude roasted pyrites or _cadmia_, because the roasted cakes\r\nof pyrites or _cadmia_ cannot be profitably smelted separately. In a\r\nsimilar manner earths which contain little silver are mixed with the\r\nsame; but if pyrites and _cadmia_ are not available to the smelter, he\r\nsmelts such silver ores and earths with litharge, hearth-lead, slags,\r\nand stones which easily melt in the fire. The concentrates[39]\r\noriginating from the washing of _rudis_ silver, after first being\r\nroasted[40] until they melt, are smelted with mixed litharge and\r\nhearth-lead, or else, after being moistened with water, they are smelted\r\nwith cakes made from pyrites and _cadmia_. By neither of these methods\r\ndo (the concentrates) fall back in the furnace, or fly out of it, driven\r\nby the blast of the bellows and the agitation of the fire. If the\r\nconcentrates originated from galena they are smelted with it after\r\nhaving been roasted; and if from pyrites, then with pyrites.\r\n\r\nPure copper ore, whether it is its own colour or is tinged with\r\nchrysocolla or azure, and copper glance, or grey or black _rudis_\r\ncopper, is smelted in a furnace of which the tap-hole is closed for a\r\nvery short time, or else is always open[41]. If there is a large amount\r\nof silver in the ore it is run into the forehearth, and the greater part\r\nof the silver is absorbed by the molten lead, and the remainder is sold\r\nwith the copper to the proprietor of the works in which silver is parted\r\nfrom copper[42]. If there is a small amount of silver in the ore, no\r\nlead is put into the forehearth to absorb the silver, and the\r\nabove-mentioned proprietors buy it in with the copper; if there be no\r\nsilver, copper is made direct. If such copper ore contains some minerals\r\nwhich do not easily melt, as pyrites or _cadmia metallica fossilis_[43],\r\nor stone from which iron is melted, then crude pyrites which easily fuse\r\nare added to it, together with slag. From this charge, when smelted,\r\nthey make cakes; and from these, when they have been roasted as much as\r\nis necessary and re-smelted, the copper is made. But if there be some\r\nsilver in the cakes, for which an outlay of lead has to be made, then it\r\nis first run into the forehearth, and the molten lead absorbs the\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nIndeed, _rudis_ copper ore of inferior quality, whether ash-coloured or\r\npurple, blackish and occasionally in parts blue, is smelted in the first\r\nfurnace whose tap-hole is always open. This is the method of the\r\nTyrolese. To as much _rudis_ copper ore as will fill eighteen vessels,\r\neach of which holds almost as much as seven Roman _moduli_[44], the\r\nfirst smelter--for there are three--adds three cartloads of lead slags,\r\none cartload of schist, one fifth of a _centumpondium_ of stones which\r\neasily fuse in the fire, besides a small quantity of concentrates\r\ncollected from copper slag and accretions, all of which he smelts for\r\nthe space of twelve hours, and from which he makes six _centumpondia_ of\r\nprimary cakes and one-half of a _centumpondium_ of alloy. One half of\r\nthe latter consists of copper and silver, and it settles to the bottom\r\nof the forehearth. In every _centumpondium_ of the cakes there is half a\r\n_libra_ of silver and sometimes half an _uncia_ besides; in the half of\r\na _centumpondium_ of the alloy there is a _bes_ or three-quarters of\r\nsilver. In this way every week, if the work is for six days, thirty-six\r\n_centumpondia_ of cakes are made and three _centumpondia_ of alloy, in\r\nall of which there is often almost twenty-four _librae_ of silver. The\r\nsecond smelter separates from the primary cakes the greater part of the\r\nsilver by absorbing it in lead. To eighteen _centumpondia_ of cakes made\r\nfrom crude copper ore, he adds twelve _centumpondia_ of hearth-lead and\r\nlitharge, three _centumpondia_ of stones from which lead is smelted,\r\nfive _centumpondia_ of hard cakes rich in silver, and two _centumpondia_\r\nof exhausted liquation cakes[45]; he adds besides, some of the slags\r\nresulting from smelting crude copper, together with a small quantity of\r\nconcentrates made from accretions, all of which he melts for the space\r\nof twelve hours, and makes eighteen _centumpondia_ of secondary cakes,\r\nand twelve _centumpondia_ of copper-lead-silver alloy; in each\r\n_centumpondium_ of the latter there is half a _libra_ of silver. After\r\nhe has taken off the cakes with a hooked bar, he pours the alloy out\r\ninto copper or iron moulds; by this method they make four cakes of\r\nalloy, which are carried to the works in which silver is parted from\r\ncopper. On the following day, the same smelter, taking eighteen\r\n_centumpondia_ of the secondary cakes, again adds twelve _centumpondia_\r\nof hearth-lead and litharge, three _centumpondia_ of stones from which\r\nlead is smelted, five _centumpondia_ of hard cakes rich in silver,\r\ntogether with slags from the smelting of the primary cakes, and with\r\nconcentrates washed from the accretions which are usually made at that\r\ntime. This charge is likewise smelted for the space of twelve hours, and\r\nhe makes as many as thirteen _centumpondia_ of tertiary cakes and eleven\r\n_centumpondia_ of copper-lead-silver alloy, each _centumpondium_ of\r\nwhich contains one-third of a _libra_ and half an _uncia_ of silver.\r\nWhen he has skimmed off the tertiary cakes with a hooked bar, the alloy\r\nis poured into copper moulds, and by this method four cakes of alloy are\r\nmade, which, like the preceding four cakes of alloy, are carried to the\r\nworks in which silver is parted from copper. By this method the second\r\nsmelter makes primary cakes on alternate days and secondary cakes on the\r\nintermediate days. The third smelter takes eleven cartloads of the\r\ntertiary cakes and adds to them three cartloads of hard cakes poor in\r\nsilver, together with the slag from smelting the secondary cakes, and\r\nthe concentrates from the accretions which are usually made at that\r\ntime. From this charge when smelted, he makes twenty _centumpondia_ of\r\nquaternary cakes, which are called \"hard cakes,\" and also fifteen\r\n_centumpondia_ of those \"hard cakes rich in silver,\" each\r\n_centumpondium_ of which contains a third of a _libra_ of silver. These\r\nlatter cakes the second smelter, as I said before, adds to the primary\r\nand secondary cakes when he re-melts them. In the same way, from eleven\r\ncartloads of quaternary cakes thrice roasted, he makes the \"final\"\r\ncakes, of which one _centumpondium_ contains only half an _uncia_ of\r\nsilver. In this operation he also makes fifteen _centumpondia_ of \"hard\r\ncakes poor in silver,\" in each _centumpondium_ of which is a sixth of a\r\n_libra_ of silver. These hard cakes the third smelter, as I have said,\r\nadds to the tertiary cakes when he re-smelts them, while from the\r\n\"final\" cakes, thrice roasted and re-smelted, is made black copper[46].\r\n\r\nThe _rudis_ copper from which pure copper is made, if it contains little\r\nsilver or if it does not easily melt, is first smelted in the third\r\nfurnace of which the tap-hole is always open; and from this are made\r\ncakes, which after being seven times roasted are re-smelted, and from\r\nthese copper is melted out; the cakes of copper are carried to a furnace\r\nof another kind, in which they are melted for the third time, in order\r\nthat in the copper \"bottoms\" there may be more silver, while in the\r\n\"tops\" there may be less, which process is explained in Book XI.\r\n\r\nPyrites, when they contain not only copper, but also silver, are\r\nsmelted in the manner I described when I treated of ores of silver. But\r\nif they are poor in silver, and if the copper which is melted out of\r\nthem cannot easily be treated, they are smelted according to the method\r\nwhich I last explained.\r\n\r\nFinally, the copper schists containing bitumen or sulphur are roasted,\r\nand then smelted with stones which easily fuse in a fire of the second\r\norder, and are made into cakes, on the top of which the slags float.\r\nFrom these cakes, usually roasted seven times and re-melted, are melted\r\nout slags and two kinds of cakes; one kind is of copper and occupies the\r\nbottom of the crucible, and these are sold to the proprietors of the\r\nworks in which silver is parted from copper; the other kind of cakes are\r\nusually re-melted with primary cakes. If the schist contains but a small\r\namount of copper, it is burned, crushed under the stamps, washed and\r\nsieved, and the concentrates obtained from it are melted down; from this\r\nare made cakes from which, when roasted, copper is made. If either\r\nchrysocolla or azure, or yellow or black earth containing copper and\r\nsilver, adheres to the schist, it is not washed, but is crushed and\r\nsmelted with stones which easily fuse in fire of the second order.\r\n\r\nLead ore, whether it be _molybdaena_[47], pyrites, (galena?) or stone\r\nfrom which it is melted, is often smelted in a special furnace, of which\r\nI have spoken above, but no less often in the third furnace of which the\r\ntap-hole is always open. The hearth and forehearth are made from powder\r\ncontaining a small portion of iron hammer-scales; iron slag forms the\r\nprincipal flux for such ores; both of these the expert smelters consider\r\nuseful and to the owner's advantage, because it is the nature of iron to\r\nattract lead. If it is _molybdaena_ or the stone from which lead is\r\nsmelted, then the lead runs down from the furnace into the forehearth,\r\nand when the slags have been skimmed off, the lead is poured out with a\r\nladle. If pyrites are smelted, the first to flow from the furnace into\r\nthe forehearth, as may be seen at Goslar, is a white molten substance,\r\ninjurious and noxious to silver, for it consumes it. For this reason the\r\nslags which float on the top having been skimmed off, this substance is\r\npoured out; or if it hardens, then it is taken out with a hooked bar;\r\nand the walls of the furnace exude the same substance[48]. Then the\r\n_stannum_ runs out of the furnace into the forehearth; this is an alloy\r\nof lead and silver. From the silver-lead alloy they first skim off the\r\nslags, not rarely white, as some pyrites[49] are, and afterward they\r\nskim off the cakes of pyrites, if there are any. In these cakes there is\r\nusually some copper; but since there is usually but a very small\r\nquantity, and as the forest charcoal is not abundant, no copper is made\r\nfrom them. From the silver-lead poured into iron moulds they likewise\r\nmake cakes; when these cakes have been melted in the cupellation\r\nfurnace, the silver is parted from the lead, because part of the lead is\r\ntransformed into litharge and part into hearth-lead, from which in the\r\nblast furnace on re-melting they make de-silverized lead, for in this\r\nlead each _centumpondium_ contains only a _drachma_ of silver, when\r\nbefore the silver was parted from it each _centumpondium_ contained more\r\nor less than three _unciae_ of silver[50].\r\n\r\nThe little black stones[51] and others from which tin is made, are\r\nsmelted in their own kind of furnace, which should be narrower than the\r\nother furnaces, that there may be only the small fire which is necessary\r\nfor this ore. These furnaces are higher, that the height may compensate\r\nfor the narrowness and make them of almost the same capacity as the\r\nother furnaces. At the top, in front, they are closed and on the other\r\nside they are open, where there are steps, because they cannot have the\r\nsteps in front on account of the forehearth; the smelters ascend by\r\nthese steps to put the tin-stone into the furnace. The hearth of the\r\nfurnace is not made of powdered earth and charcoal, but on the floor of\r\nthe works are placed sandstones which are not too hard; these are set on\r\na slight slope, and are two and three-quarters feet long, the same\r\nnumber of feet wide, and two feet thick, for the thicker they are the\r\nlonger they last in the fire. Around them is constructed a rectangular\r\nfurnace eight or nine feet high, of broad sandstones, or of those common\r\nsubstances which by nature are composed of diverse materials[52]. On the\r\ninside the furnace is everywhere evenly covered with lute. The upper\r\npart of the interior is two feet long and one foot wide, but below it is\r\nnot so long and wide. Above it are two hood-walls, between which the\r\nfumes ascend from the furnace into the dust chamber, and through this\r\nthey escape by a narrow opening in the roof. The sandstones are sloped\r\nat the bed of the furnace, so that the tin melted from the tin-stone may\r\nflow through the tap-hole of the furnace into the forehearth.[53]\r\n\r\nAs there is no need for the smelters to have a fierce fire, it is not\r\nnecessary to place the nozzles of the bellows in bronze or iron pipes,\r\nbut only through a hole in the furnace wall. They place the bellows\r\nhigher at the back so that the blast from the nozzles may blow straight\r\ntoward the tap-hole of the furnace. That it may not be too fierce, the\r\nnozzles are wide, for if the fire were fiercer, tin could not be melted\r\nout from the tin-stone, as it would be consumed and turned into ashes.\r\nNear the steps is a hollowed stone, in which is placed the tin-stone to\r\nbe smelted; as often as the smelter throws into the furnace an iron\r\nshovel-ful of this tin-stone, he puts on charcoal that was first put\r\ninto a vat and washed with water to be cleansed from the grit and small\r\nstones which adhere to it, lest they melt at the same time as the\r\ntin-stone and obstruct the tap-hole and impede the flow of tin from the\r\nfurnace. The tap-hole of the furnace is always open; in front of it is a\r\nforehearth a little more than half a foot deep, three-quarters of two\r\nfeet long and one foot wide; this is lined with lute, and the tin from\r\nthe tap-hole flows into it. On one side of the forehearth is a low wall,\r\nthree-quarters of a foot wider and one foot longer than the forehearth,\r\non which lies charcoal powder. On the other side the floor of the\r\nbuilding slopes, so that the slags may conveniently run down and be\r\ncarried away. As soon as the tin begins to run from the tap-hole of the\r\nfurnace into the forehearth, the smelter scrapes down some of the\r\npowdered charcoal into it from the wall, so that the slags may be\r\nseparated from the hot metal, and so that it may be covered, lest any\r\npart of it, being very hot, should fly away with the fumes. If after the\r\nslag has been skimmed off, the powder does not cover up the whole of the\r\ntin, the smelter draws a little more charcoal off the wall with a\r\nscraper. After he has opened the tap-hole of the forehearth with a\r\ntapping-bar, in order that the tin can flow into the tapping-pot,\r\nlikewise smeared with lute, he again closes the tap-hole with pure lute\r\nor lute mixed with powdered charcoal. The smelter, if he be diligent and\r\nexperienced, has brooms at hand with which he sweeps down the walls\r\nabove the furnace; to these walls and to the dust chamber minute\r\ntin-stones sometimes adhere with part of the fumes. If he be not\r\nsufficiently experienced in these matters and has melted at the same\r\ntime all of the tin-stone,--which is commonly of three sizes, large,\r\nmedium, and very small,--not a little waste of the proprietor's tin\r\nresults; because, before the large or the medium sizes have melted, the\r\nsmall have either been burnt up in the furnace, or else, flying up from\r\nit, they not only adhere to the walls but also fall in the dust chamber.\r\nThe owner of the works has the sweepings by right from the owner of the\r\nore. For the above reasons the most experienced smelter melts them down\r\nseparately; indeed, he melts the very small size in a wider furnace, the\r\nmedium in a medium-sized furnace, and the largest size in the narrowest\r\nfurnace. When he melts down the small size he uses a gentle blast from\r\nthe bellows, with the medium-sized a moderate one, with the large size a\r\nviolent blast; and when he smelts the first size he needs a slow fire,\r\nfor the second a medium one, and for the third a fierce one; yet he uses\r\na much less fierce fire than when he smelts the ores of gold, silver, or\r\ncopper. When the workmen have spent three consecutive days and nights in\r\nthis work, as is usual, they have finished their labours; in this time\r\nthey are able to melt out a large weight of small sized tin-stone which\r\nmelts quickly, but less of the large ones which melt slowly, and a\r\nmoderate quantity of the medium-sized which holds the middle course.\r\nThose who do not smelt the tin-stone in furnaces made sometimes wide,\r\nsometimes medium, or sometimes narrow, in order that great loss should\r\nnot be occasioned, throw in first the smallest size, then the medium,\r\nthen the large size, and finally those which are not quite pure; and the\r\nblast of the bellows is altered as required. In order that the tin-stone\r\nthrown into the furnace should not roll off from the large charcoal into\r\nthe forehearth before the tin is melted out of it, the smelter uses\r\nsmall charcoal; first some of this moistened with water is placed in the\r\nfurnace, and then he frequently repeats this succession of charcoal and\r\ntin-stone.\r\n\r\nThe tin-stone, collected from material which during the summer was\r\nwashed in a ditch through which a stream was diverted, and during the\r\nwinter was screened on a perforated iron plate, is smelted in a furnace\r\na palm wider than that in which the fine tin-stone dug out of the earth\r\nis smelted. For the smelting of these, a more vigorous blast of the\r\nbellows and a fiercer fire is needed than for the smelting of the large\r\ntin-stone. Whichever kind of tin-stone is being smelted, if the tin\r\nfirst flows from the furnace, much of it is made, and if slags first\r\nflow from the furnace, then only a little. It happens that the tin-stone\r\nis mixed with the slags when it is either less pure or ferruginous--that\r\nis, not enough roasted--and is imperfect when put into the furnace, or\r\nwhen it has been put in in a larger quantity than was necessary; then,\r\nalthough it may be pure and melt easily, the ore either runs out of the\r\nfurnace at the same time, mixed with the slags, or else it settles so\r\nfirmly at the bottom of the furnace that the operation of smelting being\r\nnecessarily interrupted, the furnace freezes up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 415 (Tin smelting Furnaces): A--Furnace.

N--Hammer.]\r\n\r\nThe tap-hole of the forehearth is opened and the tin is diverted into\r\nthe dipping-pot, and as often as the slags flow down the sloping floor\r\nof the building they are skimmed off with a rabble; as soon as the tin\r\nhas run out of the forehearth, the tap-hole is again closed up with lute\r\nmixed with powdered charcoal. Glowing coals are put in the dipping-pot\r\nso that the tin, after it has run out, should not get chilled. If the\r\nmetal is so impure that nothing can be made from it, the material which\r\nhas run out is made into cakes to be re-smelted in the hearth, of which\r\nI shall have something to say later; if the metal is pure, it is poured\r\nimmediately upon thick copper plates, at first in straight lines and\r\nthen transversely over these to make a lattice. Each of these lattice\r\nbars is impressed with an iron die; if the tin was melted out of ore\r\nexcavated from mines, then one stamp only, namely, that of the\r\nMagistrate, is usually imprinted, but if it is made from tin-stone\r\ncollected on the ground after washing, then it is impressed with two\r\nseals, one the Magistrate's and the other a fork which the washers use.\r\nGenerally, three of this kind of lattice bars are beaten and amalgamated\r\ninto one mass with a wooden mallet.\r\n\r\nThe slags that are skimmed off are afterward thrown with an iron shovel\r\ninto a small trough hollowed from a tree, and are cleansed from\r\ncharcoal by agitation; when taken out they are broken up with a square\r\niron mallet, and then they are re-melted with the fine tin-stone next\r\nsmelted. There are some who crush the slags three times under wet stamps\r\nand re-melt them three times; if a large quantity of this be smelted\r\nwhile still wet, little tin is melted from it, because the slag, soon\r\nmelted again, flows from the furnace into the forehearth. Under the wet\r\nstamps are also crushed the lute and broken rock with which such\r\nfurnaces are lined, and also the accretions, which often contain fine\r\ntin-stone, either not melted or half-melted, and also prills of tin. The\r\ntin-stone not yet melted runs out through the screen into a trough, and\r\nis washed in the same way as tin-stone, while the partly melted and the\r\nprills of tin are taken from the mortar-box and washed in the sieve on\r\nwhich not very minute particles remain, and thence to the canvas strake.\r\nThe soot which adheres to that part of the chimney which emits the\r\nsmoke, also often contains very fine tin-stone which flies from the\r\nfurnace with the fumes, and this is washed in the strake which I have\r\njust mentioned, and in other sluices. The prills of tin and the partly\r\nmelted tin-stone that are contained in the lute and broken rock with\r\nwhich the furnace is lined, and in the remnants of the tin from the\r\nforehearth and the dipping-pot, are smelted together with the tin-stone.\r\n\r\nWhen tin-stone has been smelted for three days and as many nights in a\r\nfurnace prepared as I have said above, some little particles of the rock\r\nfrom which the furnace is constructed become loosened by the fire and\r\nfall down; and then the bellows being taken away, the furnace is broken\r\nthrough at the back, and the accretions are first chipped off with\r\nhammers, and afterward the whole of the interior of the furnace is\r\nre-fitted with the prepared sandstone, and again evenly lined with lute.\r\nThe sandstone placed on the bed of the furnace, if it has become faulty,\r\nis taken out, and another is laid down in its place; those rocks which\r\nare too large the smelter chips off and fits with a sharp pick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 417 (Tin smelting Furnaces): A--Furnaces.

I--Tub in which the coals are washed.]\r\n\r\nSome build two furnaces against the wall just like those I have\r\ndescribed, and above them build a vaulted ceiling supported by the wall\r\nand by four pillars. Through holes in the vaulted ceiling the fumes from\r\nthe furnaces ascend into a dust chamber, similar to the one described\r\nbefore, except that there is a window on each side and there is no door.\r\nThe smelters, when they have to clear away the flue-dust, mount by the\r\nsteps at the side of the furnaces, and climb by ladders into the dust\r\nchamber through the apertures in the vaulted ceilings over the furnaces.\r\nThey then remove the flue-dust from everywhere and collect it in\r\nbaskets, which are passed from one to the other and emptied. This dust\r\nchamber differs from the other described, in the fact that the chimneys,\r\nof which it has two, are not dissimilar to those of a house; they\r\nreceive the fumes which, being unable to escape through the upper part\r\nof the chamber, are turned back and re-ascend and release the tin; thus\r\nthe tin set free by the fire and turned to ash, and the little\r\ntin-stones which fly up with the fumes, remain in the dust chamber or\r\nelse adhere to copper plates in the chimney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 418 (Refining Tin): A--Hearths.

L--Shovel.]\r\n\r\nIf the tin is so impure that it cracks when struck with the hammer, it\r\nis not immediately made into lattice-like bars, but into the cakes which\r\nI have spoken of before, and these are refined by melting again on a\r\nhearth. This hearth consists of sandstones, which slope toward the\r\ncentre and a little toward a dipping-pot; at their joints they are\r\ncovered with lute. Dry logs are arranged on each side, alternately\r\nupright and lengthwise, and more closely in the middle; on this wood are\r\nplaced five or six cakes of tin which all together weigh about six\r\n_centumpondia_; the wood having been kindled, the tin drips down and\r\nflows continuously into the dipping-pot which is on the floor. The\r\nimpure tin sinks to the bottom of this dipping-pot and the pure tin\r\nfloats on the top; then both are ladled out by the master, who first\r\ntakes out the pure tin, and by pouring it over thick plates of copper\r\nmakes lattice-like bars. Afterward he takes out the impure tin from\r\nwhich he makes cakes; he discriminates between them, when he ladles and\r\npours, by the ease or difficulty of the flow. One _centumpondium_ of the\r\nlattice-like bars sells for more than a _centumpondium_ of cakes, for\r\nthe price of the former exceeds the price of the latter by a gold\r\ncoin[54]. These lattice-like bars are lighter than the others, and when\r\nfive of them are pounded and amalgamated with a wooden mallet, a mass is\r\nmade which is stamped with an iron die. There are some who do not make a\r\ndipping-pot on the floor for the tin to run into, but in the hearth\r\nitself; out of this the master, having removed the charcoal, ladles the\r\ntin and pours it over the copper-plate. The dross which adheres to the\r\nwood and the charcoal, having been collected, is re-smelted in the\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 419 (Blast Furnaces): A--Furnace. B--Bellows. C--Iron\r\nDisc. D--Nozzle. E--Wooden Disc. F--Blow-hole. G--Handle. H--Haft.\r\nI--Hoops. K--Masses of tin.]\r\n\r\nSome of the Lusitanians melt tin from tin-stone in small furnaces. They\r\nuse round bellows made of leather, of which the fore end is a round iron\r\ndisc and the rear end a disc of wood; in a hole in the former is fixed\r\nthe nozzle, in the middle of the latter the blow-hole. Above this is the\r\nhandle or haft, which draws open the round bellows and lets in the air,\r\nor compresses it and drives the air out. Between the discs are several\r\niron hoops to which the leather is fastened, making such folds as are to\r\nbe seen in paper lanterns that are folded together. Since this kind of\r\nbellows does not give a vigorous blast, because they are drawn apart and\r\ncompressed slowly, the smelter is not able during a whole day to smelt\r\nmuch more than half a _centumpondium_ of tin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 422 (Iron smelting Furnaces): A--Hearth. B--Heap.\r\nC--Slag-vent. D--Iron mass. E--Wooden mallets. F--Hammer. G--Anvil.]\r\n\r\nVery good iron ore is smelted[55] in a furnace almost like the\r\ncupellation furnace. The hearth is three and a half feet high, and five\r\nfeet long and wide; in the centre of it is a crucible a foot deep and\r\none and a half feet wide, but it may be deeper or shallower, wider or\r\nnarrower, according to whether more or less ore is to be made into iron.\r\nA certain quantity of iron ore is given to the master, out of which he\r\nmay smelt either much or little iron. He being about to expend his skill\r\nand labour on this matter, first throws charcoal into the crucible, and\r\nsprinkles over it an iron shovel-ful of crushed iron ore mixed with\r\nunslaked lime. Then he repeatedly throws on charcoal and sprinkles it\r\nwith ore, and continues this until he has slowly built up a heap; it\r\nmelts when the charcoal has been kindled and the fire violently\r\nstimulated by the blast of the bellows, which are skilfully fixed in a\r\npipe. He is able to complete this work sometimes in eight hours,\r\nsometimes in ten; and again sometimes in twelve. In order that the heat\r\nof the fire should not burn his face, he covers it entirely with a cap,\r\nin which, however, there are holes through which he may see and breathe.\r\nAt the side of the hearth is a bar which he raises as often as is\r\nnecessary, when the bellows blow too violent a blast, or when he adds\r\nmore ore and charcoal. He also uses the bar to draw off the slags, or to\r\nopen or close the gates of the sluice, through which the waters flow\r\ndown on to the wheel which turns the axle that compresses the bellows.\r\nIn this sensible way, iron is melted out and a mass weighing two or\r\nthree _centumpondia_ may be made, providing the iron ore was rich. When\r\nthis is done the master opens the slag-vent with the tapping-bar, and\r\nwhen all has run out he allows the iron mass to cool. Afterward he and\r\nhis assistant stir the iron with the bar, and then in order to chip off\r\nthe slags which had until then adhered to it, and to condense and\r\nflatten it, they take it down from the furnace to the floor, and beat it\r\nwith large wooden mallets having slender handles five feet long.\r\nThereupon it is immediately placed on the anvil, and repeatedly beaten\r\nby the large iron hammer that is raised by the cams of an axle turned by\r\na water-wheel. Not long afterward it is taken up with tongs and placed\r\nunder the same hammer, and cut up with a sharp iron into four, five, or\r\nsix pieces, according to whether it is large or small. These pieces,\r\nafter they have been re-heated in the blacksmith's forge and again\r\nplaced on the anvil, are shaped by the smith into square bars or into\r\nploughshares or tyres, but mainly into bars. Four, six, or eight of\r\nthese bars weigh one-fifth of a _centumpondium_, and from these they\r\nmake various implements. During the blows from the hammer by which it is\r\nshaped by the smith, a youth pours water with a ladle on to the glowing\r\niron, and this is why the blows make such a loud sound that they may be\r\nheard a long distance from the works. The masses, if they remain and\r\nsettle in the crucible of the furnace in which the iron is smelted,\r\nbecome hard iron which can only be hammered with difficulty, and from\r\nthese they make the iron-shod heads for the stamps, and such-like very\r\nhard articles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 424 (Iron smelting Furnaces): A--Furnace. B--Stairs.\r\nC--Ore. D--Charcoal.]\r\n\r\nBut to iron ore which is cupriferous, or which when heated[56] melts\r\nwith difficulty, it is necessary for us to give a fiercer fire and more\r\nlabour; because not only must we separate the parts of it in which there\r\nis metal from those in which there is no metal, and break it up by dry\r\nstamps, but we must also roast it, so that the other metals and noxious\r\njuices may be exhaled; and we must wash it, so that the lighter parts\r\nmay be separated from it. Such ores are smelted in a furnace similar to\r\nthe blast furnace, but much wider and higher, so that it may hold a\r\ngreat quantity of ore and much charcoal; mounting the stairs at the side\r\nof the furnace, the smelters fill it partly with fragments of ore not\r\nlarger than nuts, and partly with charcoal; and from this kind of ore\r\nonce or twice smelted they make iron which is suitable for re-heating in\r\nthe blacksmith's forge, after it is flattened out with the large iron\r\nhammer and cut into pieces with the sharp iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 425 (Steel making Furnaces): A--Forge. B--Bellows.\r\nC--Tongs. D--Hammer. E--Cold stream.]\r\n\r\nBy skill with fire and fluxes is made that kind of iron from which steel\r\nis made, which the Greeks call [Greek: stomoma]. Iron should be selected\r\nwhich is easy to melt, is hard and malleable. Now although iron may be\r\nsmelted from ore which contains other metals, yet it is then either soft\r\nor brittle; such (iron) must be broken up into small pieces when it is\r\nhot, and then mixed with crushed stone which melts. Then a crucible is\r\nmade in the hearth of the smith's furnace, from the same moistened\r\npowder from which are made the forehearths in front of the furnaces in\r\nwhich ores of gold or silver are smelted; the width of this crucible is\r\nabout one and a half feet and the depth one foot. The bellows are so\r\nplaced that the blast may be blown through the nozzle into the middle of\r\nthe crucible. Then the whole of the crucible is filled with the best\r\ncharcoal, and it is surrounded by fragments of rock to hold in place the\r\npieces of iron and the superimposed charcoal. As soon as all the\r\ncharcoal is kindled and the crucible is glowing, a blast is blown from\r\nthe bellows and the master pours in gradually as much of the mixture of\r\niron and flux as he wishes. Into the middle of this, when it is melted,\r\nhe puts four iron masses each weighing thirty pounds, and heats them for\r\nfive or six hours in a fierce fire; he frequently stirs the melted iron\r\nwith a bar, so that the small pores in each mass absorb the minute\r\nparticles, and these particles by their own strength consume and expand\r\nthe thick particles of the masses, which they render soft and similar to\r\ndough. Afterward the master, aided by his assistant, takes out a mass\r\nwith the tongs and places it on the anvil, where it is pounded by the\r\nhammer which is alternately raised and dropped by means of the\r\nwater-wheel; then, without delay, while it is still hot, he throws it\r\ninto water and tempers it; when it is tempered, he places it again on\r\nthe anvil, and breaks it with a blow from the same hammer. Then at once\r\nexamining the fragments, he decides whether the iron in some part or\r\nother, or as a whole, appears to be dense and changed into steel; if so,\r\nhe seizes one mass after another with the tongs, and taking them out he\r\nbreaks them into pieces. Afterward he heats the mixture up again, and\r\nadds a portion afresh to take the place of that which has been absorbed\r\nby the masses. This restores the energy of that which is left, and the\r\npieces of the masses are again put back into the crucible and made\r\npurer. Each of these, after having been heated, is seized with the\r\ntongs, put under the hammer and shaped into a bar. While they are still\r\nglowing, he at once throws them into the very coldest nearby running\r\nwater, and in this manner, being suddenly condensed, they are changed\r\ninto pure steel, which is much harder and whiter than iron.\r\n\r\nThe ores of the other metals are not smelted in furnaces. Quicksilver\r\nores and also antimony are melted in pots, and bismuth in troughs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 427 (Quicksilver distillation Furnaces): A--Hearth.\r\nB--Poles. C--Hearth without fire in which the pots are placed. D--Rocks.\r\nE--Rows of pots. F--Upper pots. G--Lower pots.]\r\n\r\nI will first speak of quicksilver. This is collected when found in pools\r\nformed from the outpourings of the veins and stringers; it is cleansed\r\nwith vinegar and salt, and then it is poured into canvas or soft\r\nleather, through which, when squeezed and compressed, the quicksilver\r\nruns out into a pot or pan. The ore of quicksilver is reduced in double\r\nor single pots. If in double pots, then the upper one is of a shape not\r\nvery dissimilar to the glass ampullas used by doctors, but they taper\r\ndownward toward the bottom, and the lower ones are little pots similar\r\nto those in which men and women make cheese, but both are larger than\r\nthese; it is necessary to sink the lower pots up to the rims in earth,\r\nsand, or ashes. The ore, broken up into small pieces is put into the\r\nupper pots; these having been entirely closed up with moss, are placed\r\nupside down in the openings of the lower pots, where they are joined\r\nwith lute, lest the quicksilver which takes refuge in them should be\r\nexhaled. There are some who, after the pots have been buried, do not\r\nfear to leave them uncemented, and who boast that they are able to\r\nproduce no less weight of quicksilver than those who do cement them, but\r\nnevertheless cementing with lute is the greatest protection against\r\nexhalation. In this manner seven hundred pairs of pots are set together\r\nin the ground or on a hearth. They must be surrounded on all sides with\r\na mixture consisting of crushed earth and charcoal, in such a way that\r\nthe upper pots protrude to a height of a palm above it. On both sides of\r\nthe hearth rocks are first laid, and upon them poles, across which the\r\nworkmen place other poles transversely; these poles do not touch the\r\npots, nevertheless the fire heats the quicksilver, which fleeing from\r\nthe heat is forced to run down through the moss into the lower pots. If\r\nthe ore is being reduced in the upper pots, it flees from them, wherever\r\nthere is an exit, into the lower pots, but if the ore on the contrary is\r\nput in the lower pots the quicksilver rises into the upper pot or into\r\nthe operculum, which, together with the gourd-shaped vessels, are\r\ncemented to the upper pots.\r\n\r\nThe pots, lest they should become defective, are moulded from the best\r\npotters' clay, for if there are defects the quicksilver flies out in the\r\nfumes. If the fumes give out a very sweet odour it indicates that the\r\nquicksilver is being lost, and since this loosens the teeth, the\r\nsmelters and others standing by, warned of the evil, turn their backs to\r\nthe wind, which drives the fumes in the opposite direction; for this\r\nreason, the building should be open around the front and the sides, and\r\nexposed to the wind. If these pots are made of cast copper they last a\r\nlong time in the fire. This process for reducing the ores of quicksilver\r\nis used by most people.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner the antimony ore,[57] if free from other metals, is\r\nreduced in upper pots which are twice as large as the lower ones. Their\r\nsize, however, depends on the cakes, which have not the same weight\r\neverywhere; for in some places they are made to weigh six _librae_, in\r\nother places ten, and elsewhere twenty. When the smelter has concluded\r\nhis operation, he extinguishes the fire with water, removes the lids\r\nfrom the pots, throws earth mixed with ash around and over them, and\r\nwhen they have cooled, takes out the cakes from the pots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 429 (Quicksilver distillation Furnaces): A--Pots.\r\nB--Opercula. C--Nozzles. D--Gourd-shaped earthenware vessels.]\r\n\r\nOther methods for reducing quicksilver are given below. Big-bellied\r\npots, having been placed in the upper rectangular open part of a\r\nfurnace, are filled with the crushed ore. Each of these pots is covered\r\nwith a lid with a long nozzle--commonly called a _campana_--in the shape\r\nof a bell, and they are cemented. Each of the small earthenware vessels\r\nshaped like a gourd receives two of these nozzles, and these are\r\nlikewise cemented. Dried wood having been placed in the lower part of\r\nthe furnace and kindled, the ore is heated until all the quicksilver has\r\nrisen into the operculum which is over the pot; it then flows from the\r\nnozzle and is caught in the earthenware gourd-shaped vessel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 430 (Quicksilver distillation Furnaces): A--Enclosed\r\nchamber. B--Door. C--Little windows. D--Mouths through the walls.\r\nE--Furnace in the enclosed chamber. F--Pots.]\r\n\r\nOthers build a hollow vaulted chamber, of which the paved floor is made\r\nconcave toward the centre. Inside the thick walls of the chamber are the\r\nfurnaces. The doors through which the wood is put are in the outer part\r\nof the same wall. They place the pots in the furnaces and fill them with\r\ncrushed ore, then they cement the pots and the furnaces on all sides\r\nwith lute, so that none of the vapour may escape from them, and there is\r\nno entrance to the furnaces except through their mouths. Between the\r\ndome and the paved floor they arrange green trees, then they close the\r\ndoor and the little windows, and cover them on all sides with moss and\r\nlute, so that none of the quicksilver can exhale from the chamber. After\r\nthe wood has been kindled the ore is heated, and exudes the\r\nquicksilver; whereupon, impatient with the heat, and liking the cold, it\r\nescapes to the leaves of the trees, which have a cooling power. When the\r\noperation is completed the smelter extinguishes the fire, and when all\r\ngets cool he opens the door and the windows, and collects the\r\nquicksilver, most of which, being heavy, falls of its own accord from\r\nthe trees, and flows into the concave part of the floor; if all should\r\nnot have fallen from the trees, they are shaken to make it fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 431 (Quicksilver distillation Furnaces): A--Larger pot.\r\nB--Smaller. C--Tripod. D--Tub in which the sand is washed.]\r\n\r\nThe following is the fourth method of reducing ores of quicksilver. A\r\nlarger pot standing on a tripod is filled with crushed ore, and over the\r\nore is put sand or ashes to a thickness of two digits, and tamped; then\r\nin the mouth of this pot is inserted the mouth of another smaller pot\r\nand cemented with lute, lest the vapours are emitted. The ore heated by\r\nthe fire exhales the quicksilver, which, penetrating through the sand or\r\nthe ashes, takes refuge in the upper pot, where condensing into drops it\r\nfalls back into the sand or the ashes, from which the quicksilver is\r\nwashed and collected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 432 (Quicksilver distillation Furnaces): A--Pots. B--Lids.\r\nC--Stones. D--Furnace.]\r\n\r\nThe fifth method is not very unlike the fourth. In the place of these\r\npots are set other pots, likewise of earthenware, having a narrow bottom\r\nand a wide mouth. These are nearly filled with crushed ore, which is\r\nlikewise covered with ashes to a depth of two digits and tamped in. The\r\npots are covered with lids a digit thick, and they are smeared over on\r\nthe inside with liquid litharge, and on the lid are placed heavy stones.\r\nThe pots are set on the furnace, and the ore is heated and similarly\r\nexhales quicksilver, which fleeing from the heat takes refuge in the\r\nlid; on congealing there, it falls back into the ashes, from which, when\r\nwashed, the quicksilver is collected.\r\n\r\nBy these five methods quicksilver may be made, and of these not one is\r\nto be despised or repudiated; nevertheless, if the mine supplies a great\r\nabundance of ore, the first is the most expeditious and practical,\r\nbecause a large quantity of ore can be reduced at the same time without\r\ngreat expense.[58]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 434 (Bismuth Smelting): A--Pit across which wood is\r\nplaced. B--Forehearth. C--Ladle. D--Iron mould. E--Cakes. F--Empty pot\r\nlined with stones in layers. G--Troughs. H--Pits dug at the foot of the\r\ntroughs. I--Small wood laid over the troughs. K--Wind.]\r\n\r\nBismuth[59] ore, free from every kind of silver, is smelted by various\r\nmethods. First a small pit is dug in the dry ground; into this\r\npulverised charcoal is thrown and tamped in, and then it is dried with\r\nburning charcoal. Afterward, thick dry pieces of beech wood are placed\r\nover the pit, and the bismuth ore is thrown on it. As soon as the\r\nkindled wood burns, the heated ore drips with bismuth, which runs down\r\ninto the pit, from which when cooled the cakes are removed. Because\r\npieces of burnt wood, or often charcoal and occasionally slag, drop into\r\nthe bismuth which collects in the pit, and make it impure, it is put\r\nback into another kind of crucible to be melted, so that pure cakes may\r\nbe made. There are some who, bearing these things in mind, dig a pit on\r\na sloping place and below it put a forehearth, into which the bismuth\r\ncontinually flows, and thus remains clean; then they take it out with\r\nladles and pour it into iron pans lined inside with lute, and make cakes\r\nof it. They cover such pits with flat stones, whose joints are besmeared\r\nwith a lute of mixed dust and crushed charcoal, lest the joints should\r\nabsorb the molten bismuth. Another method is to put the ore in troughs\r\nmade of fir-wood and placed on sloping ground; they place small firewood\r\nover it, kindling it when a gentle wind blows, and thus the ore is\r\nheated. In this manner the bismuth melts and runs down from the troughs\r\ninto a pit below, while there remains slag, or stones, which are of a\r\nyellow colour, as is also the wood laid across the pit. These are also\r\nsold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 435 (Bismuth Smelting): A--Wood. B--Bricks. C--Pans.\r\nD--Furnace. E--Crucible. F--Pipe. G--Dipping-pot.]\r\n\r\nOthers reduce the ore in iron pans as next described. They lay small\r\npieces of dry wood alternately straight and transversely upon bricks,\r\none and a half feet apart, and set fire to it. Near it they put small\r\niron pans lined on the inside with lute, and full of broken ore; then\r\nwhen the wind blows the flame of the fierce fire over the pans, the\r\nbismuth drips out of the ore; wherefore, in order that it may run, the\r\nore is stirred with the tongs; but when they decide that all the bismuth\r\nis exuded, they seize the pans with the tongs and remove them, and pour\r\nout the bismuth into empty pans, and by turning many into one they make\r\ncakes. Others reduce the ore, when it is not mixed with _cadmia_,[60] in\r\na furnace similar to the iron furnace. In this case they make a pit and\r\na crucible of crushed earth mixed with pulverised charcoal, and into it\r\nthey put the broken ore, or the concentrates from washing, from which\r\nthey make more bismuth. If they put in ore, they reduce it with charcoal\r\nand small dried wood mixed, and if concentrates, they use charcoal only;\r\nthey blow both materials with a gentle blast from a bellows. From the\r\ncrucible is a small pipe through which the molten bismuth runs down into\r\na dipping-pot, and from this cakes are made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 436 (Bismuth Smelting): A--Hearth in which ore is melted.\r\nB--Hearth on which lie drops of bismuth. C--Tongs. D--Basket. E--Wind.]\r\n\r\nOn a dump thrown up from the mines, other people construct a hearth\r\nexposed to the wind, a foot high, three feet wide, and four and a half\r\nfeet long. It is held together by four boards, and the whole is thickly\r\ncoated at the top with lute. On this hearth they first put small dried\r\nsticks of fir wood, then over them they throw broken ore; then they lay\r\nmore wood over it, and when the wind blows they kindle it. In this\r\nmanner the bismuth drips out of the ore, and afterward the ashes of the\r\nwood consumed by the fire and the charcoals are swept away. The drops of\r\nbismuth which fall down into the hearth are congealed by the cold, and\r\nthey are taken away with the tongs and thrown into a basket. From the\r\nmelted bismuth they make cakes in iron pans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 437 (Bismuth Smelting): A--Box. B--Pivot. C--Transverse\r\nwood beams. D--Grate. E--Its feet. F--Burning wood. G--Stick. H--Pans in\r\nwhich the bismuth is melted. I--Pans for moulds. K--Cakes. L--Fork.\r\nM--Brush.]\r\n\r\nOthers again make a box eight feet long, four feet wide, and two feet\r\nhigh, which they fill almost full of sand and cover with bricks, thus\r\nmaking the hearth. The box has in the centre a wooden pivot, which turns\r\nin a hole in two beams laid transversely one upon the other; these beams\r\nare hard and thick, are sunk into the ground, both ends are perforated,\r\nand through these holes wedge-shaped pegs are driven, in order that the\r\nbeams may remain fixed, and that the box may turn round, and may be\r\nturned toward the wind from whichever quarter of the sky in may blow. In\r\nsuch a hearth they put an iron grate, as long and wide as the box and\r\nthree-quarters of a foot high; it has six feet, and there are so many\r\ntransverse bars that they almost touch one another. On the grate they\r\nlay pine-wood and over it broken ore, and over this they again lay\r\npine-wood. When it has been kindled the ore melts, out of which the\r\nbismuth drips down; since very little wood is burned, this is the most\r\nprofitable method of smelting the bismuth. The bismuth drips through the\r\ngrate on to the hearth, while the other things remain upon the grate\r\nwith the charcoal. When the work is finished, the workman takes a stick\r\nfrom the hearth and overturns the grate, and the things which have been\r\naccumulated on it; with the brush he sweeps up the bismuth and collects\r\nit in a basket, and then he melts it in an iron pan and makes cakes. As\r\nsoon as possible after it is cool, he turns the pans over, so that the\r\ncakes may fall out, using for this purpose a two-pronged fork of which\r\none prong is again forked. And immediately afterward he returns to his\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The history of the fusion of ores and of metals is the history of\r\nindividual processes, and such information as we have been able to\r\ndiscover upon the individual methods previous to Agricola we give on the\r\npages where such processes are discussed. In general the records of the\r\nbeginnings of metallurgy are so nebular that, if one wishes to shirk the\r\ntask, he can adopt the explanation of William Pryce one hundred and\r\nfifty years ago: \"It is very probable that the nature and use of Metals\r\nwere not revealed to Adam in his state of innocence: the toil and labour\r\nnecessary to procure and use those implements of the iron age could not\r\nbe known, till they made part of the curse incurred by his fall: 'In the\r\nsweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the\r\nground; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life'\r\n(Genesis). That they were very early discovered, however, is manifest\r\nfrom the Mosaick account of Tubal Cain, who was the first instructor of\r\nevery artificer in Brass [_sic_] and Iron\" (_Mineralogia Cornubiensis_,\r\np. 2).\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that gold could be found in large enough pieces to\r\nhave had general use in pre-historic times, without fusion; but copper,\r\nwhich was also in use, must have been smelted, and therefore we must\r\nassume a considerable development of human knowledge on the subject\r\nprior to any human record. Such incidental mention as exists after\r\nrecord begins does not, of course, extend to the beginning of any\r\nparticular branch of the art--in fact, special arts obviously existed\r\nlong before such mention, and down to the complete survey of the state\r\nof the art by Agricola our dates are necessarily \"prior to\" some first\r\nmention in literature, or \"prior to\" the known period of existing\r\nremains of metallurgical operations. The scant Egyptian records, the\r\nScriptures, and the Shoo King give a little insight prior to 1000 B.C.\r\nThe more extensive Greek literature of about the 5th to the 3rd\r\ncenturies B.C., together with the remains of Greek mines, furnish\r\nanother datum point of view, and the Roman and Greek writers at the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era give a still larger view. After them our\r\nnext step is to the Monk Theophilus and the Alchemists, from the 12th to\r\nthe 14th centuries. Finally, the awakening of learning at the end of the\r\n15th and the beginning of the 16th centuries, enables us for the first\r\ntime to see practically all that was known. The wealth of literature\r\nwhich exists subsequent to this latter time makes history thereafter a\r\nmatter of some precision, but it is not included in this undertaking.\r\nConsidering the great part that the metals have played in civilization,\r\nit is astonishing what a minute amount of information is available on\r\nmetallurgy. Either the ancient metallurgists were secretive as to their\r\nart, or the ancient authors despised such common things, or, as is\r\nequally probable, the very partial preservation of ancient literature,\r\nby painful transcription over a score of centuries, served only for\r\nthose works of more general interest. In any event, if all the direct or\r\nindirect material on metallurgy prior to the 15th century were compiled,\r\nit would not fill 40 pages such as these.\r\n\r\nIt may be of service to give a tabular summary indicating approximately\r\nthe time when evidence of particular operations appear on the historical\r\nhorizon:\r\n\r\n  Gold washed from alluvial                            Prior to recorded\r\n                                                         civilization\r\n\r\n  Copper reduced from ores by smelting                 Prior to recorded\r\n                                                         civilization\r\n\r\n  Bitumen mined and used                               Prior to recorded\r\n                                                         civilization\r\n\r\n  Tin reduced from ores by smelting                    Prior to 3500 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Bronze made                                          Prior to 3500 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Iron reduced from ores by smelting                   Prior to 3500 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Soda mined and used                                  Prior to 3500 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Gold reduced from ores by concentration              Prior to 2500 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Silver reduced from ores by smelting                 Prior to 2000 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Lead reduced from ores by smelting                   Prior to 2000 B.C.\r\n                                                         (perhaps prior\r\n                                                          to 3500 B.C.)\r\n\r\n  Silver parted from lead by cupellation               Prior to 2000 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Bellows used in furnaces                             Prior to 1500 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Steel produced                                       Prior to 1000 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Base metals separated from ores by water             Prior to 500 B.C.\r\n      concentration\r\n\r\n  Gold refined by cupellation                          Prior to 500 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Sulphide ores smelted for lead                       Prior to 500 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Mercury reduced from ores by (?)

It is possible to set up a description of the\r\nimaginary beginning of the \"bronze age\" prior to recorded civilization,\r\nstarting with the savage who accidentally built a fire on top of some\r\neasily reducible ore, and discovered metal in the ashes, etc.; but as\r\nthis method has been pursued times out of number to no particular\r\npurpose, we will confine ourselves to a summary of such facts as we can\r\nassemble. \"Founders' hoards\" of the bronze age are scattered over\r\nWestern Europe, and indicate that smelting was done in shallow pits with\r\ncharcoal. With the Egyptians we find occasional inscriptions showing\r\nsmall furnaces with forced draught, in early cases with a blow-pipe, but\r\nlater--about 1500 B.C.--with bellows also. The crucible was apparently\r\nused by the Egyptians in secondary melting, such remains at Mt. Sinai\r\nprobably dating before 2000 B.C. With the advent of the Prophets, and\r\nthe first Greek literature--9th to 7th century B.C.--we find frequent\r\nreferences to bellows. The remains of smelting appliances at Mt. Laurion\r\n(500-300 B.C.) do not indicate much advance over the primitive hearth;\r\nhowever, at this locality we do find evidence of the ability to separate\r\nminerals by specific gravity, by washing crushed ore over inclined\r\nsurfaces with a sort of buddle attachment. Stone grinding-mills were\r\nused to crush ore from the earliest times of Mt. Laurion down to the\r\nMiddle Ages. About the beginning of the Christian era the writings of\r\nDiodorus, Strabo, Dioscorides, and Pliny indicate considerable advance\r\nin appliances. Strabo describes high stacks to carry off lead fumes;\r\nDioscorides explains a furnace with a dust-chamber to catch _pompholyx_\r\n(zinc oxide); Pliny refers to the upper and lower crucibles (a\r\nforehearth) and to the pillars and arches of the furnaces. From all of\r\ntheir descriptions we may conclude that the furnaces had then reached\r\nsome size, and were, of course, equipped with bellows. At this time\r\nsulphide copper and lead ores were smelted; but as to fluxes, except\r\nlead for silver, and lead and soda for gold, we have practically no\r\nmention. Charcoal was the universal fuel for smelting down to the 18th\r\ncentury. Both Dioscorides and Pliny describe a distillation apparatus\r\nused to recover quicksilver. A formidable list of mineral products and\r\nmetal alloys in use, indicate in themselves considerable apparatus, of\r\nthe details of which we have no indication; in the main these products\r\nwere lead sulphide, sulphate, and oxide (red-lead and litharge); zinc\r\noxide; iron sulphide, oxide and sulphate; arsenic and antimony\r\nsulphides; mercury sulphide, sulphur, bitumen, soda, alum and potash;\r\nand of the alloys, bronze, brass, pewter, electrum and steel.\r\n\r\nFrom this period to the period of the awakening of learning our only\r\nlight is an occasional gleam from Theophilus and the Alchemists. The\r\nformer gave a more detailed description of metallurgical appliances than\r\nhad been done before, but there is little vital change apparent from the\r\napparatus of Roman times. The Alchemists gave a great stimulus to\r\nindustrial chemistry in the discovery of the mineral acids, and\r\ndescribed distillation apparatus of approximately modern form.\r\n\r\nThe next period--the Renaissance--is one in which our descriptions are\r\nfor the first time satisfactory, and a discussion would be but a review\r\nof _De Re Metallica_.\r\n\r\n[2] See footnote 2, p. 267, on verbs used for roasting.\r\n\r\n[3] Agricola has here either forgotten to take into account his\r\nthree-palm-thick furnace walls, which will make the length of this long\r\nwall sixty-one feet, or else he has included this foot and a half in\r\neach case in the six-foot distance between the furnaces, so that the\r\nactual clear space is only four and a half feet between the furnace with\r\nfour feet on the ends.\r\n\r\n[4] The paucity of terms in Latin for describing structural members, and\r\nthe consequent repetition of \"beam\" (_trabs_), \"timber\" (_tignum_),\r\n\"billet\" (_tigillum_), \"pole\" (_asser_), with such modifications as\r\nsmall, large, and transverse, and with long explanatory clauses showing\r\ntheir location, renders the original very difficult to follow. We have,\r\ntherefore, introduced such terms as \"posts,\" \"tie-beams,\" \"sweeps,\"\r\n\"levers,\" \"rafters,\" \"sills,\" \"moulding,\" \"braces,\" \"cleats,\"\r\n\"supports,\" etc., as the context demands.\r\n\r\n[5] This set of rafters appears to start from the longitudinal beam.\r\n\r\n[6] Devices for creating an air current must be of very old invention,\r\nfor it is impossible to conceive of anything but the crudest melting of\r\na few simple ores without some forced draft. Wilkinson (The Ancient\r\nEgyptians, II, p. 316) gives a copy of an illustration of a foot-bellows\r\nfrom a tomb of the time of Thotmes III. (1500 B.C.). The rest of the\r\nworld therefore, probably obtained them from the Egyptians. They are\r\nmentioned frequently in the Bible, the most pointed reference to\r\nmetallurgical purposes being Jeremiah (VI, 29): \"The bellows are burned,\r\nthe lead is consumed in the fire; the founder melteth in vain; for the\r\nwicked are not plucked away.\" Strabo (VII, 3) states that Ephorus\r\nascribed the invention of bellows to Anacharsis--a Thracian prince of\r\nabout 600 B.C.\r\n\r\n[7] This whole arrangement could be summarized by the word \"hinge.\"\r\n\r\n[8] The rim of this wheel is obviously made of segments fixed in two\r\nlayers; the \"disc\" meaning the aggregate of segments on either side of\r\nthe wheel.\r\n\r\n[9] It has not been considered necessary to introduce the modern term\r\n_twyer_ in these descriptions, as the literal rendering is sufficiently\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n[10] _Ferruminata_. These accretions are practically always near the\r\nhearth, and would correspond to English \"sows,\" and therefore that term\r\nhas been adopted. It will be noted that, like most modern metallurgists,\r\nAgricola offers no method for treating them. Pliny (XXXIV, 37) describes\r\na \"sow,\" and uses the verb _ferruminare_ (to weld or solder): \"Some say\r\nthat in the furnace there are certain masses of stone which become\r\nsoldered together, and that the copper fuses around it, the mass not\r\nbecoming liquid unless it is transferred to another furnace; it thus\r\nforms a sort of knot, as it were, of the metal.\"\r\n\r\n[11] What are known in English as \"crucible,\" \"furnace well,\"\r\n\"forehearth,\" \"dipping-pot,\" \"tapping-pot,\" \"receiving-pot,\" etc., are\r\nin the text all _catinus_, _i.e._, crucible. For easier reading,\r\nhowever, we have assigned the names indicated in the context.\r\n\r\n[12] _Panes ex pyrite conflati_. While the term _matte_ would cover most\r\ncases where this expression appears, and in many cases would be more\r\nexpressive to the modern reader, yet there are instances where the\r\nexpression as it stands indicates its particular origin, and it has\r\nbeen, therefore, considered advisable to adhere to the literal\r\nrendering.\r\n\r\n[13] _Molybdaena_. See note 37, p. 476. It was the saturated furnace\r\nbottoms from cupellation.\r\n\r\n[14] The four elements were earth, air, fire, and water.\r\n\r\n[15] \"Stones which easily melt in the fire.\" Nowhere in _De Re\r\nMetallica_ does the author explain these substances. However in the\r\n_Interpretatio_ (p. 465) he gives three genera or orders with their\r\nGerman equivalents, as follows:--\"_Lapides qui igni liquescunt primi\r\ngeneris,--Schoene fluesse; secundi,--fluesse zum schmeltzen flock quertze;\r\ntertii,--quertze oder kiselstein.\"_ We confess our inability to make\r\ncertain of most of the substances comprised in the first and second\r\norders. We consider they were in part fluor-spar, and in any event the\r\nthird order embraced varieties of quartz, flint, and silicious material\r\ngenerally. As the matter is of importance from a metallurgical point of\r\nview, we reproduce at some length Agricola's own statements on the\r\nsubject from _Bermannus_ and _De Natura Fossilium_. In the latter (p.\r\n268) he states: \"Finally there now remain those stones which I call\r\n'stones which easily melt in the fire,' because when thrown into hot\r\nfurnaces they flow (_fluunt_). There are three orders (_genera_) of\r\nthese. The first resembles the transparent gems; the second is not\r\nsimilar, and is generally not translucent; it is translucent in some\r\npart, and in rare instances altogether translucent. The first is\r\nsparingly found in silver and other mines; the second abounds in veins\r\nof its own. The third genus is the material from which glass is made,\r\nalthough it can also be made out of the other two. The stones of the\r\nfirst order are not only transparent, but are also resplendent, and have\r\nthe colours of gems, for some resemble crystal, others emerald,\r\nheliotrope, lapis lazuli, amethyst, sapphire, ruby, _chrysolithus_,\r\n_morion_ (cairngorm?), and other gems, but they differ from them in\r\nhardness.... To the first genus belongs the _lapis alabandicus_ (modern\r\nalbandite?), if indeed it was different from the alabandic carbuncle. It\r\ncan be melted, according to Pliny, in the fire, and fused for the\r\npreparation of glass. It is black, but verging upon purple. It comes\r\nfrom Caria, near Alabanda, and from Miletus in the same province. The\r\nsecond order of stones does not show a great variety of colours, and\r\nseldom beautiful ones, for it is generally white, whitish, greyish, or\r\nyellowish. Because these (stones) very readily melt in the fire, they\r\nare added to the ores from which the metals are smelted. The small\r\nstones found in veins, veinlets, and the spaces between the veins, of\r\nthe highest peaks of the Sudetic range (_Suditorum montium_), belong\r\npartly to this genus and partly to the first. They differ in size, being\r\nlarge and small; and in shape, some being round or angular or pointed;\r\nin colour they are black or ash-grey, or yellow, or purple, or violet,\r\nor iron colour. All of these are lacking in metals. Neither do the\r\nlittle stones contain any metals which are usually found in the streams\r\nwhere gold dust is collected by washing.... In the rivers where are\r\ncollected the small stones from which tin is smelted, there are three\r\ngenera of small stones to be found, all somewhat rounded and of very\r\nlight weight, and devoid of all metals. The largest are black, both on\r\nthe outside and inside, smooth and brilliant like a mirror; the\r\nmedium-sized are either bluish black or ash-grey; the smallest are of a\r\nyellowish colour, somewhat like a silkworm. But because both the former\r\nand the latter stones are devoid of metals, and fly to pieces under the\r\nblows of the hammer, we classify them as sand or gravel. Glass is made\r\nfrom the stones of the third order, and particularly from sand. For when\r\nthis is thrown into the heated furnace it is melted by the fire.... This\r\nkind of stone is either found in its own veins, which are occasionally\r\nvery wide, or else scattered through the mines. It is less hard than\r\nflint, on account of which no fire can be struck from it. It is not\r\ntransparent, but it is of many colours--that is to say, white,\r\nyellowish, ash-grey, brown, black, green, blue, reddish or red. This\r\ngenus of stones occurs here and there in mountainous regions, on banks\r\nof rivers, and in the fields. Those which are black right through to the\r\ninterior, and not merely on the surface, are more rare; and very\r\nfrequently one coloured vein is intersected by another of a different\r\ncolour--for instance, a white one by a red one; the green is often\r\nspotted with white, the ash-grey with black, the white with crimson.\r\nFragments of these stones are frequently found on the surface of the\r\nearth, and in the running water they become polished by rubbing against\r\nstones of their own or of another genus. In this way, likewise,\r\nfragments of rocks are not infrequently shaped into spherical forms....\r\nThis stone is put to many uses; the streets are paved with it, whatever\r\nits colour; the blue variety is added to the ash of pines for making\r\nthose other ashes which are used by wool-dyers. The white variety is\r\nburned, ground, and sifted, and from this they make the sand out of\r\nwhich glass is made. The whiter the sand is, the more useful it is.\"\r\n\r\nPerusal of the following from _Bermannus_ (p. 458) can leave little\r\ndoubt as to the first or second order being in part fluor-spar. Agricola\r\nderived the name _fluores_ from _fluo_ \"to flow,\" and we in turn obtain\r\n\"fluorite,\" or \"fluorspar,\" from Agricola. \"_Bermannus_.--These stones\r\nare similar to gems, but less hard. Allow me to explain word for word.\r\nOur miners call them _fluores_, not inappropriately to my mind, for by\r\nthe heat of fire, like ice in the sun, they liquefy and flow away. They\r\nare of varied and bright colours. _Naevius_.--Theophrastus says of them\r\nthat they are made by a conflux in the earth. These red _fluores_, to\r\nemploy the words just used by you, are the ruby silver which you showed\r\nus before. _Bermannus_.--At the first glance it appears so, although it\r\nis not infrequently translucent. _Naevius_.--Then they are rubies?\r\n_Bermannus_.--Not that either. _Naevius_.--In what way, then, can they\r\nbe distinguished from rubies? _Bermannus_.--Chiefly by this sign, that\r\nthey glitter more feebly when translucent. Those which are not\r\ntranslucent may be distinguished from rubies. Moreover, _fluores_ of all\r\nkinds melt when they are subject to the first fire; rubies do not melt\r\nin fire. _Naevius_.--You distinguish well. _Bermannus_.--You see the\r\nother kind, of a paler purple colour? _Naevius_.--They appear to be an\r\ninferior kind of amethyst, such as are found in many places in Bohemia.\r\n_Bermannus_.--Indeed, they are not very dissimilar, therefore the common\r\npeople who do not know amethysts well, set them in rings for gems, and\r\nthey are easily sold. The third kind, as you see here, is white.\r\n_Naevius_.--I should have thought it a crystal. _Bermannus_.--A fourth\r\nis a yellow colour, a fifth ash colour, a sixth blackish. Some are\r\nviolet, some green, others gold-coloured. _Anton_.--What is the use of\r\n_fluores_? _Bermannus_.--They are wont to be made use of when metals are\r\nsmelted, as they cause the material in the fire to be much more fluid,\r\nexactly like a kind of stone which we said is made from pyrites (matte);\r\nit is, indeed, made not far from here, at Breitenbrunn, which is near\r\nSchwarzenberg. Moreover, from _fluores_ they can make colours which\r\nartists use.\"\r\n\r\n[16] _Stannum_. (_Interpretatio_,--_werck_, modern _werk_). This term\r\nhas been rendered throughout as \"silver-lead\" or \"silver-lead alloy.\" It\r\nwas the argentiferous lead suitable for cupellation. Agricola, in using\r\nit in this sense, was no doubt following his interpretation of its use\r\nby Pliny. Further remarks upon this subject will be found in note 33, p.\r\n473.\r\n\r\n[17] _Expirare_,--to exhale or blow out.\r\n\r\n[18] _Rhetos_. The ancient Rhaetia comprised not only the greater part\r\nof Tyrol, but also parts of Switzerland and Lombardy. The mining section\r\nwas, however, in Tyrol.\r\n\r\n[19] _Noricum_ was a region south of the Danube, embracing not only\r\nmodern Styria, but also parts of Austria, Salzberg, and Carinthia.\r\n\r\n[20] One _drachma_ of gold to a _centumpondium_ would be (if we assume\r\nthese were Roman weights) 3 ozs. 1 dwt. Troy per short ton. One-half\r\n_uncia_ of silver would be 12 ozs. 3 dwts. per short ton.\r\n\r\n[21] For discussion of these fluxes see note page 232.\r\n\r\n[22] _Carni_. Probably the people of modern Austrian Carniola, which\r\nlies south of Styria and west of Croatia.\r\n\r\n[23] HISTORICAL NOTE ON SMELTING LEAD AND SILVER.--The history of lead\r\nand silver smelting is by no means a sequent array of exact facts. With\r\none possible exception, lead does not appear upon the historical horizon\r\nuntil long after silver, and yet their metallurgy is so inextricably\r\nmixed that neither can be considered wholly by itself. As silver does\r\nnot occur native in any such quantities as would have supplied the\r\namounts possessed by the Ancients, we must, therefore, assume its\r\nreduction by either (1) intricate chemical processes, (2) amalgamation,\r\n(3) reduction with copper, (4) reduction with lead. It is impossible to\r\nconceive of the first with the ancient knowledge of chemistry; the\r\nsecond (see note 12, p. 297) does not appear to have been known until\r\nafter Roman times; in any event, quicksilver appears only at about 400\r\nB.C. The third was impossible, as the parting of silver from copper\r\nwithout lead involves metallurgy only possible during the last century.\r\nTherefore, one is driven to the conclusion that the fourth case\r\nobtained, and that the lead must have been known practically\r\ncontemporaneously with silver. There is a leaden figure exhibited in the\r\nBritish Museum among the articles recovered from the Temple of Osiris at\r\nAbydos, and considered to be of the Archaic period--prior to 3800 B.C.\r\nThe earliest known Egyptian silver appears to be a necklace of beads,\r\nsupposed to be of the XII. Dynasty (2400 B.C.), which is described in\r\nthe 17th Memoir, Egyptian Exploration Fund (London, 1898, p. 22). With\r\nthis exception of the above-mentioned lead specimen, silver articles\r\nantedate positive evidence of lead by nearly a millennium, and if we\r\nassume lead as a necessary factor in silver production, we must conclude\r\nit was known long prior to any direct (except the above solitary\r\npossibility) evidence of lead itself. Further, if we are to conclude its\r\nnecessary association with silver, we must assume a knowledge of\r\ncupellation for the parting of the two metals. Lead is mentioned in 1500\r\nB.C. among the spoil captured by Thotmes III. Leaden objects have\r\nfrequently been found in Egyptian tombs as early as Rameses III. (1200\r\nB.C.). The statement is made by Pulsifer (Notes for a History of Lead,\r\nNew York 1888, p. 146) that Egyptian pottery was glazed with lead. We\r\nhave been unable to find any confirmation of this. It may be noted,\r\nincidentally, that lead is not included in the metals of the \"Tribute of\r\nYue\" in the Shoo King (The Chinese Classics, 2500 B.C.?), although silver\r\nis so included.\r\n\r\nAfter 1200 or 1300 B.C. evidences of the use of lead become frequent.\r\nMoses (Numbers XXXI, 22-23) directs the Israelites with regard to their\r\nplunder from the Midianites (1300 B.C.): \"Only the gold and the silver,\r\nthe brass [_sic_], the iron, the tin, and the lead. Everything that may\r\nabide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be\r\nclean; nevertheless, it shall be purified with the water of separation,\r\nand all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.\"\r\nNumerous other references occur in the Scriptures (Psalms XII, 6;\r\nProverbs XVII, 3; XXV, 4; etc.), one of the most pointed from a\r\nmetallurgical point of view being that of Jeremiah (600 B.C.), who says\r\n(VI, 29-30): \"The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire;\r\nthe founder melteth in vain; for the wicked are not plucked away.\r\nReprobate silver shall men call them because the Lord hath rejected\r\nthem.\" From the number of his metaphors in metallurgical terms we may\r\nwell conclude that Jeremiah was of considerable metallurgical\r\nexperience, which may account for his critical tenor of mind. These\r\nBiblical references all point to a knowledge of separating silver and\r\nlead. Homer mentions lead (Iliad XXIV, 109), and it has been found in\r\nthe remains of ancient Troy and Mycenae (H. Schliemann, \"Troy and its\r\nRemains,\" London, 1875, and \"Mycenae,\" New York, 1877). Both Herodotus\r\n(I, 186) and Diodorus (II, 1) speak of the lead used to fix iron clamps\r\nin the stone bridge of Nitocris (600 B.C.) at Babylon.\r\n\r\nOur best evidence of ancient lead-silver metallurgy is the result of the\r\nstudies at Mt. Laurion by Edouard Ardaillon (_Mines du Laurion dans\r\nl'Antiquite_, Paris, 1897). Here the very extensive old workings and the\r\nslag heaps testify to the greatest activity. The re-opening of the mines\r\nin recent years by a French Company has well demonstrated their\r\ntechnical character, and the frequent mention in Greek History easily\r\ndetermines their date. These deposits of argentiferous galena were\r\nextensively worked before 500 B.C. and while the evidence of\r\nconcentration methods is ample, there is but little remaining of the\r\nancient smelters. Enough, however, remains to demonstrate that the\r\ngalena was smelted in small furnaces at low heat, with forced draught,\r\nand that it was subsequently cupelled. In order to reduce the sulphides\r\nthe ancient smelters apparently depended upon partial roasting in the\r\nfurnace at a preliminary period in reduction, or else upon the\r\nferruginous character of the ore, or upon both. See notes p. 27 and p.\r\n265. Theognis (6th century B.C.) and Hippocrates (5th century B.C.) are\r\nfrequently referred to as mentioning the refining of gold with lead; an\r\ninspection of the passages fails to corroborate the importance which has\r\nbeen laid upon them. Among literary evidences upon lead metallurgy of\r\nlater date, Theophrastus (300 B.C.) describes the making of white-lead\r\nwith lead plates and vinegar. Diodorus Siculus (1st century B.C.), in\r\nhis well-known quotation from Agatharchides (2nd century B.C.) with\r\nregard to gold mining and treatment in Egypt, describes the refining of\r\ngold with lead. (See note 8, p. 279.) Strabo (63 B.C.-24 A.D.) says\r\n(III, 2, 8): \"The furnaces for silver are constructed lofty in order\r\nthat the vapour, which is dense and pestilent, may be raised and carried\r\noff.\" And again (III, 2, 10), in quoting from Polybius (204-125 B.C.):\r\n\"Polybius, speaking of the silver mines of New Carthage, tells us that\r\nthey are extremely large, distant from the city about 20 stadia, and\r\noccupy a circuit of 400 stadia; that there are 40,000 men regularly\r\nengaged in them, and that they yield daily to the Roman people (a\r\nrevenue of) 25,000 drachmae. The rest of the process I pass over, as it\r\nis too long; but as for the silver ore collected, he tells us that it is\r\nbroken up and sifted through sieves over water; that what remains is to\r\nbe again broken, and the water having been strained off it is to be\r\nsifted and broken a third time. The dregs which remain after the fifth\r\ntime are to be melted, and the lead being poured off, the silver is\r\nobtained pure. These silver mines still exist; however, they are no\r\nlonger the property of the State, neither these nor those elsewhere, but\r\nare possessed by private individuals. The gold mines, on the contrary,\r\nnearly all belong to the State. Both at Castlon and other places there\r\nare singular lead mines worked. They contain a small proportion of\r\nsilver, but not sufficient to pay for the expense of refining\"\r\n(Hamilton's Trans.). Dioscorides (1st century A.D.), among his\r\nmedicines, describes several varieties of litharge, their origin, and\r\nthe manner of making white-lead (see on pp. 465, 440), but he gives no\r\nvery tangible information on lead smelting. Pliny, at the same period in\r\nspeaking of silver, (XXXIII, 31), says: \"After this we speak of silver,\r\nthe next folly. Silver is only found in shafts, there being no\r\nindications like shining particles as in the case of gold. This earth is\r\nsometimes red, sometimes of an ashy colour. It is impossible to melt it\r\nexcept with lead ore (_vena plumbi_), called _galena_, which is\r\ngenerally found next to silver veins. And this the same agency of fire\r\nseparates part into lead, which floats on the silver like oil on water.\"\r\n(We have transferred lead and silver in this last sentence, otherwise it\r\nmeans nothing.) Also (XXXIV, 47) he says: \"There are two different\r\nsources of lead, it being smelted from its own ore, whence it comes\r\nwithout the admixture of any other substance, or else from an ore which\r\ncontains it in common with silver. The metal, which flows liquid at the\r\nfirst melting in the furnace, is called _stannum_ that at the second\r\nmelting is silver; that which remains in the furnace is _galena_, which\r\nis added to a third part of the ore. This being again melted, produces\r\nlead with a deduction of two-ninths.\" We have, despite some grammatical\r\nobjections, rendered this passage quite differently from other\r\ntranslators, none of whom have apparently had any knowledge of\r\nmetallurgy; and we will not, therefore, take the several pages of space\r\nnecessary to refute their extraordinary and unnecessary hypotheses. From\r\na metallurgical point of view, two facts must be kept in mind,--first,\r\nthat _galena_ in this instance was the same substance as _molybdaena_,\r\nand they were both either a variety of litharge or of lead carbonates;\r\nsecond, that the _stannum_ of the Ancients was silver-lead alloy.\r\nTherefore, the metallurgy of this paragraph becomes a simple melting of\r\nan argentiferous lead ore, its subsequent cupellation, with a return of\r\nthe litharge to the furnace. Pliny goes into considerable detail as to\r\nvarieties of litharge, for further notes upon which see p. 466. The\r\nRomans were most active lead-silver miners, not only in Spain, but also\r\nin Britain. There are scores of lead pigs of the Roman era in various\r\nEnglish museums, many marked \"_ex argent_.\" Bruce (The Roman Wall,\r\nLondon, 1852, p. 432) describes some Roman lead furnaces in Cumberland\r\nwhere the draught was secured by driving a tapering tunnel into the\r\nhills. The Roman lead slag ran high in metal, and formed a basis for\r\nquite an industry in England in the early 18th century (Hunt, British\r\nMining, London, 1887, p. 26, etc.). There is nothing in mediaeval\r\nliterature which carries us further with lead metallurgy than the\r\nknowledge displayed by Pliny, until we arrive at Agricola's period. The\r\nhistory of cupellation is specially dealt with in note on p. 465.\r\n\r\n[25] _Cadmia_. In the German Translation this is given as _kobelt_. It\r\nwould be of uncertain character, but no doubt partially furnace\r\ncalamine. (See note on p. 112.)\r\n\r\n[26] _Pompholyx_. (_Interpretatio_ gives the German as _Weisser huetten\r\nrauch als ober dem garherde und ober dem kupfer ofen_). This was the\r\nimpure protoxide of zinc deposited in the furnace outlets, and is modern\r\n\"tutty.\" The ancient products, no doubt, contained arsenical oxides as\r\nwell. It was well known to the Ancients, and used extensively for\r\nmedicinal purposes, they dividing it into two species--_pompholyx_ and\r\n_spodos_. The first adequate description is by Dioscorides (V, 46):\r\n\"_Pompholyx_ differs from _spodos_ in species, not in genus. For\r\n_spodos_ is blacker, and is often heavier, full of straws and hairs,\r\nlike the refuse that is swept from the floors of copper smelters. But\r\n_pompholyx_ is fatty, unctuous, white and light enough to fly in the\r\nair. Of this there are two kinds--the one inclines to sky blue and is\r\nunctuous; the other is exceedingly white, and is extremely light. White\r\n_pompholyx_ is made every time that the artificer, in the preparation\r\nand perfecting of copper (brass?) sprinkles powdered _cadmia_ upon it to\r\nmake it more perfect, for the soot which rises being very fine becomes\r\n_pompholyx_. Other _pompholyx_ is made, not only in working copper\r\n(brass?), but is also made from _cadmia_ by continually blowing with\r\nbellows. The manner of doing it is as follows:--The furnace is\r\nconstructed in a two-storied building, and there is a medium-sized\r\naperture opening to the upper chamber; the building wall nearest the\r\nfurnace is pierced with a small opening to admit the nozzle of the\r\nbellows. The building must have a fair-sized door for the artificer to\r\npass in and out. Another small building must adjoin this, in which are\r\nthe bellows and the man who works them. Then the charcoal in the furnace\r\nis lighted, and the artificer continually throws broken bits of _cadmia_\r\nfrom the place above the furnace, whilst his assistant, who is below,\r\nthrows in charcoals, until all of the _cadmia_ inside is consumed. By\r\nthis means the finest and lightest part of the stuff flies up with the\r\nsmoke to the upper chamber, and adheres to the walls of the roof. The\r\nsubstance which is thus formed has at first the appearance of bubbles on\r\nwater, afterward increasing in size, it looks like skeins of wool. The\r\nheaviest parts settle in the bottom, while some fall over and around the\r\nfurnaces, and some lie on the floor of the building. This latter part is\r\nconsidered inferior, as it contains a lot of earth and becomes full of\r\ndirt.\"\r\n\r\nPliny (XXXIV, 33) appears somewhat confused as to the difference between\r\nthe two species: \"That which is called _pompholyx_ and _spodos_ is found\r\nin the copper-smelting furnaces, the difference between them being that\r\n_pompholyx_ is separated by washing, while _spodos_ is not washed. Some\r\nhave called that which is white and very light _pompholyx_, and it is\r\nthe soot of copper and _cadmia_; whereas _spodos_ is darker and heavier.\r\nIt is scraped from the walls of the furnace, and is mixed with particles\r\nof metal, and sometimes with charcoal.\" (XXXIV, 34.) \"The Cyprian\r\n_spodos_ is the best. It is formed by fusing _cadmia_ with copper ore.\r\nThis being the lightest part of the metal, it flies up in the fumes from\r\nthe furnace, and adheres to the roof, being distinguished from the soot\r\nby its whiteness. That which is less white is immature from the furnace,\r\nand it is this which some call '_pompholyx_.'\" Agricola (_De Natura\r\nFossilium_, p. 350) traverses much the same ground as the authors\r\npreviously quoted, and especially recommends the _pompholyx_ produced\r\nwhen making brass by melting alternate layers of copper and calamine\r\n(_cadmia fossilis_).\r\n\r\n[27] _Oleo, ex fece vini sicca confecto_. This oil, made from argol, is\r\nprobably the same substance mentioned a few lines further on as \"wine,\"\r\ndistilled by heating argol in a retort. Still further on, salt made from\r\nargol is mentioned. It must be borne in mind that this argol was crude\r\ntartrates from wine vats, and probably contained a good deal of organic\r\nmatter. Heating argol sufficiently would form potash, but that the\r\ndistillation product could be anything effective it is difficult to see.\r\n\r\n[28] _Aqua valens_. No doubt mainly nitric acid, the preparation of\r\nwhich is explained at length in Book X, p. 439.\r\n\r\n[29] _Quod cum ignis consumit non modo una cum eo, quae ipsius stibii\r\nvis est, aliqua auri particula, sed etiam argenti, si cum auro fuerit\r\npermistum, consumitur._ The meaning is by no means clear. On p. 451 is\r\nset out the old method of parting silver from gold with antimony\r\nsulphide, of which this may be a variation. The silver combines with\r\nsulphur, and the reduced antimony forms an alloy with the gold. The\r\nadded iron and copper would also combine with the sulphur from the\r\nantimony sulphide, and no doubt assist by increasing the amount of free\r\ncollecting agent and by increasing the volume of the matte. (See note\r\n17, p. 451.)\r\n\r\n[30] There follow eight different methods of treating crude bullion or\r\nrich concentrates. In a general way three methods are involved,--1st,\r\nreduction with lead or antimony, and cupellation; 2nd, reduction with\r\nsilver, and separation with nitric acid; 3rd, reduction with lead and\r\nsilver, followed by cupellation and parting with nitric acid. The use of\r\nsulphur or antimony sulphide would tend to part out a certain amount of\r\nsilver, and thus obtain fairly pure bullion upon cupellation. But the\r\nintroduction of copper could only result deleteriously, except that it\r\nis usually accompanied by sulphur in some form, and would thus probably\r\npass off harmlessly as a matte carrying silver. (See note 33 below.)\r\n\r\n[31] It is not very clear where this lead comes from. Should it be\r\nantimony? The German translation gives this as \"silver.\"\r\n\r\n[32] These powders are described in Book VII., p. 236. It is difficult\r\nto say which the second really is. There are numbers of such recipes in\r\nthe _Probierbuechlein_ (see Appendix B), with which a portion of these\r\nare identical.\r\n\r\n[33] A variety of methods are involved in this paragraph: 1st, crude\r\ngold ore is smelted direct; 2nd, gold concentrates are smelted in a lead\r\nbath with some addition of iron--which would simply matte off--the lead\r\nbullion being cupelled; 3rd, roasted and unroasted pyrites and _cadmia_\r\n(probably blende, cobalt, arsenic, etc.) are melted into a matte; this\r\nmatte is repeatedly roasted, and then re-melted in a lead bath; 4th, if\r\nthe material \"flies out of the furnace\" it is briquetted with iron ore\r\nand lime, and the briquettes smelted with copper matte. Three products\r\nresult: (_a_) slag; (_b_) matte; (_c_) copper-gold-silver alloy. The\r\nmatte is roasted, re-smelted with lead, and no doubt a button obtained,\r\nand further matte. The process from this point is not clear. It appears\r\nthat the copper bullion is melted with lead, and normally this product\r\nwould be taken to the liquation furnace, but from the text it would\r\nappear that the lead-copper bullion was melted again with iron ore and\r\npyrites, in which case some of the copper would be turned into the\r\nmatte, and the lead alloy would be richer in gold and silver.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTE ON GOLD.--There is ample evidence of gold being used for\r\nornamental purposes prior to any human record. The occurrence of large\r\nquantities of gold in native form, and the possibility of working it\r\ncold, did not necessitate any particular metallurgical ingenuity. The\r\nearliest indications of metallurgical work are, of course, among the\r\nEgyptians, the method of washing being figured as early as the monuments\r\nof the IV Dynasty (prior to 3800 B.C.). There are in the British Museum\r\ntwo stelae of the XII Dynasty (2400 B.C.) (144 Bay 1 and 145 Bay 6)\r\nrelating to officers who had to do with gold mining in Nubia, and upon\r\none there are references to working what appears to be ore. If this be\r\ntrue, it is the earliest reference to this subject. The Papyrus map\r\n(1500 B.C.) of a gold mine, in the Turin Museum (see note 16, p. 129),\r\nprobably refers to a quartz mine. Of literary evidences there is\r\nfrequent mention of refining gold and passing it through the fire in the\r\nBooks of Moses, arts no doubt learned from the Egyptians. As to working\r\ngold, ore as distinguished from alluvial, we have nothing very tangible,\r\nunless it be the stelae above, until the description of Egyptian gold\r\nmining by Agatharchides (see note 8, p. 279). This geographer, of about\r\nthe 2nd century B.C., describes very clearly indeed the mining,\r\ncrushing, and concentration of ore and the refining of the concentrates\r\nin crucibles with lead, salt, and barley bran. We may mention in passing\r\nthat Theognis (6th Century B.C.) is often quoted as mentioning the\r\nrefining of gold with lead, but we do not believe that the passage in\r\nquestion (1101): \"But having been put to the test and being rubbed\r\nbeside (or against) lead as being refined gold, you will be fair,\" etc.;\r\nor much the same statement again (418) will stand much metallurgical\r\ninterpretation. In any event, the myriads of metaphorical references to\r\nfining and purity of gold in the earliest shreds of literature do not\r\ncarry us much further than do those of Shakespeare or Milton. Vitruvius\r\nand Pliny mention the recovery or refining of gold with mercury (see\r\nnote 12, p. 297 on Amalgamation); and it appears to us that gold was\r\nparted from silver by cementation with salt prior to the Christian era.\r\nWe first find mention of parting with sulphur in the 12th century, with\r\nnitric acid prior to the 14th century, by antimony sulphide prior to the\r\n15th century, and by cementation with nitre by Agricola. (See historical\r\nnote on parting gold and silver, p. 458.) The first mention of parting\r\ngold from copper occurs in the early 16th century (see note 24, p. 462).\r\nThe first comprehensive description of gold metallurgy in all its\r\nbranches is in _De Re Metallica_.\r\n\r\n[34] _Rudis_ silver comprised all fairly pure silver ores, such as\r\nsilver sulphides, chlorides, arsenides, etc. This is more fully\r\ndiscussed in note 6, p. 108.\r\n\r\n[35] _Evolent_,--volatilize?\r\n\r\n[36] _Lapidis plumbarii facile liquescentis_. The German Translation\r\ngives _glantz_, _i.e._, Galena, and the _Interpretatio_ also gives\r\n_glantz_ for _lapis plumbarius_. We are, however, uncertain whether this\r\n\"easily melting\" material is galena or some other lead ore.\r\n\r\n[37] _Molybdaena_ is usually hearth-lead in _De Re Metallica_, but the\r\nGerman translation in this instance uses _pleyertz_, lead ore. From the\r\ncontext it would not appear to mean hearth-lead--saturated bottoms of\r\ncupellation furnaces--for such material would not contain appreciable\r\nsilver. Agricola does confuse what are obviously lead carbonates with\r\nhis other _molybdaena_ (see note 37, p. 476).\r\n\r\n[38] The term _cadmia_ is used in this paragraph without the usual\r\ndefinition. Whether it was _cadmia fornacis_ (furnace accretions) or\r\n_cadmia metallica_ (cobalt-arsenic-blende mixture) is uncertain. We\r\nbelieve it to be the former.\r\n\r\n[39] _Ramentum si lotura ex argento rudi_. This expression is generally\r\nused by the author to indicate concentrates, but it is possible that in\r\nthis sentence it means the tailings after washing rich silver minerals,\r\nbecause the treatment of the _rudis_ silver has been already discussed\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[40] _Ustum_. This might be rendered \"burnt.\" In any event, it seems\r\nthat the material is sintered.\r\n\r\n[41] _Aes purum sive proprius ei color insederit, sive chrysocolla vel\r\ncaeruleo fuerit tinctum, et rude plumbei coloris, aut fusci, aut nigri._\r\nThere are six copper minerals mentioned in this sentence, and from our\r\nstudy of Agricola's _De Natura Fossilium_ we hazard the\r\nfollowing:--_Proprius ei color insederit_,--\"its own colour,\"--probably\r\ncuprite or \"ruby copper.\" _Tinctum chrysocolla_--partly the modern\r\nmineral of that name and partly malachite. _Tinctum caeruleo_, partly\r\nazurite and partly other blue copper minerals. _Rude plumbei\r\ncoloris_,--\"lead coloured,\"--was certainly chalcocite (copper glance).\r\nWe are uncertain of _fusci aut nigri_, but they were probably alteration\r\nproducts. For further discussion see note on p. 109.\r\n\r\n[42] HISTORICAL NOTE ON COPPER SMELTING.--The discoverer of the\r\nreduction of copper by fusion, and his method, like the discoverer of\r\ntin and iron, will never be known, because he lived long before humanity\r\nbegan to make records of its discoveries and doings. Moreover, as\r\ndifferent races passed independently and at different times through the\r\nso-called \"Bronze Age,\" there may have been several independent\r\ndiscoverers. Upon the metallurgy of pre-historic man we have some\r\nevidence in the many \"founders' hoards\" or \"smelters' hoards\" of the\r\nBronze Age which have been found, and they indicate a simple shallow pit\r\nin the ground into which the ore was placed, underlaid with charcoal.\r\nRude round copper cakes eight to ten inches in diameter resulted from\r\nthe cooling of the metal in the bottom of the pit. Analyses of such\r\nBronze Age copper by Professor Gowland and others show a small\r\npercentage of sulphur, and this is possible only by smelting oxidized\r\nores. Copper objects appear in the pre-historic remains in Egypt, are\r\ncommon throughout the first three dynasties, and bronze articles have\r\nbeen found as early as the IV Dynasty (from 3800 to 4700 B.C., according\r\nto the authority adopted). The question of the origin of this bronze,\r\nwhether from ores containing copper and tin or by alloying the two\r\nmetals, is one of wide difference of opinion, and we further discuss the\r\nquestion in note 53, p. 411, under Tin. It is also interesting to note\r\nthat the crucible is the emblem of copper in the hieroglyphics. The\r\nearliest source of Egyptian copper was probably the Sinai Peninsula,\r\nwhere there are reliefs as early as Seneferu (about 3700 B.C.),\r\nindicating that he worked the copper mines. Various other evidences\r\nexist of active copper mining prior to 2500 B.C. (Petrie, Researches in\r\nSinai, London, 1906, p. 51, etc.). The finding of crucibles here would\r\nindicate some form of refining. Our knowledge of Egyptian copper\r\nmetallurgy is limited to deductions from their products, to a few\r\npictures of crude furnaces and bellows, and to the minor remains on the\r\nSinai Peninsula; none of the pictures were, so far as we are aware,\r\nprior to 2300 B.C., but they indicate a considerable advance over the\r\ncrude hearth, for they depict small furnaces with forced draught--first\r\na blow-pipe, and in the XVIII Dynasty (about 1500 B.C.) the bellows\r\nappear. Many copper articles have been found scattered over the Eastern\r\nMediterranean and Asia Minor of pre-Mycenaean Age, some probably as\r\nearly as 3000 B.C. This metal is mentioned in the \"Tribute of Yue\" in the\r\nShoo King (2500 B.C.?); but even less is known of early Chinese\r\nmetallurgy than of the Egyptian. The remains of Mycenaean, Phoenician,\r\nBabylonian, and Assyrian civilizations, stretching over the period from\r\n1800 to 500 B.C., have yielded endless copper and bronze objects, the\r\nformer of considerable purity, and the latter a fairly constant\r\nproportion of from 10% to 14% tin. The copper supply of the pre-Roman\r\nworld seems to have come largely, first from Sinai, and later from\r\nCyprus, and from the latter comes our word copper, by way of the Romans\r\nshortening _aes cyprium_ (Cyprian copper) to _cuprum_. Research in this\r\nisland shows that it produced copper from 3000 B.C., and largely because\r\nof its copper it passed successively under the domination of the\r\nEgyptians, Assyrians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Persians, and Romans. The\r\nbronze objects found in Cyprus show 2% to 10% of tin, although tin does\r\nnot, so far as modern research goes, occur on that island. There can be\r\nno doubt that the Greeks obtained their metallurgy from the Egyptians,\r\neither direct or second-hand--possibly through Mycenae or Phoenicia.\r\nTheir metallurgical gods and the tradition of Cadmus indicate this much.\r\n\r\nBy way of literary evidences, the following lines from Homer (Iliad,\r\nXVIII.) have interest as being the first preserved description in any\r\nlanguage of a metallurgical work. Hephaestus was much interrupted by\r\nThetis, who came to secure a shield for Achilles, and whose general\r\nconversation we therefore largely omit. We adopt Pope's translation:--\r\n\r\n    There the lame architect the goddess found\r\n    Obscure in smoke, his forges flaming round,\r\n    While bathed in sweat from fire to fire he flew;\r\n    And puffing loud the roaring bellows blew.\r\n    * * *\r\n    In moulds prepared, the glowing ore (metal?) he pours.\r\n    * * *\r\n    \"Vouchsafe, oh Thetis! at our board to share\r\n    The genial rites and hospitable fare;\r\n    While I the labours of the forge forego,\r\n    And bid the roaring bellows cease to blow.\"\r\n    Then from his anvil the lame artist rose;\r\n    Wide with distorted legs oblique he goes,\r\n    And stills the bellows, and (in order laid)\r\n    Locks in their chests his instruments of trade;\r\n    Then with a sponge, the sooty workman dress'd\r\n    His brawny arms embrown'd and hairy breast.\r\n    * * *\r\n    Thus having said, the father of the fires\r\n    To the black labours of his forge retires.\r\n    Soon as he bade them blow the bellows turn'd\r\n    Their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn'd\r\n    Resounding breathed: at once the blast expires,\r\n    And twenty forges catch at once the fires;\r\n    Just as the God directs, now loud, now low,\r\n    They raise a tempest, or they gently blow;\r\n    In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd,\r\n    And stubborn brass (copper?) and tin, and solid gold;\r\n    Before, deep fixed, the eternal anvils stand.\r\n    The ponderous hammer loads his better hand;\r\n    His left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round.\r\n    And thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound\r\n    Then first he formed the immense and solid shield;\r\n\r\nEven if we place the siege of Troy at any of the various dates from 1350\r\nto 1100 B.C., it does not follow that the epic received its final form\r\nfor many centuries later, probably 900-800 B.C.; and the experience of\r\nthe race in metallurgy at a much later period than Troy may have been\r\ndrawn upon to fill in details. It is possible to fill a volume with\r\nindirect allusion to metallurgical facts and to the origins of the art,\r\nfrom Greek mythology, from Greek poetry, from the works of the\r\ngrammarians, and from the Bible. But they are of no more technical value\r\nthan the metaphors from our own tongue. Greek literature in general is\r\nsingularly lacking in metallurgical description of technical value, and\r\nit is not until Dioscorides (1st Century A.D.) that anything of much\r\nimportance can be adduced. Aristotle, however, does make an interesting\r\nreference to what may be brass (see note on p. 410), and there can be no\r\ndoubt that if we had the lost work of Aristotle's successor,\r\nTheophrastus (372-288 B.C.), on metals we should be in possession of the\r\nfirst adequate work on metallurgy. As it is, we find the green and blue\r\ncopper minerals from Cyprus mentioned in his \"Stones.\" And this is the\r\nfirst mention of any particular copper ore. He also mentions (XIX.)\r\npyrites \"which melt,\" but whether it was a copper variety cannot be\r\ndetermined. Theophrastus further describes the making of verdigris (see\r\nnote 4, p. 440). From Dioscorides we get a good deal of light on copper\r\ntreatment, but as his objective was to describe medicinal preparations,\r\nthe information is very indirect. He states (V, 100) that \"pyrites is a\r\nstone from which copper is made.\" He mentions _chalcitis_ (copper\r\nsulphide, see note on, p. 573); while his _misy_, _sory_, _melanteria_,\r\n_caeruleum_, and _chrysocolla_ were all oxidation copper or iron\r\nminerals. (See notes on p. 573.) In giving a method of securing\r\n_pompholyx_ (zinc oxide), \"the soot flies up when the copper refiners\r\nsprinkle powdered _cadmia_ over the molten metal\" (see note 26, p. 394);\r\nhe indirectly gives us the first definite indication of making brass,\r\nand further gives some details as to the furnaces there employed, which\r\nembraced bellows and dust chambers. In describing the making of flowers\r\nof copper (see note 26, p. 538) he states that in refining copper, when\r\nthe \"molten metal flows through its tube into a receptacle, the workmen\r\npour cold water on it, the copper spits and throws off the flowers.\" He\r\ngives the first description of vitriol (see note 11, p. 572), and\r\ndescribes the pieces as \"shaped like dice which stick together in\r\nbunches like grapes.\" Altogether, from Dioscorides we learn for the\r\nfirst time of copper made from sulphide ores, and of the recovery of\r\nzinc oxides from furnace fumes; and he gives us the first certain\r\ndescription of making brass, and finally the first notice of blue\r\nvitriol.\r\n\r\nThe next author we have who gives any technical detail of copper work is\r\nPliny (23-79 A.D.), and while his statements carry us a little further\r\nthan Dioscorides, they are not as complete as the same number of words\r\ncould have afforded had he ever had practical contact with the subject,\r\nand one is driven to the conclusion that he was not himself much of a\r\nmetallurgist. Pliny indicates that copper ores were obtained from veins\r\nby underground mining. He gives the same minerals as Dioscorides, but is\r\na good deal confused over _chrysocolla_ and _chalcitis_. He gives no\r\ndescription of the shapes of furnaces, but frequently mentions the\r\nbellows, and speaks of the _cadmia_ and _pompholyx_ which adhered to the\r\nwalls and arches of the furnaces. He has nothing to say as to whether\r\nfluxes are used or not. As to fuel, he says (XXXIII, 30) that \"for\r\nsmelting copper and iron pine wood is the best.\" The following (XXXIV,\r\n20) is of the greatest interest on the subject:--\"Cyprian copper is\r\nknown as _coronarium_ and _regulare_; both are ductile.... In other\r\nmines are made that known as _regulare_ and _caldarium_. These differ,\r\nbecause the _caldarium_ is only melted, and is brittle to the hammer;\r\nwhereas the _regulare_ is malleable or ductile. All Cyprian copper is\r\nthis latter kind. But in other mines with care the difference can be\r\neliminated from _caldarium_, the impurities being carefully purged away\r\nby smelting with fire, it is made into _regulare_. Among the remaining\r\nkinds of copper the best is that of Campania, which is most esteemed for\r\nvessels and utensils. This kind is made in several ways. At Capua it is\r\nmelted with wood, not with charcoal, after which it is sprinkled with\r\nwater and washed through an oak sieve. After it is melted a number of\r\ntimes Spanish _plumbum argentum_ (probably pewter) is added to it in\r\nproportion of ten pounds of the lead to one hundred pounds of copper,\r\nand thereby it is made pliable and assumes that pleasing colour which in\r\nother kinds of copper is effected by oil and the sun. In many parts of\r\nthe Italian provinces they make a similar kind of metal; but there they\r\nadd eight pounds of lead, and it is re-melted over charcoal because of\r\nthe scarcity of wood. Very different is the method carried on in Gaul,\r\nparticularly where the ore is smelted between red hot stones, for this\r\nburns the metal and renders it black and brittle. Moreover, it is\r\nre-melted only a single time, whereas the oftener this operation is\r\nrepeated the better the quality becomes. It is well to remark that all\r\ncopper fuses best when the weather is intensely cold.\" The red hot\r\nstones in Gaul were probably as much figments of imagination as was the\r\nassumption of one commentator that they were a reverberatory furnace.\r\nApart from the above, Pliny says nothing very direct on refining copper.\r\nIt is obvious that more than one melting was practised, but that\r\nanything was known of the nature of oxidation by a blast and reduction\r\nby poling is uncertain. We produce the three following statements in\r\nconnection with some bye-products used for medicinal purposes, which at\r\nleast indicate operations subsequent to the original melting. As to\r\nwhether they represent this species of refining or not, we leave it to\r\nthe metallurgical profession (XXXIV, 24):--\"The flowers of copper are\r\nused in medicine; they are made by fusing copper and moving it to\r\nanother furnace, where the rapid blast separates it into a thousand\r\nparticles, which are called flowers. These scales are also made when the\r\ncopper cakes are cooled in water (XXXIV, 35). _Smega_ is prepared in the\r\ncopper works; when the metal is melted and thoroughly smelted charcoal\r\nis added to it and gradually kindled; after this, being blown upon by a\r\npowerful bellows, it spits out, as it were, copper chaff (XXXIV, 37).\r\nThere is another product of these works easily distinguished from\r\n_smega_, which the Greeks call _diphrygum_. This substance has three\r\ndifferent origins.... A third way of making it is from the residues\r\nwhich fall to the bottom in copper furnaces. The difference between the\r\ndifferent substances (in the furnace) is that the copper itself flows\r\ninto a receiver; the slag makes its escape from the furnace; the flowers\r\nfloat on the top (of the copper?), and the _diphrygum_ remains behind.\r\nSome say that in the furnace there are certain masses of stone which,\r\nbeing smelted, become soldered together, and that the copper fuses\r\naround it, the mass not becoming liquid unless it is transferred to\r\nanother furnace. It thus forms a sort of knot, as it were, in the\r\nmetal.\"\r\n\r\nPliny is a good deal confused over the copper alloys, failing to\r\nrecognise _aurichalcum_ as the same product as that made by mixing\r\n_cadmia_ and molten copper. Further, there is always the difficulty in\r\ntranslation arising from the fact that the Latin _aes_ was\r\nindiscriminately copper, brass, and bronze. He does not, except in one\r\ninstance (XXXIV., 2), directly describe the mixture of _cadmia_ and\r\ncopper. \"Next to Livian (copper) this kind (_corduban_, from Spain) most\r\nreadily absorbs _cadmia_, and becomes almost as excellent as\r\n_aurichalcum_ for making _sesterces_.\" As to bronze, there is no very\r\ndefinite statement; but the _argentatium_ given in the quotation above\r\nfrom XXXIV, 20, is stated in XXXIV, 48, to be a mixture of tin and lead.\r\nThe Romans carried on most extensive copper mining in various parts of\r\ntheir empire; these activities extended from Egypt through Cyprus,\r\nCentral Europe, the Spanish Peninsula, and Britain. The activity of such\r\nworks is abundantly evidenced in the mines, but very little remains upon\r\nthe surface to indicate the equipment; thus, while mining methods are\r\nclear enough, the metallurgy receives little help from these sources. At\r\nRio Tinto there still remain enormous slag heaps from the Romans, and\r\nthe Phoenician miners before them. Professor W. A. Carlyle informs us\r\nthat the ore worked must have been almost exclusively sulphides, as only\r\nnegligible quantities of carbonates exist in the deposits; they probably\r\nmixed basic and siliceous ores. There is some evidence of roasting, and\r\nthe slags run from .2 to .6%. They must have run down mattes, but as to\r\nhow they ultimately arrived at metallic copper there is no evidence to\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nThe special processes for separating other metals from copper by\r\nliquation and matting, or of refining by poling, etc., are none of them\r\nclearly indicated in records or remains until we reach the 12th century.\r\nHere we find very adequate descriptions of copper smelting and refining\r\nby the Monk Theophilus (see Appendix B). We reproduce two paragraphs of\r\ninterest from Hendrie's excellent translation (p. 305 and 313): \"Copper\r\nis engendered in the earth. When a vein of which is found, it is\r\nacquired with the greatest labour by digging and breaking. It is a stone\r\nof a green colour and most hard, and naturally mixed with lead. This\r\nstone, dug up in abundance, is placed upon a pile and burned after the\r\nmanner of chalk, nor does it change colour, but yet loses its hardness,\r\nso that it can be broken up. Then, being bruised small, it is placed in\r\nthe furnace; coals and the bellows being applied, it is incessantly\r\nforged by day and night. This should be done carefully and with caution;\r\nthat is, at first coals are placed in, then small pieces of stone are\r\ndistributed over them, and again coals, and then stone anew, and it is\r\nthus arranged until it is sufficient for the size of the furnace. And\r\nwhen the stone has commenced to liquefy, the lead flows out through some\r\nsmall cavities, and the copper remains within. (313) Of the purification\r\nof copper. Take an iron dish of the size you wish, and line it inside\r\nand out with clay strongly beaten and mixed, and it is carefully dried.\r\nThen place it before a forge upon the coals, so that when the bellows\r\nact upon it the wind may issue partly within and partly above it, and\r\nnot below it. And very small coals being placed round it, place copper\r\nin it equally, and add over it a heap of coals. When, by blowing a long\r\ntime, this has become melted, uncover it and cast immediately fine ashes\r\nof coals over it, and stir it with a thin and dry piece of wood as if\r\nmixing it, and you will directly see the burnt lead adhere to these\r\nashes like a glue. Which being cast out again superpose coals, and\r\nblowing for a long time, as at first, again uncover it, and then do as\r\nyou did before. You do this until at length, by cooking it, you can\r\nwithdraw the lead entirely. Then pour it over the mould which you have\r\nprepared for this, and you will thus prove if it be pure. Hold it with\r\npincers, glowing as it is, before it has become cold, and strike it with\r\na large hammer strongly over the anvil, and if it be broken or split you\r\nmust liquefy it anew as before.\"\r\n\r\nThe next writer of importance was Biringuccio, who was contemporaneous\r\nwith Agricola, but whose book precedes _De Re Metallica_ by 15 years.\r\nThat author (III, 2) is the first to describe particularly the furnace\r\nused in Saxony and the roasting prior to smelting, and the first to\r\nmention fluxes in detail. He, however, describes nothing of matte\r\nsmelting; in copper refining he gives the whole process of poling, but\r\nomits the pole. It is not until we reach _De Re Metallica_ that we find\r\nadequate descriptions of the copper minerals, roasting, matte smelting,\r\nliquation, and refining, with a wealth of detail which eliminates the\r\nnecessity for a large amount of conjecture regarding technical methods\r\nof the time.\r\n\r\n[43] _Cadmia metallica fossilis_ (see note on p. 112). This was\r\nundoubtedly the complex cobalt-arsenic-zinc minerals found in Saxony. In\r\nthe German translation, however, this is given as _Kalmey_, calamine,\r\nwhich is unlikely from the association with pyrites.\r\n\r\n[44] The Roman _modius_ (_modulus_?) held about 550 cubic inches, the\r\nEnglish peck holding 535 cubic inches. Then, perhaps, his seven _moduli_\r\nwould be roughly, 1 bushel 3 pecks, and 18 vessels full would be about\r\n31 bushels--say, roughly, 5,400 lbs. of ore.\r\n\r\n[45] Exhausted liquation cakes (_panes aerei fathiscentes_). This is the\r\ncopper sponge resulting from the first liquation of lead, and still\r\ncontains a considerable amount of lead. The liquation process is\r\ndiscussed in great detail in Book XI.\r\n\r\n[46] The method of this paragraph involves two main objectives--first,\r\nthe gradual enrichment of matte to blister copper; and, second, the\r\ncreation of large cakes of copper-lead-silver alloy of suitable size and\r\nratio of metals for liquation. This latter process is described in\r\ndetail in Book XI. The following groupings show the circuit of the\r\nvarious products, the \"lbs.\" being Roman _librae_:--\r\n\r\n              CHARGE.

Troy per short ton.\r\n\r\n[47] This expression is usually used for hearth-lead, but in this case\r\nthe author is apparently confining himself to lead ore, and apparently\r\nrefers to lead carbonates. The German Translation gives _pleyschweiss_.\r\nThe pyrites mentioned in this paragraph may mean galena, as pyrites was\r\nto Agricola a sort of genera.\r\n\r\n[48] (_Excoquitur_) ... \"_si vero pyrites, primo e fornace, ut\r\nGoselariae videre licet, in catinum defluit liquor quidam candidus,\r\nargento inimicus et nocivus; id enim comburit: quo circa recrementis,\r\nquae supernatant, detractis effunditur: vel induratus conto uncinato\r\nextrahitur: eundem liquorem parietes fornacis exudant._\" In the Glossary\r\nthe following statement appears: \"_Liquor candidus primo e fornace\r\ndefluens cum Goselariae excoquitur pyrites,--kobelt; quem parietes\r\nfornacis exudant,--conterfei._\" In this latter statement Agricola\r\napparently recognised that there were two different substances, _i.e._,\r\nthat the substance found in the furnace walls--_conterfei_--was not the\r\nsame substance as that which first flowed from the furnace--_kobelt_. We\r\nare at no difficulty in recognizing _conterfei_ as metallic zinc; it was\r\nlong known by that term, and this accidental occurrence is repeatedly\r\nmentioned by other authors after Agricola. The substance which first\r\nflowed into the forehearth presents greater difficulties; it certainly\r\nwas not zinc. In _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 347), Agricola says that at\r\nGoslar the lead has a certain white slag floating upon it, the \"colour\r\nderived from the pyrites (_pyriten argenteum_) from which it was\r\nproduced.\" _Pyriten argenteum_ was either marcasite or mispickel,\r\nneither of which offers much suggestion; nor are we able to hazard an\r\nexplanation of value.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTE ON ZINC. The history of zinc metallurgy falls into two\r\ndistinct lines--first, that of the metal, and second, that of zinc ore,\r\nfor the latter was known and used to make brass by cementation with\r\ncopper and to yield oxides by sublimation for medicinal purposes, nearly\r\n2,000 years before the metal became generally known and used in Europe.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to believe that metallic zinc was known to the\r\nAncients, for bracelets made of it, found in the ruins of Cameros (prior\r\nto 500 B.C.), may have been of that age (Raoul Jagnaux, _Traite de\r\nChimie Generale_, 1887, II, 385); and further, a passage in Strabo (63\r\nB.C.-24 A.D.) is of much interest. He states: (XIII, 1, 56) \"There is\r\nfound at Andeira a stone which when burnt becomes iron. It is then put\r\ninto a furnace, together with some kind of earth, when it distils a mock\r\nsilver (_pseudargyrum_), or with the addition of copper it becomes the\r\ncompound called _orichalcum_. There is found a mock silver near Tismolu\r\nalso.\" (Hamilton's Trans., II, p. 381). About the Christian era the\r\nterms _orichalcum_ or _aurichalcum_ undoubtedly refer to brass, but\r\nwhether these terms as used by earlier Greek writers do not refer to\r\nbronze only, is a matter of considerable doubt. Beyond these slight\r\nreferences we are without information until the 16th Century. If the\r\nmetal was known to the Ancients it must have been locally, for by its\r\ngreater adaptability to brass-making it would probably have supplanted\r\nthe crude melting of copper with zinc minerals.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the metal may have been known in the Far East prior to\r\nsuch knowledge in Europe; metallic zinc was imported in considerable\r\nquantities from the East as early as the 16th and 17th centuries under\r\nsuch terms as _tuteneque_, _tuttanego_, _calaem_, and _spiauter_--the\r\nlatter, of course, being the progenitor of our term spelter. The\r\nlocalities of Eastern production have never been adequately\r\ninvestigated. W. Hommel (Engineering and Mining Journal, June 15, 1912)\r\ngives a very satisfactory review of the Eastern literature upon the\r\nsubject, and considers that the origin of manufacture was in India,\r\nalthough the most of the 16th and 17th Century product came from China.\r\nThe earliest certain description seems to be some recipes for\r\nmanufacture quoted by Praphulla Chandra Ray (A History of Hindu\r\nChemistry, London, 1902, p. 39) dating from the 11th to the 14th\r\nCenturies. There does not appear to be any satisfactory description of\r\nthe Chinese method until that of Sir George Staunton (Journal Asiatique\r\nParis, 1835, p. 141.) We may add that spelter was produced in India by\r\ncrude distillation of calamine in clay pots in the early part of the\r\n19th Century (Brooke, Jour. Asiatic Soc. of Bengal, vol. XIX, 1850, p.\r\n212), and the remains of such smelting in Rajputana are supposed to be\r\nvery ancient.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of zinc in Europe seems to have been quite independent of\r\nthe East, but precisely where and when is clouded with much uncertainty.\r\nThe _marchasita aurea_ of Albertus Magnus has been called upon to serve\r\nas metallic zinc, but such belief requires a hypothesis based upon a\r\ngreat deal of assumption. Further, the statement is frequently made that\r\nzinc is mentioned in Basil Valentine's Triumphant Chariot of Antimony\r\n(the only one of the works attributed to this author which may date\r\nprior to the 17th Century), but we have been unable to find any such\r\nreference. The first certain mention of metallic zinc is generally\r\naccredited to Paracelsus (1493-1541), who states (_Liber Mineralium_\r\nII.): \"Moreover there is another metal generally unknown called\r\n_zinken_. It is of peculiar nature and origin; many other metals\r\nadulterate it. It can be melted, for it is generated from three fluid\r\nprinciples; it is not malleable. Its colour is different from other\r\nmetals and does not resemble others in its growth. Its ultimate matter\r\n(_ultima materia_) is not to me yet fully known. It admits of no mixture\r\nand does not permit of the _fabricationes_ of other metals. It stands\r\nalone entirely to itself.\" We do not believe that this book was\r\npublished until after Agricola's works. Agricola introduced the\r\nfollowing statements into his revised edition of _Bermannus_ (p. 431),\r\npublished in 1558: \"It (a variety of pyrites) is almost the colour of\r\ngalena, but of entirely different components. From it there is made gold\r\nand silver, and a great quantity is dug in Reichenstein, which is in\r\nSilesia, as was recently reported to me. Much more is found at Raurici,\r\nwhich they call _zincum_, which species differs from pyrites, for the\r\nlatter contains more silver than gold, the former only gold or hardly\r\nany silver.\" In _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 368): \"For this _cadmia_ is\r\nput, in the same way as quicksilver, in a suitable vessel so that the\r\nheat of the fire will cause it to sublime, and from it is made a black\r\nor brown or grey body which the Alchemists call _cadmia sublimata_. This\r\npossesses corrosive properties to the highest degree. Cognate with this\r\n_cadmia_ and pyrites is a compound which the Noricans and Rhetians call\r\n_zincum_.\" We leave it to readers to decide how near this comes to\r\nmetallic zinc; in any event, he apparently did not recognise his\r\n_conterfei_ from the furnaces as the same substance as the _zincum_ from\r\nSilesia. The first correlation of these substances was apparently by\r\nLohneys, in 1617, who says (_Vom Bergwerk_, p. 83-4): \"When the people\r\nin the smelting works are smelting, there is made under the furnace and\r\nin the cracks in the walls among the badly plastered stones, a metal\r\nwhich is called _zinc_ or _counterfeht_, and when the wall is scraped it\r\nfalls into a vessel placed to receive it. This metal greatly resembles\r\ntin, but it is harder and less malleable.... The Alchemists have a great\r\ndesire for this _zinc_ or bismuth.\" That this metal originated from\r\nblende or calamine was not recognised until long after, and Libavis\r\n(_Alchymia_, Frankfort, 1606), in describing specimens which came from\r\nthe East, did not so identify it, this office being performed by\r\nGlauber, who says (_De Prosperitate Germanias_, Amsterdam, 1656): \"Zink\r\nis a volatile mineral or half-ripe metal when it is extracted from its\r\nore. It is more brilliant than tin and not so fusible or malleable ...\r\nit turns (copper) into brass, as does _lapis calaminaris_, for indeed\r\nthis stone is nothing but infusible zinc, and this zinc might be called\r\na fusible _lapis calaminaris_, inasmuch as both of them partake of the\r\nsame nature.... It sublimates itself up into the cracks of the furnace,\r\nwhereupon the smelters frequently break it out.\" The systematic\r\ndistillation of zinc from calamine was not discovered in Europe until\r\nthe 18th Century. Henkel is generally accredited with the first\r\nstatement to that effect. In a contribution published as an Appendix to\r\nhis other works, of which we have had access only to a French\r\ntranslation (_Pyritologie_, Paris, 1760, p. 494), he concludes that zinc\r\nis a half-metal of which the best ore is calamine, but believes it is\r\nalways associated with lead, and mentions that an Englishman lately\r\narrived from Bristol had seen it being obtained from calamine in his own\r\ncountry. He further mentions that it can be obtained by heating calamine\r\nand lead ore mixed with coal in a thick earthen vessel. The Bristol\r\nworks were apparently those of John Champion, established about 1740.\r\nThe art of distillation was probably learned in the East.\r\n\r\nDefinite information as to the zinc minerals goes back to but a little\r\nbefore the Christian Era, unless we accept nebular references to\r\n_aurichalcum_ by the poets, or what is possibly zinc ore in the \"earth\"\r\nmentioned by Aristotle (_De Mirabilibus_, 62): \"Men say that the copper\r\nof the Mossynoeci is very brilliant and white, no tin being mixed with\r\nit; but there is a kind of earth there which is melted with it.\" This\r\nmight quite well be an arsenical mineral. But whether we can accept the\r\npoets or Aristotle or the remark of Strabo given above, as sufficient\r\nevidence or not, there is no difficulty with the description of _cadmia_\r\nand _pompholyx_ and _spodos_ of Dioscorides (1st Century), parts of\r\nwhich we reproduce in note 26, p. 394. His _cadmia_ is described as\r\nrising from the copper furnaces and clinging to the iron bars, but he\r\ncontinues: \"_Cadmia_ is also prepared by burning the stone called\r\npyrites, which is found near Mt. Soloi in Cyprus.... Some say that\r\n_cadmia_ may also be found in stone quarries, but they are deceived by\r\nstones having a resemblance to _cadmia_.\" _Pompholyx_ and _spodos_ are\r\nevidently furnace calamine. From reading the quotation given on p. 394,\r\nthere can be no doubt that these materials, natural or artificial, were\r\nused to make brass, for he states (V, 46): \"White _pompholyx_ is made\r\nevery time that the artificer in the working and perfecting of the\r\ncopper sprinkles powdered _cadmia_ upon it to make it more perfect, the\r\nsoot arising from this ... is _pompholyx_.\" Pliny is confused between\r\nthe mineral _cadmia_ and furnace _calamine_, and none of his statements\r\nare very direct on the subject of brass making. His most pointed\r\nstatement is (XXXIV, 2): \"... Next to Livian (copper) this kind best\r\nabsorbs _cadmia_, and is almost as good as _aurichalcum_ for making\r\nsesterces and double asses.\" As stated above, there can be little doubt\r\nthat the _aurichalcum_ of the Christian Era was brass, and further, we\r\ndo know of brass sesterces of this period. Other Roman writers of this\r\nand later periods refer to earth used with copper for making brass.\r\nApart from these evidences, however, there is the evidence of analyses\r\nof coins and objects, the earliest of which appears to be a large brass\r\nof the Cassia family of 20 B.C., analyzed by Phillips, who found 17.3%\r\nzinc (Records of Mining and Metallurgy, London, 1857, p. 13). Numerous\r\nanalyses of coins and other objects dating during the following century\r\ncorroborate the general use of brass. Professor Gowland (Presidential\r\nAddress, Inst. of Metals, 1912) rightly considers the Romans were the\r\nfirst to make brass, and at about the above period, for there appears to\r\nbe no certainty of any earlier production. The first adequate technical\r\ndescription of brass making is in about 1200 A.D. being that of\r\nTheophilus, who describes (Hendrie's Trans., p. 307) calcining\r\n_calamina_ and mixing it with finely divided copper in glowing\r\ncrucibles. The process was repeated by adding more calamine and copper\r\nuntil the pots were full of molten metal. This method is repeatedly\r\ndescribed with minor variations by Biringuccio, Agricola (_De Nat.\r\nFos._), and others, down to the 18th Century. For discussion of the zinc\r\nminerals see note on p. 112.\r\n\r\n[49] \"_... non raro, ut nonnulli pyritae sunt, candida...._\" This is\r\napparently the unknown substance mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[50] One _drachma_ is about 3 ounces Troy per short ton. Three _unciae_\r\nare about 72 ounces 6 dwts. Troy per short ton.\r\n\r\n[51] In this section, which treats of the metallurgy of _plumbum\r\ncandidum_, \"tin,\" the word _candidum_ is very often omitted in the\r\nLatin, leaving only _plumbum_, which is confusing at times with lead.\r\nThe black tin-stone, _lapilli nigri_ has been treated in a similar\r\nmanner, _lapilli_ (small stones) constantly occurring alone in the\r\nLatin. This has been rendered as \"tin-stone\" throughout, and the\r\nmaterial prior to extraction of the _lapilli nigri_ has been rendered\r\n\"tin-stuff,\" after the Cornish.\r\n\r\n[52] \"_... ex saxis vilibus, quae natura de diversa materia composuit._\"\r\nThe Glossary gives _grindstein_. Granite (?).\r\n\r\n[53] HISTORICAL NOTES ON TIN METALLURGY. The first appearance of tin\r\nlies in the ancient bronzes. And while much is written upon the \"Bronze\r\nAge\" by archaeologists, we seriously doubt whether or not a large part of\r\nso-called bronze is not copper. In any event, this period varied with\r\neach race, and for instance, in Britain may have been much later than\r\nEgyptian historic times. The bronze articles of the IV Dynasty (from\r\n3800 to 4700 B.C. depending on the authority) place us on certain ground\r\nof antiquity. Professor Gowland (Presidential Address, Inst. of Metals,\r\nLondon, 1912) maintains that the early bronzes were the result of direct\r\nsmelting of stanniferous copper ores, and while this may be partially\r\ntrue for Western Europe, the distribution and nature of the copper\r\ndeposits do not warrant this assumption for the earlier scenes of human\r\nactivity--Asia Minor, Egypt, and India. Further, the lumps of rough tin\r\nand also of copper found by Borlase (Tin Mining in Spain, Past and\r\nPresent, London, 1897, p. 25) in Cornwall, mixed with bronze celts under\r\nconditions certainly indicating the Bronze Age, is in itself of\r\nconsiderable evidence of independent melting. To our mind the vast\r\nmajority of ancient bronzes must have been made from copper and tin\r\nmined and smelted independently. As to the source of supply of ancient\r\ntin, we are on clear ground only with the advent of the Phoenicians,\r\n1500-1000 B.C., who, as is well known, distributed to the ancient world\r\na supply from Spain and Britain. What the source may have been prior to\r\nthis time has been subject to much discussion, and while some slender\r\nthreads indicate the East, we believe that a more local supply to Egypt,\r\netc., is not impossible. The discovery of large tin fields in Central\r\nAfrica and the native-made tin ornaments in circulation among the\r\nnegroes, made possible the entrance of the metal into Egypt along the\r\ntrade routes. Further, we see no reason why alluvial tin may not have\r\nexisted within easy reach and have become exhausted. How quickly such a\r\nsource of metal supply can be forgotten and no evidence remain, is\r\nindicated by the seldom remembered alluvial gold supply from Ireland.\r\nHowever, be these conjectures as they may, the East has long been the\r\nscene of tin production and of transportation activity. Among the\r\nslender evidences that point in this direction is that the Sanskrit term\r\nfor tin is _kastira_, a term also employed by the Chaldeans, and\r\nrepresented in Arabic by _kasdir_, and it may have been the progenitor\r\nof the Greek _cassiteros_. There can be no doubt that the Phoenicians\r\nalso traded with Malacca, etc., but beyond these threads there is little\r\nto prove the pre-western source. The strained argument of Beckmann\r\n(Hist. of Inventions, vol. II., p. 207) that the _cassiteros_ of Homer\r\nand the _bedil_ of the Hebrews was possibly not tin, and that tin was\r\nunknown at this time, falls to the ground in the face of the vast amount\r\nof tin which must have been in circulation to account for the bronze\r\nused over a period 2,000 years prior to those peoples. Tin is early\r\nmentioned in the Scriptures (Numbers XXXI, 22), being enumerated among\r\nthe spoil of the Midianites (1200 B.C.?), also Ezekiel (600 B.C., XXVII,\r\n12) speaks of tin from Tarshish (the Phoenician settlement on the\r\ncoast of Spain). According to Homer tin played considerable part in\r\nVulcan's metallurgical stores. Even approximately at what period the\r\nPhoenicians began their distribution from Spain and Britain cannot be\r\ndetermined. They apparently established their settlements at Gades\r\n(Cadiz) in Tarshish, beyond Gibraltar, about 1100 B.C. The remains of\r\ntin mining in the Spanish peninsula prior to the Christian Era indicate\r\nmost extensive production by the Phoenicians, but there is little\r\nevidence as to either mining or smelting methods. Generally as to the\r\ntechnical methods of mining and smelting tin, we are practically without\r\nany satisfactory statement down to Agricola. However, such scraps of\r\ninformation as are available are those in Homer (see note on p. 402),\r\nDiodorus, and Pliny.\r\n\r\nDiodorus says (V, 2) regarding tin in Spain: \"They dig it up, and melt\r\nit down in the same way as they do gold and silver;\" and again, speaking\r\nof the tin in Britain, he says: \"These people make tin, which they dig\r\nup with a great deal of care and labour; being rocky, the metal is mixed\r\nwith earth, out of which they melt the metal, and then refine it.\" Pliny\r\n(XXXIV, 47), in the well-known and much-disputed passage: \"Next to be\r\nconsidered are the characteristics of lead, which is of two kinds, black\r\nand white. The most valuable is the white; the Greeks called it\r\n_cassiteros_, and there is a fabulous story of its being searched for\r\nand carried from the islands of Atlantis in barks covered with hides.\r\nCertainly it is obtained in Lusitania and Gallaecia on the surface of\r\nthe earth from black-coloured sand. It is discovered by its great\r\nweight, and it is mixed with small pebbles in the dried beds of\r\ntorrents. The miners wash these sands, and that which settles they heat\r\nin the furnace. It is also found in gold mines, which are called\r\n_alutiae_. A stream of water passing through detaches small black\r\npebbles variegated with white spots, the weight of which is the same as\r\ngold. Hence it is that they remain in the baskets of the gold collectors\r\nwith the gold; afterward, they are separated in a _camillum_ and when\r\nmelted become white lead.\"\r\n\r\nThere is practically no reference to the methods of Cornish tin-working\r\nover the whole period of 2,000 years that mining operations were carried\r\non there prior to the Norman occupation. From then until Agricola's\r\ntime, a period of some four centuries, there are occasional references\r\nin Stannary Court proceedings, Charters, and such-like official\r\ndocuments which give little metallurgical insight. From a letter of\r\nWilliam de Wrotham, Lord Warden of the Stannaries, in 1198, setting out\r\nthe regulations for the impost on tin, it is evident that the black tin\r\nwas smelted once at the mines and that a second smelting or refining was\r\ncarried out in specified towns under the observation of the Crown\r\nOfficials. In many other official documents there are repeated\r\nreferences to the right to dig turfs and cut wood for smelting the tin.\r\nUnder note 8, p. 282, we give some further information on tin\r\nconcentration, and the relation of Cornish and German tin miners.\r\nBiringuccio (1540) gives very little information on tin metallurgy, and\r\nwe are brought to _De Re Metallica_ for the first clear exposition.\r\n\r\nAs to the description on these pages it must be remembered that the\r\ntin-stone has been already roasted, thus removing some volatile\r\nimpurities and oxidizing others, as described on page 348. The furnaces\r\nand the methods of working the tin, here described, are almost identical\r\nwith those in use in Saxony to-day. In general, since Agricola's time\r\ntin has not seen the mechanical and metallurgical development of the\r\nother metals. The comparatively small quantities to be dealt with; the\r\nnecessity of maintaining a strong reducing atmosphere, and consequently\r\na mild cold blast; and the comparatively low temperature demanded, gave\r\nlittle impetus to other than crude appliances until very modern times.\r\n\r\n[54] _Aureo nummo_. German Translation gives _reinschen guelden_, which\r\nwas the equivalent of about $1.66, or 6.9 shillings. The purchasing\r\npower of money was, however, several times as great as at present.\r\n\r\n[55] In the following descriptions of iron-smelting, we have three\r\nprocesses described; the first being the direct reduction of malleable\r\niron from ore, the second the transition stage then in progress from the\r\ndirect to indirect method by way of cast-iron; and the third a method of\r\nmaking steel by cementation. The first method is that of primitive\r\niron-workers of all times and all races, and requires little comment. A\r\npasty mass was produced, which was subsequently hammered to make it\r\nexude the slag, the hammered mass being the ancient \"bloom.\" The second\r\nprocess is of considerable interest, for it marks one of the earliest\r\ndescriptions of working iron in \"a furnace similar to a blast furnace,\r\nbut much wider and higher.\" This original German _Stueckofen_ or high\r\nbloomery furnace was used for making \"masses\" of wrought-iron under\r\nessentially the same conditions as its progenitor the forge--only upon a\r\nlarger scale. With high temperatures, however, such a furnace would, if\r\ndesired, yield molten metal, and thus the step to cast-iron as a\r\npreliminary to wrought-iron became very easy and natural, in fact\r\nAgricola mentions above that if the iron is left to settle in the\r\nfurnace it becomes hard. The making of malleable iron by subsequent\r\ntreatment of the cast-iron--the indirect method--originated in about\r\nAgricola's time, and marks the beginning of one of those subtle economic\r\ncurrents destined to have the widest bearing upon civilization. It is to\r\nus uncertain whether he really understood the double treatment or not.\r\nIn the above paragraph he says from ore \"once or twice smelted they make\r\niron,\" etc., and in _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 339) some reference is\r\nmade to pouring melted iron, all of which would appear to be cast-iron.\r\nHe does not, however, describe the 16th Century method of converting\r\ncast into wrought iron by way of in effect roasting the pig iron to\r\neliminate carbon by oxidation, with subsequent melting into a \"ball\" or\r\n\"mass.\" It must be borne in mind that puddling for this purpose did not\r\ncome into use until the end of the 18th Century. A great deal of\r\ndiscussion has arisen as to where and at what time cast-iron was made\r\nsystematically, but without satisfactory answer; in any event, it seems\r\nto have been in about the end of the 14th Century, as cast cannon began\r\nto appear about that time. It is our impression that the whole of this\r\ndiscussion on iron in _De Re Metallica_ is an abstract from Biringuccio,\r\nwho wrote 15 years earlier, as it is in so nearly identical terms. Those\r\ninterested will find a translation of Biringuccio's statement with\r\nregard to steel in Percy's Metallurgy of Iron and Steel, London, 1864,\r\np. 807.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTE ON IRON SMELTING. The archaeologists' division of the\r\nhistory of racial development into the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages,\r\nbased upon objects found in tumuli, burial places, etc., would on the\r\nface of it indicate the prior discovery of copper metallurgy over iron,\r\nand it is generally so maintained by those scientists. The metallurgists\r\nhave not hesitated to protest that while this distinction of \"Ages\" may\r\nserve the archaeologists, and no doubt represents the sequence in which\r\nthe metal objects are found, yet it by no means follows that this was\r\nthe order of their discovery or use, but that iron by its rapidity of\r\noxidation has simply not been preserved. The arguments which may be\r\nadvanced from our side are in the main these. Iron ore is of more\r\nfrequent occurrence than copper ores, and the necessary reduction of\r\ncopper oxides (as most surface ores must have been) to fluid metal\r\nrequires a temperature very much higher than does the reduction of iron\r\noxides to wrought-iron blooms, which do not necessitate fusion. The\r\ncomparatively greater simplicity of iron metallurgy under primitive\r\nconditions is well exemplified by the hill tribes of Northern Nigeria,\r\nwhere in village forges the negroes reduce iron sufficient for their\r\nneeds, from hematite. Copper alone would not be a very serviceable metal\r\nto primitive man, and he early made the advance to bronze; this latter\r\nmetal requires three metallurgical operations, and presents immeasurably\r\ngreater difficulties than iron. It is, as Professor Gowland has\r\ndemonstrated (Presidential Address, Inst. of Metals, London, 1912) quite\r\npossible to make bronze from melting stanniferous copper ores, yet such\r\ncombined occurrence at the surface is rare, and, so far as known, the\r\ncopper sources from which Asia Minor and Egypt obtained their supply do\r\nnot contain tin. It seems to us, therefore, that in most cases the\r\nseparate fusions of different ores and their subsequent re-melting were\r\nrequired to make bronze. The arguments advanced by the archaeologists\r\nbear mostly upon the fact that, had iron been known, its superiority\r\nwould have caused the primitive races to adopt it, and we should not\r\nfind such an abundance of bronze tools. As to this, it may be said that\r\nbronze weapons and tools are plentiful enough in Egyptian, Mycenaean, and\r\nearly Greek remains, long after iron was demonstrably well known. There\r\nhas been a good deal pronounced by etymologists on the history of iron\r\nand copper, for instance, by Max Mueller, (Lectures on the Science of\r\nLanguage, Vol. II, p. 255, London, 1864), and many others, but the\r\namazing lack of metallurgical knowledge nullifies practically all their\r\nconclusions. The oldest Egyptian texts extant, dating 3500 B.C., refer\r\nto iron, and there is in the British Museum a piece of iron found in the\r\nPyramid of Kephron (3700 B.C.) under conditions indicating its\r\nco-incident origin. There is exhibited also a fragment of oxidized iron\r\nlately found by Professor Petrie and placed as of the VI Dynasty (B.C.\r\n3200). Despite this evidence of an early knowledge of iron, there is\r\nalmost a total absence of Egyptian iron objects for a long period\r\nsubsequent to that time, which in a measure confirms the view of its\r\ndisappearance rather than that of ignorance of it. Many writers have\r\nassumed that the Ancients must have had some superior art of hardening\r\ncopper or bronze, because the cutting of the gigantic stonework of the\r\ntime could not have been done with that alloy as we know it; no such\r\nhardening appears among the bronze tools found, and it seems to us that\r\nthe argument is stronger that the oldest Egyptian stoneworkers employed\r\nmostly iron tools, and that these have oxidized out of existence. The\r\nreasons for preferring copper alloys to iron for decorative objects were\r\nequally strong in ancient times as in the present day, and accounts\r\nsufficiently for these articles, and, therefore, iron would be devoted\r\nto more humble objects less likely to be preserved. Further, the\r\nEgyptians at a later date had some prejudices against iron for sacred\r\npurposes, and the media of preservation of most metal objects were not\r\nopen to iron. We know practically nothing of very early Egyptian\r\nmetallurgy, but in the time of Thotmes III. (1500 B.C.) bellows were\r\nused upon the forge.\r\n\r\nOf literary evidences the earliest is in the Shoo King among the Tribute\r\nof Yue (2500 B.C.?). Iron is frequently mentioned in the Bible, but it is\r\ndoubtful if any of the early references apply to steel. There is\r\nscarcely a Greek or Latin author who does not mention iron in some\r\nconnection, and of the earliest, none are so suggestive from a\r\nmetallurgical point of view as Homer, by whom \"laboured\" mass\r\n(wrought-iron?) is often referred to. As, for instance, in the Odyssey\r\n(I., 234) Pallas in the guise of Mentes, says according to Pope:\r\n\r\n    \"Freighted with iron from my native land\r\n    I steer my voyage to the Brutian strand,\r\n    To gain by commerce for the laboured mass\r\n    A just proportion of refulgent brass.\"\r\n\r\n(Brass is modern poetic licence for copper or bronze). Also, in the\r\nOdyssey (IX, 465) when Homer describes how Ulysses plunged the stake\r\ninto Cyclop's eye, we have the first positive evidence of steel,\r\nalthough hard iron mentioned in the Tribute of Yue, above referred to, is\r\nsometimes given as steel:\r\n\r\n    \"And as when armourers temper in the ford\r\n    The keen-edg'd pole-axe, or the shining sword,\r\n    The red-hot metal hisses in the lake.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt early wrought-iron was made in the same manner as Agricola\r\ndescribes. We are, however, not so clear as to the methods of making\r\nsteel. Under primitive methods of making wrought-iron it is quite\r\npossible to carburize the iron sufficiently to make steel direct from\r\nore. The primitive method of India and Japan was to enclose lumps of\r\nwrought-iron in sealed crucibles with charcoal and sawdust, and heat\r\nthem over a long period. Neither Pliny nor any of the other authors of\r\nthe period previous to the Christian Era give us much help on steel\r\nmetallurgy, although certain obscure expressions of Aristotle have been\r\ncalled upon (for instance, St. John V. Day, Prehistoric Use of Iron and\r\nSteel, London, 1877, p. 134) to prove its manufacture by immersing\r\nwrought-iron in molten cast-iron.\r\n\r\n[56] _Quae vel aerosa est, vel cocta_. It is by no means certain that\r\n_cocta_, \"cooked\" is rightly translated, for the author has not hitherto\r\nused this expression for heated. This may be residues from roasting and\r\nleaching pyrites for vitriol, etc.\r\n\r\n[57] Agricola draws no sharp line of distinction between antimony the\r\nmetal, and its sulphide. He uses the Roman term _stibi_ or _stibium_\r\n(_Interpretatio_,--_Spiesglas_) throughout this book, and evidently in\r\nmost cases means the sulphide, but in others, particularly in parting\r\ngold and silver, metallic antimony would be reduced out. We have been in\r\nmuch doubt as to the term to introduce into the text, as the English\r\n\"stibnite\" carries too much precision of meaning. Originally the\r\n\"antimony\" of trade was the sulphide. Later, with the application of\r\nthat term to the metal, the sulphide was termed \"grey antimony,\" and we\r\nhave either used _stibium_ for lack of better alternative, or adopted\r\n\"grey antimony.\" The method described by Agricola for treating antimony\r\nsulphide is still used in the Harz, in Bohemia, and elsewhere. The\r\nstibnite is liquated out at a low heat and drips from the upper to the\r\nlower pot. The resulting purified antimony sulphide is the modern\r\ncommercial \"crude antimony\" or \"grey antimony.\"\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTE ON THE METALLURGY OF ANTIMONY. The Egyptologists have\r\nadopted the term \"antimony\" for certain cosmetics found in Egyptian\r\ntombs from a very early period. We have, however, failed to find any\r\nreliable analyses which warrant this assumption, and we believe that it\r\nis based on the knowledge that antimony was used as a base for eye\r\nointments in Greek and Roman times, and not upon proper chemical\r\ninvestigation. It may be that the ideograph which is interpreted as\r\nantimony may really mean that substance, but we only protest that the\r\nchemist should have been called in long since. In St. Jerome's\r\ntranslation of the Bible, the cosmetic used by Jezebel (II. Kings IX,\r\n30) and by the lady mentioned by Ezekiel (XXIII, 40), \"who didst wash\r\nthyself and paintedst thine eyes\" is specifically given as _stibio_. Our\r\nmodern translation carries no hint of the composition of the cosmetic,\r\nand whether some of the Greek or Hebrew MSS. do furnish a basis for such\r\ntranslation we cannot say. The Hebrew term for this mineral was _kohl_,\r\nwhich subsequently passed into \"alcool\" and \"alkohol\" in other\r\nlanguages, and appears in the Spanish Bible in the above passage in\r\nEzekiel as _alcoholaste_. The term _antimonium_ seems to have been first\r\nused in Latin editions of Geber published in the latter part of the 15th\r\nCentury. In any event, the metal is clearly mentioned by Dioscorides\r\n(1st Century), who calls it _stimmi_, and Pliny, who termed it\r\n_stibium_, and they leave no doubt that it was used as a cosmetic for\r\npainting the eyebrows and dilating the eyes. Dioscorides (V, 59) says:\r\n\"The best _stimmi_ is very brilliant and radiant. When broken it divides\r\ninto layers with no part earthy or dirty; it is brittle. Some call it\r\n_stimmi_, others _platyophthalmon_ (wide eyed); others _larbason_,\r\nothers _gynaekeion_ (feminine).... It is roasted in a ball of dough with\r\ncharcoal until it becomes a cinder.... It is also roasted by putting it\r\non live charcoal and blowing it. If it is roasted too much it becomes\r\nlead.\" Pliny states (XXXIII, 33 and 34): \"In the same mines in which\r\nsilver is found, properly speaking there is a stone froth. It is white\r\nand shining, not transparent; is called _stimmi_, or _stibi_, or\r\n_alabastrum_, and _larbasis_. There are two kinds of it, the male and\r\nthe female. The most approved is the female, the male being more uneven,\r\nrougher, less heavy, not so radiant, and more gritty. The female kind is\r\nbright and friable, laminar and not globular. It is astringent and\r\nrefrigerative, and its principal use is for the eyes.... It is burned in\r\nmanure in a furnace, is quenched with milk, ground with rain water in a\r\nmortar, and while thus turbid it is poured into a copper vessel and\r\npurified with nitrum ... above all in roasting it care should be taken\r\nthat it does not turn to lead.\" There can be little doubt from\r\nDioscorides' statement of its turning to lead that he had seen the metal\r\nantimony, although he thought it a species of lead. Of further interest\r\nin connection with the ancient knowledge of the metal is the Chaldean\r\nvase made of antimony described by Berthelot (_Comptes Rendus_, 1887,\r\nCIV, 265). It is possible that Agricola knew the metal, although he\r\ngives no details as to de-sulphurizing it or for recovering the metal\r\nitself. In _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 181) he makes a statement which\r\nwould indicate the metal, \"_Stibium_ when melted in the crucible and\r\nrefined has as much right to be regarded as a metal as is accorded to\r\nlead by most writers. If when smelted a certain portion be added to tin,\r\na printer's alloy is made from which type is cast that is used by those\r\nwho print books.\" Basil Valentine, in his \"Triumphal Chariot of\r\nAntimony,\" gives a great deal that is new with regard to this metal,\r\neven if we can accredit the work with no earlier origin than its\r\npublication--about 1600; it seems possible however, that it was written\r\nlate in the 15th Century (see Appendix B). He describes the preparation\r\nof the metal from the crude ore, both by roasting and reduction from the\r\noxide with argol and saltpetre, and also by fusing with metallic iron.\r\nWhile the first description of these methods is usually attributed to\r\nValentine, it may be pointed out that in the _Probierbuechlein_ (1500) as\r\nwell as in Agricola the separation of silver from iron by antimony\r\nsulphide implies the same reaction, and the separation of silver and\r\ngold with antimony sulphide, often attributed to Valentine, is\r\nrepeatedly set out in the _Probierbuechlein_ and in _De Re Metallica_.\r\nBiringuccio (1540) has nothing of importance to say as to the treatment\r\nof antimonial ores, but mentions it as an alloy for bell-metal, which\r\nwould imply the metal.\r\n\r\n[58] HISTORICAL NOTE ON THE METALLURGY OF QUICKSILVER. The earliest\r\nmention of quicksilver appears to have been by Aristotle\r\n(_Meteorologica_ IV, 8, 11), who speaks of it as fluid silver (_argyros\r\nchytos_). Theophrastus (105) states: \"Such is the production of\r\nquicksilver, which has its uses. This is obtained from cinnabar rubbed\r\nwith vinegar in a brass mortar with a brass pestle.\" (Hill's Trans., p.\r\n139). Theophrastus also (103) mentions cinnabar from Spain and\r\nelsewhere. Dioscorides (V, 70) appears to be the first to describe the\r\nrecovery of quicksilver by distillation: \"Quicksilver (_hydrargyros_,\r\n_i.e._, liquid silver) is made from _ammion_, which is called\r\n_cinnabari_. An iron bowl containing _cinnabari_ is put into an earthen\r\nvessel and covered over with a cup-shaped lid smeared with clay. Then it\r\nis set on a fire of coals and the soot which sticks to the cover when\r\nwiped off and cooled is quicksilver. Quicksilver is also found in drops\r\nfalling from the walls of the silver mines. Some say there are\r\nquicksilver mines. It can be kept only in vessels of glass, lead, tin\r\n(?), or silver, for if put in vessels of any other substances it\r\nconsumes them and flows through.\" Pliny (XXXIII, 41): \"There has been\r\ndiscovered a way of extracting _hydrargyros_ from the inferior _minium_\r\nas a substitute for quicksilver, as mentioned. There are two methods:\r\neither by pounding _minium_ and vinegar in a brass mortar with a brass\r\npestle, or else by putting _minium_ into a flat earthen dish covered\r\nwith a lid, well luted with potter's clay. This is set in an iron pan\r\nand a fire is then lighted under the pan, and continually blown by a\r\nbellows. The perspiration collects on the lid and is wiped off and is\r\nlike silver in colour and as liquid as water.\" Pliny is somewhat\r\nconfused over the _minium_--or the text is corrupt, for this should be\r\nthe genuine _minium_ of Roman times. The methods of condensation on the\r\nleaves of branches placed in a chamber, of condensing in ashes placed\r\nover the mouth of the lower pot, and of distilling in a retort, are\r\nreferred to by Biringuccio (A.D. 1540), but with no detail.\r\n\r\n[59] Most of these methods depend upon simple liquation of native\r\nbismuth. The sulphides, oxides, etc., could not be obtained without\r\nfusing in a furnace with appropriate de-sulphurizing or reducing agents,\r\nto which Agricola dimly refers. In _Bermannus_ (p. 439), he says:\r\n\"_Bermannus_.--I will show you another kind of mineral which is numbered\r\namongst metals, but appears to me to have been unknown to the Ancients;\r\nwe call it _bisemutum_. _Naevius_.--Then in your opinion there are more\r\nkinds of metals than the seven commonly believed? _Bermannus_.--More, I\r\nconsider; for this which just now I said we called _bisemutum_, cannot\r\ncorrectly be called _plumbum candidum_ (tin) nor _nigrum_ (lead), but is\r\ndifferent from both, and is a third one. _Plumbum candidum_ is whiter\r\nand _plumbum nigrum_ is darker, as you see. _Naevius_.--We see that this\r\nis of the colour of _galena_. _Ancon_.--How then can _bisemutum_, as you\r\ncall it, be distinguished from _galena_? _Bermannus_.--Easily; when you\r\ntake it in your hands it stains them with black unless it is quite hard.\r\nThe hard kind is not friable like _galena_, but can be cut. It is\r\nblacker than the kind of crude silver which we say is almost the colour\r\nof lead, and thus is different from both. Indeed, it not rarely contains\r\nsome silver. It generally shows that there is silver beneath the place\r\nwhere it is found, and because of this our miners are accustomed to call\r\nit the 'roof of silver.' They are wont to roast this mineral, and from\r\nthe better part they make metal; from the poorer part they make a\r\npigment of a kind not to be despised.\" This pigment was cobalt blue (see\r\nnote on p. 112), indicating a considerable confusion of these minerals.\r\nThis quotation is the first description of bismuth, and the above text\r\nthe first description of bismuth treatment. There is, however, bare\r\nmention of the mineral earlier, in the following single line from the\r\n_Probierbuechlein_ (p. 1): \"Jupiter (controls) the ores of tin and\r\n_wismundt_.\" And it is noted in the _Nuetzliche Bergbuechlein_ in\r\nassociation with silver (see Appendix B).\r\n\r\n[60] This _cadmia_ is given in the German translation as _kobelt_. It is\r\nprobably the cobalt-arsenic-bismuth minerals common in Saxony. A large\r\nportion of the world's supply of bismuth to-day comes from the cobalt\r\ntreatment works near Schneeberg. For further discussion of _cadmia_ see\r\nnote on p. 112.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions as to the methods of smelting ores and of obtaining metals I\r\ndiscussed in Book IX. Following this, I should explain in what manner\r\nthe precious metals are parted from the base metals, or on the other\r\nhand the base metals from the precious[1]. Frequently two metals,\r\noccasionally more than two, are melted out of one ore, because in nature\r\ngenerally there is some amount of gold in silver and in copper, and some\r\nsilver in gold, copper, lead, and iron; likewise some copper in gold,\r\nsilver, lead, and iron, and some lead in silver; and lastly, some iron\r\nin copper[2]. But I will begin with gold.\r\n\r\nGold is parted from silver, or likewise the latter from the former,\r\nwhether it be mixed by nature or by art, by means of _aqua valens_[3],\r\nand by powders which consist of almost the same things as this _aqua_.\r\nIn order to preserve the sequence, I will first speak of the ingredients\r\nof which this _aqua_ is made, then of the method of making it, then of\r\nthe manner in which gold is parted from silver or silver from gold.\r\nAlmost all these ingredients contain vitriol or alum, which, by\r\nthemselves, but much more when joined with saltpetre, are powerful to\r\npart silver from gold. As to the other things that are added to them,\r\nthey cannot individually by their own strength and nature separate those\r\nmetals, but joined they are very powerful. Since there are many\r\ncombinations, I will set out a few. In the first, the use of which is\r\ncommon and general, there is one _libra_ of vitriol and as much salt,\r\nadded to a third of a _libra_ of spring water. The second contains two\r\n_librae_ of vitriol, one of saltpetre, and as much spring or river water\r\nby weight as will pass away whilst the vitriol is being reduced to\r\npowder by the fire. The third consists of four _librae_ of vitriol, two\r\nand a half _librae_ of saltpetre, half a _libra_ of alum, and one and a\r\nhalf _librae_ of spring water. The fourth consists of two _librae_ of\r\nvitriol, as many _librae_ of saltpetre, one quarter of a _libra_ of\r\nalum, and three-quarters of a _libra_ of spring water. The fifth is\r\ncomposed of one _libra_ of saltpetre, three _librae_ of alum, half a\r\n_libra_ of brick dust, and three-quarters of a _libra_ of spring water.\r\nThe sixth consists of four _librae_ of vitriol, three _librae_ of\r\nsaltpetre, one of alum, one _libra_ likewise of stones which when thrown\r\ninto a fierce furnace are easily liquefied by fire of the third order,\r\nand one and a half _librae_ of spring water. The seventh is made of two\r\n_librae_ of vitriol, one and a half _librae_ of saltpetre, half a\r\n_libra_ of alum, and one _libra_ of stones which when thrown into a\r\nglowing furnace are easily liquefied by fire of the third order, and\r\nfive-sixths of a _libra_ of spring water. The eighth is made of two\r\n_librae_ of vitriol, the same number of _librae_ of saltpetre, one and a\r\nhalf _librae_ of alum, one _libra_ of the lees of the _aqua_ which parts\r\ngold from silver; and to each separate _libra_ a sixth of urine is\r\npoured over it. The ninth contains two _librae_ of powder of baked\r\nbricks, one _libra_ of vitriol, likewise one _libra_ of saltpetre, a\r\nhandful of salt, and three-quarters of a _libra_ of spring water. Only\r\nthe tenth lacks vitriol and alum, but it contains three _librae_ of\r\nsaltpetre, two _librae_ of stones which when thrown into a hot furnace\r\nare easily liquefied by fire of the third order, half a _libra_ each of\r\nverdigris[4], of _stibium_, of iron scales and filings, and of\r\nasbestos[5], and one and one-sixth _librae_ of spring water.\r\n\r\nAll the vitriol from which the _aqua_ is usually made is first reduced\r\nto powder in the following way. It is thrown into an earthen crucible\r\nlined on the inside with litharge, and heated until it melts; then it is\r\nstirred with a copper wire, and after it has cooled it is pounded to\r\npowder. In the same manner saltpetre melted by the fire is pounded to\r\npowder when it has cooled. Some indeed place alum upon an iron plate,\r\nroast it, and make it into powder.\r\n\r\nAlthough all these _aquae_ cleanse gold concentrates or dust from\r\nimpurities, yet there are certain compositions which possess singular\r\npower. The first of these consists of one _libra_ of verdigris and\r\nthree-quarters of a _libra_ of vitriol. For each _libra_ there is poured\r\nover it one-sixth of a _libra_ of spring or river water, as to which,\r\nsince this pertains to all these compounds, it is sufficient to have\r\nmentioned once for all. The second composition is made from one _libra_\r\nof each of the following, artificial orpiment, vitriol, lime, alum, ash\r\nwhich the dyers of wool use, one quarter of a _libra_ of verdigris, and\r\none and a half _unciae_ of _stibium_. The third consists of three\r\n_librae_ of vitriol, one of saltpetre, half a _libra_ of asbestos, and\r\nhalf a _libra_ of baked bricks. The fourth consists of one _libra_ of\r\nsaltpetre, one _libra_ of alum, and half a _libra_ of sal-ammoniac.[6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 442 (Nitric Acid Making): A--Furnace.

L--Basket in which this is usually placed lest it be\r\nbroken.]\r\n\r\nThe furnace in which _aqua valens_ is made[7] is built of bricks,\r\nrectangular, two feet long and wide, and as many feet high and a half\r\nbesides. It is covered with iron plates supported with iron rods; these\r\nplates are smeared on the top with lute, and they have in the centre a\r\nround hole, large enough to hold the earthen vessel in which the glass\r\nampulla is placed, and on each side of the centre hole are two small\r\nround air-holes. The lower part of the furnace, in order to hold the\r\nburning charcoal, has iron plates at the height of a palm, likewise\r\nsupported by iron rods. In the middle of the front there is the mouth,\r\nmade for the purpose of putting the fire into the furnace; this mouth is\r\nhalf a foot high and wide, and rounded at the top, and under it is the\r\ndraught opening. Into the earthen vessel set over the hole is placed\r\nclean sand a digit deep, and in it the glass ampulla is set as deeply as\r\nit is smeared with lute. The lower quarter is smeared eight or ten times\r\nwith nearly liquid lute, each time to the thickness of a blade, and each\r\ntime it is dried again, until it has become as thick as the thumb; this\r\nkind of lute is well beaten with an iron rod, and is thoroughly mixed\r\nwith hair or cotton thread, or with wool and salt, that it should not\r\ncrackle. The many things of which the compounds are made must not fill\r\nthe ampulla completely, lest when boiling they rise into the operculum.\r\nThe operculum is likewise made of glass, and is closely joined to the\r\nampulla with linen, cemented with wheat flour and white of egg moistened\r\nwith water, and then lute free from salt is spread over that part of it.\r\nIn a similar way the spout of the operculum is joined by linen covered\r\nwith lute to another glass ampulla which receives the distilled _aqua_.\r\nA kind of thin iron nail or small wooden peg, a little thicker than a\r\nneedle, is fixed in this joint, in order that when air seems necessary\r\nto the artificer distilling by this process he can pull it out; this is\r\nnecessary when too much of the vapour has been driven into the upper\r\npart. The four air-holes which, as I have said, are on the top of the\r\nfurnace beside the large hole on which the ampulla is placed, are\r\nlikewise covered with lute.\r\n\r\nAll this preparation having been accomplished in order, and the\r\ningredients placed in the ampulla, they are gradually heated over\r\nburning charcoal until they begin to exhale vapour and the ampulla is\r\nseen to trickle with moisture. But when this, on account of the rising\r\nof the vapour, turns red, and the _aqua_ distils through the spout of\r\nthe operculum, then one must work with the utmost care, lest the drops\r\nshould fall at a quicker rate than one for every five movements of the\r\nclock or the striking of its bell, and not slower than one for every\r\nten; for if it falls faster the glasses will be broken, and if it drops\r\nmore slowly the work begun cannot be completed within the definite time,\r\nthat is within the space of twenty-four hours. To prevent the first\r\naccident, part of the coals are extracted by means of an iron implement\r\nsimilar to pincers; and in order to prevent the second happening, small\r\ndry pieces of oak are placed upon the coals, and the substances in the\r\nampulla are heated with a sharper fire, and the air-holes on the furnace\r\nare re-opened if need arise. As soon as the drops are being distilled,\r\nthe glass ampulla which receives them is covered with a piece of linen\r\nmoistened with water, in order that the powerful vapour which arises\r\nmay be repelled. When the ingredients have been heated and the ampulla\r\nin which they were placed is whitened with moisture, it is heated by a\r\nfiercer fire until all the drops have been distilled[8]. After the\r\nfurnace has cooled, the _aqua_ is filtered and poured into a small glass\r\nampulla, and into the same is put half a _drachma_ of silver[9], which\r\nwhen dissolved makes the turbid _aqua_ clear. This is poured into the\r\nampulla containing all the rest of the _aqua_, and as soon as the lees\r\nhave sunk to the bottom the _aqua_ is poured off, removed, and reserved\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nGold is parted from silver by the following method[10]. The alloy, with\r\nlead added to it, is first heated in a cupel until all the lead is\r\nexhaled, and eight ounces of the alloy contain only five _drachmae_ of\r\ncopper or at most six, for if there is more copper in it, the silver\r\nseparated from the gold soon unites with it again. Such molten silver\r\ncontaining gold is formed into granules, being stirred by means of a rod\r\nsplit at the lower end, or else is poured into an iron mould, and when\r\ncooled is made into thin leaves. As the process of making granules from\r\nargentiferous gold demands greater care and diligence than making them\r\nfrom any other metals, I will now explain the method briefly. The alloy\r\nis first placed in a crucible, which is then covered with a lid and\r\nplaced in another earthen crucible containing a few ashes. Then they are\r\nplaced in the furnace, and after they are surrounded by charcoal, the\r\nfire is blown by the blast of a bellows, and lest the charcoal fall away\r\nit is surrounded by stones or bricks. Soon afterward charcoal is thrown\r\nover the upper crucible and covered with live coals; these again are\r\ncovered with charcoal, so that the crucible is surrounded and covered on\r\nall sides with it. It is necessary to heat the crucibles with charcoal\r\nfor the space of half an hour or a little longer, and to provide that\r\nthere is no deficiency of charcoal, lest the alloy become chilled; after\r\nthis the air is blown in through the nozzle of the bellows, that the\r\ngold may begin to melt. Soon afterward it is turned round, and a test is\r\nquickly taken to see whether it be melted, and if it is melted, fluxes\r\nare thrown into it; it is advisable to cover up the crucible again\r\nclosely that the contents may not be exhaled. The contents are heated\r\ntogether for as long as it would take to walk fifteen paces, and then\r\nthe crucible is seized with tongs and the gold is emptied into an oblong\r\nvessel containing very cold water, by pouring it slowly from a height so\r\nthat the granules will not be too big; in proportion as they are\r\nlighter, more fine and more irregular, the better they are, therefore\r\nthe water is frequently stirred with a rod split into four parts from\r\nthe lower end to the middle.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are cut into small pieces, and they or the silver granules\r\nare put into a glass ampulla, and the _aqua_ is poured over them to a\r\nheight of a digit above the silver. The ampulla is covered with a\r\nbladder or with waxed linen, lest the contents exhale. Then it is heated\r\nuntil the silver is dissolved, the indication of which is the bubbling\r\nof the _aqua_. The gold remains in the bottom, of a blackish colour, and\r\nthe silver mixed with the _aqua_ floats above. Some pour the latter into\r\na copper bowl and pour into it cold water, which immediately congeals\r\nthe silver; this they take out and dry, having poured off the\r\n_aqua_[11]. They heat the dried silver in an earthenware crucible until\r\nit melts, and when it is melted they pour it into an iron mould.\r\n\r\nThe gold which remains in the ampulla they wash with warm water, filter,\r\ndry, and heat in a crucible with a little _chrysocolla_ which is called\r\nborax, and when it is melted they likewise pour it into an iron mould.\r\n\r\nSome workers, into an ampulla which contains gold and silver and the\r\n_aqua_ which separates them, pour two or three times as much of this\r\n_aqua valens_ warmed, and into the same ampulla or into a dish into\r\nwhich all is poured, throw fine leaves of black lead and copper; by this\r\nmeans the gold adheres to the lead and the silver to the copper, and\r\nseparately the lead from the gold, and separately the copper from the\r\nsilver, are parted in a cupel. But no method is approved by us which\r\nloses the _aqua_ used to part gold from silver, for it might be used\r\nagain[12].\r\n\r\n[Illustration 446 (Parting precious metals with nitric acid):\r\nA--Ampullae arranged in the vessels. B--An ampulla standing upright\r\nbetween iron rods. C--Ampullae placed in the sand which is contained in\r\na box, the spouts of which reach from the opercula into ampullae placed\r\nunder them. D--Ampullae likewise placed in sand which is contained in a\r\nbox, of which the spouts from the opercula extend crosswise into\r\nampullae placed under them. E--Other ampullae receiving the distilled\r\n_aqua_ and likewise arranged in sand contained in the lower boxes.\r\nF--Iron tripod, in which the ampulla is usually placed when there are\r\nnot many particles of gold to be parted from the silver. G--Vessel.]\r\n\r\nA glass ampulla, which bulges up inside at the bottom like a cone, is\r\ncovered on the lower part of the outside with lute in the way explained\r\nabove, and into it is put silver bullion weighing three and a half Roman\r\n_librae_. The _aqua_ which parts the one from the other is poured into\r\nit, and the ampulla is placed in sand contained in an earthen vessel, or\r\nin a box, that it may be warmed with a gentle fire. Lest the _aqua_\r\nshould be exhaled, the top of the ampulla is plastered on all sides with\r\nlute, and it is covered with a glass operculum, under whose spout is\r\nplaced another ampulla which receives the distilled drops; this receiver\r\nis likewise arranged in a box containing sand. When the contents are\r\nheated it reddens, but when the redness no longer appears to increase,\r\nit is taken out of the vessel or box and shaken; by this motion the\r\n_aqua_ becomes heated again and grows red; if this is done two or three\r\ntimes before other _aqua_ is added to it, the operation is sooner\r\nconcluded, and much less _aqua_ is consumed. When the first charge has\r\nall been distilled, as much silver as at first is again put into the\r\nampulla, for if too much were put in at once, the gold would be parted\r\nfrom it with difficulty. Then the second _aqua_ is poured in, but it is\r\nwarmed in order that it and the ampulla may be of equal temperature, so\r\nthat the latter may not be cracked by the cold; also if a cold wind\r\nblows on it, it is apt to crack. Then the third _aqua_ is poured in, and\r\nalso if circumstances require it, the fourth, that is to say more _aqua_\r\nand again more is poured in until the gold assumes the colour of burned\r\nbrick. The artificer keeps in hand two _aquae_, one of which is stronger\r\nthan the other; the stronger is used at first, then the less strong,\r\nthen at the last again the stronger. When the gold becomes of a reddish\r\nyellow colour, spring water is poured in and heated until it boils. The\r\ngold is washed four times and then heated in the crucible until it\r\nmelts. The water with which it was washed is put back, for there is a\r\nlittle silver in it; for this reason it is poured into an ampulla and\r\nheated, and the drops first distilled are received by one ampulla, while\r\nthose which come later, that is to say when the operculum begins to get\r\nred, fall into another. This latter _aqua_ is useful for testing the\r\ngold, the former for washing it; the former may also be poured over the\r\ningredients from which the _aqua valens_ is made.\r\n\r\nThe _aqua_ that was first distilled, which contains the silver, is\r\npoured into an ampulla wide at the base, the top of which is also\r\nsmeared with lute and covered by an operculum, and is then boiled as\r\nbefore in order that it may be separated from the silver. If there be so\r\nmuch _aqua_ that (when boiled) it rises into the operculum, there is\r\nput into the ampulla one lozenge or two; these are made of soap, cut\r\ninto small pieces and mixed together with powdered argol, and then\r\nheated in a pot over a gentle fire; or else the contents are stirred\r\nwith a hazel twig split at the bottom, and in both cases the _aqua_\r\neffervesces, and soon after again settles. When the powerful vapour\r\nappears, the _aqua_ gives off a kind of oil, and the operculum becomes\r\nred. But, lest the vapours should escape from the ampulla and the\r\noperculum in that part where their mouths communicate, they are entirely\r\nsealed all round. The _aqua_ is boiled continually over a fiercer fire,\r\nand enough charcoal must be put into the furnace so that the live coals\r\ntouch the vessel. The ampulla is taken out as soon as all the _aqua_ has\r\nbeen distilled, and the silver, which is dried by the heat of the fire,\r\nalone remains in it; the silver is shaken out and put in an earthenware\r\ncrucible, and heated until it melts. The molten glass is extracted with\r\nan iron rod curved at the lower end, and the silver is made into cakes.\r\nThe glass extracted from the crucible is ground to powder, and to this\r\nare added litharge, argol, glass-galls, and saltpetre, and they are\r\nmelted in an earthen crucible. The button that settles is transferred to\r\nthe cupel and re-melted.\r\n\r\nIf the silver was not sufficiently dried by the heat of the fire, that\r\nwhich is contained in the upper part of the ampulla will appear black;\r\nthis when melted will be consumed. When the lute, which was smeared\r\nround the lower part of the ampulla, has been removed, it is placed in\r\nthe crucible and is re-melted, until at last there is no more appearance\r\nof black[13].\r\n\r\nIf to the first _aqua_ the other which contains silver is to be added,\r\nit must be poured in before the powerful vapours appear, and the _aqua_\r\ngives off the oily substance, and the operculum becomes red; for he who\r\npours in the _aqua_ after the vapour appears causes a loss, because the\r\n_aqua_ generally spurts out and the glass breaks. If the ampulla breaks\r\nwhen the gold is being parted from the silver or the silver from the\r\n_aqua_, the _aqua_ will be absorbed by the sand or the lute or the\r\nbricks, whereupon, without any delay, the red hot coals should be taken\r\nout of the furnace and the fire extinguished. The sand and bricks after\r\nbeing crushed should be thrown into a copper vessel, warm water should\r\nbe poured over them, and they should be put aside for the space of\r\ntwelve hours; afterward the water should be strained through a canvas,\r\nand the canvas, since it contains silver, should be dried by the heat of\r\nthe sun or the fire, and then placed in an earthen crucible and heated\r\nuntil the silver melts, this being poured out into an iron mould. The\r\nstrained water should be poured into an ampulla and separated from the\r\nsilver, of which it contains a minute portion; the sand should be mixed\r\nwith litharge, glass-galls, argol, saltpetre, and salt, and heated in an\r\nearthen crucible. The button which settles at the bottom should be\r\ntransferred to a cupel, and should be re-melted, in order that the lead\r\nmay be separated from the silver. The lute, with lead added, should be\r\nheated in an earthen crucible, then re-melted in a cupel.\r\n\r\nWe also separate silver from gold by the same method when we assay them.\r\nFor this purpose the alloy is first rubbed against a touchstone, in\r\norder to learn what proportion of silver there is in it; then as much\r\nsilver as is necessary is added to the argentiferous gold, in a _bes_ of\r\nwhich there must be less than a _semi-uncia_ or a _semi-uncia_ and a\r\n_sicilicus_[14] of copper. After lead has been added, it is melted in a\r\ncupel until the lead and the copper have exhaled, then the alloy of gold\r\nwith silver is flattened out, and little tubes are made of the leaves;\r\nthese are put into a glass ampulla, and strong _aqua_ is poured over\r\nthem two or three times. The tubes after this are absolutely pure, with\r\nthe exception of only a quarter of a _siliqua_, which is silver; for\r\nonly this much silver remains in eight _unciae_ of gold[15].\r\n\r\nAs great expense is incurred in parting the metals by the methods that\r\nI have explained, as night vigils are necessary when _aqua valens_ is\r\nmade, and as generally much labour and great pains have to be expended\r\non this matter, other methods for parting have been invented by clever\r\nmen, which are less costly, less laborious, and in which there is less\r\nloss if through carelessness an error is made. There are three methods,\r\nthe first performed with sulphur, the second with antimony, the third by\r\nmeans of some compound which consists of these or other ingredients.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 449 (Parting precious metals with sulphur): A--Pot.\r\nB--Circular fire. C--Crucibles. D--Their lids. E--Lid of the pot.\r\nF--Furnace. G--Iron rod.]\r\n\r\nIn the first method,[16] the silver containing some gold is melted in a\r\ncrucible and made into granules. For every _libra_ of granules, there is\r\ntaken a sixth of a _libra_ and a _sicilicus_ of sulphur (not exposed to\r\nthe fire); this, when crushed, is sprinkled over the moistened granules,\r\nand then they are put into a new earthen pot of the capacity of four\r\n_sextarii_, or into several of them if there is an abundance of\r\ngranules. The pot, having been filled, is covered with an earthen lid\r\nand smeared over, and placed within a circle of fire set one and a half\r\nfeet distant from the pot on all sides, in order that the sulphur added\r\nto the silver should not be distilled when melted. The pot is opened,\r\nthe black-coloured granules are taken out, and afterward thirty-three\r\n_librae_ of these granules are placed in an earthen crucible, if it has\r\nsuch capacity. For every _libra_ of silver granules, weighed before they\r\nwere sprinkled with sulphur, there is weighed out also a sixth of a\r\n_libra_ and a _sicilicus_ of copper, if each _libra_ consists either of\r\nthree-quarters of a _libra_ of silver and a quarter of a _libra_ of\r\ncopper, or of three-quarters of a _libra_ and a _semi-uncia_ of silver\r\nand a sixth of a _libra_ and a _semi-uncia_ of copper. If, however, the\r\nsilver contains five-sixths of a _libra_ of silver and a sixth of a\r\n_libra_ of copper, or five-sixths of a _libra_ and a _semi-uncia_ of\r\nsilver and an _uncia_ and a half of copper, then there are weighed out a\r\nquarter of a _libra_ of copper granules. If a _libra_ contains\r\neleven-twelfths of a _libra_ of silver and one _uncia_ of copper, or\r\neleven-twelfths and a _semi-uncia_ of silver and a _semi-uncia_ of\r\ncopper, then are weighed out a quarter of a _libra_ and a _semi-uncia_\r\nand a _sicilicus_ of copper granules. Lastly, if there is only pure\r\nsilver, then as much as a third of a _libra_ and a _semi-uncia_ of\r\ncopper granules are added. Half of these copper granules are added soon\r\nafterward to the black-coloured silver granules. The crucible should be\r\ntightly covered and smeared over with lute, and placed in a furnace,\r\ninto which the air is drawn through the draught-holes. As soon as the\r\nsilver is melted, the crucible is opened, and there is placed in it a\r\nheaped ladleful more of granulated copper, and also a heaped ladleful of\r\na powder which consists of equal parts of litharge, of granulated lead,\r\nof salt, and of glass-galls; then the crucible is again covered with the\r\nlid. When the copper granules are melted, more are put in, together with\r\nthe powder, until all have been put in.\r\n\r\nA little of the regulus is taken from the crucible, but not from the\r\ngold lump which has settled at the bottom, and a _drachma_ of it is put\r\ninto each of the cupels, which contain an _uncia_ of molten lead; there\r\nshould be many of these cupels. In this way half a _drachma_ of silver\r\nis made. As soon as the lead and copper have been separated from the\r\nsilver, a third of it is thrown into a glass ampulla, and _aqua valens_\r\nis poured over it. By this method is shown whether the sulphur has\r\nparted all the gold from the silver, or not. If one wishes to know the\r\nsize of the gold lump which has settled at the bottom of the crucible,\r\nan iron rod moistened with water is covered with chalk, and when the rod\r\nis dry it is pushed down straight into the crucible, and the rod remains\r\nbright to the height of the gold lump; the remaining part of the rod is\r\ncoloured black by the regulus, which adheres to the rod if it is not\r\nquickly removed.\r\n\r\nIf when the rod has been extracted the gold is observed to be\r\nsatisfactorily parted from the silver, the regulus is poured out, the\r\ngold button is taken out of the crucible, and in some clean place the\r\nregulus is chipped off from it, although it usually flies apart. The\r\nlump itself is reduced to granules, and for every _libra_ of this gold\r\nthey weigh out a quarter of a _libra_ each of crushed sulphur and of\r\ngranular copper, and all are placed together in an earthen crucible, not\r\ninto a pot. When they are melted, in order that the gold may more\r\nquickly settle at the bottom, the powder which I have mentioned is\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nAlthough minute particles of gold appear to scintillate in the regulus\r\nof copper and silver, yet if all that are in a _libra_ do not weigh as\r\nmuch as a single sesterce, then the sulphur has satisfactorily parted\r\nthe gold from the silver; but if it should weigh a sesterce or more,\r\nthen the regulus is thrown back again into the earthen crucible, and it\r\nis not advantageous to add sulphur, but only a little copper and powder,\r\nby which method a gold lump is again made to settle at the bottom; and\r\nthis one is added to the other button which is not rich in gold.\r\n\r\nWhen gold is parted from sixty-six _librae_ of silver, the silver,\r\ncopper, and sulphur regulus weighs one hundred and thirty-two _librae_.\r\nTo separate the copper from the silver we require five hundred _librae_\r\nof lead, more or less, with which the regulus is melted in the second\r\nfurnace. In this manner litharge and hearth-lead are made, which are\r\nre-smelted in the first furnace. The cakes that are made from these are\r\nplaced in the third furnace, so that the lead may be separated from the\r\ncopper and used again, for it contains very little silver. The crucibles\r\nand their covers are crushed, washed, and the sediment is melted\r\ntogether with litharge and hearth-lead.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to separate all the silver from the gold by this method\r\nleave one part of gold to three of silver, and then reduce the alloy to\r\ngranules. Then they place it in an ampulla, and by pouring _aqua valens_\r\nover it, part the gold from the silver, which process I explained in\r\nBook VII.\r\n\r\nIf sulphur from the lye with which _sal artificiosus_ is made, is strong\r\nenough to float an egg thrown into it, and is boiled until it no longer\r\nemits fumes, and melts when placed upon glowing coals, then, if such\r\nsulphur is thrown into the melted silver, it parts the gold from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 453 (Parting precious metals with antimony): A--Furnace in\r\nwhich the air is drawn in through holes. B--Goldsmith's forge.\r\nC--Earthen crucibles. D--Iron pots. E--Block.]\r\n\r\nSilver is also parted from gold by means of _stibium_[17]. If in a _bes\r\nof_ gold there are seven, or six, or five double _sextulae_ of silver,\r\nthen three parts of _stibium_ are added to one part of gold; but in\r\norder that the _stibium_ should not consume the gold, it is melted with\r\ncopper in a red hot earthen crucible. If the gold contains some portion\r\nof copper, then to eight _unciae_ of _stibium_ a _sicilicus_ of copper\r\nis added; and if it contains no copper, then half an _uncia_, because\r\ncopper must be added to _stibium_ in order to part gold from silver. The\r\ngold is first placed in a red hot earthen crucible, and when melted it\r\nswells, and a little _stibium_ is added to it lest it run over; in a\r\nshort space of time, when this has melted, it likewise again swells, and\r\nwhen this occurs it is advisable to put in all the remainder of the\r\n_stibium_, and to cover the crucible with a lid, and then to heat the\r\nmixture for the time required to walk thirty-five paces. Then it is at\r\nonce poured out into an iron pot, wide at the top and narrow at the\r\nbottom, which was first heated and smeared over with tallow or wax, and\r\nset on an iron or wooden block. It is shaken violently, and by this\r\nagitation the gold lump settles to the bottom, and when the pot has\r\ncooled it is tapped loose, and is again melted four times in the same\r\nway. But each time a less weight of _stibium_ is added to the gold,\r\nuntil finally only twice as much _stibium_ is added as there is gold, or\r\na little more; then the gold lump is melted in a cupel. The _stibium_ is\r\nmelted again three or four times in an earthen crucible, and each time a\r\ngold lump settles, so that there are three or four gold lumps, and these\r\nare all melted together in a cupel.\r\n\r\nTo two _librae_ and a half of such _stibium_ are added two _librae_ of\r\nargol and one _libra_ of glass-galls, and they are melted in an earthen\r\ncrucible, where a lump likewise settles at the bottom; this lump is\r\nmelted in the cupel. Finally, the _stibium_ with a little lead added, is\r\nmelted in the cupel, in which, after all the rest has been consumed by\r\nthe fire, the silver alone remains. If the _stibium_ is not first melted\r\nin an earthen crucible with argol and glass-galls, before it is melted\r\nin the cupel, part of the silver is consumed, and is absorbed by the ash\r\nand powder of which the cupel is made.\r\n\r\nThe crucible in which the gold and silver alloy are melted with\r\n_stibium_, and also the cupel, are placed in a furnace, which is usually\r\nof the kind in which the air is drawn in through holes; or else they\r\nare placed in a goldsmith's forge.\r\n\r\nJust as _aqua valens_ poured over silver, from which the sulphur has\r\nparted the gold, shows us whether all has been separated or whether\r\nparticles of gold remain in the silver; so do certain ingredients, if\r\nplaced in the pot or crucible \"alternately\" with the gold, from which\r\nthe silver has been parted by _stibium_, and heated, show us whether all\r\nhave been separated or not.\r\n\r\nWe use cements[18] when, without _stibium_, we part silver or copper or\r\nboth so ingeniously and admirably from gold. There are various cements.\r\nSome consist of half a _libra_ of brick dust, a quarter of a _libra_ of\r\nsalt, an _uncia_ of saltpetre, half an _uncia_ of sal-ammoniac, and half\r\nan _uncia_ of rock salt. The bricks or tiles from which the dust is made\r\nmust be composed of fatty clays, free from sand, grit, and small stones,\r\nand must be moderately burnt and very old.\r\n\r\nAnother cement is made of a _bes_ of brick dust, a third of rock salt,\r\nan _uncia_ of saltpetre, and half an _uncia_ of refined salt. Another\r\ncement is made of a _bes_ of brick dust, a quarter of refined salt, one\r\nand a half _unciae_ of saltpetre, an _uncia_ of sal-ammoniac, and half\r\nan _uncia_ of rock salt. Another has one _libra_ of brick dust, and half\r\na _libra_ of rock salt, to which some add a sixth of a _libra_ and a\r\n_sicilicus_ of vitriol. Another is made of half a _libra_ of brick dust,\r\na third of a _libra_ of rock salt, an _uncia_ and a half of vitriol, and\r\none _uncia_ of saltpetre. Another consists of a _bes_ of brick dust, a\r\nthird of refined salt, a sixth of white vitriol[19], half an _uncia_ of\r\nverdigris, and likewise half an _uncia_ of saltpetre. Another is made of\r\none and a third _librae_ of brick dust, a _bes_ of rock salt, a sixth of\r\na _libra_ and half an _uncia_ of sal-ammoniac, a sixth and half an\r\n_uncia_ of vitriol, and a sixth of saltpetre. Another contains a _libra_\r\nof brick dust, a third of refined salt, and one and a half _unciae_ of\r\nvitriol.\r\n\r\nThose ingredients above are peculiar to each cement, but what follows\r\nis common to all. Each of the ingredients is first separately crushed to\r\npowder; the bricks are placed on a hard rock or marble, and crushed with\r\nan iron implement; the other things are crushed in a mortar with a\r\npestle; each is separately passed through a sieve. Then they are all\r\nmixed together, and are moistened with vinegar in which a little\r\nsal-ammoniac has been dissolved, if the cement does not contain any. But\r\nsome workers, however, prefer to moisten the gold granules or gold-leaf\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nThe cement should be placed, alternately with the gold, in new and clean\r\npots in which no water has ever been poured. In the bottom the cement is\r\nlevelled with an iron implement, and afterward the gold granules or\r\nleaves are placed one against the other, so that they may touch it on\r\nall sides; then, again, a handful of the cement, or more if the pots are\r\nlarge, is thrown in and levelled with an iron implement; the granules\r\nand leaves are laid over this in the same manner, and this is repeated\r\nuntil the pot is filled. Then it is covered with a lid, and the place\r\nwhere they join is smeared over with artificial lute, and when this is\r\ndry the pots are placed in the furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 455 (Parting precious metals by cementation): A--Furnace.\r\nB--Pot. C--Lid. D--Air-holes.]\r\n\r\nThe furnace has three chambers, the lowest of which is a foot high; into\r\nthis lowest chamber the air penetrates through an opening, and into it\r\nthe ashes fall from the burnt wood, which is supported by iron rods,\r\narranged to form a grating. The middle chamber is two feet high, and the\r\nwood is pushed in through its mouth. The wood ought to be oak, holmoak,\r\nor turkey-oak, for from these the slow and lasting fire is made which is\r\nnecessary for this operation. The upper chamber is open at the top so\r\nthat the pots, for which it has the depth, may be put into it; the floor\r\nof this chamber consists of iron rods, so strong that they may bear the\r\nweight of the pots and the heat of the fire; they are sufficiently far\r\napart that the fire may penetrate well and may heat the pots. The pots\r\nare narrow at the bottom, so that the fire entering into the space\r\nbetween them may heat them; at the top the pots are wide, so that they\r\nmay touch and hold back the heat of the fire. The upper part of the\r\nfurnace is closed in with bricks not very thick, or with tiles and lute,\r\nand two or three air-holes are left, through which the fumes and flames\r\nmay escape.\r\n\r\nThe gold granules or leaves and the cement, alternately placed in the\r\npots, are heated by a gentle fire, gradually increasing for twenty-four\r\nhours, if the furnace was heated for two hours before the full pots were\r\nstood in it, and if this was not done, then for twenty-six hours. The\r\nfire should be increased in such a manner that the pieces of gold and\r\nthe cement, in which is the potency to separate the silver and copper\r\nfrom the gold, may not melt, for in this case the labour and cost will\r\nbe spent in vain; therefore, it is ample to have the fire hot enough\r\nthat the pots always remain red. After so many hours all the burning\r\nwood should be drawn out of the furnace. Then the refractory bricks or\r\ntiles are removed from the top of the furnace, and the glowing pots are\r\ntaken out with the tongs. The lids are removed, and if there is time it\r\nis well to allow the gold to cool by itself, for then there is less\r\nloss; but if time cannot be spared for that operation, the pieces of\r\ngold are immediately placed separately into a wooden or bronze vessel of\r\nwater and gradually quenched, lest the cement which absorbs the silver\r\nshould exhale it. The pieces of gold, and the cement adhering to them,\r\nwhen cooled or quenched, are rolled with a little mallet so as to crush\r\nthe lumps and free the gold from the cement. Then they are sifted by a\r\nfine sieve, which is placed over a bronze vessel; in this manner the\r\ncement containing the silver or the copper or both, falls from the sieve\r\ninto the bronze vessel, and the gold granules or leaves remain on it.\r\nThe gold is placed in a vessel and again rolled with the little mallet,\r\nso that it may be cleansed from the cement which absorbs silver and\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\nThe particles of cement, which have dropped through the holes of the\r\nsieve into the bronze vessel, are washed in a bowl, over a wooden tub,\r\nbeing shaken about with the hands, so that the minute particles of gold\r\nwhich have fallen through the sieve may be separated. These are again\r\nwashed in a little vessel, with warm water, and scrubbed with a piece of\r\nwood or a twig broom, that the moistened cement may be detached.\r\nAfterward all the gold is again washed with warm water, and collected\r\nwith a bristle brush, and should be washed in a copper full of holes,\r\nunder which is placed a little vessel. Then it is necessary to put the\r\ngold on an iron plate, under which is a vessel, and to wash it with\r\nwarm water. Finally, it is placed in a bowl, and, when dry, the granules\r\nor leaves are rubbed against a touchstone at the same time as a\r\ntouch-needle, and considered carefully as to whether they be pure or\r\nalloyed. If they are not pure enough, the granules or the leaves,\r\ntogether with the cement which attracts silver and copper, are arranged\r\nalternately in layers in the same manner, and again heated; this is done\r\nas often as is necessary, but the last time it is heated as many hours\r\nas are required to cleanse the gold.\r\n\r\nSome people add another cement to the granules or leaves. This cement\r\nlacks the ingredients of metalliferous origin, such as verdigris and\r\nvitriol, for if these are in the cement, the gold usually takes up a\r\nlittle of the base metal; or if it does not do this, it is stained by\r\nthem. For this reason some very rightly never make use of cements\r\ncontaining these things, because brick dust and salt alone, especially\r\nrock salt, are able to extract all the silver and copper from the gold\r\nand to attract it to themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for coiners to make absolutely pure gold, but to\r\nheat it only until such a fineness is obtained as is needed for the gold\r\nmoney which they are coining.\r\n\r\nThe gold is heated, and when it shows the necessary golden yellow colour\r\nand is wholly pure, it is melted and made into bars, in which case they\r\nare either prepared by the coiners with _chrysocolla_, which is called\r\nby the Moors borax, or are prepared with salt of lye made from the ashes\r\nof ivy or of other salty herbs.\r\n\r\nThe cement which has absorbed silver or copper, after water has been\r\npoured over it, is dried and crushed, and when mixed with hearth-lead\r\nand de-silverized lead, is smelted in the blast furnace. The alloy of\r\nsilver and lead, or of silver and copper and lead, which flows out, is\r\nagain melted in the cupellation furnace, in order that the lead and\r\ncopper may be separated from the silver. The silver is finally\r\nthoroughly purified in the refining furnace, and in this practical\r\nmanner there is no silver lost, or only a minute quantity.\r\n\r\nThere are besides this, certain other cements[20] which part gold from\r\nsilver, composed of sulphur, _stibium_ and other ingredients. One of\r\nthese compounds consists of half an _uncia_ of vitriol dried by the heat\r\nof the fire and reduced to powder, a sixth of refined salt, a third of\r\n_stibium_, half a _libra_ of prepared sulphur (not exposed to the\r\nfire), one _sicilicus_ of glass, likewise one _sicilicus_ of saltpetre,\r\nand a _drachma_ of sal-ammoniac.[21] The sulphur is prepared as follows:\r\nit is first crushed to powder, then it is heated for six hours in sharp\r\nvinegar, and finally poured into a vessel and washed with warm water;\r\nthen that which settles at the bottom of the vessel is dried. To refine\r\nthe salt it is placed in river water and boiled, and again evaporated.\r\nThe second compound contains one _libra_ of sulphur (not exposed to\r\nfire) and two _librae_ of refined salt. The third compound is made from\r\none _libra_ of sulphur (not exposed to the fire), half a _libra_ of\r\nrefined salt, a quarter of a _libra_ of sal-ammoniac, and one _uncia_ of\r\nred-lead. The fourth compound consists of one _libra_ each of refined\r\nsalt, sulphur (not exposed to the fire) and argol, and half a _libra_ of\r\n_chrysocolla_ which the Moors call borax. The fifth compound has equal\r\nproportions of sulphur (not exposed to the fire), sal-ammoniac,\r\nsaltpetre, and verdigris.\r\n\r\nThe silver which contains some portion of gold is first melted with lead\r\nin an earthen crucible, and they are heated together until the silver\r\nexhales the lead. If there was a _libra_ of silver, there must be six\r\n_drachmae_ of lead. Then the silver is sprinkled with two _unciae_ of\r\nthat powdered compound and is stirred; afterward it is poured into\r\nanother crucible, first warmed and lined with tallow, and then violently\r\nshaken. The rest is performed according to the process I have already\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nGold may be parted without injury from silver goblets and from other\r\ngilt vessels and articles[22], by means of a powder, which consists of\r\none part of sal-ammoniac and half a part of sulphur. The gilt goblet or\r\nother article is smeared with oil, and the powder is dusted on; the\r\narticle is seized in the hand, or with tongs, and is carried to the fire\r\nand sharply tapped, and by this means the gold falls into water in\r\nvessels placed underneath, while the goblet remains uninjured.\r\n\r\nGold is also parted from silver on gilt articles by means of\r\nquicksilver. This is poured into an earthen crucible, and so warmed by\r\nthe fire that the finger can bear the heat when dipped into it; the\r\nsilver-gilt objects are placed in it, and when the quicksilver adheres\r\nto them they are taken out and placed on a dish, into which, when\r\ncooled, the gold falls, together with the quicksilver. Again and\r\nfrequently the same silver-gilt object is placed in heated quicksilver,\r\nand the same process is continued until at last no more gold is visible\r\non the object; then the object is placed in the fire, and the\r\nquicksilver which adheres to it is exhaled. Then the artificer takes a\r\nhare's foot, and brushes up into a dish the quicksilver and the gold\r\nwhich have fallen together from the silver article, and puts them into\r\na cloth made of woven cotton or into a soft leather; the quicksilver is\r\nsqueezed through one or the other into another dish.[23] The gold\r\nremains in the cloth or the leather, and when collected is placed in a\r\npiece of charcoal hollowed out, and is heated until it melts, and a\r\nlittle button is made from it. This button is heated with a little\r\n_stibium_ in an earthen crucible and poured out into another little\r\nvessel, by which method the gold settles at the bottom, and the\r\n_stibium_ is seen to be on the top; then the work is completed. Finally,\r\nthe gold button is put in a hollowed-out brick and placed in the fire,\r\nand by this method the gold is made pure. By means of the above methods\r\ngold is parted from silver and also silver from gold.\r\n\r\nNow I will explain the methods used to separate copper from gold[24].\r\nThe salt which we call _sal-artificiosus_,[25] is made from a _libra_\r\neach of vitriol, alum, saltpetre, and sulphur not exposed to the fire,\r\nand half a _libra_ of sal-ammoniac; these ingredients when crushed are\r\nheated with one part of lye made from the ashes used by wool dyers, one\r\npart of unslaked lime, and four parts of beech ashes. The ingredients\r\nare boiled in the lye until the whole has been dissolved. Then it is\r\nimmediately dried and kept in a hot place, lest it turn into oil; and\r\nafterward when crushed, a _libra_ of lead-ash is mixed with it. With\r\neach _libra_ of this powdered compound one and a half _unciae_ of the\r\ncopper is gradually sprinkled into a hot crucible, and it is stirred\r\nrapidly and frequently with an iron rod. When the crucible has cooled\r\nand been broken up, the button of gold is found.\r\n\r\nThe second method for parting is the following. Two _librae_ of sulphur\r\nnot exposed to the fire, and four _librae_ of refined salt are crushed\r\nand mixed; a sixth of a _libra_ and half an _uncia_ of this powder is\r\nadded to a _bes_ of granules made of lead, and twice as much copper\r\ncontaining gold; they are heated together in an earthen crucible until\r\nthey melt. When cooled, the button is taken out and purged of slag. From\r\nthis button they again make granules, to a third of a _libra_ of which\r\nis added half a _libra_ of that powder of which I have spoken, and they\r\nare placed in alternate layers in the crucible; it is well to cover the\r\ncrucible and to seal it up, and afterward it is heated over a gentle\r\nfire until the granules melt. Soon afterward, the crucible is taken off\r\nthe fire, and when it is cool the button is extracted. From this, when\r\npurified and again melted down, the third granules are made, to which,\r\nif they weigh a sixth of a _libra_, is added one half an _uncia_ and a\r\n_sicilicus_ of the powder, and they are heated in the same manner, and\r\nthe button of gold settles at the bottom of the crucible.\r\n\r\nThe third method is as follows. From time to time small pieces of\r\nsulphur, enveloped in or mixed with wax, are dropped into six _librae_\r\nof the molten copper, and consumed; the sulphur weighs half an _uncia_\r\nand a _sicilicus_. Then one and a half _sicilici_ of powdered saltpetre\r\nare dropped into the same copper and likewise consumed; then again half\r\nan _uncia_ and a _sicilicus_ of sulphur enveloped in wax; afterward one\r\nand a half _sicilici_ of lead-ash enveloped in wax, or of minium made\r\nfrom red-lead. Then immediately the copper is taken out, and to the gold\r\nbutton, which is now mixed with only a little copper, they add _stibium_\r\nto double the amount of the button; these are heated together until the\r\n_stibium_ is driven off; then the button, together with lead of half the\r\nweight of the button, are heated in a cupel. Finally, the gold is taken\r\nout of this and quenched, and if there is a blackish colour settled in\r\nit, it is melted with a little of the _chrysocolla_ which the Moors call\r\nborax; if too pale, it is melted with _stibium_, and acquires its own\r\ngolden-yellow colour. There are some who take out the molten copper with\r\nan iron ladle and pour it into another crucible, whose aperture is\r\nsealed up with lute, and they place it over glowing charcoal, and when\r\nthey have thrown in the powders of which I have spoken, they stir the\r\nwhole mass rapidly with an iron rod, and thus separate the gold from the\r\ncopper; the former settles at the bottom of the crucible, the latter\r\nfloats on the top. Then the aperture of the crucible is opened with the\r\nred-hot tongs, and the copper runs out. The gold which remains is\r\nre-heated with _stibium_, and when this is exhaled the gold is heated\r\nfor the third time in a cupel with a fourth part of lead, and then\r\nquenched.\r\n\r\nThe fourth method is to melt one and a third _librae_ of the copper with\r\na sixth of a _libra_ of lead, and to pour it into another crucible\r\nsmeared on the inside with tallow or gypsum; and to this is added a\r\npowder consisting of half an _uncia_ each of prepared sulphur,\r\nverdigris, and saltpetre, and an _uncia_ and a half of _sal coctus_. The\r\nfifth method consists of placing in a crucible one _libra_ of the copper\r\nand two _librae_ of granulated lead, with one and a half _unciae_ of\r\n_sal-artificiosus_; they are at first heated over a gentle fire and then\r\nover a fiercer one. The sixth method consists in heating together a\r\n_bes_ of the copper and one-sixth of a _libra_ each of sulphur, salt,\r\nand _stibium_. The seventh method consists of heating together a _bes_\r\nof the copper and one-sixth each of iron scales and filings, salt,\r\n_stibium_, and glass-galls. The eighth method consists of heating\r\ntogether one _libra_ of the copper, one and a half _librae_ of sulphur,\r\nhalf a _libra_ of verdigris, and a _libra_ of refined salt. The ninth\r\nmethod consists of placing in one _libra_ of the molten copper as much\r\npounded sulphur, not exposed to the fire, and of stirring it rapidly\r\nwith an iron rod; the lump is ground to powder, into which quicksilver\r\nis poured, and this attracts to itself the gold.\r\n\r\nGilded copper articles are moistened with water and placed on the fire,\r\nand when they are glowing they are quenched with cold water, and the\r\ngold is scraped off with a brass rod. By these practical methods gold is\r\nseparated from copper.\r\n\r\nEither copper or lead is separated from silver by the methods which I\r\nwill now explain.[26] This is carried on in a building near by the\r\nworks, or in the works in which the gold or silver ores or alloys are\r\nsmelted. The middle wall of such a building is twenty-one feet long and\r\nfifteen feet high, and from this a front wall is distant fifteen feet\r\ntoward the river; the rear wall is nineteen feet distant, and both\r\nthese walls are thirty-six feet long and fourteen feet high; a\r\ntransverse wall extends from the end of the front wall to the end of the\r\nrear wall; then fifteen feet back a second transverse wall is built out\r\nfrom the front wall to the end of the middle wall. In that space which\r\nis between those two transverse walls are set up the stamps, by means of\r\nwhich the ores and the necessary ingredients for smelting are broken up.\r\nFrom the further end of the front wall, a third transverse wall leads to\r\nthe other end of the middle wall, and from the same to the end of the\r\nrear wall. The space between the second and third transverse walls, and\r\nbetween the rear and middle long walls, contains the cupellation\r\nfurnace, in which lead is separated from gold or silver. The vertical\r\nwall of its chimney is erected upon the middle wall, and the sloping\r\nchimney-wall rests on the beams which extend from the second transverse\r\nwall to the third; these are so located that they are at a distance of\r\nthirteen feet from the middle long wall and four from the rear wall, and\r\nthey are two feet wide and thick. From the ground up to the roof-beams\r\nis twelve feet, and lest the sloping chimney-wall should fall down, it\r\nis partly supported by means of many iron rods, and partly by means of a\r\nfew tie-beams covered with lute, which extend from the small beams of\r\nthe sloping chimney-wall to the beams of the vertical chimney-wall. The\r\nrear roof is arranged in the same way as the roof of the works in which\r\nore is smelted. In the space between the middle and the front long walls\r\nand between the second[27] and the third transverse walls are the\r\nbellows, the machinery for depressing and the instrument for raising\r\nthem. A drum on the axle of a water-wheel has rundles which turn the\r\ntoothed drum of an axle, whose long cams depress the levers of the\r\nbellows, and also another toothed drum on an axle, whose cams raise the\r\ntappets of the stamps, but in the opposite direction. So that if the\r\ncams which depress the levers of the bellows turn from north to south,\r\nthe cams of the stamps turn from south to north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 468 (Cupellation Furnace): A--Rectangular stones.\r\nB--Sole-stone.

O--Chains.]\r\n\r\nLead is separated from gold or silver in a cupellation furnace, of which\r\nthe structure consists of rectangular stones, of two interior walls of\r\nwhich the one intersects the other transversely, of a round sole, and of\r\na dome. Its crucible is made from powder of earth and ash; but I will\r\nfirst speak of the structure and also of the rectangular stones. A\r\ncircular wall is built four feet and three palms high, and one foot\r\nthick; from the height of two feet and three palms from the bottom, the\r\nupper part of the interior is cut away to the width of one palm, so that\r\nthe stone sole may rest upon it. There are usually as many as fourteen\r\nstones; on the outside they are a foot and a palm wide, and on the\r\ninside narrower, because the inner circle is much smaller than the\r\nouter; if the stones are wider, fewer are required, if narrower more;\r\nthey are sunk into the earth to a depth of a foot and a palm. At the top\r\neach one is joined to the next by an iron staple, the points of which\r\nare embedded in holes, and into each hole is poured molten lead. This\r\nstone structure has six air-holes near the ground, at a height of a foot\r\nabove the ground; they are two feet and a palm from the bottom of the\r\nstones; each of these air-holes is in two stones, and is two palms high,\r\nand a palm and three digits wide. One of them is on the right side,\r\nbetween the wall which protects the main wall from the fire, and the\r\nchannel through which the litharge flows out of the furnace crucible;\r\nthe other five air-holes are distributed all round at equal distances\r\napart; through these escapes the moisture which the earth exhales when\r\nheated, and if it were not for these openings the crucible would absorb\r\nthe moisture and be damaged. In such a case a lump would be raised, like\r\nthat which a mole throws up from the earth, and the ash would float on\r\nthe top, and the crucible would absorb the silver-lead alloy; there are\r\nsome who, because of this, make the rear part of the structure entirely\r\nopen. The two inner walls, of which one intersects the other, are built\r\nof bricks, and are a brick in thickness. There are four air-holes in\r\nthese, one in each part, which are about one digit's breadth higher and\r\nwider than the others. Into the four compartments is thrown a\r\nwheelbarrowful of slag, and over this is placed a large wicker basket\r\nfull of charcoal dust. These walls extend a cubit above the ground, and\r\non these, and on the ledge cut in the rectangular stones, is placed the\r\nstone sole; this sole is a palm and three digits thick, and on all sides\r\ntouches the rectangular stones; if there are any cracks in it they are\r\nfilled up with fragments of stone or brick. The front part of the sole\r\nis sloped so that a channel can be made, through which the litharge\r\nflows out. Copper plates are placed on this part of the sole-stone so\r\nthat the silver-lead or other alloy may be more rapidly heated.\r\n\r\nA dome which has the shape of half a sphere covers the crucible. It\r\nconsists of iron bands and of bars and of a lid. There are three bands,\r\neach about a palm wide and a digit thick; the lowest is at a distance of\r\none foot from the middle one, and the middle one a distance of two feet\r\nfrom the upper one. Under them are eighteen iron bars fixed by iron\r\nrivets; these bars are of the same width and thickness as the bands, and\r\nthey are of such a length, that curving, they reach from the lower band\r\nto the upper, that is two feet and three palms long, while the dome is\r\nonly one foot and three palms high. All the bars and bands of the dome\r\nhave iron plates fastened on the underside with iron wire. In addition,\r\nthe dome has four apertures; the rear one, which is situated opposite\r\nthe channel through which the litharge flows out, is two feet wide at\r\nthe bottom; toward the top, since it slopes gently, it is narrower,\r\nbeing a foot, three palms, and a digit wide; there is no bar at this\r\nplace, for the aperture extends from the upper band to the middle one,\r\nbut not to the lower one. The second aperture is situated above the\r\nchannel, is two and a half feet wide at the bottom, and two feet and a\r\npalm at the top; and there is likewise no bar at this point; indeed, not\r\nonly does the bar not extend to the lower band, but the lower band\r\nitself does not extend over this part, in order that the master can draw\r\nthe litharge out of the crucible. There are besides, in the wall which\r\nprotects the principal wall against the heat, near where the nozzles of\r\nthe bellows are situated, two apertures, three palms wide and about a\r\nfoot high, in the middle of which two rods descend, fastened on the\r\ninside with plates. Near these apertures are placed the nozzles of the\r\nbellows, and through the apertures extend the pipes in which the nozzles\r\nof the bellows are set. These pipes are made of iron plates rolled up;\r\nthey are two palms three digits long, and their inside diameter is three\r\nand a half digits; into these two pipes the nozzles of the bellows\r\npenetrate a distance of three digits from their valves. The lid of the\r\ndome consists of an iron band at the bottom, two digits wide, and of\r\nthree curved iron bars, which extend from one point on the band to the\r\npoint opposite; they cross each other at the top, where they are fixed\r\nby means of iron rivets. On the under side of the bars there are\r\nlikewise plates fastened by rivets; each of the plates has small holes\r\nthe size of a finger, so that the lute will adhere when the interior is\r\nlined. The dome has three iron rings engaged in wide holes in the heads\r\nof iron claves, which fasten the bars to the middle band at these\r\npoints. Into these rings are fastened the hooks of the chains with which\r\nthe dome is raised, when the master is preparing the crucible.\r\n\r\nOn the sole and the copper plates and the rock of the furnace, lute\r\nmixed with straw is placed to a depth of three digits, and it is pounded\r\nwith a wooden rammer until it is compressed to a depth of one digit\r\nonly. The rammer-head is round and three palms high, two palms wide at\r\nthe bottom, and tapering upward; its handle is three feet long, and\r\nwhere it is set into the rammer-head it is bound around with an iron\r\nband. The top of the stonework in which the dome rests is also covered\r\nwith lute, likewise mixed with straw, to the thickness of a palm. All\r\nthis, as soon as it becomes loosened, must be repaired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 470 (Cupellation Furnace): A--An artificer tamping the\r\ncrucible with a rammer. B--Large rammer. C--Broom.

On the one morning he\r\nsprinkles a little ash into the lute, and when he has poured some water\r\nover it he brushes it over with a broom. Then he throws in sifted ashes\r\nand dampens them with water, so that they could be moulded into balls\r\nlike snow. The ashes are those from which lye has been made by letting\r\nwater percolate through them, for other ashes which are fatty would have\r\nto be burnt again in order to make them less fat. When he has made the\r\nashes smooth by pressing them with his hands, he makes the crucible\r\nslope down toward the middle; then he tamps it, as I have described,\r\nwith a rammer. He afterward, with two small wooden rammers, one held in\r\neach hand, forms the channel through which the litharge flows out. The\r\nheads of these small rammers are each a palm wide, two digits thick, and\r\none foot high; the handle of each is somewhat rounded, is a digit and a\r\nhalf less in diameter than the rammer-head, and is three feet in\r\nlength; the rammer-head as well as the handle is made of one piece of\r\nwood. Then with shoes on, he descends into the crucible and stamps it in\r\nevery direction with his feet, in which manner it is packed and made\r\nsloping. Then he again tamps it with a large rammer, and removing his\r\nshoe from his right foot he draws a circle around the crucible with it,\r\nand cuts out the circle thus drawn with an iron plate. This plate is\r\ncurved at both ends, is three palms long, as many digits wide, and has\r\nwooden handles a palm and two digits long, and two digits thick; the\r\niron plate is curved back at the top and ends, which penetrate into\r\nhandles. There are some who use in the place of the plate a strip of\r\nwood, like the rim of a sieve; this is three digits wide, and is cut out\r\nat both ends that it may be held in the hands. Afterward he tamps the\r\nchannel through which the litharge discharges. Lest the ashes should\r\nfall out, he blocks up the aperture with a stone shaped to fit it,\r\nagainst which he places a board, and lest this fall, he props it with a\r\nstick. Then he pours in a basketful of ashes and tamps them with the\r\nlarge rammer; then again and again he pours in ashes and tamps them with\r\nthe rammer. When the channel has been made, he throws dry ashes all over\r\nthe crucible with a sieve, and smooths and rubs it with his hands. Then\r\nhe throws three basketsful of damp ashes on the margin all round the\r\nedge of the crucible, and lets down the dome. Soon after, climbing upon\r\nthe crucible, he builds up ashes all around it, lest the molten alloy\r\nshould flow out. Then, having raised the lid of the dome, he throws a\r\nbasketful of charcoal into the crucible, together with an iron shovelful\r\nof glowing coals, and he also throws some of the latter through the\r\napertures in the sides of the dome, and he spreads them with the same\r\nshovel. This work and labour is finished in the space of two hours.\r\n\r\nAn iron plate is set in the ground under the channel, and upon this is\r\nplaced a wooden block, three feet and a palm long, a foot and two palms\r\nand as many digits wide at the back, and two palms and as many digits\r\nwide in front; on the block of wood is placed a stone, and over it an\r\niron plate similar to the bottom one, and upon this he puts a basketful\r\nof charcoal, and also an iron shovelful of burning charcoals. The\r\ncrucible is heated in an hour, and then, with the hooked bar with which\r\nthe litharge is drawn off, he stirs the remainder of the charcoal about.\r\nThis hook is a palm long and three digits wide, has the form of a double\r\ntriangle, and has an iron handle four feet long, into which is set a\r\nwooden one six feet long. There are some who use instead a simple hooked\r\nbar. After about an hour's time, he stirs the charcoal again with the\r\nbar, and with the shovel throws into the crucible the burning charcoals\r\nlying in the channel; then again, after the space of an hour, he stirs\r\nthe burning charcoals with the same bar. If he did not thus stir them\r\nabout, some blackness would remain in the crucible and that part would\r\nbe damaged, because it would not be sufficiently dried. Therefore the\r\nassistant stirs and turns the burning charcoal that it may be entirely\r\nburnt up, and so that the crucible may be well heated, which takes three\r\nhours; then the crucible is left quiet for the remaining two hours.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour of eleven has struck, he sweeps up the charcoal ashes\r\nwith a broom and throws them out of the crucible. Then he climbs on to\r\nthe dome, and passing his hand in through its opening, and dipping an\r\nold linen rag in a bucket of water mixed with ashes, he moistens the\r\nwhole of the crucible and sweeps it. In this way he uses two bucketsful\r\nof the mixture, each holding five Roman _sextarii_,[28] and he does this\r\nlest the crucible, when the metals are being parted, should break open;\r\nafter this he rubs the crucible with a doe skin, and fills in the\r\ncracks. Then he places at the left side of the channel, two fragments of\r\nhearth-lead, laid one on the top of the other, so that when partly\r\nmelted they remain fixed and form an obstacle, that the litharge will\r\nnot be blown about by the wind from the bellows, but remain in its\r\nplace. It is expedient, however, to use a brick in the place of the\r\nhearth-lead, for as this gets much hotter, therefore it causes the\r\nlitharge to form more rapidly. The crucible in its middle part is made\r\ntwo palms and as many digits deeper.[29]\r\n\r\nThere are some who having thus prepared the crucible, smear it over with\r\nincense[30], ground to powder and dissolved in white of egg, soaking it\r\nup in a sponge and then squeezing it out again; there are others who\r\nsmear over it a liquid consisting of white of egg and double the amount\r\nof bullock's blood or marrow. Some throw lime into the crucible through\r\na sieve.\r\n\r\nAfterward the master of the works weighs the lead with which the gold or\r\nsilver or both are mixed, and he sometimes puts a hundred\r\n_centumpondia_[31] into the crucible, but frequently only sixty, or\r\nfifty, or much less. After it has been weighed, he strews about in the\r\ncrucible three small bundles of straw, lest the lead by its weight\r\nshould break the surface. Then he places in the channel several cakes of\r\nlead alloy, and through the aperture at the rear of the dome he places\r\nsome along the sides; then, ascending to the opening at the top of the\r\ndome, he arranges in the crucible round about the dome the cakes which\r\nhis assistant hands to him, and after ascending again and passing his\r\nhands through the same aperture, he likewise places other cakes inside\r\nthe crucible. On the second day those which remain he, with an iron\r\nfork, places on the wood through the rear aperture of the dome.\r\n\r\nWhen the cakes have been thus arranged through the hole at the top of\r\nthe dome, he throws in charcoal with a basket woven of wooden twigs.\r\nThen he places the lid over the dome, and the assistant covers over the\r\njoints with lute. The master himself throws half a basketful of charcoal\r\ninto the crucible through the aperture next to the nozzle pipe, and\r\nprepares the bellows, in order to be able to begin the second operation\r\non the morning of the following day. It takes the space of one hour to\r\ncarry out such a piece of work, and at twelve all is prepared. These\r\nhours all reckoned up make a sum of eight hours.\r\n\r\nNow it is time that we should come to the second operation. In the\r\nmorning the workman takes up two shovelsful of live charcoals and throws\r\nthem into the crucible through the aperture next to the pipes of the\r\nnozzles; then through the same hole he lays upon them small pieces of\r\nfir-wood or of pitch pine, such as are generally used to cook fish.\r\nAfter this the water-gates are opened, in order that the machine may be\r\nturned which depresses the levers of the bellows. In the space of one\r\nhour the lead alloy is melted; and when this has been done, he places\r\nfour sticks of wood, twelve feet long, through the hole in the back of\r\nthe dome, and as many through the channel; these sticks, lest they\r\nshould damage the crucible, are both weighted on the ends and supported\r\nby trestles; these trestles are made of a beam, three feet long, two\r\npalms and as many digits wide, two palms thick, and have two spreading\r\nlegs at each end. Against the trestle, in front of the channel, there is\r\nplaced an iron plate, lest the litharge, when it is extracted from the\r\nfurnace, should splash the smelter's shoes and injure his feet and legs.\r\nWith an iron shovel or a fork he places the remainder of the cakes\r\nthrough the aperture at the back of the dome on to the sticks of wood\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe native silver, or silver glance, or grey silver, or ruby silver, or\r\nany other sort, when it has been flattened out[32], and cut up, and\r\nheated in an iron crucible, is poured into the molten lead mixed with\r\nsilver, in order that impurities may be separated. As I have often said,\r\nthis molten lead mixed with silver is called _stannum_[33].\r\n\r\n[Illustration 474 (Cupellation Furnace): A--Furnace. B--Sticks of wood.\r\nC--Litharge. D--Plate. E--The foreman when hungry eats butter, that the\r\npoison which the crucible exhales may not harm him, for this is a\r\nspecial remedy against that poison.]\r\n\r\nWhen the long sticks of wood are burned up at the fore end, the master,\r\nwith a hammer, drives into them pointed iron bars, four feet long and\r\ntwo digits wide at the front end, and beyond that one and a half digits\r\nwide and thick; with these he pushes the sticks of wood forward and the\r\nbars then rest on the trestles. There are others who, when they separate\r\nmetals, put two such sticks of wood into the crucible through the\r\naperture which is between the bellows, as many through the holes at the\r\nback, and one through the channel; but in this case a larger number of\r\nlong sticks of wood is necessary, that is, sixty; in the former case,\r\nforty long sticks of wood suffice to carry out the operation. When the\r\nlead has been heated for two hours, it is stirred with a hooked bar,\r\nthat the heat may be increased.\r\n\r\nIf it be difficult to separate the lead from the silver, he throws\r\ncopper and charcoal dust into the molten silver-lead alloy. If the alloy\r\nof argentiferous gold and lead, or the silver-lead alloy, contains\r\nimpurities from the ore, then he throws in either equal portions of\r\nargol and Venetian glass or of sal-ammoniac, or of Venetian glass and of\r\nVenetian soap; or else unequal portions, that is, two of argol and one\r\nof iron rust; there are some who mix a little saltpetre with each\r\ncompound. To one _centumpondium_ of the alloy is added a _bes_ or a\r\n_libra_ and a third of the powder, according to whether it is more or\r\nless impure. The powder certainly separates the impurities from the\r\nalloy. Then, with a kind of rabble he draws out through the channel,\r\nmixed with charcoal, the scum, as one might say, of the lead; the lead\r\nmakes this scum when it becomes hot, but that less of it may be made it\r\nmust be stirred frequently with the bar.\r\n\r\nWithin the space of a quarter of an hour the crucible absorbs the lead;\r\nat the time when it penetrates into the crucible it leaps and bubbles.\r\nThen the master takes out a little lead with an iron ladle, which he\r\nassays, in order to find what proportion of silver there is in the whole\r\nof the alloy; the ladle is five digits wide, the iron part of its handle\r\nis three feet long and the wooden part the same. Afterward, when they\r\nare heated, he extracts with a bar the litharge which comes from the\r\nlead and the copper, if there be any of it in the alloy. Wherefore, it\r\nmight more rightly be called _spuma_ of lead than of silver[34]. There\r\nis no injury to the silver, when the lead and copper are separated from\r\nit. In truth the lead becomes much purer in the crucible of the other\r\nfurnace, in which silver is refined. In ancient times, as the author\r\nPliny[35] relates, there was under the channel of the crucible another\r\ncrucible, and the litharge flowed down from the upper one into the lower\r\none, out of which it was lifted up and rolled round with a stick in\r\norder that it might be of moderate weight. For which reason, they\r\nformerly made it into small tubes or pipes, but now, since it is not\r\nrolled round a stick, they make it into bars.\r\n\r\nIf there be any danger that the alloy might flow out with the litharge,\r\nthe foreman keeps on hand a piece of lute, shaped like a cylinder and\r\npointed at both ends; fastening this to a hooked bar he opposes it to\r\nthe alloy so that it will not flow out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 476 (Cleansing of Silver Cakes): A--Cake. B--Stone.\r\nC--Hammer. D--Brass wire. E--Bucket containing water. F--Furnace from\r\nwhich the cake has been taken, which is still smoking. G--Labourer\r\ncarrying a cake out of the works.]\r\n\r\nNow when the colour begins to show in the silver, bright spots appear,\r\nsome of them being almost white, and a moment afterward it becomes\r\nabsolutely white. Then the assistant lets down the water-gates, so that,\r\nthe race being closed, the water-wheel ceases to turn and the bellows\r\nare still. Then the master pours several buckets of water on to the\r\nsilver to cool it; others pour beer over it to make it whiter, but this\r\nis of no importance since the silver has yet to be refined. Afterward,\r\nthe cake of silver is raised with the pointed iron bar, which is three\r\nfeet long and two digits wide, and has a wooden handle four feet long\r\nfixed in its socket. When the cake of silver has been taken from the\r\ncrucible, it is laid upon a stone, and from part of it the hearth-lead,\r\nand from the other part the litharge, is chipped away with a hammer;\r\nthen it is cleansed with a bundle of brass wire dipped in water. When\r\nthe lead is separated from the silver, more silver is frequently found\r\nthan when it was assayed; for instance, if before there were three\r\n_unciae_ and as many _drachmae_ in a _centumpondium_, they now sometimes\r\nfind three _unciae_ and a half[36]. Often the hearth-lead remaining in\r\nthe crucible is a palm deep; it is taken out with the rest of the ashes\r\nand is sifted, and that which remains in the sieve, since it is\r\nhearth-lead, is added to the hearth-lead[37].\r\n\r\nThe ashes which pass through the sieve are of the same use as they were\r\nat first, for, indeed, from these and pulverised bones they make the\r\ncupels. Finally, when much of it has accumulated, the yellow _pompholyx_\r\nadhering to the walls of the furnace, and likewise to those rings of the\r\ndome near the apertures, is cleared away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 479 (Crane for cupellation furnace): A--Crane-post.\r\nB--Socket.

Its lower pinion turns in a\r\nbronze socket set in an oak sill; there are two sills placed crosswise\r\nso that the one fits in a mortise in the middle of the other, and the\r\nother likewise fits in the mortise of the first, thus making a kind of a\r\ncross; these sills are three feet long and one foot wide and thick. The\r\ncrane-post is round at its upper end and is cut down to a depth of three\r\npalms, and turns in a band fastened at each end to a roof-beam, from\r\nwhich springs the inclined chimney wall. To the crane-post is affixed a\r\nframe, which is made in this way: first, at a height of a cubit from the\r\nbottom, is mortised into the crane-post a small cross-beam, a cubit and\r\nthree digits long, except its tenons, and two palms in width and\r\nthickness. Then again, at a height of five feet above it, is another\r\nsmall cross-beam of equal length, width, and thickness, mortised into\r\nthe crane-post. The other ends of these two small cross-beams are\r\nmortised into an upright timber, six feet three palms long, and\r\nthree-quarters wide and thick; the mortise is transfixed by wooden pegs.\r\nAbove, at a height of three palms from the lower small cross-beam, are\r\ntwo bars, one foot one palm long, not including the tenons, a palm three\r\ndigits wide, and a palm thick, which are mortised in the other sides of\r\nthe crane-post. In the same manner, under the upper small cross-beam are\r\ntwo bars of the same size. Also in the upright timber there are mortised\r\nthe same number of bars, of the same length as the preceding, but three\r\ndigits thick, a palm two digits wide, the two lower ones being above the\r\nlower small cross-beam. From the upright timber near the upper small\r\ncross-beam, which at its other end is mortised into the crane-post, are\r\ntwo mortised bars. On the outside of this frame, boards are fixed to the\r\nsmall cross-beams, but the front and back parts of the frame have doors,\r\nwhose hinges are fastened to the boards which are fixed to the bars that\r\nare mortised to the sides of the crane-post.\r\n\r\nThen boards are laid upon the lower small cross-beam, and at a height of\r\ntwo palms above these there is a small square iron axle, the sides of\r\nwhich are two digits wide; both ends of it are round and turn in bronze\r\nor iron bearings, one of these bearings being fastened in the\r\ncrane-post, the other in the upright timber. About each end of the small\r\naxle is a wooden disc, of three palms and a digit radius and one palm\r\nthick, covered on the rim with an iron band; these two discs are distant\r\ntwo palms and as many digits from each other, and are joined with five\r\nrundles; these rundles are two and a half digits thick and are placed\r\nthree digits apart. Thus a drum is made, which is a palm and a digit\r\ndistant from the upright timber, but further from the crane-post,\r\nnamely, a palm and three digits. At a height of a foot and a palm above\r\nthis little axle is a second small square iron axle, the thickness of\r\nwhich is three digits; this one, like the first one, turns in bronze or\r\niron bearings. Around it is a toothed wheel, composed of two discs a\r\nfoot three palms in diameter, a palm and two digits thick; on the rim of\r\nthis there are twenty-three teeth, a palm wide and two digits thick;\r\nthey protrude a palm from the wheel and are three digits apart. And\r\naround this same axle, at a distance of two palms and as many digits\r\ntoward the upright timber, is another disc of the same diameter as the\r\nwheel and a palm thick; this turns in a hollowed-out place in the\r\nupright timber. Between this disc and the disc of the toothed wheel\r\nanother drum is made, having likewise five rundles. There is, in\r\naddition to this second axle, at a height of a cubit above it, a small\r\nwooden axle, the journals of which are of iron; the ends are bound round\r\nwith iron rings so that the journals may remain firmly fixed, and the\r\njournals, like the little iron axles, turn in bronze or iron bearings.\r\nThis third axle is at a distance of about a cubit from the upper small\r\ncross-beam; it has, near the upright timber, a toothed wheel two and a\r\nhalf feet in diameter, on the rim of which are twenty-seven teeth; the\r\nother part of this axle, near the crane-post, is covered with iron\r\nplates, lest it should be worn away by the chain which winds around it.\r\nThe end link of the chain is fixed in an iron pin driven into the little\r\naxle; this chain passes out of the frame and turns over a little pulley\r\nset between the beams of the crane-arm.\r\n\r\nAbove the frame, at a height of a foot and a palm, is the crane-arm.\r\nThis consists of two beams fifteen feet long, three palms wide, and two\r\nthick, mortised into the crane-post, and they protrude a cubit from the\r\nback of the crane-post and are fastened together. Moreover, they are\r\nfastened by means of a wooden pin which penetrates through them and the\r\ncrane-post; this pin has at the one end a broad head, and at the other a\r\nhole, through which is driven an iron bolt, so that the beams may be\r\ntightly bound into the crane-post. The beams of the crane-arm are\r\nsupported and stayed by means of two oblique beams, six feet and two\r\npalms long, and likewise two palms wide and thick; these are mortised\r\ninto the crane-post at their lower ends, and their upper ends are\r\nmortised into the beams of the crane-arm at a point about four feet from\r\nthe crane-post, and they are fastened with iron nails. At the back of\r\nthe upper end of these oblique beams, toward the crane-post, is an iron\r\nstaple, fastened into the lower sides of the beams of the crane-arm, in\r\norder that it may hold them fast and bind them. The outer end of each\r\nbeam of the crane-arm is set in a rectangular iron plate, and between\r\nthese are three rectangular iron plates, fixed in such a manner that the\r\nbeams of the crane-arm can neither move away from, nor toward, each\r\nother. The upper sides of these crane-arm beams are covered with iron\r\nplates for a length of six feet, so that a trolley can move on it.\r\n\r\nThe body of the trolley is made of wood from the Ostrya or any other\r\nhard tree, and is a cubit long, a foot wide, and three palms thick; on\r\nboth edges of it the lower side is cut out to a height and width of a\r\npalm, so that the remainder may move backward and forward between the\r\ntwo beams of the crane-arm; at the front, in the middle part, it is cut\r\nout to a width of two palms and as many digits, that a bronze pulley,\r\naround a small iron axle, may turn in it. Near the corners of the\r\ntrolley are four holes, in which as many small wheels travel on the\r\nbeams of the crane-arm. Since this trolley, when it travels backward and\r\nforward, gives out a sound somewhat similar to the barking of a dog, we\r\nhave given it this name[38]. It is propelled forward by means of a\r\ncrank, and is drawn back by means of a chain. There is an iron hook\r\nwhose ring turns round an iron pin fastened to the right side of the\r\ntrolley, which hook is held by a sort of clavis, which is fixed in the\r\nright beam of the crane-arm.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the crane-post is a bronze pulley, the iron axle of which\r\nis fastened in the beams of the crane-arm, and over which the chain\r\npasses as it comes from the frame, and then, penetrating through the\r\nhollow in the top of the trolley, it reaches to the little bronze pulley\r\nof the trolley, and passing over this it hangs down. A hook on its end\r\nengages a ring, in which are fixed the top links of three chains, each\r\nsix feet long, which pass through the three iron rings fastened in the\r\nholes of the claves which are fixed into the middle iron band of the\r\ndome, of which I have spoken.\r\n\r\nTherefore when the master wishes to lift the dome by means of the crane,\r\nthe assistant fits over the lower small iron axle an iron crank, which\r\nprojects from the upright beam a palm and two digits; the end of the\r\nlittle axle is rectangular, and one and a half digits wide and one digit\r\nthick; it is set into a similar rectangular hole in the crank, which is\r\ntwo digits long and a little more than a digit wide. The crank is\r\nsemi-circular, and one foot three palms and two digits long, as many\r\ndigits wide, and one digit thick. Its handle is straight and round, and\r\nthree palms long, and one and a half digits thick. There is a hole in\r\nthe end of the little axle, through which an iron pin is driven so that\r\nthe crank may not come off. The crane having four drums, two of which\r\nare rundle-drums and two toothed-wheels, is more easily moved than\r\nanother having two drums, one of which has rundles and the other teeth.\r\n\r\nMany, however, use only a simple contrivance, the pivots of whose\r\ncrane-post turn in the same manner, the one in an iron socket, the other\r\nin a ring. There is a crane-arm on the crane-post, which is supported by\r\nan oblique beam; to the head of the crane-arm a strong iron ring is\r\nfixed, which engages a second iron ring. In this iron ring a strong\r\nwooden lever-bar is fastened firmly, the head of which is bound by a\r\nthird iron ring, from which hangs an iron hook, which engages the rings\r\nat the ends of the chains from the dome. At the other end of the\r\nlever-bar is another chain, which, when it is pulled down, raises the\r\nopposite end of the bar and thus the dome; and when it is relaxed the\r\ndome is lowered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 481 (Cupellation Furnace at Freiberg): A--Chamber of the\r\nfurnace.

This chamber is four\r\nfeet high and has either two or three apertures, of which the first, in\r\nfront, is one and a half feet high and a foot wide, and out of this\r\nflows the litharge; the second aperture and likewise the third, if there\r\nbe three, are at the sides, and are a foot and a half high and two and a\r\nhalf feet wide, in order that he who prepares the crucible may be able\r\nto creep into the furnace. Its circular bed is made of cement, it has\r\ntwo passages two feet high and one foot wide, for letting out the\r\nvapour, and these lead directly through from one side to the other, so\r\nthat the one passage crosses the other at right angles, and thus four\r\nopenings are to be seen; these are covered at the top by rocks, wide,\r\nbut only a palm thick. On these and on the other parts of the interior\r\nof the bed made of cement, is placed lute mixed with straw, to a depth\r\nof three digits, as it was placed over the sole and the plates of copper\r\nand the rocks of that other furnace. This, together with the ashes which\r\nare thrown in, the master or the assistant, who, upon his knees,\r\nprepares the crucible, tamps down with short wooden rammers and with\r\nmallets likewise made of wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 482 (Cupellation Furnace in Poland): A--Furnace similar to\r\nan oven. B--Passage. C--Iron bars. D--Hole through which the litharge is\r\ndrawn out. E--Crucible which lacks a dome. F--Thick sticks. G--Bellows.]\r\n\r\nThe cupellation furnace in Poland and Hungary is likewise vaulted at\r\nthe top, and is almost similar to an oven, but in the lower part the bed\r\nis solid, and there is no opening for the vapours, while on one side of\r\nthe crucible is a wall, between which and the bed of the crucible is a\r\npassage in place of the opening for vapours; this passage is covered by\r\niron bars or rods extending from the wall to the crucible, and placed a\r\ndistance of two digits from each other. In the crucible, when it is\r\nprepared, they first scatter straw, and then they lay in it cakes of\r\nsilver-lead alloy, and on the iron bars they lay wood, which when\r\nkindled heats the crucible. They melt cakes to the weight of sometimes\r\neighty _centumpondia_ and sometimes a hundred _centumpondia_[39]. They\r\nstimulate a mild fire by means of a blast from the bellows, and throw on\r\nto the bars as much wood as is required to make a flame which will reach\r\ninto the crucible, and separate the lead from the silver. The litharge\r\nis drawn out on the other side through an aperture that is just wide\r\nenough for the master to creep through into the crucible. The Moravians\r\nand Carni, who very rarely make more than a _bes_ or five-sixths of a\r\n_libra_ of silver, separate the lead from it, neither in a furnace\r\nresembling an oven, nor in the crucible covered by a dome, but on a\r\ncrucible which is without a cover and exposed to the wind; on this\r\ncrucible they lay cakes of silver-lead alloy, and over them they place\r\ndry wood, and over these again thick green wood. The wood having been\r\nkindled, they stimulate the fire by means of a bellows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 484 (Refining Silver): A--Pestle with teeth. B--Pestle\r\nwithout teeth.

I--Tests in which burning charcoal has been thrown.]\r\n\r\nI have explained the method of separating lead from gold or silver. Now\r\nI will speak of the method of refining silver, for I have already\r\nexplained the process for refining gold. Silver is refined in a refining\r\nfurnace, over whose hearth is an arched chamber built of bricks; this\r\nchamber in the front part is three feet high. The hearth itself is five\r\nfeet long and four wide. The walls are unbroken along the sides and\r\nback, but in front one chamber is placed over the other, and above these\r\nand the wall is the upright chimney. The hearth has a round pit, a cubit\r\nwide and two palms deep, into which are thrown sifted ashes, and in this\r\nis placed a prepared earthenware \"test,\" in such a manner that it is\r\nsurrounded on all sides by ashes to a height equal to its own. The\r\nearthenware test is filled with a powder consisting of equal portions of\r\nbones ground to powder, and of ashes taken from the crucible in which\r\nlead is separated from gold or silver; others mix crushed brick with the\r\nashes, for by this method the powder attracts no silver to itself. When\r\nthe powder has been made up and moistened with water, a little is thrown\r\ninto the earthenware test and tamped with a wooden pestle. This pestle\r\nis round, a foot long, and a palm and a digit wide, out of which extend\r\nsix teeth, each a digit thick, and a digit and a third long and wide,\r\nand almost a digit apart; these six teeth form a circle, and in the\r\ncentre of them is the seventh tooth, which is round and of the same\r\nlength as the others, but a digit and a half thick; this pestle tapers a\r\nlittle from the bottom up, that the upper part of the handle may be\r\nround and three digits thick. Some use a round pestle without teeth.\r\nThen a little powder is again moistened, and thrown into the test, and\r\ntamped; this work is repeated until the test is entirely full of the\r\npowder, which the master then cuts out with a knife, sharp on both\r\nsides, and turned upward at both ends so that the central part is a palm\r\nand a digit long; therefore it is partly straight and partly curved. The\r\nblade is one and a half digits wide, and at each end it turns upward two\r\npalms, which ends to the depth of a palm are either not sharpened or\r\nthey are enclosed in wooden handles. The master holds the knife with one\r\nhand and cuts out the powder from the test, so that it is left three\r\ndigits thick all round; then he sifts the powder of dried bones over it\r\nthrough a sieve, the bottom of which is made of closely-woven bristles.\r\nAfterward a ball made of very hard wood, six digits in diameter, is\r\nplaced in the test and rolled about with both hands, in order to make\r\nthe inside even and smooth; for that matter he may move the ball about\r\nwith only one hand. The tests[40] are of various capacities, for some of\r\nthem when prepared hold much less than fifteen _librae_ of silver,\r\nothers twenty, some thirty, others forty, and others fifty. All these\r\ntests thus prepared are dried in the sun, or set in a warm and covered\r\nplace; the more dry and old they are the better. All of them, when used\r\nfor refining silver, are heated by means of burning charcoal placed in\r\nthem. Others use instead of these tests an iron ring; but the test is\r\nmore useful, for if the powder deteriorates the silver remains in it,\r\nwhile there being no bottom to the ring, it falls out; besides, it is\r\neasier to place in the hearth the test than the iron ring, and\r\nfurthermore it requires much less powder. In order that the test should\r\nnot break and damage the silver, some bind it round with an iron band.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 486 (Refining Silver): A--Grate. B--Brass block. C--Block\r\nof wood.

N--Implement in\r\nthe shape of tongs.]\r\n\r\nIn order that they may be more easily broken, the silver cakes are\r\nplaced upon an iron grate by the refiner, and are heated by burning\r\ncharcoal placed under them. He has a brass block two palms and two\r\ndigits long and wide, with a channel in the middle, which he places upon\r\na block of hard wood. Then with a double-headed hammer, he beats the hot\r\ncakes of silver placed on the brass block, and breaks them in pieces.\r\nThe head of this hammer is a foot and two digits long, and a palm wide.\r\nOthers use for this purpose merely a block of wood channelled in the\r\ntop. While the fragments of the cake are still hot, he seizes them with\r\nthe tongs and throws them into a bowl with holes in the bottom, and\r\npours water over them. When the fragments are cooled, he puts them\r\nnicely into the test by placing them so that they stand upright and\r\nproject from the test to a height of two palms, and lest one should fall\r\nagainst the other, he places little pieces of charcoal between them;\r\nthen he places live charcoal in the test, and soon two twig basketsful\r\nof charcoal. Then he blows in air with the bellows. This bellows is\r\ndouble, and four feet two palms long, and two feet and as many palms\r\nwide at the back; the other parts are similar to those described in Book\r\nVII. The nozzle of the bellows is placed in a bronze pipe a foot long,\r\nthe aperture in this pipe being a digit in diameter in front and quite\r\nround, and at the back two palms wide. The master, because he needs for\r\nthe operation of refining silver a fierce fire, and requires on that\r\naccount a vigorous blast, places the bellows very much inclined, in\r\norder that, when the silver has melted, it may blow into the centre of\r\nthe test. When the silver bubbles, he presses the nozzle down by means\r\nof a small block of wood moistened with water and fastened to an iron\r\nrod, the outer end of which bends upward. The silver melts when it has\r\nbeen heated in the test for about an hour; when it is melted, he removes\r\nthe live coals from the test and places over it two billets of fir-wood,\r\na foot and three palms long, a palm two digits wide, one palm thick at\r\nthe upper part, and three digits at the lower. He joins them together at\r\nthe lower edges, and into the billets he again throws the coals, for a\r\nfierce fire is always necessary in refining silver. It is refined in two\r\nor three hours, according to whether it was pure or impure, and if it is\r\nimpure it is made purer by dropping granulated copper or lead into the\r\ntest at the same time. In order that the refiner may sustain the great\r\nheat from the fire while the silver is being refined, he lets down an\r\niron door, which is three feet long and a foot and three palms high;\r\nthis door is held on both ends in iron plates, and when the operation is\r\nconcluded, he raises it again with an iron shovel, so that its edge\r\nholds against the iron hook in the arch, and thus the door is held open.\r\nWhen the silver is nearly refined, which may be judged by the space of\r\ntime, he dips into it an iron bar, three and a half feet long and a\r\ndigit thick, having a round steel point. The small drops of silver that\r\nadhere to the bar he places on the brass block and flattens with a\r\nhammer, and from their colour he decides whether the silver is\r\nsufficiently refined or not. If it is thoroughly purified it is very\r\nwhite, and in a _bes_ there is only a _drachma_ of impurities. Some\r\nladle up the silver with a hollow iron implement. Of each _bes_ of\r\nsilver one _sicilicus_ is consumed, or occasionally when very impure,\r\nthree _drachmae_ or half an _uncia_[41].\r\n\r\n[Illustration 488 (Cleansing of Silver Cakes): A--Implement with a ring.\r\nB--Ladle.

R--Test still smoking.]\r\n\r\nThe refiner governs the fire and stirs the molten silver with an iron\r\nimplement, nine feet long, a digit thick, and at the end first curved\r\ntoward the right, then curved back in order to form a circle, the\r\ninterior of which is a palm in diameter; others use an iron implement,\r\nthe end of which is bent directly upward. Another iron implement has the\r\nshape of tongs, with which, by compressing it with his hands, he seizes\r\nthe coals and puts them on or takes them off; this is two feet long, one\r\nand a half digits wide, and the third of a digit thick.\r\n\r\nWhen the silver is seen to be thoroughly refined, the artificer removes\r\nthe coals from the test with a shovel. Soon afterward he draws water in\r\na copper ladle, which has a wooden handle four feet long; it has a small\r\nhole at a point half-way between the middle of the bowl and the edge,\r\nthrough which a hemp seed just passes. He fills this ladle three times\r\nwith water, and three times it all flows out through the hole on to the\r\nsilver, and slowly quenches it; if he suddenly poured much water on it,\r\nit would burst asunder and injure those standing near. The artificer has\r\na pointed iron bar, three feet long, which has a wooden handle as many\r\nfeet long, and he puts the end of this bar into the test in order to\r\nstir it. He also stirs it with a hooked iron bar, of which the hook is\r\ntwo digits wide and a palm deep, and the iron part of its handle is\r\nthree feet long and the wooden part the same. Then he removes the test\r\nfrom the hearth with a shovel or a fork, and turns it over, and by this\r\nmeans the silver falls to the ground in the shape of half a sphere; then\r\nlifting the cake with a shovel he throws it into a tub of water, where\r\nit gives out a great sound. Or else, having lifted the cake of silver\r\nwith a fork, he lays it upon the iron implement similar to tongs, which\r\nare placed across a tub full of water; afterward, when cooled, he takes\r\nit from the tub again and lays it on the block made of hard wood and\r\nbeats it with a hammer, in order to break off any of the powder from the\r\ntest which adheres to it. The cake is then placed on the implement\r\nsimilar to tongs, laid over the tub full of water, and cleaned with a\r\nbundle of brass wire dipped into the water; this operation of beating\r\nand cleansing is repeated until it is all clean. Afterward he places it\r\non an iron grate or tripod; the tripod is a palm and two digits high,\r\none and a half digits wide, and its span is two palms wide; then he puts\r\nburning charcoal under the tripod or grate, in order again to dry the\r\nsilver that was moistened by the water. Finally, the Royal Inspector[42]\r\nin the employment of the King or Prince, or the owner, lays the silver\r\non a block of wood, and with an engraver's chisel he cuts out two small\r\npieces, one from the under and the other from the upper side. These are\r\ntested by fire, in order to ascertain whether the silver is thoroughly\r\nrefined or not, and at what price it should be sold to the merchants.\r\nFinally he impresses upon it the seal of the King or the Prince or the\r\nowner, and, near the same, the amount of the weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 489 (Refining Silver): A--Muffle. B--Its little windows.\r\nC--Its little bridge. D--Bricks. E--Iron door. F--Its little window.\r\nG--Bellows. H--Hammer-chisel. I--Iron ring which some use instead of the\r\ntest. K--Pestle with which the ashes placed in the ring are pounded.]\r\n\r\nThere are some who refine silver in tests placed under iron or\r\nearthenware muffles. They use a furnace, on the hearth of which they\r\nplace the test containing the fragments of silver, and they place the\r\nmuffle over it; the muffle has small windows at the sides, and in front\r\na little bridge. In order to melt the silver, at the sides of the muffle\r\nare laid bricks, upon which the charcoal is placed, and burning\r\nfirebrands are put on the bridge. The furnace has an iron door, which is\r\ncovered on the side next to the fire with lute in order that it may not\r\nbe injured. When the door is closed it retains the heat of the fire, but\r\nit has a small window, so that the artificers may look into the test and\r\nmay at times stimulate the fire with the bellows. Although by this\r\nmethod silver is refined more slowly than by the other, nevertheless it\r\nis more useful, because less loss is caused, for a gentle fire consumes\r\nfewer particles than a fierce fire continually excited by the blast of\r\nthe bellows. If, on account of its great size, the cake of silver can be\r\ncarried only with difficulty when it is taken out of the muffle, they\r\ncut it up into two or three pieces while it is still hot, with a wedge\r\nor a hammer-chisel; for if they cut it up after it has cooled, little\r\npieces of it frequently fly off and are lost.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK X.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Vile a precioso_.\r\n\r\n[2] The reagents mentioned in this Book are much the same as those of\r\nBook VII, where (p. 220) a table is given showing the Latin and Old\r\nGerman terms. Footnotes in explanation of our views as to these\r\nsubstances may be most easily consulted through the index.\r\n\r\n[3] _Aqua valens_, literally strong, potent, or powerful water. It will\r\nappear later, from the method of manufacture, that hydrochloric, nitric,\r\nand sulphuric acids and _aqua regia_ were more or less all produced and\r\nall included in this term. We have, therefore, used either the term\r\n_aqua valens_ or simply _aqua_ as it occurs in the text. The terms _aqua\r\nfortis_ and _aqua regia_ had come into use prior to Agricola, but he\r\ndoes not use them; the Alchemists used various terms, often _aqua\r\ndissolvia_. It is apparent from the uses to which this reagent was put\r\nin separating gold and silver, from the method of clarifying it with\r\nsilver and from the red fumes, that Agricola could have had practical\r\ncontact only with nitric acid. It is probable that he has copied part of\r\nthe recipes for the compounds to be distilled from the Alchemists and\r\nfrom such works as the _Probierbuechlein_. In any event he could not have\r\nhad experience with them all, for in some cases the necessary\r\ningredients for making nitric acid are not all present, and therefore\r\ncould be of no use for gold and silver separation. The essential\r\ningredients for the production of this acid by distillation, were\r\nsaltpetre, water, and either vitriol or alum. The other substances\r\nmentioned were unnecessary, and any speculation as to the combinations\r\nwhich would result, forms a useful exercise in chemistry, but of little\r\npurpose here. The first recipe would no doubt produce hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n[4] Agricola, in the _Interpretatio_, gives the German equivalent for\r\nthe Latin _aerugo_ as _Spanschgruen_--\"because it was first brought to\r\nGermany from Spain; foreigners call it _viride aeris_ (copper green).\"\r\nThe English \"verdigris\" is a corruption of _vert de grice_. Both\r\nverdigris and white lead were very ancient products, and they naturally\r\nfind mention together among the ancient authors. The earliest\r\ndescription of the method of making is from the 3rd Century B.C., by\r\nTheophrastus, who says (101-2): \"But these are works of art, as is also\r\nCeruse (_psimythion_) to make which, lead is placed in earthen vessels\r\nover sharp vinegar, and after it has acquired some thickness of a kind\r\nof rust, which it commonly does in about ten days, they open the vessels\r\nand scrape off, as it were, a kind of foulness; they then place the lead\r\nover the vinegar again, repeating over and over again the same method of\r\nscraping it till it is wholly dissolved; what has been scraped off they\r\nthen beat to powder and boil for a long time; and what at last subsides\r\nto the bottom of the vessel is the white lead.... Also in a manner\r\nsomewhat resembling this, verdigris (_ios_) is made, for copper is\r\nplaced over lees of wine (grape refuse?), and the rust which it acquires\r\nby this means is taken off for use. And it is by this means that the\r\nrust which appears is produced.\" (Based on Hill's translation.)\r\nVitruvius (VII, 12), Dioscorides (V, 51), and Pliny (XXXIV, 26 and 54),\r\nall describe the method of making somewhat more elaborately.\r\n\r\n[5] _Amiantus_ (_Interpretatio_ gives _federwis_, _pliant_,\r\n_salamanderhar_). From Agricola's elaborate description in _De Natura\r\nFossilium_ (p. 252) there can be no doubt that he means asbestos. This\r\nmineral was well-known to the Ancients, and is probably earliest\r\nreferred to (3rd Century B.C.) by Theophrastus in the following passage\r\n(29): \"There is also found in the mines of Scaptesylae a stone, in its\r\nexternal appearance somewhat resembling wood, on which, if oil be\r\npoured, it burns; but when the oil is burnt away, the burning of the\r\nstone ceases, as if it were in itself not liable to such accidents.\"\r\nThere can be no doubt that Strabo (X, 1) describes the mineral: \"At\r\nCarystus there is found in the earth a stone, which is combed like wool,\r\nand woven, so that napkins are made of this substance, which, when\r\nsoiled, are thrown into the fire and cleaned, as in the washing of\r\nlinen.\" It is also described by Dioscorides (V, 113) and Pliny (XIX, 4).\r\nAsbestos cloth has been found in Pre-Augustinian Roman tombs.\r\n\r\n[6] This list of four recipes is even more obscure than the previous\r\nlist. If they were distilled, the first and second mixtures would not\r\nproduce nitric acid, although possibly some sulphuric would result. The\r\nthird might yield nitric, and the fourth _aqua regia_. In view of the\r\nwater, they were certainly not used as cements, and the first and second\r\nare deficient in the vital ingredients.\r\n\r\n[7] _Distillation_, at least in crude form, is very old. Aristotle\r\n(_Meteorologica_, IV.) states that sweet water can be made by\r\nevaporating salt-water and condensing the steam. Dioscorides and Pliny\r\nboth describe the production of mercury by distillation (note 58, p.\r\n432). The Alchemists of the Alexandrian School, from the 1st to the 6th\r\nCenturies, mention forms of imperfect apparatus--an ample discussion of\r\nwhich may be found in Kopp, _Beitraege zur Geschichte der Chemie_,\r\nBraunschweig, 1869, p. 217.\r\n\r\n[8] It is desirable to note the contents of the residues in the retort,\r\nfor it is our belief that these are the materials to which the author\r\nrefers as \"lees of the water which separates gold from silver,\" in many\r\nplaces in Book VII. They would be strange mixtures of sodium, potassium,\r\naluminium sulphates, with silica, brickdust, asbestos, and various\r\nproportions of undigested vitriol, salt, saltpetre, alum, iron oxides,\r\netc. Their effect must have been uncertain. Many old German metallurgies\r\nalso refer to the _Todenkopf der Scheidwasser_, among them the\r\n_Probierbuechlein_ before Agricola, and after him Lazarus Ercker\r\n(_Beschreibung Allerfuernemsten_, etc., Prague, 1574). See also note 16,\r\np. 234.\r\n\r\n[9] This use of silver could apply to one purpose only, that is, the\r\nelimination of minor amounts of hydrochloric from the nitric acid, the\r\nformer originating no doubt from the use of salt among the ingredients.\r\nThe silver was thus converted into a chloride and precipitated. This use\r\nof a small amount of silver to purify the nitric acid was made by\r\nmetallurgists down to fairly recent times. Biringuccio (IV, 2) and\r\nLazarus Ercker (p. 71) both recommend that the silver be dissolved first\r\nin a small amount of acid, and the solution poured into the\r\nnewly-manufactured supply. They both recommend preserving this\r\nprecipitate and its cupellation after melting with lead--which Agricola\r\napparently overlooked.\r\n\r\n[10] In this description of parting by nitric acid, the author digresses\r\nfrom his main theme on pages 444 and 445, to explain a method apparently\r\nfor small quantities where the silver was precipitated by copper, and to\r\ndescribe another cryptic method of precipitation. These subjects are\r\nreferred to in notes 11 and 12 below. The method of parting set out here\r\nfalls into six stages: _a_--cupellation, _b_--granulation, _c_--solution\r\nin acid, _d_--treatment of the gold residues, _e_--evaporation of the\r\nsolution, _f_--reduction of the silver nitrate. For nitric acid parting,\r\nbullion must be free from impurities, which cupellation would ensure; if\r\ncopper were left in, it would have the effect he mentions if we\r\nunderstand \"the silver separated from the gold soon unites with it\r\nagain,\" to mean that the silver unites with the copper, for the copper\r\nwould go into solution and come down with the silver on evaporation.\r\nAgricola does not specifically mention the necessity of an excess of\r\nsilver in this description, although he does so elsewhere, and states\r\nthat the ratio must be at least three parts silver to one part gold. The\r\nfirst description of the solution of the silver is clear enough, but\r\nthat on p. 445 is somewhat difficult to follow, for the author states\r\nthat the bullion is placed in a retort with the acid, and that\r\ndistillation is carried on between each additional charge of acid. So\r\nfar as the arrangement of a receiver might relate to the saving of any\r\nacid that came over accidentally in the boiling, it can be understood,\r\nbut to distill off much acid would soon result in the crystallization of\r\nthe silver nitrate, which would greatly impede the action of subsequent\r\nacid additions, and finally the gold could not be separated from such\r\nnitrate in the way described. The explanation may be (apart from\r\nincidental evaporation when heating) that the acids used were very weak,\r\nand that by the evaporation of a certain amount of water, not only was\r\nthe acid concentrated, but room was provided for the further charges.\r\nThe acid in the gold wash-water, mentioned in the following paragraph,\r\nwas apparently thus concentrated. The \"glass\" mentioned as being melted\r\nwith litharge, argols, nitre, etc., was no doubt the silver nitrate. The\r\nprecipitation of the silver from the solution as a chloride, by the use\r\nof salt, so generally used during the 18th and 19th Centuries, was known\r\nin Agricola's time, although he does not mention it. It is mentioned in\r\nGeber and the _Probierbuechlein_. The clarity of the latter on the\r\nsubject is of some interest (p. 34a): \"How to pulverise silver and again\r\nmake it into silver. Take the silver and dissolve it in water with the\r\n_starckenwasser_, _aqua fort_, and when that is done, take the silver\r\nwater and pour it into warm salty water, and immediately the silver\r\nsettles to the bottom and becomes powder. Let it stand awhile until it\r\nhas well settled, then pour away the water from it and dry the\r\nsettlings, which will become a powder like ashes. Afterward one can\r\nagain make it into silver. Take the powder and put it on a _test_, and\r\nadd thereto the powder from the settlings from which the _aqua forte_\r\nhas been made, and add lead. Then if there is a great deal, blow on it\r\nuntil the lead has incorporated itself ... blow it until it _plickt_\r\n(_blickens_). Then you will have as much silver as before.\"\r\n\r\n[11] The silver is apparently precipitated by the copper of the bowl. It\r\nwould seem that this method was in considerable use for small amounts of\r\nsilver nitrate in the 16th Century. Lazarus Ercker gives elaborate\r\ndirections for this method (_Beschreibung Allerfuernemsten_, etc.,\r\nPrague, 1574, p. 77).\r\n\r\n[12] We confess to a lack of understanding of this operation with leaves\r\nof lead and copper.\r\n\r\n[13] We do not understand this \"appearance of black.\" If the nitrate\r\ncame into contact with organic matter it would, of course, turn black by\r\nreduction of the silver, and sunlight would have the same effect.\r\n\r\n[14] This would be equal to from 62 to 94 parts of copper in 1,000.\r\n\r\n[15] As 144 _siliquae_ are 1 _uncia_, then 1/4 _siliqua_ in 8 _unciae_\r\nwould equal one part silver in 4,608 parts gold, or about 999.8 fine.\r\n\r\n[16] The object of this treatment with sulphur and copper is to separate\r\na considerable portion of silver from low-grade bullion (_i.e._, silver\r\ncontaining some gold), in preparation for final treatment of the richer\r\ngold-silver alloy with nitric acid. Silver sulphide is created by adding\r\nsulphur, and is drawn off in a silver-copper regulus. After the first\r\nsentence, the author uses silver alone where he obviously means silver\r\n\"containing some gold,\" and further he speaks of the \"gold lump\"\r\n(_massula_) where he likewise means a button containing a great deal of\r\nsilver. For clarity we introduced the term \"regulus\" for the Latin\r\n_mistura_. The operation falls into six stages: _a_, granulation; _b_,\r\nsulphurization of the granulated bullion; _c_, melting to form a\r\ncombination of the silver sulphide with copper into a regulus, an alloy\r\nof gold and silver settling out; _d_, repetition of the treatment to\r\nabstract further silver from the \"lump;\" _e_, refining the \"lump\" with\r\nnitric acid; _f_, recovery of the silver from the regulus by addition of\r\nlead, liquation and cupellation.\r\n\r\nThe use of a \"circle of fire\" secures a low temperature that would\r\nneither volatilize the sulphur nor melt the bullion. The amount of\r\nsulphur given is equal to a ratio of 48 parts bullion and 9 parts\r\nsulphur. We are not certain about the translation of the paragraph in\r\nrelation to the proportion of copper added to the granulated bullion;\r\nbecause in giving definite quantities of copper to be added in the\r\ncontingencies of various original copper contents in the bullion, it\r\nwould be expected that they were intended to produce some positive ratio\r\nof copper and silver. However, the ratio as we understand the text in\r\nvarious cases works out to irregular amounts, _i.e._, 48 parts of silver\r\nto 16, 12.6, 24, 20.5, 20.8, 17.8, or 18 parts of copper. In order to\r\nobtain complete separation there should be sufficient sulphur to have\r\nformed a sulphide of the copper as well as of the silver, or else some\r\nof the copper and silver would come down metallic with the \"lump\". The\r\nabove ratio of copper added to the sulphurized silver, in the first\r\ninstance would give about 18 parts of copper and 9 parts of sulphur to\r\n48 parts of silver. The copper would require 4.5 parts of sulphur to\r\nconvert it into sulphide, and the silver about 7 parts, or a total of\r\n11.5 parts required against 9 parts furnished. It is plain, therefore,\r\nthat insufficient sulphur is given. Further, the litharge would probably\r\ntake up some sulphur and throw down metallic lead into the \"lump\".\r\nHowever, it is necessary that there should be some free metallics to\r\ncollect the gold, and, therefore, the separation could not be complete\r\nin one operation. In any event, on the above ratios the \"gold lump\" from\r\nthe first operation was pretty coppery, and contained some lead and\r\nprobably a good deal of silver, because the copper would tend to\r\ndesulphurize the latter. The \"powder\" of glass-galls, salt, and litharge\r\nwould render the mass more liquid and assist the \"gold lump\" to separate\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe Roman silver _sesterce_, worth about 2-1/8 pence or 4.2 American\r\ncents, was no doubt used by Agricola merely to indicate an infinitesimal\r\nquantity. The test to be applied to the regulus by way of cupellation\r\nand parting of a sample with nitric acid, requires no explanation. The\r\ntruth of the description as to determining whether the gold had settled\r\nout, by using a chalked iron rod, can only be tested by actual\r\nexperiment. It is probable, however, that the sulphur in the regulus\r\nwould attack the iron and make it black. The re-melting of the regulus,\r\nif some gold remains in it, with copper and \"powder\" without more\r\nsulphur, would provide again free metallics to gather the remaining\r\ngold, and by desulphurizing some silver this button would probably not\r\nbe very pure.\r\n\r\nFrom the necessity for some free metallics besides the gold in the first\r\ntreatment, it will be seen that a repetition of the sulphur addition and\r\nre-melting is essential gradually to enrich the \"lump\". Why more copper\r\nis added is not clear. In the second melting, the ratio is 48 parts of\r\nthe \"gold lump\", 12 parts of sulphur and 12 parts copper. In this case\r\nthe added copper would require about 3 parts sulphur, and if we consider\r\nthe deficiency of sulphur in the first operations pertained entirely to\r\nthe copper, then about 2.5 parts would be required to make good the\r\nshortage, or in other words the second addition of sulphur is\r\nsufficient. In the final parting of the \"lump\" it will be noticed that\r\nthe author states that the silver ratio must be arranged as three of\r\nsilver to one of gold. As to the recovery of the silver from the\r\nregulus, he states that 66 _librae_ of silver give 132 _librae_ of\r\n_regulus_. To this, 500 _librae_ of lead are added, and it is melted in\r\nthe \"second\" furnace, and the litharge and hearth-lead made are\r\nre-melted in the \"first\" furnace, the cakes made being again treated in\r\nthe \"third\" furnace to separate the copper and lead. The \"first\" is\r\nusually the blast furnace, the \"second\" furnace is the cupellation\r\nfurnace, and the \"third\" the liquation furnace. It is difficult to\r\nunderstand this procedure. The charge sent to the cupellation furnace\r\nwould contain between 3% and 5% copper, and between 3% and 5% sulphur.\r\nHowever, possibly the sulphur and copper could be largely abstracted in\r\nthe skimmings from the cupellation furnace, these being subsequently\r\nliquated in the \"third\" furnace. It may be noted that two whole lines\r\nfrom this paragraph are omitted in the editions of _De Re Metallica_\r\nafter 1600. For historical note on sulphur separation see page 461.\r\n\r\n[17] There can be no doubt that in most instances Agricola's _stibium_\r\nis antimony sulphide, but it does not follow that it was the mineral\r\n_stibnite_, nor have we considered it desirable to introduce the\r\nprecision of either of these modern terms, and have therefore retained\r\nthe Latin term where the sulphide is apparently intended. The use of\r\nantimony sulphide to part silver from gold is based upon the greater\r\naffinity of silver than antimony for sulphur. Thus the silver, as in the\r\nlast process, is converted into a sulphide, and is absorbed in the\r\nregulus, while the metallic antimony alloys with the gold and settles to\r\nthe bottom of the pot. This process has several advantages over the\r\nsulphurization with crude sulphur; antimony is a more convenient vehicle\r\nof sulphur, for it saves the preliminary sulphurization with its\r\nattendant difficulties of volatilization of the sulphur; it also saves\r\nthe granulation necessary in the former method; and the treatment of the\r\nsubsequent products is simpler. However, it is possible that the\r\nsulphur-copper process was better adapted to bullion where the\r\nproportion of gold was low, because the fineness of the bullion\r\nmentioned in connection with the antimonial process was apparently much\r\nhigher than the previous process. For instance, a _bes_ of gold,\r\ncontaining 5, 6, or 7 double _sextulae_ of silver would be .792, .750 or\r\n.708 fine. The antimonial method would have an advantage over nitric\r\nacid separation, in that high-grade bullion could be treated direct\r\nwithout artificial decrease of fineness required by inquartation to\r\nabout .250 fine, with the consequent incidental losses of silver\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe process in this description falls into six operations: _a_,\r\nsulphurization of the silver by melting with antimony sulphide; _b_,\r\nseparation of the gold \"lump\" (_massula_) by jogging; _c_, re-melting\r\nthe regulus (_mistura_) three or four times for recovery of further\r\n\"lumps\"; _d_, re-melting of the \"lump\" four times, with further\r\nadditions of antimony sulphide; _e_, cupellation of the regulus to\r\nrecover the silver; _f_, cupellation of the antimony from the \"lump\" to\r\nrecover the gold. Percy seems to think it difficult to understand the\r\ninsistence upon the addition of copper. Biringuccio (IV, 6) states,\r\namong other things, that copper makes the ingredients more liquid. The\r\nlater metallurgists, however, such as Ercker, Lohneys, and Schlueter, do\r\nnot mention this addition; they do mention the \"swelling and frothing,\"\r\nand recommend that the crucible should be only partly filled. As to the\r\ncopper, we suggest that it would desulphurize part of the antimony and\r\nthus free some of that metal to collect the gold. If we assume bullion\r\nof the medium fineness mentioned and containing no copper, then the\r\nproportions in the first charge would be about 36 parts gold, 12 parts\r\nsilver, 41 parts sulphur, 103 parts antimony, and 9 parts copper. The\r\nsilver and copper would take up 4.25 parts of sulphur, and thus free\r\nabout 10.6 parts of antimony as metallics. It would thus appear that the\r\namount of metallics provided to assist the collection of the gold was\r\nlittle enough, and that the copper in freeing 5.6 parts of the antimony\r\nwas useful. It appears to have been necessary to have a large excess of\r\nantimony sulphide; for even with the great surplus in the first charge,\r\nthe reaction was only partial, as is indicated by the necessity for\r\nrepeated melting with further antimony.\r\n\r\nThe later metallurgists all describe the separation of the metallic\r\nantimony from the gold as being carried out by oxidation of the\r\nantimony, induced by a jet of air into the crucible, this being\r\ncontinued until the mass appears limpid and no cloud forms in the\r\nsurface in cooling. Agricola describes the separation of the silver from\r\nthe regulus by preliminary melting with argols, glass-gall, and some\r\nlead, and subsequent cupellation of the lead-silver alloy. The statement\r\nthat unless this preliminary melting is done, the cupel will absorb\r\nsilver, might be consonant with an attempt at cupellation of sulphides,\r\nand it is difficult to see that much desulphurizing could take place\r\nwith the above fluxes. In fact, in the later descriptions of the\r\nprocess, iron is used in this melting, and we are under the impression\r\nthat Agricola had omitted this item for a desulphurizing reagent. At the\r\nDresden Mint, in the methods described by Percy (Metallurgy Silver and\r\nGold, p. 373) the gold lumps were tested for fineness, and from this the\r\namount of gold retained in the regulus was computed. It is not clear\r\nfrom Agricola's account whether the test with nitric acid was applied to\r\nthe regulus or to the \"lumps\". For historical notes see p. 461.\r\n\r\n[18] As will be shown in the historical note, this process of separating\r\ngold and silver is of great antiquity--in all probability the only\r\nprocess known prior to the Middle Ages, and in any event, the first one\r\nused. In general the process was performed by \"cementing\" the\r\ndisintegrated bullion with a paste and subjecting the mass to\r\nlong-continued heat at a temperature under the melting point of the\r\nbullion. The cement (_compositio_) is of two different species; in the\r\nfirst species saltpetre and vitriol and some aluminous or silicious\r\nmedium are the essential ingredients, and through them the silver is\r\nconverted into nitrate and absorbed by the mass; in the second species,\r\ncommon salt and the same sort of medium are the essentials, and in this\r\ncase the silver is converted into a chloride. Agricola does not\r\ndistinguish between these two species, for, as shown by the text, his\r\ningredients are badly mixed.\r\n\r\nThe process as here described falls into five operations: _a_,\r\ngranulation of the bullion or preparation of leaves; _b_, heating\r\nalternate layers of cement and bullion in pots; _c_, washing the gold to\r\nfree it of cement; _d_, melting the gold with borax or soda; _e_,\r\ntreatment of the cement by way of melting with lead and cupellation to\r\nrecover the silver. Investigation by Boussingault (_Ann. De Chimie_,\r\n1833, p. 253-6), D'Elhuyar (_Bergbaukunde_, Leipzig, 1790, Vol. II, p.\r\n200), and Percy (Metallurgy of Silver and Gold, p. 395), of the action\r\nof common salt upon silver under cementation conditions, fairly well\r\ndemonstrated the reactions involved in the use of this species of\r\ncement. Certain factors are essential besides salt: _a_, the admission\r\nof air, which is possible through the porous pots used; _b_, the\r\npresence of some moisture to furnish hydrogen; _c_, the addition of\r\nalumina or silica. The first would be provided by Agricola in the use of\r\nnew pots, the second possibly by use of wood fuel in a closed furnace,\r\nthe third by the inclusion of brickdust. The alumina or silica at high\r\ntemperatures decomposes the salt, setting free hydrochloric acid and\r\nprobably also free chlorine. The result of the addition of vitriol in\r\nAgricola's ingredients is not discussed by those investigators, but\r\ninasmuch as vitriol decomposes into sulphuric acid under high\r\ntemperatures, this acid would react upon the salt to free hydrochloric\r\nacid, and thus assist to overcome deficiencies in the other factors. It\r\nis possible also that sulphuric acid under such conditions would react\r\ndirectly upon the silver to form silver sulphates, which would be\r\nabsorbed into the cement. As nitric acid is formed by vitriol and\r\nsaltpetre at high temperatures, the use of these two substances as a\r\ncementing compound would produce nitric acid, which would at once attack\r\nthe silver to form silver nitrate, which would be absorbed into the\r\nmelted cement. In this case the brickdust probably acted merely as a\r\nvehicle for the absorption, and to lower the melting point of the mass\r\nand prevent fusion of the metal. While nitric acid will only part gold\r\nand silver when the latter is in great excess, yet when applied as fumes\r\nunder cementation conditions it appears to react upon a minor ratio of\r\nsilver. While the reactions of the two above species of compounds can be\r\naccounted for in a general way, the problem furnished by Agricola's\r\nstatements is by no means simple, for only two of his compounds are\r\nsimply salt cements, the others being salt and nitre mixtures. An\r\ninspection of these compounds produces at once a sense of confusion.\r\nSalt is present in every compound, saltpetre in all but two, vitriol in\r\nall but three. Lewis (_Traite Singulier de Metallique_, Paris, 1743, II,\r\npp. 48-60), in discussing these processes, states that salt and\r\nsaltpetre must never be used together, as he asserts that in this case\r\n_aqua regia_ would be formed and the gold dissolved. Agricola, however,\r\napparently found no such difficulty. As to the other ingredients, apart\r\nfrom nitre, salt, vitriol, and brickdust, they can have been of no use.\r\nAgricola himself points out that ingredients of \"metallic origin\"\r\ncorrupt the gold and that brickdust and common salt are sufficient. In a\r\ndescription of this process in the _Probierbuechlein_ (p. 58), no nitre\r\nis mentioned. This booklet does mention the recovery of the silver from\r\nthe cement by amalgamation with mercury--the earliest mention of silver\r\namalgamation.\r\n\r\n[19] While a substance which we now know to be natural zinc sulphate was\r\nknown to Agricola (see note 11, p. 572), it is hardly possible that it\r\nis referred to here. If green vitriol be dehydrated and powdered, it is\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n[20] The processes involved by these \"other\" compounds are difficult to\r\nunderstand, because of the lack of information given as to the method of\r\noperation. It might be thought that these were five additional recipes\r\nfor cementing pastes, but an inspection of their internal composition\r\nsoon dissipates any such assumption, because, apart from the lack of\r\nbrickdust or some other similar necessary ingredient, they all contain\r\nmore or less sulphur. After describing a preliminary treatment of the\r\nbullion by cupellation, the author says: \"Then the silver is sprinkled\r\nwith two _unciae_ of that powdered compound and is stirred. Afterward it\r\nis poured into another crucible ... and violently shaken. The rest is\r\nperformed according to the process I have already explained.\" As he has\r\nalready explained four or five parting processes, it is not very clear\r\nto which one this refers. In fact, the whole of this discussion reads as\r\nif he were reporting hearsay, for it lacks in every respect the infinite\r\ndetail of his usual descriptions. In any event, if the powder was\r\nintroduced into the molten bullion, the effect would be to form some\r\nsilver sulphides in a regulus of different composition depending upon\r\nthe varied ingredients of different compounds. The enriched bullion was\r\nsettled out in a \"lump\" and treated \"as I have explained,\" which is not\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n[21] HISTORICAL NOTE ON PARTING GOLD AND SILVER. Although the earlier\r\nClassics contain innumerable references to refining gold and silver,\r\nthere is little that is tangible in them, upon which to hinge the\r\nmetallurgy of parting the precious metals. It appears to us, however,\r\nthat some ability to part the metals is implied in the use of the\r\ntouchstone, for we fail to see what use a knowledge of the ratio of gold\r\nand silver in bullion could have been without the power to separate\r\nthem. The touchstone was known to the Greeks at least as early as the\r\n5th Century B.C. (see note 37, p. 252), and a part of Theophrastus'\r\nstatement (LXXVIII.) on this subject bears repetition in this\r\nconnection: \"The nature of the stone which tries gold is also very\r\nwonderful, as it seems to have the same power as fire; which is also a\r\ntest of that metal.... The trial by fire is by the colour and the\r\nquantity lost by it, but that of the stone is made only by rubbing,\"\r\netc. This trial by fire certainly implies a parting of the metals. It\r\nhas been argued from the common use of _electrum_--a gold-silver\r\nalloy--by the Ancients, that they did not know how to part the two\r\nmetals or they would not have wasted gold in such a manner, but it seems\r\nto us that the very fact that _electrum_ was a positive alloy (20% gold,\r\n80% silver), and that it was deliberately made (Pliny XXXIII, 23) and\r\nheld of value for its supposed superior brilliancy to silver and the\r\nbelief that goblets made of it detected poison, is sufficient answer to\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nTo arrive by a process of elimination, we may say that in the Middle\r\nAges, between 1100 and 1500 A.D., there were known four methods of\r\nparting these metals: _a_, parting by solution in nitric acid; _b_,\r\nsulphurization of the silver in finely-divided bullion by heating it\r\nwith sulphur, and the subsequent removal of the silver sulphide in a\r\nregulus by melting with copper, iron, or lead; _c_, melting with an\r\nexcess of antimony sulphide, and the direct conversion of the silver to\r\nsulphide and its removal in a regulus; _d_, cementation of the\r\nfinely-divided bullion with salt, and certain necessary collateral\r\nre-agents, and the separation of the silver by absorption into the\r\ncement as silver chloride. Inasmuch as it can be clearly established\r\nthat mineral acids were unknown to the Ancients, we can eliminate that\r\nmethod. Further, we may say at once that there is not, so far as has yet\r\nbeen found, even a remote statement that could be applied to the\r\nsulphide processes. As to cementation with salt, however, we have some\r\ndata at about the beginning of the Christian Era.\r\n\r\nBefore entering into a more detailed discussion of the history of\r\nvarious processes, it may be useful, in a word, to fix in the mind of\r\nthe reader our view of the first authority on various processes, and his\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n     (1) Separation by cementation with salt, Strabo (?) 63 B.C.-24\r\n         A.D.; Pliny 23-79 A.D.\r\n\r\n     (2) Separation by sulphur, Theophilus, 1150-1200 A.D.\r\n\r\n     (3) Separation by nitric acid, Geber, prior to 14th Century.\r\n\r\n     (4) Separation by antimony sulphide, Basil Valentine, end 14th\r\n         Century, or _Probierbuechlein_, beginning 15th Century.\r\n\r\n     (5) Separation by antimony sulphide and copper, or sulphur and\r\n         copper, _Probierbuechlein_, beginning 15th Century.\r\n\r\n     (6) Separation by cementation with saltpetre, Agricola, 1556.\r\n\r\n     (7) Separation by sulphur and iron, Schlueter, 1738.\r\n\r\n     (8) Separation by sulphuric acid, D'Arcet, 1802.\r\n\r\n     (9) Separation by chloride gas, Thompson, 1833.\r\n\r\n    (10) Separation electrolytically, latter part 19th Century.\r\n\r\nPARTING BY CEMENTATION. The following passage from Strabo is of prime\r\ninterest as the first definite statement on parting of any kind (III, 2,\r\n8): \"That when they have melted the gold and purified it by means of a\r\nkind of aluminous earth, the residue left is _electrum_. This, which\r\ncontains a mixture of silver and gold, being again subjected to the\r\nfire, the silver is separated and the gold left (pure); for this metal\r\nis easily dissipated and fat, and on this account gold is most easily\r\nmolten by straw, the flame of which is soft, and bearing a similarity\r\n(to the gold) causes it easily to dissolve, whereas coal, besides\r\nwasting a great deal, melts it too much, by reason of its vehemence, and\r\ncarries it off (in vapour).\" This statement has provoked the liveliest\r\ndiscussion, not only on account of the metallurgical interest and\r\nobscurity, but also because of differences of view as to its\r\ntranslation; we have given that of Mr. H. C. Hamilton (London, 1903). A\r\nreview of this discussion will be found in Percy's Metallurgy of Gold\r\nand Silver, p. 399. That it refers to cementation at all hangs by a\r\nslender thread, but it seems more nearly this than anything else.\r\n\r\nPliny (XXXIII, 25) is a little more ample: \"(The gold) is heated with\r\ndouble its weight of salt and thrice its weight of _misy_, and again\r\nwith two portions of salt and one of a stone which they call _schistos_.\r\nThe _virus_ is drawn out when these things are burnt together in an\r\nearthen crucible, itself remaining pure and incorrupt, the remaining ash\r\nbeing preserved in an earthen pot and mixed with water as a lotion for\r\n_lichen_ (ring-worm) on the face.\" Percy (Metallurgy Silver and Gold, p.\r\n398) rightly considers that this undoubtedly refers to the parting of\r\nsilver and gold by cementation with common salt. Especially as Pliny\r\nfurther on states that with regard to _misy_, \"In purifying gold they\r\nmix it with this substance.\" There can be no doubt from the explanations\r\nof Pliny and Dioscorides that _misy_ was an oxidized pyrite, mostly iron\r\nsulphate. Assuming the latter case, then all of the necessary elements\r\nof cementation, _i.e._, vitriol, salt, and an aluminous or silicious\r\nelement, are present.\r\n\r\nThe first entirely satisfactory evidence on parting is to be found in\r\nTheophilus (12th Century), and we quote the following from Hendrie's\r\ntranslation (p. 245): \"Of Heating the Gold. Take gold, of whatsoever\r\nsort it may be, and beat it until thin leaves are made in breadth three\r\nfingers, and as long as you can. Then cut out pieces that are equally\r\nlong and wide and join them together equally, and perforate through all\r\nwith a fine cutting iron. Afterwards take two earthen pots proved in the\r\nfire, of such size that the gold can lie flat in them, and break a tile\r\nvery small, or clay of the furnace burned and red, weigh it, powdered,\r\ninto two equal parts, and add to it a third part salt for the same\r\nweight; which things being slightly sprinkled with urine, are mixed\r\ntogether so that they may not adhere together, but are scarcely wetted,\r\nand put a little of it upon a pot about the breadth of the gold, then a\r\npiece of the gold itself, and again the composition, and again the gold,\r\nwhich in the digestion is thus always covered, that gold may not be in\r\ncontact with gold; and thus fill the pot to the top and cover it above\r\nwith another pot, which you carefully lute round with clay, mixed and\r\nbeaten, and you place it over the fire, that it may be dried. In the\r\nmeantime compose a furnace from stones and clay, two feet in height, and\r\na foot and a half in breadth, wide at the bottom, but narrow at the top,\r\nwhere there is an opening in the middle, in which project three long and\r\nhard stones, which may be able to sustain the flame for a long time,\r\nupon which you place the pots with the gold, and cover them with other\r\ntiles in abundance. Then supply fire and wood, and take care that a\r\ncopious fire is not wanting for the space of a day and night. In the\r\nmorning taking out the gold, again melt, beat and place it in the\r\nfurnace as before. Again also, after a day and night, take it away and\r\nmixing a little copper with it, melt it as before, and replace it upon\r\nthe furnace. And when you have taken it away a third time, wash and dry\r\nit carefully, and so weighing it, see how much is wanting, then fold it\r\nup and keep it.\"\r\n\r\nThe next mention is by Geber, of whose date and authenticity there is\r\ngreat doubt, but, in any event, the work bearing his name is generally\r\nconsidered to be prior to the 14th, although he has been placed as early\r\nas the 8th Century. We quote from Russell's translation, pp. 17 and 224,\r\nwhich we have checked with the Latin edition of 1542: \"Sol, or gold, is\r\nbeaten into thin plates and with them and common salt very well prepared\r\nlay upon lay in a vessel of calcination which set into the furnace and\r\ncalcine well for three days until the whole is subtily calcined. Then\r\ntake it out, grind well and wash it with vinegar, and dry it in the sun.\r\nAfterwards grind it well with half its weight of cleansed\r\n_sal-armoniac_; then set it to be dissolved until the whole be dissolved\r\ninto most clear water.\" Further on: \"Now we will declare the way of\r\ncementing. Seeing it is known to us that cement is very necessary in the\r\nexamen of perfection, we say it is compounded of inflammable things. Of\r\nthis kind are, all blackening, flying, penetrating, and burned things;\r\nas is vitriol, _sal-armoniac_, _flos aeris_ (copper oxide scales) and\r\nthe ancient _fictile_ stone (earthen pots), and a very small quantity,\r\nor nothing, of sulphur, and urine with like acute and penetrating\r\nthings. All these are impasted with urine and spread upon thin plates of\r\nthat body which you intend shall be examined by this way of probation.\r\nThen the said plates must be laid upon a grate of iron included in an\r\nearthen vessel, yet so as one touch not the other that the virtue of the\r\nfire may have free and equal access to them. Thus the whole must be kept\r\nin fire in a strong earthen vessel for the space of three days. But here\r\ngreat caution is required that the plates may be kept but not melt.\"\r\n\r\nAlbertus Magnus (1205-1280) _De Mineralibus et Rebus Metallicis_, Lib.\r\nIV, describes the process as follows:--\"But when gold is to be purified\r\nan earthen vessel is made like a cucurbit or dish, and upon it is placed\r\na similar vessel; and they are luted together with the tenacious lute\r\ncalled by alchemists the lute of wisdom. In the upper vessel there are\r\nnumerous holes by which vapour and smoke may escape; afterwards the gold\r\nin the form of short thin leaves is arranged in the vessel, the leaves\r\nbeing covered consecutively with a mixture obtained by mixing together\r\nsoot, salt, and brick dust; and the whole is strongly heated until the\r\ngold becomes perfectly pure and the base substances with which it was\r\nmixed are consumed.\" It will be noted that salt is the basis of all\r\nthese cement compounds. We may also add that those of Biringuccio and\r\nall other writers prior to Agricola were of the same kind, our author\r\nbeing the first to mention those with nitre.\r\n\r\nPARTING WITH NITRIC ACID. The first mention of nitric acid is in\r\nconnection with this purpose, and, therefore, the early history of this\r\nreagent becomes the history of the process. Mineral acids of any kind\r\nwere unknown to the Greeks or Romans. The works of the Alchemists and\r\nothers from the 12th to the 15th Centuries, have been well searched by\r\nchemical historians for indications of knowledge of the mineral acids,\r\nand many of such suspected indications are of very doubtful order. In\r\nany event, study of the Alchemists for the roots of chemistry is fraught\r\nwith the greatest difficulty, for not only is there the large ratio of\r\nfraud which characterised their operations, but there is even the much\r\nlarger field of fraud which characterised the authorship and dates of\r\nwriting attributed to various members of the cult. The mention of\r\nsaltpetre by Roger Bacon (1214-94), and Albertus Magnus (1205-80), have\r\ncaused some strain to read a knowledge of mineral acids into their\r\nworks, but with doubtful result. Further, the Monk Theophilus\r\n(1150-1200) is supposed to have mentioned products which would be\r\nmineral acids, but by the most careful scrutiny of that work we have\r\nfound nothing to justify such an assertion, and it is of importance to\r\nnote that as Theophilus was a most accomplished gold and silver worker,\r\nhis failure to mention it is at least evidence that the process was not\r\ngenerally known. The transcribed manuscripts and later editions of such\r\nauthors are often altered to bring them \"up-to-date.\" The first mention\r\nis in the work attributed to Geber, as stated above, of date prior to\r\nthe 14th Century. The following passage from his _De Inventione\r\nVeritatis_ (Nuremberg edition, 1545, p. 182) is of interest:--\"First\r\ntake one _libra_ of vitriol of Cyprus and one-half _libra_ of saltpetre\r\nand one-quarter of alum of Jameni, extract the _aqua_ with the redness\r\nof the alembic--for it is very solvative--and use as in the foregoing\r\nchapters. This can be made acute if in it you dissolve a quarter of\r\nsal-ammoniac, which dissolves gold, sulphur, and silver.\" Distilling\r\nvitriol, saltpetre and alum would produce nitric acid. The addition of\r\nsal-ammoniac would make _aqua regia_; Geber used this solvent\r\nwater--probably without being made \"more acute\"--to dissolve silver, and\r\nhe crystallized out silver nitrate. It would not be surprising to find\r\nall the Alchemists subsequent to Geber mentioning acids. It will thus be\r\nseen that even the approximate time at which the mineral-acids were\r\nfirst made cannot be determined, but it was sometime previous to the\r\n15th Century, probably not earlier than the 12th Century. Beckmann\r\n(Hist. of Inventions II, p. 508) states that it appears to have been an\r\nold tradition that acid for separating the precious metals was first\r\nused at Venice by some Germans; that they chiefly separated the gold\r\nfrom Spanish silver and by this means acquired great riches. Beckmann\r\nconsiders that the first specific description of the process seems to be\r\nin the work of William Budaeus (_De Asse_, 1516, III, p. 101), who\r\nspeaks of it as new at this time. He describes the operation of one, Le\r\nConte, at Paris, who also acquired a fortune through the method.\r\nBeckmann and others have, however, entirely overlooked the early\r\n_Probierbuechlein_. If our conclusions are correct that the first of\r\nthese began to appear at about 1510, then they give the first\r\ndescription of inquartation. This book (see appendix) is made up of\r\nrecipes, like a cook-book, and four or five different recipes are given\r\nfor this purpose; of these we give one, which sufficiently indicates a\r\nknowledge of the art (p. 39): \"If you would part them do it this way:\r\nBeat the silver which you suppose to contain gold, as thin as possible;\r\ncut it in small pieces and place it in 'strong' water (_starkwasser_).\r\nPut it on a mild fire till it becomes warm and throws up blisters or\r\nbubbles. Then take it and pour off the water into a copper-bowl; let it\r\nstand and cool. Then the silver settles itself round the copper bowl;\r\nlet the silver dry in the copper bowl, then pour the water off and melt\r\nthe silver in a crucible. Then take the gold also out of the glass\r\n_kolken_ and melt it together.\" Biringuccio (1540, Book VI.) describes\r\nthe method, but with much less detail than Agricola. He made his acid\r\nfrom alum and saltpetre and calls it _lacque forti_.\r\n\r\nPARTING WITH SULPHUR. This process first appears in Theophilus\r\n(1150-1200), and in form is somewhat different from that mentioned by\r\nAgricola. We quote from Hendrie's Translation, p. 317, \"How gold is\r\nseparated from silver. When you have scraped the gold from silver, place\r\nthis scraping in a small cup in which gold or silver is accustomed to be\r\nmelted, and press a small linen cloth upon it, that nothing may by\r\nchance be abstracted from it by the wind of the bellows, and placing it\r\nbefore the furnace, melt it; and directly lay fragments of sulphur in\r\nit, according to the quantity of the scraping, and carefully stir it\r\nwith a thin piece of charcoal until its fumes cease; and immediately\r\npour it into an iron mould. Then gently beat it upon the anvil lest by\r\nchance some of that black may fly from it which the sulphur has burnt,\r\nbecause it is itself silver. For the sulphur consumes nothing of the\r\ngold, but the silver only, which it thus separates from the gold, and\r\nwhich you will carefully keep. Again melt this gold in the same small\r\ncup as before, and add sulphur. This being stirred and poured out, break\r\nwhat has become black and keep it, and do thus until the gold appear\r\npure. Then gather together all that black, which you have carefully\r\nkept, upon the cup made from the bone and ash, and add lead, and so burn\r\nit that you may recover the silver. But if you wish to keep it for the\r\nservice of niello, before you burn it add to it copper and lead,\r\naccording to the measure mentioned above, and mix with sulphur.\" This\r\nprocess appears in the _Probierbuechlein_ in many forms, different\r\nrecipes containing other ingredients besides sulphur, such as salt,\r\nsaltpetre, sal-ammoniac, and other things more or less effective. In\r\nfact, a series of hybrid methods between absolute melting with sulphur\r\nand cementation with salt, were in use, much like those mentioned by\r\nAgricola on p. 458.\r\n\r\nPARTING WITH ANTIMONY SULPHIDE. The first mention of this process lies\r\neither in Basil Valentine's \"Triumphant Chariot of Antimony\" or in the\r\nfirst _Probierbuechlein_. The date to be assigned to the former is a\r\nmatter of great doubt. It was probably written about the end of the 15th\r\nCentury, but apparently published considerably later. The date of the\r\n_Probierbuechlein_ we have referred to above. The statement in the\r\n\"Triumphal Chariot\" is as follows (Waite's Translation, p. 117-118):\r\n\"The elixir prepared in this way has the same power of penetrating and\r\npervading the body with its purifying properties that antimony has of\r\npenetrating and purifying gold.... This much, however, I have proved\r\nbeyond a possibility of doubt, that antimony not only purifies gold and\r\nfrees it from foreign matter, but it also ameliorates all other metals,\r\nbut it does the same for animal bodies.\" There are most specific\r\ndescriptions of this process in the other works attributed to Valentine,\r\nbut their authenticity is so very doubtful that we do not quote. The\r\n_Probierbuechlein_ gives several recipes for this process, all to the\r\nsame metallurgical effect, of which we quote two: \"How to separate\r\nsilver from gold. Take 1 part of golden silver, 1 part of _spiesglass_,\r\n1 part copper, 1 part lead; melt them together in a crucible. When\r\nmelted pour into the crucible pounded sulphur and directly you have\r\npoured it in cover it up with soft lime so that the fumes cannot escape,\r\nand let it get cold and you will find your gold in a button. Put that\r\nsame in a pot and blow on it.\" \"How to part gold and silver by melting\r\nor fire. Take as much gold-silver as you please and granulate it; take 1\r\n_mark_ of these grains, 1 _mark_ of powder; put them together in a\r\ncrucible. Cover it with a small cover, put it in the fire, and let it\r\nslowly heat; blow on it gently until it melts; stir it all well together\r\nwith a stick, pour it out into a mould, strike the mould gently with a\r\nknife so that the button may settle better, let it cool, then turn the\r\nmould over, strike off the button and twice as much _spiesglas_ as the\r\nbutton weighs, put them in a crucible, blow on it till it melts, then\r\npour it again into a mould and break away the button as at first. If you\r\nwant the gold to be good always add to the button twice as much\r\n_spiesglass_. It is usually good gold in three meltings. Afterward take\r\nthe button, place it on a cupel, blow on it till it melts. And if it\r\nshould happen that the gold is covered with a membrane, then add a very\r\nlittle lead, then it shines (_plickt_) and becomes clearer.\" Biringuccio\r\n(1540) also gives a fairly clear exposition of this method. All the old\r\nrefiners varied the process by using mixtures of salt, antimony\r\nsulphide, and sulphur, in different proportions, with and without lead\r\nor copper; the net effect was the same. Later than Agricola these\r\nmethods of parting bullion by converting the silver into a sulphide and\r\ncarrying it off in a regulus took other forms. For instance, Schlueter\r\n(_Huette-Werken_, Braunschweig, 1738) describes a method by which, after\r\nthe granulated bullion had been sulphurized by cementation with sulphur\r\nin pots, it was melted with metallic iron. Lampadius (_Grundriss Einer\r\nAllgemeinen Huettenkunde_, Goettingen, 1827) describes a treatment of the\r\nbullion, sulphurized as above, with litharge, thus creating a\r\nlead-silver regulus and a lead-silver-gold bullion which had to be\r\nrepeatedly put through the same cycle. The principal object of these\r\nprocesses was to reduce silver bullion running low in gold to a ratio\r\nacceptable for nitric acid treatment.\r\n\r\nBefore closing the note on the separation of gold and silver, we may add\r\nthat with regard to the three processes largely used to-day, the\r\nseparation by solution of the silver from the bullion by concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid where silver sulphate is formed, was first described by\r\nD'Arcet, Paris, in 1802; the separation by introducing chlorine gas into\r\nthe molten bullion and thus forming silver chlorides was first described\r\nby Lewis Thompson in a communication to the Society of Arts, 1833, and\r\nwas first applied on a large scale by F. B. Miller at the Sydney Mint in\r\n1867-70; we do not propose to enter into the discussion as to who is the\r\ninventor of electrolytic separation.\r\n\r\n[22] There were three methods of gilding practised in the Middle\r\nAges--the first by hammering on gold leaf; the second by laying a thin\r\nplate of gold on a thicker plate of silver, expanding both together, and\r\nfabricating the articles out of the sheets thus prepared; and the third\r\nby coating over the article with gold amalgam, and subsequently driving\r\noff the mercury by heat. Copper and iron objects were silver-plated by\r\nimmersing them in molten silver after coating with sal-ammoniac or\r\nborax. Tinning was done in the same way.\r\n\r\n[23] See note 12, p. 297, for complete discussion of amalgamation.\r\n\r\n[24] These nine methods of separating gold from copper are based\r\nfundamentally upon the sulphur introduced in each case, whereby the\r\ncopper is converted into sulphides and separated off as a matte. The\r\nvarious methods are much befogged by the introduction of extraneous\r\ningredients, some of which serve as fluxes, while others would provide\r\nmetallics in the shape of lead or antimony for collection of the gold,\r\nbut others would be of no effect, except to increase the matte or slag.\r\nInspection will show that the amount of sulphur introduced in many\r\ninstances is in so large ratio that unless a good deal of volatilization\r\ntook place there would be insufficient metallics to collect the gold, if\r\nit happened to be in small quantities. In a general way the auriferous\r\nbutton is gradually impoverished in copper until it is fit for\r\ncupellation with lead, except in one case where the final stage is\r\naccomplished by amalgamation. The lore of the old refiners was much\r\nafter the order of that of modern cooks--they treasured and handed down\r\nvarious efficacious recipes, and of those given here most can be found\r\nin identical terms in the _Probierbuechlein_, some editions of which, as\r\nmentioned before, were possibly fifty years before _De Re Metallica_.\r\nThis knowledge, no doubt, accumulated over long experience; but, so far\r\nas we are aware, there is no description of sulphurizing copper for this\r\npurpose prior to the publication mentioned.\r\n\r\n[25] _Sal artificiosus_. The compound given under this name is of quite\r\ndifferent ingredients from the stock fluxes given in Book VII under the\r\nsame term. The method of preparation, no doubt, dehydrated this one; it\r\nwould, however, be quite effective for its purpose of sulphurizing the\r\ncopper. There is a compound given in the _Probierbuechlein_ identical\r\nwith this, and it was probably Agricola's source of information.\r\n\r\n[26] Throughout the book the cupellation furnace is styled the _secunda\r\nfornax_ (Glossary, _Treibeherd_). Except in one or two cases, where\r\nthere is some doubt as to whether the author may not refer to the second\r\nvariety of blast furnace, we have used \"cupellation furnace.\" Agricola's\r\ndescription of the actual operation of the old German cupellation is\r\nless detailed than that of such authors as Schlueter (_Huette-Werken_,\r\nBraunschweig, 1738) or Winkler (_Beschreibung der Freyberger Schmelz\r\nHuttenprozesse_, Freyberg, 1837). The operation falls into four periods.\r\nIn the first period, or a short time after melting, the first scum--the\r\n_abzug_--arises. This material contains most of the copper, iron, zinc,\r\nor sulphur impurities in the lead. In the second period, at a higher\r\ntemperature, and with the blast turned on, a second scum arises--the\r\n_abstrich_. This material contains most of the antimony and arsenical\r\nimpurities. In the third stage the litharge comes over. At the end of\r\nthis stage the silver brightens--\"_blicken_\"--due to insufficient\r\nlitharge to cover the entire surface. Winkler gives the following\r\naverage proportion of the various products from a charge of 100\r\n_centners_:--\r\n\r\n  _Abzug_               2      _centners_, containing 64% lead\r\n  _Abstrich_            5-1/2     \"           \"       73%  \"\r\n  _Herdtplei_          21-1/2     \"           \"       60%  \"\r\n  Impure litharge      18         \"           \"       85%  \"\r\n  Litharge             66         \"           \"       89%  \"\r\n                      ---\r\n            Total     113 _centners_\r\n\r\nHe estimates the lead loss at from 8% to 15%, and gives the average\r\nsilver contents of _blicksilber_ as about 90%. Many analyses of the\r\nvarious products may be found in Percy (Metallurgy of Lead, pp.\r\n198-201), Schnabel and Lewis (Metallurgy, Vol. I, p. 581); but as they\r\nmust vary with every charge, a repetition of them here is of little\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTE ON CUPELLATION. The cupellation process is of great\r\nantiquity, and the separation of silver from lead in this manner very\r\nprobably antedates the separation of gold and silver. We can be certain\r\nthat the process has been used continuously for at least 2,300 years,\r\nand was only supplanted in part by Pattinson's crystallization process\r\nin 1833, and further invaded by Parks' zinc method in 1850, and during\r\nthe last fifteen years further supplanted in some works by electrolytic\r\nmethods. However, it yet survives as an important process. It seems to\r\nus that there is no explanation possible of the recovery of the large\r\namounts of silver possessed from the earliest times, without assuming\r\nreduction of that metal with lead, and this necessitates cupellation. If\r\nthis be the case, then cupellation was practised in 2500 B.C. The\r\nsubject has been further discussed on p. 389. The first direct evidence\r\nof the process, however, is from the remains at Mt. Laurion (note 6, p.\r\n27), where the period of greatest activity was at 500 B.C., and it was\r\nprobably in use long before that time. Of literary evidences, there are\r\nthe many metaphorical references to \"fining silver\" and \"separating\r\ndross\" in the Bible, such as Job (XXVIII, 1), Psalms (XII, 6, LXVI, 10),\r\nProverbs (XVII, 3). The most certain, however, is Jeremiah (VI, 28-30):\r\n\"They are all brass [_sic_] and iron; they are corrupters. The bellows\r\nare burned, the lead is consumed in the fire, the founder melteth in\r\nvain; for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men\r\ncall them.\" Jeremiah lived about 600 B.C. His contemporary Ezekiel\r\n(XXII, 18) also makes remark: \"All they are brass and tin and iron and\r\nlead in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of the\r\nsilver.\" Among Greek authors Theognis (6th century B.C.) and Hippocrates\r\n(5th century B.C.) are often cited as mentioning the refining of gold\r\nwith lead, but we do not believe their statements will stand this\r\nconstruction without strain. Aristotle (Problems XXIV, 9) makes the\r\nfollowing remark, which has been construed not only as cupellation, but\r\nalso as the refining of silver in \"tests.\" \"What is the reason that\r\nboiling water does not leap out of the vessel ... silver also does this\r\nwhen it is purified. Hence those whose office it is in the silversmiths'\r\nshops to purify silver, derive gain by appropriation to themselves of\r\nthe sweepings of silver which leap out of the melting-pot.\"\r\n\r\nThe quotation of Diodorus Siculus from Agatharchides (2nd century B.C.)\r\non gold refining with lead and salt in Egypt we give in note 8, p. 279.\r\nThe methods quoted by Strabo (63 B.C.-24 A.D.) from Polybius (204-125\r\nB.C.) for treating silver, which appear to involve cupellation, are\r\ngiven in note 8, p. 281. It is not, however, until the beginning of the\r\nChristian era that we get definite literary information, especially with\r\nregard to litharge, in Dioscorides and Pliny. The former describes many\r\nsubstances under the terms _scoria_, _molybdaena_, _scoria argyros_ and\r\n_lithargyros_, which are all varieties of litharge. Under the latter\r\nterm he says (V, 62): \"One kind is produced from a lead sand\r\n(concentrates?), which has been heated in the furnaces until completely\r\nfused; another (is made) out of silver; another from lead. The best is\r\nfrom Attica, the second (best) from Spain; after that the kinds made in\r\nPuteoli, in Campania, and at Baia in Sicily, for in these places it is\r\nmostly produced by burning lead plates. The best of all is that which is\r\na bright golden colour, called _chrysitis_, that from Sicily (is called)\r\n_argyritis_, that made from silver is called _lauritis_.\" Pliny refers\r\nin several passages to litharge (_spuma argenti_) and to what is\r\nevidently cupellation, (XXXIII, 31): \"And this the same agency of fire\r\nseparates part into lead, which floats on the silver like oil on water\"\r\n(XXXIV, 47). \"The metal which flows liquid at the first melting is\r\ncalled _stannum_, the second melting is silver; that which remains in\r\nthe furnace is _galena_, which is added to a third part of the ore. This\r\nbeing again melted, produced lead with a deduction of two-ninths.\"\r\nAssuming _stannum_ to be silver-lead alloy, and _galena_ to be\r\n_molybdaena_, and therefore litharge, this becomes a fairly clear\r\nstatement of cupellation (see note 23, p. 392). He further states\r\n(XXXIII, 35): \"There is made in the same mines what is called _spuma\r\nargenti_ (litharge). There are three varieties of it; the best, known as\r\n_chrysitis_; the second best, which is called _argyritis_; and a third\r\nkind, which is called _molybditis_. And generally all these colours are\r\nto be found in the same tubes (see p. 480). The most approved kind is\r\nthat of Attica; the next, that which comes from Spain. _Chrysitis_ is\r\nthe product from the ore itself; _argyritis_ is made from the silver,\r\nand _molybditis_ is the result of smelting of lead, which is done at\r\nPuteoli, and from this has its name. All three are made as the material\r\nwhen smelted flows from an upper crucible into a lower one. From this\r\nlast it is raised with an iron bar, and is then twirled round in the\r\nflames in order to make it less heavy (made in tubes). Thus, as may be\r\neasily perceived from the name, it is in reality the _spuma_ of a\r\nboiling substance--of the future metal, in fact. It differs from slag in\r\nthe same way that the scum of a liquid differs from the lees, the one\r\nbeing purged from the material while purifying itself, the other an\r\nexcretion of the metal when purified.\"\r\n\r\nThe works of either Theophilus (1150-1200 A.D.) or Geber (prior to the\r\n14th century) are the first where adequate description of the cupel\r\nitself can be found. The uncertainty of dates renders it difficult to\r\nsay which is earliest. Theophilus (Hendrie's Trans., p. 317) says: \"How\r\ngold is separated from copper: But if at any time you have broken copper\r\nor silver-gilt vessels, or any other work, you can in this manner\r\nseparate the gold. Take the bones of whatever animal you please, which\r\n(bones) you may have found in the street, and burn them, being cold,\r\ngrind them finely, and mix with them a third part of beechwood ashes,\r\nand make cups as we have mentioned above in the purification of silver;\r\nyou will dry these at the fire or in the sun. Then you carefully scrape\r\nthe gold from the copper, and you will fold this scraping in lead beaten\r\nthin, and one of these cups being placed in the embers before the\r\nfurnace, and now become warm, you place in this fold of lead with the\r\nscraping, and coals being heaped upon it you will blow it. And when it\r\nhas become melted, in the same manner as silver is accustomed to be\r\npurified, sometimes by removing the embers and by adding lead, sometimes\r\nby re-cooking and warily blowing, you burn it until, the copper being\r\nentirely absorbed, the gold may appear pure.\"\r\n\r\nWe quote Geber from the Nuremberg edition of 1545, p. 152: \"Now we\r\ndescribe the method of this. Take sifted ashes or _calx_, or the powder\r\nof the burned bones of animals, or all of them mixed, or some of them;\r\nmoisten with water, and press it with your hand to make the mixture firm\r\nand solid, and in the middle of this bed make a round solid crucible and\r\nsprinkle a quantity of crushed glass. Then permit it to dry. When it is\r\ndry, place into the crucible that which we have mentioned which you\r\nintend to test. On it kindle a strong fire, and blow upon the surface of\r\nthe body that is being tested until it melts, which, when melted, piece\r\nafter piece of lead is thrown upon it, and blow over it a strong flame.\r\nWhen you see it agitated and moved with strong shaking motion it is not\r\npure. Then wait until all of the lead is exhaled. If it vanishes and\r\ndoes not cease its motion it is not purified. Then again throw lead and\r\nblow again until the lead separates. If it does not become quiet again,\r\nthrow in lead and blow on it until it is quiet and you see it bright and\r\nclear on the surface.\"\r\n\r\nCupellation is mentioned by most of the alchemists, but as a\r\nmetallurgical operation on a large scale the first description is by\r\nBiringuccio in 1540.\r\n\r\n[27] In Agricola's text this is \"first,\"--obviously an error.\r\n\r\n[28] The Roman _sextarius_ was about a pint.\r\n\r\n[29] This sentence continues, _Ipsa vero media pars praeterea digito_,\r\nto which we are unable to attribute any meaning.\r\n\r\n[30] _Thus_, or _tus_--\"incense.\"\r\n\r\n[31] One _centumpondium_, Roman, equals about 70.6 lbs. avoirdupois; one\r\n_centner_, old German, equals about 114.2 lbs. avoirdupois. Therefore,\r\nif German weights are meant, the maximum charge would be about 5.7 short\r\ntons; if Roman weights, about 3.5 short tons.\r\n\r\n[32] See description, p. 269.\r\n\r\n[33] _Stannum_, as a term for lead-silver alloys, is a term which\r\nAgricola (_De Natura Fossilium_, pp. 341-3) adopted from his views of\r\nPliny. In the _Interpretatio_ and the Glossary he gives the German\r\nequivalent as _werk_, which would sufficiently identify his meaning were\r\nit not obvious from the context. There can be little doubt that Pliny\r\nuses the term for lead alloys, but it had come into general use for tin\r\nbefore Agricola's time. The Roman term was _plumbum candidum_, and as a\r\nresult of Agricola's insistence on using it and _stannum_ in what he\r\nconceived was their original sense, he managed to give considerable\r\nconfusion to mineralogic literature for a century or two. The passages\r\nfrom Pliny, upon which he bases his use, are (XXXIV, 47): \"The metal\r\nwhich flows liquid at the first melting in the furnace is called\r\n_stannum_, the second melting is silver,\" etc. (XXXIV, 48): \"When copper\r\nvessels are coated with _stannum_ they produce a less disagreeable\r\nflavour, and it prevents verdigris. It is also remarkable that the\r\nweight is not increased.... At the present day a counterfeit _stannum_\r\nis made by adding one-third of white copper to tin. It is also made in\r\nanother way, by mixing together equal parts of tin and lead; this last\r\nis called by some _argentarium_.... There is also a composition called\r\n_tertiarium_, a mixture of two parts of lead and one of tin. Its price\r\nis twenty _denarii_ per pound, and it is used for soldering pipes.\r\nPersons still more dishonest mix together equal parts of _tertiarium_\r\nand tin, and calling the compound _argentarium_, when it is melted coat\r\narticles with it.\" Although this last passage probably indicates that\r\n_stannum_ was a tin compound, yet it is not inconsistent with the view\r\nthat the genuine _stannum_ was silver-lead, and that the counterfeits\r\nwere made as stated by Pliny. At what period the term _stannum_ was\r\nadopted for tin is uncertain. As shown by Beckmann (Hist. of Inventions\r\nII, p. 225), it is used as early as the 6th century in occasions where\r\ntin was undoubtedly meant. We may point out that this term appears\r\ncontinuously in the official documents relating to Cornish tin mining,\r\nbeginning with the report of William de Wrotham in 1198.\r\n\r\n[34] The Latin term for litharge is _spuma argenti_, spume of silver.\r\n\r\n[35] Pliny, XXXIII, 35. This quotation is given in full in the footnote\r\np. 466. Agricola illustrates these \"tubes\" of litharge on p. 481.\r\n\r\n[36] Assuming Roman weights, three _unciae_ and three _drachmae_ per\r\n_centumpondium_ would be about 82 ozs., and the second case would equal\r\nabout 85 ozs. per short ton.\r\n\r\n[37] Agricola uses throughout _De Re Metallica_ the term _molybdaena_\r\nfor this substance. It is obvious from the context that he means\r\nsaturated furnace bottoms--the _herdpley_ of the old German\r\nmetallurgists--and, in fact, he himself gives this equivalent in the\r\n_Interpretatio_, and describes it in great detail in _De Natura\r\nFossilium_ (p. 353). The derivatives coined one time and another from\r\nthe Greek _molybdos_ for lead, and their applications, have resulted in\r\na stream of wasted ink, to which we also must contribute. Agricola chose\r\nthe word _molybdaena_ in the sense here used from his interpretation of\r\nPliny. The statements in Pliny are a hopeless confusion of _molybdaena_\r\nand _galena_. He says (XXXIII, 35): \"There are three varieties of it\r\n(litharge)--the best-known is _chrysitis_; the second best is called\r\n_argyritis_; and a third kind is called _molybditis_.... _Molybditis_ is\r\nthe result of the smelting of lead.... Some people make two kinds of\r\nlitharge, which they call _scirerytis_ and _peumene_; and a third\r\nvariety being _molybdaena_, will be mentioned with lead.\" (XXXIV, 53):\r\n\"_Molybdaena_, which in another place I have called _galena_, is an ore\r\nof mixed silver and lead. It is considered better in quality the nearer\r\nit approaches to a golden colour and the less lead there is in it; it is\r\nalso friable and moderately heavy. When it is boiled with oil it becomes\r\nliver-coloured, adheres to the gold and silver furnaces, and in this\r\nstate it is called _metallica_.\" From these two passages it would seem\r\nthat _molybdaena_, a variety of litharge, might quite well be\r\nhearth-lead. Further (in XXXIV, 47), he says: \"The metal which flows\r\nliquid at the first melting in the furnace is called _stannum_, at the\r\nsecond melting is silver, that which remains in the furnace is\r\n_galena_.\" If we still maintain that _molybdaena_ is hearth-lead, and\r\n_galena_ is its equivalent, then this passage becomes clear enough, the\r\nsecond melting being cupellation. The difficulty with Pliny, however,\r\narises from the passage (XXXIII, 31), where, speaking of silver ore, he\r\nsays: \"It is impossible to melt it except with lead ore, called\r\n_galena_, which is generally found next to silver veins.\" Agricola\r\n(_Bermannus_, p. 427, &c.), devotes a great deal of inconclusive\r\ndiscussion to an attempt to reconcile this conflict of Pliny, and also\r\nthat of Dioscorides. The probable explanation of this conflict arises in\r\nthe resemblance of cupellation furnace bottoms to lead carbonates, and\r\nthe native _molybdaena_ of Dioscorides; and some of those referred to by\r\nPliny may be this sort of lead ores. In fact, in one or two places in\r\nBook IX, Agricola appears to use the term in this sense himself. After\r\nAgricola's time the term _molybdaenum_ was applied to substances\r\nresembling lead, such as graphite, and what we now know as _molybdenite_\r\n(_MoS_{2}_). Some time in the latter part of the 18th century, an\r\nelement being separated from the latter, it was dubbed _molybdenum_, and\r\nconfusion was five times confounded.\r\n\r\n[38] Agricola here refers to the German word used in this connection,\r\n_i.e._, _hundt_, a dog.\r\n\r\n[39] If Agricola means the German _centner_, this charge would be from\r\nabout 4.6 to 5.7 short tons. If he is using Roman weights, it would be\r\nfrom about 3 to 3.7 short tons.\r\n\r\n[40] The refining of silver in \"tests\" (Latin _testa_) is merely a\r\nsecond cupellation, with greater care and under stronger blast. Stirring\r\nthe mass with an iron rod serves to raise the impurities which either\r\nvolatilize as litharge or, floating to the edges, are absorbed into the\r\n\"test.\" The capacity of the tests, from 15 _librae_ to 50 _librae_,\r\nwould be from about 155 to 515 ozs. Troy.\r\n\r\n[41] A _drachma_ of impurities in a _bes_, would be one part in 64, or\r\n984.4 fine. A loss of a _sicilicus_ of silver to the _bes_, would be one\r\npart in 32, or about 3.1%; three _drachmae_ would equal 4.7%, and half\r\nan _uncia_ 6.2%, or would indicate that the original bullion had a\r\nfineness in the various cases of about 950, 933, and 912.\r\n\r\n[42] _Praefectus Regis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent methods of parting gold from silver, and, on the other hand,\r\nsilver from gold, were discussed in the last book; also the separation\r\nof copper from the latter, and further, of lead from gold as well as\r\nfrom silver; and, lastly, the methods for refining the two precious\r\nmetals. Now I will speak of the methods by which silver must be\r\nseparated from copper, and likewise from iron.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 493 (Building Plan for Refinery): Six long walls: A--The\r\nfirst. B--The first part of the second. C--The further part of the\r\nsecond. D--The third. E--The fourth. F--The fifth. G--The sixth.\r\nFourteen transverse walls: H--The first. I--The second. K--The third.\r\nL--The fourth. M--The fifth. N--The sixth. O--The seventh. P--The\r\neighth. Q--The ninth. R--The tenth. S--The eleventh. T--The twelfth.\r\nV--The thirteenth. X--The fourteenth.]\r\n\r\nThe _officina_, or the building necessary for the purposes and use of\r\nthose who separate silver from copper, is constructed in this manner.\r\nFirst, four long walls are built, of which the first, which is parallel\r\nwith the bank of a stream, and the second, are both two hundred and\r\nsixty-four feet long. The second, however, stops at one hundred and\r\nfifty-one feet, and after, as it were, a break for a length of\r\ntwenty-four feet, it continues again until it is of a length equal to\r\nthe first wall. The third wall is one hundred and twenty feet long,\r\nstarting at a point opposite the sixty-seventh foot of the other walls,\r\nand reaching to their one hundred and eighty-sixth foot. The fourth\r\nwall is one hundred and fifty-one feet long. The height of each of these\r\nwalls, and likewise of the other two and of the transverse walls, of\r\nwhich I will speak later on, is ten feet, and the thickness two feet and\r\nas many palms. The second long wall only is built fifteen feet high,\r\nbecause of the furnaces which must be built against it. The first long\r\nwall is distant fifteen feet from the second, and the third is distant\r\nthe same number of feet from the fourth, but the second is distant\r\nthirty-nine feet from the third. Then transverse walls are built, the\r\nfirst of which leads from the beginning of the first long wall to the\r\nbeginning of the second long wall; and the second transverse wall from\r\nthe beginning of the second long wall to the beginning of the fourth\r\nlong wall, for the third long wall does not reach so far. Then from the\r\nbeginning of the third long wall are built two walls--the one to the\r\nsixty-seventh foot of the second long wall, the other to the same point\r\nin the fourth long wall. The fifth transverse wall is built at a\r\ndistance of ten feet from the fourth transverse wall toward the second\r\ntransverse wall; it is twenty feet long, and starts from the fourth\r\nlong wall. The sixth transverse wall is built also from the fourth long\r\nwall, at a point distant thirty feet from the fourth transverse wall,\r\nand it extends as far as the back of the third long wall. The seventh\r\ntransverse wall is constructed from the second long wall, where this\r\nfirst leaves off, to the third long wall; and from the back of the third\r\nlong wall the eighth transverse wall is built, extending to the end of\r\nthe fourth long wall. Then the fifth long wall is built from the seventh\r\ntransverse wall, starting at a point nineteen feet from the second long\r\nwall; it is one hundred and nine feet in length; and at a point\r\ntwenty-four feet along it, the ninth transverse wall is carried to the\r\nthird end of the second long wall, where that begins again. The tenth\r\ntransverse wall is built from the end of the fifth long wall, and leads\r\nto the further end of the second long wall; and from there the eleventh\r\ntransverse wall leads to the further end of the first long wall. Behind\r\nthe fifth long wall, and five feet toward the third long wall, the sixth\r\nlong wall is built, leading from the seventh transverse wall; its length\r\nis thirty-five feet, and from its further end the twelfth transverse\r\nwall is built to the third long wall, and from it the thirteenth\r\ntransverse wall is built to the fifth long wall. The fourteenth\r\ntransverse wall divides into equal parts the space which lies between\r\nthe seventh transverse wall and the twelfth.\r\n\r\nThe length, height, breadth, and position of the walls are as above.\r\nTheir archways, doors, and openings are made at the same time that the\r\nwalls are built. The size of these and the way they are made will be\r\nmuch better understood hereafter. I will now speak of the furnace hoods\r\nand of the roofs. The first side[2] of the hood stands on the second\r\nlong wall, and is similar in every respect to those whose structure I\r\nexplained in Book IX, when I described the works in whose furnaces are\r\nsmelted the ores of gold, silver, and copper. From this side of the hood\r\na roof, which consists of burnt tiles, extends to the first long wall;\r\nand this part of the building contains the bellows, the machinery for\r\ncompressing them, and the instruments for inflating them. In the middle\r\nspace, which is situated between the second and third transverse walls,\r\nan upright post eight feet high and two feet thick and wide, is erected\r\non a rock foundation, and is distant thirteen feet from the second long\r\nwall. On that upright post, and in the second transverse wall, which has\r\nat that point a square hole two feet high and wide, is placed a beam\r\nthirty-four feet and a palm long. Another beam, of the same length,\r\nwidth, and thickness, is fixed on the same upright post and in the third\r\ntransverse wall. The heads of those two beams, where they meet, are\r\njoined together with iron staples. In a similar manner another post is\r\nerected, at a distance of ten feet from the first upright post in the\r\ndirection of the fourth wall, and two beams are laid upon it and into\r\nthe same walls in a similar way to those I have just now described. On\r\nthese two beams and on the fourth long wall are fixed seventeen\r\ncross-beams, forty-three feet and three palms long, a foot wide, and\r\nthree palms thick; the first of these is laid upon the second transverse\r\nwall, the last lies along the third and fourth transverse walls; the\r\nrest are set in the space between them. These cross-beams are three feet\r\napart one from the other.\r\n\r\nIn the ends of these cross-beams, facing the second long wall, are\r\nmortised the ends of the same number of rafters reaching to those\r\ntimbers which stand upright on the second long wall, and in this manner\r\nis made the inclined side of the hood in a similar way to the one\r\ndescribed in Book IX. To prevent this from falling toward the vertical\r\nwall of the hood, there are iron rods securing it, but only a few,\r\nbecause the four brick chimneys which have to be built in that space\r\npartly support it. Twelve feet back are likewise mortised into the\r\ncross-beams, which lie upon the two longitudinal beams and the fourth\r\nlong wall, the lower ends of as many rafters, whose upper ends are\r\nmortised into the upper ends of an equal number of similar rafters,\r\nwhose lower ends are mortised to the ends of the beams at the fourth\r\nlong wall. From the first set of rafters[4] to the second set of rafters\r\nis a distance of twelve feet, in order that a gutter may be well placed\r\nin the middle space. Between these two are again erected two sets of\r\nrafters, the lower ends of which are likewise mortised into the beams,\r\nwhich lie on the two longitudinal beams and the fourth long wall, and\r\nare interdistant a cubit. The upper ends of the ones fifteen feet long\r\nrest on the backs of the rafters of the first set; the ends of the\r\nothers, which are eighteen feet long, rest on the backs of the rafters\r\nof the second set, which are longer; in this manner, in the middle of\r\nthe rafters, is a sub-structure. Upon each alternate cross-beam which is\r\nplaced upon the two longitudinal beams and the fourth long wall is\r\nerected an upright post, and that it may be sufficiently firm it is\r\nstrengthened by means of a slanting timber. Upon these posts is laid a\r\nlong beam, upon which rests one set of middle rafters. In a similar\r\nmanner the other set of middle rafters rests on a long beam which is\r\nplaced upon other posts. Besides this, two feet above every cross-beam,\r\nwhich is placed on the two longitudinal beams and the fourth long wall,\r\nis placed a tie-beam which reaches from the first set of middle rafters\r\nto the second set of middle rafters; upon the tie-beams is placed a\r\ngutter hollowed out from a tree. Then from the back of each of the first\r\nset of middle rafters a beam six feet long reaches almost to the gutter;\r\nto the lower end of this beam is attached a piece of wood two feet long;\r\nthis is repeated with each rafter of the first set of middle rafters.\r\nSimilarly from the back of each rafter of the second set of middle\r\nrafters a little beam, seven feet long, reaches almost to the gutter; to\r\nthe lower end of it is likewise attached a short piece of wood; this is\r\nrepeated on each rafter of the second set of middle rafters. Then in the\r\nupper part, to the first and second sets of principal rafters are\r\nfastened long boards, upon which are fixed the burnt tiles; and in the\r\nsame manner, in the middle part, they are fastened to the first and\r\nsecond sets of middle rafters, and at the lower part to the little beams\r\nwhich reach from each rafter of the first and second set of middle\r\nrafters almost to the gutter; and, finally, to the little boards\r\nfastened to the short pieces of wood are fixed shingles of pine-wood\r\nextending into the gutter, so that the violent rain or melted snow may\r\nnot penetrate into the building. The substructures in the interior which\r\nsupport the second set of rafters, and those on the opposite side which\r\nsupport the third, being not unusual, I need not explain.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the building against the second long wall are the\r\nfurnaces, in which exhausted liquation cakes which have already been\r\n\"dried\" are smelted, that they may recover once again the appearance and\r\ncolour of copper, inasmuch as they really are copper. The remainder of\r\nthe room is occupied by the passage which leads from the door to the\r\nfurnaces, together with two other furnaces, in one of which the whole\r\ncakes of copper are heated, and in the other the exhausted liquation\r\ncakes are \"dried\" by the heat of the fire.\r\n\r\nLikewise, in the room between the third and seventh[5] transverse walls,\r\ntwo posts are erected on rock foundation; both of them are eight feet\r\nhigh and two feet wide and thick. The one is at a distance of thirteen\r\nfeet from the second long wall; the other at the same distance from the\r\nthird long wall; there is a distance of thirteen feet between them. Upon\r\nthese two posts and upon the third transverse wall are laid two\r\nlongitudinal beams, forty-one feet and one palm long, and two feet wide\r\nand thick. Two other beams of the same length, width, and thickness are\r\nlaid upon the upright posts and upon the seventh transverse wall, and\r\nthe heads of the two long beams, where they meet, are joined with iron\r\nstaples. On these longitudinal beams are again placed twenty-one\r\ntransverse beams, thirteen feet long, a foot wide, and three palms\r\nthick, of which the first is set on the third transverse wall, and the\r\nlast on the seventh transverse wall; the rest are laid in the space\r\nbetween these two, and they are distant from one another three feet.\r\nInto the ends of the transverse beams which face the second long wall,\r\nare mortised the ends of the same number of rafters erected toward the\r\nupright posts which are placed upon the second long wall, and in this\r\nmanner is made the second inclined side wall of the hood. Into the ends\r\nof the transverse beams facing the third long wall, are mortised the\r\nends of the same number of rafters rising toward the rafters of the\r\nfirst inclined side of the second hood, and in this manner is made the\r\nother inclined side of the second hood. But to prevent this from falling\r\nin upon the opposite inclined side of the hood, and that again upon the\r\nopposite vertical one, there are many iron rods reaching from some of\r\nthe rafters to those opposite them; and this is also prevented in part\r\nby means of a few tie-beams, extending from the back of the rafters to\r\nthe back of those which are behind them. These tie-beams are two palms\r\nthick and wide, and have holes made through them at each end; each of\r\nthe rafters is bound round with iron bands three digits wide and half a\r\ndigit thick, which hold together the ends of the tie-beams of which I\r\nhave spoken; and so that the joints may be firm, an iron nail, passing\r\nthrough the plate on both sides, is driven through the holes in the ends\r\nof the beams. Since one weight counter-balances another, the rafters on\r\nthe opposite hoods cannot fall. The tie-beams and middle posts which\r\nhave to support the gutters and the roof, are made in every particular\r\nas I stated above, except only that the second set of middle rafters are\r\nnot longer than the first set of middle rafters, and that the little\r\nbeams which reach from the back of each rafter of the second set of\r\nmiddle rafters nearly to the gutter are not longer than the little beams\r\nwhich reach from the back of each rafter of the first set of middle\r\nrafters almost to the gutter. In this part of the building, against the\r\nsecond long wall, are the furnaces in which copper is alloyed with lead,\r\nand in which \"slags\" are re-smelted. Against the third long wall are the\r\nfurnaces in which silver and lead are liquated from copper. The interior\r\nis also occupied by two cranes, of which one deposits on the ground the\r\ncakes of copper lifted out of the moulding pans; the other lifts them\r\nfrom the ground into the second furnace.\r\n\r\nOn the third and the fourth long walls are set twenty-one beams eighteen\r\nfeet and three palms long. In mortises in them, two feet behind the\r\nthird long wall, are set the ends of the same number of rafters erected\r\nopposite to the rafters of the other inclined wall of the second furnace\r\nhood, and in this manner is made the third inclined wall, exactly\r\nsimilar to the others. The ends of as many rafters are mortised into\r\nthese beams where they are fixed in the fourth long wall; these rafters\r\nare erected obliquely, and rest against the backs of the preceding ones\r\nand support the roof, which consists entirely of burnt tiles and has the\r\nusual substructures. In this part of the building there are two rooms,\r\nin the first of which the cakes of copper, and in the other the cakes of\r\nlead, are stored.\r\n\r\nIn the space enclosed between the ninth and tenth transverse walls and\r\nthe second and fifth long walls, a post twelve feet high and two feet\r\nwide and thick is erected on a rock foundation; it is distant thirteen\r\nfeet from the second long wall, and six from the fifth long wall. Upon\r\nthis post and upon the ninth transverse wall is laid a beam thirty-three\r\nfeet and three palms long, and two palms wide and thick. Another beam,\r\nalso of the same length, width and thickness, is laid upon the same post\r\nand upon the tenth transverse wall, and the ends of these two beams\r\nwhere they meet are joined by means of iron staples. On these beams and\r\non the fifth long wall are placed ten cross-beams, eight feet and three\r\npalms long, the first of which is placed on the ninth transverse wall,\r\nthe last on the tenth, the remainder in the space between them; they are\r\ndistant from one another three feet. Into the ends of the cross-beams\r\nfacing the second long wall, are mortised the ends of the same number of\r\nrafters inclined toward the posts which stand vertically upon the second\r\nlong wall. This, again, is the manner in which the inclined side of the\r\nfurnace hood is made, just as with the others; at the top where the\r\nfumes are emitted it is two feet distant from the vertical side. The\r\nends of the same number of rafters are mortised into the cross-beams,\r\nwhere they are set in the fifth long wall; each of them is set up\r\nobliquely and rests against the back of one of the preceding set; they\r\nsupport the roof, made of burnt tiles. In this part of the building,\r\nagainst the second long wall, are four furnaces in which lead is\r\nseparated from silver, together with the cranes by means of which the\r\ndomes are lifted from the crucibles.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the building which lies between the first long wall and\r\nthe break in the second long wall, is the stamp with which the copper\r\ncakes are crushed, and the four stamps with which the accretions that\r\nare chipped off the walls of the furnace are broken up and crushed to\r\npowder, and likewise the bricks on which the exhausted liquation cakes\r\nof copper are stood to be \"dried.\" This room has the usual roof, as also\r\nhas the space between the seventh transverse wall and the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth transverse walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 499 (Hearths for melting lead cakes): A--Hearth.

This part of the building is divided into two parts, in the first\r\nof which stand the little furnaces in which the artificer assays metals;\r\nand the bone ash, together with the other powders, are kept here. In the\r\nother room is prepared the powder from which the hearths and the\r\ncrucibles of the furnaces are made. Outside the building, at the back of\r\nthe fourth long wall, near the door to the left as you enter, is a\r\nhearth in which smaller masses of lead are melted from large ones, that\r\nthey may be the more easily weighed; because the masses of lead, just as\r\nmuch as the cakes of copper, ought to be first prepared so that they can\r\nbe weighed, and a definite weight can be melted and alloyed in the\r\nfurnaces. To begin with, the hearth in which the masses of lead are\r\nliquefied is six feet long and five wide; it is protected on both sides\r\nby rocks partly sunk into the earth, but a palm higher than the hearth,\r\nand it is lined in the inside with lute. It slopes toward the middle and\r\ntoward the front, in order that the molten lead may run down and flow\r\nout into the dipping-pot. There is a wall at the back of the hearth\r\nwhich protects the fourth long wall from damage by the heat; this wall,\r\nwhich is made of bricks and lute, is four feet high, three palms thick,\r\nand five feet long at the bottom, and at the top three feet and two\r\npalms long; therefore it narrows gradually, and in the upper part are\r\nlaid seven bricks, the middle ones of which are set upright, and the end\r\nones inclined; they are all thickly coated with lute. In front of the\r\nhearth is a dipping-pot, whose pit is a foot deep, and a foot and three\r\npalms wide at the top, and gradually narrows. When the masses of lead\r\nare to be melted, the workman first places the wood in the hearth so\r\nthat one end of each billet faces the wall, and the other end the\r\ndipping-pot. Then, assisted by other workmen, he pushes the mass of lead\r\nforward with crowbars on to a low trolley, and draws it to the crane.\r\nThe trolley consists of planks fastened together, is two and one-half\r\nfeet wide and five feet long, and has two small iron axles, around which\r\nat each end revolve small iron wheels, two palms in diameter and as many\r\ndigits wide. The trolley has a tongue, and attached to this is a rope,\r\nby which it is drawn to the crane. The crane is exactly similar to those\r\nin the second part of the works, except that the crane-arm is not so\r\nlong. The tongs in whose jaws[6] the masses of lead are seized, are two\r\nfeet a palm and two digits long; both of the jaws, when struck with a\r\nhammer, impinge upon the mass and are driven into it. The upper part of\r\nboth handles of the tongs are curved back, the one to the right, the\r\nother to the left, and each handle is engaged in one of the lowest links\r\nof two short chains, which are three links long. The upper links are\r\nengaged in a large round ring, in which is fixed the hook of a chain let\r\ndown from the pulley of the crane-arm. When the crank of the crane is\r\nturned, the mass is lifted and is carried by the crane-arm to the hearth\r\nand placed on the wood. The workmen wheel up one mass after another and\r\nplace them in a similar manner on the wood of the hearth; masses which\r\nweigh a total of about a hundred and sixty _centumpondia_[7] are usually\r\nplaced upon the wood and melted at one time. Then a workman throws\r\ncharcoal on the masses, and all are made ready in the evening. If he\r\nfears that it may rain, he covers it up with a cover, which may be moved\r\nhere and there; at the back this cover has two legs, so that the rain\r\nwhich it collects may flow down the slope on to the open ground. Early\r\nin the morning of the following day, he throws live coals on the\r\ncharcoal with a shovel, and by this method the masses of lead melt, and\r\nfrom time to time charcoal is added. The lead, as soon as it begins to\r\nrun into the dipping-pot, is ladled out with an iron ladle into copper\r\nmoulds such as the refiners generally use. If it does not cool\r\nimmediately he pours water over it, and then sticks the pointed pick\r\ninto it and pulls it out. The pointed end of the pick is three palms\r\nlong and the round end is two digits long. It is necessary to smear the\r\nmoulds with a wash of lute, in order that, when they have been turned\r\nupside down and struck with the broad round end of the pick, the cakes\r\nof lead may fall out easily. If the moulds are not washed over with the\r\nlute, there is a risk that they may be melted by the lead and let it\r\nthrough. Others take hold of a billet of wood with their left hand, and\r\nwith the heavy lower end of it they pound the mould, and with the right\r\nhand they stick the point of the pick into the cake of lead, and thus\r\npull it out. Then immediately the workman pours other lead into the\r\nempty moulds, and this he does until the work of melting the lead is\r\nfinished. When the lead is melted, something similar to litharge is\r\nproduced; but it is no wonder that it should be possible to make it in\r\nthis case, when it used formerly to be produced at Puteoli from lead\r\nalone when melted by a fierce fire in the cupellation furnace.[8]\r\nAfterward these cakes of lead are carried into the lead store-room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 501 (Stamp-mill for breaking copper cakes): A--Block of\r\nwood.

M--Little iron axle.\r\nN--Bronze pipe.]\r\n\r\nThe cakes of copper, put into wheelbarrows, are carried into the third\r\npart of the building, where each is laid upon a saddle, and is broken up\r\nby the impact of successive blows from the iron-shod stamp. This machine\r\nis made by placing upon the ground a block of oak, five feet long and\r\nthree feet wide and thick; it is cut out in the middle for a length of\r\ntwo feet and two palms, a width of two feet, and a depth of three palms\r\nand two digits, and is open in front; the higher part of it is at the\r\nback, and the wide part lies flat in the block. In the middle of it is\r\nplaced a bronze saddle. Its base is a palm and two digits wide, and is\r\nplanted between two masses of lead, and extends under them to a depth of\r\na palm on both sides. The whole saddle is three palms and two digits\r\nwide, a foot long, and two palms thick. Upon each end of the block\r\nstands a post, a cubit wide and thick, the upper end of which is\r\nsomewhat cut away and is mortised into the beams of the building. At a\r\nheight of four feet and two digits above the block there are joined to\r\nthe posts two transverse beams, each of which is three palms wide and\r\nthick; their ends are mortised into the upright posts, and holes are\r\nbored through them; in the holes are driven iron claves, horned in front\r\nand so driven into the post that one of the horns of each points upward\r\nand the other downward; the other end of each clavis is perforated, and\r\na wide iron wedge is inserted and driven into the holes, and thus holds\r\nthe transverse beams in place. These transverse beams have in the middle\r\na square opening three palms and half a digit wide in each direction,\r\nthrough which the iron-shod stamp passes. At a height of three feet and\r\ntwo palms above these transverse beams there are again two beams of the\r\nsame kind, having also a square opening and holding the same stamp. This\r\nstamp is square, eleven feet long, three palms wide and thick; its iron\r\nshoe is a foot and a palm long; its head is two palms long and wide, a\r\npalm two digits thick at the top, and at the bottom the same number of\r\ndigits, for it gradually narrows. But the tail is three palms long;\r\nwhere the head begins is two palms wide and thick, and the further it\r\ndeparts from the same the narrower it becomes. The upper part is\r\nenclosed in the stamp-stem, and it is perforated so that an iron bolt\r\nmay be driven into it; it is bound by three rectangular iron bands, the\r\nlowest of which, a palm wide, is between the iron shoe and the head of\r\nthe stamp; the middle band, three digits wide, follows next and binds\r\nround the head of the stamp, and two digits above is the upper one,\r\nwhich is the same number of digits wide. At a distance of two feet and\r\nas many digits above the lowest part of the iron shoe, is a rectangular\r\ntooth, projecting from the stamp for a distance of a foot and a palm; it\r\nis two palms thick, and when it has extended to a distance of six digits\r\nfrom the stamp it is made two digits narrower. At a height of three\r\npalms upward from the tooth there is a round hole in the middle of the\r\nstamp-stem, into which can be thrust a round iron bar two feet long and\r\na digit and a half in diameter; in its hollow end is fixed a wooden\r\nhandle two palms and the same number of digits long. The bar rests on\r\nthe lower transverse beam, and holds up the stamp when it is not in use.\r\nThe axle which raises the stamp has on each side two arms, which are two\r\npalms and three digits distant from each other, and which project from\r\nthe axle a foot, a palm and two digits; penetrating through them are\r\nbolts, driven in firmly; the arms are each a palm and two digits wide\r\nand thick, and their round heads, for a foot downward on either side,\r\nare covered with iron plates of the same width as the arms and fastened\r\nby iron nails. The head of each arm has a round hole, into which is\r\ninserted an iron pin, passing through a bronze pipe; this little axle\r\nhas at the one end a wide head, and at the other end a perforation\r\nthrough which is driven an iron nail, lest this little axle should fall\r\nout of the arms. The bronze pipe is two palms long and one in diameter;\r\nthe little iron axle penetrates through its round interior, which is two\r\ndigits in diameter. The bronze pipe not only revolves round the little\r\niron axle, but it also rotates with it; therefore, when the axle\r\nrevolves, the little axle and the bronze tube in their turn raise the\r\ntooth and the stamp. When the little iron axle and the bronze pipe have\r\nbeen taken out of the arms, the tooth of the stamps is not raised, and\r\nother stamps may be raised without this one. Further on, a drum with\r\nspindles fixed around the axle of a water-wheel moves the axle of a\r\ntoothed drum, which depresses the sweeps of the bellows in the adjacent\r\nfourth part of the building; but it turns in the contrary direction; for\r\nthe axis of the drum which raises the stamps turns toward the north,\r\nwhile that one which depresses the sweeps of the bellows turns toward\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 504 (Hearths for heating copper cakes): A--Back wall.\r\nB--Walls at the sides. C--Upright posts. D--Chimney. E--The cakes\r\narranged. F--Iron plates. G--Rocks. H--Rabble with two prongs.\r\nI--Hammers.]\r\n\r\nThose cakes which are too thick to be rapidly broken by blows from the\r\niron-shod stamp, such as are generally those which have settled in the\r\nbottom of the crucible,[9] are carried into the first part of the\r\nbuilding. They are there heated in a furnace, which is twenty-eight feet\r\ndistant from the second long wall and twelve feet from the second\r\ntransverse wall. The three sides of this furnace are built of\r\nrectangular rocks, upon which bricks are laid; the back furnace wall is\r\nthree feet and a palm high, and the rear of the side walls is the same;\r\nthe side walls are sloping, and where the furnace is open in front they\r\nare only two feet and three palms high; all the walls are a foot and a\r\npalm thick. Upon these walls stand upright posts not less thick, in\r\norder that they may bear the heavy weight placed upon them, and they are\r\ncovered with lute; these posts support the sloping chimney and penetrate\r\nthrough the roof. Moreover, not only the ribs of the chimney, but also\r\nthe rafters, are covered thickly with lute. The hearth of the furnace is\r\nsix feet long on each side, is sloping, and is paved with bricks. The\r\ncakes of copper are placed in the furnace and heated in the following\r\nway. They are first of all placed in the furnace in rows, with as many\r\nsmall stones the size of an egg between, so that the heat of the fire\r\ncan penetrate through the spaces between them; indeed, those cakes which\r\nare placed at the bottom of the crucible are each raised upon half a\r\nbrick for the same reason. But lest the last row, which lies against the\r\nmouth of the furnace, should fall out, against the mouth are placed iron\r\nplates, or the copper cakes which are the first taken from the crucible\r\nwhen copper is made, and against them are laid exhausted liquation cakes\r\nor rocks. Then charcoal is thrown on the cakes, and then live coals; at\r\nfirst the cakes are heated by a gentle fire, and afterward more charcoal\r\nis added to them until it is at times three-quarters of a foot deep. A\r\nfiercer fire is certainly required to heat the hard cakes of copper than\r\nthe fragile ones. When the cakes have been sufficiently heated, which\r\nusually occurs within the space of about two hours, the exhausted\r\nliquation cakes or the rocks and the iron plate are removed from the\r\nmouth of the furnace. Then the hot cakes are taken out row after row\r\nwith a two-pronged rabble, such as the one which is used by those who\r\n\"dry\" the exhausted liquation cakes. Then the first cake is laid upon\r\nthe exhausted liquation cakes, and beaten by two workmen with hammers\r\nuntil it breaks; the hotter the cakes are, the sooner they are broken\r\nup; the less hot, the longer it takes, for now and then they bend into\r\nthe shape of copper basins. When the first cake has been broken, the\r\nsecond is put on to the other fragments and beaten until it breaks into\r\npieces, and the rest of the cakes are broken up in the same manner in\r\ndue order. The head of the hammer is three palms long and one wide, and\r\nsharpened at both ends, and its handle is of wood three feet long. When\r\nthey have been broken by the stamp, if cold, or with hammers if hot, the\r\nfragments of copper or the cakes are carried into the store-room for\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\nThe foreman of the works, according to the different proportions of\r\nsilver in each _centumpondium_ of copper, alloys it with lead, without\r\nwhich he could not separate the silver from the copper.[10] If there be\r\na moderate amount of silver in the copper, he alloys it fourfold; for\r\ninstance, if in three-quarters of a _centumpondium_ of copper there is\r\nless than the following proportions, _i.e._: half a _libra_ of silver,\r\nor half a _libra_ and a _sicilicus_, or half a _libra_ and a\r\n_semi-uncia_, or half a _libra_ and _semi-uncia_ and a _sicilicus_, then\r\nrich lead--that is, that from which the silver has not yet been\r\nseparated--is added, to the amount of half a _centumpondium_ or a whole\r\n_centumpondium_, or a whole and a half, in such a way that there may be\r\nin the copper-lead alloy some one of the proportions of silver which I\r\nhave just mentioned, which is the first alloy. To this \"first\" alloy is\r\nadded such a weight of de-silverized lead or litharge as is required to\r\nmake out of all of these a single liquation cake that will contain\r\napproximately two _centumpondia_ of lead; but as usually from one\r\nhundred and thirty _librae_ of litharge only one hundred _librae_ of\r\nlead are made, a greater proportion of litharge than of de-silverized\r\nlead is added as a supplement. Since four cakes of this kind are placed\r\nat the same time into the furnace in which the silver and lead is\r\nliquated from copper, there will be in all the cakes three\r\n_centumpondia_ of copper and eight _centumpondia_ of lead. When the lead\r\nhas been liquated from the copper, it weighs six _centumpondia_, in each\r\n_centumpondium_ of which there is a quarter of a _libra_ and almost a\r\n_sicilicus_ of silver. Only seven _unciae_ of the silver remain in the\r\nexhausted liquation cakes and in that copper-lead alloy which we call\r\n\"liquation thorns\"; they are not called by this name so much because\r\nthey have sharp points as because they are base. If in three-quarters of\r\na _centumpondium_ of copper there are less than seven _uncia_ and a\r\n_semi-uncia_ or a _bes_ of silver, then so much rich lead must be added\r\nas to make in the copper and lead alloy one of the proportions of silver\r\nwhich I have already mentioned. This is the \"second\" alloy. To this is\r\nagain to be added as great a weight of de-silverized lead, or of\r\nlitharge, as will make it possible to obtain from that alloy a liquation\r\ncake containing two and a quarter _centumpondia_ of lead, in which\r\nmanner in four of these cakes there will be three _centumpondia_ of\r\ncopper and nine _centumpondia_ of lead. The lead which liquates from\r\nthese cakes weighs seven _centumpondia_, in each _centumpondium_ of\r\nwhich there is a quarter of a _libra_ of silver and a little more than a\r\n_sicilicus_. About seven _unciae_ of silver remain in the exhausted\r\nliquation cakes and in the liquation thorns, if we may be allowed to\r\nmake common the old name (_spinae_ = thorns) and bestow it upon a new\r\nsubstance. If in three-quarters of a _centumpondium_ of copper there is\r\nless than three-quarters of a _libra_ of silver, or three-quarters and a\r\n_semi-uncia_, then as much rich lead must be added as will produce one\r\nof the proportions of silver in the copper-lead alloy above mentioned;\r\nthis is the \"third\" alloy. To this is added such an amount of\r\nde-silverized lead or of litharge, that a liquation cake made from it\r\ncontains in all two and three-quarters _centumpondia_ of lead. In this\r\nmanner four such cakes will contain three _centumpondia_ of copper and\r\neleven _centumpondia_ of lead. The lead which these cakes liquate, when\r\nthey are melted in the furnace, weighs about nine _centumpondia_, in\r\neach _centumpondium_ of which there is a quarter of a _libra_ and more\r\nthan a _sicilicus_ of silver; and seven _unciae_ of silver remain in the\r\nexhausted liquation cakes and in the liquation thorns. If, however, in\r\nthree-quarters of a _centumpondium_ of copper there is less than\r\nten-twelfths of a _libra_ or ten-twelfths of a _libra_ and a\r\n_semi-uncia_ of silver, then such a proportion of rich lead is added as\r\nwill produce in the copper-lead alloy one of the proportions of silver\r\nwhich I mentioned above; this is the \"fourth\" alloy. To this is added\r\nsuch a weight of de-silverized lead or of litharge, that a liquation\r\ncake made from it contains three _centumpondia_ of lead, and in four\r\ncakes of this kind there are three _centumpondia_ of copper and twelve\r\n_centumpondia_ of lead. The lead which is liquated therefrom weighs\r\nabout ten _centumpondia_, in each _centumpondium_ of which there is a\r\nquarter of a _libra_ and more than a _semi-uncia_ of silver, or seven\r\n_unciae_; a _bes_, or seven _unciae_ and a _semi-uncia_, of silver\r\nremain in the exhausted liquation cakes and in the liquation thorns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 508 (Blast Furnaces): A--Furnace in which \"slags\" are\r\nre-smelted.

K--The hook of its chain.]\r\n\r\nAgainst the second long wall in the second part of the building, whose\r\narea is eighty feet long by thirty-nine feet wide, are four furnaces in\r\nwhich the copper is alloyed with lead, and six furnaces in which \"slags\"\r\nare re-smelted. The interior of the first kind of furnace is a foot and\r\nthree palms wide, two feet three digits long; and of the second is a\r\nfoot and a palm wide and a foot three palms and a digit long. The side\r\nwalls of these furnaces are the same height as the furnaces in which\r\ngold or silver ores are smelted. As the whole room is divided into two\r\nparts by upright posts, the front part must have, first, two furnaces in\r\nwhich \"slags\" are re-melted; second, two furnaces in which copper is\r\nalloyed with lead; and third, one furnace in which \"slags\" are\r\nre-melted. The back part of the room has first, one furnace in which\r\n\"slags\" are re-melted; next, two furnaces in which copper is alloyed\r\nwith lead; and third, two furnaces in which \"slags\" are re-melted. Each\r\nof these is six feet distant from the next; on the right side of the\r\nfirst is a space of three feet and two palms, and on the left side of\r\nthe last one of seven feet. Each pair of furnaces has a common door, six\r\nfeet high and a cubit wide, but the first and the tenth furnace each has\r\none of its own. Each of the furnaces is set in an arch of its own in the\r\nback wall, and in front has a forehearth pit; this is filled with a\r\npowder compound rammed down and compressed in order to make a crucible.\r\nUnder each furnace is a hidden receptacle for the moisture,[11] from\r\nwhich a vent is made through the back wall toward the right, which\r\nallows the vapour to escape. Finally, to the right, in front, is the\r\ncopper mould into which the copper-lead alloy is poured from the\r\nforehearth, in order that liquation cakes of equal weight may be made.\r\nThis copper mould is a digit thick, its interior is two feet in diameter\r\nand six digits deep. Behind the second long wall are ten pairs of\r\nbellows, two machines for compressing them, and twenty instruments for\r\ninflating them. The way in which these should be made may be understood\r\nfrom Book IX.\r\n\r\nThe smelter, when he alloys copper with lead, with his hand throws into\r\nthe heated furnace, first the large fragments of copper, then a\r\nbasketful of charcoal, then the smaller fragments of copper. When the\r\ncopper is melted and begins to run out of the tap-hole into the\r\nforehearth, he throws litharge into the furnace, and, lest part of it\r\nshould fly away, he first throws charcoal over it, and lastly lead. As\r\nsoon as he has thrown into the furnace the copper and the lead, from\r\nwhich alloy the first liquation cake is made, he again throws in a\r\nbasket of charcoal, and then fragments of copper are thrown over them,\r\nfrom which the second cake may be made. Afterward with a rabble he skims\r\nthe \"slag\" from the copper and lead as they flow into the forehearth.\r\nSuch a rabble is a board into which an iron bar is fixed; the board is\r\nmade of elder-wood or willow, and is ten digits long, six wide, and one\r\nand a half digits thick; the iron bar is three feet long, and the wooden\r\nhandle inserted into it is two and a half feet long. While he purges the\r\nalloy and pours it out with a ladle into the copper mould, the fragments\r\nof copper from which he is to make the second cake are melting. As soon\r\nas this begins to run down he again throws in litharge, and when he has\r\nput on more charcoal he adds the lead. This operation he repeats until\r\nthirty liquation cakes have been made, on which work he expends nine\r\nhours, or at most ten; if more than thirty cakes must be made, then he\r\nis paid for another shift when he has made an extra thirty.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that he pours the copper-lead alloy into the copper\r\nmould, he also pours water slowly into the top of the mould. Then, with\r\na cleft stick, he takes a hook and puts its straight stem into the\r\nmolten cake. The hook itself is a digit and a half thick; its straight\r\nstem is two palms long and two digits wide and thick. Afterward he pours\r\nmore water over the cakes. When they are cold he places an iron ring in\r\nthe hook of the chain let down from the pulley of the crane arm; the\r\ninside diameter of this ring is six digits, and it is about a digit and\r\na half thick; the ring is then engaged in the hook whose straight stem\r\nis in the cake, and thus the cake is raised from the mould and put into\r\nits place.\r\n\r\nThe copper and lead, when thus melted, yield a small amount of\r\n\"slag\"[12] and much litharge. The litharge does not cohere, but falls to\r\npieces like the residues from malt from which beer is made. _Pompholyx_\r\nadheres to the walls in white ashes, and to the sides of the furnace\r\nadheres _spodos_.\r\n\r\nIn this practical manner lead is alloyed with copper in which there is\r\nbut a moderate portion of silver. If, however, there is much silver in\r\nit, as, for instance, two _librae_, or two _librae_ and a _bes_, to the\r\n_centumpondium_,--which weighs one hundred and thirty-three and a third\r\n_librae_, or one hundred and forty-six _librae_ and a _bes_,[13]--then\r\nthe foreman of the works adds to a _centumpondium_ of such copper three\r\n_centumpondia_ of lead, in each _centumpondium_ of which there is a\r\nthird of a _libra_ of silver, or a third of a _libra_ and a\r\n_semi-uncia_. In this manner three liquation cakes are made, which\r\ncontain altogether three _centumpondia_ of copper and nine\r\n_centumpondia_ of lead.[14] The lead, when it has been liquated from the\r\ncopper, weighs seven _centumpondia_; and in each _centumpondium_--if the\r\n_centumpondium_ of copper contain two _librae_ of silver, and the lead\r\ncontain a third of a _libra_--there will be a _libra_ and a sixth and\r\nmore than a _semi-uncia_ of silver; while in the exhausted liquation\r\ncakes, and in the liquation thorns, there remains a third of a _libra_.\r\nIf a _centumpondium_ of copper contains two _librae_ and a _bes_ of\r\nsilver, and the lead a third of a _libra_ and a _semi-uncia_, there will\r\nbe in each liquation cake one and a half _librae_ and a _semi-uncia_,\r\nand a little more than a _sicilicus_ of silver. In the exhausted\r\nliquation cakes there remain a third of a _libra_ and a _semi-uncia_ of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 510 (Furnaces enriching copper bottoms): A--Furnace.\r\nB--Forehearth. C--Dipping-Pot. D--Cakes.]\r\n\r\nIf there be in the copper only a minute proportion of silver, it cannot\r\nbe separated easily until it has been re-melted in other furnaces, so\r\nthat in the \"bottoms\" there remains more silver and in the \"tops\"\r\nless.[15] This furnace, vaulted with unbaked bricks, is similar to an\r\noven, and also to the cupellation furnace, in which the lead is\r\nseparated from silver, which I described in the last book. The crucible\r\nis made of ashes, in the same manner as in the latter, and in the front\r\nof the furnace, three feet above the floor of the building, is the mouth\r\nout of which the re-melted copper flows into a forehearth and a\r\ndipping-pot. On the left side of the mouth is an aperture, through which\r\nbeech-wood may be put into the furnace to feed the fire. If in a\r\n_centumpondium_ of copper there were a sixth of a _libra_ and a\r\n_semi-uncia_ of silver, or a quarter of a _libra_, or a quarter of a\r\n_libra_ and a _semi-uncia_--there is re-melted at the same time\r\nthirty-eight _centumpondia_ of it in this furnace, until there remain in\r\neach _centumpondium_ of the copper \"bottoms\" a third of a _libra_ and a\r\n_semi-uncia_ of silver. For example, if in each _centumpondium_ of\r\ncopper not yet re-melted, there is a quarter of a _libra_ and a\r\n_semi-uncia_ of silver, then the thirty-eight _centumpondia_ that are\r\nsmelted together must contain a total of eleven _librae_ and an _uncia_\r\nof silver. Since from fifteen _centumpondia_ of re-melted copper there\r\nwas a total of four and a third _librae_ and a _semi-uncia_ of silver,\r\nthere remain only two and a third _librae_. Thus there is left in the\r\n\"bottoms,\" weighing twenty-three _centumpondia_, a total of eight and\r\nthree-quarter _librae_ of silver. Therefore, each _centumpondium_ of\r\nthis contains a third of a _libra_ and a _semi-uncia_, a _drachma_, and\r\nthe twenty-third part of a _drachma_ of silver; from such copper it is\r\nprofitable to separate the silver. In order that the master may be more\r\ncertain of the number of _centumpondia_ of copper in the \"bottoms,\" he\r\nweighs the \"tops\" that have been drawn off from it; the \"tops\" were\r\nfirst drawn off into the dipping-pot, and cakes were made from them.\r\nFourteen hours are expended on the work of thus dividing the copper. The\r\n\"bottoms,\" when a certain weight of lead has been added to them, of\r\nwhich alloy I shall soon speak, are melted in the blast furnace;\r\nliquation cakes are then made, and the silver is afterward separated\r\nfrom the copper. The \"tops\" are subsequently melted in the blast\r\nfurnace, and re-melted in the refining furnace, in order that red copper\r\nshall be made[16]; and the \"tops\" from this are again smelted in the\r\nblast furnace, and then again in the refining furnace, that therefrom\r\nshall be made _caldarium_ copper. But when the copper, yellow or red or\r\n_caldarium_ is re-smelted in the refining furnace, forty _centumpondia_\r\nare placed in it, and from it they make at least twenty, and at most\r\nthirty-five, _centumpondia_. About twenty-two _centumpondia_ of\r\nexhausted liquation cakes and ten of yellow copper and eight of red, are\r\nsimultaneously placed in this latter furnace and smelted, in order that\r\nthey may be made into refined copper.\r\n\r\nThe copper \"bottoms\" are alloyed in three different ways with lead.[17]\r\nFirst, five-eighths of a _centumpondium_ of copper and two and\r\nthree-quarters _centumpondia_ of lead are taken; and since one liquation\r\ncake is made from this, therefore two and a half _centumpondia_ of\r\ncopper and eleven _centumpondia_ of lead make four liquation cakes.\r\nInasmuch as in each _centumpondium_ of copper there is a third of a\r\n_libra_ of silver, there would be in the whole of the copper\r\nten-twelfths of a _libra_ of silver; to these are added four\r\n_centumpondia_ of lead re-melted from \"slags,\" each _centumpondium_ of\r\nwhich contains a _sicilicus_ and a _drachma_ of silver, which weights\r\nmake up a total of an _uncia_ and a half of silver. There is also added\r\nseven _centumpondia_ of de-silverized lead, in each _centumpondium_ of\r\nwhich there is a _drachma_ of silver; therefore in the four cakes of\r\ncopper-lead alloy there is a total of a _libra_, a _sicilicus_ and a\r\n_drachma_ of silver. In each single _centumpondium_ of lead, after it\r\nhas been liquated from the copper, there is an _uncia_ and a _drachma_\r\nof silver, which alloy we call \"poor\" argentiferous lead, because it\r\ncontains but little silver. But as five cakes of that kind are placed\r\ntogether in the furnace, they liquate from them usually as much as nine\r\nand three-quarters _centumpondia_ of poor argentiferous lead, in each\r\n_centumpondium_ of which there is an _uncia_ and a _drachma_ of silver,\r\nor a total of ten _unciae_ less four _drachmae_. Of the liquation thorns\r\nthere remain three _centumpondia_, in each _centumpondium_ of which\r\nthere are three _sicilici_ of silver; and there remain four\r\n_centumpondia_ of exhausted liquation cakes, each _centumpondium_ of\r\nwhich contains a _semi-uncia_ or four and a half _drachmae_. Inasmuch as\r\nin a _centumpondium_ of copper \"bottoms\" there is a third of a _libra_\r\nand a _semi-uncia_ of silver, in five of those cakes there must be more\r\nthan one and a half _unciae_ and half a _drachma_ of silver.\r\n\r\nThen, again, from another two and a half _centumpondia_ of copper\r\n\"bottoms,\" together with eleven _centumpondia_ of lead, four liquation\r\ncakes are made. If in each _centumpondium_ of copper there was a third\r\nof a _libra_ of silver, there would be in the whole of the\r\n_centumpondia_ of base metal five-sixths of a _libra_ of the precious\r\nmetal. To this copper is added eight _centumpondia_ of poor\r\nargentiferous lead, each _centumpondium_ of which contains an _uncia_\r\nand a _drachma_ of silver, or a total of three-quarters of a _libra_ of\r\nsilver. There is also added three _centumpondia_ of de-silverized lead,\r\nin each _centumpondium_ of which there is a _drachma_ of silver.\r\nTherefore, four liquation cakes contain a total of a _libra_, seven\r\n_unciae_, a _sicilicus_ and a _drachma_ of silver; thus each\r\n_centumpondium_ of lead, when it has been liquated from the copper,\r\ncontains an _uncia_ and a half and a _sicilicus_ of silver, which alloy\r\nwe call \"medium\" silver-lead.\r\n\r\nThen, again, from another two and a half _centumpondia_ of copper\r\n\"bottoms,\" together with eleven _centumpondia_ of lead, they make four\r\nliquation cakes. If in each _centumpondium_ of copper there were\r\nlikewise a third of a _libra_ of silver, there will be in all the weight\r\nof the base metal five-sixths of a _libra_ of the precious metal. To\r\nthis is added nine _centumpondia_ of medium silver-lead, each\r\n_centumpondium_ of which contains an _uncia_ and a half and a\r\n_sicilicus_ of silver; or a total of a _libra_ and a quarter and a\r\n_semi-uncia_ and a _sicilicus_ of silver. And likewise they add two\r\n_centumpondia_ of poor silver-lead, in each of which there is an _uncia_\r\nand a _drachma_ of silver. Therefore the four liquation cakes contain\r\ntwo and a third _librae_ of silver. Each _centumpondium_ of lead, when\r\nit has been liquated from the copper, contains a sixth of a _libra_ and\r\na _semi-uncia_ and a _drachma_ of silver. This alloy we call \"rich\"\r\nsilver-lead; it is carried to the cupellation furnace, in which lead is\r\nseparated from silver. I have now mentioned in how many ways copper\r\ncontaining various proportions of silver is alloyed with lead, and how\r\nthey are melted together in the furnace and run into the casting pan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 514 (Crane for liquation cakes): A--Crane.

K--The tongs.]\r\n\r\nNow I will speak of the method by which lead is liquated from copper\r\nsimultaneously with the silver. The liquation cakes are raised from the\r\nground with the crane, and placed on the copper plates of the furnaces.\r\nThe hook of the chain let down from the arm of the crane, is inserted in\r\na ring of the tongs, one jaw of which has a tooth; a ring is engaged in\r\neach of the handles of the tongs, and these two rings are engaged in a\r\nthird, in which the hook of the chain is inserted. The tooth on the one\r\njaw of the tongs is struck by a hammer, and driven into the hole in the\r\ncake, at the point where the straight end of the hook was driven into\r\nit when it was lifted out of the copper mould; the other jaw of the\r\ntongs, which has no tooth, squeezes the cake, lest the tooth should fall\r\nout of it; the tongs are one and a half feet long, each ring is a digit\r\nand a half thick, and the inside is a palm and two digits in diameter.\r\nThose cranes by which the cakes are lifted out of the copper pans and\r\nplaced on the ground, and lifted up again from there and placed in the\r\nfurnaces, are two in number--one in the middle space between the third\r\ntransverse wall and the two upright posts, and the other in the middle\r\nspace between the same posts and the seventh transverse wall. The\r\nrectangular crane-post of both of these is two feet wide and thick, and\r\nis eighteen feet from the third long wall, and nineteen from the second\r\nlong wall. There are two drums in the framework of each--one drum\r\nconsisting of rundles, the other being toothed. The crane-arm of each\r\nextends seventeen feet, three palms and as many digits from the post.\r\nThe trolley of each crane is two feet and as many palms long, a foot and\r\ntwo digits wide, and a palm and two digits thick; but where it runs\r\nbetween the beams of the crane-arm it is three digits wide and a palm\r\nthick; it has five notches, in which turn five brass wheels, four of\r\nwhich are small, and the fifth much larger than the rest. The notches in\r\nwhich the small wheels turn are two palms long and as much as a palm\r\nwide; those wheels are a palm wide and a palm and two digits in\r\ndiameter; four of the notches are near the four corners of the trolley;\r\nthe fifth notch is between the two front ones, and it is two palms back\r\nfrom the front. Its pulley is larger than the rest, and turns in its own\r\nnotch; it is three palms in diameter and one palm wide, and grooved on\r\nthe circumference, so that the iron chain may run in the groove. The\r\ntrolley has two small axles, to the one in front are fastened three, and\r\nto the one at the back, the two wheels; two wheels run on the one beam\r\nof the crane-arm, and two on the other; the fifth wheel, which is larger\r\nthan the others, runs between those two beams. Those people who have no\r\ncranes place the cakes on a triangular board, to which iron cleats are\r\naffixed, so that it will last longer; the board has three iron chains,\r\nwhich are fixed in an iron ring at the top; two workmen pass a pole\r\nthrough the ring and carry it on their shoulders, and thus take the cake\r\nto the furnace in which silver is separated from copper.\r\n\r\nFrom the vicinity of the furnaces in which copper is mixed with lead and\r\nthe \"slags\" are re-melted, to the third long wall, are likewise ten\r\nfurnaces, in which silver mixed with lead is separated from copper. If\r\nthis space is eighty feet and two palms long, and the third long wall\r\nhas in the centre a door three feet and two palms wide, then the spaces\r\nremaining at either side of the door will be thirty-eight feet and two\r\npalms; and if each of the furnaces occupies four feet and a palm, then\r\nthe interval between each furnace and the next one must be a foot and\r\nthree palms; thus the width of the five furnaces and four interspaces\r\nwill be twenty-eight feet and a palm. Therefore, there remain ten feet\r\nand a palm, which measurement is so divided that there are five feet and\r\ntwo digits between the first furnace and the transverse wall, and as\r\nmany feet and digits between the fifth furnace and the door; similarly\r\nin the other part of the space from the door to the sixth furnace, there\r\nmust be five feet and two digits, and from the tenth furnace to the\r\nseventh transverse wall, likewise, five feet and two digits. The door is\r\nsix feet and two palms high; through it the foreman of the _officina_\r\nand the workmen enter the store-room in which the silver-lead alloy is\r\nkept.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 517 (Liquation Furnace): A--Sole-stones.

P--Hearth.\r\nQ--Receiving-pit.]\r\n\r\nEach furnace has a bed, a hearth, a rear wall, two sides and a front,\r\nand a receiving-pit. The bed consists of two sole-stones, four\r\nrectangular stones, and two copper plates; the sole-stones are five feet\r\nand a palm long, a cubit wide, a foot and a palm thick, and they are\r\nsunk into the ground, so that they emerge a palm and two digits; they\r\nare distant from each other about three palms, yet the distance is\r\nnarrower at the back than the front. Each of the rectangular stones is\r\ntwo feet and as many palms long, a cubit wide, and a cubit thick at the\r\nouter edge, and a foot and a palm thick on the inner edge which faces\r\nthe hearth, thus they form an incline, so that there is a slope to the\r\ncopper plates which are laid upon them. Two of these rectangular stones\r\nare placed on one sole-stone; a hole is cut in the upper edge of each,\r\nand into the holes are placed iron clamps, and lead is poured in; they\r\nare so placed on the sole-stones that they project a palm at the sides,\r\nand at the front the sole-stones project to the same extent; if\r\nrectangular stones are not available, bricks are laid in their place.\r\nThe copper plates are four feet two palms and as many digits long, a\r\ncubit wide, and a palm thick; each edge has a protuberance, one at the\r\nfront end, the other at the back; these are a palm and three digits\r\nlong, and a palm wide and thick. The plates are so laid upon the\r\nrectangular stones that their rear ends are three digits from the third\r\nlong wall; the stones project beyond the plate the same number of digits\r\nin front, and a palm and three digits at the sides. When the plates have\r\nbeen joined, the groove which is between the protuberances is a palm and\r\nthree digits wide, and four feet long, and through it flows the\r\nsilver-lead which liquates from the cakes. When the plates are corroded\r\neither by the fire or by the silver-lead, which often adheres to them in\r\nthe form of stalactites, and is chipped off, they are exchanged, the\r\nright one being placed to the left, and the left one, on the contrary,\r\nto the right; but the left side of the plates, which, when the fusion of\r\nthe copper took place, came into contact with the copper, must lie flat;\r\nso that when the exchange of the plates has been carried out, the\r\nprotuberances, which are thus on the underside, raise the plate from the\r\nstones, and they have to be partially chipped off, lest they should\r\nprove an impediment to the work; and in each of their places is laid a\r\npiece of iron, three palms long, a digit thick at both ends, and a palm\r\nthick in the centre for the length of a palm and three digits.\r\n\r\nThe passage under the plates between the rectangular stones is a foot\r\nwide at the back, and a foot and a palm wide at the front, for it\r\ngradually widens out. The hearth, which is between the sole-stones, is\r\ncovered with a bed of hearth-lead, taken from the crucible in which lead\r\nis separated from silver. The rear end is the highest, and should be so\r\nhigh that it reaches to within six digits of the plates, from which\r\npoint it slopes down evenly to the front end, so that the argentiferous\r\nlead alloy which liquates from the cakes can flow into the\r\nreceiving-pit. The wall built against the third long wall in order to\r\nprotect it from injury by fire, is constructed of bricks joined together\r\nwith lute, and stands on the copper plates; this wall is two feet, a\r\npalm and two digits high, two palms thick, and three feet, a palm and\r\nthree digits wide at the bottom, for it reaches across both of them; at\r\nthe top it is three feet wide, for it rises up obliquely on each side.\r\nAt each side of this wall, at a height of a palm and two digits above\r\nthe top of it, there is inserted in a hole in the third long wall a\r\nhooked iron rod, fastened in with molten lead; the rod projects two\r\npalms from the wall, and is two digits wide and one digit thick; it has\r\ntwo hooks, the one at the side, the other at the end. Both of these\r\nhooks open toward the wall, and both are a digit thick, and both are\r\ninserted in the last, or the adjacent, links of a short iron chain. This\r\nchain consists of four links, each of which is a palm and a digit long\r\nand half a digit thick; the first link is engaged in the first hole in a\r\nlong iron rod, and one or other of the remaining three links engages the\r\nhook of the hooked rod. The two long rods are three feet and as many\r\npalms and digits long, two digits wide, and one digit thick; both ends\r\nof both of these rods have holes, the back one of which is round and a\r\ndigit in diameter, and in this is engaged the first link of the chain as\r\nI have stated; the hole at the front end is two digits and a half long\r\nand a digit and a half wide. This end of each rod is made three digits\r\nwide, while for the rest of its length it is only two digits, and at the\r\nback it is two and a half digits. Into the front hole of each rod is\r\ndriven an iron bar, which is three feet and two palms long, two digits\r\nwide and one thick; in the end of this bar are five small square holes,\r\ntwo-thirds of a digit square; each hole is distant from the other half a\r\ndigit, the first being at a distance of about a digit from the end. Into\r\none of these holes the refiner drives an iron pin; if he should desire\r\nto make the furnace narrower, then he drives it into the last hole; if\r\nhe should desire to widen it, then into the first hole; if he should\r\ndesire to contract it moderately, then into one of the middle holes. For\r\nthe same reason, therefore, the hook is sometimes inserted into the last\r\nlink of the chain, and sometimes into the third or the second. The\r\nfurnace is widened when many cakes are put into it, and contracted when\r\nthere are but few, but to put in more than five is neither usual nor\r\npossible; indeed, it is because of thin cakes that the walls are\r\ncontracted. The bar has a hump, which projects a digit on each side at\r\nthe back, of the same width and thickness as itself. These humps\r\nproject, lest the bar should slip through the hole of the right-hand\r\nrod, in which it remains fixed when it, together with the rods, is not\r\npressing upon the furnace walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 519 (Liquation Furnaces): A--Furnace in which the\r\noperation of liquation is being performed. B--Furnace in which it is not\r\nbeing performed. C--Receiving-pit. D--Moulds. E--Cakes. F--Liquation\r\nthorns.]\r\n\r\nThere are three panels to the furnace--two at the sides, one in front\r\nand another at the back. Those which are at the sides are three feet and\r\nas many palms and two digits long, and two feet high; the front one is\r\ntwo feet and a palm and three digits long, and, like the side ones, two\r\nfeet high. Each consists of iron bars, of feet, and of iron plates.\r\nThose which are at the side have seven bars, the lower and upper of\r\nwhich are of the same length as the panels; the former holds up the\r\nupright bars; the latter is placed upon them; the uprights are five in\r\nnumber, and have the same height as the panels; the middle ones are\r\ninserted into holes in the upper and lower bars; the outer ones are made\r\nof one and the same bar as the lower and upper ones. They are two digits\r\nwide and one thick. The front panel has five bars; the lower one holds\r\nsimilar uprights, but there are three of them only; the upper bar is\r\nplaced on them. Each of these panels has two feet fixed at each end of\r\nthe lower bar, and these are two palms long, one wide, and a digit\r\nthick. The iron plates are fastened to the inner side of the bars with\r\niron wire, and they are covered with lute, so that they may last longer\r\nand may be uninjured by the fire. There are, besides, iron blocks three\r\npalms long, one wide, and a digit and a half thick; the upper surface of\r\nthese is somewhat hollowed out, so that the cakes may stand in them;\r\nthese iron blocks are dipped into a vessel in which there is clay mixed\r\nwith water, and they are used only for placing under the cakes of copper\r\nand lead alloy made in the furnaces. There is more silver in these than\r\nin those which are made of liquation thorns, or furnace accretions, or\r\nre-melted \"slags.\" Two iron blocks are placed under each cake, in order\r\nthat, by raising it up, the fire may bring more force to bear upon it;\r\nthe one is put on the right bed-plate, the other on the left. Finally,\r\noutside the hearth is the receiving-pit, which is a foot wide and three\r\npalms deep; when this is worn away it is restored with lute alone, which\r\neasily retains the lead alloy.\r\n\r\nIf four liquation cakes are placed on the plates of each furnace, then\r\nthe iron blocks are laid under them; but if the cakes are made from\r\ncopper \"bottoms,\" or from liquation thorns, or from the accretions or\r\n\"slags,\" of which I have partly written above and will further describe\r\na little later, there are five of them, and because they are not so\r\nlarge and heavy, no blocks are placed under them. Pieces of charcoal six\r\ndigits long are laid between the cakes, lest they should fall one\r\nagainst the other, or lest the last one should fall against the wall\r\nwhich protects the third long wall from injury by fire. In the middle\r\nempty spaces, long and large pieces of charcoal are likewise laid. Then\r\nwhen the panels have been set up, and the bar has been closed, the\r\nfurnace is filled with small charcoal, and a wicker basket full of\r\ncharcoal is thrown into the receiving-pit, and over that are thrown live\r\ncoals; soon afterward the burning coal, lifted up in a shovel, is spread\r\nover all parts of the furnace, so that the charcoal in it may be\r\nkindled; any charcoal which remains in the receiving-pit is thrown into\r\nthe passage, so that it may likewise be heated. If this has not been\r\ndone, the silver-lead alloy liquated from the cakes is frozen by the\r\ncoldness of the passage, and does not run down into the receiving-pit.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of an hour the cakes begin to drip silver-lead\r\nalloy,[18] which runs down through the openings between the copper\r\nplates into the passage. When the long pieces of charcoal have burned\r\nup, if the cakes lean toward the wall, they are placed upright again\r\nwith a hooked bar, but if they lean toward the front bar they are\r\npropped up by charcoal; moreover, if some cakes shrink more than the\r\nrest, charcoal is added to the former and not to the others. The silver\r\ndrips together with the lead, for both melt more rapidly than copper.\r\nThe liquation thorns do not flow away, but remain in the passage, and\r\nshould be turned over frequently with a hooked bar, in order that the\r\nsilver-lead may liquate away from them and flow down into the receiving\r\npit; that which remains is again melted in the blast furnace, while that\r\nwhich flows into the receiving pit is at once carried with the remaining\r\nproducts to the cupellation furnace, where the lead is separated from\r\nthe silver. The hooked bar has an iron handle two feet long, in which is\r\nset a wooden one four feet long. The silver-lead which runs out into the\r\nreceiving-pit is poured out by the refiner with a bronze ladle into\r\neight copper moulds, which are two palms and three digits in diameter;\r\nthese are first smeared with a lute wash so that the cakes of\r\nsilver-lead may more easily fall out when they are turned over. If the\r\nsupply of moulds fails because the silver-lead flows down too rapidly\r\ninto the receiving-pit, then water is poured on them, in order that the\r\ncakes may cool and be taken out of them more rapidly; thus the same\r\nmoulds may be used again immediately; if no such necessity urges the\r\nrefiner, he washes over the empty moulds with a lute wash. The ladle is\r\nexactly similar to that which is used in pouring out the metals that are\r\nmelted in the blast furnace. When all the silver-lead has run down from\r\nthe passage into the receiving-pit, and has been poured out into copper\r\nmoulds, the thorns are drawn out of the passage into the receiving-pit\r\nwith a rabble; afterward they are raked on to the ground from the\r\nreceiving-pit, thrown with a shovel into a wheelbarrow, and, having been\r\nconveyed away to a heap, are melted once again. The blade of the rabble\r\nis two palms and as many digits long, two palms and a digit wide, and\r\njoined to its back is an iron handle three feet long; into the iron\r\nhandle is inserted a wooden one as many feet in length.\r\n\r\nThe residue cakes, after the silver-lead has been liquated from the\r\ncopper, are called \"exhausted liquation cakes\" (_fathiscentes_), because\r\nwhen thus smelted they appear to be dried up. By placing a crowbar under\r\nthe cakes they are raised up, seized with tongs, and placed in the\r\nwheelbarrow; they are then conveyed away to the furnace in which they\r\nare \"dried.\" The crowbar is somewhat similar to those generally used to\r\nchip off the accretions that adhere to the walls of the blast furnace.\r\nThe tongs are two and a half feet long. With the same crowbar the\r\nstalactites are chipped off from the copper plates from which they hang,\r\nand with the same instrument the iron blocks are struck off the\r\nexhausted liquation cakes to which they adhere. The refiner has\r\nperformed his day's task when he has liquated the silver-lead from\r\nsixteen of the large cakes and twenty of the smaller ones; if he\r\nliquates more than this, he is paid separately for it at the price for\r\nextraordinary work.\r\n\r\nSilver, or lead mixed with silver, which we call _stannum_, is separated\r\nby the above method from copper. This silver-lead is carried to the\r\ncupellation furnace, in which lead is separated from silver; of these\r\nmethods I will mention only one, because in the previous book I have\r\nexplained them in detail. Amongst us some years ago only forty-four\r\n_centumpondia_ of silver-lead and one of copper were melted together in\r\nthe cupellation furnaces, but now they melt forty-six _centumpondia_ of\r\nsilver-lead and one and a half _centumpondia_ of copper; in other\r\nplaces, usually a hundred and twenty _centumpondia_ of silver-lead alloy\r\nand six of copper are melted, in which manner they make about one\r\nhundred and ten _centumpondia_ more or less of litharge and thirty of\r\nhearth-lead. But in all these methods the silver which is in the copper\r\nis mixed with the remainder of silver; the copper itself, equally with\r\nthe lead, will be changed partly into litharge and partly into\r\nhearth-lead.[19] The silver-lead alloy which does not melt is taken from\r\nthe margin of the crucible with a hooked bar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 522 (Exhausted Liquation Cakes): A--Cakes. B--Hammer.]\r\n\r\nThe work of \"drying\" is distributed into four operations, which are\r\nperformed in four days. On the first--as likewise on the other three\r\ndays--the master begins at the fourth hour of the morning, and with his\r\nassistant chips off the stalactites from the exhausted liquation cakes.\r\nThey then carry the cakes to the furnace, and put the stalactites upon\r\nthe heap of liquation thorns. The head of the chipping hammer is three\r\npalms and as many digits long; its sharp edge is a palm wide; the round\r\nend is three digits thick; the wooden handle is four feet long.\r\n\r\nThe master throws pulverised earth into a small vessel, sprinkles water\r\nover it, and mixes it; this he pours over the whole hearth, and\r\nsprinkles charcoal dust over it to the thickness of a digit. If he\r\nshould neglect this, the copper, settling in the passages, would adhere\r\nto the copper bed-plates, from which it can be chipped off only with\r\ndifficulty; or else it would adhere to the bricks, if the hearth was\r\ncovered with them, and when the copper is chipped off these they are\r\neasily broken. On the second day, at the same time, the master arranges\r\nbricks in ten rows; in this manner twelve passages are made. The first\r\ntwo rows of bricks are between the first and the second openings on the\r\nright of the furnace; the next three rows are between the second and\r\nthird openings, the following three rows are between the third and the\r\nfourth openings, and the last two rows between the fourth and fifth\r\nopenings. These bricks are a foot and a palm long, two palms and a digit\r\nwide, and a palm and two digits thick; there are seven of these thick\r\nbricks in a row, so there are seventy all together. Then on the first\r\nthree rows of bricks they lay exhausted liquation cakes and a layer five\r\ndigits thick of large charcoal; then in a similar way more exhausted\r\nliquation cakes are laid upon the other bricks, and charcoal is thrown\r\nupon them; in this manner seventy _centumpondia_ of cakes are put on the\r\nhearth of the furnace. But if half of this weight, or a little more, is\r\nto be \"dried,\" then four rows of bricks will suffice. Those who dry\r\nexhausted liquation cakes[20] made from copper \"bottoms\" place ninety or\r\na hundred _centumpondia_[21] into the furnace at the same time. A place\r\nis left in the front part of the furnace for the topmost cakes removed\r\nfrom the forehearth in which copper is made, these being more suitable\r\nfor supporting the exhausted liquation cakes than are iron plates;\r\nindeed, if the former cakes drip copper from the heat, this can be taken\r\nback with the liquation thorns to the first furnace, but melted iron is\r\nof no use to us in these matters. When the cakes of this kind have been\r\nplaced in front of the exhausted liquation cakes, the workman inserts\r\nthe iron bar into the holes on the inside of the wall, which are at a\r\nheight of three palms and two digits above the hearth; the hole to the\r\nleft penetrates through into the wall, so that the bar may be pushed\r\nback and forth. This bar is round, eight feet long and two digits in\r\ndiameter; on the right side it has a haft made of iron, which is about a\r\nfoot from the right end; the aperture in this haft is a palm wide, two\r\ndigits high, and a digit thick. The bar holds the exhausted liquation\r\ncakes opposite, lest they should fall down. When the operation of\r\n\"drying\" is completed, a workman draws out this bar with a crook which\r\nhe inserts into the haft, as I will explain hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 525 (Drying Furnace for Liquation): A--Side walls.\r\nB--Front arch.

X--Copper\r\nbed-plates.]\r\n\r\nIn order that one should understand those things of which I have spoken,\r\nand concerning which I am about to speak, it is necessary for me to give\r\nsome information beforehand about the furnace and how it is to be made.\r\nIt stands nine feet from the fourth long wall, and as far from the wall\r\nwhich is between the second and fourth transverse walls. It consists of\r\nwalls, an arch, a chimney, an interior wall, and a hearth; the two walls\r\nare at the sides; and they are eleven feet three palms and two digits\r\nlong, and where they support the chimney they are eight feet and a palm\r\nhigh. At the front of the arch they are only seven feet high; they are\r\ntwo feet three palms and two digits thick, and are made either of rock\r\nor of bricks; the distance between them is eight feet, a palm and two\r\ndigits. There are two of the arches, for the space at the rear between\r\nthe walls is also arched from the ground, in order that it may be able\r\nto support the chimney; the foundations of these arches are the walls of\r\nthe furnace; the span of the arch has the same length as the space\r\nbetween the walls; the top of the arch is five feet, a palm and two\r\ndigits high. In the rear arch there is a wall made of bricks joined with\r\nlime; this wall at a height of a foot and three palms from the ground\r\nhas five vent-holes, which are two palms and a digit high, a palm and a\r\ndigit wide, of which the first is near the right interior wall, and the\r\nlast near the left interior wall, the remaining three in the intervening\r\nspace; these vent-holes penetrate through the interior of the wall which\r\nis in the arch. Half-bricks can be placed over the vent-holes, lest too\r\nmuch air should be drawn into the furnace, and they can be taken out at\r\ntimes, in order that he who is \"drying\" the exhausted liquation cakes\r\nmay inspect the passages, as they are called, to see whether the cakes\r\nare being properly \"dried.\" The front arch is three feet two palms\r\ndistant from the rear one; this arch is the same thickness as that of\r\nthe rear arch, but the span is six feet wide; the interior of the arch\r\nitself is of the same height as the walls. A chimney is built upon the\r\narches and the walls, and is made of bricks joined together with lime;\r\nit is thirty-six feet high and penetrates through the roof. The interior\r\nwall is built against the rear arch and both the side walls, from which\r\nit juts out a foot; it is three feet and the same number of palms high,\r\nthree palms thick, and is made of bricks joined together with lute and\r\nsmeared thickly with lute, sloping up to the height of a foot above it.\r\nThis wall is a kind of shield, for it protects the exterior walls from\r\nthe heat of the fire, which is apt to injure them; the latter cannot be\r\neasily re-made, while the former can be repaired with little work.\r\n\r\nThe hearth is made of lute, and is covered either with copper plates,\r\nsuch as those of the furnaces in which silver is liquated from copper,\r\nalthough they have no protuberances, or it may be covered with bricks,\r\nif the owners are unwilling to incur the expense of copper plates. The\r\nwider part of the hearth is made sloping in such a manner that the rear\r\nend reaches as high as the five vent-holes, and the front end of the\r\nhearth is so low that the back of the front arch is four feet, three\r\npalms and as many digits above it, and the front five feet, three palms\r\nand as many digits. The hearth beyond the furnaces is paved with bricks\r\nfor a distance of six feet. Near the furnace, against the fourth long\r\nwall, is a tank thirteen feet and a palm long, four feet wide, and a\r\nfoot and three palms deep. It is lined on all sides with planks, lest\r\nthe earth should fall into it; on one side the water flows in through\r\npipes, and on the other, if the plug be pulled out, it soaks into the\r\nearth; into this tank of water are thrown the cakes of copper from which\r\nthe silver and lead have been separated. The fore part of the front\r\nfurnace arch should be partly closed with an iron door; the bottom of\r\nthis door is six feet and two digits wide; the upper part is somewhat\r\nrounded, and at the highest point, which is in the middle, it is three\r\nfeet and two palms high. It is made of iron bars, with plates fastened\r\nto them with iron wire, there being seven bars--three transverse and\r\nfour upright--each of which is two digits wide and half a digit thick.\r\nThe lowest transverse bar is six feet and two palms long; the middle one\r\nhas the same length; the upper one is curved and higher at the centre,\r\nand thus longer than the other two. The upright bars are two feet\r\ndistant from one another; both the outer ones are two feet and as many\r\npalms high; but the centre ones are three feet and two palms. They\r\nproject from the upper curved transverse bar and have holes, in which\r\nare inserted the hooks of small chains two feet long; the topmost links\r\nof these chains are engaged in the ring of a third chain, which, when\r\nextended, reaches to one end of a beam which is somewhat cut out. The\r\nchain then turns around the beam, and again hanging down, the hook in\r\nthe other end is fastened in one of the links. This beam is eleven feet\r\nlong, a palm and two digits wide, a palm thick, and turns on an iron\r\naxle fixed in a nearby timber; the rear end of the beam has an iron pin,\r\nwhich is three palms and a digit long, and which penetrates through it\r\nwhere it lies under a timber, and projects from it a palm and two digits\r\non one side, and three digits on the other side. At this point the pin\r\nis perforated, in order that a ring may be fixed in it and hold it,\r\nlest it should fall out of the beam; that end is hardly a digit thick,\r\nwhile the other round end is thicker than a digit. When the door is to\r\nbe shut, this pin lies under the timber and holds the door so that it\r\ncannot fall; the pin likewise prevents the rectangular iron band which\r\nencircles the end of the beam, and into which is inserted the ring of a\r\nlong hook, from falling from the end. The lowest link of an iron chain,\r\nwhich is six feet long, is inserted in the ring of a staple driven into\r\nthe right wall of the furnace, and fixed firmly by filling in with\r\nmolten lead. The hook suspended at the top from the ring should be\r\ninserted in one of these lower links, when the door is to be raised;\r\nwhen the door is to be let down, the hook is taken out of that link and\r\nput into one of the upper links.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 527 (Drying Furnace for Liquation): A--The door let down.\r\nB--Bar. C--Exhausted liquation cakes. D--Bricks. E--Tongs.]\r\n\r\nOn the third day the master sets about the principal operation. First he\r\nthrows a basketful of charcoals on to the ground in front of the hearth,\r\nand kindles them by adding live coals, and having thrown live coals on\r\nto the cakes placed within, he spreads them equally all over with an\r\niron shovel. The blade of the shovel is three palms and a digit long,\r\nand three palms wide; its iron handle is two palms long, and the wooden\r\none ten feet long, so that it can reach to the rear wall of the furnace.\r\nThe exhausted liquation cakes become incandescent in an hour and a half,\r\nif the copper was good and hard, or after two hours, if it was soft and\r\nfragile. The workman adds charcoal to them where he sees it is needed,\r\nthrowing it into the furnace through the openings on both sides between\r\nthe side walls and the closed door. This opening is a foot and a palm\r\nwide. He lets down the door, and when the \"slags\" begin to flow he opens\r\nthe passages with a bar; this should take place after five hours; the\r\ndoor is let down over the upper open part of the arch for two feet and\r\nas many digits, so that the master can bear the violence of the heat.\r\nWhen the cakes shrink, charcoal should not be added to them lest they\r\nshould melt. If the cakes made from poor and fragile copper are \"dried\"\r\nwith cakes made from good hard copper, very often the copper so settles\r\ninto the passages that a bar thrust into them cannot penetrate them.\r\nThis bar is of iron, six feet and two palms long, into which a wooden\r\nhandle five feet long is inserted. The refiner draws off the \"slags\"\r\nwith a rabble from the right side of the hearth. The blade of the rabble\r\nis made of an iron plate a foot and a palm wide, gradually narrowing\r\ntoward the handle; the blade is two palms high, its iron handle is two\r\nfeet long, and the wooden handle set into it is ten feet long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 528 (Drying Furnace for Liquation): A--The door raised.\r\nB--Hooked bar. C--Two-pronged rake. D--Tongs. E--Tank.]\r\n\r\nWhen the exhausted liquation cakes have been \"dried,\" the master raises\r\nthe door in the manner I have described, and with a long iron hook\r\ninserted into the haft of the bar he draws it through the hole in the\r\nleft wall from the hole in the right wall; afterward he pushes it back\r\nand replaces it. The master then takes out the exhausted liquation cakes\r\nnearest to him with the iron hook; then he pulls out the cakes from the\r\nbricks. This hook is two palms high, as many digits wide, and one thick;\r\nits iron handle is two feet long, and the wooden handle eleven feet\r\nlong. There is also a two-pronged rake with which the \"dried\" cakes are\r\ndrawn over to the left side so that they may be seized with tongs; the\r\nprongs of the rake are pointed, and are two palms long, as many digits\r\nwide, and one digit thick; the iron part of the handle is a foot long,\r\nthe wooden part nine feet long. The \"dried\" cakes, taken out of the\r\nhearth by the master and his assistants, are seized with other tongs and\r\nthrown into the rectangular tank, which is almost filled with water.\r\nThese tongs are two feet and three palms long, both the handles are\r\nround and more than a digit thick, and the ends are bent for a palm and\r\ntwo digits; both the jaws are a digit and a half wide in front and\r\nsharpened; at the back they are a digit thick, and then gradually taper,\r\nand when closed, the interior is two palms and as many digits wide.\r\n\r\nThe \"dried\" cakes which are dripping copper are not immediately dipped\r\ninto the tank, because, if so, they burst in fragments and give out a\r\nsound like thunder. The cakes are afterward taken out of the tank with\r\nthe tongs, and laid upon the two transverse planks on which the workmen\r\nstand; the sooner they are taken out the easier it is to chip off the\r\ncopper that has become ash-coloured. Finally, the master, with a spade,\r\nraises up the bricks a little from the hearth, while they are still\r\nwarm. The blade of the spade is a palm and two digits long, the lower\r\nedge is sharp, and is a palm and a digit wide, the upper end a palm\r\nwide; its handle is round, the iron part being two feet long, and the\r\nwooden part seven and a half feet long.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day the master draws out the liquation thorns which have\r\nsettled in the passages; they are much richer in silver than those that\r\nare made when the silver-lead is liquated from copper in the liquation\r\nfurnace. The \"dried\" cakes drip but little copper, but nearly all their\r\nremaining silver-lead and the thorns consist of it, for, indeed, in one\r\n_centumpondium_ of \"dried\" copper there should remain only half an\r\n_uncia_ of silver, and there sometimes remain only three _drachmae_.[22]\r\nSome smelters chip off the metal adhering to the bricks with a hammer,\r\nin order that it may be melted again; others, however, crush the bricks\r\nunder the stamps and wash them, and the copper and lead thus collected\r\nis melted again. The master, when he has taken these things away and put\r\nthem in their places, has finished his day's work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 530 (Dried Liquation Cakes): A--Tank. B--Board. C--Tongs.\r\nD--\"Dried\" cakes taken out of the tanks. E--Block. F--Rounded hammer.\r\nG--Pointed hammer.]\r\n\r\nThe assistants take the \"dried\" cakes out of the tank on the next day,\r\nplace them on an oak block, and first pound them with rounded hammers in\r\norder that the ash-coloured copper may fall away from them, and then\r\nthey dig out with pointed picks the holes in the cakes, which contain\r\nthe same kind of copper. The head of the round hammer is three palms and\r\na digit long; one end of the head is round and two digits long and\r\nthick; the other end is chisel-shaped, and is two digits and a half\r\nlong. The sharp pointed hammer is the same length as the round hammer,\r\nbut one end is pointed, the other end is square, and gradually tapers to\r\na point.\r\n\r\nThe nature of copper is such that when it is \"dried\" it becomes ash\r\ncoloured, and since this copper contains silver, it is smelted again in\r\nthe blast furnaces.[23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 532 (Copper Refining Furnace): A--Hearth of the furnace.\r\nB--Chimney.

R--Iron rod.]\r\n\r\nI have described sufficiently the method by which exhausted liquation\r\ncakes are \"dried\"; now I will speak of the method by which they are made\r\ninto copper after they have been \"dried.\" These cakes, in order that\r\nthey may recover the appearance of copper which they have to some extent\r\nlost, are melted in four furnaces, which are placed against the second\r\nlong wall in the part of the building between the second and third\r\ntransverse walls. This space is sixty-three feet and two palms long, and\r\nsince each of these furnaces occupies thirteen feet, the space which is\r\non the right side of the first furnace, and on the left of the fourth,\r\nare each three feet and three palms wide, and the distance between the\r\nsecond and third furnace is six feet. In the middle of each of these\r\nthree spaces is a door, a foot and a half wide and six feet high, and\r\nthe middle one is common to the master of each of the furnaces. Each\r\nfurnace has its own chimney, which rises between the two long walls\r\nmentioned above, and is supported by two arches and a partition wall.\r\nThe partition wall is between the two furnaces, and is five feet long,\r\nten feet high, and two feet thick; in front of it is a pillar belonging\r\nin common to the front arches of the furnace on either side, which is\r\ntwo feet and as many palms thick, three feet and a half wide. The front\r\narch reaches from this common pillar to another pillar that is common to\r\nthe side arch of the same furnace; this arch on the right spans from the\r\nsecond long wall to the same pillar, which is two feet and as many palms\r\nwide and thick at the bottom. The interior of the front arch is nine\r\nfeet and a palm wide, and eight feet high at its highest point; the\r\ninterior of the arch which is on the right side, is five feet and a palm\r\nwide, and of equal height to the other, and both the arches are built of\r\nthe same height as the partition wall. Imposed upon these arches and the\r\npartition wall are the walls of the chimney; these slope upward, and\r\nthus contract, so that at the upper part, where the fumes are emitted,\r\nthe opening is eight feet in length, one foot and three palms in width.\r\nThe fourth wall of the chimney is built vertically upon the second long\r\nwall. As the partition wall is common to the two furnaces, so its\r\nsuperstructure is common to the two chimneys. In this sensible manner\r\nthe chimney is built. At the front each furnace is six feet two palms\r\nlong, and three feet two palms wide, and a cubit high; the back of each\r\nfurnace is against the second long wall, the front being open. The first\r\nfurnace is open and sloping at the right side, so that the slags may be\r\ndrawn out; the left side is against the partition wall, and has a little\r\nwall built of bricks cemented together with lute; this little wall\r\nprotects the partition wall from injury by the fire. On the contrary,\r\nthe second furnace has the left side open and the right side is against\r\nthe partition wall, where also it has its own little wall which protects\r\nthe partition wall from the fire. The front of each furnace is built of\r\nrectangular rocks; the interior of it is filled up with earth. Then in\r\neach of the furnaces at the rear, against the second long wall, is an\r\naperture through an arch at the back, and in these are fixed the copper\r\npipes. Each furnace has a round pit, two feet and as many palms wide,\r\nbuilt three feet away from the partition wall. Finally, under the pit of\r\nthe furnace, at a depth of a cubit, is the hidden receptacle for\r\nmoisture, similar to the others, whose vent penetrates through the\r\nsecond long wall and slopes upward to the right from the first furnace,\r\nand to the left from the second. If copper is to be made the next day,\r\nthen the master cuts out the crucible with a spatula, the blade of which\r\nis three digits wide and as many palms long, the iron handle being two\r\nfeet long and one and a half digits in diameter; the wooden handle\r\ninserted into it is round, five feet long and two digits in diameter.\r\nThen, with another cutting spatula, he makes the crucible smooth; the\r\nblade of this spatula is a palm wide and two palms long; its handle,\r\npartly of iron, partly of wood, is similar in every respect to the first\r\none. Afterward he throws pulverised clay and charcoal into the crucible,\r\npours water over it, and sweeps it over with a broom into which a stick\r\nis fixed. Then immediately he throws into the crucible a powder, made of\r\ntwo wheelbarrowsful of sifted charcoal dust, as many wheelbarrowsful of\r\npulverised clay likewise sifted, and six basketsful of river sand which\r\nhas passed through a very fine sieve. This powder, like that used by\r\nsmelters, is sprinkled with water and moistened before it is put into\r\nthe crucible, so that it may be fashioned by the hands into shapes\r\nsimilar to snowballs. When it has been put in, the master first kneads\r\nit and makes it smooth with his hands, and then pounds it with two\r\nwooden pestles, each of which is a cubit long; each pestle has a round\r\nhead at each end, but one of these is a palm in diameter, the other\r\nthree digits; both are thinner in the middle, so that they may be held\r\nin the hand. Then he again throws moistened powder into the crucible,\r\nand again makes it smooth with his hands, and kneads it with his fists\r\nand with the pestles; then, pushing upward and pressing with his\r\nfingers, he makes the edge of the crucible smooth. After the crucible\r\nhas been made smooth, he sprinkles in dry charcoal dust, and again\r\npounds it with the same pestles, at first with the narrow heads, and\r\nafterward with the wider ones. Then he pounds the crucible with a wooden\r\nmallet two feet long, both heads of which are round and three digits in\r\ndiameter; its wooden handle is two palms long, and one and a half digits\r\nin diameter. Finally, he throws into the crucible as much pure sifted\r\nashes as both hands can hold, and pours water into it, and, taking an\r\nold linen rag, he smears the crucible over with the wet ashes. The\r\ncrucible is round and sloping. If copper is to be made from the best\r\nquality of \"dried\" cakes, it is made two feet wide and one deep, but if\r\nfrom other cakes, it is made a cubit wide and two palms deep. The master\r\nalso has an iron band curved at both ends, two palms long and as many\r\ndigits wide, and with this he cuts off the edges of the crucible if they\r\nare higher than is necessary. The copper pipe is inclined, and projects\r\nthree digits from the wall, and has its upper end and both sides smeared\r\nthick with lute, that it may not be burned; but the underside of the\r\npipe is smeared thinly with lute, for this side reaches almost to the\r\nedge of the crucible, and when the crucible is full the molten copper\r\ntouches it. The wall above the pipe is smeared over with lute, lest that\r\nshould be damaged. He does the same to the other side of an iron plate,\r\nwhich is a foot and three palms long and a foot high; this stands on\r\nstones near the crucible at the side where the hearth slopes, in order\r\nthat the slag may run out under it. Others do not place the plates upon\r\nstones, but cut out of the plate underneath a small piece, three digits\r\nlong and three digits wide; lest the plate should fall, it is supported\r\nby an iron rod fixed in the wall at a height of two palms and the same\r\nnumber of digits, and it projects from the wall three palms.\r\n\r\nThen with an iron shovel, whose wooden handle is six feet long, he\r\nthrows live charcoal into the crucible; or else charcoal, kindled by\r\nmeans of a few live coals, is added to them. Over the live charcoal he\r\nlays \"dried\" cakes, which, if they were of copper of the first quality,\r\nweigh all together three _centumpondia_, or three and a half\r\n_centumpondia_; but if they were of copper of the second quality, then\r\ntwo and a half _centumpondia_; if they were of the third quality, then\r\ntwo _centumpondia_ only; but if they were of copper of very superior\r\nquality, then they place upon it six _centumpondia_, and in this case\r\nthey make the crucible wider and deeper.[24] The lowest \"dried\" cake is\r\nplaced at a distance of two palms from the pipe, the rest at a greater\r\ndistance, and when the lower ones are melted the upper ones fall down\r\nand get nearer to the pipe; if they do not fall down they must be pushed\r\nwith a shovel. The blade of the shovel is a foot long, three palms and\r\ntwo digits wide, the iron part of the handle is two palms long, the\r\nwooden part nine feet. Round about the \"dried\" cakes are placed large\r\nlong pieces of charcoal, and in the pipe are placed medium-sized pieces.\r\nWhen all these things have been arranged in this manner, the fire must\r\nbe more violently excited by the blast from the bellows. When the copper\r\nis melting and the coals blaze, the master pushes an iron bar into the\r\nmiddle of them in order that they may receive the air, and that the\r\nflame can force its way out. This pointed bar is two and a half feet\r\nlong, and its wooden handle four feet long. When the cakes are partly\r\nmelted, the master, passing out through the door, inspects the crucible\r\nthrough the bronze pipe, and if he should find that too much of the\r\n\"slag\" is adhering to the mouth of the pipe, and thus impeding the blast\r\nof the bellows, he inserts the hooked iron bar into the pipe through the\r\nnozzle of the bellows, and, turning this about the mouth of the pipe, he\r\nremoves the \"slags\" from it. The hook on this bar is two digits high;\r\nthe iron part of the handle is three feet long; the wooden part is the\r\nsame number of palms long. Now it is time to insert the bar under the\r\niron plate, in order that the \"slags\" may flow out. When the cakes,\r\nbeing all melted, have run into the crucible, he takes out a sample of\r\ncopper with the third round bar, which is made wholly of iron, and is\r\nthree feet long, a digit thick, and has a steel point lest its pores\r\nshould absorb the copper. When he has compressed the bellows, he\r\nintroduces this bar as quickly as possible into the crucible through the\r\npipe between the two nozzles, and takes out samples two, three, or four\r\ntimes, until he finds that the copper is perfectly refined. If the\r\ncopper is good it adheres easily to the bar, and two samples suffice; if\r\nit is not good, then many are required. It is necessary to smelt it in\r\nthe crucible until the copper adhering to the bar is seen to be of a\r\nbrassy colour, and if the upper as well as the lower part of the thin\r\nlayer of copper may be easily broken, it signifies that the copper is\r\nperfectly melted; he places the point of the bar on a small iron anvil,\r\nand chips off the thin layer of copper from it with a hammer.[25]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 534 (Copper Refining): A--Pointed bar.

D--Cakes of copper made by separating them with the\r\nwedge-shaped bar. E--Tongs. F--Tub.]\r\n\r\nIf the copper is not good, the master draws off the \"slags\" twice, or\r\nthree times if necessary--the first time when some of the cakes have\r\nbeen melted, the second when all have melted, the third time when the\r\ncopper has been heated for some time. If the copper was of good quality,\r\nthe \"slags\" are not drawn off before the operation is finished, but at\r\nthe time they are to be drawn off, he depresses the bar over both\r\nbellows, and places over both a stick, a cubit long and a palm wide,\r\nhalf cut away at the upper part, so that it may pass under the iron pin\r\nfixed at the back in the perforated wood. This he does likewise when the\r\ncopper has been completely melted. Then the assistant removes the iron\r\nplate with the tongs; these tongs are four feet three palms long, their\r\njaws are about a foot in length, and their straight part measures two\r\npalms and three digits, and the curved a palm and a digit. The same\r\nassistant, with the iron shovel, throws and heaps up the larger pieces\r\nof charcoal into that part of the hearth which is against the little\r\nwall which protects the other wall from injury by fire, and partly\r\nextinguishes them by pouring water over them. The master, with a hazel\r\nstick inserted into the crucible, stirs it twice. Afterward he draws\r\noff the slags with a rabble, which consists of an iron blade, wide and\r\nsharp, and of alder-wood; the blade is a digit and a half in width and\r\nthree feet long; the wooden handle inserted in its hollow part is the\r\nsame number of feet long, and the alder-wood in which the blade is fixed\r\nmust have the figure of a rhombus; it must be three palms and a digit\r\nlong, a palm and two digits wide, and a palm thick. Subsequently he\r\ntakes a broom and sweeps the charcoal dust and small coal over the whole\r\nof the crucible, lest the copper should cool before it flows together;\r\nthen, with a third rabble, he cuts off the slags which may adhere to the\r\nedge of the crucible. The blade of this rabble is two palms long and a\r\npalm and one digit wide, the iron part of the handle is a foot and three\r\npalms long, the wooden part six feet. Afterward he again draws off the\r\nslags from the crucible, which the assistant does not quench by pouring\r\nwater upon them, as the other slags are usually quenched, but he\r\nsprinkles over them a little water and allows them to cool. If the\r\ncopper should bubble, he presses down the bubbles with the rabble. Then\r\nhe pours water on the wall and the pipes, that it may flow down warm\r\ninto the crucible, for, the copper, if cold water were to be poured over\r\nit while still hot, would spatter about. If a stone, or a piece of lute\r\nor wood, or a damp coal should then fall into it, the crucible would\r\nvomit out all the copper with a loud noise like thunder, and whatever it\r\ntouches it injures and sets on fire. Subsequently he lays a curved board\r\nwith a notch in it over the front part of the crucible; it is two feet\r\nlong, a palm and two digits wide, and a digit thick. Then the copper in\r\nthe crucible should be divided into cakes with an iron wedge-shaped bar;\r\nthis is three feet long, two digits wide, and steeled on the end for the\r\ndistance of two digits, and its wooden handle is three feet long. He\r\nplaces this bar on the notched board, and, driving it into the copper,\r\nmoves it forward and back, and by this means the water flows into the\r\nvacant space in the copper, and he separates the cake from the rest of\r\nthe mass. If the copper is not perfectly smelted the cakes will be too\r\nthick, and cannot be taken out of the crucible easily. Each cake is\r\nafterward seized by the assistant with the tongs and plunged into the\r\nwater in the tub; the first one is placed aside so that the master may\r\nre-melt it again immediately, for, since some \"slags\" adhere to it, it\r\nis not as perfect as the subsequent ones; indeed, if the copper is not\r\nof good quality, he places the first two cakes aside. Then, again\r\npouring water over the wall and the pipes, he separates out the second\r\ncake, which the assistant likewise immerses in water and places on the\r\nground together with the others separated out in the same way, which he\r\npiles upon them. These, if the copper was of good quality, should be\r\nthirteen or more in number; if it was not of good quality, then fewer.\r\nIf the copper was of good quality, this part of the operation, which\r\nindeed is distributed into four parts, is accomplished by the master in\r\ntwo hours; if of mediocre quality, in two and a half hours; if of bad\r\nquality, in three. The \"dried\" cakes are re-melted, first in the first\r\ncrucible and then in the second. The assistant must, as quickly as\r\npossible, quench all the cakes with water, after they have been cut out\r\nof the second crucible. Afterward with the tongs he replaces in its\r\nproper place the iron plate which was in front of the furnace, and\r\nthrows the charcoal back into the crucible with a shovel. Meanwhile the\r\nmaster, continuing his work, removes the wooden stick from the bars of\r\nthe bellows, so that in re-melting the other cakes he may accomplish the\r\nthird part of his process; this must be carefully done, for if a\r\nparticle from any iron implement should by chance fall into the\r\ncrucible, or should be thrown in by any malevolent person, the copper\r\ncould not be made until the iron had been consumed, and therefore double\r\nlabour would have to be expended upon it. Finally, the assistant\r\nextinguishes all the glowing coals, and chips off the dry lute from the\r\nmouth of the copper pipe with a hammer; one end of this hammer is\r\npointed, the other round, and it has a wooden handle five feet long.\r\nBecause there is danger that the copper would be scattered if the\r\n_pompholyx_ and _spodos_, which adhere to the walls and the hood erected\r\nupon them, should fall into the crucible, he cleans them off in the\r\nmeantime. Every week he takes the copper flowers out of the tub, after\r\nhaving poured off the water, for these fall into it from the cakes when\r\nthey are quenched.[26]\r\n\r\nThe bellows which this master uses differ in size from the others, for\r\nthe boards are seven and a half feet long; the back part is three feet\r\nwide; the front, where the head is joined on is a foot, two palms and as\r\nmany digits. The head is a cubit and a digit long; the back part of it\r\nis a cubit and a palm wide, and then becomes gradually narrower. The\r\nnozzles of the bellows are bound together by means of an iron chain,\r\ncontrolled by a thick bar, one end of which penetrates into the ground\r\nagainst the back of the long wall, and the other end passes under the\r\nbeam which is laid upon the foremost perforated beams. These nozzles are\r\nso placed in a copper pipe that they are at a distance of a palm from\r\nthe mouth; the mouth should be made three digits in diameter, that the\r\nair may be violently expelled through this narrow aperture.\r\n\r\nThere now remain the liquation thorns, the ash-coloured copper, the\r\n\"slags,\" and the _cadmia_.[27] Liquation cakes are made from thorns in\r\nthe following manner.[28] There are taken three-quarters of a\r\n_centumpondium_ of thorns, which have their origin from the cakes of\r\ncopper-lead alloy when lead-silver is liquated, and as many parts of a\r\n_centumpondium_ of the thorns derived from cakes made from once\r\nre-melted thorns by the same method, and to them are added a\r\n_centumpondium_ of de-silverized lead and half a _centumpondium_ of\r\nhearth-lead. If there is in the works plenty of litharge, it is\r\nsubstituted for the de-silverized lead. One and a half _centumpondia_ of\r\nlitharge and hearth-lead is added to the same weight of primary thorns,\r\nand half a _centumpondium_ of thorns which have their origin from\r\nliquation cakes composed of thorns twice re-melted by the same method\r\n(tertiary thorns), and a fourth part of a _centumpondium_ of thorns\r\nwhich are produced when the exhausted liquation cakes are \"dried.\" By\r\nboth methods one single liquation cake is made from three\r\n_centumpondia_. In this manner the smelter makes every day fifteen\r\nliquation cakes, more or less; he takes great care that the metallic\r\nsubstances, from which the first liquation cake is made, flow down\r\nproperly and in due order into the forehearth, before the material of\r\nwhich the subsequent cake is to be made. Five of these liquation cakes\r\nare put simultaneously into the furnace in which silver-lead is liquated\r\nfrom copper, they weigh almost fourteen _centumpondia_, and the \"slags\"\r\nmade therefrom usually weigh quite a _centumpondium_. In all the\r\nliquation cakes together there is usually one _libra_ and nearly two\r\n_unciae_ of silver, and in the silver-lead which drips from those cakes,\r\nand weighs seven and a half _centumpondia_, there is in each an _uncia_\r\nand a half of silver. In each of the three _centumpondia_ of liquation\r\nthorns there is almost an _uncia_ of silver, and in the two\r\n_centumpondia_ and a quarter of exhausted liquation cakes there is\r\naltogether one and a half _unciae_; yet this varies greatly for each\r\nvariety of thorns, for in the thorns produced from primary liquation\r\ncakes made of copper and lead when silver-lead is liquated from the\r\ncopper, and those produced in \"drying\" the exhausted liquation cakes,\r\nthere are almost two _unciae_ of silver; in the others not quite an\r\n_uncia_. There are other thorns besides, of which I will speak a little\r\nfurther on.\r\n\r\nThose in the Carpathian Mountains who make liquation cakes from the\r\ncopper \"bottoms\" which remain after the upper part of the copper is\r\ndivided from the lower, in the furnace similar to an oven, produce\r\nthorns when the poor or mediocre silver-lead is liquated from the\r\ncopper. These, together with those made of cakes of re-melted thorns, or\r\nmade with re-melted litharge, are placed in a heap by themselves; but\r\nthose that are made from cakes melted from hearth-lead are placed in a\r\nheap separate from the first, and likewise those produced from \"drying\"\r\nthe exhausted liquation cakes are placed separately; from these thorns\r\nliquation cakes are made. From the first heap they take the fourth part\r\nof a _centumpondium_, from the second the same amount, from the third a\r\n_centumpondium_,--to which thorns are added one and a half\r\n_centumpondia_ of litharge and half a _centumpondium_ of hearth-lead,\r\nand from these, melted in the blast furnace, a liquation cake is made;\r\neach workman makes twenty such cakes every day. But of theirs enough has\r\nbeen said for the present; I will return to ours.\r\n\r\nThe ash-coloured copper[29] which is chipped off, as I have stated, from\r\nthe \"dried\" cakes, used some years ago to be mixed with the thorns\r\nproduced from liquation of the copper-lead alloy, and contained in\r\nthemselves, equally with the first, two _unciae_ of silver; but now it\r\nis mixed with the concentrates washed from the accretions and the other\r\nmaterial. The inhabitants of the Carpathian Mountains melt this kind of\r\ncopper in furnaces in which are re-melted the \"slags\" which flow out\r\nwhen the copper is refined; but as this soon melts and flows down out of\r\nthe furnace, two workmen are required for the work of smelting, one of\r\nwhom smelts, while the other takes out the thick cakes from the\r\nforehearth. These cakes are only \"dried,\" and from the \"dried\" cakes\r\ncopper is again made.\r\n\r\nThe \"slags\"[30] are melted continually day and night, whether they have\r\nbeen drawn off from the alloyed metals with a rabble, or whether they\r\nadhered to the forehearth to the thickness of a digit and made it\r\nsmaller and were taken off with spatulas. In this manner two or three\r\nliquation cakes are made, and afterward much or little of the \"slag,\"\r\nskimmed from the molten alloy of copper and lead, is re-melted. Such\r\nliquation cakes should weigh up to three _centumpondia_, in each of\r\nwhich there is half an _uncia_ of silver. Five cakes are placed at the\r\nsame time in the furnace in which argentiferous lead is liquated from\r\ncopper, and from these are made lead which contains half an _uncia_ of\r\nsilver to the _centumpondium_. The exhausted liquation cakes are laid\r\nupon the other baser exhausted liquation cakes, from both of which\r\nyellow copper is made. The base thorns thus obtained are re-melted with\r\na few baser \"slags,\" after having been sprinkled with concentrates from\r\nfurnace accretions and other material, and in this manner six or seven\r\nliquation cakes are made, each of which weighs some two _centumpondia_.\r\nFive of these are placed at the same time in the furnace in which\r\nsilver-lead is liquated from copper; these drip three _centumpondia_ of\r\nlead, each of which contains half an _uncia_ of silver. The basest\r\nthorns thus produced should be re-melted with only a little \"slag.\" The\r\ncopper alloyed with lead, which flows down from the furnace into the\r\nforehearth, is poured out with a ladle into oblong copper moulds; these\r\ncakes are \"dried\" with base exhausted liquation cakes. The thorns they\r\nproduce are added to the base thorns, and they are made into cakes\r\naccording to the method I have described. From the \"dried\" cakes they\r\nmake copper, of which some add a small portion to the best \"dried\" cakes\r\nwhen copper is made from them, in order that by mixing the base copper\r\nwith the good it may be sold without loss. The \"slags,\" if they are\r\nutilisable, are re-melted a second and a third time, the cakes made from\r\nthem are \"dried,\" and from the \"dried\" cakes is made copper, which is\r\nmixed with the good copper. The \"slags,\" drawn off by the master who\r\nmakes copper out of \"dried\" cakes, are sifted, and those which fall\r\nthrough the sieve into a vessel placed underneath are washed; those\r\nwhich remain in it are emptied into a wheelbarrow and wheeled away to\r\nthe blast furnaces, and they are re-melted together with other \"slags,\"\r\nover which are sprinkled the concentrates from washing the slags or\r\nfurnace accretions made at this time. The copper which flows out of the\r\nfurnace into the forehearth, is likewise dipped out with a ladle into\r\noblong copper moulds; in this way nine or ten cakes are made, which are\r\n\"dried,\" together with bad exhausted liquation cakes, and from these\r\n\"dried\" cakes yellow[31] copper is made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 543 (Copper Refining): A--Furnace. B--Forehearth.\r\nC--Oblong moulds.]\r\n\r\nThe _cadmia_,[32] as it is called by us, is made from the \"slags\" which\r\nthe master, who makes copper from \"dried\" cakes, draws off together with\r\nother re-melted base \"slags\"; for, indeed, if the copper cakes made from\r\nsuch \"slags\" are broken, the fragments are called _cadmia_; from this\r\nand yellow copper is made _caldarium_ copper in two ways. For either two\r\nparts of _cadmia_ are mixed with one of yellow copper in the blast\r\nfurnaces, and melted; or, on the contrary, two parts of yellow copper\r\nwith one of _cadmia_, so that the _cadmia_ and yellow copper may be well\r\nmixed; and the copper which flows down from the furnace into the\r\nforehearth is poured out with a ladle into oblong copper moulds heated\r\nbeforehand. These moulds are sprinkled over with charcoal dust before\r\nthe _caldarium_ copper is to be poured into them, and the same dust is\r\nsprinkled over the copper when it is poured in, lest the _cadmia_ and\r\nyellow copper should freeze before they have become well mixed. With a\r\npiece of wood the assistant cleanses each cake from the dust, when it is\r\nturned out of the mould. Then he throws it into the tub containing hot\r\nwater, for the _caldarium_ copper is finer if quenched in hot water. But\r\nas I have so often made mention of the oblong copper moulds, I must now\r\nspeak of them a little; they are a foot and a palm long, the inside is\r\nthree palms and a digit wide at the top, and they are rounded at the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe concentrates are of two kinds--precious and base.[33] The first are\r\nobtained from the accretions of the blast furnace, when liquation cakes\r\nare made from copper and lead, or from precious liquation thorns, or\r\nfrom the better quality \"slags,\" or from the best grade of concentrates,\r\nor from the sweepings and bricks of the furnaces in which exhausted\r\nliquation cakes are \"dried\"; all of these things are crushed and washed,\r\nas I explained in Book VIII. The base concentrates are made from\r\naccretions formed when cakes are cast from base thorns or from the worst\r\nquality of slags. The smelter who makes liquation cakes from the\r\nprecious concentrates, adds to them three wheelbarrowsful of litharge\r\nand four barrowsful of hearth-lead and one of ash-coloured copper, from\r\nall of which nine or ten liquation cakes are melted out, of which five\r\nat a time are placed in the furnace in which silver-lead is liquated\r\nfrom copper; a _centumpondium_ of the lead which drips from these cakes\r\ncontains one _uncia_ of silver. The liquation thorns are placed apart\r\nby themselves, of which one basketful is mixed with the precious thorns\r\nto be re-melted. The exhausted liquation cakes are \"dried\" at the same\r\ntime as other good exhausted liquation cakes.\r\n\r\nThe thorns which are drawn off from the lead, when it is separated from\r\nsilver in the cupellation furnace[34], and the hearth-lead which remains\r\nin the crucible in the middle part of the furnaces, together with the\r\nhearth material which has become defective and has absorbed silver-lead,\r\nare all melted together with a little slag in the blast furnaces. The\r\nlead, or rather the silver-lead, which flows from the furnace into the\r\nforehearth, is poured out into copper moulds such as are used by the\r\nrefiners; a _centumpondium_ of such lead contains four _unciae_ of\r\nsilver, or, if the hearth was defective, it contains more. A small\r\nportion of this material is added to the copper and lead when liquation\r\ncakes are made from them, if more were to be added the alloy would be\r\nmuch richer than it should be, for which reason the wise foreman of the\r\nworks mixes these thorns with other precious thorns. The hearth-lead\r\nwhich remains in the middle of the crucible, and the hearth material\r\nwhich absorbs silver-lead, is mixed with other hearth-lead which remains\r\nin the cupellation furnace crucible; and yet some cakes, made rich in\r\nthis manner, may be placed again in the cupellation furnaces, together\r\nwith the rest of the silver-lead cakes which the refiner has made.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Carpathian Mountains, if they have an abundance\r\nof finely crushed copper[35] or lead either made from \"slags,\" or\r\ncollected from the furnace in which the exhausted liquation cakes are\r\ndried, or litharge, alloy them in various ways. The \"first\" alloy\r\nconsists of two _centumpondia_ of lead melted out of thorns, litharge,\r\nand thorns made from hearth-lead, and of half a _centumpondium_ each of\r\nlead collected in the furnace in which exhausted liquation cakes are\r\n\"dried,\" and of copper _minutum_, and from these are made liquation\r\ncakes; the task of the smelter is finished when he has made forty\r\nliquation cakes of this kind. The \"second\" alloy consists of two\r\n_centumpondia_ of litharge, of one and a quarter _centumpondia_ of\r\nde-silverized lead or lead from \"slags,\" and of half a _centumpondium_\r\nof lead made from thorns, and of as much copper _minutum_. The \"third\"\r\nalloy consists of three _centumpondia_ of litharge and of half a\r\n_centumpondium_ each of de-silverized lead, of lead made from thorns,\r\nand of copper _minutum contusum_. Liquation cakes are made from all\r\nthese alloys; the task of the smelters is finished when they have made\r\nthirty cakes.\r\n\r\nThe process by which cakes are made among the Tyrolese, from which they\r\nseparate the silver-lead, I have explained in Book IX.\r\n\r\nSilver is separated from iron in the following manner. Equal portions of\r\niron scales and filings and of _stibium_ are thrown into an earthenware\r\ncrucible which, when covered with a lid and sealed, is placed in a\r\nfurnace, into which air is blown. When this has melted and again cooled,\r\nthe crucible is broken; the button that settles in the bottom of it,\r\nwhen taken out, is pounded to powder, and the same weight of lead being\r\nadded, is mixed and melted in a second crucible; at last this button is\r\nplaced in a cupel and the lead is separated from the silver.[36]\r\n\r\nThere are a great variety of methods by which one metal is separated\r\nfrom other metals, and the manner in which the same are alloyed I have\r\nexplained partly in the eighth book of _De Natura Fossilium_, and partly\r\nI will explain elsewhere. Now I will proceed to the remainder of my\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The whole of this Book is devoted to the subject of the separation\r\nof silver from copper by liquation, except pages 530-9 on copper\r\nrefining, and page 544 on the separation of silver from iron. We believe\r\na brief outline of the liquation process here will refresh the mind of\r\nthe reader, and enable him to peruse the Book with more satisfaction.\r\nThe fundamental principle of the process is that if a copper-lead alloy,\r\ncontaining a large excess of lead, be heated in a reducing atmosphere,\r\nabove the melting point of lead but below that of copper, the lead will\r\nliquate out and carry with it a large proportion of the silver. As the\r\nresults are imperfect, the process cannot be carried through in one\r\noperation, and a large amount of bye-products is created which must be\r\nworked up subsequently. The process, as here described, falls into six\r\nstages. 1st, Melting the copper and lead in a blast furnace to form\r\n\"liquation cakes\"--that is, the \"leading.\" If the copper contain too\r\nlittle silver to warrant liquation directly, then the copper is\r\npreviously enriched by melting and drawing off from a settling pot the\r\nless argentiferous \"tops\" from the metal, liquation cakes being made\r\nfrom the enriched \"bottoms.\" 2nd, Liquation of the argentiferous lead\r\nfrom the copper. This work was carried out in a special furnace, to\r\nwhich the admission of air was prevented as much as possible in order to\r\nprevent oxidation. 3rd, \"Drying\" the residual copper, which retained\r\nsome lead, in a furnace with a free admission of air. The temperature\r\nwas raised to a higher degree than in the liquation furnace, and the\r\nexpelled lead was oxidized. 4th, Cupellation of the argentiferous lead.\r\n5th, Refining of the residual copper from the \"drying\" furnace by\r\noxidation of impurities and poling in a \"refining furnace.\" 6th,\r\nRe-alloy and re-liquation of the bye-products. These consist of: _a_,\r\n\"slags\" from \"leading\"; _b_, \"slags\" from \"drying\"; _c_, \"slags\" from\r\nrefining of the copper. All of these \"slags\" were mainly lead oxides,\r\ncontaining some cuprous oxides and silica from the furnace linings; _d_,\r\n\"thorns\" from liquation; _e_, \"thorns\" from \"drying\"; _f_, \"thorns\" from\r\nskimmings during cupellation; these were again largely lead oxides, but\r\ncontained rather more copper and less silica than the \"slags\"; _g_,\r\n\"ash-coloured copper,\" being scales from the \"dried\" copper, were\r\ncuprous oxides, containing considerable lead oxides; _h_, concentrates\r\nfrom furnace accretions, crushed bricks, &c.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of detailed features of the process has been reserved to\r\nnotes attached to the actual text, to which the reader is referred. As\r\nto the general result of liquation, Karsten (see below) estimates the\r\nlosses in the liquation of the equivalent of 100 lbs. of argentiferous\r\ncopper to amount to 32-35 lbs. of lead and 5 to 6 lbs. of copper. Percy\r\n(see below) quotes results at Lautenthal in the Upper Harz for the years\r\n1857-60, showing losses of 25% of the silver, 9.1% of the copper, and\r\n36.37 lbs. of lead to the 100 lbs. of copper, or say, 16% of the lead;\r\nand a cost of L8 6s. per ton of copper. The theoretical considerations\r\ninvolved in liquation have not been satisfactorily determined. Those who\r\nmay wish to pursue the subject will find repeated descriptions and much\r\ndiscussion in the following works, which have been freely consulted in\r\nthe notes which follow upon particular features of the process. It may\r\nbe mentioned that Agricola's treatment of the subject is more able than\r\nany down to the 18th century. Ercker (_Beschreibung Allerfuernemsten\r\nMineralischen_, etc., Prague, 1574).

Agricola apparently found no little difficulty\r\nin adapting Latin words to his purpose, but stubbornly adhered to his\r\npractice of using no German at the expense of long explanatory clauses.\r\nThe following table, prepared for convenience in translation, is\r\nreproduced.

His account is very\r\nincomplete, for he describes only the bare liquation, and states that\r\nthe copper is re-melted with lead and re-liquated until the silver is\r\nsufficiently abstracted. He neither mentions \"drying\" nor any of the\r\nbye-products. In his directions the silver-lead alloy was cupelled and\r\nthe copper ultimately refined, obviously by oxidation and poling,\r\nalthough he omits the pole. In A.D. 1150 Theophilus (p. 305, Hendrie's\r\nTrans.) describes melting lead out of copper ore, which would be a form\r\nof liquation so far as separation of these two metals is concerned, but\r\nobviously not a process for separating silver from copper. This passage\r\nis quoted in the note on copper smelting (Note on p. 405). A process of\r\nsuch well-developed and complicated a character must have come from a\r\nperiod long before Agricola; but further than such a surmise, there\r\nappears little to be recorded. Liquation has been during the last fifty\r\nyears displaced by other methods, because it was not only tedious and\r\nexpensive, but the losses of metal were considerable.\r\n\r\n[2] _Paries_,--\"Partition\" or \"wall.\" The author uses this term\r\nthroughout in distinction to _murus_, usually applying the latter to the\r\nwalls of the building and the former to furnace walls, chimney walls,\r\netc. In order to gain clarity, we have introduced the term \"hood\" in\r\ndistinction to \"chimney,\" and so far as possible refer to the _paries_\r\nof these constructions and furnaces as \"side of the furnace,\" \"side of\r\nthe hood,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[4] From this point on, the construction of the roofs, in the absence of\r\nillustration, is hopeless of intelligent translation. The constant\r\nrepetition of \"_tignum_,\" \"_tigillum_,\" \"_trabs_,\" for at least fifteen\r\ndifferent construction members becomes most hopelessly involved,\r\nespecially as the author attempts to distinguish between them in a sort\r\nof \"House-that-Jack-built\" arrangement of explanatory clauses.\r\n\r\n[5] In the original text this is given as the \"fifth,\" a manifest\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\n[6] _Chelae_,--\"claws.\"\r\n\r\n[7] If Roman weights, this would be 5.6 short tons, and 7.5 tons if\r\nGerman _centner_ is meant.\r\n\r\n[8] This is, no doubt, a reference to Pliny's statement (XXXIII, 35)\r\nregarding litharge at Puteoli. This passage from Pliny is given in the\r\nfootnote on p. 466. Puteoli was situated on the Bay of Naples.\r\n\r\n[9] By this expression is apparently meant the \"bottoms\" produced in\r\nenriching copper, as described on p. 510.\r\n\r\n[10] The details of the preparation of liquation cakes--\"leading\"--were\r\nmatters of great concern to the old metallurgists. The size of the\r\ncakes, the proportion of silver in the original copper and in the\r\nliquated lead, the proportion of lead and silver left in the residual\r\ncakes, all had to be reached by a series of compromises among militant\r\nforces. The cakes were generally two and one-half to three and one-half\r\ninches thick and about two feet in diameter, and weighed 225 to 375 lbs.\r\nThis size was wonderfully persistent from Agricola down to modern times;\r\nand was, no doubt, based on sound experience. If the cakes were too\r\nsmall, they required proportionately more fuel and labour; whilst if too\r\nlarge, the copper began to melt before the maximum lead was liquated.\r\nThe ratio of the copper and lead was regulated by the necessity of\r\nenough copper to leave a substantial sponge mass the shape of the\r\noriginal cake, and not so large a proportion as to imprison the lead.\r\nThat is, if the copper be in too small proportion the cakes break down;\r\nand if in too large, then insufficient lead liquates out, and the\r\nextraction of silver decreases. Ercker (p. 106-9) insists on the\r\nequivalent of about 3 copper to 9.5 lead; Lohneys (p. 99), 3 copper to 9\r\nor 10 lead. Schlueter (p. 479, etc.) insists on a ration of 3 copper to\r\nabout 11 lead. Kerl (_Handbuch Der Metallurgischen Huettenkunde_, 1855;\r\nVol. III., p. 116) gives 3 copper to 6 to 7 parts lead. Agricola gives\r\nvariable amounts of 3 parts copper to from 8 to 12 parts lead. As to the\r\nratio of silver in the copper, or to the cakes, there does not, except\r\nthe limit of payability, seem to have been any difficulty on the minimum\r\nside. On the other hand, Ercker, Lohneys, Schlueter, and Karsten all\r\ncontend that if the silver ran above a certain proportion, the copper\r\nwould retain considerable silver. These authors give the outside ratio\r\nof silver permissible for good results in one liquation at what would be\r\nequivalent to 45 to 65 ozs. per ton of cakes, or about 190 to 250 ozs.\r\nper ton on the original copper. It will be seen, however, that\r\nAgricola's cakes greatly exceed these values. A difficulty did arise\r\nwhen the copper ran low in silver, in that the liquated lead was too\r\npoor to cupel, and in such case the lead was used over again, until it\r\nbecame rich enough for this purpose. According to Karsten, copper\r\ncontaining less than an equivalent of 80 to 90 ozs. per ton could not be\r\nliquated profitably, although the Upper Harz copper, according to Kerl,\r\ncontaining the equivalent of about 50 ozs. per ton, was liquated at a\r\nprofit. In such a case the cakes would run only 12 to 14 ozs. per ton.\r\nIt will be noticed that in the eight cases given by Agricola the copper\r\nran from 97 to over 580 ozs. per ton, and in the description of\r\nenrichment of copper \"bottoms\" the original copper runs 85 ozs., and \"it\r\ncannot be separated easily\"; as a result, it is raised to 110 ozs. per\r\nton before treatment. In addition to the following tabulation of the\r\nproportions here given by Agricola, the reader should refer to footnotes\r\n15 and 17, where four more combinations are tabulated. It will be\r\nobserved from this table that with the increasing richness of copper an\r\nincreased proportion of lead was added, so that the products were of\r\nsimilar value. It has been assumed (see footnote 13 p. 509), that Roman\r\nweights are intended. It is not to be expected that metallurgical\r\nresults of this period will \"tie up\" with the exactness of the modern\r\noperator's, and it has not been considered necessary to calculate beyond\r\nthe nearest pennyweight. Where two or more values are given by the\r\nauthor the average has been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        1ST CHARGE.    2ND CHARGE.    3RD CHARGE.    4TH CHARGE.\r\n\r\n  Amount of             211.8 lbs.     211.8 lbs.     211.8 lbs.     211.8 lbs.\r\n   argentiferous copper\r\n\r\n  Amount of lead        564.8  \"       635.4  \"       776.6  \"       847.2  \"\r\n\r\n  Weight of each cake   193.5  \"       211.5  \"       247.1  \"       264.75 \"\r\n\r\n  Average value of        56 ozs.        62 ozs.        64 ozs.        66 ozs.\r\n   charge                   3dwts.         4dwts.         4dwts.         7dwts.\r\n\r\n  Per cent. of copper    27.2%          25%            21.4%          20%\r\n\r\n  Average value of       207 ozs.       251 ozs.       299 ozs.       332 ozs.\r\n   original copper          4dwts.         3dwts.        15dwts.         3dwts.\r\n   per ton\r\n\r\n  Weight of             423.6 lbs.     494.2 lbs.     635.4 lbs.     706 lbs.\r\n   argentiferous lead\r\n   liquated out\r\n\r\n  Average value of        79 ozs.        79 ozs.        79 ozs.        85 ozs.\r\n   liquated lead\r\n   per ton\r\n\r\n  Weight of residues    353 lbs.       353 lbs.       353 lbs.       353 lbs.\r\n   (residual copper\r\n    and thorns)\r\n\r\n  Average value of        34 ozs.        34 ozs.        34 ozs.      34 ozs. to\r\n   residues per ton                                                    38 ozs.\r\n\r\n  Extraction of          76.5%          73.4%          79%            85.3%\r\n   silver into the\r\n   argentiferous lead\r\n\r\n[11] See p. 356.\r\n\r\n[12] An analysis of this \"slag\" by Karsten (_Archiv_. 1st Series IX, p.\r\n24) showed 63.2% lead oxide, 5.1% cuprous oxide, 20.1% silica (from the\r\nfuel and furnace linings), together with some iron alumina, etc. The\r\n_pompholyx_ and _spodos_ were largely zinc oxide (see note, p. 394).\r\n\r\n[13] This description of a _centumpondium_ which weighed either 133-1/3\r\n_librae_, or 146-3/4 _librae_, adds confusion to an already much mixed\r\nsubject (see Appendix C.). Assuming the German _pfundt_ to weigh 7,219\r\ntroy grains, and the Roman _libra_ 4,946 grains, then a _centner_ would\r\nweigh 145.95 _librae_, which checks up fairly well with the second case;\r\nbut under what circumstances a _centner_ can weigh 133-1/3 _librae_ we\r\nare unable to record. At first sight it might appear from this statement\r\nthat where Agricola uses the word _centumpondium_ he means the German\r\n_centner_. On the other hand, in the previous five or six pages the\r\nexpressions one-third, five-sixths, ten-twelfths of a _libra_ are used,\r\nwhich are even divisions of the Roman 12 _unciae_ to one _libra_, and\r\nare used where they manifestly mean divisions of 12 units. If Agricola\r\nhad in mind the German scale, and were using the _libra_ for a _pfundt_\r\nof 16 _untzen_, these divisions would amount to fractions, and would not\r\ntotal the _sicilicus_ and _drachma_ quantities given, nor would they\r\ntotal any of the possibly synonymous divisions of the German _untzen_\r\n(see also page 254).\r\n\r\n[14] If we assume Roman weights, the charge in the first case can be\r\ntabulated as follows, and for convenience will be called the fifth\r\ncharge:--\r\n\r\n                                                    5TH CHARGE (3 cakes).\r\n  Amount of copper                                  211.8 lbs.\r\n  Amount of lead                                    635.4 lbs.\r\n  Weight of each cake                               282.4 lbs.\r\n  Average value of charge                           218 ozs. 18 dwts.\r\n  Per cent. of copper                               25%\r\n  Average value of original copper per ton          583 ozs. 6 dwts. 16 grs.\r\n  Weight of argentiferous lead liquated out         494.2 lbs.\r\n  Average value of liquated lead per ton            352 ozs. 8 dwts.\r\n  Weight of residues                                353 lbs.\r\n  Average value of residues per ton                 20 ozs. (about).\r\n  Extraction of silver into the argentiferous lead  94%\r\n\r\nThe results given in the second case where the copper contains 2\r\n_librae_ and a _bes_ per _centumpondium_ do not tie together at all, for\r\neach liquation cake should contain 3 _librae_ 9-1/2 _unciae_, instead of\r\n1-1/2 _librae_ and 1/2 _uncia_ of silver.\r\n\r\n[15] In this enrichment of copper by the \"settling\" of the silver in the\r\nmolten mass the original copper ran, in the two cases given, 60 ozs. 15\r\ndwts. and 85 ozs. 1 dwt. per ton. The whole charge weighed 2,685 lbs.,\r\nand contained in the second case 114 ozs. Troy, omitting fractions. On\r\nmelting, 1,060 lbs. were drawn off as \"tops,\" containing 24 ozs. of\r\nsilver, or running 45 ozs. per ton, and there remained 1,625 lbs. of\r\n\"bottoms,\" containing 90 ozs. of silver, or averaging 110 ozs. per ton.\r\nIt will be noticed later on in the description of making liquation cakes\r\nfrom these copper bottoms, that the author alters the value from\r\none-third _librae_, a _semi-uncia_ and a _drachma_ per _centumpondium_\r\nto one-third of a _libra_, _i.e._, from 110 ozs. to 97 ozs. 4 dwts. per\r\nton. In the Glossary this furnace is described as a _spleisofen_,\r\n_i.e._, a refining hearth.\r\n\r\n[16] The latter part of this paragraph presents great difficulties. The\r\nterm \"refining furnace\" is given in the Latin as the \"second furnace,\"\r\nan expression usually applied to the cupellation furnace. The whole\r\nquestion of refining is exhaustively discussed on pages 530 to 539.\r\nExactly what material is meant by the term red (_rubrum_), yellow\r\n(_fulvum_) and _caldarium_ copper is somewhat uncertain. They are given\r\nin the German text simply as _rot_, _geel_, and _lebeter kupfer_, and\r\napparently all were \"coarse\" copper of different characters destined for\r\nthe refinery. The author states in _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 334):\r\n\"Copper has a red colour peculiar to itself; this colour in smelted\r\ncopper is considered the most excellent. It, however, varies. In some it\r\nis red, as in the copper smelted at Neusohl.... Other copper is prepared\r\nin the smelters where silver is separated from copper, which is called\r\nyellow copper (_luteum_), and is _regulare_. In the same place a dark\r\nyellow copper is made which is called _caldarium_, taking its name among\r\nthe Germans from a caldron.... _Regulare_ differs from _caldarium_ in\r\nthat the former is not only fusible, but also malleable; while the\r\nlatter is, indeed, fusible, but is not ductile, for it breaks when\r\nstruck with the hammer.\" Later on in _De Re Metallica_ (p. 542) he\r\ndescribes yellow copper as made from \"baser\" liquation thorns and from\r\nexhausted liquation cakes made from thorns. These products were\r\nnecessarily impure, as they contained, among other things, the\r\nconcentrates from furnace accretions. Therefore, there was ample source\r\nfor zinc, arsenic or other metallics which would lighten the colour.\r\n_Caldarium_ copper is described by Pliny (see note, p. 404), and was, no\r\ndoubt, \"coarse\" copper, and apparently Agricola adopted this term from\r\nthat source, as we have found it used nowhere else. On page 542 the\r\nauthor describes making _caldarium_ copper from a mixture of yellow\r\ncopper and a peculiar _cadmia_, which he describes as the \"slags\" from\r\nrefining copper. These \"slags,\" which are the result of oxidation and\r\npoling, would contain almost any of the metallic impurities of the\r\noriginal ore, antimony, lead, arsenic, zinc, cobalt, etc. Coming from\r\nthese two sources the _caldarium_ must have been, indeed, impure.\r\n\r\n[17] The liquation of these low-grade copper \"bottoms\" required that the\r\nliquated lead should be re-used again to make up fresh liquation cakes,\r\nin order that it might eventually become rich enough to warrant\r\ncupellation. In the following table the \"poor\" silver-lead is designated\r\n(A) the \"medium\" (B) and the \"rich\" (C). The three charges here given\r\nare designated sixth, seventh, and eighth for purposes of reference. It\r\nwill be seen that the data is insufficient to complete the ninth and\r\ntenth. Moreover, while the author gives directions for making four\r\ncakes, he says the charge consists of five, and it has, therefore, been\r\nnecessary to reduce the volume of products given to this basis.\r\n\r\n                        6TH CHARGE.        7TH CHARGE.    8TH CHARGE.\r\n\r\n  Amount of copper      176.5 lbs.         176.5 lbs.     176.5 lbs.\r\n   bottoms\r\n\r\n  Amount of lead        282.4 lbs.         564.8 lbs.       635.4 lbs.\r\n                         (slags)            of (A)           of (B)\r\n\r\n  Amount of             494.2 lbs.         211.8 lbs.       141.2 lbs.

Moreover, it was necessary to\r\npreserve a fairly even temperature. The proportions of copper and lead\r\nin the three liquation products vary considerably, depending upon the\r\nmethod of conducting the process and the original proportions. From the\r\nauthors consulted (see note p. 492) an average would be about as\r\nfollows:--The residual copper--exhausted liquation cakes--ran from 25 to\r\n33% lead; the liquated lead from 2 to 3% copper; and the liquation\r\nthorns, which were largely oxidized, contained about 15% copper oxides,\r\n80% lead oxides, together with impurities, such as antimony, arsenic,\r\netc. The proportions of the various products would obviously depend upon\r\nthe care in conducting the operation; too high temperature and the\r\nadmission of air would increase the copper melted and oxidize more lead,\r\nand thus increase the liquation thorns. There are insufficient data in\r\nAgricola to adduce conclusions as to the actual ratios produced. The\r\nresults given for the 6th charge (note 17, p. 512) would indicate about\r\n30% lead in the residual copper, and would indicate that the original\r\ncharge was divided into about 24% of residual copper, 18% of liquation\r\nthorns, and 57% of liquated lead. This, however, was an unusually large\r\nproportion of liquation thorns, some of the authors giving instances of\r\nas low as 5%.\r\n\r\n[19] The first instance given, of 44 _centumpondia_ (3,109 lbs.) lead\r\nand one _centumpondium_ (70.6 lbs.) copper, would indicate that the\r\nliquated lead contained 2.2% copper. The second, of 46 _centumpondia_\r\n(3,250 lbs.) lead and 1-1/2 _centumpondia_ copper (106 lbs.), would\r\nindicate 3% copper; and in the third, 120 _centumpondia_ (8,478 lbs.)\r\nlead and six copper (424 lbs.) would show 4.76% copper. This charge of\r\n120 _centumpondia_ in the cupellation furnace would normally make more\r\nthan 110 _centumpondia_ of litharge and 30 of hearth-lead, _i.e._,\r\nsaturated furnace bottoms. The copper would be largely found in the\r\nsilver-lead \"which does not melt,\" at the margin of the crucible. These\r\nskimmings are afterward referred to as \"thorns.\" It is difficult to\r\nunderstand what is meant by the expression that the silver which is in\r\nthe copper is mixed with the remaining (_reliquo_) silver. The coppery\r\nskimmings from the cupellation furnace are referred to again in Note 28,\r\np. 539.\r\n\r\n[20] A further amount of lead could be obtained in the first liquation,\r\nbut a higher temperature is necessary, which was more economical to\r\nsecure in the \"drying\" furnace. Therefore, the \"drying\" was really an\r\nextension of liquation; but as air was admitted the lead and copper\r\nmelted out were oxidized. The products were the final residual copper,\r\ncalled by Agricola the \"dried\" copper, together with lead and copper\r\noxides, called by him the \"slags,\" and the scale of copper and lead\r\noxides termed by him the \"ash-coloured copper.\" The German metallurgists\r\ndistinguished two kinds of slag: the first and principal one, the\r\n_darrost_, and the second the _darrsoehle_, this latter differing only in\r\nthat it contained more impurities from the floor of the furnace, and\r\nremained behind until the furnace cooled. Agricola possibly refers to\r\nthese as \"more liquation thorns,\" because in describing the treatment of\r\nthe bye-products he refers to thorns from the process, whereas in the\r\ndescription of \"drying\" he usually refers to \"slags.\" A number of\r\nanalyses of these products, given by Karsten, show the \"dried\" copper to\r\ncontain from 82.7 to 90.6% copper, and from 9.4 to 17.3% lead; the\r\n\"slag\" to contain 76.5 to 85.1% lead oxide, and from 4.1 to 7.8% cuprous\r\noxide, with 9 to 13% silica from the furnace bottoms, together with some\r\nother impurities; the \"ash-coloured copper\" to contain about 60% cuprous\r\noxide and 30% lead oxide, with some metallic copper and minor\r\nimpurities. An average of proportions given by various authors shows,\r\nroughly, that out of 100 _centners_ of \"exhausted\" liquation cakes,\r\ncontaining about 70% copper and 30% lead, there were about 63 _centners_\r\nof \"dried\" copper, 38 _centners_ of \"slag,\" and 6-1/2 _centners_ of\r\n\"ash-coloured copper.\" According to Karsten, the process fell into\r\nstages; first, at low temperature some metallic lead appeared; second,\r\nduring an increasing temperature for over 14 to 15 hours the slags ran\r\nout; third, there was a period of four hours of lower temperature to\r\nallow time for the lead to diffuse from the interior of the cakes; and\r\nfourth, during a period of eight hours the temperature was again\r\nincreased. In fact, the latter portion of the process ended with the\r\neconomic limit between leaving some lead in the copper and driving too\r\nmuch copper into the \"slags.\" Agricola gives the silver contents of the\r\n\"dried\" copper as 3 _drachmae_ to 1 _centumpondium_, or equal to about 9\r\nozs. per ton; and assuming that the copper finally recovered from the\r\nbye-products ran no higher, then the first four charges (see note on p.\r\n506) would show a reduction in the silver values of from 95 to 97%; the\r\n7th and 8th charges (note on p. 512) of about 90%.\r\n\r\n[21] If Roman weights, this would equal from 6,360 lbs. to 7,066 lbs.\r\n\r\n[22] One half _uncia_, or three _drachmae_ of silver would equal either\r\n12 ozs. or 9 ozs. per ton. If we assume the values given for residual\r\ncopper in the first four charges (note p. 506) of 34 ozs., this would\r\nmean an extraction of, roughly, 65% of the silver from the exhausted\r\nliquation cakes.\r\n\r\n[23] See note 29, p. 540.\r\n\r\n[24]\r\n\r\n  Assuming Roman weights: 2     _centumpondia_ = 141.3 lbs.\r\n                          2-1/2        \"       = 176.6  \"\r\n                          3            \"       = 211.9  \"\r\n                          3-1/2        \"       = 248.2  \"\r\n                          6            \"       = 423.9  \"\r\n\r\n[25] This description of refining copper in an open hearth by oxidation\r\nwith a blast and \"poling\"--the _gaarmachen_ of the Germans--is so\r\naccurate, and the process is so little changed in some parts of Saxony,\r\nthat it might have been written in the 20th century instead of the 16th.\r\nThe best account of the old practice in Saxony after Agricola is to be\r\nfound in Schlueter's _Huette Werken_ (Braunschweig, 1738, Chap. CXVIII.).\r\nThe process has largely been displaced by electrolytic methods, but is\r\nstill in use in most refineries as a step in electrolytic work. It may\r\nbe unnecessary to repeat that the process is one of subjecting the\r\nmolten mass of impure metal to a strong and continuous blast, and as a\r\nresult, not only are the impurities to a considerable extent directly\r\noxidized and taken off as a slag, but also a considerable amount of\r\ncopper is turned into cuprous oxide. This cuprous oxide mostly melts and\r\ndiffuses through the metallic copper, and readily parting with its\r\noxygen to the impurities further facilitates their complete oxidation.\r\nThe blast is continued until the impurities are practically eliminated,\r\nand at this stage the molten metal contains a great deal of dissolved\r\ncuprous oxide, which must be reduced. This is done by introducing a\r\nbillet of green wood (\"poling\"), the dry distillation of which generates\r\nlarge quantities of gases, which reduce the oxide. The state of the\r\nmetal is even to-day in some localities tested by dipping into it the\r\npoint of an iron rod; if it be at the proper state the adhering copper\r\nhas a net-like appearance, should be easily loosened from the rod by\r\ndipping in water, is of a reddish-copper colour and should be quite\r\npliable; if the metal is not yet refined, the sample is thick, smooth,\r\nand detachable with difficulty; if over-refined, it is thick and\r\nbrittle. By allowing water to run on to the surface of the molten metal,\r\nthin cakes are successively formed and taken off. These cakes were the\r\narticle known to commerce over several centuries as \"rosetta copper.\"\r\nThe first few cakes are discarded as containing impurities or slag, and\r\nif the metal be of good quality the cakes are thin and of a red colour.\r\nTheir colour and thinness, therefore, become a criterion of purity. The\r\ncover of charcoal or charcoal dust maintained upon the surface of the\r\nmetal tended to retard oxidation, but prevented volatilization and\r\nhelped to secure the impurities as a slag instead. Karsten (_Archiv._,\r\n1st series, p. 46) gives several analyses of the slag from refining\r\n\"dried\" copper, showing it to contain from 51.7 to 67.4% lead oxide, 6.2\r\nto 19.2% cuprous oxide, and 21.4 to 23.9 silica (from the furnace\r\nbottoms), with minor quantities of iron, antimony, etc. The \"bubbles\"\r\nreferred to by Agricola were apparently the shower of copper globules\r\nwhich takes place upon the evolution of sulphur dioxide, due to the\r\nreaction of the cuprous oxide upon any remaining sulphide of copper when\r\nthe mass begins to cool.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTE.--It is impossible to say how the Ancients refined\r\ncopper, beyond the fact that they often re-smelted it. Such notes as we\r\ncan find are set out in the note on copper smelting (note 42, p. 402).\r\nThe first authentic reference to poling is in Theophilus (1150 to 1200\r\nA.D., Hendrie's translation, p. 313), which shows a very good\r\nunderstanding of this method of refining copper:--\"Of the Purification\r\nof Copper. Take an iron dish of the size you wish, and line it inside\r\nand out with clay strongly beaten and mixed, and it is carefully dried.\r\nThen place it before a forge upon the coals, so that when the bellows\r\nact upon it the wind may issue partly within and partly above it, and\r\nnot below it. And very small coals being placed round it, place the\r\ncopper in it equally, and add over it a heap of coals. When by blowing a\r\nlong time this has become melted, uncover it and cast immediately fine\r\nashes of coals over it, and stir it with a thin and dry piece of wood as\r\nif mixing it, and you will directly see the burnt lead adhere to these\r\nashes like a glue, which being cast out again superpose coals, and\r\nblowing for a long time, as at first, again uncover it, and then do as\r\nyou did before. You do this until at length by cooking it you can\r\nwithdraw the lead entirely. Then pour it over the mould which you have\r\nprepared for this, and you will thus prove if it be pure. Hold it with\r\nthe pincers, glowing as it is, before it has become cold, and strike it\r\nwith a large hammer strongly over the anvil, and if it be broken or\r\nsplit you must liquefy it anew as before. If, however, it should remain\r\nsound, you will cool it in water, and you cook other (copper) in the\r\nsame manner.\" Biringuccio (III, 8) in 1540 describes the process\r\nbriefly, but omits the poling, an essential in the production of\r\nmalleable copper.\r\n\r\n[26] _Pompholyx_ and _spodos_ were impure zinc oxides (see note 26, p.\r\n394).\r\n\r\nThe copper flowers were no doubt cupric oxide. They were used by the\r\nAncients for medicinal purposes. Dioscorides (V, 48) says: \"Of flowers\r\nof copper, which some call the scrapings of old nails, the best is\r\nfriable; it is gold-coloured when rubbed, is like millet in shape and\r\nsize, is moderately bright, and somewhat astringent. It should not be\r\nmixed with copper filings, with which it is often adulterated. But this\r\ndeception is easily detected, for when bitten in the teeth the filings\r\nare malleable. It (the flowers) is made when the copper fused in a\r\nfurnace has run into the receptacle through the spout pertaining to it,\r\nfor then the workmen engaged in this trade cleanse it from dirt and pour\r\nclear water over it in order to cool it; from this sudden condensation\r\nthe copper spits and throws out the aforesaid flowers.\" Pliny (XXXIV,\r\n24) says: \"The flower, too, of copper (_aeris flos_) is used in medicine.\r\nThis is made by fusing copper, and then removing it to another furnace,\r\nwhere the repeated blast makes the metal separate into small scales like\r\nmillet, known as flowers. These scales also fall off when the cakes of\r\nmetal are cooled in water; they become red, too, like the scales of\r\ncopper known as '_lepis_,' by use of which the flowers of copper are\r\nadulterated, it being also sold for it. These are made when hammering\r\nthe nails that are made from the cakes of copper. All these methods are\r\ncarried on in the works of Cyprus; the difference between these\r\nsubstances is that the _squamae_ (copper scales) are detached from\r\nhammering the cakes, while the flower falls off spontaneously.\" Agricola\r\n(_De Nat. Fos._, p. 352) notes that \"flowers of copper (_flos aeris_)\r\nhave the same properties as 'roasted copper.'\"\r\n\r\n[27] It seems scarcely necessary to discuss in detail the complicated\r\n\"flow scheme\" of the various minor bye-products. They are all\r\nre-introduced into the liquation circuit, and thereby are created other\r\nbye-products of the same kind _ad infinitum_. Further notes are given\r\non:--\r\n\r\n  Liquation thorns         Note 28.\r\n  Slags                     \"   30.\r\n  Ash-coloured copper       \"   29.\r\n  Concentrates              \"   33.\r\n  _Cadmia_                  \"   32.\r\n\r\nThere are no data given, either by Agricola or the later authors, which\r\nallow satisfactory calculation of the relative quantities of these\r\nproducts. A rough estimate from the data given in previous notes would\r\nindicate that in one liquation only about 70% of the original copper\r\ncame out as refined copper, and that about 70% of the original lead\r\nwould go to the cupellation furnace, _i.e._, about 30% of the original\r\nmetal sent to the blast furnace would go into the \"thorns,\" \"slags,\" and\r\n\"ash-coloured copper.\" The ultimate losses were very great, as given\r\nbefore (p. 491), they probably amounted to 25% of the silver, 9% copper,\r\nand 16% of the lead.\r\n\r\n[28] There were the following classes of thorns:--\r\n\r\n  1st.  From liquation.\r\n  2nd.  From drying.\r\n  3rd.  From cupellation.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, according to the later authors, they were largely lead\r\noxide, and contained from 5% to 20% cuprous oxide. If a calculation be\r\nmade backward from the products given as the result of the charge\r\ndescribed, it would appear that in this case they must have contained at\r\nleast one-fifth copper. The silver in these liquation cakes would run\r\nabout 24 ozs. per ton, in the liquated lead about 36 ozs. per ton, and\r\nin the liquation thorns 24 ozs. per ton. The extraction into the\r\nliquated lead would be about 80% of the silver.\r\n\r\n[29] The \"ash-coloured copper\" is a cuprous oxide, containing some 3%\r\nlead oxide; and if Agricola means they contained two _unciae_ of silver\r\nto the _centumpondium_, then they ran about 48 ozs. per ton, and would\r\ncontain much more silver than the mass.\r\n\r\n[30] There are three principal \"slags\" mentioned--\r\n\r\n  1st. Slag from \"leading.\"\r\n  2nd. Slag from \"drying.\"\r\n  3rd. Slag from refining the copper.\r\n\r\nFrom the analyses quoted by various authors these ran from 52% to 85%\r\nlead oxide, 5% to 30% cuprous oxide, and considerable silica from the\r\nfurnace bottoms. They were reduced in the main into liquation cakes,\r\nalthough Agricola mentions instances of the metal reduced from \"slags\"\r\nbeing taken directly to the \"drying\" furnace. Such liquation cakes would\r\nrun very low in silver, and at the values given only averaged 12 ozs.\r\nper ton; therefore the liquated lead running the same value as the\r\ncakes, or less than half that of the \"poor\" lead mentioned in Note 17,\r\np. 512, could not have been cupelled directly.\r\n\r\n[31] See Note 16, p. 511, for discussion of yellow and _caldarium_\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\n[32] This _cadmia_ is given in the Glossary and the German translation\r\nas _kobelt_. A discussion of this substance is given in the note on p.\r\n112; and it is sufficient to state here that in Agricola's time the\r\nmetal cobalt was unknown, and the substances designated _cadmia_ and\r\n_cobaltum_ were arsenical-cobalt-zinc minerals. A metal made from \"slag\"\r\nfrom refining, together with \"base\" thorns, would be very impure; for\r\nthe latter, according to the paragraph on concentrates a little later\r\non, would contain the furnace accretions, and would thus be undoubtedly\r\nzincky. It is just possible that the term _kobelt_ was used by the\r\nGerman smelters at this time in the sense of an epithet--\"black devil\"\r\n(see Note 21, p. 214).\r\n\r\n[33] It is somewhat difficult to see exactly the meaning of base\r\n(_vile_) and precious (_preciosum_) in this connection. While \"base\"\r\ncould mean impure, \"precious\" could hardly mean pure, and while\r\n\"precious\" could mean high value in silver, the reverse does not seem\r\nentirely _apropos_. It is possible that \"bad\" and \"good\" would be more\r\nappropriate terms.\r\n\r\n[34] The skimmings from the molten lead in the early stages of\r\ncupellation have been discussed in Note 28, p. 539. They are probably\r\ncalled thorns here because of the large amount of copper in them. The\r\nlead from liquation would contain 2% to 3% of copper, and this would be\r\nlargely recovered in these skimmings, although there would be some\r\ncopper in the furnace bottoms--hearth-lead--and the litharge. These\r\n\"thorns\" are apparently fairly rich, four _unciae_ to the\r\n_centumpondium_ being equivalent to about 97 ozs. per ton, and they are\r\nonly added to low-grade liquation material.\r\n\r\n[35] _Particulis aeris tusi_. Unless this be the fine concentrates from\r\ncrushing the material mentioned, we are unable to explain the\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n[36] This operation would bring down a button of antimony under an iron\r\nmatte, by de-sulphurizing the antimony. It would seem scarcely necessary\r\nto add lead before cupellation. This process is given in an assay\r\nmethod, in the _Probierbuechlein_ (folio 31) 50 years before _De Re\r\nMetallica_: \"How to separate silver from iron: Take that silver which is\r\nin iron _plechen_ (_plachmal_), pulverize it finely, take the same iron\r\nor _plec_ one part, _spiesglasz_ (antimony sulphide) one part, leave\r\nthem to melt in a crucible placed in a closed _windtofen_. When it is\r\nmelted, let it cool, break the crucible, chip off the button that is in\r\nthe bottom, and melt it in a crucible with as much lead. Then break the\r\ncrucible, and seek from the button in the cupel, and you will find what\r\nsilver it contains.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreviously I have dealt with the methods of separating silver from\r\ncopper. There now remains the portion which treats of solidified juices;\r\nand whereas they might be considered as alien to things metallic,\r\nnevertheless, the reasons why they should not be separated from it I\r\nhave explained in the second book.\r\n\r\nSolidified juices are either prepared from waters in which nature or art\r\nhas infused them, or they are produced from the liquid juices\r\nthemselves, or from stony minerals. Sagacious people, at first observing\r\nthe waters of some lakes to be naturally full of juices which thickened\r\non being dried up by the heat of the sun and thus became solidified\r\njuices, drew such waters into other places, or diverted them into\r\nlow-lying places adjoining hills, so that the heat of the sun should\r\nlikewise cause them to condense. Subsequently, because they observed\r\nthat in this wise the solidified juices could be made only in summer,\r\nand then not in all countries, but only in hot and temperate regions in\r\nwhich it seldom rains in summer, they boiled them in vessels over a fire\r\nuntil they began to thicken. In this manner, at all times of the year,\r\nin all regions, even the coldest, solidified juices could be obtained\r\nfrom solutions of such juices, whether made by nature or by art.\r\nAfterward, when they saw juices drip from some roasted stones, they\r\ncooked these in pots in order to obtain solidified juices in this wise\r\nalso. It is worth the trouble to learn the proportions and the methods\r\nby which these are made.\r\n\r\nI will therefore begin with salt, which is made from water either salty\r\nby nature, or by the labour of man, or else from a solution of salt, or\r\nfrom lye, likewise salty. Water which is salty by nature, is condensed\r\nand converted into salt in salt-pits by the heat of the sun, or else by\r\nthe heat of a fire in pans or pots or trenches. That which is made salty\r\nby art, is also condensed by fire and changed into salt. There should be\r\nas many salt-pits dug as the circumstance of the place permits, but\r\nthere should not be more made than can be used, although we ought to\r\nmake as much salt as we can sell. The depth of salt-pits should be\r\nmoderate, and the bottom should be level, so that all the water is\r\nevaporated from the salt by the heat of the sun. The salt-pits should\r\nfirst be encrusted with salt, so that they may not suck up the water.\r\nThe method of pouring or leading sea-water into salt-pits is very old,\r\nand is still in use in many places. The method is not less old, but less\r\ncommon, to pour well-water into salt-pits, as was done in Babylon, for\r\nwhich Pliny is the authority, and in Cappadocia, where they used not\r\nonly well-water, but also spring-water. In all hot countries salt-water\r\nand lake-water are conducted, poured or carried into salt-pits, and,\r\nbeing dried by the heat of the sun, are converted into salt.[1] While\r\nthe salt-water contained in the salt-pits is being heated by the sun, if\r\nthey be flooded with great and frequent showers of rain the evaporation\r\nis hindered. If this happens rarely, the salt acquires a disagreeable[2]\r\nflavour, and in this case the salt-pits have to be filled with other\r\nsweet water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 547 (Salt Pans): A--Sea. B--Pool. C--Gate. D--Trenches.\r\nE--Salt basins. F--Rake. G--Shovel.]\r\n\r\nSalt from sea-water is made in the following manner. Near that part of\r\nthe seashore where there is a quiet pool, and there are wide, level\r\nplains which the inundations of the sea do not overflow, three, four,\r\nfive, or six trenches are dug six feet wide, twelve feet deep, and six\r\nhundred feet long, or longer if the level place extends for a longer\r\ndistance; they are two hundred feet distant from one another; between\r\nthese are three transverse trenches. Then are dug the principal pits, so\r\nthat when the water has been raised from the pool it can flow into the\r\ntrenches, and from thence into the salt-pits, of which there are numbers\r\non the level ground between the trenches. The salt-pits are basins dug\r\nto a moderate depth; these are banked round with the earth which was dug\r\nin sinking them or in cleansing them, so that between the basins, earth\r\nwalls are made a foot high, which retain the water let into them. The\r\ntrenches have openings, through which the first basins receive the\r\nwater; these basins also have openings, through which the water flows\r\nagain from one into the other. There should be a slight fall, so that\r\nthe water may flow from one basin into the other, and can thus be\r\nreplenished. All these things having been done rightly and in order, the\r\ngate is raised that opens the mouth of the pool which contains sea-water\r\nmixed with rain-water or river-water; and thus all of the trenches are\r\nfilled. Then the gates of the first basins are opened, and thus the\r\nremaining basins are filled with the water from the first; when this\r\nsalt-water condenses, all these basins are incrusted, and thus made\r\nclean from earthy matter. Then again the first basins are filled up from\r\nthe nearest trench with the same kind of water, and left until much of\r\nthe thin liquid is converted into vapour by the heat of the sun and\r\ndissipated, and the remainder is considerably thickened. Then their\r\ngates being opened, the water passes into the second basins; and when it\r\nhas remained there for a certain space of time the gates are opened, so\r\nthat it flows into the third basins, where it is all condensed into\r\nsalt. After the salt has been taken out, the basins are filled again and\r\nagain with sea-water. The salt is raked up with wooden rakes and thrown\r\nout with shovels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 549 (Salt Wells): A--Shed. B--Painted signs. C--First\r\nroom. D--Middle room. E--Third room.

Each shed is usually named from some animal or other\r\nthing which is pictured on a tablet nailed to it. The walls of these\r\nsheds are made either from baked earth or from wicker work covered with\r\nthick mud, although some may be made of stones or bricks. When of\r\nbrick they are often sixteen feet high, and if the roof rises\r\ntwenty-four feet high, then the walls which are at the ends must be made\r\nforty feet high, as likewise the interior partition walls. The roof\r\nconsists of large shingles four feet long, one foot wide, and two digits\r\nthick; these are fixed on long narrow planks placed on the rafters,\r\nwhich are joined at the upper end and slope in opposite directions. The\r\nwhole of the under side is plastered one digit thick with straw mixed\r\nwith lute; likewise the roof on the outside is plastered one and a half\r\nfeet thick with straw mixed with lute, in order that the shed should not\r\nrun any risk of fire, and that it should be proof against rain, and be\r\nable to retain the heat necessary for drying the lumps of salt. Each\r\nshed is divided into three parts, in the first of which the firewood and\r\nstraw are placed; in the middle room, separated from the first room by a\r\npartition, is the fireplace on which is placed the caldron. To the right\r\nof the caldron is a tub, into which is emptied the brine brought into\r\nthe shed by the porters; to the left is a bench, on which there is room\r\nto lay thirty pieces of salt. In the third room, which is in the back\r\npart of the house, there is made a pile of clay or ashes eight feet\r\nhigher than the floor, being the same height as the bench. The master\r\nand his assistants, when they carry away the lumps of salt from the\r\ncaldrons, go from the former to the latter. They ascend from the right\r\nside of the caldron, not by steps, but by a slope of earth. At the top\r\nof the end wall are two small windows, and a third is in the roof,\r\nthrough which the smoke escapes. This smoke, emitted from both the back\r\nand the front of the furnace, finds outlet through a hood through which\r\nit makes its way up to the windows; this hood consists of boards\r\nprojecting one beyond the other, which are supported by two small beams\r\nof the roof. Opposite the fireplace the middle partition has an open\r\ndoor eight feet high and four feet wide, through which there is a gentle\r\ndraught which drives the smoke into the last room; the front wall also\r\nhas a door of the same height and width. Both of these doors are large\r\nenough to permit the firewood or straw or the brine to be carried in,\r\nand the lumps of salt to be carried out; these doors must be closed when\r\nthe wind blows, so that the boiling will not be hindered. Indeed, glass\r\npanes which exclude the wind but transmit the light, should be inserted\r\nin the windows in the walls.\r\n\r\nThey construct the greater part of the fireplace of rock-salt and of\r\nclay mixed with salt and moistened with brine, for such walls are\r\ngreatly hardened by the fire. These fireplaces are made eight and a half\r\nfeet long, seven and three quarters feet wide, and, if wood is burned in\r\nthem, nearly four feet high; but if straw is burned in them, they are\r\nsix feet high. An iron rod, about four feet long, is engaged in a hole\r\nin an iron foot, which stands on the base of the middle of the furnace\r\nmouth. This mouth is three feet in width, and has a door which opens\r\ninward; through it they throw in the straw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 551 (Salt Caldron): A--Fireplace. B--Mouth of fireplace.\r\nC--Caldron. D--Posts sunk into the ground. E--Cross-beams. F--Shorter\r\nbars. G--Iron hooks. H--Staples. I--Longer bars. K--Iron rod bent to\r\nsupport the caldron.]\r\n\r\nThe caldrons are rectangular, eight feet long, seven feet wide, and half\r\na foot high, and are made of sheets of iron or lead, three feet long and\r\nof the same width, all but two digits. These plates are not very thick,\r\nso that the water is heated more quickly by the fire, and is boiled\r\naway rapidly. The more salty the water is, the sooner it is condensed\r\ninto salt. To prevent the brine from leaking out at the points where the\r\nmetal plates are fastened with rivets, the caldrons are smeared over\r\nwith a cement made of ox-liver and ox-blood mixed with ashes. On each\r\nside of the middle of the furnace two rectangular posts, three feet\r\nlong, and half a foot thick and wide are set into the ground, so that\r\nthey are distant from each other only one and a half feet. Each of them\r\nrises one and a half feet above the caldron. After the caldron has been\r\nplaced on the walls of the furnace, two beams of the same width and\r\nthickness as the posts, but four feet long, are laid on these posts, and\r\nare mortised in so that they shall not fall. There rest transversely\r\nupon these beams three bars, three feet long, three digits wide, and two\r\ndigits thick, distant from one another one foot. On each of these hang\r\nthree iron hooks, two beyond the beams and one in the middle; these are\r\na foot long, and are hooked at both ends, one hook turning to the right,\r\nthe other to the left. The bottom hook catches in the eye of a staple,\r\nwhose ends are fixed in the bottom of the caldron, and the eye projects\r\nfrom it. There are besides, two longer bars six feet long, one palm\r\nwide, and three digits thick, which pass under the front beam and rest\r\nupon the rear beam. At the rear end of each of the bars there is an iron\r\nhook two feet and three digits long, the lower end of which is bent so\r\nas to support the caldron. The rear end of the caldron does not rest on\r\nthe two rear corners of the fireplace, but is distant from the fireplace\r\ntwo thirds of a foot, so that the flame and smoke can escape; this rear\r\nend of the fireplace is half a foot thick and half a foot higher than\r\nthe caldron. This is also the thickness and height of the wall between\r\nthe caldron and the third room of the shed, to which it is adjacent.\r\nThis back wall is made of clay and ashes, unlike the others which are\r\nmade of rock-salt. The caldron rests on the two front corners and sides\r\nof the fireplace, and is cemented with ashes, so that the flames shall\r\nnot escape. If a dipperful of brine poured into the caldron should flow\r\ninto all the corners, the caldron is rightly set upon the fireplace.\r\n\r\nThe wooden dipper holds ten Roman _sextarii_, and the cask holds eight\r\ndippers full[3]. The brine drawn up from the well is poured into such\r\ncasks and carried by porters, as I have said before, into the shed and\r\npoured into a tub, and in those places where the brine is very strong it\r\nis at once transferred with the dippers into the caldron. That brine\r\nwhich is less strong is thrown into a small tub with a deep ladle, the\r\nspoon and handle of which are hewn out of one piece of wood. In this tub\r\nrock-salt is placed in order that the water should be made more salty,\r\nand it is then run off through a launder which leads into the caldron.\r\nFrom thirty-seven dippersful of brine the master or his deputy, at Halle\r\nin Saxony,[4] makes two cone-shaped pieces of salt. Each master has a\r\nhelper, or in the place of a helper his wife assists him in his work,\r\nand, in addition, a youth who throws wood or straw under the caldron.\r\nHe, on account of the great heat of the workshop, wears a straw cap on\r\nhis head and a breech cloth, being otherwise quite naked. As soon as the\r\nmaster has poured the first dipperful of brine into the caldron the\r\nyouth sets fire to the wood and straw laid under it. If the firewood is\r\nbundles of faggots or brushwood, the salt will be white, but if straw is\r\nburned, then it is not infrequently blackish, for the sparks, which are\r\ndrawn up with the smoke into the hood, fall down again into the water\r\nand colour it black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 553 (Salt Caldron): A--Wooden dipper.

O--Bucket containing the blood.\r\nP--Tankard which contains beer.]\r\n\r\nIn order to accelerate the condensation of the brine, when the master\r\nhas poured in two casks and as many dippersful of brine, he adds about a\r\nRoman _cyathus_ and a half of bullock's blood, or of calf's blood, or\r\nbuck's blood, or else he mixes it into the nineteenth dipperful of\r\nbrine, in order that it may be dissolved and distributed into all the\r\ncorners of the caldron; in other places the blood is dissolved in beer.\r\nWhen the boiling water seems to be mixed with scum, he skims it with a\r\nladle; this scum, if he be working with rock-salt, he throws into the\r\nopening in the furnace through which the smoke escapes, and it is dried\r\ninto rock-salt; if it be not from rock-salt, he pours it on to the floor\r\nof the workshop. From the beginning to the boiling and skimming is the\r\nwork of half-an-hour; after this it boils down for another\r\nquarter-of-an-hour, after which time it begins to condense into salt.\r\nWhen it begins to thicken with the heat, he and his helper stir it\r\nassiduously with a wooden spatula, and then he allows it to boil for an\r\nhour. After this he pours in a _cyathus_ and a half of beer. In order\r\nthat the wind should not blow into the caldron, the helper covers the\r\nfront with a board seven and a half feet long and one foot high, and\r\ncovers each of the sides with boards three and three quarters feet long.\r\nIn order that the front board may hold more firmly, it is fitted into\r\nthe caldron itself, and the side-boards are fixed on the front board and\r\nupon the transverse beam. Afterward, when the boards have been lifted\r\noff, the helper places two baskets, two feet high and as many wide at\r\nthe top, and a palm wide at the bottom, on the transverse beams, and\r\ninto them the master throws the salt with a shovel, taking half-an-hour\r\nto fill them. Then, replacing the boards on the caldron, he allows the\r\nbrine to boil for three quarters of an hour. Afterward the salt has\r\nagain to be removed with a shovel, and when the baskets are full, they\r\npile up the salt in heaps.\r\n\r\nIn different localities the salt is moulded into different shapes. In\r\nthe baskets the salt assumes the form of a cone; it is not moulded in\r\nbaskets alone, but also in moulds into which they throw the salt, which\r\nare made in the likeness of many objects, as for instance tablets.\r\nThese tablets and cones are kept in the higher part of the third room of\r\nthe house, or else on the flat bench of the same height, in order that\r\nthey may dry better in the warm air. In the manner I have described, a\r\nmaster and his helper continue one after the other, alternately boiling\r\nthe brine and moulding the salt, day and night, with the exception only\r\nof the annual feast days. No caldron is able to stand the fire for more\r\nthan half a year. The master pours in water and washes it out every\r\nweek; when it is washed out he puts straw under it and pounds it; new\r\ncaldrons he washes three times in the first two weeks, and afterward\r\ntwice. In this manner the incrustations fall from the bottom; if they\r\nare not cleared off, the salt would have to be made more slowly over a\r\nfiercer fire, which requires more brine and burns the plates of the\r\ncaldron. If any cracks make their appearance in the caldron they are\r\nfilled up with cement. The salt made during the first two weeks is not\r\nso good, being usually stained by the rust at the bottom where\r\nincrustations have not yet adhered.\r\n\r\nAlthough salt made in this manner is prepared only from the brine of\r\nsprings and wells, yet it is also possible to use this method in the\r\ncase of river-, lake-, and sea-water, and also of those waters which are\r\nartificially salted. For in places where rock-salt is dug, the impure\r\nand the broken pieces are thrown into fresh water, which, when boiled,\r\ncondenses into salt. Some, indeed, boil sea-salt in fresh water again,\r\nand mould the salt into the little cones and other shapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 554 (Salt Boiling): A--Pool. B--Pots. C--Ladle. D--Pans.\r\nE--Tongs.]\r\n\r\nSome people make salt by another method, from salt water which flows\r\nfrom hot springs that issue boiling from the earth. They set earthenware\r\npots in a pool of the spring-water, and into them they pour water\r\nscooped up with ladles from the hot spring until they are half full. The\r\nperpetual heat of the waters of the pool evaporates the salt water just\r\nas the heat of the fire does in the caldrons. As soon as it begins to\r\nthicken, which happens when it has been reduced by boiling to a third or\r\nmore, they seize the pots with tongs and pour the contents into small\r\nrectangular iron pans, which have also been placed in the pool. The\r\ninterior of these pans is usually three feet long, two feet wide, and\r\nthree digits deep, and they stand on four heavy legs, so that the water\r\nflows freely all round, but not into them. Since the water flows\r\ncontinuously from the pool through the little canals, and the spring\r\nalways provides a new and copious supply, always boiling hot, it\r\ncondenses the thickened water poured into the pans into salt; this is at\r\nonce taken out with shovels, and then the work begins all over again. If\r\nthe salty water contains other juices, as is usually the case with hot\r\nsprings, no salt should be made from them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 555 (Salt Boiling): A--Pots. B--Tripod. C--Deep ladle.]\r\n\r\nOthers boil salt water, and especially sea-water, in large iron pots;\r\nthis salt is blackish, for in most cases they burn straw under them.\r\nSome people boil in these pots the brine in which fish is pickled. The\r\nsalt which they make tastes and smells of fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 556 (Salt evaporated on faggots): A--Trench. B--Vat into\r\nwhich the salt water flows. C--Ladle. D--Small bucket with pole fastened\r\ninto it.]\r\n\r\nThose who make salt by pouring brine over firewood, lay the wood in\r\ntrenches which are twelve feet long, seven feet wide, and two and one\r\nhalf feet deep, so that the water poured in should not flow out. These\r\ntrenches are constructed of rock-salt wherever it is to be had, in order\r\nthat they should not soak up the water, and so that the earth should not\r\nfall in on the front, back and sides. As the charcoal is turned into\r\nsalt at the same time as the salt liquor, the Spaniards think, as\r\nPliny writes[5], that the wood itself turns into salt. Oak is the best\r\nwood, as its pure ash yields salt; elsewhere hazel-wood is lauded. But\r\nwith whatever wood it be made, this salt is not greatly appreciated,\r\nbeing black and not quite pure; on that account this method of\r\nsalt-making is disdained by the Germans and Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 557 (Lye Making): A--Large vat. B--Plug. C--Small tub.\r\nD--Deep ladle. E--Small vat. F--Caldron.]\r\n\r\nThe solutions from which salt is made are prepared from salty earth or\r\nfrom earth rich in salt and saltpetre. Lye is made from the ashes of\r\nreeds and rushes. The solution obtained from salty earth by boiling,\r\nmakes salt only; from the other, of which I will speak more a little\r\nlater, salt and saltpetre are made; and from ashes is derived lye, from\r\nwhich its own salt is obtained. The ashes, as well as the earth, should\r\nfirst be put into a large vat; then fresh water should be poured over\r\nthe ashes or earth, and it should be stirred for about twelve hours with\r\na stick, so that it may dissolve the salt. Then the plug is pulled out\r\nof the large vat; the solution of salt or the lye is drained into a\r\nsmall tub and emptied with ladles into small vats; finally, such a\r\nsolution is transferred into iron or lead caldrons and boiled, until the\r\nwater having evaporated, the juices are condensed into salt. The above\r\nare the various methods for making salt. (Illustration p. 557.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration 559 (Nitrum-pits): A--Nile. B--Nitrum-pits, such as I\r\nconjecture them to be.[7]]\r\n\r\n_Nitrum_[6] is usually made from _nitrous_ waters, or from solutions or\r\nfrom lye. In the same manner as sea-water or salt-water is poured into\r\nsalt-pits and evaporated by the heat of the sun and changed into salt,\r\nso the _nitrous_ Nile is led into _nitrum_ pits and evaporated by the\r\nheat of the sun and converted into _nitrum_. Just as the sea, in\r\nflowing of its own will over the soil of this same Egypt, is changed\r\ninto salt, so also the Nile, when it overflows in the dog days, is\r\nconverted into _nitrum_ when it flows into the _nitrum_ pits. The\r\nsolution from which _nitrum_ is produced is obtained from fresh water\r\npercolating through _nitrous_ earth, in the same manner as lye is made\r\nfrom fresh water percolating through ashes of oak or hard oak. Both\r\nsolutions are taken out of vats and poured into rectangular copper\r\ncaldrons, and are boiled until at last they condense into _nitrum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 561 (Soda Making): A--Vat in which the soda is mixed.\r\nB--Caldron. C--Tub in which _chrysocolla_ is condensed. D--Copper wires.\r\nE--Mortar.]\r\n\r\nNative as well as manufactured _nitrum_ is mixed in vats with urine and\r\nboiled in the same caldrons; the decoction is poured into vats in which\r\nare copper wires, and, adhering to them, it hardens and becomes\r\n_chrysocolla_, which the Moors call _borax_. Formerly _nitrum_ was\r\ncompounded with Cyprian verdigris, and ground with Cyprian copper in\r\nCyprian mortars, as Pliny writes. Some _chrysocolla_ is made of\r\nrock-alum and sal-ammoniac.[8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 563 (Saltpetre Making): A--Caldron. B--Large vat into\r\nwhich sand is thrown. C--Plug. D--Tub. E--Vat containing the rods.]\r\n\r\nSaltpetre[9] is made from a dry, slightly fatty earth, which, if it be\r\nretained for a while in the mouth, has an acrid and salty taste. This\r\nearth, together with a powder, are alternately put into a vat in layers\r\na palm deep. The powder consists of two parts of unslaked lime and three\r\nparts of ashes of oak, or holmoak, or Italian oak, or Turkey oak, or of\r\nsome similar kind. Each vat is filled with alternate layers of these to\r\nwithin three-quarters of a foot of the top, and then water is poured in\r\nuntil it is full. As the water percolates through the material it\r\ndissolves the saltpetre; then, the plug being pulled out from the vat,\r\nthe solution is drained into a tub and ladled out into small vats. If\r\nwhen tested it tastes very salty, and at the same time acrid, it is\r\ngood; but, if not, then it is condemned, and it must be made to\r\npercolate again through the same material or through a fresh lot. Even\r\ntwo or three waters may be made to percolate through the same earth and\r\nbecome full of saltpetre, but the solutions thus obtained must not be\r\nmixed together unless all have the same taste, which rarely or never\r\nhappens. The first of these solutions is poured into the first vat, the\r\nnext into the second, the third into the third vat; the second and third\r\nsolutions are used instead of plain water to percolate through fresh\r\nmaterial; the first solution is made in this manner from both the second\r\nand third. As soon as there is an abundance of this solution it is\r\npoured into the rectangular copper caldron and evaporated to one half by\r\nboiling; then it is transferred into a vat covered with a lid, in which\r\nthe earthy matter settles to the bottom. When the solution is clear it\r\nis poured back into the same pan, or into another, and re-boiled. When\r\nit bubbles and forms a scum, in order that it should not run over and\r\nthat it may be greatly purified, there is poured into it three or four\r\npounds of lye, made from three parts of oak or similar ash and one of\r\nunslaked lime. But in the water, prior to its being poured in, is\r\ndissolved rock-alum, in the proportion of one hundred and twenty\r\n_librae_ of the former to five _librae_ of the latter. Shortly\r\nafterward the solution will be found to be clear and blue. It is boiled\r\nuntil the waters, which are easily volatile (_subtiles_), are\r\nevaporated, and then the greater part of the salt, after it has settled\r\nat the bottom of the pan, is taken out with iron ladles. Then the\r\nconcentrated solution is transferred to the vat in which rods are placed\r\nhorizontally and vertically, to which it adheres when cold, and if there\r\nbe much, it is condensed in three or four days into saltpetre. Then the\r\nsolution which has not congealed, is poured out and put on one side or\r\nre-boiled. The saltpetre being cut out and washed with its own solution,\r\nis thrown on to boards that it may drain and dry. The yield of saltpetre\r\nwill be much or little in proportion to whether the solution has\r\nabsorbed much or little; when the saltpetre has been obtained from lye,\r\nwhich purifies itself, it is somewhat clear and pure.\r\n\r\nThe purest and most transparent, because free from salt, is made if it\r\nis drawn off at the thickening stage, according to the following method.\r\nThere are poured into the caldron the same number of _amphorae_ of the\r\nsolution as of _congii_ of the lye of which I have already spoken, and\r\ninto the same caldron is thrown as much of the already made saltpetre as\r\nthe solution and lye will dissolve. As soon as the mixture effervesces\r\nand forms scum, it is transferred to a vat, into which on a cloth has\r\nbeen thrown washed sand obtained from a river. Soon afterward the plug\r\nis drawn out of the hole at the bottom, and the mixture, having\r\npercolated through the sand, escapes into a tub. It is then reduced by\r\nboiling in one or another of the caldrons, until the greater part of the\r\nsolution has evaporated; but as soon as it is well boiled and forms\r\nscum, a little lye is poured into it. Then it is transferred to another\r\nvat in which there are small rods, to which it adheres and congeals in\r\ntwo days if there is but little of it, or if there is much in three\r\ndays, or at the most in four days; if it does not condense, it is poured\r\nback into the caldron and re-boiled down to half; then it is transferred\r\nto the vat to cool. The process must be repeated as often as is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nOthers refine saltpetre by another method, for with it they fill a pot\r\nmade of copper, and, covering it with a copper lid, set it over live\r\ncoals, where it is heated until it melts. They do not cement down the\r\nlid, but it has a handle, and can be lifted for them to see whether or\r\nnot the melting has taken place. When it has melted, powdered sulphur is\r\nsprinkled in, and if the pot set on the fire does not light it, the\r\nsulphur kindles, whereby the thick, greasy matter floating on the\r\nsaltpetre burns up, and when it is consumed the saltpetre is pure. Soon\r\nafterward the pot is removed from the fire, and later, when cold, the\r\npurest saltpetre is taken out, which has the appearance of white marble,\r\nthe earthy residue then remains at the bottom. The earths from which the\r\nsolution was made, together with branches of oak or similar trees, are\r\nexposed under the open sky and sprinkled with water containing\r\nsaltpetre. After remaining thus for five or six years, they are again\r\nready to be made into a solution.\r\n\r\nPure saltpetre which has rested many years in the earth, and that which\r\nexudes from the stone walls of wine cellars and dark places, is mixed\r\nwith the first solution and evaporated by boiling.\r\n\r\nThus far I have described the methods of making _nitrum_, which are not\r\nless varied or multifarious than those for making salt. Now I propose to\r\ndescribe the methods of making alum,[10] which are likewise neither all\r\nalike, nor simple, because it is made from boiling aluminous water until\r\nit condenses to alum, or else from boiling a solution of alum which is\r\nobtained from a kind of earth, or from rocks, or from pyrites, or other\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 567 (Vitriol Making): A--Tanks. B--Stirring poles.\r\nC--Plug. D--Trough. E--Reservoir. F--Launder. G--lead caldron. H--Wooden\r\ntubs sunk into the earth. I--Vats in which twigs are fixed.]\r\n\r\nThis kind of earth having first been dug up in such quantity as would\r\nmake three hundred wheelbarrow loads, is thrown into two tanks; then the\r\nwater is turned into them, and if it (the earth) contains vitriol it\r\nmust be diluted with urine. The workmen must many times a day stir the\r\nore with long, thick sticks in order that the water and urine may be\r\nmixed with it; then the plugs having been taken out of both tanks, the\r\nsolution is drawn off into a trough, which is carved out of one or two\r\ntrees. If the locality is supplied with an abundance of such ore, it\r\nshould not immediately be thrown into the tanks, but first conveyed into\r\nopen spaces and heaped up, for the longer it is exposed to the air and\r\nthe rain, the better it is; after some months, during which the ore has\r\nbeen heaped up in open spaces into mounds, there are generated veinlets\r\nof far better quality than the ore. Then it is conveyed into six or more\r\ntanks, nine feet in length and breadth and five in depth, and afterward\r\nwater is drawn into them of similar solution. After this, when the water\r\nhas absorbed the alum, the plugs are pulled out, and the solution\r\nescapes into a round reservoir forty feet wide and three feet deep. Then\r\nthe ore is thrown out of the tanks into other tanks, and water again\r\nbeing run into the latter and the urine added and stirred by means of\r\npoles, the plugs are withdrawn and the solution is run off into the same\r\nreservoir. A few days afterward, the reservoirs containing the solution\r\nare emptied through a small launder, and run into rectangular lead\r\ncaldrons; it is boiled in them until the greater part of the water has\r\nevaporated. The earthy sediment deposited at the bottom of the caldron\r\nis composed of fatty and aluminous matter, which usually consists of\r\nsmall incrustations, in which there is not infrequently found a very\r\nwhite and very light powder of asbestos or gypsum. The solution now\r\nseems to be full of meal. Some people instead pour the partly evaporated\r\nsolution into a vat, so that it may become pure and clear; then pouring\r\nit back into the caldron, they boil it again until it becomes mealy. By\r\nwhichever process it has been condensed, it is then poured into a wooden\r\ntub sunk into the earth in order to cool it. When it becomes cold it is\r\npoured into vats, in which are arranged horizontal and vertical twigs,\r\nto which the alum clings when it condenses; and thus are made the small\r\nwhite transparent cubes, which are laid to dry in hot rooms.\r\n\r\nIf vitriol forms part of the aluminous ore, the material is dissolved in\r\nwater without being mixed with urine, but it is necessary to pour that\r\ninto the clear and pure solution when it is to be re-boiled. This\r\nseparates the vitriol from the alum, for by this method the latter sinks\r\nto the bottom of the caldron, while the former floats on the top; both\r\nmust be poured separately into smaller vessels, and from these into vats\r\nto condense. If, however, when the solution was re-boiled they did not\r\nseparate, then they must be poured from the smaller vessels into larger\r\nvessels and covered over; then the vitriol separating from the alum, it\r\ncondenses. Both are cut out and put to dry in the hot room, and are\r\nready to be sold; the solution which did not congeal in the vessels\r\nand vats is again poured back into the caldron to be re-boiled. The\r\nearth which settled at the bottom of the caldron is carried back to the\r\ntanks, and, together with the ore, is again dissolved with water and\r\nurine. The earth which remains in the tanks after the solution has been\r\ndrawn off is emptied in a heap, and daily becomes more and more\r\naluminous in the same way as the earth from which saltpetre was made,\r\nbut fuller of its juices, wherefore it is again thrown into the tanks\r\nand percolated by water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 571 (Alum Making): A--Furnace. B--Enclosed space.\r\nC--Aluminous rock. D--Deep ladle. E--Caldron. F--Launder. G--Troughs.]\r\n\r\nAluminous rock is first roasted in a furnace similar to a lime kiln. At\r\nthe bottom of the kiln a vaulted fireplace is made of the same kind of\r\nrock; the remainder of the empty part of the kiln is then entirely\r\nfilled with the same aluminous rocks. Then they are heated with fire\r\nuntil they are red hot and have exhaled their sulphurous fumes, which\r\noccurs, according to their divers nature, within the space of ten,\r\neleven, twelve, or more hours. One thing the master must guard against\r\nmost of all is not to roast the rock either too much or too little, for\r\non the one hand they would not soften when sprinkled with water, and on\r\nthe other they either would be too hard or would crumble into ashes;\r\nfrom neither would much alum be obtained, for the strength which they\r\nhave would be decreased. When the rocks are cooled they are drawn out\r\nand conveyed into an open space, where they are piled one upon the other\r\nin heaps fifty feet long, eight feet wide, and four feet high, which are\r\nsprinkled for forty days with water carried in deep ladles. In spring\r\nthe sprinkling is done both morning and evening, and in summer at noon\r\nbesides. After being moistened for this length of time the rocks begin\r\nto fall to pieces like slaked lime, and there originates a certain new\r\nmaterial of the future alum, which is soft and similar to the _liquidae\r\nmedullae_ found in the rocks. It is white if the stone was white before\r\nit was roasted, and rose-coloured if red was mixed with the white; from\r\nthe former, white alum is obtained, and from the latter, rose-coloured.\r\nA round furnace is made, the lower part of which, in order to be able to\r\nendure the force of the heat, is made of rock that neither melts nor\r\ncrumbles to powder by the fire. It is constructed in the form of a\r\nbasket, the walls of which are two feet high, made of the same rock. On\r\nthese walls rests a large round caldron made of copper plates, which is\r\nconcave at the bottom, where it is eight feet in diameter. In the empty\r\nspace under the bottom they place the wood to be kindled with fire.\r\nAround the edge of the bottom of the caldron, rock is built in\r\ncone-shaped, and the diameter of the bottom of the rock structure is\r\nseven feet, and of the top ten feet; it is eight feet deep. The inside,\r\nafter being rubbed over with oil, is covered with cement, so that it may\r\nbe able to hold boiling water; the cement is composed of fresh lime, of\r\nwhich the lumps are slaked with wine, of iron-scales, and of sea-snails,\r\nground and mixed with the white of eggs and oil. The edges of the\r\ncaldron are surmounted with a circle of wood a foot thick and half a\r\nfoot high, on which the workmen rest the wooden shovels with which they\r\ncleanse the water of earth and of the undissolved lumps of rock that\r\nremain at the bottom of the caldron. The caldron, being thus prepared,\r\nis entirely filled through a launder with water, and this is boiled with\r\na fierce fire until it bubbles. Then little by little eight wheelbarrow\r\nloads of the material, composed of roasted rock moistened with water,\r\nare gradually emptied into the caldron by four workmen, who, with their\r\nshovels which reach to the bottom, keep the material stirred and mixed\r\nwith water, and by the same means they lift the lumps of undissolved\r\nrock out of the caldron. In this manner the material is thrown in, in\r\nthree or four lots, at intervals of two or three hours more or less;\r\nduring these intervals, the water, which has been cooled by the rock and\r\nmaterial, again begins to boil. The water, when sufficiently purified\r\nand ready to congeal, is ladled out and run off with launders into\r\nthirty troughs. These troughs are made of oak, holm oak, or Turkey oak;\r\ntheir interior is six feet long, five feet deep, and four feet wide. In\r\nthese the water congeals and condenses into alum, in the spring in the\r\nspace of four days, and in summer in six days. Afterward the holes at\r\nthe bottom of the oak troughs being opened, the water which has not\r\ncongealed is drawn off into buckets and poured back into the caldron; or\r\nit may be preserved in empty troughs, so that the master of the workmen,\r\nhaving seen it, may order his helpers to pour it into the caldron, for\r\nthe water which is not altogether wanting in alum, is considered better\r\nthan that which has none at all. Then the alum is hewn out with a knife\r\nor a chisel. It is thick and excellent according to the strength of the\r\nrock, either white or pink according to the colour of the rock. The\r\nearthy powder, which remains three to four digits thick as the residue\r\nof the alum at the bottom of the trough is again thrown into the caldron\r\nand boiled with fresh aluminous material. Lastly, the alum cut out is\r\nwashed, and dried, and sold.\r\n\r\nAlum is also made from crude pyrites and other aluminous mixtures. It is\r\nfirst roasted in an enclosed area; then, after being exposed for some\r\nmonths to the air in order to soften it, it is thrown into vats and\r\ndissolved. After this the solution is poured into the leaden rectangular\r\npans and boiled until it condenses into alum. The pyrites and other\r\nstones which are not mixed with alum alone, but which also contain\r\nvitriol, as is most usually the case, are both treated in the manner\r\nwhich I have already described. Finally, if metal is contained in the\r\npyrites and other rock, this material must be dried, and from it either\r\ngold, silver, or copper is made in a furnace.\r\n\r\nVitriol[11] can be made by four different methods; by two of these\r\nmethods from water containing vitriol; by one method from a solution of\r\n_melanteria_, _sory_ and _chalcitis_; and by another method from earth\r\nor stones mixed with vitriol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 574 (Vitriol Making): A--Tunnel. B--Bucket. C--Pit.]\r\n\r\nThe vitriol water is collected into pools, and if it cannot be drained\r\ninto them, it must be drawn up and carried to them in buckets by a\r\nworkman. In hot regions or in summer, it is poured into out-of-door\r\npits which have been dug to a certain depth, or else it is extracted\r\nfrom shafts by pumps and poured into launders, through which it flows\r\ninto the pits, where it is condensed by the heat of the sun. In cold\r\nregions and in winter these vitriol waters are boiled down with equal\r\nparts of fresh water in rectangular leaden caldrons; then, when cold,\r\nthe mixture is poured into vats or into tanks, which Pliny calls wooden\r\nfish-tanks. In these tanks light cross-beams are fixed to the upper\r\npart, so that they may be stationary, and from them hang ropes stretched\r\nwith little stones; to these the contents of the thickened solutions\r\ncongeal and adhere in transparent cubes or seeds of vitriol, like\r\nbunches of grapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 575 (Vitriol Making): A--Caldron. B--Tank. C--Cross-bars.\r\nD--Ropes. E--Little stones.]\r\n\r\nBy the third method vitriol is made out of _melanteria_ and _sory_. If\r\nthe mines give an abundant supply of _melanteria_ and _sory_, it is\r\nbetter to reject the _chalcitis_, and especially the _misy_, for from\r\nthese the vitriol is impure, particularly from the _misy_. These\r\nmaterials having been dug and thrown into the tanks, they are first\r\ndissolved with water; then, in order to recover the pyrites from which\r\ncopper is not rarely smelted and which forms a sediment at the bottom of\r\nthe tanks, the solution is transferred to other vats, which are nine\r\nfeet wide and three feet deep. Twigs and wood which float on the surface\r\nare lifted out with a broom made of twigs, and afterward all the\r\nsediment settles at the bottom of this vat. The solution is poured into\r\na rectangular leaden caldron eight feet long, three feet wide, and the\r\nsame in depth. In this caldron it is boiled until it becomes thick and\r\nviscous, when it is poured into a launder, through which it runs into\r\nanother leaden caldron of the same size as the one described before.\r\nWhen cold, the solution is drawn off through twelve little launders, out\r\nof which it flows into as many wooden tubs four and a half feet deep and\r\nthree feet wide. Upon these tubs are placed perforated crossbars distant\r\nfrom each other from four to six digits, and from the holes hang thin\r\nlaths, which reach to the bottom, with pegs or wedges driven into them.\r\nThe vitriol adheres to these laths, and within the space of a few days\r\ncongeals into cubes, which are taken away and put into a chamber having\r\na sloping board floor, so that the moisture which drips from the vitriol\r\nmay flow into a tub beneath. This solution is re-boiled, as is also that\r\nsolution which was left in the twelve tubs, for, by reason of its having\r\nbecome too thin and liquid, it did not congeal, and was thus not\r\nconverted into vitriol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 576 (Vitriol Making): A--Wooden tub. B--Cross-bars.\r\nC--Laths. D--Sloping floor of the chamber. E--Tub placed under it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 577 (Vitriol Making): A--Caldron. B--Moulds. C--Cakes.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth method of making vitriol is from vitriolous earth or stones.\r\nSuch ore is at first carried and heaped up, and is then left for five or\r\nsix months exposed to the rain of spring and autumn, to the heat of\r\nsummer, and to the rime and frost of winter. It must be turned over\r\nseveral times with shovels, so that the part at the bottom may be\r\nbrought to the top, and it is thus ventilated and cooled; by this means\r\nthe earth crumbles up and loosens, and the stone changes from hard to\r\nsoft. Then the ore is covered with a roof, or else it is taken away and\r\nplaced under a roof, and remains in that place six, seven, or eight\r\nmonths. Afterward as large a portion as is required is thrown into a\r\nvat, which is half-filled with water; this vat is one hundred feet\r\nlong, twenty-four feet wide, eight feet deep. It has an opening at the\r\nbottom, so that when it is opened the dregs of the ore from which the\r\nvitriol comes may be drawn off, and it has, at the height of one foot\r\nfrom the bottom, three or four little holes, so that, when closed, the\r\nwater may be retained, and when opened the solution flows out. Thus the\r\nore is mixed with water, stirred with poles and left in the tank until\r\nthe earthy portions sink to the bottom and the water absorbs the juices.\r\nThen the little holes are opened, the solution flows out of the vat, and\r\nis caught in a vat below it; this vat is of the same length as the\r\nother, but twelve feet wide and four feet deep. If the solution is not\r\nsufficiently vitriolous it is mixed with fresh ore; but if it contains\r\nenough vitriol, and yet has not exhausted all of the ore rich in\r\nvitriol, it is well to dissolve the ore again with fresh water. As soon\r\nas the solution becomes clear, it is poured into the rectangular leaden\r\ncaldron through launders, and is boiled until the water is evaporated.\r\nAfterward as many thin strips of iron as the nature of the solution\r\nrequires, are thrown in, and then it is boiled again until it is thick\r\nenough, when cold, to congeal into vitriol. Then it is poured into tanks\r\nor vats, or any other receptacle, in which all of it that is apt to\r\ncongeal does so within two or three days. The solution which does not\r\ncongeal is either poured back into the caldron to be boiled again, or\r\nit is put aside for dissolving the new ore, for it is far preferable to\r\nfresh water. The solidified vitriol is hewn out, and having once more\r\nbeen thrown into the caldron, is re-heated until it liquefies; when\r\nliquid, it is poured into moulds that it may be made into cakes. If the\r\nsolution first poured out is not satisfactorily thickened, it is\r\ncondensed two or three times, and each time liquefied in the caldron and\r\nre-poured into the moulds, in which manner pure cakes, beautiful to look\r\nat, are made from it.\r\n\r\nThe vitriolous pyrites, which are to be numbered among the mixtures\r\n(_mistura_), are roasted as in the case of alum, and dissolved with\r\nwater, and the solution is boiled in leaden caldrons until it condenses\r\ninto vitriol. Both alum and vitriol are often made out of these, and it\r\nis no wonder, for these juices are cognate, and only differ in the one\r\npoint,--that the former is less, the latter more, earthy. That pyrites\r\nwhich contains metal must be smelted in the furnace. In the same manner,\r\nfrom other mixtures of vitriolic and metalliferous material are made\r\nvitriol and metal. Indeed, if ores of vitriolous pyrites abound, the\r\nminers split small logs down the centre and cut them off in lengths as\r\nlong as the drifts and tunnels are wide, in which they lay them down\r\ntransversely; but, that they may be stable, they are laid on the ground\r\nwith the wide side down and the round side up, and they touch each other\r\nat the bottom, but not at the top. The intermediate space is filled with\r\npyrites, and the same crushed are scattered over the wood, so that,\r\ncoming in or going out, the road is flat and even. Since the drifts or\r\ntunnels drip with water, these pyrites are soaked, and from them are\r\nfreed the vitriol and cognate things. If the water ceases to drip, these\r\ndry and harden, and then they are raised from the shafts, together with\r\nthe pyrites not yet dissolved in the water, or they are carried out from\r\nthe tunnels; then they are thrown into vats or tanks, and boiling water\r\nhaving been poured over them, the vitriol is freed and the pyrites are\r\ndissolved. This green solution is transferred to other vats or tanks,\r\nthat it may be made clear and pure; it is then boiled in the lead\r\ncaldrons until it thickens; afterward it is poured into wooden tubs,\r\nwhere it condenses on rods, or reeds, or twigs, into green vitriol.\r\n\r\nSulphur is made from sulphurous waters, from sulphurous ores, and from\r\nsulphurous mixtures. These waters are poured into the leaden caldrons\r\nand boiled until they condense into sulphur. From this latter, heated\r\ntogether with iron-scales, and transferred into pots, which are\r\nafterward covered with lute and refined sulphur, another sulphur is\r\nmade, which we call _caballinum_.[12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration 579 (Sulphur Making): A--Pots having spouts. B--Pots\r\nwithout spouts. C--Lids.]\r\n\r\nThe ores[13] which consist mostly of sulphur and of earth, and rarely of\r\nother minerals, are melted in big-bellied earthenware pots. The\r\nfurnaces, which hold two of these pots, are divided into three parts;\r\nthe lowest part is a foot high, and has an opening at the front for the\r\ndraught; the top of this is covered with iron plates, which are\r\nperforated near the edges, and these support iron rods, upon which the\r\nfirewood is placed. The middle part of the furnace is one and a half\r\nfeet high, and has a mouth in front, so that the wood may be inserted;\r\nthe top of this has rods, upon which the bottom of the pots stand. The\r\nupper part is about two feet high, and the pots are also two feet high\r\nand one digit thick; these have below their mouths a long, slender\r\nspout. In order that the mouth of the pot may be covered, an earthenware\r\nlid is made which fits into it. For every two of these pots there must\r\nbe one pot of the same size and shape, and without a spout, but having\r\nthree holes, two of which are below the mouth and receive the spouts of\r\nthe two first pots; the third hole is on the opposite side at the\r\nbottom, and through it the sulphur flows out. In each furnace are placed\r\ntwo pots with spouts, and the furnace must be covered by plates of iron\r\nsmeared over with lute two digits thick; it is thus entirely closed in,\r\nbut for two or three vent-holes through which the mouths of the pots\r\nproject. Outside of the furnace, against one side, is placed the pot\r\nwithout a spout, into the two holes of which the two spouts of the other\r\npots penetrate, and this pot should be built in at both sides to keep it\r\nsteady. When the sulphur ore has been placed in the pots, and these\r\nplaced in the furnace, they are closely covered, and it is desirable to\r\nsmear the joint over with lute, so that the sulphur will not exhale, and\r\nfor the same reason the pot below is covered with a lid, which is also\r\nsmeared with lute. The wood having been kindled, the ores are heated\r\nuntil the sulphur is exhaled, and the vapour, arising through the spout,\r\npenetrates into the lower pot and thickens into sulphur, which falls to\r\nthe bottom like melted wax. It then flows out through the hole, which,\r\nas I said, is at the bottom of this pot; and the workman makes it into\r\ncakes, or thin sticks or thin pieces of wood are dipped in it. Then he\r\ntakes the burning wood and glowing charcoal from the furnace, and when\r\nit has cooled, he opens the two pots, empties the residues, which, if\r\nthe ores were composed of sulphur and earth, resemble naturally\r\nextinguished ashes; but if the ores consisted of sulphur and earth and\r\nstone, or sulphur and stone only, they resemble earth completely dried\r\nor stones well roasted. Afterward the pots are re-filled with ore, and\r\nthe whole work is repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 581 (Sulphur Making): A--Long wall. B--High walls. C--Low\r\nwalls. D--Plates. E--Upper pots. F--Lower pots.]\r\n\r\nThe sulphurous mixture, whether it consists of stone and sulphur only,\r\nor of stone and sulphur and metal, may be heated in similar pots, but\r\nwith perforated bottoms. Before the furnace is constructed, against the\r\n\"second\" wall of the works two lateral partitions are built seven feet\r\nhigh, three feet long, one and a half feet thick, and these are distant\r\nfrom each other twenty-seven feet. Between them are seven low brick\r\nwalls, that measure but two feet and the same number of digits in\r\nheight, and, like the other walls, are three feet long and one foot\r\nthick; these little walls are at equal distances from one another,\r\nconsequently they will be two and one half feet apart. At the top, iron\r\nbars are fixed into them, which sustain iron plates three feet long and\r\nwide and one digit thick, so that they can bear not only the weight of\r\nthe pots, but also the fierceness of the fire. These plates have in the\r\nmiddle a round hole one and a half digits wide; there must not be more\r\nthan eight of these, and upon them as many pots are placed. These pots\r\nare perforated at the bottom, and the same number of whole pots are\r\nplaced underneath them; the former contain the mixture, and are covered\r\nwith lids; the latter contain water, and their mouths are under the\r\nholes in the plates. After wood has been arranged round the upper pots\r\nand ignited, the mixture being heated, red, yellow, or green sulphur\r\ndrips from it and flows down through the hole, and is caught by the pots\r\nplaced underneath the plates, and is at once cooled by the water. If the\r\nmixture contains metal, it is reserved for smelting, and, if not, it is\r\nthrown away. The sulphur from such a mixture can best be extracted if\r\nthe upper pots are placed in a vaulted furnace, like those which I\r\ndescribed among other metallurgical subjects in Book VIII., which has no\r\nfloor, but a grate inside; under this the lower pots are placed in the\r\nsame manner, but the plates must have larger holes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 582 (Bitumen Making): A--Lower pot. B--Upper pot. C--Lid.]\r\n\r\nOthers bury a pot in the ground, and place over it another pot with a\r\nhole at the bottom, in which pyrites or _cadmia_, or other sulphurous\r\nstones are so enclosed that the sulphur cannot exhale. A fierce fire\r\nheats the sulphur, and it drips away and flows down into the lower pot,\r\nwhich contains water. (Illustration p. 582).\r\n\r\n[Illustration 583 (Bitumen Making): A--Bituminous spring. B--Bucket.\r\nC--Pot. D--Lid.]\r\n\r\nBitumen[14] is made from bituminous waters, from liquid bitumen, and\r\nfrom mixtures of bituminous substances. The water, bituminous as well as\r\nsalty, at Babylon, as Pliny writes, was taken from the wells to the\r\nsalt works and heated by the great heat of the sun, and condensed partly\r\ninto liquid bitumen and partly into salt. The bitumen being lighter,\r\nfloats on the top, while the salt being heavier, sinks to the bottom.\r\nLiquid bitumen, if there is much floating on springs, streams and\r\nrivers, is drawn up in buckets or other vessels; but, if there is\r\nlittle, it is collected with goose wings, pieces of linen, _ralla_,\r\nshreds of reeds, and other things to which it easily adheres, and it is\r\nboiled in large brass or iron pots by fire and condensed. As this\r\nbitumen is put to divers uses, some mix pitch with the liquid, others\r\nold cart-grease, in order to temper its viscosity; these, however long\r\nthey are boiled in the pots, cannot be made hard. The mixtures\r\ncontaining bitumen are also treated in the same manner as those\r\ncontaining sulphur, in pots having a hole in the bottom, and it is rare\r\nthat such bitumen is not highly esteemed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 585 (Chrysocolla Making): A--Mouth of the tunnel.\r\nB--Trough. C--Tanks. D--Little trough.]\r\n\r\nSince all solidified juices and earths, if abundantly and copiously\r\nmixed with the water, are deposited in the beds of springs, streams or\r\nrivers, and the stones therein are coated by them, they do not require\r\nthe heat of the sun or fire to harden them. This having been pondered\r\nover by wise men, they discovered methods by which the remainder of\r\nthese solidified juices and unusual earths can be collected. Such\r\nwaters, whether flowing from springs or tunnels, are collected in many\r\nwooden tubs or tanks arranged in consecutive order, and deposit in them\r\nsuch juices or earths; these being scraped off every year, are\r\ncollected, as _chrysocolla_[15] in the Carpathians and as ochre in the\r\nHarz.\r\n\r\nThere remains glass, the preparation of which belongs here, for the\r\nreason that it is obtained by the power of fire and subtle art from\r\ncertain solidified juices and from coarse or fine sand. It is\r\ntransparent, as are certain solidified juices, gems, and stones; and can\r\nbe melted like fusible stones and metals. First I must speak of the\r\nmaterials from which glass is made; then of the furnaces in which it is\r\nmelted; then of the methods by which it is produced.\r\n\r\nIt is made from fusible stones and from solidified juices, or from other\r\njuicy substances which are connected by a natural relationship. Stones\r\nwhich are fusible, if they are white and translucent, are more excellent\r\nthan the others, for which reason crystals take the first place. From\r\nthese, when pounded, the most excellent transparent glass was made in\r\nIndia, with which no other could be compared, as Pliny relates. The\r\nsecond place is accorded to stones which, although not so hard as\r\ncrystal, are yet just as white and transparent. The third is given to\r\nwhite stones, which are not transparent. It is necessary, however, first\r\nof all to heat all these, and afterward they are subjected to the pestle\r\nin order to break and crush them into coarse sand, and then they are\r\npassed through a sieve. If this kind of coarse or fine sand is found by\r\nthe glass-makers near the mouth of a river, it saves them much labour in\r\nburning and crushing. As regards the solidified juices, the first place\r\nis given to soda; the second to white and translucent rock-salt; the\r\nthird to salts which are made from lye, from the ashes of the musk ivy,\r\nor from other salty herbs. Yet there are some who give to this latter,\r\nand not to the former, the second place. One part of coarse or fine sand\r\nmade from fusible stones should be mixed with two parts of soda or of\r\nrock-salt or of herb salts, to which are added minute particles of\r\n_magnes_.[16] It is true that in our day, as much as in ancient times,\r\nthere exists the belief in the singular power of the latter to attract\r\nto itself the vitreous liquid just as it does iron, and by attracting it\r\nto purify and transform green or yellow into white; and afterward fire\r\nconsumes the _magnes_. When the said juices are not to be had, two parts\r\nof the ashes of oak or holmoak, or of hard oak or Turkey oak, or if\r\nthese be not available, of beech or pine, are mixed with one part of\r\ncoarse or fine sand, and a small quantity of salt is added, made from\r\nsalt water or sea-water, and a small particle of _magnes_; but these\r\nmake a less white and translucent glass. The ashes should be made from\r\nold trees, of which the trunk at a height of six feet is hollowed out\r\nand fire is put in, and thus the whole tree is consumed and converted\r\ninto ashes. This is done in winter when the snow lies long, or in summer\r\nwhen it does not rain, for the showers at other times of the year, by\r\nmixing the ashes with earth, render them impure; for this reason, at\r\nsuch times, these same trees are cut up into many pieces and burned\r\nunder cover, and are thus converted into ashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 587 (Glass-making Furnace): A--Lower chamber of the first\r\nfurnace. B--Upper chamber. C--Vitreous mass.]\r\n\r\nSome glass-makers use three furnaces, others two, others only one. Those\r\nwho use three, melt the material in the first, re-melt it in the second,\r\nand in the third they cool the glowing glass vessels and other\r\narticles. Of these the first furnace must be vaulted and similar to an\r\noven. In the upper chamber, which is six feet long, four feet wide, and\r\ntwo feet high, the mixed materials are heated by a fierce fire of dry\r\nwood until they melt and are converted into a vitreous mass. And if they\r\nare not satisfactorily purified from dross, they are taken out and\r\ncooled and broken into pieces; and the vitreous pieces are heated in\r\npots in the same furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 588 (Glass-making Furnace): A--Arches of the second\r\nfurnace. B--Mouth of the lower chamber. C--Windows of the upper chamber.\r\nD--Big-bellied pots. E--Mouth of the third furnace. F--Recesses for the\r\nreceptacles. G--Openings in the upper chamber. H--Oblong receptacles.]\r\n\r\nThe second furnace is round, ten feet in diameter and eight feet high,\r\nand on the outside, so that it may be stronger, it is encompassed by\r\nfive arches, one and one half feet thick; it consists in like manner of\r\ntwo chambers, of which the lower one is vaulted and is one and one half\r\nfeet thick. In front this chamber has a narrow mouth, through which the\r\nwood can be put into the hearth, which is on the ground. At the top and\r\nin the middle of its vault, there is a large round hole which opens to\r\nthe upper chamber, so that the flames can penetrate into it. Between the\r\narches in the walls of the upper chamber are eight windows, so large\r\nthat the big-bellied pots may be placed through them on to the floor of\r\nthe chamber, around the large hole. The thickness of these pots is about\r\ntwo digits, their height the same number of feet, and the diameter of\r\nthe belly one and a half feet, and of the mouth and bottom one foot. In\r\nthe back part of the furnace is a rectangular hole, measuring in height\r\nand width a palm, through which the heat penetrates into a third furnace\r\nwhich adjoins it.\r\n\r\nThis third furnace is rectangular, eight feet long and six feet wide; it\r\nalso consists of two chambers, of which the lower has a mouth in front,\r\nso that firewood may be placed on the hearth which is on the ground. On\r\neach side of this opening in the wall of the lower chamber is a recess\r\nfor oblong earthenware receptacles, which are about four feet long, two\r\nfeet high, and one and a half feet wide. The upper chamber has two\r\nholes, one on the right side, the other on the left, of such height and\r\nwidth that earthenware receptacles may be conveniently placed in them.\r\nThese latter receptacles are three feet long, one and a half feet high,\r\nthe lower part one foot wide, and the upper part rounded. In these\r\nreceptacles the glass articles, which have been blown, are placed so\r\nthat they may cool in a milder temperature; if they were not cooled\r\nslowly they would burst asunder. When the vessels are taken from the\r\nupper chamber, they are immediately placed in the receptacles to cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 589 (Glass-making Furnaces): A--Lower chamber of the\r\nother second furnace. B--Middle one. C--Upper one. D--Its opening.\r\nE--Round opening. F--Rectangular opening.]\r\n\r\nSome who use two furnaces partly melt the mixture in the first, and not\r\nonly re-melt it in the second, but also replace the glass articles\r\nthere. Others partly melt and re-melt the material in different chambers\r\nof the second furnace. Thus the former lack the third furnace, and the\r\nlatter, the first. But this kind of second furnace differs from the\r\nother second furnace, for it is, indeed, round, but the interior is\r\neight feet in diameter and twelve feet high, and it consists of three\r\nchambers, of which the lowest is not unlike the lowest of the other\r\nsecond furnace. In the middle chamber wall there are six arched\r\nopenings, in which are placed the pots to be heated, and the remainder\r\nof the small windows are blocked up with lute. In the middle top of the\r\nmiddle chamber is a square opening a palm in length and width. Through\r\nthis the heat penetrates into the upper chamber, of which the rear part\r\nhas an opening to receive the oblong earthenware receptacles, in which\r\nare placed the glass articles to be slowly cooled. On this side, the\r\nground of the workshop is higher, or else a bench is placed there, so\r\nthat the glass-makers may stand upon it to stow away their products more\r\nconveniently.\r\n\r\nThose who lack the first furnace in the evening, when they have\r\naccomplished their day's work, place the material in the pots, so that\r\nthe heat during the night may melt it and turn it into glass. Two boys\r\nalternately, during night and day, keep up the fire by throwing dry wood\r\non to the hearth. Those who have but one furnace use the second sort,\r\nmade with three chambers. Then in the evening they pour the material\r\ninto the pots, and in the morning, having extracted the fused material,\r\nthey make the glass objects, which they place in the upper chamber, as\r\ndo the others.\r\n\r\nThe second furnace consists either of two or three chambers, the first\r\nof which is made of unburnt bricks dried in the sun. These bricks are\r\nmade of a kind of clay that cannot be easily melted by fire nor resolved\r\ninto powder; this clay is cleaned of small stones and beaten with rods.\r\nThe bricks are laid with the same kind of clay instead of lime. From the\r\nsame clay the potters also make their vessels and pots, which they dry\r\nin the shade. These two parts having been completed, there remains the\r\nthird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 591 (Glass Making): A--Blow-pipe. B--Little window.\r\nC--Marble. D--Forceps. E--Moulds by means of which the shapes are\r\nproduced.]\r\n\r\nThe vitreous mass having been made in the first furnace in the manner I\r\ndescribed, is broken up, and the assistant heats the second furnace, in\r\norder that the fragments may be re-melted. In the meantime, while they\r\nare doing this, the pots are first warmed by a slow fire in the first\r\nfurnace, so that the vapours may evaporate, and then by a fiercer fire,\r\nso that they become red in drying. Afterward the glass-makers open the\r\nmouth of the furnace, and, seizing the pots with tongs, if they have not\r\ncracked and fallen to pieces, quickly place them in the second furnace,\r\nand they fill them up with the fragments of the heated vitreous mass or\r\nwith glass. Afterward they close up all the windows with lute and\r\nbricks, with the exception that in each there are two little windows\r\nleft free; through one of these they inspect the glass contained in the\r\npot, and take it up by means of a blow-pipe; in the other they rest\r\nanother blow-pipe, so that it may get warm. Whether it is made of brass,\r\nbronze, or iron, the blow-pipe must be three feet long. In front of\r\nthe window is inserted a lip of marble, on which rests the heaped-up\r\nclay and the iron shield. The clay holds the blow-pipe when it is put\r\ninto the furnace, whereas the shield preserves the eyes of the\r\nglass-maker from the fire. All this having been carried out in order,\r\nthe glass-makers bring the work to completion. The broken pieces they\r\nre-melt with dry wood, which emits no smoke, but only a flame. The\r\nlonger they re-melt it, the purer and more transparent it becomes, the\r\nfewer spots and blisters there are, and therefore the glass-makers can\r\ncarry out their work more easily. For this reason those who only melt\r\nthe material from which glass is made for one night, and then\r\nimmediately make it up into glass articles, make them less pure and\r\ntransparent than those who first produce a vitreous mass and then\r\nre-melt the broken pieces again for a day and a night. And, again, these\r\nmake a less pure and transparent glass than do those who melt it again\r\nfor two days and two nights, for the excellence of the glass does not\r\nconsist solely in the material from which it is made, but also in the\r\nmelting. The glass-makers often test the glass by drawing it up with the\r\nblowpipes; as soon as they observe that the fragments have been\r\nre-melted and purified satisfactorily, each of them with another\r\nblow-pipe which is in the pot, slowly stirs and takes up the glass which\r\nsticks to it in the shape of a ball like a glutinous, coagulated gum. He\r\ntakes up just as much as he needs to complete the article he wishes to\r\nmake; then he presses it against the lip of marble and kneads it round\r\nand round until it consolidates. When he blows through the pipe he blows\r\nas he would if inflating a bubble; he blows into the blow-pipe as often\r\nas it is necessary, removing it from his mouth to re-fill his cheeks, so\r\nthat his breath does not draw the flames into his mouth. Then, twisting\r\nthe lifted blow-pipe round his head in a circle, he makes a long glass,\r\nor moulds the same in a hollow copper mould, turning it round and round,\r\nthen warming it again, blowing it and pressing it, he widens it into the\r\nshape of a cup or vessel, or of any other object he has in mind. Then he\r\nagain presses this against the marble to flatten the bottom, which he\r\nmoulds in the interior with his other blow-pipe. Afterward he cuts out\r\nthe lip with shears, and, if necessary, adds feet and handles. If it so\r\nplease him, he gilds it and paints it with various colours. Finally, he\r\nlays it in the oblong earthenware receptacle, which is placed in the\r\nthird furnace, or in the upper chamber of the second furnace, that it\r\nmay cool. When this receptacle is full of other slowly-cooled articles,\r\nhe passes a wide iron bar under it, and, carrying it on the left arm,\r\nplaces it in another recess.\r\n\r\nThe glass-makers make divers things, such as goblets, cups, ewers,\r\nflasks, dishes, plates, panes of glass, animals, trees, and ships, all\r\nof which excellent and wonderful works I have seen when I spent two\r\nwhole years in Venice some time ago. Especially at the time of the Feast\r\nof the Ascension they were on sale at Morano, where are located the most\r\ncelebrated glass-works. These I saw on other occasions, and when, for a\r\ncertain reason, I visited Andrea Naugerio in his house which he had\r\nthere, and conversed with him and Francisco Asulano.\r\n\r\n     END OF BOOK XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The history of salt-making in salt-pans, from sea-water or salt\r\nsprings, goes further back than human records. From an historical point\r\nof view the real interest attached to salt lies in the bearing which\r\nlocalities rich in either natural salt or salt springs, have had upon\r\nthe movements of the human race. Many ancient trade routes have been due\r\nto them, and innumerable battles have been fought for their possession.\r\nSalt has at times served for currency, and during many centuries in\r\nnearly every country has served as a basis of taxation. These subjects\r\ndo not, however, come within the scope of this text. For the quotation\r\nfrom Pliny referred to, see Note 14 below, on bitumen.\r\n\r\n[2] The first edition gives _graviorem_, the latter editions\r\n_gratiorem_, which latter would have quite the reverse meaning from the\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[3] The following are approximately the English equivalents:--\r\n\r\n                                     Pints.   Quarts.  Gallons.\r\n   1 _Cyathus_                        .08\r\n   3 _Cyathi_    = 1 _Quartarius_     .24\r\n   4 _Quartarii_ = 1 _Sextarius_      .99\r\n   6 _Sextarii_  = 1 _Congius_       5.94      2.97\r\n  16 _Sextarii_  = 1 _Modius_       15.85      7.93      1.98\r\n   8 _Congii_    = 1 _Amphora_      47.57     23.78      5.94\r\n\r\nThe dipper mentioned would thus hold about one and one quarter gallons,\r\nand the cask ten gallons.\r\n\r\n[4] The salt industry, founded upon salt springs, is still of importance\r\nto this city. It was a salt centre of importance to the Germanic tribes\r\nbefore Charles, the son of Charlemagne, erected a fortress here in 806.\r\nMention of the salt works is made in the charter by Otto I., conveying\r\nthe place to the Diocese of Magdeburg, in 968.\r\n\r\n[5] Pliny XXXI., 39-40. \"In the Gallic provinces in Germany they pour\r\nsalt water upon burning wood. The Spaniards in a certain place draw the\r\nbrine from wells, which they call _Muria_. They indeed think that the\r\nwood turns to salt, and that the oak is the best, being the kind which\r\nis itself salty. Elsewhere the hazel is praised. Thus the charcoal even\r\nis turned into salt when it is steeped in brine. Whenever salt is made\r\nwith wood it is black.\"\r\n\r\n[6] We have elsewhere in this book used the word \"soda\" for the Latin\r\nterm _nitrum_, because we believe as used by Agricola it was always\r\nsoda, and because some confusion of this term with its modern adaptation\r\nfor saltpetre (nitre) might arise in the mind of the reader.\r\nFortunately, Agricola usually carefully mentions other alkalis, such as\r\nthe product from lixiviation of ashes, separately from his _nitrum_. In\r\nthese paragraphs, however, he has soda and potash hopelessly mixed,\r\nwherefore we have here introduced the Latin term. The actual difference\r\nbetween potash and soda--the _nitrum_ of the Ancients, and the _alkali_\r\nof Geber (and the glossary of Agricola), was not understood for two\r\nhundred years after Agricola, when Duhamel made his well-known\r\ndeterminations; and the isolation of sodium and potassium was, of\r\ncourse, still later by fifty years. If the reeds and rushes described in\r\nthis paragraph grew near the sea, the salt from lixiviation would be\r\nsoda, and likewise the Egyptian product was soda, but the lixiviation of\r\nwood-ash produces only potash; as seen above, all are termed _nitrum_\r\nexcept the first.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTES.--The word _nitrum_, _nitron_, _nitri_, _neter_,\r\n_nether_, or similar forms, occurs in innumerable ancient writings.\r\nAmong such references are Jeremiah (II., 22) Proverbs (XXV., 20),\r\nHerodotus (II., 86, 87), Aristotle (_Prob._ I., 39, _De Mirab._ 54),\r\nTheophrastus (_De Igne_ 435 ed. Heinsii, Hist. Plants III., 9),\r\nDioscorides (V., 89), Pliny (XIV., 26, and XXXI., 46). A review of\r\ndisputations on what salts this term comprised among the Ancients would\r\nitself fill a volume, but from the properties named it was no doubt\r\nmostly soda, more rarely potash, and sometimes both mixed with common\r\nsalt. There is every reason to believe from the properties and uses\r\nmentioned, that it did not generally comprise nitre (saltpetre)--into\r\nwhich superficial error the nomenclature has led many translators. The\r\npreparation by way of burning, and the use of _nitrum_ for purposes for\r\nwhich we now use soap, for making glass, for medicines, cosmetics,\r\nsalves, painting, in baking powder, for preserving food, embalming,\r\netc., and the descriptions of its taste in \"nitrous\" waters,--all answer\r\nfor soda and potash, but not for saltpetre. It is possible that the\r\ncommon occurrence of saltpetre as an efflorescence on walls might\r\nnaturally lead to its use, but in any event its distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics are nowhere mentioned. As sal-ammoniac occurred in the\r\nvolcanoes in Italy, it also may have been included in the _nitrum_\r\nmentioned. _Nitrum_ was in the main exported from Egypt, but\r\nTheophrastus mentions its production from wood-ash, and Pliny very\r\nrightly states that burned lees of wine (argol) had the nature of\r\n_nitrum_. Many of the ancient writers understood that it was rendered\r\nmore caustic by burning, and still more so by treatment with lime.\r\nAccording to Beckmann (Hist. of Inventions II., p. 488), the form of the\r\nword _natron_ was first introduced into Europe by two travellers in\r\nEgypt, Peter Ballon and Prosper Alpinus, about 1550. The word was\r\nintroduced into mineralogy by Linnaeus in 1736. In the first instance\r\n_natron_ was applied to soda and potash in distinction to _nitre_ for\r\nsaltpetre, and later _natron_ was applied solely to soda.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to mention here two other forms of soda and potash which\r\nare frequently mentioned by Agricola. \"Ashes which wool dyers use\"\r\n(_cineres quo infectores lanarum utuntur_).--There is no indication in\r\nany of Agricola's works as to whether this was some special wood-ash or\r\nwhether it was the calcined residues from wool washing. The \"yolk\" or\r\n\"suint\" of wool, originating from the perspiration of the animal, has\r\nlong been a source of crude potash. The water, after washing the wool,\r\nis evaporated, and the residue calcined. It contains about 85%\r\nK_{2}CO_{3}, the remainder being sodium and potassium sulphates. Another\r\nreason for assuming that it was not a wood-ash product, is that these\r\nproducts are separately mentioned. In either event, whether obtained\r\nfrom wool residues or from lixiviation of wood-ash, it would be an\r\nimpure potash. In some methods of wool dyeing, a wash of soda was first\r\ngiven, so that it is barely possible that this substance was sodium\r\ncarbonate.\r\n\r\n\"Salt made from the ashes of musk ivy\" (_sal ex anthyllidis cinere\r\nfactus_,--Glossary, _salalkali_). This would be largely potash.\r\n\r\n[7] This wondrous illustration of soda-making from Nile water is no\r\ndoubt founded upon Pliny (XXXI., 46). \"It is made in almost the same\r\nmanner as salt, except that sea-water is put into salt pans, whereas in\r\nthe nitrous pans it is water of the Nile; these, with the subsidence of\r\nthe Nile during the forty days, are impregnated with _nitrum_.\"\r\n\r\n[8] This paragraph displays hopeless ignorance. Borax was known to\r\nAgricola and greatly used in his time; it certainly was not made from\r\nthese compounds, but was imported from Central Asia. Sal-ammoniac was\r\nalso known in his time, and was used like borax as a soldering agent.\r\nThe reaction given by Agricola would yield free ammonia. The following\r\nhistorical notes on borax and sal-ammoniac may be of service.\r\n\r\nBORAX.--The uncertainties of the ancient distinctions in salts involve\r\nborax deeply. The word _Baurach_ occurs in Geber and the other early\r\nAlchemistic writings, but there is nothing to prove that it was modern\r\nborax. There cannot be the slightest doubt, however, that the material\r\nreferred to by Agricola as _borax_ was our borax, because of the\r\ncharacteristic qualities incidentally mentioned in Book VII. That he\r\nbelieved it was an artificial product from _nitrum_ is evident enough\r\nfrom his usual expression \"_chrysocolla_ made from _nitrum_, which the\r\nMoors call _borax_.\" Agricola, in _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 206-7),\r\nmakes the following statements, which could leave no doubt on the\r\nsubject:--\"Native _nitrum_ is found in the earth or on the surface....\r\nIt is from this variety that the Venetians make _chrysocolla_, which I\r\ncall _borax_.... The second variety of artificial _nitrum_ is made at\r\nthe present day from the native _nitrum_, called by the Arabs _tincar_,\r\nbut I call it usually by the Greek name _chrysocolla_; it is really the\r\nArabic _borax_.... This _nitrum_ does not decrepitate nor fly out of the\r\nfire; however, the native variety swells up from within.\" The\r\napplication of the word _chrysocolla_ (_chrysos_, gold; _colla_, solder)\r\nto soldering materials, and at the same time to the copper mineral, is\r\nof Greek origin. If any further proof were needed as to the substance\r\nmeant by Agricola, it lies in the word _tincar_. For a long time the\r\nborax of Europe was imported from Central Asia, through Constantinople\r\nand Venice, under the name of _tincal_ or _tincar_. When this trade\r\nbegan, we do not know; evidently before Agricola's time. The statement\r\nhere of making borax from alum and sal-ammoniac is identical with the\r\nassertion of Biringuccio (II., 9).\r\n\r\nSAL-AMMONIAC.--The early history of this--ammonium chloride--is also\r\nunder a cloud. Pliny (XXXI., 39) speaks of a _sal-hammoniacum_, and\r\nDioscorides (V., 85) uses much the same word. Pliny describes it as from\r\nnear the temple of Ammon in Egypt. None of the distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of sal-ammoniac are mentioned, and there is every reason\r\nto believe it was either common salt or soda. Herodotus, Strabo, and\r\nothers mention common salt sent from about the same locality. The first\r\nauthentic mention is in Geber, who calls it _sal-ammoniacum_, and\r\ndescribes a method of making, and several characteristic reactions. It\r\nwas known in the Middle Ages under various names, among them\r\n_sal-aremonicum_. Agricola (_De Nat. Fos._, III., p. 206) notes its\r\ncharacteristic quality of volatilization. \"Sal-ammoniac ... in the fire\r\nneither crackles nor flies out, but is totally consumed.\" He also says\r\n(p. 208): \"Borax is used by goldsmiths to solder gold, likewise silver.\r\nThe artificers who make iron needles (tacks?) similarly use sal-ammoniac\r\nwhen they cover the heads with tin.\" The statement from Pliny mentioned\r\nin this paragraph is from XXXIII., 29, where he describes the\r\n_chrysocolla_ used as gold solder as made from verdigris, _nitrum_, and\r\nurine in the way quoted. It is quite possible that this solder was\r\nsal-ammoniac, though not made in quite this manner. Pliny refers in\r\nseveral places (XXXIII., 26, 27, 28, and 29, XXXV., 28, etc.) to\r\n_chrysocolla_, about which he is greatly confused as between\r\ngold-solder, the copper mineral, and a green pigment, the latter being\r\nof either mineral origin.\r\n\r\n[9] Saltpetre was secured in the Middle Ages in two ways, but mostly\r\nfrom the treatment of calcium nitrate efflorescence on cellar and\r\nsimilar walls, and from so-called saltpetre plantations. In this\r\ndescription of the latter, one of the most essential factors is omitted\r\nuntil the last sentence, _i.e._, that the nitrous earth was the result\r\nof the decay of organic or animal matter over a long period. Such\r\ndecomposition, in the presence of potassium and calcium carbonates--the\r\nlye and lime--form potassium and calcium nitrates, together with some\r\nmagnesium and sodium nitrates. After lixiviation, the addition of lye\r\nconverts the calcium and magnesium nitrates into saltpetre, _i.e._,\r\nCa(NO_{3})_{2} + K_{2}CO_{3} = CaCO_{3} + 2KNO_{3}. The carbonates\r\nprecipitate out, leaving the saltpetre in solution, from which it was\r\nevaporated and crystallized out. The addition of alum as mentioned would\r\nscarcely improve the situation.\r\n\r\nThe purification by repeated re-solution and addition of lye, and\r\nfiltration, would eliminate the remaining other salts. The purification\r\nwith sulphur, however, is more difficult to understand. In this case the\r\nsaltpetre is melted and the sulphur added and set alight. Such an\r\naddition to saltpetre would no doubt burn brilliantly. The potassium\r\nsulphate formed would possibly settle to the bottom, and if the \"greasy\r\nmatter\" were simply organic impurities, they might be burned off. This\r\nmethod of refining appears to have been copied from Biringuccio (X., 1),\r\nwho states it in almost identical terms.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTE.--As mentioned in Note 6 above, it is quite possible\r\nthat the Ancients did include efflorescence of walls under _nitrum_;\r\nbut, so far as we are aware, no specific mention of such an occurrence\r\nof _nitrum_ is given, and, as stated before, there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that all the substances under that term were soda and potash.\r\nEspecially the frequent mention of the preparation of _nitrum_ by way of\r\nburning, argues strongly against saltpetre being included, as they would\r\nhardly have failed to notice the decrepitation. Argument has been put\r\nforward that Greek fire contained saltpetre, but it amounts to nothing\r\nmore than argument, for in those receipts preserved, no salt of any kind\r\nis mentioned. It is most likely that the leprosy of house-walls of the\r\nMosaic code (Leviticus XIV., 34 to 53) was saltpetre efflorescence. The\r\ndrastic treatment by way of destruction of such \"unclean\" walls and\r\nhouses, however, is sufficient evidence that this salt was not used. The\r\nfirst certain mention of saltpetre (_sal petrae_) is in Geber. As stated\r\nbefore, the date of this work is uncertain; in any event it was probably\r\nas early as the 13th Century. He describes the making of \"solvative\r\nwater\" with alum and saltpetre, so there can be no doubt as to the\r\nsubstance (see Note on p. 460, on nitric acid). There is also a work by\r\na nebulous Marcus Graecus, where the word _sal petrosum_ is used. And it\r\nappears that Roger Bacon (died 1294) and Albertus Magnus (died 1280)\r\nboth had access to that work. Bacon uses the term _sal petrae_\r\nfrequently enough, and was the first to describe gunpowder (_De Mirabili\r\nPotestate Artis et Naturae_ 1242). He gives no mention of the method of\r\nmaking his _sal petrae_. Agricola uses throughout the Latin text the\r\nterm _halinitrum_, a word he appears to have coined himself. However, he\r\ngives its German equivalent in the _Interpretatio_ as _salpeter_. The\r\nonly previous description of the method of making saltpetre, of which we\r\nare aware, is that of Biringuccio (1540), who mentions the boiling of\r\nthe excrescences from walls, and also says a good deal about boiling\r\nsolutions from \"nitrous\" earth, which may or may not be of \"plantation\"\r\norigin. He also gives this same method of refining with sulphur. In any\r\nevent, this statement by Agricola is the first clear and complete\r\ndescription of the saltpetre \"plantations.\" Saltpetre was in great\r\ndemand in the Middle Ages for the manufacture of gunpowder, and the\r\nfirst record of that substance and of explosive weapons necessarily\r\ninvolves the knowledge of saltpetre. However, authentic mention of such\r\nweapons only begins early in the 14th Century. Among the earliest is an\r\nauthority to the Council of Twelve at Florence to appoint persons to\r\nmake cannon, etc., (1326), references to cannon in the stores of the\r\nTower of London, 1388, &c.\r\n\r\n[10] There are three methods of manufacturing alum described by\r\nAgricola, the first and third apparently from shales, and the second\r\nfrom alum rock or \"alunite.\" The reasons for assuming that the first\r\nprocess was from shales, are the reference to the \"aluminous earth\" as\r\nore (_venae_) coming from \"veins,\" and also the mixture of vitriol. In\r\nthis process the free sulphuric acid formed by the oxidation of pyrites\r\nreacts upon the argillaceous material to form aluminium sulphate. The\r\ndecomposed ore is then placed in tanks and lixiviated. The solution\r\nwould contain aluminium sulphate, vitriol, and other impurities. By the\r\naddition of urine, the aluminium sulphate would be converted into\r\nammonia alum. Agricola is, of course, mistaken as to the effect of the\r\naddition, being under the belief that it separated the vitriol from the\r\nalum; in fact, this belief was general until the latter part of the 18th\r\nCentury, when Lavoisier determined that alum must have an alkali base.\r\nNor is it clear from this description exactly how they were separated.\r\nIn a condensed solution allowed to cool, the alum would precipitate out\r\nas \"alum meal,\" and the vitriol would \"float on top\"--in solution. The\r\nreference to \"meal\" may represent this phenomenon, and the re-boiling\r\nreferred to would be the normal method of purification by\r\ncrystallization. The \"asbestos\" and gypsum deposited in the caldrons\r\nwere no doubt feathery and mealy calcium sulphate. The alum produced\r\nwould, in any event, be mostly ammonia alum.\r\n\r\nThe second process is certainly the manufacture from \"alum rock\" or\r\n\"alunite\" (the hydrous sulphate of aluminium and potassium), such as\r\nthat mined at La Tolfa in the Papal States, where the process has been\r\nfor centuries identical with that here described. The alum there\r\nproduced is the double basic potassium alum, and crystallizes into cubes\r\ninstead of octahedra, _i.e._, the Roman alum of commerce. The presence\r\nof much ferric oxide gives the rose colour referred to by Agricola. This\r\naccount is almost identical with that of Biringuccio (II., 4), and it\r\nappears from similarity of details that Agricola, as stated in his\r\npreface, must have \"refreshed his mind\" from this description; it would\r\nalso appear from the preface that he had himself visited the locality.\r\n\r\nThe third process is essentially the same as the first, except that the\r\ndecomposition of the pyrites was hastened by roasting. The following\r\nobscure statement of some interest occurs in Agricola's _De Natura\r\nFossilium_, p. 209:--\"... alum is made from vitriol, for when oil is\r\nmade from the latter, alum is distilled out (_expirat_). This absorbs\r\nthe clay which is used in cementing glass, and when the operation is\r\ncomplete the clay is macerated with pure water, and the alum is soon\r\nafterward deposited in the shape of small cubes.\" Assuming the oil of\r\nvitriol to be sulphuric acid and the clay \"used in cementing glass\" to\r\nbe kaolin, we have here the first suggestion of a method for producing\r\nalum which came into use long after.\r\n\r\n\"Burnt alum\" (_alumen coctum_).--Agricola frequently uses this\r\nexpression, and on p. 568, describes the operation, and the substance is\r\napparently the same as modern dehydrated alum, often referred to as\r\n\"burnt alum.\"\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTES.--Whether the Ancients knew of alum in the modern sense\r\nis a most vexed question. The Greeks refer to a certain substance as\r\n_stypteria_, and the Romans refer to this same substance as _alumen_.\r\nThere can be no question as to their knowledge and common use of\r\nvitriol, nor that substances which they believed were entirely different\r\nfrom vitriol were comprised under the above names. Beckmann (Hist. of\r\nInventions, Vol. I., p. 181) seems to have been the founder of the\r\ndoctrine that the ancient _alumen_ was vitriol, and scores of\r\nauthorities seem to have adopted his arguments without inquiry, until\r\nthat belief is now general. One of the strongest reasons put forward was\r\nthat alum does not occur native in appreciable quantities. Apart from\r\nthe fact that the weight of this argument has been lost by the discovery\r\nthat alum does occur in nature to some extent as an aftermath of\r\nvolcanic action, and as an efflorescence from argillaceous rocks, we see\r\nno reason why the Ancients may not have prepared it artificially. One of\r\nthe earliest mentions of such a substance is by Herodotus (II., 180) of\r\na thousand talents of _stypteria_, sent by Amasis from Egypt as a\r\ncontribution to the rebuilding of the temple of Delphi. Diodorus (V., 1)\r\nmentions the abundance which was secured from the Lipari Islands\r\n(Stromboli, etc.), and a small quantity from the Isle of Melos.\r\nDioscorides (V., 82) mentions Egypt, Lipari Islands, Melos, Sardinia,\r\nArmenia, etc., \"and generally in any other places where one finds red\r\nochre (_rubrica_).\" Pliny (XXXV., 52) gives these same localities, and\r\nis more explicit as to how it originates--\"from an earthy water which\r\nexudes from the earth.\" Of these localities, the Lipari Islands\r\n(Stromboli, etc.), and Melos are volcanic enough, and both Lipari and\r\nMelos are now known to produce natural alum (Dana. Syst. Min., p. 95;\r\nand Tournefort, \"_Relation d'un voyage du Levant_.\" London, 1717,\r\n_Lettre_ IV., Vol. 1.). Further, the hair-like alum of Dioscorides,\r\nrepeated by Pliny below, was quite conceivably fibrous _kalinite_,\r\nnative potash alum, which occurs commonly as an efflorescence. Be the\r\nquestion of native alum as it may--and vitriol is not much more\r\ncommon--our own view that the ancient _alumen_ was alum, is equally\r\nbased upon the artificial product. Before entering upon the subject, we\r\nconsider it desirable to set out the properties of the ancient\r\nsubstance, a complete review of which is given by Pliny (XXXV., 52), he\r\nobviously quoting also from Dioscorides, which, therefore, we do not\r\nneed to reproduce. Pliny says:--\r\n\r\n\"Not less important, or indeed dissimilar, are the uses made of\r\n_alumen_; by which name is understood a sort of salty earth. Of this,\r\nthere are several kinds. In Cyprus there is a white _alumen_, and a\r\ndarker kind. There is not a great difference in their colour, though the\r\nuses made of them are very dissimilar,--the white _alumen_ being\r\nemployed in a liquid state for dyeing wool bright colours, and the\r\ndark-coloured _alumen_, on the other hand, for giving wool a sombre\r\ntint. Gold is purified with black _alumen_. Every kind of _alumen_ is\r\nfrom a _limus_ water which exudes from the earth. The collection of it\r\ncommences in winter, and it is dried by the summer sun. That portion of\r\nit which first matures is the whitest. It is obtained in Spain, Egypt,\r\nArmenia, Macedonia, Pontus, Africa, and the islands of Sardinia, Melos,\r\nLipari, and Strongyle; the most esteemed, however, is that of Egypt, the\r\nnext best from Melos. Of this last there are two kinds, the liquid\r\n_alumen_, and the solid. Liquid _alumen_, to be good, should be of a\r\nlimpid and milky appearance; when rubbed, it should be without\r\nroughness, and should give a little heat. This is called _phorimon_. The\r\nmode of detecting whether it has been adulterated is by pomegranate\r\njuice, for, if genuine, the mixture turns black. The other, or solid, is\r\npale and rough and turns dark with nut-galls; for which reason it is\r\ncalled _paraphoron_. Liquid _alumen_ is naturally astringent,\r\nindurative, and corrosive; used in combination with honey, it heals\r\nulcerations.... There is one kind of solid _alumen_, called by the\r\nGreeks _schistos_, which splits into filaments of a whitish colour; for\r\nwhich reason some prefer calling it _trichitis_ (hair like). _Alumen_ is\r\nproduced from the stone _chalcitis_, from which copper is also made,\r\nbeing a sort of coagulated scum from that stone. This kind of _alumen_\r\nis less astringent than the others, and is less useful as a check upon\r\nbad humours of the body.... The mode of preparing it is to cook it in a\r\npan until it has ceased being a liquid. There is another variety of\r\n_alumen_ also, of a less active nature, called _strongyle_. It is of two\r\nkinds. The fungous, which easily dissolves, is utterly condemned. The\r\nbetter kind is the pumice-like kind, full of small holes like a sponge,\r\nand is in round pieces, more nearly white in colour, somewhat greasy,\r\nfree from grit, friable, and does not stain black. This last kind is\r\ncooked by itself upon charcoal until it is reduced to pure ashes. The\r\nbest kind of all is that called _melinum_, from the Isle of Melos, as I\r\nhave said, none being more effectual as an astringent, for staining\r\nblack, and for indurating, and none becomes more dry.... Above all other\r\nproperties of _alumen_ is its remarkable astringency, whence its Greek\r\nname.... It is injected for dysentry and employed as a gargle.\" The\r\nlines omitted refer entirely to medical matters which have no bearing\r\nhere. The following paragraph (often overlooked) from Pliny (XXXV., 42)\r\nalso has an important bearing upon the subject:--\"In Egypt they employ a\r\nwonderful method of dyeing. The white cloth, after it is pressed, is\r\nstained in various places, not with dye stuffs, but with substances\r\nwhich absorb colours. These applications are not apparent on the cloth,\r\nbut when it is immersed in a caldron of hot dye it is removed the next\r\nmoment brightly coloured. The remarkable circumstance is that although\r\nthere be only one dye in the caldron yet different colours appear in the\r\ncloth.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from Pliny's description above, and also from the making\r\nof vitriol (see Note 11, p. 572), that this substance was obtained from\r\nliquor resulting from natural or artificial lixiviation of rocks--in the\r\ncase of vitriols undoubtedly the result of decomposition of pyritiferous\r\nrocks (such as _chalcitis_). Such liquors are bound to contain aluminum\r\nsulphate if there is any earth or clay about, and whether they contained\r\nalum would be a question of an alkali being present. If no alkali were\r\npresent in this liquor, vitriol would crystallize out first, and\r\nsubsequent condensation would yield aluminum sulphate. If alkali were\r\npresent, the alum would crystallize out either before or with the\r\nvitriol. Pliny's remark, \"that portion of it which first matures is\r\nwhitest\", agrees well enough with this hypothesis. No one will doubt\r\nthat some of the properties mentioned above belong peculiarly to\r\nvitriol, but equally convincing are properties and uses that belong to\r\nalum alone. The strongly astringent taste, white colour, and injection\r\nfor dysentry, are more peculiar to alum than to vitriol. But above all\r\nother properties is that displayed in dyeing, for certainly if we read\r\nthis last quotation from Pliny in conjunction with the statement that\r\nwhite _alumen_ produces bright colours and the dark kind, sombre\r\ncolours, we have the exact reactions of alum and vitriol when used as\r\nmordants. Therefore, our view is that the ancient salt of this character\r\nwas a more or less impure mixture ranging from alum to vitriol--\"the\r\nwhiter the better.\" Further, considering the ancient knowledge of soda\r\n(_nitrum_), and the habit of mixing it into almost everything, it does\r\nnot require much flight of imagination to conceive its admixture to the\r\n\"water,\" and the absolute production of alum.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the confusion between alum and vitriol among the\r\nAncients, it appears that by the time of the works attributed to Geber\r\n(12th or 13th Century), the difference was well known. His work\r\n(_Investigationes perfectiones_, IV.) refers to _alumen glaciale_ and\r\n_alumen jameni_ as distinguished from vitriol, and gives characteristic\r\nreactions which can leave no doubt as to the distinction. We may remark\r\nhere that the repeated statement apparently arising from Meyer (History\r\nof Chemistry, p. 51) that Geber used the term _alum de rocca_ is untrue,\r\nthis term not appearing in the early Latin translations. During the 15th\r\nCentury alum did come to be known in Europe as _alum de rocca_. Various\r\nattempts have been made to explain the origin of this term, ranging from\r\nthe Italian root, a \"rock,\" to the town of Rocca in Syria, where alum\r\nwas supposed to have been produced. In any event, the supply for a long\r\nperiod prior to the middle of the 15th Century came from Turkey, and the\r\norigin of the methods of manufacture described by Agricola, and used\r\ndown to the present day, must have come from the Orient.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the 15th Century, a large trade in alum was done\r\nbetween Italy and Asia Minor, and eventually various Italians\r\nestablished themselves near Constantinople and Smyrna for its\r\nmanufacture (Dudae, _Historia Byzantina Venetia_, 1729, p. 71). The alum\r\nwas secured by burning the rock, and lixiviation. With the capture of\r\nConstantinople by the Turks (1453), great feeling grew up in Italy over\r\nthe necessity of buying this requisite for their dyeing establishments\r\nfrom the infidel, and considerable exertion was made to find other\r\nsources of supply. Some minor works were attempted, but nothing much\r\neventuated until the appearance of one John de Castro. From the\r\nCommentaries of Pope Pius II. (1614, p. 185), it appears that this\r\nItalian had been engaged in dyeing cloth in Constantinople, and thus\r\nbecame aware of the methods of making alum. Driven out of that city\r\nthrough its capture by the Turks, he returned to Italy and obtained an\r\noffice under the Apostolic Chamber. While in this occupation he\r\ndiscovered a rock at Tolfa which appeared to him identical with that\r\nused at Constantinople in alum manufacture. After experimental work, he\r\nsought the aid of the Pope, which he obtained after much vicissitude.\r\nExperts were sent, who after examination \"shed tears of joy, they\r\nkneeling down three times, worshipped God and praised His kindness in\r\nconferring such a gift on their age.\" Castro was rewarded, and the great\r\npapal monopoly was gradually built upon this discovery. The industry\r\nfirmly established at Tolfa exists to the present day, and is the source\r\nof the Roman alum of commerce. The Pope maintained this monopoly\r\nstrenuously, by fair means and by excommunication, gradually advancing\r\nthe price until the consumers had greater complaint than against the\r\nTurks. The history of the disputes arising over the papal alum monopoly\r\nwould alone fill a volume.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the 15th Century alum was being made in Spain, Holland,\r\nand Germany, and later in England. In her efforts to encourage home\r\nindustries and escape the tribute to the Pope, Elizabeth (see Note on p.\r\n283) invited over \"certain foreign chymistes and mineral masters\" and\r\ngave them special grants to induce them to \"settle in these realmes.\"\r\nAmong them was Cornelius Devoz, to whom was granted the privilege of\r\n\"mining and digging in our Realm of England for allom and copperas.\"\r\nWhat Devoz accomplished is not recorded, but the first alum manufacture\r\non a considerable scale seems to have been in Yorkshire, by one Thomas\r\nChaloner (about 1608), who was supposed to have seduced workmen from the\r\nPope's alum works at Tolfa, for which he was duly cursed with all the\r\nweight of the Pope and Church. (Pennant, Tour of Scotland, 1786).\r\n\r\n[11] The term for vitriol used by the Roman authors, followed by\r\nAgricola, is _atramentum sutorium_, literally shoemaker's blacking, the\r\nterm no doubt arising from its ancient (and modern) use for blackening\r\nleather. The Greek term was _chalcanthon_. The term \"vitriol\" seems\r\nfirst to appear in Albertus Magnus (_De Mineralibus_, _Liber_ V.), who\r\ndied in 1280, where he uses the expression \"_atramentum viride a\r\nquibusdam vitreolum vocatur_.\" Agricola (_De Nat. Foss._, p. 213)\r\nstates, \"In recent years the name _vitriolum_ has been given to it.\" The\r\nfirst adequate description of vitriol is by Dioscorides (V., 76), as\r\nfollows:--\"Vitriol (_chalcanthon_) is of one genus, and is a solidified\r\nliquid, but it has three different species. One is formed from the\r\nliquids which trickle down drop by drop and congeal in certain mines;\r\ntherefore those who work in the Cyprian mines call it _stalactis_.\r\nPetesius calls this kind _pinarion_. The second kind is that which\r\ncollects in certain caverns; afterward it is poured into trenches, where\r\nit congeals, whence it derives its name _pectos_. The third kind is\r\ncalled _hephthon_ and is mostly made in Spain; it has a beautiful colour\r\nbut is weak. The manner of preparing it is as follows: dissolving it in\r\nwater, they boil it, and then they transfer it to cisterns and leave it\r\nto settle. After a certain number of days it congeals and separates into\r\nmany small pieces, having the form of dice, which stick together like\r\ngrapes. The most valued is blue, heavy, dense, and translucent.\" Pliny\r\n(XXXIV., 32) says:--\"By the name which they have given to it, the Greeks\r\nindicate the similar nature of copper and _atramentum sutorium_, for\r\nthey call it _chalcanthon_. There is no substance of an equally\r\nmiraculous nature. It is made in Spain from wells of this kind of water.\r\nThis water is boiled with an equal quantity of pure water, and is then\r\npoured into wooden tanks (fish ponds). Across these tanks there are\r\nfixed beams, to which hang cords stretched by little stones. Upon these\r\ncords adheres the _limus_ (Agricola's 'juice') in drops of a vitreous\r\nappearance, somewhat resembling a bunch of grapes. After removal, it is\r\ndried for thirty days. It is of a blue colour, and of a brilliant\r\nlustre, and is very like glass. Its solution is the blacking used for\r\ncolouring leather. _Chalcanthon_ is made in many other ways: its kind of\r\nearth is sometimes dug from ditches, from the sides of which exude\r\ndrops, which solidify by the winter frosts into icicles, called\r\n_stalagmia_, and there is none more pure. When its colour is nearly\r\nwhite, with a slight tinge of violet, it is called _leukoion_. It is\r\nalso made in rock basins, the rain water collecting the _limus_ into\r\nthem, where it becomes hardened. It is also made in the same way as salt\r\nby the intense heat of the sun. Hence it is that some distinguish two\r\nkinds, the mineral and the artificial; the latter being paler than the\r\nformer and as much inferior to it in quality as it is in colour.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Pliny gives prominence to blue vitriol, his solution for colouring\r\nleather must have been the iron sulphate. There can be no doubt from the\r\nabove, however, that both iron and copper sulphates were known to the\r\nAncients. From the methods for making vitriol given here in _De Re\r\nMetallica_, it is evident that only the iron sulphate would be produced,\r\nfor the introduction of iron strips into the vats would effectually\r\nprecipitate any copper. It is our belief that generally throughout this\r\nwork, the iron sulphate is meant by the term _atramentum sutorium_. In\r\n_De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 213-15) Agricola gives three varieties of\r\n_atramentum sutorium_,--_viride_, _caeruleum_, and _candidum_, _i.e._,\r\ngreen, blue, and white. Thus the first mention of white vitriol (zinc\r\nsulphate) appears to be due to him, and he states further (p. 213): \"A\r\nwhite sort is found, especially at Goslar, in the shape of icicles,\r\ntransparent like crystals.\" And on p. 215: \"Since I have explained the\r\nnature of vitriol and its relatives, which are obtained from cupriferous\r\npyrites, I will next speak of an acrid solidified juice which commonly\r\ncomes from _cadmia_. It is found at Annaberg in the tunnel driven to the\r\nSaint Otto mine; it is hard and white, and so acrid that it kills mice,\r\ncrickets, and every kind of animal. However, that feathery substance\r\nwhich oozes out from the mountain rocks and the thick substance found\r\nhanging in tunnels and caves from which saltpetre is made, while\r\nfrequently acrid, does not come from _cadmia_.\" Dana (Syst. of Min., p.\r\n939) identifies this as _Goslarite_--native zinc sulphate. It does not\r\nappear, however, that artificial zinc vitriol was made in Agricola's\r\ntime. Schlueter (_Huette-Werken_, Braunschweig 1738, p. 597) states it to\r\nhave been made for the first time at Rammelsberg about 1570.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable here to enquire into the nature of the substances given\r\nby all of the old mineralogists under the Latinized Greek terms\r\n_chalcitis_, _misy_, _sory_, and _melanteria_. The first mention of\r\nthese minerals is in Dioscorides, who (V., 75-77) says: \"The best\r\n_chalcitis_ is like copper. It is friable, not stony, and is intersected\r\nby long brilliant veins.... _Misy_ is obtained from Cyprus; it should\r\nhave the appearance of gold, be hard, and when pulverised it should have\r\nthe colour of gold and sparkle like stars. It has the same properties as\r\n_chalcitis_.... The best is from Egypt.... One kind of _melanteria_\r\ncongeals like salt in the entries to copper mines. The other kind is\r\nearthy and appears on the surface of the aforesaid mines. It is found in\r\nthe mines of Cilicia and other regions. The best has the colour of\r\nsulphur, is smooth, pure, homogenous, and upon contact with water\r\nimmediately becomes black.... Those who consider _sory_ to be the same\r\nas _melanteria_, err greatly. _Sory_ is a species of its own, though it\r\nis not dissimilar. The smell of _sory_ is oppressive and provokes\r\nnausea. It is found in Egypt and in other regions, as Libya, Spain, and\r\nCyprus. The best is from Egypt, and when broken is black, porous,\r\ngreasy, and astringent.\" Pliny (XXXIV., 29-31) says:--\"That is called\r\n_chalcitis_ from which, as well as itself copper (?) is extracted by\r\nheat. It differs from _cadmia_ in that this is obtained from rocks near\r\nthe surface, while that is taken from rocks below the surface. Also\r\n_chalcitis_ is immediately friable, being naturally so soft as to appear\r\nlike compressed wool. There is also this other distinction; _chalcitis_\r\ncontains three other substances, copper, _misy_, and _sory_. Of each of\r\nthese we shall speak in their appropriate places. It contains elongated\r\ncopper veins. The most approved kind is of the colour of honey; it is\r\nstreaked with fine sinuous veins and is friable and not stony. It is\r\nconsidered most valuable when fresh.... The _sory_ of Egypt is the most\r\nesteemed, being much superior to that of Cyprus, Spain, and Africa;\r\nalthough some prefer the _sory_ from Cyprus for affections of the eyes.\r\nBut from whatever nation it comes, the best is that which has the\r\nstrongest odour, and which, when ground up, becomes greasy, black, and\r\nspongy. It is a substance so unpleasant to the stomach that some persons\r\nare nauseated by its smell. Some say that _misy_ is made by the burning\r\nof stones in trenches, its fine yellow powder being mixed with the ashes\r\nof pine-wood. The truth is, as I said above, that though obtained from\r\nthe stone, it is already made and in solid masses, which require force\r\nto detach them. The best comes from the works of Cyprus, its\r\ncharacteristics being that when broken it sparkles like gold, and when\r\nground it presents a sandy appearance, but on the contrary, if heated,\r\nit is similar to _chalcitis_. _Misy_ is used in refining gold....\"\r\n\r\nAgricola's views on the subject appear in _De Natura Fossilium_. He says\r\n(p. 212):--\"The cupriferous pyrites (_pyrites aerosus_) called\r\n_chalcitis_ is the mother and cause of _sory_--which is likewise known\r\nas mine _vitriol_ (_atramentum metallicum_)--and _melanteria_. These in\r\nturn yield vitriol and such related things. This may be seen especially\r\nat Goslar, where the nodular lumps of dark grey colour are called\r\nvitriol stone (_lapis atramenti_). In the centre of them is found\r\ngreyish pyrites, almost dissolved, the size of a walnut. It is enclosed\r\non all sides, sometimes by _sory_, sometimes by _melanteria_. From them\r\nstart little veinlets of greenish vitriol which spread all over it,\r\npresenting somewhat the appearance of hairs extending in all directions\r\nand cohering together.... There are five species of this solidified\r\njuice, _melanteria_, _sory_, _chalcitis_, _misy_, and vitriol. Sometimes\r\nmany are found in one place, sometimes all of them, for one originates\r\nfrom the other. From pyrites, which is, as one might say, the root of\r\nall these juices, originates the above-mentioned _sory_ and\r\n_melanteria_. From _sory_, _chalcitis_, and _melanteria_ originate the\r\nvarious kinds of vitriol.... _Sory_, _melanteria_, _chalcitis_, and\r\n_misy_ are always native; vitriol alone is either native or artificial.\r\nFrom them vitriol effloresces white, and sometimes green or blue. _Misy_\r\neffloresces not only from _sory_, _melanteria_, and _chalcitis_, but\r\nalso from all the vitriols, artificial as well as natural.... _Sory_ and\r\n_melanteria_ differ somewhat from the others, but they are of the same\r\ncolours, grey and black; but _chalcitis_ is red and copper-coloured;\r\n_misy_ is yellow or gold-coloured. All these native varieties have the\r\nodour of lightning (brimstone), but _sory_ is the most powerful. The\r\nfeathery vitriol is soft and fine and hair-like, and _melanteria_ has\r\nthe appearance of wool and it has a similarity to salt; all these are\r\nrare and light; _sory_, _chalcitis_, and _misy_ have the following\r\nrelations. _Sory_ because of its density has the hardness of stone,\r\nalthough its texture is very coarse. _Misy_ has a very fine texture.\r\n_Chalcitis_ is between the two; because of its roughness and strong\r\nodour it differs from _melanteria_, although they do not differ in\r\ncolour. The vitriols, whether natural or artificial, are hard and dense\r\n... as regarding shape, _sory_, _chalcitis_, _misy_, and _melanteria_\r\nare nodular, but _sory_ is occasionally porous, which is peculiar to it.\r\n_Misy_ when it effloresces in no great quantity from the others is like\r\na kind of pollen, otherwise it is nodular. _Melanteria_ sometimes\r\nresembles wool, sometimes salt.\"\r\n\r\nThe sum and substance, therefore, appears to be that _misy_ is a\r\nyellowish material, possibly ochre, and _sory_ a blackish stone, both\r\nimpregnated with vitriol. _Chalcitis_ is a partially decomposed pyrites;\r\nand _melanteria_ is no doubt native vitriol. From this last term comes\r\nthe modern _melanterite_, native hydrous ferrous sulphate. Dana (System\r\nof Mineralogy, p. 964) considers _misy_ to be in part _copiapite_--basic\r\nferric sulphate--but any such part would not come under Agricola's\r\nobjection to it as a source of vitriol. The disabilities of this and\r\n_chalcitis_ may, however, be due to their copper content.\r\n\r\n[12] Agricola (_De Nat. Fos._, 221) says:--\"There is a species of\r\nartificial sulphur made from sulphur and iron hammer-scales, melted\r\ntogether and poured into moulds. This, because it heals scabs of horses,\r\nis generally called _caballinum_.\" It is difficult to believe such a\r\ncombination was other than iron sulphide, but it is equally difficult to\r\nunderstand how it was serviceable for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[13] Inasmuch as pyrites is discussed in the next paragraph, the\r\nmaterial of the first distillation appears to be native sulphur. Until\r\nthe receiving pots became heated above the melting point of the sulphur,\r\nthe product would be \"flowers of sulphur,\" and not the wax-like product.\r\nThe equipment described for pyrites in the next paragraph would be\r\nobviously useful only for coarse material.\r\n\r\nBut little can be said on the history of sulphur; it is mentioned often\r\nenough in the Bible and also by Homer (Od. XXII., 481). The Greeks\r\napparently knew how to refine it, although neither Dioscorides nor Pliny\r\nspecifically describes such an operation. Agricola says (_De Nat. Fos._,\r\n220): \"Sulphur is of two kinds; the mineral, which the Latins call\r\n_vivum_, and the Greeks _apyron_, which means 'not exposed to the fire'\r\n(_ignem non expertum_) as rightly interpreted by Celsius; and the\r\nartificial, called by the Greeks _pepyromenon_, that is, 'exposed to the\r\nfire.'\" In Book X., the expression _sulfur ignem non expertum_\r\nfrequently appears, no doubt in Agricola's mind for native sulphur,\r\nalthough it is quite possible that the Greek distinction was between\r\n\"flowers\" of sulphur and the \"wax-like\" variety.\r\n\r\n[14] The substances referred to under the names _bitumen_, _asphalt_,\r\n_maltha_, _naphtha_, _petroleum_, _rock-oil_, etc., have been known and\r\nused from most ancient times, and much of our modern nomenclature is of\r\nactual Greek and Roman ancestry. These peoples distinguished three\r\nrelated substances,--the Greek _asphaltos_ and Roman _bitumen_ for the\r\nhard material,--Greek _pissasphaltos_ and Roman _maltha_ for the\r\nviscous, pitchy variety--and occasionally the Greek _naphtha_ and Roman\r\n_naphtha_ for petroleum proper, although it is often enough referred to\r\nas liquid _bitumen_ or liquid _asphaltos_. The term _petroleum_\r\napparently first appears in Agricola's _De Natura Fossilium_ (p. 222),\r\nwhere he says the \"oil of bitumen ... now called _petroleum_.\" Bitumen\r\nwas used by the Egyptians for embalming from pre-historic times, _i.e._,\r\nprior to 5000 B.C., the term \"mummy\" arising from the Persian word for\r\nbitumen, _mumiai_. It is mentioned in the tribute from Babylonia to\r\nThotmes III., who lived about 1500 B.C. (Wilkinson, Ancient Egyptians\r\nI., p. 397). The Egyptians, however, did not need to go further afield\r\nthan the Sinai Peninsula for abundant supplies. Bitumen is often cited\r\nas the real meaning of the \"slime\" mentioned in Genesis (XI., 3; XIV.,\r\n10), and used in building the Tower of Babel. There is no particular\r\nreason for this assumption, except the general association of Babel,\r\nBabylon, and Bitumen. However, the Hebrew word _sift_ for pitch or\r\nbitumen does occur as the cement used for Moses's bulrush cradle (Exodus\r\nII., 3), and Moses is generally accounted about 1300 B.C. Other attempts\r\nto connect Biblical reference to petroleum and bitumen revolve around\r\nJob XXIX., 6, Deut. XXXII., 13, Maccabees II., I, 18, Matthew V., 13,\r\nbut all require an unnecessary strain on the imagination.\r\n\r\nThe plentiful occurrence of bitumen throughout Asia Minor, and\r\nparticularly in the Valley of the Euphrates and in Persia, is the\r\nsubject of innumerable references by writers from Herodotus (484-424\r\nB.C.) down to the author of the company prospectus of recent months.\r\nHerodotus (I., 179) and Diodorus Siculus (I) state that the walls of\r\nBabylon were mortared with bitumen--a fact partially corroborated by\r\nmodern investigation. The following statement by Herodotus (VI., 119) is\r\nprobably the source from which Pliny drew the information which Agricola\r\nquotes above. In referring to a well at Ardericca, a place about 40\r\nmiles from ancient Susa, in Persia, Herodotus says:--\"For from the well\r\nthey get bitumen, salt, and oil, procuring it in the way that I will now\r\ndescribe: they draw with a swipe, and instead of a bucket they make use\r\nof the half of a wine-skin; with this the man dips and, after drawing,\r\npours the liquid into a reservoir, wherefrom it passes into another, and\r\nthere takes three different shapes. The salt and bitumen forthwith\r\ncollect and harden, while the oil is drawn off into casks. It is called\r\nby the Persians _rhadinace_, is black, and has an unpleasant smell.\"\r\n(Rawlinson's Trans. III., p. 409). The statement from Pliny (XXXI., 39)\r\nhere referred to by Agricola, reads:--\"It (salt) is made from water of\r\nwells poured into salt-pans. At Babylon the first condensed is a\r\nbituminous liquid like oil which is burned in lamps. When this is taken\r\noff, salt is found beneath. In Cappadocia also the water from both wells\r\nand springs is poured into salt-pans.\" When petroleum began to be used\r\nas an illuminant it is impossible to say. A passage in Aristotle's _De\r\nMirabilibus_ (127) is often quoted, but in reality it refers only to a\r\nburning spring, a phenomenon noted by many writers, but from which to\r\nits practical use is not a great step. The first really definite\r\nstatement as to the use of petroleum as an illuminant is Strabo's\r\nquotation (XVI., 1, 15) from Posidonius: \"Asphaltus is found in great\r\nabundance in Babylonia. Eratosthenes describes it as follows:--The\r\nliquid _asphaltus_, which is called _naphtha_, is found in Susa; the dry\r\nkind, which can be made solid, in Babylonia. There is a spring of it\r\nnear the Euphrates.... Others say that the liquid kind is also found in\r\nBabylonia.... The liquid kind, called _naphtha_, is of a singular\r\nnature. When it is brought near the fire, the fire catches it....\r\nPosidonius says that there are springs of _naphtha_ in Babylonia, some\r\nof which produce white, others black _naphtha_; the first of these, I\r\nmean white _naphtha_, which attracts flame, is liquid sulphur; the\r\nsecond or black _naphtha_ is liquid _asphaltus_, and is burnt in lamps\r\ninstead of oil.\" (Hamilton's Translation, Vol. III., p. 151).\r\nEratosthenes lived about 200 B.C., and Posidonius about 100 years later.\r\nDioscorides (I., 83), after discussing the usual sources of bitumen\r\nsays: \"It is found in a liquid state in Agrigentum in Sicily, flowing on\r\nstreams; they use it for lights in lanterns in place of oil. Those who\r\ncall the Sicilian kind oil are under a delusion, for it is agreed that\r\nit is a kind of liquid bitumen.\" Pliny adds nothing much new to the\r\nabove quotations, except in regard to these same springs (XXXV., 51)\r\nthat \"The inhabitants collect it on the panicles of reeds, to which it\r\nquickly adheres and they use it for burning in lamps instead of oil.\"\r\nAgricola (_De Natura Fossilium_, Book IV.) classifies petroleum, coal,\r\njet, and obsidian, camphor, and amber as varieties of bitumen, and\r\ndevotes much space to the refutation of the claims that the last two are\r\nof vegetable origin.\r\n\r\n[15] Agricola (_De Natura Fossilium_, p. 215) in discussing substances\r\nwhich originate from copper, gives among them green _chrysocolla_ (as\r\ndistinguished from borax, etc., see Note 8 above), and says: \"Native\r\n_chrysocolla_ originates in veins and veinlets, and is found mostly by\r\nitself like sand, or adhering to metallic substances, and when scraped\r\noff from this appears similar to its own sand. Occasionally it is so\r\nthin that very little can be scraped off. Or else it occurs in waters\r\nwhich, as I have said, wash these minerals, and afterward it settles as\r\na powder. At Neusohl in the Carpathians, green water flowing from an\r\nancient tunnel wears away this _chrysocolla_ with it. The water is\r\ncollected in thirty large reservoirs, where it deposits the\r\n_chrysocolla_ as a sediment, which they collect every year and\r\nsell,\"--as a pigment. This description of its occurrence would apply\r\nequally well to modern _chrysocolla_ or to malachite. The solution from\r\ncopper ores would deposit some sort of green incrustation, of carbonates\r\nmostly.\r\n\r\n[16] The statement in Pliny (XXXVI., 66) to which Agricola refers is as\r\nfollows: \"Then as ingenuity was not content with the mixing of _nitrum_,\r\nthey began the addition of _lapis magnes_, because of the belief that it\r\nattracts liquefied glass as well as iron. In a similar manner many kinds\r\nof brilliant stones began to be added to the melting, and then shells\r\nand fossil sand. Authors tell us that the glass of India is made of\r\nbroken crystal, and in consequence nothing can compare with it. Light\r\nand dry wood is used for fusing, _cyprium_ (copper?) and _nitrum_ being\r\nadded, particularly _nitrum_ from Ophir etc.\"\r\n\r\nA great deal of discussion has arisen over this passage, in connection\r\nwith what this _lapis magnes_ really was. Pliny (XXXVI., 25) describes\r\nthe lodestone under this term, but also says: \"There (in Ethiopia) also\r\nis _haematites magnes_, a stone of blood colour, which shows a red\r\ncolour if crushed, or of saffron. The _haematites_ has not the same\r\nproperty of attracting iron as _magnes_.\" Relying upon this sentence for\r\nan exception to the ordinary sort of _magnes_, and upon the impossible\r\nchemical reaction involved, most commentators have endeavoured to show\r\nthat lodestone was not the substance meant by Pliny, but manganese, and\r\nthus they find here the first knowledge of this mineral. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that Pliny assumed it to be the lodestone, and Agricola\r\nalso. Whether the latter had any independent knowledge on this point in\r\nglass-making or was merely quoting Pliny--which seems probable--we do\r\nnot know. In any event, Biringuccio, whose work preceded _De Re\r\nMetallica_ by fifteen years, does definitely mention manganese in this\r\nconnection. He dismisses this statement of Pliny with the remark (p.\r\n37-38): \"The Ancients wrote about lodestones, as Pliny states, and they\r\nmixed it together with _nitrum_ in their first efforts to make glass.\"\r\nThe following passage from this author (p. 36-37), however, is not only\r\nof interest in this connection, but also as possibly being the first\r\nspecific mention of manganese under its own name. Moreover, it has been\r\ngenerally overlooked in the many discussions of the subject. \"Of a\r\nsimilar nature (to _zaffir_) is also another mineral called _manganese_,\r\nwhich is found, besides in Germany, at the mountain of Viterbo in\r\nTuscany ... it is the colour of _ferrigno scuro_ (iron slag?). In\r\nmelting it one cannot obtain any metal ... but it gives a very fine\r\ncolour to glass, so that the glass workers use it in their pigments to\r\nsecure an azure colour.... It also has such a property that when put\r\ninto melted glass it cleanses it and makes it white, even if it were\r\ngreen or yellow. In a hot fire it goes off in a vapour like lead, and\r\nturns into ashes.\"\r\n\r\nTo enter competently into the discussion of the early history of\r\nglass-making would employ more space than can be given, and would lead\r\nbut to a sterile end. It is certain that the art was pre-Grecian, and\r\nthat the Egyptians were possessed of some knowledge of making and\r\nblowing it in the XI Dynasty (according to Petrie 3,500 B.C.), the wall\r\npainting at Beni Hassen, which represents glass-blowing, being\r\nattributed to that period. The remains of a glass factory at Tel el\r\nAmarna are believed to be of the XVIII Dynasty. (Petrie, 1,500 B.C.).\r\nThe art reached a very high state of development among the Greeks and\r\nRomans. No discussion of this subject omits Pliny's well-known story\r\n(XXXVI, 65), which we also add: \"The tradition is that a merchant ship\r\nladen with _nitrum_ being moored at this place, the merchants were\r\npreparing their meal on the beach, and not having stones to prop up\r\ntheir pots, they used lumps of _nitrum_ from the ship, which fused and\r\nmixed with the sands of the shore, and there flowed streams of a new\r\ntranslucent liquid, and thus was the origin of glass.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICOLA'S WORKS.\r\n\r\nGeorgius Agricola was not only the author of works on Mining and allied\r\nsubjects, usually associated with his name, but he also interested\r\nhimself to some extent in political and religious subjects. For\r\nconvenience in discussion we may, therefore, divide his writings on the\r\nbroad lines of (1) works on mining, geology, mineralogy, and allied\r\nsubjects; (2) works on other subjects, medical, religious, critical,\r\npolitical, and historical. In respect especially to the first division,\r\nand partially with regard to the others, we find three principal cases:\r\n(_a_) Works which can be authenticated in European libraries to-day;\r\n(_b_) references to editions of these in bibliographies, catalogues,\r\netc., which we have been unable to authenticate; and (_c_) references to\r\nworks either unpublished or lost. The following are the short titles of\r\nall of the published works which we have been able to find on the\r\nsubjects allied to mining, arranged according to their present\r\nimportance:--_De Re Metallica_, first edition, 1556; _De Natura\r\nFossilium_, first edition, 1546; _De Ortu et Causis Subterraneorum_,\r\nfirst edition, 1546; _Bermannus_, first edition, 1530; _Rerum\r\nMetallicarum Interpretatio_, first edition, 1546; _De Mensuris et\r\nPonderibus_, first edition, 1533; _De Precio Metallorum et Monetis_,\r\nfirst edition, 1550; _De Veteribus et Novis Metallis_, first edition,\r\n1546; _De Natura eorum quae Effluunt ex Terra_, first edition, 1546; _De\r\nAnimantibus Subterraneis_, first edition, 1549.\r\n\r\nOf the \"lost\" or unpublished works, on which there is some evidence, the\r\nfollowing are the most important:--_De Metallicis et Machinis_, _De Ortu\r\nMetallorum Defensio ad Jacobum Scheckium_, _De Jure et Legibus\r\nMetallicis_, _De Varia Temperie sive Constitutione Aeris_, _De Terrae\r\nMotu_, and _Commentariorum, Libri VI_.\r\n\r\nThe known published works upon other subjects are as follows:--Latin\r\nGrammar, first edition, 1520; Two Religious Tracts, first edition, 1522;\r\n_Galen_ (Joint Revision of Greek Text), first edition, 1525; _De Bello\r\nadversus Turcam_, first edition, 1528; _De Peste_, first edition, 1554.\r\n\r\nThe lost or partially completed works on subjects unrelated to mining,\r\nof which some trace has been found, are:--_De Medicatis Fontibus_, _De\r\nPutredine solidas partes_, etc., _Castigationes in Hippocratem_,\r\n_Typographia Mysnae et Toringiae_, _De Traditionibus Apostolicis_,\r\n_Oratio de rebus gestis Ernesti et Alberti_, _Ducum Saxoniae_.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF PRINCIPAL WORKS.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with the bibliographical detail, we consider it\r\ndesirable to review briefly the most important of the author's works on\r\nsubjects related to mining.\r\n\r\n_De Natura Fossilium._ This is the most important work of Agricola,\r\nexcepting _De Re Metallica_. It has always been printed in combination\r\nwith other works, and first appeared at Basel, 1546. This edition was\r\nconsiderably revised by the author, the amended edition being that of\r\n1558, which we have used in giving references. The work comprises ten\r\n\"books\" of a total of 217 folio pages. It is the first attempt at\r\nsystematic mineralogy, the minerals[1] being classified into (1)\r\n\"earths\" (clay, ochre, etc.), (2) \"stones properly so-called\" (gems,\r\nsemi-precious and unusual stones, as distinguished from rocks), (3)\r\n\"solidified juices\" (salt, vitriol, alum, etc.), (4) metals, and (5)\r\n\"compounds\" (homogeneous \"mixtures\" of simple substances, thus forming\r\nsuch minerals as galena, pyrite, etc.). In this classification Agricola\r\nendeavoured to find some fundamental basis, and therefore adopted\r\nsolubility, fusibility, odour, taste, etc., but any true classification\r\nwithout the atomic theory was, of course, impossible. However, he makes\r\na very creditable performance out of their properties and obvious\r\ncharacteristics. All of the external characteristics which we use to-day\r\nin discrimination, such as colour, hardness, lustre, etc., are\r\nenumerated, the origin of these being attributed to the proportions of\r\nthe Peripatetic elements and their binary properties. Dana, in his great\r\nwork[2], among some fourscore minerals which he identifies as having\r\nbeen described by Agricola and his predecessors, accredits a score to\r\nAgricola himself. It is our belief, however, that although in a few\r\ncases Agricola has been wrongly credited, there are still more of which\r\npriority in description might be assigned to him. While a greater number\r\nthan fourscore of so-called species are given by Agricola and his\r\npredecessors, many of these are, in our modern system, but varieties;\r\nfor instance, some eight or ten of the ancient species consist of one\r\nform or another of silica.\r\n\r\nBook I. is devoted to mineral characteristics--colour, brilliance,\r\ntaste, shape, hardness, etc., and to the classification of minerals;\r\nBook II., \"earths\"--clay, Lemnian earth, chalk, ochre, etc.; Book III.,\r\n\"solidified juices\"--salt, _nitrum_ (soda and potash), saltpetre, alum,\r\nvitriol, chrysocolla, _caeruleum_ (part azurite), orpiment, realgar, and\r\nsulphur; Book IV., camphor, bitumen, coal, bituminous shales, amber;\r\nBook V., lodestone, bloodstone, gypsum, talc, asbestos, mica, calamine,\r\nvarious fossils, geodes, emery, touchstones, pumice, fluorspar, and\r\nquartz; Book VI., gems and precious stones; Book VII., \"rocks\"--marble,\r\nserpentine, onyx, alabaster, limestone, etc.; Book VIII., metals--gold,\r\nsilver, quicksilver, copper, lead, tin, antimony, bismuth, iron, and\r\nalloys, such as electrum, brass, etc.; Book IX., various furnace\r\noperations, such as making brass, gilding, tinning, and products such as\r\nslags, furnace accretions, _pompholyx_ (zinc oxide), copper flowers,\r\nlitharge, hearth-lead, verdigris, white-lead, red-lead, etc.; Book X.,\r\n\"compounds,\" embracing the description of a number of recognisable\r\nsilver, copper, lead, quicksilver, iron, tin, antimony, and zinc\r\nminerals, many of which we set out more fully in Note 8, page 108.\r\n\r\n_De Ortu et Causis Subterraneorum._ This work also has always been\r\npublished in company with others. The first edition was printed at\r\nBasel, 1546; the second at Basel, 1558, which, being the edition\r\nrevised and added to by the author, has been used by us for reference.\r\nThere are five \"books,\" and in the main they contain Agricola's\r\nphilosophical views on geologic phenomena. The largest portion of the\r\nactual text is occupied with refutations of the ancient philosophers,\r\nthe alchemists, and the astrologers; and these portions, while they\r\nexhibit his ability in observation and in dialectics, make but dull\r\nreading. Those sections of the book which contain his own views,\r\nhowever, are of the utmost importance in the history of science, and we\r\nreproduce extensively the material relating to ore deposits in the\r\nfootnotes on pages 43 to 52. Briefly, Book I. is devoted to discussion\r\nof the origin and distribution of ground waters and juices. The latter\r\npart of this book and a portion of Book II. are devoted to the origin of\r\nsubterranean heat, which he assumes is in the main due to burning\r\nbitumen--a genus which with him embraced coal--and also, in a minor\r\ndegree, to friction of internal winds and to burning sulphur. The\r\nremainder of Book II. is mainly devoted to the discussion of\r\nsubterranean \"air\", \"vapour\", and \"exhalations\", and he conceives that\r\nvolcanic eruptions and earthquakes are due to their agency, and in these\r\nhypotheses he comes fairly close to the modern theory of eruptions from\r\nexplosions of steam. \"Vapour arises when the internal heat of the earth\r\nor some hidden fire burns earth which is moistened with vapour. When\r\nheat or subterranean fire meets with a great force of vapour which cold\r\nhas contracted and encompassed in every direction, then the vapour,\r\nfinding no outlet, tries to break through whatever is nearest to it, in\r\norder to give place to the insistent and urgent cold. Heat and cold\r\ncannot abide together in one place, but expel and drive each other out\r\nof it by turns\".\r\n\r\nAs he was, we believe, the first to recognise the fundamental agencies\r\nof mountain sculpture, we consider it is of sufficient interest to\r\nwarrant a reproduction of his views on this subject: \"Hills and\r\nmountains are produced by two forces, one of which is the power of\r\nwater, and the other the strength of the wind. There are three forces\r\nwhich loosen and demolish the mountains, for in this case, to the power\r\nof the water and the strength of the wind we must add the fire in the\r\ninterior of the earth. Now we can plainly see that a great abundance of\r\nwater produces mountains, for the torrents first of all wash out the\r\nsoft earth, next carry away the harder earth, and then roll down the\r\nrocks, and thus in a few years they excavate the plains or slopes to a\r\nconsiderable depth; this may be noticed in mountainous regions even by\r\nunskilled observers. By such excavation to a great depth through many\r\nages, there rises an immense eminence on each side. When an eminence has\r\nthus arisen, the earth rolls down, loosened by constant rain and split\r\naway by frost, and the rocks, unless they are exceedingly firm, since\r\ntheir seams are similarly softened by the damp, roll down into the\r\nexcavations below. This continues until the steep eminence is changed\r\ninto a slope. Each side of the excavation is said to be a mountain, just\r\nas the bottom is called a valley. Moreover, streams, and to a far\r\ngreater extent rivers, effect the same results by their rushing and\r\nwashing; for this reason they are frequently seen flowing either between\r\nvery high mountains which they have created, or close by the shore\r\nwhich borders them.... Nor did the hollow places which now contain the\r\nseas all formerly exist, nor yet the mountains which check and break\r\ntheir advance, but in many parts there was a level plain, until the\r\nforce of winds let loose upon it a tumultuous sea and a scathing tide.\r\nBy a similar process the impact of water entirely overthrows and\r\nflattens out hills and mountains. But these changes of local conditions,\r\nnumerous and important as they are, are not noticed by the common people\r\nto be taking place at the very moment when they are happening, because,\r\nthrough their antiquity, the time, place, and manner in which they began\r\nis far prior to human memory. The wind produces hills and mountains in\r\ntwo ways: either when set loose and free from bonds, it violently moves\r\nand agitates the sand; or else when, after having been driven into the\r\nhidden recesses of the earth by cold, as into a prison, it struggles\r\nwith a great effort to burst out. For hills and mountains are created in\r\nhot countries, whether they are situated by the sea coasts or in\r\ndistricts remote from the sea, by the force of winds; these no longer\r\nheld in check by the valleys, but set free, heap up the sand and dust,\r\nwhich they gather from all sides, to one spot, and a mass arises and\r\ngrows together. If time and space allow, it grows together and hardens,\r\nbut if it be not allowed (and in truth this is more often the case), the\r\nsame force again scatters the sand far and wide.... Then, on the other\r\nhand, an earthquake either rends and tears away part of a mountain, or\r\nengulfs and devours the whole mountain in some fearful chasm. In this\r\nway it is recorded the Cybotus was destroyed, and it is believed that\r\nwithin the memory of man an island under the rule of Denmark\r\ndisappeared. Historians tell us that Taygetus suffered a loss in this\r\nway, and that Therasia was swallowed up with the island of Thera. Thus\r\nit is clear that water and the powerful winds produce mountains, and\r\nalso scatter and destroy them. Fire only consumes them, and does not\r\nproduce at all, for part of the mountains--usually the inner part--takes\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\nThe major portion of Book III. is devoted to the origin of ore channels,\r\nwhich we reproduce at some length on page 47. In the latter part of Book\r\nIII., and in Books IV. and V., he discusses the principal divisions of\r\nthe mineral kingdom given in _De Natura Fossilium_, and the origin of\r\ntheir characteristics. It involves a large amount of what now appears\r\nfruitless tilting at the Peripatetics and the alchemists; but\r\nnevertheless, embracing, as Agricola did, the fundamental Aristotelian\r\nelements, he must needs find in these same elements and their\r\nsubordinate binary combinations cause for every variation in external\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n_Bermannus._ This, Agricola's first work in relation to mining, was\r\napparently first published at Basel, 1530. The work is in the form of a\r\ndialogue between \"Bermannus,\" who is described as a miner, mineralogist,\r\nand \"a student of mathematics and poetry,\" and \"Nicolaus Ancon\" and\r\n\"Johannes Naevius,\" both scholars and physicians. Ancon is supposed to\r\nbe of philosophical turn of mind and a student of Moorish literature,\r\nNaevius to be particularly learned in the writings of Dioscorides,\r\nPliny, Galen, etc. \"Bermannus\" was probably an adaptation by Agricola\r\nof the name of his friend Lorenz Berman, a prominent miner. The book is\r\nin the main devoted to a correlation of the minerals mentioned by the\r\nAncients with those found in the Saxon mines. This phase is interesting\r\nas indicating the natural trend of Agricola's scholastic mind when he\r\nfirst comes into contact with the sciences to which he devoted himself.\r\nThe book opens with a letter of commendation from Erasmus, of Rotterdam,\r\nand with the usual dedication and preface by the author. The three\r\nconversationalists are supposed to take walks among the mines and to\r\ndiscuss, incidentally, matters which come to their attention; therefore\r\nthe book has no systematic or logical arrangement. There are occasional\r\nstatements bearing on the history, management, titles, and methods used\r\nin the mines, and on mining lore generally. The mineralogical part,\r\nwhile of importance from the point of view of giving the first\r\ndescription of several minerals, is immensely improved upon in _De\r\nNatura Fossilium_, published 15 years later. It is of interest to find\r\nhere the first appearance of the names of many minerals which we have\r\nsince adopted from the German into our own nomenclature. Of importance\r\nis the first description of bismuth, although, as pointed out on page\r\n433, the metal had been mentioned before. In the revised collection of\r\ncollateral works published in 1558, the author makes many important\r\nchanges and adds some new material, but some of the later editions were\r\nmade from the unrevised older texts.\r\n\r\n_Rerum Metallicarum Interpretatio._ This list of German equivalents for\r\nLatin mineralogical terms was prepared by Agricola himself, and first\r\nappears in the 1546 collection of _De Ortu et Causis_, _De Natura\r\nFossilium_, etc., being repeated in all subsequent publications of these\r\nworks. It consists of some 500 Latin mineralogical and metallurgical\r\nterms, many of which are of Agricola's own coinage. It is of great help\r\nin translation and of great value in the study of mineralogic\r\nnomenclature.\r\n\r\n_De Mensuris et Ponderibus._ This work is devoted to a discussion of the\r\nGreek and Roman weights and measures, with some correlation to those\r\nused in Saxony. It is a careful work still much referred to by students\r\nof these subjects. The first edition was published at Paris in 1533, and\r\nin the 1550 edition at Basel appears, for the first time, _De Precio\r\nMetallorum et Monetis_.\r\n\r\n_De Veteribus et Novis Metallis._ This short work comprises 31 folio\r\npages, and first appears in the 1546 collection of collateral works. It\r\nconsists mainly of historical and geographical references to the\r\noccurrence of metals and mines, culled from the Greek and Latin\r\nclassics, together with some information as to the history of the mines\r\nin Central Europe. The latter is the only original material, and\r\nunfortunately is not very extensive. We have incorporated some of this\r\ninformation in the footnotes.\r\n\r\n_De Animantibus Subterraneis._ This short work was first printed in\r\nBasel, 1549, and consists of one chapter of 23 folio pages. Practically\r\nthe whole is devoted to the discussion of various animals who at least a\r\nportion of their time live underground, such as hibernating,\r\ncave-dwelling, and burrowing animals, together with cave-dwelling birds,\r\nlizards, crocodiles, serpents, etc. There are only a few lines of remote\r\ngeological interest as to migration of animals imposed by geologic\r\nphenomena, such as earthquakes, floods, etc. This book also discloses an\r\noccasional vein of credulity not to be expected from the author's other\r\nworks, in that he apparently believes Aristotle's story of the flies\r\nwhich were born and lived only in the smelting furnace; and further, the\r\nlast paragraph in the book is devoted to underground gnomes. This we\r\nreproduce in the footnote on page 217.\r\n\r\n_De Natura eorum quae Effluunt ex Terra._ This work of four books,\r\ncomprising 83 folio pages, first appears in the 1546 collection. As the\r\ntitle indicates, the discussion is upon the substances which flow from\r\nthe earth, such as water, bitumen, gases, etc. Altogether it is of\r\nmicroscopic value and wholly uninteresting. The major part refers to\r\ncolour, taste, temperature, medicinal uses of water, descriptions of\r\nrivers, lakes, swamps, and aqueducts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES.\r\n\r\nFor the following we have mainly to thank Miss Kathleen Schlesinger, who\r\nhas been employed many months in following up every clue, and although\r\nthe results display very considerable literary activity on the part of\r\nthe author, they do not by any means indicate Miss Schlesinger's\r\nlabours. Agricola's works were many of them published at various times\r\nin combination, and therefore to set out the title and the publication\r\nof each work separately would involve much repetition of titles, and we\r\nconsequently give the titles of the various volumes arranged according\r\nto dates. For instance, _De Natura Fossilium_, _De Ortu et Causis_, _De\r\nVeteribus et Novis Metallis_, _De Natura eorum quae Effluunt ex Terra_,\r\nand _Interpretatio_ have always been published together, and the Latin\r\nand Italian editions of these works always include _Bermannus_ as well.\r\nMoreover, the Latin _De Re Metallica_ of 1657 includes all of these\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nWe mark with an asterisk the titles to editions which we have been able\r\nto authenticate by various means from actual books. Those unmarked are\r\neditions which we are satisfied do exist, but the titles of which are\r\npossibly incomplete, as they are taken from library catalogues, etc.\r\nOther editions to which we find reference and of which we are not\r\ncertain are noted separately in the discussion later on.[3]\r\n\r\n*1530 (8vo):\r\n\r\n     _Georgii Agricolae Medici, Bermannus sive de re Metallica._\r\n\r\n     (Froben's mark).\r\n\r\n     _Basileae in aedibus Frobenianis Anno.

Unless otherwise convinced it is our belief that most of\r\nthese refer to the prints given above, and are due to error in giving\r\ntitles or dates. It is always possible that such prints do exist and\r\nhave escaped our search.\r\n\r\n_De Re Metallica._ Leupold, Richter, Schmid, van der Linden, Mercklinus\r\nand Eloy give an 8vo edition of _De Re Metallica_ without illustrations,\r\nSchweinfurt, 1607. We have found no trace of this print. Leupold, van\r\nder Linden, Richter, Schmid and Eloy mention an 8vo edition, Wittenberg,\r\n1614. It is our belief that this refers to the 1612 Wittenberg edition\r\nof the selected works, which contains a somewhat similar title referring\r\nin reality to _Bermannus_, which was and is still continually confused\r\nwith _De Re Metallica_. Ferguson mentions a German edition, Schweinfurt,\r\n8vo, 1687. We can find no trace of this; it may refer to the 1607\r\nSchweinfurt edition mentioned above.\r\n\r\n_De Natura Fossilium._ Leupold and Gatter refer to a folio edition of\r\n1550. This was probably an error for either the 1546 or the 1558\r\neditions. Watt refers to an edition of 1561 combined with _De Medicatis\r\nFontibus_. We find no trace of such edition, nor even that the latter\r\nwork was ever actually printed. He also refers to an edition of 1614 and\r\none of 1621, this probably being an error for the 1612 edition of the\r\nsubsidiary works and the _De Re Metallica_ of 1621. Leupold also refers\r\nto an edition of 1622, this probably being an error for 1612.\r\n\r\n_De Ortu et Causis._ Albinus, Hofmann, Jacobi, Schmid, Richter, and\r\nReuss mention an edition of 1544. This we believe to be an error in\r\ngiving the date of the dedication instead of that of the publication\r\n(1546). Albinus and Ferguson give an edition of 1555, which date is, we\r\nbelieve, an error for 1558. Ferguson gives an edition of the Italian\r\ntranslation as 1559; we believe this should be 1550. Draud gives an\r\nedition of 1621; probably this should be 1612.\r\n\r\n_Bermannus._ Albinus, Schmid, Reuss, Richter, and Weinart give the first\r\nedition as 1528. We have been unable to learn of any actual copy of that\r\ndate, and it is our belief that the date is taken from the dedication\r\ninstead of from the publication, and should be 1530. Leupold, Schmid,\r\nand Reuss give an edition by Froben in 1549; we have been unable to\r\nconfirm this. Leupold also gives an edition of 1550 (folio), and Joecher\r\ngives an edition of Geneva 1561 (folio); we have also been unable to\r\nfind this, and believe the latter to be a confusion with the _De Re\r\nMetallica_ of 1561, as it is unlikely that _Bermannus_ would be\r\npublished by itself in folio. The catalogue of the library at Siena\r\n(Vol. III., p. 78) gives _Il Bermanno, Vinegia_, 1550, 8vo. We have\r\nfound no trace of this edition elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_De Mensuris et Ponderibus._ Albinus and Schmid mention an edition of\r\n1539, and one of 1550. The Biographie Universelle, Paris, gives one of\r\n1553, and Leupold one of 1714, all of which we have been unable to find.\r\nAn epitome of this work was published at various times, sometimes in\r\nconnection with editions of Vitruvius; so far as we are aware on the\r\nfollowing dates, 1552, 1585, 1586, 1829. There also appear extracts in\r\nrelation to liquid measures in works entitled _Vocabula rei numariae\r\nponderum et mensurarum_, etc. Paul Eber and Caspar Peucer, _Lipsiae_,\r\n1549, and in same Wittenberg, 1552.\r\n\r\n_De Veteribus et Novis Metallis._ Watt gives an edition, Basel, 1530,\r\nand Paris, 1541; we believe this is incorrect and refers to _Bermannus_.\r\nReuss mentions a folio print of Basel, 1550. We consider this very\r\nunlikely.\r\n\r\n_De Natura eorum quae Effluunt ex Terra._ Albinus, Hofmann, Schmid,\r\nJacobi, Richter, Reuss, and Weinart give an edition of 1545. We believe\r\nthis is again the dedication instead of the publication date (1546).\r\n\r\n_De Animantibus Subterraneis._ Van der Linden gives an edition at\r\nSchweinfurt, 8vo, 1607. Although we have been unable to find a copy,\r\nthis slightly confirms the possibility of an octavo edition of _De Re\r\nMetallica_ of this date, as they were usually published together.\r\nLeupold gives assurance that he handled an octavo edition of Wittenberg,\r\n1612, _cum notis Johann Sigfridi_. We think he confused this with\r\n_Bermannus sive de re metallica_ of that date and place. Schmid,\r\nRichter, and Draud all refer to an edition similarly annotated, Leipzig,\r\n1613, 8vo. We have no trace of it otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNPUBLISHED WORKS ON SUBJECTS RELATED TO MINING.\r\n\r\nAgricola apparently projected a complete series of works covering the\r\nwhole range of subjects relating to minerals: geology, mineralogy,\r\nmining, metallurgy, history of metals, their uses, laws, etc. In a\r\nletter[5] from Fabricius to Meurer (March, 1553), the former states that\r\nAgricola intended writing about 30 books (chapters) in addition to those\r\nalready published, and to the twelve books _De Re Metallica_ which he\r\nwas about to publish. Apparently a number of these works were either\r\nunfinished or unpublished at Agricola's death, for his friend George\r\nFabricius seems to have made some effort to secure their publication,\r\nbut did not succeed, through lack of sympathy on the part of Agricola's\r\nfamily. Hofmann[6] states on this matter: \"His intentions were\r\nfrustrated mainly through the lack of support with which he was met by\r\nthe heirs of the Mineralogist. These, as he complains to a Councillor of\r\nthe Electorate, Christopher von Carlovitz, in 1556, and to Paul Eber in\r\nanother letter, adopted a grudging and ungracious tone with regard to\r\nhis proposal to collect all Agricola's works left behind, and they only\r\nconsented to communicate to him as much as they were obliged by express\r\ncommand of the Prince. At the Prince's command they showed him a little,\r\nbut he supposed that there was much more that they had suppressed or not\r\npreserved. The attempt to purchase some of the works--the Elector had\r\ngiven Fabricius money for the purpose (30 nummos unciales)--proved\r\nunavailing, owing to the disagreeableness of Agricola's heirs. It is no\r\ndoubt due to these regrettable circumstances that all the works of the\r\nindustrious scholar did not come down to us.\" The \"disagreeableness\" was\r\nprobably due to the refusal of the Protestant townsfolk to allow the\r\nburial of Agricola in the Cathedral at Chemnitz. So far as we know the\r\nfollowing are the unpublished or lost works.\r\n\r\n_De Jure et Legibus Metallicis._ This work on mining law is mentioned at\r\nthe end of Book IV. of _De Re Metallica_, and it is referred to by\r\nothers apparently from that source. We have been unable to find any\r\nevidence that it was ever published.\r\n\r\n_De Varia temperie sive Constitutione Aeris._ In a letter[7] to Johann\r\nNaevius, Agricola refers to having a work in hand of this title.\r\n\r\n_De Metallis et Machinis._ Hofmann[8] states that a work of this title\r\nby Agricola, dated Basel 1543, was sold to someone in America by a\r\nFrankfort-on-Main bookseller in 1896. This is apparently the only\r\nreference to it that we know of, and it is possibly a confusion of\r\ntitles or a \"separate\" of some chapters from _De Re Metallica_.\r\n\r\n_De Ortu Metallorum Defensio ad Jacobum Scheckium._ Referred to by\r\nFabricius in a letter[9] to Meurer. If published was probably only a\r\ntract.\r\n\r\n_De Terrae Motu._ In a letter[10] from Agricola to Meurer (Jan. 1, 1544)\r\nis some reference which might indicate that he was formulating a work on\r\nearthquakes under this title, or perhaps may be only incidental to the\r\nportions of _De Ortu et Causis_ dealing with this subject.\r\n\r\n_Commentariorum in quibus utriusque linguae scriptorum locos difficiles\r\nde rebus subterraneis explicat, Libri VI._ Agricola apparently partially\r\ncompleted a work under some such title as this, which was to embrace\r\nchapters entitled _De Methodis_ and _De Demonstratione_. The main object\r\nseems to have been a commentary on the terms and passages in the\r\nclassics relating to mining, mineralogy, etc. It is mentioned in the\r\nPreface of _De Veteribus et Novis Metallis_, and in a letter[11] from\r\none of Froben's firm to Agricola in 1548, where it is suggested that\r\nAgricola should defer sending his new commentaries until the following\r\nspring. The work is mentioned by Albinus[12], and in a letter from Georg\r\nFabricius to Meurer on the 2nd Jan. 1548,[13] in another from G.\r\nFabricius, to his brother Andreas on Oct. 28, 1555,[14] and in a third\r\nfrom Fabricius to Melanchthon on December 8th, 1555[15], in which regret\r\nis expressed that the work was not completed by Agricola.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITINGS NOT RELATED TO MINING, INCLUDING LOST OR UNPUBLISHED WORKS.\r\n\r\n_Latin Grammar._ This was probably the first of Agricola's publications,\r\nthe full title to which is _Georgii Agricolae Glaucii Libellus de prima\r\nac simplici institutione grammatica. Excusum Lipsiae in Officina\r\nMelchioris Lottheri. Anno MDXX._ (4to), 24 folios.[16] There is some\r\nreason to believe that Agricola also published a Greek grammar, for\r\nthere is a letter[17] from Agricola dated March 18th, 1522, in which\r\nHenicus Camitianus is requested to send a copy to Stephan Roth.\r\n\r\n_Theological Tracts._ There are preserved in the Zwickau Rathsschul\r\nLibrary[18] copies by Stephan Roth of two tracts, the one entitled,\r\n_Deum non esse auctorem Peccati_, the other, _Religioso patri Petri\r\nFontano, sacre theologie Doctori eximio Georgius Agricola salutem dicit\r\nin Christo_. The former was written from Leipzig in 1522, and the\r\nlatter, although not dated, is assigned to the same period. Both are\r\nprinted in _Zwei theologische Abhandlungen des Georg Agricola_, an\r\narticle by Otto Clemen, _Neuen Archiv fur Saechsische Geschichte_, etc.,\r\nDresden, 1900. There is some reason (from a letter of Fabricius to\r\nMelanchthon, Dec. 8th, 1555) to believe that Agricola had completed a\r\nwork on the unwritten traditions concerning the Church. There is no\r\nfurther trace of it.\r\n\r\n_Galen._ Agricola appears to have been joint author with Andreas\r\nAsulanus and J. B. Opizo of a revision of this well-known Greek work. It\r\nwas published at Venice in 1525, under the title of _Galeni Librorum_,\r\netc., etc. Agricola's name is mentioned in a prefatory letter to Opizo\r\nby Asulanus.\r\n\r\n_De Bello adversus Turcam._ This political tract, directed against the\r\nTurks, was written in Latin and first printed by Froben, Basel, 1528. It\r\nwas translated into German apparently by Agricola's friend Laurenz\r\nBerman, and published under the title _Oration Anrede Und Vormanunge ...\r\nwidder den Tuercken_ by Frederich Peypus, Nuremberg, in 1531 (8vo), and\r\neither in 1530 or 1531 by Wolfgang Stoeckel, Dresden, 4to. It was again\r\nprinted in Latin by Froben, Basel, 1538, 4to; by H. Grosius, Leipzig,\r\n1594, 8vo; it was included among other works published on the same\r\nsubject by Nicholas Reusnerus, Leipzig, 1595; by Michael Lantzenberger,\r\nFrankfurt-am-Main, 1597, 4to. Further, there is reference by Watt to an\r\nedition at Eisleben, 1603, of which we have no confirmation. There is\r\nanother work on the subject, or a revision by the author mentioned by\r\nAlbinus[19] as having been, after Agricola's death, sent to Froben by\r\nGeorge Fabricius to be printed; nothing further appears in this matter\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\n_De Peste._ This work on the Plague appears to have been first printed\r\nby Froben, Basel, 1554, 8vo. The work was republished at Schweinfurt,\r\n1607, and at Augsburg in 1614, under various editors. It would appear\r\nfrom Albinus[20] that the work was revised by Agricola and in Froben's\r\nhands for publication after the author's death.\r\n\r\n_De Medicatis Fontibus._ This work is referred to by Agricola himself in\r\n_De Natura Eorum_,[21] in the prefatory letter in _De Veteribus et Novis\r\nMetallis_; and Albinus[22] quotes a letter of Agricola to Sebastian\r\nMunster on the subject. Albinus states (_Bergchronik_, p. 193) that to\r\nhis knowledge it had not yet been published. Conrad Gesner, in his work\r\n_Excerptorum et observationum de Thermis_, which is reprinted in _De\r\nBalneis_, Venice, 1553, after Agricola's _De Natura Eorum_, states[23]\r\nconcerning Agricola _in libris quos de medicatis fontibus instituerit\r\ncopiosus se dicturum pollicetur_. Watt mentions it as having been\r\npublished in 1549, 1561, 1614, and 1621. He, however, apparently\r\nconfuses it with _De Natura Eorum_. We are unable to state whether it\r\nwas ever printed or not. A note of inquiry to the principal libraries in\r\nGermany gave a negative result.\r\n\r\n_De Putredine solidas partes humani corporis corrumpente._ This work,\r\naccording to Albinus was received by Fabricius a year after Agricola's\r\ndeath, but whether it was published or not is uncertain.[24]\r\n\r\n_Castigationes in Hippocratem et Galenum._ This work is referred to by\r\nAgricola in the preface of _Bermannus_, and Albinus[25] mentions several\r\nletters referring to the preparation of the work. There is no evidence\r\nof publication.\r\n\r\n_Typographia Mysnae et Toringiae._ It seems from Agricola's letter[26]\r\nto Munster that Agricola prepared some sort of a work on the history of\r\nSaxony and of the Royal Family thereof at the command of the Elector\r\nand sent it to him when finished, but it was never published as written\r\nby Agricola. Albinus, Hofmann, and Struve give some details of letters\r\nin reference to it. Fabricius in a letter[27] dated Nov. 11, 1536 asks\r\nMeurer to send Agricola some material for it; in a letter from Fabricius\r\nto Meurer dated Oct. 30, 1554, it appears that the Elector had granted\r\nAgricola 200 thalers to assist in the work. After Agricola's death the\r\nmaterial seems to have been handed over to Fabricius, who made use of it\r\n(as he states in the preface) in preparing the work he was commissioned\r\nby the Elector to write, the title of which was, _Originum\r\nillustrissimae stirpis Saxonicae Libri_, and was published in Leipzig,\r\n1597. It includes on page 880 a fragment of a work entitled _Oratio de\r\nrebus Gestis Ernesti et Alberti Ducum Saxoniae_, by Agricola.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS WRONGLY ATTRIBUTED TO GEORGIUS AGRICOLA.\r\n\r\nThe following works have been at one time or another wrongly attributed\r\nto Georgius Agricola:--\r\n\r\n_Galerazeya sive Revelator Secretorum De Lapide Philosophorum_, Cologne,\r\n1531 and 1534, by one Daniel Agricola, which is merely a controversial\r\nbook with a catch-title, used by Catholics for converting heretics.\r\n\r\n_Rechter Gebrauch der Alchimey_, a book of miscellaneous receipts which\r\ntreats very slightly of transmutation.[28]\r\n\r\n_Chronik der Stadt Freiberg_ by a Georg Agricola (died 1630), a preacher\r\nat Freiberg.\r\n\r\n_Dominatores Saxonici_, by the same author.\r\n\r\n_Breviarum de Asse_ by Guillaume Bude.\r\n\r\n_De Inventione Dialectica_ by Rudolph Agricola.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See footnote 4, page 1.\r\n\r\n[2] System of Mineralogy.\r\n\r\n[3] The following are the titles of the works referred to in this\r\ndiscussion:--\r\n\r\nPetrus Albinus: _Meissnische Land und Berg Chronica In welcher ein\r\nwollnstendige description des Landes_, etc., Dresden, 1590 (contains\r\npart I, _Commentatorium de Mysnia_). _Newe Chronica und Beschreibung des\r\nLandes zu Meissen_, pp. 1 to 449, besides preface and index, and Part\r\nII. _Meissnische Bergk Chronica_, Dresden, 1590, pp. 1 to 205, besides\r\npreface and index.\r\n\r\nAdam Daniel Richter: _Umstaendliche ...

References to these works in the footnotes may be most\r\neasily consulted through the personal index.\r\n\r\nGREEK AUTHORS.--Only a very limited Greek literature upon subjects\r\nallied to mining or natural science survives. The whole of the material\r\nof technical interest could be reproduced on less than twenty of these\r\npages. Those of most importance are: Aristotle (384-322 B.C.),\r\nTheophrastus (371-288 B.C.), Diodorus Siculus (1st Century B.C.), Strabo\r\n(64 B.C.-25 A.D.), and Dioscorides (1st Century A.D.).\r\n\r\nAristotle, apart from occasional mineralogical or metallurgical\r\nreferences in _De Mirabilibus_, is mostly of interest as the author of\r\nthe Peripatetic theory of the elements and the relation of these to the\r\norigin of stones and metals. Agricola was, to a considerable measure, a\r\nfollower of this school, and their views colour much of his writings.\r\nWe, however, discuss elsewhere[1] at what point he departed from them.\r\nEspecially in _De Ortu et Causis_ does he quote largely from Aristotle's\r\n_Meteorologica_, _Physica_, and _De Coelo_ on these subjects. There is a\r\nspurious work on stones attributed to Aristotle of some interest to\r\nmineralogists. It was probably the work of some Arab early in the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus, the principal disciple of Aristotle, appears to have\r\nwritten at least two works relating to our subject--one \"On Stones\", and\r\nthe other on metals, mining or metallurgy, but the latter is not extant.\r\nThe work \"On Stones\" was first printed in Venice in 1498, and the Greek\r\ntext, together with a fair English translation by Sir John Hill, was\r\npublished in London in 1746 under the title \"Theophrastus on Stones\";\r\nthe translation is, however, somewhat coloured with Hill's views on\r\nmineralogy. The work comprises 120 short paragraphs, and would, if\r\nreproduced, cover but about four of these pages. In the first paragraphs\r\nare the Peripatetic view of the origin of stones and minerals, and upon\r\nthe foundation of Aristotle he makes some modifications. The principal\r\ninterest in Theophrastus' work is the description of minerals; the\r\ninformation given is, however, such as might be possessed by any\r\nordinary workman, and betrays no particular abilities for natural\r\nphilosophy. He enumerates various exterior characteristics, such as\r\ncolour, tenacity, hardness, smoothness, density, fusibility, lustre, and\r\ntransparence, and their quality of reproduction, and then proceeds to\r\ndescribe various substances, but usually omits his enumerated\r\ncharacteristics. Apart from the then known metals and certain \"earths\"\r\n(ochre, marls, clay, etc.), it is possible to identify from his\r\ndescriptions the following rocks and minerals:--marble, pumice, onyx,\r\ngypsum, pyrites, coal, bitumen, amber, azurite, chrysocolla, realgar,\r\norpiment, cinnabar, quartz in various forms, lapis lazuli, emerald,\r\nsapphire, diamond, and ruby. Altogether there are some sixteen distinct\r\nmineral species. He also describes the touchstone and its uses, the\r\nmaking of white-lead and verdigris, and of quicksilver from cinnabar.\r\n\r\nDiodorus Siculus was a Greek native of Sicily. His \"historical library\"\r\nconsisted of some 40 books, of which parts of 15 are extant. The first\r\nprint was in Latin, 1472, and in Greek in 1539; the first translation\r\ninto English was by Thomas Stocker, London, 1568, and later by G. Booth,\r\n1700. We have relied upon Booth's translation, but with some amendments\r\nby friends, to gain more literal statement. Diodorus, so far as relates\r\nto our subject, gives merely the occasional note of a traveller. The\r\nmost interesting paragraphs are his quotation from Agatharchides on\r\nEgyptian mining and upon British tin.\r\n\r\nStrabo was also a geographer. His work consists of 17 books, and\r\npractically all survive. We have relied upon the most excellent\r\ntranslation of Hamilton and Falconer, London, 1903, the only one in\r\nEnglish. Mines and minerals did not escape such an acute geographer, and\r\nthe matters of greatest interest are those with relation to Spanish\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nDioscorides was a Greek physician who wrote entirely from the standpoint\r\nof materia medica, most of his work being devoted to herbs; but Book V.\r\nis devoted to minerals and rocks, and their preparation for medicinal\r\npurposes. The work has never been translated into English, and we have\r\nrelied upon the Latin translation of Matthioli, Venice, 1565, and notes\r\nupon the Greek text prepared for us by Mr. C. Katopodes. In addition to\r\nmost of the substances known before, he, so far as can be identified,\r\nadds schist, _cadmia_ (blende or calamine), _chalcitis_ (copper\r\nsulphide), _misy_, _melanteria_, _sory_ (copper or iron sulphide\r\noxidation minerals). He describes the making of certain artificial\r\nproducts, such as copper oxides, vitriol, litharge, _pompholyx_, and\r\n_spodos_ (zinc and/or arsenical oxides). His principal interest for us,\r\nhowever, lies in the processes set out for making his medicines.\r\n\r\nOccasional scraps of information relating to the metals or mines in some\r\nconnection are to be found in many other Greek writers, and in\r\nquotations by them from others which are not now extant, such as\r\nPolybius, Posidonius, etc. The poets occasionally throw a gleam of\r\nlight on ancient metallurgy, as for instance in Homer's description of\r\nVulcan's foundry; while the historians, philosophers, statesmen, and\r\nphysicians, among them Herodotus, Xenophon, Demosthenes, Galen, and many\r\nothers, have left some incidental references to the metals and mining,\r\nhelpful to gleaners from a field, which has been almost exhausted by\r\ntime. Even Archimedes made pumps, and Hero surveying instruments for\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS.--Pre-eminent among all ancient writers on these subjects\r\nis, of course, Pliny, and in fact, except some few lines by Vitruvius,\r\nthere is practically little else in extant Roman literature of technical\r\ninterest, for the metallurgical metaphors of the poets and orators were\r\nthreadbare by this time, and do not excite so much interest as upon\r\ntheir first appearance among the Greeks and Hebrews.\r\n\r\nPliny (Caius Plinius Secundus) was born 23 A.D., and was killed by\r\neruption of Vesuvius 79 A.D. His Natural History should be more properly\r\ncalled an encyclopaedia, the whole comprising 37 books; but only portions\r\nof the last four books relate to our subject, and over one-half of the\r\nmaterial there is upon precious stones. To give some rough idea of the\r\nsmall quantity of even this, the most voluminous of ancient works upon\r\nour subject, we have made an estimate that the portions of metallurgical\r\ncharacter would cover, say, three pages of this text, on mining two\r\npages, on building and precious stones about ten pages. Pliny and\r\nDioscorides were contemporaries, and while Pliny nowhere refers to the\r\nGreek, internal evidence is most convincing, either that they drew from\r\nthe same source, or that Pliny drew from Dioscorides. We have,\r\ntherefore, throughout the text given precedence in time to the Greek\r\nauthor in matters of historical interest. The works of Pliny were first\r\nprinted at Venice in 1469. They have passed dozens of editions in\r\nvarious languages, and have been twice translated into English. The\r\nfirst translation by Philemon Holland, London, 1601, is quite\r\nimpossible. The second translation, by Bostock and Riley, London, 1855,\r\nwas a great advance, and the notes are most valuable, but in general the\r\nwork has suffered from a freedom justifiable in the translation of\r\npoetry, but not in science. We have relied upon the Latin edition of\r\nJanus, Leipzig, 1870. The frequent quotations in our footnotes are\r\nsufficient indication of the character of Pliny's work. In general it\r\nshould be remembered that he was himself but a compiler of information\r\nfrom others, and, so far as our subjects are concerned, of no other\r\nexperience than most travellers. When one considers the reliability of\r\nsuch authors to-day on technical subjects, respect for Pliny is much\r\nenhanced. Further, the text is no doubt much corrupted through the\r\ngenerations of transcription before it was set in type. So far as can be\r\nidentified with any assurance, Pliny adds but few distinct minerals to\r\nthose enumerated by Theophrastus and Dioscorides. For his metallurgical\r\nand mining information we refer to the footnotes, and in general it may\r\nbe said that while those skilled in metallurgy can dimly see in his\r\nstatements many metallurgical operations, there is little that does not\r\nrequire much deduction to arrive at a conclusion. On geology he offers\r\nno new philosophical deductions of consequence; the remote connection of\r\nbuilding stones is practically all that can be enumerated, lest one\r\nbuild some assumption of a knowledge of ore-deposits on the use of the\r\nword \"vein\". One point of great interest to this work is that in his\r\nsearch for Latin terms for technical purposes Agricola relied almost\r\nwholly upon Pliny, and by some devotion to the latter we have been able\r\nto disentangle some very puzzling matters of nomenclature in _De Re\r\nMetallica_, of which the term _molybdaena_ may be cited as a case in\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nVitruvius was a Roman architect of note of the 1st Century B.C. His work\r\nof ten books contains some very minor references to pumps and machinery,\r\nbuilding stones, and the preparation of pigments, the latter involving\r\noperations from which metallurgical deductions can occasionally be\r\nsafely made. His works were apparently first printed in Rome in 1496.\r\nThere are many editions in various languages, the first English\r\ntranslation being from the French in 1692. We have relied upon the\r\ntranslation of Joseph Gwilt, London, 1875, with such alterations as we\r\nhave considered necessary.\r\n\r\nMEDIAEVAL AUTHORS.--For convenience we group under this heading the\r\nwriters of interest from Roman times to the awakening of learning in the\r\nearly 16th Century. Apart from Theophilus, they are mostly alchemists;\r\nbut, nevertheless, some are of great importance in the history of\r\nmetallurgy and chemistry. Omitting a horde of lesser lights upon whom we\r\nhave given some data under the author's preface, the works principally\r\nconcerned are those ascribed to Avicenna, Theophilus, Geber, Albertus\r\nMagnus, Roger Bacon, and Basil Valentine. Judging from the Preface to\r\n_De Re Metallica_, and from quotations in his subsidiary works, Agricola\r\nmust have been not only familiar with a wide range of alchemistic\r\nmaterial, but also with a good deal of the Arabic literature, which had\r\nbeen translated into Latin. The Arabs were, of course, the only race\r\nwhich kept the light of science burning during the Dark Ages, and their\r\nworks were in considerable vogue at Agricola's time.\r\n\r\nAvicenna (980-1037) was an Arabian physician of great note, a translator\r\nof the Greek classics into Arabic, and a follower of Aristotle to the\r\nextent of attempting to reconcile the Peripatetic elements with those of\r\nthe alchemists. He is chiefly known to the world through the works which\r\nhe compiled on medicine, mostly from the Greek and Latin authors. These\r\nworks for centuries dominated the medical world, and were used in\r\ncertain European Universities until the 17th century. A great many works\r\nare attributed to him, and he is copiously quoted by Agricola,\r\nprincipally in his _De Ortu et Causis_, apparently for the purpose of\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nTheophilus was a Monk and the author of a most illuminating work,\r\nlargely upon working metal and its decoration for ecclesiastical\r\npurposes. An excellent translation, with the Latin text, was published\r\nby Robert Hendrie, London, 1847, under the title \"An Essay upon various\r\nArts, in three books, by Theophilus, called also Rugerus, Priest and\r\nMonk.\" Hendrie, for many sufficient reasons, places the period of\r\nTheophilus as the latter half of the 11th century. The work is mainly\r\ndevoted to preparing pigments, making glass, and working metals, and\r\ntheir conversion into ecclesiastical paraphernalia, such as mural\r\ndecoration, pictures, windows, chalices, censers, bells, organs, etc.\r\nHowever, he incidentally describes the making of metallurgical furnaces,\r\ncupellation, parting gold and silver by cementation with salt, and by\r\nmelting with sulphur, the smelting of copper, liquating lead from it,\r\nand the refining of copper under a blast with poling.\r\n\r\nGeber was until recent years considered to be an Arab alchemist of a\r\nperiod somewhere between the 7th and 12th centuries. A mere bibliography\r\nof the very considerable literature which exists in discussion of who,\r\nwhere, and at what time the author was, would fill pages. Those who are\r\ninterested may obtain a start upon such references from Hermann Kopp's\r\n_Beitraege zur Geschichte der Chemie_, Braunschweig, 1875, and in John\r\nFerguson's _Bibliotheca Chemica_, Glasgow, 1906. Berthelot, in his\r\n_Chimie au Moyen Age_, Paris, 1893, considers the works under the name\r\nof Geber were not in the main of Arabic origin, but composed by some\r\nLatin scholar in the 13th century. In any event, certain works were,\r\nunder this name, printed in Latin as early as 1470-80, and have passed\r\ninnumerable editions since. They were first translated into English by\r\nRichard Russell, London, 1678, and we have relied upon this and the\r\nNuremberg edition in Latin of 1541. This work, even assuming Berthelot's\r\nview, is one of the most important in the history of chemistry and\r\nmetallurgy, and is characterised by a directness of statement unique\r\namong alchemists. The making of the mineral acids--certainly nitric and\r\n_aqua regia_, and perhaps hydrochloric and sulphuric--are here first\r\ndescribed. The author was familiar with saltpetre, sal-ammoniac, and\r\nalkali, and with the acids he prepared many salts for the first time. He\r\nwas familiar with amalgamation, cupellation, the separation of gold and\r\nsilver by cementation with salt and by nitric acid. His views on the\r\nprimary composition of bodies dominated the alchemistic world for\r\ncenturies. He contended that all metals were composed of \"spiritual\"\r\nsulphur (or arsenic, which he seems to consider a special form of\r\nsulphur) and quicksilver, varying proportions and qualities yielding\r\ndifferent metals. The more the quicksilver, the more \"perfect\" the\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nAlbertus Magnus (Albert von Bollstadt) was a Dominican Monk, afterwards\r\nBishop, born about 1205, and died about 1280. He was rated the most\r\nlearned man of his time, and evidence of his literary activities lies in\r\nthe complete edition of his works issued by Pierre Jammy, Lyons, 1651,\r\nwhich comprises 21 folio volumes. However, there is little doubt that a\r\ngreat number of works attributed to him, especially upon alchemy, are\r\nspurious. He covered a wide range of theology, logic, alchemy, and\r\nnatural science, and of the latter the following works which concern our\r\nsubject are considered genuine:--_De Rebus Metallicis et Mineralibus_,\r\n_De Generatione et Corruptione_, and _De Meteoris_. They are little more\r\nthan compilations and expositions of the classics muddled with the\r\nwritings of the Arabs, and in general an attempt to conciliate the\r\nPeripatetic and Alchemistic schools. His position in the history of\r\nscience has been greatly over-estimated. However, his mineralogy is,\r\nexcept for books on gems, the only writing of any consequence at all on\r\nthe subject between Pliny and Agricola, and while there are but two or\r\nthree minerals mentioned which are not to be found in the ancient\r\nauthors, this work, nevertheless, deserves some place in the history of\r\nscience, especially as some attempt at classification is made. Agricola\r\ndevotes some thousands of words to the refutation of his \"errors.\"\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon (1214-1294) was a Franciscan Friar, a lecturer at Oxford,\r\nand a man of considerable scientific attainments for his time. He was\r\nthe author of a large number of mathematical, philosophical, and\r\nalchemistic treatises. The latter are of some importance in the history\r\nof chemistry, but have only minute bearing upon metallurgy, and this\r\nchiefly as being one of the earliest to mention saltpetre.\r\n\r\nBasil Valentine is the reputed author of a number of alchemistic works,\r\nof which none appeared in print until early in the 17th century.\r\nInternal evidence seems to indicate that the \"Triumphant Chariot of\r\nAntimony\" is the only one which may possibly be authentic, and could not\r\nhave been written prior to the end of the 15th or early 16th century,\r\nalthough it has been variously placed as early as 1350. To this work has\r\nbeen accredited the first mention of sulphuric and hydrochloric acid,\r\nthe separation of gold and silver by the use of antimony (sulphide), the\r\nreduction of the antimony sulphide to the metal, the extraction of\r\ncopper by the precipitation of the sulphate with iron, and the discovery\r\nof various antimonial salts. At the time of the publication of works\r\nascribed to Valentine practically all these things were well known, and\r\nhad been previously described. We are, therefore, in much doubt as to\r\nwhether this author really deserves any notice in the history of\r\nmetallurgy.\r\n\r\nEARLY 16th CENTURY WORKS.--During the 16th century, and prior to _De Re\r\nMetallica_, there are only three works of importance from the point of\r\nview of mining technology--the _Nuetzlich Bergbuechlin_, the\r\n_Probierbuechlein_, and Biringuccio's _De La Pirotechnia_. There are also\r\nsome minor works by the alchemists of some interest for isolated\r\nstatements, particularly those of Paracelsus. The three works mentioned,\r\nhowever, represent such a stride of advance over anything previous,\r\nthat they merit careful consideration.\r\n\r\n_Eyn Nuetzlich Bergbuechlin._ Under this title we frequently refer to a\r\nlittle booklet on veins and ores, published at the beginning of the 16th\r\ncentury. The title page of our copy is as below:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration 610 (Title page)]\r\n\r\nThis book is small 8vo, comprises 24 folios without pagination, and has\r\nno typographical indications upon the title page, but the last line in\r\nthe book reads: _Gedruckt zu Erffurd durch Johan Loersfelt, 1527_.\r\nAnother edition in our possession, that of \"Frankfurt am Meyn\", 1533, by\r\nChristian Egenolph, is entitled _Bergwerk und Probierbuechlin_, etc., and\r\ncontains, besides the above, an extract and plates from the\r\n_Probierbuechlein_ (referred to later on), and a few recipes for assay\r\ntests. All of these booklets, of which we find mention, comprise\r\ninstructions from Daniel, a skilled miner, to Knappius, \"his mining\r\nboy\". Although the little books of this title are all anonymous, we are\r\nconvinced, largely from the statement in the Preface of _De Re\r\nMetallica_, that one Calbus of Freiberg was the original author of this\r\nwork. Agricola says: \"Two books have been written in our tongue: the one\r\non the assaying of mineral substances and metals, somewhat confused,\r\nwhose author is unknown; the other 'On Veins', of which Pandulfus Anglus\r\nis also said to have written, _although the German book was written by\r\nCalbus of Freiberg, a well-known doctor; but neither of them\r\naccomplished the task he had begun_.\" He again refers to Calbus at the\r\nend of Book III.[2] of _De Re Metallica_, and gives an almost verbatim\r\nquotation from the _Nuetzlich Bergbuechlin_. Jacobi[3] says: \"Calbus\r\nFribergius, so called by Agricola himself, is certainly no other than\r\nthe Freiberg doctor, Ruehlein von C(K)albe.\" There are also certain\r\ninternal evidences that support Agricola's statement, for the work was\r\nevidently written in Meissen, and the statement of Agricola that the\r\nbook was unfinished is borne out by a short dialogue at the end of the\r\nearlier editions, designed to introduce further discussion. Calbus (or\r\nDr. Ulrich Ruehlein von Kalbe) was a very active citizen of Freiberg,\r\nhaving been a town councillor in 1509, burgomaster in 1514, a\r\nmathematician, mining surveyor, founder of a school of liberal arts, and\r\nin general a physician. He died in 1523.[4] The book possesses great\r\nliterary interest, as it is, so far as we are aware, undoubtedly the\r\nfirst work on mining geology, and in consequence we have spent some\r\neffort in endeavour to find the date of its first appearance. Through\r\nthe courtesy of M. Polain, who has carefully examined for us the\r\n_Nuetzlich Bergbuechlein_ described in Marie Pellechet's _Catalogue\r\nGeneral des Incunables des Bibliotheques Publiques de France_,[5] we\r\nhave ascertained that it is similar as regards text and woodcuts to the\r\nErfurt edition, 1527. This copy in the Bibliotheque Nationale is without\r\ntypographical indications, and M. Polain considers it very possible that\r\nit is the original edition printed at the end of the fifteenth or\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth centuries. Mr. Bennett Brough,[6] quoting\r\nHans von Dechen,[7] states that the first edition was printed at\r\nAugsburg in 1505, no copy of which seems to be extant. The Librarian at\r\nthe School of Mines at Freiberg has kindly furnished us with the\r\nfollowing notes as to the titles of the copies in that Institution:--(1)\r\n_Eyn Wolgeordent und Nuetzlich Bergbuechlein_, etc., Worms, 1512[8] and\r\n1518[9] (the place and date are written in), (2) the same as ours\r\n(1527); (3) the same, Heinrich Steyner, Augsburg, 1534; (4) the same,\r\n1539. On comparing these various editions (to which may be added one\r\nprobably published in Nuernberg by Friedrich Peypus in 1532[10]) we find\r\nthat they fall into two very distinct groups, characterised by their\r\ncontents and by two entirely different sets of woodcuts.\r\n\r\nGroup I.\r\n\r\n     (_a_) _Eyn Nuetzlich Bergbuechlein_ (in _Bibl. Nat._, Paris)\r\n     before 1500 (?).\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Ditto, Erfurt, 1527.\r\n\r\nGroup II.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) _Wolgeordent Nuetzlich Bergbuechlein_, Worms, Peter\r\n     Schoefern, 1512.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) _Wolgeordent Nuetzlich Bergbuechlein_, Worms, Peter\r\n     Schoefern, 1518.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) _Bergbuechlin von Erkantnus der Berckwerck_, Nuernberg,\r\n     undated, 1532 (?).\r\n\r\n     (_f_) _Bergwerckbuch & Probirbuch_, Christian Egenolph,\r\n     Frankfurt-am-Meyn, 1533.\r\n\r\n     (_g_) _Wolgeordent Nuetzlich Bergbuechlein_, Augsburg, Heinrich\r\n     Steyner, 1534.\r\n\r\n     (_h_) _Wolgeordent Nuetzlich Bergbuechlein_, Augsburg, Heinrich\r\n     Steyner, 1539.\r\n\r\nThere are also others of later date toward the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe _Buechlein_ of Group I. terminate after the short dialogue between\r\nDaniel and Knappius with the words: _Mitt welchen das kleinspeissig ertz\r\ngeschmeltzt soil werden_; whereas in those of Group II. these words are\r\nfollowed by a short explanation of the signs used in the woodcuts, and\r\nby directions for colouring the woodcuts, and in some cases by several\r\npages containing definitions of some 92 mining terms. In the editions of\r\nGroup I. the woodcut on the title page represents a miner hewing ore in\r\na vein and two others working a windlass. In those of Group II. the\r\nwoodcut on the title page represents one miner hewing on the surface,\r\nanother to the right carting away ore in a handcart, and two others\r\ncarrying between them a heavy timber. In our opinion Group I. represents\r\nthe older and original work of Calbus; but as we have not seen the copy\r\nin the _Bibliotheque Nationale_, and the Augsburg edition of 1505 has\r\nonly so far been traced to Veith's catalogue,[11] the question of the\r\nfirst edition cannot be considered settled at present. In any event, it\r\nappears that the material grafted on in the second group was later, and\r\nby various authors.\r\n\r\nThe earliest books comprise ten chapters, in which Daniel delivers about\r\n6,000 words of instruction. The first four chapters are devoted to the\r\ndescription of veins and the origin of the metals, of the remaining six\r\nchapters one each to silver, gold, tin, copper, iron, lead, and\r\nquicksilver. Among the mining terms are explained the meaning of country\r\nrock (_zechstein_), hanging and footwalls (_hangends_ and _liegends_),\r\nthe strike (_streichen_), dip (_fallen_), and outcrop (_ausgehen_). Of\r\nthe latter two varieties are given, one of the \"whole vein,\" the other\r\nof the _gesteins_, which may be the ore-shoot. Various veins are\r\nillustrated, and also for the first time a mining compass. The account\r\nof the origin of the metals is a muddle of the Peripatetics, the\r\nalchemists, and the astrologers, for which acknowledgment to Albertus\r\nMagnus is given. They are represented to originate from quicksilver and\r\nsulphur through heat, cold, dampness, and dryness, and are drawn out as\r\nexhalations through the veins, each metal owing its origin to the\r\nspecial influence of some planet; the Moon for silver, Saturn for lead,\r\netc. Two types of veins are mentioned, \"standing\" (_stehendergang_) and\r\nflat (_flachgang_). Stringers are given the same characteristics as\r\nveins, but divided into hanging, footwall, and other varieties.\r\nProminence is also given to the _geschick_ (selvage seams or joints?).\r\nThe importance of the bearing of the junctions of veins and stringers\r\non enrichment is elaborated upon, and veins of east-west strike lying\r\nupon a south slope are considered the best. From the following notes it\r\nwill be seen that two or three other types of deposits besides veins are\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nIn describing silver veins, of peculiar interest is the mention of the\r\nassociation of bismuth (_wismuth_), this being, we believe, the first\r\nmention of that metal, galena (_glantz_), quartz (_quertz_), spar\r\n(_spar_), hornstone (_hornstein_), ironstone and pyrites (_kies_), are\r\nmentioned as gangue materials, \"according to the mingling of the various\r\nvapours.\" The term _glasertz_ is used, but it is difficult to say if\r\nsilver glance is meant; if so, it is the first mention of this mineral.\r\nSo far as we know, this is the first use of any of the terms in print.\r\nGold alluvial is described, part of the gold being assumed as generated\r\nin the gravel. The best alluvial is in streams running east and west.\r\nThe association of gold with pyrites is mentioned, and the pyrites is\r\nfound \"in some places as a complete stratum carried through\r\nhorizontally, and is called a _schwebender gang_.\" This sort of\r\noccurrence is not considered very good \"because the work of the heavens\r\ncan be but little completed on account of the unsuitability of the\r\nposition.\" Gold pyrites that comes in veins is better. Tin is mentioned\r\nas found in alluvial, and also in veins, the latter being better or\r\nworse, according to the amount of pyrites, although the latter can be\r\nburned off. Tin-stone is found in masses, copper ore in schist and in\r\nveins sometimes with pyrites. The ore from veins is better than schist.\r\nIron ore is found in masses, and sometimes in veins; the latter is the\r\nbest. \"The iron veins with good hanging- and foot-walls are not to be\r\ndespised, especially if their strike be from east to west, their dip to\r\nthe south, the foot-wall and outcrop to the north, then if the ironstone\r\nis followed down, the vein usually reveals gold or other valuable ore\".\r\nLead ore is found in _schwebenden gang_ and _stehenden gang_.\r\nQuicksilver, like other ore, is sometimes found in brown earth, and\r\nsometimes, again, in caves where it has run out like water. The\r\nclassification of veins is the same as in _De Re Metallica_.[12] The\r\nbook generally, however, seems to have raised Agricola's opposition, for\r\nthe quotations are given in order to be demolished.\r\n\r\n_Probierbuechlein._ Agricola refers in the Preface of _De Re Metallica_\r\nto a work in German on assaying and refining metals, and it is our\r\nbelief that it was to some one of the little assay books published early\r\nin the 16th century. There are several of them, seemingly revised\r\neditions of each other; in the early ones no author's name appears,\r\nalthough among the later editions various names appear on the title\r\npage. An examination of these little books discloses the fact that their\r\nmain contents are identical, for they are really collections of recipes\r\nafter the order of cookery books, and intended rather to refresh the\r\nmemory of those already skilled than to instruct the novice. The books\r\nappear to have grown by accretions from many sources, for a large number\r\nof methods are given over and over again in the same book with slight\r\nvariations. We reproduce the title page of our earliest copy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration 612 (Title page)]\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of these booklets so far as we have been able to\r\ndiscover actual copies:--\r\n\r\n  _Date._  _Place._     _Publisher._    _Title (Short)._         _Author._\r\n\r\n  Unknown  Unknown      Unknown         _Probierbuechlein_        Anon.\r\n            (Undated; but catalogue of British Museum suggests Augsburg, 1510.)\r\n\r\n  1524     Magdeburg                    _Probirbuechleyn          Anon.\r\n                                          tzu Gotteslob_\r\n\r\n  1531     Augsburg     Unknown         _Probierbuch aller       Anon.\r\n                                          Sachsischer Ertze_\r\n\r\n  1533     Frankfurt a.                 _Bergwerck und           Anon.\r\n             Meyn                         Probierbuechlein_\r\n\r\n  1534     Augsburg     Heinrich        _Probirbuechlein_         Anon.\r\n                         Steyner, 8vo.\r\n\r\n  1546     Augsburg     Ditto, ditto    _Probirbuechlein_         Anon.\r\n\r\n  1549     Augsburg     Ditto, ditto    _Probirbuechlein_         Anon.\r\n\r\n  1564     Augsburg     Math.

The\r\nBritish Museum copy of earliest date, like the title page reproduced,\r\ncontains no date. The title page woodcut, however, in the Museum copy is\r\nreferred from that above, possibly indicating an earlier date of the\r\nMuseum copy.\r\n\r\nThe booklets enumerated above vary a great deal in contents, the\r\nsuccessive prints representing a sort of growth by accretion. The first\r\nportion of our earliest edition is devoted to weights, in which the\r\nsystem of \"lesser weights\" (the principle of the \"assay ton\") is\r\nexplained. Following this are exhaustive lists of touch-needles of\r\nvarious composition. Directions are given with regard to assay furnaces,\r\ncupels, muffles, scorifiers, and crucibles, granulated and leaf metals,\r\nfor washing, roasting, and the preparation of assay charges. Various\r\nreagents, including glass-gall, litharge, salt, iron filings, lead,\r\n\"alkali\", talc, argol, saltpetre, sal-ammoniac, alum, vitriol, lime,\r\nsulphur, antimony, _aqua fortis_, or _scheidwasser_, etc., are made use\r\nof. Various assays are described and directions given for crucible,\r\nscorification, and cupellation tests. The latter part of the book is\r\ndevoted to the refining and parting of precious metals. Instructions are\r\ngiven for the separation of silver from iron, from lead, and from\r\nantimony; of gold from silver with antimony (sulphide) and sulphur, or\r\nwith sulphur alone, with \"_scheidwasser_,\" and by cementation with salt;\r\nof gold from copper with sulphur and with lead. The amalgamation of gold\r\nand silver is mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe book is diffuse and confused, and without arrangement or system,\r\nyet a little consideration enables one of experience to understand most\r\nstatements. There are over 120 recipes, with, as said before, much\r\nrepetition; for instance, the parting of gold and silver by use of\r\nsulphur is given eight times in different places. The final line of the\r\nbook is: \"Take this in good part, dear reader, after it, please God,\r\nthere will be a better.\" In truth, however, there are books on assaying\r\nfour centuries younger that are worse. This is, without doubt, the first\r\nwritten word on assaying, and it displays that art already full grown,\r\nso far as concerns gold and silver, and to some extent copper and lead;\r\nfor if we eliminate the words dependent on the atomic theory from modern\r\nworks on dry assaying, there has been but very minor progress. The art\r\ncould not, however, have reached this advanced stage but by slow\r\naccretion, and no doubt this collection of recipes had been handed from\r\nfather to son long before the 16th century. It is of wider interest that\r\nthese booklets represent the first milestone on the road to quantitative\r\nanalysis, and in this light they have been largely ignored by the\r\nhistorians of chemistry. Internal evidence in Book VII. of _De Re\r\nMetallica_, together with the reference in the Preface, leave little\r\ndoubt that Agricola was familiar with these booklets. His work, however,\r\nis arranged more systematically, each operation stated more clearly,\r\nwith more detail and fresh items; and further, he gives methods of\r\ndetermining copper and lead which are but minutely touched upon in the\r\n_Probierbuechlein_, while the directions as to tin, bismuth, quicksilver,\r\nand iron are entirely new.\r\n\r\nBiringuccio (Vanuccio). We practically know nothing about this author.\r\nFrom the preface to the first edition of his work it appears he was\r\nstyled a mathematician, but in the text[14] he certainly states that he\r\nwas most of his time engaged in metallurgical operations, and that in\r\npursuit of such knowledge he had visited Germany. The work was in\r\nItalian, published at Venice in 1540, the title page of the first\r\nedition as below:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration 614 (Title page)]\r\n\r\nIt comprises ten chapters in 168 folios demi-octavo. Other Italian\r\neditions of which we find some record are the second at Venice, 1552;\r\nthird, Venice, 1558; fourth, Venice, 1559; fifth, Bologna, 1678. A\r\nFrench translation, by Jacques Vincent, was published in Paris, 1556,\r\nand this translation was again published at Rouen in 1627. Of the ten\r\nchapters the last six are almost wholly devoted to metal working and\r\nfounding, and it is more largely for this description of the methods of\r\nmaking artillery, munitions of war and bells that the book is\r\ncelebrated. In any event, with the exception of a quotation which we\r\ngive on page 297 on silver amalgamation, there is little of interest on\r\nour subject in the latter chapters. The first four chapters are\r\nundoubtedly of importance in the history of metallurgical literature,\r\nand represent the first work on smelting. The descriptions are, however,\r\nvery diffuse, difficult to follow, and lack arrangement and detail. But\r\nlike the _Probierbuechlein_, the fact that it was written prior to _De Re\r\nMetallica_ demands attention for it which it would not otherwise\r\nreceive. The ores of gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, and iron are\r\ndescribed, but much interrupted with denunciations of the alchemists.\r\nThere is little of geological or mineralogical interest, he too holding\r\nto a muddle of the classic elements astrology and alchemy. He has\r\nnothing of consequence to say on mining, and dismisses concentration\r\nwith a few words. Upon assaying his work is not so useful as the\r\n_Probierbuechlein_. On ore smelting he describes the reduction of iron\r\nand lead ores and cupriferous silver or gold ores with lead. He gives\r\nthe barest description of a blast furnace, but adds an interesting\r\naccount of a _reverbero_ furnace. He describes liquation as consisting\r\nof one operation; the subsequent treatment of the copper by refining\r\nwith an oxidizing blast, but does not mention poling; the cupellation of\r\nargentiferous lead and the reduction of the litharge; the manufacture of\r\nnitric acid and that method of parting gold and silver. He also gives\r\nthe method of parting with antimony and sulphur, and by cementation with\r\ncommon salt. Among the side issues, he describes the method of making\r\nbrass with calamine; of making steel; of distilling quicksilver; of\r\nmelting out sulphur; of making vitriol and alum. He states that\r\n_arsenico_ and _orpimento_ and _etrisagallio_ (realgar) are the same\r\nsubstance, and are used to colour copper white.\r\n\r\nIn general, Biringuccio should be accredited with the first description\r\n(as far as we are aware) of silver amalgamation, of a reverberatory\r\nfurnace, and of liquation, although the description is not complete.\r\nAlso he is, so far as we are aware, the first to mention cobalt blue\r\n(_Zaffre_) and manganese, although he classed them as \"half\" metals. His\r\ndescriptions are far inferior to Agricola's; they do not compass\r\nanything like the same range of metallurgy, and betray the lack of a\r\nlogical mind.\r\n\r\n_Other works._ There are several works devoted to mineralogy, dating\r\nfrom the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, which were, no doubt,\r\navailable to Agricola in the compilation of his _De Natura Fossilium_.\r\nThey are, however, practically all compiled from the jeweller's point of\r\nview rather than from that of the miner. Among them we may mention the\r\npoem on precious stones by Marbodaeus, an author who lived from 1035 to\r\n1123, but which was first printed at Vienna in 1511; _Speculum Lapidum_,\r\na work on precious stones, by Camilli Leonardi, first printed in Venice\r\nin 1502. A work of wider interest to mineralogists is that by Christoph\r\nEntzelt (or Enzelius, Encelio, Encelius, as it is variously given),\r\nentitled _De Re Metallica_, and first printed in 1551. The work is five\r\nyears later than _De Natura Fossilium_, but contains much new material\r\nand was available to Agricola prior to his revised editions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See pages 44 and 46.\r\n\r\n[2] Page 75.\r\n\r\n[3] _Der Mineralog Georgius Agricola_, Zwickau, 1889, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[4] Andreas Moeller, _Theatrum Freibergense Chronicum_, etc., Freiberg,\r\n1653.\r\n\r\n[5] Paris, 1897, Vol. I. p. 501.\r\n\r\n[6] Cantor Lectures, London, April 1892.\r\n\r\n[7] Hans von Dechen, _Das aelteste deutsche Bergwerksbuch_, reprint from\r\n_Zts. fuer Bergrecht Bd.

Agricola uses, throughout, the\r\nRoman and the Romanized Greek scales, but in many cases he uses these\r\nterms merely as lingual equivalents for the German quantities of his\r\nday. Moreover the classic language sometimes failed him, whereupon he\r\ncoined new Latin terms adapted from the Roman scale, and thus added\r\nfurther confusion. We can, perhaps, make the matter clearer by an\r\nillustration of a case in weights. The Roman _centumpondium_, composed\r\nof 100 _librae_, the old German _centner_ of 100 _pfundt_, and the\r\nEnglish hundredweight of 112 pounds can be called lingual equivalents.\r\nThe first weighs about 494,600 Troy grains, the second 721,900, and the\r\nthird 784,000. While the divisions of the _centumpondium_ and the\r\n_centner_ are the same, the _libra_ is divided into 12 _unciae_ and the\r\n_pfundt_ into 16 _untzen_, and in most places a summation of the units\r\ngiven proves that the author had in mind the Roman ratios. However, on\r\np. 509 he makes the direct statement that the _centumpondium_ weighs 146\r\n_librae_, which would be about the correct weight if the _centumpondium_\r\nreferred to was a _centner_. If we take an example such as \"each\r\n_centumpondium_ of lead contains one _uncia_ of silver\", and reduce it\r\naccording to purely lingual equivalents, we should find that it runs\r\n24.3 Troy ounces per short ton, on the basis of Roman values, and 18.25\r\nounces per short ton, on the basis of old German. If we were to\r\ntranslate these into English lingual equivalents of one ounce per\r\nhundredweight, then the value would be 17.9 ounces per short ton.\r\n\r\nSeveral possibilities were open in translation: first, to calculate the\r\nvalues accurately in the English units; second, to adopt the nearest\r\nEnglish lingual equivalent; third, to introduce the German scale of the\r\nperiod; or, fourth, to leave the original Latin in the text. The first\r\nwould lead to an indefinite number of decimals and to constant doubt as\r\nto whether the values, upon which calculations were to be based, were\r\nRoman or German. The second, that is the substitution of lingual\r\nequivalents, is objectionable, not only because it would indicate values\r\nnot meant by the author, but also because we should have, like Agricola,\r\nto coin new terms to accommodate the lapses in the scales, or again to\r\nuse decimals. In the third case, that is in the use of the old German\r\nscale, while it would be easier to adapt than the English, it would be\r\nmore unfamiliar to most readers than the Latin, and not so expressive in\r\nprint, and further, in some cases would present the same difficulties of\r\ncalculation as in using the English scale. Nor does the contemporary\r\nGerman translation of _De Re Metallica_ prove of help, for its\r\ntranslator adopted only lingual equivalents, and in consequence the\r\nsummation of his weights often gives incorrect results. From all these\r\npossibilities we have chosen the fourth, that is simply to reproduce the\r\nLatin terms for both weights and measures. We have introduced into the\r\nfootnotes such reductions to the English scale as we considered would\r\ninterest readers. We have, however, digressed from the rule in two\r\ncases, in the adoption of \"foot\" for the Latin _pes_, and \"fathom\" for\r\n_passus_. Apart from the fact that these were not cases where accuracy\r\nis involved, Agricola himself explains (p. 77) that he means the German\r\nvalues for these particular terms, which, fortunately, fairly closely\r\napproximate to the English. Further, we have adopted the Anglicized\r\nwords \"digit\", \"palm\", and \"cubit\", instead of their Latin forms.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of reference, we reproduce the principal Roman and old\r\nGerman scales, in so far as they are used by Agricola in this work, with\r\ntheir values in English. All students of weights and measures will\r\nrealize that these values are but approximate, and that this is not an\r\noccasion to enter upon a discussion of the variations in different\r\nperiods or by different authorities. Agricola himself is the author of\r\none of the standard works on Ancient Weights and Measures (see Appendix\r\nA), and further gives fairly complete information on contemporary scales\r\nof weight and fineness for precious metals in Book VII. p. 262 etc., to\r\nwhich we refer readers.\r\n\r\n  ROMAN SCALES OF WEIGHTS.\r\n\r\n                                       Troy Grains.\r\n    1 _Siliqua_   =                          2.87\r\n    6 _Siliquae_  = 1 _Scripulum_           17.2\r\n    4 _Scripula_  = 1 _Sextula_             68.7\r\n    6 _Sextulae_  = 1 _Uncia_              412.2\r\n   12 _Unciae_    = 1 _Libra_             4946.4\r\n  100 _Librae_    = 1 _Centumpondium_   494640.0\r\n\r\n  Also\r\n\r\n    1 _Scripulum_ =                         17.2\r\n    3 _Scripula_  = 1 _Drachma_             51.5\r\n    2 _Drachmae_  = 1 _Sicilicus_          103.0\r\n    4 _Sicilici_  = 1 _Uncia_              412.2\r\n    8 _Unciae_    = 1 _Bes_               3297.6\r\n\r\n  SCALE OF FINENESS\r\n  (AGRICOLA'S ADAPTATION).\r\n\r\n    4 _Siliquae_          = 1 Unit of _Siliquae_\r\n    3 _Units of Siliquae_ = 1 _Semi-sextula_\r\n    4 _Semi-sextulae_     = 1 _Duella_\r\n   24 _Duellae_           = 1 _Bes_\r\n\r\n  OLD GERMAN SCALE OF WEIGHTS.\r\n                                      Troy Grains.\r\n    1 _Pfennig_   =                         14.1\r\n    4 _Pfennige_  = 1 _Quintlein_           56.4\r\n    4 _Quintlein_ = 1 _Loth_               225.6\r\n    2 _Loth_      = 1 _Untzen_             451.2\r\n    8 _Untzen_    = 1 _Mark_              3609.6\r\n    2 _Mark_      = 1 _Pfundt_            7219.2\r\n  100 _Pfundt_    = 1 _Centner_         721920.0\r\n\r\n  SCALE OF FINENESS.\r\n\r\n    3 _Grenlin_ = 1 _Gran_\r\n    4 _Gran_    = 1 _Krat_\r\n   24 _Krat_    = 1 _Mark_\r\n\r\n  ROMAN LONG MEASURE.\r\n                                     Inches.\r\n    1 _Digitus_     =                    .726\r\n    4 _Digiti_      = 1 _Palmus_        2.90\r\n    4 _Palmi_       = 1 _Pes_          11.61\r\n    1-1/2 _Pedes_   = 1 _Cubitus_      17.41\r\n    5 _Pedes_       = 1 _Passus_       58.1\r\n\r\n  Also\r\n\r\n    1 Roman _Uncia_ =                    .97\r\n   12 _Unciae_      = Pes              11.61\r\n\r\n  GREEK LONG MEASURE.\r\n                                     Inches.\r\n    1 _Dactylos_    =                    .758\r\n    4 _Dactyloi_    = 1 _Palaiste_      3.03\r\n    4 _Palaistai_   = 1 _Pous_         12.135\r\n    1-1/2 _Pous_    = 1 _Pechus_       18.20\r\n    6 _Pous_        = 1 _Orguia_       72.81\r\n\r\n  OLD GERMAN LONG MEASURE.\r\n                                     Inches.\r\n    1 _Querfinger_  =                    .703\r\n   16 _Querfinger_  = 1 _Werckschuh_   11.247\r\n    2 _Werckschuh_  = 1 _Elle_         22.494\r\n    3 _Elle_        = 1 _Lachter_      67.518\r\n\r\n  Also\r\n\r\n    1 _Zoll_        =                    .85\r\n   12 _Zoll_        = 1 _Werkschuh_\r\n\r\n  ROMAN LIQUID MEASURE.\r\n                               Cubic inches.

As such, it's no\r\nsurprise that there are many spelling and punctuation irregularities.\r\nAlso the authors were American, but writing for a British journal. In\r\naddition, whether \"ae\" and \"oe\" appear as ligatures or separate\r\ncharacters seems to be fairly random. Unless there was a clearly\r\npreferred spelling choice, variants were kept as is. All changes are\r\nexplicitly documented below. Noted spelling variants that were preserved\r\ninclude: \"aluminum\" and \"aluminium;\" \"ampullas\" and \"ampullae;\"\r\n\"beechwood\" and \"beech-wood;\" \"Bluetstein\" and \"Bluet stein;\" \"brick dust\"\r\nand \"brickdust;\" \"calcspar,\" \"calc spar\" and \"calc-spar;\" derivatives of\r\n\"crossbar\" and \"cross-bar,\" and similarly for \"crosscut,\" \"crosspiece,\"\r\netc.; (Hans von) \"Dechen\" and \"Decken;\" \"desulphurizing\" and\r\n\"de-sulphurizing;\" \"dissension\" and \"dissention\" (and their plurals);\r\n\"distill\" and \"distil\" (and derivatives); \"encrusted\" and \"incrusted;\"\r\n\"enquire\" and \"inquire\" (and derivatives); \"ensure\" and \"insure;\"\r\n(Lazarus) \"Ercker\" and \"Erckern;\" \"flavor\" and \"flavour;\" \"fluor-spar\"\r\nand \"fluorspar;\" \"Flusse\" and \"Fluesse;\" (Rotenburg an der) \"Fulda\" and\r\n\"Fulde;\" \"Gatter\" and \"Gatterer\" may be the same person; \"gold workers,\"\r\n\"goldworkers\" and \"gold-workers;\" \"gray\" and \"grey\" (and derivatives);\r\n\"grove\" and \"groove\" (English mining term for a shaft); \"halitum\" and\r\n\"halitus;\" \"Henckel\" and \"Henkel;\" \"holm oak\" and \"holmoak;\"\r\n\"homogenous\" and \"homogeneous;\" Daniel \"Houghsetter,\" \"Houghstetter\" and\r\n\"Hochstetter;\" \"Joannes\" and \"Johannes\" (the alchemist); \"Johanes\" and\r\n\"Johannes\" (Aurelius Augurellus), a.k.a. \"John Aurelio Augurello;\"\r\n\"Juedenstein\" and \"Jueden stein;\" \"Kinstock\" and \"Kinstocke;\" \"Lautental\"\r\nand \"Lautenthal;\" \"lawsuit\" and \"law-suit;\" \"Leipsic\" and \"Leipzig;\"\r\n\"Krat\" and \"Kratt;\" \"Mosaic\" and \"Mosaick;\" \"mineralogic\" and\r\n\"mineralogical;\" \"Nuetzlich Bergbuechlin,\" \"Nuetzliche Bergbuechlin,\"\r\n\"Nuetzlich Bergbuechlein,\" and \"Nuetzliche Bergbuechlein;\" \"organisation\"\r\nand \"organization;\" (Thomas) \"Pennant\" and \"Pennent;\" \"Probier\r\nBuechlein,\" \"Probierbuechlin,\" \"Probierbuechlein,\" \"Probirbuechlein,\" and\r\n\"Probirbuechleyn\" (which may be different books in some cases);\r\nderivatives of \"pulverise\" and \"pulverize;\" \"reagent\" and \"re-agent\"\r\n(and their plurals); derivatives of \"recognise\" and \"recognize;\"\r\n\"republished\" and \"re-published;\" \"salamander har\" and \"salamanderhar;\"\r\n\"seashore\" and \"sea-shore;\" \"semicircle\" and \"semi-circle\" (and\r\nderivatives); \"shovelful\" and \"shovel-ful;\" \"spiesglas,\" \"spiesglass,\"\r\nand \"spiesglasz;\" \"Turkey oak\" and \"turkey-oak;\" \"Vannucci,\" \"Vannuccio\"\r\nand \"Vanuccio\" (Biringuccio); \"Vectarii\" and \"Vectiarii;\" derivatives of\r\n\"volatilise\" and \"volatilize.\"\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no rule whether punctuation following a quote should\r\nbe inside or outside the quotation marks. The text was simply left as\r\nis.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no rule whether Roman numerals have periods after\r\nthem or not; even references to the same document may differ. The text\r\nwas simply left as is.\r\n\r\nFor the text version of the document, replaced the oe-ligature with the\r\nseparate characters \"oe.\" Also removed the macron from the \"e\" in\r\n\"pectos.\"\r\n\r\nSome footnote numbers are skipped. To avoid confusion with references to\r\nthe footnotes, none of the footnotes were re-numbered. In particular,\r\nBook I does not have footnote 24; Book VI does not have footnote 9; Book\r\nVIII does not have footnote 9, 10 or 18; Book IX does not have footnote\r\n24; Book XI does not have footnote 3.\r\n\r\nInserted missing anchor for footnote 1 on page v.\r\n\r\nChanged \"Albertham\" to \"Abertham\" on page vii: \"the God's Gift mine at\r\nAbertham.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"honored\" to \"honoured\" on page xi: \"most honoured citizens.\"\r\n\r\nTreated the explanatory text on page xxiv as a footnote (number 1) and\r\ncreated its anchor on page xxi.\r\n\r\nChanged \"license\" to \"licence\" in the note on page xxiv: \"only poets\r\nhave licence.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Bibliotheque\" to \"Bibliotheque\" in the footnote on page xxix:\r\n\"the Bibliotheque Nationale.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Theosebeia\" to \"Theosebia\" and inserted closing double\r\nquotation mark after \"written to Theosebia, etc....'\" on page xxx.\r\n\r\nLeft \"loadstone\" on page 2 although it's spelled \"lodestone\" everywhere\r\nelse, because it's in a quote.\r\n\r\nChanged \"silver-mines\" to \"silver mines\" on page 5: \"the silver mines at\r\nFreiberg.\"\r\n\r\nRemoved the extra comma after \"ll.\" in footnote 20 on page 11: \"Odes,\r\nI., 35, ll. 17-20;\" and in footnote 21 on page 15: \"Satires, II., 3, ll.\r\n99-102.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"realised\" to \"realized\" on page 25: \"his hopes are not\r\nrealized.\"\r\n\r\nRemoved extra double quotation mark from before \"probable that the work\"\r\non page 28.\r\n\r\nChanged \"Hipprocrene\" to \"Hippocrene\" in footnote 19 on page 37: \"named\r\nHippocrene after that horse.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Joachimstal\" to \"Joachimsthal\" on page 42.\r\n\r\nAdjusted the formats of the captions to the illustrations on page 45,\r\n55, 56 and 60 to be consistent with other captions.\r\n\r\nRemoved extra double quotation mark after \"not a metal\" in the footnote\r\nfrom page 51.\r\n\r\nChanged \"foot walls and hanging walls\" to \"footwalls and hangingwalls\"\r\non page 65.\r\n\r\nChanged \"hanging-wall\" to \"hangingwall\" in footnote 5 on page 80: \"into\r\nthe hangingwall.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Phaenippis\" to \"Phaenippus\" in the footnote on page 83: \"the\r\nother against Phaenippus.\"\r\n\r\nInserted double quotation mark after \"Droit Francais et Etranger\" in the\r\nfootnote on page 84.\r\n\r\nChanged \"Inama-Strenegg\" to \"Inama-Sternegg\" in the footnote on page 84.\r\n\r\nChanged \"Himmelich\" to \"Himmelisch\" on page 92: \"Himmelisch Hoez.\"\r\n\"Himmelsch hoz\" was retained as a variant elsewhere.\r\n\r\nChanged \"shovelers\" to \"shovellers\" on page 100: \"miners, shovellers,\r\nwindlass men.\"\r\n\r\nThe table in the note on page 109 refers to note 7 on p. 573. It would\r\nmake more sense to refer to note 8, but was left as is.\r\n\r\nChanged \"chrusos\" to \"chrysos\" in the footnote on page 110: \"(chrysos,\r\ngold and kolla, solder).\"\r\n\r\nThe footnote on page 110 contains the reference \"(see note xx., p. x).\"\r\nRather than Roman numerals, this appears to be a placeholder to a\r\nreference that was not filled in. Perhaps it should be \"(see note 8, p.\r\n560),\" but it was left as is.\r\n\r\nChanged \"tinstone\" to \"tin-stone\" in the footnote on page 110.\r\n\r\nChanged \"De La Pirotechnica\" to \"De La Pirotechnia\" in the footnote on\r\npage 112.\r\n\r\nChanged \"Mansfeld\" to \"Mannsfeld\" in the footnote on page 113:\r\n\"Mannsfeld copper schists.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"CoAsA\" to \"CoAsS\" in the footnote on page 113: \"Cobaltite\r\n(CoAsS).\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Phoenecians\" to \"Phoenicians\" on page 119: \"Phoenicians must\r\nhave possessed.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"hanging wall\" to \"hangingwall\" on page 124: \"the hangingwall\r\nand the footwall.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"venae dilatatae\" (ae-ligature) to \"venae dilatatae\" on page 127:\r\n\"mine venae dilatatae lying down.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"venae cumulatae\" (ae-ligature) to \"venae cumulatae\" on page 128:\r\n\"as to venae cumulatae.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Watts's\" to \"Watt's\" in footnote 1 on page 149: \"Watt's\r\nimprovements.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"locks\" to \"blocks\" on page 151: \"blocks, and plates.\"\r\n\r\nSomething is wrong with the sentence on page 153 that ends with the\r\nreference to footnote 3. One metreta is larger than one-sixth of a\r\ncongius. Perhaps \"metreta\" and \"congius\" should be swapped in this\r\nsentence, but it was left as is.\r\n\r\nChanged \"bail\" to \"bale\" on page 153: \"iron semi-circular bale.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Fosilium\" to \"Fossilium\" twice in the footnote on page 155: \"De\r\nNatura Fossilium.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"decends\" to \"descends\" on page 166: \"descends into an\r\nunderground chamber,\" and again on page 190: \"the plank descends.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Pig-skin\" to \"Pigskin\" in the caption to the illustration on\r\npage 168: \"Pigskin sacks.\"\r\n\r\nLeft \"vapor\" as is in footnote 20 on page 210 although it's spelled\r\n\"vapour\" everywhere else, because it's in a quote.\r\n\r\nChanged \"de hydrated\" to \"dehydrated\" in the footnote on page 221:\r\n\"Probably dehydrated alum.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Na_{2}Co_{3}\" to \"Na_{2}CO_{3}\" in the footnote on page 222.\r\n\r\nChanged \"fore-part\" to \"forepart\" on page 226: \"the forepart lies.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"four-fold\" to \"fourfold\" on page 226: \"with fourfold curves.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"or\" to \"of\" on page 230: \"an ore of copper.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"factictius\" to \"facticius\" in the footnote on page 233: \"Sal\r\nfacticius.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Interpretaltio\" to \"Interpretatio\" in footnote 13 on page 234:\r\n\"Interpretatio, die heffe.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"Loehneys\" to \"Lohneys\" in footnote 21 on page 237.\r\n\r\n\"Cramner\" in footnote 21 on page 237 may be a typo for \"Cramer,\" but it\r\nwas left as is.\r\n\r\nChanged \"neutralized\" to \"neutralised\" in footnote 21 on page 237:\r\n\"neutralised by the nitre.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"notes\" to \"note\" in footnote 33 on page 248: \"note 10.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"liquified\" to \"liquefied\" on page 250: \"has become sufficiently\r\nliquefied.\"\r\n\r\nChanged \"touchneedles\" to \"touch-needles\" in footnote 37 on page 253:\r\n\"detailed account of touch-needles.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference to page 259 in footnote 39 on page 253 does not seem to\r\nmake sense, but was not changed. Perhaps the reference should be to\r\nfootnote 27 on page 242.\r\n\r\nIn the table on page 257, the entries for the 20th and 21st needles do\r\nnot add up, because the entry for the number of sextulae of copper\r\nbelongs in the 21st needle, not the 20th. This was corrected. However,\r\nthere are other errors in this table, which are not so obvious and were\r\nnot corrected. In particular, the entries for the 22nd, 28th and 31st\r\nneedles do not add correctly.\r\n\r\nIn the table on page 258, the number for the siliquae of copper was\r\nsometimes in the sextulae column. These were corrected. The affected\r\nlines were the ones for needles 13, 22 and 24.
