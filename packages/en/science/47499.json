Justly has\r\nit been observed, that to the magic pens of Madame D’Arblay and\r\nyourself we are indebted for having the Novel restored to its\r\nconsequence, and, therefore, to its usefulness; and I may be allowed to\r\nadd, that your Harry and Lucy has shown how profitably, and agreeably,\r\nthe machinery of fiction may be worked for the dissemination of truth.\r\n\r\nThat a life which has been so honourable to yourself, and so\r\nserviceable to the commonwealth, may be long extended, and deservedly\r\nenjoyed, is the fervent wish of\r\n\r\n                                                             THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n    _London,\r\nFebruary 1839._\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TO THE READER.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\nTell me, gentle Reader, whether thou hast not heard of the box of\r\nPandora, which was no sooner opened by the unhappy Epimetheus, than it\r\ngave flight to a troop of malevolent spirits, which have ever since\r\ntormented the human race.--Behold!--I here present you with a magic\r\ncasket, containing a GENIUS alone capable of counteracting their\r\ndireful spells. Thou mayest, perhaps, say that its aspect but ill\r\naccords with the richness of its promised treasure; so appeared the\r\ncopper vessel found by the fisherman, as related in the Arabian tale;\r\nbut, remember, that no sooner had he broken its mystic seal, than the\r\nimprisoned genius spread itself over the ocean and raised its giant\r\nlimbs above the clouds. But this was an evil and treacherous spirit;\r\nmine is as benevolent as he is mighty, and seeks communion with our\r\nrace for no other object than to render mortals virtuous and happy. To\r\nbe plain, for you must already, my young friends, have unriddled my\r\nallegory, his name is PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\nIn your progress through life, be not so vain as to believe that you\r\nwill escape the evils with which its path is beset. Arm yourselves,\r\ntherefore, with the talisman that can, at once, deprive adversity of\r\nits sting, and prosperity of its dangers; for such, believe me, is the\r\nrare privilege of philosophy.\r\n\r\nI must now take leave of you, for a short time, in order that I may\r\naddress a few words to your parents and preceptors; but, as I have no\r\nplot to abridge your liberties, or lengthen your hours of study, you\r\nmay listen to my address without alarm, and to my plan without\r\nsuspicion. Imagine not, however, that I shall recommend the dismissal\r\nof the cane, or the whip; on the contrary, I shall insist upon them as\r\nnecessary and indispensable instruments for the accomplishment of my\r\ndesign. But the method of applying them will be changed; with the one I\r\nshall construct the bow of the kite, with the other I shall spin the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nThe object of the present work is to inculcate that early love of\r\nscience which can never be derived from the sterner productions. Youth\r\nis naturally addicted to amusement, and in this item his expenditure\r\ntoo often exceeds his allotted income. I have, therefore, taken the\r\nliberty to draw a draft upon Philosophy, with the full assurance that\r\nit will be gratefully repaid, with compound interest, ten years after\r\ndate. But to be serious; those who superintend the education of youth\r\nshould be apprised of the great importance of the first impressions.\r\nRousseau has said, that the seeds of future vices or virtues are more\r\nfrequently sown by the mother than the tutor; thereby intimating, that\r\nthe characters of men are often determined by the earliest impressions;\r\nand, of so much moment did Quintillian regard this truth, that he\r\nrecommends to us the example of Philip, who did not suffer any other\r\nthan Aristotle to teach Alexander to read. In like manner those who do\r\nnot commence their study of nature at an early season, will afterwards\r\nhave many unnecessary obstacles to encounter. The difficulty of\r\ncomprehending the principles of Natural Philosophy frequently arises\r\nfrom their being at variance with those false ideas which early\r\nassociations have impressed upon the mind; the first years of study\r\nare, therefore, expended in _un_learning, and in clearing away the\r\nweeds, which would never have taken root in a properly cultivated soil.\r\nWriters on practical education have repeatedly advocated the advantages\r\nof the plan I am so anxious to enforce; but, strange to say, it is only\r\nwithin a few years that any works have appeared at all calculated to\r\nafford the necessary assistance. In short, previous to the labours of\r\nMrs. Marcet and Miss Edgeworth, the productions published for the\r\npurpose of juvenile instruction may be justly charged with the grossest\r\nerrors; and must have proved as destructive to the mind of the young\r\nreader, as the book presented by the physician Douban is said to have\r\nbeen to the Grecian king, who, as the Arabian tale relates, imbibed\r\nfresh poison as he turned over each leaf, until he fell lifeless in the\r\npresence of his courtiers; or, to give another illustration, as\r\nmischievous as the magic volume of Michael Scott, which, as Dempster\r\ninforms us, could not be opened without the danger of invoking some\r\nmalignant fiend by the operation. How infinitely superior in execution\r\nand purpose are the juvenile works of the present century!--to borrow a\r\nmetaphor from Coleridge, they may be truly said to resemble a\r\ncollection of mirrors set in the same frame, each having its own focus\r\nof knowledge, yet all capable of converging to one point.\r\n\r\nAllow me, friendly Reader, before I conclude my address, to say a few\r\nwords upon the plan and execution of the work before you. It is not\r\nintended to supersede or clash with any of the elementary treatises to\r\nwhich I have alluded; indeed its plan is so peculiar, that I apprehend\r\nsuch a charge cannot be brought against it. The author originally\r\ncomposed it for the exclusive use of his children, and would certainly\r\nnever have consigned it to the press, but at the earnest solicitations\r\nof those friends upon whose judgment he places the utmost reliance. Let\r\nthis be received as an answer to those, who, believing that they can\r\nrecognise the writer, may be induced to exclaim with Menedemus in\r\nTerence,--“_Tantumne est ab re tuâ otii tibi aliena ut cures, eaque\r\nnihil quæ ad te attinent?_” [1]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to offer any apology for the conversational\r\nplan of instruction; the success of Mrs. Marcet’s dialogues has placed\r\nits value beyond dispute. It may, however, be observed, that this\r\nspecies of composition may be executed in two different ways, either as\r\ndirect conversation, where none but the speakers appear, which is the\r\nmethod used by Plato; or as the recital of a conversation, where the\r\nauthor himself appears, and gives an account of what passed in\r\ndiscourse, which is the plan generally adopted by Cicero. The reader is\r\naware, that Mrs. Marcet, in her “Conversations on Philosophy,” has\r\nadopted the former, while Miss Edgeworth, in her “Harry and Lucy,” has\r\npreferred the latter method. In composing the present work I have\r\nfollowed the plan of the last-mentioned authoress. Its advantages over\r\nthe more direct conversational style appear to consist in allowing\r\noccasional remarks, which come more aptly from the author than from any\r\nof the characters engaged in the dialogue.\r\n\r\nIf scientific dialogues are less popular in our times than they were in\r\nancient days, it must be attributed to the frigid and insipid manner in\r\nwhich they have too frequently been executed; if we except the mere\r\nexternal forms of conversation, and that one character is made to\r\nspeak, and the other to answer, they are altogether the same as if the\r\nauthor himself spoke throughout the whole, instead of amusing with a\r\nvaried style of conversation, and with a display of consistent and\r\nwell-supported characters. The introduction of a person of humour, to\r\nenliven the discourse, is sanctioned by the highest authority. Cæsar is\r\nthus introduced by Cicero, and Cynthio by Addison. In the introduction\r\nof Mr. Twaddleton and Major Snapwell, I am well aware of the criticisms\r\nto which I am exposed; I have exercised my fancy with a freedom and\r\nlatitude, for which, probably, there is not any precedent in a\r\nscientific work. I have even ventured so far to deviate from the beaten\r\ntrack as to skirmish upon the frontiers of the Novelist, and to bring\r\noff captive some of the artillery of Romance; but if, by so doing, I\r\nhave enhanced the interest of my work, and furthered the accomplishment\r\nof its object, let me intreat that mere novelty may not be urged to its\r\ndisparagement. The antiquarian Vicar, however, will, I trust, meet with\r\ncordial reception from the classical student. As to Ned Hopkins,\r\nalthough he may not bear a comparison with William Summers, the fool of\r\nHenry VIII.--or with Richard Tarlton, who “_undumpished_ Queen\r\nElizabeth at his pleasure;” or with Archibald Armstrong (vulgo\r\n_Archee_) Jester to Charles,--yet I will maintain, in spite of the\r\nVicar’s censure, that he is a right merry fellow, and to the Major, and\r\nconsequently to our history, a most important accessary.\r\n\r\nIf it be argued that several of my comic representations are\r\ncalculated, like seasoning, to stimulate the palate of the\r\nnovel-reader, rather than to nourish the minds of the younger class,\r\nfor whom the work was written, I might, were I so disposed, plead\r\ncommon usage; for does not the director of a juvenile fête courteously\r\nintroduce a few piquant dishes, for the entertainment of those elder\r\npersonages who may attend in the character of a chaperone? You surely\r\ncould not deny me the full benefit of such a precedent; and so, Gentle\r\nReader, I bid thee--Farewell!\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n    “Have you such leisure from your own affairs\r\n    To think of those that don’t concern you?”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

various toys and sports._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer recess of Mr. Pearson’s school was not more anxiously\r\nanticipated by the scholars than it was by the numerous family of\r\nSeymour, who, at the commencement of the year, had parted from a\r\nbeloved son and brother for the first time. As the season of relaxation\r\napproached, so did the inmates of Overton Lodge (for such was the name\r\nof Mr. Seymour’s seat) betray increasing impatience for its arrival.\r\nThe three elder sisters, Louisa, Fanny, and Rosa, had been engaged for\r\nseveral days in arranging the little study which their brother Tom had\r\nusually occupied. His books were carefully replaced on their shelves,\r\nand bunches of roses and jasmines, which the affectionate girls had\r\nculled from the finest trees in the garden, were tastefully dispersed\r\nthrough the apartment; the festoons of blue ribbons, with which they\r\nwere entwined, at once announced themselves as the work of graceful\r\nhands, impelled by light hearts; and every flower might be said to\r\nreflect from its glowing petals the smiles with which it had been\r\ncollected and arranged. At length the happy day arrived; a post-chaise\r\ndrew up to the front gate, and Tom was once again folded in the arms of\r\nhis affectionate and delighted parents. The little group surrounded\r\ntheir beloved brother, and welcomed his return with all the warmth and\r\nartlessness of juvenile sincerity. “Well,” said Mr. Seymour, “if the\r\nimprovement of your mind corresponds with that of your looks, I shall\r\nindeed have reason to congratulate myself upon the choice of your\r\nschool. But have you brought me any letter from Mr. Pearson?” “I have,”\r\nreplied Tom, who presented his father with a note from his master, in\r\nwhich he had commented, in high terms of commendation, not only upon\r\nTom’s general conduct, but upon the rapid progress which he had made in\r\nhis classical studies.\r\n\r\n“My dearest boy,” exclaimed the delighted father, “I am more than\r\nrepaid for the many anxious moments which I have passed on your\r\naccount. I find that your conduct has given the highest satisfaction to\r\nyour master; and that your good-nature, generosity, and, above all,\r\nyour strict adherence to truth, have ensured the love and esteem of\r\nyour school-fellows.” This gratifying report brought tears of joy into\r\nthe eyes of Mrs. Seymour; Tom’s cheek glowed with the feeling of\r\nconscious merit; and the sisters interchanged looks of mutual\r\nsatisfaction. Can there be an incentive to industry and virtuous\r\nconduct so powerful as the exhilarating smiles of approbation which the\r\nschool-boy receives from an affectionate parent? Tom would not have\r\nexchanged his feelings for all the world, and he internally vowed that\r\nhe would never deviate from a course that had been productive of so\r\nmuch happiness.\r\n\r\n“But come,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “let us all retire into the library.\r\nI am sure that our dear fellow will be glad of some refreshment after\r\nhis journey.”\r\n\r\nWe shall here leave the family circle to the undisturbed enjoyment of\r\ntheir domestic banquet, and invite the reader to accompany us in a\r\nstroll about the grounds of this beautiful and secluded retreat.\r\n\r\nWe are amongst those who believe that the habits and character of a\r\nfamily may be as easily discovered from the rural taste displayed in\r\nthe grounds which surround their habitation, as by any examination of\r\nthe prominences on their heads, or of the lineaments in their faces.\r\nHow vividly is the decline of an ancient race depicted by the chilling\r\ndesolation which reigns around the mansion, and by the rank weed which\r\ninsolently triumphs over its fading splendour; and how equally\r\nexpressive of the peaceful and contented industry of the thriving\r\ncottager, is the well cultivated patch which adjoins the humble\r\ndwelling, around whose rustic porch the luxuriant lilac clusters, or\r\nthe aspiring woodbine twines its green tendrils and sweetly-scented\r\nblossoms! In like manner did the elegantly disposed grounds of Overton\r\nLodge at once announce the classic taste and fostering presence of a\r\nrefined and highly cultivated family.\r\n\r\nThe house, which was in the Ionic style of architecture, was situated\r\non the declivity of a hill, so that the verdant lawn which was spread\r\nbefore its southern front, after retaining its level for a short\r\ndistance, gently sloped to the vale beneath, and was terminated by a\r\nluxuriant shrubbery, over which the eye commanded a range of fair\r\nenclosure, beautified by an irregularly undulating surface, and\r\ninterspersed with rich masses of wood. The uniformity of the lawn was\r\nbroken by occasional clumps of flowering shrubs, so artfully selected\r\nand arranged, as to afford all the varied charms of contrast; while,\r\nhere and there, a lofty elm flung its gigantic arms over the sward\r\nbeneath, and cast a deep shade, which enabled the inhabitants of the\r\nLodge to enjoy the air, even during the heat of a meridian sun. The\r\nshrubbery, which occupied a considerable portion of the valley,\r\nstretched for some distance up the western part of the hill; and, could\r\nShenstone have wandered through its winding paths and deep recesses,\r\nhis favourite Leasowes might have suffered from a comparison. Here were\r\nmingled shrubs of every varied dye; the elegant foliage of white and\r\nscarlet acacias was blended with the dark-green-leaved chestnut; and\r\nthe stately branches of the oak were relieved by the gracefully\r\npendulous boughs of the beech. At irregular intervals, the paths\r\nexpanded into verdant glades, in each of which the bust of some\r\ndeparted poet or philosopher announced the genius to which they were\r\nseverally consecrated. From a description of one or two of these\r\nsequestered spots, the reader will readily conceive the taste displayed\r\nin those upon which our limits will not allow us to dwell.\r\n\r\nAfter winding, for some distance, through a path so closely interwoven\r\nwith shrubs and trees, that scarcely a sunbeam could struggle through\r\nthe foliage, a gleam of light burst through the gloom, and displayed a\r\nbeautiful marble figure, which had been executed by a Roman artist,\r\nrepresenting Flora in the act of being attired by Spring. It was placed\r\nin the centre of the expanse formed by the retiring trees, and at its\r\nbase were flowering, at measured intervals, a variety of those plants\r\nto which Linnæus has given the name of _Equinoctial flowers_, since\r\nthey open and close at certain and exact hours of the day, and thus by\r\nproper arrangement constitute the HOROLOGE OF FLORA,(1)[2] or Nature’s\r\ntime-piece. It had been constructed, under the direction of her mother,\r\nby Louisa Seymour. The hour of the day at which each plant opened, was\r\nrepresented by an appropriate figure of nicely trimmed box; and these,\r\nbeing arranged in a circle, not only fulfilled the duty, but exhibited\r\nthe appearance of a dial.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  These figures refer to the additional notes at the end of the work.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom this retreat several winding paths threaded their mazy way through\r\nthe deep recesses of the wood; and the wanderer, quitting for a while\r\nthe blaze of day, was refreshed by the subdued light which everywhere\r\npervaded the avenue, except where the hand of taste had, here and\r\nthere, turned aside the boughs, and opened a vista to bring the village\r\nspire into view, or to gladden the sight by a rich prospect of the\r\ndistant landscape. After having descended for some way, the path,\r\nlosing its inclined direction, proceeded on a level, and thus announced\r\nto the stranger his arrival at the bottom of the valley. What a rich\r\ndisplay of woodland scenery was suddenly presented to his view! A rocky\r\nglen, in which large masses of sandstone were grouped with picturesque\r\nboldness, terminated the path, and formed an area wherein he might gaze\r\non the mighty sylvan amphitheatre, which gradually rose to a towering\r\nheight above him, and seemed to interpose an insuperable barrier\r\nbetween the solitude of this sequestered spot and the busy haunts of\r\nmen; not a sound assailed the ear, save the murmur of the summer\r\nbreeze, as it swept the trembling foliage, or the brawling of a small\r\nmountain stream, which gushed from the rock, and, like an angry chit,\r\nfretted and fumed as it encountered the obstacles that had been raised\r\nby its own impetuosity. This was the favourite retreat of Mr. Seymour,\r\nand he had dedicated it to the genius of geology; here had he erected a\r\ntemple to the memory of Werner, and every pillar and ornament bore\r\ntestimony to the refined taste of its architect. It consisted of a\r\ndome, constructed of innumerable shells and corallines, and surmounted\r\nby a marble figure of Atlas, bearing the globe on his shoulders, upon\r\nwhich the name of WERNER was inscribed. The dome was supported by\r\ntwelve pillars of so singular and beautiful a construction as to merit\r\na particular description: the Corinthian capital of each was of\r\nPentelican marble; the column consisted of a spiral of about six inches\r\nin breadth, which wound round a central shaft of not more than two\r\ninches in diameter; upon this spiral were placed specimens of various\r\nrocks, of such masses as to fill up the outline, and to present to the\r\neye the appearance of a substantial and well-proportioned pillar. These\r\nspecimens were arranged in an order corresponding with their\r\nacknowledged geological relations; thus, the _Diluvial_ productions\r\noccupied the higher compartments; the _Primitive_ strata, the lower\r\nones; and the _Secondary_ and _Transition_ series found an intermediate\r\nplace. The tessellated floor presented the different varieties of\r\nmarble, so artfully interspersed as to afford a most harmonious\r\ncombination; the _Unicoloured, variegated, Madreporic_, the\r\n_Lumachella, Cipolino_, and _Breccia_ marbles, were each represented by\r\na characteristic and well-defined specimen. The alcoved ceiling was\r\nstudded with _Rock Crystal_, calcareous _Stalactites_, and beautiful\r\n_Calcedonies_. A group of figures in _basso relievo_ adorned the wall\r\nwhich enclosed about a third part of the interior of the temple, and\r\nits subject gave evidence of the Wernerian devotion of Mr. Seymour; for\r\nit represented a contest between Pluto and Neptune, in which the watery\r\ngod was seen in the act of wresting the burning torch from the hand of\r\nhis adversary, in order to quench it in the ocean. Mr. Seymour had\r\nstudied in the school of Freyburg, under the auspices of its celebrated\r\nprofessor; and, like all the pupils of Werner, he pertinaciously\r\nmaintained the aqueous origin of our strata. But let us return to the\r\nhappy party at the Lodge, whom the reader will remember we left at\r\ntheir repast. This having been concluded, and all those various\r\nsubjects discussed, and questions answered, which the school-boy, who\r\nhas ever felt the satisfaction of returning home for the holidays, will\r\nmore easily conceive than we can describe, Tom enquired of his father,\r\nwhether his old friend, Mr. Twaddleton, the Vicar of Overton, was well,\r\nand at the Parsonage. “He is quite well,” replied Mr. Seymour, “and so\r\nanxious to see you, that he has paid several visits, during the\r\nmorning, to enquire whether you had arrived. Depend upon it, that many\r\nhours will not elapse before you see him.”\r\n\r\nIn that wish did Tom and the whole juvenile party heartily concur; for\r\nthe vicar, notwithstanding his oddities, was the most affectionate\r\ncreature in existence, and never was he more truly happy than when\r\ncontributing to the innocent amusement of his little “_playmates_,” as\r\nhe used to call Tom and his sisters.\r\n\r\nIt may be here necessary to present the reader with a short sketch of\r\nthe character of a person, who will be hereafter found to perform a\r\nprominent part in the little drama of Overton Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Peter Twaddleton, Master of Arts, and Fellow of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, for we must introduce him in due form, was about fifty-two\r\nyears of age, twenty of which he had spent at Cambridge, as a resident\r\nFellow of Jesus College. He had not possessed the vicarage of Overton\r\nabove eight or nine years; and, although its value never exceeded a\r\nhundred and eighty pounds a year, so limited were his wants, and so\r\nfrugal his habits, that he generally contrived to save a considerable\r\nsum out of his income, in order that he might devote it to purposes of\r\ncharity and benevolence: his charity, however, was not merely of the\r\nhand, but of the heart; distress was unknown in his village; he fed the\r\nhungry, nursed the sick, and cheered the unfortunate; his long\r\ncollegiate residence had imparted to his mind several peculiar traits,\r\nand a certain stiffness of address and quaintness of manner which at\r\nonce distinguish the recluse from the man of the world; in short, as\r\nShakspeare expresses it, “_he was not hackneyed in the ways of men_.”\r\nHis face was certainly the very reverse to everything that could be\r\nconsidered “good-looking,” and yet, when he smiled, there was an\r\nanimation that redeemed the irregularity of his angular features; so\r\nbenevolent was the expression of his countenance, that it was\r\nimpossible not to feel that sentiment of respect and admiration which\r\nthe presence of a superior person is wont to inspire; but his\r\nsuperiority was rather that of the heart than of the head; not that we\r\nwould insinuate any deficiency in intellect, but that his moral\r\nexcellencies were so transcendent as to throw into the shade all those\r\nmental qualities which he possessed in common with the world. He\r\nentertained a singular aversion to the mathematics, a prejudice which\r\nwe are inclined to refer to his disappointment in the senate-house;\r\nfor, although he was known at Cambridge as one of those “pale beings in\r\nspectacles and cotton stockings,” commonly called “_reading men_,” yet,\r\nafter all his exertions, he only succeeded in obtaining the “_wooden\r\nspoon_,” an honour which devolves upon the last of the “_junior\r\noptimes_.” Whether his failure arose from an exuberant or a deficient\r\ngenius, or, to speak _phrenologically_, from an excess in his _number\r\nof bumps_, or a defect in his _bump of numbers_, we are really unable\r\nto state, never having had an opportunity of verifying our suspicions\r\nby a manual examination of his cranium; he was, however, well read in\r\nthe classics, and so devoted to the works of Virgil that he never lost\r\nan opportunity of quoting his favourite poet; and it must be admitted,\r\nthat, although these quotations so generally pervaded his conversation\r\nas to become irksome, they were sometimes apposite, and now and then\r\neven witty. But notwithstanding the delight which he experienced in a\r\n_lusus verborum_ in a learned language, of such contradictory materials\r\nwas he compossed, that his antipathy to an English pun was extravagant\r\nand ridiculous. This peculiarity has been attributed, but we speak\r\nmerely from common report, to a disgust which he contracted for that\r\nspecies of spurious wit, during his frequent intercourse with the\r\nJohnians, a race of students who have, from time immemorial, been\r\nidentified with the most profligate class of punsters; be this,\r\nhowever, as it may, we are inclined to believe that a person who\r\nresides much amongst those who are addicted to this _vice_, unless he\r\nquickly takes the infection, acquires a sort of constitutional\r\ninsusceptibility, like nurses, who pass their lives in infected\r\napartments with perfect safety and impunity. His favourite, and we\r\nmight add his only pursuit, beyond the circle of his profession, was\r\nthe study of antiquities; he was, as we have already stated, a Fellow\r\nof the Society of Antiquaries; had collected a very tolerable series of\r\nancient coins, and possessed sufficient critical acumen to distinguish\r\nbetween Attic _ærugo_, and the spurious _verdure_ of the modern\r\ncounterfeit. Often had he undertaken an expedition of a hundred miles\r\nto inspect the interior of an ancient barrow, or to examine the\r\nmouldering fragments of some newly-discovered monument; indeed, like\r\nthe connoisseur in cheese, blue-mould and decay were the favourite\r\nobjects of his taste, and the sure passports to his favour; for he\r\ndespised all _living_ testimony, but that of worms and maggots. A coin\r\nwith the head of a _living_ sovereign passed through his hands with as\r\nlittle resistance as water through a sieve, but he grasped the head of\r\nan Antonine or Otho with insatiable and relentless avarice. Mr.\r\nTwaddleton’s figure exceeded the middle stature, and was so extremely\r\nslender as to give him the air and appearance of a tall man. He was\r\nusually dressed in an old-fashioned suit of black cloth, consisting of\r\na single-breasted coat, with a standing collar, and deep comprehensive\r\ncuffs, and a flapped waistcoat; but so awkwardly did these vestments\r\nconform with the contour of his person, that we might have supposed\r\nthem the production of those Laputan tailors who wrought by\r\nmathematical principles, and held in sovereign contempt the illiterate\r\nfashioners who deemed it necessary to measure the forms of their\r\ncustomers; although it was whispered by certain censorious spinsters in\r\nthe village that the aforesaid mathematical artists were better\r\nacquainted with the _angles_ of the Seven Dials, than with the\r\n_squares_ of the west end. They farther surmised that the vicar’s\r\nannual journey to London, which in truth was undertaken with no other\r\nobjects than those of attending the anniversary of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, on Saint George’s day, and of inspecting the cabinets of\r\nhis old crony, the celebrated medallist of Tavistock-street, was for\r\nthe laudable purpose of recruiting his wardrobe. If the aforesaid coat,\r\nwith its straggling and disproportioned suburbs, possessed an amplitude\r\nof dimensions which ill accorded with the slender wants of his person,\r\nthis misapplied liberality was more than compensated by the rigid\r\neconomy exhibited in the _nether_ part of his costume, which evidently\r\nhad not been designed by a contemporary artisan; not so his shoes,\r\nwhich, for the accommodation of those unwelcome parasites, vulgarly\r\ncalled _corns_, were constructed in the form of a battledore, and\r\ndisplayed such an unbecoming quantity of leather, that, as Ned Hopkins,\r\na subaltern wit of the village alehouse, observed, “however economical\r\ntheir parson might appear, he was undoubtedly _supported in\r\nextravagance_.” Nor did the natural association between tithes and\r\n“_corn-bags_” escape his observation, but was repeated with various\r\nother allusions of equal piquancy, to the no small annoyance of the\r\nreverend gentleman, and, as he declared, to the disparagement of his\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nAfter the social repast had been concluded, Tom proposed a ramble\r\nthrough the shrubbery. He was anxious to revisit the scene of his\r\nformer sports; and Louisa readily met his wishes, for she was also\r\ndesirous of showing him the _botanical clock_, which had been planned\r\nand completed since his absence. Mr. Seymour accompanied his children,\r\nand, as they walked across the lawn, Tom asked his father whether he\r\nremembered the promise he had made him on quitting home for school,\r\nthat of furnishing him with some new amusements during the holidays.\r\n\r\n“I perfectly remember,” said his father, “the promise to which you\r\nallude, and I hope that you equally well recollect the conditions with\r\nwhich it was coupled. When your mamma gave you a copy of Mrs. Marcet’s\r\ninstructive Dialogues on Natural Philosophy, I told you that, after you\r\nhad studied the principles which that work so admirably explains, you\r\nwould have but little difficulty in understanding the philosophy of\r\ntoys, or the manner in which each produced its amusing effects; and\r\nthat, when the midsummer holidays commenced, I would successively\r\nsupply you with a new amusement, whenever you could satisfactorily\r\nexplain the principles of those you already possessed. Was not that our\r\ncontract?”\r\n\r\n“It was,” exclaimed Tom, with great eagerness, “and I am sure I shall\r\nwin the prize, whenever you will try me, and I hope my mamma and\r\nsisters will be present.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Mr. Seymour, “and I trust that Louisa and Fanny,\r\nwho are of an age to understand the subject, will not prove\r\nuninterested spectators. John, too, will profit by our scheme; for, as\r\nI shall necessarily require, for illustration, certain toys which can\r\nscarcely afford any amusement to a boy of your age and acquirements, it\r\nis but fair that they should be transferred into his hands; our little\r\nphilosopher, Matthew, will also, I am sure, enter into the spirit of\r\nour pastimes with the greatest satisfaction.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you! thank you! dear papa,” was simultaneously shouted by\r\nseveral voices, and the happy children looked forward to the morrow\r\nwith that mixed sensation of impatience and delight which always\r\nattends juvenile anticipations.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, the vicar was seen approaching, and Tom and\r\nhis sisters immediately ran forward to greet him.\r\n\r\n“My dear boy,” exclaimed the vicar, “I am truly rejoiced to see\r\nyou;--when did you arrive from school?--How goes on Virgil?--Hey, my\r\nboy?--You must be delighted with the great Mantuan bard;--now confess,\r\nyou little Trojan, can you eat a cheesecake without being reminded of\r\nthe Harpy’s prophecy, and its fulfilment, as discovered by young\r\nAscanius:--\r\n\r\n             Heus! etiam _mensas_ consumimus, inquit Iulus.\r\n\r\n                                                           ÆN. vii. 116.\r\n\r\n“But, bless me, how amazingly you have grown! and how healthy you\r\nlook!” Tom took advantage of this pause in the vicar’s address, which\r\nhad hitherto flowed in so uninterrupted and rapid a stream as to\r\npreclude the possibility of any reply to his questions, to inform him\r\nthat his father was on the lawn, and desirous of seeing him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Twaddleton,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “you are just in time to\r\nwitness the commencement of a series of amusements, which I have\r\nproposed for Tom’s instruction during the holidays.”\r\n\r\n“Amusement and instruction,” replied the vicar, “are not synonymous in\r\nmy vocabulary; unless, indeed, they be applied to the glorious works of\r\nVirgil; but let me hear your scheme.”\r\n\r\n“I have long thought,” said Mr. Seymour, “that all the first principles\r\nof natural philosophy might be easily taught, and beautifully\r\nillustrated, by the common toys which have been invented for the\r\namusement of youth.”\r\n\r\n“A fig for your philosophy,” was the unceremonious and chilling reply\r\nof the vicar. “What have boys,” continued he, “to do with philosophy?\r\nLet them learn their grammar, scan their hexameters, and construe\r\nVirgil; it is time enough to inflict upon them the torments of science\r\nafter their names have been entered on the University boards.”\r\n\r\n“I differ from you entirely, my worthy friend; the principles of\r\nnatural philosophy cannot be too early inculcated, nor can they be too\r\nwidely diffused. It is surely a great object to engage the\r\nprepossessions on the side of truth, and to direct the natural\r\ncuriosity of youth to useful objects.”\r\n\r\n“Hoity toity!” exclaimed the reverend gentleman, “such principles\r\naccord not with my creed; heresy, downright heresy; that a man of your\r\nexcellent sense and intelligence can be so far deceived! But the world\r\nhas run mad; and much do I grieve to find, that the seclusion of\r\nOverton Lodge has not secured its inmates from the infection. I came\r\nhere, Mr. Seymour, to receive your sympathy, and to profit by your\r\ncounsel, but, alas! alas! I have fallen into the camp of the enemy.\r\n‘_Medios delapsus in hostes_,’ as Virgil has it.”\r\n\r\n“You astonish me--what can have happened?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“There is Tom Plank, the carpenter,” said the vicar, “soliciting\r\nsubscriptions for the establishment of a philosophical society. I\r\nunderstand that this mania--for by what other, or more charitable term\r\ncan I express such conduct?--has seized this deluded man since his\r\nreturn from London, where he has been informed that all the ‘hewers of\r\nwood and drawers of water’ are about to associate themselves into\r\nsocieties for the promotion of science. Preposterous idea! as if a\r\nblock of wood could not be split without a knowledge of the doctrine of\r\npercussion, nor a pail of water drawn from the well without an\r\nacquaintance with hydrostatics; but, as I am a Christian priest, I\r\nsolemnly declare, that I grieve only for my flock, and raise my feeble\r\nvoice for no other purpose than that of scaring the wolf from the fold:\r\nto be angry, as Pope says, would be to revenge the faults of others\r\nupon ourselves; but I am not angry, Mr. Seymour, I am vexed, sorely\r\nvexed.”\r\n\r\n“Take it not thus to heart, my dear vicar,” replied his consoling\r\nfriend; “‘_Solve metus_,’ as your poet has it. Science, I admit, is\r\nboth the Pallas and Pandora of mankind; its abuse may certainly prove\r\nmischievous, but its sober and well-timed application cannot fail to\r\nincrease the happiness of every class of mankind, as well as to advance\r\nand improve every branch of the mechanical arts; so thoroughly am I\r\nsatisfied upon this point, that I shall subscribe to the proposed\r\nsociety with infinite satisfaction.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Seymour! Mr. Seymour! you know not what you do. Would you scatter\r\nthe seeds of insubordination? manure the weeds of infidelity? fabricate\r\na battering-ram to demolish our holy church? Such, indeed, must be the\r\neffect of your Utopian scheme, for truly may I exclaim with the\r\nimmortal Maro--\r\n\r\n              In nostros fabricata est machina muros.”[3]\r\n\r\n“Come, come, my good friend, all this is declamation without argument.”\r\n\r\n“Without argument! Many are the sad instances which I could adduce in\r\nproof of the evil effects which have already accrued from this\r\nabominable system. I am not in the habit, Sir, of dealing in empty\r\nassertion; already has the aforesaid Tom Plank ventured to question the\r\nclassical knowledge of his spiritual pastor, and, as I understand, has\r\nopenly avowed himself, at the sixpenny club, as my rival in antiquarian\r\npursuits.”\r\n\r\n“And why should he not?” said the mischievous Mr. Seymour; “I warrant\r\nyou he already possesses many an _old saw_; ay, and of a very great\r\nage, too, if we may judge from the _loss of its teeth_.”\r\n\r\nDuring this remonstrance, Mr. Twaddleton had been occupied in whirling\r\nround his steel watch-chain with inconceivable rapidity, and, after a\r\nshort pause, he burst out into the following exclamation:--\r\n\r\n“Worthy Sir! if you persist in asserting, that a man whose occupation\r\nis to _plane deal_, is prepared to dive into the sacred mysteries of\r\nantiquity, I shall next expect to hear that”--\r\n\r\n“A truce, a truce,” cried Mr. Seymour, interrupting the vicar, “to all\r\nsuch hackneyed objections; and let us _deal plainly_ with your _planer\r\nof deals_: you assert that the carpenter cannot speak grammatically,\r\nand yet he gains his livelihood by _mending stiles_; you complain of\r\nhis presumption in argument, would it not be a desertion of his _post_\r\nto decline _railing_? and then, again, with respect to his antiquarian\r\npretensions, compare them with your own; _you_ rescue _saws from the\r\ndust_, _he_ obtains _dust_ from his saws.”\r\n\r\n“What madness has seized my unfortunate friend?\r\n\r\n               Infelix! quæ tanta animum dementia cepit?\r\n\r\nas Virgil has it:--But let it pass, let it pass, Mr. Seymour; my\r\nprofession has taught me to bear with humility and patience the\r\ncontempt and revilings of my brethren; I forgive Tom Plank for his\r\npresumption, as in that case I alone am the sufferer; but I say to you,\r\nthat envy, trouble, discontent, strife, and poverty, will be the fruits\r\nof the seeds you would scatter. I verily believe, that unless this\r\n‘march of intellect,’ as it has been termed, is speedily checked,\r\nOverton, in less than twelve months, will become a deserted village;\r\nfor there is scarcely a tradesman who is not already distracted by some\r\nvisionary scheme of scientific improvement, that leads to the neglect\r\nof their occupations, and the dissipation of the honest earnings which\r\ntheir more prudent fathers had accumulated; ‘_Meliora pii docuere\r\nparentes_,’ as the poet has it. What think you of Sam Corkington, who\r\nproposes to erect an apparatus in the crater of Mount Vesuvius, in\r\norder to supply every city on the continent with heat and light; or of\r\nBilly Spooner, who is about to establish a dairy at Spitzbergen, that\r\nhe may furnish all Europe with ice-cream from the milk of whales! ‘_O,\r\nviveret Democritus!_’”\r\n\r\nThe vicar was about to proceed with his lamentations, but the thread of\r\nhis discourse was suddenly snapped asunder, and his ideas thrown into\r\nthe wildest confusion, by the explosion of a most audacious pun, which\r\nin mercy to Mr. Seymour, as well as to our readers, we will not repeat.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Seymour,” exclaimed the incensed vicar, “we will, if you please,\r\nterminate our discourse; I perceive that you are determined to meet my\r\nremonstrances with ridicule; when I had hoped to bring an argument\r\nincapable of refutation, _Tum variæ illudunt pestes_, as Virgil has it.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, allow me to ask,” said Mr. Seymour, “whether my puns, or your\r\nquotations, best merit the title of _pestes_?”\r\n\r\n“That you should compare the vile practice of punning with the elegant\r\nand refined habit of conveying our ideas by classic symbols, does\r\nindeed surprise and disturb me. Pope has said that words are the\r\ncounters by which men represent their thoughts; the plebeian,”\r\ncontinued the vicar, “selects base metal for their construction, while\r\nthe scholar forms them of gold and gems, dug from the richest mines of\r\nantiquity. But to what vile purpose does the punster prostitute such\r\ncounters? Not for the interchange of ideas, but, like the juggler, to\r\ndeceive and astonish by acts of legerdemain.”\r\n\r\n“How fortunate is it that you had not lived in the reign of King\r\nJames,” remarked Mr. Seymour; “for that singular monarch, as you may,\r\nperhaps, remember, made very few bishops who had not thus signalised\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\n“To poison our ears by quibbles and quirks did well become him who\r\nsought to deceive our senses and blind our reason--the patron of puns\r\nand the believer in witchcraft were suitably united,” replied the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Seymour, “as this is a subject upon which it is not\r\nlikely that we should agree, I will pass to another, where I hope to be\r\nmore successful; I trust I shall induce you to view with more\r\ncomplacency my project of teaching philosophy by the aid of toys and\r\nsports.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Seymour, the proposal of instructing children in the principles of\r\nnatural philosophy, is really too visionary to require calm discussion;\r\nand can be equalled only in absurdity by the method you propose for\r\ncarrying it into effect.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, my dear vicar, pray chain up your prejudices, and let your\r\nkind spirit loose for half an hour: let me beg that you will so far\r\nindulge me,” said Mr. Seymour, “as to listen patiently to the plan by\r\nwhich it is my intention to turn sport into science, or, in other\r\nwords, toys into instruments of philosophical instruction.”\r\n\r\n“And is it then possible,” said the vicar, in a tone of supplication,\r\n“that you can seriously entertain so wild, and, I might even add, so\r\ncruel a scheme? Would you pursue the luckless little urchin from the\r\nschoolroom into the very playground, with your unrelenting tyranny? a\r\nsanctuary which the most rigid pedagogue has hitherto held inviolable.\r\nIs the buoyant spirit so forcibly, though perhaps necessarily,\r\nrepressed, during the hours of discipline, to have no interval for its\r\nfree and uncontrolled expansion? Your science, methinks, Mr. Seymour,\r\nmight have taught you a wiser lesson; for you must well know that the\r\nmost elastic body will lose that property by being constantly kept in a\r\nstate of tension.”\r\n\r\n“A fine specimen of sophistry, upon my word,” cried Mr. Seymour, “which\r\nwould, doubtless, raise every nursery-governess and doating grandmother\r\nin open rebellion against me: but let me add, that it ill becomes a man\r\nof liberal and enlarged ideas, to suffer his opinions to be the sport\r\nof mere words; for, that our present difference is an affair of words,\r\nand of words only, I will undertake to prove, to the satisfaction of\r\nany unprejudiced person. _Play_ and _work_--_amusement_ and\r\n_instruction_--_toys_ and _tasks_--are invariably but most\r\nunjustifiably employed as words of contrast and opposition; an error\r\nwhich has arisen from the indistinct and very indefinite ideas which we\r\nattach to such words. If the degree of mental exertion be said to\r\nconstitute the difference between _play_ and _work_, I am quite sure\r\nthat the definition would be violated in the first illustration; for\r\nlet me ask, when do boys exert so much thought as in carrying into\r\neffect their holiday schemes? The distinction may, perhaps, be made to\r\nturn upon the irksome feelings which might be supposed to attend the\r\ndrudgery of study, but this can never happen except from a vicious\r\nsystem of education that excludes the operations of thought; a school\r\nthat locks in the body, but locks out the mind: depend upon it, Mr.\r\nTwaddleton, that the human mind, whether in youth or manhood, is ever\r\ngratified by the acquisition of information; every occupation soon\r\ncloys, unless it be seasoned by this stimulant. Is not the child idle\r\nand miserable in a nursery full of playthings, and to what expedient\r\ndoes he instinctively fly to relieve his _ennui_? Why, he breaks his\r\ntoys to pieces, as Miss Edgeworth justly observes, not from the love of\r\nmischief, but from the hatred of idleness, or rather from an innate\r\nthirst after knowledge; and he becomes, as it were, an enterprising\r\nadventurer, and opens for himself a new source of pleasure and\r\namusement, in exploring the mechanism of their several parts. Think\r\nyou, then, Mr. Twaddleton, that any assistance which might be offered\r\nthe boy, under such circumstances, would be received by him as a task?\r\nCertainly not. The acquisition of knowledge then, instead of detracting\r\nfrom, must heighten the amusement of toys; and if I have succeeded in\r\nconvincing you of this truth, my object is accomplished.”\r\n\r\nThus did Mr. Seymour, like an able general, assail his adversary on his\r\nown ground; he drove him, as it were, into a corner, and by seizing the\r\nonly pass through which he could make his escape, forced him to\r\nsurrender at discretion.\r\n\r\n“Why, truly,” replied the vicar, after a short pause, “I am ready to\r\nadmit that there is much good sense in your observations; and, if the\r\nscientific instruction upon these occasions be not carried so far as to\r\npuzzle the boy, I am inclined to coincide with you.”\r\n\r\n“Therein lies the whole secret,” said Mr. Seymour: “when an occupation\r\nagreeably interests the understanding, imagination, or passions of\r\nchildren, it is what is commonly understood by the term _play_ or\r\n_sport_; whereas that which is not accompanied with such associations,\r\nand yet may be necessary for their future welfare, is, properly enough,\r\ndesignated as a _task_.”\r\n\r\n“I like the distinction,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Then may I hope that you will indulge me so far as to listen to the\r\nscheme by which it is my intention to turn ‘Sport into Science,’ or, in\r\nother words, _Toys_ into instruments of _Philosophical Instruction_?”\r\n\r\nThe vicar nodded assent.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour proceeded--“In the first place, I would give the boy some\r\ngeneral notions with regard to the properties of matter, such as its\r\ngravitation, vis inertiæ, elasticity, &c. What apparatus can be\r\nrequired for such a purpose, beyond some of the more simple toys?\r\nIndeed, I will undertake to demonstrate the three grand laws of motion\r\nby a game at ball; while the composition and resolution of forces may\r\nbe beautifully exemplified during a game of marbles, especially that of\r\n‘ring-taw;’ but in order that you may more clearly comprehend the\r\ncapability of my plan, allow me to enumerate the various philosophical\r\nprinciples which are involved in the operation of the several more\r\npopular toys and sports. We will commence with the ball; which will\r\nillustrate the nature and phenomena of _elasticity_, as it leaps from\r\nthe ground;--of _rotatory motion_, while it runs along its surface;--of\r\n_reflected motion_, and of the _angles of incidence and reflection_, as\r\nit rebounds from the wall;--and of _projectiles_, as it is whirled\r\nthrough the air; at the same time the cricket-bat may serve to explain\r\nthe _centre of percussion_. A game at marbles may be made subservient\r\nto the same purposes, and will farther assist us in conveying clear\r\nideas upon the subject of the _collision of elastic and non-elastic\r\nbodies_, and of their _velocities and direction after impact_. The\r\n_composition and resolution of forces_ may be explained at the same\r\ntime. The nature of _elastic springs_ will require no other apparatus\r\nfor its elucidation than Jack in the box, and the numerous\r\nleaping-frogs and cats with which the nursery abounds. The leathern\r\nsucker will exemplify the nature of _cohesion_, and the effect of water\r\nin filling up those inequalities by which contiguous surfaces are\r\ndeprived of their attractive power; it will, at the same time,\r\ndemonstrate the nature of a _vacuum_, and the influence of _atmospheric\r\npressure_. The squirt will afford a farther illustration of the same\r\nviews, and will furnish a practical proof of the weight of the\r\natmosphere in raising a column of water. The theory of the pump will\r\nnecessarily follow. The great elasticity of air, and the opposite\r\nproperty of water, I shall be able to show by the amusing exhibition of\r\nthe ‘_Bottle Imps_.’”\r\n\r\n“Bottle Imps!--‘_Acheronta movebis_,’” muttered the vicar.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour continued--“The various balancing toys will elucidate the\r\nnature of the _centre of gravity, point of suspension_, and _line of\r\ndirection_: the seesaw, rocking-horse, and the operation of walking on\r\nstilts, will here come in aid of our explanations. The combined effects\r\nof momentum and a change in the centre of gravity of a body may be\r\nbeautifully exemplified by the action of the Chinese Tumblers. The\r\nsling will demonstrate the existence and effect of _centrifugal force_;\r\nthe top and tetotum will prove the power of vertiginous motion to\r\nsupport the axis of a body in an upright position. The trundling of the\r\nhoop will accomplish the same and other objects. The game of\r\n_bilboquet_, or cup and ball, will show the influence of rotatory\r\nmotion in steadying the rectilinear path of a spherical body, whence\r\nthe theory of the rifle-gun may be deduced. For conveying some\r\nelementary ideas of the doctrine of _oscillation_, there is the swing.\r\nThe flight of the arrow will not only elucidate the principles of\r\n_projectiles_, but will explain the force of the air in producing\r\nrotatory motion by its impact on oblique surfaces: the revolution of\r\nthe shuttlecock may be shown to depend upon the same resolution of\r\nforces. Then comes the kite, one of the most instructive and amusing of\r\nall the pastimes of youth,--the favourite toy of Newton in his boyish\r\ndays:[4]--its ascent at once developes the theory of the composition\r\nand resolution of forces, and explains various subordinate principles,\r\nwhich I shall endeavour to describe when we arrive at the subject. The\r\n_see-saw_ will unfold the general principle upon which the Mechanical\r\nPowers are founded; and the boy may thus be easily led to the theory of\r\nthe _lever_, by being shown how readily he can balance the heavier\r\nweight of a man by riding on the longer arm of the plank. The theory of\r\ncolours may be pointed out to him as he blows his soap-bubbles;[5] an\r\namusement which will, at the same time, convince him that the air must\r\nexert a pressure equally in all directions. For explaining the theory\r\nof sound, there are the whistle, the humming-top, the whiz-gig, the\r\npop-gun, the bull-roarer, and sundry other amusements well known in the\r\nplay-ground; but it is not my intention, at present, to enumerate _all_\r\nthe toys which may be rendered capable of affording philosophical\r\ninstruction; I merely wish to convince you that my plan is not quite so\r\nchimerical as you were at first inclined to believe.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” said the vicar, “no squirrel ever hopped from branch to\r\nbranch with more agility,--you are the very counterpart of Cornelius\r\nScriblerus; but I must confess that your scheme is plausible, very\r\nplausible, and I shall no longer refuse to attend you in the progress\r\nof its execution.\r\n\r\n           Cedo equidem, nec, nate, tibi comes ire recuso,[6]\r\n\r\nas Virgil has it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour, however, saw very plainly that, although the vicar thus\r\nwithdrew his opposition, he was nevertheless very far from embarking in\r\nthe cause with enthusiasm, and that, upon the principle already\r\ndiscussed, he would perform his part rather as a _task_ than a\r\n_pastime_. Nor was the line which Mr. Twaddleton had quoted from the\r\nÆneid calculated to efface such an impression. It was true, that, like\r\nAnchises, he no longer refused to accompany him in his expedition; but,\r\nif the comparison were to run parallel, it was evident that he would\r\nhave to carry him as a dead weight on his shoulders. This difficulty,\r\nhowever, was speedily surmounted by an expedient, with which the reader\r\nwill become acquainted by the recital of what followed.\r\n\r\n“I rejoice greatly,” said Mr. Seymour, “that we have at length\r\nsucceeded in enlisting you into our service; without your able\r\nassistance, I fear that my instruction would be extremely imperfect;\r\nfor you must know, my dear sir, that I am ambitious of making Tom an\r\nantiquary as well as a philosopher, and I look to you for a history of\r\nthe several toys which I shall have occasion to introduce.”\r\n\r\nThis propitiatory sentence had its desired effect.\r\n\r\n“Most cheerfully shall I comply with your wishes,” exclaimed the\r\ndelighted vicar; “and I can assure you, sir, that, with regard to\r\nseveral of the more popular toys and pastimes, there is much very\r\ncurious and interesting lore.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour had upon this occasion succeeded in opening the heart of\r\nthe vicar, just as a skilful mechanic would pick a patent lock; who,\r\ninstead of forcing it by direct violence, seeks to discover the secret\r\nspring to which all its various movements are subservient.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, then,” cried the vicar, in a voice of great exultation, “we\r\nwill commence our career, from which I anticipate the highest\r\nsatisfaction and advantage; in the mean time,” continued he, “I will\r\nrefresh my memory upon certain points touching the antiquities of these\r\nsaid pastimes, or, as we used to say at college, _get up_ the subject.\r\nI will also press into our service my friend and neighbour Jeremy\r\nPrybabel, whose etymological knowledge will greatly assist us in\r\ntracing the origin of many of the words used in our sports, which is\r\nfrequently not very obvious.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour cast an intelligible glance at his wife, who was no less\r\nsurprised at the sudden change in the vicar’s sentiments than she was\r\npleased with the skill and address by which it had been accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kite with a smiling face, on a table with various other\r\ntoys.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n   “An engine’s raised to batter down our walls.”—ÆN. ii. 46.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Sir Isaac Newton is said to have been much attached to\r\n  Philosophical sports when a boy; he was the first to introduce\r\n  paper kites at Grantham, where he was at school.

In the one case, the particles of matter may be supposed to\r\nbe packed in a smaller compass; in the other, there must exist a\r\ngreater number of pores or interstices.”\r\n\r\n“I understand all you have said,” observed Louisa, “and yet I am unable\r\nto comprehend why the earth cannot be said to have any weight.”\r\n\r\n“Cannot you discover,” answered Mr. Seymour, “that, since the earth has\r\nnothing to attract it, it cannot have any attraction to resist, and,\r\nconsequently, according to the ordinary acceptation of the term, it\r\ncannot be correctly said to possess weight? although I confess that,\r\nwhen viewed in relation to the solar system, a question will arise upon\r\nthis subject, since it is attracted by the sun.”\r\n\r\nThe children declared themselves satisfied with this explanation, and\r\nMr. Seymour proceeded to put another question: “Since,” continued he,\r\n“you now understand the nature of that force by which bodies fall to\r\nthe earth, can you tell me the degree of velocity with which they fall?”\r\n\r\nTom asserted that the weight of the body, or its quantity of matter,\r\nand its distance from the surface of the earth, must, in every case,\r\ndetermine that circumstance; but Mr. Seymour excited his surprise by\r\nsaying, that it would not be influenced by either of those conditions;\r\nhe informed them, for instance, that a cannon-ball, and a marble, would\r\nfall through the same number of feet in a given time, and that, whether\r\nthe experiment were tried from the top of a house, or from the summit\r\nof Saint Paul’s, the same result would be obtained.\r\n\r\n“I am quite sure,” exclaimed Tom, “that, in the _Conversations on\r\nNatural Philosophy_, it is positively stated, that _attraction is\r\nalways in proportion to the quantity of matter_.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” observed Louisa, “and it is moreover asserted, that the\r\n_attraction diminishes as the distances increase_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour said, that he perceived the error under which his children\r\nlaboured, and that he would endeavour to remove it. “You cannot, my\r\ndears,” continued he, “divest your minds of that erroneous but natural\r\nfeeling, that a body necessarily falls to the ground without the\r\nexertion of any force: whereas, the greater the quantity of matter, the\r\ngreater must be the force exerted to bring it to the earth: for\r\ninstance, a substance which weighs a hundred pounds will thus require\r\njust ten times more force than one which only weighs ten pounds; and\r\nhence it must follow, that both will come to the ground at the same\r\nmoment; for, although, in the one case, there is ten times more matter,\r\nthere is, at the same time, ten times more attraction to overcome its\r\nresistance; for you have already admitted that the force of attraction\r\nis always in proportion to the quantity of matter. Now let us only for\r\nan instant, for the sake merely of argument, suppose that attraction\r\nhad been a force acting without any regard to quantity of matter, is it\r\nnot evident that, in such a case, the body containing the largest\r\nquantity would be the slowest in falling to the earth?”\r\n\r\n“I understand you, papa,” cried Tom: “if an empty waggon travelled four\r\nmiles an hour, and were afterwards so loaded as to have its weight\r\ndoubled, it could only travel at the rate of two miles in the same\r\nperiod, provided that in both cases the horses exerted the same\r\nstrength.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Mr. Seymour; “and to follow up your illustration, it is\r\nonly necessary to state, that Nature, like a considerate master, always\r\napportions the number of horses to the burthen that is to be moved, so\r\nthat her loads, whatever may be their weight, always travel at the same\r\nrate; or, to express the fact in philosophical instead of figurative\r\nlanguage, gravitation, or the force of the earth’s attraction, always\r\nincreases as the quantity of matter, and, consequently, that heavy and\r\nlight bodies, when dropped together from the same altitude, must come\r\nto the ground at the same instant of time.”\r\n\r\nLouisa had listened with great attention to this explanation; and\r\nalthough she thoroughly understood the argument, yet it appeared to her\r\nat variance with so many facts with which she was acquainted, that she\r\ncould not give implicit credence to it.\r\n\r\n“I think,” papa, said the archly-smiling girl, “I could overturn this\r\nfine argument by a very simple experiment.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! Miss Sceptic: then pray proceed; and I think we shall find,\r\nthat the more strenuously you oppose it, the more powerful it will\r\nbecome: but let us hear your objections.”\r\n\r\n“I shall only,” replied she, “drop a shilling, and a piece of paper,\r\nfrom my bed-room window upon the lawn, and request that you will\r\nobserve which of them reaches the ground first; if I am not much\r\nmistaken, you will find that the coin will strike the earth before the\r\npaper has performed half its journey.”\r\n\r\nTom appeared perplexed, and cast an enquiring look at his father.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Mr. Seymour, “I will perform this experiment myself, and\r\nendeavour to satisfy the doubts of our young sceptic; but I must first\r\ntake the opportunity to observe, that I am never better pleased than\r\nwhen you attempt to raise difficulties in my way, and I hope you will\r\nalways express them without reserve.”\r\n\r\n“Here, then, is a penny piece; and here,” said Tom, “is a piece of\r\npaper.”\r\n\r\n“Which,” continued Mr. Seymour, “we will cut into a corresponding shape\r\nand size.” This having been accomplished, he held the coin in one hand,\r\nand the paper disc in the other, and dropped them at the same instant.\r\n\r\n“There! there!” cried Louisa, with an air of triumph; “the coin reached\r\nthe ground long before the paper.”\r\n\r\n“I allow,” said Mr. Seymour, “that there was a distinct interval in\r\nfavour of the penny piece;” and he proceeded to explain the cause of\r\nit. He stated that the result was not contrary to the law of\r\ngravitation, since it arose from the interference of a foreign body,\r\nthe air, to the resistance of which it was to be attributed; and he\r\ndesired them to consider the particles of a falling body as being under\r\nthe influence of two opposing forces,--gravity, and the air’s\r\nresistance. Louisa argued, that the air could only act on the surface\r\nof a body, and as this was equal in both cases (the size of the paper\r\nbeing exactly the same as that of the penny piece), she could not see\r\nwhy the resistance of the air should not also be equal in both cases.\r\n\r\n“I admit,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the air can only act upon the\r\nsurface of a falling body, and this is the very reason of the paper\r\nmeeting with more resistance than the coin; for the latter, from its\r\ngreater density, must contain many more particles than the paper, and\r\nupon which the air cannot possibly exert any action; whereas almost\r\nevery particle of the paper may be said to be exposed to its\r\nresistance, the fall of the latter must therefore be more retarded than\r\nthat of the former body.”\r\n\r\nAt this explanation Louisa’s doubts began to clear off, and they were\r\nultimately dispelled on Mr. Seymour performing a modification of the\r\nabove experiment in the following manner. He placed the disc of paper\r\nin close contact with the upper part of the coin, and, in this\r\nposition, dropped them from his hand. They both reached the ground at\r\nthe same instant.\r\n\r\n“Are you now satisfied, my dear Louisa?” asked her father. “You\r\nperceive that, by placing the paper in contact with the coin, I\r\nskreened it from the action of the air, and the result is surely\r\nconclusive.”\r\n\r\n“Many thanks to you, dear papa; I am perfectly satisfied, and shall\r\nfeel less confident for the future.” Tom was delighted; for, as he\r\nsaid, he could now understand why John’s paper _parachute_ descended so\r\ndeliberately to the ground; he could also explain why feathers, and\r\nother light bodies, floated in the air. “Well then,” said Mr. Seymour,\r\n“having settled this knotty point, let us proceed to the other\r\nquestion, viz. ‘that a body will fall with the same velocity, during a\r\ngiven number of feet, from the ball of St. Paul’s as from the top of a\r\nhouse.’ You maintain, I believe, that, since the attraction of the\r\nearth for a body diminishes as its distance from it increases,[7] a\r\nsubstance at a great height ought to fall more slowly than one which is\r\ndropped from a less altitude.”\r\n\r\nNeither Tom nor Louisa could think otherwise. Mr. Seymour told them\r\nthat, _in theory_, they were perfectly correct, but that, since\r\nattraction acted from the centre, and not from the surface of the\r\nearth, the difference of its force could not be discovered at the small\r\nelevations to which they could have access: “for what,” said he, “can a\r\nfew hundred feet be in comparison with four thousand miles, which is\r\nthe distance from the centre to the surface of our globe?--You must\r\ntherefore perceive that, in all ordinary calculations respecting the\r\nvelocity of falling bodies, we may safely exclude such a consideration.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose,” said Tom, “it were possible to make the experiment a\r\nthousand miles above the earth, would not the diminished effect of\r\ngravity be discovered in that case?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied his father, “indeed it would be sensible at a\r\nmuch less distance: for instance, if a lump of lead, weighing a\r\nthousand pounds, were carried up only four miles, it would be found to\r\nhave lost two pounds of its weight.” (2)\r\n\r\n“This discussion,” observed Mr. Twaddleton, “reminds me of a problem\r\nthat was once proposed at Cambridge, to find the elevation to which the\r\nTower of Babel could have been raised, before the stones would have\r\nentirely lost their gravity.”\r\n\r\n“Its solution,” said Mr. Seymour, “would require a consideration which\r\nTom could not possibly understand at present, viz. the influence of the\r\n_centrifugal force_.”\r\n\r\n“I am fully aware of it,” replied the vicar, “and in order to\r\nappreciate that influence, it would, of course, be necessary to take\r\ninto account the latitude of the place; but, if my memory serves me, I\r\nthink that under the latitude of 30°, which I believe is nearly that of\r\nthe plains of Mesopotamia, the height would be somewhere about\r\ntwenty-four thousand miles.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour now desired Tom to inform him, since all bodies fall with\r\nthe _same_ velocity, what that velocity might be.\r\n\r\n“Sixteen feet in a second, papa;--I have just remembered that I had a\r\ndispute with a school-fellow upon that subject, and in which, thanks to\r\nMrs. Marcet, I came off victorious, and won twelve marbles.”\r\n\r\n“Then let me tell you, my fine fellow, that unless your answer\r\nexclusively related to the _first_ second of time, you did not win the\r\nmarbles fairly; for, since the force of gravity is continually acting,\r\nso is the velocity of a falling body continually increasing, or it has\r\nwhat is termed an ‘_accelerating velocity_;’ it has accordingly been\r\nascertained by accurate experiments, that a body descending from a\r\nconsiderable height falls sixteen feet, as you say, in the _first_\r\nsecond of time; but _three times sixteen_ in the next; _five times\r\nsixteen_ in the third; and _seven times sixteen_ in the fourth; and so\r\non, continually increasing according to the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,\r\n11, &c. so that you perceive,” continued Mr. Seymour, “by observing the\r\nnumber of seconds which a stone requires to descend from any height, we\r\ncan discover the altitude, or depth, of the place in question.”\r\n\r\nLouisa and Fanny, who had been attentively listening to their father’s\r\nexplanation, interchanged a smile of satisfaction, and, pulling Tom\r\ntowards them, whispered something which was inaudible to the rest of\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\n“Come, now,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “I perceive by your looks that you\r\nhave something to ask of me: is Louisa sceptical again?”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear no,” replied Tom; “Louisa merely observed, that we might now\r\nbe able to find out the depth of the village well, about which we have\r\nall been very curious; for the gardener has told us that it is the\r\ndeepest in the kingdom, and was dug more than a hundred years ago.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour did not believe that it was the deepest in the kingdom,\r\nalthough he knew that its depth was considerable; and he said that, if\r\nMr. Twaddleton had no objection, they should walk to it, and make the\r\nproposed experiment.\r\n\r\n“Objection! my dear Mr. Seymour, when do I ever object to afford\r\npleasure to my little playmates, provided its indulgence be harmless?\r\nLet us proceed at once, and on our return I hope you will favour me\r\nwith a visit at the vicarage; I have some antiquities which I am\r\nanxious to exhibit to yourself and Mrs. Seymour.” Tom and Rosa each\r\ntook the vicar’s hand, and Mr. and Mrs. Seymour followed with Louisa\r\nand Fanny. The village well was about half a mile distant; the road to\r\nit led through a delightful shady lane, at the top of which stood the\r\nvicarage-house. Mr. and Mrs. Seymour and her daughters had lingered in\r\ntheir way to collect botanical specimens; and when they had come up to\r\nTom and the vicar, they found them seated on the trunk of a\r\nnewly-felled oak, in deep discourse.\r\n\r\n“What interests you, Tom?” said Mr. Seymour, who perceived, by the\r\nenquiring and animated countenance of the boy, that his attention had\r\nbeen excited by some occurrence.\r\n\r\n“I have been watching the woodman,” said Tom, “and have been surprised\r\nthat the sound of his hatchet was not heard until some time after he\r\nhad struck the tree.”\r\n\r\n“And has not Mr. Twaddleton explained to you the reason of it?” asked\r\nMr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“He has,” replied Tom, “and he tells me that it is owing to sound\r\ntravelling so much more slowly than light.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right; and as we are upon an expedition for the purpose\r\nof measuring depths, it may not be amiss to inform you, that this fact\r\nfurnishes another method of calculating distances.”\r\n\r\nThe party seated themselves upon the oak, and Mr. Seymour\r\nproceeded--“The stroke of the axe is seen at the moment the woodman\r\nmakes it, on account of the immense velocity with which light\r\ntravels;(3) but the noise of the blow will not reach the ear until some\r\ntime has elapsed, the period varying, of course, in proportion to the\r\ndistance, because sound moves only at the rate of 1142 feet in a\r\nsecond, or about 13 miles in a minute; so that you perceive, by\r\nobserving the time that elapses between the fall of the hatchet and the\r\nsound produced by it, we can ascertain the distance of the object.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour fixed his eye attentively on the woodman, and, after a\r\nshort pause, declared that he was about half a quarter of a mile\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\n“Why, how could you discover that?” cried Louisa; “you had not any\r\nwatch in your hand.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Mr. Seymour, “you might have perceived that I placed my\r\nfinger on my wrist, and as my pulse beats about 75 strokes in a minute,\r\nI was able to form a tolerable estimate of the interval, although I\r\nconfess that it is a very rough experiment, but sufficiently accurate\r\nfor the purpose of illustration. In the same manner we can readily\r\nascertain the distance of a thundercloud, or that of a vessel at sea\r\nfiring a cannon. If we do not hear the thunder till half a minute after\r\nwe see the lightning, we are to conclude the cloud to be at the\r\ndistance of six miles and a half. But let us proceed to the well.”\r\n\r\nAfter a walk of a few minutes, the party reached the place of\r\ndestination. On their arrival Mr. Seymour enquired who would count the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“Be that office mine,” said Mr. Twaddleton, as he extracted a large\r\nsilver time-piece from the dark abyss of his watch-pocket; “and let\r\nTom,” continued he, “find a pebble.”\r\n\r\n“Here is one,” cried Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Very well: now, then, how will you proceed?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“I shall drop the stone,” replied Tom, “into the well, and observe how\r\nmany seconds it will be before it touches the water, and I shall then\r\nset down the number of feet it will fall in each second, and add up the\r\nnumbers.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Mr. Seymour, “would certainly accomplish your object; but\r\nI can give you a neater, as well as a shorter rule for performing the\r\nsum: you shall, however, first work it in your own way;--but you have\r\nnot yet informed me how you propose to ascertain the moment at which\r\nthe stone reaches the water.”\r\n\r\n“By the sound, to be sure, papa; and you will find that a very loud one\r\nwill be produced.”\r\n\r\n“If the depth of the well be considerable, such a plan will not answer\r\nthe purpose, since, in that case, there must necessarily be a\r\nperceptible interval between the fall of the stone and the sound\r\nproduced by it, as you have just seen exemplified by the woodman,\r\nwhich, unless taken into account,(4) will vitiate the result.”\r\n\r\nTom observed that he had not thought of that difficulty, and did not\r\nknow how he could get over it. His father told him, that he must look\r\nat the surface of the water, and mark the moment it was disturbed by\r\nthe stone.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Twaddleton,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “are you ready to count\r\nthe seconds?”\r\n\r\n“Quite ready.”\r\n\r\n“Then drop the stone.”\r\n\r\n“One,--two,--three,--four--”\r\n\r\n“There,” said Tom, “it touched the water.”\r\n\r\n“And there, there,” cried several voices, “what a noise it made!”\r\n\r\n“_Facilis descensus Averni_,” exclaimed the vicar; “the stone descended\r\nin four seconds.”\r\n\r\n“Now, my boy, make your calculation.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour furnished pencil and paper, and Tom proceeded;--“_Sixteen_\r\nfeet for the first second,--I put that down.”--\r\n\r\n“Well,” said his father, “and _three_ times _sixteen_ for the second?”\r\n\r\n“_Forty-eight_,” cried Tom.--\r\n\r\n“Put it down.”\r\n\r\n“_Five times sixteen_, for the third?”\r\n\r\n“_Eighty._”--\r\n\r\n“Down with it.”\r\n\r\n“And _seven times sixteen_, for the fourth?”\r\n\r\n“_One hundred and twelve._”\r\n\r\n“Now, cast up these numbers,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“_Two hundred and fifty-six feet_,” cried Tom, “is the depth of the\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\nA shout of delight, from the whole juvenile party, announced the\r\nsatisfaction which they felt at the success of their first experiment\r\nin NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\nLouisa observed, that she could not distinguish any interval between\r\nthe actual contact of the stone with the water and the sound which it\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n“At so small a distance as two hundred and fifty-six feet,” said her\r\nfather, “the interval could not have exceeded in duration the fourth\r\npart of a second, and was, consequently, imperceptible: we might\r\ntherefore, in the present instance, have accepted the sound as a signal\r\nof the stone’s arrival at the water, without prejudice to the result of\r\nthe experiment.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour told his son, that the method which he had pursued was\r\nunobjectionable when the experiment did not extend beyond a few\r\nseconds: but that, if a case occurred in which a greater space of time\r\nwere consumed, he would find his plan tedious: “Now,” continued he, “I\r\nwill give you a general rule that will enable you to obtain the answer\r\nin a shorter time without the details of addition. ‘_The spaces\r\ndescribed by a falling body increase as the squares of the times\r\nincrease._’ I conclude that you already know that the _square_ of a\r\nnumber is the sum obtained by multiplying the number into itself.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered Tom; “the square of 4 is 16; that of 3, 9, and so\r\non.”\r\n\r\n“This, then, being the case, you have only to square the number of\r\nseconds, and then multiply that product by 16, being the space\r\ndescribed by the falling body in the first second, and you will have\r\nthe required answer: apply this rule to the present case; the stone\r\nfell to the bottom in four seconds; square this number, 4×4=16;\r\nmultiply this by 16, and we obtain 256.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Tom, “is certainly much more simple than my method.”\r\n\r\n“And it has the advantage,” continued Mr. Seymour, “of being more\r\nportable for the memory.”\r\n\r\n“Should any of the villagers observe us,” said Mrs. Seymour, “they will\r\ntake us for a party of fortune-tellers.”\r\n\r\n“Of fortune-tellers!” repeated Louisa, with surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear,” replied Mrs. Seymour, “there is a foolish superstition\r\nattached to this, and I believe to many other wells in the\r\nneighbourhood of remote villages, that by dropping pebbles into it, and\r\nobserving whether they produce a loud, or only a slight sound, and\r\nnoticing the number of times they rebound from the sides before they\r\nreach the bottom, and other absurd distinctions, a person can predict\r\nwhether good or evil awaits them.” (5)\r\n\r\nMrs. Seymour now proposed the party’s return to the Lodge; but Mr.\r\nTwaddleton expressed a hope that they would first favour him with a\r\nvisit at the vicarage; to which proposition they readily assented.\r\n\r\nHis antiquated residence, mantled in ivy, and shaded by cypress, stood\r\non the confines of the church-yard, from which his grounds were merely\r\nseparated by a dwarf hedge of sweet-brier and roses; so that the vicar\r\nmight be said to reside amidst the graves of his departed parishioners,\r\nand the turf-clad heap evinced the influence of his fostering care by a\r\ngrateful return of primroses and violets.\r\n\r\nAround the house the reverend antiquary had arranged several precious\r\nrelics, which were too cumbrous for admission within its walls; amongst\r\nthese was an ancient cross, raised upon a platform on four steps, which\r\nfrom the worn appearance of the stones had evidently been impressed\r\nwith the foot of many a wandering pilgrim. These mouldering monuments\r\nof ancient days cast a shade of solemnity around the dwelling, and\r\nannounced its inmate as a person of no ordinary stamp.\r\n\r\nAnnette, the vicar’s trusty servant, had watched the approach of the\r\nsquire and his family, and, anticipating the honour of a passing visit,\r\nwas busily engaged in removing the chequed covers from the cumbrous\r\noaken chairs, and the various other bibs and tuckers with which his\r\ncuriosities were invested, when the party entered the study. Lucky was\r\nit for the vicar’s repose, that the notice had been so short, or the\r\ntidy housewife would, without doubt, have scoured some of the antique\r\ncommodities, and destroyed a crop of sacred verdure, which ages could\r\nnot have replenished. As matters stood, nothing was left for poor\r\nAnnette, but to defend her character at the expense of her master, who\r\nshe declared treated her as though she was an old witch, whenever she\r\nwas seen with a _broom_.\r\n\r\n“Why, papa,” exclaimed Tom, as he cast his eyes around the study, “all\r\nthese curiosities have been put up since I went to school.”\r\n\r\n“The boy is right,” said the vicar; “I have only just completed their\r\narrangement, and I believe,” continued he, addressing himself to Mr.\r\nSeymour, “that there are several rich morsels of antiquity which you\r\nhave not yet seen: but I must, in the first place, introduce my young\r\nfriends to the wonders of my magic gallery; wherein they may converse\r\nwith the spirits of departed emperors, heroes, patriots, sages, and\r\nbeauties;--contemplate, at their leisure, the countenances of the\r\nAlexanders, Cæsars, Pompeys, and Trajans;--behold a legion of\r\nallegorical and airy beings, who have here, for the first time, assumed\r\nappropriate and substantial forms:--examine the models of ancient\r\ntemples and triumphal arches, which, although coeval with the edifices\r\nthey represent, are as perfect as at the first moment of their\r\nconstruction, while the originals have long since crumbled into dust.\r\nThey shall also see volumes of history, condensed into a space of a few\r\ninches, and read the substance of a hundred pages at a single glance.”\r\n\r\n“How extraordinary!” said Tom: “why we never read anything more\r\nwonderful in our Fairy Tales.”\r\n\r\n“And what renders it more wonderful,” replied the vicar, “is its being\r\nall true.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the antiquary took a key of pigmy dimensions from the pocket\r\nof his waistcoat, and proceeded to a cumbrous ebony cabinet which stood\r\nin a deep recess, and displayed an antique structure, and curiously\r\ncarved allegorical devices, in strict unison with that air of mystery\r\nwith which the vicar had thought proper to invest its contents. It was\r\nsupported by gigantic eagles’ claws; its key-hole was surrounded by\r\nhissing snakes; while the head of Cerberus, which constituted the\r\nhandle, appeared as if placed to guard the entrance. The children were\r\nupon the tiptoe of expectation and impatience--the vicar applied the\r\nkey with the wonder-stirring exclamation of “OPEN SESAMA!”--the lock\r\nyielded, and the doors flew open. Disappointment and chagrin were\r\nvisibly depicted on the countenances of the brother and sisters.\r\n\r\n“And so,” exclaimed Tom, “this fine magic gallery turns out to be\r\nnothing more than a box full of rusty halfpence!”\r\n\r\n“I am sure,” said Louisa, “it was quite unnecessary to have engaged\r\nCerberus as a sentinel over such rubbish.”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” cried the vicar; “you talk like one not initiated in the\r\nmysteries of enchantment: have you not read, that under its spells the\r\nmeanest objects have assumed forms of splendour and magnificence?” [8]\r\n\r\n“Like the fabled touch of the Phrygian monarch,” said Mrs. Seymour,\r\n“which we are told transmuted the meanest materials into gold.”\r\n\r\n“In like manner, then, may treasures of the greatest value appear to\r\nordinary eyes as mean and worthless.”\r\n\r\n“This cabinet,” continued Mr. Twaddleton, “is under the influence of a\r\npotent magician; by the touch of her wand, it would become irradiated\r\nas with celestial light, and these rusty coins would be transformed\r\ninto all those various objects of interest and delight which I had\r\npromised to show you.”\r\n\r\nTom and Louisa looked at the coins, then at the vicar, and afterwards\r\nat Mr. Seymour, to whom they cast an enquiring glance.\r\n\r\n“Then pray,” exclaimed Tom, “wave this mighty wand of your enchantress,\r\nand fulfil your promise.”\r\n\r\n“The enchantress,” replied the vicar, “is not disposed to grant her\r\nfavours to those by whom she has not been propitiated.”\r\n\r\n“And what ceremony does she require?” enquired Louisa.\r\n\r\n“The perusal of sundry mystic volumes; and the consumption of a\r\nmidnight lamp at her altar,” replied the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Do you not comprehend the allegory?” said Mr. Seymour. “The enchanted\r\ngallery is no other than a collection of antique medals;--the potent\r\nenchantress, ERUDITION, or that classical learning, without which they\r\nappear of less value than so many rusty halfpence.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” cried Mr. Twaddleton: “the poetical import of a device\r\ncan be alone felt and appreciated by those who are acquainted with the\r\nclassical subjects to which it alludes; for, as Addison forcibly\r\nobserves, there is often as much thought on the reverse of a medal as\r\nin a canto of Spenser; besides, how frequently do you meet with hints\r\nand suggestions in an ancient poet, that give a complete illustration\r\nto the actions, ornaments, and antiquities which are found on\r\ncoins!--In short, the person who examines a collection of medals,\r\nwithout a competent knowledge of the classics, is like him who would\r\nexplore a subterranean cavern without the aid of a torch.”\r\n\r\n“I have already learned one fact,” said Louisa, “with which I was\r\ncertainly unacquainted; that the ancients possessed a much greater\r\nvariety of money than modern nations.” (6)\r\n\r\n“Of that, my dear,” replied the vicar, “there is some doubt;--the\r\nlearned are divided upon the question: some authors maintain that every\r\nmedal, and even medallion, had its fixed and regular price in payments,\r\nwhile others, on the contrary, assert that we are not in the possession\r\nof any real money of the ancients, and that the medals never had any\r\ncurrency as coins. The truth probably is between these two extremes.”\r\n\r\n“If these medals were not used as money,” observed Louisa, “for what\r\npurposes could they have been coined?”\r\n\r\n“To perpetuate the memory of great actions; and, faithful to its charge\r\nof fame, the medal has transmitted events, the history of which must,\r\notherwise, have long since perished. Nay, more,” exclaimed the vicar,\r\nhis voice rising as he became warmed by his subject, “the lamp of\r\nhistory has been often extinguished, and the medalist has collected\r\nsparks from the ashes of antiquity which have rekindled its flame. You\r\nperceive, therefore,” continued the reverend antiquary, “that such\r\ncollections are of the highest importance, and if your papa will allow\r\nyou to pass a morning in their examination, I shall easily bring you to\r\nadmit, that I have not exaggerated the wonders of my magic gallery. I\r\nwill convince you, that it contains a series of original miniature\r\nportraits of the greatest heroes of antiquity; a compendious chart of\r\nhistory, chronology, and heathen mythology; a system of classic\r\narchitecture; and an accurate commentary upon the more celebrated poems\r\nof Greece and Rome. Ay, and I will show you a faithful resemblance of\r\nthe very ship that carried Æneas to Italy, and of the lofty poop from\r\nwhich the luckless Palinurus fell into the ocean.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton then favoured Mr. and Mrs. Seymour with a sight of some\r\nof those rarer medals, which he considered as constituting the gems of\r\nhis collection.\r\n\r\n“You do not mean to say,” exclaimed Tom, as he seized a small coin,\r\n“that this _brass_ piece is of more value than the large coin of gold\r\nthat lies next to it?”\r\n\r\n“Mercy upon us!” cried the vicar, in a tone of agony, “how the boy\r\nhandles it!--restore it to its place--gently--gently--that ‘little\r\nbrass piece,’ as you call it, is gold, and although it might not have\r\nbeen worth one guinea fifteen hundred years ago, is now valued at a\r\nhundred. It is a coin of Ptolemy the 8th of Egypt. On the obverse is\r\nthe portrait of the king beautifully raised; on the reverse a\r\ncornucopia. I do not believe that the coin was known to Pinkerton when\r\nhe wrote his Essay.”\r\n\r\n“There is, certainly,” said Mr. Seymour, “something very inexplicable\r\nin the tastes and enthusiastic feelings of you patrons of antiquity.”\r\n\r\n“The antiquary,” observed the vicar, “does not regard a cabinet of\r\nmedals as a treasure of money, but of knowledge; nor does he fancy any\r\ncharms in gold, but in the figures that adorn it; it is not the metal,\r\nbut the erudition, that stamps it with value.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton now passed on to a different compartment of his cabinet,\r\nobserving, that he must exhibit a few of his Roman treasures. “Behold,”\r\nsaid he, “two gems of unappreciable value; never do I look upon them\r\nbut with feelings of the purest delight. Let my young friends come\r\nnearer, and inspect them minutely. This is a large brass coin of\r\nTiberius, and was current when Christ was upon the earth; next to it\r\nlies a silver _Denarius_ of the same Emperor; its value was about equal\r\nto seven-pence of our money, and was the coin that tempted Judas to\r\nbetray his master.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Mrs. Seymour, “I have heard you speak of some English\r\ncoins of rarity and interest.”\r\n\r\n“True, Madam, very true, but they are in another cabinet: before I\r\nclose the present one, I will, with your permission, give you a glimpse\r\nat my Sulphurs Paduans, and Beckers.”\r\n\r\n“Paduans and Beckers!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “and pray what may they\r\nbe? I never before heard the terms.”\r\n\r\n“‘My poverty but not my will consents,’ The antiquary who is poor in\r\npurse,” observed the vicar, “must needs be contented with being rich in\r\ncounterfeits, or, I ought rather to have said, in possessing copies\r\ninstead of originals. Becker was an artist of Frankfort, who excelled\r\nin imitating ancient coins, but he never used his skill for the purpose\r\nof deception, but honestly sold his productions as avowed copies, which\r\nare admitted into the cabinets of the curious under the name of\r\n_Beckers_. The _Paduans_,” the vicar added, “derived their name from\r\ntwo brothers at Padua, celebrated for the accuracy with which they\r\nimitated large Roman coins. Here are the English coins you alluded to,”\r\nsaid the antiquary to Mrs. Seymour. “This is a shilling of Henry VII.\r\ncurious as being the first shilling ever struck; it was presented to me\r\nby a college friend some years ago, and I have been lately informed\r\nthat it is so rare as to fetch twenty-five pounds; but let me beg you\r\nto examine attentively this curious little treasure,” said the vicar,\r\nhis eyes twinkling with pleasure as he placed the dainty morsel in the\r\nhand of Mrs. Seymour; “it is,” continued he, “a silver groat of Perkin\r\nWarbeck; on one side are the Royal arms, but without a name; they are\r\nsurmounted, you perceive, with an arched crown, and placed between a\r\nfleur de lis and a rose.”\r\n\r\n“What is the inscription?” asked Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Say _legend_, Madam, if you please; the words are, ‘_Domine, salvum\r\nfac regem_,’ the date 1494. The coin is supposed to have been struck by\r\nthe order of the Duchess of Burgundy for Perkin Warbeck, when he set\r\nout to invade England.”\r\n\r\n“Pray,” said Tom, “have you got a Queen Anne’s farthing?”\r\n\r\n“It is really curious,” observed the vicar, “that well-informed persons\r\nshould still continue to be deceived with regard to the value of this\r\ncoin. The absurd notion of its being worth 100_l._ arose from an\r\nadvertisement of an old lady, who had lost one, stating it to be one of\r\nthe only three known in the world, and worth at least 100_l._ The truth\r\nis, I understand from my much valued friend of Tavistock-Street, that\r\nthese farthings generally fetch from five to twenty shillings each;\r\nthere are several different types of them, but the only one intended\r\nfor currency is that bearing the date of 1714; all the others were\r\nstruck as patterns. This is certainly scarce, in consequence of the\r\ndeath of the Queen taking place before the coinage was finished. The\r\nfarthing and sixpence of Oliver Cromwell are much more scarce and\r\nvaluable, the one generally brings 10_l._ the other as much as 25_l._\r\nIt appears that, after Oliver had stamped his head upon them, he was\r\nafraid to issue them as current coins, which accounts for the few which\r\nhave been handed down to us.”\r\n\r\n“You remind me,” said Mr. Seymour, “of a story I lately heard of a\r\ncrown-piece of Oliver selling at a public auction for as much as two\r\nhundred guineas--can it be possible?”\r\n\r\n“You labour under a mistake,” answered the vicar; “the coin you allude\r\nto is known amongst collectors by the name of the Petition crown of\r\nCharles the Second, and it is undoubtedly a most inimitable piece of\r\nworkmanship. The story is this: Simon, the artist, had been employed by\r\nOliver Cromwell, and at the Restoration, in order to obtain the\r\npatronage of Charles, executed the crown-piece in question. It\r\nresembles in its general appearance the common milled five-shilling\r\npiece, but on the edging there are two lines of letters beautifully\r\nexecuted. The words are ‘_Thomas Simon most humbly prays your Majesty\r\nto compare this his tryal piece with the Dutch, and if more truly drawn\r\nand embossed, more gracefully ordered, and more accurately engraven, to\r\nrelieve him_.’”\r\n\r\n“And what said Charles to it?” enquired Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Charles,” said the vicar, “took no notice of him, on account of his\r\nhaving worked for Cromwell, and the poor artist shortly afterwards died\r\nof a broken heart.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “his manes must be surely appeased, if\r\nhis crowns now sell for two hundred guineas each.”\r\n\r\nThe party, soon after this exhibition, quitted the vicarage, highly\r\ngratified, and returned to the Lodge, where, after the usual ceremonies\r\nat the toilet, they sat down to dinner; in the enjoyment of which we\r\nwill now leave them, and put an end to the present chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stone cross.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Gravity, or the tendency of a body to approach the earth, is\r\n  proportioned to the _square of the distance_; that is, if a body be\r\n  attracted by the earth at a certain distance, with a certain force,\r\n  and be afterwards removed to _twice_ the distance, it will now be\r\n  attracted, not _half_ us much, but only _one-fourth_ as much as it\r\n  was before; and if it be removed to _three_ times the first distance,\r\n  it will be attracted not _one-third_ as much, but _one-ninth_, as\r\n  much as before; four being the square of two, and nine the square of\r\n  three.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  In the legends of Scottish superstition, the magic power of imposing\r\n  upon the eye-sight was termed _Glamour_.\r\n\r\n            “It had much of glamour might:\r\n            Could make a ladye seem a knight;\r\n            The cobwebs on a dungeon wall,\r\n            Seem tapestry in lordly hall;\r\n            A nutshell seem a gilded barge,\r\n            A sheeling seem a palace large,\r\n            And youth seem age, and age seem youth:--\r\n            All was delusion, nought was truth.”\r\n                    _Lay of the Last Minstrel._--Canto 3. ix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n _Motion--absolute and relative.--Uniform, accelerated, and retarded\r\n    Velocity.--The times of Ascent and Descent are equal.--Vis\r\n    inertiæ.--Friction.--Action and Reaction are equal and in\r\n    opposite directions.--Momentum defined and explained.--The Three\r\n    Great Laws of Motion._\r\n\r\n\r\n“The table-cloth is removed,” cried Tom, as he cast a sly glance\r\nthrough the open window of the dining-room.\r\n\r\n“It is, my boy,” replied Mr. Twaddleton; “_Diffugere nives_, as the\r\npoet has it.”\r\n\r\n“_Et redeunt jam gramina campis_,” added Mr. Seymour, archly, as he\r\npointed to the green cloth with which the table was covered.\r\n\r\n“_Et decrescentia flumina_,” continued the vicar, with a smile; “but,\r\npsha! enough of wine and quotation. Come, let us join the children.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, and Louisa, rose\r\nfrom the table, and proceeded to the lawn.\r\n\r\n“The gravitation of Tom’s ball,” said Mr. Seymour, “furnished an ample\r\nsubject for our morning’s diversion; let us try whether its other\r\nmotions will not suggest further objects of enquiry.”\r\n\r\n“I well remember,” observed Louisa, “that Mrs. Marcet extols that\r\napple, the fall of which attracted the notice of Sir Isaac Newton,\r\nabove all the apples that have ever been sung by the poets: and she\r\ndeclares, that the apple presented to Venus by Paris; the golden apples\r\nby which Atalanta won the race; nay, even the apple which William Tell\r\nshot from the head of his own son, cannot be brought into comparison\r\nwith it.”\r\n\r\n“Well said! Mrs. Marcet,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour; “upon my word, had the\r\nmother of mankind used but half such eloquence in praise of an apple,\r\nwe cannot wonder at its influence.”\r\n\r\n“What honours, then,” continued Louisa, “shall we decree to Tom’s ball,\r\nif it instructs us in the first principles of philosophy?”\r\n\r\n“We are trifling,” observed Mr. Seymour, and so saying, he took the\r\nball from Tom’s hand, and rolling it along the ground, exclaimed,\r\n“there it goes, performing, as you may perceive, two different kinds of\r\nmotion at the same time; it turns round, or revolves on its _axis_; and\r\ngoes straight forward, or, to speak more philosophically, performs a\r\n_rectilinear_ motion.”\r\n\r\nTom said that he did not exactly comprehend what was meant by the\r\n_axis_.(7) His father, therefore, informed him that the axis of a\r\nrevolving body was an imaginary line, which was itself at rest, but\r\nabout which all its other parts turned, or rotated: “But,” continued\r\nhe, “can you tell me whether you understand what is meant by the word\r\n_motion_?”\r\n\r\n“If he can,” exclaimed the vicar, “he is a cleverer fellow than the\r\nwisest philosopher of antiquity, who, upon being asked the very same\r\nquestion, is said to have walked across the room, and to have replied,\r\n‘You see it, but what it is I cannot tell you.’”\r\n\r\n“Your ancient acquaintances,” observed Mr. Seymour, “entertained some\r\nvery strange notions touching this said subject of motion. If I\r\nremember right, Diodorus denied its very existence; but we are told\r\nthat he did not himself remain _unmoved_, when he dislocated his\r\nshoulder, and the surgeon kept him in torture while he endeavoured to\r\nconvince him, by his own mode of reasoning, that the bone could not\r\nhave moved out of its place: we have, however, at present, nothing to\r\ndo with the ancients; the philosophers of our own times agree in\r\ndefining motion to be _‘the act of a body changing its situation with\r\nregard to any other;’_ and you will therefore readily perceive, that\r\nthis may actually happen to a body while it remains absolutely at rest.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that beats all the paradoxes I ever heard,” cried Tom; “a body\r\nthen may be in motion, while it is at rest?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Mr. Seymour; “it may be _relatively_ in motion,\r\nwhile it is _absolutely_ at rest.”\r\n\r\n“How can a body change its place,” said Louisa, “except by moving?”\r\n\r\n“Very readily,” answered her father; “it may have its relative\r\nsituation changed with respect to surrounding objects; there is your\r\nball, and here is a stone, has not each of them a particular situation\r\nwith respect to the other; and by moving one, do I not change the\r\n_relative_ situation of both?”\r\n\r\n“I perceive your meaning,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“To prevent confusion, therefore, in our ideas, it became necessary to\r\ndistinguish these two kinds of motion from each other by appropriate\r\nterms; and, accordingly, where there has been an actual change of\r\nplace, in the common meaning of the term, the motion which produced it\r\nis termed ABSOLUTE motion; whereas, on the contrary, when the situation\r\nhas been only relatively changed, by an alteration in the position of\r\nsurrounding bodies, the motion is said to be RELATIVE.”\r\n\r\n“Surely, papa,” said Louisa, “no person can ever mistake _relative_ for\r\n_absolute_ motion; what then is the use of such frivolous distinctions?\r\nWhen a body really moves, we can observe it in the act of changing its\r\nplace, and no difficulty can arise about the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, my dear, is more fallacious than our vision; the earth\r\nappears motionless, and the sun and stars _seem_ as if they revolved\r\nround it; but it is scarcely necessary for me to inform you that our\r\nglobe is constantly moving with considerable velocity, while the sun\r\nremains at rest.--Mr. Sadler, the famous aëronaut,” continued Mr.\r\nSeymour, “informed me, that he was never sensible of the motion of the\r\nballoon in any of his excursions, but that, as he ascended into the\r\nair, the earth always appeared as if sinking beneath him, and as he\r\ndescended, as if rising to meet him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton here observed, that he had heard a very curious\r\nanecdote, when he was last in London, which fully confirmed the truth\r\nof Mr. Sadler’s statement. “An aëronaut,” said he, “whose name I cannot\r\nat this moment recollect, had recently published a map of his voyage,\r\nand, instead of proceeding in any one line of direction, his track\r\nabsolutely appeared in the form of circles, connected with each other\r\nlike the links of a chain: this occasioned considerable astonishment,\r\nand, of course, some speculation, until it was at length discovered,\r\nthat his apparent journey was to be attributed to the rotatory motion\r\nof the balloon, which the voyager, not feeling, had never suspected.”\r\n\r\n“And what,” asked Tom, “could have been the reason of his not having\r\nfelt the motion?”\r\n\r\nHis father explained to him, that we are only conscious of being in\r\nmotion when the conveyance, in which we are placed, suffers some\r\nimpediment in its progress. “If,” said he, “you were to close your\r\neyes, when sailing on calm water, with a steady breeze, you would not\r\nperceive that you were moving: for you could not _feel_ the motion, and\r\nyou could only _see_ it by observing the change of place in the\r\ndifferent objects on the shore; and then it would be almost impossible,\r\nwithout the aid of reason and experience, to believe that the shore\r\nitself was not in motion, and that you were at rest; I shall, however,\r\nbe able to explain this subject more clearly by an optical toy which I\r\nhave in preparation.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Seymour here repeated the following passage from that interesting\r\nnovel “Anastasius,” which she observed was beautifully descriptive of\r\nthe illusive appearance to which their papa had just referred:--\r\n\r\n“The gradually increasing breeze carried us rapidly out of the\r\nStraits of Chio. The different objects on the\r\nshore,--mountains,--valleys,--villages,--and steeples,--seemed in\r\nswift succession, first advancing to meet us, then halting an instant\r\nalongside our vessel, as if to greet us on our passage, and, lastly,\r\nagain gliding off with equal speed; till, launched into the open\r\nmain, we saw the whole line of coast gradually dissolve in distant\r\ndarkness.”\r\n\r\n“That is indeed a beautiful and very apposite illustration,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour; “and I think Louisa will now admit, that it is not quite so\r\neasy, as she at first imagined, to distinguish between _Absolute_ and\r\n_Relative_ motion.”\r\n\r\nAs the children now understood what was meant by the term _Motion_,\r\ntheir father asked them whether they could tell him what produced it.\r\n\r\n“I can make a body move by various means,” answered Tom.\r\n\r\n“But they may all be reduced to one,” said Mr. Seymour; “viz. some\r\nexertion which is called _Force_; thus the _force_ of my hand put your\r\nball in motion; while gravitation was the _force_ which made it fall to\r\nthe earth; and I must, moreover, inform you, that a body always moves\r\nin the direction of the force which impels it, and with a velocity, or\r\nrate of motion, which is proportional to its degree, or strength; and,\r\nwere there no other forces in action but that which originally produced\r\nthe motion, the body would proceed onwards in a right line, and with a\r\n_uniform_ velocity for ever.”\r\n\r\n“For ever!” exclaimed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Ay, my dear, _for ever_: but we will discuss that question presently;\r\nyou must first tell me whether you understand what is meant by\r\n_uniform_ velocity.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that _uniform_ velocity is that which is regular, and of an\r\nequal rate throughout.”\r\n\r\n“Philosophers,” replied her father, “call the motion of a body\r\n_uniform_, when it passes over equal spaces in equal times.--Now, Tom,\r\nit is your turn to answer a question. Can you describe the meaning of\r\nthe terms _Accelerated_ and _Retarded_ motion?”\r\n\r\n“I conclude that motion is said to be _accelerated_ when it moves every\r\nmoment quicker and quicker; and to be _retarded_ when it moves slower\r\nand slower.”\r\n\r\n“You are perfectly right; and gravity may either act in occasioning the\r\none or the other; our experiment at the well this morning afforded you\r\nan example of gravity producing a regularly accelerated motion. I did\r\nnot fully explain the fact at the time, because I was desirous of\r\navoiding too many new ideas at once; we must win our way slowly and\r\ncautiously through the mazes of philosophy: I will, however, now\r\nendeavour to give you as clear an explanation as the subject will\r\nallow.--It is, I think, evident, that if, at the moment you dropped the\r\nstone from your hand, the force of gravity could have been suspended,\r\nit would have descended to the bottom of the well with a uniform\r\nvelocity; because there could have been nothing either to accelerate or\r\nretard its motion. But this was not the case, for the power of gravity\r\nwas in constant operation; and, if you keep this fact in mind, you will\r\nreadily understand how the velocity became accelerated: for, suppose\r\nthe impulse given by gravity to the stone, during the first instant of\r\nits descent, be equal to _one_, the next instant we shall find that an\r\nadditional impulse gives the stone an additional velocity equal to\r\n_one_, so that the accumulated velocity is now equal to two; the\r\nfollowing instant, again, increases the velocity to _three_, and so on\r\ntill the stone reaches the bottom.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton observed, the fact might be shortly expressed by saying,\r\nthat “the effects of preceding impulses must be added to subsequent\r\nvelocities.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then remarked that the same explanation would apply to\r\n_retarded_ velocity. “If,” said he, “you throw a stone perpendicularly\r\nupwards, the velocity will be as much _retarded_, as it was in the\r\nother case _accelerated_, by gravity; the consequence of which is, that\r\nit will be exactly the same length of time ascending that it was\r\ndescending.”\r\n\r\n“I should have thought the very reverse,” cried Louisa, “and that it\r\nwould have fallen quicker than it rose.”\r\n\r\n“You have forgotten to take into account the force with which the stone\r\nis projected upwards, and which is destroyed by gravity before it\r\nbegins to descend.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered Louisa; “but the force given to a stone in\r\nthrowing it upwards, cannot always be equal to the force of gravity in\r\nbringing it down again; for the force of gravity is always the same,\r\nwhile the force given to the stone is entirely optional. I may throw it\r\nup gently or otherwise, as I please.”\r\n\r\n“If you throw it gently,” said her father, “it will not rise high, and\r\ngravity will soon bring it down again; if you throw it with violence,\r\nit will rise much higher, and gravity will be longer in bringing it\r\nback again to the ground. Suppose, for instance, that you throw it with\r\na force that will make it rise only sixteen feet; in that case, you\r\nknow, it will fall in one second of time. Now it is proved by\r\nexperiment, that an impulse requisite to project a body sixteen feet\r\nupwards, will make it ascend that height in one second of time; here,\r\nthen, the times of ascent and descent are equal. But, supposing it be\r\nrequired to throw a stone twice that height, the force must be\r\nproportionally greater. You see, then, that the impulse of projection,\r\nin throwing a body upwards, is always equal to the action of the force\r\nof gravity during its descent; and that it is the greater or less\r\ndistance to which the body rises that makes these two forces balance\r\neach other.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, dear papa, for the pains you have taken in explaining this\r\nsubject to us.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” replied Mr. Seymour, “bestow your thanks upon those to whom they\r\nare more justly due; Mrs. Marcet is entitled to the merit of this\r\nexplanation; for I obtained it from her ‘Conversations.’ Before I quit\r\nthis subject, I would just observe that, when we come to the\r\nconsideration of the bow and arrow, you will, by the application of the\r\nlaw I have endeavoured to expound, be enabled to ascertain the height\r\nto which your arrow may ascend, with the same facility as you\r\ndiscovered the depth of the well: for, since the times of ascent and\r\ndescent are equal, you have only to determine the number of seconds\r\nwhich intervene between the instant at which the arrow quits the bow to\r\nthat at which it falls to the ground, and halving them, to make the\r\nusual calculation.--But let us proceed to another subject. Roll the\r\nball hither, Tom; roll the ball hither, I say! you stand as if you\r\nthought it would advance to us of its own accord.”\r\n\r\n“I know a little better than that, too,” cried Tom; “no body can move\r\nwithout the application of some force.”\r\n\r\n“Nor stop, either,” added Mr. Seymour, “when it is once in motion; for\r\nmatter is equally indifferent to both rest and motion.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, papa,” cried Louisa, “unfortunately for your assertion, the\r\nball stopped just now, and I am sure that no force was used to make it\r\ndo so.”\r\n\r\n“And pray, Miss Pert, why are you so sure that no force was opposed to\r\nits progress? I begin to fear that my lesson has been thrown away upon\r\nyou, or you would not, surely, have concluded so falsely.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar here interposed, observing that, simple as the question might\r\nappear to those who had studied it, the fact was so contrary to\r\neverything that passed before us, that Mr. Seymour ought not to feel\r\nany surprise at the scepticism of his daughter; he begged to remind him\r\nthat the truth, apparent as it doubtless now was, lay hid for ages\r\nbefore the sagacity of Galileo brought it to light.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour admitted the justice of this remark, and proceeded in his\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said he “you will readily allow that matter cannot, in\r\nitself, possess any power of changing its condition: it can, therefore,\r\nno more destroy, than it can originate its own motion; when it is at\r\nrest, it must ever remain so, unless some force be applied that can\r\nimpart to it activity; and, when once in motion, it must continue to\r\nmove until some counteracting force stops it. To believe otherwise you\r\nmust suppose that matter possesses in itself a power to alter its\r\ncondition, which is perfectly absurd.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said Tom, “when I see my ball or marble stop of its own\r\naccord, how can you blame me for believing it possible?”\r\n\r\n“Your difficulty arises from your ignorance of the existence of certain\r\nforces which act upon the rolling ball or marble. Its progress, as it\r\nrolls along, is impeded and ultimately stopped by the rubbing, or\r\nfriction, occasioned by its passage over the ground; and this will be\r\ngreater or less, according to the degree of roughness of the surface;\r\nif it be small, the ball will continue for a longer time in motion; you\r\nmust have observed, that your marble has always rolled much farther on\r\na smooth pavement than on a rough gravel walk.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Tom, “and I well remember, that when we played at\r\n_ring-taw_ last winter on the ice, we were obliged, for this very\r\nreason, to extend the usual boundaries.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not evident, then, that the motion of a body is stopped by some\r\nopposing force; and that, if this could be entirely removed, the body\r\nwould continue to move for ever?”\r\n\r\n“What a provoking thing this friction is,” said Tom, “it is always\r\ninterfering with our experiments.”\r\n\r\n“Provoking, is it? I fancy,” said Mr. Seymour, “that you would be much\r\nmore provoked by the loss of it: without it, you could not walk, nor\r\neven hold an object in your hands; and yet everything around you would\r\nbe in perpetual motion, performing one universal and interminable\r\ndance.”\r\n\r\n“I can readily understand, from what you have said, that, if friction\r\nwere removed, motion might continue; but pray how is it that we should\r\nbe unable to walk, or to hold anything in our hands?” enquired Louisa.\r\n\r\n“It is the friction of the ground which, at every step we take,\r\nprevents the foot from sliding back, and thus enables us to push the\r\nbody forwards. Everybody must have felt how difficult it is to walk on\r\nice, where the friction is only diminished, not entirely removed,”\r\nanswered her father; “and as to holding any object,” continued he, “it\r\nis the friction of the body to which we apply our hands that enables us\r\nto hold it firmly.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” exclaimed the vicar; “why, my boy, you must surely\r\nremember, that in ancient combats it was the custom to rub the body\r\nwith oil, that the adversary might not be able to keep his grasp.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Tom, “our houses, I suppose, would remain firm, and we\r\nmight sit quietly in our chairs, at all events.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” replied Mr. Seymour, “for even granting that you had houses\r\nand chairs, which, without the existence of friction would never exist,\r\nthe stability of the structures could never be secured; the slightest\r\nbreath would be sufficient to make the stones or bricks slide off from\r\neach other, and to reduce your dwellings into dancing ruins.”\r\n\r\nTom and Louisa, after some farther discussion, both admitted the\r\njustness of the argument; but, at the same time, would have been better\r\nsatisfied if the fact could have been proved by actual experiment. Mr.\r\nSeymour told them that the perpetual revolution of the earth and\r\nheavenly bodies, where no friction whatever existed, afforded a proof\r\nwhich ought to satisfy them; and, especially, since it agreed with\r\nthose views which were proved to be true by an examination of what took\r\nplace on the surface of our own globe.\r\n\r\nWe will, therefore, with the permission of our readers, consider this\r\npoint as settled, and proceed with the young philosophers to the\r\ninvestigation of some other topics connected with the doctrine of\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n“Since a body at rest,” said Mr. Seymour, “can only be set in motion,\r\nor, when in motion, be brought to rest, by the impression of some\r\nforce, it must follow, that it can only move in the direction in which\r\nsuch a force may act; and, moreover, that the degree of motion, or the\r\n_velocity_, must, other things being equal, be in proportion to the\r\ndegree of force used.”\r\n\r\n“Why, truly,” cried the vicar, “my young friends must of necessity\r\nadmit that fact; for the body, not having any will of its own, as you\r\nsay, must needs, if it move at all, go the road it is driven.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added Mr. Seymour, “and it must go with a velocity in proportion\r\nto the force with which it is driven.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, doubtless,” cried the vicar, “you admit that also; do you\r\nnot, my young friends and playmates?”\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to state, that the children instantly assented\r\nto these propositions. The vicar had placed them in so clear and\r\npopular a point of view, as to be intelligible to the lowest capacities.\r\n\r\n“With these admissions, then, my dear children,” said their father, “I\r\nshall have but little difficulty in convincing you of the truth of the\r\nother laws by which the direction of moving bodies is governed. At\r\npresent, however, it is not my intention to enter upon this subject;\r\nyou have some preliminary knowledge to acquire before you can\r\nunderstand what is termed the _Composition and Resolution of Forces_.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not easily forget,” said Louisa, “that matter is perfectly\r\npassive, and that it can neither put itself in motion when at rest, nor\r\nstop itself when in motion.”\r\n\r\n“This indifference to rest or motion,” replied Mr. Seymour, “has been\r\ntermed the _Vis Inertiæ_ of matter.”\r\n\r\n“A very objectionable term,--a very puzzling expression,” exclaimed the\r\nvicar;--“to denote a mere state of passive indifference by the term\r\n_Vis_, or power, does appear to me, who have been in the habit of\r\nconnecting words with ideas, as excessively absurd.”\r\n\r\n“I allow,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the simple word _Inertia_ would have\r\nbeen more correct; but we are bound to receive an expression which has\r\nbeen long current. I suppose, however, you know that the addition of\r\n_Vis_ originated with Kepler, who, like my boy Tom, could not help\r\nthinking that the disposition of a body to maintain its motion, or\r\nstate of rest, indicated something like power; but we will not waste\r\nour time upon verbal disquisitions. It is clear, that matter, at rest,\r\nresists being put in motion; the degree of that resistance is always in\r\nproportion to the degree of force applied to put it in motion; or, to\r\nspeak more philosophically, that _Action and Reaction are equal, and in\r\nopposite directions_.”\r\n\r\n“You, surely, do not mean to say,” exclaimed Tom, “that if I strike my\r\nmarble, the marble strikes my hand, with the same force in return?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely; that is my meaning.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Louisa, “if a man strikes another on the face with his\r\nhand, do you seriously maintain that both parties suffer the same pain?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no,” said Tom, “papa can never intend to say that; I am quite\r\nsure, if it were the case, Mr. Pearson would not be so fond of boxing\r\nour ears.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour answered this question, by observing that, if the hand\r\npossessed the same degree of feeling as the face, they would both\r\nsuffer equally under the conflict. “If,” continued he, “you strike a\r\nglass bottle with an iron hammer, the blow will be received by the\r\nhammer and the glass; and it is quite immaterial whether the hammer be\r\nmoved against the bottle at rest, or the bottle be moved against the\r\nhammer at rest, yet the bottle will be broken, though the hammer be not\r\ninjured; because the same blow which is sufficient to shiver the glass\r\nis not sufficient to break or injure a lump of iron. In like manner,\r\nthe blow that is sufficient to pain your sensitive face, and make your\r\nears tingle, will not occasion the least annoyance to the obtuse hand\r\nof your preceptor. The operation of this law,” continued Mr. Seymour,\r\n“will be exemplified in every step of our progress. When the marble, as\r\nit rolls along, strikes any obstacles, it receives, in return, a\r\ncorresponding blow, which will be found to influence its subsequent\r\ndirection. The peg of the top, as it rubs on the ground, is as much\r\ninfluenced by the friction, as if a force were actually applied to it\r\nwhen in a state of rest; and when we consider the forces by which the\r\nkite is made to ascend into the air, you will learn, from the same law,\r\nthe nature of that advantage which you derive from running with it.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar observed that the subject of _Momentum_ might be introduced,\r\nand advantageously explained, upon this occasion.\r\n\r\n“Momentum,” said Tom; “and pray what is that?”\r\n\r\n“It is a power,” replied his father, “intimately connected with motion;\r\nand, therefore, as your friend, the vicar, justly remarks, may be very\r\nproperly introduced before we quit that subject.--It is the force with\r\nwhich a body in motion strikes against another body.”\r\n\r\n“That,” observed Tom, “must of course depend upon the velocity of the\r\nbody’s motion.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, my dear; the quicker a body moves, the greater must be\r\nthe force with which it would strike against another body; but we also\r\nknow that the heavier a body is, the greater also will be its force; so\r\nthat _momentum_, you perceive, must have a relation to both these\r\ncircumstances, viz. velocity, and weight; or, to speak more correctly,\r\n_the momentum of a body is composed of its quantity of matter,\r\nmultiplied by its quantity of motion_: for example, if the weight of a\r\nbody be represented by the number 3, and its velocity also by 3, its\r\n_momentum_ will be represented by 3 x 3 = 9; so that, in producing\r\nmomentum, increased velocity will always compensate for deficiency of\r\nmatter, and a light body may thus be made a more effective force than a\r\nheavy one, provided that its velocity be proportionally increased;\r\nthus, a small ball weighing only _two pounds_, and moving at the rate\r\nof _five hundred feet_ in a second, will produce as much effect as a\r\ncannon ball of _ten pounds_ in weight, provided it moved only at the\r\nrate of _one hundred feet_ in the same time.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see,” cried Tom, “whether I understand your statement. We must\r\nmultiply, as you say, the weight by the velocity; the weight of the\r\nsmall ball you state at two pounds, and it travels at the rate of five\r\nhundred feet in a second; then its momentum must be a thousand. The\r\nweight of the great ball is ten pounds, its velocity only a hundred\r\nfeet, then its momentum must also be a thousand; because, in both\r\ncases, the sums multiplied into each other will give the same product.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly: and thus you perceive that the small ball becomes an exact\r\nbalance to the larger one; the first making out in motion what it\r\nwanted in matter, while the latter makes out in matter what it wanted\r\nin motion. I wish you to keep this law of _Momentum_ in your\r\nremembrance; upon it depends the action of all the _mechanical\r\npowers_(8), as they are termed.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard,” said Louisa, “that a feather might be made to produce\r\nas much havoc as a cannon shot, if you could give it sufficient\r\nvelocity.”\r\n\r\n“Unquestionably: but there is a practical difficulty in the attempt,\r\nfrom the resistance of the air, which increases, as you have already\r\nseen in the experiment of the paper and penny-piece (p. 30), as the\r\nweight of a body decreases. Were it not for this resistance of the air,\r\na hailstone falling from the clouds would acquire such a momentum, from\r\nits accelerated velocity, as to descend like a bullet from a gun, and\r\ndestroy every thing before it; even those genial showers which refresh\r\nus in the spring and summer months, would, without such a provision,\r\ndestroy the herbage they are so well calculated to cherish. Had the\r\nelephant possessed the mobility of the beetle, it would have overturned\r\nmountains. From this view of the subject of Momentum,” continued Mr.\r\nSeymour, “you will easily understand why the immense battering rams,\r\nused by the ancients, in the art of war, should have given place to\r\ncannon balls, of but a few pounds in weight. Suppose, for example, that\r\nthe battering ram of Vespasian weighed 100,000 pounds, and was moved,\r\nwe will admit, with such a velocity, by strength of hands, as to pass\r\nthrough 20 feet in one second of time, and that this was found\r\nsufficient to demolish the walls of Jerusalem, can you tell me with\r\nwhat velocity a 32-pounder must move to do the same execution?”\r\n\r\n“I will try,” said Tom, as he took out his pencil and pocket-book, to\r\nmake the calculation. “The momentum of the battering ram must be\r\nestimated by its weight, multiplied into the space passed over in a\r\nsecond of time; which is 100,000 multiplied by 20; that will give\r\n2,000,000. Now, if this momentum, which must also be that of the cannon\r\nball, be divided by the weight of the ball, it will give the velocity\r\nrequired, which I make out to be 62,500 feet.”\r\n\r\n“Admirably calculated,” said Mr. Seymour: “and I will take care, my\r\ndear Tom, that your intelligence shall be suitably rewarded.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton here observed, that he thought “his young friends and\r\nplaymates” must have received, for that day, as much philosophy as they\r\ncould conveniently carry away without fatigue. Mr. Seymour concurred in\r\nthis observation; and the more readily, as the path they had to travel\r\nwas rugged, and beset with difficulties. “I will, therefore,” said he,\r\n“not impose any farther burthen upon them; but I will assist them in\r\ntying, into separate bundles, the materials which they have collected\r\nin their progress, in order that they may convey them away with greater\r\nease and security. Know then, my dear children,” said the affectionate\r\nparent, “that you have this day been instructed in the three great Laws\r\nof Motion, viz.\r\n\r\n    I. _That every body will continue in a state of rest, until put\r\n      into motion by some external force applied to it, and if that\r\n      force be single, the motion so produced will be rectilinear, i.e.\r\n      in the direction of a straight line._\r\n\r\n   II. _Change of motion is always proportional to the moving force\r\n      impressed, and is always made in the direction of the right line\r\n      in which the force acts._\r\n\r\n  III. _Action and Reaction are equal in equal quantities of matter,\r\n      and act in contrary directions to each other.”_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two men on the ice, falling in opposite directions.]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n _A sad accident turned to a good account.--One example worth a\r\n    hundred precepts.--The Centres of Magnitude and Gravity.--The\r\n    Point of Suspension.--The Line of Direction.--The stability of\r\n    bodies, and upon what it depends.--Method of finding the centre\r\n    of gravity of a body.--The art of the Balancer explained and\r\n    illustrated.--Various balancing toys._\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as Mr. Seymour was, on the following morning, stepping upon the\r\nlawn, with the intention of joining his children, Rosa and Fanny both\r\nmade their appearance completely drenched with water, and dripping like\r\nmermaids.\r\n\r\n“Heyday!” exclaimed their father, “how has this misfortune happened?”\r\n\r\n“Do not be angry, papa,” said Tom; “indeed, indeed, it was an accident.\r\nFanny, observing the water-cart in the garden, had just begun to wheel\r\nit forward, when the water rushed over her like a wave of the sea, and,\r\nupon stopping the cart, it flew over with equal force on the opposite\r\nside, and deluged poor Rosa, who was walking in front of it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, lose no time in changing your clothes, and meet me again\r\nin half an hour.”\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time the children reassembled on the lawn.\r\n\r\n“And so then,” said their father, “I perceive that my philosophical\r\nlesson of yesterday has been entirely lost upon you.”\r\n\r\nThe children were unable to comprehend the meaning of this rebuke; but\r\nMr. Seymour proceeded:--\r\n\r\n“I trust, however, that the accident of this morning will serve to\r\nimpress it more forcibly upon your memory: one example is better than a\r\nhundred precepts.”\r\n\r\nTom was more puzzled than ever.\r\n\r\n“You have met with an accident; I will endeavour to convert it into a\r\nsource of instruction, by showing you how the principles of natural\r\nphilosophy may be brought to bear upon the most trivial concerns of\r\nlife. You learned yesterday, that a body at rest offers a resistance to\r\nany force that would put it in motion, and that, when in motion, it\r\nequally opposes a state of rest; now let us apply this law for the\r\nexplanation of the accident that has just befallen you. The butt was\r\nfull of water; when you attempted to wheel it forward, the water\r\nresisted the motion thus communicated to the vessel, and from its _vis\r\ninertiæ_, or effort to remain at rest, rose up in a direction contrary\r\nto that in which the vessel moved, and consequently poured over; by\r\nthis time, however, the mass of fluid had acquired the motion of the\r\ncart, when you suddenly stopped it, and the water in endeavouring to\r\ncontinue its state of motion, from the same cause that it had just\r\nbefore resisted it, rose up on the opposite side, and thus deluged poor\r\nRosa.”\r\n\r\nLouisa was quite delighted with this simple and satisfactory\r\napplication of philosophy, and observed, that she should not herself\r\nmind a thorough soaking, if it were afterwards rewarded by a scientific\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n“I will give you, then, another illustration of the same law of\r\nmotion,” said Mr. Seymour, “which, instead of explaining an accident,\r\nmay, perhaps, have the effect of preventing one. If, while you are\r\nsitting quietly on your horse, the animal starts forward, you will be\r\nin danger of falling off _backward_; but if, while you are galloping\r\nalong, it should stop suddenly, you will inevitably be thrown _forward_\r\nover the head of the animal.”\r\n\r\n“I clearly perceive,” said Louisa, “that such would be my fate under\r\nthe circumstances you state.”\r\n\r\n“Now, then, my dear children, since our friend the vicar cannot attend\r\nus at present, suppose we retire to the library, where I have an\r\ninteresting experiment to perform, and a new toy ready for your\r\ninspection.”\r\n\r\nIn compliance with their father’s wishes, the children cheerfully\r\nreturned to the library, when Mr. Seymour presented Louisa with a\r\nBANDILOR. Most of our readers are, doubtless, acquainted with this\r\nelegant toy. It consists of two discs of wood, united to each other by\r\na small axis, upon which a piece of string is affixed. When this string\r\nis wound round the axis, and the bandilor is suffered to run down from\r\nthe hand, the end of the string being held by a loop on the fore\r\nfinger, its momentum winds up the string again, and thus it will\r\ncontinue for any length of time to descend from, and ascend to, the\r\nhand. It affords a good example of the operation of _vis inertiæ_, or\r\nwhat may, with equal propriety, be termed _the momentum of rotatory\r\nmotion_. Its action may be compared to that of a wheel, which, running\r\ndown a hill, acquires sufficient momentum to carry it up another. There\r\nare several toys which owe their operation to the same principle, of\r\nwhich we may particularize the windmill, whose fliers are pulled round\r\nby a string affixed to the axis of the sails. In playing with the\r\nbandilor, a certain address is required to prevent the sudden check\r\nwhich the toy would otherwise receive when it arrived at the end of the\r\nstring, and which would necessarily so destroy its momentum as to\r\nprevent its winding itself up again. Mr. Seymour now informed his young\r\npupils that he had an experiment to exhibit, which would further\r\nillustrate, in a very pleasing manner, the truth of the doctrine of\r\n_vis inertiæ_. He accordingly inverted a wine-glass, and placed a\r\nshilling on its foot; and, having pushed it suddenly along the table,\r\nthe coin flew off, towards the operator, or in a direction opposite to\r\nthat in which the glass was moving. He then replaced the shilling, and\r\nimparted to the glass a less sudden motion; and, when it had acquired\r\nsufficient velocity, he checked it, and the coin darted forward,\r\nleaving the glass behind it.\r\n\r\nLouisa, upon witnessing this experiment, observed that she felt\r\nsatisfied of the correctness of her father’s statement, when he told\r\nher that, if the horse suddenly started forward, when she was at rest,\r\nshe would be thrown off behind, and that if it should suddenly stop on\r\nthe gallop, she would be precipitated over its head. The children now\r\narranged themselves around the table, in order to consider several\r\ncurious toys which Mr. Seymour had collected for the purpose of\r\nexplaining the nature of the _Centre of Gravity_.\r\n\r\n“But, in the first place,” said Mr. Seymour, “can you tell me, Tom,\r\nwhat is meant by _The Centre of Gravity_?”\r\n\r\n“Its central point,” answered the boy.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not; the central point is termed its centre of _magnitude_,\r\nnot that of gravity; and it is only when a body is of uniform density,\r\nand regular figure, that these centres of magnitude and gravity\r\ncoincide, or fall in the same spot.”\r\n\r\n“I now remember,” cried Tom, “that the centre of gravity is that point,\r\nabout which all the parts of a body exactly balance each other.”\r\n\r\n“Now you are right; it is, in other words, that point in which the\r\nwhole weight, or gravitating influence, of a body is, as it were,\r\ncondensed or concentrated, and upon which, if the body be freely\r\nsuspended, it will rest with security; and consequently, as long as\r\nthis centre is supported, the body can never fall; while, in every\r\nother position, it will endeavour to descend to the lowest place at\r\nwhich it can arrive.”\r\n\r\n“Have all bodies, whatever may be their shape, a centre of gravity?”\r\nasked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“And you say,” continued Louisa, “that every body will fall, if this\r\npoint is not supported.”\r\n\r\n“Infallibly. And now, Tom,” said Mr. Seymour, “can you tell me what is\r\nmeant by the _line of direction_?”\r\n\r\nThe young philosopher was unable to answer this question, and his\r\nfather, therefore, informed him that, if a perpendicular line were\r\ndrawn from the centre of gravity of a body to the centre of the earth,\r\nsuch a line would be termed the _line of direction_; along which every\r\nbody, not supported, endeavours to fall; and he was also informed that,\r\nif this said line fell within the base of a body, such a body was sure\r\nto stand; but never otherwise.\r\n\r\nLouisa observed that she was not quite sure she understood her papa’s\r\nmeaning, and therefore begged for further explanation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Overloaded cart with plumb line hanging from\r\nits center of gravity to outside its base of support.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Properly loaded cart with plumb line hanging\r\nfrom its center of gravity to inside its base of support.]\r\n\r\n“I will exemplify it then,” replied Mr. Seymour, “by a drawing. Fig. 10\r\nrepresents a load of stones in a cart moving upon the sloping road\r\nC D E; this load, being low down in the cart, B will represent its\r\ncentre of gravity, and B F its line of direction, which, you perceive,\r\nfalls much within the supporting or lower wheel G; and there cannot,\r\ntherefore, be any danger of such a cart being overturned; but in fig.\r\n11, the centre of gravity is raised from its former position to H, and\r\nH I is now the line of direction; which, falling without the base, or\r\nwheel K, the load will not be supported, and must consequently fall.\r\nThese figures,” added Mr. Seymour, “will also explain a fact which you\r\nmust have frequently observed, that a body is stable or firm in\r\nproportion to the breadth of its base; hence the difficulty of\r\nsustaining a tall body, like a walking stick, upon its narrow base; of\r\nthat of balancing a hoop upon its edge, or a top upon its point; while,\r\non the contrary, it is almost impossible to upset the cone or the\r\npyramid, since, in the latter cases, the _line of direction_ falls\r\nwithin the middle of the base, the centre of gravity of the body being\r\nnecessarily low.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” observed Louisa, “that this is the reason why carriages,\r\nwhen too much loaded, are so apt to upset.”\r\n\r\n“Say, when too much loaded on their _tops_, and you will be right. As\r\nyou now, I trust, understand this part of the subject, let us proceed a\r\nstep farther: if you take any body, with a view to suspend it, is it\r\nnot evident, that if it be suspended by that point in which the centre\r\nof gravity is situated, it must remain at rest in _any_ position\r\nindifferently?”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said Tom, “we had already settled that question.”\r\n\r\n“True, my dear boy; but there is another question of great importance\r\narising out of it, and which you have not yet considered: tell me,\r\nshould the body be suspended on any other point, in what position it\r\ncan rest?”\r\n\r\n“I do not exactly understand the question.”\r\n\r\n“There are,” replied his father, “only two positions in which it could\r\nrest, either where the centre of gravity is exactly _above_, or exactly\r\n_below_, the point of suspension; so that, in short, this point shall\r\nbe in the _line of direction_. Where the point of suspension is _below_\r\nthe centre of gravity, it is extremely difficult to balance or support\r\na tall body by such a method, because the centre of gravity is always\r\nendeavouring to get under the point of support. Look at this diagram,\r\nand you will readily comprehend my meaning. K is the centre of gravity\r\nof the diamond-shaped figure, which may be supported, or balanced, on a\r\npin passing through it at M, as long as the centre of gravity K is\r\nimmediately over the point of suspension M: but if that centre is\r\nremoved in the slightest degree, either to the right or left of its\r\nplace K, the body will no longer retain its erect position I K L, but\r\nit will revolve upon M, and place itself in the situation indicated by\r\nthe dotted lines beneath the point M: and its centre of gravity will\r\nnow be removed to N, directly _under_ M, and in the line K L, which, as\r\nyou well know, is the line of direction. Have I rendered myself\r\nintelligible?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Diagram of a kite’s center of gravity.]\r\n\r\n“I understand it perfectly,” answered Tom.\r\n\r\n“And do you also, my dear Louisa?”\r\n\r\nLouisa’s answer was equally satisfactory, and Mr. Seymour went on to\r\nstate that the information they had now acquired would enable them to\r\nascertain the situation of the centre of gravity of any plane surface\r\nwhich was portable, notwithstanding it might possess the utmost\r\nirregularity of shape.\r\n\r\n“You shall, for example,” continued he, “find the centre of gravity in\r\nyour kite.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say,” observed Tom, “how I should set about it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, fetch your kite, and I will explain the method.”\r\n\r\nTom soon produced it, and the tail having been removed, Mr. Seymour\r\nproceeded as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Kite viewed right side up.]\r\n\r\n“I now,” said he, “suspend the kite by the loop at its bow, and since\r\nit is at rest, we know that the centre of gravity must be exactly below\r\nthe point of suspension; if, therefore, we draw a perpendicular line\r\nfrom that point, which may be easily done by a plumb-line, with a\r\nweight attached to it, such a line will represent the _line of\r\ndirection_ (as indicated by A B in fig. 13)”.\r\n\r\n“It is clear enough,” said Tom, “that the centre of gravity must lie in\r\nthe line A B, but how are we to find in what part of it?”\r\n\r\n“By suspending the kite in another direction,” answered Mr. Seymour,\r\nwho then hung it up in the position represented at fig. 14, “and then\r\nby drawing another perpendicular from the new point of suspension.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Kite viewed at a diagonal.]\r\n\r\n“The centre of gravity,” said Louisa, “will in that case be in the line\r\n_c d_, as it was before in that of _a b_.”\r\n\r\n“In both the lines!” exclaimed Tom, with some surprise; “it cannot be\r\nin two places.”\r\n\r\n“And therefore,” added Mr. Seymour, “it must be in that point in which\r\nthe lines meet and cross each other:” so saying, he marked the spot _g_\r\nwith his pencil, and then told his little scholars, that he would soon\r\nconvince them of the accuracy of the principle. He accordingly placed\r\nthe head of his stick upon the pencil mark, and the kite was found to\r\nbalance itself with great exactness.\r\n\r\n“True, papa,” said Tom, “that point must be the centre of gravity, for\r\nall the parts of the kite exactly balance each other about it.”\r\n\r\n“It is really,” observed Louisa, “a very simple method of finding the\r\ncentre of gravity.”\r\n\r\n“It is,” said Mr. Seymour; “but you must remember that it will only\r\napply to a certain description of bodies: when they are not portable,\r\nand will not admit of this kind of examination, their centres of\r\ngravity can only be ascertained by experiment or calculation, in which\r\nthe weight, density, and situation of the respective materials must be\r\ntaken into the account. Having proceeded thus far, you have next to\r\nlearn that the centre of gravity is sometimes so situated as not to be\r\n_within_ the body, but actually at some distance from it.”\r\n\r\n“Why, papa!” exclaimed Tom, “how can that possibly happen?”\r\n\r\n“You shall hear. The centre of gravity, as you have just said, is that\r\npoint about which all the parts of a body balance each other: but it\r\nmay so happen that there is a vacant space at this point. Where, for\r\nexample, is the centre of gravity of this ring? Must it not be in the\r\nspace which the ring encircles?”\r\n\r\n“I think it must,” said Tom; “and yet how can it be ever supported\r\nwithout touching the ring?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One ring supported by a string, and another ring\r\nbalanced on a finger.]\r\n\r\n“That point cannot be supported,” answered his father, “unless the ring\r\nbe so held that the line of direction shall fall within the base of the\r\nsupport, which will be the case whether you poise the ring on the tip\r\nof your finger, or suspend it by a string, as represented in the\r\nfigures which I have copied from the ‘Conversations on Natural\r\nPhilosophy.’ I need scarcely add, that it will be more stably supported\r\nin the latter position, because the centre of gravity is below the\r\npoint of suspension; whereas in the former the base is extremely\r\nnarrow, and it will, consequently, require all the address of the\r\nbalancer to prevent the centre of gravity from falling beyond it. As\r\nyou are now in possession of all the leading principles upon which the\r\noperations of the centre of gravity depend, I shall put a few practical\r\nquestions to you, in order that I may be satisfied you understand them.\r\nTell me, therefore, why a person who is fearful of falling, as, for\r\ninstance, when he leans forward, should invariably put forward one of\r\nhis feet, as you did the other day, when you looked into Overton well?”\r\n\r\n“To increase his base,” answered Tom; “whenever I lean greatly forward,\r\nI should throw the line of direction beyond it, did I not at the same\r\ninstant put out one of my feet, so as to extend my base, and thus to\r\ncause the line to continue within it.”\r\n\r\n“Rightly answered; and, for the same reason, a porter with a load on\r\nhis back leans forward, to prevent his burthen from throwing the line\r\nof direction out of the base behind. So the horse, in drawing a heavy\r\nweight, instinctively leans forward, in order to throw the whole of his\r\nweight as a counterbalance; and yet,” observed Mr. Seymour, “we are in\r\nthe habit of ignorantly restraining him by a bearing rein, in\r\nconsequence of which he has to call in the aid of his muscles, by which\r\na very unnecessary exhaustion of strength is produced. Thus is it that\r\nGerman and French horses draw heavy weights with apparently greater\r\nease to themselves, because the Germans tie a horse’s nose _downwards_,\r\nwhile the French, more wisely, leave them at perfect liberty. But to\r\nproceed. Did you ever observe the manner in which a woman carries a\r\npail of water?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” said Tom; “she always stretches out one of her arms.”\r\n\r\n“The weight of the pail,” continued Mr. Seymour, “throws the centre of\r\ngravity on one side, and the woman, therefore, stretches out the\r\nopposite arm, in order to bring it back again into its original\r\nsituation; did she not do this, she must, like the English draught\r\nhorses, exert her muscles as a counteracting force, which would greatly\r\nincrease the fatigue of the operation: but a pail hanging on each arm\r\nis carried without difficulty, because they balance each other, and the\r\ncentre of gravity remains supported by the feet.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Louisa, “that all you have said about the woman and her\r\npail must be true; but how could she have learned the principle which\r\nthus enabled her to keep the centre of gravity in its proper place?”\r\n\r\n“By experience. It is very unlikely that she should ever have heard of\r\nsuch a principle, any more than those people who pack carts and\r\nwaggons, and yet make up their loads with such accuracy as always to\r\nkeep the line of direction in, or near, the middle of the base. But to\r\nproceed to another example--have I not frequently cautioned you against\r\njumping up suddenly in a boat? Can you tell me upon what principle such\r\nan operation must be attended with danger?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Tom, “for the very same reason that a waggon is more\r\nlikely to be overturned when its top is too heavily laden; it would\r\nelevate the centre of gravity, and thereby render the line of direction\r\nliable to be thrown beyond the base, and so upset the boat.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour observed, that after this lesson he thought the balancing\r\nwhich Tom and Louisa had witnessed at Astley’s theatre, last year,\r\nwould cease to appear so miraculous. Louisa declared that she had now\r\ndiscovered the whole mystery.\r\n\r\n“You have doubtless perceived,” said her father, “that the art entirely\r\nconsists in dexterously altering the centre of gravity upon every new\r\nposition of the body, so as constantly to preserve the line of\r\ndirection within the base. Rope-dancers effect this by means of a long\r\npole, the ends of which are loaded by weights, and which they hold\r\nacross the rope. If you had paid sufficient attention to their\r\nmovements, you must have perceived how steadily they fixed their eyes\r\non some object near the rope, so as to discover the slightest deviation\r\nof their centre of gravity to one or the other of its sides, which they\r\nno sooner detect, than they instantly rectify it by a countervailing\r\nmotion of their pole, and are thus enabled to preserve the line of\r\ndirection within the narrow base. This very same expedient is\r\nfrequently practised by ourselves; if we slip or stumble with one foot,\r\nwe naturally extend the opposite arm, making the same use of it as the\r\nrope-dancer does of his pole. Many birds, also, by means of their\r\nflexible necks, vary the position of their centre of gravity in the\r\nsame manner. When they sleep, they turn it towards the back, and place\r\nit under the wing, in order to lay the greatest weight on the point\r\nabove the feet.”\r\n\r\n“What an interesting subject this is,” cried Louisa, “and how many\r\ncurious things it is capable of explaining!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed is it; and I shall take an opportunity of pointing out several\r\nspecimens of art (9) which are indebted for their stability to the\r\nscientific application of the principle we have been considering;--but\r\nI have now a paradox for you, Tom.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hear it, papa.”\r\n\r\n“How comes it that a stick, loaded with a weight at the upper\r\nextremity, can be kept in equilibrio, on the point of the finger, with\r\nmuch greater ease than when the weight is near the lower extremity, or,\r\nfor instance, that a sword can be balanced on the finger much better\r\nwhen the hilt is uppermost?”\r\n\r\n“That is indeed strange. I should have thought,” replied Louisa, “that\r\nthe higher the weight was placed above the point of support, the more\r\nreadily would the line of direction have been thrown beyond the base.”\r\n\r\n“In that respect you are perfectly right; but the balancer will be able\r\nto restore it more easily in one case than in the other; since, for\r\nreasons which you will presently discover, the greater the circle which\r\na body describes in falling, the less will be its tendency to fall.\r\nLook at the sketch which I have prepared for the explanation of this\r\nfact, and I think you will readily comprehend the reason of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Man balancing a sword in each hand, hilt up in one, hilt\r\ndown in other, showing arc of centres of gravity for each.]\r\n\r\n“When the weight is at a considerable distance from the point of\r\nsupport, its centre of gravity, in deviating either on one side or the\r\nother from a perpendicular direction, describes a larger circle, as at\r\n_a_, than when the weight is very near to the centre of rotation or the\r\npoint of support, as at _b_. But, in a large circle, an arc of any\r\ndeterminate extent, such as an inch, for example, describes a curve\r\nwhich deviates much less from the perpendicular than if the circle were\r\nless; as may be seen by comparing the positions of the sword at _d_ and\r\n_e_; and the sword at _d_ will not have so great a tendency to deviate\r\nfarther from the perpendicular, as that at _e_; for its tendency to\r\ndeviate altogether from the perpendicular is greater, according as the\r\ntangent to that point of the arc, where it happens to be, approaches\r\nmore to the vertical position. You see then that it is less difficult\r\nto balance a tall, than a shorter pole; and it is for the same reason\r\nthat a person can walk with greater security on high than on low\r\nstilts.”\r\n\r\n“That is very clear,” said Louisa, “although, before your explanation,\r\nI always associated the idea of difficulty with their height.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” added Tom, “that the whole art of walking on stilts may be\r\nexplained by the principles you have taught us.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly it may; for the equilibrium is preserved by varying the\r\nposition of the body, and thus keeping the centre of gravity within the\r\nbase.”\r\n\r\n“It must be a great exertion,” observed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Before custom has rendered it familiar; after which, there is no more\r\nfatigue in walking on stilts, than in walking on our feet. There is a\r\ndistrict in the south of France, near Bourdeaux, called the Desert of\r\nLandes, which runs along the sea coast between the mouths of the Adour\r\nand Gironde, where all the shepherds are mounted on stilts; on which\r\nthey move with perfect freedom, and astonishing rapidity; and so easily\r\ndoes habit enable them to preserve their balance, that they run, jump,\r\nstoop, and even dance, with ease and security.”\r\n\r\n“How very odd!” said Tom; “what can be their motive for such a strange\r\nhabit?”\r\n\r\n“Its objects,” replied his father, “are important: to keep the feet out\r\nof the water, which, during the winter, is deep on the sands; and to\r\ndefend them from the heated sand during the summer; in addition to\r\nwhich, the sphere of vision over so perfect a flat is materially\r\nincreased by the elevation, and the shepherds are thus enabled to see\r\ntheir flocks at a much greater distance.[9] They cannot, however, stand\r\nperfectly still upon their stilts, without the aid of a long staff,\r\nwhich they always carry in their hands; this guards them against any\r\naccidental trip, and, when they wish to be at rest, forms a third leg\r\nthat keeps them steady.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Louisa; “that the habit of using these stilts is\r\nacquired while they are very young.”\r\n\r\n“It is, my dear: and it appears that, the smaller the boy is, the\r\nhigher are his stilts; a fact which affords a practical proof of the\r\ntruth of what I have just stated.”\r\n\r\n“The stork is said, in my work on Natural History, to be always walking\r\non stilts,” said Louisa; “and yet it does not appear to fatigue him.”\r\n\r\n“That is very true,” replied the father; “but you must remember, that\r\nnature has furnished the bird with a provision, by which the legs are\r\nkept extended without any exertion of the muscles, in the manner of\r\ncertain springs; a structure which enables it to pass whole days and\r\nnights on one foot, without the slightest fatigue. If you will visit\r\nthe cook the next time she trusses a fowl, you will at once perceive\r\nthe nature and utility of this structure; upon bending the legs and\r\nthighs up towards the body, you will observe that the claws close of\r\ntheir own accord; now, this is the position of the limbs in which the\r\nbird rests upon its perch, and in this position it sleeps in safety,\r\nfor the claws do their office in keeping hold of the support, not by\r\nany voluntary exertion, but by the weight of the body drawing the\r\nstrings tight.”\r\n\r\n“But, papa,” said Tom, “I have yet some more questions to ask you on\r\nthe subject of balancing. I am not at all satisfied about many of the\r\ntricks that we saw last year; indeed, I cannot believe, that many of\r\nthose astonishing feats can be explained by the rules you have just\r\ngiven us.”\r\n\r\n“I very well know to what you allude,” replied Mr. Seymour. “Many\r\nsingular deceptions are certainly practised by removing the centre of\r\ngravity from its natural into an artificial situation, or by disguising\r\nits place; thus, a cylinder placed upon an inclined surface may be made\r\nto run _up_, instead of _down_ hill. I can even appear to balance a\r\npailful of water on the slender stem of a tobacco-pipe: but I shall be\r\nenabled to explain the nature of these deceptions by some toys which I\r\nhave provided for your amusement, and which I must say you are fully\r\nentitled to possess, as a reward for the clear and satisfactory manner\r\nin which you have this day answered my questions. But see! here comes\r\nMr. Twaddleton: he would really seem to possess an instinct that always\r\nbrings him to the Lodge whenever I am preparing some amusement for you.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar smiled as he entered the room, but, unwilling to interrupt\r\nthe lesson, he placed his fore finger on his lip, and, with a\r\nsignificant nod, silently took a seat at the table. The children\r\nlaughed aloud at this cautious demeanour; and Tom exclaimed, “Why, Mr.\r\nTwaddleton, our lesson is over, and we are going to receive some new\r\ntoys as a reward.”\r\n\r\n“I have here,” said Mr. Seymour, as he opened a large wooden box, “a\r\ncollection of figures, which will always raise themselves upright, and\r\npreserve the erect position; or regain it, whenever it may have been\r\ndisturbed.”\r\n\r\nHe then arranged these figures in battalion on the table, and striking\r\nthem flat by drawing a rod over them, they immediately started up\r\nagain, as soon as it was removed. “These figures,” continued he, “were\r\nbought at Paris some years ago, under the title of _Prussians_.”\r\n\r\n“I declare,” exclaimed the vicar, “they remind me of the rebellious\r\nspirits whom Milton represents as saying that ascent is their natural,\r\nand descent their unnatural, motion.”[10]\r\n\r\n“I have seen skreens similarly constructed,” said Mrs. Seymour, “which\r\nalways rose up, of themselves, upon the removal of the force that had\r\npressed them down.”\r\n\r\n“I will explain their principle,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Suppose we first examine the construction of the figure,” observed the\r\nvicar. “Bless me! why it is like Philotus the poet, who was so thin and\r\nlight, that lead was fastened to his shoes to prevent his being blown\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Toy soldier mounted on the flat part of a hemisphere.]\r\n\r\n“The figure,” said Mr. Seymour, “is made of the pith of the elder-tree,\r\nwhich is extremely light, and is affixed to the half of a leaden\r\nbullet; on account, therefore, of the disproportion between the weight\r\nof the figure and that of its base, we may exclude the consideration of\r\nthe former, and confine our attention to the latter. The centre of\r\ngravity of the hemispherical base is, of course, in its axis; and\r\ntherefore tends to approach the horizontal plane as much as possible,\r\nand this can never be accomplished, until the axis becomes\r\nperpendicular to the horizon. Whenever the curved surface is in any\r\nother position, the centre of gravity is not in the lowest place to\r\nwhich it can descend, as may be seen by the diagram which I have just\r\nsketched. If the axis _a b_ be removed to _c d_, it is evident that the\r\ncentre of gravity will be raised, and that, if left alone, it would\r\nimmediately descend again into its original position.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Hemisphere shown in two positions using solid\r\nand dotted lines.]\r\n\r\n“I understand it perfectly,” said Tom. “When the axis _a b_ is\r\nperpendicular, the centre of gravity will be in its lowest point, or as\r\nnear the earth as it can place itself; when, therefore, the figure is\r\npressed down, the centre of gravity is raised, and, consequently, on\r\nthe removal of that pressure, it will descend to its original position,\r\nand thus raise the figure.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Toy man with sword, turban, and shield, mounted on a\r\ncandlestick with weights jutting out and down from both sides.]\r\n\r\n“I see you understand it. Here, then,” continued Mr. Seymour, “is\r\nanother toy in further illustration of our subject. It consists of a\r\nsmall figure, supported on a stand by a ball, which is quite loose; and\r\nyet it is made to turn and balance itself in all directions, always\r\nrecovering its erect position, when the force applied to it is removed.\r\nThe two weights, in this case, bring the centre of gravity considerably\r\n_below_ the point of suspension or support, and therefore maintain the\r\nfigure upright, and make it resume its perpendicular position, after it\r\nhas been inclined to either side; for the centre of gravity cannot\r\nplace itself as low as possible, without making the figure stand erect.”\r\n\r\n“That is very evident,” cried Louisa.\r\n\r\n“I shall next exhibit to you,” continued Mr. Seymour, “a toy that\r\nfurnishes a very good solution of a popular paradox in mechanics; viz.\r\n_A body having a tendency to fall by its own weight, how to prevent it\r\nfrom falling, by adding to it a weight on the same side on which it\r\ntends to fall._”\r\n\r\n“That is indeed a paradox!” exclaimed Louisa. “The next time I see the\r\ngardener sinking under the load of a heavy sack, I shall desire him to\r\nlighten his burden by doubling its weight.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Toy horse with its back legs on a ledge, with a weight\r\nattached to its belly with a wire which curves back and down under the\r\nledge.]\r\n\r\n“Will you, indeed, Miss Pert? I do not think so, after you have seen\r\nthe operation of the toy I am now about to exhibit. Here, you perceive,\r\nis a horse, the centre of gravity of which would be somewhere about the\r\nmiddle of its body; it is, therefore, very evident that, if I were to\r\nplace its hinder legs on the edge of the table, the line of _direction_\r\nwould fall considerably beyond the base, and the horse must be\r\nprecipitated to the ground; you will, however, perceive that there is a\r\nstiff wire attached to a weight which is connected with the body of the\r\nhorse, and by means of such an addition, the horse prances with perfect\r\nsecurity at the edge of the precipice: so that the figure which was\r\nincapable of supporting itself is actually prevented from falling, by\r\nadding a weight to its unsupported end!”\r\n\r\nThe children admitted the truth of this statement, and were not\r\nimmediately prepared to explain it.\r\n\r\n“The weight, indeed, appears to be added on that side; but, in reality,\r\nit is on the opposite side,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“In order to produce the desired effect,” observed Mr. Seymour, “the\r\nwire must be bent, so as to throw the weight far back, under the table;\r\nby which contrivance, since the centre of gravity of the whole compound\r\nfigure is thrown into the leaden weight, the hind legs of the horse\r\nthus become the point of suspension, on which the ball may be made to\r\nvibrate with perfect security.”\r\n\r\n“Now I understand it,” cried Tom; “instead of the weight supporting the\r\nhorse, the horse supports the weight.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so. You perceive, therefore, from these few examples, that the\r\nbalancer, by availing himself of such deceptions, and combining with\r\nthem a considerable degree of manual dexterity, may perform feats,\r\nwhich, at first sight, will appear in direct opposition to the laws of\r\ngravity. There is also another expedient of which the balancer avails\r\nhimself, to increase the wonder of his performances, and that is the\r\ninfluence of rotatory motion, which, you will presently see, may be\r\nmade to counteract the force of gravity.”\r\n\r\n“I remember that the most surprising of all the tricks I witnessed was\r\none, in which a sword was suspended on a key, which turned round on the\r\nend of a tobacco-pipe; on the top of the sword a pewter-plate was, at\r\nthe same time, made to revolve with great velocity.”\r\n\r\n“I well remember the trick to which you allude. The rotatory motion\r\nprevented the sword from falling, just as you will hereafter find the\r\nspinning of the top will preserve it in an erect position. There is\r\nalso another effect produced by rotatory motion, with which it is\r\nessential that you should become acquainted. You, no doubt, remember\r\nthat momentum, or the velocity of a body, will compensate for its want\r\nof matter. A number of bodies, therefore, although incapable of\r\nbalancing each other when in a state of rest, may be made to do so, by\r\nimparting to them different degrees of motion. I believe that you are\r\nnow acquainted with all the principles upon which the art of balancing\r\ndepends; and I have little doubt, should we again witness a performance\r\nof this kind, that you will be able to explain the tricks which\r\nformerly appeared to you so miraculous.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three boys using stilts.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  In Scotland stilts are used to pass rivers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  A The vicar here alludes to the speech of Moloch (Paradise Lost, b.\r\n  ii. 1. 75):--\r\n\r\n                 “That in our proper motion we ascend\r\n                 Up to our native seat: descent and fall\r\n                 To us is adverse.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A man holding a balloon with a face on it, blown up, and\r\nsix people laughing at the sight.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n _The Chinese Tumblers, illustrating the joint effects of change in\r\n    the centre of gravity of a body, and of momentum.--Mr.\r\n    Twaddleton’s arrival after a series of adventures.--The Dancing\r\n    Balls.--The Pea-shooter.--A figure that dances on a\r\n    fountain.--The Flying Witch.--Elasticity.--Springs.--The game of\r\n    “Ricochet,” or Duck and Drake.--The Rebounding Ball.--Animals\r\n    that leap by means of an elastic apparatus.--A new species of\r\n    puffing, by which the Vicar is made to change countenance._\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on Monday morning did the young group assemble in the library;\r\nthey had been told by Mrs. Seymour that their father had received a new\r\ntoy of a very interesting and instructive nature, and we can easily\r\nimagine the eagerness with which they anticipated the sight of it.\r\n\r\n“I trust,” said Mr. Seymour, “that after our late discussion, the\r\nsubject of the centre of gravity is thoroughly understood by you all. I\r\nhave also reason to think that the nature and effects of what is termed\r\n_momentum_ have been rendered intelligible to you.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly understand both those subjects,” answered Tom; and so\r\nthought the rest of the party.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I will put your knowledge to the test,” observed Mr.\r\nSeymour, “for you shall explain to me the mechanism of these _Chinese\r\nTumblers_.” Upon which he produced an oblong box, which, by opening,\r\nformed a series of stairs or steps, and took from a drawer at its end\r\ntwo grotesque figures (_Clown_ and _Pantaloon_), which were connected\r\nwith each other by two poles, which they appeared in the attitude of\r\ncarrying, pretty much in the way that the porters carry the poles of a\r\nsedan-chair. The foremost figure was then placed upon the top step,\r\nwhen, to the great astonishment of the whole party, the figures very\r\ndeliberately descended the several stairs, each turning over the other\r\nin succession.\r\n\r\n“There was a period in our history,” observed Mrs. Seymour, “when so\r\nmarvellous an exhibition would have subjected the inventor to the\r\npenalties of sorcery.”\r\n\r\n“That,” remarked Mr. Seymour, “may be said of most of the other\r\ninventions which I have yet in store to illustrate the powers conferred\r\nupon us by a knowledge of natural philosophy; but, as far as mechanical\r\nskill is concerned, I doubt whether the ancients did not even surpass\r\nus, especially in the art of constructing automata; and as quicksilver\r\nwas known in the remotest ages, I think it not improbable that it was\r\none of the agents employed by them on such occasions. If I remember\r\nright, Aristotle describes a wooden Venus, which moved by means of\r\n‘_liquid silver_;’ then, again, the moving tripods which Apollonius saw\r\nin the Indian temples--the walking statues at Antium, and in the temple\r\nof Hierapolis, and the wooden pigeon of Archytas,[11] ought,\r\nundoubtedly, to be regarded as evidences of their mechanical resources.\r\nBut let us reserve these literary questions for the better judgment of\r\nour worthy friend the vicar, and proceed to consider the mechanism of\r\nthe toy before us. Tom,” continued he, “take the figures in your hand\r\nand examine them.”\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the young philosopher received the figures from the hand\r\nof his father than he declared that the tubes were hollow, and that he\r\nfelt some liquid running backwards and forwards in them.\r\n\r\n“You are quite right, my boy,” said Mr. Seymour, “they contain\r\nquicksilver.”\r\n\r\n“Now then I understand it,” cried Tom; “the quicksilver runs down the\r\ntubes and alters the centre of gravity of the figures, and so makes\r\nthem tumble over each other.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I acknowledge that is no bad guess as a beginning, and will\r\ncertainly explain the first movement; but you will be pleased to\r\nrecollect that the instant a new centre of gravity is thus produced the\r\nfigures must remain at rest--how, then, will you explain their\r\ncontinued motion?”\r\n\r\n“You said something, I think, about momentum; did you not, papa?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; and to its agency the continuance of the motions is to be\r\nascribed: but I will explain the operation more fully.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then proceeded to point out the mechanism and movements of\r\nthe toy in a manner which we shall endeavour to convey to our readers\r\nby the aid of the annexed engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two jokers connected by poles and strings and in the\r\nprocess of descending some steps.]\r\n\r\n“As soon as the figure A is placed upon the step D, in the position A\r\nB, the quicksilver, by running down the inclined tubes, swings the\r\nfigure B round to C; and the centre of gravity having been thus\r\nadjusted, the whole would remain at rest but for the contrivance to be\r\nnext described. Besides their connexion with the poles by means of\r\npivots, the figures are connected with each other by silken strings,\r\nwhich keep the figure B steadily in its position, while it traverses\r\nthe arc until it arrives at C, when their increased tension has the\r\neffect of capsizing it, and of thus producing a momentum, which, by\r\ncarrying its centre of gravity beyond the line of direction, causes it\r\nto descend upon the step E, when the quicksilver, by again flowing to\r\nthe lowest part of the tubes, places the figures in the same position,\r\nonly one step lower, as they were at the commencement of their action;\r\nand thus, by successive repetitions of the same changes, it is quite\r\nevident that the figures must continue to descend as long as any steps\r\nremain for their reception.”\r\n\r\n“I understand it perfectly,” observed Louisa, with a smile of\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“I need scarcely say,” continued Mr. Seymour, “that there are some\r\nniceties in the adjustment of the minuter parts of the apparatus,\r\nwithout which the effect could not be accomplished; the quantity of\r\nquicksilver, for instance, must bear its proper proportion to the\r\nweight and dimensions of the figure: and in order to prevent its too\r\nrapid passage along the inclined tubes, strings are stretched across\r\ntheir interior to retard the stream. Then, again, some management is\r\nnecessary with regard to the silken strings, in order to ensure a\r\nnecessary degree of tension. I will now show you,” said he, “a single\r\ntumbler, which will perform the same motions without the assistance of\r\nany tubes.”\r\n\r\n“But not without quicksilver,” observed Tom, “which, I suppose, must,\r\nin this case, be put into the body of the figure.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right; and it is made to pass from one extremity of its\r\nbody to the other through a small orifice, which has the same effect as\r\nthe strings in the tubes, in breaking the current and preventing its\r\ntoo rapid motion. In all other respects, the principle is the same as\r\nin the double figures.”\r\n\r\nJust as Mr. Seymour had terminated his exhibition of ‘_Le petit\r\nCulbuteur_,’ the welcome appearance of the vicar infused fresh spirits\r\ninto the little party.\r\n\r\n“My dear friends,” said Mr. Twaddleton, “I have been most provokingly\r\ndetained by that tiresome etymologist Jeffrey Prybabel. I made many\r\nefforts to escape, but I was as a fly in a cobweb.”\r\n\r\n“He is the greatest bore in all Christendom; I knew him well,” observed\r\nMr. Seymour, “when he practised as a Conveyancer in Gray’s-Inn, and\r\nwent by the nickname of the Riot Act; for, in such horror was he held,\r\nthat, if a number of persons were congregated, his approach was sure to\r\ndisperse them. But what has been the subject of your discourse?--was\r\nthe etymologist merely airing his vocabulary, or did he propose some\r\ndifficult question for discussion? Be this, however, as it may, I will\r\nventure to say that he was, as usual, loquacious on the subject of\r\n_mutes_--dry on the use of _liquids_, and descanting without end on the\r\nimportance of a _termination_?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Seymour, I am really and truly ashamed of you; punning, under any\r\ncircumstances, is a most disgraceful habit, but when employed to\r\ndistort the meaning of language it becomes absolutely criminal.”\r\n\r\nTo turn the subject of this discourse, the vicar proceeded to inform\r\nMr. Seymour that he had no sooner escaped from the fangs of Prybabel\r\nthan he encountered _Polyphemus_. Our readers may, perhaps, wonder who\r\nthis _Polyphemus_ could have been; we must, therefore, inform them that\r\nMr. Twaddleton, whose ideas were always tinctured with classical\r\ncolouring, had bestowed this appellation upon the renowned Dr. Doseall,\r\nthe Esculapius of Overton, because, as he said, his practice was like\r\nthe Cyclops, _strong but blind_; and Mr. Seymour declared that the\r\nsimilitude was even more perfect than the vicar had contemplated, for\r\nhe observed that he certainly fattened upon the unhappy victims who\r\nfell within his clutches.\r\n\r\nWith all our respect for the liberality of Mr. Seymour and the\r\nkind-heartedness of the vicar, we must, in justice to this respectable\r\nson of Apollo, express our disapprobation at so unprovoked a sarcasm.\r\nWe acknowledge that Dr. Doseall, by the aid of low bows and high\r\ncharges--of little ailments and large potions, had contrived to secure\r\na very comfortable balance on the creditor side of his worldly ledger.\r\nWe also admit, that after the example of other celebrated physicians,\r\nhe had one sovereign remedy, which he administered in every disease.\r\nBut what of that? he was often successful in his cures--that is to say,\r\nhis patients sometimes recovered _after_ they had taken his physic; and\r\nis not that the test conventionally received in proof of the skill or\r\nignorance of greater physicians than Dr. Doseall? Nor can we persuade\r\nourselves into the belief, that a doctor who faithfully adheres to one\r\nsingle remedy, is less likely to be right than those restless spirits\r\nwho are eternally coquetting with all the preparations of the\r\nPharmacopœia without ever remaining steady to any one of them. It has\r\nbeen truly remarked, that the clock which stands still and points\r\nsteadfastly in one direction, is certain of being right twice in the\r\ntwenty-four hours, while others may keep going continually, and as\r\ncontinually going wrong. Being ourselves no doctors, we merely throw\r\nout this hint for the consideration of those who are learned in such\r\nmatters: but we beg pardon of our readers for this digression.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mr. Seymour, “I am, at all events, rejoiced to see our\r\nTrojan in safety, after such perilous adventures; and I hope that he is\r\nnow prepared to set sail again with us, on a new voyage of discovery. I\r\nhave been engaged,” continued he, “in explaining still farther the\r\nnature of momentum, and I now propose to exhibit an experiment of a\r\ndifferent kind, in order to illustrate the same subject. You, no doubt,\r\nremember,” continued Mr. Seymour, “that velocity makes up for weight:\r\nalthough, therefore, a fluid, as air, or water, may, in a state of\r\nquiescence, be unable to support a body, yet, by giving it a certain\r\nvelocity, it may acquire a sustaining power. I have here several gilded\r\npith-balls, through one of which I have run two pins, at right angles\r\nto each other: the naked points, you perceive, are defended with\r\nsealing-wax, to prevent any mischief that might arise from their\r\naccidentally coming into contact with your face. By means of this brass\r\ntube, (the stem of a tobacco-pipe will answer the same purpose,) I\r\nshall produce a current of air by my breath, and you will observe that\r\nthe little ball will continue to dance, as if unsupported.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then placed the pith-ball at the end of the pipe, and,\r\ninserting its other extremity in his mouth, blew out the ball, which\r\nimmediately rose in the air, and continued to float about for several\r\nseconds: he then drew in his breath, and caught it with much address on\r\none of its points; and in this manner, alternately floating and\r\ncatching it, did he continue to delight the wondering group for several\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nTom received the tube and ball from the hand of his father, and soon\r\nsucceeded in playing with it. Observe, gentle reader, the address with\r\nwhich the boy manages it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom keeping the pith-ball aloft by blowing into the\r\ntube.]\r\n\r\n“This reminds me of my pea-shooter,” said Tom, as he removed the tube\r\nfrom his mouth, “with which I have often shot a pea across the\r\nplay-ground.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; and you will now understand the nature of the force by which\r\nyour pea was projected. The air blown from the lungs, gains such\r\nmomentum from the contracted channel in which it flows, as to impart\r\nconsiderable velocity to the pea placed within the influence of its\r\ncurrent.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Seymour observed, that she had lately read in Waterton’s\r\n“Wanderings in South America,” a very interesting account of the Indian\r\nblow-pipe, which the natives of Guiana employ as an engine for\r\nprojecting their poisoned arrows, and which owes its power to the\r\nprinciple of which Mr. Seymour had just spoken, and its unerring\r\naccuracy to the skilful address of the Indian who uses it.(10)\r\n\r\n“Mr. Seymour,” said the vicar, “I much like your experiment with the\r\npith-balls; but do tell me the use of the pins that are passed through\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“They are not absolutely necessary for the success of the experiment:\r\nindeed, I ought to have stated, that their only use is to ensure the\r\nelevation of the ball to a certain distance above the orifice of the\r\ntube, before it is set adrift.”\r\n\r\n“‘_Ne turbata volent rapidis ludibria ventis_,’ as Virgil has it. I\r\nduly appreciate the contrivance; but if the ball was set off at a\r\ndistance from the orifice, such an expedient would be unnecessary.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered Mr. Seymour; “I will soon convince you that,\r\nunder the condition you propose, the pins are not essential.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he placed the tube in his mouth, and by carefully holding\r\nthe ball at a distance of about half an inch from its orifice, he was\r\nenabled to consign it at once to a continuous and steady stream of air,\r\nwhich can never be commanded at the point from which the air issues;\r\nand he thus succeeded in sustaining the ball in motion, in the same\r\nmanner as he did in the preceding experiment.\r\n\r\n“We will now proceed to the orchard,” said Mr. Seymour, “where I have\r\nprepared another pleasing exhibition of a similar description.”\r\n\r\nThe party accordingly left the Lodge, and when they had arrived at the\r\nfountain, their father produced a small wooden figure, of which the\r\nannexed is a sketch. Within its base was fixed a hollow sphere, or ball\r\nof thin copper, which, when properly adjusted on a fountain, or _jet\r\nd’eau_, was sustained by the momentum produced by the velocity of the\r\nstream; so that the whole figure was balanced, and made to dance on the\r\nfountain, as the pith-ball had been made to play in the current of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Man sitting at the top of a fountain’s stream of water.]\r\n\r\nThe children were much gratified at witnessing so curious an\r\nexhibition. Mr. Twaddleton laughed heartily at the ludicrous effect it\r\nproduced, and observed that, although he had never before seen the\r\nexperiment, he had frequently heard of it; and he added, that he\r\nunderstood it to be a very common toy in Germany and Holland.\r\n\r\n“I have for some time,” said Mrs. Seymour, “been trying to construct a\r\nlight figure of this kind, which shall dance on a current of air; and I\r\nbelieve I have at length succeeded. The head I have formed of the seed\r\nvessel of the _Antirrhinum_, which has a striking resemblance to a\r\nface, and possesses, moreover, the indispensable condition of\r\nlightness. The dress is made of silver paper, stretched over a cone of\r\nthe same material. From its appearance I have named it the _Flying\r\nWitch_.”\r\n\r\n“I admire your ingenuity,” said Mr. Seymour, “and I have no reason to\r\ndoubt the success of your enterprise.”\r\n\r\n“I found it convenient,” continued Mrs. Seymour, “to place a stage of\r\ncard below the orifice of the tube, in order to steady the figure as\r\nshe rises, and to receive her as she falls.”\r\n\r\n“Your principal care,” observed her husband, “must be to throw the\r\ncentre of gravity of the figure as low as possible.”\r\n\r\nOn the party returning to the library, Mr. Seymour expressed a wish\r\nthat, before they suspended their morning’s recreations, they should\r\ntake into consideration a peculiar property of matter, which they had\r\nnot yet discussed.\r\n\r\n“And what may that be?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“ELASTICITY,” replied her father; “and I wish to hear whether Tom can\r\nexplain to us the meaning of the term.”\r\n\r\nTom very well knew what was meant by Elasticity; but he was like many a\r\nmerchant with a bill of exchange, who, although well acquainted with\r\nits value, has not sufficient small change to cash it. Tom wanted words\r\nto enable him to furnish a clear definition; his father, therefore,\r\nkindly relieved his embarrassment, by informing him that “it was a\r\nproperty inherent in certain bodies, by which they possessed a\r\ndisposition to have their form altered by force or pressure, and to\r\nrecover it on the removal of that pressure, throwing off the striking\r\nbody with some degree of force: for example,” continued he, “the cane\r\nwhich I hold in my hand can be bent to a certain extent, and then, if I\r\nlet it go, it will immediately return to its former condition with\r\nconsiderable force.”\r\n\r\nLouisa inquired whether bending and pressing upon a body were the same\r\nthing. Mr. Seymour replied, that the form of an elastic body might be\r\naltered either by compression or distension, and that _bending_ was, in\r\nfact, only a combination of these two methods; “For,” said he, “when a\r\nstraight body, like my cane, is bent, those particles of it which are\r\non the one side are compressed, while those on the other are distended.\r\nBut let us proceed with the subject. I have said that elastic bodies,\r\non returning to their original form, throw off the striking body with\r\nsome degree of force. I have here,” continued Mr. Seymour, taking out\r\nof his pocket a wooden image of a cat, “a toy which I intend as a gift\r\nto John; it will serve to illustrate our subject. The tail, you\r\nperceive is movable, one of its ends being tied to a piece of catgut,\r\nwhich is a highly elastic substance. When I bend the tail under the\r\nbody of the animal, I necessarily twist the string; and by pressing the\r\nother end of the wooden tail upon a piece of wax, I can retain it for a\r\nfew seconds in that situation.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour having fixed the tail in the manner above described, placed\r\nthe wooden image on the ground, when, in a few seconds, it suddenly\r\nsprang forward, to the great delight of the younger children.\r\n\r\n“Can you explain this action?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“The wax,” answered Tom, “was incapable of holding the end of the tail\r\nlonger than a few seconds; and as soon as it was let loose, the\r\nelasticity of the catgut enabled it to return to its former condition;\r\nin doing which the tail struck with force against the ground, which\r\nthrew off the body of the cat and produced the leap.”\r\n\r\n“Very well explained; and you, no doubt, will readily perceive that the\r\noperation of steel springs depends upon the same principle of\r\nelasticity: a piece of wire or steel, coiled up, may be made to set a\r\nmachine in motion by the endeavour it makes to unbend itself. This is\r\nthe principle of the spring in a watch. When our watches are what is\r\ntermed _down_, this steel has uncoiled itself; and the operation of\r\nwinding them up, is nothing more than that of bending it again for\r\naction.(11) If the elasticity of a body be _perfect_,” added Mr.\r\nSeymour, “it will restore itself with a force equal to that with which\r\nit was compressed. As I have given John a toy, it is but fair that I\r\nshould reward you, Tom: open that box, and examine the gift which it\r\ncontains.”\r\n\r\nTom received the present from his father, and proceeded to open the\r\nlid, when, to his great astonishment, the figure of an old witch\r\nsuddenly sprang upwards. Mr. Seymour explained its mechanism, by\r\nstating “that the figure contained a wire coiled up like a corkscrew,\r\nand which, upon the removal of the pressure of the lid which confined\r\nit, immediately regained its original form.”(12)\r\n\r\nTom inquired what kind of bodies was most elastic. He was informed that\r\nthe air was the most elastic of all known substances, and had, for that\r\nreason, been distinguished by the name of an _elastic_ fluid. Hard\r\nbodies were so in the next degree; while soft substances which easily\r\nretain impressions, such as clay, wax, &c. might be considered as\r\npossessing but little elasticity.\r\n\r\n“I should have thought,” said Louisa, “that neither clay nor wax had\r\npossessed _any_ elasticity.”\r\n\r\n“My love, we know not any bodies that are absolutely, or perfectly,\r\neither hard, soft, or elastic; since all partake of these properties,\r\nmore or less, in some intermediate degree. Liquids are certainly the\r\nleast elastic of all bodies; and, until lately, water was regarded as\r\nbeing perfectly inelastic;[12] but recent experiments have shown it\r\ncapable of compression, and of restoring itself to its original bulk,\r\nas soon as the pressure is removed; it must, therefore, possess some\r\nelasticity. Indeed,” said Mr. Seymour, “we might have anticipated such\r\na result from the effects which present themselves in the well-known\r\ngame of ‘_Ricochet_,’ or _Duck and Drake_.”\r\n\r\n“_Duck and Drake!_” exclaimed Louisa; “for goodness’ sake, what can\r\nthat game be?”\r\n\r\n“I dare say your brother will not have any difficulty in explaining it\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nTom informed her that it was a game in which any number of boys threw a\r\nstone, or a flat piece of tile, into the water; and that he whose stone\r\nrebounded the greatest number of times was the conqueror.\r\n\r\n“It is a very ancient game,” said Mr. Seymour, “and had the vicar been\r\npresent, we should have heard a learned disquisition upon it; as he,\r\nhowever, is unfortunately absent, I must tell you all I know upon the\r\nsubject. It was called by the Greeks _Epostrakismos_,[13] and was\r\nanciently played with flat shells. Now it is evident that the water\r\nmust possess some degree of elasticity, or the stone could not\r\nrebound(13); but I shall have occasion to revert to the subject\r\nhereafter.”\r\n\r\n“And are my marbles elastic?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly; but not to the same extent as your ball. There,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour, throwing his ball against the wall, “see how it rebounds.”\r\n\r\n“The return of the ball,” observed Tom, “was, I suppose, owing to its\r\nelasticity; and I now understand why one filled with air rebounds so\r\nmuch better than one stuffed with bran or wool.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right; and the return of the ball, after having struck\r\nthe wall, affords an example of what is termed _reflected_ motion, upon\r\nwhich I shall have to remark when we come to the interesting subject of\r\n‘Compound Forces;’ but at present, my only wish is to render the\r\nproperty of elasticity intelligible to you. It is a force of very\r\nextensive application; there is scarcely a machine wherein the\r\nelasticity of one or more solids is not essentially concerned. Nature,\r\nalso, avails herself of this property to accomplish many of her\r\npurposes. Fleas and locusts are enabled to jump two hundred times the\r\nheight of their own bodies by means of a springy membrane, easily\r\nvisible by a microscope; so that, supposing the same relative force to\r\nbe infused into the body of a man six feet high, he would be enabled to\r\nleap three times the height of St. Paul’s: and the regular dispersion\r\nand sowing of the seeds of several plants is effected by a spring,\r\nwhich is wound sometimes round the outside, and at others, round the\r\ninside, of the case in which the seeds are contained.”(14)\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Tom, “that it is by some such spring shrimps are\r\nenabled to leap to the tops of cataracts, as I have read in my work on\r\nNatural History.”\r\n\r\n“Many species of fish are thus enabled to leap, by bending their bodies\r\nstrongly, and then suddenly unbending them with an elastic spring; and\r\nthe long-tailed crayfish, and the common shrimp, leap by extending\r\ntheir tails, after they have been bent under their bodies:--but the\r\nmost striking example of this kind is the leap of the salmon; just\r\nunder the cataract, and against the stream, he will rush for some\r\nyards, and rise out of the spray six or eight feet; and, amidst the\r\nnoise of the water, he may be heard striking against the rock with a\r\nsound like the clapping of hands; if he find a temporary lodgment on\r\nthe shelving rock, he will lie quivering and preparing for another\r\nsummerset, until he reaches the top of the cataract; thus at once\r\nexhibiting the elasticity of his bones and the power of his muscles.”\r\n\r\n“We will now conclude our diversions,” said Mr. Seymour, “with an\r\nexhibition of a very striking description. Here,” cried he, as he\r\nremoved a small piece of apparatus from a box which stood on the table,\r\n“is a toy, at which the sternest philosopher, nay, even Heraclitus, of\r\nweeping memory, could not refrain from laughing.”\r\n\r\nHe then displayed a small ball of Indian rubber, on which was painted\r\nan exact resemblance of the worthy vicar, executed under the direction\r\nof Mr. Seymour, by that inimitable artist, George Cruikshank. The ball\r\nwas connected with an air syringe, by which it was easily distended. It\r\ngradually increased in magnitude, swelling, like the gourd of Jonah, as\r\nthe inflation proceeded, and the countenance of the vicar progressively\r\nenlarged to the size of the full moon, without the least alteration in\r\nthe character or expression of its features.\r\n\r\n“I declare,” said Mr. Seymour, “the vicar _improves upon acquaintance_.”\r\n\r\n“It must be acknowledged that you have _puffed_ him into consequence,”\r\nobserved Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\nThe countenance had, after a short time, swelled to ten times its\r\noriginal dimensions: the children deafened Mr. Seymour with their\r\nshouts, and the good-humoured clergyman was actually convulsed with\r\nlaughter. The stop-cock was now turned; the elastic bladder became\r\nsmaller and smaller, and the features underwent a corresponding\r\ndiminution, until they once again assumed their original dimensions.\r\n\r\n“You perceive, my dear Sir, that I make you _look small_ again.”\r\n\r\n“That is by no means an unusual effect of your jokes,” replied the\r\nvicar.\r\n\r\n“Now, Tom,” said his father, “it is for you to explain the nature of\r\nthe exhibition you have just witnessed.”\r\n\r\nTom proceeded accordingly.\r\n\r\n“The bladder was highly elastic, and therefore readily yielded to the\r\npressure of the air, and became distended. As soon, however, as the\r\npressure was removed, the air was driven out again with force, and the\r\nparticles of the Indian rubber returned to their former condition. But\r\nI observed one circumstance which I do not understand,” said Tom: “when\r\nyou first turned the stop-cock, the air rushed out with great violence,\r\nand the ball diminished very rapidly; but it gradually slackened,\r\nuntil, at last, the bladder could scarcely be seen to contract.”\r\n\r\n“I rejoice to find that you were so observant,” said his father: “the\r\neffect you noticed depended upon a general law of elasticity. Elastic\r\nbodies, in the recovery of their forms from a state of compression,\r\nafter the removal of the compressing force, exert a greater power at\r\nfirst than at last, so that the whole progress of restoration is a\r\n_retarded_ motion.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar, who had listened with profound attention to the explanation\r\nwhich the boy had offered, rushed forward at its conclusion, and\r\nclasping him in his arms, declared, that a first-class man of Trinity\r\ncould not have succeeded better.\r\n\r\n“But let us now, if you please, Mr. Seymour, suspend our researches:\r\nrecollect,” said the vicar, “that your birds are, as yet, scarcely\r\nfledged; and they will, therefore, make greater advances by short\r\nflights frequently repeated, than by uninterrupted progression.”\r\n\r\nWe heartily concur in this opinion, and shall, therefore, terminate the\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Upon this subject, Dr. Brewster’s Introductory Letter on Natural\r\n  Magic will be read with interest and advantage.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  The comparative inelasticity of water will be shown hereafter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  Pollux, lib. ix. c. 7.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n _The arrival of Major Snapwell, and the bustle it occasioned.--The\r\n    Vicar’s interview with the stranger.--A curious discussion.--A\r\n    word or two addressed to Fox-hunters.--Verbal corruptions.--Some\r\n    geometrical definitions.--An enigma._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the ladies of Overton were regaling themselves with a sociable dish\r\nof tea and chat, the conversation was abruptly interrupted by the\r\nappearance of a chariot-and-four, that passed along the road with\r\nluxurious speed, and which, as Miss Kitty Ryland declared, announced,\r\nby the dignified suavity of its roll, that the personage it conveyed\r\nmust be of superior rank.\r\n\r\n“Those,” exclaimed she, “who cannot at once distinguish such\r\n‘spirit-stirring’ sounds from the discordant rattle of a plebeian\r\nchaise, deserve to wear the ears of Midas.”\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary subtlety of Miss Ryland’s ears is said to have been\r\nconferred upon them by those universal promoters of bodily vigour,\r\n_air_ and _exercise_, of which they had received the combined advantage\r\nby the ingenious habit of listening to whispers through a certain\r\npneumatic apparatus, familiarly termed a _key-hole_. In farther proof\r\nof the fidelity and alertness of her auditory establishment, we may\r\njust state, that, on passing Doseall’s shop, she never failed to\r\ndistinguish, by the sound of the mortar, whether the medicines under\r\npreparation were designed for the stomachs of the rich or the poor. The\r\nvicar even admitted the correctness of her discrimination, for he had\r\nhimself observed that the pestle beat _dactyls_ in one case, and\r\n_spondees_ in the other.\r\n\r\nWhile the carriage was passing the window, the maiden companions were\r\nbreathless with wonder, each catching a glance from the countenance of\r\nher neighbour, which heightened, as it were, by reflection, the\r\nsurprise depicted on her own.\r\n\r\n“Overton,” exclaimed Miss Noodleton, “is doubtless by this time\r\nhonoured by the arrival of some distinguished stranger; but who he is,\r\nor what may be the object of his visit, I am at a loss to divine.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” cried Miss Puttle; “what a fuss is here about a green carriage\r\nand four hack horses! I doubt not but that it has conveyed some visitor\r\nto the vicar: had the Seymours expected any company, I must have heard\r\nof it yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“To the vicar!” exclaimed Miss Phillis Tapps; “and pray, Miss Puttle,\r\nallow me to ask whether you ever heard of the peacock nestling with the\r\ncrow?”\r\n\r\n“Or of the eagle taking up its abode in an ivy-bush?” vociferated Miss\r\nRyland.\r\n\r\nConjectures were vain, and the party determined to resolve itself into\r\na committee of inquiry. In the first place, it was judged expedient to\r\nsee and question Ralph Spindle, whom Dr. Doseall employed on the\r\narrival of a stranger, as certain insects are said to use their\r\n‘_feelers_’ to discover the approach of any prey that may serve them as\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was soon discovered to be a Major Snapwell, a rich and\r\neccentric old bachelor, who had served in various campaigns in\r\ndifferent parts of the globe, and received a competent number of\r\nwounds, in the defence of his king and country. His income was reported\r\nto be large, and it was said, that he had not any near relative to\r\nenjoy the reversion, since his nephew had perished about two years\r\nbefore by shipwreck. The circumstances that led to this disastrous\r\nevent were believed to have so affected the veteran, as to have\r\noccasioned a very serious illness, and a consequent state of\r\ndespondency, for which his physicians advised a constant change of\r\nscene; so that he had been rambling about the Continent during the last\r\nyear and a half, accompanied only by his faithful servant, Jacob\r\nWatson, who was as much attached to the Major, as was ever a\r\nNewfoundland dog to his master.\r\n\r\nSuch was the information derived from Annette, the vicar’s housekeeper:\r\nwhat proportion of fiction was mingled with its truth, the reader will\r\nprobably soon be able to discover.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jacob,” said the Major, as his trusty but asthmatic valet was\r\nleisurely buttoning on the long gaiters of his master the morning after\r\nhis arrival, “what do you hear about this village of Overton? Are there\r\nany sociable neighbours? I like the country; it is beautiful, Jacob,\r\nand the air appears mild: it promises to be the very place to kindle\r\nthe sparks of my expiring constitution; and should you, at the same\r\ntime, get your broken-winded bellows mended, my vital flame might,\r\nperhaps, burn a little brighter. But tell me, what do you hear of it,\r\nJacob?”\r\n\r\n“Why, and please you, Major, I just now met an old crony of mine, Mrs.\r\nAnnette Brown, at the Devil and the Bag of Nails----”\r\n\r\n“And pray, Jacob,” exclaimed the Major, “who taught you to speak thus\r\nirreverently of the village blacksmith?”\r\n\r\n“The village blacksmith! Lord love you, it is the sign of the village\r\nalehouse!”\r\n\r\n“Then it is a very odd one; but go on with your story.”\r\n\r\n“As I was saying, Major, I met an old acquaintance who is housekeeper\r\nto Mr. Twaddleton, a bachelor gentleman, and the vicar of the parish.\r\nShe tells me her master is downright adored in the place: though he\r\nmust needs be a queer mortal, for she says he is so fond of _antics_\r\nthat he won’t suffer a mop or broom in his house, lest, I suppose, it\r\nshould spoil the hopping of the fleas, and put an end to the fly’s\r\nrope-dance upon a cobweb.”\r\n\r\n“Jacob, Jacob, you are a wag, and had better go and offer your\r\nservices to this merry parson; although, I fear, your asthmatic pipes\r\nwould prove but a sorry accompaniment to his capering. But\r\npshaw!--fiddlestick!--stuff and nonsense!--who ever heard of a vicar\r\nbeing fond of antics!--you are imposed upon, Jacob.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure that how Annette told me as much. Ay, and she said he had\r\nall sorts of _curiosities_ in his parlour--such as grinning faces, dogs\r\nwith three heads, rusty swords, and I do not know what besides.”\r\n\r\n“I see it!--see it all plainly!” exclaimed the Major; “and your story\r\nhas so delighted me that I could almost dance myself.” This respectable\r\nclergyman, thought he, is, doubtless, an antiquary, a virtuoso--what a\r\ndelightful companion will he prove! And a bachelor like myself!--what\r\n_tête-à-têtes_ do I anticipate!\r\n\r\n“Jacob,” exclaimed the Major, “you should have said that the vicar was\r\nfond of, or, to speak more correctly, devoted to _antiques_, not to\r\n_antics_. But, tell me whether there are any other agreeable persons in\r\nthis village?”\r\n\r\n“There’s the squire and his family,” answered the valet.\r\n\r\n“The name, the name, Jacob?”\r\n\r\n“Squire Seymour, and please you, Major.”\r\n\r\n“Seymour, Seymour!” repeated the Major; “I seem to know that name--let\r\nme remember.”\r\n\r\nThe Major’s cogitations, however, were abruptly cut short by the\r\nentrance of the servant-maid, who informed him that Mr. Vicar\r\nTwaddleton had called.\r\n\r\n“I beg that Mr. Twaddleton may be admitted.--Jacob, place a chair.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Twaddleton,” said the Major, as he advanced towards the door to\r\nmeet his visitor, “I feel obliged and honoured by your kind attention.\r\nAs a perfect stranger, I could scarcely have expected this civility;\r\nbut your village, surrounded as it is by all the softer charms of\r\nNature, is calculated to impress the hearts of its inhabitants with a\r\nkindred amenity. The inhabitants are, doubtless, much attached to their\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n“Proverbially so: never was Ulysses more attached to his Ithaca! Allow\r\nme, also, to say that we all rejoice at the arrival of visitors; and,\r\nas vicar of the parish of Overton, I should consider myself criminally\r\ndeficient in my duty were I to suffer a respectable stranger to depart\r\nfrom us without his having received the mark of my respect, and the\r\ntender of my humble but cordial hospitality. I am an old-fashioned\r\nperson, Major Snapwell, and am well aware that these antiquated notions\r\ndo not altogether accord with the cold and studied forms of the present\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Twaddleton,” exclaimed the delighted Major, “I thank thee, most\r\nheartily thank thee, in the name of all those whose hearts have not yet\r\nbeen benumbed by worldly indifference. Sit thee down--I abhor\r\nceremony--and let me beg of you not to take offence at a question to\r\nwhich I am most anxious you should give me an answer. Are you, my dear\r\nSir, as I have just reasons for supposing, an ANTIQUARY?”\r\n\r\n“I am undoubtedly attached to pursuits which might have favoured such a\r\nreport.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so; I guessed as much. Then give me your hand; we must be\r\nfriends and associates. If there be a pursuit on earth to which I am\r\ndevotedly attached, it is to that of antiquities; and, let me add,”\r\ncontinued the Major with increasing animation, for, like bottled beer,\r\nhe was the brisker for warmth, “that if there be a literary character\r\nto whom the professor of arms ought to feel superior gratitude, it is\r\nto the antiquary. How many victories, what valiant deeds, must have\r\nperished in the memory of mankind but for the kind offices of the\r\nvirtuoso! under whose vivifying touch the laurels of the victor have\r\nbloomed with renovated vigour! and when the scythe of Time has left\r\nthem to wither, and to be scattered on the wings of the wind, he\r\ncollects their remains, and piously deposits them in a splendid\r\nmausoleum, in order to preserve them to the latest posterity!”\r\n\r\nIt were difficult to say, whether astonishment at the Major’s warmth,\r\ndelight at the congenial sentiments he had expressed, or admiration at\r\nthe language in which they had been conveyed, was the feeling\r\npredominant in the vicar’s mind, nor do we deem it necessary to\r\ninquire; suffice it to say, that, from the conversation of a few\r\nminutes, these two gentlemen felt incited to a mutual regard by\r\nsympathy and congeniality of soul; so true is it that, while we may be\r\nstrangers with the companions of years, we may become friends with the\r\nstrangers of yesterday!\r\n\r\n“Major Snapwell,” said the vicar, “I may truly mark this day in the\r\ndiary of my life in red letters; your society will add to my happiness,\r\nby extending the sphere of my literary intercourse. When may I expect\r\nthe pleasure of your company at the vicarage? I am really impatient to\r\nshow you my coins and a few dainty morsels of _virtù_.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be at your service to-morrow,” answered the Major; “but I must\r\nnow say something about my plans, for it is possible that you may\r\nassist me in carrying them into execution.”\r\n\r\n“Command me,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“For my present purpose, it is only necessary to state, that I have a\r\nnephew whom I have adopted as my son; I superintended his education; he\r\narrived at manhood, and became an accomplished scholar and a polished\r\ngentleman. Naturally anxious to visit the ancient mistress of the\r\nworld, he readily obtained my approbation of his plan. He embarked at\r\nMarseilles; but, meeting with one of those treacherous gales so\r\ncharacteristic of the Mediterranean, he was shipwrecked in the bay of\r\nGenoa. For three years did I mourn him as dead, and it was only by a\r\ntrain of circumstances of the most extraordinary description that I at\r\nlength discovered him to be living. I will not now trouble you with the\r\ndetails of this most singular history; suffice it to say he is now\r\nwell, and about to be married to a young lady for whom he has long\r\nentertained the purest attachment. I am in search of a country\r\nresidence for them, and hearing that a Sir Thomas Sotherby, a resident,\r\nI understand, in your neighbourhood, is most desirous of disposing of\r\nOsterley Park, and offers many advantages to any one who will take it\r\noff his hands, and as I have both the inclination and the means to\r\nbecome its possessor, I have travelled hither for the purpose of\r\ninspecting it. So now you have my history.”\r\n\r\n“It is perfectly true,” said the vicar, “that Sir Thomas is willing to\r\nmake a considerable sacrifice in order to obtain an immediate\r\npurchaser. The health of her Ladyship is in so precarious a state that\r\nher physicians have ordered her to proceed, without delay, to Madeira.\r\nSir Thomas, Major, is a fox-hunter, and I will venture to say that no\r\none will miss him but the doctor and the foxes--the one will lose a\r\nprofitable friend, the other a relentless enemy--‘_Gaudet equis et\r\ncanibus_,’ as the poet has it.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! but I am no fox-hunter, and I therefore fear that, in the\r\nopinion of the country, Osterley Park will not exchange its proprietor\r\nto advantage. Pray, vicar, may I ask whether you are addicted to\r\nfield-sports?”\r\n\r\n“Addicted to field-sports!” repeated the reverend antiquary: “I am\r\nsurprised, mortified, absolutely shocked! I--I addicted to\r\nfield-sports!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Mr. Twaddleton,” observed the Major, “I am really sorry that I\r\nshould have unintentionally excited your indignation. I am not aware\r\nthat there is anything in the innocent pastime to which I have alluded\r\ninconsistent with your station and acquirements. As an antiquary, I\r\nneed hardly remind you that the fathers of the Church were amongst the\r\nkeenest sportsmen. Do you not remember the amusing portrait which\r\nChaucer has given us of a sporting monastic in the 14th century, and\r\nwhich, by the by, was the model from which Sir Walter Scott drew the\r\ncharacter of his Abbot in ‘Ivanhoe?’ Then again, need I call to your\r\nrecollection the fame of Walter, Archdeacon of Canterbury, who was\r\npromoted to the see of Rochester in 1147, and who is said not only to\r\nhave spent the whole of his time in hunting, but to have been as keen a\r\nsportsman at eighty as he was at twenty years of age? Then again, there\r\nwas Reginald Brian, translated to the see of Worcester in 1352; and\r\nWilliam de Clowne, whom his biographer celebrated as the most amiable\r\necclesiastic that ever filled the abbot’s throne of St. Mary in\r\nLeicestershire, the most knowing sportsman after a hare in the kingdom;\r\ninsomuch, indeed, that Richard II. and his son allowed him annual\r\npensions for his instructions in the art?”\r\n\r\n“Major Snapwell, antiquity can no more privilege error, than novelty\r\ncan prejudice truth,” exclaimed the vicar: “but, to be serious,”\r\ncontinued he, “I never could discover the principle upon which the\r\npleasure of this said diversion of Diana can depend; and yet I do\r\nassure you, sir, that I have not failed to submit the question to a\r\nlogical examination. Thus, for instance:--the fox emits from his body\r\ncertain odorous particles;--that is my _major_, and I say _concedo_:\r\nvery well; I proceed. The structure of the olfactory organs of the\r\ncanine species enables them to perceive this said odour: that is my\r\n_minor_, and I say again _concedo_. But I should much like to be\r\ninformed how any logician can defend the consequence which is deduced\r\nfrom these premises. To speak more syllogistically, why am I pleased to\r\nput my neck in jeopardy, _because_ my dogs happen to perceive a smell?”\r\n\r\nThe Major laughed heartily at the very ludicrous point of view in which\r\nthe worthy vicar had thought proper to represent the subject. Their\r\ndiscourse now took a different turn. The Major inquired what might be\r\nthe origin of the singular sign of the village inn--_The Devil and the\r\nBag of Nails?_ “Satan,” continued the Major, “is unquestionably the\r\npatron of the public-house; but why he should be represented as holding\r\nin his hand a bag of nails, I cannot divine, unless, indeed, in\r\nreference to the old adage, that ‘_Every glass of spirit is a nail in\r\nyour coffin._’”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha! ha! whimsical enough,” cried the vicar; “but, unfortunately,\r\nyour explanation is not the true one. The sign,” observed Mr.\r\nTwaddleton, “is not quite so uncommon as you seem to suppose; it was\r\noriginally ‘_Pan and his Bacchanals_,’ but, by a very natural\r\ntransition, the figure of the sylvan deity, which is certainly\r\nterrific[14] enough to sanction the mistake, has passed into that of\r\nthe evil tempter; while the word _Bacchanals_, by one of those verbal\r\ncorruptions so common in all languages, has been converted into the\r\n_bag of nails_.”\r\n\r\n“Very true,” said the Major; “whenever the vulgar are incapable of\r\nunderstanding the meaning of a word, they are sure to substitute for it\r\nsome one which has the nearest resemblance to it in sound, and which is\r\nmore familiar to them. I had but just now an excellent instance of this\r\nkind: my blundering servant Jacob insisted upon it that you were fond\r\nof _antics_; and before I left London, on sending him out to purchase a\r\n_Court Calendar_, what do you suppose he brought home?--a _Quart\r\nColander_!”\r\n\r\nThe vicar was much amused by the absurdity of the mistake.\r\n\r\n“I lately heard,” continued the Major, “of a Welsh squire, who, upon\r\nbeing questioned whether _Socinianism_ or _Arianism_ prevailed in his\r\ndistrict, replied, that he could not answer that question, but that he\r\nknew there had been a great deal of _Rheumatism_.”\r\n\r\nBut the good company of the Major and his newly acquired friend must\r\nnot detain us any longer from our duty. Mr. Seymour and his young\r\nfamily have reassembled in the library, and it is necessary that we\r\nshould immediately join them. Some of our readers may, perhaps, decline\r\naccompanying us upon this occasion; for the subject to be discussed,\r\nhowever necessary it may be, is certainly not so entertaining as many\r\nof those which have engaged our attention. If this be the case, they\r\nmay make a short cut, and join us again at the beginning of the\r\nfollowing chapter. The children had arranged themselves around the\r\ntable, when their father observed, that it would be necessary for their\r\nfuture progress, to devote an hour or two to the consideration of\r\nseveral mathematical figures and terms.\r\n\r\n“As to mathematical figures,” said Tom, “if you allude to squares,\r\ncircles, and figures of that description, and to parallel lines,\r\nangles, and so on, I can assure you that I am already well acquainted\r\nwith them; for the work you have given us on PAPYRO-PLASTICS[15] has\r\nfully instructed me in those particulars.”\r\n\r\n“If that be the case,” replied Mr. Seymour, “you will not have any\r\ndifficulty in answering my questions; but we must, nevertheless, go\r\nregularly through the subject, for the sake of your sisters, who may\r\nnot be equally proficient in this elementary part of geometry: tell me,\r\ntherefore, in the first place, what is meant by a _parallelogram_.”\r\n\r\n“A four-sided figure,” answered Tom.\r\n\r\n“That is true; but are there not some other conditions annexed to it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; its opposite sides are parallel.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you understand by the term _parallel_?”\r\n\r\n“Lines are said to be parallel,” said Tom, “when they are always at the\r\nsame distance from each other, and which, therefore, can never meet,\r\nthough ever so far continued.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right. What is a _square_?”\r\n\r\n“A four-sided figure, in which the sides are all equal, and its angles\r\nall right angles.”\r\n\r\n“Good again: but let me see whether you have a correct notion of the\r\nnature of an angle.”\r\n\r\n“An angle is the opening formed by two lines meeting in a point.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour here acknowledged himself perfectly satisfied with his\r\nson’s answers, and said, that he should accordingly direct his\r\nattention more particularly to Louisa and Fanny; and, taking his\r\npencil, he sketched the annexed figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Circle with two lines running through it.]\r\n\r\n“You perceive, Louisa,” said her father, “that the line A C makes two\r\nangles with the line B D, viz. the angle A C D and the angle A C B; and\r\nyou perceive that these two angles are equal to each other.”\r\n\r\n“How can they be equal?” cried Fanny, “for the lines are of very\r\ndifferent lengths.”\r\n\r\n“An angle, my dear girl, is not measured by the _length_ of the lines,\r\nbut by their _opening_.”\r\n\r\n“But surely,” said Louisa, “that amounts to the same thing: for the\r\nlonger the lines are, the greater must be the opening between them.”\r\n\r\n“Take the pair of compasses,” replied her father, “and describe a\r\ncircle around these angles, making the angular point C its centre.”\r\n\r\n“To what extent am I to open them?”\r\n\r\n“That is quite immaterial; you may draw your circle of any magnitude\r\nyou please, provided it cuts both the lines of the angles we are about\r\nto measure. All circles, of whatever dimensions, are supposed to be\r\ndivided into 360 parts, called _degrees_; the size, but not the number,\r\nof such degrees will therefore increase with the magnitude of the\r\ncircle. And since the opening of an angle is necessarily a portion of a\r\ncircle, it must embrace a certain number of degrees; and two angles\r\nare, accordingly, said to be equal, when they contain an equal number\r\nof them.”\r\n\r\n“Now I understand it,” said Louisa: “as the dimensions of an angle\r\ndepend upon the number of degrees contained between its lines, it\r\nevidently must be the _opening_, and not the _length_ of the lines,\r\nthat determines the measure of the angle.”\r\n\r\n“Say, rather, the _value_ of the angle, for that is the usual\r\nexpression: but I perceive you understand me; tell me, therefore, how\r\nmany degrees are contained in each of the two angles formed by one line\r\nfalling perpendicularly on another, as in the above figure.”\r\n\r\n“I perceive that the two angles together are just equal to half the\r\ncircle; and, since you say that the whole circle is divided into 360\r\ndegrees, each angle must measure 90 of them, or the two together make\r\nup 180.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right, and I beg you to remember, that an angle of 90\r\ndegrees, is called a _right_ angle, and that, when one line is\r\nperpendicular to another, it will always form, as you have just seen, a\r\nright angle on either side.”\r\n\r\n“I now understand,” said Louisa, “what is meant BY lines being at\r\n_right angles to each other_: But, papa,” continued she, “what are\r\n_obtuse_ and _acute_ angles, of which I have so often heard you speak?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. An acute (A) and an obtuse (B) angle.]\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour replied, that he could better explain their nature by a\r\ndrawing, than by any verbal description. “Here,” said he, “is an acute\r\nangle, A; and here an obtuse one, B: the former, you perceive, is one\r\nthat contains less than 90 degrees; the latter, one which contains\r\nmore, and is consequently greater than a right angle.”\r\n\r\nLouisa fully comprehended the explanation, and observed, that she\r\nshould remember, whenever an angle measured less than a _right_ angle,\r\nthat it was _acute_, and when more, _obtuse_. “But you have not yet\r\nexplained to me,” she continued, “the meaning of a _triangle_.”\r\n\r\n“That is a term denoting a figure of three sides, and angles. I dare\r\nsay Tom can describe the several kinds of triangles.”\r\n\r\nTom accordingly took the pencil, and drew a set of figures, of which\r\nthe annexed are faithful copies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Three triangles, labeled A, B, and C.]\r\n\r\n“A,” said he, “is an _Equi-lateral_ triangle; its three sides being all\r\nequal. B is a _Right-angled_ triangle, having one right angle. C\r\nrepresents an _Obtuse-angled_ triangle, it having one obtuse angle. An\r\n_Acute-angled_ triangle is one in which all the three angles are acute,\r\nas represented in figure A.”\r\n\r\n“As you have succeeded so well in your explanation of a triangle, let\r\nus see whether you can describe the nature of a circle.”\r\n\r\n“It is a round line, every part of which is equally distant from the\r\ncentre.”\r\n\r\n“And which round line,” said Mr. Seymour, “is frequently called the\r\n_circumference_. What is the diameter?”\r\n\r\n“A straight line drawn through the centre, and terminating in the\r\ncircumference on both sides.”\r\n\r\n“And an arc?” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Any portion of the circumference.”\r\n\r\n“Now let me ask you, what name is given to a line which joins any two\r\nopposite angles of a four-sided figure?”\r\n\r\n“The _diagonal_, papa.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right,” said Mr. Seymour; and, turning towards the\r\ngirls, he desired them to remember that term, as they would frequently\r\nhear it mentioned during their investigation into the nature of\r\n“Compound Forces.” “I really think,” continued their father, “that Tom\r\nis as capable of instructing you in these elementary principles as\r\nmyself; I shall, therefore, desire you, my dear boy, to conclude this\r\nlecture during my absence; remember, that by teaching others we always\r\ninstruct ourselves: but before I quit you, I will give you a riddle to\r\nsolve, for I well know that you all delight in an enigma.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed do we,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Pray let us hear it, papa,” cried Fanny.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then recited the following lines, which he had hastily\r\ncomposed; the point having, no doubt, been suggested on the instant, by\r\nthe remark he had just offered.\r\n\r\n         “Here’s a riddle for those who delight in their gold,\r\n         Which they p’rhaps may explain, when my story is told;\r\n         No treasure’s so precious, and yet those who gain me,\r\n         Though they give me away, will always retain me!\r\n         Indeed, if they wish to increase their rich store,\r\n         By giving away, they will only add more!!\r\n         To Fancy’s quick eye, in what forms have I risen,\r\n         And Poets declare that my birth was in heaven;\r\n         To some as a flame, as a stream, or a fountain,\r\n         To others I seem as a tower or mountain.\r\n         Should these hints not betray me, I only can say,\r\n         You do not possess me--I hope that you may.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” cried Tom, “what can that be, of which the more we give away,\r\nthe more we have left?”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” added Louisa, “and that we actually _increase_ the store, by\r\n_giving away_ a part of it!”\r\n\r\n“It is some word, I think,” observed Fanny; “do you not remember that\r\nmamma asked us what that was, from which we might take away _some_, and\r\nyet that the _whole_ would remain?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” cried Tom, “I remember it well; it was the word\r\n_wholesome_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour here assured them, that the enigma they had just heard, did\r\nnot depend upon any verbal quibble; and that as the object of its\r\nintroduction was to instruct, rather than to puzzle them, he would\r\nexplain it, and leave them to extract its moral, and profit by its\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n“It is KNOWLEDGE,” said he.\r\n\r\n“‘_No treasure’s so precious_,’” repeated Louisa; “certainly\r\nnone;--‘_and yet those who gain me, though they give me away, will\r\nalways retain me_;’--to be sure,” added she. “How could I have been so\r\nsimple as not to have guessed it? We can certainly impart all the\r\nknowledge we possess, and yet not lose any of it ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“By instructing others,” said Mr. Seymour, “we are certain, at the same\r\ntime, of instructing ourselves, and thus to increase our store of\r\nknowledge. Let this truth be impressed upon your memory, and, after our\r\nconversations, examine each other as to the knowledge you have gained\r\nby them: you will thus not only fix the facts more strongly in your\r\nrecollection, but you will acquire a facility of conversing in\r\nphilosophical language.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  To the terror-inspiring power of Pan we owe the word “_Panic_.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  “PAPYRO-PLASTICS,” or the Art of Modelling in Paper; from the German,\r\n  by Boileau, _London_, 1825. The Author strongly recommends this\r\n  interesting little work, as opening a new source of instructive\r\n  amusement. His own children have derived from it many hours of\r\n  rational recreation.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n _Compound Forces.--The Composition and Resolution of\r\n    Motion.--Rotatory Motion.--The Revolving Watch-glass.--The\r\n    Sling.--The Centrifugal and Centripetal Forces.--Theory of\r\n    Projectiles.--A Geological conversation between Mr. Seymour and\r\n    the Vicar._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, Mr. Seymour proceeded to explain the nature\r\nof “COMPOUND FORCES.” The young party having assembled as usual, their\r\nfather commenced his lecture by reminding his auditors, that the motion\r\nof a body actuated by a single force was always in a right line, and in\r\nthe direction in which it received the impulse.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say, papa, that a single force can never make a body\r\nmove round, or in a crooked direction; if so, how is it that my ball,\r\nor marble, will frequently run along the ground in a curved direction?\r\nIndeed, I always find it very difficult to make it go straight.”\r\n\r\n“Depend upon it, my dear, whenever the direction of a moving body\r\ndeviates from a straight line, it has been influenced by some second\r\nforce.”\r\n\r\n“Then I suppose that, whenever my marble runs in a curved line, there\r\nmust be some second force to make it do so.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly; the inequality of the ground may give it a new direction;\r\nwhich, when combined with the original force which it received from\r\nyour hand, will fully explain the irregularity of its course. It is to\r\nthe consideration of such compound motion that I am now desirous of\r\ndirecting your attention: the subject is termed the “COMPOSITION OF\r\nFORCES.” Here is a block of wood, with two strings, as you may\r\nperceive, affixed to it: do you take hold of one of these strings,\r\nLouisa; and you, Tom, of the other. That is right. Now place the block\r\nat one of the corners or _angles_ of the table: and while Tom draws it\r\nalong one of its sides, do you, Louisa, at the same time, draw it along\r\nthe other.”\r\n\r\nThe children obeyed their father’s directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A piece of wood with two strings attached to it, and two\r\nhands pulling the strings in diagonal directions.]\r\n\r\n“See!” said Mr. Seymour, “the block obeys neither of the strings, but\r\npicks out for itself a path which is intermediate. Can you tell me,\r\nTom, the exact direction which it takes?”\r\n\r\n“If we consider this table as a parallelogram, I should say, that the\r\nblock described the diagonal.”\r\n\r\n“Well said, my boy; the ablest mathematician could not have given a\r\nmore correct answer. The block was actuated by two forces at the same\r\ntime; and, since it could not move in two directions at once, it moved\r\nunder the _compound_ force, in a mean or diagonal direction,\r\nproportioned to the influence of the joint forces acting upon it. You\r\nwill, therefore, be pleased to remember, it is a general law, that\r\nwhere a body is actuated by two forces at the same time, whose\r\ndirections are inclined to each other, at any angle whatever, it will\r\nnot obey either of them, but move along the diagonal. In determining,\r\ntherefore, the course which a body will describe under the influence of\r\ntwo such forces, we have nothing more to do than to draw lines which\r\nshow the direction and quantity of the two forces, and then to complete\r\nthe parallelogram by parallel lines, and its diagonal will be the path\r\nof the body. I have here a diagram which may render the subject more\r\nintelligible. Suppose the ball B were, at the same moment, struck by\r\ntwo forces X and Y in the directions B A and B D. It is evident that\r\nthe ball would not obey either of such forces, but would move along the\r\noblique or diagonal line B C.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Force diagram for a ball moving in a diagonal\r\ndirection.]\r\n\r\n“But,” said Tom, “why have you drawn the line B D so much longer than\r\nB A?”\r\n\r\n“I am glad you have asked that question. Lines are intended, not only\r\nto represent the direction, but the _momenta_, or quantities of the\r\nforces: the line B D is, as you observe, twice as long as B A; it\r\nconsequently denotes that the force Y acting in the direction B D, is\r\ntwice as great as the force X acting in the direction B A. Having\r\nlearned the direction which the body will take when influenced by joint\r\nforces of this kind, can you tell me the relative time which it would\r\nrequire for the performance of its diagonal journey?”\r\n\r\nTom hesitated; and Mr. Seymour relieved his embarrassment by informing\r\nhim, that it would pass along the diagonal in exactly the same space of\r\ntime that it would have required to traverse either of the sides of the\r\nparallelogram, had but one force been applied. Thus, the ball B would\r\nreach C in the same time that the force X would have sent it to A, or\r\nthe force Y to D. “I will endeavour to prove this fact beyond all\r\ndoubt. It is, I think, evident, that the force which acts in the\r\ndirection B A can neither accelerate nor retard the approach of the\r\nbody to the line D C, which is parallel to it; hence it will arrive at\r\nC in the same time that it would have done had no motion been\r\ncommunicated to it in the direction B A. In like manner, the motion in\r\nthe direction B D can neither make the body approach to nor recede from\r\nA C; and it therefore follows, that, in consequence of the two motions,\r\nthe body will be found both in A C and C D, and will therefore be found\r\nin C, the point of intersection.”\r\n\r\nLouisa seemed to express by her looks the irksomeness of such\r\ndemonstrations; and which did not pass unobserved.\r\n\r\n“This may appear tedious and uninteresting,” said Mr. Seymour, “but the\r\ninformation is absolutely essential to our future progress: if you\r\nwould reap, you must sow.”\r\n\r\nTom and Louisa both expressed themselves willing to receive whatever\r\ninstruction their father might consider necessary; and they farther\r\ndeclared, that they understood the demonstration he had just offered\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Is it not then evident,” proceeded Mr. Seymour, “that the composition\r\nof forces must always be attended with loss of power; since the\r\ndiagonal of a parallelogram can never, under any circumstances, be\r\nequal to two of its sides? and is it not also evident, that the length\r\nof the diagonal must diminish as the angles of the sides increase: so\r\nthat the more acute the angle at which the forces act, the less must be\r\nthe loss by composition? But I shall be better able to explain this law\r\nby a diagram. If B A, A C be the sides of a parallelogram, representing\r\nthe direction of two forces, and A D the diagonal path of the body, is\r\nit not evident that the line A D will shorten as the angle B A C\r\nincreases?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Three parallelograms, beginning with a square\r\nand ending with a narrow diamond, all sharing one side.]\r\n\r\n“We see that at once,” cried Tom, “from the diagram before us.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. A square and a rectangle with a common diagonal.]\r\n\r\n“Then we will proceed to another fact connected with the same subject.\r\nLook at this diagram; is not the diagonal A D common to both the\r\nparallelograms inscribed about it, viz. of A B C D, and A E F D?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure it is.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is equally clear, that a body may be made to traverse the same\r\npath A D, by any pair of forces represented by the adjacent sides of\r\neither of such parallelograms.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“I request you to keep that fact in your recollection.”\r\n\r\n“I have now to inform you,” continued he, “that a single force may be\r\nresolved into any number of forces, and may, in fact, be regarded as\r\ncompounded of innumerable oblique ones. In order, however, to render\r\nthis fact more intelligible, I must refer you to fig. 6, from which it\r\nwill appear that the motion of a body, along the line A D, will be the\r\nsame whether it arise from one single force acting in that direction,\r\nor from two forces impressed upon it in the directions A B, A C, or in\r\nthose of A E, A F; and, consequently, although the motion may, in\r\nreality, be the effect of a single force, yet it may be considered as\r\ncompounded of two or more in other directions, since the very same\r\nmotion would arise from such a composition.”\r\n\r\nTom acknowledged the truth of this statement; and Mr. Seymour assured\r\nhim, that, when they came to play at ball and marbles, he should be\r\nable to give him a practical demonstration of the fact; for he would\r\nshow him, that whenever a body strikes a surface obliquely, or in an\r\ninclined direction, such a _resolution of force_ will actually take\r\nplace: “and now, Tom,” said his father, “give me a marble; for I wish\r\nto explain the reason why it turns round, or revolves on its axis, as\r\nit proceeds forward.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Tom, “it depends upon the action which I give to it\r\nby my thumb and finger when I shoot it out of my hand.”\r\n\r\n“You are, undoubtedly, capable of thus giving to your marble a certain\r\n_spinning_ motion, the effect of which we shall have to consider\r\nhereafter; but I fancy you would be greatly puzzled to make it proceed\r\nwithout revolving, give it what impulse you might by your hand.”\r\n\r\n“I have sometimes tried,” said Tom, “to make it do so by pushing it\r\nalong with a flat ruler, but it always _rolled_ in spite of me.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Diagram for marble’s motion.]\r\n\r\n“Then it is clear, from your own experiment, that its rotation cannot\r\narise from the cause you would assign to it. If you will attend to this\r\ndiagram,” continued his father, “I will endeavour to explain the\r\noperation. It is evident that, as the marble moves along the ground\r\nB D, the motion of the point B will be retarded by the resistance\r\noccasioned by its rubbing on the ground; while the point C, which does\r\nnot meet with any such resistance, is carried forward without\r\nopposition, and it consequently must move faster than the point B; but\r\nsince all the parts of the marble cohere or stick together, the point C\r\ncannot move faster than B, unless the marble revolves from C to E; and\r\nas the several points of the marble which are successively applied to\r\nthe floor are retarded in their motion, while the opposite points move\r\nfreely, the marble during its progressive motion must continue to\r\nrevolve.”\r\n\r\n“But you said, papa, that whenever a body moved in any direction,\r\nexcept that of a straight line, it must have been acted upon by more\r\nthan one force; and yet the marble not only runs along the ground, but\r\nturns round; at the same time, by the simple force of my hand.”\r\n\r\n“The revolution of the marble, my dear boy, is brought about by no less\r\nthan three forces: look attentively at the diagram, and you will easily\r\ncomprehend my explanation. There is, in the first place, the\r\nrectilinear motion given to it by your hand; then there is the friction\r\nof the ground: since, however, this latter acts in a contrary\r\ndirection, it merely tends to lessen or counteract the velocity with\r\nwhich the under-surface proceeds, and consequently to give a\r\nrelatively-increased progressive motion to its upper part; then comes\r\nthat force by which its several parts cohere, and which may be\r\nrepresented by C H; so that the two forces producing the revolution of\r\nthe point C, are justly expressed by the lines C G, C H: but these are\r\nin the direction of the two sides of a parallelogram, the point will\r\ntherefore move along the diagonal C E. I have here a toy for you, which\r\nwill serve to explain still farther the causes of rotation to which I\r\nhave alluded.” Mr. Seymour produced a watch-glass, in the hollow of\r\nwhich stood a dancing-figure of thin card, as here represented.\r\n[Illustration: Toy man standing on the flat part of a convex piece of\r\nglass.]\r\n\r\nHe placed it upon a black japanned waiter,[16] which he held in an\r\ninclined position, when it immediately slided down the inclined plane,\r\nas might have been expected. He next let fall a drop of water upon the\r\nwaiter, and placed the watch-glass in it. Under this new arrangement,\r\ninstead of sliding, the watch-glass began to revolve as soon as an\r\ninclination was given to the surface; and it continued to revolve with\r\nan accelerated velocity, obeying the inclination and position of the\r\nplane, as directed by the hand of the operator.\r\n\r\n“What a very pretty effect is produced by the rapid revolution of the\r\nfigure!” observed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Its use in the arrangement,” said her father, “is to render the\r\naccelerated motion more obvious.”\r\n\r\n“I perceive it revolves faster and faster, or, I suppose I ought to\r\nsay, with an accelerated velocity,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered Mr. Seymour; “whenever a force continues to act,\r\nthe motion produced by it must be accelerated for the reason already\r\ngiven you[17]--but let me explain the operation of the drop of water,\r\nwhich, as you have just seen, converted the sliding into the revolving\r\nmotion. In the first place, in consequence of the cohesion of the water\r\nto the two surfaces, a new force was introduced, by which an unequal\r\ndegree of resistance was imparted to different portions of that part of\r\nthe watch-glass in contact with the plane, and, consequently, in its\r\neffort to slide down, it necessarily revolved. Now, if you will\r\nattentively observe the change of figure which the drop of water\r\nundergoes during the revolution of the glass, you will perceive a\r\nspecies of vortex; a film of water, by capillary action, is drawn to\r\nthe foremost portion of the glass, while, by the centrifugal force, a\r\nbody of water is thrown under the hinder part of it; the effect of both\r\nthese actions is to accelerate the rotatory motion.\r\n\r\n“I shall now dismiss the subject for the present, but on some future\r\noccasion I shall probably revert to it; for it may be made to afford a\r\nsimple illustration of the rotatory and progressive motions of the\r\nearth round the sun; and it may also give us the means of producing\r\nsome optical effects of a very curious kind.”(15)\r\n\r\nMrs. Seymour here suggested that, as it was past one o’clock, the\r\nchildren should be dismissed to their more active sports in the garden.\r\n\r\n“We will instantly proceed to the lawn,” replied Mr. Seymour, “and Tom\r\nmay try his skill with the _sling_; an amusement which I have provided\r\nas a reward for his industry, and which will, at the same time, convey\r\nsome farther information concerning the nature of those forces we have\r\nbeen just considering. The sling,” continued his father, as he advanced\r\nupon the lawn, “consists, as you perceive, of a leathern thong,\r\nbroadest in the middle, and tapering off gradually towards both ends.\r\nTo each extremity is affixed a piece of string. I shall now place a\r\nstone in the broad part of the leather, and introduce my middle finger\r\ninto the loop formed in one of the strings, and hold the other\r\nextremity between my fore-finger and thumb.”\r\n\r\nHe then whirled it round, and when it had gained sufficient impetus, he\r\nlet go his hold of the string, and the stone instantly shot forth with\r\namazing velocity.\r\n\r\n“See! see! there it goes,” exclaimed Tom; “to what a height it\r\nascended!”\r\n\r\n“And to what a distance has it been projected!” observed Louisa, who\r\nhad attentively watched its descent.\r\n\r\n“Now, Tom,” said his father, “can you explain the operation you have\r\njust witnessed?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly, papa.”\r\n\r\n“Then attend to me. Have you not learned that circular motion is always\r\nthe result of two forces?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied Tom; “of one force which attracts it to the\r\ncentre around which it moves, and of another which impels it to move\r\noff in a right line.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; the former of these forces is, therefore, termed the\r\n_centripetal_, because it draws the body towards the centre, while the\r\nlatter is called the _centrifugal_ force, since its influence disposes\r\nthe body to fly off from the centre. In circular motion, these two\r\nforces constantly balance each other; otherwise it is evident that the\r\nrevolving body must either approach the centre or recede from it,\r\naccording as the one or the other prevailed. When I whirled round the\r\nsling, I imparted a projectile force to the stone, but it was prevented\r\nfrom flying off in consequence of the counteracting or _centripetal_\r\nforce of the string; but the moment I let go my hold of this, the stone\r\nflew off in a right line: having been released from confinement to the\r\nfixed or central point, it was acted upon by one force only, and motion\r\nproduced by a single force is, as you have just stated, always in a\r\nright line.”\r\n\r\n“But,” observed Louisa, “the stone did not proceed in a straight, but\r\nin a curved line: I watched its direction from the moment it left the\r\nsling till it fell to the ground.”\r\n\r\n“You are perfectly correct,” replied Mr. Seymour, “it described a\r\ncurve, which is called a _parabola_; but that was owing to the\r\ninfluence of a new force which came into play, viz. that of gravity,\r\nthe effect of which I shall have to explain hereafter.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand,” said Tom, “why the stone should not have fallen\r\nout of the sling when you whirled it round over your head.”\r\n\r\n“Because, my dear, it was acted upon by the _centrifugal_ force, which\r\ncounteracted that of gravity: but I will render this fact more evident,\r\nby a very simple and beautiful experiment. I have here a wine-glass,\r\naround the rim of which I shall attach a piece of string so as to\r\nenable me to whirl it round. I will now fill it with water, and\r\nalthough during one part of its revolution it will be actually\r\ninverted, you will find that I shall not spill a single drop of water.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then whirled round the glass, and the young party were\r\ndelighted with the confirmation thus afforded to their father’s\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Tom, “how it happened: when the glass was inverted the\r\nwater could not fall out, because it was influenced by the centrifugal\r\nforce which opposed gravity.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Have you ever observed what happens during the trundling of a\r\nmop? The threads which compose it fly off from the centre, but being\r\nconfined to it at one end they cannot part from it: while the water\r\nwhich they contain being unconfined, is thrown off in right lines.”\r\n\r\n“I have certainly observed what you state,” said Louisa; “the water\r\nflies off in all directions from the mop.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added Tom, “the water was not acted upon by the _centripetal_\r\nforce as the threads were, and consequently, there was nothing to check\r\nthe _centrifugal_ force, which carried the water off in a straight line\r\nfrom the centre.”\r\n\r\n“You are not quite correct,” said Mr. Seymour; “the water does not fly\r\noff in a right line from the centre, but in a right line in the\r\ndirection in which it was moving at the instant of its release; the\r\nline which a body will always describe under such circumstances, is\r\ncalled a _tangent_, because it _touches_ the circumference of the\r\ncircle, and forms a right-angle with a line drawn from that point of\r\nthe circumference to the centre: but I will render this subject more\r\nintelligible by a diagram.\r\n\r\n“Suppose a body, revolving in the circle, was liberated at _a_, it\r\nwould fly off in the direction _ab_; if at _c_, in that of _cd_; and if\r\nat _e_, in that of _ef_; and so on. Now, if you draw lines from these\r\nseveral points to the centre of the circle, you will perceive that such\r\nlines will form, in each case, a right-angle. In the experiment which\r\nyou have just witnessed, the surface of the water must have formed,\r\nduring its revolution, a right-angle with the string, and consequently\r\ncould not have fallen out of the wine-glass. A knowledge of this law,”\r\ncontinued Mr. Seymour, “will explain many appearances which, although\r\nfamiliar, I dare say, have never been understood by you. You may\r\nremember accompanying me to the pottery, to see the operation of the\r\nturning-lathe; it was owing to the centrifugal force produced by the\r\nrotation of the wheel, that the clay, under a gentle pressure, swelled\r\nout so regularly; from a similar cause, the flour is thrown out of the\r\nrevolving mill as fast as it is ground; and I shall presently show you\r\nthat you are indebted to this same force for the spinning of your top\r\nand the trundling of your hoop. But let us quit this subject for the\r\npresent, and pursue the stone in its course after it is liberated from\r\nthe sling. Louisa has justly observed that it described a curve; can\r\nyou explain why it should deviate from a straight line?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Diagram for centrifugal force.]\r\n\r\n“Let me see,” said Tom, thoughtfully; “it would be acted upon by two\r\nforces, one carrying it forward in a right line, the other bringing it\r\nto the earth; it would, therefore, not obey either, but describe a\r\ndiagonal: but why that diagonal should be a curve I cannot exactly\r\nexplain.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will give you the reason,” said his father. “A stone projected\r\ninto the air is acted upon by no less than three forces; the force of\r\nprojection, which is communicated to it by the hand or the sling; the\r\nresistance of the air through which it passes, and which diminishes its\r\nvelocity without changing its direction; and the force of gravity,\r\nwhich ultimately brings it to the ground. Now, since the power of\r\ngravity and the resistance of the air will always be greater than any\r\nforce of projection we can give a body, the latter must be gradually\r\novercome, and the body brought to the ground; but the stronger the\r\nprojectile force, the longer will those powers be in subduing it, and\r\nthe farther will the body go before it falls. A shot fired from a\r\ncannon, for instance, will go much farther than a stone thrown from\r\nyour hand. Had the two forces which acted upon the stone, viz. those of\r\nprojection and gravity, both produced uniform motion, the body must\r\ncertainly have descended through the diagonal; but since gravity, as\r\nyou have already learned, is an accelerating force, the body is made to\r\ndescribe a curve instead of a straight line.\r\n\r\n“This law, however, will require the aid of a diagram for its\r\nexplanation. Let X represent the ball at its greatest altitude, X Y the\r\nforce of gravity drawing it downward; and X Z that of projection. We\r\nhave here, then, two forces acting in the direction of the two sides of\r\na parallelogram. In passing on to Z, the ball will perform the diagonal\r\nX _a_; and in the next equal space of time, will descend through\r\n_three_ times the distance Z _a_, and will consequently be found at\r\n_b_; while in the next period it will fall through _five_ equal spaces,\r\nand pass to _c_; and in the next period, again, as it must fall _seven_\r\nsuch spaces, it will reach the ground at _d_, having described a\r\nportion of a curve from X to _d_, or during the time that the two\r\nforces were in simultaneous operation. The same principle will explain\r\nthe curved ascent of the ball, substituting only the laws of retarded\r\nfor those of accelerated motion; for it is clear, that the body during\r\nits _ascent_, will be retarded in the same degree in which it was\r\naccelerated during its _descent_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Diagram of a parabolic flight path.]\r\n\r\n“Your explanation,” said Louisa, “appears very clear and satisfactory.”\r\n\r\n“The curve which _Projectiles_ (that is to say, bodies projected into\r\nthe air) describe, is termed a _Parabola_ (16), although the resistance\r\nof the air, which is not recognised in the theory, produces a\r\nconsiderable influence on the practical result.”\r\n\r\nThe children now proceeded to amuse themselves with the sling. Louisa\r\nchallenged Tom to a trial of skill. She fancied that she could hurl a\r\nstone with greater accuracy than her brother; but after several\r\ncontests she acknowledged herself vanquished, for Tom had succeeded in\r\nstriking the trunk of an old tree at a considerable distance, while his\r\nsister was never able to throw the stone within several yards of the\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n“Well done, Tom!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour; “why you will soon equal in\r\nskill the ancient natives of the Balearic Islands!”\r\n\r\n“And were they famous for this art?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“With such dexterity,” replied her father, “did they use the sling,\r\nthat we are told their young children were not allowed any food by\r\ntheir mothers, except that which they could fling down from the beam\r\nwhere it was placed aloft. I fancy, however, Tom, that you would become\r\nvery hungry before you could strike an object in yonder poplar.”\r\n\r\n“At all events, I will try,” said Tom.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly whirled round his sling, and discharged stone, which\r\nflew forward with great velocity, but in a direction very wide from the\r\nmark at which it was aimed. In the next moment a violent hallooing was\r\nheard: it was from the vicar, who had narrowly escaped the boisterous\r\nsalutation of the falling stone, which, in its anxiety to throw itself\r\nat the feet of the reverend gentleman, struck the beaver penthouse that\r\ndefended his upper story, and by a resolution of forces which we have\r\nendeavoured to explain, darted off in the direction of the side of a\r\nparallelogram, and was thus averted from the equally sensitive\r\nantipodes of his venerable person, the brains in his head, and the\r\ncorns in his shoes.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, young gentleman!” cried the vicar, “I expected nothing\r\nless than the fate of the giant of Gath.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Twaddleton,” exclaimed Tom, in a tone of alarm, “I\r\nsincerely hope that you have not been struck?”\r\n\r\n“O no! thanks to my clerical helmet, I have escaped the danger which\r\nthreatened me: but, tell me, what new game is engaging your attention?”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour said that he had been explaining the scientific principle\r\nof the sling, and that he hoped the vicar was prepared to afford them\r\nsome information respecting its invention and history.\r\n\r\n“The sling?” repeated the vicar; “why, bless me! I left you discoursing\r\nupon elasticity; you really stride over province after province as\r\nrapidly as if you were gifted with the seven-leagued boots of the\r\nOgre:--but to the point in question. The art of slinging, or casting\r\nstones, is one of the highest antiquity, and was carried to a great\r\ndegree of perfection amongst the Asiatic nations. It was well known and\r\npractised at a very early period in Europe; and our Saxon ancestors\r\nappear to have been very expert in the use of this missile.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton, being desirous of communicating history of Major\r\nSnapwell, begged that Mr. and Mrs. Seymour would allow him a few\r\nminutes’ conversation; observing that the attention of the children\r\nwould be agreeably occupied during their absence by their\r\nnewly-acquired amusement.\r\n\r\n“We will then, if you please, vicar,” replied Mr. Seymour, “walk to the\r\nGeological Temple, where I have lately deposited some specimens which\r\nyou have not yet seen.”\r\n\r\n“To speak sincerely,” said the vicar, “I cannot participate in that\r\nhigh satisfaction which you appear to feel in collecting such hoards of\r\nbroken rocks and pebbles: where can lie the utility of such labour?\r\nunless, indeed, in pursuance of your Utopian plans, you intend to\r\n_Mac-adamise_ all the roads of science.”\r\n\r\n“Is it nothing, my dear Mr. Twaddleton, to discover the structure of\r\ndifferent countries?”\r\n\r\n“Which the geologist infers,” replied the vicar, “from a few\r\n_patterns_, picked up at random on the road side!”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Twaddleton,” said Mr. Seymour, “I will meet you on your own\r\nground: you are an antiquary; if an ancient monument of art be so\r\ninestimable, is not a knowledge of the antiquity of the globe itself,\r\nat least, of equal interest?”\r\n\r\n“I understand you: you would infer that the scriptural account of the\r\nDeluge is disproved by those Sciolists, who pretend to discover the\r\nantiquity of the globe by penetrating its caverns, with as much ease as\r\nthe jockey ascertains the age of a horse by looking into its jaws.”\r\n\r\n“You speak too flippantly of a class of philosophers who have united\r\ntheir efforts to investigate a sublime subject upon the true principles\r\nof science; were you to attend the meetings of the Geological Society,\r\nand hear the discussions of its members, you would cease to talk thus\r\nirreverently.”\r\n\r\n“Although I may be unknown to your genii of the mountains, I am, at\r\nall events, acquainted with a kindred class of philosophers who rival\r\nthem in industry, if not in talents; and notwithstanding the limited\r\nrange of their observations--being confined to the mountainous\r\ndistricts they inhabit--I have little doubt but that their labours\r\nhave proved as acceptable to the world as those of the disciples of\r\nHutton or Werner. I once visited this district, and although the\r\nlanguage of its inhabitants was entirely unknown to me, I soon\r\ndiscovered, by the aid of a glass, that they were in serious\r\ndiscourse with each other; and one of the elders of the fraternity,\r\nwho was seated on a craggy precipice that overhung an extensive\r\nvalley covered with rich verdure, appeared, from his gestures, as if\r\npointing out to his fellow-labourers, who were digging in all\r\ndirections in search of treasure, the danger of an approaching\r\nconvulsion. While I was yet gazing, the fatal catastrophe actually\r\noccurred; immense masses of the tottering strata rolled with\r\nprecipitous haste into the valley, involving in its ruin hundreds of\r\nits inhabitants. It was extraordinary to behold the effects of this\r\nshock upon those who were beyond the reach of its more destructive\r\ninfluence; hundreds were seen scaling heights that appeared\r\ninaccessible; others, stumbling--falling down frightful\r\nprecipices--rising again--helping, or pushing each other on--the\r\nforemost serving as so many stepping-stones to those behind, who, in\r\ntheir turn, hauled up the clusters over whose backs they had so\r\nunceremoniously vaulted.”\r\n\r\n“How awful!” cried Mrs. Seymour; “I never heard of any modern\r\ncatastrophe of such fearful extent: where did it occur?”\r\n\r\n“The vicar doubtless alludes to the terrible earthquake of Messina, or\r\nperhaps to that of Lisbon.”\r\n\r\n“I neither allude to the one nor to the other,” cried Mr. Twaddleton;\r\n“and yet, in some respects, the catastrophe which I have described\r\nresembled that of Lisbon; for during the dreadful disaster human beings\r\nseen to take advantage of the confusion to murder many of the\r\ninhabitants, and to pillage their territories.”(17)\r\n\r\n“For goodness’ sake!” cried Mrs. Seymour, “tell us at once where this\r\nterrible event occurred.”\r\n\r\n“In a fine Cheshire cheese!” exclaimed the vicar, “which had furnished\r\nabundant food to the miniature republic of mites that occupied its deep\r\nravines and alpine heights. I think now,” continued the reverend\r\ngentleman, “I am amply revenged for the allegorical jokes in which Mr.\r\nSeymour has so often indulged at my expense.”\r\n\r\n“I am well satisfied,” said Mr. Seymour; “for by repeating your\r\nallegory to my children, I shall be enabled to convey a striking lesson\r\nof wisdom. They will learn from it that there is not any pursuit,\r\nhowever exalted, that may not be assailed by the weapons of ridicule,\r\nespecially when wielded by those penurious philosophers whose ideas of\r\nutility are circumscribed within the narrow limits of direct and\r\nimmediate profit.”\r\n\r\n“It is too true,” cried Mrs. Seymour, “that we are all apt to\r\ndepreciate those branches of knowledge which do not bear directly upon\r\nthe comforts or necessities of life; and the applications of geology\r\nare, perhaps, so remote as scarcely to be discovered by the mass of\r\nmankind.”\r\n\r\n“There I must differ with you,” replied her husband: “to say nothing of\r\nthe practical advantages which have accrued to the miner from this\r\nstudy, it has been the means of bringing hundreds of acres into\r\ncultivation in districts where never a blade of grass had before\r\ngrown;(18) and if scholastic researches have thrown additional light on\r\nscriptural subjects, they are no more to be compared with those of the\r\ngeologist on these occasions, than is the light of the glow-worm to\r\nthat of the sun.”\r\n\r\n“Hey-day! what do I hear?” exclaimed the vicar. “Would you compare the\r\ntestimony of the Apamean medal with that of an unshapen flint?”\r\n\r\n“I would rest my faith upon a _rock_,” replied Mr. Seymour; “the caves\r\nof Buckland(19) have done more towards supporting the Mosaic account of\r\nthe Deluge than all the medals of the virtuoso. Fossils, in truth, are\r\nto the geologist what medals are to the antiquary, preserving a record\r\nof events which must otherwise have perished in the stream of time.”\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Seymour and the vicar by this time arrived at the\r\nWernerian Temple, where, having discussed several points connected with\r\nits objects, Mr. Twaddleton gave an account of Major Snapwell, whose\r\nhistory created considerable interest, and determined Mr. Seymour to\r\ncall at Ivy Cottage, and invite its inmate to the Lodge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rock teetering on a ledge.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Footnote 16: A common plate will answer the purpose; but the black\r\n  surface gives the advantage of exhibiting more perfectly the motion\r\n  of the water during the progress of the experiment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  See page 54.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two boys rolling hoops along the ground using sticks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n _The subject of Rotatory Motion continued.--A Ball, by having a\r\n    peculiar spinning motion imparted to it, may be made to stop\r\n    short, or to retrograde, though it meets not with any apparent\r\n    obstacle.--The rectilinear path of a Spherical Body influenced\r\n    by its rotatory motion.--Bilboquet, or Cup and Ball.--The joint\r\n    forces which enable the Balancer to throw up and catch his Balls\r\n    on the full gallop.--The Hoop.--The Centre of Percussion.--The\r\n    Whip and Peg-top.--Historical Notices.--The power by which the\r\n    Top is enabled to sustain its vertical position during the act\r\n    of spinning.--The sleeping of the Top explained.--The force\r\n    which enables it to rise from an oblique into a vertical\r\n    position.--Its gyration._\r\n\r\n\r\n“Tom, do you remember that I told you a few days ago,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour, “that, by giving a revolving body a peculiar _spinning_\r\nmotion, certain effects were produced, which I should, on some future\r\noccasion, take into consideration?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure I do,” replied Tom.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, attend to me.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour took a marble, and, placing it on the ground, gave it an\r\nimpulse forward by pressing his forefinger upon it: the marble darted\r\nforward a few paces, after which it rolled back again.\r\n\r\n“That is most extraordinary!” cried Tom; “the marble came back to your\r\nhand, as it were, of its own accord, and without having met with any\r\nobstacle.”\r\n\r\n“And you, no doubt,” said Mr. Seymour, “regard it as contrary to the\r\nwell known law, that a body once put in motion, in any direction, will\r\ncontinue to move in that direction until some foreign cause oppose it.”\r\n\r\n“It really would appear so.”\r\n\r\n“It is, however, far otherwise; the force which I imparted to the\r\nmarble communicated to it two kinds of motion; the one projecting it\r\nforward, the other producing a rotatory motion round its axis, in a\r\ndirection opposite to that of its rectilinear course; and the\r\nconsequence was simply this, that when the former motion, on account of\r\nthe friction of the marble on the ground, was destroyed, the rotatory\r\nmotion continued, and by thus establishing an action in an opposite\r\ndirection, caused the marble to retrograde. If, however, you will fetch\r\nyour hoop, I will demonstrate the fact on a larger scale.”\r\n\r\nTom accordingly produced the hoop; and Mr. Seymour projected it\r\nforward, giving to it, at the same instant, a spinning motion in an\r\nopposite direction. The hoop proceeded forward to a certain distance,\r\nwhen it stopped, and then ran back to the hand.\r\n\r\n“Let me beg you,” said Mr. Seymour, “to treasure this fact in your\r\nmemory; you perceive by it how greatly the progressive direction of a\r\nbody may be influenced by a rotatory motion around its axis; and,\r\nindeed, the theory of the _rifle_ gun(20) is easily deduced from it. It\r\nwill also explain the effect which a rotatory motion produces in\r\nsteadying or disturbing the direction of a projectile. It is for such a\r\nreason that the balancer constantly whirls round his balls or oranges,\r\nas he throws them into the air, with the intention of catching them\r\nagain; and that in playing at _Bilboquet_, or cup and ball, you find it\r\nnecessary to give a spinning motion to the ball, in order to catch it\r\non the spike--but we will consider this subject presently. I am now\r\ndesirous of laying down a few propositions upon the subject of\r\nrotation, the knowledge of which is essential for the explanation of\r\nthe motions of revolving bodies.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour proceeded to state that every body had three principal axes\r\nupon which it might revolve, but that the shortest was the only one\r\nupon which it could permanently and steadily rotate--that should it, in\r\nconsequence of the impulse given to it, begin to spin upon any other\r\nthan the shortest axis, it would, during its revolutions, be constantly\r\nshowing a tendency to approach it; whence it followed that, under such\r\ncircumstances, it would be unsteady and _wabbling_ in its motions.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, to make this proposition intelligible to the\r\nchildren, Mr. Seymour performed the following simple experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two rings, labeled 1 and 2.]\r\n\r\nHaving tied some string to a common curtain ring, as represented by\r\nfigure 1, he twisted it round by means of his thumb and finger, until\r\nit acquired considerable velocity, when the ring was seen to rise\r\ngradually into the position represented by fig. 2. Thus, in the\r\nsimplest manner, was a revolving body shown to exchange its longer for\r\nits shorter axis.\r\n\r\nThe children declared that they perfectly comprehended the subject, and\r\nTom observed that, in future, whenever he wished to make a ball spin\r\nsteadily, he should take care to make it turn on its shortest axis.\r\n\r\n“You are quite right, Tom,” said Mr. Seymour; “and the skilful bowler\r\nat cricket, in order to give his ball a steady axis of rotation, always\r\nholds it with the seam across, so that the tips of his fingers may\r\ntouch, and he takes care to hold it only with such a grasp as may be\r\nsufficient to steady it, for by a turn even of the wrist it may be made\r\nto proceed unsteadily; and this leads me to consider another equally\r\nimportant proposition--viz. that the axis of rotation should coincide\r\nwith the direction in which it is moving forward, or, in other words,\r\nwith its line of motion. Now, where this is not the case, it is evident\r\nthat the unequal action of the air will cause the body to deviate from\r\nits straight course, since its two sides, having different velocities\r\n(the rotatory and progressive motions conspiring on one side, while\r\nthey are in opposition on the other), will be differently affected by\r\nsuch resistance; the resistance, of course, increasing with the\r\nvelocity. It is upon this principle,” continued Mr. Seymour, “that Sir\r\nIsaac Newton has explained the irregular motion of the tennis-ball.”\r\n\r\n“But do explain to us, papa,” said Louisa, “why it is so necessary to\r\nspin the ball in order to catch it on the spike?”\r\n\r\n“Rotatory motion, my dear, when directed according to the principles I\r\nhave endeavoured to enforce, will always steady the course of a body.\r\nIn playing at bilboquet, your object is so to throw up the ball that\r\nits hole may descend perpendicularly upon the spike which is held for\r\nits reception; and in order to accomplish this, you make the ball spin\r\nupon an axis, at the extremity of which is the hole; the consequence is\r\nobvious.”\r\n\r\nLouisa observed, that she well remembered an allusion to this game in\r\nMiss Edgeworth’s Essays on Education; and that, unless she was much\r\ndeceived, the advantage to be gained by spinning the ball was referred\r\nto centrifugal force, and its effect in preserving the “_parallelism of\r\nmotion_.”\r\n\r\n“I do not recollect the passage,” answered her father, “but I will\r\nadmit that the centrifugal force is indirectly instrumental to the\r\neffect, although, in my view of the subject, it is more philosophical\r\nto refer it at once to the creation of an appropriate axis of rotation.”\r\n\r\n“I well remember,” observed Tom, “that the rider at Astley’s whirled\r\nround the oranges as he threw them into the air.”\r\n\r\n“And I hope that you are now not only acquainted with the principle\r\nwhich rendered such a rotatory motion necessary, but that which must\r\nmake the shorter the more eligible axis for effecting his purpose;--but\r\ncan you tell me how it could have happened, that the oranges, which\r\nwere thrown perpendicularly upwards while the horseman was on the full\r\ngallop, should have fallen again into his hand?”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Louisa, “that puzzled me exceedingly; I should have thought\r\nhe would have ridden away from them, and that they must have fallen\r\nseveral feet behind him.”\r\n\r\n“What say you, Tom, to that?” enquired Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” replied Tom, “that the rider calculated upon the distance\r\nhe would pass forward before they could fall, and projected them\r\naccordingly.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed; there is no calculation in the case, nor is any art used\r\nto throw the oranges in advance: they are projected perpendicularly\r\nfrom the hand; and if you will only recall to your mind the subject of\r\nthe ‘Composition of Forces,’ the mystery will vanish.”\r\n\r\n“I see it all clearly,” cried Tom; “the orange partakes of the\r\nprogressive motion of the rider; when, therefore, he throws it upwards,\r\nit is influenced by two forces which are in the direction of the two\r\nsides of a parallelogram, and it consequently describes the diagonal.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right; but you doubtless will perceive that, instead of\r\na straight line, the orange will describe a parabolic curve.”\r\n\r\n“For the same reason, I suppose,” said Tom, “that the stone from the\r\nsling described a curve?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; but see, I have a diagram which will explain the subject\r\nmore clearly.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A man on a moving horse demonstrates progressive motion\r\nwith an orange.]\r\n\r\n“The orange, as it is thrown into the air, is influenced by two forces:\r\nthe one arising from the progressive motion of the rider, the other\r\nfrom the projectile force imparted to it. These two forces are in the\r\ndirection of the adjacent sides of a parallelogram, and were it not for\r\nthe operation of gravity, the body would accordingly describe its\r\ndiagonal in the same space of time as it would have described one of\r\nthe sides.[18] The influence of gravity, however, not only deflects it\r\nfrom a right line into a curve, but diminishes its force, so that\r\ninstead of arriving at the opposite angle of the parallelogram _a_, its\r\ngreatest altitude will be short of that point; it will then descend\r\nthrough a similar curve; and, since the times of ascent and descent are\r\nequal,[19] it will reach the hand of the rider at the very moment he is\r\nprepared to receive it; for the orange will have traversed the\r\nparabolic curve in the same space of time as the horseman required for\r\npassing from one extremity of the curve to the other.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour having concluded this explanation, much to the satisfaction\r\nof the young party, observed that the present occasion was an\r\nappropriate one for the introduction of some remarks on the favourite\r\npastime of the HOOP.\r\n\r\n“It is a classical pastime,” exclaimed the vicar, “and was as common\r\nwith the Greeks and Romans as it is with boys of the present\r\ngeneration.”\r\n\r\n“And it has the advantage,” added Mr. Seymour, “of sending the tide of\r\nlife in healthful currents through the veins.”\r\n\r\nTom began to trundle his hoop along the gravel walk.\r\n\r\n“Stop, stop, my dear boy,” cried his father, “you seem to have\r\nforgotten our compact, that every toy should be fairly won before it\r\nwas played with. Come upon the lawn, and let me ask you some questions\r\nrelative to the motions of the hoop. Can you make it stand still upon\r\nits edge?”\r\n\r\n“Not readily,” was Tom’s reply.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” continued Mr. Seymour, “during its progressive motion, it\r\nrolls on its edge without any disposition to fall: how happens that?”\r\n\r\n“It is owing to the centrifugal force, which gives it a motion in the\r\ndirection of a _tangent_ to the circle, and, consequently, overcomes\r\nthe force of gravity.”\r\n\r\n“Your answer is pat,” replied his father: “as long as you give your\r\nhoop a certain degree of velocity, the _tangential_, or centrifugal\r\nforce, overcomes gravity, in the manner you have already witnessed;[20]\r\nbut, when that is slackened, the hoop will fall on its side; not,\r\nhowever, until it has made several complete revolutions. Now, answer me\r\nanother question. Why is it so difficult to make the hoop proceed\r\nstraight forward, without turning to the right or left?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it arises from the same cause as that which altered the\r\ndirection of my marble as it ran along--the inequality of the ground.”\r\n\r\n“That,” replied his father, “would undoubtedly have its influence; but\r\nit is principally to be referred to the impossibility of your\r\nconstantly giving a straight blow by the stick. When it is moving\r\nforward, a slight inclination towards either side will cause the parts\r\nto acquire a motion towards that side, those which are uppermost being\r\nmost affected by it; and this lateral, or sideway motion, assisted\r\nsometimes by the irregular curvature of the hoop, causes its path to\r\ndeviate from a rectilinear direction; so that, instead of moving\r\nstraight forward, it turns to that side towards which it began to\r\nincline; and, in this position, its tendency to fall is still farther\r\ncounteracted by the centrifugal force. It is from a similar cause that\r\nthe bullet, unless rifled, will have a tendency to go to the right or\r\nleft, from any unequal impulse which it may have received at the moment\r\nof its exit from the barrel. I have yet one other question, and, as its\r\nanswer will lead us into the consideration of a mechanical subject of\r\nsome importance, I must beg you to bestow all your attention. In\r\ntrundling your hoop, have you not often observed that, although the\r\nblow inflicted upon it by your stick might have been violent, yet the\r\neffect produced by it was comparatively small, in consequence of the\r\nhoop having been struck by a disadvantageous part of the stick?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly! I have frequently observed that, if the hoop is struck by\r\nthe stick either too near the hand, or too near the end, much of its\r\nforce is lost; and I have also noticed the same thing in striking the\r\nball with my cricket-bat.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said Mr. Seymour, “that every striking body has what is\r\ntermed its _centre of percussion_, in which all the percutient force of\r\na body is, as it were, collected; thus, a stick of a cylindrical\r\nfigure, supposing the centre of motion at the hand, will strike the\r\ngreatest blow at a point about two-thirds of its length from the wrist.\r\nI may, perhaps, at some future time, return to this subject, and\r\nexplain several mechanical effects which are dependent upon it.(21) Now\r\naway with you, and trundle your hoop, or spin your top; as soon as the\r\nvicar arrives I will rejoin you.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of an hour Mr. Seymour and his reverend friend proceeded\r\nto the play-ground, where they found the children busily engaged in\r\ntheir several diversions.\r\n\r\n“I rejoice to find you at so classical a pastime,” said the vicar, as\r\nhe approached Tom, who was busily engaged in spinning his top. “The\r\ntop, my boy, is a subject which the great Mantuan bard did not consider\r\nbeneath the patronage of his muse: but, hey-day! this is not the\r\n‘_volitans sub verbere turbo_’ of the immortal Virgil; the top of\r\nantiquity was the whip-top, the peg-top is a barbarous innovation of\r\nmodern times: a practical proof of the degeneracy of the race. Even\r\nboys, forsooth, must now-a-days have their activity cramped by\r\ninventions to supersede labour: well may we regard the weapons, which\r\nour sturdy ancestors wielded as instruments rather calculated for\r\ngiants than men, if such pains be taken to instil into the minds of\r\nyouth the mischievous spirit of idleness.”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” said Tom, who was always grieved at displeasing the\r\nvicar, “if it will gratify you, I will spin my _whip_-top, for I have\r\nan excellent one which my papa has lately given me.”\r\n\r\n“Well said! my dear boy. ‘_Puer bonæ spei._’--What a pity would it be\r\nto damp so noble a spirit; get your whip-top.”\r\n\r\nTom accordingly placed the Virgilian top upon the ground, and as the\r\nboy plied the whip, so did the vicar lash the air with his quotation;\r\nrunning round the top in apparent ecstasy, while he repeated the\r\nwell-known lines from the seventh Æneid:--\r\n\r\n                       “Ille actus habena\r\n             Curvatis fertur spatiis; stupet inscia turba,\r\n             Impubesque manus, mirata volubile buxum:\r\n             Dant animos plagæ.”[21]\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Twaddleton thus gave vent to that fervour which was ever kindled\r\nby collision with Virgil, Tom gave motion to his top, which swaggered\r\nabout with such an air of self-importance, that, to the eye of fancy,\r\nit might have appeared as if proudly conscious of the encomiums that\r\nhad been so liberally lavished upon it.\r\n\r\n“The Grecian boys, as Suidas informs us, played also with this top,”\r\ncontinued the vicar.\r\n\r\n“And pray, may I ask,” said Mr. Seymour, “whether it was not introduced\r\ninto this country by the Romans?”\r\n\r\n“Probably,” replied the vicar. “Figures representing boys in the act of\r\nwhipping their tops first appear in the marginal paintings of the\r\nmanuscripts of the fourteenth century; at which period, the form of the\r\ntoy was the same as it is at present, and the manner of impelling it by\r\nthe whip can admit of but little if any difference. In a\r\nmanuscript,[22] at the British Museum, I have read a very curious\r\nanecdote which refers to Prince Henry, the eldest son of James the\r\nFirst; with your permission I will relate it to you.”\r\n\r\nHere the vicar extracted a memorandum-book from his pocket, and read\r\nthe following note:--\r\n\r\n“The first tyme that he, the prince, went to the towne of Sterling to\r\nmeete the king, seeing a little without the gate of the towne a stack\r\nof corne, in proportion not unlike to a topp, wherewith he used to\r\nplay, he said to some that were with him, ‘Loe there is a goodly topp:’\r\nwhereupon one of them saying, ‘Why doe you not play with it then?’ he\r\nanswered, ‘Set you it up for me, and I will play with it.’”\r\n\r\n“Was not that a clever retort of the young prince?” said the vicar, as\r\nhe returned the manuscript into his memorandum-book; “and I think it\r\nmust have confounded the courtier who could have asked so silly a\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Tom,” said Mr. Seymour, “let us see whether you can set up your\r\nown top, so that it shall stand steadily on its point.”\r\n\r\n“I have often tried that experiment,” answered Tom, “but could never\r\nsucceed in keeping the line of direction within its narrow base.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, when in rotatory motion, its erect position is maintained\r\nwithout difficulty; how is that?”\r\n\r\n“Is it not owing to the centrifugal force?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly: but as the subject is highly interesting, I will\r\nendeavour to explain it more fully. You must, however, first obtain\r\npermission from the vicar to spin your humming-top, for that will\r\nbetter illustrate the phenomena which it is my wish to examine.”\r\n\r\n“If your object is the exercise of the body, let us spin the whip-top,”\r\nreplied the vicar; “but if you wish to exercise the boy’s mind, I\r\ncannot object to your selecting the top best calculated to fulfil that\r\ndesire.”\r\n\r\nTom, having accordingly prepared his top, pulled the string, and set\r\nthe wooden machine spinning on the floor.\r\n\r\n“Now, Tom, I will explain to you the reason of the top being able to\r\nsustain its vertical position. You have already learned, from the\r\naction of the sling, that a body cannot move in a circular path,\r\nwithout making an effort to fly off in a right line from the\r\ncentre;[23] so that, if a body be affixed to a string, and whirled\r\nround by the hand, it will stretch it, and in a greater degree\r\naccording as the circular motion is more rapid.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“The top, then, being in motion, all its parts tend to recede from the\r\naxis, and with greater force the more rapidly it revolves: hence it\r\nfollows that these parts are like so many powers acting in a direction\r\nperpendicular to the axis; but, as they are all equal, and as they pass\r\nall round with rapidity by the rotation, the result must be that the\r\ntop is in equilibrio on its point of support, or on the extremity of\r\nthe axis on which it turns. But see, your top is down.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the reason,” asked Tom, “of its motion being stopped?”\r\n\r\n“I can answer that question, papa,” said Louisa; “is it not owing to\r\nthe friction of the ground?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; that has, doubtless, its influence: but the resistance of\r\nthe air is also a powerful force upon this occasion. A top has been\r\nmade to spin in vacuo as long as two hours and sixteen minutes.[24] But\r\ncome, Tom, spin your top once more. Observe,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour,\r\n“how obliquely the top is spinning. It is now gradually rising out of\r\nan oblique position;--now it is steadily spinning on a vertical\r\naxis;--and now its motion is so steady, that it scarcely seems to move.”\r\n\r\n“It is _sleeping_, as we call it,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Its centre of gravity is now situated perpendicularly over its point\r\nof support, which is the extremity of the axis of rotation: but attend\r\nto me,” continued Mr. Seymour, “for I am about to attempt the\r\nexplanation of a phenomenon which has puzzled many older and wiser\r\nphilosophers than yourselves. It is evident that the top, in rising\r\nfrom an oblique to a vertical position, must have its centre of gravity\r\nraised; what can have been the force which effected this change?”\r\n\r\n“Was it the centrifugal force?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” said Mr. Seymour, “as I will presently convince you.”\r\n\r\n“Then it must have been the resistance of the air,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\n“No; nor was it the resistance of the air,” replied her father: “for\r\nthe same effect takes place in vacuo.”\r\n\r\n“Then pray inform us, by what means the top was raised.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A toy top, diagonal to a surface.]\r\n\r\n“It entirely depended upon the form of the extremity of the peg, and\r\nnot upon any simple effect connected with the rotatory or centrifugal\r\nforce of the top. I will first satisfy you that, were the peg to\r\nterminate in a fine, that is to say, in a _mathematical_ point, the top\r\nnever could raise itself. Let A B C be a top spinning in an oblique\r\nposition, having the end of the peg, on which it spins, brought to a\r\nfine point. It will continue to spin in the direction in which it\r\nreaches the ground, without the least tendency to rise into a more\r\nvertical position; and it is by its rotatory or centrifugal force that\r\nit is kept in this original position: for if we conceive the top\r\ndivided into two equal parts A and B, by a plane passing through the\r\nline X C, and suppose that at any moment during its spinning, the\r\nconnection between these two parts were suddenly dissolved, then would\r\nany point in the part A fly off with the given force in the direction\r\nof the tangent, and any corresponding point in the part B with an equal\r\nforce in an opposite direction; whilst, therefore, these two parts\r\nremain connected together, during the spinning of the top, these two\r\nequal and opposite forces A and B will balance each other, and the top\r\nwill continue to spin on its original axis. Having thus shown that the\r\nrotatory or centrifugal force can never make the top rise from an\r\noblique to a vertical position, I shall proceed to explain the true\r\ncause of this change, and I trust you will be satisfied that it depends\r\nupon the bluntness of the point. Let A B C be a top spinning in an\r\noblique position, terminating in a very short point with a\r\nhemispherical shoulder P _a_ M. It is evident that, in this case, the\r\ntop will not spin upon _a_ the end of the true axis X _a_, but upon P,\r\na point in the circle P M, to which the floor I F is a tangent.\r\nInstead, therefore, of revolving upon a fixed and stationary point, the\r\ntop will roll round upon the small circle P M on its blunt point, with\r\nvery considerable friction, the force of which may be represented by a\r\nline O P at right angles to the floor I F, and to the spherical end of\r\nthe peg of the top: now it is the action of this force, by its pressure\r\non one side of the blunt point of the top, which causes it to rise in a\r\nvertical direction. Produce the line O P till it meets the axis C; from\r\nthe point C draw the line C T perpendicular to the axis _a_ X, and T O\r\nparallel to it; and then, by a resolution of forces, the line T C will\r\nrepresent that part of the friction which presses at right angles to\r\nthe axis, so as gradually to raise it in a vertical position; in which\r\noperation the circle P M gradually diminishes by the approach of the\r\npoint P to _a_, as the axis becomes more perpendicular, and vanishes\r\nwhen the point P coincides with the point _a_, that is to say, when the\r\ntop has arrived at its vertical position, where it will continue to\r\n_sleep_, without much friction, or any other disturbing force, until\r\nits rotatory motion fails, and its side is brought to the earth by the\r\nforce of gravity.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A top diagonal to a surface, with a diagram describing\r\nits rotation.]\r\n\r\n“I _think_ I understand it,” said Tom, “although I have some doubt\r\nabout it; but if you would be so kind as to give me the demonstration\r\nin writing, I will diligently study it.”\r\n\r\n“Most readily,” said Mr. Seymour. “Indeed I cannot expect that you\r\nshould comprehend so difficult a subject, without the most patient\r\ninvestigation; and, in the present state of your knowledge, I am\r\ncompelled to omit the relation of several very important circumstances,\r\nto which I may, hereafter, direct your attention. When, for instance,\r\nyou have become acquainted with the elements of astronomy, I shall be\r\nable to show you that the gyration of the top depends upon the same\r\nprinciples as the precession of the equinoxes.”(22)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two boys spin a top with whips.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  See page 119.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  See page 54.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  See page 126.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  “The wooden engine flies and whirls about,\r\n   Admired, with clamours, of the beardless rout:\r\n   They lash aloud; each other they provoke,\r\n   And lend their little souls at every stroke.”--DRYDEN.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Harl. lib. i. marked 6391.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Page 126.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Short on ‘Serson’s Horizontal Top.’ Phil.

With this view he hastily sketched a diagram,\r\nand proceeded with it to the scene of sport.\r\n\r\n“Now, Tom, let me see how far you have profited by our late\r\nconversation. I have some questions to ask you about the action of your\r\nTrap and Ball,” said his father.\r\n\r\n“I do not suppose there is much philosophy in the game,” observed Tom.\r\n\r\n“Of that we shall judge presently.--Can you tell me the direction which\r\nthe ball takes after it flies from the spoon of the Trap, in\r\nconsequence of the blow of the bat upon the trigger?”\r\n\r\n“It flies upwards, to be sure, and allows me to strike it with my bat,”\r\nanswered the boy.\r\n\r\n“Very true; but at what angle?--I see you hesitate, look therefore at\r\nthe diagram I have prepared, and attend to my explanation of it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour produced the sketch which we here present to our readers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sketch of Trap.]\r\n\r\n“A B represent the spoon and trigger in their quiescent position. Upon\r\nstriking the end B with the bat, they are brought into the position\r\nC D. The spoon will thus have described the small arc A C, when it will\r\nbe suddenly stopped by the end of the trigger D coming into contact\r\nwith the shoe. The motion of the ball, however, will not be arrested,\r\nand it will consequently be projected forward out of the spoon.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” exclaimed Louisa, “in the same manner as the shilling flew\r\noff the wine glass, or a person on a galloping horse would be thrown\r\nover the head by its suddenly stopping.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, Louisa; your memory, I perceive, has not suffered from\r\nthe drenching you received from the water-cart;[25]--but can you tell\r\nme,” continued Mr. Seymour, “the direction which the ball will take\r\n_after_ its release from the spoon?”\r\n\r\nThis was a step beyond Louisa’s knowledge, and her father, in order to\r\nassist her, begged her to consider in what direction it was moving\r\n_before_ it left the spoon.\r\n\r\n“You have just told us,” said Tom, “that it described an arc, or\r\nportion of a circle.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Mr. Seymour; “and did not the philosophy of your\r\nsling teach you that, when a body revolving in a circle is suddenly\r\ndisengaged, it will fly off in a right line in the direction in which\r\nit was moving at the instant of its release?--the ball therefore will\r\ndescribe the tangent C E.”\r\n\r\n“It is all clear enough to me now,” said Tom, evidently vexed that he\r\nhad overlooked a principle which had been so lately explained to him by\r\nthe action of his sling.\r\n\r\n“I now see, too,” added Tom, “why the ball seldom flies off at the same\r\nangle in every trap.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said his father, “must of course depend upon the extent of the\r\narc described by the spoon, and which will of course vary in different\r\ntraps.”\r\n\r\n“Before we conclude the subject, let me ask you whether there is not\r\nsome one point in the bat, at which you can most effectually strike the\r\nball?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” answered Tom, “in the same way tha there is a point in my\r\nhoop-stick at which I can give the strongest blow--and that point is\r\ntermed the _Centre_ of Percussion.”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said Mr. Seymour; “see, here comes the vicar.”\r\n\r\nTrue to the hour appointed, did Mr. Twaddleton make his appearance,\r\njust at the conclusion of the discussion above described; and, as he\r\napproached the party, Louisa observed that he was carrying a canvass\r\nbag in his hand.\r\n\r\n“What have you there?” asked Mr. Seymour. “A sack of sugar-plums?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; spheres of larger diameter. Here,” said the vicar, as he\r\nopened his bag, “is a foot-ball for you, Tom; and here is a hand-ball\r\nfor you, Louisa.” He then presented each of the other children with a\r\nsimilar present, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n           ‘Nemo ex hoc numero mihi non donatus abibit.’[26]\r\n\r\nas Virgil has it.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Mr. Seymour, “you will enhance the value of this\r\nfavour, by giving us an antiquarian history of the ball, which will be\r\nvery acceptable to us at this time, as we have just concluded a\r\nphilosophical enquiry upon that subject.”\r\n\r\nTo this request the vicar readily assented, and proceeded as follows:--\r\n\r\n“The Greeks appear to have played with four kinds of ball: viz. the\r\n_little ball_, the _great ball_, the _empty ball_ ( σφαιρα κενη ),\r\nwhich was blown up with air, like our foot-ball, and the _leathern\r\nball_ ( κωρυκον ), which was suspended from the ceiling, and stuffed\r\nwith bran or sand, as those who tossed it were robust or delicate. The\r\nRomans,” continued the vicar, “had also four kinds of _pilæ_, or balls.\r\nThe _follis_, a large ball made of leather and blown up with air, like\r\nour foot-ball; the larger kinds of which were struck with the arm, the\r\nsmaller ones with the fist. Suetonius tells us that Augustus Cæsar\r\ngreatly delighted in the amusement; and in truth it was a glorious\r\nsport, an exercise equally adapted for the young and old; or as Martial\r\nhas it,--\r\n\r\n           ‘_Folle_ decet pueros ludere, _folle_ senes.’“[27]\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said Mr. Seymour, “neither Horace nor Virgil played at it;\r\ndo not you remember the lines in the fifth satire?--\r\n\r\n          ‘Lusum it Mæcenas, dormitum ego Virgiliusque;\r\n          Namque pilâ lippis inimicum et ludere crudis.’”[28]\r\n\r\n“Many thanks, Mr. Seymour, many thanks for brushing up my recollection;\r\nbut I am a little doubtful about the game at which Mæcenas played at\r\nCapua: I have, by-the-by, lately read[29] an account of a peculiar game\r\nof ball for which the city of Sierra is celebrated, and it is supposed\r\nto be that referred to by Horace--‘It is played in the foss, which has\r\na very high wall, and it is not unlike a tennis-court; the ball is very\r\nlarge, and appears to be inflated with air; the arm is defended by a\r\nwooden guard or shield; at certain periods of the game, one of the\r\nplayers runs down a spring-board, and throwing the whole of his weight,\r\nmomentum, and strength upon the ball, as it is thrown towards him, he\r\nstrikes it to an astonishing distance.’ The second kind of ball,”\r\ncontinued the vicar, “was termed _trigonalis_, which is conjectured to\r\nhave been nearly the same as our tennis-ball. It derived its name from\r\nthe position of the three persons who played with it; they were placed\r\nin a triangle, and alternately caught and tossed the ball, and he who\r\nfirst let it fall to the ground was the loser. The third kind of ball\r\nwas the _paganica_, as being much used in country villages. Some\r\nauthors state it to have been constructed of leather and stuffed with\r\nfeathers, while others conjecture it to have been a large kind of\r\n_follis_. The fourth was the _harpastum_; a small ball, so called\r\nbecause the gamesters endeavoured to snatch it from each other.”\r\n\r\n“It seems,” observed Louisa, “to be a sport better adapted to boys than\r\ngirls.”\r\n\r\n“In that supposition you are quite mistaken,” replied the vicar; “on\r\nthe contrary, the hand-ball would seem to have been originally a female\r\nsport, for Homer has restricted the pastime to the princess and young\r\nmaidens of Corcyra; at least, he has not mentioned its ever having been\r\npractised by the men.\r\n\r\n         ‘O’er the green mead, the sporting _virgins_ play,\r\n         Their shining veils unbound; along the skies,\r\n         Toss’d and re-toss’d, the ball incessant flies.’”[30]\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour said that, as the vicar had satisfied them of the high\r\nantiquity of the ball, he hoped he would now afford them some\r\ninformation respecting its use in England.\r\n\r\n“The game of hand-ball,” said the vicar, “called by the French\r\n_palm-play_, because the exercise consisted originally in receiving the\r\nball, and driving it back again with the _palm of the hand_, was\r\nformerly a favourite pastime among the youth of both sexes; and in many\r\nparts of the kingdom it was customary for them to play at this game\r\nduring the Easter holidays for tansy cakes. In ancient times, the mayor\r\nand aldermen of Newcastle used to go in state at the feasts of Easter\r\nand Whitsuntide, to a little mall of the town, to witness this game. It\r\nwas originally played with the naked hand; then with a glove, which in\r\nsome instances was lined; afterwards, cords and catgut strings were\r\nbound upon the hand to make the ball rebound more forcibly.”\r\n\r\n“That custom,” observed Mr. Seymour, “doubtless, gave origin to the\r\n_racket_.”\r\n\r\n“It did,” replied the vicar; “and the places where this game was played\r\nwere called _tennis-courts_, and the game itself obtained the name of\r\n_tennis_, from the French word _tenez_[31] (take it, hold it),\r\nfrequently used during the exercise. The pastime, I believe, was\r\nintroduced amongst our ancestors about the year 1222, the sixth year of\r\nHenry III, by persons of superior rank and family, who erected courts\r\nor oblong edifices for the performance of the exercise.”\r\n\r\n“I long to hear something about foot-ball,” exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\n“That is a pastime,” said the vicar, “which was formerly in great vogue\r\nin England, but of late years it has fallen into disrepute. It derives\r\nits name, as you may suppose, from the circumstance of the ball being\r\ndriven with the foot, in preference to the hand. When a match is made,\r\ntwo parties, equal in numbers, take the field, and stand between two\r\ngoals, which are placed at the distance of eighty or a hundred yards\r\nfrom each other. The ball, which is commonly a blown bladder, cased\r\nwith leather, is delivered in the midst of the ground, and the object\r\nof either party is to drive it through the goal of their opponents, by\r\nwhich the game is won. The abilities of the performers are best\r\ndisplayed in attacking and defending the goals, whence the pastime is\r\nmore frequently called a _goal_, than a _game_ at foot-ball. In this\r\nattack and defence, the exercise becomes exceedingly violent; the\r\nplayers kick each other’s shins without the least ceremony; and this\r\noccasioned James I. to speak of foot-ball as ‘_meeter for laming than\r\nmaking able the users thereof_.’”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the ancient game of _goff_ is\r\nstill much practised in Scotland.”\r\n\r\n“It is,” replied the vicar. “In the reign of Edward III. the Latin name\r\n_cambuca_, a crooked club, or staff, was applied to this pastime,\r\nbecause it was played with such an instrument. The bat was also styled\r\na _bandy_, from its being bent; and hence the game itself is frequently\r\ncalled _bandy-ball_.”\r\n\r\n“And how is it played?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“It is played on a smooth common, by driving forward two small hard\r\nballs, with the _bandy_ I have just described, into very distant holes\r\nin the ground, about a foot deep, and nine inches over: and the party\r\nwhose ball is driven into these holes with the fewest strokes, is the\r\nvictor.”\r\n\r\n“But come,” said Mr. Seymour, “it is high time to think of our dinner;\r\nthe children must require some refreshment. I am not, my dear vicar,\r\none of those philosophers who believe that play was invented by the\r\nLydians[32] as a remedy against hunger; nor do I subscribe to the\r\nopinion of the elder Scriblerus, that it was on such an account wisely\r\ncontrived by Nature, that children who have the keenest appetites\r\nshould, at the same time, be those who are most addicted to sport.”\r\n\r\n“Whether you believe or not that the Lydians invented sports shall not\r\nbe a subject of contest between us,” said the reverend antiquary;\r\n“but,” continued he, “one thing is quite certain, that the Lydian games\r\nwere at first called _Lydi_ by the Romans; and afterwards, by\r\ncorruption, _Ludi_; a presumption I must needs say in favour of the\r\nLydian claim; but enough of this: to what do you propose we should next\r\nturn our attention? I doubt not you have some new sport for our\r\nrecreation as well as our instruction,” added the vicar.\r\n\r\n“We will, if you please, attend the children to their _see-saw_, which\r\nthe gardener has lately constructed for them,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nThe party accordingly walked to the grove, in which a plank had been\r\nplaced across a wooden post: and upon which Tom and John had been\r\nriding for some time in the earlier part of the morning. The boys again\r\nmounted their new hobby; and, after amusing themselves for some\r\nminutes, Mr. Seymour desired them to stop, in order that Tom might\r\nexplain the principle upon which the _see-saw_ acted. Tom replied, that\r\nhe was not aware of any principle which could apply to riding on a\r\nplank.\r\n\r\n“Have I not often told you, my dear boy, that the principles of Natural\r\nPhilosophy may be brought to bear on the most trivial acts of life?\r\nListen, therefore, and you shall find that your present amusement teems\r\nwith instruction. You are already well acquainted with the nature and\r\noperations of the centre of gravity; tell me, therefore, whereabouts it\r\nlies in the plank upon which you are riding.”\r\n\r\n“I should think,” replied Tom, “that in this instance, the centres of\r\ngravity and magnitude must coincide, or be very nearly in the same\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\n“The centre of gravity must, as you say, be very nearly in the middle\r\nof the board; and if that be the case, you will allow that, supposing\r\nthose who ride upon it are of equal weight, the plank must be supported\r\nin the centre to make the two arms equal; but you and John are of\r\nunequal weight, so that you perceive the plank must be drawn a little\r\nfarther over the prop to make the arms unequal; and John, who is the\r\nlightest, must be placed at the extremity of the largest arm. Thus\r\narranged, you will exactly balance each other; and as each of you, on\r\nyour descent, touches the ground with your feet, the reaction affords\r\nyou a spring, which destroys the equilibrium, and enables you to\r\noscillate in arcs about the centre of motion.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two children on a see-saw, with circles drawn around\r\nthem to show their motion.]\r\n\r\n“Do we then describe the arcs of a circle as we ascend and descend?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly you must. Look at this diagram,” said Mr. Seymour, “and\r\nyou will see at once that the plank can only move round its centre of\r\nmotion; for how could you rise, or your brother fall, perpendicularly\r\nin a straight line? You must, in rising, and he, in descending,\r\ndescribe arcs of your respective circles. It is equally evident that\r\nhis velocity must be very superior to yours; for, if you could swing\r\nquite round, you would each complete your respective circles in the\r\nsame time.”\r\n\r\n“It would really appear so,” said Tom; “and I have myself observed,\r\nthat the lighter person has the better ride, as he moves both farther\r\nand quicker, and I now understand the reason of it; it is because being\r\nfarther from the centre of motion, he describes a larger arc.”\r\n\r\n“The greater velocity with which your little brother moves, renders his\r\nmomentum equal to yours. You have the most gravity, he the greatest\r\nvelocity; so that, upon the whole, your momenta are equal: for you, no\r\ndoubt, remember that momentum is weight multiplied into velocity.[33]\r\nYou have here then a striking instance of mechanical advantage gained\r\nby opposing motion to matter, or velocity to weight; for I think you\r\nwill readily admit, that without the aid of the plank, your little\r\nbrother could never have raised you from the ground.”\r\n\r\n“That is clear enough,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“The plank, then, thus arranged,” continued his father, “constitutes\r\nwhat has been termed a _mechanical power_, to which the name of _lever_\r\nhas been given; it is not, however, my intention at present to enter\r\ninto the history of these powers, of which there are six distinct\r\nkinds; the one presented to you, in the instance of the _see-saw_, is\r\nperhaps the most simple, and not the least important of them.”\r\n\r\n“It is very curious,” observed the vicar, “to reflect upon what a\r\nsimple, and apparently trifling fact, the powers of civilized man may\r\nbe said to depend. The single truth you have just announced, of making\r\nvelocity a compensation for weight, has supplied his weak arm with the\r\nmeans of controlling the very elements.”(23)\r\n\r\n“It is very true,” said Mr. Seymour, “and we might go so far as to say\r\nthat, had it been the will of the Almighty Creator of the universe to\r\nhave withheld from matter that property which we have been discussing,\r\nman must have remained the most helpless and forlorn of his creatures.\r\nI now propose,” added Mr. Seymour, “to accompany the children to their\r\nswing; the present is a suitable opportunity for giving them some idea\r\nof the doctrine of oscillation, or the theory of the pendulum.”\r\n\r\n“Let us proceed, then, to the _Icarian Game_,” exclaimed the vicar.\r\n\r\nAs the party walked along, Mr. Twaddleton explained the meaning of the\r\nabove allusion, with which the reader will be hereafter made\r\nacquainted. The children had commenced the sport, and Mr. Seymour\r\ninformed Tom and Louisa, who were attentively watching the motions of\r\nthe swing, that its vibrations, like those of the pendulum of a clock,\r\nwere produced by its effort to fall, from the force of gravity, and its\r\npower of ascending through an arc similar and opposite to that through\r\nwhich it has descended, from the momentum acquired during its descent.\r\n\r\n“Like the bandilor, I suppose,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Exactly, my dear, that is a very good comparison; for as the bandilor,\r\nhaving descended along the string by its gravity, acquires such a\r\nmomentum as to enable it to ascend the same string, and thus, as it\r\nwere, to wind itself up; so does the pendulum or swing, during its\r\ndescent, acquire a force that carries it up in an opposite arc to an\r\nequal height as that from which it had fallen. But tell me, Tom,\r\nwhether you have not discovered that the motion of your new swing\r\ndiffers from that which you experienced in your former one?”\r\n\r\n“The ropes of our present swing are so much longer than those which we\r\nformerly used, that the motion is much pleasanter.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” said Mr. Seymour. “Have you not observed that you also\r\nswing much slower?”\r\n\r\n“I have certainly noticed that,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“It is a law which I am desirous of impressing upon your memory, that\r\nthe shorter the pendulum, or swing, the quicker are its motions, and\r\n_vice versâ_; indeed, there is an established proportion between the\r\nvelocity and the length, which I shall, hereafter, endeavour to explain\r\nto you. Galileo, the celebrated philosopher, and mathematician to the\r\nDuke of Florence, accordingly proposed a method of ascertaining the\r\nheight of the arched ceiling of a church by the vibrations of a lamp\r\nsuspended from it. The solution of the problem was founded on the law\r\nto which I have just alluded, viz. that _the squares of the times of\r\nthe vibrations are as the lengths_; so that a pendulous body, four\r\ntimes the length of another, performs vibrations which last twice as\r\nlong. Now it is known that, in the latitude of London, a pendulum, if\r\n39 inches and two tenths in length, will vibrate seconds, or make 60\r\nswings in a minute; by observing, therefore, how much the pendulous\r\nbody deviates from this standard, we may, by the application of the\r\nabove rule, find its length; if the distance from the bottom of the\r\nlamp to the pavement be then measured, which may be done by means of a\r\nstick, and added to the former result, the sum will give the height of\r\nthe arch above the pavement: but I will show you the experiment the\r\nnext time we go into Overton church; the vicar can tell us the exact\r\nheight of the roof, and I will try how nearly I can approach the truth,\r\nby observing with a stop-watch how many seconds one vibration of the\r\nchandelier continues.”\r\n\r\n“But, papa, why surely the duration of its vibration must depend upon\r\nthe force which you may happen to give to the chandelier?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least; and this brings us at once to the consideration of\r\nthe most curious and important fact in the history of the pendulum, and\r\nfor a knowledge of which we are also indebted to Galileo.[34] It is\r\ntermed _isochronous_[35] property, or that by which all its vibrations,\r\nwhether great or small, are performed in exactly the same period of\r\ntime; but that you may be better able to comprehend this subject,\r\nattend to the diagram which I have prepared for your instruction.\r\nSuppose that the swing or pendulum A B be raised to C, it will, in\r\neffect, be raised the perpendicular height E C, and in falling will\r\ndescribe the arc C B; and, in the point B, it will have that velocity\r\nwhich is acquired by descending through C B, or by a body falling\r\nfreely through the perpendicular C E. This velocity will be sufficient\r\nto cause it to ascend through an equal arc B D, to the same height from\r\nwhence it fell at C; and since the times of ascent and descent are\r\nequal, it will describe both these arcs in exactly the same space of\r\ntime. Having lost all its motion at D, it will again begin to descend\r\nby its own gravity; and in the lowest point B it will acquire the same\r\nvelocity as before, which will cause it to reascend to C; and thus, by\r\nascending and descending, it will perform continual vibrations in the\r\ncircumference C B D; and, were it not for the resistance of the air,\r\nand the friction at the centre of motion A, the vibrations would never\r\ncease: but from these obstructions, though small, it happens, that the\r\nvelocity of the mass of matter at B is a little diminished in every\r\nvibration; and consequently it does not return precisely to the same\r\npoints C or D, but the arcs described continually become shorter and\r\nshorter, till at length they grow insensible; and yet the very same\r\ntime is required for the performance of the shorter as the longer arcs;\r\nfor, although in the one case the body passes over less space, still\r\nits velocity is proportionally decreased. You perceive, then, that in\r\nan attempt to ascertain the height of a ceiling by the vibrations of a\r\nchandelier, the extent of its swing cannot alter the time which may be\r\nrequired for its completion. And, if you will place your little brother\r\nin the swing, you will perceive that he will return to your hand in\r\nnearly the same space of time, whether he describes a large or small\r\narc; although this experiment must be considered as extremely rude,\r\nsince there are many disturbing causes for which the theory cannot\r\npossibly make any allowance. I must, moreover, warn you that where the\r\narc described is very considerable, the difference in the time will be\r\ngreater; for, in order to ensure this property of vibrating through\r\nunequal arcs in equal times, it is necessary that the path of the body\r\nshould describe a peculiar curve, called a cycloid(24), and not the\r\nsegment of a circle; at present, however, it is not possible for us to\r\nenter into this difficult branch of science, although I trust that at\r\nsome future period I shall be justified in an attempt to explain it.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drawing of a pendulum and its movements.]\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour having concluded his lecture, was about to return to the\r\nLodge, when Mrs. Seymour approached the party, carrying in her hands a\r\nletter, which the smile on her countenance announced to contain\r\nagreeable intelligence.\r\n\r\n“I have just received,” said Mrs. Seymour, “a letter from Miss Villers,\r\nwhom you must all remember as a most delightful person. I am informed\r\nthat she is about to be married to the nephew of a gentleman who is at\r\npresent in our neighbourhood in search of a country residence.”\r\n\r\n“Does she mention the gentleman’s name?” inquired the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Henry Beacham,” said Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“The nephew of Major Snapwell, I declare,” exclaimed the delighted\r\nvicar.\r\n\r\nThe whole party participated in the pleasure which their excellent\r\nfriend expressed at this discovery, and Mr. Seymour immediately\r\naccompanied Mr. Twaddleton to Ivy Lodge, to congratulate the major, and\r\nto make such arrangements as might expedite the purchase of Osterley\r\nPark, and the consequent introduction of a family into the\r\nneighbourhood of Overton, from whose society the Seymours anticipated\r\nthe highest satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Mrs. Seymour hastened to dispatch a letter to Miss\r\nVillers, in order to solicit her immediate presence at Overton Lodge.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  See page 65.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  “Not one amongst you shall depart without a gift from me.” _Æn_. v.\r\n  305.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Lib. xiv. epig. 43.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  “Mæcenas goes to tennis, hurtful game\r\n   To a weak stomach, and to tender eyes,\r\n   So down to sleep with Virgil, Horace lies.”--FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  “Two Hundred and Nine Days,” or “The Journal of a Traveller on the\r\n  Continent,” by Jefferson Hogg: London, 1827.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Pope’s Odyssey, lib. v.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  This etymology has been disputed, and it has been said that the\r\n  holding or keeping possession of the ball is no part of the game;\r\n  for, during the play, the ball is in continual motion, or passing\r\n  from one to another.

Plans were proposed, and\r\narrangements concluded for the furtherance of the object we have\r\nannounced; in short, in the brief space of an hour, the major had\r\ndetermined the course of his future life, and had framed schemes of\r\nhappiness, and visions of domestic peace, which he impatiently sought\r\nto realize. The vicar was detained by the major, but Mr. Seymour\r\nquitted Ivy Lodge and returned to his family. He found the children\r\nengaged in playing at marbles. Tom was displaying to his sisters many\r\ninstances of his adroitness and skill in shooting at and hitting\r\nmarbles.\r\n\r\n“Why, Tom!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “how came you possessed of such a\r\nmultitude of marbles?”\r\n\r\n“By luck; good luck, papa; I won them all before the holidays; and I\r\ncan assure you that my school-fellows acknowledge me as one of the best\r\nplayers at _ring-taw_ in the school.”\r\n\r\n“Justly, then, has your merit been rewarded,” said the father. “Have\r\nyou not read of the skilful Roman, who could blow peas through a quill,\r\nand deposit them with such nicety on the point of a pin, placed at some\r\ndistance, as rarely to miss his aim?”\r\n\r\n“And what was his reward?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“A bushel of peas, my boy, which the emperor commanded to be presented\r\nto him. But do not misunderstand me, far be it from my wish to\r\ndisparage your skill; whatever we undertake, we should endeavour to\r\naccomplish; I am, therefore, well pleased to find that you can play at\r\nmarbles with so much success.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder who invented marbles?” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“That question, my dear, must be addressed to Mr. Twaddleton, who, I\r\nhave no doubt, will immediately answer it.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had these words been spoken, when the vicar appeared on the\r\nlawn. Mr. Seymour informed him of the subject of their conversation,\r\nand added, that he had just told the children he was sure he would\r\nreadily answer their question.\r\n\r\n“Not so readily as you may imagine,” replied the vicar; “but I will\r\ntell you all I know upon the subject. It appears to be a very ancient\r\ngame; for it is stated by Suetonius, that Augustus, when a youth, spent\r\nmany hours in the day in playing with little Moorish boys ‘_cum\r\nnucibus_,’ that is, _with nuts_, which appear to have been then used in\r\nthe very way in which you now play with your marbles. In later times,\r\nround stones, picked out of gravel, were introduced for this purpose.\r\nThe marbles which you now hold in your hand are substitutes of still\r\nmore modern invention. The best of them are imported from Holland,\r\nwhere, as I have been informed, they are manufactured by grinding\r\nfragments of alabaster and of other stones, in an iron mill of a\r\npeculiar construction, in which there are several partitions furnished\r\nwith rasps, which turn with great velocity, by means of a stream of\r\nwater; and thus, having rounded the stones, project them out of\r\ndifferent holes for which their size may adapt them. Thus manufactured,\r\nthey are brought down the Rhine, and from thence dispersed throughout\r\nEurope; immense quantities are also exported to India and China. There\r\nare, however, as you well know, inferior kinds, which are of home\r\nmanufacture, and consist of potter’s clay covered with a glaze, and\r\nburnt in a furnace.”\r\n\r\n“I have often wondered what is the meaning of the words _taw_ and\r\n_ally_,” observed Tom.\r\n\r\n“Why, your _taw_ is a brown marble, and your _ally_, if I remember\r\nrightly, a very white one; is it not so?” asked the vicar.\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then,” said the vicar, “the words are clearly abbreviations\r\nof _tawny_ and _alabaster_.”\r\n\r\n“Now then,” said Mr. Seymour, “for a game; what is it to be, Tom?”\r\n\r\n“_Ring-taw_ for ever!” cried Tom; “it is the only game of marbles\r\nworthy of being played.”\r\n\r\n“It is really so long since I left school,” observed his father, “that\r\nI must beg you to refresh my memory, and give me some instructions\r\nabout this favourite game of yours.”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you all about it. We must first draw a circle, on which\r\neach player is to put a certain number of marbles to be previously\r\nagreed upon; we then make a mark at some distance, which is called the\r\n_offing_, and from which we are to shoot at the marbles in the ring.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very intelligible,” observed his father; “and I suppose\r\nthe object of the player is to shoot a marble out of the ring, which\r\nnot only gives him that marble, but entitles him to shoot again at\r\nanother, and so on, until he misses, or all the marbles are won.”\r\n\r\n“That is right, papa.”\r\n\r\n“And a good marksman,” observed the vicar, “who has the first shot, may\r\neasily win the game, before any other player can gain the opportunity\r\nof shooting at a single marble.”\r\n\r\n“I see that clearly,” said Mr. Seymour; “he may strike out a marble\r\nfrom the circle, and then shoot at another, and in this manner traverse\r\nthe whole ring; I therefore conclude, that good players will always\r\ndemand a large ring, or else there would not be much chance for any\r\none, except for him who played first.”\r\n\r\n“That is the game; but I must tell you,” said Tom, “that if the player\r\nshould leave his own marble in the ring, he is at once put out; and\r\nshould it be within a certain distance on the outside, an adversary may\r\nshoot at it, and by hitting it, put him also out of the game.”\r\n\r\n“I believe that I am now a perfect master of the subject,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour; “what say you, vicar?”\r\n\r\n“I understand it; and it appears to me to be capable of some scientific\r\ncalculation; but the practical results must, of course, differ very\r\nwidely from the theory, for the unevenness of the ground, and the\r\ninaccurate construction of the marble, are circumstances which never\r\ncan be duly estimated.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” replied Mr. Seymour; “these difficulties even exist at\r\nthe game of billiards(25), where the table is smooth and perfectly\r\nhorizontal: but we do not require perfect accuracy, an approximation to\r\nit will be sufficient for the purposes of illustration; we will,\r\ntherefore, if you please, proceed at once to the game, and I will\r\nendeavour to point out to Tom the nature and direction of the several\r\nforces by which each marble will be influenced.”\r\n\r\nTom, accordingly, like the son of Cornelius Scriblerus, converted his\r\nlegs into a pair of compasses, and described, with the toe of his shoe,\r\nthe necessary circle upon the ground. Each party, by agreement, placed\r\ntwo marbles upon the ring, and it fell to the lot of the vicar to open\r\nthe campaign. Mr. Twaddleton then advanced, and with the assumed air of\r\na true knight-errant, approached the ring, exclaiming with a loud\r\nvoice, and with a gesture of inexpressible drollery, “I demand gracious\r\nleave that I may be delivered of my vow, and forthwith combat in the\r\nlists;” so saying, he unfurled his red banner, and sounded a trumpet;\r\nor in more humble phraseology, he extracted his hand-kerchief from his\r\npocket, and applying it to his nasal organs, produced a loud and\r\nthrilling blast, which frightened every sparrow from its resting-place.\r\nAfter this preliminary ceremonial, he marshalled his limbs into the\r\nmost appropriate attitude, and thrusting one hand behind the exuberant\r\ntail of his coat, he, with the other, shot forth his missile at the\r\nlargest marble opposite to him. His _taw_ faithfully delivered its\r\nerrand, and inflicted such a blow upon the paunch of his antagonist,\r\nthat although nearly twice the size of its assailant, like a true\r\nbully, it skulked off, and retreated several feet beyond the lists;\r\nbut, alas! the little marble of the vicar, unlucky wight! was so\r\nstunned by the operation, that it staggered, and reeled backwards into\r\nthe ring, and thus, according to the established law of the field,\r\ncompleted by one act the total defeat of its luckless commander.\r\n\r\n“Your marble is left in the ring!” exclaimed Tom, with a shout of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n“I see how it happened,” said Mr. Seymour; “the vicar struck the marble\r\nplump, or ‘played a full ball,’ as we say at billiards, and the result\r\neasily admits of explanation. You already know that a marble possesses\r\nelasticity; when, therefore, the one in the ring was struck, it went\r\noff with a velocity equal to that with which the striking marble\r\napproached it, while the latter, in return, received a blow equal to\r\nthat it gave, which destroyed its motion. When we go back into the\r\nlibrary, I will exhibit a very pretty experiment in farther elucidation\r\nof this philosophical truth.”(26)\r\n\r\nIt was now Mr. Seymour’s turn to enter the lists. He carefully applied\r\nhis knuckles to the ground, and taking aim at a little marble which he\r\nhad selected as his victim, gallantly shot the missile from his thumb\r\nand finger; but, alas! alas! the goddess, whatever may be her name, who\r\npresides over this species of tournay, doubtless saw the impending fate\r\nof her favourite, and, after the example of Venus, who turned aside the\r\nweapon from Æneas, assumed the shape of a small pebble, and thus\r\narrested the fatal course of the marble, and gave it a new direction,\r\nwhich sent it curveting through the ring, without committing one single\r\nact of devastation.\r\n\r\n“Bravo! bravo!” exclaimed Tom, “it is now my turn.”\r\n\r\nThe boy, according to the usage of the field, might at once have won\r\nthe game by striking his father’s marble; but he was too magnanimous to\r\ntake such an advantage, and too eager to display his own skill, to cut\r\nthe game short by a manœuvre: he had determined to win his laurels by\r\nhard fighting and generalship. He accordingly proceeded to strike a\r\nring marble; in effecting which he had, like the vicar, challenged a\r\n_gigantic knight_ as his antagonist; but, instead of striking it\r\n_plump_, he struck its upper quarter, so that it was rolled out of the\r\nring, while the striking marble, imparting only a portion of its\r\nmomentum, continued to move forward after the impact. This course was\r\ngreeted with the acclamations of Mr. Seymour and the vicar, the latter\r\nof whom declared it to have been “nobly run,” and gallantly\r\naccomplished; and extracting a sixpence from his waistcoat pocket,\r\nexclaimed, after the manner of chivalry, “_Largesse, largesse_, glory\r\nto the sons of the brave! glory to the invincible knight of the taw!”\r\n\r\nThe boy had not only struck the marble out of the ring, but he had, at\r\nthe same time, contrived to place his own marble in the most favourable\r\nposition for his future operations; and, indeed, it may be here\r\nobserved, that in this consists the art of playing the game. It is\r\nalmost unnecessary to add that Tom won every marble in succession.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then proceeded to explain the laws of impact, by which the\r\nmovement of each marble was directed. He observed, that the subject\r\nembraced two propositions, viz. the direction of the _object_ marble\r\nafter having been struck, and that of the _striking_ marble after the\r\nstroke. He said that, if a straight line were drawn between the centres\r\nof the striking and object marbles, it would necessarily pass through\r\ntheir point of contact, and, if continued, would represent the path of\r\nthe latter after the blow. In order to find the direction of the\r\n_striking_ marble after the shock, he told him that he must imagine a\r\ntangent to the path of the _object_ ball drawn from its centre, and\r\nthen a line parallel to it, from the centre of the striking marble; the\r\nlatter of which would be the required path.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour now inquired whether there was any other game of marbles at\r\nwhich they could amuse themselves.\r\n\r\n“The game which we call ‘_lagging out_,’” replied the boy, “is amusing\r\nenough. It consists in striking your marble against the wall, and\r\nmaking it rebound, so as to hit any other marble that is placed at a\r\ncertain distance from it, or to come within a span of it.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said his father, “and, like _ring-taw_, it may be made\r\nsubservient to our purpose of illustrating the doctrine of forces;\r\nalthough I think that the principle of _reflected motion_ may be more\r\nreadily explained by the rebounding ball.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour here took the elastic ball, and threw it obliquely against\r\nthe wall, from which it rebounded in an opposite and equally oblique\r\ndirection. He then sketched the annexed figure, and proceeded as\r\nfollows:--“When I threw the ball against the wall B, in the direction\r\nA B, having struck it, it glanced off, making an angle, in its passage\r\nback again, equal to that which it made in its approach to the wall. If\r\nI draw the perpendicular B D, this fact will be rendered more apparent,\r\nand you will perceive that the angle A B D is equal to the angle C B D:\r\nthe former is termed the _angle of incidence_, the latter the _angle of\r\nreflection_; and these angles, remember, are always equal, provided the\r\nball under experiment be perfectly elastic.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing the physics of rebounding.]\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say,” asked Tom, “that the more obliquely I throw the\r\nball against the wall, the more obliquely it will rebound?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; that is my meaning: and see whether you cannot explain the\r\nfact, for it depends on the composition and resolution of the forces, a\r\nsubject which I should hope you thoroughly understand.”\r\n\r\nTom pondered for some time over the drawing, and at length observed,\r\nthat there was one difficulty which he could not immediately surmount.\r\n\r\n“State your difficulty,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to observe, that the force acting in the direction A B\r\nwould certainly be resolved into two others, viz. one in the direction\r\nF B, and another in that of D B; “because,” continued he, “these lines\r\nare the adjacent sides of the parallelogram, of which A B is the\r\ndiagonal; and I well know that whenever a force strikes obliquely, it\r\nis thus resolved.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very well explained,” replied his father; “pray proceed.”\r\n\r\n“Now comes the difficulty,” continued Tom; “for the force D B will of\r\ncourse be destroyed by the wall, and that represented by F B, which is\r\nthe only one that can remain, would carry the ball to E.”\r\n\r\n“It certainly would do so,” answered his father, “if the ball were\r\nperfectly devoid of elasticity; but remember that, in consequence of\r\nthis property, the force D B will be exchanged for one in an opposite\r\ndirection, B D.”\r\n\r\n“I had entirely overlooked the elasticity,” said Tom; “I now see my way\r\nclearly, for in that case there must be two forces acting in the\r\ndirections B D, B E, which will, of course, drive the ball down the\r\ndiagonal B C.”\r\n\r\n“Your demonstration is perfectly correct, my boy; and I think you will\r\nnow admit that I could not have adduced a more beautiful instance of\r\nthe composition and resolution of forces; for, in the first place, you\r\nresolve the diagonal force into two others, and then you recompound\r\nthese again to produce another diagonal one.”\r\n\r\n“But I think you told us that the angles of incidence and reflection\r\nwere only equal when the rebounding body was perfectly elastic.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing more physics of rebounding.]\r\n\r\n“Clearly so; the force D B must be exchanged for an equal one B D, or\r\nelse the angle A B D cannot be equal to the angle D B C; but I will\r\nrender this fact still farther intelligible by another diagram. Let B,\r\nas in the former case, represent the wall, upon which the imperfectly\r\nelastic body impinges in the direction A B.--The force will of course\r\nbe resolved into two others, viz. into D B and F B; the force D B,\r\nhowever, instead of being replaced by the opposite one B D, will now be\r\nrepresented by the shorter line B G; or that of B H or B I, according\r\nto the degree of elasticity. If we, therefore, complete the\r\nparallelogram, B C, B K, or B M will be the diagonal path of the body;\r\nmaking, as you perceive, the _angle of reflection_ D B C, greater than\r\nthat of _incidence_ A B D; and where the body is perfectly inelastic,\r\nthe force D B will be wholly destroyed, and, the force B E alone\r\nsurviving, the body will be carried along the line B E. I have now,”\r\ncontinued Mr. Seymour, “explained to you the principal laws which\r\ngovern those forces by which your ball or marbles are actuated. It is\r\ntrue that in practice you cannot expect the results should accurately\r\ncoincide with the theory, because, in the first place, you cannot\r\nobtain marbles that are of equal density and elasticity, and of true\r\nfigure; and, in the next, there will be obstacles against which it is\r\nimpossible to guard. The spinning of the marble will also have a\r\nmaterial influence on its motion, as we have already discovered. In the\r\ngame of billiards, where every obstacle is removed, as far as art can\r\nassist, the theory and practice are often strangely discordant. But we\r\nhave dwelt sufficiently upon the subject; we will, therefore, return to\r\nthe library, where I intend to exhibit an experiment in farther\r\nelucidation of the subject of collision.”\r\n\r\nThe party accordingly proceeded on their return.\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said Mr. Seymour, addressing himself to Mr. Twaddleton, who\r\nwas walking a few paces before him, “that the maiden ladies have not\r\nespied their vicar at a game of marbles; if they should, what a\r\nchuckling would there be at their next tea-party!”\r\n\r\n“A fig for the spinsters!” exclaimed the vicar, as he hastily turned\r\nround, and arrested the progress of the party by his gesture. “You\r\nreally speak, Mr. Seymour, as though it were derogatory to my character\r\nto descend from the more austere pursuits to the simple but innocent\r\namusements of youth. Let me remind you, sir, that the Persian\r\nambassadors found Agesilaus, the Lacedæmonian monarch, riding on a\r\nstick.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Mr. Seymour; “and the ambassadors found Henry the\r\nFourth playing on the carpet with his children; and it is said, that\r\nDomitian, after he had possessed himself of the Roman empire, amused\r\nhimself by catching flies; but these were kings: now I admit that\r\nphilosophers are monarchs, but monarchs are not always philosophers;\r\nyou must, therefore, produce some less objectionable authority, if you\r\nstand in need of such a sanction. Let me see whether I cannot assist\r\nyou; there was Socrates, if tradition speaks truly, who was partial to\r\nthe recreation of riding on a wooden horse, for which, as Valerius\r\nMaximus tells us, his pupil Alcibiades laughed at him.”\r\n\r\n“I care not who laughs at me,” exclaimed the vicar; “I enjoy the\r\namusements of youth, and agree with Dr. Paley, in regarding the\r\npleasure which they are made to afford, as a striking instance of the\r\nbeneficence of the Deity; and should you so far relax as to put your\r\nplan into execution, of writing a work upon juvenile sports, I hope you\r\nwill call upon me to compose a eulogy, by way of preface.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not forget your offer, depend upon it.”\r\n\r\n“Did not Archytas,” resumed the vicar,\r\n\r\n          “‘He who would scan the earth, and ocean’s bound,\r\n          And tell the countless sands that strew the shore,’\r\n\r\nas Horace says, invent the children’s rattle?--Toys, my dear sir, have\r\nserved to unbend the wise, to occupy the idle, to exercise the\r\nsedentary, to moralize the dissipated,”--\r\n\r\n“And,” interrupted Mr. Seymour, “to instruct the ignorant.”\r\n\r\n“I will also convince you,” continued the vicar, “that the tournaments\r\nwere indebted for their origin to the Troy game (_ludus Trojæ_), first\r\nintroduced into Italy by young Ascanius.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing episode having been concluded, the party proceeded,\r\nwithout any farther interruption, to the Lodge. On their arrival, Mr.\r\nSeymour produced a piece of apparatus, for the purpose of exhibiting\r\nthe experiment he had promised, in illustration of the doctrine of the\r\nCollision of Elastic Bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two balls, labeled A and B, hanging by strings from a\r\nrod and bouncing against each other.]\r\n\r\n“Here are two ivory balls,” said he, “suspended by threads; I shall\r\ndraw one of them, A, a little on one side; now I let it go, it strikes,\r\nyou see, against the other ball, B, and drives it off to a distance\r\nequal to that through which the first ball fell; but the motion of A is\r\nstopped, because, when it struck B, it received in return a blow equal\r\nto that it gave, and its motion was consequently destroyed. To extend\r\nthe experiment, here are six ivory balls hanging in a row; I will draw\r\nthe first out of the perpendicular, and let it fall against the second;\r\nsee! see! none of the balls appear to move except the last, which you\r\nperceive flies off as far as the first ball fell. I should like to hear\r\nyou explain this.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Six balls hanging by strings from a rod and bouncing\r\nagainst each other, but with only the two balls on the ends moving.]\r\nTom observed, that when the first ball struck the second, it received a\r\nblow, in return, which destroyed its motion; and that the second ball,\r\nalthough it did not appear to move, must have struck against the third,\r\nthe reaction of which set it at rest; that the action of the third ball\r\nmust have been destroyed by the reaction of the fourth, and so on,\r\nuntil motion was communicated to the last ball, which not being reacted\r\nupon flew off.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour commended Tom for his explanation; but he begged him to\r\nunderstand that such an effect only occurred when the balls were\r\nelastic; and he proceeded to exhibit the difference between elastic and\r\ninelastic bodies by another experiment. “When you raise one of these\r\ninelastic balls, made of clay, out of the perpendicular, and let it\r\nfall against the other, E, the action and reaction not being augmented\r\nby the force of elasticity, are insufficient to destroy the motion of\r\nthe former; only part of the motion D will, therefore, be communicated\r\nto E, and the two balls will move together to _d e_, which are less\r\ndistant from the vertical line than the ball D was before it fell.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two suspended, inelastic balls, labeled D and E ,\r\nshowing positions after D collides with E]\r\n\r\nBefore we close this chapter, we cannot resist the pleasure of\r\ninforming our readers that Major Snapwell, in company with his legal\r\nadviser, had quitted Overton, for the purpose of making such\r\npreliminary arrangements as the purchase of an estate must necessarily\r\nrequire.

On\r\nbeing ushered into the library, they were not a little surprised and\r\nstartled by the loud voice of the major, who, addressing Mr.\r\nTwaddleton, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n“Never will I again suspect the antiquity of your rarities, nor\r\nquestion the rarity of your antiquities.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. and Mrs. Seymour,” said the major, “welcome to Osterley Park. You\r\nfind me, as usual, engaged with our friend in a learned controversy,\r\nand I begin to fear that my warmth may have offended him.”\r\n\r\n“Offended me!” exclaimed the vicar, “oh no. No, indeed, my dear Major\r\nSnapwell; a difference of opinion on an antiquarian subject may excite\r\nmy regret, and in some cases, as in the present instance, awaken my\r\npity; but it cannot offend me; it can never occasion any feeling like\r\nanger: that would be to visit the folly of others upon myself.”\r\n\r\n“What is the subject of your difference, gentlemen?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“The evidences of druidical rites, as deducible from certain cavities\r\nto be found in granitic rocks, and which have received the appellation\r\nof _rock basins_,” replied the major.\r\n\r\n“And of which,” exclaimed Mr. Twaddleton, “I have a most unquestionable\r\nspecimen, collected by no less a geologist than the curator of the\r\ncabinet at Penzance, from that ancient metropolis of the druids,\r\n_Carn-bre hill_.”\r\n\r\n“I admit,” said the major, “that I never before saw so perfect a\r\nspecimen; it is as spheroidal internally, as if it had been actually\r\nshaped by a turning-lathe.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, in spite of such evidence,” replied the vicar, “you question\r\nits sacred origin, and deny its ever having been used as a pool of\r\nlustration.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour here interposed. “Upon a subject of purely historical\r\ndifficulty, I might feel diffident in offering myself as an umpire\r\nbetween such learned antiquaries; but, as the origin of ‘rock basins’\r\ninvolves a geological question, I will venture to deliver an opinion.\r\nDepend upon it, vicar, that you are maintaining a position that cannot\r\nbe defended; these uncouth cavities, together with all the fancied\r\nstatuary of Borlase(27), never been shaped by any chisel but the tooth\r\nof time, nor have any artists but the elements been engaged in their\r\nformation.”\r\n\r\n“What say you to that, vicar?” triumphantly exclaimed the major.\r\n\r\n“Oh, impiety, impiety!” cried the vicar;--\r\n\r\n           “‘Hostis habet muros, ruit alto a culmine Troja,’\r\n\r\nas Maro has it. That such glorious monuments, which have so long braved\r\nthe tempests, should fall under the hammer of these Philistines!\r\nGeology, Mr. Seymour, is infidelity in masquerade; remember the mites\r\nin the Cheshire cheese, Mr. Seymour, ‘consider their ways and be wise.’”\r\n\r\n“Philistines as we are, in your opinion,” replied his opponent, “our\r\nforges have served to sharpen your weapons against the attacks of\r\ninfidelity.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, gentlemen,” said Mr. Seymour, “the continuance of this\r\ndiscussion can neither amuse nor instruct us. I have, however, some\r\nintelligence to communicate which will soothe every feeling of\r\nirritation. We have received a letter from Isabella Villers, in answer\r\nto an invitation to Overton, and she graciously accepts it, and\r\nproposes being with us on Wednesday next.”\r\n\r\nThe major was delighted, and conversed upon various points connected\r\nwith the intended union of his nephew with that lady, which we do not\r\nthink it necessary to relate in this place. The vicar and major shook\r\nhands, and it was proposed that they should dine at Overton Lodge the\r\nfollowing day, and, as a specific overture, that the major should visit\r\nthe vicarage in his way, and again inspect some of the disputed\r\nantiquities of the reverend collector.\r\n\r\nThe following morning was occupied with the consideration of those\r\ndifferent toys which are indebted for their operation to the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n“Tom,” said Mr. Seymour, “fetch hither your leathern sucker.”\r\n\r\n“John is, at this moment, amusing himself in the garden with the one\r\nwhich I brought with me from school,” replied Tom.\r\n\r\n“Then you shall construct another for yourself. Here is leather and\r\nstring.”\r\n\r\n“This leather is too stiff; but I may, perhaps, make it answer the\r\npurpose by first soaking it.”\r\n\r\nHaving allowed it to remain in water for a short time, the leather\r\nbecame sufficiently pliable for his purpose; he therefore cut it into a\r\ncircular shape, and affixed a string through its centre. The juvenile\r\nparty now hastened to the lawn, and having once again dipped his\r\nnewly-constructed sucker into the water, the ingenious boy placed it\r\nupon a stone, pressed down the leather with his foot, and succeeded in\r\nmaking it raise the weight.\r\n\r\n“Well done, my boy! Now, then, explain the reason of the leather’s\r\nadhesion to the surface, and of its being thus capable of retaining its\r\nhold, notwithstanding the gravity of the stone.”\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” answered Tom, “the edges of the wet leather, from\r\nbeing closely pressed, stuck with sufficient firmness to the smooth\r\nsurface of the stone, to resist the force of the string as I pulled it\r\nupwards; the consequence was, that a hollow was formed in the middle\r\npart of the leather; and, as that hollow place cannot contain any air,\r\nit is called a _vacuum_.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied his father, “so far you are right; but you have\r\nnot informed me in what manner a _vacuum_ acts in preventing the stone\r\nfrom quitting the leather.”\r\n\r\n“It makes it adhere to it by some kind of _suction_, but I confess that\r\nI do not exactly understand the subject.”\r\n\r\n“Then let us proceed cautiously and deliberately in the explanation. In\r\nthe first place, you have said, and said correctly, that the edges of\r\nthe leather adhere to the stone; but what is the nature of the power to\r\nwhich this adhesion is to be referred? I perceive you are puzzled by\r\nthe question: attend, then, to my explanation: you must know that there\r\nexists a tendency in all bodies to adhere together, provided the\r\ncontact of their surfaces be sufficiently perfect; this property is\r\ntermed _cohesion_, or cohesive attraction, from the Latin word\r\n_cohæreo_, which I need not inform you signifies to _stick together_.\r\nThe dry leather will not adhere to a smooth surface, because, in that\r\ncase, the contact cannot be rendered sufficiently perfect; but, when\r\nsaturated with water, the interstices of the leather are filled with\r\nthat fluid, and the inequalities of the surface, which must always\r\nprevent close contact, are removed. If two bodies, when placed\r\ntogether, be not sufficiently smooth, or polished, it will be vain to\r\nmake any attempt to produce their cohesion; since the particles will,\r\nin such a state, touch each other only in a few points; it is for this\r\nreason that carpenters, when they intend to glue pieces of wood\r\ntogether, plane the surfaces perfectly smooth, before they apply the\r\nglue.”\r\n\r\nTom here acknowledged that he had not before understood the reason of\r\nthe leather’s adhesion to the stone.\r\n\r\n“Having, then, settled this point to your satisfaction,” continued Mr.\r\nSeymour, “let us proceed. Your idea of a _vacuum_ being formed in the\r\nhollow part of the leather is perfectly correct: for, as you draw up\r\nthe central part by the string, the hollow thus produced must\r\nnecessarily be a _vacuum_, since the air cannot pass through the\r\nleather to supply it; in this state, therefore, the atmosphere presses\r\nupon the exterior of the leather, and like any other weight prevents\r\nits rising from the stone.”\r\n\r\nFanny and Louisa here expressed some surprise on hearing of the weight\r\nof the atmosphere; the former observed, that she did not feel any\r\npressure from it. Their father explained the reason of their not being\r\nconscious of the weight, by informing them that their bodies contained\r\nair, which, by its elasticity, counteracted the pressure from without;\r\nbut that, if it were possible to remove all the air which the body\r\ncontained, the pressure of the atmosphere would not be counteracted;\r\nand the consequence would be, that we should be flattened like a\r\npancake by its weight, which had been ascertained by experiment to be\r\nequal to fifteen pounds upon every square inch of surface, or, as much\r\nas forty thousand pounds upon the body of a man of ordinary size.\r\n\r\n“Until your explanation,” said Tom, “I really believed that the leather\r\nadhered to the stone by some kind of _suction_, just as the back of my\r\nhand adheres to my lips, whenever I place it to my mouth, and draw in\r\nmy breath.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour here expressed a doubt whether his son was even yet a\r\nperfect master of the subject: he told him that there was no such\r\noperation in nature as _suction_; that it was merely a popular term to\r\ndenote the action of the air upon a vacuum. “Your hand,” said he,\r\n“adheres to your mouth, in consequence of your forming a vacuum within\r\nit, by forcibly drawing in your breath, and the resistance which is\r\nopposed to its removal arises entirely from the pressure of the\r\natmosphere upon it. Many are the effects which may be explained upon a\r\nsimilar principle. I dare say you well remember the astonishment which\r\nyou expressed at the force with which the limpets attached themselves\r\nto the rocks.”\r\n\r\n“O yes, papa,” exclaimed Louisa, “I well remember, when we walked on\r\nthe sea-shore, that, on first touching the limpets, they appeared loose\r\nand moveable, but before I had time to remove them, they fastened\r\nthemselves as firmly as though they had been a part of the rock upon\r\nwhich they were fixed; how could that happen?”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour replied, that these sea-insects possessed the power of\r\nconverting their whole bodies into _suckers_; and he informed them,\r\nthat many other animals were endowed with a similar faculty. He\r\ninstanced the claws of the polypus, which are furnished with many such\r\nsuckers, by means of which the animal is enabled to hold to whatever it\r\nattaches itself, with very considerable force.\r\n\r\n“Have you never observed,” asked Mr. Seymour, “the security and ease\r\nwith which flies frequently walk upon a smooth wall, or a pane of\r\nglass, or even along the ceiling, with their bodies downward?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” replied Tom; “but are not their legs provided with some\r\nsticky matter, which enables them to preserve themselves from falling?”\r\n\r\n“That is a popular error, my dear; the fact is, that their feet are\r\nprovided with little cups, or suckers, which they alternately exhaust\r\nand fill with air; by which means they are enabled to walk in every\r\nposition, over the most slippery surfaces.(28) In like manner, the\r\nwalrus, or seal, a painting of which you may remember to have seen in\r\nthe Panorama of Spitzbergen, is capable of climbing the masses of\r\nslippery ice with perfect security.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Tom’s stone fell from the sucker. Louisa enquired how\r\nit could have happened.\r\n\r\n“The circumstance is to be easily explained,” said her father. “The\r\natmosphere, by its pressure, ultimately forced its way through the\r\nedges of the sucker; its interior, therefore, became filled with air,\r\nand it consequently balanced the external weight, which had before\r\nconfined it.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said the vicar, “that Tom must now surely understand the\r\ntheory of the leathern sucker; what say you, my boy? Cannot you exclaim\r\nwith Persius, ‘_Intus_ et in _cute_ novi.’”\r\n\r\n“Which I suppose,” observed Mr. Seymour, “you would construe, ‘Well do\r\nI know the nature of the _cavity_, and the operation of the _leather_.’”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” answered the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Then never more protest against the vice of punning, for a more\r\natrocious specimen of the _lusus verborum_ was never sported by the\r\nmost incorrigible Johnian: but, to your classical fancy, any object\r\nenclosed in a Latin shrine appears as a deity.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar had just drawn up his person into a suitable attitude for\r\ncombat, and would, no doubt, have defended himself against this\r\nunexpected attack with his usual address, had not a circumstance\r\noccurred, which put an abrupt termination to the discourse.\r\n\r\n“See! see!” exclaimed Louisa; “what can have happened? There is Jerry\r\nStyles, with a crowd of villagers, running towards us in the greatest\r\nstate of agitation and alarm.”\r\n\r\n“Jerry Styles? It is, indeed, as you say, my faithful clerk,” cried the\r\nvicar. “Bless me,--bless me, what can have happened! Is the vicarage on\r\nfire? Has the old roof at last tumbled into the chancel?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir!--oh, my dear sir!” vociferated the terrified servant of the\r\nchurch, whose blanched cheeks made his red nose appear like a volcano\r\nburning amidst a desert of snows, “poor Tom Plank has blown the roof\r\noff his house, and is so dreadfully wounded that it is impossible for\r\nhim to survive long, if, indeed, he is not already dead.”\r\n\r\n“How did it happen?” exclaimed several voices.\r\n\r\n“From a _speriment_! a _speriment_! it all came from a _flossical\r\nsperiment_!” replied the breathless clerk; “but, pray, gentlemen, come\r\ndirectly to the village; for mercy’s sake, gentlemen, don’t delay a\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar and Mr. Seymour instantly proceeded with the terrified Jerry\r\nStyles towards the house of the unfortunate “planer of deals;” they had\r\nnot gone far before they met several other villagers, who informed them\r\nthat Dr. Doseall was in attendance upon the wounded man, and had\r\npronounced him to be in the greatest danger.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the house, the roof of which they at once perceived\r\nhad not suffered in the fray, they learned that Tom Plank had been\r\nengaged in some experiments for producing a _vacuum_, in the\r\nprosecution of his new scheme of propelling passengers through a\r\nfunnel; and that, in firing a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases, he\r\nhad neglected the usual precaution, and blown up his apparatus; the\r\nstop-cock had been unceremoniously expelled through the window, and, in\r\nits passage, had ungraciously flown in the face of its master, and left\r\nthe traces of its indignation in the form of a very slight scratch upon\r\nhis forehead; this accident, with a burn of the fingers, was the only\r\npersonal injury he had sustained.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Mr. Seymour, “no mischief has occurred, and the\r\naccident will, I trust, teach you more caution for the future. You are\r\nnot the first adventurer who has _burned_ his _fingers_ by _bubble_\r\nspeculations, and in vain attempts to _raise the wind_.”\r\n\r\nDr. Doseall, however, with a countenance of stern composure, and a\r\nportentous shake of the head, maintained that the accident was by no\r\nmeans so trifling as Mr. Seymour appeared to suppose; and, in\r\nconformity with this view of the case, he had prudently bled his\r\npatient largely, and directed sundry mixtures and lotions, together\r\nwith a _quantum sufficit_ of laudanum, in order, as he said, “to keep\r\ndown the swelling and puffing of the head,” although there were those\r\npresent who were uncharitable enough to hint, that the _swelling_ and\r\n_puffing_ related rather to the Doctor’s bill and character, than to\r\nthe patient’s pericranium.\r\n\r\nAfter a short interval, engaged in answering the numerous enquiries of\r\nthe anxious spectators, the doctor, with an air of awful solemnity,\r\nadvanced to the sufferer, and offered him a bolus of no ordinary size;\r\nupon the virtues of which he descanted in most touching language.\r\n\r\n“Avaunt!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “do you suppose that Tom Plank has the\r\nthroat of the great dragon which the Indians believe to swallow the\r\nmoon, and thus to produce the phænomena of lunar eclipses? Away with\r\nthy treacle and pipe-clay; there cannot be the least pretext for this\r\nparade of remedies; I warrant you that Dame Nature, unless she be put\r\nout of humour by your officious interference, will heal the scratch\r\nbefore to-morrow’s sunrise.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor, as our readers will readily imagine, was very justly\r\nincensed at this ex-professional interference. His first determination\r\nwas to treat the matter as a joke, and to turn the laugh against the\r\nunmannerly intruder; but the abortive smile was strangled in its birth,\r\nand suffused the hue of death over his visage. Never did a countenance,\r\nin the focus of his blue window bottle, by candle-light, exhibit a more\r\nghastly pallor; and we can scarcely predict what might have been the\r\nconsequence, had he not instantly administered a consoling cordial to\r\nhis nostrils; for, be it known, that the doctor took snuff in the same\r\nextravagant proportion as his patients took physic. Having by these\r\nmeans recovered his self-possession, he instantly seized his cane, and\r\nwaving it with as much dignity as Jove is said to brandish his thunder,\r\nhe departed in deep dudgeon, which was betrayed by a snarl, not unlike\r\nthat of a hungry dog who is unexpectedly despoiled of a savory bone,\r\nand by a contortion of the face, similar to that we have observed in a\r\nchild who has unfortunately mistaken Aloes for Liquorice.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the man of wrath and phials retreated from the field of\r\nblood, than Mr. Twaddleton advanced to the suffering artist, deeming\r\nthe moment of bodily fear as affording a favourable opportunity for an\r\nattempt to reclaim him from the error of his ways. “Tom Plank,” said\r\nhe, in a mild tone, “hadst thou given ear to the warning voice of thy\r\nspiritual pastor, and, instead of ridiculing his advice at the sixpenny\r\nclub, hadst, like a true Christian and worthy parishioner, given heed\r\nunto it, thou wouldst not, at this time, have been placed in such\r\nbodily peril. Mr. Seymour has consoled thee by his opinion; sincerely\r\nshall I pray that his judgment may be confirmed by the result, and that\r\nthe visitation may have a salutary influence upon thy future conduct.\r\nQuit the pursuit of these bubbles, and leave wiser men to investigate\r\nthe secrets of nature; let me exhort thee to return to thy craft, sow\r\nwhere thou canst reap; we cannot have figs from thorns, nor grapes from\r\nthistles; remember the proverb, ‘an emmet may work its heart out, but\r\ncan never make honey.’ One word more and I have done--suffer not the\r\nartist whose profit it is to furnish thee with materials, to flatter\r\nand cajole thee--‘the dog wags his tail, not for thee, but for thy\r\nbread.’”\r\n\r\nAs the party left the house, they met Mrs. Seymour, with Tom and\r\nLouisa, whose looks sufficiently testified the anxiety they had\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\n“Is it all over? Is he dead?” asked Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“No, no; he is quite safe; it was an extremely slight accident,\r\nalthough Doseall wished us to believe that it was likely to terminate\r\nin some dreadful manner. The vicar thinks that it may prove the means\r\nof driving science _out_ of Tom Plank’s head, and I intend to make it\r\nsubservient to driving it still farther _into_ ours.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” cried Tom.\r\n\r\n“I mean that it was an extremely apposite accident for illustrating the\r\nsubject upon which we were engaged at the moment of interruption.”\r\n\r\n“This is the second accident then,” observed Louisa, “that will have\r\nserved us in our scientific studies. What a philosopher,” continued\r\nshe, “must Dr. Doseall become, if he profit by every accident he\r\nwitnesses!”\r\n\r\n“Knowledge, my dear girl, is not promoted by the opportunity of seeing,\r\nbut by the faculty of skilfully observing, and reflecting upon what we\r\nsee; were it otherwise, the merit of a traveller might be at once\r\nestimated by the number of shoes he had worn out. Whenever, therefore,\r\nyou hear of a discovery having been made _by accident_, do not, on that\r\naccount, depreciate the merits of its author. It is certainly true,\r\nthat many an important truth has been brought to light from some casual\r\nobservation(29), but the dexterity with which such observation was\r\napplied constitutes the merit of the discoverer. Well, but to show in\r\nwhat manner the accident of Tom Plank bears upon the subject under\r\ndiscussion:--He had ignorantly fired a quantity of oxygen and hydrogen\r\ngases in a tin vessel; the consequence of the combustion was the\r\nimmediate formation of a _vacuum_: and what happened? Why, the pressure\r\nof the external air, not being any longer balanced by elastic matter in\r\nthe interior of the apparatus, crushed it with violence, as any other\r\nenormous weight might have done; and so ended the accident, which\r\nreport magnified into a most awful catastrophe.”\r\n\r\nAs the party proceeded on their way home, they continued to discourse\r\non the subject of the air’s pressure.\r\n\r\n“If the atmosphere exerts so enormous a pressure, and has so much\r\nweight,” observed Louisa, “it is strange that it should not fall down\r\non the earth.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour replied, “that the air was a peculiar fluid, which, from\r\nits elastic properties, was distinguished by the term of an _elastic\r\nfluid_, the particles of which were too far distant from each other to\r\nexert any cohesive attraction amongst themselves.”\r\n\r\n“But I suppose,” said Tom, “that it gravitates, or is attracted by the\r\nearth; what then can be the reason, as Louisa says, that it does not\r\nfall, like any other body, to the ground?”\r\n\r\n“And so it actually does,” replied Mr. Seymour. “The lower stratum of\r\nthe atmosphere rests upon the ground, but the strata above it do not\r\nfall, because they are supported by the particles beneath them, in the\r\nsame manner as the water at the surface of a basin is supported by that\r\nat the bottom: the only difference in these two cases arises from the\r\none being an elastic, and the other an inelastic fluid; so that the air\r\nafter compression resumes its original dimensions; and since the\r\natmosphere, by the action of gravity, is always in a state of\r\ncompression, so is it always endeavouring to expand itself.”\r\n\r\n“If, then, the force of gravity were diminished,” observed Louisa, “the\r\nair would become much lighter, and I suppose that is the true reason of\r\nits being so much less dense in the upper regions.”\r\n\r\n“Scarcely,” replied her father. “Have you forgotten the explanation[36]\r\nwhich I lately gave you, of the diminution in the weight of bodies at a\r\ndistance from the earth’s surface?”\r\n\r\n“I recollect it perfectly,” exclaimed Tom; “and it explained to us the\r\nreason that a marble fell from the top of a house, and from the ball of\r\nSt. Paul’s with the same velocity.”\r\n\r\n“And yet I am quite sure,” said Louisa, “that I have lately read an\r\naccount of the air being so extremely light upon the top of a high\r\nmountain as to affect the breath and occasion great uneasiness.”\r\n\r\n“I do not deny the fact, my dear; I only question your explanation of\r\nits cause. Can it not, think you, be accounted for upon some other\r\nprinciple than that of the diminished force of gravity?”\r\n\r\nLouisa was unable to suggest any other probable reason.\r\n\r\n“The fact, then,” said her father, “is simply this; since the air is\r\nelastic, or capable of yielding to pressure, so, of course, the lower\r\nparts must be more dense, or in a greater state of compression than\r\nthose which are above them. In a pile of fleeces of wool, are not the\r\nlower fleeces pressed together by the weight of the superior ones, and\r\ndo they not lie light and loose, in proportion as they approach the\r\nuppermost fleece, which receives no external pressure, and is confined\r\nmerely by the force of its own gravity?”\r\n\r\n“Clearly,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Well then, we will suppose, for example, that the whole column of the\r\natmosphere were divided into a hundred parts, and that each of these\r\nparts weighed an ounce; would not the earth, and all things on its\r\nsurface, be, in such a case, pressed upon with the whole hundred\r\nounces?”\r\n\r\n“No one can deny that,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“The lowest stratum of air,” continued Mr. Seymour, “would be pressed\r\nupon by the ninety-nine ounces above it; the next by ninety-eight; and\r\nso on, until we arrived at the ninety-ninth stratum from the bottom,\r\nwhich would, of course, be subjected to no more than one ounce of\r\npressure, or to the weight of the last and highest stratum.”\r\n\r\nThe children were perfectly satisfied with this simple explanation; and\r\nTom enquired whether, for the same reason, the water at the bottom of\r\nthe sea must not be very dense, and unlike that we are accustomed to\r\nobserve on the surface: his father, however, corrected this notion, by\r\nstating that water, not being, like air, elastic and compressible,\r\nwould not suffer any material diminution in volume, although pressed\r\neven by the enormous weight of the superincumbent ocean.(30)\r\n\r\n“I have before alluded to the relative compressibility of air and\r\nwater, and the present appears a good opportunity for proving the fact\r\nby an amusing experiment. See! here are the ‘_Bottle Imps_,’ vicar,\r\nwhich you may remember I promised to introduce to your respectful\r\nnotice,” said Mr. Seymour. “In this jar of water, carefully closed, as\r\nyou may perceive, by parchment, are two little enamelled figures, which\r\nshall be made to rise and fall, by alternately pressing upon and\r\nremoving the hand from the cover: thus.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two devil-like figures within an upturned bottle\r\nbouncing about.]\r\n\r\n“Why, the spirit of Simon Magus must surely possess thee!” exclaimed\r\nthe vicar.\r\n\r\nThe children, as may be readily imagined, were much astonished at so\r\nsingular an effect, and expressed much anxiety to be informed by what\r\nmechanism it was produced. Their father accordingly proceeded with the\r\nfollowing explanation.\r\n\r\n“I have here,” said he, “a figure exactly similar to those in the\r\nbottle, which we will now examine. You will observe, that in its centre\r\nthere is a cavity terminating in a small orifice in the lower part;\r\nthis cavity may be made to contain any quantity of air, so as to give\r\nthe required buoyancy to the figure: now mark!--I press my hand upon\r\nthe parchment cover, and the figure, you perceive, descends; I now\r\nremove the pressure, and see, it immediately reascends. The water in\r\nthe bottle, as I have told you, is incompressible; when, therefore, I\r\npress upon the surface, it rises into the interior of the figure, and,\r\nconsequently, by compressing the air into a less space, renders it less\r\nbuoyant; but no sooner is the hand removed, than the enclosed air\r\nresumes its former volume, and expels the intruding water; in\r\nconsequence of which the figure regains its former lightness, and\r\nreascends. Do you understand me?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” said Tom, “and many thanks for the explanation;” and in\r\nthis opinion did the whole party concur.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” continued Mr. Seymour, “you will now understand the use\r\nof the air-bladder in fish, for it is constructed upon a precisely\r\nsimilar principle. When the fish desires to descend, it presses upon\r\nthe bladder by means of its muscles, and thus condenses the included\r\nair into a smaller volume.”[37]\r\n\r\n“I now also perceive why the water at the bottom of the sea cannot be\r\nmuch more dense than that on the surface; but, if we could dig a pit to\r\nthe centre of the earth, the air, in that case, would be highly dense,\r\nbecause, unlike water, it is compressible,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“The density of the air,” replied his father, “would, undoubtedly,\r\nmaterially increase as we descended. It has been calculated that, at\r\nthe distance of thirty miles below the surface, the air would have the\r\nsame density as water; and, at the depth of forty-two miles, that of\r\nquicksilver; while, at the centre, it would be more solid than any\r\nsubstance of which we have any idea, for its density would be thousands\r\nof millions of times greater than that of mercury.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then informed his young pupils, that after the lesson they\r\nhad just received, they would never again be puzzled by the motions of\r\nthe barometer, which had so often excited their wonder.\r\n\r\n“As the quicksilver is contained in a closed tube, I do not exactly\r\nunderstand how the air can act upon it; and if the tube were not\r\nclosed, it would of course run out from its weight,” observed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“You are altogether in error,” said her father. “In the first place,”\r\nhe continued, “I will show you that the bulb at the lower extremity of\r\nthe tube is open, in order that the quicksilver may freely communicate\r\nwith the atmosphere, upon which, indeed, its action entirely depends;\r\nwhile the upper space is a perfect vacuum, so as to obviate any\r\ncounteracting pressure. As to the quicksilver running out, have you so\r\nsoon forgotten that the air presses upon every body on the surface of\r\nthe earth, in the proportion of about fifteen pounds upon every square\r\ninch? Now it is from this circumstance that the column of quicksilver\r\nis sustained in the tube, the ascent and descent of which thus\r\nindicates the varying pressure of the atmosphere; so that, when the\r\nbarometer falls, we know the air presses less heavily upon the earth,\r\nand the contrary when it rises.”\r\n\r\n“That I understand: but what can cause the pressure of the air to vary\r\nat different times?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Cannot you imagine the atmosphere to be an airy ocean, and to be\r\ntherefore thrown into enormous waves, so that we may sometimes have a\r\nlonger column of air above us than at other times; this is one\r\nexplanation, there may be other causes not so intelligible,” answered\r\nMr. Seymour. “But enough of this for the present. Now, before we quit\r\nthe subject of the air’s elasticity, let us consider the philosophy of\r\nthe _pop-gun_; an amusement with which, I have no doubt, you are well\r\nacquainted.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I am, papa; but do you allude to the quill, or to the wooden\r\npop-gun?”\r\n\r\n“The principle in both is the same; tell me, therefore, the origin and\r\nnature of the force which enables you to shoot your pellet to so\r\nconsiderable a distance.”\r\n\r\n“It depends upon the action of the air,” replied Tom.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly: but your answer is too general; I wished you to state, in\r\nprecise terms, the changes which the air undergoes upon this occasion.\r\nYou first ram in your pellet to the further end of the tube, do you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure; and then I drive in a second pellet, and on forcing this\r\nforward, the first flies out with prodigious force.”\r\n\r\n“Very well: now examine what takes place; on propelling forward your\r\nsecond pellet, you condense the air which is enclosed between the two,\r\nuntil its elastic force becomes so great as to overcome the friction of\r\nthe first pellet; thus released, the air expands with considerable\r\nforce, and imparts a rapid motion to the pellet.”\r\n\r\n“I have frequently heard of the air-gun,” said Louisa; “I suppose it\r\ndepends upon a similar principle.”\r\n\r\n“It does; and it affords a very striking example of the surprising\r\nforce which air is capable of exerting, when condensed to a\r\nconsiderable degree; for, by means of this instrument, bullets may be\r\npropelled with a force very nearly equal to that of gunpowder.”\r\n\r\n“It is a curious fact,” observed the vicar, “that although the air-pump\r\nis a modern invention, yet the air-gun, which is so nearly allied to it\r\nin the construction of its valves and condensing syringe, should have\r\nexisted long antecedent to it; for it is recorded that an air-gun was\r\nmade for Henry IV. by Marin, of Lisieux, in Normandy, as early as 1408;\r\nand another was preserved in the armoury at Schmetau, bearing the date\r\nof 1474.”\r\n\r\n“But the air-gun of the present day,” said Mr. Seymour, “is very\r\ndifferent from that which was formerly made, and which, like the\r\npop-gun, discharged but one bullet, and that after a long and tedious\r\nprocess of condensation, while it is now made to discharge five or six\r\nwithout any visible variation of force, and will even act upon a dozen,\r\nbut with less effect.”\r\n\r\n“I feel very curious to learn something more about this air-gun,” said\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n“There is a reservoir for the condensed air,” replied Mr. Seymour,\r\n“which is secured by a nicely constructed valve, and which is made to\r\nopen by pulling the trigger of the gun, so that a portion only of the\r\nair is disengaged, which, rushing into the barrel, gives motion to the\r\nball.”\r\n\r\n“But how is the condensed air introduced into the reservoir?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“By means of a condensing syringe,” replied his father; “but I will\r\ntake an opportunity of exhibiting the instrument in operation.”\r\n\r\nThe reader will be pleased to recollect that the major agreed to pay a\r\npassing visit to the vicarage; it now becomes our duty to record what\r\nhappened upon that memorable occasion; and we, perhaps, cannot better\r\nrepresent the nature of the discussion that took place than by relating\r\nthe account as it was given by the belligerent parties themselves in\r\nconversation with Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen,” said Mr. Seymour, “is it peace or war? I trust you\r\nhave amicably adjusted all your differences.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” answered the vicar, “I have just reason to complain of\r\nthe major’s unjustifiable scepticism upon points that are perfectly\r\nunquestionable.”\r\n\r\n“You continue then to smart under the major’s stinging criticisms,\r\n‘_majore sub hoste_.’ There is a Latin pun for your consolation,” said\r\nMr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“The vicar alludes, I suppose,” said the major, “to the doubt I\r\nexpressed respecting the authenticity of his leathern money?”\r\n\r\n“That is one of the many subjects upon which, I must say, you have\r\nbetrayed a deficiency in historical knowledge. Seneca informs us that\r\nthere was anciently stamped money of leather; and the same thing was\r\nput in practice by Frederick II. at the siege of Milan; to say nothing\r\nof an old tradition amongst ourselves, that, in the confused times of\r\nthe barons’ wars, the same expedient was practised in England.”\r\n\r\n“You strangely mistake me,” replied the major; “I never questioned the\r\ntruth of these historical statements; I know full well that numerous\r\nsubstances have, at different times, and in different countries, been\r\nadopted in exchange, as conventional representatives of property. I\r\nhave already stated that cattle were employed as the earliest measure\r\nof value (31). We find, for instance, in Homer, that the golden armour\r\nof Glaucus was valued at a hundred, and that of Diomedes, at ten oxen.\r\nAmong the Indians, _cowries_, or small shells, are used; and the\r\nAbyssinians employ salt, bricks, and beads for this very purpose; the\r\nancient Britons are said to have circulated iron rings as money. The\r\nHollanders, we know, coined great quantities of pasteboard in the year\r\n1754; and Numa Pompilius certainly made money both of wood and leather.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you doubt the authenticity of my leathern money, which I am\r\nfully persuaded was coined in 1360, by John, king of France, who,\r\nhaving agreed to pay our Edward the Third the sum of 3,000,000 golden\r\ncrowns for his ransom, was so reduced as to be compelled to a coinage\r\nof leather for the discharge of his household expenses.”\r\n\r\n“I have only questioned the authenticity of that specimen which I saw\r\nin your cabinet,” replied the major: “and so must any person who views\r\nit through a medium unclouded by prejudice. I will stake my whole\r\nlibrary to a horn-book, that our friend Mr. Seymour will agree with me\r\nin pronouncing it a fragment of the heel of an old shoe: let him\r\nobserve the perforation, and say, if he can, that it has not been\r\nproduced by a nail or peg. But really, my dear Mr. Twaddleton, you have\r\nforced me, much against my inclination, into this controversy.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir! very good! the heel of an old shoe, forsooth! But I\r\nthank you, Major Snapwell,” exclaimed the vicar with some warmth; “I\r\nthank you, sir. Your assertion, while it evinces your own want of\r\nhistorical information, establishes, beyond doubt, the authenticity of\r\nmy treasure, and the triumph of my opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Assuredly,” said Mr. Seymour, with a wicked smile; “I dare say there\r\nmay be numerous holes in this leathern coin; for many have been the\r\nantiquaries who have, doubtless, _pinned_ their faith upon it.”\r\n\r\n“Psha, psha!” cried the vicar; “for once, at least, Mr. Seymour, let me\r\nentreat you to be serious; the subject, sir, is important, and merits\r\nyour respect. It is from that very hole that I am enabled to identify\r\nthe coin: yes, major, from that very hole, which you affect to despise,\r\nI am enabled to derive its principal claim to antiquity. Are we not\r\nexpressly informed, that the leathern money of John of France had a\r\nlittle nail of silver driven into it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” continued the major, “what say you to that tell-tale\r\nstitch, which I so unfortunately picked out with my penknife?”\r\n\r\n“Admirable ingenuity! most refined sophistry! provoking perversion!”\r\nexclaimed the vicar. “It is really amusing to observe the address with\r\nwhich the prejudiced observer distorts every fact to his own advantage.\r\nWhy, bless me, sir, that stitch is strong enough to drag fifty such\r\nopponents out of the slough of unbelief.”\r\n\r\n“Do explain yourself,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Explain myself! the stitch speaks for itself, sir. Were not these\r\nleathern coins strung together in different numbers, to facilitate\r\npayments? For, you will admit, that it would have been extremely\r\ninconvenient to have coined single pieces of leather, of different\r\ndenominations. But stop, sir, stop; look at this, look at it, major,\r\nwith care and attention. That,” said the vicar, as he drew a small coin\r\nout of his waistcoat pocket with an air of imperturbable gravity and\r\nself-satisfaction, “is a current halfpenny, in lead, of James II; and\r\nif your eyes are not hoodwinked by prejudice, you may probably perceive\r\na piece of copper in its centre, which, we are told, was thus\r\nintroduced for the purpose of rendering the currency lawful.”\r\n\r\nThe dinner was announced before the conclusion of the discussion; and\r\nas the reader will probably agree with us in thinking that a question\r\nof such grave historical importance ought not to be decided without due\r\ncare and deliberation, we shall afford the disputants a reasonable time\r\nfor reflection, and put an end to the chapter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  See page 28.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  In the cod-fish the air bladder is familiarly called the _sound_.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two boys blowing bubbles from tobacco-pipes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n _The Soap-Bubble.--The Squirt.--The Bellows; An Explanation of\r\n    their several parts.--By whom the instrument was invented.--The\r\n    sucking and lifting, or common Pump._\r\n\r\n\r\n“Tom,” said his father, “bring me a saucer with some hot water; a piece\r\nof soap, and a tobacco-pipe. I have promised to teach John the art of\r\nblowing soap-bubbles.”\r\n\r\nTom immediately proceeded to execute his commission, and shortly\r\nrejoined the party on the lawn, bringing with him all the necessary\r\nimplements for bubble-blowing. John, under the direction of his\r\nbrother, made the lather; and Mr. Seymour, turning towards the elder\r\nchildren, asked them whether they understood the philosophy of the\r\noperation they had just witnessed; they were, however, unable to return\r\na satisfactory answer, and their father, therefore, proceeded as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n“Most liquids, by agitation, exhibit the appearance of froth, in\r\nconsequence of the escape of the air in small bubbles, which had been\r\nforced into them by the operation. If, however, the liquid be viscid\r\nand tenacious, like soap and water, the air is, as it were, imprisoned\r\nin the mass, producing the appearance which is commonly called\r\n_lather_.”\r\n\r\nLouisa here enquired “Whether the air did not escape with more or less\r\nreadiness, according to the degree of resistance it met with in the\r\nliquid?”\r\n\r\n“I thank you,” said Mr. Seymour, “for having so kindly assisted me in\r\nthe explanation.”\r\n\r\nLouisa smiled at this mark of her father’s approbation, and Mr. Seymour\r\nproceeded,--“It is on that very account, that spirit, after it has been\r\nshaken, so soon regains its transparency: for, in consequence of the\r\nsuperior lightness of that fluid, and the little cohesion which\r\nsubsists between its particles, the air makes a rapid escape. In like\r\nmanner we may account for the spongy appearance which gives such\r\nsuperiority to our bread; in that case, the air disengaged during the\r\nfermentation of the dough cannot escape through so viscid a mass; it\r\ntherefore remains, and thus produces the eyes or bubbles, which you may\r\nalways observe in every well-baked loaf.”\r\n\r\n“See, papa,” exclaimed Tom, “the bubbles which John has blown in the\r\nlather, are not round, but angular figures--they appear to be like the\r\nhexagons which we used to cut out for our _papyro-plastics_.”\r\n\r\n“They are certainly hexagonal,” replied Mr. Seymour; “and the form\r\narises from the pressure of the bubbles upon each other. The same\r\nappearance is to be seen in the pith of vegetables, when examined by\r\nthe microscope, and is the result of the general reaction of the solid\r\nparts upon each other: but let us proceed to blow some bubbles. Plunge\r\nthe bowl of the tobacco-pipe into the lather.”\r\n\r\nTom obeyed his father’s directions, and blowing through the stem\r\nproduced a bubble.\r\n\r\n“See! see!” cried Louisa, “what a beautiful bubble! but there is a\r\nquantity of soap hanging to its under part.”\r\n\r\n“I will take it off with my finger,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“There it goes!” exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\n“What beautiful colours it displays! as bright and gaudy as those of\r\nthe rainbow!” observed his sister.\r\n\r\n“It has burst!” cried Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear children,” murmured the vicar, with an air of pensive\r\ngravity, “‘_Tenues secessit in auras_,’ as the poet has it. Even thus\r\nis it with all the full-blown bubbles of our fancy, raised by the\r\nbreath of hope; the moment they appear most vivid and promising to our\r\nimagination, they vanish ‘into air, into thin air,’ like the gaudy and\r\nunsubstantial soap-bubble you have just witnessed: but proceed to blow\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\n“There is one!” exclaimed Louisa;--“see, it is of an oblong shape, like\r\nan egg!--there it goes!--but I declare it is now perfectly\r\nround!!--what can be the reason of its changing its figure?”\r\n\r\n“I am glad you have asked that question, because my answer will serve\r\nto illustrate an important property of air, and which, indeed, is\r\ncommon to all fluids. While the upper part of the bubble was attached\r\nto the bowl of the pipe, its gravity being resisted, drew it into an\r\nelliptical form; but the instant it was detached, the contained air\r\npressed equally in all directions, and the bubble, in consequence,\r\nbecame a perfect sphere.”[38]\r\n\r\n“I do not exactly understand what you mean ‘by pressing equally in all\r\ndirections.’”\r\n\r\n“The expression is surely sufficiently intelligible. Did you not learn\r\nin our conversation of yesterday, that air has weight, and exerts a\r\npressure as much upwards as downwards and laterally? Were this not the\r\ncase, how could the air in the interior of our bodies counteract the\r\npressure of the atmosphere? The form of the bubble proves the same fact\r\nin a different way; for, had the air in its cavity pressed more in any\r\none direction than in another, the bubble could not have been round,\r\nor, to speak more correctly, a sphere.”\r\n\r\n“What are you musing about?” cried the vicar, who had observed the\r\nattention of the boy riveted upon the bowl of the tobacco-pipe: “I am\r\nsure, from your countenance, that some circumstance is puzzling you.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, my dear sir; I was just then thinking how it can\r\npossibly happen, that the bubble should not have a hole in its upper\r\npart; for, while I am blowing it up, there must, of course, be a\r\ncommunication between my mouth and its interior, or else how could the\r\nair pass into it?”\r\n\r\n“True,” said his father; “but the act of throwing it off from the bowl\r\nof the pipe will unite this breach; for there exists a strong cohesive\r\nattraction between the attenuated particles of the lather; you will,\r\ntherefore, perceive that, on this account, the bubble will be more\r\nreadily and securely separated by a lateral than a perpendicular motion\r\nof the pipe.”\r\n\r\n“I wish,” said Tom, “that I could discover some method of preventing\r\ntheir bursting so soon, for there is scarcely time to examine them\r\nbefore they vanish. What can be the cause of their short duration?”\r\n\r\n“Consider, my dear boy, the frailty of their structure, and I think\r\nthat the precarious tenure of their existence will cease to astonish\r\nyou; indeed, the wonder is, that they should endure so long. The film\r\nof which they consist is inconceivably thin,[39] so that the slightest\r\nimpulse will be apt to rupture them; besides which, there must be a\r\nconsiderable evaporation going on from their surface, while the\r\ncontraction of the contained air, from change of temperature, must also\r\ntend to limit their duration. You must likewise remember that the\r\nsoap-lather will have a tendency to gravitate towards the depending\r\npart of the bubble, and, consequently, by quitting the upper portion,\r\nto render it of still greater tenuity. This last effect might, perhaps,\r\nbe obviated, in some measure, by giving a rotatory motion to the bubble\r\naround its axis; but this, again, would accelerate the evaporation:\r\nwhich, after all, is the principal cause of the shortness of its\r\nduration; so that, unless this latter effect could be remedied, I\r\ndespair of suggesting any expedient by which the frail existence of our\r\nairy structure could be protracted. You must, therefore, seek, from a\r\nsuccession of bubbles, the prolongation of an amusement which no single\r\none can afford you.”\r\n\r\n“And could not the evaporation be prevented?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“If the bubble were blown in a glass vessel, and the latter immediately\r\nclosed after the operation, it would remain for some time; I remember\r\nhaving once preserved a bubble in this manner for a very considerable\r\nperiod.”\r\n\r\nTom, however, did not appear to relish this scheme; as, he said, the\r\ngreat sport arose from watching the movements of the floating bubble;\r\nthe boy, accordingly, determined to pursue the amusement in the usual\r\nmanner. His father, however, observed, that by mixing a solution of\r\nisinglass with the soap lather, larger, as well as more lasting bubbles\r\nmight be blown; and Tom accordingly determined to make the experiment.\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue, little John had succeeded, for the first time, in\r\nlaunching the airy bauble. Imagination always tinges the objects of our\r\nfirst efforts with brilliant tints: no wonder, therefore, that John,\r\nwith a shout of ecstasy, should have pronounced it to have been the\r\nmost beautiful bubble he had ever seen: in truth, the sun was shining\r\nbrightly, and the colours thus produced very justly excited the\r\nadmiration of all present.\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand the cause of these beautiful colours,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour expressed a fear that, in their present state of knowledge,\r\nthey would be scarcely able to understand the explanation he should\r\nafford them. “But,” said he, “I believe you know that a ray of light is\r\ndivisible into seven colours, and that when it passes through certain\r\nmedia, or is reflected from certain surfaces, this division is\r\neffected, and the various colours produced(32). The film of the soap\r\nbubble is one amongst the latter bodies; but I must refer you, for\r\nfarther information upon this subject, to Mrs. Marcet’s beautiful\r\naccount of ‘Refraction and Colours.’”\r\n\r\n“Now, Tom,” said his father, “fetch your squirt, for we have not yet\r\nfinished our enquiry into the effects of the air’s pressure.”\r\n\r\nThe squirt was produced; but it was out of repair: for, on attempting\r\nto fill it with water, the instrument entirely failed in the\r\nperformance of its office.\r\n\r\n“I see the defect,” said Mr. Seymour, “which a little string will\r\neasily remedy.”\r\n\r\nA piece of string was instantly produced from that universal depot, the\r\nbreeches pocket of a school-boy. Mr. Seymour said he should bind a\r\nportion of it around the end of the piston.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by the _piston_?” enquired Tom.\r\n\r\n“The rod which moves up and down in the cylinder, or tube; and, unless\r\nits end fit so exactly as to prevent the admission of air, it is clear\r\nthat the squirt cannot draw any water. It was for the purpose of making\r\nthis part fit tightly that I wanted the string, and you will now\r\nperceive that the instrument is ready for use:--fetch me a vessel of\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\nTom soon produced the water, and, on placing it on the ground,\r\nrequested that he might be allowed to fill the squirt. This he\r\naccordingly effected without difficulty, and, on pressing down the\r\nhandle, he projected a stream of water to a considerable distance.\r\n\r\n“I perceive,” said Tom, “that the stream describes a curve, like my\r\nball.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure; it is under the joint influence of the same forces, viz.\r\nthat of projection and of gravity. But explain the operation of the\r\nsquirt.”\r\n\r\n“As soon as I raised the piston, an empty space was left in the lower\r\npart of the cylinder, which I suppose would have remained as a\r\n_vacuum_, had not the water rushed into it.”\r\n\r\n“And why did the water rush into it?”\r\n\r\nTom hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Was it not, think you, owing to the pressure of the atmosphere upon\r\nthe surface of the water? When you raised the piston, the air above it\r\nwas also raised, and ultimately driven out by the force of the\r\nascending piston; and since the air could not find any entrance from\r\nbelow as long as the point was under the water, the interior of the\r\nsquirt would necessarily have remained quite empty, or have been a\r\nvacuum, had it not been for the weight of the atmosphere, which, not\r\nhaving any counteracting pressure, drove the water into the tube, and\r\nthus filled it; and which, by pressing down the piston, you again\r\nexpelled with considerable force.”\r\n\r\n“Your explanation,” cried Louisa, “is so clear and intelligible, that I\r\nfeel quite confident I could now explain any machine that owes its\r\naction to the exhaustion of the air, and the pressure of the\r\natmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“If that be your belief,” said Mr. Seymour, “I will not lose a moment\r\nin putting your knowledge to the test.--Tom, do you run into the house,\r\nand fetch hither the kitchen bellows.”\r\n\r\nThe bellows were produced, and Louisa having been desired by her father\r\nto explain the manner in which they received and expelled the air,\r\nproceeded as follows: “Upon raising the upper from the under board, the\r\ninterior space of the bellows is necessarily increased, and immediately\r\nsupplied with an additional quantity of air, which is driven into it by\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere; when, by pressing down the upper board,\r\nit is again expelled through the iron tube or nosle.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” said Tom, “in the same manner that the water was expelled\r\nfrom my squirt, when I pushed down the handle.”\r\n\r\n“So far you are quite correct,” said Mr. Seymour; “but you have not yet\r\ntold us the use of the hole in the under-board, and which is covered,\r\nas you perceive, with a movable flap of leather: it is termed a valve,\r\nor ‘_wind-clap_.’”\r\n\r\n“That,” replied Tom, “is for the purpose of admitting the air, when we\r\nraise up the board.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so; and also to prevent the air from passing out again, when\r\nyou press it down. I wish to direct your attention particularly to this\r\ncontrivance, because, simple as it may appear, its action will teach\r\nyou the general nature of a valve. Without it, the operation of filling\r\nthe bellows with air would have been so tedious as to have destroyed\r\nthe utility of the instrument; for the air could, in that case, have\r\nonly found admission through the nosle, and that, again, would have\r\nbeen attended with the additional disadvantage of drawing smoke and\r\nother matter into its cavity; when, however, you raise up the board,\r\nthe air, by its external pressure, opens the wind-clap inwards, and\r\nthus finds an easy entrance for itself; and when you press the board\r\ndownwards, the air, thus condensed, completely shuts the valve, and its\r\nreturn through that avenue being prevented, it rushes out through the\r\ntube.”\r\n\r\nThe children were much pleased with the simplicity of this invention,\r\nand Tom enquired of the vicar who first thought of it.\r\n\r\n“We are informed by Strabo,” replied Mr. Twaddleton, “that Anacharsis,\r\nthe Scythian philosopher, who lived in the time of Solon, about six\r\nhundred years before Christ, invented the bellows, as well as the\r\nanchor, and potter’s wheel; but,” he added, “there is some reason to\r\ndoubt the truth of this statement. The bellows, however, were certainly\r\nknown to the Greeks; and the great poet Virgil alludes to them in his\r\nfourth Georgic:[40]\r\n\r\n                   ----‘Alii taurinis follibus auras\r\n                   Accipiunt redduntque.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour now proposed that they should proceed to consider the\r\nstructure and operation of the pump.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Louisa, “that the pump raises water in the same\r\nmanner as the squirt.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly upon the same principle,” replied her father; “but the\r\nmachinery is a little more complicated, since its object is not to\r\nforce the water out of the pump at the same end of the pipe at which we\r\ndraw it in. We will, however, proceed to the stableyard, and examine\r\nthe pump; and do you, Tom, provide a piece of chalk, in order that I\r\nmay make a sketch of some of its principal parts.”\r\n\r\nThe party immediately proceeded; and, as they walked along, Mr. Seymour\r\ndesired the children to remember that the weight of the atmosphere was\r\nestimated as being equal to that of fifteen pounds upon every square\r\ninch of surface; and that the moment the water arrived at such a height\r\nas to balance that pressure, it could ascend no higher: he added, that\r\nthe altitude at which such a balance took place was about 32 or 33 feet\r\nabove the surface.\r\n\r\n“If that be the case,” said Louisa, “the pump, of course, can never\r\nraise water from any well of greater depth than that which you state.”\r\n\r\n“Not without some additional contrivance, which I shall afterwards\r\nexplain to you,” replied Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nThe party had, by this time, arrived at the pump; its door was opened,\r\nand as much of the apparatus exhibited as could be conveniently\r\nexposed. Mr. Seymour then chalked the annexed sketch upon the stable\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of a water-pump’s mechanism.]\r\n\r\n“Is that a pump?” asked Tom: “I should certainly never have guessed\r\nwhat you intended to represent.”\r\n\r\n“It is not a perspective drawing, my dear, but a representation of the\r\ndifferent parts as they would appear, were it possible to cut the pump\r\nin halves, from top to bottom, without disturbing any of its\r\narrangements. A drawing of this kind, which is frequently used for the\r\nsake of explanation, is termed a _section_.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour here took an apple from his pocket, and having cut it in\r\ntwo, observed that the surfaces thus exposed presented _sections_ of\r\nthe fruit. This illustration was understood by all present, and Mr.\r\nSeymour continued, “I have here, then, a section of the common\r\nhousehold pump. A B is the cylinder or barrel; P the air-tight piston\r\nwhich moves or works within it, by means of the rod; Q is the\r\n‘suction,’ or ‘feeding pipe,’ descending into a well, or any other\r\nreservoir; S the valve, or little door, at the bottom of the barrel,\r\ncovering the top of the feeding pipe; and there is a similar valve in\r\nthe piston, both of which, opening upwards, admit the water to rise\r\nthrough them, but prevent its returning. As this part of the apparatus\r\nis no less ingenious than it is important, I will sketch the valve, or\r\n_clack_, as it is termed by the engineer, on a larger scale.”\r\n\r\nTheir father then chalked the annexed figure; from which its\r\nconstruction was rendered perfectly intelligible to the children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Open valve.] Mr. Seymour proceeded: “When the pump is in\r\na state of inaction, the two valves are closed by their own weight;\r\nbut, on drawing up the piston P, from the bottom to the top of the\r\nbarrel, the column of air, which rested upon it, is raised, and a\r\nvacuum is produced between the piston and the lower valve, S; the air\r\nbeneath this valve, which is immediately over the surface of the water,\r\nconsequently expands, and forces its way through it; the water then\r\nascends into the pump. A few strokes of the handle totally exclude the\r\nair from the body of the pump, and fill it with water: which, having\r\npassed through both valves, runs out at the spout.”\r\n\r\n“I understand how water may be thus raised to the elevation of 32 feet,\r\nbut I have yet to learn the manner in which it can be raised above that\r\ndistance,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\n“It is undoubtedly true that, if the distance from the surface of the\r\nwater to the valve in the piston exceed 32 feet, water can never be\r\nforced into the barrel; but you will readily perceive that, when once\r\nthe water has passed the piston valve, it is no longer the pressure of\r\nthe air which causes it to ascend; after that period, it is raised by\r\nlifting it up, as you would raise it in a bucket, of which the piston\r\nformed the bottom; and water, having been so raised, cannot fall back\r\nagain, in consequence of the valve, which is kept closed by its\r\npressure. All, therefore, that is necessary, is to keep the working\r\nbarrel within the limits of atmospheric pressure; we have then only to\r\nfix a continued straight pipe to the top of the barrel, and to lengthen\r\nthe piston rod in the same proportion, and the water will continue to\r\nrise at each successive stroke of the pump, until at length it will\r\nflow over the top of the pipe, or through a spout inserted in any part\r\nof its side. The common pump, therefore, is properly called the\r\n_sucking_ and _lifting pump_.”\r\n\r\nThe party expressed themselves fully satisfied; and Tom enquired who\r\ninvented the machine.\r\n\r\n“It is an instrument of great antiquity,” replied his father: “its\r\ninvention is generally ascribed to Ctesebes of Alexandria, who lived\r\nabout 120 years before Christ; but the principle of its action was not\r\nunderstood for ages after its invention. The ancients entertained a\r\nbelief that ‘Nature _abhorred_ a vacuum;’ and they imagined that, when\r\nthe piston ascended, the water immediately rushed forward to prevent\r\nthe occurrence of this much dreaded vacuum. In the seventeenth century\r\na pump was constructed at Florence, by which it was attempted to raise\r\nwater from a well to a very considerable altitude, but it was found\r\nthat no exertion of this machine could be made to raise it above 32\r\nfeet from its level. This unexpected embarrassment greatly puzzled the\r\nengineer, until Galileo suggested that the pressure on the water below\r\nmust cause its ascent into the pump, and that, according to this\r\ntheory, when it had risen 32 feet, its pressure became equivalent to\r\nthat of the atmosphere, and could, therefore, not rise any higher; and\r\nas they did not, at that time, understand the construction of the\r\npiston valve, the design was abandoned. It is now time to conclude your\r\nlesson. To-morrow I hope we shall be able to enter upon the subject of\r\nTHE KITE.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  A scientific friend observed to the author, that, as the globe\r\n  possesses less surface than any other figure of equal capacity, it is\r\n  of all forms that which is best calculated to allow the closest\r\n  approximation of the particles of soap and water; and as there must\r\n  exist amongst such particles a strong cohesive tendency, after having\r\n  been forcibly stretched out, as it were, by the air blown into the\r\n  bubble, it follows that, did no other cause operate, the bubble would\r\n  assume the spherical form.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  Not exceeding the two millionth part of an inch.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Line 171.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two boys causing havoc by upsetting a washerwoman.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n _The Kite.--Its construction.--The Tail.--An Author’s\r\n    meditations among the catacombs of Paternoster Row.--Works\r\n    in their winding sheets.--How Mr. Seymour strung puns as\r\n    he strung the Kite’s tail.--The Vicar’s dismay.--The\r\n    Weather, with the hopes and fears which it alternately\r\n    inspired.--Kites constructed in various shapes.--The\r\n    figure usually adopted to be preferred.--The flight of the\r\n    Kite.--A philosophical disquisition upon the forces by\r\n    which its ascent is accomplished.--The Tail.--A Discourse\r\n    on the theory of flying.--The structure and action of the\r\n    wings of birds.--A series of kites on one string.--A Kite\r\n    Carriage.--The Messenger.--The causes and velocity of wind\r\n    explained._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children were summoned into the library, and informed by their\r\nfather that he was at leisure to explain the philosophy of the kite; a\r\nsubject with which Tom had repeatedly expressed some impatience to\r\nbecome acquainted.\r\n\r\n“It is a beautiful day,” exclaimed the boy joyously; “and there is such\r\na delightful breeze, that I should really call it a complete\r\n_kite-day_.”\r\n\r\n“Gently, my fine fellow,” replied Mr. Seymour: “the bird must be\r\nfledged, ere it can fly. We have not, as yet, any kite: for you know\r\nthat the one you possess is shattered beyond the possibility of repair.”\r\n\r\n“True, papa; but could not Robert just step into the village and buy\r\none? I saw several kites in the shop of Peg Robson yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“I do not doubt it, my boy; but the kites which are to be found in the\r\ntoy-shop are made to sell, rather than to fly; and to _raise the wind_,\r\nfor the benefit of the vender, rather than to be raised _by it_, for\r\nthe amusement of the purchaser: we must, therefore, construct one for\r\nourselves; and see, I have, accordingly, prepared all the necessary\r\nmaterials for the purpose. I have here, as you perceive, a straight\r\nlath of deal, about three-quarters of an inch wide, and less than a\r\nquarter of an inch thick, and about four feet in length; this is quite\r\nready for forming the standard, or _back-bone_ of the kite: and now for\r\nthe bow. The cooper has complied with my directions, and sent an unbent\r\nhoop, as free as possible from knots; you observe that it is about the\r\nsame length as the lath, but it will be necessary to pare it down a\r\nlittle at each end, in order to make it bend more readily to the\r\nrequired shape.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of a kite, labeled a through f.]\r\n\r\nThis having been accomplished, Mr. Seymour proceeded to form the\r\nframework of the kite in the following manner. He first ascertained the\r\ncentral point of the bow, by balancing it on his fore-finger; he then\r\naffixed that point, by means of string, to the lath, at _c_, about an\r\ninch and a half from its upper extremity; a notch was next cut in each\r\nend of the hoop, or bow, _a d_; having fixed the string in the notch,\r\n_a_, he drew it through another, _e_, previously cut in the bottom of\r\nthe lath, and carried it to the opposite end of the bow _d_; the\r\nskeleton now presented the usual form, of the kite. The next point,\r\ntherefore, was to ascertain whether the two sides of the bow were in\r\nequilibrio, which he determined by balancing the lath on the finger,\r\nand observing whether it remained horizontal, or dipped on either side.\r\nThis adjustment having been accomplished, Mr. Seymour next continued\r\nthe string from _d_ across the skeleton to the opposite notch _a_,\r\ngiving it one turn round the lath in its way; from _a_ it was carried\r\nto _f_, and wound round the top of the lath, and then again fastened at\r\n_d_; from _d_ it was extended rather more than midway down the lath,\r\nand having been secured at _b_, was finally carried to, and secured in\r\nthe notch _a_. The framework was now pronounced by Mr. Seymour to be\r\ncomplete.[41]\r\n\r\nThe next part of the process was to cover it with paper. Mr. Seymour\r\nobserved, that the best kind which could be employed for this purpose\r\nwas that known amongst stationers by the name of _fan paper_, so called\r\nfrom its being manufactured for the use of the fanmaker; its merits, he\r\nsaid, depended upon the size of its sheets, as well as upon the\r\nthinness and firmness of its texture: this, however was not at hand; he\r\nwas therefore obliged to rest satisfied with its best substitute, viz.\r\nfolio sheets of large thin post.\r\n\r\nThe party now went “ding-dong” to work; paper, paste, and scissors were\r\nimmediately put in requisition. Sheets of paper were laid smooth on the\r\ntable, and so arranged that each sheet overlapped its neighbour about\r\nhalf an inch. The skeleton of the kite was then placed upon them, and\r\nthe paper was cut to its figure; a margin, of about three-quarters of\r\nan inch, having been left around it, except over the bow, where the\r\nmargin was extended to an inch in width: this arrangement was for the\r\npurpose of allowing the paper to turn over the framework, when pasted\r\nto it. This part of the work having been completed, and a sufficient\r\ntime allowed for the drying of the paste, Mr. Seymour proceeded to fix\r\nthe string, usually termed the _belly-band_: for this purpose two holes\r\nwere drilled through the lath, at equal distances from its edges; the\r\nupper one about a fifth part of the length of the kite from the top,\r\nthe lower hole rather more than the same distance above its extremity.\r\n\r\nThe last, and by far the most important point, was to make the loop in\r\nthe _belly-band_. If the kite be accurately constructed, its proper\r\nplace may be easily found by extending the band, right or left, on the\r\nsurface of the kite, and then marking the string at a point which lies\r\nin a line drawn from one end of the bow to the other; the loop must be\r\nmade a little above such a point. If the kite be now suspended by this\r\nloop, the two ends of the bow ought to preserve a balance, and the\r\nlower extremity should dip below the upper part of the kite.\r\n\r\nAs Louisa observed the extreme care with which her father adjusted this\r\npart of the machine, she enquired into its use.\r\n\r\n“I was myself about to put the same question,” said her mother; “for\r\nits adjustment would appear to require as much accuracy as that of the\r\nsash of a girl of sixteen.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour informed them, they would hereafter find that the steady\r\nascent of the kite into the air entirely depended upon such accuracy.\r\n“Have you not seen, Tom,” asked he, “a kite rise sideways, or _plunge_,\r\nas it is called?”\r\n\r\nTom said he had often experienced that difficulty at school, but that\r\nhe had attributed it to some defect in the tail.\r\n\r\n“An error in the construction of the tail may, certainly, be\r\noccasionally the cause of such an accident, but it is more generally\r\nreferable to an improper position of the loop: if the kite _plunges_,\r\nyou may conclude that this loop is placed too high; and should it whirl\r\nround in the air, you may infer that it is too low.”\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation Mr. Twaddleton entered the apartment; Tom was\r\nanxious to show him his newly-constructed kite, and, while the party\r\nwere asking him numerous questions, Mr. Seymour observed, that the\r\nvicar would be more profitably employed in making _bobs_ for the string\r\nof the tail, than in finding answers for their string of questions.\r\n\r\nMrs. Seymour, and her daughters, with Tom and the vicar, were,\r\naccordingly, placed round the table, for the purpose of carrying this\r\nproject into effect, by a suitable division of labour. It was arranged\r\nthat Mrs. Seymour should cut the paper, the vicar fold it, and Mr.\r\nSeymour tie it on the string.\r\n\r\n“How long ought the tail to be?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“And of what shape should the papers be cut?” enquired Louisa.\r\n\r\n“And at what distances are they to be placed from each other on the\r\nstring?” said Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“I will answer all your queries,” replied the father, “by giving you a\r\ndissertation upon this part of our machine.”\r\n\r\n“We shall now have an harangue,” exclaimed the vicar, “as long as the\r\ntail itself; but pray proceed.”\r\n\r\n“The tail should never be less than twelve, and should it even amount\r\nto twenty times the length of the kite, its appearance in the air will\r\nbe more graceful; this, however, must be regulated by the weight of the\r\nstring, and by the length and thickness of the pieces of paper of which\r\nthe tail is composed. The length of each ought to be about three inches\r\nand a quarter, and an inch and a half in breadth, and it should be\r\nfolded four times longitudinally; each of these _bobs_, as they are\r\ncalled, must be placed at regular intervals of three inches.”\r\n\r\n“And with respect to the size of the wings?” asked the vicar.\r\n\r\n“I should not recommend any wings; if the kite be well made, there\r\ncannot be any advantage from such appendages. Having now answered your\r\nseveral questions, let us proceed with our work.”\r\n\r\n“But where is the paper?” asked Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Apropos,” answered her husband; “the box in which the London toys were\r\npacked contains a quantity that will answer our purpose.”\r\n\r\nThe box was accordingly placed on the table.\r\n\r\n“Why, what a most extraordinary miscellany!” cried the vicar; “the army\r\nof Mithridates could not have consisted of a more incongruous mixture.\r\nI perceive,” added he, as his enquiring eyes glanced from sheet to\r\nsheet, “we have here a fragment of almost every description of literary\r\nand scientific work.”\r\n\r\n“The market,” observed Mr. Seymour, “is supplied with waste paper from\r\nthe catacombs of Paternoster Row, which may be truly said to ‘level all\r\ndistinctions.’ Without intending any offence by a pun, my good vicar,\r\nwhat a _tale_ will this box unfold! I never open a magazine of this\r\nwaste paper, without feeling a deep sympathy for the melancholy fate of\r\nauthors: to see the strange transmigrations, and vile purposes, to\r\nwhich their works are destined, is really heart-rending. That the\r\n_lights_ of science should be consigned to the tallow-chandler! the\r\nworks of the moralist, so well calculated to _purify_ the world, to the\r\nsoap-seller! that such a book as ‘Laennec on the _Chest_,’ with Dr.\r\nForbes’s valuable _Cases_ in the bargain, should be _packed_ off to the\r\n_trunk_-maker! are events which cannot fail to furnish food for\r\nmelancholy reflection. Nay, more, I have myself (can you believe it,\r\nMr. Twaddleton?) actually received a quantity of _ureic_ acid in a\r\nReview of Dr. Thomson’s Chemistry! and I only yesterday learned, with\r\nhorror, that a piece of fat bacon was positively wrapped up in a page\r\nof ‘Paris on Diet;’ while a Cheshire cheese came encased in Kitchener’s\r\n‘Chart of the Moon.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh, shameful! shameful!!” exclaimed the vicar: “but I can assure you,\r\nthat this unfeeling conduct of the publisher had not escaped my notice\r\nand indignation; for I lately received a work against the slave-trade,\r\nin the fragment of a tract on ‘the Progress of Cant;’ and a Copy of\r\nIrving’s Orations, in an act of ‘Much Ado about Nothing;’ and what was\r\nstill worse,” continued the reverend divine, “a little work on the art\r\nof Prognosticating the Weather, was forwarded to me in a chapter of\r\n_Daniel’s_ Prophecies.”\r\n\r\n“But let us quit these melancholy reflections for the present, and\r\nproceed with our occupation.”\r\n\r\n“If you compose the tail of your kite with these papers,” said the\r\nvicar, “it will certainly vie with that of Scriblerus himself; you will\r\nhave a knot of divinity,--a knot of physic,--a knot of logic,--a knot\r\nof philosophy,--a knot of poetry,--and a knot of history.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, my dear sir; I wager an edition of Virgil, that I shall be\r\nable to discover in each page, with which you may present me, some\r\napposite allusion to the _tail_, of which it is to form a part.”\r\n\r\n“Apposite allusion! impossible; as well might you attempt to connect\r\nthe scattered leaves of the Sibyl: for example, here is an Epitome of\r\nthe Roman History.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Mr. Seymour, “and pray is not that cur_tail_?”\r\n\r\nThe vicar dropped the paper in dismay; the treacherous design of his\r\nfriend now, for the first time, flashed across his brain with a painful\r\nconviction, and he hastily retreated to a distant corner of the\r\nlibrary, or “_turned tail_,” as Mr. Seymour jocosely expressed it, in\r\norder that he might find shelter from the pelting of a pitiless storm\r\nof puns, which he saw, too clearly, was about to burst on his devoted\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nOn the vicar’s retiring from the table, Mrs. Seymour approached the\r\nfatal box, observing, “that it was now her turn to explore the\r\nSibylline cave.”\r\n\r\n“Here,” said she, “is a list of the prices of some newly published\r\nworks.”\r\n\r\n“That,” replied her husband, as he cast a sly glance at the vicar, “is\r\nre_tail_: pray, proceed.”\r\n\r\n“We have next, I perceive, a prospectus for publishing all the speeches\r\nin the late parliament.”\r\n\r\n“That is de_tail_.”\r\n\r\nHere a deep groan from Mr. Twaddleton arrested the progress of the\r\nproceedings, and threw the whole party into a fit of laughter. As soon\r\nas tranquillity was restored, Mrs. Seymour again dipped her hand into\r\nthe box, and drew forth the fragments of a work on Real Property.\r\n\r\n“That,” said Mr. Seymour, “is en_tail_; pray, _cut it off_, and give it\r\nto me.”\r\n\r\n“We have here,” continued the lady, “the Memoirs of an Italian Bandit.”\r\n\r\n“Then prepare him for his fate; I have a noose quite ready for his\r\nreception.”\r\n\r\n“Here is a poem, entitled Waterloo.”\r\n\r\n“I will patronise it,” said her husband; “and I warrant you that, under\r\nmy auspices, the muse will soar to a greater height than she ever could\r\notherwise have attained.”\r\n\r\n“We have here, I declare, a part of * * * * [sic] pamphlet.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have lost my wager,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “for I defy the\r\npower of man to make either head or _tail_ of it.”\r\n\r\nThus did Mr. and Mrs. Seymour proceed; the one cutting paper, the other\r\ncutting jokes; nor did the former cease stringing puns, until he had\r\nfinished stringing the tail.\r\n\r\n“I must now conclude by making a knot that shall not be in danger of\r\nbecoming untied in the breeze,” said Mr. Seymour: “but stop, stop one\r\nmoment! I still require one more piece of paper to complete my task,\r\nand let it be double.”\r\n\r\n“Here then is a piece of paper, which, from its texture, appears to be\r\nwell adapted to your purpose. Let me see, what is it? I declare it is\r\nthe titlepage of an Essay on Matrimony.”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” cried her husband; “a strange coincidence, truly; you have,\r\nindeed, furnished me with a knot that cannot be easily untied, however\r\nstiff may be the breeze; hand it over to me, for it will afford a very\r\nlegitimate finish, and is generally the conclusion of every _tale_: but\r\nwhere is the vicar? What, ho! Mr. Twaddleton.”\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentleman had so contrived to conceal his person in the\r\ncorner of the room, behind a large folio which he had placed on a desk\r\nbefore him, that several moments elapsed before he was discovered; at\r\nlength, however, a long-drawn sigh betrayed him in his retreat.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” exclaimed he, as he pushed aside the huge folio, “your\r\nvolatility, Mr. Seymour, is wholly inconsistent with the gravity of a\r\nscientific instructor.”\r\n\r\n“But, at present,” replied Mr. Seymour, “I am the manufacturer of a\r\nkite’s tail; and, surely, upon such an occasion, _flightiness_ ought\r\nnot to be urged to my disparagement.”\r\n\r\nThe party, shortly after this discussion, separated: Mr. Seymour\r\nretired to his own room; the vicar proceeded to the church to bury a\r\npatient of Doseall’s; and the children ran into the garden to enjoy\r\ntheir rural sports.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, before the wings of the lark had brushed away the\r\nmorning dew, Tom and his sisters, buoyant with expectation, had\r\ndescended into the garden, in order to ascertain the state of the\r\nweather and the direction of the wind; but the sky was sullen and calm,\r\nnot a breath disturbed the susceptible leaves of the aspen; all was\r\nrepose--“a dread repose.”\r\n\r\n“No kite-day this,” sighed Tom, with a countenance as lowering as the\r\nmorning clouds.\r\n\r\n“Have patience,” said Louisa; “the wind may yet rise, it is only just\r\nsix o’clock.”\r\n\r\nThus did the minds of the children continue to hover between hope and\r\ndespair, until after breakfast, when they determined to seek the\r\ngardener, and hold a grave consultation with that acknowledged judge of\r\nthe elements; he told them that showers might be expected, but he\r\nthought it probable that the wind might rise after mid-day. “I will,\r\nhowever,” said he, “consult my oracles;(33) after which, I shall be\r\nable to give you a satisfactory opinion.” So saying, he left them; and,\r\non his return, observed that “as the _Siberian sow-thistle_ had closed\r\nitself the preceding evening, and the _African marigold_ continued shut\r\nafter seven o’clock in the morning, he had thought there would be rain;\r\nbut,” he added, “that upon inspecting the _poor-man’s weatherglass_,\r\nthe _Anagallis arvensis_, or _red pimpernel_, two hours ago, he had\r\nfound it open, from which he concluded that the day would have been\r\nfine.”\r\n\r\n“There, Louisa; it will be a fine day, after all,” exclaimed her\r\ndelighted brother.\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” continued the gardener; “on returning just now to the\r\nflower, which never deceives us, I found it had closed itself, so that\r\nrain is inevitable.”\r\n\r\nNor was this opinion erroneous; for before the brother and sister could\r\nreach the lodge, the heavy clouds began to discharge their watery\r\nburthen, and the rain continued in one incessant shower for more than\r\ntwo hours; it then gradually abated, and the children, who had been\r\nanxiously watching it at the library window, were suddenly relieved\r\nfrom their anxiety by the appearance of the vicar, whom they espied\r\nslowly winding his way through the dripping shrubbery.\r\n\r\n             “‘Heu! quianam tanti cinxerunt æthera nimbi?’\r\n\r\nas Virgil has it,” exclaimed the vicar, as he approached the portico,\r\nwhere Mr. Seymour and his family had assembled to salute him.\r\n\r\n“We are under the influence of St. Swithin, vicar,” said Mrs. Seymour,\r\n“and I fear there is but slender hope of its becoming fair.”\r\n\r\n“Psha! who cares for St. Swithin?(34) My barometer is rising rapidly,\r\nand I place more confidence in that classical deity, Mercury, than in a\r\nsaint of so very questionable a character.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Phœbus, as if delighted by the compliment thus bestowed\r\nupon his heathen brother, cast a sly glance from behind a dark cloud,\r\nand illumined the spot upon which the vicar was standing. In short,\r\nafter the lapse of half an hour, the sun broke through the gloom, and a\r\nbrisk gale followed; the countenances of the children sympathised with\r\nthe face of the heavens, and the expression of hope lighted them up, in\r\nproportion as the sun illumined the departing clouds with its radiance.\r\n\r\n“It is now quite fair, papa,” cried Tom, in a voice of triumph, “and\r\nthere is a most delightful wind; shall we not proceed at once to the\r\ncommon?”\r\n\r\n“Presently,” answered his father: “the ground is yet extremely wet.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of an hour this objection had been removed, and the party\r\nprepared to set off on their kite-flying expedition.\r\n\r\n“Bring me the kite, and let me sling it properly over Tom’s shoulder,”\r\nsaid Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“I will carry the string,” exclaimed Louisa; “how nicely it is wound\r\nround the stick.”\r\n\r\nAs the party walked forwards, the vicar asked Tom whether he knew from\r\nwhence the name of the _kite_ originated.\r\n\r\n“A kite is a bird of prey,” answered the boy, “which soars a great\r\nheight; and from remaining stationary in the air, was, I suppose,\r\nthought to resemble the paper kite.”\r\n\r\n“That is a very good explanation,” said the vicar; “or it may, perhaps,\r\nhave derived its name from the circumstance of its having been\r\noriginally constructed in the shape of a bird of this description. In\r\nChina the flying of kites is much more practised than in this country;\r\nand I understand that their shape is always that of some bird.”\r\n\r\n“In the London toy-shops you may constantly meet with them in such\r\nforms, as well as in many other fantastic shapes,” observed Mr.\r\nSeymour; “and,” continued he, “I remember to have seen, some years ago,\r\na kite which resembled a man. It was made of linen cloth, cut, and\r\npainted for the purpose, and stretched on a light frame, so constructed\r\nas to resemble the outline of the human figure. It stood upright, and\r\nwas dressed in a sort of jacket. Its arms were disposed like handles on\r\neach side of its body, and its head being covered with a cap,\r\nterminating in an angle, favoured the ascent of the machine, which was\r\ntwelve feet in height; but to render it easier to be transported, it\r\ncould be folded double, by means of hinges adapted to the frame. The\r\nperson who directed this kind of kite was able to raise it, though the\r\nweather was calm, to the height of nearly five hundred feet; and, when\r\nonce raised, he maintained it in the air by giving only a slight motion\r\nto the string. The figure, by these means, acquired a kind of\r\nlibration, like that of a man skaiting on the ice. The illusion,\r\noccasioned by this spectacle, did not fail, as you may readily suppose,\r\nto attract a great number of spectators.”\r\n\r\n“I believe, however,” observed the vicar, “that the figure commonly\r\nadopted, is the one best calculated for the purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied Mr. Seymour, “and for obvious reasons; the\r\ncurvature of the bow enables it to escape the resistance of the air, as\r\nit rises; which, after having struck it, slides off, just as the\r\ncurrent is more effectually turned aside by the gently curved prow,\r\nthan by that which has a sharp outline; for the same reason, the mast\r\nof a ship, though it has a conical shape, is more easily drawn through\r\nthe water with its broad, than with its narrow end, foremost; for\r\nalthough the primary obstruction is, no doubt, greater in the former\r\ncase, yet the water heaped, as it were, on the front, is made to stream\r\noff with a slight divergency, and therefore does not hang on the sides\r\nof the mast, as it would in the latter case. This shape of the kite,\r\nmoreover, presents the largest surface at the point upon which the wind\r\ncan act with the greatest effect, while the whole is lightened by the\r\nremoval of parts that would obstruct its action. The tail has also a\r\ngreater control over a figure of such a description.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour asked the vicar, “whether he could explain the origin of\r\nthe French term for the kite, viz. _cerf volant_, or flying stag; I\r\nnever can believe,” continued he, “that the kite could ever have been\r\nconstructed in the shape of that animal.”\r\n\r\n“I am unable to clear up the difficulty,” replied the vicar; “and yet I\r\nhave taken some pains upon the subject. The earliest notice of the\r\nkite, which I have been able to discover, is in a short English and\r\nFrench Dictionary, by Miege, which was published in the year 1690, and\r\nit is there described under the name of _cerf volant_.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” cried Tom, “who invented the kite?”\r\n\r\n“In, that, again,” answered Mr. Twaddleton, “I am unable to furnish you\r\nwith any satisfactory information. The pastime appears to be of very\r\nancient date in China, and was, probably, first imported into Europe\r\nfrom that country.”\r\n\r\n“At what period, do you suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Strutt, who was very assiduous and correct in all his antiquarian\r\nresearches, was of opinion that its introduction into England could not\r\nbe dated farther back than a hundred and fifty years.”\r\n\r\nThe party had, by this time, reached Overton heath; the weather was\r\nfavourable; and the kite impatiently fluttered in the breeze, while Tom\r\nwas eagerly engaged in unwinding its streaming tail, and preparing the\r\npaper machine for ascent.\r\n\r\n“Is the string fixed to the belly-band?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“All is ready,” replied the vicar; “and I will hold it up, while Tom\r\nruns with it against the wind. Had King Eric set his cap for us, we\r\ncould not have had a more favourable breeze.”\r\n\r\n“There is not the least occasion to raise the kite from the ground,”\r\nobserved Mr. Seymour; “let its point rest on the grass, and place its\r\ntail in a straight line in front of it; I warrant you it will rise, as\r\nsoon as Tom begins to run.”\r\n\r\nTom immediately set off, and the kite rose majestically into the air.\r\n\r\n“Give it string--give it string--gently, gently--now stop; there is no\r\noccasion for your running any farther but let out the cord, as long as\r\nthe kite carries it off vigorously, and keeps it fully stretched; but\r\nwind it up the moment its tension is relaxed.”\r\n\r\n“It is rising very fast,” cried the breathless boy, “but the string\r\nburns my hand as it passes through it; I shall not be able to endure\r\nthe heat.”\r\n\r\n“Be patient, and let it pass more slowly; put on your glove,” said his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay; put on your glove,” repeated the vicar; “even Xenophon\r\nhimself, who declaimed so warmly against the effeminacy of the\r\nPersians, for wearing gloves, would scarcely have refused his consent\r\nto their use on such an occasion.”\r\n\r\n“What is it that produces so much heat?” enquired Louisa.\r\n\r\n“The friction of the string,” replied her father.\r\n\r\n“Do you not know that carriages frequently catch fire from the friction\r\nof their wheels, unless it be prevented by the application of grease?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Tom; “and I have heard that the natives of some countries\r\nkindle their fires by rubbing pieces of wood together.”\r\n\r\n“The original inhabitants of the new world,” observed his father,\r\n“throughout the whole extent from Patagonia to Greenland, procured fire\r\nby rubbing pieces of hard and dry wood against each other, until they\r\nemitted sparks, or burst into flame; some of the people to the north of\r\nCalifornia produced the same effect by inserting a kind of pivot in the\r\nhole of a very thick plank, and causing it to revolve with extreme\r\nrapidity: the same principle will explain how immense forests can have\r\nbeen consumed; for it is evident, that the violent friction of the\r\nbranches against each other, from the agitation of the wind, would be\r\nfully adequate to the production of such an effect.”\r\n\r\n“You have also an excellent example of the effect of friction in\r\nproducing heat,” said the vicar, “in the history of the whale fishery;\r\nfor, in harpooning the fish, unless the sailors observe the greatest\r\ncaution in letting out the rope, its friction upon the side of their\r\nboat will be sure to set it on fire.”\r\n\r\n“And how do they manage it?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the whale dives,(35) after having been wounded, it draws\r\nout the line or cord of the harpoon, which is coiled up in the boat,\r\nwith very considerable velocity. In order, therefore, to prevent any\r\naccident from the violence of this motion, one man is stationed with an\r\naxe to cut it asunder, if it should become entangled; while another,\r\nwith a mop, is constantly cooling with water the channel through which\r\nit passes.”\r\n\r\n“The kite is now at a considerable height,” observed Tom; “but look at\r\nthe string, how bent it is! I have repeatedly endeavoured to pull it\r\nstraight, but without success.”\r\n\r\n“How could you have expected to succeed in the attempt? Consider the\r\nweight of such a long line of string.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is not the pressure of the atmosphere which gives it that\r\ncurved form?”\r\n\r\n“Assuredly not: have you so soon forgotten that the air presses equally\r\nin all directions, and would therefore tend to straighten, as much as\r\nto give a curved direction to the string? But, as you now appear to\r\nhave let out the whole of your string, suppose you allow the kite to\r\nenjoy its airing, while we proceed to consider the philosophy of its\r\nascent, and the nature and direction of those forces by which it is\r\neffected.”\r\n\r\n“The kite pulls so amazingly hard,” cried Tom, “that unless I fix the\r\nstring securely around the tree, we shall run the chance of losing it.”\r\n\r\n“I am well aware of the force it exerts,” replied his father. “Dr.\r\nFranklin has said, that, with a good kite, a man unable to swim might\r\nbe sustained in the water, so as to pass from Dover to Calais; but I\r\nagree with him in thinking, that a packet would be a much safer, as\r\nwell as a pleasanter mode of conveyance.”\r\n\r\n“Now, then, for your explanation of the kite’s ascent. Unless I am\r\nmistaken, you will find the subject much more complicated than you\r\nimagine,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Not at all; Tom, who, I trust, has a perfect acquaintance with the\r\ncomposition and resolution of forces, will very readily understand the\r\nexplanation I propose to offer. I admit, however, that there are some\r\nfew points in the enquiry, which cannot be successfully treated without\r\na knowledge of the higher branches of the mathematics; but I shall, of\r\ncourse, avoid all such difficulties.[42] Can you tell me, Tom, what\r\nadvantage is gained by your running with the kite?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“I suppose that you thus obtain more force from the wind.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly: action and reaction are equal. By running, therefore, with\r\nyour kite against the wind, you strike the air, and thus produce a\r\nreaction, which is equal to the force of the blow given to it. When the\r\nwind is high, and its action is not intercepted by surrounding objects,\r\nthere cannot exist any necessity for such an expedient.”\r\n\r\n“The principle is the same as that which enables the bird to rise into\r\nthe air by flapping its wings,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Unquestionably,” replied Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Does the kite, then, rise in the air, from the same causes that enable\r\na bird to fly?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“We are not, at present, considering the ascent of the kite, but the\r\nadvantage which is obtained by running with it: this latter, as the\r\nvicar has properly observed, undoubtedly depends upon the same\r\nprinciple as that which enables the bird to rise, by the motion of its\r\nwings, and which constitutes the third law of motion,[43] viz. that\r\n_action and reaction are equal_; that is to say, whenever one body\r\nexerts a force upon another, the second body opposes the first, with\r\nequal force, in an opposite direction. If, then, the bird strikes the\r\nair below it with a force which is equal to its weight, then must there\r\nbe a reaction of the air, upwards, exactly equal to it; and the bird,\r\nbeing acted upon by two equal forces, in opposite directions, will,\r\nnecessarily, rest between them.”\r\n\r\n“That is clear enough; but the bird _rises_,” answered Tom.\r\n\r\n“Because the force of the stroke is _greater_ than the weight of the\r\nbird, and it therefore rises with the _difference_ of these two forces;\r\nwere the stroke _less_ than its weight, then would it sink with the\r\ndifference. Suppose, for example, a bird weighs _twelve_ ounces, and it\r\nstrikes the air with a force equal to _sixteen_, is it not clear that\r\nit must rise with a force equal to _four_? and is it not evident that,\r\nif it strikes the air with a force equal only to _eight_, that it must\r\nsink with a force equal to _four_?”\r\n\r\n“So far I understand it perfectly; but I was thinking that, as the wing\r\nflaps up and down, what was gained by striking the air downwards must\r\nbe counterbalanced when the bird raised her wing again, and thus struck\r\nthe air in the contrary direction,” observed Tom.\r\n\r\n“I give you no small degree of credit for that remark,” said his\r\nfather; “for it is undoubtedly true that, if the flapping of the wings\r\nin flight were no more than the motion of the same surface upwards and\r\ndownwards, the bird must lose as much by one motion as she could gain\r\nby the other; the skylark could never ascend by such an action, for, as\r\nyou have so justly remarked, although the stroke upon the air by the\r\nunder side of her wing would carry her up, the stroke from the upper\r\nside, when she raised her wing again, would bring her down; but, if you\r\nwill attentively examine the structure of the wing, you will at once\r\nperceive, from its external convexity, the disposition, and more\r\nparticularly the overlapping of its larger feathers, that when the wing\r\nis drawn up, its surface is contracted, and when let down fully\r\nexpanded--or, in other words, that the feathers strike the air\r\ndownwards with their flat side, but rise from the stroke slantwise,\r\njust as the rower in a boat, after having given the stroke, turns his\r\noar so as only to present its edge, an operation which is termed\r\n_feathering_, from its resemblance to this very action of the wing in\r\nflight.”\r\n\r\n“It appears to me that flying is an easy process,” said Tom; “could we\r\nnot contrive some sort of flapper, by which we might be able to rise\r\ninto the air?”\r\n\r\n“Your opinion, my dear boy, is by no means singular; hundreds have\r\nentertained the same belief before you; and so confident was the famous\r\nBishop Wilkins, that he declared it to be his conviction, that, in\r\nfuture ages, it will be as usual to hear a man call for his wings, as\r\nit is now to call for his boots.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the vicar; “and if my memory is correct, William of\r\nMalmesbury, in his account of the Conquest of England by the Normans,\r\nmentions a Benedictine monk, by the name of Elmer, who having affixed\r\nwings to his hands and feet, ascended a lofty tower whence he took his\r\nflight, but he fell to the ground and broke both his legs.”\r\n\r\n“I do not see the difficulty,” exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\n“The weight of our bodies is so great, that we have not sufficient\r\nmuscular strength to impart a blow to the air that shall be equal to\r\nit. Now are you satisfied?” said his father.\r\n\r\n“I am perfectly satisfied, if that be the case, that we can never hope\r\nto fly.”\r\n\r\n“The principle, however, which I have just explained,” observed Mr.\r\nSeymour, “although it will fail us in our attempts to construct wings,\r\nis nevertheless extensively applicable in mechanics. A vane or fly, for\r\ninstance, by resisting the air as it spins round, becomes the regulator\r\nof machinery. The intervals between the strokes on the bell of a clock\r\nare thus regulated, and the fly, on this occasion, is so contrived that\r\nthis interval may be altered, or the clock made to strike faster or\r\nslower, by presenting the arms of it more or less obliquely to the\r\ndirection in which they move. The same kind of fly is the regulator\r\nused in musical boxes, as I will presently show you, and indeed in\r\nalmost all mechanical toys. Let us now return to the subject of the\r\nkite; for, as yet, we have merely considered the effect of increasing\r\nthe wind upon its surface; we have next to enquire how the wind\r\noperates in raising it into the air.--Do you not remember, when I\r\nadjusted the noose in the belly-band, I stated that much depended upon\r\nthis part of the apparatus? You will, at once, perceive that it will\r\ninfluence the angle which the kite forms with the earth, and I am about\r\nto prove to you, that the theory of the kite’s ascent is materially\r\nconnected with the value of this angle; but, in order to render my\r\nexplanation intelligible, I have prepared a diagram, to which I am\r\ndesirous of directing your attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of a kite labeled with A, B, O, S, T, W, and Y.]\r\n\r\n“The kite here appears in the act of rising from the ground; the line W\r\nwill represent the direction of the wind blowing upon it, all the\r\ncurrents of which we will suppose united in one; it is evident, from\r\nwhat has been already stated, that as it falls upon an oblique surface,\r\nit will be resolved into two forces, viz. into one parallel with it,\r\nand into another perpendicular to that surface; of which the force\r\nrepresented by the line Y will alone produce any effect, carrying the\r\nkite along the line O A, or in a direction parallel to itself; and you\r\nmust have observed that this was the direction in which the kite was\r\nimpelled, when you suffered it to rise, without checking its progress\r\nby the string.”\r\n\r\n“I remember that well,” said Tom; “and I also observed that, when I\r\npulled my string, the kite immediately rose more perpendicularly.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure it did; because, by that operation, you called a new force\r\ninto action; which I have represented in the diagram by the line S T.\r\nThe kite was therefore under the influence of the two forces O A and\r\nS T, and, since these are in the direction of the two sides of a\r\nparallelogram, it would not obey either, but ascend through O B, its\r\ndiagonal.”\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding Mr. Twaddleton’s doubts upon the subject,” said Tom,\r\n“I am sure that I perfectly understand your explanation; and I think I\r\nmay also answer for my sister: but you have not yet told us any thing\r\nabout the tail; I suppose, however, that it acts like the rudder of a\r\nship, or the tail of a bird.”\r\n\r\n“Before I answer that question, let me inform you how the tail of a\r\nbird differs, in its action and uses, from the rudder of a ship. In the\r\nfirst place, the rudder is so fixed that it can but move in one\r\nhorizontal plane, and can therefore only turn the vessel to the right\r\nor left, which, indeed, is all that is required;(36) but the tail of\r\nthe bird, in addition to this motion, can be placed in a diagonal\r\ndirection, and when expanded will offer a considerable surface to the\r\nair, so as to fulfil some of the offices of a third wing. Have you\r\nnever watched the manœuvres of the rook, as he gambols through the air?\r\nAfter flying in the ordinary way, you will observe his wings at rest,\r\nand that he glides along apparently without the least exertion in his\r\ndescent. In this case, his expanded wings act as a parachute; then,\r\nagain, you will observe him wheeling round, a manœuvre which is partly\r\nproduced by the oblique position of his tail, and which is readily\r\nexplained upon the principle of the resolution of forces I have just\r\ndescribed with reference to the action of the wind upon the surface of\r\nthe kite.(37) I ought also to state, that the tail serves to poise the\r\nbody of the bird.”\r\n\r\n“Does the bird, then, never use its wings for the purpose of directing\r\nits course?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly it does,” answered her father; “the tail is only to be\r\nconsidered as a supplementary organ: it is by means of the wings that\r\nit generally directs its course, for it is evident, that it can easily\r\nturn, either to the right or left, by flapping the opposite wing with\r\nincreased force, just as a boat is turned about to the right, by a\r\nbrisk application of the left oar. In like manner the irregular flight\r\nof the butterfly, now up and now down, now to the right and now to the\r\nleft, is no doubt effected by the wings striking the air one after the\r\nother, or perhaps with an alternate and unequal force. The object of\r\nsuch an action is obviously to baffle the pursuit of birds which fly in\r\na right line, whereas you see the butterfly does just the contrary.”(38)\r\n\r\n“How very wonderful,” said Louisa, “is the action of the wings of\r\ninsects. I have often watched them during their flight, and their\r\nrapidity is such as to surpass the power of vision.”\r\n\r\n“I shall have occasion to advert to that subject hereafter,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour; “at present, I shall only observe, that a gnat’s wing, in its\r\nordinary flight, beats many hundred times in a second.”\r\n\r\n“But you have not yet answered Tom’s question,” said the vicar. “Of\r\nwhat use is the tail of the kite? Does it assist its ascent, or is it\r\nmerely an appendage of ornament?”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, it keeps the head of the kite to the wind; and in\r\nthe next, it lowers its centre of gravity, and throws it towards its\r\nextremity, which not only prevents the chance of the machine being\r\nupset in the air, but so poises and regulates the position of the kite\r\nas to maintain the angle which it is necessary for the string to make\r\nwith the surface.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton here enquired what might be the most advantageous angle\r\nfor the kite to form with the horizon, in order that the paper machine\r\nshould rise to the greatest altitude.\r\n\r\n“If the wind be horizontal,” answered Mr. Seymour, “it is evident that\r\nthe inclination of the kite’s surface ought to be the same as that\r\nwhich the rudder of a ship should make with the keel, in order that the\r\nvessel may be turned with the greatest facility; supposing the currents\r\nof water, which impel it, to have a direction parallel to the keel.”\r\n\r\n“And what ought that angle to be?” enquired the vicar.\r\n\r\n“_Fifty-four_ degrees, and _forty-four_ minutes,” replied Mr. Seymour;\r\n“and let me here remark,” continued he, “as we have already considered\r\nthe philosophy of the flight of a bird, that its pinions are so set\r\nupon the body as to bring down the wings in an _oblique_ direction\r\ntowards the tail; so that in their action upon the air, we have the\r\nsame resolution of forces as in that of the wind upon the surface of\r\nthe kite, by which the body of the bird is not only supported, or\r\nraised perpendicularly, but carried forward.”(39)\r\n\r\nTom here interrupted the dialogue, by expressing a regret that he\r\nshould have been provided with so small a quantity of cord.\r\n\r\n“I do not believe, my dear boy, that any advantage could be gained by\r\nan additional quantity of string,” said his father.\r\n\r\n“Is there, then, any reason why the kite should not ascend, even above\r\nthe clouds, provided that my string were sufficiently long and strong?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; indeed is there a most unanswerable reason. Remember that the\r\nkite is made to rise by the operation of two forces; the one afforded\r\nby the wind, the other by the action of the string; now it is quite\r\nevident that, when the weight of the string, added to that of the kite\r\nitself, becomes equal to the force of the wind, acting upon the surface\r\nof the machine, a general balance, or equilibrium, of forces will be\r\nestablished, and the kite can no longer continue to ascend.”\r\n\r\n“Will it, then, remain stationary under these circumstances?” asked\r\nLouisa.\r\n\r\n“It must do so, unless the force of the wind should abate; for it is a\r\nproposition in mechanics, which I shall hereafter endeavour to\r\ndemonstrate(40), that, if a body be acted upon by three forces, which\r\nare proportional to, and in the direction of, the three sides of a\r\ntriangle, it will be kept at rest. The kite is exactly in this\r\npredicament, for its weight, the force of the wind, and the action of\r\nthe string, fulfil these conditions, and consequently keep the kite\r\nstationary.”\r\n\r\n“Then I must give up my intention of trying to raise the kite above the\r\nclouds,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Although you may not be able to raise any single kite to the altitude\r\nyou may desire, it is easy to accomplish your plan by a series of\r\nkites; the string of the first being attached to the back of the\r\nsecond, and so on.”\r\n\r\n“How, papa? I do not exactly understand you.”\r\n\r\n“Your kite,” said Mr. Seymour, “is now as high in the air, as the force\r\nof the wind is capable of raising it; suppose you were to fix the end\r\nof the string you hold in your hand to the back of another kite, would\r\nnot this second kite ascend as high as your first, by the same force,\r\nand your first kite therefore rise to double the altitude it is at\r\npresent. In like manner you might attach a third kite, and so on.”\r\n\r\n“Now I comprehend it; and I should much like to try the experiment,”\r\nsaid Tom.\r\n\r\n“You shall certainly witness the effect I have described; but you must\r\nprovide yourself with some stout string, for the force which the kites\r\nexert when thus arranged, is greater than you can easily imagine;\r\nindeed I question whether you would be able to hold them,” observed his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton here informed the young party that he had himself\r\nwitnessed a carriage containing three persons that had been drawn along\r\nthe road by kites, at the rates from fifteen to twenty miles an hour.\r\n\r\n“I have seen the account of it,” said Mr. Seymour, “and if I remember\r\nright, the principal kite was preceded at the distance of about 120\r\nfeet by a smaller pilot one, which served to direct it away from any\r\nobstacles, such as trees, houses, &c. with which it might otherwise\r\nhave come in contact.”\r\n\r\n“But how was the pilot kite made obedient to the will of the driver?”\r\nasked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“By means of strings so attached to it that its surface was easily made\r\nto alter its angular position,” answered Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“If my twine should snap,” said Tom, whose attention was suddenly drawn\r\nto his kite from a slight unsteadiness in its motion, arising from a\r\ngust of wind, “we could easily recover it, that is one good thing; for\r\nit is hovering over the open field at the end of the heath.”\r\n\r\n“If you imagine that the kite, under such circumstances, would fall\r\nupon the spot directly under it, you are much deceived: recollect that,\r\nif the string should snap, the kite would be abandoned to two forces,\r\nthose of the wind, and its own gravity; and you will perceive that,\r\nunder such circumstances, it could not obey either of them, but would\r\nfall in an intermediate or diagonal direction. This fact will be\r\nrendered apparent by the annexed diagram. B A may be supposed to\r\nrepresent the force and direction of the wind acting upon the kite, and\r\nB D those of its gravity; then it is evident that, under the influence\r\nof these joint forces, it would describe the diagonal, and, for reasons\r\nalready explained, that line must necessarily be the _curve_ B F.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing arc of fall trajectory.]\r\n\r\n“Come,” said the vicar, “before Tom draws down his kite, let us send up\r\na _messenger_.”\r\n\r\n“What may that be?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“A piece of paper or pasteboard, which, on being introduced upon the\r\nstring, is blown along the line up to the kite.”\r\n\r\nThe _messenger_ was accordingly prepared, and being placed upon the\r\nstring, it ascended as Mr. Seymour had anticipated. While this\r\noperation was in progress, the vicar stood earnestly gazing upon the\r\nkite, and, at length, burst forth in the following animated soliloquy:--\r\n\r\n“Assuredly, this must be acknowledged as a most beautiful and imposing\r\ntoy! Fastidious or insensible must be that person, who does not feel\r\nexhilarated as he gazes on the kite, proudly floating under the canopy\r\nof heaven, and reflecting the departing smiles of the evening sun,\r\nafter it has ceased to cheer us below.”\r\n\r\n“It has been said,” observed Mr. Seymour, “to the disparagement of\r\nkite-flying, that as soon as the machine has been raised into the air,\r\nand all the string let out, the excitement of the sport is at an end,\r\nand that as nothing further can be achieved, the interest of the\r\nperformer from that moment begins to languish; now at this period the\r\n_messenger_ will open a new source of pleasure and instruction, and\r\nmay, by a little ingenuity, be made to afford a great diversity of\r\namusement. I have therefore provided myself with several varieties of\r\nthis machine. Here is one in the form of a dragon, which, as it\r\nascends, produces a very striking and almost magical effect. See, there\r\nit goes!”\r\n\r\nThe children were delighted, for the string upon which it was carried\r\nbecame at a certain height invisible; so that the figure appeared like\r\na monster hovering in the air.\r\n\r\n“I will now show you a _winged_ variety of this apparatus, which we\r\nwill name the _Brompton Messenger_.[44] It consists of a hollow\r\ncylinder of stiff pasteboard, or thin wood, the diameter of which is\r\nsufficiently large to allow its free revolution round the string of the\r\nkite. To this cylinder are attached several flappers, or sails, in an\r\noblique direction, like those of a windmill, each of which is covered\r\nwith paper of a different colour. The action of the wind upon those\r\noblique surfaces necessarily occasions a rapid rotation, upon a\r\nprinciple which I shall presently explain; and the beautiful effect\r\nthus produced, as the whirling body ascends, must be seen before it can\r\nbe appreciated. I have some other contrivances of a similar nature,\r\nwhich it is my intention to prepare for your future amusement.”(41)\r\n\r\n“Has the kite ever been applied to any useful purposes?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered his father. “It was by means of the kite that Dr.\r\nFranklin was enabled to demonstrate the identity of electricity and the\r\ncause of lightning, and thus to disclose one of the most awful\r\nmysteries of nature.”\r\n\r\n“Pray do tell us something about this electrical kite, papa,” said\r\nLouisa.\r\n\r\n“Not at present, my love; it would divert us too much from the subjects\r\nin which we are engaged: at some future period I shall have much\r\npleasure in introducing you into these fairy regions of philosophy.”\r\n\r\n“I just now remember reading in Miss Edgeworth’s Harry and Lucy,” said\r\nLouisa, “something about a kite and Pompey’s pillar.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad that you have reminded me of that story,” replied Mr.\r\nSeymour: “I will relate it to you. Some English sailors laid a wager,\r\nthat they would drink a bowl of punch on the summit of Pompey’s pillar.\r\nNow, that pillar is almost a hundred feet high, and it is quite smooth,\r\nso that there was no way of climbing to the top, even for sailors, who\r\nare such experienced climbers: so they flew their kite exactly over the\r\npillar, and when it came down on the opposite side, the string lay\r\nacross the top of the capital. By means of this string, they pulled a\r\nsmall rope over, and by this a larger one, that was able to bear the\r\nweight of a man; a pulley was then fastened to the end of the large\r\nrope, and drawn close up to the upper edge of the capital; and then,\r\nyou perceive, they could easily hoist each other up. They did more, for\r\nthey hoisted the English flag on the top, and then drank the bowl of\r\npunch, and won their wager.”\r\n\r\n“That is a very good story,” said the vicar; “but I cannot help\r\nregretting that so much ingenuity and labour should not have had a\r\nnobler end to accomplish.”\r\n\r\n“There is some truth in that observation,” said Mr. Seymour, “and I\r\nwill, therefore, relate another story which shall be more congenial to\r\nyour heart, and in which the kite will present itself in a more\r\ninteresting point of view; for, instead of enabling the sailors to\r\ndrink a bowl of punch at an altitude otherwise inaccessible, we shall\r\nfind it engaged in rescuing them from the horrors of shipwreck.”[45]\r\n\r\n“Pray proceed, papa.”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear, upon reflection, I think it will be better that we should\r\npostpone the story, until your return to the lodge, when you shall read\r\nit in ‘Harry and Lucy.’ I will also point out to you, in the same work,\r\nan account of a new and useful application of the messenger, which will\r\nprove to you how successfully the faculties of youth may be increased\r\nand improved by those very amusements which are too generally regarded\r\nas idle and unprofitable: I shall at the same time exhibit one or two\r\nexperiments in illustration of the nature and causes of wind.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we not return immediately?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear; it would not be in my power to attend you at present; but\r\njoin me in the library after dinner; Mr. Twaddleton will now accompany\r\nme to the village, and do you remain and enjoy the amusement of your\r\nkite.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until the evening, that Tom and his sisters requested their\r\nfather to fulfil the promises he had made them in the morning.\r\n\r\n“You told us,” said Louisa, “that you would give us some information\r\nabout the wind; the subject has been puzzling me ever since, for I\r\ncannot make out the cause of it.”\r\n\r\n“Wind, my love, is nothing more than air in motion; and is produced by\r\na large volume of it flowing in a current, or stream, from one place,\r\nor region, to another, and with different velocities.”\r\n\r\n“And what can produce these currents?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“After the explanation of the action of the pump, I do not think that I\r\nshall have much difficulty in making you understand the nature of the\r\noperations by which wind is occasioned. Suppose a partial vacuum should\r\nbe formed in any region, would not the neighbouring air immediately\r\nrush in to supply the deficiency and restore the balance?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly; from the pressure of the air behind it.”\r\n\r\n“Heat,” continued Mr. Seymour, “will produce a partial vacuum, by\r\nrarefying the air, and thus rendering it lighter; in consequence of\r\nwhich, it will ascend, and the colder air will rush in to supply its\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“I do not exactly see why the rarefied air should ascend,” observed\r\nLouisa. “It appears to offer an exception to the general law of\r\ngravity.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; on the contrary, its ascent is occasioned by the force of\r\ngravity: in the first place, however, to prove the fact that heated air\r\ndoes actually ascend, we have only to observe the direction of smoke,\r\nas it issues from the chimney; this consists of minute particles of\r\nfuel carried up, by a current of heated air, from the fire below; and\r\nas soon as this current is cooled by mixing with that of the\r\natmosphere, the minute particles of coal fall, and produce the small\r\nblack flakes which render the air, and every thing in contact with it,\r\nso dirty in a populous city.”\r\n\r\n“But I want to know, papa, what it is which causes the hot air to\r\nascend?”\r\n\r\n“The greater weight of the cold air above it, which gets, as it were,\r\nbeneath the lighter air, and obliges it to rise; just in the same way\r\nas a piece of cork, at the bottom of an empty vessel, is made to rise\r\nto the surface of the water which may be poured into it.”\r\n\r\n“Now I understand it; pray, therefore, proceed with your account of the\r\nwind. You have just said that heat rarefies the air, and causes it to\r\nascend.”\r\n\r\n“And thus produces a current of air, or a _wind_.”\r\n\r\n“Is heat, then, the cause of wind, papa?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“It is one great cause; but there are, probably, several others; I\r\nwill, however, exemplify this subject by an experiment.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Mr. Seymour produced a water-plate, a large dish, and a jug\r\nfilled with cold water. The bell was rung, and the servant entered with\r\na tea-kettle of boiling water.\r\n\r\nThe large dish was then filled with the cold, and the water-plate with\r\nthe boiling fluid.\r\n\r\n“Let this large dish represent the ocean,” said Mr. Seymour, “and this\r\nwater-plate, which I will now place in its centre, an island in that\r\nocean; for the land, from receiving the rays of the sun, will be more\r\nheated than the water, and will consequently rarefy the air above\r\nit.--Now, Tom, light me the wax taper.”\r\n\r\n“I have done so.”\r\n\r\n“Then now blow it out.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot imagine what you are about, papa;--‘Light the candle, and\r\nthen blow it out!’--but it still smokes, shall I put the extinguisher\r\nover it?”\r\n\r\n“By no means; give it to me, and observe what will happen when I carry\r\nit round the edge of the dish.”\r\n\r\n“The smoke goes to the centre,” exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\n“Showing, thereby, the existence of a current towards the water-plate,\r\nor island; in consequence of the air above it having been heated, and\r\ntherefore rarefied. This explains in a very satisfactory manner, a fact\r\nwhich may be constantly observed in our own climate, viz. a gentle\r\nbreeze blowing from the sea to the land in the heat of the day. Upon\r\nthe same principle it is, that most of the winds in different parts of\r\nthe globe may be readily accounted for.”(42)\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Tom, “that the air must rush with great velocity, in\r\norder to produce wind.”\r\n\r\n“A very general error prevails upon this subject,” replied his father;\r\n“the rate of motion has been greatly exaggerated. In a brisk gale,\r\neven, the wind does not travel with such velocity, but that it may be\r\neasily traced by the eye; and the sailor is able to watch its progress\r\nby the ripple which it produces on the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Has, then, the rate of its motion ever been estimated?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“When its velocity is about two miles per hour, it is only just\r\nperceptible. In a high wind, the air travels thirty or forty miles in\r\nthe same period. In a storm, its rate has been computed as being from\r\nsixty to eighty miles. It has also been ascertained, by experiment,\r\nthat the air, as it rushes from a pair of blacksmith’s bellows, has not\r\na velocity above that of five and forty miles in the hour.”\r\n\r\n“At what rate should you think the air travelled this morning, when we\r\nflew our kite?” enquired Louisa.\r\n\r\n“I should think at about five miles an hour, for it was a pleasant but\r\ngentle breeze.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  The author has been thus minute, in order to afford his young friends\r\n  clear directions for constructing a kite, and which, as far as he\r\n  knows, are not to be found in any work hitherto published; and he\r\n  will also avail himself of this opportunity to state, that the thin\r\n  glazed linen of various colours, commonly known to haberdashers by\r\n  the name of lining, has been found to be the best material as a\r\n  covering for the kite. It is not only more durable than paper,\r\n  defying the most boisterous wind, but superior to it as being secure\r\n  from the effects of a shower of rain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  Those readers, who are inclined to enter more deeply into the\r\n  subject, may consult, with advantage, a memoir on the kite, by Euler,\r\n  published in the Transactions of the Academy of Berlin for the year\r\n  1756.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  See p. 60.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  From associations of an interesting nature connected with the\r\n  residence of the author’s children.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, vol. xli.;\r\n  and Miss Edgeworth’s Harry and Lucy, vol. iv. p. 288.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Children playing with paddles and a shuttlecock.]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n _A short discourse.--The Shuttlecock.--The solution of two problems\r\n    connected with its flight.--The Windmill.--The Smoke-jack.--A\r\n    toy constructed on the same principle.--The Bow and\r\n    Arrow.--Archery.--The arrival of Isabella Villers._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton, on his arrival at the lodge, on the following morning,\r\nwas informed that Miss Villers was expected at Overton in the evening.\r\n\r\n“Your account of that young lady,” observed the vicar, “has greatly\r\nprepossessed me in her favour; I only hope that she is not too _blue_.”\r\n\r\n“I care not how blue the stockings of a lady may be,” said Mr. Seymour,\r\n“‘provided her petticoats be long enough to hide them;’ and from my\r\nknowledge of Miss Villers, I can assure you, exalted as are her\r\nattainments, they are so veiled by feminine delicacy and reserve, that\r\nthey may insidiously win, but will never extort our homage.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay,” exclaimed the vicar; “I perfectly agree with you in your idea\r\nof feminine perfection--short tongues and long petticoats, Mr.\r\nSeymour.--But where are my little playmates?”\r\n\r\n“I left Tom and Fanny on the terrace, a short time since,” replied Mr.\r\nSeymour, “very busily engaged in the game of shuttlecock and\r\nbattledoor.”\r\n\r\n“The shuttlecock is an ancient sport,” observed Mr. Twaddleton. “It is\r\nrepresented in a manuscript as far back as the fourteenth century: and\r\nit became a fashionable game amongst grown persons in the reign of\r\nJames the First.”\r\n\r\n“It is a very healthy pastime,” said Mr. Seymour, “and, in my opinion,\r\nis admirably calculated for females; for, it expands the chest, while\r\nit creates a graceful pliancy of the limbs.”\r\n\r\n“I entirely agree with you; it is the only game with which I am\r\nacquainted, in which muscular exercise is gained without compromising\r\ngracefulness. But see, here come the two young rogues.”\r\n\r\n“Papa,” exclaimed Tom, “I have been considering whether there is any\r\nphilosophy in the game of shuttlecock.”\r\n\r\n“There are two circumstances connected with its flight,” replied his\r\nfather, “which certainly will admit of explanation upon scientific\r\nprinciples; and I should much like to hear whether you can apply them\r\nfor that purpose. The first is its spinning motion in the air; the\r\nsecond, the regularity with which its base of cork always presents\r\nitself to the battledoor; so that, after you have struck it, it turns\r\nround, and arrives at your sister’s battledoor in a position to be\r\nagain struck by her, and sent back to you.”\r\n\r\n“I perfectly understand what you mean; but I really am not able to\r\nexplain the motions to which you allude,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“The revolution of the shuttlecock, about its axis, entirely depends\r\nupon the impulse of the wind on the oblique surfaces of its feathers;\r\nso that it is often necessary to trim the feathers of a new\r\nshuttlecock, before it will spin.”\r\n\r\n“I understand you, papa; the force of the wind, by striking the oblique\r\nfeathers, is resolved into a perpendicular and parallel force, as you\r\nexplained to us, when we considered the action of the wind upon the\r\nkite.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly; every oblique direction of a motion is the diagonal of a\r\nparallelogram, whose perpendicular and parallel directions are the two\r\nsides. Having settled this point, let us consider the second; viz. how\r\nit happens that the cork of the shuttlecock always presents itself to\r\nthe battledoor.”\r\n\r\n“I should think,” said Tom, “that the cork points to the battledoor for\r\nthe same reason that the weathercock always points to the wind.”\r\n\r\n“Admirably illustrated!” exclaimed his father; “the cork will always go\r\nforemost; because the air must exert a greater force over the lighter\r\nfeathers, and therefore retard their progress. While we are upon this\r\nsubject, I will introduce to your notice some contrivances which are\r\nindebted to this same principle for their operation. In the first\r\nplace, there is the arrow; can you tell me, Louisa, the use of the\r\nfeathers which are placed round its extremity?”\r\n\r\n“To make its head proceed foremost in the air, by rendering its other\r\nend lighter, and therefore more sensible to the resistance of the air,”\r\nreplied Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Very well answered; that is, unquestionably, one of the objects of the\r\nwings of an arrow; but there is also another, that of _rifling_ it, or\r\nsteadying its progressive motion, by causing it to revolve around its\r\naxis. If you will look at this arrow, you will perceive that the\r\nfeathers are placed nearly, but not quite, in planes passing through\r\nit; if the feathers were exactly in this plane, the air could not\r\nstrike against their surfaces when the arrow is in motion: but, since\r\nthey are not perfectly straight, but always a little aslant, the air\r\nnecessarily strikes them, as the arrow moves forward; by which force\r\nthe feathers are turned round, and with them the arrow or reed; so that\r\na motion is generated about its axis; and its velocity will increase\r\nwith the obliquity of the feathers. You will therefore observe that, in\r\norder to enable the feathers to offer a necessary resistance to the\r\nair, they must possess a certain degree of stiffness or inflexibility.\r\nIt was on this account that Roger Ascham,[46] and other skilful artists\r\nin the days of archery, preferred the feathers of a goose of two or\r\nthree years old, especially such as drop of themselves, for pluming the\r\narrow; and the importance, as well as the theory of this choice, is\r\nconfirmed by a curious observation of Gervase Markham,[47] who says\r\nthat ‘the peacock feather was sometimes used at the short butt; yet,\r\nseldom or ever, _did it keep the shaft either right or level_!’”(43)\r\n\r\n“That is intelligible enough,” said Tom, “the feather of the peacock\r\nmust have been so flexible as to have yielded to the slightest breath\r\nof air; and now, as we are upon the subject of the arrow, do explain to\r\nus the action of the bow.”\r\n\r\n“I shall readily comply with your request, before we part; but I am\r\ndesirous, at present, of following up the subject before us, and of\r\ntaking into consideration some other instruments which owe their\r\nmotions to the action of the air upon oblique surfaces.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose,” said the vicar, “you explain to them the action of the wind\r\nupon the sails of the mill.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to hear something about the windmill,” observed Tom;\r\n“and, perhaps, Mr. Twaddleton can tell us who invented the machine.”\r\n\r\n“The invention is not of very remote date,” replied the vicar.\r\n“According to some authors, windmills were first used in France in the\r\nsixth century; while others maintain that they were brought to Europe\r\nin the time of the crusades, and that they had long been employed in\r\nthe East, where the scarcity of water precluded the application of that\r\npowerful agent to machinery.”\r\n\r\n“I had intended,” said Mr. Seymour, “to have entered very fully upon\r\nthe subject of the windmill; for, although it is a very common machine,\r\nits construction is much more ingenious than is generally imagined; it\r\nmust also be allowed to have a degree of perfection, to which few of\r\nthe popular engines have yet arrived: but to do ample justice to my\r\nsubject, I should require several models which are not yet in\r\nreadiness; besides, Tom’s holidays have nearly passed away; I must\r\ntherefore postpone the examination of the mill to some future\r\nopportunity, and content myself, at present, with an explanation of its\r\nsails.”\r\n\r\n“And let me tell you,” observed the vicar, “that if you succeed in this\r\none object, you will accomplish a task which has occupied years of\r\nmechanical research. The angle which the surface of the sails ought to\r\nmake with their axis, in order that the wind may have the greatest\r\neffect, or the degree of _weathering_, as the millwrights call it, is a\r\nmatter of nice enquiry, and has much engaged the thoughts of the\r\nmathematicians.”\r\n\r\n“My remarks upon that subject will be very general,” said Mr. Seymour;\r\n“I shall explain the principle, without entering into the minutiæ of\r\nits applications. The vertical windmill, which is the kind in most\r\ncommon use, consists, as you well know, of an axis, or shaft, placed in\r\nthe direction of the wind, and usually inclining a little upwards from\r\nthe horizontal line. At one end of this, four long arms, or yards, are\r\nfixed perpendicular to the axis, and across each other at right angles;\r\nthese afford a surface, on which a cloth can be spread to receive the\r\naction of the wind. To conceive why these sails should revolve by the\r\nforce of the wind, we must have recourse to the theory of compound\r\nmotion. It is very evident that, if a mill exposed directly to the wind\r\nshould have its four sails perpendicular to the common axis in which\r\nthey are fitted, they would receive the wind perpendicularly, an\r\nimpulse which could only tend to overturn them; there is a necessity,\r\ntherefore, to have them oblique to the common axis, that they may\r\nreceive the wind obliquely, when their effort to recede from it causes\r\nthem to tarn round with the axis; and the four sails being all made\r\noblique in the same direction, thus unite their efforts for the common\r\nobject.”\r\n\r\n“You have not yet told us what degree of obliquity the sail ought to\r\nmake with the wind,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“The same as the kite ought to make, _fifty-four_ degrees and\r\n_forty-four_ minutes,” replied Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Do you not remember, papa, when we were last in London, you pointed\r\nout to us a curious mill on the banks of the river, which went without\r\nany sails?”\r\n\r\n“You allude to the horizontal mill at Battersea.”\r\n\r\n“I remember it was at Battersea,” observed Louisa; “and I dare say,\r\npapa, that you recollect the strange story which the waterman, who\r\nrowed us down the river, told Tom and myself. He said ‘that, when the\r\nEmperor of Russia was in London, he took a fancy to the neat little\r\nchurch at Battersea, and determined to carry it off to Russia; and that\r\nfor this purpose he had sent a large packing-case; but, as the\r\ninhabitants refused to let the church be carried away, the case\r\nremained on the spot where it was deposited.’”\r\n\r\n“It is not a bad story,” said her father; “for the mill certainly, both\r\nin size and figure, may be imagined to resemble a gigantic\r\npacking-case. The mill, of which you are speaking, has been taken down,\r\nin consequence of its use having been superseded by the introduction of\r\nsteam. It was erected by Captain Hooper, who also built a similar one\r\nat Margate. It consisted of a circular wheel, having large boards or\r\nvanes fixed parallel to its axis, and arranged at equal distances from\r\neach other. Upon these vanes the wind could act, so as to blow the\r\nwheel round; but had it acted upon the vane at both sides of the wheel,\r\nat once, it is evident that it could not have had any tendency to turn\r\nit round; hence, one side of the wheel was sheltered, while the other\r\nwas submitted to the full action of the wind. For this purpose it was\r\nenclosed within a large cylindrical framework, furnished with doors or\r\nshutters, on all sides, to open at pleasure and admit the wind, or to\r\nshut and stop it. If all the shutters on one side were open, whilst all\r\nthose on the opposite side were closed, the wind, acting with\r\nundiminished force on the vanes at one side, whilst the opposite vanes\r\nwere under shelter, turned the mill round; but whenever the wind\r\nchanged, the disposition of the blinds was altered, to admit the wind\r\nto strike upon the vanes of the wheel in the direction of a tangent to\r\nthe circle in which they moved.”\r\n\r\n“Well; have you any other machine to explain to your scholars?” asked\r\nthe vicar; “for,” continued he, “I am anxious to present them with a\r\nbow and arrow which I have provided for their amusement.”\r\n\r\n“I will, if you please, first describe to them the mechanism of the\r\nsmoke-jack; and I am desirous of doing so, as I have a very pleasing\r\nexperiment to exhibit, which is founded upon the same principle.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then described the more common form of this machine. It\r\nconsisted, he said, of a number of vanes, of thin sheet-iron, arranged\r\nin a circle, as here represented, but all set obliquely at a proper\r\nangle of inclination. Its action was explained in the following\r\nmanner:--When a fire is kindled in the chimney, the air which, by its\r\nrarefaction, immediately tends to ascend, strikes on the surfaces of\r\nthe inclined vanes, and by a resolution of forces, similar to that\r\nalready explained, causes the spindle, to which they are affixed, to\r\nturn round, and consequently communicates the same motion to the spit.\r\nThe brisker the fire becomes, the quicker will the machine move,\r\nbecause in that case, the air ascends with greater rapidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Smoke-jack.]\r\n\r\n“I will now exhibit to you a mechanical amusement which is founded on\r\nthe same principle,” said Mr. Seymour. “Fetch me the piece of\r\npasteboard which lies on the library table.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simple spiral shape.]\r\n\r\nThe pasteboard was produced, and Mr. Seymour described upon it a\r\nspiral, similar to that which is represented in the annexed figure. The\r\nspiral was cut out, and extended, by raising the centre above the first\r\nrevolution. It was then suspended upon a small spit of iron, which had\r\nbeen previously prepared; by applying the centre or summit of its\r\nspiral to its point. The whole was now placed on the top of a warm\r\nstove, (the application of a lamp would have answered the same\r\npurpose,) and the machine, to the great delight and astonishment of the\r\nchildren, soon put itself in motion, and turned without the assistance\r\nof any apparent agent. The agent, however, in this case, was the air,\r\nwhich being rarefied by the contact of a warm body, ascended, and thus\r\nproduced a current. The accompanying sketch may render this experiment\r\nmore intelligible to the reader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Mechanical amusement” described above.]\r\n\r\nThe vicar observed that, to him, the experiment was perfectly novel;\r\nalthough he remembered having seen what he now supposed must have been\r\na similar contrivance, but which, until that moment, he had always\r\nconsidered as the effect of clockwork.\r\n\r\n“And what might that have been?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“The revolution of a serpent, which I noticed in several windows in\r\nLondon, during a late illumination.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly; it was nothing more than a spiral, so painted as to\r\nresemble that reptile, and which owed its motion to the action of air\r\nheated by a lamp placed beneath it.”\r\n\r\n“Now, then,” exclaimed the vicar, “let us direct our attention to the\r\nbow and arrow; see the present I have provided for you, Tom!”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the worthy clergyman produced a bow and a number of arrows,\r\ntogether with a target; which, at his desire, had been sent from London.\r\n\r\n“I think,” observed Mr. Seymour, “that you should accompany your gift\r\nwith some account of archery, or the art and exercise of shooting with\r\nthe bow and arrow.”\r\n\r\n“That will I readily do,” replied Mr. Twaddleton; who accordingly\r\nproceeded as follows:--\r\n\r\n“The bow is the most ancient and universal of all weapons, and has been\r\nfound to obtain amongst the most barbarous and remote nations. In the\r\ndays of David the practice of the bow would appear to have been so\r\ngeneral, that it was not unfrequently made use of as a figure of\r\nspeech. Israel, when blessing his sons, says of Joseph, ‘the _archers_\r\nhave sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him; but his _bow_\r\nabode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong, by the\r\nhands of the mighty God of Jacob.’”\r\n\r\n“Its earliest application was probably for the purpose of obtaining\r\nfood,” observed Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Your conjecture has the weight of testimony,” replied the vicar; “when\r\nIsaac sent Esau to the forest, he said, ‘Take, I pray thee, thy\r\nweapons, thy quiver, and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me\r\nsome venison:’[48] and it is even a question, whether the _Saxon_ bow\r\nwas ever used by the Anglo-Saxons and Danes for any other purpose than\r\nthat of procuring food, or pastime; for the representation of this bow,\r\nin an ancient manuscript[49] of the tenth century, shows it to have\r\nbeen very differently constructed from what one might expect in a\r\nmilitary weapon; in size, too, it was a mere toy, compared with the bow\r\nof succeeding ages.”\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt that the bow and arrow were employed for the\r\npurpose of killing animals for food from the earliest times; but its\r\nprincipal interest is derived from its military applications; will you,\r\ntherefore, give us a sketch of its history, and confine yourself to its\r\npractice as a warlike instrument in England?”\r\n\r\n“And may I also beg of you, my dear sir,” added Mrs. Seymour, “to\r\nexplain the different terms which are employed to denote its parts and\r\napplications; such information will be, just now, highly acceptable to\r\nme, as I am reading some romances, in which those terms are constantly\r\noccurring.”\r\n\r\n“You shall be obeyed, madam,” replied the vicar, with a courteous smile.\r\n\r\n“We are, probably, indebted to the Norman conquest for the introduction\r\nof the bow and arrow as a hostile weapon; but, before I enter upon that\r\nsubject, it is necessary to state, that the bows in use in England,\r\nhave been of two kinds, the common or _long_ bow, and the _cross_ bow.\r\nThe former does not require any description from me, the latter, or\r\n_Arbalet_, as it was called, (from _Arbalesta_, i. e. _arcu-balista_, a\r\nbow with a sling,) consists of a steel bow, fastened upon a stock, and\r\nis discharged by means of a catch, or _trigger_, which probably gave\r\nrise to the lock upon the modern musket.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse the interruption,” said Mrs. Seymour, “but do allow me to ask\r\nwhether _Arquebusade_ does not derive its name from its having been\r\nformerly applied to wounds inflicted by the cross-bow or _Arbalet_?”\r\n\r\n“I thank you, madam; that etymology is entirely new to me, and will\r\nexplain the medical name, _Aqua vulneraria_, which has been applied to\r\nthat spirit.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar now proceeded without further interruption.\r\n\r\n“The invention of cross-bows is said by ancient writers to have come\r\nfrom the Sicilians. They were first used in England by the Normans at\r\nthe battle of Hastings; and a _quarrel_ or _bar-bolt_ (which is\r\nsynonymous with the arrow of the long-bow) was the immediate cause of\r\nHarold’s death. In the reign of Stephen, in 1139, the second council of\r\nLateran prohibited their use; and some historians assert, that they\r\nwere not again used in this country till the reign of Richard I., whose\r\ndeath, occasioned by one at Chaluz, was considered as a judgment on his\r\nimpiety. From the death of Richard till the splendid victories of\r\nEdward III., we hear little of the cross-bow as a military weapon. Its\r\nuse appears to have been principally confined to the sieges of\r\nfortified places, and to sea-fights. In 1346, at the battle of Cressy,\r\na large body of Genoese soldiers, who were particularly expert in its\r\nmanagement, were in the service of the French; but at the commencement\r\nof the action, a sudden shower wetted the strings, and prevented the\r\narchers from doing their usual execution, while the English were still\r\ncapable of annoying their enemies by the long-bow with complete\r\nsuccess: both this victory and that of Poictiers, ten years afterwards,\r\nwere chiefly ascribed by the English to their archers. In 1403, at the\r\nbattle of Shrewsbury, where Hotspur was slain, the archers on both\r\nsides did terrible execution; and the victory of Agincourt, in 1417,\r\nwas entirely owing to their skill. Under Edward IV. an ordinance was\r\nmade, that every Englishman and Irishman, dwelling in England, should\r\nhave a bow of his own height, to be made of yew, wych, hazel, ash, or\r\nany other seasonable tree, according to their power. By Henry VII. and\r\nhis son Henry VIII. the use of the cross-bow was entirely forbidden;\r\nand a penalty of ten pounds was to be inflicted on every man in whose\r\nhouse one might be found. From this time they seem to have been chiefly\r\nused for killing deer.[50] Henry VIII. compelled every father to\r\nprovide a long-bow and two arrows for his son at seven years old.\r\nEdward VI., Elizabeth, and James, all encouraged archery: John Lyon,\r\nwho founded Harrow school in 1590, two years before his death, drew up\r\nrules for its direction, whereby the amusements of the scholars were\r\nconfined to ‘driving a top, tossing a hand-ball, running, and\r\nshooting.’ The last mentioned diversion is in a manner insisted on by\r\nthe founder, who requires all parents to furnish their children with\r\nbow-strings, shafts, and tresters, to exercise shooting. A silver arrow\r\nused some years ago to be shot for by the young gentlemen of that\r\nschool.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar concluded, and received the thanks of the party for the\r\ninteresting information he had afforded them.\r\n\r\n“There is one circumstance connected with the military history of the\r\nlong-bow,” said Mrs. Seymour, “which has somewhat surprised me; and\r\nthat is, why it should so long have continued in estimation after the\r\nuse of gunpowder.”\r\n\r\n“That circumstance,” replied her husband, “will cease to astonish you,\r\nwhen you remember that, until the last century, muskets were very\r\nunwieldy instruments; they were never used without a rest; had no\r\nbayonets, and could not be so frequently discharged as they are at\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said the vicar, “I perceive that the children are impatient to\r\ntry their skill with their new instrument; let us walk out, and I will\r\nplay the Scythian[51] upon this occasion.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Tom,” cried Mr. Twaddleton; “we must have an object. Let me see.\r\nShall it be the ‘_but_,’ ‘_pricke_,’ or ‘_roaver_?’[52] Come, try\r\nwhether you can hit yonder gate-post. Take your bow, and here is an\r\narrow.”\r\n\r\nTom took the bow, and placing the arrow on the string, was about to\r\ndraw the latter, when the vicar exclaimed, “Stop--stop--you must pull\r\nback your hand to your right ear, in order to shoot the arrow; whereas\r\nyou have placed the bow directly before you, and are about to return\r\nyour hand to the right breast.”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said Tom, “that was the proper position; for I remember\r\nreading of the Amazonian women, who are said to have parted with their\r\nright breasts, lest they should prove an impediment to their using the\r\nbow.”\r\n\r\n“I do not mean to assert,” replied the vicar, “that there is not ample\r\nclassical authority for your proceeding. The Amazons undoubtedly shot\r\ntheir arrows in such a position; and so, in truth, did the primitive\r\nGrecians; although the ancient Persians drew the arrow to the ear,\r\naccording to the fashion of later ages, and which I greatly prefer for\r\nits superior convenience. You may also recollect, as you have been\r\nlately reading ‘The Tales of a Grandfather,’ that the superiority of\r\nthe English archers was ascribed to this mode of using their bows; the\r\nwords of Sir W. Scott, if I rightly recollect, are these, ‘The archers\r\nof England were taught to draw the bow-string to their right ear, while\r\nother European nations only drew it to the breast.’ Now,” continued the\r\nvicar, “if you try the difference of these postures, you will find that\r\na much longer arrow can be drawn to the ear than to the breast, because\r\nthe right arm has more room.”\r\n\r\nThe party now amused themselves for some time; each shooting in his\r\nturn at the mark which was chosen for the trial; and with a success\r\nwhich, considering it was their first attempt, the vicar declared to be\r\n“quite marvellous.”\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the sport, Mr. Twaddleton informed his friends,\r\nthat parochial duties required his attendance at the vestry, but Mr.\r\nSeymour told him that he should expect his company in the evening.\r\n\r\nIt was just six o’clock, when the sound of the porter’s bell, and the\r\nrolling of carriage-wheels, announced the approach of some important\r\nstranger to the lodge. It was Miss Villers. Were this a romance rather\r\nthan an instructive history, we should, at once, charge our pencil with\r\nthe glowing hues of the rainbow, and proceed to colour the outline\r\nwhich the imagination of the reader must have already sketched: but the\r\ncharacter of the present composition fortunately renders such a task\r\nunnecessary; we say “fortunately,” for the magazines of romance have\r\nactually become insolvent from the numerous and heavy drafts of the\r\nnovel-writer; the regions of fancy have been so despoiled of their\r\nblossoms, that scarcely a flower can be culled by him who would entwine\r\na garland for the brow of his heroine; and such even as may have\r\nescaped the grasp of this voracious horde, will be found to have faded\r\nunder the withering influence of those insects of literature, which,\r\nfluttering or creeping about their petals, have rendered their\r\nfragrance pestilential, and turned their honey into bitterness. Where\r\ncan be found the emblem of that damask lip which, arched like the bow\r\nof Cupid, shot an unerring dart, whenever a smile relaxed its tension?\r\nWe might describe the perfect symmetry of her form, but what language\r\ncould convey to the mind’s eye the witcheries with which the graces had\r\nsurrounded it? We might depict the features of her countenance, but how\r\ncould we catch and fix the varying expressions which lighted it up with\r\nthe magic glow of intelligence? We must, therefore, exercise the\r\njudgment of Timanthes, and leave the reader to the sway of his own\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  Toxoph. ed. 1571. folio 166.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Markham’s Art of Archerie, 1634.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  Gen. xlix. 23, 24.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  MS.

The children,\r\nof course, had a holiday; but was it a holiday? Tom and his sister have\r\nbeen frequently heard to declare that they never passed a more dull and\r\nlistless day; and on resuming their scientific sports, their manner\r\nsufficiently testified that increased pleasure which always accompanies\r\nour return to an agreeable occupation.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Twaddleton,” said Miss Villers, addressing the worthy vicar as he\r\nentered the library at Overton, “I am happy to say that Major Snapwell\r\nhas consented to pass a few days with us, and I learn from him that you\r\nhave been most delightfully engaged in promoting a new scheme of\r\nscientific instruction; it is a subject which greatly interests me, and\r\nI shall be most happy in being allowed to become one of your party. To\r\nthe merits of this system I am no stranger,” continued the lady, “nor\r\nam I unacquainted, sir, with the advantages which your antiquarian\r\nknowledge has conferred; you have garnished the intellectual banquet\r\nwith some of the choicest flowers of literature.”\r\n\r\n“You do me far too much honour, madam,” said the vicar, as a gracious\r\nsmile flitted over his countenance; “but I rejoice to find that you\r\nattach a becoming importance to the researches of the antiquary. May I\r\nbe allowed to hope that you will favour me with a visit at the\r\nvicarage, and inspect my poor collection of antiques?”\r\n\r\n“I anticipate a great treat, I do assure you,” said Miss Villers; “but\r\nyou speak too humbly of a collection which the major informs me\r\ncontains some of the rarest relics of ancient days.”\r\n\r\n“The major, madam, is no doubt a judge, an excellent judge, although he\r\nis occasionally----but no matter--no matter. I certainly, as he justly\r\nsays, do possess some few remarkable specimens. I have, for instance,\r\nan undoubted specimen of the leathern money coined by John of France;\r\nsome very tolerable samples of tapestry of the ‘high and low warp;’ a\r\nseries of sigilla or seals; as well as an interesting collection of\r\nimpressions in wax, taken from grants of William the Conqueror, and\r\nwhat is curious, the colour of these waxen impressions is, without any\r\nexception, green, with a view, as it has been said, to signify that the\r\nacts should for ever continue fresh and in force. Let me consider,”\r\ncontinued the vicar, “what other curiosities can I display for your\r\ndelight and approbation? Rock-basins; yes, the rock-basins from\r\nCarn-breh. Ay, madam, you will be quite astonished at a specimen\r\nwhich--” At this instant, Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, followed by the\r\nchildren, entered the apartment, and abruptly cut the thread of the\r\nvicar’s harangue.\r\n\r\n“What do I hear?” exclaimed Mr. Seymour. “Rock-basins! for mercy’s\r\nsake, my dear vicar, let us not again dive into those horrid basins of\r\nDruidism; do but consider the martyrdom I have suffered on account of\r\nthose pools of lustration.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” replied the vicar pettishly, “I will consent to reserve\r\nthe question for Miss Villers’s opinion, who, I have no doubt, will\r\nreadily assent to their authenticity. But I have another treasure\r\nlately obtained from Cornwall, which you have not yet seen--a\r\nSepulchral stone!--‘_In vestibulo astat_,’ as the poet has it.”\r\n\r\n“Why I never observed it as I passed through the entrance,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” observed the vicar, “the _Vestibule_, if you please. You\r\ndoubtless know it was a custom amongst the Romans to have an altar\r\nsacred to Vesta in the entrance of their houses, and hence the\r\nterm;--but I beg a thousand pardons--‘_venia sit dicto_’--I am perhaps\r\ntoo critical.”\r\n\r\n“Not only pardon, but thanks, my dear sir, for the information you have\r\nafforded us,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nMiss Villers was now invited to be present at one of the scientific\r\nconversations.\r\n\r\n“I shall be grateful to you for so pleasing a privilege,” observed the\r\nyoung lady; “and,” continued she, “may I be allowed to ask whether you\r\nhave not been lately teaching my young friends the operation of those\r\nvarious toys, which act by the force of the air; the object I have in\r\nview in asking this question you shall presently hear.”\r\n\r\n“Papa has lately taught us the reason of the kite’s ascent, and the\r\naction of the squirt, sucker, and pump,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“So I understood; and before you proceed with your sportive philosophy,\r\nI hope your papa will allow you to try whether you can solve an enigma\r\nI have composed for you.”\r\n\r\n“A riddle!” exclaimed Louisa; “how delightful! Pray read it, papa, and\r\nlet us try to discover its meaning.”\r\n\r\nHer father then opened the paper with which Miss Villers had presented\r\nhim, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n                “Mortal, wouldst thou know my name,\r\n                Scan the pow’rs I proudly claim.\r\n                O’er this globe’s capacious round\r\n                With fairy sprightliness I bound;\r\n                To ev’ry clime, to ev’ry soil,\r\n                With equal hand I give my toil.\r\n                O’er sea and land my power extends,\r\n                To ev’ry herb my care descends.\r\n                Did I withhold my vital breath,\r\n                Nature’s forms would sink in death.\r\n                When confin’d, or swiftly driven\r\n                By angry spirits in the heaven,\r\n                My wrath in thunders I make known,\r\n                And discord claims me as her own.\r\n                ’Tis love of freedom makes me wild,--\r\n                When uncontroll’d, my nature’s mild;\r\n                And oft the nymph, in dewy grot\r\n                Seeks solace from my plaintive note;\r\n                O’er lovers’ graves I waft a sigh,\r\n                And breathe the sound of sympathy.\r\n                And know, ye sons of Albion’s isle,\r\n                That when the Hero of the Nile,\r\n                Midst crowds with mournful pomp array’d,\r\n                In the cold lap of Earth was laid,\r\n                I sympathis’d with Britain’s tear,\r\n                And waved the banner o’er his bier.\r\n                ’Tis I who from the trembling lyre,\r\n                Breathe tones of love and soft desire;\r\n                ’Tis I, the spirit of the shell,\r\n                Who fill with notes the listening dell;\r\n                And, when the war-trump sounds alarms,\r\n                ’Tis I who summon men to arms.\r\n                To man a slave, though free as air,\r\n                I grind his corn, his food prepare;\r\n                Should he to foreign climes proceed,\r\n                He yokes me like the neighing steed,\r\n                And, by my quick but easy motion,\r\n                He traverses the stormy ocean.\r\n                His children, too, my presence court,\r\n                To give them toys, and make them sport:\r\n                Without my aid, their kites would lie\r\n                As useless weights that ne’er could fly;\r\n                Their humming tops would soundless spin,\r\n                Unless I breath’d a spell within.\r\n                The modest maid, without my power,\r\n                Would wither like her kindred flower.\r\n                Unless my cup of sweets she sips,\r\n                Where are the rubies of her lips?\r\n                Unless my glowing rouge she seeks,\r\n                Where are the roses of her cheeks?\r\n                What art again can strew her tresses\r\n                With half the grace my skill possesses?\r\n                Ev’n goddesses are represented\r\n                In draperies which I invented.\r\n                Sometimes, ’tis true, I am so frail\r\n                As ruffian-like to raise your veil,\r\n                And thus to curious man reveal\r\n                The charms you modestly conceal.\r\n                Revenge the deed. Announce my Name,\r\n                For now you know the powers I claim.”\r\n\r\n“It is extremely pretty,” exclaimed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“It is beautiful,” said Tom; “but I should like to find out the riddle\r\nit contains. What can that be which grinds our corn, and carries our\r\nships across the sea? Canvass? Yes; canvass clothes the sails of the\r\nwindmill and forms those of the ship.”\r\n\r\n“And therefore visits every clime; while, as long as the sails remain\r\nfixed, they are quite tractable and steady,” added Louisa.\r\n\r\n“It will not do, Louisa; it cannot be canvass: for the sail is never\r\nboisterous when it is controlled; but when let loose, it shivers in the\r\nwind and is very unruly; whereas it is said in the riddle, ‘When\r\nuncontroll’d my nature’s mild,’ which is quite the reverse. Let me see.\r\nCan it be string? My top could not hum without string.”\r\n\r\n“How can string prevent the modest maid from fading like a flower? What\r\nsays the vicar?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“_Davus sum, non Œdipus_,” exclaimed Mr. Twaddleton.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Miss Villers whispered in the ear of her little\r\nfavourite, who shortly afterwards exclaimed, “I have it, Tom,--it is\r\nAIR.”\r\n\r\nThe juvenile group now attentively perused the enigma, in order to\r\ndiscover whether its different parts would admit of such an\r\ninterpretation. As soon as they arrived at the passage in which was\r\ndescribed the waving of the banners over the bier of Nelson, Tom\r\ndeclared that his sister must be wrong; and was proceeding to offer his\r\nreasons, when Mr. Seymour interrupted him, by observing, it was that\r\npassage which first suggested to his mind the solution of the enigma;\r\nand satisfied him that Louisa was perfectly right.\r\n\r\n“It so happened,” continued he, “that I was present during the awful\r\nceremony of Nelson’s interment in St. Paul’s; and never shall I forget\r\nthe thrilling effect which was produced on the assembled multitude, by\r\nthe solemn movement of the banners in the dome, as the bier slowly\r\nadvanced along the aisle of the cathedral; and which was accidentally\r\noccasioned by a current of air from the western entrance, although, to\r\nthe eye of fancy, it seemed as if some attendant spirit had directed\r\nthe colours, under which the hero had bled and conquered, to offer this\r\nsupernatural testimony of respect and sorrow.”\r\n\r\nMiss Villers observed, that Louisa had unquestionably solved the riddle.\r\n\r\n“And pray, my dear Mr. Twaddleton,” said Mrs. Seymour, “what say you to\r\nthese puzzles and rhyming conundrums? Do you hold them in as much\r\nhorror as you would so many puns?”\r\n\r\n“By no means, my good madam. An enigma is a perfectly orthodox species\r\nof composition; and is, indeed, sanctioned by the highest authorities\r\nof antiquity.”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” observed Mr. Seymour, “that the pastime of riddle-making\r\nwas extremely popular amongst the Grecians. Plutarch, if I remember\r\ncorrectly, has told us that the girls of his time worked at netting or\r\nsewing, and that the most ingenious amongst them ‘made riddles.’”\r\n\r\n“The most ancient riddle on record,” replied the vicar, “is to be found\r\nin the fourteenth chapter of the book of Judges.”\r\n\r\n“_And Samson said unto them, ‘I will now put forth a riddle unto you;\r\nif ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast,\r\nand find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty changes\r\nof garments.’ And they said unto him, ‘Put forth thy riddle that we may\r\nhear it.’ And he said unto them, ‘Out of the eater came forth meat, and\r\nout of the strong came forth sweetness._’”\r\n\r\n“And did they find it out?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“My dear boy,” replied the vicar, “you must read the chapter to which I\r\nhave alluded, and you will thence learn all about this enigma.”\r\n\r\n“We have also numerous riddles in prophane writers of ancient date,”\r\nobserved Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever read of that invented by Cleobulus, one of the seven wise\r\nmen of Greece, who lived 570 years before Christ?” enquired the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Pray be so kind as to relate it,” said Tom.\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton, in compliance with this request, proceeded as follows:--\r\n\r\n“There is a father with twice six sons; these sons have each thirty\r\ndaughters, who are parti-coloured, having one cheek white, the other\r\nblack. They never see each other’s faces, nor live above twenty-four\r\nhours.”\r\n\r\n“A very strange and unsociable family!” observed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“I should never guess it,” said Tom, “if I were to dedicate a year to\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“You have, nevertheless, my boy, just pronounced the name of the said\r\nfather, and that, too, after a single moment’s consideration,” replied\r\nthe vicar.\r\n\r\n“The name of the father!--how?--where?”\r\n\r\n“It is a YEAR!”\r\n\r\n“A year!” exclaimed the astonished boy.\r\n\r\n“A year!” echoed Louisa; “to be sure it is; I now see it all clearly.\r\nHis ‘twice six sons’ are the twelve months; the ‘thirty daughters’ the\r\ndays of each month; and, since one day must necessarily pass away\r\nbefore the next can arrive, they may be truly said never to see each\r\nother’s faces.”\r\n\r\n“Admirably expounded!” cried the vicar.\r\n\r\n“And each day,” added Tom, “is certainly ‘parti-coloured,’ as it is\r\nmade up of light and darkness.”\r\n\r\n“Good, again! The quick apprehension of these my little playmates,”\r\nsaid Mr. Twaddleton, as he turned towards Miss Villers, “is highly\r\ninteresting; their minds, from well-regulated discipline, have acquired\r\nthe faculty, if I may be allowed the use of the metaphor, of\r\n_winnowing_ a subject, so as completely to separate the grain from the\r\nchaff.”\r\n\r\n“It is my intention to proceed this morning with the consideration of\r\nthose toys which have the property of producing sound,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you mean the whistle, whiz-gig, and humming-top,” observed\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n“Your papa, no doubt, alludes to those instruments,” said the vicar,\r\n“and I greatly approve of the arrangement; since our last lecture\r\nembraced the operations of the atmosphere, a subject with which the\r\nnature of sound is certainly intimately connected.”\r\n\r\n“We have lately considered the phenomenon of wind, as produced by the\r\nmotions of the atmosphere, and I now propose to investigate another\r\nspecies of agitation of which the air is susceptible, a kind of\r\nvibratory or tremulous motion, which, striking on the drum of the ear,\r\nproduces SOUND.”\r\n\r\n“Is it the air which produces sound!” said Louisa, with much surprise;\r\n“I thought it was always occasioned by the vibrations of solid bodies.\r\nWell do I remember, when Tom struck the finger-glass, that you\r\nimmediately silenced the sound by placing your hand upon it, and which\r\nyou told us stopped the vibration of the glass, and so destroyed the\r\nsound.”\r\n\r\n“You speak the truth, but not the whole truth,” replied her father.\r\n“Sound is undoubtedly the result of certain motions, or vibrations,\r\nproduced in sonorous bodies, but these vibrations are communicated to\r\nthe air, and from thence to the ear, in a manner which I shall\r\npresently explain.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say, papa, that, if air were entirely excluded, bodies\r\nwould be incapable of producing sound when struck?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly. Air is the usual conductor of sound, and unless some\r\nother medium be substituted, the removal of it would prevent a sonorous\r\nbody from communicating any sensation to the ear. Liquids, however, are\r\ncapable of conveying the vibratory motion to the organ of hearing; for\r\nsound can be heard under water. Solid bodies will also convey it, and\r\nin a much more perfect and rapid manner(44); thus the slightest scratch\r\nwith a pin, upon one end of a long piece of timber, will be distinctly\r\nheard on applying the ear to its opposite extremity. The tramping of a\r\nhorse is to be perceived at a greater distance by listening with the\r\near in contact with the ground, than by attending to the sound conveyed\r\nthrough the air; and hence, amongst many eastern tribes, it is a common\r\npractice to ascertain the approach of an enemy, by applying the ear to\r\nthe ground. Upon the same principle, if we place our ear against a long\r\nbrick wall, and desire a person at a considerable distance to strike it\r\n_once_ with a hammer, it will be heard _twice_, the first sound\r\ntravelling along the wall, the second through the air.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you for that hint,” said the vicar. “I now understand the\r\nprinciple of a new instrument which Dr. Doseall employs for examining\r\nthe pulsations of the heart. He places the end of a wooden rod upon the\r\nbreast, and applying the other extremity to his ear, declares that the\r\nsounds, thus conveyed to it, enable him to form the most accurate\r\nopinion in cases of diseased chest.”\r\n\r\n“In the same manner,” observed Mrs. Seymour, “that you may hear the\r\nboiling of the tea-kettle, by placing the end of the poker on the\r\nvessel, and applying your ear to the handle.”\r\n\r\n“I do not exactly understand what you mean by a _sonorous_ body. Will\r\nnot every body produce a sound when struck?” asked Fanny.\r\n\r\n“Those bodies are called _sonorous_, which produce clear, distinct,\r\nregular, and durable sounds, such as a bell, a drum, musical strings,\r\nwind instruments, and so on.”\r\n\r\n“And upon what does this peculiar property depend?” enquired Tom.\r\n\r\n“Before I answer that question, I must explain the supposed nature of\r\nthose vibrations of the air, upon which sound depends; you will then\r\nreadily perceive why one species of matter should be better calculated\r\nthan another for exciting them. It is generally believed that sound is\r\nconveyed through air by a succession of pulsations similar to those\r\nwhich are occasioned on the surface of smooth water by throwing a\r\npebble into it. This at first produces a small circular wave round the\r\nspot in which the stone falls; the wave spreads, and gradually\r\ncommunicates its motion to the adjacent waters, producing similar waves\r\nto a considerable extent. The same kind of waves are produced in the\r\nair by the motion of a sonorous body, which will of course be in the\r\ncentre, and the waves or pulsations will diminish in strength as they\r\nrecede from that centre, until at last they become too weak to produce\r\nany effect on the ear.”\r\n\r\n“When I strike a bell, then do I produce exactly the same motion in the\r\nair, that I do in the water by throwing a stone into it?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“With this difference,” replied her father, “that as air is an elastic\r\nfluid, the motion does not consist of regularly extending waves, but of\r\nvibrations, which are composed of a motion forwards and backwards; the\r\nundulations of the air differ also from those of the water, in not\r\nbeing confined to a plane, but in diverging in all directions from the\r\ncentre; or, in other words, the aërial undulations are spherical.”\r\n\r\n“It is a very puzzling subject,” cried Tom.\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand,” said Louisa, “how the motion of the air can\r\nextend so as to convey sound to a distance, if, as papa says, the air\r\nmoves backwards as well as forwards.”\r\n\r\n“I see your difficulty, and will endeavour to remove it; attend to me.\r\nThe first set of undulations which are produced immediately around the\r\nsonorous body, by pressing against the contiguous air, condense it. The\r\ncondensed air, though impelled forward by the pressure, re-acts on the\r\nfirst set of undulations, driving them back again. The second set which\r\nhave been put in action, in their turn, communicate their motion, and\r\nare themselves driven back by reaction. Thus there is a succession of\r\nwaves in the air, corresponding with the succession of waves in the\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\n“Now I understand why sound requires some time to travel from a distant\r\nobject to the ear, as you explained to us upon a former occasion,”[53]\r\nsaid Louisa.\r\n\r\n“But you have not yet told us what renders a body sonorous,” observed\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n“Its elasticity: a ball of damp clay, which does not possess this\r\nproperty, will produce no other sound, when struck, but that which\r\narises from the condensation of the small portion of air between the\r\nclay and the hammer which strikes it. A hollow ball of brass will\r\nproduce more sound, because it is elastic; but still very little effect\r\nwill arise from this, since a ball is the worst shape for admitting of\r\nvibration, on account of its forming an arch or dome, in every\r\ndirection, so that one part stiffens and sustains the other; but if\r\nsuch a ball be divided, and the edge of one half of it struck, a loud,\r\nclear, and distinct tone will be produced; because a hemisphere will\r\nadmit of the exertion of elasticity, or of momentary change of figure,\r\nwhich is conducive to the perfection of sound; and accordingly the\r\nbells used for clocks, and for musical purposes, have generally such a\r\nfigure.”\r\n\r\n“I see clearly,” said Louisa, “that it is the vibration of a sonorous\r\nbody that communicates the necessary motions to the air; and I suppose\r\nthat a body vibrates in proportion to its elasticity.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly it does: but to render this subject still more intelligible,\r\nI have prepared a diagram.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then exhibited a figure, of which the annexed is a copy,\r\nand proceeded to explain it in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of a string vibrating.]\r\n\r\n“You are well aware that an elastic body, after having been struck, not\r\nonly returns to its former situation, but having acquired momentum by\r\nits velocity, like the pendulum or swing,[54] springs out on the\r\nopposite side. If, then, I draw the string A B, which is made fast at\r\nboth ends, to C, it will not only return to its original position, but\r\nproceed onwards to D. This is the first vibration, at the end of which\r\nit will retain sufficient velocity to bring it to E, and back again to\r\nF, which constitutes its second vibration; the third vibration will\r\ncarry it only to G and H, and so on, till the resistance of the air\r\ndestroys its motion.”\r\n\r\n“That is exactly like the swing or pendulum,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“As you are struck with the resemblance, take care and preserve the\r\nremembrance of it; for I shall, hereafter, have occasion to revert to\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“As I now understand how sound is produced and carried to a distance, I\r\nshould much like to learn the cause of different tones,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Fond as you are of music, my dear Louisa, I am not surprised at the\r\nwish you have just expressed to become acquainted with the nature of\r\nmusical sounds; I shall, therefore, endeavour to convey, in as simple a\r\nmanner as possible, the theory which has been proposed for their\r\nexplanation. I think you will immediately perceive that, if the aërial\r\nwaves which I have endeavoured to describe, should be irregular, or run\r\ninto each other, there must arise a confusion of sounds; thus\r\n_discords_ may be readily imagined to be produced whenever a second\r\nvibration shall commence before the first is finished, so as to meet it\r\nhalf-way on its return, and interrupt it in its course. In like manner\r\nmay we conceive the general nature of those arrangements upon which\r\n_unison_ and _concord_ depend: where the vibrations are performed in\r\nequal times, the same tone is produced by both, and they are said to be\r\n_in unison_; but _concord_, as you well know, is not confined to\r\nunison, for two different tones harmonize in a variety of cases. If,\r\nfor example the particles of one sonorous body vibrate in double the\r\ntime of another, the second vibration of the latter will strike the ear\r\nat the same instant as the first vibration of the former; and this is\r\nthe ‘concord of an _octave_.’ When the vibrations are as 2 to 3, the\r\ncoincidence will be at every third vibration of the quickest, which,\r\ntherefore, is the next degree of perfection, and is called a\r\n‘_diapente_,’ or ‘fifth;’ while the vibration of 3 to 4 will produce\r\nthe ‘_diatessaron_,’ or ‘fourth;’ but this, and the next which follow\r\nin order, are not so agreeable to the judicious ear, and are therefore\r\ncalled ‘_imperfect concords_.’”\r\n\r\nLouisa here enquired whether the difference in the acuteness of a sound\r\ndid not depend upon the nature of the vibrations; and her father, in\r\nreply, stated that it depended entirely upon the degree of quickness\r\nwith which the vibrations were performed: the slower the vibration, the\r\ngraver the tone; the quicker, the more acute.[55]\r\n\r\n“But, if I strike any one note of the instrument repeatedly, whether\r\nquickly or slowly, it always gives the same tone,” observed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“To understand that fact,” replied her father, “you must remember that\r\nthe vibrations of bodies are regulated by laws very similar to those of\r\nthe pendulum; consequently the duration of the vibrations of strings or\r\nchords depends upon their length, and thickness; for if two strings of\r\nequal magnitude, but with their lengths as 2 to 1, be equally\r\nstretched, their vibrations will be in the same ratio; therefore the\r\nshortest will make two vibrations, while the longest makes one: but the\r\nvibrations of the same string will always be the same whether it be\r\nstruck quickly or slowly, upon the principle of the _isochronous_\r\nproperty of the pendulum, already described.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, Mr. Seymour,” cried Mr. Twaddleton, “you are getting out\r\nof your depth; pray let us take leave of this subject, for I am quite\r\nsure that my young friends have already received more than they can\r\ncarry away.”\r\n\r\n“I submit, my good sir; and in return for my compliance,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour, “use your influence over Miss Villers, and induce her to\r\nfavour us with a practical illustration of our subject upon the\r\npiano-forte.”\r\n\r\n“Most cheerfully; but my intercession is quite unnecessary, for I am\r\nsure that our fair friend is no disciple of Tigellius.”[56]\r\n\r\n“I am ever ready, sir, to comply with the wishes of those I respect. I\r\nconsider the caprice which our sex too often displays upon these\r\noccasions, as not only a breach of good manners, but an evidence of\r\nunpardonable vanity.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, Miss Villers, may I be allowed to ask whether you have ever\r\ndirected your enquiries into the nature of ancient music? it must have\r\nbeen very superior to that of modern ages,” said Mr. Twaddleton.\r\n\r\n“Upon a question of such doubt and difficulty, I feel that it would ill\r\nbecome a person of my very limited knowledge to offer an opinion;\r\nalthough I am willing to confess that the subject has often engaged my\r\nattention; and you could not afford me a greater gratification than by\r\nclearing up some of those doubts which have perplexed me. It is, I\r\nbelieve, admitted, that we are unable to ascertain the real nature of\r\nancient music: but it is evident that it was an art with which mankind\r\nwas extremely delighted; for not only the poets, but the historians and\r\nphilosophers, of the best ages of Greece and Rome, are as diffuse in\r\nits praises, as of those arts concerning which sufficient remains have\r\ndescended to evince the truth of their panegyrics.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, as you very justly observe, is now left us, but conjecture,”\r\nsaid the vicar; “and yet it is impossible to read the accounts of the\r\nextraordinary effects produced by the different ‘modes’ of ancient\r\nmusic, without entertaining a strong conviction of its great\r\nsuperiority over that of modern times. What have we, my dear Miss\r\nVillers, to compare with the soft ‘_Lydian_,’ the grave ‘_Dorian_,’ or\r\nthe furious ‘_Phrygian_;’ to say nothing of the subaltern modes of\r\nAristides Quintilianus and others; such, for example, as the\r\n‘_erotic_,’ ‘_comic_,’ and ‘_encomiastic_?’ What modern strains can\r\nproduce the effects which are recorded to have followed the performance\r\nof Timotheus, the director of the music of Alexander the Great? One\r\nday, while the prince was at table, the musician performed an air in\r\nthe Phrygian mode, which made such an impression on him, that, being\r\nalready heated with wine, he flew to his arms, and was going to attack\r\nhis guests, had not Timotheus immediately changed the style of his\r\nperformance to the sub-Phrygian, or Lydian. This mode calmed the\r\nimpetuous fury of the monarch, and induced him to resume his place at\r\ntable. Music,” continued the vicar, “has, in modern times, so fallen\r\nfrom this degree of majesty and power, as to induce some persons to\r\ndoubt the truth of the historical statements.”\r\n\r\n“I confess, Mr. Twaddleton,” said Miss Villers, “that I have always\r\nbeen inclined to regard ancient music as the mere vehicle of poetry;\r\nand to attribute to the power of the latter that influence which you\r\nappear to refer exclusively to the former.”\r\n\r\n“I am willing to admit,” replied the vicar, “that in the ancient\r\ntheatre, music always accompanied her sister science, assisting,\r\nanimating, and supporting her; in short, that she was, in all respects,\r\nher friend and fellow labourer. ‘_Qualem decet esse sororem_,’ as the\r\npoet has it: but does not this rather prove that poetry, in itself, was\r\ninsufficient to produce its effects without the aid of music? In\r\nfarther proof of the power of ancient music, permit me to remind you\r\nthat Plato has said, ‘No change can be made in music without affecting\r\nthe constitution of the state;’ and Aristotle, who seems to have\r\nwritten his Politics only to oppose the sentiments of Plato,\r\nnevertheless agrees with him, concerning the power which music has over\r\nmortals; and has not the judicious Polybius told us that music was\r\nnecessary to soften the manners of the Arcadians? In short, madam,\r\nmusic has lost its power over the passions of mankind, and this can\r\nonly have happened in consequence of its having degenerated from its\r\nancient purity and grandeur. If any one should have the hardihood to\r\ndeny this my position, let him attend a modern rout in London. I have\r\nseen, my dear Miss Villers, a party at a whist-table, a dozen persons\r\nin _tête-à-têtes_, and as many solitary individuals, sitting like\r\nautomatons, not one of them being moved by the concord of sweet sounds,\r\nwith which some lady has been endeavouring to delight them. Had\r\nTimotheus appeared amongst them! hey, Miss Villers? I think I see the\r\nparty at the whist-table, as his lyre successively changed from the\r\nLydian to the Phrygian mode. I must, however, in justice state, that I\r\nonce did see a lady lay down her cards in an apparent state of ecstasy,\r\nas a chorus of Handel suddenly burst upon her ear.”\r\n\r\n“And what might that chorus have been?” said Mr. Seymour, “‘_Blest be\r\nthe hand?_’ But, joking apart, you appear to have satisfied your mind\r\nupon a point which all the learning of Europe has left in a state of\r\ndoubt and perplexity.”\r\n\r\n“I have merely delivered an opinion, sir; you perhaps will favour us\r\nwith your judgment.”\r\n\r\n“The subject under discussion, my good sir, is one upon which no person\r\ncan ever deliver a judgment.”\r\n\r\n“And pray, Mr. Seymour, why not?”\r\n\r\n“For this plain reason, that it is not possible we can _hear_ both\r\nsides.”\r\n\r\n“Psha! will you never cease to sully the pure stream of enquiry with\r\nthe dregs of ridicule?”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, to be serious; I agree with Miss Villers, that ancient\r\nmusic, whatever might have been its powers, was wholly indebted to the\r\npoetry which accompanied it for its influence over the feelings of\r\nmankind. It could not have been otherwise. The ancient instruments, as\r\nrepresented in sculpture, appear so simple as to be apparently\r\nincapable of producing great effects; and, indeed, amongst the writings\r\nof Aristoxenus, the oldest musical author, we cannot discover a trace\r\nof melody or harmony, such as we understand by _air_ accompanied with\r\ndifferent parts.”\r\n\r\n“To that very simplicity am I disposed to refer the charm of ancient\r\nmusic,” said the vicar; “it was addressed to the _ear_, sir, whereas\r\nmodern music is addressed to the _eye_; dexterity of execution is,\r\nnow-a-days, more valued than beauty of composition; the sweetest\r\nshepherd that ever piped on his Doric reed, would be less applauded\r\nthan he who can make his pipe squeak for the space of five minutes\r\nwithout respiration. The ancients knew better than to suffer the energy\r\nand accentuation of their rhythm to be so destroyed; and only mark,\r\nsir, the extreme jealousy with which they regarded every attempt to\r\ninjure this simplicity; it even became a subject of legislation; and\r\nyou no doubt remember the decree issued against Timotheus; which, as\r\nwell as I recollect, ran thus, ‘Whereas Timotheus the Milesian, coming\r\nto our city, has dishonoured our ancient music, and despising the lyre\r\nof seven strings, has, by the introduction of a greater variety of\r\nnotes, corrupted the ears of our youth; and, by the number of his\r\nstrings and the novelty of his melody, has given to our music an\r\neffeminate and artificial dress, instead of the plain and orderly one\r\nin which it has hitherto appeared; rendering melody infamous, by\r\ncomposing in the chromatic, instead of the enharmonic. The kings and\r\nthe ephori have, therefore, resolved to pass censure upon Timotheus for\r\nthese things; and farther, to oblige him to cut all the superfluous\r\nstrings of his _eleven_, leaving only the _seven_ tones, and to banish\r\nhim from our city, that men may be warned for the future not to\r\nintroduce into Sparta any unbecoming customs.’”\r\n\r\n“And now, my dear vicar, have you done? Have you said all you think\r\nnecessary, in defence of ancient music? If so, hear me, as the advocate\r\nof modern harmony. In the first place, there is not an anecdote which\r\ncan be adduced in support of your side of the question, that may not be\r\nmet with one parallel, and equally strong, in defence of mine. You cite\r\nthe authority of Plato, to show that the constitution of a state may be\r\naffected by changing its national music. What said the great Lord\r\nChatham?--‘_Give me the making of the national ballads, and I care not\r\nwho makes the laws_;’ and the effects produced on the English people by\r\nDibdin’s songs, fully justified the maxim: but remember Mr. Twaddleton,\r\nit was not the music, but the _poetry_ of those songs, which kindled\r\nthe patriotic feelings which saved our country; and I apprehend that\r\nthis has been the case in all ages, where the power of music has been\r\nsaid to excite the feelings of the populace. We know that the ancient\r\nbards of our own country called forth the emotions of their hearers by\r\nthe poetry of their songs; and with what success they practised their\r\ncalling we may imagine from the fact that Edward the First, in his\r\nconquest of Wales, had recourse to the barbarous expedient of murdering\r\nall the bards, from the many obstacles they threw in his way, by the\r\nstrong hold which they had over the minds of the people. You have told\r\nus a story of Timotheus, and the influence of his harp over a drunken\r\nmonarch. If this is adduced in proof of the power of ancient music, you\r\nmust, at least, admit that modern times have also had a Timotheus, who\r\ncould excite or calm, at his pleasure, the most impetuous emotions.\r\nHenry III. king of France, says ‘_Le Journal de Sancy_,’ having given a\r\nconcert on occasion of the marriage of the Duke de Joyeuse, Claudin le\r\nJeune, a celebrated musician of that period, executed certain airs,\r\nwhich had such an effect on a young nobleman, that he drew his sword,\r\nand challenged every one near him to combat; but Claudin, equally\r\nprudent as Timotheus, instantly changed to an air, _sub-Phrygian_, or\r\n_Lydian_, I suppose, which appeased the furious youth. But what shall\r\nwe say of Stradella, the celebrated composer, whose music made the\r\ndaggers drop from the hands of his assassins? Stradella was attacked by\r\nthree desperadoes, who had been hired to assassinate him; but,\r\nfortunately, they had an ear sensible to harmony. While waiting for a\r\nfavourable opportunity to execute their purpose they entered the church\r\nof St. John de Lateran, during the performance of an oratorio, composed\r\nby the person whom they intended to destroy, and were so affected by\r\nthe music, that they abandoned their design, and even waited on the\r\nmusician to apprise him of his danger. Stradella, however, was not\r\nalways so fortunate; other assassins, who apparently had no ear for\r\nmusic, stabbed him some time afterwards at Genoa.”\r\n\r\n“And thus afforded a practical illustration of a passage of\r\nShakspeare,” exclaimed the vicar,\r\n\r\n             “‘The man that hath no music in himself,\r\n             Nor is not mov’d with concord of sweet sounds,\r\n             Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;\r\n             The motions of his spirit are dull as night,\r\n             And his affections dark as Erebus:\r\n             Let no such man be trusted.’”\r\n\r\n“Are you satisfied?” asked Mr. Seymour; “if not, I will proceed to tell\r\nyou how Palma, a Neapolitan, induced a creditor who came to arrest him,\r\nnot only to remit his debt, but to contribute a sum for his support. I\r\nwill also relate an anecdote of Farinelli the actor, who having a\r\npathetic air to sing on the stage to a tyrant who had taken him\r\nprisoner, the person who performed the part of the tyrant, and was to\r\nhave refused his request, was so affected by the music, that he\r\nactually melted into tears, and clasped the captive in his arms.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, enough!” exclaimed the vicar. “I see plainly that you believe\r\nnot in the power of music.”\r\n\r\n“In that you wrong me. I certainly do not believe that the ancients\r\nwere better skilled than ourselves in music; and I have been anxious to\r\nconvince you that there are as many modern as ancient stories, in proof\r\nof the influence of harmony over our feelings; but no one will deny\r\nthat music is capable of producing extraordinary effects. Let us only\r\ninterrogate ourselves, and examine what have been our sensations on\r\nhearing a majestic or warlike piece of music, or a tender and pathetic\r\nair sung or played with expression. Who does not feel that the latter\r\ntends as much to melt the soul and dispose it to pleasure, as the\r\nformer to animate and exalt it? There is a celebrated air in\r\nSwitzerland, which, I have no doubt, Miss Villers will presently play\r\nto us, called ‘_Rans des Vaches_,’ and which had such an extraordinary\r\neffect on the Swiss troops in the French service, that they always fell\r\ninto a deep melancholy whenever they heard it. Louis XIV, therefore,\r\nforbade it ever to be played in France, under the pain of a severe\r\npenalty. We are also told of a Scotch air, ‘_Lochaber no more_,’ which\r\nhad a similar effect on the natives of Scotland. Never shall I forget\r\nthe effect produced upon myself by the impressive requiem of Jomelli,\r\nas performed at the chapel of the Portuguese embassy to the memory of\r\nthe late king of Portugal. The movement with which it commenced was a\r\ndeep and hollow murmur, that seemed to swell from the tomb, and with\r\nwhich the voices of spirits imperceptibly rose, and intermingled;--a\r\nbrilliant movement interposed,--it was a ray of hope that pierced the\r\ngloom of the sepulchre!”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Miss Villers, “that I can exactly appreciate the nature\r\nand extent of Mr. Seymour’s opinion upon the question at issue. He does\r\nnot deny the charm which the simple music of the ancients must have\r\nexercised over the hearer, although he attributes much of the effect to\r\nthe poetry, of which it may certainly be said to have been the vehicle;\r\nand he evidently concurs with you, Mr. Twaddleton, in thinking that,\r\nowing to the intricate combinations of modern harmony, our astonishment\r\nat the execution of the artist too frequently overcomes the influence\r\nof the musical tones upon our passions. I perceive, however, from the\r\nexpression of our friend’s countenance,” continued the young lady,\r\n“that, like a true antiquary, he clings to his subject, though his\r\nsupport be no stronger than a cobweb; under such circumstances I may be\r\npermitted to declare my sentiments upon the occasion, and I shall avail\r\nmyself of this opportunity to express my humble testimony of gratitude,\r\nfor the information and pleasure which I have just derived from your\r\nconversation. I believe then, gentlemen, that the language of modern\r\nmusic is no less forcible and expressive than that of ancient days; and\r\nif you will only allow me to exemplify this truth by an experiment, I\r\nfeel convinced that the vicar will become my proselyte.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, madam! Well, I will consent to trust the cause in your hands,”\r\nsaid Mr. Twaddleton.\r\n\r\n“Allow me then to ask you, sir, whether you have ever heard of a game,\r\nwhich is justly entitled to the appellation of the MAGIC OF MUSIC?”\r\n\r\n“Never,” replied the vicar; “nor can I imagine either the nature, or\r\nobjects of such a game.”\r\n\r\n“Its object is to display the power of music as an expressive language;\r\nthe manner in which I propose to exemplify it, I will, with your\r\npermission, explain in a few words. The musical performer shall place\r\nherself at the harp, or piano-forte, surrounded by the party who are\r\ndesirous of witnessing the pastime; the person to be operated upon must\r\nretire from the apartment, until the service which, under the direction\r\nof the music, it is determined he shall perform, is duly agreed upon\r\nand arranged. Such person is then to be re-admitted; not a word, look,\r\nor gesture, is to escape from any one present; by the expression of the\r\nmusic alone is he to receive his instructions, and, unless I am much\r\ndeceived, you will find that this is amply sufficient for the purpose.”\r\n\r\n“My dear madam, the thing is utterly impossible,” exclaimed the vicar.\r\n“It cannot be done; unless, indeed, you really possess the secret of\r\nthe ancient ‘_modes_,’ which were not even known to Meibomius, the\r\nlearned commentator upon the Greek musician Alypius; nay, Isaac Vossius\r\nhimself, the expounder of rhythm, were he now alive, would never credit\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Are you willing to make the experiment,” said Miss Villers; “if so, be\r\nso kind as to leave the room for a few minutes.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar accordingly prepared to depart, casting at the same time,\r\nupon his fair companion, a look which sufficiently expressed the\r\nscepticism he felt upon the occasion.\r\n\r\n“But you have not told me,” said he, “by what signal I am to return,\r\nand submit to the proposed ordeal.”\r\n\r\n“The music will inform you, if you pay sufficient attention to its\r\nlanguage,” replied Miss Villers.\r\n\r\nThe door having been carefully closed, the company were consulted, in a\r\nwhisper, as to the service they should require the vicar to perform. “I\r\nshould propose,” said Miss Villers, “that Mr. Twaddleton be directed to\r\ntake a rose out of the basket of flowers on the chimney-piece, and\r\nhaving smelt it, to carry it to the harp.”\r\n\r\n“And do you propose to express all these different movements by the aid\r\nof music? If you succeed, there must be an end to the vicar’s\r\nscepticism,” observed Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“If I fail upon this occasion, it will be the first time,” said Miss\r\nVillers: “but you must all promise to be silent, and to maintain the\r\nmost absolute command over your countenances.”\r\n\r\nMiss Villers seated herself at the piano-forte, and played off an\r\nelegant and sparkling overture, which so delighted Mrs. Seymour that\r\nshe involuntarily exclaimed, “If music can be made to speak an\r\nintelligible language, it must be under the guidance of Miss Villers.”\r\n\r\n“Hush,” cried the performer, in a half whisper: “I am now about to\r\nsummon the vicar into the room, and we must be as silent as\r\nCarthusians.”\r\n\r\nShe accordingly, with exquisite taste and address, introduced the air\r\nof “_Open the door, Lord Gregory_,” into which she infused so much\r\nexpression, that the vicar must have been as dull as Midas had he not\r\ninstantly caught its meaning. Nor were the lady’s hopes disappointed.\r\nMr. Twaddleton entered, and appeared as if anxious to address the\r\nperformer; but an intelligible glance from Mr. Seymour recalled him to\r\nhis duty, and hermetically sealed his lips. His intention had been,\r\ndoubtless, to enquire whether his appearance were seasonable; but the\r\nquestion was anticipated by Miss Villers, who immediately on his\r\nentrance struck up the air of “_See the conquering Hero comes_,” which,\r\nat once, satisfied his doubts, and conveyed, in language not to be\r\nmisunderstood, the sanction of the enchantress, to whose spells he had\r\nso unreservedly intrusted himself.\r\n\r\nThe vicar had been told that he was to perform certain acts on his\r\nre-admission into the room; but, thought he, how am I to discover the\r\nthread which is to guide me through so perplexing a maze? I can\r\ndiscover at this moment nothing but a concord of sweet sounds, that\r\nwould rather dispose me to listen in profound repose, than to enter\r\nupon any service of exertion. Miss Villers saw and guessed the nature\r\nof his embarrassment, and changing the melody, struck into the air of\r\n“_Hearken and I will tell thee how_.” She then, by a succession of\r\nwell-selected chords, which were now played ‘_piano_,’ and now\r\n‘_forte_,’ convinced the vicar that she commanded an instrument fully\r\ncapable of readily and forcibly expressing encouragement and repulse in\r\nall its degrees.\r\n\r\n“Thus much then is certain,” mentally ejaculated the vicar, “that she\r\nis enabled, by the aid of music, to signify her approbation, or\r\ndisapprobation, of any act which I may attempt to perform. I\r\naccordingly predicate of this said music, that it is, _bonâ fide_, a\r\nlogical weapon; inasmuch as it can affirm and deny. It, therefore, only\r\nremains for me, knowing as I do that I have some act to perform, to\r\nascertain the ‘_locus_’ or ‘_ubi_,’ for the act in question, whatever\r\nit may be, must of necessity be done or accomplished ‘_in proprio\r\nloco_,’ or in some definite part of the room.” With this determination,\r\nfounded, as he believed it to be, on the unerring basis of Aristotelian\r\nlogic, he advanced towards the table; but the loud and discordant\r\nsounds of the instrument at once convinced him, that, however correct\r\nhis notions might be with reference to the ‘_substance_’ or first\r\n‘_predicament_,’ they were evidently erroneous as to the ‘_accidents_,’\r\nof ‘time,’ ‘place,’ and ‘relation;’ at least, such were the ideas that\r\nfloated through the categorical organ of his cranium, and he\r\naccordingly faced about, and made a retreat towards the window; but the\r\nnotes now became still more clamorous, and increased in vehemence. Ay,\r\nay, thought he, it is quite evident that I am receding from the theatre\r\nof action; and with this conviction he diverted his steps into a\r\ndifferent direction, and, in a slow pace, tracked the path by his ear,\r\nwith as much sagacity as a dog follows his prey by his nose. As he\r\napproached the fire-place, the storm of sounds gradually subsided,\r\nuntil a peaceful murmur breathed around, which finally died away as the\r\nvicar placed his hand upon the chimney-piece. So then it appears, after\r\nall, that I have some service to perform at the fire-side. It is,\r\ndoubtless, to sit down, thought he, as he espied the elbow-chair,\r\nwhich, at that moment, appeared to his fancy, as if stretching forth\r\nits hospitable arms to receive him; but scarcely had he answered the\r\nimaginary invitation of his old friend, by presenting the nether part\r\nof his person to its luxurious lap of down, than a sudden _sforzato_,\r\nor crash in the minor key, made him rebound upon his legs, as nimbly as\r\nthough the cushion had been a bed of thorns. Miss Villers now resolved\r\nthe discord, and dexterously dashed into an allegro movement, in which\r\nshe introduced the air of “_How sweet are the flowers that grow!_”\r\n\r\nThe vicar’s face mantled with a smile, as the bouquet on the\r\nchimney-piece met his eye, and harmonised with the sounds that floated\r\nin his ear. It is evident, thought he, that those flowers are the\r\nobjects of my pursuit,--but what was he to do with them? The musician\r\nsolved the question, by tastefully exchanging the former air for that\r\nof “_Ask if yon damask rose be sweet_.” No sooner had these notes\r\ndelivered their melodious errand to the subtle ear of the vicar, than\r\nhe instantly seized the rose, and carried it in triumph to his\r\nolfactory organs; at the same moment the music ceased. The pause,\r\nhowever, was but of short duration; for Miss Villers, by resuming her\r\nlabours, intimated that some farther service was expected. Was he to\r\nreturn the rose? Certainly not; for the attempt was marked by strong\r\ndisapprobation. Was he to take it out of the room? The music put a\r\ndecided negative upon that movement; for the vicar had scarcely\r\nmeasured half the distance of the apartment before the air of “_Fly not\r\nyet_” arrested his steps. By a continuation of the same varying style\r\nof expression, and strongly marked rhythm, the vicar was shortly led to\r\naffix the rose upon the harp.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” exclaimed the vicar, “I shall no longer hesitate to\r\ncredit the story related in ‘Peter Simple,’ of a certain lady who\r\nplayed so exquisitely, that upon introducing an imitation of thunder,\r\nthe cream for tea became sour, besides three casks of beer in the\r\ncellar!”\r\n\r\nIn closing our account of this interesting scene, it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to describe the delight and mirth of the juvenile party. It\r\nwas, in truth, a very extraordinary exhibition; and when the reader\r\nconsiders that, beyond what was furnished by the expressive language of\r\nmusic, the vicar did not receive a single hint for his guidance, he\r\nmay, perhaps, cherish some scepticism upon the subject; but we can\r\nassure him that we have repeatedly witnessed, not only a similar but a\r\nstill more complicated performance of the same kind, and with equal\r\nsuccess.(45)\r\n\r\nThe evening of the day on which this musical divertisement was\r\nperformed, was one of those which so frequently occur in August, when\r\nsultry heat is succeeded by refreshing coolness. Isabella Villers\r\npossessed a quick sensibility to the beauties of nature, and she\r\nquitted the drawing-room to enjoy, without interruption, that pensive\r\nquiet which maintained an undisputed dominion. The moon had but just\r\nrisen, tipping the summits of the wood with silver, while it left the\r\nmass of foliage in deeper shadow. Never was there a fairy scene better\r\ncalculated to awaken the emotions of the heart, or to kindle the\r\nenergies of the imagination. The hour too was propitious to the\r\nindulgence of that undefined species of reverie which is the refinement\r\nof intellectual pleasure. Having traversed the winding path of the wood\r\nfor some distance, she found herself in one of those sequestered glades\r\nwe have formerly described. She seated herself on a rustic bench,\r\ntastefully formed out of an aged oak, whose venerable figure was\r\nbending under the hand of Time, and her mind was gratefully lulled into\r\na pensive calm by the review of past events, as the ear is soothed by\r\nthe murmur of wild and distant music. A sudden breath of wind, as it\r\nswept the foliage, aroused her from her reverie, and turned the current\r\nof her ideas from past scenes to future prospects. The moon, as if in\r\nsympathy, suddenly peered through the sylvan avenue, and threw her rays\r\nupon one of those statues which we have already described as giving\r\nsuch an air of classic sanctity to these secluded glades. It was the\r\nfigure of TIME, which in the gloom of the wood had hitherto escaped her\r\nobservation. To a mind of exuberant fancy, a leaf cannot fall to the\r\nground, nor a zephyr waft the fragrance of the violet on its dewy\r\npinions, without conveying some beautiful emblem of morality. Isabella\r\nrose from her seat, and approached the figure, whose hoary countenance\r\nappeared as if lighted up into a placid smile by the beams of the moon,\r\nwhich fell directly upon it; her eye glanced from his face to his\r\nscythe; its blade was hidden in a cluster of roses--Were I susceptible\r\nof a superstitious impression, thought Isabella, did ever a\r\ncircumstance present itself better calculated to justify its\r\nindulgence? On the pedestal of the figure was a basso relievo, in which\r\nTime appeared in the act of shivering into pieces the club of Hercules\r\nwith a crutch. In a few minutes, she quitted the scene, which, in spite\r\nof her better reason, she could not wholly divest of its prophetic\r\ninfluence, and proceeding along the winding path, at length descended\r\ninto the valley. The moon was at this time shrouded in dark clouds, and\r\nalthough, by a painful effort, Isabella Villers summoned all the powers\r\nof her vision, the objects around her remained invisible, until the eye\r\nhad so far accommodated itself to the gloom, as to recognise the white\r\nfoam of the waterfall. The moon now gave a coy and furtive glance, the\r\nwater for an instant sparkled in her beams, and then was lost in deeper\r\nshadow. A spectre of human form, but of gigantic stature, arose from\r\nthe spot to which the eyes of Isabella had been directed--was it the\r\nspirit of the Fountain? It appeared to advance, but the moon once again\r\nshining forth in splendour, it vanished.\r\n\r\n                    “And what seem’d corporal melted\r\n                    As breath into the wind.”\r\n\r\nThe courage of Isabella was destined to sustain another trial, for\r\nscarcely had the vision disappeared than she distinctly heard her own\r\nname pronounced; and since, from the direction of the sound, she well\r\nknew that the spot from which it issued was inaccessible, we ought not\r\nto feel surprised at her having at the instant referred it to a\r\nsupernatural origin--it was, however, but the illusion of the moment,\r\nand she determined to return to the house and submit the events of the\r\nevening to the judgment of Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nWe shall not trespass any longer upon the patience of the reader, than\r\nto state that Miss Villers arrived safely at the lodge, and very\r\nshortly afterwards retired to rest. With your permission, gentle\r\nreader, we will follow her example; for, to say the truth, our\r\nlamp--that midnight sun which illumines the path of the author, is\r\ndimmed by the dark clouds that lower at its setting; our Pegasus, the\r\npen, which has raced for so many hours over the snowy plains of\r\nfoolscap, is fairly “done up,” and refuses any longer to sip of that\r\nspring which can alone sustain its powers, and impart utility to its\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n                                 Ecce!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A feather.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  See p. 35.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  See page 163, et seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  The number of vibrations made by the wings of insects, as before\r\n  stated, has been ingeniously deduced from the tone which they produce.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Horat.

This arrangement,” she added, “will\r\nafford me an opportunity of communicating to you the history of some\r\nadventures I encountered last evening, and of taking your opinion upon\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“You well know,” answered Mr. Seymour, “that you may always command my\r\nservices--but you have really raised my curiosity: what can be the\r\nnature of the adventures you speak of?”\r\n\r\nMiss Villers then entered into a particular account of all she saw and\r\nheard the preceding evening; with which the reader is already\r\nacquainted. Mr. Seymour, however, suggested the propriety of abstaining\r\nfrom any discussion upon the subject until the children were present to\r\nhear it; for, said he, “I am most desirous that they should be\r\nfamiliarized with those natural sources of illusion which enlighten the\r\nwise, while they minister to the superstitious fears of the ignorant.”\r\n\r\nThey had not reached the entrance of Forest Lane, before they perceived\r\nthe vicar with Tom and Louisa, followed by the Major.\r\n\r\n“Papa,” cried Tom, as he ran to meet his father, “we have had a most\r\ndelightful morning; amongst other things, do you know we have found out\r\nthe meaning of the crescent which the Turks always wear, and use as\r\ntheir ensign.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! well, then, let me hear your explanation,” said his father.\r\n\r\nMajor Snapwell and the vicar had by this time joined the party, and\r\nwith their assistance Tom was enabled to offer the following account of\r\nit.--The crescent appears on the early coins of Byzantium, and was\r\nintended to commemorate the defeat of Philip of Macedon, who, as he was\r\nabout to storm it on a cloudy night, was discovered by the sudden light\r\nof the moon. When the Turks entered Constantinople, they found this\r\nancient badge in various parts of the city, and suspecting that it\r\nmight possess some magical power, they assumed the symbol and its power\r\nto themselves; so that the crescent became, and still continues to be,\r\nthe chief Turkish ensign.\r\n\r\n“Well, I must own that you have given me a new and very curious piece\r\nof historical information, and I thank you for it,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Medals, then, are occasionally of some little use,” remarked the\r\nvicar, with a sarcastic smile; for if the truth must be told, the\r\nreverend antiquary had been a little nettled as usual by the freedom\r\nwith which Major Snapwell had criticised some of his rarities; but let\r\nthat pass.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the party reassembled after the excursion of the morning,\r\nthe circumstances which so greatly astonished Miss Villers on the\r\npreceding evening, were again related by her.\r\n\r\n“My dear young lady,” observed Mr. Seymour, “I never heard a better\r\nstory for illustrating the illusions to which the senses are exposed;\r\nand if you will read the second letter on ‘Natural Magic,’ by Sir David\r\nBrewster, you will obtain a ready explanation of your vision--but let\r\nus examine it philosophically. In the first place you acknowledge that\r\nyour imagination had been previously excited during your ramble through\r\nthe wood, and more especially by your reverie at the statue of Time;\r\nnow it is well known that such a condition of the mind prepares and\r\nadapts the organs of vision for those illusions which I am about to\r\nexplain. You have told us that, on your descent into the valley, the\r\nmoon had withdrawn its light, and several minutes had elapsed before an\r\nobject became visible, and that was the _white_ foam of the waterfall.”\r\n\r\n“If I rightly remember, Brewster has stated that the spectres that are\r\nconjured up by the imagination are always _white_, because no other\r\ncolour can be seen at night,” observed Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied her husband; “and as these spectres are formed\r\nout of objects whose different parts reflect different degrees of\r\nlight, their fainter parts will appear and disappear with the ever\r\nvarying degree of illumination which is occasioned by the moon shining\r\nthrough a veil of clouds, and a change even of shape will be thus\r\nproduced which will impart to the object in question the semblance of a\r\nliving form. The actual state of the eye itself will also greatly\r\nassist in completing such an illusion; for, in consequence of the small\r\ndegree of light, the pupil expands to nearly the whole width of the\r\niris, in order to collect every ray, and in such a condition it cannot\r\naccommodate itself to see near objects distinctly, so that the form of\r\na body actually becomes more shadowy and confused when it comes within\r\nthe very distance at which we count upon obtaining the best view of it.”\r\n\r\n“You have certainly explained the reason why bodies seen under a faint\r\nillumination may appear distorted and caricatured; indeed, I now\r\nremember that Sir Walter Scott, in his “Pirate,” has given us a very\r\ngood illustration; for Cleveland when abandoned on Coffin bay is said\r\nto have seen many a dim and undefined spectre in the misty dawn. But I\r\nam still at a loss to understand how the vision I witnessed in the\r\nvalley could have been conjured up,” said Miss Villers.\r\n\r\n“It was the doubtful and flickering light of the clouded moon upon the\r\nmass of white sandstone,” said Mr. Seymour. “It is a great law of the\r\nimagination, that a likeness in part tends to become a likeness of the\r\nwhole. The sandstone presented, in the first instance, a form somewhat\r\nresembling the human figure, or some part of it, when your active\r\nimagination immediately completed the outline; just in the same way as\r\nwe trace images in the fire, or castles in the clouds, or grotesque\r\nfigures of men and animals on damp walls.”(46)\r\n\r\n“I am satisfied,” said Miss Villers, “and I thank you, and Sir David\r\nBrewster, for the lecture; and now,” continued the lady, “how will you\r\nexplain the circumstance of my name having been so audibly pronounced,\r\nand from a spot which made it impossible that it should have come from\r\nany human being?”\r\n\r\n“It was the solitary spirit of the dell,” said Mr. Seymour, with a\r\nsmile; “a rural spirit who is disposed to become very loquacious\r\nwhenever the repose of her habitation is disturbed. I can assure you,”\r\nadded he, “that you are not the first person whom her gambols have\r\nsurprised and terrified in the shades of evening. I presume you have\r\ndiscovered that I allude to that unseen musician of the air--ECHO.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Mr. Seymour, the sound could not have been the effect of an\r\necho, for I never spoke,” replied Miss Villers.\r\n\r\n“Very likely, but I happen to know that Mrs. Seymour called you by name\r\nat the orchard gate.”\r\n\r\n“Nor will that explain it,” observed Miss Villers, “for in that case I\r\nmust certainly have heard her, whereas the sound came in a very\r\ndifferent direction, from the inaccessible rocks of sandstone.”\r\n\r\n“Young lady,” said Mr. Seymour, “you must forgive me for telling you\r\nthat your philosophy is at fault. It is as possible to hear an echo,\r\nwithout recognising the direct sound which produced it, as it is for\r\ntwo persons to be so placed as to see each other in a looking-glass,\r\nalthough objects might obstruct the direct view of themselves. Did you\r\nnever walk between an irregular wall and a row of houses, or along a\r\nvalley intercepted by houses during the ringing of a peal of bells?\r\nNothing is more common under such circumstances, for the sound instead\r\nof arriving at the ear, in its true direction, to be reflected in one\r\nthat is opposite to it;--now before we quit the subject of optical\r\nillusion, let me relate an incident which occurred to myself. I presume\r\nyou are all acquainted with the appearance in the grass, called a\r\n_Fairy-ring_?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” said Tom, “a very dark circle of grass, around which\r\nthere is generally a ring that looks as if the ground had been burnt.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,--and we are now satisfied that this appearance is the\r\nconsequence of the growth and decay of certain fungi(47), although the\r\ncommon people still believe that the ring is produced by the gambols of\r\nfairies--now then for my story. It was on a moonlight night, last\r\nAugust, when strolling along a neighbouring meadow, enjoying the\r\nbeauties of the evening, that I met a young farmer, an intelligent\r\nperson, although a little inclined to a belief in the marvellous, who,\r\non approaching with a hasty step, thus accosted me;--‘You have often\r\nridiculed my belief in fairies, and of their being the cause of those\r\nrings which go by their name; you may now, if you please, satisfy\r\nyourself of their reality, if you will only return with me to the elm\r\nclose, which, as you know, abounds with fairy-rings. Within the last\r\nfew minutes I have actually seen them at their gambols under the great\r\nelm; they are, sir, tiny beings which, as far as I could judge at a\r\ndistance, cannot be more than a few inches in height; but there they\r\nare, frisking away most merrily: pray, sir, do let us return, and\r\nsatisfy yourself as well as me.’--You may readily suppose that I lost\r\nno time in complying with my friend’s request; and sure enough there\r\nthey were.”\r\n\r\n“What, the fairies!” exclaimed Louisa, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Have patience, my dear, and you shall hear. I confess,” continued Mr.\r\nSeymour, “that at the first glance, I was almost startled into a belief\r\nin the reality of my friend’s assertion, but on approaching, the Fairy\r\nQueen and her court were changed into a circle of fungi, to which the\r\nshadowy play of the leaves of the neighbouring tree had, in the light\r\nof the moon, given the appearance of a fantastic motion. The illusion,\r\nI will admit, was very extraordinary, and one well calculated to impose\r\nupon the credulous countrymen.”\r\n\r\nThe young party were much amused by the anecdote, and the vicar took\r\nthis opportunity to explain, on natural principles, several\r\nsuperstitious appearances recorded in ancient legends.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour now proposed to dedicate an hour to the explanation of the\r\nseveral toys which owe their action to atmospheric vibration; “I shall\r\nthen,” said he, addressing Miss Villers, “be at your service to\r\ninterrogate the spirit of the valley; and the children, whom I intend\r\nto accompany us, will be thus better prepared to comprehend the theory\r\nof the echo.”\r\n\r\n“Musical instruments, amongst which I include the toys to which I have\r\nalluded, may be classed under three heads:--_stringed_ instruments,\r\nsuch as the harp, violin, &c.; _wind_ instruments, as the flute and\r\ntrumpet; and instruments of _percussion_, as the tabor and drum.”\r\n\r\n“And which kind do you consider the most ancient?” asked Miss Villers.\r\n\r\n“_Wind_ instruments, madam, most unquestionably,” cried Mr. Twaddleton.\r\n“Diodorus ascribed their invention to the accidental notice of the\r\nwhistling of the wind in the reeds, on the banks of the Nile; and the\r\npoet Lucretius maintained a similar opinion.”\r\n\r\n“I really, my dear Sir, cannot see any good reason for giving this\r\npreference, in point of antiquity, to wind instruments,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour. “The lyre, or harp, is, surely, as ancient as any instrument\r\non record. The mythologist ascribes the idea of producing sound by the\r\nvibration of a string, to Apollo; which is said by Censorinus to have\r\nsuggested itself to him, on his hearing the twang of the bow of his\r\nsister Diana. With respect to instruments of percussion, it may be\r\nreasonably supposed that the sonorous ringing of hollow bodies, when\r\nstruck, must have very soon suggested their invention to mankind; but I\r\nreally consider any research into a question of such obscurity as\r\nuninteresting as it must be hopeless; let us rather devote our\r\nattention to the philosophy of these instruments. I have stated that\r\nthey may be referred to three principal classes; but I must at the same\r\ntime observe that, in some cases, the vibrations of solid bodies are\r\nmade to co-operate with those of a given portion of air; for example,\r\ntrumpets and various horns may be said to be mixed wind instruments,\r\nsince their sound is produced by the joint vibrations of the air and a\r\nsolid body; and in certain stringed instruments, as in the violin, the\r\nimmediate effect of the strings is increased by means of a\r\nsounding-board, which appears to be agitated by their motion, and to\r\nact more powerfully on the air than the strings could have done alone.”\r\n\r\n“I apprehend that this mixture must obtain more or less in all\r\ninstruments,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Not at all. The flute, flageolet, humming-top, and the cavity of the\r\nmouth in whistling, may be considered as simple wind instruments, in\r\nwhich the quality of the sound is alone determined by the vibrations of\r\nthe air. I have already explained the manner in which the oscillations\r\nof a string excite aërial undulations, and thus produce sound; and you\r\nhave seen that the nature of these sounds is determined by the length\r\nand thickness of such strings: the theory equally applies to wind\r\ninstruments, in which case, a column of air corresponds with the\r\nstring, the volume and length of which determines the sound. In the\r\nharp, the strings are constructed of different lengths and dimensions;\r\nand so, in the _Syrinx_, or _Pan’s pipes_, is the volume of air\r\nadjusted to the respective notes by the size and length of the reeds;\r\nbut, in the violin, the lengths of the strings are altered at pleasure\r\nby pressing them down on the finger-board; and, in like manner, the\r\neffective length of the flute is changed by the opening or shutting the\r\nholes made at proper distances in them; the opening of a hole at any\r\npart being the same in effect as if the pipe were cut off a little\r\nbeyond it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour and the vicar then entered into a long discussion, with\r\nwhich it is not our intention to swell our history, or to exhaust the\r\npatience of the reader; we shall, however, with his permission, collect\r\nfrom the mass some of the more interesting facts, and present them in\r\nas condensed a form as may be consistent with perspicuity. In speaking\r\nof the _Jew’s harp_, a little instrument with which every school-boy is\r\nwell acquainted, the vicar stated that its origin was lost in the long\r\nlapse of time; but that it was in very common use throughout Europe,\r\nand more especially in the Netherlands and the Tyrol, where it was the\r\ndelight of the peasants and their families. He also said that it was\r\nknown in Asia, and that the Greeks of Smyrna called it, in imitation of\r\nits sound, _biambo_. The name by which it is now known, he observed,\r\nwas evidently derived from the Jews, who were formerly the great\r\nvenders of it, and of other toys throughout Europe, although he stated\r\nthat his friend Mr. Prybabel was of opinion that it was a corruption of\r\n_jaw’s_ harp. Mr. Seymour described its construction, and the theory of\r\nits action. [Illustration: Jew’s harp.] It is composed of two parts,\r\nthe _body_ and the _tongue_: the former has some resemblance to the\r\nhandle of a certain kind of corkscrew; the latter consists of a little\r\nstrip of steel, joined to the upper part of the body, and bent at its\r\nextremity, so that the fingers may touch it more readily. This tongue,\r\nor elastic plate, produces, in itself, only a sound which serves as a\r\ndrone, although it appears to act like the motion of the bow of a\r\nviolin in exciting other sounds, by breaking the current of air from\r\nthe mouth, the acuteness or gravity of which will be determined by the\r\npressure of the lips, and the magnitude of the cavity of the mouth. To\r\nunderstand, however, this part of its operation, it is necessary that\r\nthe reader should become acquainted with the nature and effects of what\r\nhave been termed _Resonances, and Reciprocated Vibrations of Columns of\r\nAir_. This property of sounding bodies, which to the ignorant must\r\nappear as an inexplicable species of sympathy, will be more fully\r\nexplained in a note(48); at present we shall merely give one or two\r\nexamples of its effects. A singer has been known to break into pieces a\r\nlarge tumbler glass by the power of his voice; and a violin suspended\r\nagainst a wall may be heard to yield the same notes as those produced\r\nby a performer on a similar instrument in the same room. To produce\r\nsuch an effect, however, one condition is indispensable, that the body\r\nto be put in vibration must be in unison, or agreeing in pitch, with\r\nthe one communicating the sound. Hence the necessity of so adapting the\r\ncapacity of the mouth in playing the Jew’s harp, as to make the column\r\nof air which it contains to reciprocate the sound of its tongue. The\r\nsubject was agreeably concluded by some anecdotes which were related by\r\nMiss Villers, in proof of the astonishing powers of this little\r\ninstrument when directed by the skill of a master. For the sake of\r\nthose who may be curious upon this subject we have introduced an\r\naccount of two great performers, in an additional note(49). In speaking\r\nof the flute, Mr. Twaddleton took occasion to observe, that its name\r\nwas derived from _fluta_,[57] a lamprey, or small Sicilian eel, which\r\nhas seven holes on each side; an etymology which will probably be as\r\nnew to our readers as it was to ourselves. The children also received\r\ntheir share of instruction and amusement upon this occasion. Tom, for\r\nthe first time, became acquainted with the use of the pea in the\r\nwhistle, which, he was told, was to agitate and break the current of\r\nair, and thus to produce a succession of quick vibrations upon which\r\nthe acuteness of its sound depended. Louisa exhibited her _whiz-gig_,\r\nwhich, for the information of the unlearned reader, we may state to\r\nconsist of a hollow disc of wood, having an opening in its side, like\r\nthat in the humming-top; by the alternate coiling and uncoiling of the\r\ncord upon which it is strung it receives a circular motion, the\r\nrapidity of which produces, by means of its opening, an aërial\r\nvibration that gives a loud ringing sound.\r\n\r\n“I should very much like to hear your opinion of that Egyptian wonder,\r\nthe statue of Memnon,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Its history,” answered Mr. Seymour, “is involved in considerable doubt\r\nand difficulty. Authors of credit agree in stating that it certainly\r\nsaluted the rising sun with a musical sound; but doubts are still\r\nentertained as to the cause which produced it, whether it was the\r\neffect of mechanism, or a juggle of the Egyptian priests. An English\r\ntraveller, Sir A. Smith, informs us that he visited the statue, and\r\nactually heard the sounds at six o’clock in the morning; but he\r\nbelieves that they proceeded, not from the figure, but from the\r\npedestal, and he considers that they may arise from the impulse of the\r\nair upon the stones of which it is constructed. Others have supposed\r\nthat the heat of the sun’s rays, concentrated by a mirror, may have\r\nacted upon plates of metal so as to produce the effect. It is not my\r\nintention to argue this point; but I will show you an experiment, by\r\nwhich you will, I think, be convinced that a statue might easily be\r\nconstructed like the Memnon to yield musical sounds by the application\r\nof heat, whether derived from the solar rays, or from any other source.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The “piece of apparatus” described below.]\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour produced a piece of apparatus, of which we here present the\r\nreader with a sketch. It consists of an oblong block of copper, one\r\nsurface of which is flat, the other formed by two planes meeting at an\r\nobtuse angle, and having a groove at the point of junction A. To this\r\nblock a handle is affixed.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour having thus described the form of the instrument, and\r\nstated that its construction was solely directed with a view of making\r\nit oscillate freely on any plain surface, thrust the block in the fire,\r\nand when sufficiently heated, placed it on its angular surface, upon a\r\nflat piece of lead. It immediately began to vibrate, producing at\r\nfirst, a kind of singing noise, not unlike that of the simmering of a\r\nteakettle, but the vibrations became more and more rapid until a\r\ndistinct musical sound was produced, which from time to time varied in\r\nits pitch, and gave rise to an effect scarcely inferior to that of the\r\nEolian harp.\r\n\r\n“How extremely beautiful!” said Miss Villers.\r\n\r\n“And how admirably does it illustrate the theory of musical sounds,”\r\nobserved Mr. Seymour. “We have here, you perceive, a series of impulses\r\ncommunicated to our ears by the air, at first in slow succession, and\r\nby degrees more and more rapidly; at first we hear a rattling noise,\r\nthen a low murmur, and then a hum, which by degrees acquires the\r\ncharacter of a musical note, rising higher and higher in acuteness. It\r\nis evident, therefore, from this experiment alone, by showing the\r\ncorrespondence which exists between the pitch of the note and the\r\nrapidity of the succession of the vibrations, that our sensation of the\r\ndifferent pitches of musical notes originates in the different\r\nrapidities with which their impulses are communicated to our ears.”\r\n\r\n“Pray explain to us the manner in which the block of metal is thus made\r\nto vibrate,” said Miss Villers.\r\n\r\n“It depends,” replied Mr. Seymour, “upon the alternate contraction of\r\nthe two opposite edges of the metal from the loss of heat; one of the\r\nedges coming in contact with the cold lead contracts, and by destroying\r\nthe balance of the block, causes its opposite edge to come into contact\r\nwith the lead, and to undergo the same change; and it is by this\r\nalternate action that a rapid vibration is produced, occasioning, as\r\nyou will now readily understand, the musical sounds you have just\r\nheard.”\r\n\r\nThe lecture having been concluded, Mrs. Seymour proposed that the party\r\nshould, at once, proceed to the valley, but the vicar suggested the\r\npropriety of first explaining to the children the principle upon which\r\nthe echo depended.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour concurred in this opinion, and immediately afforded the\r\nfollowing explanation:--“An echo is nothing more than a reflected\r\nsound. When the aërial vibrations strike against any obstacle of\r\nsufficient magnitude, they are reflected back to the ear, and produce a\r\nrepetition of the sound, which will appear to proceed from the point\r\nwhence they are reflected, so that the apparent direction of the voice\r\nbecomes completely changed by an echo. A considerable extent of level\r\nwall will sometimes produce it in great perfection; for a smooth\r\nsurface reflects sounds much better than a rough one: but the\r\ncircumstance which, perhaps, contributes more than any other to the\r\nperfection of an echo, is the form of the reflecting surface; a convex\r\nsurface is a very bad reflector of sound, a flat one reflects very\r\nwell, but a small degree of concavity is the form best adapted to the\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” observed the vicar, “that fluid bodies will also, under\r\ncertain circumstances, so reflect sound as to produce echoes.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly. The surface of water, especially at the bottom of a well;\r\nand sometimes even clouds will produce this effect.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say, papa,” asked Tom, “that sound is reflected from an\r\nobstacle to the ear, in the same manner as my ball is reflected after\r\nstriking the wall?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly: supposing, of course, that your ball is perfectly elastic;\r\nand in that case, you no doubt remember the direction it will follow.”\r\n\r\n“It will always make the angle of _reflection_ equal to the angle of\r\n_incidence_,”[58] said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly; and so it is with sound, since air, as you know, is\r\nperfectly elastic. If, therefore, the vibrations fall perpendicularly\r\non the obstacle, they are reflected back in the same line; if\r\nobliquely, the sound returns obliquely in the opposite direction, the\r\nangle of reflection being equal to that of incidence. You will,\r\ntherefore, readily perceive,” continued Mr. Seymour, addressing his\r\nconversation more particularly to Miss Villers, “that a person situated\r\nat an appropriate angle may hear an echo, as it is returned from the\r\nreflecting surface, without hearing the original sound which produced\r\nit. M. Genefay has described, as existing near Rouen, a curious oblique\r\necho which is not heard by the person who emits the sound. A person who\r\nsings hears only his own voice, while those who listen hear only the\r\necho.”\r\n\r\n“As a smooth and concave surface is capable of producing an echo, how\r\ndoes it happen that we so rarely meet with one in a room?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Echoes, my dear, are, in fact, produced in every room, by the\r\nreverberation of sound from its walls; but on account of the velocity\r\nwith which it travels, they are imperceptible in small chambers,\r\nbecause the sound occupies no sensible period of time in moving from\r\nthe mouth to the walls, and in returning back to the ear again,\r\nconsequently the original sound and its echo become so blended and\r\nincorporated, as to appear but one sound. As the dimensions of the\r\napartment increase, the defect will increase with it; and, in buildings\r\nfor music or public speaking, it is often highly inconvenient, and\r\ndifficult of prevention. Breaking the surface, or rendering it uneven\r\nby mouldings and ornaments, appears to be the most effectual method of\r\ncuring the evil.”\r\n\r\n“I perceive then, papa, that in order to produce a perfect echo, the\r\nperson who speaks must be at a considerable distance from the obstacle\r\nthat reflects the sound,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\n“It cannot be otherwise,” replied her father; “and if you will only\r\nconsider the rate at which sound travels, you will readily understand\r\nthe necessity of such an arrangement. In order to produce a distinct\r\necho of one syllable, or of a single sound, the reflecting obstacle\r\nmust be at least 70 feet from the sound, so that it may have to pass\r\nthrough a distance of 70 feet to get to the reflector, and 70 more to\r\nreturn to the ear, making a total passage of 140 feet, which it will\r\naccomplish in rather less than one-eighth of a second; a period of time\r\nso small, that, if it were diminished, it is evident the echo must be\r\nassimilated with the sound itself.”\r\n\r\n“But the echo in the valley,” observed Mrs. Seymour, “will repeat four\r\nor five syllables.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly. If we make the experiment at a sufficient distance from\r\nthe sandstone rocks which act as the reflector.”\r\n\r\n“It would appear, then, that the farther the reflecting object is off,\r\nthe greater number of syllables will the echo repeat; and I should\r\nthink that this fact might enable us to compute the distance of the\r\nreflector,” said Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“In a moderate way of speaking, about three and a half syllables are\r\npronounced in one second, or seven syllables in two seconds; when an\r\necho, therefore, repeats seven syllables, we may infer that the\r\nreflecting object is 1142 feet distant.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear Mr. Seymour, this must surely depend upon the nature of\r\nthe syllables,” said the vicar. “Pray excuse the interruption; but you\r\nwill admit that there must exist a great difference between the echo of\r\ndactyles and spondees. Suppose an echo should be able to return ten\r\nsyllables; thus--\r\n\r\n                     ‘Tityre, tu patulæ recubans--’\r\n\r\nI will be bound for it, that if you were to try its powers in slow\r\nheavy spondees, as _monstrum horrendum_, a return of not more than four\r\nor five syllables could be observed.”\r\n\r\n“I will not dispute that point,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nLouisa here remarked that she had often heard of some very\r\nextraordinary echoes in different parts of the world, to which her\r\nfather had not alluded; she mentioned, for instance, those which are\r\nsaid to repeat the same sound several times in succession.\r\n\r\n“From the explanation which I have already given of the nature of\r\nechoes,” said Mr. Seymour, “it will be easily conceived that a vast\r\nvariety of effects may be produced by varying the form, the shape, the\r\ndistance, and the number of reflecting surfaces: and hence we hear of\r\nvarious surprising echoes in different places. It is not difficult, for\r\ninstance, to understand the nature of compound, or tautological echoes;\r\nin which case the expression of one _ha_ will appear like a laughter.\r\nAddison mentions an extraordinary instance of this kind near Milan,\r\nwhich will return the sound of a pistol fifty-six times.”\r\n\r\n“I have understood that the echoes on the lakes of Killarney are of\r\nthis multiplied description,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“They are particularly calculated to produce reflections of sound, from\r\nthe height of the mountains, and the expanse of water,” replied Mr.\r\nSeymour, “which latter circumstance always assists the conveyance of\r\nreflected, as well as direct sound. I believe that there is a certain\r\nspot on the shore of Ross island, where the sound of a bugle produces\r\nan echo which far exceeds any other to be met with amongst the lakes;\r\nthe first echo is returned from the castle, the second from the ruined\r\nchurch of Aghadoe, the third from Mangerton, and afterwards innumerable\r\nreverberations are distinguished, which, like the faded brilliancy of\r\nan extremely multiplied reflection, are lost by distance and\r\nrepetition.”\r\n\r\n“There is an admirable echo,” said the vicar, “behind my old college at\r\nCambridge; and often have I, while walking on the road to Chesterton,\r\non a calm evening, distinctly heard twelve repetitions of the voice.\r\nLord Bacon, if I remember correctly, mentions an instance of sixteen,\r\nin some ruined church near Paris.”\r\n\r\n“It was in the church of Pont-Charenton, on the Seine,” replied Mr.\r\nSeymour; “in which place that great philosopher discovered the\r\ninability of an echo to return the letter S, for having pronounced the\r\nword _satan_, the echo replied _va-t-en_, which in French signifies\r\n_away_; from which circumstance, the Parisians concluded, that some\r\nguardian spirit prevented the walls of the sacred edifice from\r\npronouncing the name of _satan_.”\r\n\r\n“And will not an echo repeat the letter S?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Not always,” answered her father; “the hissing or sibilant noise of\r\nthe letter, when at the commencement of a word, is generally lost,\r\nunless the echo be extremely perfect.”\r\n\r\nThe party now set off on their excursion to the valley. Mr. Seymour\r\ndisposed them in such situations as were best calculated to display the\r\npowers of the echo, and to illustrate the several effects which he had\r\nendeavoured to explain. The vicar performed his experiment with\r\ndactyles and spondees, and was highly gratified to find that their\r\nresults proved, in a most satisfactory manner, the correctness of his\r\nconjecture. The attention of Miss Villers was particularly directed to\r\nthe effect of the voice of Mrs. Seymour from the orchard gate, and\r\nwhich, she said, convinced her that the sound she had heard on the\r\npreceding evening must have arisen from the cause assigned to it.\r\n\r\nAfter the party had fairly tired themselves by their converse with the\r\nairy and unsubstantial being, they descended to the sandstone rocks,\r\nwhich Mr. Seymour pointed out as the local habitation of the solitary\r\nspirit. These were duly examined by Louisa and Tom, and their operation\r\nas a reflecting screen was pointed out to them by their father. They\r\nnow returned into the geological temple; its singularly beautiful\r\npillars very naturally attracted the attention of Miss Villers, and she\r\nexpressed a wish that Mr. Seymour should describe the plan of their\r\nconstruction; for it was very evident, as she said, from the\r\ndisposition of the specimens, that the arrangements had been directed\r\nwith some view to geological illustration. Mr. Seymour felt gratified\r\nby this request, and promised to comply with her wishes, as soon as he\r\nhad finished the investigation of those laws by which the reflection of\r\nsound was governed.\r\n\r\n“Why, bless me!” exclaimed the vicar, “the revels of our airy companion\r\nare ended; and I maintain, that nothing can be more appropriate than\r\nthe consideration of the objects for which Miss Villers has expressed\r\nso much interest. In truth, the history of Echo is classically\r\nassociated with that of geology: by diving into the recesses of the\r\nrock, we do but pursue her descent from air to earth; for you, no\r\ndoubt, remember that after she had been deprived of her loquacity by\r\nJuno, she became enamoured of Narcissus, pined away, and was\r\ntransformed into stone.”[59]\r\n\r\n“I cannot but admire the ingenuity with which you embellish every\r\nsubject with classical decorations,” replied Mr. Seymour. “You,\r\nhowever, must well know that I require no such allurement on the\r\npresent occasion. I shall be most willing to afford Miss Villers the\r\ninformation she requires, as soon as I have explained to my young\r\npupils the principle of the whispering gallery in St. Paul’s; as well\r\nas some recreations which are indebted for their effects to the\r\nreflection of sound.”\r\n\r\n“I ought to apologise for the interruption I have occasioned,” said\r\nMiss Villers; “but I was not, until this moment, aware of the extent to\r\nwhich you intended to carry your illustrations.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour commenced with the subject of the “whispering gallery,” at\r\nthe foot of the dome of St. Paul’s cathedral; and in order to render\r\nintelligible the manner in which sound is concentrated, and thereby\r\nmagnified in that hollow hemisphere, he produced a diagram, of which\r\nthe annexed cut is a copy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of sound magnification.]\r\n\r\nHe explained it as follows:--\r\n\r\n“M shows the situation of the mouth of the speaker, and E that of the\r\near of the hearer. Now, since sound radiates in all directions, a part\r\nof it will proceed directly from M to E, while other rays of it will\r\nproceed from M to _u_, and from M to _z_, &c.; but the ray that\r\nimpinges upon _u_ will be reflected to E, while that which first\r\ntouches _z_ will be reflected to _y_, and from thence to E; and so of\r\nall intermediate rays, which are omitted in the figure, to avoid\r\nconfusion. It is evident, therefore, that the sound at E will be much\r\nstronger than if it had proceeded immediately from M without the\r\nassistance of the dome; for, in that case, the rays at _z_ and _u_\r\nwould have proceeded in straight lines, and consequently could never\r\nhave arrived at the point E.”\r\n\r\n“I have understood that a similar effect may be witnessed in the stone\r\nrecesses on Westminster-bridge,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“That is the fact,” replied Mr. Seymour. “The recesses to which you\r\nallude are semi-domes; and if a person whispers in the focus of one of\r\nthem, he will be distinctly heard by another stationed in the focus of\r\nthe opposite one. Two inanimate busts may be thus made to appear as if\r\nholding a conversation, by placing them in the foci of two large\r\nconcave mirrors constructed of pasteboard, and arranged opposite to\r\neach other; when a whisper uttered to the one will seem to proceed from\r\nthe other by the reflection of sound.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour now removed a shell from a group of corallines which\r\ndecorated a part of the temple, and desired Tom to place it to his ear.\r\n\r\n“I hear a noise which appears to me to resemble that of the sea,” cried\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said the vicar, “and there is a popular belief that it is the\r\nmurmur of the sea, which the shell actually sends forth, betraying, as\r\nit were, its marine origin.”\r\n\r\n“And what produces the sound?” inquired Louisa.\r\n\r\n“The interior of the shell merely concentrates, and thus magnifies the\r\nsounds around us, so as to render them audible: a goblet applied to the\r\near will be found to produce the same effect,” replied her father.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it is upon the same principle that the speaking-trumpet is\r\nmade to convey sound to a distance,” remarked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Since sound radiates in all directions, it follows that, if such\r\nradiation be prevented by confining it in tubes, it may be carried to a\r\ngreat distance with very little diminution of its effect; and hence the\r\nuse and application of those trumpets, or tin speaking-pipes, which are\r\nnow commonly used for conveying intelligence from one part of a house\r\nto another. The trumpet used by deaf persons acts on the same\r\nprinciple; but as the voice enters the trumpet at the large instead of\r\nthe small end of the instrument, it is not so much confined, nor is the\r\nsound so much increased.”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said Mrs. Seymour; “that the experiment exhibited some\r\ntime since in London under the title of the _Invisible Girl_, and which\r\nexcited such general curiosity, was discovered to depend upon an\r\narrangement of this kind.”\r\n\r\n“I expected that you would allude to that exhibition,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour; “and as I was anxious to provide my young pupils with some new\r\namusement, as a reward for their industry, I have directed Tom Plank to\r\nconstruct the necessary apparatus for exhibiting and explaining the\r\ndeception. On our return to the lodge, I have no doubt we shall find\r\nthat every arrangement for the performance has been completed.”\r\n\r\nMiss Villers was now gratified by a view of the more interesting\r\nspecimens in the geological temple. Mr. Seymour also explained the\r\ndesign of the pillars which had so greatly excited her curiosity.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the party, Mr. Seymour found, as he had anticipated,\r\nthat the necessary apparatus for the experiment of the “Invisible\r\nGirl!” had been duly arranged, and that Tom Plank was in attendance to\r\nafford any assistance which might be farther required. We shall proceed\r\nto describe all the visible mechanism, as it appeared to the children\r\non entering Mr. Seymour’s study, and of which we here present the\r\nreader with a perspective sketch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apparatus for Invisible Girl experiment.]\r\n\r\nIt consisted of a wooden frame, not very unlike a bedstead, having four\r\nupright posts, _a a a a_, and a cross-rail at top and bottom to\r\nstrengthen them. The frame thus constructed stood upon a low table, and\r\nfrom the top of each of the four pillars sprang four bent brass wires,\r\nwhich converged to the point _c_. From these wires a hollow copper ball\r\nwas suspended by ribands, so as to cut off all possible communication\r\nwith the frame. The globe was supposed to contain the invisible being,\r\nas the voice apparently proceeded from the interior of it; and for this\r\npurpose it was equipped with the mouths of four trumpets, placed around\r\nit in a horizontal direction, and at right angles to each other, as\r\nshown in the annexed section, in which the globe is represented in the\r\ncentre; _d d d d_ are the trumpets, and _b b b b_ the frame surrounding\r\nthem, at the distance of about half an inch from their mouths. Such as\r\nwe have described was the apparatus, which had been constructed under\r\nthe direction of Mr. Seymour, who informed the party that, if any of\r\nthem would ask a question of his little fairy, and direct the voice\r\ninto one of the trumpets, an answer would immediately be returned from\r\nthe ball.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Top of the Invisible Girl apparatus.]\r\n\r\n“Let me interrogate her,” exclaimed Louisa, as she advanced towards the\r\nrailing. “Tell me, mysterious being, the name of the person who now\r\naddresses you.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Louisa Seymour,” answered a voice sufficiently audible to Louisa,\r\nwhose ear was near the mouth of the trumpet, and yet so distant and\r\nfeeble, that it appeared as if coming from a very diminutive being, and\r\nthus heightened the deception. Each of the party successively asked\r\nsome question; and the surprise of the children may be more easily\r\nimagined than described. Tom examined the ball, the trumpets, and the\r\nframework; but he was unable to discover any clue by which he could\r\nunravel the mystery. At length Mr. Seymour proceeded to the\r\nexplanation. He told them that the mechanism owed its effects to the\r\ncombined operation of two principles with which they were already\r\nacquainted; the concentration and conveyance of sound by means of a\r\nspeaking-pipe, and its reflection from an appropriate surface so as to\r\nchange its apparent direction, by producing an artificial echo. He then\r\nshowed them the pipe which was concealed in one of the legs of the\r\nframe, and explained in what manner the voice of Tom Plank, who had\r\nbeen stationed in an adjoining room, was conveyed to the mouth of the\r\ntrumpet, and thence reflected to the ear of the observer. By means of\r\nthe annexed section, we shall hope to render this subject as\r\nintelligible to our readers, as did Mr. Seymour to his little pupils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Side view of Invisible Girl apparatus, with secret pipe\r\nshown.]\r\n\r\n_b b_ represent two of the legs of the frame, one of which, as well as\r\nhalf the rail, is made into a tube, the end of which opens immediately\r\nopposite to the centre of the trumpet. This hole is very small, and\r\nconcealed by mouldings; the other end communicates by a tin pipe, _p\r\np_, which passes, in a concealed manner, along the floor of the room,\r\ninto an adjoining closet, where the confederate is concealed. It is\r\nevident that any sound, directed into the mouth of the trumpet, will be\r\nimmediately reflected back to the orifice of the tube, and distinctly\r\nheard by a person who places his ear to the mouth of the funnel _m_;\r\nwhile the answer returned by him, travelling along the tin funnel, _p\r\np_, will issue from its concealed orifice, and striking upon the\r\nconcave surface of the trumpet, be returned to the ear as an echo, and\r\nthus appear as if it had proceeded from the interior of the ball.\r\n\r\nThe vicar observed, “that this deception of the _Invisible Girl_, which\r\nhad formerly created so much interest, was little more than the revival\r\nof the old and well-known mechanism of the _speaking bust_, which\r\nconsisted of a tube, from the mouth of a bust, leading to a confederate\r\nin an adjoining room, and of another tube to the same place, ending in\r\nthe ear of the figure; by the latter of which, a sound whispered in the\r\near of the bust was immediately carried to the confederate, who\r\ninstantly returned an answer by the other tube, ending in the mouth of\r\nthe figure, which therefore appeared to utter it. The Invisible Girl,”\r\ncontinued the vicar, “evidently only differs from that contrivance in\r\nthis single circumstance, that an artificial echo is produced by means\r\nof the trumpet, and thus the sound no longer appears to proceed in its\r\noriginal direction.”\r\n\r\n“Your remark is perfectly correct, my dear vicar,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nTom Plank, with an air of self-satisfaction, at this moment emerged\r\nfrom his retreat, and enquired whether his performance had not met with\r\nthe approbation of his employer.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Tom Plank, “as I am now fully satisfied that any plan\r\nof propelling live and dead luggage through funnels can never succeed,\r\nI propose to employ tubes for conveying sounds to a great distance, so\r\nas to do away with the use of telegraphs?”\r\n\r\n“Why that plan is more practicable, but less novel, than the one you\r\nhave just abandoned,” answered Mr. Seymour. “At the latter end of the\r\nlast century, a man of the name of Gautier conceived a method of\r\ntransmitting articulate sounds to an immense distance. He proposed the\r\nconstruction of horizontal tunnels that should widen at their\r\nextremities, by means of which the ticking of a watch might be heard\r\nmore distinctly at the distance of two hundred feet than when placed\r\nclose to the ear. I think he calculated that a succession of such\r\ntunnels would transmit a verbal message nine hundred miles in an\r\nhour.”(50)\r\n\r\n“Only think of that!” ejaculated Tom Plank; “to make a communication\r\nfrom London to Edinburgh in about twenty-five minutes!”\r\n\r\n“True, my friend; but what would you say, were I to suggest a method of\r\ncommunicating information to any distance without the loss even of a\r\nsingle second of time.”(51)\r\n\r\n“There now,” cried the vicar, “you have supplied Tom Plank with some\r\nfresh barm to set his brains working.”\r\n\r\n“He is an indefatigable fellow, I must allow,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nAfter this discourse the vicar rose from his seat, and on walking\r\nacross the room, the creaking of his shoes excited the attention of Mr.\r\nSeymour, who, with his accustomed gaiety, observed, that “the vicar had\r\nmusic in his _sole_.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Seymour!” exclaimed Mr. Twaddleton, with a look which we should in\r\nvain endeavour to describe, “the infirmity of my shoes, _crepitus\r\ncrepidæ_, is at all events sanctioned by high antiquity; for we are\r\ntold by Philostratus, in his Epistles, that Vulcan, being jealous of\r\nVenus, made her creaking shoes, in order that he might hear whenever\r\nshe stirred.”\r\n\r\nSo ludicrous an appeal to antiquity would have overcome Heraclitus\r\nhimself, no wonder then that the whole party enjoyed a hearty laugh at\r\nthe worthy vicar’s expense.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Twaddleton, if, as you say, I have brought down philosophy\r\nto account for the most familiar occurrences, it is but just that I\r\nshould return the compliment, by declaring that you are equally\r\nprepared to throw a classical interest around the humblest as well as\r\nthe most dignified subject, _à capite usque ad calcem_,” observed Mr.\r\nSeymour.\r\n\r\n“Now, Tom, as you have so lately been instructed in the different\r\nsources of sound, do tell your good friend, the vicar, the cause of the\r\ncreaking of his shoes,” said his father.\r\n\r\n“The dryness of the leather, I suppose,” answered the young philosopher.\r\n\r\n“A certain state of dryness is certainly a necessary condition, or else\r\nthe cohesion between the inner and outer sole would exclude the air.\r\nCorrectly speaking, the creaking depends upon the sudden compression of\r\nthe air contained between the two surfaces of leather; just as a sound\r\nis produced by the clapping of the hands by the air thus set in\r\nvibration. Shoes with single soles, therefore, never creak, and by\r\ninterposing a piece of oil-silk between the two soles, you will so far\r\nensure the contact of their surfaces as to obviate the sound,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour.\r\n\r\n“That is at all events a piece of practical philosophy worth knowing;\r\nand I shall accordingly instruct my operator, Jerry Styles, upon this\r\npoint,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\n“So you see, my dear sir, I am no bad shoemaker, although I have never\r\nyet made a shoe,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“To be sure--to be sure,” exclaimed the vicar; “for as Horace has it--\r\n\r\n          ----“Sapiens crepidas sibi nunquam\r\n               Nec soleas fecit: Sutor tamen est sapiens.”[60]\r\n\r\n“You never made a happier quotation,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“I have only one other remark to make,” continued he, “which the\r\nconsideration of this subject has very naturally suggested--that the\r\nvarious strange sounds, which have from time to time alarmed the\r\nsuperstitious, may be readily explained upon the simple principles we\r\nhave been discussing. I well remember a whole family having been thrown\r\ninto a state of terror, by a mysterious sound which regularly recurred\r\nevery evening; when it was at length discovered to arise from the\r\ncrawling of snails over the window; their slimy surfaces, as they moved\r\nalong, produced a friction, which occasioned a vibration of the glass.”\r\n\r\n“And I never recall to my recollection, without some degree of terror,”\r\nsaid the vicar, “the night I passed in an old oaken chamber which had\r\nthe reputation of being haunted. A bright fire cheerfully blazed in the\r\ngrate as I entered the apartment, and casting its ruddy light around,\r\nin some measure dissipated the prejudice which had been raised to the\r\ndisparagement of my dormitory; but awaking in the night, my fire was\r\nout, and a succession of the most extraordinary noises I ever heard\r\nassailed me.”\r\n\r\n“All which are easily explicable,” said Mr. Seymour. “The old oaken\r\nmaterials were expanded by the heat of your fire, and on the apartment\r\ncooling, they again contracted, and gave origin to all the sounds you\r\ndescribe.”\r\n\r\n“How unsparingly does science clip the wings of imagination!” observed\r\nMiss Villers.\r\n\r\nThe party now dispersed. Miss Villers retired into the drawing-room, to\r\nafford Louisa some musical instruction; the vicar took his departure\r\nfor the sake of visiting a sick parishioner; and Major Snapwell to make\r\narrangements for an important event, with the nature of which the\r\nreader will very shortly be made acquainted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  “Murænæ optimæ flutæ sunt in Sicilia.” _Varr.

We\r\ndid not think it right to impart this secret to our readers, until the\r\nperiod should arrive when, in conformity with the usage of the world,\r\nthe subject might be referred to without reserve or impropriety. To\r\nsuch a period has our history arrived, and we shall therefore at once\r\ncommunicate the whole story, by relating the substance of a\r\nconversation which took place between Major Snapwell and the Vicar, in\r\nthe presence of Mr. and Mrs. Seymour, in the library of Overton Lodge.\r\n\r\n“Your hand, my dearest friend! your hand, and with it the\r\ncongratulations of your heart,” exclaimed the Major, as he approached\r\nMr. Twaddleton; “our friends here,” added he, as he bowed to Mr. and\r\nMrs. Seymour, “are already acquainted with the proposed union between\r\nmy worthy nephew, Henry Beecham, and the charming Isabella Villers; and\r\nmay Heaven shed the dew of its blessing upon them!”\r\n\r\n“Amen!” ejaculated the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I am most anxious that the ceremony should take place at\r\nOverton, and that you should officiate upon the occasion.”\r\n\r\n“Most cheerfully shall I comply with your request; ‘_connubio jungam\r\nstabili_,’ as the immortal poet has it,” was the vicar’s reply.\r\n\r\n“I have also to inform you,” continued the major, “that it is my wish\r\nto diffuse a portion of that delight, which this event will impart to\r\nme, over the neighbourhood in which I shall probably pass the days that\r\nmay be yet spared to me; listen, therefore, to the plan which I have\r\ndevised for carrying this into effect. I design to give a public\r\nentertainment, upon a plan as novel as its scale shall be extensive; it\r\nshall not be a mere blaze of the spirits, but the recreation of the\r\nmind, and the jubilee of reason.”\r\n\r\n“An entertainment!” muttered the vicar, whose countenance afforded any\r\nthing but encouragement to such a scheme.\r\n\r\n“Ay, vicar; an entertainment which shall be conducted with every regard\r\nto ancient usage, and classical correctness,” said the major, as he\r\ncast a sly glance at Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nThe countenance of the vicar brightened; and he begged his worthy\r\nfriend to be more explicit, and to state the nature of his intended\r\nfête.\r\n\r\n“You already know that this boy of mine is shortly to conduct Miss\r\nVillers to the temple of Hymen; I would seize that happy occasion for\r\ngiving a rural fête, in my park, to the inhabitants of Overton and its\r\nneighbourhood; and, as there are no less than three events which I am\r\nanxious to celebrate, I propose that this same fête shall be continued\r\nthrough three successive days. On the first shall be commemorated the\r\nprovidential escape of my nephew from shipwreck; on the second, his\r\nmarriage; and on the third, my purchase and occupation of Osterley\r\nPark--What think you of my plan?”\r\n\r\n“Why, truly, it would admit of much appropriate pageantry, and the\r\narrangement is, doubtless, countenanced by classical authority.\r\nAugustus triumphed three days, for the purpose of commemorating three\r\ngreat events; the first of which was the defeat of the Pannonians and\r\nDalmatii; the second, the battle of Actium; and the third, the\r\nreduction of Egypt. Then, again, we have the _Ludi Magni_ of the\r\nRomans, and the solemn Athenian feast, _Apaturia_, which lasted during\r\nthree days; and above all, the Secular Games, which were continued\r\nthrough the same period. In the face of such authorities, it would\r\ncertainly ill become me to offer any objection; although, as vicar of\r\nthe parish, I cannot conscientiously close my eyes against the evils\r\nwhich might possibly arise from such protracted revelry. I would,\r\ntherefore, with submission, propose that the three events to which you\r\nallude, should be celebrated by three distinct festivals on one and the\r\nsame day.”\r\n\r\nThe major saw plainly that the vicar might be made to approve of, or\r\ndissent from, any plan, by the dexterous use of classical authority; he\r\ntherefore determined to use it as a talisman for the accomplishment of\r\nhis purpose.\r\n\r\n“I like your proposition,” replied the major, “but I greatly fear that\r\nyou will not be able to support it by any classical authority; and\r\nremember, that every thing must be conducted in the strictest\r\naccordance with ancient usage.”\r\n\r\n“I respect your intention,” answered the vicar, “and will immediately\r\nsearch the writings of Lipsius for a precedent; an author who has\r\ncollected fifteen laws of the Roman entertainments; or, perhaps, the\r\nPandects of Franciscus Modius, who has so ably treated of nuptial\r\nceremonies, will furnish the desired information.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour here interrupted the conversation, by enquiring of the\r\nmajor the plan of those amusements which he proposed to provide.\r\n\r\n“I will convert the elm meadow at Osterley Park into a fair,” replied\r\nthe major, “wherein every species of amusement shall be exhibited: I\r\nwill engage that vagabond Punch, who, like a snail, travels about the\r\ncountry with his house at his back, to display his hereditary wit, and\r\nmimic drolleries; tumblers, rope-dancers, conjurors, fire-eaters, and,\r\nin short, the whole merry train of Comus, shall be pressed into our\r\nservice. After these exhibitions, the company may weave the mazy dance,\r\nfor platforms shall be erected for their accommodation; I will arrange\r\norchestras for music, and ornamented tents for refreshments. The\r\nvicar,” observed the major, with an arch smile, “shall open the ball\r\nwith the bride.”\r\n\r\n“Had I numbered a few olympiads less, major, I might not have declined\r\nso flattering a distinction,” replied Mr. Twaddleton, evidently not\r\ndispleased with the compliment.\r\n\r\n“Find some classical authority for the measure, and let your age\r\nsanction the propriety of my proposal,” said the major.\r\n\r\n“Your suggestion merits attention,--let me see--I have it, major.\r\nSocrates learned to dance very late in life, and Cato, with all his\r\nseverity of manners, disdained not, at the age of sixty, to practise\r\nit. I will, therefore, comply with your desire, and certainly lead the\r\nbride down the first dance.”\r\n\r\n“The canal,” continued the major, “shall, for the first time, float the\r\nproud emblems of British glory on its glassy bosom; and when the shades\r\nof evening fall, my Lilliputian ships shall engage--such cannonading!\r\nsuch nautical evolutions!! Mr. Seymour.”\r\n\r\n“How charming! how very delightful!” exclaimed Louisa and Fanny: “but\r\npray, papa, do allow Tom to return from school to witness all these\r\namusements.”\r\n\r\n“Fear not,” said the major; “I shall make that a condition; and I trust\r\nyour papa will not refuse the request.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” replied the father; “I shall be anxious to seize so\r\nfavourable an opportunity for explaining to my children the various\r\ntricks they will witness, and the machinery by which the numerous\r\ndeceptions will be accomplished; thus shall I convert that which, to\r\nthe common eye, will appear as a scene of idle revelry, into a school\r\nof philosophy, and in accordance with my favourite plan, ‘turn sport\r\ninto science.’”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, Mr. Seymour, you are a perfect alchymist, and extract\r\ngold from every thing you touch; you have already derived scientific\r\ninformation from the most miscellaneous and trifling amusements, and\r\nwill, no doubt, upon this occasion, convert our very pies and puddings\r\ninto instruments of instruction; thus verifying the old adage, ‘that\r\nthere is reason in roasting of eggs,’” said the major.\r\n\r\n“I perceive that the major is not aware of the philosophy which\r\nsuggested that adage,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Nor am I,” said Mr. Seymour, “and therefore pray enlighten us upon\r\nthat point.”\r\n\r\n“You doubtless know that there is a little air bag at the large end of\r\nevery egg, called the _folliculus aeris_, and which, as we are told, is\r\ndesigned to furnish a supply of air to the growing chick; if,\r\ntherefore, an egg be exposed to the temperature of hot embers, this air\r\nwill be suddenly expanded, the shell burst, and its contents scattered\r\ninto the ashes. To prevent such an occurrence, the careful house-wife\r\npricks the blunt end of the shell with a needle, so as to allow the\r\nexpanded air to escape, and thus to prevent the accident I have just\r\nexplained; from which it appears that there is reason, or philosophy,\r\nin roasting an egg.”\r\n\r\n“Capital, upon my word!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Well, but, papa, we have interrupted the major in his delightful\r\ndescription; he had not concluded the account of his proposed fête,”\r\nsaid Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Pray go on,” cried Fanny: “let me see, where did you leave off? Oh, I\r\nremember, you were interrupted in a temporary tent, which I hope you\r\nintend to decorate with garlands.”\r\n\r\n“Leave all that to the vicar, young lady; he will, no doubt, display\r\nhis classical taste in the emblematical appointments.”\r\n\r\n“I shall terminate the festivities of the day by a grand display of\r\nfire-works; the arrangements of which will necessarily fall under my\r\nown more immediate direction. The vicar,” added the major, “will\r\nperhaps allow me to proclaim him as master of the revels; for he is, as\r\nwe all well know, deeply versed in ancient customs, and I am especially\r\nanxious that every department should be conducted with classical taste.”\r\n\r\n“I willingly accept the office,” said Mr. Twaddleton, with a gracious\r\nsmile, “since there is authority for my acquiescence. The Romans, in\r\ntheir entertainments, usually appointed a person whom they styled king,\r\nand held responsible upon such occasions. I accept it also, on a\r\ndifferent ground; that my presence may check the enthusiasm of the\r\npeople, and restrain the hilarity of the evening within the boundary of\r\nrational decorum.”\r\n\r\n“If in the arrangement of your banquet, my assistance can prove of any\r\nservice, command me,” said Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Believe me sincere, my dear madam, when I say, that the kind manner in\r\nwhich you receive my plan, and offer to promote its execution, affords\r\nme the highest gratification; if I decline your services, it is only\r\nfrom a fear of usurping the sovereignty of our master of the\r\nceremonies,” replied the major.\r\n\r\n“What! am I to descend into the lower regions, and hold converse with\r\nyour ancient Sibyl, the cook? Would you call upon me to marshal the\r\ndishes? Am I, at once, to perform the offices of ‘_Dapifer_,’\r\n‘_Lardrenius_,’ ‘_Magister Coquorum_,’ and ‘_Prægustator_?’” cried the\r\nhorrified vicar.\r\n\r\n“Have I not declared that every part of my entertainment shall be\r\nstrictly classical? and ought not each dish to convey some moral\r\ndevice, some allegorical design? Are we to feed with as little\r\ndiscrimination as the dogs that devoured the sacred Apis?”\r\n\r\nThe knowledge which the reader must have already collected of Mr.\r\nTwaddleton’s character will have satisfied him that, in every action of\r\nhis life, he was more or less influenced by the spell of ancient\r\nauthority; but we doubt whether he may not yet have to learn the extent\r\nto which the reverend gentleman carried this enthusiasm. We shall,\r\naccordingly, beg to state a few instances, which will serve to\r\nillustrate this circumstance. Be it known, then, that the very first\r\nact which announced the preferment of the Reverend Peter Twaddleton to\r\nthe dignity of Vicar of Overton, was not, as some might suppose, an\r\nincreased rate of compensation for the tithes; nor was it a rate levied\r\nfor the repairs of his house; but the removal of the vane from the\r\nspire of the church, which, as it consisted of a simple cross piece of\r\niron, seemed to the vicar’s imagination to be wriggling about, without\r\nany consciousness of its ancient origin and dignity. He therefore, at\r\nhis own expense, replaced it by the figure of a cock, which he caused\r\nto be duly executed after an authentic model. It will be remembered\r\nthat the crowing of the cock warned Peter; for which reason the monks\r\nfirst placed the figure of that bird on their churches, as an emblem to\r\ncall the people to prayers; and, since the image was made to revolve\r\nwith the wind, it soon acquired the name of the _weathercock_. With\r\nrespect to the arrangement of his table, he displayed an equal\r\nveneration for ancient forms. He perpetuated the use of the wassail\r\nbowl, which was scrupulously prepared with apples and ale, according to\r\nthe most orthodox receipt. His mince-pies at Christmas were fabricated\r\nwith the same inflexible adherence to ancient authority; he maintained\r\nthat the introduction of meat into their composition was a scandalous\r\nheresy; that the choicest productions of the East ought alone to be\r\nadmitted, since the custom was originally intended to allegorise the\r\nofferings made by the wise men who came from afar to worship, bringing\r\n_spices_, &c. He was also as critical with respect to the _shape_, as\r\nhe was with regard to the _composition_ of these dainty inventions; he\r\ninsisted upon the ancient or coffin shape, which he stated to have been\r\nin imitation of the cratch, or manger, wherein the infant Jesus had\r\nlain. His table was, with the same antiquarian correctness, punctually\r\nsupplied at Easter with a gammon of bacon; a custom, which would,\r\nperhaps, have been more honoured in the breach than in the observance,\r\nsince it was evidently founded on the abhorrence our forefathers\r\nthought proper to express towards the Jews, at the season of\r\ncommemorating the resurrection.[61] The idea was in direct opposition\r\nto the liberal sentiments of the vicar, but, being an ancient custom,\r\nhe never ventured to question its propriety. In like manner, his\r\ntranquillity would have been sadly disturbed, had Annette ever\r\nforgotten the _pancakes_ on Shrove-Tuesday; for he was decidedly of\r\nopinion that it was a dish which had derived its origin from the\r\nheathen Fornacalia, a festival instituted by Numa,[62] in honour of the\r\ngoddess Fornax; and was intended to commemorate the making of bread\r\nbefore the invention of ovens. Upon the subject of cross-buns he\r\ndisplayed great profundity; he observed, that the word _bun_ was\r\nderived from _boun_, a species of sacred bread described by Hesychius,\r\nand which was anciently offered to the gods; in support of which\r\nopinion he quoted Julius Pollux and Diogenes Laertius; nor did he\r\nrelinquish the subject, until he had ably descanted upon the address\r\nwith which heathen customs had been, as it were, naturalized, and\r\nperpetuated as Christian observances. The _boun_, he would say, lost\r\nits idolatrous impurity by receiving the sign of the cross; in the same\r\nmanner that Druidical idols, and _stones erect_, by having crosses cut\r\nupon them, continued to receive a justifiable reverence, even as late\r\nas the seventh century.\r\n\r\nIn short, the extent to which our excellent but eccentric vicar was\r\ncarried, on such occasions, can scarcely be credited, except by those\r\nwho are acquainted with the extravagant whimsies of a genuine\r\nantiquary. We have never contemplated this part of his character\r\nwithout congratulating the rising generation at Overton on the\r\ncircumstance of the offices of village schoolmaster and vicar of the\r\nparish not having centered in the same individual; for we have not the\r\nshadow of a doubt, so great was his veneration for ancient usages, but\r\nhe would have whipped up every child within his jurisdiction, on the\r\nmorning of Childermas-day, or that of the Holy Innocents, as we are\r\ninformed was the ancient custom, “in order that the memorial of Herod’s\r\nmurder of the Innocents might stick the closer.” On the other hand, he\r\nwould readily have forgiven any offence had the boy only cited a few\r\nlines from a favourite classic; for often had he been heard to relate\r\nwith much satisfaction the well-known story of the Athenian Captives,\r\nwhose lives were preserved in Sicily, from their being able to repeat\r\nportions of the dramas of Euripides. Whether, in spite of the censure\r\nand remonstrance of St. Austin, he would have ventured to continue the\r\nhalf-holiday on a Thursday, it is difficult to say; although the high\r\nantiquity of a custom originally established in honour of Jupiter,\r\nwould, doubtless, have produced its influence upon the judgment of the\r\nantiquary.\r\n\r\nOne more anecdote, and we trust our illustrations of the vicar’s\r\ncharacter will be perfect. The reader will remember, that to Dr.\r\nDoseall, the renowned Esculapius of the village, he had given the title\r\nof _Polyphemus_: this might appear inconsistent with his acknowledged\r\nkindness, and we are therefore bound to state his justification. “Was\r\nit not,” he asked, “a notorious custom in Athens to give nicknames\r\nexpressive of personal peculiarities? Do we not learn from\r\nAristophanes, that the poet Theognis, from the deficient warmth of his\r\ncompositions, went by the name of _Snow_? and moreover, did not the\r\nAthenians, as a body, from their passion for news, and their habit of\r\nswallowing open-mouthed the flying rumours of the day, receive the\r\nsoubriquet of _Gapers_, just as the London inhabitants of the present\r\nday rejoice in that of _Cockneys_?”\r\n\r\nWe have thought it right to relate these few anecdotes, in order to\r\nvindicate the propriety of the major’s choice, and to convince the\r\nreader that a better qualified master of the ceremonies could not\r\npossibly have been provided. Having, therefore, paid this homage to the\r\njudgment of the major, and to the antiquarian lore of the vicar, we\r\nshall return to the party, whom we had rather abruptly quitted, and\r\ncontinue our relation of the conversation which followed.\r\n\r\n“So, then, you have determined that the vicar shall superintend the\r\nbanquet,” said Mrs. Seymour. “There is, however, one part of the\r\nceremony which I shall certainly not feel disposed to resign into his\r\nhands, the ordering and disposition of the bridal cakes; the genius of\r\nGunter shall be invoked to produce one of the most triumphant specimens\r\nof his art.”\r\n\r\n“Psha, nonsense! you surely would not countenance that ice-clad\r\nmountain, through whose dark regions the demon of indigestion holds\r\nundisputed sway.”\r\n\r\n“Why, zounds, vicar, do you expect me to submit to such vagaries?--a\r\nwedding without a cake!--it cannot be tolerated. I shall next hear of\r\nan English feast without roast-beef,” vociferated the major.\r\n\r\n“You shall, doubtless, have your cake; but let it be the true Roman\r\nbride-cake, made after the receipt which Cato has given in his work,\r\n_De Re Rustica_, chapter 121. You must be aware, Mr. Seymour, that the\r\n_mustacea_ of the Romans, the species of cake used at weddings,\r\nconsisted of meal, aniseed, cummin, and several other aromatic\r\ningredients.”\r\n\r\n“And do you seriously believe that any of us will swallow such a\r\nmedicated farrago?” said the major.\r\n\r\n“The unenlightened may, perhaps, refuse it; and should the children\r\nprefer your modern combination, they might stand excused, since\r\nclassical inspiration rarely descends upon a boy, until he has\r\nconstrued a Greek chorus,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Were I to swallow a grain of it,” said Mrs. Seymour, “I verily believe\r\nI should be ill for a week.”\r\n\r\n“Mere prejudice, madam; the object of the _mustacea_ was actually to\r\nremove or prevent the indigestion which might be occasioned by eating\r\ntoo copiously at the marriage entertainment; and it must, I think, be\r\nacknowledged that the compound was better adapted for such a purpose\r\nthan the modern bride-cake, to which it gave origin.”\r\n\r\n“With respect to the _roast-beef_, to which the major has just\r\nalluded,” continued the vicar, “I shall only observe, that it was not\r\nuntil the reign of Henry VIII. that it appears to have taken its part\r\nin the formation of our national character.”\r\n\r\n“I would beg to enquire to whom the selection and arrangement of the\r\ncomic entertainments are to be intrusted. Unless the major should have\r\nalready found a competent person, I think I can recommend to his notice\r\nan individual who is eminently qualified for the duties,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour.\r\n\r\n“I am, at this moment, in quest of such a director,” said the major.\r\n\r\n“Ned Hopkins, then, who has for some time past taken up his abode at\r\nour village alehouse, is the very person, of all others, whom you seek.\r\nI have no doubt that for a trifling consideration he will undertake the\r\noffice; and I feel equally confident that he will execute its duties to\r\nyour satisfaction.”\r\n\r\n“Ned Hopkins!” exclaimed the vicar, with some surprise.\r\n\r\n“To be sure; and who better understands the trim of those itinerant\r\nsons of Comus? Was not his father a mountebank doctor, and a professor\r\nof the art of legerdemain?”\r\n\r\n“I value not Ned Hopkins the less on that account; the immortal Virgil\r\nwas the son of a servant, or assistant, to a wandering astrologer, or\r\n‘Medicus Magus,’ as Juvenal has it; and the mother of Euripides was a\r\ncabbage-woman, for which Aristophanes so unjustifiably ridicules him.\r\nBut my dislike to Ned Hopkins is founded upon his own dissipated\r\nhabits, his disgusting jokes, and Bacchanalian buffoonery.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” continued Mr. Seymour, “and his bad puns, vile quotations, and\r\nhackneyed proverbs; and yet you must confess that, after all, he is a\r\nvery clever fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” observed the vicar, “Satan does not usually select a fool as his\r\nambassador.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, gentlemen, this must needs be a very amusing fellow; and\r\nyou have so far excited my curiosity, as to make me desirous of hearing\r\nsomething farther of his history and habits,” said the major.\r\n\r\n“He is one of those loose spirits,” replied Mr. Seymour, “who live upon\r\nexpedients; and measuring their consciences by their wants, derive a\r\nrevenue from sources, of which those who jog on quietly through the\r\nbeaten paths of life have not the most remote conception. He commenced\r\nhis career under the tutelage of the first fire-eater of the day, but\r\nhaving clumsily scalded his mouth, he lost his reputation, and found it\r\nadvisable to seek some other stage for the display of his abilities.\r\nPossessed of a very considerable degree of native humour and caustic\r\nshrewdness, he engaged himself as a ‘mercenary,’ or literary drudge, to\r\na popular publisher of comic song books, sanguinary murders, magical\r\nmagazines, amorous valentines, oracles of health, and plans for the\r\nliquidation of the national debt; which occupations have, as I have\r\nbeen credibly informed, produced for him during a successful season,\r\nsome twenty or thirty pounds in the lawful coin of the realm: but Ned,\r\nlike many a great genius, was better pleased with an hour of idleness\r\nthan a week of study; and, strange to say, would at any time have\r\npreferred a cup of wine to a bucketful of the finest water from\r\nHelicon; no sooner, therefore, had he collected a few pounds, than he\r\ndescended from his high literary station, a lofty garret; and, taking\r\nup his abode at some hedge alehouse, would enjoy a life of happy\r\nleisure, until every particle of that worldly substance which he had\r\ngained by inspiration from above, was gratefully returned to the skies\r\nin the form of tobacco fumes. For some months past,” added Mr. Seymour,\r\n“he has been a constant resident at the Bag of Nails, where, as I am\r\nled to believe, he pays for nothing but his tobacco; the worthy hostess\r\nhaving found him a very profitable bait for customers, is too willing\r\nto barter the drippings of the kitchen for his wit, and the leakage of\r\nthe tap-room for his songs.”\r\n\r\n“I am very curious to become acquainted with this comical being,” said\r\nthe major.\r\n\r\n“Suppose we walk into the village,” said Mr. Seymour; “we shall be\r\ncertain of finding him smoking his pipe on a bench before the alehouse\r\ndoor; where he is as regularly stationed by his patroness, to catch\r\ncustomers, as the saucer of treacle is placed in the window of a\r\npastry-cook to attract flies.”\r\n\r\n“You will excuse my accompanying you,” cried Mr. Twaddleton; “I cannot\r\nrelish his stale jokes and potted stories.”\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen accordingly directed their route through Forest Lane, and\r\ntook leave of the vicar at the entrance of the church-yard. On arriving\r\nwithin twenty yards of the public-house, Mr. Seymour noticed a column\r\nof smoke which curled in wreaths about its porch. “There sits Ned,”\r\ncried he; “I knew we should find him at his post.”\r\n\r\n“Hopkins! Hopkins!” cried Mr. Seymour, “I fear you have not taken the\r\nworthy vicar’s advice.”\r\n\r\n“An old dog cannot alter its way of barking, sir; nor is it easy to\r\nstraight in the oak the crook that grew in the sapling.”\r\n\r\n“I am to presume, then, to speak courteously, that you are still, ‘a\r\nman of leisure.’”\r\n\r\n“Ay, verily am I; as idle, sir, as a chimney in the dog-days,” replied\r\nthe wag of the tap-room.\r\n\r\n“That, by the by, is not a very happy simile of yours, when applied to\r\na man who is _smoking_ all day long,” observed Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“I admit it,” said Ned, “so here’s another for you,--as lazy as\r\nLudlam’s dog, that leaned his head against the wall to bark. But, after\r\nall, Mr. Seymour, a day of leisure is to me a golden age, and I am of\r\nmy Lord Peterborough’s way of thinking, who used to say, ‘a golden age\r\nwas that in which every one might _pipe_ when and where he pleased.’”\r\n\r\nThe wag, at this instant, gave such a practical illustration of his\r\ntheme, as would have suffocated the major, had not his military habits\r\nrendered him smoke proof.\r\n\r\n“In short, gentlemen,” continued Ned, “a pipe is the solace of my life\r\nand the mainspring of my spirits; knock out my pipe and you knock out\r\nmy brains. I verily believe that, if I could not obtain the ‘furies’\r\nfrankincense,’ as they have been pleased to call tobacco, I should be\r\nlike Vicar Breedon, who, according to William Lilly, cut the bell-ropes\r\nand smoked them.” So saying, he gave another puff, and then removing\r\nthe pipe from his mouth, sang the following ditty:--\r\n\r\n                     “Little tube of magic power,\r\n                     Charmer of an idle hour,\r\n                     Object of my warm desire,\r\n                     Lip of wax, and eye of fire;\r\n                     And thy snowy taper waist,\r\n                     With my finger gently braced.”\r\n                                     &c. &c.\r\n\r\n“Always merry, Ned,” cried Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Lord bless you, sir, what is life but a jest? I jest to live, and I\r\nlive but to jest. And so I shall continue to do, until I am put to bed\r\nby the shovel.”\r\n\r\n“Your father was a reputed jester, was he not?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“He was, God bless his memory! and it was his constant prayer that his\r\nson Neddy might turn out as sharp a man as his father; and if there be\r\nany truth in the adage that ‘dogs bark as they are bred,’ I certainly\r\nhad as good a chance of success as most people. Momus rocked my cradle;\r\nI ate fire before I was seven years old; and so anxiously did my father\r\nsuperintend my education, that he never suffered me to cut a morsel,\r\nuntil I had cut a joke. ‘Neddy,’ he used to say, ‘I perceive you are\r\nlike my bagpipes, never audible except your pouch is full of wind; for\r\nafter a good meal you are as mum as a mouse in a mill; so remember, my\r\nlad, no joke no pudding.’ Thus schooled, I became, through necessity, a\r\nwit, and earned every mouthful by a pun; in short, after a little time,\r\nmy genius illumined every dish, and, like the fire of London, blazed\r\nfrom Pudding Lane to Pie Corner.”\r\n\r\n“And you afterwards appeared on the stage, as a candidate for popular\r\napplause, which you were fortunate enough to obtain; how came you to\r\ndesert your calling?” said the major.\r\n\r\n“He who licks honey from thorns pays too dearly for it,” replied the\r\nwit. “So I packed my wardrobe in a pocket handkerchief, and trudged off\r\nto Cockneyshire.”\r\n\r\n“And what was your object?” asked the major.\r\n\r\n“To carry my wit to a better market; and instead of retailing it at\r\ncountry fairs, to offer it wholesale to some of the great publishers,\r\nfrom whom I immediately received considerable orders. The profit which\r\nrewarded my poetry soon convinced me, notwithstanding all that had been\r\nsaid to the contrary, that there were still some gold mines in\r\nParnassus. I lived for the first week on liquid blacking. I well\r\nremember it was winter, and although I contrived by my eulogies of the\r\njet polish, to obtain a daily meal from a neighbouring chop-house, I\r\nwas compelled to sit in my chamber at night without fire or candle,\r\nuntil the publication of my song, ‘_Ah let my muse a flame inspire_,’\r\nlighted a cheerful blaze in my grate, and enabled me to purchase a few\r\npounds of rush-lights. In short, gentlemen, without exhausting your\r\npatience with a long recital of my adventures, suffice it to say, that\r\nI have always been able to keep my pipe smoking by my _puffs_, my pot\r\nboiling by the ebullition of my wit, and my grate blazing by the _fire_\r\nof my genius; while paste and scissors have never failed to secure a\r\nconstant supply of _cabbage_, upon which I have thrived like any\r\ncaterpillar.”\r\n\r\nHere Hopkins returned to the porch, and took a draught as deep as ever\r\nBitias drank, or the Athenian Diotimus, nicknamed the _Funnel_, ever\r\nswallowed.\r\n\r\n“Did I not say,” resumed the wag, “that my pipe was the nurse of wit? I\r\nought to have called her the _dry_ nurse. It is a hard case, gentlemen,\r\nbut I am in the situation of the flying-fish, incapable of keeping\r\nmyself up, unless I occasionally moisten my wings.”\r\n\r\n“If you persist in this dreadful habit,” said Mr. Seymour, “you will\r\nassuredly destroy the coat of your stomach!”\r\n\r\n“The _coat_ of my stomach!” replied Ned; “if that is all, my stomach\r\nmust even be contented to do what its master has so often done before\r\nit--go in its _waistcoat_, with the understanding that it shall have an\r\nadditional glass to keep it warm. The stomach had better give up its\r\n_coat_ than its master his _habit_.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose I could prove, that by giving up this system, you would\r\nlengthen your days,” observed Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Lengthen my days.--you are quite right, Mr. Seymour; being rather low\r\nin cash, I was compelled to forego my comfort for one whole day, and it\r\nwas the longest day I ever knew in my life; you are quite correct, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You are incorrigible, Ned. But come, what say you to a profitable\r\nengagement?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Why, as to that, sir, I have always a ready mouth for a ripe cherry.”\r\n\r\n“You must know, then, that my friend, Major Snapwell, proposes to give\r\na grand rural fête to the inhabitants of Overton; and, as he intends to\r\nconvert his grounds into a fair upon the occasion, he is desirous of\r\nfinding some person acquainted with comic entertainments, who would\r\nundertake the office of manager, to contract with the necessary\r\nperformers, and superintend all the arrangements.”\r\n\r\n“I am the lad for the major’s silver,” said the delighted wag; “for\r\nwithout vanity, I may say that few persons better understand the art of\r\nmixing up the motley ingredients of fun and frolic; there is, besides,\r\nthat in the major’s face which I would willingly call master.”\r\n\r\n“And were I to judge from your frontispiece,” said the major, “I should\r\nsay that every day in your calendar was a red-lettered one--the\r\npainting of that red nose of yours must have cost a trifle.”\r\n\r\n“Cannot tell; it is not yet finished,” retorted the wit.\r\n\r\nMajor Snapwell, with the assistance of Mr. Seymour, now entered more\r\nfully into the nature and extent of the exhibitions which he wished\r\nHopkins to provide; but as he was, at present, unable to fix the exact\r\nperiod for the fête, he directed him to take such steps only as might\r\nbe necessary for securing the performers, and to hold himself in\r\nreadiness for active service.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  Drake’s Shakspeare and his Times.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  Ovid.

It is a small machine,” continued Mr. Seymour,\r\n“which is well calculated to furnish us with some capital puns.”\r\n\r\n“With puns!” exclaimed the horrified vicar, who no sooner heard this\r\nappalling declaration, than like another Laocoon, he deprecated the\r\nintroduction of the “_donum exitiale_” within the walls of Overton\r\nLodge. But his hostility was soon disarmed, not by the circumvolutions\r\nof a snake around the body of the enraged orator, but by the embraces\r\nof little Rosa, who threw her arms around the neck of the vicar, with\r\nsuch supplicating grace, that at length he exclaimed, “Well, well; if\r\nit be the decree of the Fates, I must submit.”\r\n\r\nDuring this altercation, Mr. Seymour had procured the “wooden engine”\r\nfrom his study.\r\n\r\n“I will first,” said he, “exhibit the toy in its original state, and\r\nthen show you the improvements which have been effected in it.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hear the account of its operation,” said the major, “which I\r\nperceive is enclosed within the box.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Mr. Seymour; “and I think you will agree that I have\r\ngiven a very plausible explanation of its effects.”\r\n\r\n“Plausible,” muttered the vicar, “plausible enough, no doubt; oh the\r\nSinon!”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then proceeded. “This toy is termed the THAUMATROPE.”\r\n\r\n“Of Grecian origin!” observed the vicar. “‘_Timeo Danaos et dona\r\nferentes_,’ as Virgil has it.”\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of the term?” asked Louisa. The vicar explained to\r\nher that it was compounded of the Greek words, θαυηα, and τρεπω; the\r\nformer of which signified _wonder_, the latter _to turn_.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” replied Mr. Seymour. “‘_A Wonder-turner_,’ or a toy which\r\nperforms wonders by turning round: but let me proceed in the\r\nexplanation.” He then continued to read as follows: “This philosophical\r\ntoy is founded upon the well-known optical principle, that an\r\nimpression made on the retina of the eye lasts for a short interval\r\nafter the object which produced it has been withdrawn. During the rapid\r\nwhirling of the card, the figures on each of its sides are presented\r\nwith such quick transition, that they both appear at the same instant,\r\nand thus occasion a very striking and magical effect. On each of these\r\ncards a device is introduced, with an appropriate motto, or epigram;\r\nthe point of which is answered, or explained, by the change which the\r\nfigure assumes during the rapid whirling of the card.”\r\n\r\n“It may be very clever,” said the vicar, “but I do not understand it.”\r\n\r\n“But you shortly will; look at one of the cards.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour then displayed a pasteboard circle, on the one side of\r\nwhich was figured a rat, and on the other, a cage; two strings were\r\nfastened in its axis, by which the card could easily be made to\r\nrevolve, by means of the thumb and finger. Fearing that some of our\r\nreaders may be as dull of comprehension as the vicar, we have\r\nintroduced a sketch of the apparatus, in which both sides of the card\r\nare exhibited, with the strings by which it is whirled round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two circular cards with strings attached, one with an\r\nempty cage and one with a rat.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Mr. Seymour put the card in motion, than the vicar, in a\r\ntone of the greatest surprise, exclaimed, “Magic! magic! I declare the\r\nrat is in the cage!!”\r\n\r\n“And what is the motto?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Why is this rat like an opposition member in the House of Commons, who\r\njoins the ministry?” replied Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha, ha!--excellent!” cried the major, as he read the following\r\nanswer: “because by _turning round_ he gains a snug berth, but ceases\r\nto be free.”\r\n\r\n“The very reverse to what occurred in ancient Rome, where the slave\r\nbecame free by turning round,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\nThe vicar, no doubt, alluded to the custom of making a freeman, as\r\ndescribed by Persius; from which it appears, that the clapping a cap on\r\nthe head, and giving him a turn on the heel, were necessary\r\ncircumstances. A slave thus qualified became a citizen of Rome, and was\r\nhonoured with a name more than belonged to any of his forefathers,\r\nwhich Persius has repeated with a great deal of humour in his 5th\r\nsatire:--\r\n\r\n            “----Heu steriles veri, quibus una Quiritem\r\n             Vertigo facit!”\r\n\r\n            “That false enfranchisement with ease is found;\r\n             Slaves are made citizens by turning round.”\r\n\r\n                                                                 DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n“Show us another card,” said Tom, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Here then is a watch-box; when I turn it round, you will see the\r\nwatchman comfortably sleeping at his post.”\r\n\r\n“Very good! It is very surprising,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” observed the major; “and to carry on your political joke, it may\r\nbe said that, like most worthies who gain a post, by _turning round_,\r\nhe sleeps over his duty.”\r\n\r\n“The epigram which accompanies it is not deficient in point,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour.\r\n\r\n       “The caprice of this watchman surpasses all bound\r\n        He ne’er sits in his box, but when going his _round_\r\n        While he no sooner rests, ’tis a strange paradox!\r\n        Than he flies from his post, and _turns_ out of his box.”\r\n\r\n“What have you there?” exclaimed the vicar; “arms and legs, without a\r\nbody?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Mr. Seymour; “and which, on turning round, will present\r\nthe figure of a king, invested with all the insignia of royalty.”\r\n\r\n“It is indeed a king. Look at his crown and sceptre!” cried Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Now for the epigram,” said the major, who then read the following\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n                  “Head, legs, and arms, alone appear;\r\n                   Observe that _nobody_ is here;\r\n                   Napoleon-like I undertake\r\n                   Of nobody a king to make.”\r\n\r\nThe next card presented a laughing face, which on being turned round,\r\nwas instantly changed into a weeping one. The motto--_The sweetest\r\nthings turn sour_.\r\n\r\n“The device is capital!” exclaimed the vicar, “I question whether Peter\r\nof Cortona ever produced a more striking metamorphosis.”[64]\r\n\r\nThe other cards were now exhibited in succession, of which the box\r\ncontained eighteen, and the whole party, not even excepting the vicar,\r\nwere highly gratified with the amusement.\r\n\r\n“But I have not yet read to you the author’s address to the public; and\r\nwhich, I must say, contains a succession of very happy puns.”\r\n\r\n“Spare me! spare me!” cried the vicar: “I like your toy, but cannot\r\ndiscover the advantage of alloying amusement with such spurious wit,\r\nand of associating science with buffoonery.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour, however, was relentless, and thus proceeded: “It is well\r\nknown that the Laputan philosopher invented a piece of machinery, by\r\nwhich works could be composed by a mechanical operation; and the\r\nQuarterly Review has asserted, that a certain English poem was\r\nfabricated in Paris, by the powers of a steam-engine; but the author of\r\nthe present invention claims for himself the exclusive merit of having\r\nfirst constructed a hand-mill, by which puns and epigrams may be\r\n_turned_ with as much ease as tunes are played on the hand-organ, and\r\nold jokes so _rounded_ and changed, as to assume all the airs of\r\noriginality. The inventor confidently anticipates the favour and\r\npatronage of an enlightened and liberal public, on the well-grounded\r\nassurance, that ‘_one good turn_ deserves another;’ and he trusts that\r\nhis discovery may afford the happy means of giving activity to wit that\r\nhas been long _stationary_; of _revolutionising_ the present system of\r\n_standing_ jokes, and of putting into _rapid circulation_ the most\r\napproved bon-mots.”\r\n\r\n“Why, vicar, what ails thee?” exclaimed the major.\r\n\r\n“Our subject has given him a _turn_; let him alone, and he will soon\r\n_come round_,” observed Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nThe whole party, with the exception of Mr. Twaddleton, laughed\r\nheartily; the vicar, however, did not relax a feature of his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this ebullition had subsided, the major enquired of Mr.\r\nSeymour, what was the nature of the improvement to which he had alluded.\r\n\r\n“My proposed improvements refer both to the subjects exhibited on the\r\ncards, and to the mechanism by which their changes are effected,”\r\nreplied Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“In the first place, it has occurred to me that this amusing toy might\r\nbe made instrumental in impressing classical subjects upon the memory\r\nof young persons.”\r\n\r\nThis observation delighted the vicar, who said that he would patronise\r\nsuch an attempt with all his heart.\r\n\r\n“Why can we not,” continued he, “thus represent the Metamorphoses of\r\nOvid; or what say you, vicar, to converting the fleet of Æneas into\r\nsea-nymphs, as Virgil has it?”\r\n\r\n“An elegant thought! upon my word; a most elegant conception!”\r\nexclaimed Mr. Twaddleton.\r\n\r\n“What have we here?” interrupted the major, who had, for the first\r\ntime, noticed the superscription on the cover of the box: “had I seen\r\nthis before, I should have augured favourably of the toy: it is like\r\nthe sign of an inn, which is held out to announce good entertainment\r\nwithin.” He then read the following:--\r\n\r\n                            The Thaumatrope;\r\n                                 being\r\n                         _Rounds_ of Amusement,\r\n                                   or\r\n                       How to please and surprise\r\n                              By _Turns_.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour now proceeded to explain more fully the optical theory of\r\nthe instrument, which neither Louisa nor Tom could, as yet, thoroughly\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nHe told them that an object was seen by the eye, in consequence of its\r\nimage being delineated on the retina, or optic nerve, which is situated\r\non the back part of the eye; and that it had been ascertained, by\r\nexperiment, that the impression which the mind thus receives, lasts for\r\nabout the eighth part of a second after the image is removed. “It is,\r\ntherefore, sufficiently evident,” said Mr. Seymour, “that if any point,\r\nas a lighted stick, be made to revolve, so as to complete the circle in\r\nthat period, we shall not see a fiery point, but a fiery circle;\r\nbecause the impression made by it in every point of its circuit will\r\nremain until it comes round again to the spot from which it set\r\nout;--but we will, at once, exemplify this fact by an experiment.”\r\n\r\nTom was accordingly directed to procure a piece of stick and a candle;\r\nand as soon as they were brought into the room, Mr. Seymour ignited the\r\nend of the stick and whirled it round, when a bright circle, without\r\nany intervals of darkness, was seen by the whole party.\r\n\r\n“Never until this instant,” exclaimed the vicar, with an expression of\r\nhigh satisfaction, “did I fully appreciate the beauty of that passage\r\nin Milton, wherein the poet evidently describes the rapidity of Satan’s\r\nflight, as well as the refulgence of his appearance--\r\n\r\n                “‘Sprung upward like a pyramid of fire.’\r\n\r\n“Now to take in the full meaning of this figure,” continued Mr.\r\nTwaddleton, “we must imagine ourselves in chaos, and that a vast\r\nluminous body is rising near the spot where we may be supposed to be\r\nstanding, so swiftly as to appear a continued track of light, and\r\nlessening to the view, according to the increase of distance, until it\r\nends in a point, and then disappears; and all this must be supposed to\r\nstrike our eye at one instant.”\r\n\r\n“It is very probable,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the poet had such an\r\nidea in view, and that he intended by it to convey the immense rapidity\r\nof Satan’s flight. Homer makes use of the same figure to express the\r\nvelocity of the javelin, δολιχοσκιον εγχος, the ‘_long shadowed_’\r\njavelin. We shall have ample proof of the effect of this power in the\r\neye of retaining impressions, and of thus converting points into lines\r\nand circles, during the exhibition of your fire-works; and which, in\r\nfact, derive the greater part of their magical effect from it.”\r\n\r\n“The pin wheel is certainly nothing more than a fiery circle produced\r\nby the rapid revolution of a jet of flame,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“And the rocket,” added Mr. Seymour, “is a column of light occasioned\r\nby the same rapid movement of a burning body in a rectilinear or curved\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\n“I perfectly understand all that you have said,” observed Tom.\r\n\r\n“Then you will not have any difficulty in explaining the action of the\r\nThaumatrope, for it depends upon the same optical principle; the\r\nimpression made on the retina by the image, which is delineated on one\r\nside of the card, is not erased before that which is painted on the\r\nopposite side is presented to the eye; and the consequence is, that you\r\nsee both sides at once.”\r\n\r\n“Or, you might put it in this way,” said the major: “that as the image\r\nremains the eighth of a second on the retina, after it has been\r\nwithdrawn from the eye, a revolution of eight times in a second will\r\nsecure its uninterrupted continuance.”\r\n\r\n“On turning round the card,” observed Louisa, “I perceive that every\r\npart of the figure is not equally distinct.”\r\n\r\n“Because every part of the card does not revolve with the same\r\nvelocity,” said her father; “and this fact offers a good illustration\r\nof what I formerly stated,[65] that in circular motion, the parts more\r\nremote from the axis of rotation are those which move with the greater\r\nvelocity. This toy will also be found capable of exemplifying another\r\ntruth to which I have before alluded, that ‘the axis of motion remains\r\nat rest while all the parts revolve round it.’”[66]\r\n\r\n“I remember that very well,” exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\n“Then take the card, and spin it between yourself and the window, and\r\ntell me what you observe,” said his father.\r\n\r\n“I see a dark line across the window; and what is very strange, the\r\nother parts of the card appear transparent; for they do not obstruct\r\nthe view of the window, as they would if the card were at rest.”\r\n\r\n“The dark line you see is the axis of rotation, which being stationary,\r\nnecessarily excludes the light; the other parts being in motion do not\r\nremain a sufficient time to obliterate the image made on the eye by the\r\nwindow. It is true that the card disc passes between your eye and the\r\nlight, but as it does not continue at any one point for more than the\r\neighth of a second, there is no more apparent intermission of the light\r\nthan what occurs during the winking of the eyes.”\r\n\r\n“You allude to a very curious fact,” observed the vicar, “that,\r\nalthough we are perpetually covering the eyeballs with our eyelids, we\r\nare not conscious of the intervals of darkness.”\r\n\r\n“The reason of which must surely be obvious from the explanation I have\r\njust offered,” said Mr. Seymour: “the sensation of light is not\r\nexchanged for that of darkness in so short a period as the twinkling of\r\nthe eye.”\r\n\r\n“I admit the plausibility of your theory,” said the vicar; “but it\r\nappears to me that objects frequently linger on the sight for a longer\r\nperiod than that which you assign to them. I well remember seeing the\r\nflame of a candle for several seconds after it had been suddenly\r\nwithdrawn from the apartment.”\r\n\r\n“I admit that strong lights frequently continue for some time thus\r\nvisible in the ‘mind’s eye;’ and it is well known that such impressions\r\nare often followed by images of similar shape, but of various colours.\r\nIn passing from sunshine to a dark room, we frequently witness the\r\nappearance of stars and circles of vari-coloured light; but this\r\nphenomenon is very distinct from that of the Thaumatrope, and is to be\r\nexplained upon very different principles.”[67]\r\n\r\n“I know exactly to what you allude,” said the major: “and I do not\r\ndoubt but that many of those illusive appearances, which have been\r\ndescribed, might be referred to the operation of the same natural\r\ncause. It is easy to imagine that a person who has steadfastly fixed\r\nhis eyes upon an illuminated object, may, for some minutes afterwards,\r\nsee the same figure in shade; it was from such a cause, no doubt, that\r\nConstantine saw the image of a cross in the sky. You are, probably,\r\nacquainted with the opinions of Eusebius, Fabricius, and Dr. Lardner,\r\nupon this alleged miracle.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” exclaimed the vicar, “and I also know, that this miracle for the\r\nconversion of Constantine gave origin to the Catholic custom of\r\nilluminating the cross at St. Peter’s in Rome.”\r\n\r\n“Sir David Brewster, in his late work on Natural Magic, has given us a\r\nbeautiful illustration of the same principle; it is as follows,” said\r\nMr. Seymour. “A figure dressed in _black_ and mounted upon a _white_\r\nhorse, was riding along exposed to the bright rays of the sun, which\r\nthrough a small opening in the clouds was throwing its light only upon\r\nthat part of the landscape. The _black_ figure was projected against a\r\nwhite cloud, and the white horse shone with particular brilliancy by\r\nits contrast with the dark soil against which it was seen. A person\r\ninterested in the arrival of such a stranger, had been for some time\r\nfollowing his movements with intense anxiety; but upon his\r\ndisappearance behind a wood, was surprised to observe the spectre of\r\nthe mounted stranger in the form of a _white_ rider upon a _black_\r\nsteed, and this spectre was seen for some time in the sky, or upon any\r\npale ground to which the eye was directed.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand why the spectre should be opposite in colour to\r\nthe real image,” observed Tom.\r\n\r\n“It is a law of vision which you must for the present take for\r\ngranted,” answered his father; “that such is the fact, however,”\r\ncontinued he, “I will satisfy you by a very simple experiment.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour here placed three different coloured wafers in a triangular\r\nform on a piece of white paper, and instructed his son to fix his eyes\r\nsteadily upon them for a minute; this having been performed, he next\r\ndirected him to turn them from the wafers to a blank part of the paper,\r\nand to tell him what he saw.\r\n\r\n“I see,” exclaimed Tom, “three spectral wafers, but the colours are\r\ndifferent; the red wafer is represented by a _green_, the violet by a\r\n_yellow_, and the orange by a _blue_.”\r\n\r\n“You now then understand what is meant by the spectral or accidental\r\ncolour of a body:--But let us return to the subject of the\r\nThaumatrope,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Behold!” continued he, “the Trojan ships!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, sure enough,” said the vicar; “but let me see, are their forms\r\naccording to ancient authority? Very well indeed, Mr. Seymour. Very\r\nwell; the poops have the bend so accurately described by Ovid and\r\nVirgil--‘_puppesque recurvæ_,’ as the poet has it. And there is the\r\ntriton; but is its size in proportion to the vessel? Yes, sir, you are\r\ndoubtless correct, the figure is generally represented of considerable\r\nmagnitude on ancient medals; and Silius Italicus, if my memory serves\r\nme, alludes to the weight of the image having on some occasions\r\ncontributed to the wreck of the vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Spin them round,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nThe vicar complied; exclaiming at the same moment, “‘_Vos ite solutæ.\r\nIte deæ pelagi._’ They are positively converted into sea-nymphs.\r\n‘_Mirabile monstrum!_’” cried Mr. Twaddleton.\r\n\r\n“Here is another classical device; the representation of Eurydice, as\r\nshe fell lifeless at the moment Orpheus turned round to gaze on her,”\r\nsaid Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Charming! charming! I perceive that it is a copy from the splendid\r\nprint of Didot in the Paris edition of Virgil.”\r\n\r\n“Turn it round, vicar.”\r\n\r\n“See! see! she revives, she opens her eyes, and throws her arms around\r\nthe neck of her frantic lover: truly, Mr. Seymour, this is a most\r\ninteresting toy,” said Mr. Twaddleton.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour here observed that he had written an epigram to accompany\r\nthe subject they had just witnessed, and he trusted that he had given\r\nto it a classical _turn_.\r\n\r\n“By all means read it; the subject admits of much classical\r\ndecoration,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\nLouisa received the epigram from the hands of her father, and read as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n      “By _turning round_, ’tis said, that Orpheus lost his wife;\r\n      Let him _turn round_ again, and she’ll _return_ to life.”\r\n\r\nIt could not be expected that Mr. Twaddleton should have admired lines\r\nso burdened with puns; but he quietly observed, “I should have\r\npreferred a quotation from the fourth Georgic, so beautifully\r\ndescriptive of the fable.”\r\n\r\nThe next card that was presented for inspection exhibited the\r\nmetamorphosis of Daphne into a laurel. As the figure revolved, the\r\nleaves were seen sprouting from her fingers, and her arms lengthening\r\ninto branches.\r\n\r\n“Come now,” said Mr. Seymour, “let us exhibit the figure which has been\r\ndesigned at my request: the change which it will undergo during its\r\nrevolution may, I trust, on some day be realised; I only regret that it\r\nis not in my power to give the vicar so good a _turn_.”\r\n\r\n“Really, if like Crambe, in Martinus Scriblerus, thou hadst a word for\r\nevery day in the year, I should certainly say that you were this day\r\nunder the dominion of the word _turn_.”\r\n\r\n“You know this resemblance?” said Mr. Seymour, as he showed the figure,\r\npainted on one side of the card, to his daughter.\r\n\r\n“It is the vicar!” exclaimed Louisa.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a portrait of that most excellent character,\r\nrepresented in the costume in which he usually appeared.\r\n\r\n“Turn it round,” said Mrs. Seymour.\r\n\r\nLouisa twirled the cord, and the effect of the rotation was to convert\r\nthe humble vicar into the dignified bishop; his meagre form was\r\ninstantly changed into a corpulent figure, which was still farther\r\ninflated by the addition of the episcopal robe and lawn sleeves, while\r\nhis angular features were softened by the graceful curves of an immense\r\nwig.\r\n\r\n“I will give you a motto for it,” said the major, “and may it be\r\nprophetic!--RAPID PREFERMENT.”\r\n\r\n“I will now show you the improvement which has been effected in the\r\nconstruction and use of this toy,” said Mr. Seymour. “It consists in\r\naltering the axis of rotation while the card is in the act of\r\nrevolving, in order that the images on its opposite sides may be\r\nbrought in different positions with respect to each other.”\r\n\r\n“There cannot be any doubt that such would be the effect, were it\r\npossible to change the axis in the way you propose, but how is this to\r\nbe effected?” asked the vicar.\r\n\r\n“At first I attempted to produce the change by the addition of several\r\nother strings, but I soon found, that, in order to avail myself of this\r\nexpedient, I should be obliged to stop the card before I could alter\r\nthe axis, whereas my great object, as I have just stated, was to\r\nproduce the change while the card was in the act of spinning,” answered\r\nMr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“And I shrewdly suspect that such must necessarily be the case, adopt\r\nwhatever expedient you may,” observed the major.\r\n\r\n“No indeed; I have at length succeeded to my entire satisfaction, and\r\nthat too by a most simple scheme, after having tried without success\r\nmany very complicated contrivances.”\r\n\r\nThe party were very desirous of witnessing this triumph of skill, and\r\nMr. Seymour produced the card, with its appendages, of which we shall\r\nhere present our readers with an engraving:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Circular card with bottle and another with man’s\r\ntorso.]\r\n\r\nIn all respects the card is constructed like the common Thaumatrope;\r\nthe subject, it will be perceived, is that of a man drinking, the\r\nbottle being placed on one side, and the head on the other; upon\r\nrevolving the card, in the ordinary manner, the two images will appear\r\ntogether as represented in:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Man with bottle halfway to his mouth.]\r\n\r\nThe improvement consists in inserting in one, or, if a still greater\r\nchange be desired, in both sides of the card, two strings, as seen in\r\nFig. 1; viz. A D and A E, which united at A, form a common string for\r\ntwirling the card. The cord A D is elastic, while the string A E is\r\nincapable of being stretched. If, therefore, while the card is in the\r\nact of spinning, the cord A D be pulled with an increased force, it\r\nwill take the position D C, while the inelastic string A E will at the\r\nsame time assume that of E C. The consequence of which will be that,\r\ninstead of the card spinning on an axis in the direction A B, it will\r\nnow spin on that which is in the direction C B, and we shall\r\naccordingly see the images on the opposite sides of the card in\r\ndifferent positions, with respect to each other; at one moment the\r\nbottle will be seen in the hand of the drinker as represented in\r\nFig. 2, and in the next, at his mouth as shown in the cut below:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Man with bottle at his mouth.]\r\n\r\nwhile, by alternately tightening and relaxing the string, the figure\r\nwill be seen in the very act of raising and lowering the bottle.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour having explained the principle of his improvement as we\r\nhave above related, proceeded to exemplify it by a series of different\r\nsubjects. We shall select two or three of them for the sake of\r\nillustration. A card with a jockey on one side and a horse on the\r\nother, on spinning round presented the combined figure; upon tightening\r\nthe string, in the manner we have described, the card changed its axis,\r\nwithout the slightest halt or hesitation in its rotation, and the rider\r\nwas in an instant canted over the head of his charger; in a moment,\r\nhowever, he appeared remounted; after which, by pulling the string,\r\nwith different degrees of force, he was made to stand on the saddle,\r\nand to exhibit a number of different movements.\r\n\r\nThe figure of an Indian juggler was represented in the act of throwing\r\nup _two_ balls; on spinning the card, and, at the same time, altering\r\nthe position of the circle, in the manner already described, _three_,\r\nand afterwards _four_, became visible. When the card revolved upon its\r\noriginal axis, two of the balls on the reverse side coincided with the\r\ntwo painted on the front, so that during the revolution they fell upon\r\nthe same spot on the retina, and therefore produced a single\r\nimpression; but as soon as the position of the card was changed, these\r\nspots were brought upon different points, and consequently produced\r\nseparate and independent images. By alternately tightening and relaxing\r\nthe strings, the balls were seen in motion, arising from and falling\r\ninto the hand of the juggler.\r\n\r\nThe next subject which we shall describe produced a considerable degree\r\nof merriment. The vicar inspected the drawing, and observed that he saw\r\na pulpit placed on the banks of a pond; the card was made to spin, when\r\na tailor was seen haranguing from the former, and a goose, at the same\r\ninstant, fluttering over the water. The circle was now suddenly\r\nshifted, and the vicar was desired to state what he saw:--“Why, bless\r\nme!” exclaimed Mr. Twaddleton, “the tailor is justly served, he is\r\nducked in the pond, while the goose has taken his place in the pulpit.”\r\n\r\nFearing that we may have exhausted the patience of our reader, we shall\r\nonly relate one more example. It was a Turk, who, by means of the\r\nexpedient we are illustrating, was made to draw his sabre, and cut off\r\nthe head of his antagonist, which immediately fell into the hands of\r\nthe decapitated person, who, like St. Denys, appeared as if walking off\r\nwith perfect indifference.\r\n\r\n“You must admit that these effects are no less novel than they are\r\nextraordinary, and that they are capable of almost endless variation,”\r\nsaid Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“I admit it all,” replied Mr. Twaddleton, “and I have only to express a\r\nhope that, amidst all your improvements, you will never lose sight of\r\nyour first and most laudable design, that of rendering your toy\r\nsubservient to classical illustration: your triumph will then be\r\ncomplete, and I shall willingly acknowledge that there is not only\r\nphilosophy but literature in your sport.”\r\n\r\n“I must not quit this subject,” said Mr. Seymour, “until I have\r\nexhibited another toy, which, like the Thaumatrope, is indebted for its\r\neffect to the optical principle, which I trust is now well understood\r\nby all present, viz. that _an impression made on the retina lasts for a\r\ncertain period after the object itself has been withdrawn_.”\r\n\r\nThe annexed wood-cut represents the instrument to which Mr. Seymour\r\nalluded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A blackened tin plate with slit, mounted on stand, in\r\nview A; the image of a star as seen, in view B.] It consists of a disc\r\nof blackened tin plate, which is made to revolve on its axis in the\r\nmanner above exhibited. A narrow opening extends from the circumference\r\nto the centre as seen at A. If a device of any kind, as a star (which\r\nfor increasing the beauty of the experiment ought to be transparent,\r\nand illuminated with a lamp) be placed behind the disc, it is evident\r\nthat, as long as the circle remains at rest, no other part of the\r\nfigure can be visible than that which is immediately behind the slit A,\r\nbut the instant it is put into rapid motion, the whole of the star will\r\nbe seen, as exhibited in figure B.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour observed that the explanation of the phenomenon was\r\nobvious;--each successive portion of the figure seen through the\r\nopening remains on the eye, until the circle has completed its entire\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n“This experiment,” continued Mr. Seymour, “admits of a very curious\r\nmodification, which I shall now proceed to exhibit.”\r\n\r\nThree coloured wafers were then placed, at equal distances from each\r\nother, on the disc, and the instrument having been arranged before a\r\nlooking-glass, the party were desired to observe the reflected image as\r\nthe circle revolved.\r\n\r\n“The wafers are blended into one continuous zone,” observed Mrs.\r\nSeymour.\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” said Louisa; “upon the same principle that the ignited\r\nstick appears as a fiery circle.”\r\n\r\n“It would be very strange, after the different experiments we have\r\nseen, if we were not able to explain the present appearance,” observed\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n“The fiery circle produced by the revolving stick is a much better\r\nillustration of the principle; I do not see what object Mr. Seymour has\r\nin thus multiplying his experiments,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Gently, if you please, Mr. Twaddleton, and, before you favour us with\r\nyour criticism, wait until I have concluded my experiment. You have\r\nseen that the reflected image of the revolving wafers appears as a\r\ncontinuous zone, and you have very correctly explained the reason of\r\nsuch an appearance; but I must now request you to inspect the reflected\r\nimage through the slit in the disc, as it revolves, and say what new\r\neffect you observe.”\r\n\r\n“How very strange!” exclaimed Tom; “I see the three wafers very\r\ndistinctly, and perfectly at rest.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” exclaimed the vicar--“let me have a peep. Why, I declare,\r\nthey appear, as you say, stationary, although I know them to be in\r\nrapid motion; as sure as fate I shall become a Cartesian.”\r\n\r\nThe Major, Louisa, and Mrs. Seymour, were all equally surprised, and\r\nincapable of giving any explanation of the phenomenon they had\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\n“Let us remember,” said Mr. Seymour, “that in viewing the image through\r\nthe slit in the revolving disc, we catch but a momentary glance as it\r\npasses before the eye, and that the image thus produced on the retina\r\nis retained until the next revolution again brings the slit into the\r\nsame position. Now it is evident, that before the eye can ascertain a\r\nbody to be in motion, it must observe it in two successive portions of\r\ntime, in order to compare its change of place;[68] but in the\r\nexperiment under consideration, the glance is momentary, the wafer is\r\nno sooner seen than it passes away; its figure alone is impressed upon\r\nthe retina, and this impression is continued without any change, until\r\nthe circle completes its round, and consequently the image must appear\r\nat rest.”\r\n\r\n“I understand you; the figure, but not the motion, of the wafer, is\r\ndiscernible in the short period during which it is visible through the\r\nslit,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\n“I lately witnessed a beautiful illustration of this subject at the\r\nRoyal Institution,” said Mr. Seymour. “A number of cogged wheels, cut\r\nout of pasteboard, were set in motion in a perfectly dark room, when\r\noccasional flashes of light from an electric battery, displayed their\r\nforms most distinctly, and yet although whirling round at the time,\r\nthey appeared to the spectator as motionless as so many solid blocks of\r\nmarble. In like manner, in a storm during the darkness of midnight, the\r\nrolling ship and waves, when rendered visible by flashes of lightning,\r\nwill appear as completely at rest, as a representation of them upon the\r\ncanvass.[68a] I may at some future time extend this interesting\r\nsubject, by exhibiting some optical illusions produced by the\r\nrevolution of wheels in different directions, and at different\r\nvelocities, for the knowledge[69] of which we are indebted to Mr.\r\nFaraday, and in mentioning that distinguished philosopher,” added Mr.\r\nSeymour, addressing himself more particularly to the vicar, “I cannot\r\navoid remarking, that if _Philosophy in Sport_ can be made _Science in\r\nEarnest_, the juvenile lectures delivered by that professor have\r\nestablished the converse proposition, that the sternness of Science may\r\nbe relaxed into the engaging aspect of Sport.”\r\n\r\n“Before quitting this subject,” continued he, “I have yet another toy\r\nin store for your amusement; it is founded upon the optical principle\r\nwhich I have every reason to believe you now thoroughly understand.” A\r\nsquare box was then produced containing a number of card discs, the\r\nedges of which exhibited a series of notches corresponding with the\r\nfigures delineated on their margins. That the reader may better\r\nunderstand their construction, as well as the explanation of Mr.\r\nSeymour, the following representation has been introduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: As explained above. Figure is a dark-skinned man jumping\r\nin the air.]\r\n\r\n“To exhibit the magical effects of this toy,” said Mr. Seymour, “I\r\nwill, by means of the spindle to which it is attached, cause it to\r\nrevolve rapidly before the looking-glass, and you shall view the\r\nreflection through the openings.”\r\n\r\nEach member of the party obeyed in succession the direction thus given,\r\nand severally expressed the great astonishment they felt, at observing\r\nthe figures in constant motion, and exhibiting the most grotesque\r\nattitudes.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Mr. Seymour, “attend to my explanation. Each figure is seen\r\nthrough the aperture, and as it passes and is succeeded in rapid\r\nsuccession by another and another, differing from the former only in\r\nattitude, the eye is cheated into the belief of its being the same\r\nobject successively changing the position of its body. Consider what\r\ntakes place in an image on the retina when we actually witness a man in\r\nmotion; for instance, a man jumping over a gate, in the first moment he\r\nappears on the ground, in the next his legs are a few inches above it,\r\nin the third they are nearly on a level with the rail, in the fourth he\r\nis above it, and then in the successive moments he is seen descending\r\nas he had previously risen. A precisely similar effect is produced on\r\nthe retina, by the successive substitution of figures in corresponding\r\nattitudes, as seen through the orifices of the revolving disc; each\r\nfigure remaining on the retina long enough to allow its successor to\r\ntake its place without an interval that would destroy the illusion.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be more satisfactory than your explanation of this very\r\nextraordinary toy,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\n“I am now about to exhibit what I consider a great improvement in its\r\nconstruction, inasmuch as we thus get rid of the mirror, and enable two\r\npersons to witness the deception at the same time,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n“For this purpose I have a spindle, at each end of which a disc is\r\nplaced, and which I hold in my hand.” We deem it expedient to\r\nillustrate this arrangement by a wood-cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two-sided phantasmascope.]\r\n\r\n“By revolving the spindle, you perceive that both cards are made to\r\nturn round with equal velocity. Tom,” said his father, “look through\r\nthe orifices of the disc, on my right hand, and Louisa, do the same on\r\nmy left.” The children obeyed, and simultaneously expressed their\r\nwonder at what they witnessed. “The figures are all dancing!” cried\r\nTom; “The horses are all prancing!” exclaimed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“You have not yet told us the name of this toy,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\n“It has received several names,” answered Mr. Seymour, “as\r\n_Phantasmascope_, _Phenakistiscope_, &c. derived, as you no doubt\r\nperceive, from the Greek.”\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to observe, that the appearances thus produced\r\nmay be infinitely varied--heads opening their mouths, and distorting\r\ntheir countenances; creeping serpents, and machinery in active\r\noperation, are amongst the subjects that have excited the greatest\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nThe party now dispersed, not less gratified than they had been\r\ninstructed by the lesson of the morning.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mighty magician of the North has compared the course of a narrative\r\nto the progress of a stone rolled down hill by an idle truant boy,\r\n“which at first moveth slowly, avoiding by inflection every obstacle of\r\nthe least importance; but when it has attained its full impulse, and\r\ndraws near the conclusion of its career, it smokes and thunders down,\r\nmaking a rood at every spring, clearing hedge and ditch like a\r\nYorkshire huntsman, and becoming most furiously rapid in its course\r\nwhen it is nearest to being consigned to rest for ever: even such,”\r\nsays he, “is the course of a narrative; the earlier events are\r\nstudiously dwelt upon; but when the story draws near its close, we\r\nhurry over the circumstances, however important, which your imagination\r\nmust have forestalled, and leave you to suppose those things which it\r\nwould be abusing your patience to relate at length.”\r\n\r\nLet the reader of the present work accept this explanation, as an\r\napology for the abrupt and rapid manner in which we shall now\r\naccelerate our narrative. Since the last lecture, our history has\r\nadvanced nearly three weeks, during which interval the major had made\r\nevery arrangement for the approaching marriage. It was finally agreed\r\nthat the ceremony should be performed at Overton church; and as the\r\n“happy couple” expressed a wish to pass their “honey moon” in a retired\r\npart of Yorkshire, the major consented to postpone his fête until after\r\ntheir return; nor was he displeased at such an arrangement, as it\r\nafforded time for getting up his entertainment on a more liberal scale\r\nthan could otherwise have been accomplished. We shall now avail\r\nourselves of that peculiar Lethean property which has been often\r\nascribed to the pen of the author, and commit the reader to the arms of\r\nMorpheus, where it is our intention that he shall remain until the\r\nmorning of the nuptials.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReader, awake! the sun has risen, and Nature is robing herself in her\r\nmost gorgeous apparel for the approaching ceremony; the family of the\r\nlodge have been already roused from their slumbers by the attendance of\r\nminstrels, whom the vicar had directed to salute the bridal party at\r\nbreak of day.----But hark! while we are thus trifling, the village of\r\nOverton is in a bustle; the marriage ceremony is over; the bells of the\r\nchurch are ringing right merrily their festive peals; many a\r\nhandkerchief is waving from the cottage windows, while the doors are\r\ndecorated with garlands; the vicarage is ornamented with fragments of\r\nVenetian tapestry; the peasants, dressed in their holiday garments, are\r\ncarrying nosegays in their hands, to present to the bride as an\r\noffering of their respect, or to strew in her path, as an emblematic\r\nexpression of their wishes.\r\n\r\nThe party having reached Osterley Park, we were proceeding to\r\ndescribe the banquet which had been prepared, and the various devices\r\nand emblems with which it had been decorated, under the classical\r\ndirection of the vicar, when alas! our publishers, like the harpies\r\nof old, unexpectedly pounced upon us, and warned us from the\r\nfeast--“_diripiuntque dapes_,” as Virgil has it.\r\n\r\n“You have already exceeded the prescribed limits--you must close the\r\nscene--remember that you have engaged to condense the work into one\r\nvolume,” said they. We remonstrate, but in vain. We request but a few\r\npages, in order that we may give our characters a dramatic exit; but\r\nthey reply to us in the words of Sneer, in the Critic, “O never mind!\r\nso as you get them off the stage, I’ll answer for it the _reader_ won’t\r\ncare how.”\r\n\r\nYou see then, gentle reader, how vain it would be to struggle against\r\nsuch arbitrary and tasteless masters; we shall, therefore, without any\r\nfarther apology, ring the manager’s bell, and drop the curtain.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  The Cartesians maintained that the senses were the great sources of\r\n  deception; that everything with which they present us ought to be\r\n  suspected as false, or at least dubious, until our reason has\r\n  confirmed the report.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Ferdinand, Duke of Tuscany, was once struck with the picture of a\r\n  child crying; the artist (Peter of Cortona), who was at work upon the\r\n  head, wishing to give a proof of his skill, by a few judicious\r\n  touches converted the crying into a laughing face. The Duke was in\r\n  astonishment; the painter, to show himself master of the human\r\n  countenance, restored his first touches, and the Duke again saw the\r\n  child weeping.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  Page 161.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  Page 49.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  Those who are desirous of gaining farther information upon this\r\n  subject may consult the chapter on “Ocular Spectra, or Accidental\r\n  colours,” in Brewster’s Natural Magic, p. 21; and Edinburgh\r\n  Encyclopædia, Art.

The various show-booths had been erected by their\r\nrespective owners with an expedition that might have put many a prouder\r\narchitect to shame; the marquees and the temporary rooms had been\r\ncompleted under the management of Tom Plank; and for those, whose\r\nappetite might hold precedence of the senses of sight and hearing,\r\nample funds of gratification had been provided by the accomplished\r\nhostess of the “Bag of Nails,” whose grim troop of kettles and\r\nstew-pans had, during the whole of the week, been chirping and\r\nchuckling over the kitchen range, the very cheeks of which had cracked\r\nfrom yawning. The major now anxiously awaited the arrival of every\r\npost, in expectation of a letter that might announce the day upon which\r\nHenry Beacham and his bride would return to Osterley Park. At length\r\nthe long anticipated intelligence was received, that they might be\r\nexpected at Overton by four o’clock on the day after the morrow. The\r\nvicar was immediately summoned to a council, and on his arrival,\r\nretired with the major for the purpose of consulting the chronicles of\r\nHolinshed and Froissart, touching certain points of ceremonial that\r\nmight guide them in their arrangements for receiving the bride. The\r\nvicar pleaded in favour of the forms that were observed on the occasion\r\nof the public entrance of Queen Isabella into the city of Paris, but\r\nthe major objected to the plan, on account of the pageant representing\r\nthe siege of Troy; a point upon which the vicar, as may be readily\r\nimagined, most pertinaciously insisted; so that the gentlemen separated\r\nwithout having arrived at any satisfactory conclusion upon the subject,\r\nand the question was transferred to another jurisdiction. No sooner had\r\nit become known that Mr. and Mrs. Beacham were shortly to arrive, than\r\nthe more respectable yeomen of the parish assembled at the village inn,\r\nto concert a plan for receiving them with all due honour, when it was\r\nfinally arranged, that the village should be decorated with garlands,\r\nand the May-pole erected on the spot, where its gaudy streamers had for\r\nso many ages annually floated on the breeze of spring. It was farther\r\nresolved, that every person who could furnish himself with a horse,\r\nshould attend at a certain spot by the hour of three, in order to\r\nadvance in procession, and escort the happy couple through Overton to\r\nOsterley Park. The major, upon receiving these resolutions, issued such\r\norders as might be necessary for carrying them into effect; he also\r\nsignified his desire, that those musicians who had lately arrived for\r\nthe impending festivities should be in attendance at the place and hour\r\nthat had been fixed upon. The friends of Major Snapwell had already\r\narrived at the Park; and Overton Lodge was overflowing with visitors.\r\nTom had also joined his family circle.\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock on the appointed day, twenty signal guns were\r\ndischarged from the Park--the village bells struck up a festive\r\npeal--the flag was hoisted on the spire of the church; and upwards of\r\nforty respectable yeomen, farmers, and tenants, mounted on their horses\r\nand decorated with ribands and flowers, had assembled as an escort.\r\n\r\nThe church clock chimed the quarter past three, as the carriages of\r\nMajor Snapwell and Mr. Seymour, and those of their guests, drawn by\r\nhighly decorated horses, entered the village; the peasants immediately\r\ndrew back, so as to form an avenue through which the party might pass,\r\nwhile shouts of gladness rent the air. Each horseman had provided a\r\nlarge bough of oak or elm, so that the cavalcade in motion appeared\r\nlike a moving grove, and reminded Mrs. Seymour of the advance of\r\n“Birnam Wood to Dunsinane.” The carriages, preceded by a band of music,\r\noccupied the van of the procession; then came about fifty village\r\nmaidens, each carrying in her hand a basket of flowers; next followed\r\nthe horsemen; and the procession was closed by a dense group of\r\npeasants, who had come from all the country round. The vicar appeared\r\non horseback, bustling in all directions, now conversing with the\r\nmajor, now with Mr. Seymour; at one time moderating the pace of the\r\nhorsemen, and at another, keeping back the pedestrians, whose eagerness\r\nto push forward created an inconvenient crowd in the foremost ranks.\r\nMr. Twaddleton held in his right hand a wand decorated with ivy leaves,\r\nand which resembled in appearance the thyrsus of Bacchus, except that\r\nthe cone on its summit had been replaced by a bunch of roses. This was\r\na classical conceit; and he fully explained to the major the reason of\r\nhis having adopted such a device for his wand of office.\r\n\r\n“The rose,” said he, “was dedicated by Cupid to Harpocrates, the god of\r\nsilence, to engage him to conceal the secrets of Venus; hence has this\r\nflower ever since been considered as the symbol of silence; for which\r\nreason it was customary to hang a rose over the banqueting-table, to\r\nsignify that what was there spoken should be kept private, or ‘under\r\nthe rose;’ whence, also, to present, or hold up, this flower to any\r\nperson in discourse served, instead of an admonition, to intimate that\r\nit was time for such person to hold his peace. In like manner,”\r\ncontinued the antiquary, “you will observe that, by virtue of my wand,\r\nI shall impress the obligation of silence upon the crowd, and easily\r\ncalm any undue clamour that may arise.”\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade had advanced little more than half a mile, when the major\r\nsuggested the propriety of halting, until his nephew and niece should\r\narrive; to this proposition the vicar readily acceded, and accordingly\r\nissued the necessary orders.\r\n\r\nThey had not, however, remained stationary above five minutes, when a\r\ncarriage and four were seen at the brow of the hill, advancing in full\r\nspeed. A general and simultaneous shout burst from the crowd; upon\r\nwhich the vicar raised his wand, and all was hushed. How far such an\r\neffect might be attributed to the influence of his wand, we shall leave\r\nthe sagacious reader to determine; but the party smiled at so striking\r\nan instance of classical credulity; and Mr. Twaddleton, highly\r\ngratified by his triumph, rode forward to the chariot, which was not\r\nmore than two hundred yards distant. It contained Mr. and Mrs. Beacham,\r\nwhom the vicar no sooner perceived, than he again raised his wand, and\r\nagain witnessed the influence of its spell. The chariot instantly\r\nstopped, and, in the next moment, Mr. Twaddleton was seen in earnest\r\nconversation with the travellers. He informed them that the group they\r\nsaw was a cavalcade of villagers, who had been awaiting their arrival\r\non the road, in order to escort them in rural triumph to Osterley Park.\r\nHe then presented Mr. Beacham with a bag of nuts, “that the\r\nbridegroom,” as he said, “might be enabled to comply with the ancient\r\nRoman custom[70] of throwing nuts amongst the boys to be scrambled\r\nfor;--_sparge, marite, nuces_, as Virgil has it;--_da nuces pueris_, as\r\nCatullus sings.” Mr. Beacham held the vicar in too much respect to\r\nlaugh at his eccentricities, and he therefore accepted the bag, with a\r\ndetermination to gratify his wishes in so harmless a whim.\r\n\r\nJerry Styles was now directed to forward the two messengers to Osterley\r\nPark; and he accordingly opened a basket, from which flew two carrier\r\npigeons, who immediately soared into the air, and having attained their\r\ngreatest altitude, and remained apparently stationary for a few\r\nseconds, darted off in the direction of Osterley Park; every eye was\r\nsteadfastly fixed upon the bird [sic]; and a murmur of satisfaction and\r\nwonder ran through the ranks, as the sagacious animals lessened in the\r\ndistance.(52)\r\n\r\nThe musicians struck up a grand march;--the whole cavalcade was in\r\nmotion. Mr. Beacham’s chariot having been drawn on one side of the\r\nroad, the carriages and horsemen proceeded to take their stations in\r\nthe rear; the company in the former kissing their hands, and waving\r\ntheir handkerchiefs, while the latter lowered their branches, and\r\ncheered, as they passed.\r\n\r\nThe damsels, in advance of Mr. Beacham’s carriage, opened their\r\nbaskets, and strewed the road with flowers as they moved forward.\r\n\r\n“Hark!” exclaimed the major: “the pigeons have arrived at the park, and\r\nmy orders have been faithfully obeyed: they are firing a salute.”\r\n\r\n“And it has been heard at the village,” said the vicar; “for the bells\r\nhave just commenced their peal of welcome.” But we are exhausting the\r\npatience of our readers with the details of a ceremony, in which it is\r\nvery probable they may feel but little interest; although we freely\r\nconfess that, to ourselves, few pageants have such attractive charms as\r\nthose innocent and simple manifestations of genuine feeling which are\r\nto be met with in rural life, where the heart has not yet been chilled\r\nby that benumbing influence of what has been termed “the progress of\r\ncivilisation;” and which has exchanged the free and warm impulses of\r\nour nature for cold and studied forms, or for an artful display of\r\nfactitious sentiment.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the procession through the village, Mr. Beacham\r\nhad not been unmindful of the vicar’s request; he poured a shower of\r\nnuts amongst the boys, which occasioned much frolic, and good-humoured\r\ncontention; while the peasants caught and cracked them, without any\r\nsuspicion of the Roman custom they were assisting to perpetuate.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at Osterley Park, the horsemen formed a double line,\r\nthrough which the several carriages passed. The gates were then closed;\r\nand the vicar, stepping forward, thus addressed the assembled\r\nmultitude:--\r\n\r\n“Well-beloved friends and parishioners, I am desired by Major Snapwell\r\nto inform you that refreshments have been prepared in the village, of\r\nwhich you may all partake on your return. Your admission into the park\r\nthis evening would interfere with those arrangements which are in\r\nprogress for to-morrow’s jubilee: let me, therefore, request that you\r\nwill all retire peaceably.”\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this intimation, the whole assembly,\r\n\r\n         “With tongues all loudness, and with eyes all mirth,”\r\n\r\nafter having given three hearty cheers, retired to the village, where\r\nseveral barrels of beer had been disposed in readiness for the libation.\r\n\r\nThe vicar, having completed his harangue, rejoined the party at the\r\npark, where its hospitable owner had prepared a sumptuous dinner. It\r\nwas, however, proposed that the vicar, with the major, and such of his\r\nguests as wished to inspect the preparations, should previously walk\r\nround the grounds. Tom and his sisters begged that they might be\r\nincluded in the party; a request which their father readily granted, as\r\nhe said that some opportunity might occur for explaining the nature of\r\nthose exhibitions which they were to witness on the following day. The\r\nsame feeling induced Mr. and Mrs. Beacham and several other visitors to\r\njoin the party, hoping that they also might profit from the discourse\r\nwhich Mr. Seymour intended to hold for the instruction of his children.\r\nThe reader will probably be induced, for similar reasons, to accompany\r\nthem. If he has attentively read the preceding pages of this work, we\r\nhope he has become convinced that the lessons of youth may occasionally\r\nconvey instruction as well as amusement to those of riper years.\r\n\r\nNed Hopkins having been summoned to attend the party, and receive the\r\nfinal orders of the vicar, they proceeded to the elm-meadow, where the\r\ngrand fair was to be held, and in which were disposed a long line of\r\nbooths for the motley exhibitions to which they were dedicated.\r\n\r\n“What have we here?” exclaimed the major, as he entered the meadow; “a\r\nrow of poles!”\r\n\r\n“Ned Hopkins,” cried the vicar, “how has it happened that the ropes\r\nhave not been affixed to these poles? Have I not said that every\r\narrangement must be completed this evening? Those poles,” continued the\r\nvicar, addressing himself to Major Snapwell, “are intended for swings,\r\nfrom which the younger peasants will, doubtless, derive much amusement,\r\nwhile their sires are engaged, in the adjoining field, by the more\r\nmanly exercises of quoits, foot-racing, wrestling, hurling, &c. You\r\nare, of course, aware, gentlemen, that in admitting the swing amongst\r\nthe pastimes of the day, I have the support of classical authority: its\r\norigin may be traced to the Icarian games, the celebration of which\r\nconsisted in persons balancing themselves on cords attached to two\r\ntrees; or in other words, in swinging. They were instituted in\r\ncommemoration of the death of Erigone, who no sooner discovered the\r\nmurder of her father Icarus, than she piously hung herself at his tomb.”\r\n\r\n“It is certainly very curious,” said the major, “to observe how\r\nfrequently a popular ceremony or custom has survived the tradition of\r\nits origin; it is thus, for instance, that the fond mother still\r\nsuspends the coral toy around the neck of her infant, without being in\r\nthe least aware of the superstitious belief from which the custom\r\nsprang (53); and I have little doubt but that we shall to-morrow hear\r\nthe chorus of ‘Derry-down’ re-echoed by those who probably never heard\r\nof the Druids, and much less of the choral hymns with which their\r\ngroves resounded, at the time of gathering the misletoe.”\r\n\r\n“You need not go so far back as the Druids,” said Mr. Seymour; “does\r\nnot the housewife place the poker across the grate to draw up the fire,\r\nwithout ever suspecting that the custom originated from the\r\nsuperstitious belief that, by thus forming a cross with the bars, the\r\nfire was protected from the malignant influence of witches?--But let us\r\nproceed; for what has yonder stage been erected?”\r\n\r\n“That is the _hoistings_, sir,” exclaimed Ned Hopkins, “from which\r\nGiles Gingerly, the celebrated American merry-andrew, will exhibit his\r\nbuffoonery, and vend his nostrums.”\r\n\r\n“Hoistings! why, Ned, you pronounce the word as though your mouth were\r\nfilled with hot pudding,” said the major.\r\n\r\n“I ask your pardon, sir,” replied Ned; “but my father would never\r\nsuffer me to pronounce it in any other manner; for he always maintained\r\nthat _hustings_ was a corruption for _hoistings_, it being a stage upon\r\nwhich the actor is _hoisted_ or elevated above the surrounding crowd.”\r\n\r\n“I believe he is right,” muttered the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Papa,” said Tom, “pray tell me what is a merry-andrew.”\r\n\r\n“Ask the vicar,” replied his father.\r\n\r\n“The mountebank, who united the professions of joculator and physician,\r\nwas of ancient date, and during the two last centuries has figured away\r\nwith considerable success. He usually appears on a temporary stage, and\r\nprefaces the vending of his nostrums with a pompous harangue; and, the\r\nbetter to attract the notice of the gaping spectators, he displays some\r\nof the performances practised by the jugglers, while his inseparable\r\ncompanion, the _bourdour_, exhibits numerous tricks, and puts the\r\npopulace in good humour by wit and raillery. The medical fraternity,\r\nknown in England by the name of _Merry-andrews_, and who are the\r\ncompanions of the mountebank, derived their foundation from Dr. Andrew\r\nBoorde, who lived in the reigns of Henry VIII. Edward VI. and Queen\r\nMary, and was constantly in the habit of frequenting fairs and markets,\r\nat which he harangued the populace: his speeches were extremely\r\nhumorous, and occasioned considerable mirth; but, notwithstanding the\r\ninfallibility of his nostrums, like Paracelsus, he died with a bottle\r\nof his elixir in his pocket. His successors in the same line naturally\r\nendeavoured to emulate the humour of their master, and hence this whole\r\nclass of vagabond tinkers of flesh and bone acquired the generic\r\nappellation of ‘_Merry-andrews_’.”\r\n\r\n“And pray what are _nostrums_?” asked Louisa.\r\n\r\n“‘_Nostrum_,’ my dear, signifies _our own_, and is applied to any\r\nmedicine which is prepared by a secret process, and sold for the\r\nprivate advantage of an individual; but, since secrecy is never used on\r\nsuch occasions except as a cloak for imposture, the word very generally\r\nconveys an expression of ridicule or contempt.”\r\n\r\nThe company proceeded in their inspection.\r\n\r\n“What have we there, Ned Hopkins?” said Mr. Seymour, as he pointed to a\r\nbooth of larger dimensions than those which surrounded it.\r\n\r\n“In that booth, ‘the Emperor of all the Conjurors’ will perform his\r\nwonderful art of ‘sleight-of-hand,’” replied Ned.--“Look at his card of\r\ninvitation,” continued the wag--“☞ WALK IN--WALK IN--LADIES AND\r\nGENTLEMEN. HERE ARE MIRACLES IN ANY QUANTITY TO BE SEEN FOR TWO-PENCE,\r\nAND BELIEVED IN FOR NOTHING!!!”\r\n\r\n“A lineal descendant of the _Tragetour_ of the fourteenth century,”\r\nobserved the vicar; “a class of artists who, with the assistance of\r\ndexterity of execution, and various kinds of machinery, deceived the\r\neyes of the spectators, and produced such illusions as were usually\r\nsupposed to be the effect of enchantment; on which account they were\r\nfrequently ranked with magicians, sorcerers, and witches. They were\r\ngreatly encouraged in the middle ages, and travelled in large\r\ncompanies, carrying with them such machinery as was necessary for the\r\nperformance of their deceptions.”\r\n\r\n“And what may be the etymology of _tragetour_?” asked Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“A late ingenious writer supposes it to be derived from _trebuchet_, or\r\n_trap-door_, of which he made frequent use during his performance.”\r\n\r\nThe company passed to the next booth.\r\n\r\n“There,” said Ned, “will be exhibited vaulting, tumbling, jumping\r\nthrough hoops, balancing, grotesque dances by the clown, and dancing\r\nupon the tight-rope.”\r\n\r\n“The tragetour rarely executed this part of the performance himself,”\r\nsaid the vicar, “but left it to some of his confederates.”\r\n\r\n“And yet I should have thought it the most profitable department of the\r\nart,” observed the major; “for it was so patronised as to secure the\r\nreception of its professors into the houses of the nobility. In the\r\nreign of Edward II. a tumbler rode before the King, and so delighted\r\nhis Majesty, that he rewarded him with a gratuity of twenty shillings,\r\na very considerable sum in those days.”\r\n\r\nThe whole party, having expressed their satisfaction at the genius\r\nwhich Ned Hopkins had displayed in selecting and arranging the various\r\nkinds of amusement, were conducted by the vicar to a small enclosure at\r\na short distance from the fair, which he had appropriated to the youths\r\nof the village, who had been trained to perform the “_Ludus Trojæ_,”\r\naccording to the description left us by Virgil in the fifth Æneid.\r\n\r\n“I shall be curious to witness the sport,” said the major, “for Lazius\r\nasserts, in his commentaries upon the Roman Republic, that the jousts\r\nand tournaments, so much in fashion about two or three hundred years\r\nago, were indebted for their origin to this game; and that\r\n‘_Tournamenta_’ is but a corruption of ‘_Trojamenta_.’”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied the vicar; “and the learned and noble Du Fresne\r\nentertains the same opinion: by some the word has been derived from the\r\nFrench _tourner_, to turn round with agility; yet the exercises have so\r\nmuch resemblance, as to prove the one an imitation of the other.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, my good friend,” exclaimed the honest major, “all these\r\npreparations are highly laudable, and will, no doubt, afford\r\nsatisfaction to the spectators, for whose amusement they have been\r\ndesigned; but there are other senses, besides the eye and ear, to be\r\ngratified upon this occasion. I have not yet observed any arrangements\r\nfor the dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Fear not, major; the awning which has been erected for that purpose is\r\nwithin sight: observe you not the banners which are floating yonder?”\r\nsaid the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, to be sure I do; and let me tell you, that you have taken up a\r\nvery snug position.”\r\n\r\nTables had been arranged, under an awning of canvass, in the form of a\r\ncross, and were capable of accommodating about two hundred persons. On\r\na platform, somewhat elevated, was another table appropriated to the\r\nmajor and his guests, on which covers were laid for forty.\r\n\r\n“You perceive, major,” said Mr. Twaddleton, as they approached the\r\nscene of future action, “that the fare which has been provided is\r\nsimple but substantial, and I trust will be considered as no less\r\naccording with English hospitality, than with classical propriety.”\r\n\r\n“The beef certainly predominates,” said the major; “and I observe that\r\nmost of the joints are roasted.”\r\n\r\n“Quite correct, sir; the ox is the animal most frequently spoken of, as\r\nfurnishing food for ancient heroes; and you will remember that Homer\r\nrarely mentions any other than _roasted_ meat.”\r\n\r\n“I perceive that you have been more miscellaneous in your arrangement\r\nof the upper table.”\r\n\r\n“I have placed before you a chine of beef, because Menelaus set that\r\ndish before Telemachus at the marriage-feast of his son.”\r\n\r\n“And I rejoice to see a salad for its neighbour,” said the major.\r\n\r\n“Ay, truly an _Attic_ salad, with garlic, leeks, and cheese: you no\r\ndoubt remember that the poetical salad served up in the comedy of the\r\nPeace of Aristophanes was of this composition,” added the vicar.\r\n\r\n“I wish to know what seats are to be appropriated to my young friends\r\nthe little Seymours?” said the major.\r\n\r\n“I regret extremely to say, that they cannot with propriety join our\r\nparty,” replied the vicar, gravely.\r\n\r\n“Not join the party! zounds, sir, but I insist upon it;--not join the\r\nparty!”--\r\n\r\n“Be calm, major; and believe me that I shall feel the privation as\r\nkeenly as yourself; but would you countenance a measure, which is\r\ndecidedly in opposition to every classical authority? Never, as\r\nSuetonius has expressly declared, did the young Cæsars, Caius and\r\nLucius, eat at the table of Augustus, until they had assumed the _toga\r\nvirilis_.”\r\n\r\n“A fig for Suetonius; he is not to be trusted: has it not been said,\r\nthat, while he exposed the deformities of the Cæsars, he wrote with all\r\nthe licentiousness and extravagance with which they lived? Besides, can\r\nwe trust the opinion of a man, on a subject of etiquette, who was\r\nbanished from the court for want of attention and respect to the\r\nEmpress Sabina? You must produce some better authority, my dear Mr.\r\nTwaddleton: search the Grecian writers; depend upon it that some direct\r\nor implied sanction to the plan is to be discovered; the oracles of old\r\nmay generally be so interpreted as to meet the wishes of the\r\ntranslator.”\r\n\r\n“Gently, Major Snapwell; speak not so irreverently of the luminaries of\r\nantiquity; nor expect me to distort passages from their original and\r\nintended significations. An idea, however, has just struck me, which\r\nmay, possibly, be turned to your advantage; and yet there are many\r\ndifficulties; for it cannot be that this feast has been conducted with\r\nthe utmost frugality; and, therefore, must not be compared with the\r\nLacedemonian ‘_Syssitia_,’ or public entertainments, whither the youths\r\nwere obliged, by the lawgiver, to repair as to schools of temperance\r\nand sobriety, and where, by the example and discourse of the elder men,\r\nthey were trained to good manners and useful knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“A case exactly in point,” exclaimed the major. “Must not the classical\r\ncharacter of our entertainment convey instruction? I vow it runs\r\nparallel in every particular with the Syssitia of Lacedemon; and I\r\ntherefore affirm, that it would be illegal, according to the law of\r\nLycurgus, to prevent the presence of the young Seymours.”\r\n\r\n“Your argument has colour, major; I must admit that Mr. Seymour’s\r\nlessons are too valuable to be lost: well, I consent; it shall be a\r\nLacedemonian entertainment, and my young friends shall be accordingly\r\naccommodated with seats.”\r\n\r\nOn their return from the banqueting-tables, the party inspected the\r\npreparations for the fire-works, and the ships constructed for the\r\nnaumachia; we shall, however, at present decline offering any\r\ndescription, as we prefer explaining them in operation.\r\n\r\nThe reader will now be pleased to imagine that the party having\r\nreturned to the mansion, had partaken of the hospitable repast which\r\nthe major had provided for them; he may farther suppose that tea had\r\nbeen served up, and the amusements of the evening commenced; for it is\r\nat this moment that the course of our narrative is resumed. Mrs.\r\nBeacham was delighting the assembly by a splendid display of her\r\nmusical talents; the major and Mr. Seymour were engaged in a game of\r\nchess.\r\n\r\n“There you sit, gentlemen,” exclaimed the vicar, “so absorbed in your\r\ngame, as to have remained quite insensible to the sweet sounds with\r\nwhich Mrs. Beacham has been charming us; but you stand excused, for\r\nSeneca admits the fascinating power of the ‘_ludus latrunculorum_,’ or\r\ngame of chess. You no doubt remember the story that he tells us of one\r\nCanius Julius, who, having been sentenced to death by Caligula, was\r\nfound by the centurion, when he came to conduct him to execution, so\r\ninterested in a game of the ‘_latrunculi_,’ as at first to be\r\ninsensible to the summons, and that he did not prepare to depart until\r\nhe had counted his men, and desired the centurion to bear witness to\r\nhis having one more piece on the board than his adversary, so that the\r\nlatter might not boast of a victory after his death.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said the major; “but unfortunately for your story, the\r\nancients were not acquainted with the game of chess.”\r\n\r\n“What absurd proposition am I next to expect?” cried Mr. Twaddleton.\r\n“You surely cannot have read the poem to Piso, which some will have to\r\nbe Ovid’s, others Lucian’s: but no matter; it is an ancient poem, and\r\naccurately describes the game of ‘_latrunculi_.’ I myself believe, from\r\na particular line in Sophocles, that chess was invented by Palamedes,\r\nat the siege of Troy; although Seneca attributes it to Chilon, one of\r\nthe seven Grecian sages. My friend Mr. Seymour, who is, upon all\r\noccasions, desirous of imparting wisdom through the medium of games,\r\nand of ‘turning sport into science,’ will no doubt agree with those who\r\nfancy that it was contrived by Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, as a method of\r\ninstructing his soldiers in the military art; and I must admit that the\r\ngame expresses the chance and order of war so very happily, that no\r\nplace can lay so just a claim to its invention as the camp: ‘_ludimus\r\neffigiem belli_,’[71] as Vida says.”\r\n\r\n“Check to your king!” cried the major; “while you are considering of\r\nthe best way to get his majesty out of the scrape, I will endeavour to\r\nextricate the vicar out of the quagmire in which he is floundering. My\r\ndear Mr. Twaddleton,” continued the major, “you speak as if it were an\r\nadmitted fact that the ‘_ludus latrunculorum_’ was synonymous with our\r\nchess. I admit that it was a game played with _Tesseræ_ or squares, and\r\n_Calculi_ or pieces; but it does not follow that it must have been\r\nchess; indeed, the learned Dr. Hyde, whose researches into Oriental\r\ngames are as much distinguished for accurate discrimination as for\r\nprofound scholarship, considers it to have resembled our\r\n_draughts_.”[72]\r\n\r\n“You are to move, major,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Then I shall take your castle, and open a fresh battery upon the\r\nvicar,” replied Major Snapwell.\r\n\r\n“So you may,” cried Mr. Twaddleton, “but you will not easily drive me\r\nfrom my position; supported as I am by Vossius and Salmasius, and an\r\narmy of valiant combatants.”\r\n\r\n“The learned Hyde has endeavoured to prove that chess was first\r\ninvented in India, and passed from thence to Persia and Arabia.(54)\r\nFabricius considered it a Persian game, and I must say that I am\r\ninclined to coincide with him. The terms in present use may evidently\r\nbe traced to an Oriental source. _Schach_, in the Persian language,\r\nsignifies king, and _schachmat_, whence our _check-mate_, the king is\r\ndead, the original words having been transformed by progressive\r\nchanges; thus we have _schach_, _echecs_, _chess_; and by a whimsical\r\nconcurrence of circumstances, have arisen the English words _check_,\r\nand _exchequer_.”\r\n\r\n“I take your _queen_,” cried Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Ay; and I take a _bishop_ in return,” said the major.\r\n\r\n“Well,” observed the vicar, “if an Oriental nation really gave origin\r\nto the game, it could not, at all events, have been China; since the\r\npolicy of that people is to exclude females from every kind and degree\r\nof influence and power, whereas the _queen_ at chess is a powerful and\r\nimportant piece.”\r\n\r\n“You must not lay too much stress upon the names of the several\r\npieces,” observed the major, “since they have varied in different ages\r\nand countries. The castle is sometimes called the _rook_, from the\r\nItalian word _rocca_, which signifies a fortress placed on a rock: the\r\npiece which we call the _Bishop_ has been termed by English writers\r\n_alphan_, _aufin_, &c. from an Arabic word, signifying an elephant;\r\nsometimes it was named an _archer_; by the Germans, the _hound_ or\r\n_runner_; by Russians and Swedes, the _elephant_; by Poles, the\r\n_priest_; and by the French, at a very early period, the _fou_ or\r\n_fool_; the reason of this last appellation seems to be, that as this\r\npiece stands on the sides of the king and queen, some wag of the times\r\nstyled it the _fool_, because anciently royal personages were commonly\r\nthus attended, from want of other means of amusing themselves.”\r\n\r\n“You cannot thus account for our term _bishop_,” observed Mr. Seymour,\r\n“as our kings and queens have never had such attendants.”\r\n\r\n“Nor is it very easy to ascertain the period at which it was\r\nintroduced,” replied the major; “in Caxton’s time it was styled the\r\n_elphyn_. I should think it probable that the change of name took place\r\nafter the Reformation.”\r\n\r\n“It is probable that the pieces not only underwent changes in name, but\r\nchanges in value or power,” observed Mr. Seymour, “as the game\r\ndescended through different ages and countries.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Beacham, who had been for some time listening with much interest\r\nto the curious discourse we have just related, here ventured to ask a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“As you appear to have taken some trouble to ascertain the origin of\r\nthis game, you can perhaps inform me at what period it was introduced\r\ninto England.”\r\n\r\nThe major replied, that the learned Hyde supposed it to have been first\r\nknown in our country about the time of the Conquest; but that Mr.\r\nBarrington believed it to have been introduced during the thirteenth\r\ncentury, upon the return of Edward I. from the Holy Land, where he\r\ncontinued so long, and was attended by so many English.\r\n\r\n“It is certain that our ancestors played much at chess before the\r\ngeneral introduction of cards,” observed the vicar, “as no fewer than\r\ntwenty-six English families have emblazoned chess-boards and\r\nchess-rooks in their arms, and it must therefore have been considered a\r\nvaluable accomplishment.”\r\n\r\n“Cards,” observed the major, “must have been known in England previous\r\nto the time of Edward IV.; since a statute was passed in that reign\r\nagainst their importation; but they did not become general for many\r\nyears, and the progress of the custom appears to have been extremely\r\nslow.”\r\n\r\n“Check,--and mate!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, I have lost the game. Mr. Twaddleton, I lay this to your\r\naccount,” said the major; “you ought not, sir, to have intruded your\r\nantiquarian discussions at such a time.”\r\n\r\n“You have lost the game, major, because, like Charles XII. of\r\nSweden,[73] you are too fond of advancing your king; but it is quite\r\nnatural that you should feel mortified by your defeat: a person never\r\nlikes to be beat at chess, because it is a trial of skill and address;\r\nchance has no place, and no one, therefore, loses except in consequence\r\nof the superiority of adversary. You may remember that William the\r\nConqueror, upon being _check-mated_ by the Prince of France, knocked\r\nthe chess-board about his pate, an event which became the source of\r\nmuch future enmity. I must say,” continued the vicar, “that this, in my\r\nview of the matter, is an imperfection in the game; for, if it be the\r\ntype or representative of a military campaign, fortune should have some\r\nshare in deciding the fate of the day; and, if I remember correctly,\r\nSir William Jones has stated that the use of dice, to regulate the\r\nmoves, was formerly introduced in the East.”\r\n\r\n“I will give the major his revenge whenever he pleases,” said Mr.\r\nSeymour; “but as I well know how dearly the vicar loves an antiquarian\r\nanecdote, if he will listen I will furnish him with one that will be\r\nprobably new to him. Do you observe the form of the chess-board,\r\nresembling, as you perceive, two folio volumes?” said Mr. Seymour. “The\r\norigin of it was this: Endes, bishop of Sully, forbade his clergy to\r\nplay at chess. As they were resolved, however, not to obey the command,\r\nand yet did not dare to have a chess-board seen in their houses or\r\ncloisters, they had them bound and lettered as books, and called them\r\ntheir wooden gospels. These same monks had also drinking vessels bound\r\nto resemble the breviary, and were found drinking when it was supposed\r\nthey were at prayers.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  Many reasons have been assigned for this custom; the more commonly\r\n  received opinion is, that it was intended as a token of the\r\n  bridegroom having left off childish diversions, and entered on a more\r\n  serious state of life; whence _nucibus relictis_, has passed into a\r\n  proverb. This conjecture is favoured by Catullus:--\r\n\r\n                                   “Satis diu\r\n                         Lusisti nucibus. Lubet\r\n                         Jam servire Thalassio.”\r\n\r\n  We have already stated, that _nuces_ were played with like our\r\n  marbles; the custom, therefore, might be intended to express that the\r\n  bridegroom had deserted his playthings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n             “War’s harmless shape we sing, and boxen trains\r\n              Of youth, encount’ring on the _cedar_ plains.\r\n              How two tall kings, by different armour known,\r\n              Traverse the field, and combat for renown.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  ‘Ludus Latrunculorum;’ ludus, anglice dicitur _Draughts_, à trahendo\r\n  calculos.--HYDE _de Ludis Orientalium._ Oxon, 1694.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  Voltaire tells us that Charles XII. always lost the game at chess,\r\n  from his eagerness to move his king, and to make greater use of him\r\n  than of any of the other pieces.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n _The arrival of the populace at Osterley Park.--The commencement\r\n    of the festivities.--Dancing on the Tight and Slack\r\n    Rope.--Balancing.--Conjuring.--Optical illusions.--Various\r\n    games.--The Penthalum.--The Banquet.--Grand display of\r\n    Fire-works.--Conclusion._\r\n\r\n\r\nNever had the rosy fingers of Aurora shown so much reluctance in\r\nunbarring the gates of the East, as on the morning of the Osterley\r\nJubilee; at least, so thought about half a score peasants, who, fevered\r\nby anxiety and expectation, had arisen from their beds long before the\r\nbreak of day.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, the sun arose; but indignant no doubt at the\r\naccusations he had so unjustly suffered, he immediately veiled his\r\nfiery countenance in dark and lowering clouds: here, then, was a fresh\r\nsource of doubt and anxiety; would the day be rainy? The gardener at\r\nOverton Lodge was immediately sought and consulted; and cheering as\r\nwere his predictions, they scarcely succeeded in dispelling the gloom\r\nwhich shaded many a fair countenance. The apprehension of\r\ndisappointment was, however, suddenly relieved; for between nine and\r\nten o’clock the sun re-appeared, beaming in all his glory, and shedding\r\nthe brightest refulgence on the scene of the approaching festivities.\r\nAt this period hundreds of villagers, dressed in their holiday attire,\r\nwere seen pouring along the high road, or winding their way through the\r\nverdant valleys. So admirable had been the arrangements for the\r\nadmission of the populace into the park, that great as was the\r\nconcourse of spectators, not the slightest impediment occurred during\r\ntheir entrance.\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten o’clock the whole population of the country had\r\nassembled; the various performers were on their respective stages; and\r\nthe arrival of Major Snapwell and his guests was eagerly expected, as a\r\nsignal for the commencement of the festivities of the day.\r\n\r\nAt length a distant murmur was heard in the direction of the house,\r\nwhich gradually increased as it approached the meadow, until it swelled\r\ninto one grand and universal chorus. The vicar appeared with his wand\r\nof office, which he no sooner waved in the air than the murmur\r\ngradually subsided. Major Snapwell and his friends, Harry Beacham and\r\nhis bride, and the Seymours with their children, and numerous visitors,\r\nfollowed. The several bands, stationed on the platforms erected before\r\nthe show-booths, simultaneously struck up the national anthem, in which\r\nthe whole multitude joined, and produced one of the most surprising and\r\nthrilling effects ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nThere were eight booths appropriated to the exhibitions; and it had\r\nbeen arranged that each should commence at the same time, and repeat\r\nits performances eight times during the day; so that by dividing the\r\nspectators into eight groups, and delivering to each person a ticket\r\ndistinguished by a particular number, every spectator at once knew the\r\nbooth into which he was to enter; and having witnessed the exhibition,\r\nhe was directed to exchange his ticket; by which means every chance of\r\nconfusion was avoided, and each person was enabled to witness,\r\nsuccessively, every performance.\r\n\r\nThe vicar and the party entered the first booth, and were followed by\r\nall those whose ticket was distinguished by No. 1.; those of No. 2. at\r\nthe same time entered the second booth, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe first show was appropriated to the various exhibitions of vaulting,\r\ntumbling, balancing, and rope-dancing. The vicar expressed high delight\r\non observing that the stage was decorated with branches. “In the\r\nancient theatre,” said he, “the stage was originally planted with trees\r\nto _shade_ the actors; hence scene, so called from the Greek word\r\nsignifying a shade.”[74]\r\n\r\nDuring the performances of the balancer, Tom Seymour’s attention was\r\nriveted on the artist; he watched every movement, and examined its\r\neffect in preserving the centre of gravity within the base. “Papa,”\r\ncried the delighted boy, “I never experienced so much interest in a\r\nperformance of this kind, until I was capable of explaining the\r\nprinciples upon which it was conducted. I have attentively followed\r\nevery change of position, and discovered the effect of such changes\r\nupon the line of direction.”[75] As to the _wire-dancing_, Tom\r\nobserved, that he saw very plainly the swinging of the wire backwards\r\nand forwards diminished the difficulty, and assisted the actor in\r\nkeeping his equipoise.\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour was highly delighted with these remarks; and, casting an\r\nintelligible look at Mr. Twaddleton, who was seated near him, he\r\nexclaimed, “Well, vicar, you will surely now admit that the pleasures\r\nwhich arise from sport are heightened by the admixture of science.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Seymour,” replied the vicar, “you well know that I have\r\nlong since become a convert to your principles; I confess, however, had\r\nthat not been the case, the expression of satisfaction and delight\r\nwhich have just fallen from my little playmate, Tom, would have removed\r\nall my prejudices.”\r\n\r\n“See, see!” exclaimed Louisa, “how very extraordinary! I declare that\r\nthe plate, sword, key, and tobacco-pipe, are all balanced as they\r\nrevolve on the chin of the performer.”\r\n\r\n“And do you not know, Louisa,” replied Tom, “that the revolution of the\r\nplate and sword, which appears to render the execution so much more\r\nastonishing, actually diminishes the difficulty of the performance?”[76]\r\n\r\nThus did Tom Seymour continue to point out successively the\r\nphilosophical principles upon which each of the tricks might be\r\nsupposed to depend.\r\n\r\nThe next booth into which our party entered was that of Crank Smirky,\r\nthe celebrated conjuror, who invited the company to witness his\r\nwonderful display of the art of legerdemain: he was dressed as an\r\nastrologer, with a loose gown of green velvet, and a red cap; he had a\r\nlong grey beard, and his nose was bestraddled by a pair of green\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” said the mystic professor, “I shall have the\r\nhonour of convincing you this day, that my single hand is more than a\r\nmatch for all the sharp eyes of Overton. You will admit that a\r\nbeautiful eye makes silence eloquent,--a kind eye, contradiction an\r\nassent,--and an enraged eye, beauty deformed; but my hand shall, by its\r\nmagic influence, make eloquence dumb, assent a contradiction, and\r\ndeformity beautiful.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the professor beckoned a villager, who sat near the stage,\r\nto approach and assist him in the performance of his first grand trick.\r\n\r\n“Dobby,” exclaimed his terrified wife, “sit thee still; that man has\r\ndealings with the old one; I would not that he should touch your\r\ngarment for all the gingerbread in the fair.”\r\n\r\nThis exclamation of the terrified wife set the whole audience in a\r\nroar, and produced a confusion which the skilful conjuror is always\r\nanxious to create, when any sly work is to be performed. In truth, this\r\nscene had been previously concerted by the renowned Crank Smirky, who\r\nhad engaged this said Dobby as his confederate. A series of very\r\namusing tricks were then performed with cards and counters; such, for\r\ninstance, as desiring some person to draw a card from the pack, and\r\nhaving observed what it was, to return it; which card, to the wonder of\r\nthe company, was immediately found in Dobby’s pocket. Mr. Seymour\r\ninformed his children that the explanation of this trick would serve to\r\nshow the manner in which most of the deceptions on cards were\r\nperformed. He said, that the conjuror’s pack of cards always contained\r\na card, technically termed a ‘_brief_ card,’ or ‘the _old gentleman_,’\r\nwhich is one made on purpose by the card-maker, and is a little larger\r\nthan any of the rest; the performer always knows it by feeling it, and\r\ncan easily force it upon the unsuspecting drawer; should he, however,\r\nattempt to take any other, the conjuror, under some pretence, shuffles\r\nagain, till at length he induces him to take the one intended for him.\r\nAfter the card has been introduced again into the pack, the performer,\r\nwithout any difficulty, withdraws it, and the confederate is called\r\nupon to produce the duplicate which had been previously placed in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nThe children were told that the several deceptions with coin, or\r\ncounters, which they had witnessed, were accomplished by a species of\r\ndexterity acquired only by practice, and termed ‘_palming_;’ it\r\nconsisted in being able to retain a shilling, halfpenny, or counter, in\r\nthe palm of the hand, while it remained extended; thus the performer\r\ndesires any one to reckon five pieces, which are accordingly placed on\r\nthe table before him, the conjuror then takes them up, and having\r\ndexterously palmed one, he adds it to the number as he places it in the\r\nhand of the unsuspecting person.\r\n\r\nTom and his sisters expressed themselves much pleased and surprised\r\nwith the dexterity of the performer; “But,” added the intelligent boy,\r\n“I should be much more gratified by tricks that were indebted for their\r\nmystery to some philosophical principle.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seymour and the vicar again interchanged looks that strongly marked\r\nthe feelings which had been excited by this observation. The former\r\nturning to his son, said, that if he waited patiently, he would shortly\r\nbe gratified in that wish, for he knew Crank Smirky was prepared to\r\nexhibit some recreations in divination, that were founded on the\r\nscience of numbers.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Seymour mistaken; for after a few more specimens of his\r\ndexterity, the conjuror requested Mr. Twaddleton, who was sitting\r\ndirectly in his front, to take an _even_ number of counters in one\r\nhand, and an _odd_ number in the other; and he would tell him, he said,\r\nin which hand he held the even number. Mr. Twaddleton having complied\r\nwith the request, he was farther desired to multiply the number in the\r\nright hand by any _even_ number he pleased, as, for instance, 2; and\r\nthat in the left hand by an odd number, as 3.\r\n\r\n“I have done so,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Then be pleased to add together the two products, and tell me whether\r\nthe sum be odd or even.”\r\n\r\n“It is odd,” replied Mr. Twaddleton.\r\n\r\n“If so,” said the conjuror, “the even number of counters will be in\r\nyour right hand.”\r\n\r\nThe vicar exposed the counters, and admitted the correctness of the\r\nconjuror’s decision.(55)\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” exclaimed the man of mystery, “I now humbly\r\ncrave your silent attention, while I exhibit one of the most wonderful\r\nexamples of my art. Here is a ring,--there a shilling,--and there a\r\nglove. I shall presently request each of the three gentlemen before me,\r\nto take one of those articles, so secretly as to prevent the\r\npossibility of my discovering the choice he may have made. I have here,\r\nyou perceive, twenty-four counters; _one_ of which I shall give to you,\r\nMr. Seymour; _two_ to you, reverend sir; and _three_ to you, my young\r\nphilosopher; the remaining eighteen shall remain on the table. Now,\r\ngentlemen, I shall retire, and during my absence, you will be so good\r\nas to distribute the three articles in any way you may think proper.”\r\n\r\nThe professor, accordingly, walked off the stage; when Mr. Seymour took\r\nthe ring; the vicar the shilling; and Tom Seymour the glove. The\r\nconjuror, on his return, said that he had one more favour to request,\r\nthat the person who had the ring should take from the eighteen counters\r\non the table as many as he already possessed; the one with the shilling\r\ntwice as many; and the person with the glove, four times as many as he\r\nbefore possessed. The conjuror again retired, in order that the\r\ndistribution might be made without his observing it. On returning, the\r\nconjuror, having first cast his eye upon the counters that remained on\r\nthe table, informed the company that Mr. Seymour had taken the ring,\r\nMr. Twaddleton the shilling, and the young gentleman the glove. The\r\nmoment the parties assented to this decision, the whole company\r\nexpressed their satisfaction and astonishment by thunders of applause.\r\n\r\n“That is really very ingenious,” observed the vicar.\r\n\r\n“How could he perform it?” said Tom: “it is evident that his only guide\r\nwas the number of counters left on the board.”\r\n\r\n“I understand the process by which it was accomplished, and will\r\nendeavour, at some future time, to explain it,” replied Mr. Seymour.(56)\r\n\r\nA number of similar tricks followed, all of which depended upon some\r\nalgebraical calculation; and the performance was concluded to the\r\nentire satisfaction of all present.\r\n\r\nThe next exhibition was of a very different character: it consisted in\r\na variety of optical representations and illusions. The camera obscura\r\npresented a moving picture of the surrounding scene. The phantasmagoria\r\nexhibited a variety of ghastly objects, which alternately receding\r\nfrom, and approaching the audience, called forth shrieks of terror and\r\namazement. Amongst the most appalling of these figures, was the\r\nheadless horseman of Sleepy Hollow, so inimitably described in the\r\nSketch Book: it will be remembered that the body of this trooper having\r\nbeen buried in the church-yard, its ghost was believed to ride forth\r\nevery night in quest of its head, and that the rushing speed with which\r\nhe passed along the hollow, like a midnight blast, was owing to his\r\nbeing in a hurry to get back to the church-yard before day-break. This\r\nrapid movement was admirably represented in the phantasmagoria: at\r\nfirst the figure appeared extremely diminutive, and at a great\r\ndistance; but almost immediately its size became gigantic, and it\r\nseemed as if within a few feet of the audience, and then suddenly\r\nvanished. After an instant of utter darkness, the figure was again\r\nvisible at a great distance: the schoolmaster, Crane, was also seen\r\nbelabouring the starveling ribs of his steed, old Gunpowder, and\r\nquickening his pace towards the very spot where the spectre was\r\nstationed. The whole audience were breathless with horror. Crane\r\narrived at the bridge, over which the headless figure opposed his\r\npassage. “Mercy upon us!” cried a faint voice from one of the back\r\nseats, “the ghost has found his head, and is carrying it before him on\r\nthe pommel of his saddle.”--“Hush, hush!” cried another voice; Crane’s\r\nhorse had taken fright; away he dashed through thick and thin; stones\r\nflying and sparks flashing at every bound. Crane’s flimsy garments\r\nfluttered in the air, as he stretched his long lank body away over his\r\nhorse’s head, in the eagerness of his flight. The goblin pressed hard\r\nupon him; he was not more than a yard behind him, when he was seen to\r\ntake up his head, and with gigantic force to hurl it at the pedagogue;\r\nit encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash; he was tumbled\r\nheadlong in the dust; the goblin whisked past like a whirlwind, and the\r\ncompany were once again in total darkness.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, “this is one of the most\r\ncomplete illusions I ever witnessed.”\r\n\r\n“It is most ingeniously managed,” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“Papa,” cried Tom, “I am quite impatient to learn how so extraordinary\r\nan effect can have been produced. You told me this morning that a\r\nphantasmagoria was nothing more than an improved magic lantern; but how\r\nis it possible for the slides to be so managed as to make the figures\r\napproach and retire from you, and above all, to make them move their\r\nbodies, and throw their arms into different attitudes?”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, the figures only _appear_ to approach you, for\r\nthey are thrown upon a surface which never changes its place; the whole\r\nis therefore an optical illusion, arising from the fact that we\r\nestimate the distance of an object by its apparent magnitude; when,\r\ntherefore, the figure began to diminish in size, the mind instantly\r\nassumed that it was receding from the eye; and the illusion was still\r\nfarther heightened by the absence of all other objects[77] by which it\r\nmight be compared.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mr. Seymour was interrupted by the appearance of the\r\nperformer who announced his intention of submitting another optical\r\nillusion, which, he trusted, would afford equal satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Papa,” cried Tom, “how much do I regret my ignorance of optics. It is\r\na great disappointment to me that I should witness so many curious\r\nexhibitions, without being able to understand the principles upon which\r\nthey depend.”\r\n\r\n“I promise you, my dear boy,” replied Mr. Seymour, “that you shall be\r\ninstructed in this branch of science during the Christmas vacation.\r\nEnjoy, therefore, the present amusements, and instead of repining at\r\nyour ignorance, anticipate the pleasure which you will receive, when\r\nyou shall be able to explain them.”\r\n\r\nA series of extraordinary effects were now exhibited by means of\r\nconcave mirrors.[78] Aërial images were produced, so illusive in their\r\nappearance, that the spectators could not believe in their\r\nimmateriality, until they attempted to grasp them. In this manner were\r\npresented flowers, fruit, a human skull, and a dagger; the latter of\r\nwhich terrified the spectator by the sudden and violent manner in which\r\nits point approached him. With this illusion the amusements concluded;\r\nthe light of day was admitted; and the performer stepping forward,\r\nannounced the termination of his exhibition in the words of\r\nShakspeare:--\r\n\r\n              “Our revels now are ended: these our actors,\r\n               As I foretold you, were all spirits, and\r\n               Are melted into air, into thin air.”\r\n\r\nThe villagers, as they poured out of the booth, and mingled with their\r\ncompanions in the fair, with their wonted propensity for the\r\nmarvellous, related, in most exaggerated terms, the wonders they had\r\nencountered in the region of shadows. Nothing is swallowed with more\r\navidity than tales of mystery, especially if spiced with a few grains\r\nof horror; we cannot, therefore, be surprised at the anxiety so\r\ngenerally by those who had not yet witnessed the optical performances\r\nto exchange their tickets for such as would secure their admission into\r\nthe popular booth.\r\n\r\nThe next entertainment was a display of ventriloquism, by a pupil of\r\nthe celebrated Baron de Mengen.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the vicar, “we are to witness a deception upon the ear,\r\nsuch as we have just seen practised on the eye.”\r\n\r\nMr. Twaddleton was quite correct in this observation; for,\r\nnotwithstanding all the mystery with which the subject has been\r\ninvested by credulity, ventriloquism is nothing more than a skilful\r\nmodulation of the voice, so as to imitate the gradations of sound, as\r\nthey effect the ear in nature under all the circumstances of distance\r\nand obstruction; in short, imposing upon the ear as a perspective\r\npainting does upon the eye.\r\n\r\nThe crowd which had assembled round the spot was now dispersed by the\r\nappearance of a placard, announcing the suspension of all the\r\nperformances for two hours; and informing the populace that the\r\ninterval would be devoted to various sports and pastimes in the\r\nadjoining field.\r\n\r\nThe revellers accordingly hastened to the spot where the several sports\r\nwere to take place, and to which they were directed by the sound of a\r\nbugle.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that a small enclosure had been prepared for the youths\r\nof the village, who were to perform the “_ludus Trojæ_,” or Troy game.\r\nThe major and his party had taken possession of the seat, placed for\r\ntheir accommodation under an awning; and the boys, classically dressed,\r\nand furnished with little arms and weapons, were mustered in _circo_.\r\nEach youth was mounted on a pony; and the troop having rode round the\r\nring, and surveyed the spectators, the vicar arose from his seat, and,\r\nlike the sage Epytides, gave the signal of attack by a crack of the\r\nwhip. They now arranged themselves in two battalions, and hurling their\r\njavelins with an air of proud defiance, wheeled and charged, and urged\r\nthe sportive war; at the conclusion of the game, the vicar called the\r\nprincipal youth, or “_princeps juventutis_,” and presented him with a\r\nbasket of fruit, which he desired him to divide amongst his companions.\r\n\r\nThe populace now separated into different groups; one party proceeded\r\nto witness a wrestling-match; another to see the foot-race; a third to\r\nbe present at a match of quoits; for the vicar had provided all these\r\ngames, in imitation of the ancient _Penthalum_ or _Quinquertium_. While\r\nobserving the game of quoits, the vicar displayed much classical\r\nerudition; he said that Homer had represented Ajax and Ulysses as\r\ngreatly skilled in the sport; and that Ovid, when he brings in Apollo\r\nand Hyacinth playing at it, had given a very elegant description of the\r\nexercise.[79] Scaliger, he continued, is of opinion, that the throwing\r\nthe _discus_, or quoit, is but an improvement of the old sport of\r\ncasting the sheep-hook; a conjecture which, the vicar thought, received\r\nsome support from a passage in the fourth Iliad.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Twaddleton,” cried Mr. Seymour, “you look at every sport with the\r\neye of a classic or antiquary; I, on the other hand, as you well know,\r\ncautiously examine every action, to discover whether some scientific\r\nprinciple may not find an illustration. On the present occasion, I am\r\ndesirous of directing the attention of the children to the manner in\r\nwhich yonder skilful player hurls his quoit.”\r\n\r\n“I do not exactly comprehend the object they have in view in throwing\r\nthe quoits,” said Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Do you not perceive that two iron pins, or _hobs_, are driven into the\r\nground, at the distance of eighteen or twenty yards asunder?” asked her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n“To be sure, and I suppose that each player attempts to hit one of\r\nthose pins.”\r\n\r\n“The players stand at one of the _hobs_, and throw an equal number of\r\nquoits at the other; the nearest of them to the hob are reckoned\r\ntowards the game. When they have cast all their quoits, the candidates\r\ngo over to the point at which they have been throwing, and when they\r\nhave determined the state of the game, they throw their quoits back\r\nagain at the hob where they had before stood; and thus continue to act,\r\non alternate sides, till the game is ended.”\r\n\r\n“I now understand it,” cried Louisa.\r\n\r\n“You doubtless know, Mr. Twaddleton,” said Mr. Seymour, “that the\r\ncasting of stones, darts, and other missiles, was among the amusements\r\npractised in the twelfth century by the young Londoners.”\r\n\r\n“_Casting of the bar_,” replied the vicar, “was formerly a part of a\r\nhero’s education; and kings and princes were admired for their agility\r\nand grace in throwing ‘the stone, the bar, and the plummet.’ Henry the\r\nEighth, even after his accession to the throne, retained the casting of\r\nthe bar among his favourite amusements. The sledge-hammer, and, among\r\nrustics, an axle-tree, were also used for the same purpose as the bar\r\nand the stone.”\r\n\r\n“The game of quoits is certainly far superior to such pastimes,” said\r\nMr. Seymour, “on account of its depending less on mere strength, and\r\nmore upon superior skill.”\r\n\r\n“Did not you say, papa, that its action would illustrate some principle\r\nof science? I have been looking at the quoit, which I perceive is a\r\ncircular piece of iron with a hole in the middle, but I cannot discover\r\nin what manner any scientific principle can be connected with its\r\nmotion.”\r\n\r\n“If you will attentively observe a skilful player, you will perceive\r\nthat he steadies the flight of the quoit, by imparting to it a spinning\r\nmotion; were he not thus to _rifle_ it, you would find that it would\r\nfly very far from the mark.”\r\n\r\n“Upon the same principle, I suppose, that we impart to the ball a\r\nspinning motion at the game of _bilboquet_?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely so,” replied her father, who also stated that the body was\r\nmade to rotate on its shortest axis, for the reasons before\r\nexplained.[80]\r\n\r\nThe “_penthalum_” having been concluded, the populace retired into\r\nseveral booths which were appropriated to refreshments. The shows then\r\nre-commenced; those not already described were principally devoted to\r\nthe exhibition of wild animals, an entertainment which the vicar\r\nconsidered as sanctioned by the highest classical authority; although\r\nhe, at once, rejected a proposition made by the major, to render the\r\namusement still more in accordance with ancient custom, by encouraging\r\na fight between a lion and a tiger.\r\n\r\nThe hour had now arrived for the grand banquet; and, by the command of\r\nthe major, the band paraded the fair, playing the inviting tune of “Oh,\r\nthe roast beef of Old England.” The populace hastened to the tent, and\r\neach took his place according to the number upon his ticket.\r\n\r\nWe shall not detain our readers by an account of the dinner; it will be\r\nsufficient to state, in the language generally used upon such\r\noccasions, that the whole went off with great eclat, and gave universal\r\nsatisfaction to the delighted guests.\r\n\r\nFor the amusement of his military friends, the major had made\r\narrangements for reviving the ancient game of quintain. It may be\r\nnecessary to state that the quintain is a pastime of high antiquity. It\r\nwas originally nothing more than the trunk of a tree, or a post set up\r\nfor the practice of young beginners in chivalry. Afterwards a staff, or\r\nspear, was fixed in the earth, and a shield, hung upon it, was the mark\r\nto strike at. The dexterity of the performer consisted in smiting the\r\nshield in such a manner as to break the fastening and to bring it to\r\nthe ground. In process of time, this diversion was much improved;\r\ninstead of the staff and shield, a grotesque wooden figure was\r\nintroduced, and it was so contrived to move upon a pivot, that if it\r\nwere struck unskilfully, it would turn out and give the performer a\r\nsevere blow. The quintain which the major had prepared for the present\r\noccasion consisted of a wooden figure, fixed upon a pivot, and holding\r\nin its outstretched arm a bag of flower. Those who ran at it, and\r\nmissed it, were of course laughed at; while those who struck the figure\r\nfull with his lance gave the beam a sudden whirl; and unless he was\r\nvery nimble, was covered with flower from the bag which was thus\r\nbrought into contact with him.\r\n\r\nThe reader must now be contented to retire from the scene of frolic,\r\nand leave the villagers to the undisturbed enjoyment of their jollity.\r\nThe major and his party returned to the house, where they remained\r\nuntil the hour approached at which the fire-works were to be\r\ndischarged, and the festivities of the day concluded. Mr. Seymour\r\naccompanied his children to the stage, erected for the pyrotechnic\r\nexhibition, in order that he might explain the construction of the\r\nfire-works before they witnessed them in action.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, the major has provided most liberally for our\r\nentertainment!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour, as he ascended the steps which\r\nled to the platform. “I declare there is a forest of _rockets_! and\r\nwhat magnificent _Pin-wheels, Tourbillions, Marroons, Pots des\r\nAigrettes, Gerbes, Courantins, and Roman Candles_.”\r\n\r\n“Are those paper cylinders, with long sticks, rockets?” enquired Tom.\r\n\r\n“They are; and if you will attend to me, I will explain the principle\r\nof their construction. They have ever been considered as holding the\r\nfirst place amongst single fire-works, and deservedly so; not only on\r\naccount of the splendid appearance they present when fired by\r\nthemselves, but from their extensive application in increasing the\r\nbeauty of other exhibitions. The rocket, you perceive, consists of a\r\nstrong paper cylinder, which is filled with a suitable composition; it\r\nis crowned with a head, or ‘_pot_,’ as it is technically termed,\r\ncharged with various materials, which throws out sparks, stars, and\r\nother decorations, as soon as it takes fire in the air, after the body\r\nof the rocket has been consumed. You may observe that the head is made\r\nto terminate in a point, which greatly facilitates its passage through\r\nthe air. The whole is affixed to a straight stick, which, like the\r\nrudder of a ship, makes it turn to that side towards which it is\r\ninclined, and consequently causes the rocket to ascend in a straight\r\nline.”\r\n\r\n“But, papa,” observed Louisa, “all the rockets have not straight rods;\r\nsee, there is one, with a crooked stick.”\r\n\r\n“That is for the purpose of causing the rocket to ascend in the form of\r\na screw: the first effect of the bent rod will be to make the rocket\r\nincline towards that side to which it is bent; but its centre of\r\ngravity bringing it afterwards into a vertical situation, the result of\r\nthese two opposite efforts will be, that the rocket will ascend in a\r\nzig-zag or spiral form. In this case, however, since it displaces a\r\ngreater volume of air, and describes a longer line, it will not ascend\r\nso high as if it had been impelled in a straight direction; but I think\r\nyou will admit that, on account of the singularity of this motion, it\r\nproduces a very agreeable effect.”\r\n\r\n“And what causes the rocket to ascend into the air?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“It is a subject which has engaged the attention of several most\r\ndistinguished philosophers; the explanation, however, offered by Dr.\r\nHutton appears to me to be the most satisfactory. He says, ‘that at the\r\nmoment when the powder begins to inflame, its expansion produces a\r\ntorrent of elastic fluid, which acts in every direction; that is,\r\nagainst the air which opposes its escape from the cartridge, and\r\nagainst the upper part of the rocket; but the resistance of the air is\r\nmore considerable than the weight of the rocket, on account of the\r\nextreme rapidity with which the elastic fluid issues through the neck\r\nof the rocket to throw itself downwards, and therefore the rocket\r\nascends by the excess of the one of these forces over the other.’”\r\n\r\nTom observed, that he thought Dr. Hutton’s explanation very simple and\r\nplausible.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Hutton adds,” continued Mr. Seymour, “that the rocket could not\r\nrise unless a sufficient quantity of elastic fluid were produced, and\r\nhence arose the expedient of piercing the rocket with a conical hole,\r\nso as to make the composition burn in conical strata, which, having\r\nmuch greater surface, produce a much greater quantity of inflamed\r\nmatter and elastic fluid. Without such a contrivance, the composition\r\nwould inflame only in circular coats of a diameter equal to that of the\r\nrocket; and experience has shown that this is not sufficient for the\r\npurpose. Some years ago a plan was suggested for producing the\r\npropulsion of a vessel in this way; by the force of a steam-engine, a\r\nstream of water was to be shot out of the stern, the impulse of which,\r\nupon the water in the river, was to push forward the boat. It is a\r\ncurious fact, that Nature has employed the same expedient for the\r\nmotion of some aquatic insects. The larva of the dragon-fly, according\r\nto Adams, swims forward by ejecting water from its tail.”\r\n\r\n“What are those fire-works, attached to the lines?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Those, my dear, are line-rockets, or _courantines_,[81] and which,\r\ninstead of rising into the air, run along the line, to which they are\r\nattached by means of a hollow cylinder. Their motion is to be explained\r\nupon the same principle as that of the sky-rocket; a force is generated\r\nby the escape of elastic matter, and as the rocket is confined to the\r\nrope, it is made to run along the line, instead of ascending into the\r\nair.”\r\n\r\n“That is clear enough,” said Louisa; “but see, papa, there is the\r\nfigure of a dragon on yonder rope!”\r\n\r\n“That is merely a runner for the courantine, which is constructed in\r\nthat form, for the purpose of rendering the exhibition more surprising.\r\nI dare say it is filled with various compositions, such as golden rain,\r\nand fires of different colours, which will greatly heighten the effect:\r\nindeed this pyrotechnic amusement may be infinitely varied.”\r\n\r\n“Are not those _pin-wheels_, which are elevated above the railing?”\r\nsaid Tom.\r\n\r\n“Yes; they are pin or Catharine wheels, and if you will look at them,\r\nyou will perceive that they are of very simple construction; consisting\r\nmerely of a long paper tube, filled with inflammable matter, and rolled\r\nround a small circle of wood, so as to form a helix or spiral line.”\r\n\r\n“The circle of wood, I suppose, is pierced in the middle for the\r\npurpose of receiving a pin, by which the wheel is attached to the\r\npost,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Exactly so; and the cause of their revolution is the same as that\r\nwhich produces the flight of the rocket; the impulse of the air forces\r\nback the ignited part of the wheel, which generates, as it were, a\r\ncentrifugal force, while the attachment of the pipe, by preventing its\r\nobeying such a force, may be said to represent the centripetal force,\r\nand thus is the revolution of the wheel continued, until the whole of\r\nthe composition is consumed.”\r\n\r\n“I think you told us, when speaking of the thaumatrope,[82] it was the\r\nrapidity with which the flame revolved, that occasioned the star-like\r\nappearance which is exhibited by this fire-work,” observed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, my dear; it cannot be otherwise.”\r\n\r\nThe party now examined the remaining specimens of the pyrotechnic art.\r\nMr. Seymour informed them that _marroons_ were nothing more than small\r\ncubical boxes, filled with a composition proper for making them burst,\r\nand thence producing a loud report. He said that they were principally\r\nused in combination with other pieces, or to form a battery, in which,\r\nby different lengths of quick match, they were made to explode at\r\ndistinct intervals. Mr. Seymour added, that when the cases were made\r\ncylindrical, instead of being cubical, they exchanged the name of\r\nmarroon for that of _saucisson_. Louisa enquired the nature of certain\r\ncylindrical cases she observed on the stage, and was informed that they\r\nwere _gerbes_, a species of fire-work, which throws up a luminous and\r\nsparkling jet of fire, and from a supposed resemblance to a\r\nwater-spout, has derived the appellation of _gerbe_. Mr. Seymour next\r\npointed out to Tom a row of _Roman candles_, some of which were fixed\r\nquite perpendicular, others inclining at different angles, so that the\r\nballs might be projected to various distances, and thus produce a more\r\nvaried effect. He observed, that, to his taste, it was by far the most\r\nbeautiful fire-work ever exhibited.\r\n\r\n“I am quite impatient for the exhibition,” cried Tom; “pray, papa, what\r\nis the hour? I think it was determined to let them off at ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“It is now about eight o’clock; we will, therefore, return to the\r\nhouse: we shall, however, I suspect, have a curious sight to witness in\r\nour way through the fair; for by this time every booth is illuminated.”\r\n\r\nThe scene was indescribably beautiful, and might be said to resemble an\r\nenchanted island. The trees were lighted up with an endless profusion\r\nof Chinese lanterns, of various colours, and decorated with fantastic\r\ntransparencies, which produced an effect highly graceful and pleasing.\r\nThe booths were richly studded with lights; and, near the platform, on\r\nwhich the villagers were enjoying the country dance, was erected a\r\npyramid, which blazed with several hundred variegated lamps.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock the commencement of the fire-works was announced by a\r\nshower of rockets. The music ceased; and the dancers, together with the\r\nspectators who had gathered around the platform, hastened to the spot,\r\nwhither they were summoned by the sound of trumpets, to witness the\r\npyrotechnic entertainment which was to crown the festivities of the day.\r\n\r\nThe little Seymours had been stationed by their father in the most\r\nfavourable spot for seeing the exhibition; and highly were the major\r\nand his party delighted with the observations which fell from the\r\nintelligent children on the occasion.\r\n\r\n“Observe, Louisa, the rocket as it ascends describes a parabola,”[83]\r\ncried Tom.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how extremely beautiful! see, the head has burst, and is\r\ndischarging a number of brilliant stars! What is that red spark which\r\nis now falling to the ground, papa?”\r\n\r\n“That is the ignited stick of the rocket,” replied his father.\r\n\r\n“Take care, Louisa, do not hold your face up,” exclaimed Tom; “for as\r\nthe rocket bursts over our heads, the stick may fall upon us.”\r\n\r\n“I scarcely expected such an observation from you, Tom,” said his\r\nfather, “after the sensible remark you just made respecting the\r\nparabolic path of the rocket; do not you remember, that when a\r\nprojectile has reached its greatest altitude, it will descend in a\r\ncurve similar to that in which it ascended?”\r\n\r\n“True, true,” answered Tom; “I see my error; the stick must, of course,\r\nfall at a considerable distance from us.”\r\n\r\n“Look! look!! There goes a _courantine_: how it ran along the rope!”\r\nexclaimed Louisa.\r\n\r\n“There goes another!” cried Tom; “and see, it is the dragon; and I\r\ndeclare there is another running in an opposite direction;--they meet.\r\nLook at the serpents which they discharge from their mouths! Now they\r\nreturn to the extremity of the line with great violence. What an\r\nexplosion!!!”\r\n\r\nIn like manner were next exhibited two ships, which, being filled with\r\nserpents, were made to pour their broadsides at each other.\r\n\r\n“I never saw better courantines in my life,” said Mr. Seymour; “the\r\nmajor really conducts the exhibition with great skill; it does him\r\ninfinite credit as an engineer.”\r\n\r\n“See--see, papa! what a large wheel of fire!” exclaimed Tom, “and the\r\nfigure of a man in the centre.”\r\n\r\n“A classical device of the vicar beyond all doubt. It is Ixion on a\r\nwheel encompassed by hissing serpents,” observed his father.\r\n\r\nThis conjecture was soon verified, for the vicar with his usual\r\nanimation was heard to exclaim--\r\n\r\n                   ________“tortosque Ixionis angues,\r\n                   Immanemque rotam,”\r\n\r\nas Virgil has it.\r\n\r\nAnother shower of rockets succeeded, and the air resounded with the\r\napplause of the populace.\r\n\r\n(Bang)--(bang)--(bang)--\r\n\r\n“There go the marroons,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nThe band now struck up a march, and the major completely succeeded, by\r\nhaving arranged different lengths of quick match, in making them\r\nexplode at appropriate intervals, so as to mark correctly the\r\ncommencement of each bar of the music which was performing.\r\n\r\n“Bravo! bravo!” exclaimed Mr. Seymour; “had Handel witnessed such an\r\neffect, he would have engaged the major as a performer in his grand\r\nchoruses.”\r\n\r\n“See! what a beautiful fountain of fire--there! now a most brilliant\r\nstar is ejected!”--\r\n\r\n“It is a Roman candle,” said Mr. Seymour.\r\n\r\nA variety of different rockets were next exploded; such as “_Towering_\r\nrockets,” so called from their ascending to a greater height than any\r\nothers; an effect which is produced by fixing a smaller rocket on the\r\ntop of another of superior dimensions; “_Honorary_ rockets,” which,\r\nwhen they attain their greatest height, communicate fire to other\r\nrockets affixed to them in a transverse direction, and thus produce a\r\nrapid revolution, and represent, on their return to the ground, a\r\nspiral of descending fire; “_Caduceus_ rockets,” so called from their\r\nresemblance, when in action, to the rod borne by Mercury: the effect is\r\nproduced by firing two rockets obliquely on the opposite sides of a\r\nrod, so that they shall form in their flight two spiral lines.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to enumerate the series of beautiful exhibitions\r\nwhich succeeded; we shall only add, that the concluding fire-work was a\r\nCatharine-wheel of imposing splendour. After having repeatedly changed\r\nits device and colours during its revolution, it at length exploded and\r\nthrew out a group of serpents; the dense volume of smoke which followed\r\nthis explosion, gradually cleared off, and the appropriate motto of\r\n“FAREWELL,” appeared in brilliant letters of red fire.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, the populace began to separate; they had, however,\r\nscarcely arrived at the gate of the park, when a large rocket ascended,\r\nand bursting over their heads, discharged a parachute, to which was\r\nattached a brilliant light; eight similar rockets were successively\r\nfired, and with the same effect. The major had ingeniously contrived,\r\nby varying the angle, to disengage the floating luminaries in the form\r\nof a crown or circle, which threw a blazing light over the whole\r\ncountry; nor did it fade until sufficient time had been allowed for the\r\nreturn of the villagers to their respective homes.\r\n\r\nShould our readers have fortunately been infected with a portion of\r\nthat good humour and hilarity which elated the hearts of the spectators\r\nupon this memorable occasion, we may conclude our labours with the\r\ncheering hope that they will receive a favourable reception at the\r\ntribunal of public opinion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Floating luminary.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  Σκηνὴ\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  See p. 69.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  See p. 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  It is to this latter circumstance that the Panorama is principally\r\n  indebted for its magical effects.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Sir David Brewster has enumerated various extraordinary illusions,\r\n  which may be thus produced, in his Work on Natural Magic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  Ovid’s Metamorphoses, 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  Page 138.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  From the French term _courant_, signifying running.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  See page 344.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  A scientific critic has offered the following just remark upon this\r\n  passage. “The rocket ascends by a constantly acting force, not by a\r\n  momentary impulse, as though it were shot from a gun. Supposing the\r\n  force arising from combustion to be proportionate to the weight of\r\n  the rocket, as long as the force continues to be generated, the\r\n  rocket must move in a straight line; after which, having only its own\r\n  momentum to oppose its gravitation, it will proceed in a parabolic\r\n  curve.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ADDITIONAL NOTES;\r\n\r\n                      ADDRESSED MORE ESPECIALLY TO\r\n\r\n                        PARENTS AND PRECEPTORS,\r\n\r\n                                 OR TO\r\n\r\n                       THOSE ADVANCED IN SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CONTENTS OF THE NOTES.\r\n\r\n         _Note_ _Page_\r\n\r\n           1.     409.

Cur etiam altius spectas, ipsumque cœlum\r\nscrutatis? Habes ante pedes tuos ecce Vergilias.”--_Hist. Nat._ lib.\r\nxviii. c. 27.\r\n\r\nLinnæus enumerates forty-six flowers which possess this kind of\r\nsensibility. The following are a few of them, with their respective\r\nhours of rising and setting, as the Swedish naturalist terms them. He\r\ndivides them into _meteoric_ flowers, which less accurately observe the\r\nhour of unfolding, but are expanded sooner or later, according to the\r\ncloudiness, moisture, or pressure of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n2nd. _Tropical_ flowers, which open in the morning, and close before\r\nevening every day; but the hour of the expanding becomes earlier or\r\nlater, as the length of the day increases or decreases.\r\n\r\n3rd. _Equinoctial flowers_, which serve for the construction of Flora’s\r\ndial, since they open at a certain and exact hour of the day, and for\r\nthe most part close at another determinate hour: for instance, the\r\n_Leontodon Taraxacum_, dandelion, opens at 5-6, closes at 8-9;\r\n_Hieracium Pilosella_, mouse-ear hawkweed, opens at 8, closes at 2;\r\n_Tragopogon pratensis_, yellow goat’s-beard, opens at sunrise, and\r\nshuts at noon with such regularity, that the husbandman who adopts it\r\nas the signal of dinner-time need not fear to have his pudding too much\r\nor too little boiled; _Sonchus lævis_, smooth sow-thistle, opens at 5,\r\ncloses at 11-12; _Lactuca sativa_, cultivated lettuce, opens at 7,\r\ncloses at 10; _Tragopogon luteus_, yellow goat’s-beard, opens at 3-5,\r\ncloses at 9-10; _Lapsana_, nipplewort, opens at 5-6, closes at 10-11;\r\n_Nymphæaalba_, white water-lily, opens at 7, closes at 5; _Papaver\r\nnudicaule_, naked poppy, opens at 5, closes at 7; _Hemerocallis fulva_,\r\ntawny day-lily, opens at 5, closes at 7-8; _Convolvulus_, opens at 5-6;\r\n_Malva_, mallow, opens at 9-10, closes at l; _Arenaria purpurea_,\r\npurple sandwort, opens at 9-10, closes at 2-3; _Anagallis_, pimpernel,\r\nopens at 7-8; _Portulaca hortensis_, garden purslain, opens at 9-10,\r\ncloses at 11-12; _Dianthus prolifer_, proliferous pink, opens at 8,\r\ncloses at 1; _Cichoreum_, succory, opens at 4-5; _Hypocharis_, opens at\r\n6-7, closes at 4-5; _Crepis_, opens at 4-5, closes at 10-11; _Picris_,\r\nopens at 4-5, closes at 12; _Calendula Africana_, opens at 7, closes at\r\n3-4, &c.\r\n\r\n                 “Thus in each flower and simple bell,\r\n                    That in our path betrodden lie,\r\n                  Are sweet remembrancers who tell\r\n                    How fast the winged moments fly.”\r\n\r\nIn like manner may be formed a _calendar_ of Flora: thus, if we\r\nconsider the time of putting forth leaves, the _honeysuckle_ protrudes\r\nthem in the month of January; the _gooseberry_, _currant_ and _elder_,\r\nin the end of February, or beginning of April; the _oak_ and _ash_ in\r\nthe beginning, or towards the middle of May, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Note 2, p. 32.--GRAVITY AND CENTRIFUGAL FORCE.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be asked how this decrease of weight could have been\r\nascertained; since, if the body under examination decreased in weight,\r\nthe weight which was opposed to it in the opposite scale must also have\r\ndiminished in the same proportion; for instance, that if the lump of\r\nlead lost two pounds, the body which served to balance it must also\r\nhave lost the same weight, and therefore that the different force of\r\ngravity could not be detected by such means. It is undoubtedly true\r\nthat the experiment in question could not have been performed with an\r\nordinary pair of scales, but by using a spiral spring it was easy to\r\ncompare the force of the lead’s gravity at the surface of the earth,\r\nand at four miles high, by the relative degree of compression which it\r\nsustained in those different situations. We may take this opportunity\r\nof observing, that as the force of gravity varies directly as the mass,\r\nor quantity of matter, a body weighing a pound on our earth would, if\r\ntransferred to the sun, weigh 27-3/4 pounds; if to Jupiter, 3-1/10\r\npounds; if to Saturn, 1-1/9; but, if to the moon, more than three\r\nounces.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the effect of the centrifugal force as alluded to in\r\nthe text, it may be here observed, that it has been found by\r\ncalculation that, at the equator, the diminution of gravity occasioned\r\nby the centrifugal force arising from the rotation of the earth,\r\namounts to about the 289th part. But since this number is the square of\r\n17, it follows, that, if our globe turned more than 17 times faster\r\nabout her axis, or performed the diurnal revolution within the space of\r\n84 minutes, the centrifugal force would predominate over the powers of\r\ngravitation, and all the fluid and loose matters would, near the\r\nequinoctial boundary, have been projected from the surface. On such a\r\nsupposition the waters of the ocean must have been drained off, and an\r\nimpassable zone of sterility interposed between the opposite\r\nhemispheres. By a similar calculation, combined with that decreasing\r\nforce of gravity at great distances from the centre, it may be\r\ninferred, that the altitude of our atmosphere could never exceed 26,000\r\nmiles. Beyond this limit, the equatorial portion of air would have been\r\nshot into indefinite space. If it were possible to fire off a cannon\r\nball with a velocity of five miles in a second, and the resistance of\r\nthe air could be taken away, it would for ever wheel round the earth,\r\ninstead of falling upon it; and supposing the velocity to reach the\r\nrate of seven miles in a second, the ball would fly off from the earth,\r\nand be never heard of more.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 3, p. 35.--VELOCITY OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible so to strain the imagination as to conceive the\r\nvelocity with which light travels. “What mere assertion will make any\r\nman believe,” asks Sir W. Herschel, “that in one second of time, in one\r\nbeat of the pendulum of a clock, a ray of light travels over 192,000\r\nmiles, and would therefore perform the tour of the world in about the\r\nsame time that it requires to wink with our eyelids, and in much less\r\nthan a swift runner occupies in taking a single stride?” Were a cannon\r\nball shot directly towards the sun, and it were to maintain its full\r\nspeed, it would be twenty years in reaching it, and yet light travels\r\nthrough this space in seven or eight minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Note 4, p. 36.--VELOCITY OF FALLING BODIES.\r\n\r\nIn order to perform this experiment with the highest degree of\r\naccuracy, a body of considerable specific gravity should be selected,\r\nsuch as lead or iron; for a common stone experiences a considerable\r\nretardation in falling, from the action of the air. Where the arrival\r\nof the body at the bottom of the cavern to be measured cannot be seen,\r\nwe must make allowance in our calculation for the known velocity of\r\nsound; thus, suppose a body were ascertained to fall in five seconds.\r\nAs a heavy body near the earth’s surface falls about 16-1/12 feet in\r\none second of time, or for this purpose 16 feet will be sufficiently\r\nexact; and as sound travels at the rate of 1142 feet per second,\r\nmultiply together 1142, 16, and 5, which will give 91360, and to four\r\ntimes this product, or 365440, add the square of 1142, which is\r\n1304164, and the sum will be 1669604; then if from the square root of\r\nthe last number = 1292 the number 1142 be subtracted, the remainder 150\r\ndivided by 32 will give 4.69 for the number of seconds which elapsed\r\nduring the fall of the body; if this remainder be subtracted from 5,\r\nthe number of seconds during which the body was falling and the sound\r\nreturning, we shall have 0.31 for the time which the sound alone\r\nemployed before it reached the ear; and this number multiplied by 1142,\r\nwill give for product 354 feet equal the depth of the well. This rule,\r\nwhich, it must be allowed, is rather complex, is founded on the\r\nproperty of falling bodies, which are accelerated in the ratio of the\r\ntimes, so that the spaces passed over increase in the square of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe following is a more simple but less accurate rule. Multiply 1142 by\r\n5, which gives 5710; then multiply also 16 by 5, which gives 80, to\r\nwhich add 1142, this gives 1222, by which sum divide the first product\r\n5710, and the quotient 4.68 will be the time of descent, nearly the\r\nsame as before. This taken from 5, leaves 0.32 for the time of the\r\nascent; which, multiplied by 1142, gives 365 for the depth, differing\r\nbut little from the former more exact number.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Note 5, p. 38.--HYDROMANCY.\r\n\r\nThis superstition still prevails in many parts of England, especially\r\nin Cornwall, where the peasants on certain days of the year assemble at\r\nthe springs, or holy wells, and, in the manner stated in the text,\r\nproceed to settle such doubts and enquiries as will not let the idle\r\nand anxious rest. Here, therefore, they come, and, instead of allaying,\r\ndeservedly feed their uneasiness; the supposed responses serving\r\nequally to increase the gloom of the low-spirited, the suspicions of\r\nthe jealous, and the passion of the enamoured. The superstition,\r\nhowever, is sanctioned by the highest antiquity. The Castalian\r\nfountain, and many others among the Grecians, were supposed to be of a\r\nprophetic nature. By dipping a fair mirror into a well, the Patræans of\r\nGreece received, as they supposed, some notice of ensuing sickness or\r\nhealth from the various figures portrayed upon the surface. In Laconia\r\nthey cast into a pool, sacred to Juno, cakes of bread-corn; if they\r\nsank, good was portended; if they swam, something dreadful was to\r\nensue. Sometimes they threw three stones into the water, and formed\r\ntheir conclusions from the several turns they made in sinking. “From\r\nthe several waves and eddies which the sea, river, or other water\r\nexhibited,” says Dr. Borlase, “when put into agitation after a ritual\r\nmanner, the ancients pretended to foretell with great certainty the\r\nevent of battles; a way of divining recorded by Plutarch in his life of\r\nCæsar, and still usual among the vulgar in Cornwall; who go to some\r\nnoted well, at particular times of the year, and there observe the\r\nbubbles that rise, and the aptness of the water to be troubled, or to\r\nremain pure, on their throwing in pins or pebbles, and thence\r\nconjecture what shall or shall not befall them. The Druids also, as we\r\nhave great reason to think, pretended to predict future events, not\r\nonly from holy wells and running streams, but from the rain and snow\r\nwater, which, when settled, and afterwards stirred, either by oak-leaf\r\nor branch, or magic wand, might exhibit appearances of great\r\ninformation to the quick-sighted Druid, or seem so to do to the\r\ncredulous enquirer, when the priest was at full liberty to represent\r\nthe appearances as he thought most for his purpose.”--BORLASE’S\r\n_Antiquities of Cornwall_, p. 140.\r\n\r\nIn the islands of Scilly there is, or was some years since, a custom of\r\npropitiating fortune by certain ceremonies of this kind. An old\r\nislander regretted to a friend of the author the want of care with\r\nwhich such ceremonies had of late been conducted, and observed, as the\r\nconsequence, that “_they had no luck at all in the islands; not a wreck\r\nhad taken place for many months_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 6, p. 42.--COINS AND MEDALS.\r\n\r\nThe Latin word _moneta_, for money, is probably more modern than\r\n_pecunia_, and is said to be derived from _moneo_, to advise or mark,\r\nthat is, to show by some mark the weight and fineness of the metal of\r\nwhich coins were composed. Thus, according to Isidorus, “Moneta ita\r\nappellatur, quia monet nè qua fraus in pondere vel metallo fiat.” The\r\norigin of money seems to have been coeval with the first regulations of\r\ncivil society, or, at least, it is too remote to be traced by any\r\nauthentic history. Barter, that is the exchange of one commodity for\r\nanother, was the ordinary mode of traffic in the earlier periods of the\r\nworld; a practice which must soon have been discovered extremely\r\ninconvenient, and inadequate to the purposes of commerce; and hence the\r\ninvention of a common measure, or standard, according to which all\r\nother things should be estimated. Writers very generally agree in\r\nbelieving that the metals were first used for such a purpose, as being\r\nalmost the only substances whose goodness, and as it were integrity,\r\nwere not injured by partition; and which admitted of being melted, and\r\nreturned again into a mass of any size or weight. At first, it is\r\nprobable that each person cut his metal into pieces of different sizes\r\nand forms, according to the quantity to be given for any merchandize,\r\nor according to the demand of the seller, or the quantity stipulated\r\nbetween them; to this end they went to market, laden with metal, in\r\nproportion to the purchase to be made, and furnished with instruments\r\nfor apportioning it, and with scales for dealing it out, according as\r\noccasion required. By degrees it must have been found commodious to\r\nhave pieces ready weighed; and Mr. Pinkerton observes, that such were\r\nprepared without any stated form or impression, but merely regulated to\r\na certain weight; for _weight_ was the grand standard of ancient\r\ncoinage, so that all large sums were paid in weight, even down to the\r\nSaxon period of England. As in Greece the first estimation of money was\r\nmerely by weight, so was it in Rome. Silver was the metal first used in\r\nGrecian coinage, but copper in the Roman; the former metal having been\r\nlong known to the Romans. The first valuation of Roman money was by the\r\n_libra gravis æris_, or pound of heavy brass: and when by the progress\r\nof their conquests they obtained silver and gold, these were regulated\r\nin the same manner. Let us proceed one step farther in the history of\r\ncoins; it is easy to imagine that the growing commerce of money being\r\ndisturbed with frauds, both in the weight and the material, the\r\ninterposition of public authority became necessary, and that hence\r\narose the first stamps or impressions of money; to which succeeded the\r\nnames of the moneyers, and at length the effigy of the prince, the\r\ndate, legend, and other precautions to prevent the alteration of the\r\nspecies; and thus were coins completed. Gold and silver, in their pure\r\nor unmixed state, are too flexible to make coins sufficiently firm for\r\ngeneral use; and hence the necessity of mixing with them a certain\r\nproportion of some harder metal, and this mixture is called the\r\n_alloy_. The quality of this alloy has been always considered of great\r\nimportance with respect to the durability of coins. The most common\r\nmetal used for this purpose is copper; and sometimes, for gold, a\r\nmixture of silver and copper. In all well-regulated governments, there\r\nhas been a standard fixed by law; that is, a certain proportion between\r\nthe quantity of pure metal and its alloy. In England the standard for\r\ngold is 11/12, that is eleven parts of pure metal, and one part of\r\nalloy. The standard for silver is 37/40, a proportion which is said to\r\nhave been fixed in the reign of Richard I. by certain persons from the\r\neastern parts of Germany, called _Easterlings_; and hence the word\r\n_Sterling_, which was afterwards the name given to the silver penny,\r\nand which is now applied to all lawful money of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n_Penny_ is derived by Camden from _pecunia_, but others suppose that\r\nthe word is formed from _pendo_ to weigh, and the word has been\r\nsometimes written, according to this origin, _pending_. The ancient\r\nEnglish penny, or penig, or pening, was the first silver coin struck in\r\nEngland, and the only one current amongst our Saxon ancestors. Until\r\nthe time of Edward I. the penny was struck with a cross so deeply\r\nindented in it that it might be easily broken, and parted into two\r\npieces, thence called _half-pennies_, or into four, called\r\n_four-things_, or _farthings_; but that prince coined it without\r\nindenture; in lieu of which he first struck round half-pence and\r\nfarthings.\r\n\r\nBy the term MEDAL, we understand a piece of metal, in the form of a\r\ncoin, destined to preserve to posterity the portrait of some great man,\r\nor the memory of some illustrious action. They are distinguished by\r\ntheir different sizes; those of the larger size, or volume, are called\r\n_medallions_. _Medallets_ is a name given by Pinkerton to those small\r\npieces, or _missilia_, scattered among the people on solemn occasions;\r\nthose struck for the slaves in the Saturnalia, private counters for\r\ngaming, tickets for baths and feasts, tokens in copper and lead, and\r\nthe like. Medallions were certainly never intended to become current\r\ncoin, as some medals probably were; they were struck purely to serve as\r\npublic monuments, or to be presented by the emperor to his friends, and\r\nby the mint-makers to the emperor, as specimens of fine workmanship.\r\nThey were struck upon the commencement of the reign of a new emperor,\r\nand other solemn occasions; and frequently, especially the Greek\r\nmedallions, as monuments of gratitude, or of flattery. Sometimes they\r\nwere trial or pattern pieces, _testimonia probatæ monetæ_; and such\r\nabound after the reign of Maximilian, with the “Tres monetæ” on the\r\nreverse. It is observed, that all the Roman pieces in gold, exceeding\r\nthe _denarius aureus_; all in silver, superior to the _denarius_; and\r\nall in brass, superior to the _sestertius_, or what the medallist terms\r\nlarge brass, are comprehended under the description of medallions. Mr.\r\nPinkerton, however, thinks that the gold medallions, weighing two,\r\nthree, or four aurei only, passed in currency according to their size.\r\nMedallions from the time of Julius to that of Adrian, are very\r\nuncommon, and of very high price; from Adrian to the close of the\r\nwestern empire they are, generally speaking, less rare. The types of\r\nthe Roman medallions are often repeated upon common coin; hence they\r\nappear of less importance than the Greek; impressions of which are\r\nfrequently most uncommon, and nowhere else to be found. Many Roman\r\nmedallions have S.C., as being struck by order of the senate; those\r\nwithout these initials, were struck by order of the emperor. Of\r\nAugustus, a noble medallion was found in Herculaneum. There are\r\nmedallions of Augustus and Tiberius, struck in Spain; and one of Livia,\r\nat Patræ in Achaia. One in brass, of Antony and Cleopatra; reverse, two\r\nfigures in a car, drawn by sea-horses. Of Tiberius there are many; and\r\nalso of Claudius, Agrippina, Nero, Galba, Vespasian, and Domitian, &c.\r\nThe Greek medallions of Roman emperors are far more numerous than the\r\nRoman; with a few exceptions, however, all medallions are rare and of\r\nprincely purchase. Even in the richest cabinet, twenty or thirty\r\nspecimens are esteemed a respectable proportion.\r\n\r\nThe parts of a medal are the two sides, one whereof is called the\r\n_face_, _head_, or obverse; the other the _reverse_. On each side is\r\nthe _area_, or _field_; the _rim_, or _border_; and the _exergum_,\r\nwhich is beneath the ground, whereon the figures represented are\r\nplaced. On the two sides are distinguished the _type_, and the\r\n_inscription_, or _legend_. The type, or device, is the figure\r\nrepresented; the legend is the writing, especially that around the\r\nmedal; though in the Greek medals the inscription is frequently on the\r\narea. What we find in the exergum is, generally, no more than some\r\ninitial letters, whose meaning we are usually unacquainted with;\r\nthough, sometimes, they contain words that may be accounted an\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\nThe exergum sometimes contains the date of the coin, expressing in what\r\nconsulship of the emperor it was struck, as Cos. III. upon the reverse\r\nof an Antoninus. Sometimes it signifies the place where it was struck,\r\nand to which the coin properly belonged, as S. M. AL. for _Signata\r\nMoneta Alexandriœ_, upon the reverse of a Licinius. Sometimes the name\r\nof a province, the reduction of which the medal is designed to\r\ncelebrate; as Judæa on the reverse of a Vespasian. Medals usually have\r\ntheir figures in higher relief than coins.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that medals are of great importance to the study of\r\nhistory. They, indeed, furnish the principal proof of historic truth,\r\nas their evidence reaches to the most remote ages, as well as to the\r\nmost remote countries. Vaillant, in his learned history of the Syrian\r\nkings, printed at Paris, 1681, first fixed the dates, and arranged the\r\norder of events in ancient historians, by means of these infallible\r\nvouchers. Thus he was enabled to ascertain the chronology and progress\r\nof events of three of the most important kingdoms of the ancient world;\r\nviz. those of Egypt, of Syria, and of Parthia. The study of the Roman\r\nmedals has, in this respect, an advantage over that of Greek coins,\r\nsince they serve not only to illustrate the chronology of reigns, but\r\nto aid us in the interpretation of particular events. To this purpose,\r\nbesides the portrait of the prince, and date of his consulship, or of\r\nhis tribunitian power, we have a representation, or poetical symbol, of\r\nsome grand event on the reverse. In a word, the series of Roman coins\r\npresents the very best suite of documents relating to the Roman\r\nHistory. In addition to its historical importance, the medal is\r\nfrequently a useful guide to geography, natural history, architecture,\r\nancient monuments, busts, statues, ceremonies, and the like. See\r\nAddison’s _Dialogues on the Usefulness of Ancient Medals_. On this\r\nsubject, also, Pinkerton, in his valuable work on medals, has some\r\ninteresting remarks; he says that, to a man of poetical imagination,\r\nthe Roman coins must prove an ample source of intellectual delight, by\r\nmeans of the fine personifications and symbols which are to be found on\r\ntheir reverse. _Happiness_ has sometimes the caduceus, or wand of\r\nMercury, which Cicero tells us was thought to procure the gratification\r\nof every wish. In a gold coin of Severus, she has heads of poppy to\r\nexpress that our prime bliss lies in oblivion of misfortune. _Hope_ is\r\nrepresented as a sprightly damsel, walking quickly and looking\r\nstraightforward. With her left hand she holds up her garments, that\r\nthey may not hinder the rapidity of her pace; while, in her right hand,\r\nshe holds forth the bud of a flower, an emblem infinitely more\r\nbeautiful than the trite one of an anchor, which is the symbol of\r\nPatience, not of Hope. _Abundance_ is imaged as a sedate matron, with a\r\ncornucopiæ in her hands, of which she scatters the fruits over the\r\nground: but does not hold it up, and keep its contents to herself, as\r\nmany poets and painters have represented her. _Security_ stands leaning\r\non a pillar, indicative of her being free from all designs and\r\npursuits; and the posture itself corresponds to her name.\r\n\r\nCoins also present us with countries and rivers admirably personified.\r\nOn the reverse of a colonial coin, rude in execution, of Augustus and\r\nAgrippa, inscribed IMP. and DIVI. F., the conquest of Egypt is\r\nrepresented by the apposite metaphor of the crocodile, an animal almost\r\npeculiar to that country, and at that period esteemed altogether so,\r\nwhich is chained to a palm tree, at once a native of the country, and\r\nsymbolic of victory. Moreover, a cabinet of medals, of which Rubens is\r\nsaid to have possessed a very magnificent one, may be considered as\r\nforming the classic erudition of a painter. We may add, that almost all\r\nthe uses which connect the science of medals with painting, render it\r\nalso subservient to the art of the sculptor, who cannot less than\r\nprofit by the study of the Greek coins in particular. The connexion of\r\nthe study of ancient coins with architecture, consists in the views of\r\nmany of the ancient edifices, which are found in perfect preservation\r\non medals. Froelich observes, that the coins of Tarsus are very\r\nremarkable for a kind of perspective in the figures. On others are\r\nfound triumphal arches, temples, fountains, aqueducts, amphitheatres,\r\ncircuses, palaces, columns, obelisks, baths, sea-ports, pharoses, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nThe study of medals affords such a variety of amusement and of\r\ninstruction, that we may naturally suppose it to be nearly as ancient\r\nas medals themselves; and yet ancient writers do not furnish us with a\r\nsingle hint of collections of this kind. In the days of Greece, a\r\ncollection of such coins as then existed would not be regarded as an\r\nacquisition of any great value, because it must have consisted only of\r\nthose that were struck by the innumerable little states which then used\r\nthe Greek characters and language, and of course it would be considered\r\nas a kind of domestic coinage, precluded from extension by the narrow\r\nlimits of the intercourse that subsisted between different provinces\r\nand countries. As soon as any communication was opened between the\r\nRomans and the Greeks, the Grecian coins were imitated by the Roman\r\nworkmen, and preserved in the cabinets of their senators among the\r\nchoicest treasures. In a more advanced period of the Roman empire,\r\nindividuals must have formed collections of Roman coins; for we find\r\nthat a complete series of silver was lately found in our island,\r\ncontaining inclusively all the emperors down to Carausius. From the\r\ndecline of the Roman empire, most branches of science were enveloped in\r\ndarkness, till the revival of letters towards the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. When literature began to be cultivated in Italy, the study of\r\nmedals, connected with that of ancient erudition, began to engage\r\nattention. Accordingly Petrarch, who in modern times was amongst the\r\nfirst persons in Europe that aspired to the celebrity of learning and\r\ngenius, was likewise the first to revive the study of medals. This\r\neminent man, having been desired by the Emperor Charles V. to compose a\r\nbook that should contain a history of the coins of illustrious men, and\r\nto place him in the list, is said to have returned for answer, that he\r\nwould comply with his desire, whenever the Emperor’s future life and\r\nactions deserved it. Availing himself of this circumstance, he sent\r\nthat monarch a collection of gold and silver coins of celebrated men.\r\n“Behold!” said he, “to what men you have succeeded! Behold whom you\r\nshould imitate and admire! to whose very form and image you should\r\ncompose your talents! The invaluable present I should have given to no\r\none but yourself; it was due to you alone. I can only know or describe\r\nthe deeds of these great men: your supreme office enables you to\r\nimitate them.” In the next age, Alphonso, king of Arragon, caused all\r\nthe ancient coins that could be discovered throughout the provinces of\r\nItaly to be collected, which he placed in an ivory cabinet, and always\r\ncarried about with him, that he might be excited to great actions by\r\nthe presence, as it were, of so many illustrious men in their images.\r\n\r\nTo those who are desirous of gaining information upon this interesting\r\nbranch of antiquarian research, we strongly recommend Mr. Pinkerton’s\r\n_Essay on Medals_.\r\n\r\nHaving been led to offer these observations on ancient medals, we may,\r\nperhaps, be allowed to make one other digression on a subject naturally\r\nsuggested by a visit to the vicarage of our reverend antiquary. The\r\nreader has been told, that “around his house he had arranged several\r\nprecious relics, amongst which was an ancient cross, raised upon a\r\nplatform on three steps.”\r\n\r\nThere is much obscurity with regard to the origin and uses of these\r\nstone crosses. We are, however, not disposed to enter into a discussion\r\nof such difficulty; but the reader may be gratified in having presented\r\nto him, in one view, a collection of such crosses as still exist in\r\nvarious parts of Cornwall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two types of stone crosses.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Four more types of stone crosses.]\r\n\r\n\r\n          Note 7, p. 49.--BODIES REVOLVE ON THE SHORTER AXIS.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject, the reader is requested to turn to page 138, where\r\nit is stated that a body will permanently rotate only on its shortest\r\naxis. The philosophy of the fact is simply this--while a body revolves\r\non its axis, the component particles of its mass move in circles, the\r\ncentres of which are placed in the axis; a centrifugal force therefore\r\nis generated, which is resisted by the cohesion of the parts of the\r\nmass, and this tendency of each particle to fly off is expended in\r\nexciting a pressure upon the axis; and it is this strain which produces\r\nthe effect in question, the axis of no pressure being alone the\r\npermanent axis.\r\n\r\nVIS INERTIÆ, p. 59.--The criticism of the vicar upon this subject is\r\nscientifically judicious; but the literary reader who has justly\r\nappreciated his character, may be inclined to ask how it could have\r\nhappened that he should have overlooked the classical authority by\r\nwhich the expression is countenanced; we cannot answer the question,\r\nbut we will supply the deficiency. The connecting two ideas, which at\r\nfirst sight appear opposed to each other, constituted a figure of\r\nspeech much used both by the Greeks and Romans. Euripides delighted in\r\nit, which was a sufficient reason for Aristophanes to satirise it.\r\nHorace has given us several examples of it, as “_Insaniens\r\nsapientia_”--“_Strenua inertia_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Note 8, p. 62.--THE MECHANICAL POWERS.\r\n\r\nMechanical powers are simple arrangements by which we gain power at the\r\nexpense of time; thus, if a certain weight can be raised to a certain\r\nheight by unassisted strength, and the same thing is afterwards done\r\nwith one tenth part of the exertion, through the use of a mechanic\r\npower, it will be found to occupy ten times as much time. In many\r\ncases, however, loss of time is not to be put in competition with the\r\nability to do a thing; and since the advantages which the mechanical\r\npowers afford to man, by enabling him to perform feats which, without\r\ntheir assistance, would have been for ever beyond his reach, are\r\nincalculably great, the waste of time is overlooked, and is much more\r\nthan balanced in the general result. It is true, that if there are\r\nseveral small weights, manageable by human strength, to be raised to a\r\ncertain height, it may be full as convenient to elevate them one by\r\none, as to take the advantage of the mechanical powers in raising them\r\nall at once; because the same time will be necessary in both cases: but\r\nsuppose we should have an enormous block of stone, or a great tree, to\r\nraise; bodies of this description cannot be separated into parts\r\nproportionable to the human strength without immense labour, nor,\r\nperhaps, without rendering them unfit for those purposes to which they\r\nare to be applied; hence then the great importance of the mechanical\r\npowers, by the use of which a man is able to manage with ease a weight\r\nmany times greater than himself.\r\n\r\nTo understand the principle of a mechanical power, we must revert to\r\nthe doctrine of momentum. It will be remembered, that a small ball,\r\nweighing only two pounds, and moving at the rate of 500 feet in a\r\nsecond, will produce as much effect as a cannon ball of ten pounds in\r\nweight, provided it only moved at the rate of 100 feet in the same\r\ntime; in like manner a ball weighing one pound may be made to balance\r\nanother of five pounds, by placing it five times farther from the\r\ncentre of motion; for in such a case, for every inch of space through\r\nwhich the large ball passes, the small one will traverse five inches,\r\nand will thus generate five times the momentum. This may be rendered\r\nstill more evident by turning to page 161, and note thereon, where the\r\n_see-saw_ is described, which, in fact, is a true mechanical power. It\r\nwill be at once evident, from an inspection of the figure, that the\r\nlesser boy will pass over a much greater space, in equal time, than the\r\ngreater boy, and thus generate more momentum, which compensates for his\r\ndefect in weight, and renders him a balance for his heavier\r\ncompanion.--_See note 23._\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 9, p. 76.--CENTRE OF GRAVITY.\r\n\r\nThose who have been in the habit of inspecting the works of the\r\nstatuary, must frequently have detected the art which he has displayed\r\nin imparting stability to his figures, by lowering their centre of\r\ngravity. The bronze figure of Achilles, in Hyde Park, affords a very\r\nstriking illustration of such ingenuity; it is evident, from the\r\nposition and height of the figure, that, had not a mass of matter been\r\nadded to its base, its stability would have been extremely precarious,\r\nsince the slightest movement might have thrown its line of direction\r\nbeyond the base; but the addition at the base renders such an accident\r\nimpossible, by lowering its centre of gravity. Other examples of\r\nsimilar contrivance are presented in several celebrated statues,\r\nwherein stability is ensured by the judicious distribution of the\r\ndraperies. In the celebrated statue of Peter at St. Petersburgh, the\r\nequilibrium of the mass is thus sustained by the introduction of a\r\nserpent twining upwards to his horse’s tail. The effect, however, is so\r\nunfortunate as to have given occasion for a wit to remark, “It is a\r\nvery fine horse, but what a pity that he should have worms!” Nor have\r\nour celebrated painters overlooked a principle, the neglect of which\r\nwould have withheld from the most symmetrical figures the charms of\r\nbeautiful proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Note 10, p. 93.--THE INDIAN BLOW-PIPE.\r\n\r\n“When a native of Macoushi goes in quest of feathered game, or other\r\nbirds, he seldom carries his bow and arrows. It is the _blow-pipe_ he\r\nthen uses. This extraordinary tube of death is, perhaps, one of the\r\ngreatest natural curiosities in Guiana. It is not found in the country\r\nof Macoushi. Those Indians tell you that it grows to the south-west of\r\nthem, in the wilds which extend betwixt them and the Rio Negro. The\r\nreed must grow to an amazing length, as the part the Indians use is\r\nfrom ten to eleven feet long, and no tapering can be perceived in it,\r\none end being as thick as the other. It is of a bright yellow colour,\r\nperfectly smooth both inside and out. It grows hollow; nor is there the\r\nleast appearance of a knot or joint throughout the whole extent. The\r\nnatives call it _ourah_. This, of itself, is too slender to answer the\r\nend of a blow-pipe; but there is a species of palma, larger and\r\nstronger, and common in Guiana, and this the Indians make use of as a\r\ncase, in which they put the _ourah_. It is brown, susceptible of a fine\r\npolish, and appears as if it had joints five or six inches from each\r\nother. It is called _samourah_, and the pulp inside is easily\r\nextracted, by steeping it for a few days in water. Thus the ourah and\r\nsamourah, one within the other, form the blow-pipe of Guiana. The end\r\nwhich is applied to the mouth is tied round with a small silk-grass\r\ncord, to prevent its splitting; and the other end, which is apt to\r\nstrike against the ground, is secured by the seed of the acuero fruit,\r\ncut horizontally through the middle, with a hole made in the end,\r\nthrough which is put the extremity of the blow-pipe. It is fastened on\r\nwith string on the outside, and the inside is filled up with wild\r\nbees-wax. The arrow is from nine to ten inches long. It is made out of\r\nthe leaf of a species of palm-tree, called _coucourite_, hard and\r\nbrittle, and pointed as sharp as a needle. About an inch of the pointed\r\nend is poisoned with the _wourali_. The other end is burnt, to make it\r\nstill harder, and wild cotton is put round it for about an inch and a\r\nhalf. It requires considerable practice to put on this cotton well. It\r\nmust just be large enough to fit the hollow of the tube, and taper off\r\nto nothing downwards. They tie it on with a thread of the silk-grass to\r\nprevent its slipping off the arrow.”\r\n\r\n“The Indians have shown ingenuity in making a quiver to hold the\r\narrows. It will contain from five to six hundred...\r\n\r\n“...With a quiver of poisoned arrows slung over his shoulder, and with\r\nhis blow-pipe in his hand, in the same position as a soldier carries\r\nhis musket, see the Macoushi Indian advancing towards the forest in\r\nquest of powises, maroudis, waracabas, and other feathered game.\r\n\r\n“These generally sit high up in the tall and tufted trees, but still\r\nare not out of the Indian’s reach; for this blow-pipe, at its greatest\r\nelevation, will send an arrow 300 feet. Silent as midnight he steals\r\nunder them, and so cautiously does he tread the ground, that the fallen\r\nleaves rustle not beneath his feet. His ears are open to the least\r\nsound, while his eye, keen as that of the lynx, is employed in finding\r\nout the game in the thickest shade. Often he imitates their cry, and\r\ndecoys them from tree to tree, till they are within range of his tube.\r\nThen, taking a poisoned arrow from his quiver, he puts it in the\r\nblow-pipe, and collects his breath for the fatal puff. About two feet\r\nfrom the end through which he blows, there are fastened two teeth of\r\nthe acouri, and these serve him for a sight. Silent and swift the arrow\r\nflies, and seldom fails to pierce the object at which it is sent.\r\nSometimes the wounded bird remains in the same tree where it was shot,\r\nand in three minutes falls down at the Indian’s feet. Should he take\r\nwing, his flight is of short duration; and the Indian, following the\r\ndirection he has gone, is sure to find him dead. It is natural to\r\nimagine that, when a slight wound only is inflicted, the game will make\r\nits escape. Far otherwise; the wourali poison almost instantaneously\r\nmixes with blood or water, so that if you wet your finger, and dash it\r\nalong the poisoned arrow in the quickest manner possible, you are sure\r\nto carry off some of the poison. Though three minutes generally elapse\r\nbefore the convulsions come on in the wounded bird, still a stupor\r\nevidently takes place sooner, and this stupor manifests itself by an\r\napparent unwillingness in the bird to move.” ...\r\n\r\n“The Indian, on his return home, carefully suspends his blow-pipe from\r\nthe top of his spiral roof; seldom placing it in an oblique position,\r\nlest it should receive a cast.”--WATERTON’S _Wanderings in South\r\nAmerica_, p. 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Note 11, p. 96.--PENDULUM AND SPRING.\r\n\r\nA clock is nothing more than a piece of machinery to maintain the\r\naction of the pendulum, and at the same time to count and register the\r\nnumber of its oscillations; and by that peculiar property, that one\r\nvibration commences exactly where the last terminates, no part of time\r\nis lost or gained in the juxtaposition of the units so counted.\r\n\r\nIf some extraneous force were not applied, in a clock or watch, to\r\nmaintain or perpetuate the natural vibrations of a pendulum, or\r\noscillations of a balance, they would soon come to rest, by reason of\r\nfriction in the mechanism, and the resistance opposed by the air to the\r\nparts in motion. This force, in the larger clocks, is usually a\r\nsuspended weight; but, in the portable clock and watch, it is a spring\r\ncoiled in a metallic box, that actuates the wheel-work by gradually\r\nunbending itself.\r\n\r\nIn the former of these cases, the weight is suspended by a cord or\r\nchain that is coiled round a cylinder when wound up, which cylinder\r\nbeing of uniform diameter throughout its length, is acted on by the\r\ncord, when fast at the interior end, by a similar force in every\r\nsituation; and, therefore, imparts through the train, connected with\r\nits great wheel, invariable impulses to the escapement-wheel, at every\r\nvibration of the pendulum; which pendulum receives therefrom such a\r\nslight push, as is just sufficient to restore the momentum which it\r\nloses from friction and the air’s resistance, and thus the uniform\r\nmotion of the pendulum is perpetuated. But when a spring is substituted\r\nfor a weight, it is clear that its agency cannot be uniform, since, as\r\nthe reader will learn by turning to page 101, it is a general law that\r\nelastic bodies, in the recovery of their form, after the removal of the\r\ncompressing force, exert a greater power at first than at last, so that\r\nthe whole progress of restoration is a _retarded_ motion. It,\r\ntherefore, became necessary to introduce some mechanical contrivance\r\nwhich might equalize such motion. This correction is effected by an\r\napparatus termed a FUSEE, and is nothing more than the application of\r\nthe wheel and axle; it is that conical barrel seen in most watches\r\nround which the chain coils in the act of winding up. When the fusee is\r\nfull of chain, or the watch is wound up, the spring, through the medium\r\nof the chain, will act upon its upper part, which being very near the\r\ncentre will give the spring but little power; but, as the spring\r\nuncoils and diminishes in strength, it will act upon a larger part of\r\nthe fusee, until at last it gets to the bottom of it, and consequently,\r\nif the several increasing grooves upon it are made to increase in the\r\nsame proportion as the power of the spring decreases, an equable force\r\nmust be obtained.\r\n\r\nSprings may be thus said to afford the means of _packing up_ force, to\r\nbe used whenever it is required. Mr. Babbage observes that the half\r\nminute which we daily devote to the winding up our watches is an\r\nexertion by which we _pack_ a quantity of force, which is gradually\r\nexpended during the ensuing twenty-four hours. Springs then will enable\r\nus to avail ourselves of inconstant and variable forces which must\r\notherwise remain incapable of useful application, and the period may\r\narrive when force will thus become an article of traffic, and machines\r\nbe sent to the windmill to be wound up. The manner in which force is\r\nconstantly allowed to run to waste is quite extraordinary in the\r\npresent advanced state of science. We need only look at the working of\r\nthe treadmill. The public are little aware of the enormous sums\r\nannually expended in towing vessels by steam from the Nore to the port\r\nof London; were floating treadmills established, the labour of those,\r\nupon whom punishment has been awarded, might be rendered available to\r\nthe most important interests; whereas, with the present system, not\r\nonly is this labour entirely lost, but is actually a source of expense,\r\nfor machines, with all the accompaniments of engineers, are provided to\r\ncounterbalance the force so uselessly generated.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Note 12, p. 97.--ELASTIC CHAIRS AND BEDS.\r\n\r\nThe elastic property of iron springs has been lately exemplified in a\r\nvery striking manner, by the invention of Pratt’s elastic chairs and\r\nbeds; which, instead of the usual stuffing of feathers, are filled with\r\niron wire!!! which is twisted into spiral form. Down itself cannot be\r\nmore gentle or springy; it yields to pressure, and yet never becomes\r\nlumpy: beds thus constructed have the advantage of not heating the\r\nbody; and, above all, they never require to be shaken or “made.” Had\r\nVulcan fortunately made such a discovery before his ejectment from\r\nOlympus, his wife, Venus, would surely never have treated him with that\r\ncontempt which mythologists have recorded of her; while her\r\npriestesses, the housemaids, must, in gratitude, have been bound to\r\nextend their protection to a benefactor, who could save them so much\r\ndaily labour. For particulars of this curious invention, the reader may\r\nconsult the _Literary Gazette_ for March 17, 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Note 13, p. 98.--DUCK AND DRAKE.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon has been explained as depending upon the inertia of the\r\nparts of matter, which renders a certain time necessary in order to\r\ncommunicate to any body a sensible motion; so that when a body, moving\r\nwith considerable velocity, meets with another of much greater size, it\r\nexperiences almost as much resistance as if the latter were fixed.\r\nNothing is easier to be divided than water; yet, if the palm of the\r\nhand be struck with some velocity against its surface, a considerable\r\ndegree of resistance, and even of pain, is experienced from it, as if a\r\nsolid body had been struck; nay, a musket ball, when fired against\r\nwater, is repelled and even flattened by it. In like manner, if we load\r\na musket with powder, and, instead of a ball, introduce a candle, and\r\nfire it against a board, the latter will be pierced by the candle end,\r\nas if by a ball. The cause of this phenomenon, no doubt, is, that the\r\nrapid motion with which the candle end is impelled, does not allow it\r\ntime to be flattened, and therefore it acts as a hard body.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Note 14, p. 99.--VEGETABLE ELASTICITY.\r\n\r\n_Impatiens_, or _Touch me not_, affords a good example. The seed-vessel\r\nconsists of one cell with five divisions; each of these, when the seed\r\nis ripe, on being touched, suddenly folds itself into a spiral form,\r\nleaps from the stalk, and disperses the seeds to a great distance by\r\nits elasticity. The capsule of the geranium and the beard of wild oats\r\nare twisted for a similar purpose. (DARWIN’S _Botanic Garden_.) The\r\nseed-vessel of Euphorbia is extremely elastic, projecting the seeds\r\nwith great force. An elastic pouch also serves to scatter the seeds of\r\nthe Oxalis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 15, p. 125.--A SIMPLE ORRERY.\r\n\r\nA very instructive toy might be constructed by placing a taper in the\r\ncentre of a japanned waiter, to represent the sun, and fixing in a\r\nwatch glass an indian rubber ball, with the parallels of latitude and\r\nmeridians painted thereon, with the other characters of the globe.\r\nDuring its revolution around the candle, in consequence of the tendency\r\nof its centre of gravity to its lowest position, the diurnal and annual\r\nmotions, and also the parallelism of its axis, will be represented,\r\ntogether with the concomitant phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 16, p. 130.--CONIC SECTIONS.\r\n\r\nIf a cone, or sugar-loaf, be cut through in certain directions, we\r\nshall obtain figures which are termed _conic sections_; thus, if we cut\r\nthrough the sugar-loaf in a direction parallel to its base, or bottom,\r\nthe outline or edge of the loaf where it is cut will be a _circle_. If\r\nthe cut is made so as to slant, and not be parallel to the base of the\r\nloaf, the outline is an _ellipse_, provided the cut goes quite through\r\nthe sides of the loaf all round; but if it goes slanting, and parallel\r\nto the line of the loaf’s side, the outline is a _parabola_, a conic\r\nsection, or curve, to which this note more immediately relates. This\r\ncurve is distinguished by characteristic properties, every point of it\r\nbearing a certain fixed relation to a certain point within it, as the\r\ncircle does to its centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Note 17, p. 134.--EARTHQUAKE OF LISBON.\r\n\r\nDuring the dreadful earthquake of Lisbon, bands of wretches took\r\nadvantage of the general consternation to commit the most atrocious\r\nacts of robbery and murder. In fact, a considerable part of the city\r\nwas destroyed by incendiaries, who, during the disaster, set fire to\r\nthe houses, that they might pillage them with greater impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Note 18, p. 134.--GEOLOGY APPLIED TO AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nSoils consist of a mixture of different finely divided earthy matter,\r\nwith animal or vegetable substances in a state of decomposition. In\r\norder, therefore, to form a just idea of their nature, it is necessary\r\nto conceive different rocks decomposed, or ground into parts and powder\r\nof different degrees of fineness; some of their soluble parts dissolved\r\nby water, and that water adhering to the mass, and the whole mixed with\r\nlarger or smaller quantities of the remains of vegetables and animals,\r\nin different stages of decay. Hence it will follow, that certain rocks\r\nwill give origin to particular soils; thus poor and hungry soils, such\r\nas are produced from the decomposition of granite and sandstone, remain\r\nvery often for ages with only a thin covering of vegetation; while\r\nsoils from the decomposition of limestone, chalk, and basalt, are often\r\nclothed by nature with the perennial grasses; and afford, when ploughed\r\nup, a rich bed of vegetation for every species of cultivated plant. In\r\nadverting to this subject, Dr. Buckland, in his inaugural lecture, very\r\njustly observes, that it furnishes an instance of relation between the\r\nvegetable and mineral kingdoms, and of the adaptation of one to the\r\nother, which always implies design in the surest manner; for had not\r\nthe surface of the earth been thus prepared for their reception, where\r\nwould have been the use of all that admirable system of organization\r\nbestowed upon vegetables? And it is no small proof of design in the\r\narrangement of the materials that compose the surface of our earth,\r\nthat whereas the primitive and granitic rocks are least calculated to\r\nafford a fertile soil, they are for the most part made to constitute\r\nthe mountain districts of the world, which, from their elevation and\r\nirregularities, would otherwise be but ill adapted for human\r\nhabitation; whilst the lower and more temperate regions are usually\r\ncomposed of derivative or secondary strata, in which the compound\r\nnature of their ingredients qualifies them to be of the greatest\r\nutility to mankind by their subserviency to the purposes of luxuriant\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, then, can exist as to the important connexion between the\r\ngeological structure of a country, and its degree of fertility; but the\r\nsubject has not received the attention which it merits. And in the hope\r\nthat this note may meet the eye of some zealous geologist, the author\r\nsuggests the importance of commencing the enquiry in a primitive\r\ndistrict; for, as we advance from a primitive to an alluvial district,\r\nthe relations to which we have alluded become gradually less distinct\r\nand apparent, and are ultimately lost in the confused complication of\r\nthe soil itself, and in that general obscurity which necessarily\r\nenvelopes every object in a state of decomposition: we can, therefore,\r\nonly hope to succeed in such an investigation, by a patient and\r\nlaborious examination of a primitive country, after which we may be\r\nenabled to extend our enquiries with advantage through those districts\r\nwhich are more completely covered with soil, and obscured by luxuriant\r\nvegetation; as the eye, gazing upon a beautiful statue, traces the\r\noutline of the limbs, and the swelling contour of its form, through the\r\nflowing draperies which invest it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Note 19, p. 135.--BUCKLAND’S RESEARCHES.\r\n\r\nThe geological researches of Dr. Buckland have been long directed by a\r\ndesire to accumulate facts to prove that there must have been an\r\nuniversal inundation of the earth; and, in his inaugural lecture, he\r\nhas presented us with a summary of such facts, which, to use his own\r\nexpression, whether considered collectively or separately, present such\r\na conformity of proofs, tending to establish the universality of a\r\nrecent inundation of the earth, as no difficulties or objections that\r\nhave hitherto arisen are in any way sufficient to overrule.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1822, Dr. Buckland read a memoir before the Royal Society,\r\nannouncing the discovery of a singular cave at Kirkdale in Yorkshire,\r\ncontaining an assemblage of fossil teeth and bones of the elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, hippopotamus, bear, tiger, and hyæna, and sixteen other\r\nanimals; with a comparative view of five similar caverns in various\r\nparts of England, and others on the continent. For this important paper\r\nthe society awarded to its author their Copley medal; and it\r\nconstitutes the basis of a later and much more extended work, entitled\r\n“RELIQUIÆ DILUVIANÆ; or Observations on the Organic Remains contained\r\nin Caves, Fissures, and Diluvial Gravel; and on other Geological\r\nPhenomena, attesting the Action of an Universal Deluge. By the Rev. W.\r\nBUCKLAND, B.D. F.R.S. &c.”\r\n\r\nLet us explore the interior of this cavern. It was not till the summer\r\nof 1821, that the existence of any animal remains, or of the cavern\r\ncontaining them, was suspected. At this time, in continuing the\r\noperations of a large quarry, the workmen accidentally intersected the\r\nmouth of a long hole, closed externally with rubbish, and overgrown\r\nwith grass and bushes. As this rubbish was removed before any competent\r\nperson had examined it, it is not certain whether it was composed of\r\ndiluvial gravel and rolled pebbles, or was simply the debris that had\r\nfallen from the softer portions of the strata that lay above it: the\r\nworkman, however, who removed it, and some gentlemen who saw it,\r\nassured Dr. Buckland that it was composed of gravel and sand. In the\r\ninterior of the cavern, our indefatigable geologist could not find a\r\nsingle rolled pebble, nor has he ever seen one bone, or fragment of\r\nbone, that bore the slightest mark of having been rolled by the action\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nThe original entrance is said to have been very small, and, having been\r\nfilled up as above described, there could not have been any admission\r\nof external air through it to the interior of the cavern. Nearly 30\r\nfeet of its outer extremity have now been removed, and the present\r\nentrance is a hole in the perpendicular face of the quarry, about three\r\nfeet high and five feet broad, which it is only possible for a man to\r\nenter on his hands and knees, and which expands and contracts itself\r\nirregularly from two to seven feet in breadth, and two to fourteen feet\r\nin height. It is unnecessary to enter into farther details; the reader,\r\nif he wishes more minute information, may consult Dr. Buckland’s work.\r\n\r\nOn entering the cave, the first thing observed was a sediment of soft\r\nmud or loam, covering entirely its whole bottom to the average depth of\r\nabout a foot, and concealing the subjacent rock, or actual floor of the\r\ncavern. Not a particle of mud was found attached either to the sides or\r\nroof; nor was there a trace of it adhering to the sides or upper\r\nportions of the transverse fissures, or any thing to suggest the idea\r\nthat it had entered through them. The mud was covered by a\r\n_stalagmitic_ crust, which had been formed by the dripping of water\r\nimpregnated with calcareous matter, as is common in all the cavities of\r\nlimestone; but it is important to remark, that there was not any\r\nalternation of mud with any repeated beds of _stalagmite_, but simply a\r\npartial deposit of the latter on the floor beneath; so that the mud was\r\nencased, like meat in a pie, with an upper and under crust. It was\r\nchiefly in the lower part of the earthy sediment, and in the calcareous\r\nmatter beneath it, that the animal remains were found.\r\n\r\nIn the whole extent of the cave, only a very few large bones have been\r\ndiscovered that are tolerably perfect; most of them are broken into\r\nsmall angular fragments and chips, the greater part of which lay\r\nseparately in the mud, whilst others were wholly or partially invested\r\nwith stalagmite, and others again mixed with masses of still smaller\r\nfragments. In some few places, where the mud was shallow, and the heaps\r\nof teeth and bones considerable, parts of the latter were elevated some\r\ninches above the surface of the mud and its calcareous crust; and the\r\nupper ends of the bones thus projecting, like the legs of pigeons\r\nthrough a pie crust, into the void space above, have become thinly\r\ncovered with calcareous drippings, whilst their lower extremities have\r\nno such incrustation, and have simply adhering to them the mud in which\r\nthey have been imbedded.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the loam and stalagmite in preserving the bones from\r\ndecomposition, by protecting them from all access of atmospheric air,\r\nhas been very remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe workmen, in first discovering the bones at Kirkdale, supposed them\r\nto have belonged to cattle that died by a murrain in this district a\r\nfew years ago, and they were for some time neglected, and thrown on the\r\nroads with the common limestone; they were, at length, noticed by Mr.\r\nHarrison, a medical gentleman in the neighbourhood, and have since been\r\ncollected and deposited in various private and public museums. The\r\nteeth and bones which have been discovered in this cave appear to have\r\nbelonged to the _hyæna, tiger, bear, wolf, fox, weasel, elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, hippopotamus, horse, ox, deer, hare, rabbit, water-rat,\r\nmouse, raven, pigeon, lark, snipe_, and a small species of _duck_.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the cave, on first removing the mud, was found to be\r\nstrewed all over like a dog-kennel, from one end to the other, with\r\nhundreds of teeth and bones, or rather broken and splintered fragments\r\nof bones, of all the animals above enumerated; scarcely a single bone\r\nhas escaped fracture, with the exception of some of the more solid and\r\nhard bones of the foot; on some of these bones marks may be traced,\r\nwhich, on applying one to the other, appear exactly to fit the form of\r\nthe canine teeth of the hyæna that occur in the cave. The hyæna’s bones\r\nhave been broken, and apparently gnawed equally with those of the other\r\nanimals. Heaps of small splinters, and highly comminuted, yet angular\r\nfragments of bone, mixed with teeth of all the varieties of animals\r\nabove enumerated, lay in the bottom of the den, occasionally adhering\r\ntogether by calcareous cement. Not one skull is to be found entire; and\r\nit is so rare to find a large bone of any kind that has not been more\r\nor less broken, that there is no hope of obtaining materials for the\r\nconstruction of a single limb, and still less of an entire skeleton.\r\nThe jaw-bones, also, even of the hyænas, are broken to pieces like the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIt must already appear probable, from the facts above described,\r\nparticularly from the comminuted and gnawed condition of the bones,\r\nthat the cave at Kirkdale was, during a long succession of years,\r\ninhabited as a den by hyænas, and that they dragged into its recesses\r\nthe other animals, whose remains are found indiscriminately mixed with\r\ntheir own: an hypothesis which is certainly strengthened by Dr.\r\nBuckland having found the excrement of the animal in the same cave.\r\nShould it be asked why we do not find, at least, the entire skeleton of\r\nthe one or more hyænas that died last, and left no survivors to devour\r\nthem; we find a sufficient reply to this question, in the circumstance\r\nof the probable destruction of the last individuals by the waters of\r\nthe deluge. On the rise of these, had there been any hyænas in the den,\r\nthey would have rushed out, and fled for safety to the hills; and if\r\nabsent, they could not by any possibility have returned to it from the\r\nhigher levels; that they were extirpated by the catastrophe is obvious,\r\nfrom the discovery of their bones in the diluvial gravel both of\r\nEngland and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of these bones, then, appears to have been a process\r\nof years, whilst all the animals in question were natives of this\r\ncountry. The general dispersion of bones of the same animals through\r\nthe diluvial gravel of high latitudes, over a great part of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, shows that the period in which they inhabited\r\nthese regions was that immediately preceding the formation of this\r\ngravel, and that they perished by the same waters which produced it. M.\r\nCuvier has, moreover, ascertained that the fossil elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, and hyæna, belong to species now unknown; and as there is\r\nno evidence that they have at any time, subsequent to the formation of\r\nthe diluvium, existed in these regions, we may conclude that the period\r\nat which the bones of these extinct species were introduced into the\r\ncave at Kirkdale was before the deluge.\r\n\r\nThus the phenomena of this cave seem referable to a period immediately\r\nantecedent to the general deluge, and in which the world was inhabited\r\nby land animals, almost all bearing a generic, and many a specific\r\nresemblance to those which now exist; but so completely has the\r\nviolence of that tremendous convulsion destroyed and remodelled the\r\nform of the antediluvian surface, that it is only in caverns that have\r\nbeen protected from its ravages, that we may hope to find undisturbed\r\nevidence of events in the period immediately preceding it. The bones\r\nalready described, and the calcareous matter formed before the\r\nintroduction of the diluvial mud, are what Dr. Buckland considers to be\r\nthe products of the period in question. It was indeed probable, before\r\nthe discovery of this cave, from the abundance in which the remains of\r\nsimilar species occur in superficial gravel beds, which cannot be\r\nreferred to any other than a diluvial origin, that such animals were\r\nthe antediluvian inhabitants not only of this country, but generally of\r\nall those northern latitudes in which their remains are found, (but the\r\nproof was imperfect, as it was possible they might have been drifted or\r\nfloated hither by the waters from the warmer regions of the earth,) but\r\nthe facts developed in this charnel-house of the antediluvian forests\r\nof Yorkshire demonstrate that there was a long succession of years, in\r\nwhich the elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus had been the prey of\r\nthe hyænas, which, like themselves, inhabited England in the period\r\nimmediately preceding the formation of the diluvial gravel. Having thus\r\nfar described the principal facts to be observed in the interior of\r\nthis cave, Dr. Buckland proceeds to point out the chronological\r\ninferences that may be derived from the state of the bones, and of the\r\nmud and stalagmite that accompany them, and to extract the following\r\ndetail of events that have been going on successively within this\r\ncurious cave:--\r\n\r\nFirst, There appears to have been a period (and, if we may form an\r\nestimate from the small quantity of stalagmite now found on the actual\r\nfloor of the cave, a very short one,) during which this aperture in the\r\nrock existed in its present state, but was not tenanted by the hyænas.\r\n\r\nThe second period was that during which the cave was inhabited by the\r\nhyænas, and the stalactite and stalagmite were still forming.\r\n\r\nThe third period is that at which the mud was introduced and the\r\nanimals extirpated, viz. the period of the deluge. It has been already\r\nstated, that there is not any alternation of this mud with beds of bone\r\nor of stalagmite, such as would have occurred had it been produced by\r\nland floods often repeated; _once_, _and once only_, it appears to have\r\nbeen introduced; and we may consider its vehicle to have been the\r\nturbid waters of the same inundation that produced universally the\r\ndiluvial gravel.\r\n\r\nThe fourth period is that during which the stalagmite was deposited\r\nwhich invests the upper surface of the mud.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this note, we take the opportunity of recommending all\r\nthose who feel interested in the researches of geology, to read a work\r\nlately published, entitled “THE WONDERS OF GEOLOGY, by Gideon Mantell,\r\nLL.D. F.R.S. &c.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Note 20, p. 137.--THE RIFLE.\r\n\r\nRifle guns are those whose barrels, instead of being smooth on the\r\ninside, like our common pieces, are formed with a number of spiral\r\nchannels, resembling screws; except only that the threads, or rifles,\r\nare less deflected, making only one turn, or a little more, in the\r\nwhole length of the piece. This construction is employed for correcting\r\nthe irregularity in the flight of balls from smooth barrels, by\r\nimparting to the balls a rotatory motion perpendicular to the line of\r\ndirection. The same effect has lately been accomplished by an extremely\r\nsimple and obvious contrivance, and which will, probably, altogether\r\nsupersede the necessity of rifling the barrel. It consists in cutting a\r\nspiral groove in the bullet itself, which, when discharged, is thus\r\nacted upon by the air, and the same rotatory motion imparted to it as\r\nthat produced by the furrows in the barrel. But it is the rotatory\r\nmotion which steadies the flight of the ball; and by whichever method\r\nthis is produced, the theory of its action will be the same. It has\r\nbeen long and generally known, that when the common bullet is\r\ndischarged from a plane barrel, its flight is extremely irregular and\r\nuncertain; it has, for instance, been found, from the experiments of\r\nMr. Robins, that, notwithstanding the piece was firmly fixed, and fired\r\nwith the same weight of powder, the ball was sometimes deflected to the\r\nright, sometimes to the left, sometimes above, and at others below the\r\ntrue line of direction. It has also been observed, that the degree of\r\ndeflection increases in a much greater proportion than the distance of\r\nthe object fired at. It is not difficult to account for these\r\nirregularities; they, doubtless, proceed from the impossibility of\r\nfitting a ball so accurately to any plane piece, but that it will rub\r\nmore against one side of the barrel than another in its passage through\r\nit. Whatever side, therefore, of the muzzle, the ball is last in\r\ncontact with, on quitting the piece, it will acquire a whirling motion\r\ntowards that side, and will be found to bend the line of its flight in\r\nthe same direction, whether it be upwards or downwards, to the right or\r\nleft; or obliquely, partaking in some degree of both; and, after\r\nquitting the barrel, this deflection, though in the first instance but\r\ntrifling and inconsiderable, is still farther increased by the\r\nresistance of the air; this being greatest on that side where the\r\nwhirling motion conspires with the progressive one, and least on that\r\nside where it is opposed to it. Thus, if the ball, in its passage out,\r\nrubs against the left side of the barrel, it will whirl towards that\r\nside; and as the right side of the ball will, therefore, turn up\r\nagainst the air during its flight, the resistance of the air will\r\nbecome greatest on the right side, and the ball be forced away to the\r\nleft, which was the direction it whirled in. It happens, moreover, from\r\nvarious accidental circumstances, that the axis of the ball’s rotation\r\nfrequently changes its position several times during the flight; so\r\nthat the ball, instead of bending its course uniformly in the same\r\ndirection, often describes a track variously contorted. From this view\r\nof the causes of aberration in the flight of balls, it will be evident\r\nthat the only means of correcting it is by preventing the ball from\r\nrubbing more against one side of the barrel than another in passing\r\nthrough it; and by giving to the bullet a motion which will counteract\r\nevery accidental one, and preserve its direction, by making the\r\nresistance of the air upon the forepart continue the same during its\r\nwhole flight; that is, by giving it a rotatory motion perpendicular to\r\nthe line of direction. The contrivance for this purpose is called\r\n_rifling_, and consists, as we have before stated, in forming upon the\r\ninside of the barrel a number of threads and furrows, either in a\r\nstraight or spiral direction, into which the ball is moulded; and\r\nhence, when the gun is fired, the indented zone of the bullet follows\r\nthe sweep of the rifle, and thereby, besides its progressive motion,\r\nacquires a considerable one round the axis of the barrel, which motion\r\nwill be continued to the bullet after its separation from the piece, so\r\nthat it is constantly made to whirl round an axis coincident with the\r\nline of its flight. Many familiar examples of the utility and effect of\r\n_rifling_ might be here adduced. If the bricklayer, while unroofing a\r\nhouse, be observed, he will be seen to give to the slates which he\r\nthrows down a whirling motion, at a certain angle, which ensures their\r\nfalling edgeways on the ground, and thus preserves them from fracture.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the subject in the text, to which this note refers, may\r\nbe introduced a notice of the “BOMMERENG,” a missile used by the\r\nnatives of Australia, and thus described by Major Mitchell in his\r\n“_Journal of an expedition to the Rivers Darling and Murray._” “The\r\nbommereng, a thin, curved missile, about two feet four inches long, can\r\nbe thrown by a skilful hand so as to rise upon the wind with a rotatory\r\nmotion, and in a crooked direction towards any given point with great\r\nprecision, and to return, after a considerable flight, to within a yard\r\nor two of the thrower; or, by striking the ground near him, to bound so\r\nas to hit at a great, distance, “_en ricochet_” any object behind a\r\ntree. This singular weapon probably originated in the utility of such a\r\nmissile for the purpose of killing ducks, where they are very numerous,\r\nas on the interior rivers and lagoons, and where we accordingly find it\r\nmuch more in use than on the sea coast, and better made, being often\r\ncovered with good carving.” This instrument may now be purchased in\r\nmost of the London toy-shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Note 21, p. 144.--CENTRE OF PERCUSSION.\r\n\r\nIf a stick be held at one of its extremities, and allowed to fall on\r\nthe edge of a table, the farther end will rebound, or the hand will\r\nsustain a shock, unless it be struck exactly on the centre of\r\npercussion, in which case the stick will fall as a dead weight. The\r\nrepetition of this simple experiment will readily convey to the young\r\nphilosopher an idea of the nature of what is termed the _centre of\r\npercussion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Note 22, p. 150.--SPINNING OF THE TOP.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated in the text, that the gyrations of the top depend\r\nexactly upon the same principle as that which produces the _precession\r\nof the equinoxes_; viz. an unequal attractive force exerted upon the\r\nrevolving mass. In the one case, this is known to arise from the action\r\nof the sun and moon on the excess of matter about the equatorial\r\nregions of the earth; in the other, from the parts of the top being\r\nunequally affected by gravity, while it is spinning in an inclined or\r\noblique position. To those philosophers who have condescended to read\r\nthe present work, if there be any such, and are thereby induced to\r\npursue the investigation of a subject which has hitherto excited far\r\ntoo little attention, we beg to submit the following remarks:--\r\n\r\nIf a top could be made to revolve on a point without friction, and in a\r\nvacuum, in the case of its velocity being _infinite_, it would continue\r\nto revolve for ever, in the same position, without gyration. If the\r\nvelocity were _finite_, it would for ever remain unchanged in position,\r\nin the event of the centre of gravity being directly over the point of\r\nrotation. In any other position (supposing its velocity very great,\r\nalthough not infinite) there would arise a continued uniform gyration;\r\nthe line which passes through the point of rotation, and the centre of\r\ngravity, always making the same angle with the horizon, or describing\r\nthe same circle round the zenith. But in all artificial experiments the\r\ncircumstances are very remarkably changed; if, indeed, the centre of\r\ngravity happens to be situated perpendicularly over the point of\r\nrotation, the top will continue quite steady, or _sleeping_, as it is\r\ntermed, till nearly the whole of its velocity of rotation is expended.\r\nIn any other position the top begins to gyrate, but reclining at all\r\ntimes on the outside of its physical point of gyration, the top is\r\nuniformly impelled inwards; and this (when the velocity is\r\nconsiderable, and the point broad) acts with a force sufficient for\r\ncarrying the top towards its quiescent or _sleeping_ point; but when\r\nthe velocity is much diminished, this power becomes feeble, the\r\ngyrations increase in diameter, and the top ultimately falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Note 23, p. 161.--THE MECHANICAL POWERS.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical powers are all founded upon the principle that _the\r\nlengths of circles are in proportion to their diameters_; for it is an\r\nimmediate consequence of this property of the circle, that if a rod of\r\niron, or beam of wood, be placed on a point or pivot, so that it may\r\nmove round its prop, the two ends will go through parts of circles,\r\neach proportioned to that arm of the beam to which it belongs; the two\r\ncircles will be equal if the pivot is in the centre or middle point of\r\nthe beam; but if it is nearer one end than the other, say five times,\r\nthat end will pass through a circular space, or _arc_, five times\r\nshorter than the circular space the other end goes through in the same\r\ntime. If, then, the end of the long beam goes through five times the\r\nspace, it must move with five times the swiftness of the short end,\r\nsince both move in the same time; and, therefore, any force applied to\r\nthe long end must overcome the resistance of five times that force\r\napplied at the opposite end, since the two ends move in contrary\r\ndirections; hence one pound placed at the long end would balance five\r\nplaced at the short end.\r\n\r\nThe beam we have been describing constitutes the first of the\r\nmechanical powers, and is termed the LEVER. There are, besides, five\r\nothers, viz. the _wheel and axle_; the _inclined plane_; the _screw_;\r\nthe _pulley_; and the _wedge_; out of the whole, or a part of which, it\r\nwill be found that every mechanical engine or piece of machinery is\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nTHE LEVER being the simplest of all the mechanic powers, is in general\r\nconsidered the first. It is an inflexible rod or bar of any kind, so\r\ndisposed as to turn on a pivot or prop, which is always called its\r\n_fulcrum_. It has the weight or resistance to be overcome attached to\r\nsome one part of its length, and the power which is to overcome that\r\nresistance applied to another; and, since the _power_, _resistance_,\r\nand _fulcrum_ admit of various positions with regard to each other, so\r\nis the lever divided into three kinds or modifications, distinguished\r\nas the first, second, and third kinds of lever. That portion of it\r\nwhich is contained between the fulcrum and the power, is called the\r\nacting part or arm of the lever; and that part which is between the\r\nfulcrum and resistance, its resisting part or arm.\r\n\r\nIn the lever of the first kind, the fulcrum is placed between the power\r\nand the resistance. A poker, in the act of stirring the fire, well\r\nillustrates this subject; the bar is the _fulcrum_, the hand the power,\r\nand the coals the resistance to be overcome. Another common application\r\nof this kind of lever is the crow-bar, or hand-spike, used for raising\r\na large stone or weight. In all these cases power is gained in\r\nproportion as the distance from the fulcrum to the power, or part where\r\nthe men apply their strength, is greater than the distance from the\r\nfulcrum to that end under the stone or weight. A moment’s reflection\r\nwill show the rationale of this fact; for it is evident that if both\r\nthe arms of the lever be equal, that is to say, if the fulcrum be\r\nmidway between the power and weight, no advantage can be gained by it,\r\nbecause they pass over equal spaces in the same time; and, according to\r\nthe fundamental principle already laid down, _as advantage or power is\r\ngained, time must be lost_; but, since no time is lost under such\r\ncircumstances, there cannot be any power gained. If, now, we suppose\r\nthe fulcrum to be so removed towards the weight, as to make the acting\r\narm of the lever three times the length of the resisting arm, we shall\r\nobtain a lever which gains power in the proportion of three to one,\r\nthat is, a single pound weight applied at the upper end will balance\r\nthree pounds suspended at the other. A pair of scissors consists of two\r\nlevers of this kind, united in one common fulcrum; thus the point at\r\nwhich the two levers are screwed together is the fulcrum; the handles\r\nto which the power of the fingers is applied, are the extremities of\r\nthe acting part of the levers, and the cutting part of the scissors are\r\nthe resisting parts of the levers; the longer, therefore, the handles,\r\nand the shorter the points of the scissors, the more easily you cut\r\nwith them. A person who has any hard substance to cut, without any\r\nknowledge of the theory, diminishes as much as possible the length of\r\nthe resisting arms, or cutting part of the scissors, by making use of\r\nthat part of the instrument nearest the screw or rivet. Snuffers are\r\nlevers of a similar description; so are most kind of pincers, the power\r\nof which consists in the resisting arm being very short in comparison\r\nwith the acting one.\r\n\r\nIn the lever of the second kind, the resistance or weight is between\r\nthe fulcrum and the power. Numberless instances of its application\r\ndaily present themselves to our notice; amongst which may be enumerated\r\nthe common cutting knife, used by last and patten makers, one end of\r\nwhich is fixed to the work-bench by a swivel-hook. Two men carrying a\r\nload between them, by one or more poles, as a sedan chair, or as\r\nbrewers carrying a cask of beer, in which case either the back or front\r\nman may be considered as the fulcrum, and the other as the power. Every\r\ndoor which turns upon its hinges is a lever of this kind; the hinges\r\nmay be considered as the fulcrum, or centre of motion; the whole door\r\nis the weight to be moved, and the power is applied to that side on\r\nwhich the handle is usually fixed. Nut-crackers, oars, rudders of\r\nships, likewise fall under the same division. The boat is the weight to\r\nbe moved, the water is the fulcrum, and the waterman at the oar is the\r\npower. The masts of ships are also levers of the second kind, for the\r\nbottom of the vessel is the fulcrum, the ship the weight, and the wind\r\nacting against the sail is the moving power. In this kind of lever the\r\npower or advantage is gained in proportion as the distance of the power\r\nis greater than the distance of the weight from the fulcrum; if, for\r\ninstance, the weight hang at one inch from the fulcrum, and the power\r\nacts at five inches from it, the power gained is five to one; because,\r\nin such a case, the power passes over five times as great a space as\r\nthe weight. It is thus evident why there is considerable difficulty in\r\npushing open a heavy door, if the hand is applied to the part next the\r\nhinges, although it may be opened with the greatest ease in the usual\r\nmethod. In the third kind of lever, the fulcrum is again at one of the\r\nextremities, the weight or resistance at the other; and it is now the\r\npower which is applied between the fulcrum and resistance. As in this\r\ncase the weight is farther from the centre of motion than the power,\r\nsuch a lever is never used, except in cases of absolute necessity, as\r\nin the case of lifting up a ladder perpendicularly, in order to place\r\nit against a wall. The man who raises it cannot place his hands on the\r\nupper part of the ladder; the power, therefore, is necessarily placed\r\nmuch nearer the fulcrum than the weight; for the hands are the power,\r\nthe ground the fulcrum, and the upper part of the ladder the weight.\r\nThe use of the common fire-tongs is another example, but the\r\ncircumstance that principally gives this lever importance is, that the\r\nlimbs of men and animals are actuated by it; for the bones are the\r\nlevers, while the joints are the fulcra, and the muscles which give\r\nmotion to the limbs, or produce the power, are inserted and act close\r\nto the joints, while the action is produced at the extremities; the\r\nconsequence of such an arrangement is, that although the muscles must\r\nnecessarily exert an enormous contractile force to produce great action\r\nat the extremities, yet a celerity of motion ensues which could not be\r\nequally well provided for in any other manner. We may adduce one\r\nexample in illustration of this fact. In lifting a weight with the\r\nhand, the lower part of the arm becomes a lever of the third kind; the\r\nelbow is the fulcrum; the muscles of the fleshy part of the arm the\r\npower; and as these are nearer to the elbow than the hand, it is\r\nnecessary that their power should exceed the weight to be raised. The\r\ndisadvantage, however, with respect to power, is more than compensated\r\nby the convenience resulting from this structure of the arm; and it is\r\nno doubt that which is best adapted to enable it to perform its various\r\nfunctions. From these observations it must appear, that although this\r\narrangement must be mentioned as a modification of the lever, it\r\ncannot, in strictness, be called a mechanical power; since its\r\nresisting arm is in all cases, except one, longer than the acting arm,\r\nand in that one case is equal to it, on which account it never can gain\r\npower, but in most instances must lose it.\r\n\r\nTHE WHEEL AND AXLE is the next mechanical power to be considered; it\r\nmust be well known to every reader who has seen a village well; for it\r\nis by this power that the bucket is drawn up, although in such cases,\r\ninstead of a wheel attached to the axle, there is generally only a\r\ncrooked handle, which answers the purpose of winding the rope round the\r\naxle, and thus raising the bucket, as may be seen in the engraving at\r\nthe head of our third chapter. It is evident, however, that this\r\ncrooked handle is equivalent to a wheel; for the handle describes a\r\ncircle as it revolves, while the straight piece which is united to the\r\naxle corresponds with the spoke of a wheel. This power may be resolved\r\ninto a lever; in fact, what is it but a lever moving round an axle? and\r\nalways retaining the effect gained during every part of the motion, by\r\nmeans of a rope wound round the butt end of the axle; the spoke of the\r\nwheel being the long arm of the lever, and the half diameter of the\r\naxle its short arm. The axle is not in itself a mechanical power, for\r\nit is as impotent as a lever whose fulcrum is in the centre; but add to\r\nit the wheel, and we have a power which will increase in proportion as\r\nthe circumference of the wheel exceeds that of the axle. This arises\r\nfrom the velocity of the circumference being so much greater than that\r\nof the axle, as it is farther from the centre of motion; for the wheel\r\ndescribes a great circle in the same space of time that the axle\r\ndescribes a small one; therefore the power is increased in the same\r\nproportion as the circumference of the wheel is greater than that of\r\nthe axle. Those who have ever drawn a bucket from a well by this\r\nmachine, must have observed, that as the bucket ascended nearer the top\r\nthe difficulty increased: such an effect must necessarily follow from\r\nthe views we have just offered; for whenever the rope coils more than\r\nonce the length of the axle, the difference between its circumference\r\nand that of the wheel is necessarily diminished. To the principle of\r\nthe wheel and axle may be referred the capstan, windlass, and all those\r\nnumerous kinds of cranes which are to be seen at the different wharfs\r\non the banks of the river Thames. It is scarcely necessary to add that\r\nthe force of the windmill depends upon a similar power. The _treadmill_\r\nfurnishes another striking example. The wheel and axle is sometimes\r\nused to multiply motion, instead of to gain power, as in the\r\nmultiplying wheel of the common jack, to which it is applied when the\r\nweight cannot conveniently have a long line of descent; a heavy weight\r\nis in this case made to act upon the axle, while the wheel, by its\r\ngreatest circumference, winds up a much longer quantity of line than\r\nthe simple descent of the weight could require, and thus the machine is\r\nmade to go much longer without winding than it otherwise would do.\r\n\r\nTHE PULLEY is a power of very extensive application. Every one must\r\nhave seen a pulley; it is a circular and flat piece of wood or metal,\r\nwith a string which runs in a groove round it. Where, however, this is\r\nfixed, it cannot afford any power to raise a weight; for it is evident\r\nthat, in order to raise it, the power must be greater than the weight,\r\nand that if the rope be pulled down one inch, the weight will only\r\nascend the same space; consequently, there cannot be any mechanical\r\nadvantage from the arrangement. This, however, is not the case where\r\nthe pulley is not fixed. Suppose one end of the rope be fastened to a\r\nhook in the ceiling, and that to the moveable pulley on the rope a cask\r\nbe attached, is it not evident that the hand applied to the other\r\nextremity of the rope will sustain it more easily than if it held the\r\ncask suspended to a cord without a pulley? Experience shows that this\r\nis the fact, and theory explains it by suggesting that the fixed hook\r\nsustains half the weight, and that the hand, therefore, has only the\r\nother half to sustain. The hook will also afford the same assistance in\r\nraising the weight as in sustaining it; if the hand has but one half\r\nthe weight to sustain, it will also have only one half the weight to\r\nraise; but observe, says Mrs. Marcet, that in raising the weight, the\r\nvelocity of the hand must be double that of the cask; for, in order to\r\nraise the weight one inch, the hand must draw each of the strings one\r\ninch; the whole string is therefore shortened two inches, while the\r\nweight is raised only one. Pulleys then act on the same principle as\r\nthe lever, the deficiency of strength of the power being compensated by\r\nits superior velocity. It will follow, from these premises, that the\r\ngreater the number of pulleys connected by a string, the more easily\r\nthe weight is raised, as the difficulty is divided amongst the number\r\nof strings, or rather of parts into which the string is divided by the\r\npulleys. Several pulleys, thus connected, form what is called a system,\r\nor tackle of pulleys. They may have been seen suspended from cranes, to\r\nraise goods into warehouses, and in ships to draw up the sails.\r\n\r\nTHE INCLINED PLANE is a mechanic power which is seldom used in the\r\nconstruction of machinery, but applies more particularly to the moving\r\nor raising of loads upon slopes or hills, as in rolling a cask up or\r\ndown a sloping plank into or out of a cart or cellar, or drawing a\r\ncarriage up a sloping road or hill, all which operations are performed\r\nwith less exertion than would be required if the same load were lifted\r\nperpendicularly. It is a power which cannot be resolved into that of\r\nthe lever: it is a distinct principle, and those writers who have\r\nattempted to simplify the mechanical powers, have been obliged to\r\nacknowledge the inclined plane is elementary. The method of estimating\r\nthe advantage gained by this mechanical power is very easy; for just as\r\nmuch as the length of the plane exceeds its perpendicular height, so\r\nmuch is the advantage gained; if, for instance, its length be three\r\ntimes greater than its height, a weight could be drawn to its summit\r\nwith a third part of the strength required for lifting it up at the\r\nend; but, in accordance with the principle so frequently alluded to,\r\nsuch a power will be at the expense of time, for there will be three\r\ntimes more space to pass over. The reason why horses are eased by\r\ntaking a zig-zag direction, in ascending or descending a steep hill,\r\nwill appear from the preceding account of the action of the inclined\r\nplane, because in this way the effective length of the inclining\r\nsurface is increased while its height remains the same.\r\n\r\nTHE WEDGE is rather a compound, than a distinct mechanical power; since\r\nit is composed of two inclined planes, and in action frequently\r\nperforms the functions of a lever. It is sometimes employed in raising\r\nbodies; thus the largest ship may be raised to a small height by\r\ndriving a wedge below it; but its more common application is that of\r\ndividing and cleaving bodies. As an elevator, it resembles exactly the\r\ninclined plane; for the action is obviously the very same, whether the\r\nwedge be pushed under the load, or the load be drawn under [sic] the\r\nwedge. But when the wedge is drawn forward, the percussive tremor\r\nexcited destroys, for an instant, the adhesion or friction at its\r\nsides, and augments prodigiously the effect. From this principle\r\nchiefly is derived the power of the wedge in rending wood and other\r\nsubstances. It then acts besides as a lever, insinuating itself into\r\nthe cleft as fast as the parts are opened by the vibrating concussion.\r\nTo bring the action of the wedge, therefore, under a strict\r\ncalculation, would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. Its\r\neffects are chiefly discovered by experience. All the various kinds of\r\ncutting tools, such as axes, knives, chisels, saws, planes, and files,\r\nare only different modifications of the wedge.\r\n\r\nTHE SCREW is a most efficient mechanic power, and is of great force and\r\ngeneral application. It is in reality nothing more than an inclined\r\nplane formed round a cylinder, instead of being a continued straight\r\nline. Its power is, therefore, estimated by taking its circumference,\r\nand dividing this by the distance between any two of its threads; for\r\nwhat is taking the circumference of a screw, but another mode of\r\nmeasuring the length of the inclined plane which wraps round it? and\r\ntaking the distance between one thread and the next to it, is but\r\nmeasuring the rise of that inclined plane in such length; and from the\r\nproperties of the inclined plane, it follows, that the closer the\r\nthreads of a screw are together in proportion to its diameter, the\r\ngreater will be the power gained by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Note 24, p. 165.--THE CYCLOID.\r\n\r\nA _cycloid_ is a peculiar curve line; and is described by any one point\r\nof a circle as it rolls along a plane, and turns round its centre;\r\nthus, for instance, the nail on the felly of a cart-wheel traces a\r\ncycloid in the air as the wheel proceeds. This curve is distinguished\r\nby some remarkable properties, the most important of which is that\r\nmentioned in the text, viz. that any body moving in such a curve, by\r\nits own weight, or swing, will pass through all distances of it in\r\nexactly the same time; and it is for such a reason that pendulums are\r\nmade to swing in cycloids, in order that they may move in equal times,\r\nwhether they go through a long or a short part of the same curve. Where\r\nthe arc described is small, a portion of the circle will be\r\nsufficiently accurate, because it will be seen that such an arc will\r\nnot deviate much from an equal portion of a cycloidal curve.\r\n\r\nThe cycloid is remarkable as being that path, with the exception of the\r\nperpendicular, through which a body will move with the greatest\r\nvelocity; suppose, for example, a body is to descend from any one point\r\nto any other, by means of some force acting on it, together with its\r\nweight: a person unacquainted with mechanics would say at once, that a\r\nstraight line is the path it must take to effect this in the shortest\r\npossible time, since that is the shortest of all lines that can be\r\ndrawn between two points. Undoubtedly it is the shortest;\r\nnotwithstanding which, however, the body would be longer in traversing\r\nit, than in moving through a cycloid. If a body were to move through a\r\nspace of fifty or a hundred yards, by its weight and some other force\r\nacting together, the way it must take to do this in the shortest\r\npossible time is by moving in a cycloid. It is supposed that birds\r\nwhich build in the rocks possess an instinctive knowledge of this fact,\r\nand drop or fly down from height to height in this course. There is\r\ncertainly a general resemblance between the curved path they describe\r\non such occasions, and the cycloid, but it would be difficult to\r\nestablish the fact by experiment. Man, however, has founded upon this\r\nprinciple some applications of great value in practical mechanics. In\r\nSwitzerland, and in several parts of Germany, for example, slides have\r\nbeen constructed along the sides of mountains, by which the timber\r\nfelled near their summits is conducted with extreme rapidity to the\r\ndistant valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Note 25, p. 171.--BILLIARDS.\r\n\r\nThis interesting game is of French origin (_billiard_, of _bile_, and\r\nfrom the Latin, _pila_, a ball). It was hailed as a favourite diversion\r\nat the court of Henry III. of France; and was thence communicated to\r\nall the courts of modern Europe. To the novice it may appear as a game\r\nof accidents and chances, but experience has enabled us to determine\r\nthe effects of the stroke given to a ball with wonderful precision; and\r\nit is quite extraordinary to observe the accuracy with which an\r\naccomplished player can effect his object, by measuring with his eye\r\nthe angle at which he should make the stroke, the position of the ball\r\nwith respect to the cushion, and the distance of the point of the ball\r\nfrom its centre, at which it should be struck. By such skilful\r\nmanagement the ball may be made to take directions which would, at\r\nfirst view, be regarded as contrary to all the known laws of motion,\r\nsuch, for instance, as passing round an object, such as a hat placed on\r\nthe table, and to strike a ball behind it into a pocket.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject the reader should consult a work by M. Mingaud, which\r\nhas been translated and published by John Thurston, the celebrated\r\nbilliard-table maker of Catherine Street, Strand. We understand that a\r\nstill more complete work may be expected from the same source.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Note 26, p. 172.--COLLISION OF BODIES.\r\n\r\nIn investigating the effects produced upon bodies by collision, it is\r\nnecessary to distinguish between elastic and non-elastic substances,\r\nsince their motions after impact are governed by very different laws.\r\n\r\nIf two bodies, _void of elasticity_, move in one right line, either the\r\nsame or contrary ways, so that one body may strike directly against\r\nanother, let the _sum_ of their motions before the stroke, if they move\r\nthe same way, and the _difference_ of their motions, if contrary ways,\r\nbe divided into two such parts as are proportional to the quantities of\r\nmatter in the bodies, and each of those parts will respectively exhibit\r\nthe motion of each body after the stroke: for example, if the\r\nquantities of matter in the bodies be as _two_ to _one_, and their\r\nmotions before the stroke as _five_ and _four_, then the sum of their\r\nmotions is _nine_, and the difference is _one_; and therefore, when\r\nthey move the same way, the motion of that body, which is as _two_,\r\nwill, after the stroke, be _six_, and the motion of the other, _three_;\r\nbut, if they move in contrary directions, the motion of the greater\r\nbody after the stroke will be _two-thirds of one_, and of the lesser\r\nbody _one-third of one_; for, since the bodies are void of elasticity,\r\nthey will not separate after the stroke, but move together with one and\r\nthe same velocity; and, consequently, their motions will be\r\nproportional to their quantities of matter; and it follows from the\r\nfact of action and reaction being equal, that no motion is either lost\r\nor gained by the stroke when the bodies move the same way; because,\r\nwhatever motion one body imparts to the other, so much must it lose of\r\nits own; and, consequently, the _sum_ of their motions before the\r\nstroke is neither increased nor diminished by the stroke, but is so\r\ndivided between the bodies, as that they may move together with one\r\ncommon velocity; that is, it is divided between the bodies in\r\nproportion to their quantities of matter: but it is otherwise, where\r\nthe bodies move in opposite directions, or contrary ways, for then the\r\nsmaller motion will be destroyed by the stroke, as also an equal\r\nquantity of the greater motion, because action and reaction are equal;\r\nand the bodies, after the stroke, will move together equally swift,\r\nwith the _difference_ only of their motions before the stroke;\r\nconsequently, that difference is, by means of the stroke, divided\r\nbetween them in proportion to their quantities of matter.\r\n\r\nThe several particular cases, concerning the collision of bodies, may\r\nbe reduced to four general ones; viz.\r\n\r\n1st. It may be, that one body only is in motion at the time of the\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\n2nd. They may both move one and the same way.\r\n\r\n3rd. They may move in direct opposition to each other, and that with\r\nequal quantities of motion.\r\n\r\n4th. They may be carried with unequal motions in directions contrary to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nAs the bodies may be either equal or unequal, each of these four\r\ngeneral cases may be considered as consisting of two branches.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, if a body in motion strikes another equal body at\r\nrest, they will, according to the proposition, move together each of\r\nthem with one half of the motion that the body had which was in motion\r\nbefore the stroke; and since the quantity of motion in any body is as\r\nthe product arising from the multiplication of its quantity of matter\r\ninto its velocity, the common velocity of the two bodies will be but\r\none half of the velocity of the moving body before the stroke.\r\n\r\nAs to the second general case, where both the bodies are in motion\r\nbefore the stroke, and move one and the same way. In order to find\r\ntheir common velocity after impact, let the sum of their motions before\r\nthe stroke be divided by the sum of the bodies, and the quotient will\r\nexpress the common velocity.\r\n\r\nAs to the third general case, where the bodies move in direct\r\nopposition to each other, if they have equal quantities of motion, they\r\nwill upon the stroke lose all their motion, and continue at rest; for,\r\nby the proposition, the bodies after impact will be carried with the\r\ndifference of their motions before the stroke; which difference, in\r\nsuch a case, is nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen two bodies meet with unequal quantities of motion, if the\r\ndifference of their motions be divided by the sum of the bodies, the\r\nquotient will express their common velocity after the stroke; for, by\r\nthe proposition, the difference of their motions before the stroke is\r\nequal to the sum of their motions after the stroke; consequently, that\r\ndifference divided by the sum of the bodies must give the velocity.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal laws which govern the collision of bodies devoid\r\nof elasticity. The motions of elastic bodies are determined by\r\ndifferent rules: for when they are perfectly elastic, the velocity\r\ngained by the body struck, and the velocity lost by the striking body,\r\nwill be twice as great as if the bodies were perfectly inelastic. In\r\nestimating, therefore, the motions of such bodies, we may first\r\nconsider what they would have been after impact, had they been\r\ninelastic, and thence deduce the desired conclusion. See Helsham’s\r\nLectures, a work in which the subject appears to be very clearly\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Note 27, p. 181.--DRUIDICAL REMAINS.\r\n\r\nKarn-brêh hill rises a little to the south-west of Redruth in Cornwall,\r\nto an elevation of 697 feet. Its principal interest is derived from the\r\nspeculations of the antiquary, Doctor Borlase, who regarded it as\r\nhaving been once the grand centre of druidical worship; and he asserts,\r\nin his Antiquities of Cornwall, that, at this very time, the remains of\r\nthose monuments which were peculiar to that priesthood may be\r\ndiscovered, such as _rock-basins_, _circles_, _rock-idols_,\r\n_cromlechs_, _karns_, _caves_, _religious enclosures_, _logan stones_,\r\n_a gorseddau_, or place of elevation, whence the druids pronounced\r\ntheir decrees, and the traces of a _grove of oaks_. This is all very\r\ningenious and imposing, and may be easily believed by those who have\r\neither not visited the spot, or, having visited it, not viewed the\r\nobjects with geological eyes. There is no ground whatever for\r\nconsidering the druidical monuments of Dr. Borlase as the works of man:\r\non the contrary, they are evidently the results of the operation of\r\ntime and the elements, the usual agents employed by Nature in the\r\ndecomposition of mountain masses: but the age of antiquarian illusion\r\nis past; the light of geological science has dispelled the phantoms\r\ncreated by the wizard Fancy, just as the rising sun dissolves the\r\nmystic forms which the most common object assumes in twilight, when\r\nviewed through the medium of credulity and superstition. The\r\n“rock-basins” of antiquaries are rounded cavities on the surface of\r\nrocks, and are occasionally as spheroidal internally as if they had\r\nbeen actually formed by a turning-lathe. It was this artificial\r\nappearance which first suggested the hypothesis concerning their\r\norigin, and induced the antiquary to regard them as pools of\r\nlustration. It may, however, be remarked, in the first place, that,\r\nsupposing them to have been the works of the druids, these priests must\r\nhave been indefatigable artists, for there is scarcely a block of\r\ngranite on which one or more of such pools are not visible, although\r\nsome are, undoubtedly, much more complete and imposing than others. We\r\nshall introduce to the reader an account of these rock-basins in the\r\nwords of their great defender, and we think that he will be amused with\r\nthe ingenuity and confidence with which the antiquary dwells upon every\r\nappearance, and bends the facts to suit his favourite theory. “Since no\r\nauthor has mentioned, and attempted to explain these monuments, let us\r\nsee what light and assistance their shape and structure, exposition,\r\nnumber, and place, considered together with the customs and known rites\r\nof antiquity, may afford us in this untrodden path. Of these basins\r\nthere are two sorts; some have lips or channels to them, others have\r\nnone; and therefore, as those lips are manifestly the works of design,\r\nnot of accident, those that have so material a difference must needs\r\nhave been intended for a different use, and yet both these sorts seem\r\nto be the works of the same people, for there is a multitude of these\r\nbasins which have no lips or outlets, as well as those which have, to\r\nbe seen on Karn-brêh hill, and elsewhere, on contiguous rocks. Their\r\nshape is not uniform; some are quite irregular, some oval, and some are\r\nexactly circular. Their openings do not converge in the top as a jar or\r\nhogshead, but rather spread and widen, as if to expose the hollow as\r\nmuch as possible to the skies. Some have little falls into a larger\r\nbasin, which receives their tribute, and detains it, having no outlet.\r\nOther large ones intermixed with little ones have passages from one to\r\nanother, and, by successive falls uniting, transmit what they receive\r\ninto one common basin, which has a drain to it, that serves itself and\r\nall the basins above it.”\r\n\r\n“The lips do not all point in the same direction, some tending to the\r\nsouth, some to the west, others to the north, and others again to the\r\nintermediate points of the compass; _by which it seems as if the makers\r\nhad been determined in this particular, not by any mystical veneration\r\nfor one region of the heavens more than another, but by the shape and\r\ninclination of the rock, and for the most easy and convenient outlet_.”\r\nWe must here beg the reader to pause. The above remark is really too\r\nvaluable to be suffered to pass without some notice. And so the absence\r\nof all design and arrangement is adduced as a proof of their artificial\r\norigin! What would Dr. Borlase have said, had all these lips been found\r\nto point in the same direction? But to proceed:\r\n\r\n“The size of rock-basins is as different as their shape; they are\r\nformed from six feet to a few inches in diameter. Many uses may suggest\r\nthemselves to the imaginations of the curious from the description of\r\nthese new, and hitherto scarce-mentioned monuments; in order,\r\ntherefore, to obviate some prepossessions, and prevent the mind from\r\nresting so far on groundless suppositions as may make it more difficult\r\nto embrace the truth, I shall first consider what, in all probability,\r\n_cannot_ have been the design of them.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor then proceeds to show that they could never have been\r\nintended for evaporating salt; nor for pounding tin ore, nor for\r\nreceiving obelisks, or stone deities, nor for altars; and then suggests\r\nthat they could be no other than vessels most ingeniously contrived for\r\nholding holy-water for the rites of washing and purification. “If,”\r\nadds the learned antiquary, “fitness can decide the use--and where\r\nhistory is deficient, it is all reason that it should--we shall not\r\nlong be at a loss. They are mostly placed above the reach of cattle,\r\nfrequently above the inspection of man; nay, the stones which have\r\nthese basins on them, do not touch the common ground, but stand on\r\nother stones.--Wherefore? but that the water might neither be really\r\ndefiled by the former, nor incur the imaginary impurity, which touching\r\nthe ground, according to the druid opinion, gave to every thing that\r\nwas holy.” We do not know what ideas the druids entertained with\r\nrespect to the purity of water, but we have seen water in some of these\r\npools so impregnated with the excrement of sea-birds, that we must have\r\nbeen as thirsty as Tantalus, before we could have been induced to cool\r\nour tongues with it.\r\n\r\n“But,” adds Dr. Borlase, “there are some basins which have no lip or\r\nchannel; and, therefore, as they could not contribute any of their\r\nwater to the common store, they _must_ have been appropriated to\r\nanother use; and since these are found in the same places with the\r\nothers above-mentioned which have outlets or mouths to them, they must\r\nhave been subservient to the same system of superstition, though in a\r\ndifferent method.”\r\n\r\n“These basins are sometimes found near twenty feet high from the common\r\nsurface; and, therefore, being so withdrawn from vulgar eyes, so\r\nelevated from the ground, which was supposed, as I said before, to\r\ndefile all, they had likely a proportionably greater degree of\r\nreverence, and their waters accounted more holy, and more efficacious.”\r\n\r\nWe shall not trouble the reader with any further quotations from this\r\nlearned antiquary, except in concluding the history, after the fashion\r\nof melo-dramatists, with a splendid scene, in which, with the author’s\r\nassistance, we shall bring all the performers on the stage, dressed in\r\nappropriate costume, and surrounded by all the pomp of druidical\r\nworship.\r\n\r\n“From these basins,” says Dr. Borlase, “on solemn occasions the\r\nofficiating druid, standing on an eminence, sanctified the congregation\r\nwith a more than ordinarily precious lustration before he expounded to\r\nthem, or prayed for them, or gave forth his decisions. This water he\r\ndrank, or purified his hands in, before it touched any other vessel,\r\nand was consequently accounted more sacred than the other holy-water.\r\nTo these more private basins, during the time of libation, the priest\r\nmight have recourse, and be at liberty to judge by the quantity,\r\ncolour, motion, and other appearances in the water, of future events,\r\nof dubious cases, without danger of contradiction from the people\r\nbelow. This water might serve to mix their mistletoe withal, as a\r\ngeneral antidote: for, doubtless, those who would not let it touch the\r\nground, would not mix this their divinity (the mistletoe) with common\r\nwater. Oak leaves, without which the druid rites did scarce ever\r\nproceed, ritually gathered and infused, might make some very medicinal\r\nor incantorial potion. Lastly, libations of water were never to be made\r\nto their gods, but when they consisted of this purest of all water, as\r\nwhat was immediately come from the heavens, and partly therefore\r\nthither to be returned, before it touched any other water or any other\r\nvessel whatsoever, placed on the ground.”\r\n\r\n“As _logan_, or rocking-stones, were some of the _piæ fraudes_ of the\r\ndruids, the basins found on them might be used to promote the juggle;\r\nby the motion of the stone the water might be so agitated, as to delude\r\nthe enquirer by a pretended miracle; might make the criminal confess;\r\nsatisfy the credulous; bring forth the gold of the rich; and make the\r\ninjured, rich as well as poor, acquiesce in what the druid thought\r\nproper.”\r\n\r\nSorry are we to destroy a web which has been so ingeniously woven by\r\nits author; but the interests of truth admit not of compromise. Dr.\r\nMacculloch, in an interesting paper, published in the Transactions of\r\nthe Geological Society, on the decomposition of the granite tors of\r\nCornwall, has justly observed, that the true nature of these\r\nrock-basins may be easily traced by inspecting the rocks themselves. On\r\nexamination, they will always be found to contain distinct grains of\r\n_quartz_, and fragments of the other constituent parts of the granite.\r\nA small force is sufficient to detach from the sides of these cavities\r\nadditional fragments, showing that a process of decomposition is still\r\ngoing on under favourable circumstances. The principal of these\r\ncircumstances is the presence of water, or rather the alternate action\r\nof air and water. If a drop of water can only make an effectual\r\nlodgement on a surface of this granite, a small cavity is sure to be\r\nsooner or later produced; this will insensibly enlarge as it becomes\r\ncapable of holding more water; and the sides, as they continue to\r\nwaste, will necessarily retain an even and rounded cavity, on account\r\nof the uniform texture of the rock. This explanation is sufficiently\r\nsatisfactory: in addition to which, it may be stated, that these very\r\nbasins not unfrequently occur on the perpendicular sides of rocks, as\r\nmay be distinctly seen in the granite of Scilly, and in the gritstone\r\nrocks in the park of the late Sir Joseph Banks, in the parish of\r\nAshover, in Derbyshire; a fact which at once excludes the idea of their\r\nartificial origin.\r\n\r\nThe other grotesque and whimsical appearances of rocky masses, such as\r\n_rock idols_, _logan stones_, _&c._ are to be explained by the tendency\r\nwhich granite possesses of wearing more rapidly on the angles and edges\r\nthan on the sides; thus, then, upon simple and philosophical\r\nprinciples, are such appearances to be satisfactorily accounted for,\r\nand the _phantasmagoria_ of Borlase vanishes as the light penetrates\r\nthe theatre so long dedicated to its exhibition.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude this note with a few observations upon the celebrated\r\nlogan, or logging, stone, near the Land’s End, Cornwall, of which we\r\npresent our readers with a faithful sketch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mound of stone with a boulder balanced atop a point in\r\nthe middle.]\r\n\r\nThe foundation of this part of the coast is a stupendous group of\r\ngranite rocks, which rise in pyramidal clusters to a great altitude,\r\nand overhang the sea. The celebrated _logan stone_ here represented is\r\nan immense block weighing above sixty tons. The surface in contact with\r\nthe under rock is of very small extent, and the whole mass is so nicely\r\nbalanced, that, notwithstanding its magnitude, the strength of a single\r\nman applied to its under edge is sufficient to make it oscillate. It is\r\nthe nature of granite to disintegrate into rhomboidal and tabular\r\nmasses, which, by the further operation of air and moisture, gradually\r\nlose their solid angles, and approach the spheroidal form. The fact of\r\nthe upper part of the cliff being more exposed to atmospheric agency\r\nthan the parts beneath, will sufficiently explain why these rounded\r\nmasses so frequently rest on blocks which still preserve the tabular\r\nform; and since such spheroidal blocks must obviously rest in that\r\nposition in which their lesser axes are perpendicular to the horizon,\r\nit is equally evident that, whenever an adequate force is applied, they\r\nmust vibrate on their point of support.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are thus led to deny the druidical origin of this stone,\r\nfor which so many zealous antiquaries have contended, still we by no\r\nmeans intend to deny that the druids employed it as an engine of\r\nsuperstition; it is possible that, having observed so curious a\r\nproperty, they dexterously contrived to make it answer the purposes of\r\nan ordeal, and, by regarding it as the _touch-stone_ of truth,\r\nacquitted or condemned the accused by its motions. Mason poetically\r\nalludes to this supposed property in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n                          “Behold yon huge\r\n            And unknown sphere of living adamant,\r\n            Which, poised by magic, rests its central weight\r\n            On yonder pointed rock; firm as it seems,\r\n            Such is its strange and virtuous property,\r\n            It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch\r\n            Of him whose heart is pure, but to a traitor,\r\n            Tho’ e’en a giant’s prowess nerved his arm,\r\n            It stands as fixed as Snowdon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 28, p. 186.--ANIMAL SUCTION.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Sir Everard Home for a description of that peculiar\r\nstructure by which several species of animals are enabled to sustain\r\ntheir bodies in opposition to the force of gravity. His first paper\r\nupon this subject is published in the 106th volume of the Philosophical\r\nTransactions, in which he says, he was not aware that any animal,\r\nlarger than the house-fly, was endowed by nature with such a power, so\r\nas to admit of examination, until Sir Joseph Banks mentioned that the\r\n_lacerta gecko_, a species of lizard, which is a native of the island\r\nof Java, comes out of an evening from the roofs of the houses, and\r\nwalks down the smooth, hard, and polished chinam walls, in search of\r\nthe flies which settle upon them, and which are its natural food, and\r\nthen runs up again to the roof of the house. Sir Joseph, while at\r\nBatavia, amused himself with catching this animal, by standing close to\r\nthe wall, at some distance from the lizard, with a long flattened pole,\r\nwhich being made suddenly to scrape the surface of the wall, knocked\r\nthe animal down. He presented Sir Everard with a specimen weighing five\r\nounces and three quarters, avoirdupois, which enabled him to ascertain\r\nthe peculiar mechanism by which the feet of this animal can keep their\r\nhold of a smooth, hard, perpendicular wall, and carry up so large a\r\nweight as that of its body.\r\n\r\nThe foot has five toes, at the end of each of which, except that of the\r\nthumb, is a very sharp and much curved claw; on the under surface of\r\neach toe are sixteen transverse slits, leading to so many cavities or\r\npockets, the depth of which is nearly equal to the length of the slit\r\nthat forms the orifice; they all open forward, and the external edge of\r\neach opening is serrated, like the teeth of a small-toothed comb. The\r\ncavities, or pockets, are lined with a cuticle, and the serrated edges\r\nare also covered with it. The structure just described is supplied with\r\nvarious muscles, whose action is to draw down the claw, open the\r\norifices of the pockets, and turn down the serrated edges upon the\r\nsurface on which the animal stands. Upon examining attentively the\r\nunder surface of the toes, when the pockets are closed, Sir Everard\r\nHome was struck with their resemblance to the surfaces of that portion\r\nof the _Echineis remora_, or sucking fish, by which it attaches itself\r\nto the shark, or to the bottom of ships; and it consequently suggested\r\nthe probability of obtaining, from an examination of this latter\r\napparatus, much useful information which might be applicable to the\r\nsubject of the lizard, more especially as the parts of which it is\r\ncomposed are so much larger, and therefore more within the reach of\r\nanatomical examination.\r\n\r\nThe surface on the top of the head of this fish, fitted for adhesion,\r\nis of an oval form, and bears a considerable proportion to the size of\r\nthe whole animal; it is surrounded by a broad, loose, movable edge,\r\ncapable of applying itself closely to the surface on which it is\r\nplaced; and it is evident that when the external edge is so applied,\r\nand the cartilaginous plates are raised up, the interstices must become\r\nso many vacua, and the serrated edge of each plate will keep a\r\nsufficient hold of the substance on which it rests to retain it in that\r\nposition, assisted by the pressure of the surrounding water, without a\r\ncontinuance of muscular exertion. It thus appears that the adhesion of\r\nthe _sucking fish_ is produced by so many vacua being formed through an\r\napparatus worked by the voluntary muscles of the animal, and the\r\npressure of the surrounding water.\r\n\r\nFrom the similarity of the mechanism of the under surface of the toes\r\nof the _lacerta gecko_, there can be no doubt that the purpose to which\r\nit is applied is the same: but as in the one case the adhesion is to\r\ntake place under water, and is to continue for longer periods, the\r\nmeans are more simple; in the other, where the mechanism is to be\r\nemployed in air, under greater disadvantages with respect to gravity,\r\nand is to last for very short periods, and then immediately afterwards\r\nto be renewed, a more delicate structure of parts, a greater\r\nproportional depth of cavities, and more complex muscular structure,\r\nbecome necessary.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the principle on which an animal of so large a size\r\nas the _lacerta gecko_ is enabled to support itself in its progressive\r\nmotion against gravity, Sir E. Home felt himself more competent to\r\ninquire into the mechanism by which the common fly is enabled, with so\r\nmuch facility, to support itself in still more disadvantageous\r\nsituations. In the natural size the feet of the fly are so small, that\r\nnothing can be determined respecting them; Keller was the first person\r\nwho made a drawing of the fly’s foot in a highly magnified state, in\r\nwhich the concave surfaces are visible, and which, no doubt, like those\r\nof the lizard above described, are employed to form vacua, which enable\r\nthe fly to move under such disadvantageous circumstances. Mr. Bauer,\r\nwho has so greatly distinguished himself in microscopic researches, was\r\njudiciously enlisted into the service of Sir E. Home upon this\r\noccasion; and he has shown that this principle, on which progressive\r\nmotion against gravity depends, is very extensively employed by nature\r\nin the structure of the feet of insects; and Sir Everard observes,\r\nthat, now this structure is known, it can be readily demonstrated by\r\nlooking at the movement of the feet of any insect upon the inside of a\r\nglass tumbler, through a common magnifying glass; the different suckers\r\nare readily seen separately to be pulled off from the surface of the\r\nglass, and reapplied to another part.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the expedition to the polar regions, Sir E. Home was\r\nenabled to obtain and examine the foot of the walrus, in which he\r\ndetected a resemblance in structure to that of the fly; and it is not a\r\nlittle curious that two animals so different in size should have feet\r\nso similar in their use. In the fly the parts require to be magnified\r\none hundred times to render the structure distinctly visible; and in\r\nthe walrus the parts are so large, as to require being reduced four\r\ndiameters, to bring them within the size of a quarto page.\r\n\r\nNor is progressive motion, the only function in which Nature avails\r\nherself of the pressure of the atmosphere for the accomplishment of her\r\npurposes. The act of feeding is continually effected in this manner.\r\nThe operation of sucking is too familiar to require comment. It may\r\nnot, perhaps, be so generally known, that it is by the very same\r\nprocess that bees reach the fine dust and juices of hollow flowers,\r\nlike the honeysuckle, and some species of foxglove, which are too\r\nnarrow to admit them. They fill up the mouth of the flower with their\r\nbodies, and suck out the air, or at least a large portion of it, by\r\nwhich the soft sides of the flower are made to collapse, and the juice\r\nand dust are squeezed towards the insect, as completely as if the hand\r\nhad pressed it externally. It is by a similar process that the oyster\r\nis enabled to close its shell so firmly; for, if a hole be bored in it,\r\nit may be opened without the least difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Note 29, p. 191.--ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\nThose who are not acquainted with the operations by which the mind is\r\nenabled to arrive at truth, are too apt to attribute to accident that\r\nwhich is the result of great intellectual labour and acuteness.\r\nObservation, analogy, and experiment are the three great\r\nstepping-stones by which the philosopher is enabled to ascend from\r\ndarkness to light: it is true that his foot may accidentally be\r\nplaced upon the first, but his own efforts are required to complete\r\nthe ascent. To the mass of mankind the preliminary step is obvious,\r\nand they at once conclude that the succeeding ones are equally easy\r\nand simple. In this view of the subject, it was by accident that Sir\r\nIsaac Newton discovered the laws of gravitation, for his mind was\r\ndirected to the investigation by the accidental fall of an apple from\r\nits tree; it was by accident that Galileo discovered the isochronous\r\nmovement of the pendulum, for it was suggested by the vibration of a\r\nchandelier: but how many persons might have witnessed the fall of an\r\napple, or the vibration of a chandelier, without arriving at similar\r\ntruths? It has been said that we are indebted for the important\r\ninvention in the steam-engine, termed _hand gear_, by which its\r\nvalves or cocks are worked by the machine itself, to an idle boy of\r\nthe name of Humphrey Potter, who, being employed to stop and open a\r\nvalve, saw that he could save himself the trouble of attending and\r\nwatching it, by fixing a plug upon a part of the machine which came\r\nto the place at the proper times, in consequence of the general\r\nmovement. If this anecdote be true, what does it prove? That Humphrey\r\nPotter might be very idle, but that he was, at the same time, very\r\ningenious. It was a contrivance, not the result of accident, but of\r\nacute observation and successful experiment. Glass is said to have\r\nbeen discovered by persons having accidentally kindled a fire on the\r\nsandy shore with sea-weed, when the alkali from the ashes united with\r\nthe silex of the sand; and Pliny tells us that _minium_, or red lead,\r\nwas first recognised, in consequence of a fire that took place at the\r\nPiræus at Athens, where some _ceruse_, which had been exposed to the\r\nfire, had been found converted into a red substance. A thousand such\r\naccidents might be related, were we not affording a sample rather\r\nthan a catalogue. We are endeavouring to combat a popular but\r\nmischievous error; and we are happy at finding the same feeling\r\nexpressed in a work which, from its extensive circulation, must prove\r\nhighly useful in correcting it. “Very few discoveries,” says the\r\nauthor, “have been made by chance and by ignorant persons; much fewer\r\nthan is generally supposed. They are generally made by persons of\r\ncompetent knowledge, and who are in search of them. The improvement\r\nof the steam-engine by Watt resulted from the most learned\r\ninvestigation of mathematical, mechanical, and chemical truths.\r\nArkwright devoted many years, five at least, to his invention of\r\nspinning-jennies. The new process of refining sugar, by which more\r\nmoney has been made in a shorter time, and with less risk and\r\ntrouble, than was perhaps ever gained by an invention, was discovered\r\nby Mr. Howard, a most accomplished chemist, and it was the fruit of a\r\nlong course of experiments, in the progress of which, known\r\nphilosophical principles were constantly applied, and one or two new\r\nprinciples ascertained.”--_Library of Useful Knowledge._\r\n\r\n\r\n         Note 30, p. 193.--WEIGHT OF THE SUPERINCUMBENT OCEAN.\r\n\r\nIf we include the pressure of the atmosphere, a body at the depth of\r\n100 feet would sustain that of 60 pounds on the square inch; while one\r\nat 4,000 feet, a depth by no means considerable, it would be exposed to\r\na pressure of about 1,830 pounds. We need not, therefore, feel\r\nsurprised, that on the foundering of a ship at sea, though its timbers\r\npart, not a spar floats to the surface; for if the hull has sunk to a\r\ngreat depth, all that is porous is penetrated with water or greatly\r\ncompressed. Captain Scoresby states that when, by the entangling of the\r\nline of the harpoon, a boat was carried down with the whale, it\r\nrequired after it was recovered two boats to keep it at the surface.\r\nSir J. Herschel has recorded a melancholy anecdote, which may well be\r\nadduced in farther illustration of our subject:--“After the invention\r\nof the diving-bell, and its success in sub-aqueous processes, it was\r\nconsidered highly desirable to devise some means of remaining for any\r\nlength of time under water, and rising at pleasure without any\r\nassistance. Some years ago an ingenious individual proposed a project\r\nby which this end was to be accomplished. It consisted in sinking the\r\nhull of a ship made quite water-tight, with the decks and sides\r\nstrongly supported by shores, and the only entry secured by a stout\r\ntrap-door, in such a manner, that by disengaging from within the\r\nweights employed to sink it, it might rise of itself to the surface. To\r\nrender the trial more satisfactory, the projector himself made the\r\nfirst essay. It was agreed that he should sink in twenty fathoms water,\r\nand rise again without assistance at the expiration of twenty-four\r\nhours. Accordingly, making all secure, and provided with the means of\r\nmaking signals to indicate his situation, this unhappy victim of his\r\nown ingenuity entered and was sunk. No signal was made, and the time\r\nappointed elapsed. The pressure of the water at so great a depth had,\r\nno doubt, been completely under-estimated, and the sides of the vessel\r\nbeing at once crushed in, the unfortunate projector perished, before he\r\ncould even make the signal concerted to indicate his distress.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Note 31, p. 199.\r\n\r\nHence _pecunia_ from pecus. _Opes_ quasi Oves. See Note 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Note 32, p. 207.--THE CAUSE OF IRIDESCENCE.\r\n\r\nIf a soap-bubble be blown up, and set under a glass, so that the motion\r\nof the air may not affect it, as the water glides down the sides and\r\nthe top grows thinner, several colours will successively appear at the\r\ntop, and spread themselves from thence in rings down the sides of the\r\nbubble, till they vanish in the same order in which they appeared; at\r\nlast a black spot appears at the top, and spreads till the bubble\r\nbursts. Hence it follows that the colours of a body depend in some\r\ndegree upon the thickness and density of the particles that compose it;\r\nand that, if the density be changed, the colour will likewise be\r\nchanged. That the production of colours depends upon the nature of the\r\nsurfaces upon which light falls, is beautifully exemplified by the\r\niridescence of mother of pearl; and which has been satisfactorily shown\r\nto depend upon a singular peculiarity in the structure of that\r\nsubstance. On its surface, which to the unassisted eye, and even to the\r\ntouch, appears to be finely polished, there are innumerable little\r\nlines, or _grooves_, in some places as many as two or three thousand in\r\nthe space of an inch, which, lying parallel, regularly follow each\r\nother in all their windings; by the edges of which the rays of light\r\nare reflected, and the continual change of colour arises from their\r\ncontinual bendings. Whatever doubts might have existed upon the\r\nsubject, some late experiments of Dr. Brewster have dissipated them, by\r\nshowing that the colours which play so beautifully on the surface of\r\nmother of pearl, may be communicated by pressure to sealing-wax and\r\nseveral other substances. The discovery of this fact was in some\r\nmeasure accidental; he had stuck a piece of mother of pearl on a cement\r\nmade of rosin and bees-wax, and on separating this cement he found that\r\nit had acquired the property of exhibiting colours. Several persons who\r\nwitnessed the effect, concluded that it arose from the presence of a\r\nthin film of the mother of pearl, which might have scaled off and\r\nadhered to the wax: but such an explanation was at once refuted, by\r\nplunging the wax in acid, which must have dissolved the mother of\r\npearl, had any been present; but the acid had no effect, and the\r\ncolours of the impression remained unimpaired. It is clear, then, that\r\nit is the grooves, as Dr. Brewster conjectured, which occasion the\r\niridescence in the mother of pearl, as well as in the waxen impression.\r\nIn consequence of this curious discovery, Mr. Barton succeeded in\r\nproducing the same appearance on glass, and on different metals, by\r\nsimply cutting grooved lines on their surface. These lines are so fine\r\nthat, without a microscope, they are scarcely visible, and the glass\r\nand the metal appear to retain their polish: yet they and the colours\r\nalso may be communicated by an impression, like those from the mother\r\nof pearl, to the wax. In like manner the varying and delicate hues\r\nexhibited by the wings of certain butterflies, arise from the action of\r\nlight upon the parallel and equidistant striæ upon their surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Note 33, p. 224.--VEGETABLE BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of those plants which indicate changes in the\r\nweather:--\r\n\r\n_Chickweed_ is an excellent barometer. When the flower expands fully,\r\nwe are not to expect rain for several hours; should it continue in that\r\nstate, no rain will disturb the summer’s day. When it half conceals its\r\nminiature flower, the day is generally showery; but, if it entirely\r\nshuts up, or veils the white flower with its green mantle, let the\r\ntraveller take the hint and put on his great-coat. The different\r\nspecies of _trefoil_ always contract their leaves at the approach of a\r\nstorm; so certainly does this take place, that these plants have\r\nacquired the name of the _husbandman’s barometer_.\r\n\r\nThe tulip and several of the compound yellow flowers also close before\r\nrain. There is, besides, a species of wood-sorrel, which doubles its\r\nleaves before storms and tempests. The _bauhinia_, or mountain ebony,\r\n_cassia_, and sensitive plants, observe the same habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Note 34, p. 225.--SAINT SWITHIN.\r\n\r\nThe popular adage of _Forty days’ rain after St. Swithin_, is a\r\ntradition which seems to have derived its origin from the following\r\ncircumstance. Swithin, or _Swithum_, bishop of Winchester, who died in\r\n868, desired that he might be buried in the open church-yard, and not\r\nin the chancel of the minster, as was usual with other bishops; and his\r\nrequest was complied with; but the monks, on his being canonized,\r\nconsidering it disgraceful for the saint to lie in a public cemetery,\r\nresolved to remove the body into the choir, which was to have been done\r\nwith solemn procession on the 15th of July. It rained, however, so\r\nviolently for forty days together at this season, that the design was\r\nabandoned. “Now, without entering into the case of the bishop,” says\r\nMr. Howard, in his work on the Climate of London, “who was probably a\r\nman of sense, and wished to set the example of a more wholesome, as\r\nwell as a more humble, mode of resigning the perishable clay to the\r\ndestructive elements, I may observe, that the fact of the hindrance of\r\nthe ceremony by the cause related is sufficiently authenticated by\r\ntradition; and the tradition is so far valuable, as it proves that the\r\nsummers in this southern part of our island, were subject, a thousand\r\nyears ago, to occasional heavy rains, in the same way as at present.”\r\nMr. Howard has shown, by a table, that the notion commonly entertained\r\non this subject, if put strictly to the test of experience, at any one\r\nstation, in this part of the island, will be found fallacious; he,\r\nhowever, very justly observes, that “the opinion of the people on\r\nsubjects connected with Natural History is commonly founded, in some\r\ndegree, on fact or experience;” and to do justice to the popular\r\nobservation in question, he states that, “in a majority of our summers,\r\na showery period, which, with some latitude as to time and local\r\ncircumstances, may be admitted to constitute daily rain for forty days,\r\ndoes come on about the time indicated by this tradition; not that any\r\nlong space before is often so dry as to mark distinctly its\r\ncommencement.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Note 35, p. 230.--THE WHALE.\r\n\r\nDid the whale know his own power, he would easily destroy all the\r\nmachinery which the art of man could devise for catching him; it would\r\nbe only necessary for him to swim on the surface in a straight line in\r\norder to break the thickest rope; but the fish, on being struck by the\r\nharpoon, obeys a natural instinct, which, in this instance, betrays him\r\nto his death. Sir H. Davy, in his Salmonia, observes, that the whale,\r\nnot having an air-bladder, can sink to the lowest depths of the ocean,\r\nand mistaking the harpoon for the teeth of a sword-fish, or a shark, he\r\ninstantly descends, this being his manner of freeing himself from these\r\nenemies, who cannot bear the pressure of a deep ocean; and from\r\nascending and descending in small space, he thus puts himself in the\r\npower of the whaler.--_See Note 30._\r\n\r\n\r\n            Note 36, p. 235.--PROGRESSIVE MOTION IN FISHES:\r\n                BOATS IMPELLED BY PADDLING, ROWING, &C.\r\n\r\nTo render the subject to which this note refers farther intelligible,\r\nwe may show the means by which a fish moves forward in the water. The\r\naccompanying diagram and demonstration are from Dr. Roget’s Bridgewater\r\nTreatise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of fish’s motion.]\r\n\r\nThe tail is the principal instrument by which the progressive motion is\r\neffected. Thus--suppose that the tail is inclined to the right; if, in\r\nthis situation, the muscles of the left side, tending to bring the tail\r\nin a right line with the body, are suddenly thrown into action, the\r\nresistance of the water, by reacting against the broad surface of the\r\ntail in the direction P R, perpendicularly to that surface, will cause\r\nthe muscular action to give the whole body an impulse in that\r\ndirection; and the centre of gravity, C, will move onwards in the\r\ndirection C B, parallel to P R. This impulse is not destroyed by the\r\nfarther flexion of the tail towards the left side, because the\r\nprincipal force exerted by the muscles has already been expended in the\r\nmotion from R to M, in bringing it to a straight line with the body;\r\nand the force which carries it on to L is much weaker, and therefore\r\noccasions a more feeble reaction. When the tail has arrived at the\r\nposition L, indicated by the dotted outline, a similar action of the\r\nmuscles on the right side will create a resistance and an impulse in\r\nthe direction of K L, and a motion of the whole body in the same\r\ndirection, C A. These impulses being repeated in quick succession, the\r\nfish moves forward in the diagonal C D, intermediate between the\r\ndirection of the two forces.\r\n\r\nUpon the same principle a boat is impelled by paddling; and the action\r\nof the rudder of a ship in turning the vessel will be readily\r\nunderstood. In this latter case, however, there is an additional\r\nmechanical advantage; since the point round which the vessel turns, is\r\nbeyond the middle and towards the prow, and hence the force applied at\r\nthe extremity of the keel acts as by an arm of a lever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 37, p. 236.--FLIGHT OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\nIn appreciating the mechanical means by which a bird is enabled to\r\ndirect its course, we must not omit to take into account the power it\r\npossesses of changing the position of the centre of gravity of its\r\nbody, so that the reaction of the air may be modified with regard to\r\neach wing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Note 38, p. 236.--FLIGHT OF INSECTS.\r\n\r\nThe command possessed by insects in directing and changing their\r\ncourse, seems more perfect even than that of birds. Many of them travel\r\non their wings to immense distances, and, considering their comparative\r\nsize, they generally move through the air with greater velocity than\r\nthat of birds. Bees have been known to fly great distances from their\r\nhive, in search of food; and the silk-worm moth has travelled more than\r\na hundred miles in a very short space of time. Many of our readers\r\nhave, no doubt, noticed with surprise the apparent facility with which\r\ngnats have accompanied them, although they may have been advancing on\r\nhorseback at a full gallop; and the author during the last summer has\r\nbeen forcibly struck with the manner in which flies and other insects\r\nhave kept up with a railway carriage, alternately flying in and out of\r\nthe vehicles, as though they had been at perfect rest. Some species\r\npossess a remarkable power of poising themselves in the air, and\r\nhovering for a length of time over the same spot, without falling or\r\nrising, advancing or retreating; the _Dragon-fly_ affords a striking\r\nexample of this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Note 39, p. 237.--OBLIQUITY OF THE WINGS OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the manner in which the wings are affixed to the\r\nscapula, they give a stroke to the air in a direction both downwards\r\nand backwards; so that while the former supports the bird, the latter\r\nimpels it forward. It is curious to notice that the degree of this\r\nobliquity varies in different birds, and is evidently adapted to their\r\nhabits: thus, for instance, birds of prey have a great obliquity of\r\nwing, which better enables them to pursue their victims in a horizontal\r\ncourse; while those birds which soar to a considerable elevation, in a\r\nnearly vertical direction, as the _Lark_, have scarcely any obliquity\r\nof wing, but strike directly downwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Note 40, p. 238.--A MECHANICAL PROPOSITION.\r\n\r\nThis fact may be demonstrated by converting the triangle into a\r\nparallelogram, of which one of the sides of the triangle will become\r\nits diagonal: the other two sides will, of course, represent two forces\r\nequivalent to such diagonal, which, acting in opposition to it, must\r\nproduce a balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 41, p. 241.--KITE MESSENGERS.\r\n\r\nThe curious experiments of Mr. Faraday upon the optical effects\r\nproduced by the revolutions of different wheels, might be exhibited by\r\narrangements adjusted as messengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Note 42, p. 246.--WINDS AND STORMS.\r\n\r\nThe sea and land breezes which occur in the islands of the torrid zone,\r\nvery strikingly illustrate the position laid down in the text, and\r\nafford a good explanation of the manner in which winds may be\r\noccasioned by a change of temperature in the air. In these, during the\r\nhottest part of the day, the wind sets in from all quarters, and\r\nappears to be blowing towards the centre of the island, while in the\r\nnight it changes its direction, and blows from the centre of the land\r\ntowards the sea; for since the sun’s rays produce much more heat by\r\ntheir reflection from land than they do from water, that portion of air\r\nwhich is over the land will soon become heated, and will ascend; a\r\nrarefaction and diminution of the quantity of air over the central part\r\nof the land will be thus occasioned, which must be supplied from the\r\nsides; but, as the land cools again during the night, that portion of\r\nair which had been previously heaped up will begin to descend, and by\r\nspreading and equalizing itself will produce a breeze blowing from the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nThe _trade-winds_, so called from the advantage which their certainty\r\naffords to trading vessels, are another example of the same kind; they\r\nare generally stated to blow from east to west over the equator, and\r\nare occasioned by the rarefaction of the air by the sun’s heat, and the\r\nmotion of the earth from west to east. While writing the present note,\r\nwe have seen an essay upon the subject by Captain Basil Hall, published\r\nin an appendix to Mr. Daniel’s admirable work on Meteorology: the\r\nperusal of this paper has induced us to cancel what we had written, and\r\nto refer the reader to the essay itself; for it is quite impossible to\r\ndo justice to the views it entertains, in the limited space necessarily\r\nprescribed to us in this note.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Guinea, the wind always sets in upon the land, blowing\r\nwesterly instead of easterly; this exception arises from the deserts of\r\nAfrica, which lie near the equator, and being a very sandy soil,\r\nreflect a great degree of heat into the air above them, which being\r\nthus rendered lighter than that which is over the sea, the wind\r\ncontinually rushes in upon the land to restore the equilibrium.\r\n\r\nAmong the irregular winds, or those which are not constant, but\r\naccidental, may be noticed the _whirlwind_, the _harmattan_, and the\r\n_sirocco_. The first of these is occasioned by the meeting of two or\r\nmore currents of wind from opposite directions, and which can only be\r\noccasioned by some temporary but violent disturbance of equilibrium.\r\nThe _harmattan_ is met with on the western coast of Africa, and is\r\ngenerally attended by great heat and fog; it appears to be occasioned\r\nby a conflict between the heated sands of Africa, and the regular\r\ndirection of the trade-winds over that continent, and, by disturbing\r\ntheir progress, it is frequently the forerunner of a hurricane in the\r\nWest Indies. The _sirocco_ occurs in Egypt, the Mediterranean, and in\r\nGreece, and is chiefly characterised by its unhealthy qualities. The\r\nair, by passing over the heated sands of Egypt, becomes so dried and\r\nrarefied as to be scarcely fit for respiration, and, being thus\r\nprepared, it absorbs so much humidity on passing the Mediterranean as\r\nto form a suffocating and oppressive kind of fog.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniel observes, that the currents of a heated room, in some\r\nmeasure, exemplify the great currents of the atmosphere. If the door be\r\nopened, the flame of a candle held to the upper part will show, by its\r\ninclination, a current flowing outwards; but, if held near the floor,\r\nit will be directed inwards. If the door be closed suddenly from\r\nwithout, it moves with the in-coming current, and against the\r\nout-going, and a condensation of air takes place in the room; which is\r\nproved by the rattling of the windows, and the bursting open of any\r\ndoor in the room, if slightly closed. If the door close from within, it\r\nmoves against the in-coming current, and with the out-going, and a\r\nrarefaction of the air in the room takes place; which is evidenced by\r\nthe rattling of the windows, and the bursting open of another door in\r\nthe contrary direction.\r\n\r\nMeteorology has been long considered the least perfect branch of\r\nnatural knowledge; so apparently capricious and irregular are its\r\nphenomena, that philosophers had almost abandoned the idea of bringing\r\nthem under the operation of any general laws. Brighter lights are,\r\nhowever, now dawning upon us. Mr. Whewell, in his Bridgewater Treatise,\r\nhas explained the manner in which the various currents of the\r\natmosphere maintain a necessary balance in the distribution of heat and\r\nmoisture around the globe, and has thus reduced to order and design\r\nphenomena which have hitherto been regarded as unconnected and\r\nfortuitous. Lieut.-Col. Reid, by his late happy investigation of the\r\nlaw of storms, will, no doubt, lead us into a novel path of the most\r\nimportant discoveries. He has satisfactorily proved, by a mass of\r\nevidence derived from numerous logbooks, that storms obey fixed laws.\r\nHis attention was ardently directed to the subject by having been at\r\nBarbadoes immediately after the great hurricane of 1831, which in the\r\nshort space of seven hours killed upwards of 1400 persons on that\r\nisland alone. The discoveries of Col. Reid may be thus briefly\r\nstated.--That hurricanes are whirlwinds of great diameter, always\r\nrevolving according to an invariable law, viz. from right to left\r\n(supposing yourself standing in the centre), or in the opposite way to\r\nthe hands of a watch, in the northern hemisphere, and in a contrary\r\ndirection in southern latitudes; at the same time they have a\r\nprogressive motion in a curved line, and as they advance their\r\ndiameters appear to enlarge and their violence to diminish; it has been\r\nalso found that in the centre of the vortex there is a lull, or calm.\r\nCol. Reid observes that the simplest mode of illustrating the subject\r\nis to cut out concentric circles, so as to represent progressive\r\nwhirlwinds, by moving which over any tract, the veering of the wind\r\nwill be easily understood. The reader may form a more familiar idea by\r\ncausing the water to circulate in a basin, which will represent the\r\nviolent circular motion of the storm-wind, with a calm in the centre of\r\nthe vortex. Suppose this to be also moving onward at a rate of about\r\nseven miles an hour, and he will have a correct notion of the subject.\r\nSince the storms expand in size and diminish in force as they proceed\r\ntowards the poles, and the meridians at the same time approach each\r\nother, gales become huddled together; and hence, apparently, the true\r\ncause of the very complicated nature of the winds in our latitude.\r\nObservations would also appear to render it probable that there exists\r\nan accordance of the force of storms with the law of magnetic\r\nintensity; for example, it is at its minimum at St. Helena, where\r\nstorms never occur; on the contrary, the lines of greatest intensity\r\nseem to correspond with the latitudes of typhoons and hurricanes. To\r\nwhat important discoveries may not the pursuit of this enquiry lead us?\r\n\r\nThe practical importance of the foregoing facts must be obvious: to use\r\nthe expression of Sir John Herschel, “they will teach seamen how to\r\nsteer their ships, and save thousands of lives.” They will thus learn\r\non which side to lay-to a ship in a storm, for, by watching the veering\r\nof the wind, they will ascertain the direction in which it is falling;\r\nif violent, and the changes sudden, the ship will probably be near the\r\ncentre of the vortex; whereas, if the wind blows a great length of time\r\nfrom the same point, and the changes are gradual, it may reasonably be\r\nsupposed the ship is near the extremity of it. The barometer also\r\nbecomes a very important instrument upon these occasions; the rapid\r\nrotatory motion of a column of the atmosphere necessarily occasions its\r\nfall, and this fall is always greatest at the centre of the storm. When\r\nit begins to rise, the centre has passed, and when the wind has\r\nsufficiently abated to enable a ship to make sail, she may then bear\r\naway with safety; but near the middle of the hurricane, before the\r\nbarometer begins to rise, all square-sails must be dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 43, p. 250.--ANCIENT ARCHERY.\r\n\r\nWe are reminded, upon this occasion, of part of a stanza in the\r\nwell-known ballad of Chevy Chace, where an English archer aimed his\r\narrow at Sir Hugh Montgomery:--\r\n\r\n                “The _grey goose wing_ that was thereon,\r\n                 In his hearte’s blood was wett.”\r\n\r\nThe more ancient ballad, however, reads _swane-feathers_. In the “Geste\r\nof Robyn Hode,” among Mr. Garrick’s old plays, in the Museum, the\r\narrows of the outlaw and his companions are particularly described:--\r\n\r\n                 “With them they had an hundred bowes,\r\n                    The strings were well ydight;\r\n                  An hundred shefe of arrows good,\r\n                    With hedes burnish’d full bryght;\r\n                  And every arrowe an ell longe,\r\n                    With _peacocke_ well ydight,\r\n                  And rocked they were with white silk,\r\n                  It was a semely sight.”\r\n\r\nAnd Chaucer, in the description of the squyer’s yeoman, says:--\r\n\r\n           “And he was clad in cote and hode of greene;\r\n            A sheafe of _peacocke_ arrows bryght and shene,\r\n            Under his belt he bare full thriftely,\r\n            Well coude he dresse his tackle yemanly:\r\n            His arrowes drouped not with fethers lowe,\r\n            And in his hand he bare a mighty bowe.”\r\n                                      _Prol. to Cant. Tales._\r\n\r\nIn order to show the dandyism displayed by the archers of former times,\r\nit may be stated, that, in the wardrobe accounts of the 28 Edw. I. p.\r\n359, is a charge for verdigrise to stain the feathers of the arrows\r\ngreen. A wardrobe account of the 4 Edw. II. furnishes an entry for\r\npeacock arrows, “Pro duodecim flecchiis cum pennis de _pavone_, emptis\r\npro rege de 12 den.”\r\n\r\nAs this note has some connexion with the shuttlecock,[84] as well as\r\nthe arrow, we may take this opportunity of introducing a passage, which\r\nwas accidentally omitted in the text; it refers to the method of\r\nplaying this game at Turon, in Cochin China; and which is described by\r\na traveller as follows:--“Instead of using a battledoor,[85] as is the\r\ncustom in England, the players stood seven or eight in a circle; and\r\nafter running a short race, and springing from the floor, they met the\r\ndescending shuttlecock with the sole of the foot, and drove it up again\r\nwith force high in the air. The game was kept up with much animation,\r\nand seldom did the players miss their stroke, or give it a wrong\r\ndirection. The shuttlecock was made of a piece of dried skin rolled\r\nround, and bound with strings. Into this skin were inserted three\r\nfeathers, spreading out at top, but so near to each other, where they\r\nwere stuck into the skin, as to pass through the holes, little more\r\nthan a quarter of an inch square, which were always made in the centre\r\nof Cochin copper coins. We made one or two awkward attempts at the\r\ngame, not only to our own confusion, but much to the amusement of the\r\nnatives. It must, however, be remembered, that, amongst these ingenious\r\npeople, the feet assist, as auxiliaries to the hands, in the exercise\r\nof many trades, particularly that of boat-building.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  Shuttlecock, more correctly, perhaps, shuttle-_cork_, although\r\n  Skinner thinks it is called a _cock_ from its feathers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  So called from door, taken for a flat board; and battle, for\r\n  striking, _i. e._ a striking-board.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n           Note 44, p. 270.--SOUND CONVEYED BY SOLID BODIES.\r\n\r\nA beautiful experiment was lately instituted at Paris, to illustrate\r\nthis fact, by Biot. At the extremity of a cylindrical tube, upwards of\r\n3000 feet in length, a ring of metal was placed, of the same diameter\r\nas the aperture of the tube; and in the centre of this ring, in the\r\nmouth of the tube, was suspended a clock-bell and hammer. The hammer\r\nwas made to strike the ring and the bell at the same instant, so that\r\nthe sound of the ring would be transmitted to the remote end of the\r\ntube through the conducting power of the matter of the tube itself;\r\nwhile the sound of the bell would be transmitted through the medium of\r\nthe air included within the tube. The ear being then placed at the\r\nremote end of the tube, the sound of the ring, transmitted by the metal\r\nof the tube, was first distinctly heard; and, after a short interval\r\nhad elapsed, the sound of the bell, transmitted by the air in the tube,\r\nwas heard. The result of several experiments was, that the metal of the\r\ntube conducted the sound with about ten and a half times the velocity\r\nwith which it was conducted by the air; that is, at the rate of about\r\n11,865 feet per second.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Note 45, p. 288.--EXPRESSIVE MUSIC.\r\n\r\nThe biographer of Josquin des Prez, the celebrated musician, and\r\n_maestro di capella_ to Louis XII. King of France, relates an anecdote\r\nwhich may be here told in connexion with the present subject. When\r\nJosquin was first admitted into the service of the French monarch, he\r\nhad been promised a benefice by his Majesty; but this Prince, contrary\r\nto his usual habits, for he was in general both just and liberal,\r\nforgot the promise he had made; when Josquin, after suffering great\r\ninconvenience from the shortness of his Majesty’s memory, ventured by\r\nthe following expedient to remind him publicly of his promise without\r\ngiving offence. He had been commanded to compose a motet for the Chapel\r\nRoyal, on which occasion he selected part of the 119th Psalm, “_Memor\r\nesto verbi tui servo tuo_”--“_Oh think of thy servant, as concerning\r\nthy word_,” which he set in so supplicating and exquisite a manner,\r\nthat it was universally admired, particularly by the King, who was not\r\nonly touched by the music, but felt the words so effectually, that he\r\nsoon afterwards granted his petition, by conferring on him the promised\r\npreferment. For which act of justice and munificence, Josquin, with\r\nequal felicity, composed as a hymn of gratitude another part of the\r\nsame Psalm,--“_Bonitatem fecisti cum servo tuo, Domine_”--“_Oh Lord,\r\nthou has dealt graciously with thy servant._”\r\n\r\nJosquin, among musicians, was the giant of his time, and seems to have\r\narrived at universal monarchy and dominion over the affections and\r\npassions of the musical part of mankind; indeed, his compositions were\r\nas well known and as much practised throughout Europe at the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century, as those of Handel were in Europe sixty years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 46, p. 294.--IMAGINARY FORMS.\r\n\r\nThe following case, quoted by Sir David Brewster, in his work on\r\n“Natural Magic,” from the life of Peter Heaman, a Swede, who was\r\nexecuted for piracy and murder at Leith in 1822, will afford a very\r\ncurious example of the influence of the imagination in creating\r\ndistinct forms out of an irregularly shaded surface. “One remarkable\r\nthing was, one day as we mended a sail, it being a very thin one, after\r\nlaying it upon deck in folds, I took the tar-brush and tarred it over\r\nin the places which I thought needed to be strengthened. But when we\r\nhoisted it up, I was astonished to see that the tar I had put upon it\r\nrepresented a gallows and a man under it without a head. The head was\r\nlying beside him. He was complete, body, thighs, legs, arms, and in\r\nevery shape like a man. Now, I oftentimes made remarks upon it, and\r\nrepeated them to the others. I always said to them all, ‘You may depend\r\nupon it that something will happen.’ I afterwards took down the sail on\r\na calm day, and sewed a piece of canvass over the figure to cover it,\r\nfor I could not bear to have it always before my eyes.”\r\n\r\nThe curious effect of chance resemblance was particularly remarked by\r\nLeonardo da Vinci in the moss and stains on old stones. And, in our own\r\ntimes, this faculty of the imagination has not unfrequently been\r\nenlisted into the service of the fortune-teller for purposes of fraud\r\nand imposition. The following story is related on credible testimony.\r\n“A British officer, in expectation of promotion, and of being united to\r\na lady in marriage, sought a gipsy fortune-teller. The sorceress, no\r\ndoubt, had made herself well acquainted with these circumstances. On\r\nentering the room, she ordered a large glass of spring-water, into\r\nwhich she poured the white of a newly-laid egg. After shaking the\r\nmixture for some time, she so far succeeded as to induce the credulous\r\nobserver to declare that he saw most distinctly the image of the ship\r\nin which he was to hoist his flag, the church in which he was to be\r\nmarried, and his bride going with him into the church.”--_The Gipsies’\r\nAdvocate_, by J. Crabb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Note 47, p. 295.--FAIRY RINGS.\r\n\r\nDr. Wollaston, in a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions,\r\n(1807, p. 133,) relates some interesting observations he made on the\r\nprogressive changes of these rings, and which satisfactorily explain\r\ntheir origin. He observed, that some species of fungi were always to be\r\nfound at the exterior margin of the dark ring of grass if examined at\r\nthe proper season. The position of the fungi led him to believe, that\r\nprogressive increase from a central point was the probable mode of\r\nformation of the ring; and he thought it likely that the soil which had\r\nonce contributed to the support of fungi, might be so exhausted as to\r\nbe rendered incapable of producing a second crop. The defect of\r\nnutriment on one side would occasion the new roots to extend themselves\r\nsolely in the opposite direction, and would cause the circle of fungi\r\ncontinually to proceed, by annual enlargement, from the centre\r\noutwards. The luxuriance of the grass follows as a natural consequence,\r\nas the soil of an interior circle is enriched by the decayed roots of\r\nfungi of the succeeding year’s growth. During the growth of fungi, they\r\nso entirely absorb all nutriment from the soil beneath, that the\r\nherbage is often for a while destroyed, and a ring appears bare of\r\ngrass, surrounding the dark ring; but, after the fungi have ceased to\r\nappear, the soil where they had grown becomes darker, and the grass\r\nsoon vegetates again with peculiar vigour. Dr. Wollaston had many\r\nopportunities of remarking, that, when two circles interfere with each\r\nother’s progress, they do not cross each other, but are invariably\r\nobliterated between the points of contact. The exhaustion occasioned by\r\neach obstructs the progress of the other, and both are _starved_; a\r\ncircumstance which affords a strong confirmation of the above theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Note 48, p. 300.--RESONANCE.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend the nature of _reciprocated vibration_, or\r\n_resonance_, let the reader keep in his remembrance the analogy between\r\nmusical vibration, and the oscillation of the pendulum, as explained at\r\npage 275. If he well understands the phenomena of the latter, he will\r\nreadily comprehend those of the former. Galileo observed that a heavy\r\npendulum might be put in motion by the least breath of the mouth,\r\n_provided the blasts were often repeated, and made to keep time exactly\r\nwith the vibrations of the pendulum_: from the same sympathetic\r\ncommunication of vibrations will two pendulum clocks fixed to the same\r\nwall, or two watches lying upon the same table, take the same rate of\r\ngoing, though they would not agree with one another if placed in\r\nseparate apartments. Mr. Ellicot indeed observed that the pendulum of\r\none clock was even able to stop that of the other; and that the stopped\r\npendulum, after a certain time, would resume its vibrations, and in its\r\nturn stop the vibrations of the other. We have here a correct\r\nexplanation of the phenomena of _Resonance_; for the undulations\r\nexcited by a vibratory body are themselves capable of putting in motion\r\nall bodies whose pulses are coincident with their own, and consequently\r\nwith those of the primitive sounding body; hence the vibrations of a\r\nstring, when another, tuned in unison with it, is made to vibrate.\r\n\r\nUpon the same principle does the resonance, or reciprocated vibrations\r\nof columns of air, depend. We are much indebted to Mr. Wheatstone for\r\nour knowledge of this branch of acoustics; he has shown that, if a\r\ntuning-fork or a bell be sounded before a tube inclosing a column of\r\nair of the necessary length, the original sound will be augmented by\r\nthe rich resonance of that air; and that the sounds of tuning-forks, if\r\nheld before the cavity of the mouth, may be reciprocated most intensely\r\nby adjusting the alterable volume of air contained within it to the\r\npitch of the instrument; by placing, for instance, the tongue, &c. in\r\nthe position for the nasal continuous sound of _ng_ (in song), and then\r\naltering the aperture of the lips, until the loudest sound was\r\nobtained, he readily accomplished his object.\r\n\r\nIf two vibrating tuning-forks, differing in pitch, be held over a\r\nclosed tube, furnished with a moveable piston, either sound may be made\r\nto predominate, by so altering the piston as to obtain the exact column\r\nof air which will reciprocate the required sound. The same result may\r\nbe obtained by selecting two bottles (which may be tuned with water)\r\neach corresponding to the sound of a different tuning fork; on bringing\r\nboth tuning-forks to the mouth of each bottle alternately, that sound\r\nonly will be heard, in each case, which is reciprocated by the\r\nunisonant bottle; or, in other words, by that bottle which contains a\r\ncolumn of air susceptible of vibrating in unison with the fork.\r\n\r\nAmong the Javanese instruments brought to England by the late Sir\r\nStamford Raffles, there is one called the _gender_, in which the\r\nresonances of columns of air are employed to augment, we might almost\r\nsay to render audible, the sounds of vibrating metallic plates. Under\r\neach of these plates is placed an upright bamboo, containing a column\r\nof air of the proper length to reciprocate the lowest sound of such\r\nplate. If the aperture of the bamboo be covered with pasteboard, and\r\nits corresponding plate be struck, a number of acute sounds only\r\n(depending on the more numerous subdivisions of the plate) will be\r\nheard; but, on removing the pasteboard, an additional deep rich tone is\r\nproduced by the resonance of the column of air within the tube.\r\n\r\nIt is only by a knowledge of this principle that the theory of the\r\nGuimbarde, or Jew’s harp, can be well understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 49, p. 300.--THE JEW’S HARP.\r\n\r\nThe Memoires of Madame de Genlis first made known the astonishing\r\npowers of a poor German soldier on the Jew’s harp. This musician was in\r\nthe service of Frederick the Great, and finding himself one night on\r\nduty under the windows of the king, played the Jew’s harp with so much\r\nskill, that Frederick, who was a great amateur of music, thought he\r\nheard a distinct orchestra. Surprised on learning that such an effect\r\ncould be produced by a single man with two Jew’s harps, he ordered him\r\ninto his presence; the soldier refused, alleging that he could only be\r\nrelieved by his colonel; and that, if he obeyed, the king would punish\r\nhim the next day for having failed to do his duty. Being presented the\r\nfollowing morning to Frederick, he was heard with admiration, and\r\nreceived his discharge and fifty dollars. This artist, whose name\r\nMadame de Genlis does not mention, is called Koch; he has not any\r\nknowledge of music, but owes his success entirely to a natural taste.\r\nHe has made his fortune by travelling about, and performing in public\r\nand private; and is now living retired at Vienna, at the advanced age\r\nof more than eighty years. He used two Jew’s harps at once, in the same\r\nmanner as the peasants of the Tyrol; and produced, without doubt, the\r\nharmony of two notes struck at the same moment, which was considered by\r\nthe musically-curious as somewhat extraordinary, when the limited\r\npowers of the instrument were remembered. It was Koch’s custom to\r\nrequire that all the lights should be extinguished, in order that the\r\nillusion produced by his playing might be increased.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved, however, for Mr. Eulenstein to acquire a musical\r\nreputation from the Jew’s harp. After ten years of close application\r\nand study, this young artist has attained a perfect mastery over this\r\nuntractable instrument. In giving some account of the Jew’s harp,\r\nconsidered as a medium for musical sounds, we shall only present the\r\nresult of his discoveries. This little instrument, taken singly, gives\r\nwhatever grave sound you may wish to produce, as a _third_, a _fifth_,\r\nor an _octave_. If the grave tonic is not heard in the bass Jew’s harp,\r\nit must be attributed not to the defectiveness of the instrument, but\r\nto the player. In examining this result, you cannot help remarking the\r\norder and unity established by nature in harmonical bodies, which\r\nplaces music in the rank of exact sciences. The Jew’s harp has three\r\ndifferent tones; the bass tones of the first octave bear some\r\nresemblance to those of the flute and clarionet; those of the middle\r\nand high to the _vox humana_ of some organs; lastly, the harmonical\r\nsounds are exactly like those of the _harmonica_. It is conceived that\r\nthis diversity of tones affords already a great variety in the\r\nexecution, which is always looked upon as being feeble and trifling, on\r\naccount of the smallness of the instrument. It was not thought possible\r\nto derive much pleasure from any attempt which could be made to conquer\r\nthe difficulties of so limited an instrument; because, in the extent of\r\nthese octaves, there were a number of spaces which could not be filled\r\nup by the talent of the player; besides, the most simple modulation\r\nbecame impossible. Mr. Eulenstein has remedied that inconvenience, by\r\njoining sixteen Jew’s harps, which he tunes by placing smaller or\r\ngreater quantities of sealing-wax at the extremity of the tongue. Each\r\nharp then sounds one of the notes of the gamut, diatonic or chromatic;\r\nand the performer can fill all the intervals, and pass all the tones,\r\nby changing the harp. That these mutations may not interrupt the\r\nmeasure, one harp must always be kept in advance, in the same manner as\r\na good reader advances the eye, not upon the word which he pronounces,\r\nbut upon that which follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Note 50, p. 316.--VERBAL TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nThis project has lately been revived; in a late number of the _Revue\r\nEncyclopédique_ there is a proposal to communicate verbal intelligence,\r\nin a few moments, to vast distances; and this not by symbols, as in the\r\nTelegraph, but in distinct articulate sounds uttered by the human\r\nvoice. The plan is said to have originated with an Englishman, Mr.\r\nDick, according to whose experiments the human voice may be made\r\nintelligible at the distance of twenty-five or thirty miles. It has\r\nbeen stated, in Note 44, that the celebrated Biot had ascertained that\r\nsound travels more than ten times quicker when transmitted by solid\r\nbodies, or through tubes, than when it passes through the open air; at\r\nthe distance of more than half a mile the low voice of a man was\r\ndistinctly heard. Father Kircher relates in some of his works, that the\r\nlabourers employed in the subterranean aqueducts of Rome heard each\r\nother at the distance of several miles. The note which follows was\r\npublished in the early edition of this work, before the subject\r\nattracted any notice, or any railroad had been completed. It is\r\ntherefore reprinted without alteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Note 51, p. 316.--ELECTRICAL TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nIt has often occurred to the author of these pages, during his\r\nreveries, that the means of conveying intelligence with immense\r\nrapidity may be hereafter invented by the Electrician.--Should a system\r\nof railways be established throughout the country, it might lead to\r\nsome expedient by which such a desideratum could be accomplished\r\nthrough the medium of electrical discharges. Upon this subject we have\r\naccidentally fallen upon a curious notice in Arthur Young’s Travels in\r\nFrance (vol. i. p. 65). “M. Lomond has made a very curious discovery in\r\nelectricity; you write two or three words on a paper, he takes it with\r\nhim into his room, and there turns a machine inclosed in a cylindrical\r\ncase, at the top of which is an electrometer of pith balls; by means of\r\na wire, a connexion is made with a similar cylinder and electrometer in\r\na distant apartment, and his wife, by remarking the corresponding\r\nmotions of the balls, writes down the words they indicate; from which\r\nit appears that he has formed an _Alphabet of Motion_. As the length of\r\nthe conducting wire makes no difference in the effect, a correspondence\r\nmight be carried on at any distance, as, for example, within or without\r\na besieged town; or for purposes much more interesting and useful.\r\nWhatever the uses may be, the invention is beautiful.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Note 52, p. 368.--CARRIER PIGEONS.\r\n\r\nThe _carrier_ is a variety of the common domestic pigeon, and which,\r\nfrom the superior attachment that it shows to its native place, is\r\nemployed in many countries as the most expeditious courier. The letters\r\nare tied under its wing, it is let loose, and in a very short space\r\nreturns to the home it was brought from, with its advices. This\r\npractice was much in vogue in the East; and at Scanderoon, till of late\r\nyears, it was used on the arrival of a ship, to give the merchants at\r\nAleppo a more expeditious notice than could be done by any other means.\r\nIn our own country, these aerial messengers have been employed for a\r\nvery singular purpose, having been let loose at Tyburn at the moment\r\nthe fatal cart was drawn away, to notify to distant friends the\r\ndeparture of the unhappy criminal.\r\n\r\nIn the East, the use of these birds seems to have been greatly\r\nimproved, by having, if we may use the expression, relays of them ready\r\nto spread intelligence to all parts of the country; thus it is stated\r\nby Ariosto (canto 15), that the governor of Damiata circulated the news\r\nof the death of Orrilo. “As soon as the commandant of Damiata heard\r\nthat Orrilo was dead, he let loose a pigeon, under whose wing he had\r\ntied a letter. This fled to Cairo, from whence a second was despatched\r\nto another place, as is usual; so that, in a very few hours, all Egypt\r\nwas acquainted with the death of Orrilo.”\r\n\r\nBut the simple use of them was known in very early times. Anacreon\r\ntells us (ode ix.) that he conveyed his billet-doux to Bathyllus by a\r\ndove.\r\n\r\nTaurosthenes also, by means of a pigeon he had decked with purple, sent\r\nadvice to his father, who lived in the isle of Ægina, of his victory in\r\nthe olympic games, on the very day he had obtained it.[86] And, at the\r\nsiege of Modena, Hirtius without, and Brutus within the walls, kept, by\r\nthe help of pigeons, a constant correspondence; baffling every\r\nstratagem of the besieger, Antony, to intercept their couriers. In the\r\ntimes of the crusades, there are many more instances of these birds of\r\npeace being employed in the service of war: Joinville relates one\r\nduring the crusade of _Saint Louis_, and Tasso another, during the\r\nsiege of Jerusalem.--_Pennant’s British Zoology._\r\n\r\nThe Dutch variety is the most valuable; a pair of the best kind being\r\nworth from five to eight pounds. It is lighter than the English pigeon,\r\nand flies nearly as fast again. It proceeds at the rate of 60 miles an\r\nhour, and has been known to complete a journey of 800 miles, but this;\r\nit is presumed, is not continuous, but assisted by occasional rest. The\r\nbird learns but one lesson; it may carry from Antwerp to London, or to\r\nany other place, but it will only pass between two such places. It\r\nevidently travels by sight; when tossed, it circles, then rises in a\r\nspiral, observes its route and darts off. It will not fly at night;\r\nand, should the day be foggy, it is delayed, and sometimes lost.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  _Ælian. Var. Hist._ lib. ix. c. 2. Pliny, lib. x. c. 24, says that\r\n  swallows have been made use of for the same purpose. Their rate of\r\n  flight has been estimated at a mile in a minute, for ten hours, or\r\n  600 miles per day.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Note 53, p. 371.--ORIGIN OF POPULAR CEREMONIES.\r\n\r\nThe soothsayers attributed many mystic properties to the coral; and it\r\nwas believed to be capable of giving protection against the influence\r\nof _Evil Eyes_: it was even supposed that coral would drive away devils\r\nand evil spirits; hence arose the custom of wearing amulets composed of\r\nit around the neck, and of making crowns of it. Pliny and Dioscorides\r\nare very loud in the praises of the medicinal properties of this\r\nsubstance; and Paracelsus says that it should be worn round the necks\r\nof infants, as an admirable preservative against fits, sorcery, charms,\r\nand even against poison. It is a curious circumstance that the same\r\nsuperstitious belief should exist among the negroes of the West Indies,\r\nwho affirm that the colour of coral is always affected by the state of\r\nhealth of the wearer, it becoming paler in disease. In Sicily it is\r\nalso commonly worn as an amulet by persons of all ranks; as a security\r\nagainst an _evil eye_, a small twisted piece, somewhat resembling a\r\nhorn, is worn at the watch-chain, under the name of _Buon Fortuna_, and\r\nis occasionally pointed at those who are supposed to entertain evil\r\nintention. His late Sicilian Majesty was celebrated for his faith in,\r\nand frequent use of, the _buon fortuna_.--But to return to the coral\r\nusually suspended around the necks of children in our own country. In\r\naddition to the supposed virtues of the coral, it may be remarked that\r\nsilver bells are usually attached to it, which are generally regarded\r\nas mere accompaniments to amuse the child by their jingle; but the fact\r\nis, that they have a different origin, having been designed to frighten\r\naway evil spirits. For the same superstitious objects were bells\r\nintroduced into our churches as a species of charm against storms and\r\nthunder, and the assaults of Satan.\r\n\r\nIn farther illustration of the truth, that a custom has frequently\r\nsurvived the tradition of its origin, it may be here observed, that the\r\ncommon practice of persons who are unable to write, making their mark\r\nor _cross_, is derived from our Saxon ancestors, who affixed the sign\r\nof the cross, as a signature to a deed, whether they could write or\r\nnot. Several charters still remain, to which kings and persons of great\r\neminence affix “_Signum Crucis manu propriá pro ignorantiá literarum_.”\r\nHence is derived the expression of _signing_ instead of _subscribing_ a\r\npaper. In like manner, the physician of the present day continues to\r\nprefix to his prescriptions the letter R, which is generally supposed\r\nto mean _Recipe_, but which, in truth, is a relict of the astrological\r\nsymbol of Jupiter, formerly used as a species of superstitious\r\ninvocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Note 54, p. 379.--INVENTION OF THE GAME OF CHESS.\r\n\r\nAlphesadi, an Arabian writer, quoted by Montucla in his _Histoire des\r\nMathematiques_, expressly mentions the invention of chess as of\r\nIndian origin, and relates the following very curious Indian\r\ntradition:--Ardschir, King of the Persians, having invented the game\r\nof _Tric-Trac_, and being exceedingly vain of it, a certain Indian,\r\nnamed Sessa, the son of Daher, invented the game of chess, and\r\npresented his chess-board and chess-men to the king of the Indies.\r\nThe sovereign was so much pleased, that he desired Sessa to name his\r\nreward, when this man made the apparently modest request, that he\r\nshould receive as a gift so much corn as could be estimated by\r\nbeginning with one grain, and doubling as many times as there were\r\nsquares upon the chess-board, viz. 64. The king felt displeased at\r\nhaving his munificence thus slighted by a request so limited and so\r\nunworthy to be a gift from royalty; but, as Sessa remained firm,\r\norders were given to the chief minister that he should be satisfied:\r\nwhen, however, the visir had by calculation ascertained the enormous\r\nquantity of corn which would be required, he waited upon the king,\r\nand with some difficulty convinced him of the fact; upon which the\r\nking sent for Sessa,--and said to him, that he admired his powers of\r\ncalculation even more than the ingenuity of the game which he had\r\npresented to him, and, in respect to his promise as to the corn, he\r\nwas compelled to acknowledge himself to be insolvent.\r\n\r\nDr. Wallis, the friend of Sir Isaac Newton, and Savilian Professor of\r\nOxford, found that the quantity of corn would be such as to be capable\r\nof forming a pyramid, the measurement of which would be nine English\r\nmiles in height, and nine similar miles for each of the four sides of\r\nthe base. After this, Montucla also states some elaborate calculations\r\nmade by himself, and proves, amongst other remarkable facts, that the\r\nquantity of corn in question would cover 162,000 square leagues to the\r\ndepth of one foot, French measure, which would be at least three times\r\nthe extent of the surface of France as it was about the year 1796, and\r\nwhich he estimates at 50,000 square leagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Note 55, p. 388.--AN ARITHMETICAL TRICK.\r\n\r\nThis problem is to be found in Hutton’s Recreations, and is stated as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n“A person having in one hand an _even_ number of shillings, and in the\r\nother an _odd_, to tell in which hand he has the even number.”\r\n\r\n“Desire the person to multiply the number in the right hand by any even\r\nnumber whatever, and that in the left by any odd number; then bid him\r\nto add together the two products, and if the whole sum be odd, the even\r\nnumber of shillings will be in the right hand, and the odd number in\r\nthe left; if the sum be even, the contrary will be the case. By a\r\nsimilar process, a person having in one hand a piece of gold, and in\r\nthe other a piece of silver, we can tell in which hand he holds the\r\ngold, and in which the silver. For this purpose, some value represented\r\nby an even number, such as 8, must be assigned to the gold, and a value\r\nrepresented by an odd number, such as 3, must be assigned to the\r\nsilver; after which the operation is exactly the same as in the\r\npreceding example.\r\n\r\n“To conceal the artifice better, it will be sufficient to ask whether\r\nthe sum of the two products can be halved without a remainder; for, in\r\nthat case, the total will be even, and in the contrary case odd.\r\n\r\n“It will be readily seen that the pieces, instead of being in the two\r\nhands of the same person, may be supposed to be in the hands of two\r\npersons, one of whom has the even number, or piece of gold, and the\r\nother the odd number, or piece of silver. The same operations may then\r\nbe performed in regard to these two persons, as are performed in regard\r\nto the two hands of the same person, calling the one, privately, the\r\nright, and the other the left.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                Note 56, p. 389.--AN ALGEBRAIC PROBLEM.\r\n\r\nIt is by discovering the number of counters left on the board that this\r\ntrick is performed. By means of a table the problem may be immediately\r\nsolved; but as such a reference would be inconvenient, and, indeed,\r\ndestructive to the magic of the trick, a Latin verse is substituted,\r\nwhich may be easily carried in the memory, and will be found to answer\r\nall the purposes of a table. In order, however, that the reader may\r\nbecome thoroughly acquainted with the machinery of the trick, we shall\r\nexplain it in the words of its author. The problem is stated as\r\nfollows: “_Three things being privately distributed to three persons,\r\nto guess that which each has got._”\r\n\r\nLet the three things be a ring, a shilling, and a glove. Call the ring\r\nA, the shilling E, and the glove I; and in your own mind distinguish\r\nthe persons by calling them first, second, and third. Then take\r\ntwenty-four counters, and give one of them to the first person, two to\r\nthe second, and three to the third. Place the remaining eighteen on the\r\ntable, and then retire, that the three persons may distribute among\r\nthemselves the three things proposed without your observing them. When\r\nthe distribution has been made, desire the person who has the ring to\r\ntake from the remaining eighteen counters as many as he has already;\r\nthe one who has the shilling to take twice as many as he has already,\r\nand the person who has the glove to take four times as many; according\r\nto the above supposition then, the first person has taken one, the\r\nsecond four, and the third twelve; consequently, one counter only\r\nremains on the table. When this is done, you may return, and, by the\r\nnumber left, can discover what thing each person has taken, by\r\nemploying the following words:----\r\n\r\n               1       2       3       5       6       7\r\n            _Salve_ _certa_ _animæ_ _semita_ _vita_ _quies._\r\n\r\nTo make use of these words, you must recollect, that in all cases there\r\ncan remain only 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 counters, and never 4. It must\r\nlikewise be observed, that each syllable contains one of the vowels,\r\nwhich we have made to represent the things proposed, and that the first\r\nsyllable of each word must be considered as representing the first\r\nperson, and the second syllable the second. This being comprehended, if\r\nthere remains only one counter, you must employ the first word, or\r\nrather the two first syllables, _sal-ve_, the first of which, that\r\ncontaining A, shows that the first person has the ring represented by\r\nA; and the second syllable, that containing E, shows that the second\r\nperson has the shilling represented by E; from which you may easily\r\nconclude that the third person has the glove. If two counters should\r\nremain, you must take the second word _cer-ta_, the first syllable of\r\nwhich, containing E, will show that the first person has the shilling\r\nrepresented by E; and the second syllable, containing A, will indicate\r\nthat the second person has the ring represented by A. In general,\r\nwhatever number of counters remain, that word of the verse which is\r\npointed out by the same number must be employed.\r\n\r\nInstead of the above Latin verse, the following French one might be\r\nused:--\r\n\r\n            1        2       3       5         6          7\r\n        _Par fer_ _César_ _jadis_ _devint_ _si grand_ _prince._\r\n\r\nIn using the above line, it must be considered as consisting only of\r\nsix words.\r\n\r\nThis problem might be proposed in a manner somewhat different, and\r\nmight be applied to more than three persons. Those of our readers who\r\nmay be desirous of further information on the subject, must consult\r\nBachet in the 25th of his _Problèmes plaisantes et délectables_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\nIn order to get illustrations close to long descriptions and\r\ndiscussions of them, a few long paragraphs have been divided in two at\r\nlogical places.\r\n\r\nOne obvious typographical error in punctuation was corrected.\r\n\r\nAll footnotes have been relocated at the ends of chapters.\r\n\r\nDescriptive captions have been added to the text version for many\r\nillustrations by the Transcribers and are deemed by them to be in the\r\npublic domain.",
