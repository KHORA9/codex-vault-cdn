NEW-YORK, JULY 1, 1851. No. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFITZ-GREENE HALLECK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of _Fanny_, _Burns_, _Marco Bozzaris_, etc., was born at\r\nGuilford in Connecticut, in August, 1795, and in his eighteenth year\r\nremoved to the city of New-York. He evinced a taste for poetry and wrote\r\nverses at a very early period; but the oldest of his effusions I have\r\nseen are those under the signatures of \"Croaker,\" and \"Croaker & Co.,\"\r\npublished in the _New-York Evening Post_, in 1819. In the production of\r\nthese pleasant satires he was associated with Doctor DRAKE, author of\r\nthe _Culprit Fay_, a man of brilliant wit and delicate fancy, with whom\r\nhe was long intimate. DRAKE died in 1820, and his friend soon after\r\nwrote for the _New-York Review_, then edited by BRYANT, the lines to his\r\nmemory, beginning--\r\n\r\n    \"Green be the turf above thee,\r\n      Friend of my better days,\r\n    None knew thee but to love thee,\r\n      Nor named thee but to praise.\"\r\n\r\nNear the close of 1819, Halleck published Fanny, his longest poem, which\r\nwas written and printed in three weeks; in 1827 a small volume,\r\ncontaining Alnwick Castle, Marco Bozzaris, and a few other pieces, which\r\nhad previously appeared in various miscellanies; and in 1836, an edition\r\nof all his serious and more finished compositions. The last and most\r\ncomplete edition of his works appeared two years ago in a splendid\r\nvolume from the press of the Appletons.\r\n\r\nIt was Lord Byron's opinion that a poet is always to be ranked according\r\nto his execution, and not according to his branch of the art. \"The poet\r\nwho executes best,\" said he, \"is the highest, whatever his department,\r\nand will ever be so rated in the world's esteem.\" We have no doubt of\r\nthe justness of that remark; it is the only principle from which sound\r\ncriticism can proceed, and upon this basis the reputations of the past\r\nhave been made up. Considered in this light, Mr. Halleck must be\r\npronounced not merely one of the chief ornaments of new literature, but\r\none of the great masters in a language, classical and immortal, for the\r\nproductions of genius which have illustrated and enlarged its\r\ncapacities. There is in his compositions an essential pervading grace, a\r\nnatural brilliancy of wit, a freedom yet refinement of sentiment, a\r\nsparkling flow of fancy, and a power of personification, combined with\r\nsuch high and careful finish, and such exquisite nicety of taste, that\r\nthe larger part of them must be pronounced models almost faultless in\r\nthe classes to which they belong. They appear to me to show a genuine\r\ninsight into the principles of art, and a fine use of its resources: and\r\nafter all that has been said and written about nature, strength, and\r\noriginality, the true secret of fame, the real magic of genius is not\r\nforce, not passion, not novelty, but art. Look all through Milton; look\r\nat the best passages of Shakspeare; look at the monuments, \"all Greek\r\nand glorious,\" which have come down to us from ancient times, what\r\nstrikes us principally, and it might almost be said only, is the\r\nwonderfully artificial character of the composition; it is the principle\r\nof _their_ immortality, and without it no poem can be long-lived. It may\r\nbe easy to acquire popularity, and easy to display art in writing, but\r\nhe who obtains popularity by the means and employment of careful,\r\nelaborate art, may be confident that his reputation is fixed upon a sure\r\nbasis. This--for his careless playing with the muse, by which one time\r\nhe kept the town alive, is scarcely remembered now--this, it seems to\r\nme, Mr. Halleck has done; Mr. Halleck, Mr. Bryant, and Mr. Poe, have\r\ndone above all our authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS OF NEW-YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo city in the world is more justly entitled to consideration for\r\nactive, judicious, and liberal benevolence, than New-York, though it\r\nmust be confessed that in some respects others may make a more splendid\r\ndisplay of the machinery of philanthropy, and even seem in the\r\nsubscriptions made every year to particular charities to be more\r\nliberal. This is easily explained, by the fact that, while the people of\r\nNew-York are behind none in thrift and virtue, the great commercial\r\ncapital has nevertheless more than twice as much pauperism and crime,\r\nfrom emigration and importation, as any other city in the world.\r\nForeigners who come here of their own will, foreigners who pay their own\r\npassages to our country, are always welcome; but those who are banished\r\nfrom their native places for crime, or deported for idleness,\r\nimbecility, or any cause that renders them a burthen to the public,\r\nshould be shut out from our ports by some more efficient means than have\r\nyet been devised for the purpose. This class alone demands of the\r\norganized and individual benevolence of New-York a larger amount of\r\nmoney every year than is paid for the relief of human wretchedness in\r\nany other city.\r\n\r\nThe benevolent institutions of New-York are remarkable for their number,\r\nso that in no department does an establishment indicate the attention\r\ngiven to the particular necessities to which it is devoted; and not only\r\ndo the Quakers and the Jews, as in other places, take care of their own\r\npoor, but almost every church, no matter of what denomination, is here a\r\nwell organized society for the relief of the unfortunate among its\r\nmembers, and to a degree, within the sphere of its influence. Where\r\nwealth has been acquired by its possessor, there is apt to be a generous\r\nconsideration for the less fortunate, and no city had ever so many of\r\nthe philanthropic merchants, of whom the late Samuel Ward was a type,\r\nwho are as judicious as they are liberal in shielding the oppressed,\r\nstrengthening the weak, and guiding the unwary, in pointing out ways and\r\nfurnishing means to the young who seem born to the inheritance of\r\ndegradation, and in saving others from sufferings caused by improvidence\r\nor inevitable misfortune.\r\n\r\nWe propose no account of the humane societies of New-York, but only a\r\nbrief mention of some few of those whose edifices are most likely to\r\narrest the attention of strangers, as from several directions they\r\napproach the city.\r\n\r\nThe Institution for the Blind is in the square bounded by Eighth and\r\nNinth Avenues and by Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth Streets, and is\r\nbuilt of marble. The society was founded by Mr. Samuel Wood, aided\r\nlargely by Dr. Samuel Ackerley, and was incorporated in 1831. In the\r\nspring of the following year the managers reported that they had made\r\narrangements for instructing two or three blind children, \"by way of\r\nexperiment,\" and from that period the increase of its action and\r\nresources has been constant. Pupils are received for one hundred and\r\nthirty dollars a year, and the State has made provision for the\r\nmaintenance at the institution of one hundred and twenty-eight indigent\r\nblind persons, so that it is always nearly full. The system of\r\ninstruction includes the common English studies, with philosophy and the\r\nhigher mathematics, mechanics, vocal and instrumental music, and, when\r\ndesired, such trades as the blind can advantageously practise. The\r\nlibrary contains more than seven hundred volumes in raised letters,\r\nbesides a considerable collection printed in ink. The occasional\r\nexhibitions of the pupils have excited much attention, and the\r\ninstitution may be regarded as altogether one of the most successful of\r\nits kind in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INSTITUTION FOR THE BLIND.]\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the celebrated Isabella Graham founded the Society for the\r\nRelief of Poor Widows with Small Children, and in the spring of 1806,\r\nMrs. Alexander Hamilton, the widow of the great statesman, and Mrs.\r\nBethune, a daughter of Mrs. Graham and the mother of the Rev. Dr.\r\nBethune, with several associates, established, as a branch of that\r\ninstitution, the Orphan Asylum of the City of New-York, which was\r\nincorporated in 1807. Its first edifice was in Bank-street, but the\r\nenlargement of its activity and resources in 1836 led to the purchase of\r\nthe ample and beautiful grounds near Eightieth-street, five miles from\r\nthe City Hall, from which the edifice described in the engraving looks\r\ndown on the Hudson, and forms one of the most picturesque views which\r\ngreet the traveller who approaches the city by the river from the north.\r\nThe eminent women whom we have mentioned continue, after nearly half a\r\ncentury, to be active in its management.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ORPHAN ASYLUM.]\r\n\r\nThere is also a Protestant Half-Orphan Asylum in Sixth Avenue, a Roman\r\nCatholic Orphan Asylum, conducted by Sisters of Charity, in Mott-street,\r\na Roman Catholic Half-Orphan Asylum in Eleventh-street, a very large\r\nColored Orphan Asylum in Twelfth-street, and several other\r\nestablishments of the same description, supported by public or private\r\ncharity, in different parts of the city. New-York is second only to\r\nPhiladelphia in the liberality of its provision for orphan children: the\r\ncollege founded by Stephen Girard places the latter city in this respect\r\nbefore any other in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW-YORK INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB.]\r\n\r\nThe Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb was\r\nincorporated in 1817, the first pupils were received in the following\r\nyear, and in 1827 the foundation was laid for the edifice now occupied\r\nby the institution in Fiftieth street, near Fourth Avenue. Since 1831,\r\nthe President, Harvey P. Peet, LL.D. has had the chief direction of its\r\naffairs, and its income, the number of its inmates, and its good\r\nreputation, have rapidly increased.\r\n\r\nThe New-York Hospital in Broadway, the Bloomingdale Asylum for the\r\nInsane, the Marine Hospital, the Seamen's Retreat, the Sailors' Snug\r\nHarbor, and the numerous establishments (several of which have large and\r\nsplendid edifices) under the control of the municipal authorities, we\r\nmay describe at length hereafter. The illustrations of this article\r\nevince the liberal style as well as the extent of the institutions which\r\nthe position of New-York has rendered it necessary for her citizens to\r\nestablish and support.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUNATIC ASYLUM, BLACKWELL'S ISLAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVENTURES AND OBSERVATIONS IN NICARAGUA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already announced in these pages that Mr. SQUIER, who was lately\r\nrepresentative of the United States in Nicaragua, had in preparation for\r\nthe press an account of his residence in that interesting country, and\r\nexpressed an opinion that his work would surpass in interest and value\r\nthe entire library of English and French publications on the subject. An\r\nexamination of some of the sheets justifies our expectations; Mr. Squier\r\nmust hereafter be ranked among the most successful travel-writers as\r\nwell as antiquaries of the time; he knows what to observe and how to\r\nobserve, and his relations with the Nicaraguans were such that no\r\ntraveller had ever better opportunities for the acquisition of facts or\r\nthe formation of judgments. His work will soon be published in a\r\nprofusely illustrated octavo by Mr. Putnam. A pleasant specimen of the\r\nauthor's style is afforded by the following sketch of an evening ride on\r\nthe banks of the lake of Granada, and of the signoras of that\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n\"After a pleasant interview of half an hour we bade Don Jose \"_buena\r\ntarde_,\" and galloped down to the shores of the lake, just as the sun\r\nwas setting, throwing the whole beach in the shade, while the fairy\r\n\"Corales\" were swimming in the evening light. The shore was ten-fold\r\nmore animated than when we landed the day previously; men on horseback,\r\nwomen on foot, sailors, fishermen, idlers, children, and a swarm of\r\nwater-carriers, mingling together, gave life to the scene; while boats\r\nand graceful canoes drawn up on the beach, barges rocking at their\r\nanchors outside, the grim old fort frowning above, and the green border\r\nof trees, with bars of sunlight streaming between them, all contributed\r\nto heighten and give effect to the picture. We rode up the glacis of the\r\nold castle, through its broken archway, into its elevated area, and\r\nlooked out beyond the broad and beautiful lake, upon the distant shores\r\nof Chontales, with its earthquake-river, hills, and rugged volcanic\r\ncraters. Their rough features were brought out sharply and distinctly in\r\nthe slanting light which gilded the western slope of the gigantic\r\nvolcano of Momobacho, while its eastern declivity slept in purple\r\nshadow. We were absorbed in contemplating, one by one, these varied\r\nbeauties, when the bells of the city struck the hour of the \"oracion.\"\r\nIn an instant every voice was hushed, the horseman reined in his steed,\r\nthe rope dropped from the hands of the sailor, the sentinel on the fort\r\nstopped short in his round; even the water-jar was left half filled,\r\nevery head was uncovered, and every lip moved in prayer. The merry waves\r\nseemed to break more gently on the shore in harmony with the vibrations\r\nof the distant bells, while the subdued hum of reverential voices filled\r\nthe pauses between. There was something almost magical in this sudden\r\nhush of the multitude, and its apparent entire absorption in its\r\ndevotions, which could not fail deeply to impress the stranger\r\nwitnessing it for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"No sooner, however, had the bells ceased to toll and struck up the\r\nconcluding joyful chime, than the crowd on the shore resumed its life\r\nand gayety, while we put spurs to our horses and darted through their\r\nmidst on our return to the city. The commandant and his companions would\r\nonly leave me at my door, where we were saluted by our host with, \"Saved\r\nyour distance, gentlemen, dinner's ready!\"\r\n\r\n\"An evening visit to the Senorita Teresa, finished our first entire day\r\nin Granada. This young lady had been educated in the United States,\r\nspoke English very well, and was withal a proficient in\r\nmusic--accomplishments which we never before learned to estimate at\r\ntheir true value. It was worth something to hear well executed passages\r\nfrom familiar operas, amidst tangible and not painted orange trees and\r\npalms, and in an atmosphere really loaded with tropical perfumes,\r\ninstead of the odors of oil-pots and gas lights. Eight o'clock was the\r\nsignal for general withdrawal from the streets, for then commenced the\r\nreign of the military police, and the city became at once still and\r\nquiet. The occasional barking of a dog, the tinkling of a distant\r\nguitar, the soughing of the evening wind amongst the trees of the\r\ncourtyard, the measured tread and graduated \"alertas!\" of the sentinels,\r\nwere the only interruptions to the almost sepulchral silence. While\r\nreturning to our quarters we were startled by the \"Quien vive?\" of the\r\nsentinel, uttered in a tone absolutely ferocious, and as these fellows\r\nrarely parleyed long, we answered with all expedition, \"La Patria,\"\r\nwhich was followed on the instant by \"Que gente?\" \"Americanos del\r\nNorte.\" This was enough--these we found were magic words which opened\r\nevery heart and every door in all Nicaragua. They never failed us. We\r\nfelt proud to know that no such charm was attached to \"Ingleses,\"\r\n\"Alemanes\", or \"Franceses.\"\r\n\r\n\"The day following, in accordance with the \"costumbres del pais,\" the\r\ncustoms of the country, we returned the visits of the preceding day, and\r\nbegan to see more of the domestic and social life of the citizens of\r\nGranada. We found all of the residences comfortable, and many elegant,\r\ngoverned by mistresses simple, but graceful and confiding in their\r\nmanners. They were frank in their conversation and inquired with the\r\nutmost _naivete_ whether I was married or intended to be, and if the\r\nladies of El Norte would probably visit Granada, when the \"Vapores\r\ngrandes,\" the great steamers came to run to San Juan, and the\r\n\"Vaporcitas\" steameretts, to ply on the lake and river. They had heard\r\nof a Mr. Estevens (their nearest approach to Stephens), who had written\r\na book about their \"pobre pais,\" their poor country, and were anxious to\r\nknow what he had said of them, and whether our people really regarded\r\nthem as \"esclavos y brutes sin verguenza,\" slaves and brutes without\r\nshame, as the abominable English (los malditos Ingleses) had represented\r\nthem. They were also very anxious to know whether the party of\r\nCalifornians which had passed through, were \"gente commun,\" common\r\npeople, or \"caballeros,\" gentlemen, upon which point, however, we were\r\ndiplomatically evasive, for there was more in the inquiry than we chose\r\nto notice. Our lady had heard that I was a great antiquarian, and,\r\nanticipatory to my visit, had got together a most incongruous collection\r\nof curiosities, from \"vasos antiguos,\" fragments of pottery, and stone\r\nhatchets, down to an extraordinary pair of horn spectacles and a\r\npreposterously distorted hog's hoof,--all of which she insisted on\r\nsending to my quarters, which she did, with some rare birds, and a\r\nplate of dulces! At every house we found a table spread with wines and\r\nsweetmeats, and bearing a silver brazier filled with burning coals, for\r\nthe greater convenience of lighting cigars. I excited much surprise by\r\ndeclining to smoke, on the ground that I had never done so; but the\r\nladies insisted on my taking a \"cigarita,\" which they said wouldn't\r\ninjure a new-born babe, and paid me the compliment of lighting it with\r\ntheir own fair lips, after which it would have been rank treason to\r\netiquette, and would have ruined my reputation for gallantry, had I\r\nrefused. I at first endeavored to shirk the responsibility of smoking by\r\nthrusting them into my vest pocket, but found that as soon as one\r\ndisappeared, another was presented, so I was obliged \"to face the music\"\r\nin the end. In every sala we found a large hammock suspended from the\r\nwalls, which was invariably tendered to the visitor, even when there\r\nwere easy chairs and sofas in the room. This is the seat of honor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESIDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES CHARGE D'AFFAIRES, SAN\r\nJUAN DE NICARAGUA.]\r\n\r\n\"The women of pure Spanish stock are very fair, and have the\r\n_embonpoint_ which characterizes the sex under the tropics. Their dress,\r\nexcept in a few instances where the stiff costume of our own country had\r\nbeen adopted, was exceedingly loose and flowing, leaving the neck and\r\narms exposed. The entire dress was often pure white, but generally the\r\nskirt, or _nagua_, was of some flowered stuff, in which case the\r\n_guipil_ (_anglice_ vandyke) was white, heavily trimmed with lace. Satin\r\nslippers, a red or purple sash wound loosely round the waist, and a\r\nrosary sustaining a little golden cross, with a narrow golden band, or a\r\nstring of pearls extending around the forehead and binding the hair,\r\nwhich often fell in luxuriant waves upon their shoulders, completed a\r\ncostume as novel as it was graceful and picturesque. To all this add the\r\nsuperior attractions of an oval face, regular features, large and\r\nlustrous black eyes, small mouth, pearly white teeth, and tiny hands and\r\nfeet, and withal a low but clear voice, and the reader has a picture of\r\na Central American lady of pure stock. A large number of the women have,\r\nhowever, an infusion of other families and races, from the Saracen to\r\nthe Indian and the Negro, in every degree of intermixture. And as tastes\r\ndiffer, so may opinions as to whether the tinge of brown, through which\r\nthe blood glows with a peach-like bloom, in the complexion of the girl\r\nwho may trace her lineage to the Caziques upon one side, and the haughty\r\ngrandees of Andalusia and Seville on the other, superadded, as it\r\nusually is, to a greater lightness of figure and animation of\r\nface,--whether this is not a more real beauty than that of the fair and\r\nmore languid Senora, whose white and almost transparent skin bespeaks a\r\npurer ancestry. Nor is the Indian girl, with her full, lithe figure,\r\nlong, glossy hair, quick and mischievous eyes, who walks erect as a\r\ngrenadier beneath her heavy water-jar, and salutes you in a musical,\r\nimpudent voice, as you pass--nor is the Indian girl to be overlooked in\r\nthe novel contrasts which the \"bello sexo\" affords in this glorious land\r\nof the sun.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the pleasantest incidents related in the book are those which\r\nbefell the author in his dealings with the Indians, in prosecuting his\r\narchaeological investigations. These Indians are all passionate admirers\r\nof the United States, and of the \"hijos de Washington\"--the sons of\r\nWashington. Mr. Squier was waited upon officially by the authorities of\r\nseveral of the Indian pueblos or towns, and among them by the\r\nmunicipality of the Indian pueblo of Subtiaba, headed by a great friend\r\nof our author, Don Simon Roque, first alcalde, who presented him with an\r\naddress in the aboriginal language, of which the following is a literal\r\ntranslation:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR: The municipality of the Pueblo of Subtiaba, of which\r\n     we are members, entertain the highest enthusiasm in view of\r\n     the relations which your arrival induces us to believe will\r\n     speedily be established between Nicaragua and the United\r\n     States, the greatest and most glorious republic beneath the\r\n     sun. We rejoice in the depths of our hearts that a man like\r\n     yourself has been chosen to convey to us the assurances of\r\n     future prosperity, in the name of the sons of Washington;\r\n     and we trust in the Almighty, that the flag of the United\r\n     States may soon become the shield of Nicaragua on land and\r\n     sea. Convey our sincerest thanks for their sympathy to the\r\n     great people which you represent, and give to your generous\r\n     government the assurances of that deep gratitude which we\r\n     feel but cannot express. We beg of you, sir, to accept this\r\n     humble evidence of the cordial sentiments which we entertain\r\n     both for you, your countrymen, and your Government, and\r\n     which are equally shared by the people which we represent\r\n\r\n                 JOSE DE LA CRUZ GARCIAS,\r\n    (Signed)     SIMON ROQUE,\r\n                 FRANCISCO LUIS AUTAN.\"\r\n\r\nOur author returned the visit, and gives us the following account of his\r\nreception:\r\n\r\n     \"The reader may be assured that I did not forget my promise\r\n     to the municipality of Subtiaba. A day was shortly\r\n     afterwards fixed for my visit, and I was received with great\r\n     ceremony at the cabildo or council chamber, where I found\r\n     collected all the old men who could assist me in forming a\r\n     vocabulary of the ancient language, which I had casually\r\n     expressed a desire to procure. It was with difficulty that\r\n     we could effect an entrance, for a half-holiday had been\r\n     given to the boys of all the schools, in honor of the\r\n     occasion, and they literally swarmed around the building. We\r\n     were finally ushered into an inner room, where the archives\r\n     of the municipality were preserved. Upon one side was a\r\n     large chest of heavy wood, with massive locks, which had\r\n     anciently been the strong box or treasury. A shadow fell\r\n     over Simon's animated face as he pointed it out to me, and\r\n     said that he could remember the time when it was filled with\r\n     \"duros,\" hard dollars, and when, at a single stroke of the\r\n     alarm bell, two thousand armed men could be gathered in the\r\n     plaza of Subtiaba. But those days were passed, and the\r\n     municipality now scarcely retained a shadow of its former\r\n     greatness. Under the crown it had earned the title 'leal y\r\n     fiel' (loyal and true), and in reward of its fidelity it had\r\n     received a grant of all the lands intervening between it and\r\n     the ocean, to hold them in perpetuity for the benefit of its\r\n     citizens. And Simon showed me the royal letters, signed \"Yo,\r\n     el Rey\" (I, the King), which the imperial emperor had\r\n     thought it not derogatory to their dignity to address to his\r\n     predecessors in office, and notwithstanding his ardent\r\n     republicanism, I thought Simon looked at them with something\r\n     of regret. I inquired for manuscripts which might throw some\r\n     light upon the early history of the country, but found only\r\n     musty records of no interest or value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN HOUSE, SUBTIABA, NICARAGUA.]\r\n\r\n     \"My attempts to fill out the blank vocabulary with which I\r\n     was provided created a great deal of merriment. I enjoyed it\r\n     quite as much as any of them, for nothing could be more\r\n     amusing than the discussions between the old men in respect\r\n     to certain doubtful words and phrases. They sometimes quite\r\n     forgot my presence, and rated each other soundly as\r\n     ignoramuses, whereat Simon was greatly scandalized, and\r\n     threatened to put them all in the stocks as \"hombres sin\r\n     verguenza\" (men destitute of shame). 'Ah!' said he, 'these\r\n     old sinners give me more trouble than the young ones'--a\r\n     remark which created great mirth amongst the outsiders, and\r\n     especially amongst the young vagabonds who clung like\r\n     monkeys to the window bars. The group of swarthy, earnest\r\n     faces, gathered round the little table, upon which was\r\n     heaped a confused mass of ancient, time-stained papers,\r\n     would have furnished a study for a painter. It was quite\r\n     dark when I had concluded my inquiries, but I was not\r\n     permitted to leave without listening to a little poem, 'Una\r\n     Decima,' written by one of the school-masters, who read it\r\n     to me by the light of a huge wax candle, borrowed, I am\r\n     sure, from the church for the occasion.

Mr. Parkman, in introducing himself to\r\nthe public two or three years since, by a volume of sketches of western\r\ntravel, _The Oregon Trail_, betrayed not alone his strong natural fancy\r\nfor the wild life of the Indian, but a sensitive and sagacious eye for\r\ncharacter and scenery, and a style of nervous simplicity which in the\r\npresent undertaking have more perfect play in a much wider and worthier\r\nsphere. The narrative proceeds clearly, and with simple grace. Many\r\nfigures, familiar by name, but by name only, pass sharply defined before\r\nthe reader's eye. The author has not lost in the lore of the historian\r\nthe feeling of the poet, but he does not compromise the dignity of\r\nhistory, nor mistake its purpose, by indulging too much in luxuriance of\r\npicturesque description. We congratulate Mr. Parkman that his tastes\r\nhave led him to the exploration of a subject in which we are all so\r\ninterested, a subject whose historical romance has never been before\r\nattempted. The consultation of all the authorities, personal\r\nobservation, and the want of any unfair gilding of events or character,\r\nfix the reader's faith in the severe integrity and justice of the\r\nauthor's results. This history will materially mitigate the complaint\r\nthat American literature has so little honored the singular charm of the\r\naboriginal American race, and we cannot hesitate to predict for it a\r\nposition of authority to the student and of honor to the author, which\r\nthe works of few men so young in the literary career have attained.\r\nLittle estimate of its value, or of the value of any history, can be\r\nformed from extracts, but the following will indicate the freshness and\r\npoetic simplicity of the style, the author's exact eye for\r\ncharacteristic life and scenery, and just appreciation of historical\r\ntruth and character.\r\n\r\nHere is a glance at the life of the Iroquois:\r\n\r\n     \"The life of the Iroquois, though void of those multiplying\r\n     phases which vary the routine of civilized existence, was\r\n     one of sharp excitement and sudden contrast. The chase, the\r\n     war-path, the dance, the festival, the game of hazard, the\r\n     race of political ambition, all had their votaries. When the\r\n     assembled sachems had resolved on war against some foreign\r\n     tribe, and when, from their great council-house of bark, in\r\n     the Valley of Onondaga, their messengers had gone forth to\r\n     invite the warriors to arms, then from east to west, through\r\n     the farthest bounds of the confederacy, a thousand warlike\r\n     hearts caught up the summons with glad alacrity. With\r\n     fasting and praying, and consulting dreams and omens, with\r\n     invoking the war-god, and dancing the frantic war-dance, the\r\n     warriors sought to insure the triumph of their arms; and,\r\n     these strange rites concluded, they began their stealthy\r\n     progress, full of confidence, through the devious pathways\r\n     of the forest. For days and weeks, in anxious expectation,\r\n     the villagers await the result. And now, as evening closes,\r\n     a shrill wild cry, pealing from afar, over the darkening\r\n     forest, proclaims the return of the victorious warriors. The\r\n     village is alive with sudden commotion; and snatching sticks\r\n     and stones, knives and hatchets, men, women, and children,\r\n     yelling like fiends let loose, swarm out of the narrow\r\n     portal, to visit upon the miserable captives a foretaste of\r\n     the deadlier torments in store for them. And now, the black\r\n     arches of the forest glow with the fires of death; and with\r\n     brandished torch and firebrand the frenzied multitude close\r\n     around their victim. The pen shrinks to write, the heart\r\n     sickens to conceive, the fierceness of his agony; yet still,\r\n     amid the din of his tormentors, rises his clear voice of\r\n     scorn and defiance. The work is done; the blackened trunk is\r\n     flung to the dogs, and, with clamorous shouts and hootings,\r\n     the murderers seek to drive away the spirit of their victim.\r\n\r\n     \"The Iroquois reckoned these barbarities among their most\r\n     exquisite enjoyments; and yet they had other sources of\r\n     pleasure, which made up in frequency and in innocence all\r\n     that they lacked in intensity. Each passing season had its\r\n     feasts and dances, often mingling religion with social\r\n     pastime. The young had their frolics and merry-makings; and\r\n     the old had their no less frequent councils, where\r\n     conversation and laughter alternated with grave\r\n     deliberations for the public weal. There were also stated\r\n     periods marked by the recurrence of momentous ceremonies, in\r\n     which the whole community took part--the mystic sacrifice of\r\n     the dogs, the wild orgies of the dream feast, and the\r\n     loathsome festival of the exhumation of the dead. Yet, in\r\n     the intervals of war and hunting, these multiform\r\n     occupations would often fail; and, while the women were\r\n     toiling in the cornfields, the lazy warriors vainly sought\r\n     relief from the scanty resources of their own minds, and\r\n     beguiled the hours with smoking or sleeping, with gambling\r\n     or gallantry.\"\r\n\r\nA glimpse of Indian winter life:\r\n\r\n     \"But when winter descends upon the north, sealing up the\r\n     fountains, fettering the streams, and turning the\r\n     green-robed forests to shivering nakedness, then, bearing\r\n     their frail dwellings on their backs, the Ojibwa family\r\n     wander forth into the wilderness, cheered only, on their\r\n     dreary track, by the whistling of the north wind, and the\r\n     hungry howl of wolves. By the banks of some frozen stream,\r\n     women and children, men and dogs, lie crouched together\r\n     around the fire. They spread their benumbed fingers over the\r\n     embers, while the wind shrieks through the fir-trees like\r\n     the gale through the rigging of a frigate, and the narrow\r\n     concave of the wigwam sparkles with the frostwork of their\r\n     congealed breath. In vain they beat the magic drum, and call\r\n     upon their guardian manitoes;--the wary moose keeps aloof,\r\n     the bear lies close in his hollow tree, and famine stares\r\n     them in the face. And now the hunter can fight no more\r\n     against the nipping cold and blinding sleet. Stiff and\r\n     stark, with haggard cheek and shrivelled lip, he lies among\r\n     the snow drifts; till, with tooth and claw, the famished\r\n     wildcat strives in vain to pierce the frigid marble of his\r\n     limbs. Such grim schooling is thrown away on the\r\n     incorrigible mind of the northern Algonquin. He lives in\r\n     misery, as his fathers lived before him. Still, in the brief\r\n     hour of plenty he forgets the season of want; and still the\r\n     sleet and the snow descend upon his houseless head.\"\r\n\r\nHere another leaf from Penn's laurels:\r\n\r\n     \"It required no great benevolence to urge the Quakers to\r\n     deal kindly with their savage neighbors. They were bound in\r\n     common sense to propitiate them; since, by incurring their\r\n     resentment, they would involve themselves in the dilemma of\r\n     submitting their necks to the tomahawk, or wielding the\r\n     carnal weapon, in glaring defiance of their pacific\r\n     principles. In paying the Indians for the lands which his\r\n     colonists occupied,--a piece of justice which has been\r\n     greeted with a general clamor of applause,--Penn, as he\r\n     himself confesses, acted on the prudent counsel of Compton,\r\n     Bishop of London. Nor is there any truth in the\r\n     representations of Raynal and other eulogists of the Quaker\r\n     legislator, who hold him up to the world as the only\r\n     European who ever acquired the Indian lands by purchase,\r\n     instead of seizing them by fraud or violence. The example of\r\n     purchase had been set fifty years before by the Puritans of\r\n     New England; and several of the other colonies had more\r\n     recently pursued the same just and prudent course.\"\r\n\r\nThe deaths of Wolfe and Montcalm:\r\n\r\n     \"In the heat of the action, as he advanced at the head of\r\n     the grenadiers of Louisburg, a bullet shattered his wrist;\r\n     but he wrapped his handkerchief about the wound, and showed\r\n     no sign of pain. A moment more, and a ball pierced his side.\r\n     Still he pressed forward, waving his sword, and cheering his\r\n     soldiers to the attack, when a third shot lodged deep within\r\n     his breast. He paused, reeled, and, staggering to one side,\r\n     fell to the earth. Brown, a lieutenant of the grenadiers,\r\n     Henderson, a volunteer, an officer of artillery, and a\r\n     private soldier raised him together in their arms, and,\r\n     bearing him to the rear, laid him softly on the grass. They\r\n     asked if he would have a surgeon; but he shook his head, and\r\n     answered that all was over with him. His eyes closed with\r\n     the torpor of approaching death, and those around sustained\r\n     his fainting form. Yet they could not withhold their gaze\r\n     from the wild turmoil before them, and the charging ranks of\r\n     their companions rushing through fire and smoke.\" \"See how\r\n     they run,\" one of the officers exclaimed, as the French fled\r\n     in confusion before the levelled bayonets. \"Who run?\"\r\n     demanded Wolfe, opening his eyes like a man aroused from\r\n     sleep. \"The enemy, sir,\" was the reply; \"they give way every\r\n     where.\" \"Then,\" said the dying general, \"tell Colonel Burton\r\n     to march Webb's regiment down to Charles River, to cut off\r\n     their retreat from the bridge. Now, God be praised, I will\r\n     die in peace,\" he murmured; and, turning on his side, he\r\n     calmly breathed his last!\r\n\r\n     \"Almost at the same moment fell his great adversary,\r\n     Montcalm, as he strove, with useless bravery, to rally his\r\n     shattered ranks. Struck down with a mortal wound, he was\r\n     placed upon a litter and borne to the General Hospital on\r\n     the banks of the St. Charles. The surgeons told him that he\r\n     could not recover. \"I am glad of it,\" was his calm reply. He\r\n     then asked how long he might survive, and was told that he\r\n     had not many hours remaining. \"So much the better,\" he said;\r\n     \"I am happy that I shall not live to see the surrender of\r\n     Quebec.\" Officers from the garrison came to his bedside to\r\n     ask his orders and instructions. \"I will give no more\r\n     orders,\" replied the defeated soldier; \"I have much business\r\n     that must be attended to, of greater moment than your ruined\r\n     garrison and this wretched country. My time is very short;\r\n     therefore, pray leave me.\" The officers withdrew, and none\r\n     remained in the chamber but his confessor and the Bishop of\r\n     Quebec. To the last, he expressed his contempt for his own\r\n     mutinous and half-famished troops, and his admiration for\r\n     the disciplined valor of his opponents. He died before\r\n     midnight, and was buried at his own desire in a cavity of\r\n     the earth formed by the bursting of a bombshell.\"\r\n\r\nWe conclude with a sketch of Pontiac:\r\n\r\n     \"Pontiac, as already mentioned, was principal chief of the\r\n     Ottawas. The Ottawas, Ojibwas, and Pottawattamies, had long\r\n     been united in a loose kind of confederacy, of which he was\r\n     the virtual head. Over those around him his authority was\r\n     almost despotic, and his power extended far beyond the\r\n     limits of the three united tribes. His influence was great\r\n     among all the nations of the Illinois country; while, from\r\n     the sources of the Ohio to those of the Mississippi, and,\r\n     indeed, to the farthest boundaries of the wide-spread\r\n     Algonquin race, his name was known and respected. The fact\r\n     that Pontiac was born the son of a chief would in no degree\r\n     account for the extent of his power; for, among Indians,\r\n     many a chief's son sinks back into insignificance, while the\r\n     offspring of a common warrior may succeed to his place.\r\n     Among all the wild tribes of the continent, personal merit\r\n     is indispensable to gaining or preserving dignity. Courage,\r\n     resolution, wisdom, address and eloquence, are sure\r\n     passports to distinction. With all these Pontiac was\r\n     preeminently endowed, and it was chiefly to them, urged to\r\n     their highest activity by a vehement ambition, that he owed\r\n     his greatness. His intellect was strong and capacious. He\r\n     possessed commanding energy and force of mind, and in\r\n     subtlety and craft could match the best of his wily race.\r\n     But, though capable of acts of lofty magnanimity, he was a\r\n     thorough savage, with a wider range of intellect than those\r\n     around him, but sharing all their passions and prejudices,\r\n     their fierceness and treachery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. STARBUCK MAYO, AUTHOR OF \"KALOOLAH,\" \"THE BERBER,\" &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is any satisfaction derivable from a long and clear lineage,\r\nthe author of _Kaloolah_ ought to be a very happy man. Seven successive\r\ngenerations of reputable ancestry connect him with the Rev. John Mayo, a\r\ndivine of distinguished piety and learning who in the year 1630 came to\r\nthis country, and after settling in the town of Barnstable, transferred\r\nhis residence to Boston, and became the first pastor of the South\r\nChurch. The English pedigree of this John Mayo is one of the oldest\r\namong the gentry of Great Britain. On his mother's side Dr. Mayo also\r\ntraces his descent for several ages through the Starbucks, one of the\r\nprimitive families of that most primitive of all places, the island of\r\nNantucket.\r\n\r\nThe parents of Dr. Mayo removed to the village of Ogdensburg on the St.\r\nLawrence under the circumstances very similar to those described in\r\nKaloolah, and he was there born in the year 1812. His early intellectual\r\ntraining was under the pedagogueism of the Rev. Josiah Perry, one of the\r\nfew men formed by nature for school-masters, who has left as marked a\r\nmemory in a smaller sphere as did ever Parr or Burke in theirs. Never\r\nwas instruction better given in all the elements of a thorough English\r\neducation than for many years in his well-known school, which has\r\nproduced several of the most distinguished men of the present time. From\r\nthis the subject of our memoir was transferred, at the age of eleven or\r\ntwelve, for the purpose of pursuing classical studies, to the academy at\r\nPotsdam, which enjoyed for a number of years the superintendence in the\r\noffice of its principals of a succession of very eminent men, among them\r\nthe present Rt. Rev. Bishop of North Carolina. His successor, under whom\r\nDr. Mayo's pupilage occurred, was the Rev. Mr. Banks, a Presbyterian\r\ndivine from New England, of learning, taste, and refinement, such as\r\nwere rarely met with even in that day among men of his class.\r\n\r\nThe description of the early life of Jonathan Romer is in the main the\r\nhistory of the author himself. At the age of seventeen he commenced the\r\nstudy of medicine, which he pursued with ardor and success. In 1832,\r\nhaving attended for three years the lectures of the College of\r\nPhysicians and Surgeons in this city, he underwent his examination for a\r\ndegree, but did not receive a diploma till the ensuing term, not having\r\nattained the legal age of twenty-one. After spending several years in\r\nthe city hospitals and in private practice, he abandoned brilliant\r\nprofessional prospects to go abroad, partly for the benefit of his\r\nhealth and partly urged by the spirit of adventure, which had long led\r\nhim to form plans for the exploration of Central Africa. Perhaps it is\r\nto be regretted that he was prevented by the infirmity of\r\nshort-sightedness from emulating the achievements of Park, Clapperton\r\nand Ledyard, for which his moral and physical constitution eminently\r\nfitted him. He travelled extensively in Spain and Barbary however, and\r\nwe have the results in Kaloolah and in The Berber.\r\n\r\nAnonymously, in various magazines, Dr. Mayo had written much and well,\r\nbut he was scarcely known as an author until the appearance of the work\r\nupon which his fame still chiefly rests, _Kaloolah, or Journeyings to\r\nthe Djebel Kumri_, in the spring of 1849. It has frequently been said\r\nthat Kaloolah was suggested by the popular works of Herman Melville, but\r\nit was written and nearly printed before the appearance of Typee, the\r\nfirst of Mr. Melville's productions; and we see no reason for another\r\nopinion, that it was an offspring of the author's love for Defoe; if it\r\nwas not an altogether spontaneous and independent work, its parentage\r\nwas probably less famous; we know of no composition so nearly resembling\r\nKaloolah as the pretended _Narrative of Robert Adams, an American sailor\r\nwho was wrecked on the Western Coast of Africa, in the year 1810,\r\ndetained three years in slavery by the Arabs, and afterward several\r\nmonths a resident in the city of Timbuctoo_. This was a piece of pure\r\nfiction, though brought out in London in a splendid quarto under the\r\nendorsement of the Lord Chancellor, the President of the Royal Society,\r\nand many other eminent persons in literature, science, and affairs, and\r\nelaborately and credulously reviewed in the Edinburgh, the Quarterly,\r\nand other Reviews. The hero of this performance, after various\r\nadventures, was married to a dusky princess in the _terra incognita_,\r\nand made almost as many marvellous discoveries as are recorded by\r\nJonathan Romer. Another and a very different writer, who selected\r\ncentral Africa to be the field of somewhat similar inventions, was the\r\nlearned and ingenious Richard Adams Locke, whose astonishing history of\r\nrevelations in the moon was not more creditable to his abilities than\r\nhis singularly recovered MSS. of a lost traveller by the borders of the\r\nNiger and in middle Africa, published in the _New Era_ journal in this\r\ncity about the year 1838. But we do not suppose Dr. Mayo was indebted to\r\neither of these works for the idea of his story. And just as erroneous\r\nas the charge of plagiarism, and much more absurd, is the notion that he\r\ndesigned Kaloolah as a \"satirical criticism on life and manners in\r\nNew-York.\" A writer in the _North British Review_ declares that he\r\n\"could not help laughing aloud,\" though seated quietly by himself, at\r\nthe \"description of a musical entertainment of the court of the hero's\r\nroyal father-in-law, heaven knows where in Africa, and intended as a\r\nburlesque on the sheer noise which is the predominant element\" in all\r\nour orchestras. We assure the shrewd critic most positively that the\r\nauthor never dreamed of such a thing. Kaloolah is too well known to need\r\nmuch description; its success was certain and immediate, and not many\r\noriginal works have ever been published in this country which have had a\r\nlarger circulation. It evinces remarkable fertility of invention, is\r\nexceedingly interesting, and abounds in clearly defined, spirited, and\r\noccasionally well finished portraitures. Kaloolah, the heroine, is a\r\nfresh and beautiful creation, worthy of any of the masters of fiction.\r\nThe hero, Romer, is designed merely as a type of the determined Yankee\r\nadventurer, drawn with only the exaggeration demanded in works of art;\r\nand half the seeming of extravagance in the narrative and the sketches\r\nof nature would have disappeared if the author had not, to reduce his\r\nvolume to the size deemed by his publisher most promising of profit,\r\nomitted all his numerous and curious notes.\r\n\r\nKaloolah was followed in 1850 by _The Berber, or the Mountaineer of the\r\nAtlas_, a story of Spain and Morocco, about the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. As a novel it is decidedly better than Kaloolah; it displays\r\ngreater skill in narration, and is written in the same pure, distinct\r\nand nervous English. Dr. Mayo thoroughly understood from observation as\r\nwell as study all the accessories of his subject, and we are mistaken if\r\nany recent book on northern Africa gives a more clear, spirited or just\r\nimpression of its scenery or of the character and manners of its people.\r\nThe hero is of the highest style of the half-barbarian chiefs of the\r\ncountry and time; born a Christian, educated a Mohamedan, and ambitious\r\nto free his tribe from the domination of the Moors, and to found a new\r\nempire, with a higher civilization than was ever known to the race he\r\nleads; and other characters have enough adventures, dimly sketched, to\r\nfill the circles of a dozen tragedies if brought more near the eye. The\r\nfaults of the book are, an excess of incident, discursiveness preventing\r\nproper unity and proportion, and a confessed failure of the story to\r\nevolve all the intended moralities, which the author therefore in some\r\ncases brings forward in his own person.\r\n\r\nThe last volume we have had from the hand of Dr. Mayo is, _Romance Dust\r\nfrom the Historic Placer_, a collection of shorter stories chiefly\r\nfounded on historical incidents. In these he exhibits the fresh feeling,\r\noccasionally the humor, and always the bold drawing and effective\r\ncoloring which distinguish his more ambitious performances. The volume\r\ncontains also a poem, but not one of such striking qualities as to\r\ninduce regret that the author has commonly chosen to write in prose. The\r\nstyle of his novels, especially in the narrative parts, is uncommonly\r\ngood, but with its many excellencies it does not seem to us that it\r\npossesses a poetical element.\r\n\r\nDr. Mayo has commenced a brilliant course, in which we trust we shall\r\nhave occasions to record still greater triumphs than those by which he\r\nhas won a place in the first rank of the young writers of English.\r\n\r\nThe portrait at the beginning of this article is very truthful; it is\r\nfrom a recent daguerreotype by Brady.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CRYSTAL PALACE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Original Correspondence._\r\n\r\n     LONDON, _May 23, 1851._\r\n\r\n     Historical Sketch--Why England was the most appropriate\r\n     location for Exhibition--First impressions--Contrast between\r\n     barbaric and civilized industry--Use and beauty--Moral and\r\n     social influences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Exhibition constitutes the one absorbing topic in which, for\r\nthe time being, all other topics are merged. Go where you will, nothing\r\nelse is thought of, talked of, or heard of, from one end of London to\r\nthe other--this magnificent display of the achievements of art and\r\nindustry forms the sole theme of conversation, calling forth the most\r\nanimated descriptions, the most energetic discussions, the warmest and\r\nmost enthusiastic praise. Nor is this interest confined to London alone;\r\nthe whole kingdom shares in the excitement, and seems to be only waiting\r\nfor warmer weather, and the approaching reduction of the entrance fee,\r\nto march upon the metropolis, and satiate its curiosity within the walls\r\nof the Crystal Palace. As the season advances, and the brilliant success\r\nof the enterprise becomes known, foreign nations, who have contributed\r\nso largely to the splendor of the show, will send over hosts of friendly\r\nvisitants; and the World's Fair, so veritably cosmopolitan in design and\r\nexecution, will become equally so in its social character and results.\r\n\r\nAs the activity of the present age developes itself mainly through\r\nproductive and commercial industry, this collection of the choicest\r\nindustrial products of all the nations of the globe, is not only in\r\nperfect accordance with the spirit of the epoch, but seems indeed to\r\nbelong so properly to the present day, that it may be doubted whether\r\nsuch an event could have taken place at any earlier period: while the\r\npolitical and social conditions of Great Britain, her friendly relations\r\nwith all other powers, together with the perfect security for property,\r\nthe commercial freedom, and facilities of transport, which are here\r\nenjoyed in a pre-eminent degree, combine to indicate this country as the\r\nmost appropriate arena for this first pacific contest of the nations;\r\nthe only one, perhaps, in the actual state of Europe, in which it could\r\nhave taken place at this time.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of the English people, also, are such as would naturally\r\nsuggest to them the idea of an enterprise of this kind; for not only\r\nhave Fairs (which may be regarded as a rude attempt at a more general\r\nexhibition of wares than that afforded by the mere ordinary display of\r\nshops) been common here, as elsewhere in Europe, for many centuries, but\r\nexhibitions more nearly resembling the present Institution, in which the\r\npalm of excellence, rather than direct commerce, is the primary object,\r\nhave taken place here frequently during the past century, through the\r\nenterprise of individuals, or societies, independently of any assistance\r\nfrom the Government. As early as the year 1756, the \"Society of Arts\" of\r\nLondon offered prizes for the best specimens of various manufactures,\r\ntapestry, carpets, porcelain, &c., and held public exhibitions of the\r\nworks which were offered in competition; while about the same period,\r\nthe Royal Academy, as a private society, patronized by George the Third,\r\nrather in a personal capacity than as the head of the legislature,\r\norganized its exhibitions of painting, sculpture, and engraving; and\r\nduring the last thirty years exhibitions of machinery and manufactures,\r\ngotten up entirely through the efforts of private individuals, have\r\ntaken place not only in the metropolitan cities, in London, Edinburgh,\r\nand Dublin, but in all the principal towns of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe earliest national exhibition of industrial products in France,\r\noccurred in 1798, and was followed by others at irregular intervals\r\nuntil 1819, since which period they have taken place every five years,\r\nand have exercised a marked effect upon the industrial development of\r\nEurope. The brilliant character of the two last of these exhibitions (in\r\n'44 and '49), led to several ineffectual attempts on the part of the\r\nSociety of Arts, and others, to interest the British Government in the\r\ngetting up of a similar exhibition of the products of British industry,\r\nto be held in 1851.\r\n\r\nAt length in 1849, Prince Albert, who, as President of the Society of\r\nArts, had known and sanctioned all these proceedings, took the project\r\nunder his own personal superintendence, enlarged upon the original\r\ndesign by proposing to invite the co-operation and competition of all\r\nforeign nations, and proceeded to settle the principles upon which the\r\nenterprise, thus modified, should be conducted, and the mode in which\r\nit should be carried out.\r\n\r\nThe first steps toward the realization of this new plan, were made in\r\nthe name, and under the auspices of the Society of Arts; but so\r\nuniversal was the interest which this noble project called forth\r\nthroughout the country, that it was thought advisable to make it a\r\nnational concern, by taking it out of the hands of the Society, and\r\nintrusting its execution to a body of royal commissioners, appointed for\r\nthat purpose by the Government, with Prince Albert as its President; the\r\nGovernment, meantime, giving its sanction only to the undertaking, and\r\nmerely lending its aid when it was absolutely indispensable, as in\r\ncorrespondence with foreign countries, providing a site for the\r\nbuilding, organization of police, and the cost of such assistance\r\nwhenever it entailed expense, being defrayed from the funds of the\r\nExhibition, thus leaving all the responsibility of the attempt,\r\npecuniary or other, with the commissioners themselves.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of the \"rise and progress\" of the undertaking;\r\nthe promptitude with which the requisite funds were subscribed by\r\nprivate generosity; the selection of Hyde Park as the site of the\r\nprojected Industrial Palace; the various plans proposed for the\r\nbuilding, and the final adoption of the design of Mr. Paxton, after the\r\nmodel of a conservatory by him erected for the Duke of Devonshire; the\r\nadmirable manner in which this design has been carried out by the\r\narchitects, Messrs. Fox & Henderson; the cordial response with which\r\nEngland's friendly challenge has been answered by all the peoples of the\r\nglobe, from her next-door neighbors across the channel, to the far-off\r\ndenizens of Orient, and remote islands of sunny southern seas; the\r\nimposing ceremonial which, on the appointed day, threw open the vast\r\nMuseum to the gaze of an impatient public; the crowds of titled dames\r\nand potent seigneurs, of the \"wealth, beauty and fashion\" of the\r\naristocratic world, that fill, day after day, the immense area,\r\nwandering from one magnificent display to another, and marvelling at the\r\nrichness, perfection, and variety of the countless objects that meet\r\ntheir eyes at every turn; the probability of a somewhat formidable\r\nthronging of less elegant, but equally interested visitors, when the\r\n\"shilling days\" begin; the fabulous wealth flowing, week after week,\r\ninto the treasury of the royal commissioners at the various entrances of\r\nthe buildings; and the growing desire on the part of the public, that\r\nthe funds, thus arising from the Exhibition itself, should be\r\nappropriated to the formation of a \"Permanent Museum of the Art and\r\nIndustry of all Nations;\" all this is too well known to call for further\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nThe first impression created by the interior aspect of the Crystal\r\nPalace, is one of admiration. Magnificent indeed is the lofty dome of\r\nthe transept, arching over glorious old trees, oriental shrubbery,\r\nstatuary, fountains, and masses of gorgeous flowers; the brilliant\r\nperspective of the central aisle, with its double lines of galleries,\r\nstretching away on either hand, and traversed by countless avenues,\r\nevery point of the vast expanse presenting its own special subject of\r\ninterest, and challenging the beholder's gaze. But so extensive and\r\nvarious is this great collection, so striking are the contrasts of form,\r\ncolor, and use, presented by the endless succession of objects that meet\r\nthe eye in every direction, that the sentiment of admiration soon gives\r\nplace to a feeling of hopeless bewilderment. A careful study of maps and\r\ncatalogues, and many visits, spent in making a general survey of the\r\nvarious departments of the building, are indispensable preliminaries to\r\na more intimate acquaintance with the admirable objects contained in\r\neach. But the topographic and distributive arrangements of the building\r\nunderstood, the chaos of one's impressions becomes gradually into order;\r\nand the work of examination goes on with more success.\r\n\r\nThe transept and the western wing are occupied by Great Britain and her\r\ncolonial possessions; the eastern wing is appropriated to foreign\r\nnations, the countries lying nearest the tropics being ranged\r\nimmediately round the transept. Objects of art and artistical industry\r\noccupy the central portions of the building; raw materials, machinery,\r\nhardware, and carriages being placed nearest to the walls. The objects\r\nadmitted to the exhibition come under four general categories: raw\r\nmaterials, machinery, manufactures, and fine arts, and are divided into\r\nthirty classes, an arrangement which greatly facilitates the business of\r\ninvestigation and comparison.\r\n\r\nMany of the Oriental nations are very fully represented, especially\r\nIndia; it would be difficult to cite any department of Indian life and\r\nindustry not illustrated in the ample collections of her natural and\r\nmanufactured products, gathered together with the utmost care. China,\r\nTunis, Persia, and the islands of the Indian archipelago, are also here\r\nin great force, and make a very brilliant display. The exquisite texture\r\nof many of their woven fabrics, the richness of color and effect, the\r\nincredible _fineness_ and delicacy of workmanship displayed in many of\r\ntheir manufactured articles, prepared with the aid only of the rudest\r\ntools, often surpass all that the enlightened skill of European artisans\r\ncan accomplish, and may furnish western industry with many valuable\r\nmodels and precious suggestions for future use. But the beauty of\r\neastern productions lies solely in perfection of detail; there is\r\nnothing large, generous, or comprehensive in barbaric industry. All that\r\nits resources can accomplish is lavished on objects of parade and\r\nluxury, often absolutely useless, and always destined for the privileged\r\nfew; the element of ordinary existence, all that goes to make up the\r\ndaily life of the masses, is coarse and rudimentary. These shawls,\r\nwhich, for fineness of texture, richness of color, and beauty of design,\r\nleave the choicest productions of European looms at an immeasurable\r\ndistance; these muslins and gauzes, finer than gossamer, yet covered\r\nwith exquisite traceries in gold and silver thread, fabrics that seem\r\ntoo etherially light to be worn by others than the ladies of Titania's\r\ncourt; these silks and satins, and damasks of admirable texture, and of\r\nrichest dyes; these magnificent garments, stiff gold embroidery, with\r\nprecious stones and with tinsel whose glancing hues produce an effect\r\nquite as brilliant as that of the jewels; how strangely they contrast,\r\nthese splendid things intended for the few, with the coarseness of the\r\nfabrics destined for the ordinary use of the many. Compare these\r\nmagnificent housings and accoutrements, these saddles of velvet, stiff\r\nwith gold, these reins, and swords and daggers, full of pearls and\r\njewels, with those clumsy implements of labor, and those uncouth, heavy\r\nutensils of domestic life. Compare the elaborate workmanship of screens,\r\ncabinets, vases, lamps, and tables, with the primitive candles and\r\nsuspicious-looking soaps; the magnificence of carriages and palanquins,\r\nluxuriously cushioned, and hung with velvet and gold, in which lazy,\r\nbloated grandees are lounging, laden with jewels and finery, with the\r\nnaked, emaciated bearers, human brutes that replace beasts of burden,\r\nand contrast, unfavorably, with average European horses!\r\n\r\nIn European industry, on the contrary, an ascentional, out-reaching\r\nmovement is every where visible. Beauty remains no longer in scornful\r\nisolation, divorced from use, but descending into the domain of\r\nevery-day existence, incorporates her divine essence in all the forms of\r\ncommon life, pervading the lowliest spheres, raising and ennobling the\r\nhumblest details, by her purifying and vivifying presence. This\r\ntendency, visible in the industry of all European nations, is still more\r\nclearly evident in the manufactures of France and England, whose\r\nproductions, standing at the head of all others, constitute the highest\r\nexpression of the industrial spirit of the age. Here the hardest and\r\nheaviest materials, wood, iron, and stone, become plastic under the\r\nworkman's hand, assuming the most brilliant polish, the lightest and\r\nmost elegant forms; grates, fire-irons, and kitchen-ranges, rival, in\r\nlustre and beauty, the attractions of diamonds, goldsmiths' work, and\r\nflowers. The admirable construction of machinery shares in the\r\nenthusiasm excited by the beautiful fabrics woven by their tireless\r\nfingers; and the \"Golden Marriage\" of use and beauty is every where\r\ncelebrated under varying forms.\r\n\r\nThey who imagine that art has died out of the world, and sigh for the\r\nchisel of Praxiteles, the pencil of Apelles, and the glorious\r\nconceptions of the masters of the middles ages, would do well to visit\r\nthe Crystal Palace, and contrast the rudeness which shaped all the\r\nelements of ordinary life in former periods, with the elegance and\r\nbeauty which the simplest objects of common use are beginning to assume.\r\nNot, however, that the one necessarily precludes the other, or that we\r\nare fated to produce no more fine statues and paintings, no more\r\nmonumental temples and palaces, because we now have, at lower prices\r\nthan were paid in ancient times for inferior articles, beautiful\r\ncarpets, and fabrics of silk, wool, and cotton, furniture, porcelain,\r\nand glass, in which the thought of the artist and the craft of the\r\nartisan are so admirably blended that they seem to be identical. Art is\r\nnot dead; it is throwing out wider and deeper roots, and will bear\r\nricher fruits in the garden of the future, enriched by the mingled\r\ndetritus of by-gone ages, than it has ever borne in the primitive\r\nformations of the past.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of the present exhibition, the one\r\nwhich constitutes its distinguishing character, is, undoubtedly, its\r\nuniversality, and the interest which it excites among all nations, and\r\nall classes. And it was time that the results of human activity in its\r\nvarious departments, should thus be gathered together from the four\r\ncorners of the globe, for the world is cut up into so many small\r\nfractions, and each fraction lives so much within the limits of its own\r\nnarrow circle, ignoring, for the most part, all that is going on outside\r\nof it, that it is in the highest degree desirable that people should\r\nbegin to see something of what their neighbors are doing.\r\n\r\nIt is time that nations met elsewhere than on the field of battle, and\r\nmeasured their strength and dignity by some more rational standard than\r\nthe relative force of their cannon; time also that the various classes\r\nof society, so widely separated by the artificial divisions of caste and\r\nfortune, should look, at length, into each other's face and recognize\r\nthe band of a common nature and of common needs; that the world's, as\r\nyet, unhonored workers, beholding the glorious fruits of their prolific\r\nenergy, should perceive the sublimity of their mission and take fresh\r\nheart and fresh hope; that the rich should learn, from the grand results\r\nof labor, to appreciate more justly its nobleness and worth.\r\n\r\nThat the exhibition of 1851, successful as it is evidently destined to\r\nbe, should fully realize this most desirable end, is hardly to be\r\nexpected; but that it will do much toward creating a better\r\nunderstanding between classes and countries, and thus pave the way for\r\nthe bringing in of a future era of universal helpfulness and good-will,\r\nmay be very confidently predicted.\r\n\r\n    STELLA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH FEUILLETONISTES UPON LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leading Parisian journals have correspondents in London during the\r\nGreat Exhibition, and as the _corps_ of Parisian feuilletonistes\r\ncomprises much of the richest and rarest talent of the great French\r\nmetropolis, there is a piquancy and brilliance in these daguerreotypes\r\nof London life and the impressions of English character, which is very\r\nentertaining. No traveller who remembers dining at any of the recherche\r\ncafes upon the Boulevards with a Frenchman, and chatting with him of\r\nEngland and London, can forget the cold chill that curled through the\r\nParisian's conversation, as if he were a Pole, gossipping of Siberia, or\r\nthe glances of intense satisfaction and pride which he cast upon the\r\nlively and lovely groups in the street, inly thanking God that he was\r\nnot born a child of _perfide Albion_.\r\n\r\nBut these gentlemen talk not alone of the Exhibition, but of the \"town\"\r\nin general. Their articles wear the air of the journals of heroic\r\nadventurers who have penetrated into barbarous lands. They are clearly\r\nhome-sick, these sybarites. We extract the following from a translation\r\nin the London _Literary Gazette_, prefaced with a few editorial remarks.\r\nSpeaking of the variety of their topics the reviewer says: \"Thus the\r\ngreat Jules Janin, in the _Journal des Debats_, notwithstanding the\r\ninterest of portions of his article, some of which have been translated\r\ninto our journals, makes the infamy of French republicans, and his own\r\nfervent love and devotedness to the royal family of Orleans, the burden\r\nof his lucubrations. M. Blanqui, the historian of political economy, and\r\ntranslator of Adam Smith, faithful as becomes an economist to his _idee\r\nfixe_, bewails in the _Presse_ the folly of France in rejecting the\r\ndoctrines of free trade, and clamors loudly for an immediate reform of\r\nFrench tariffs. M. Jules de Premary fills column after column in the\r\n_Patrie_ with descriptions of English manners, customs, and\r\npeculiarities; and yet he admits that he knows nothing of our language,\r\nand has only resided amongst us for a few days. Parisian _litterateurs_\r\npride themselves on being men of imagination, poets, _penseurs\r\nfantasistes_; and it is clear that it would be as reasonable to chain an\r\neagle to a dog-cart, as to expect _them_ to deal with a plain,\r\npractical, matter-of-fact thing in the methodical business-like way of\r\nthe English journalist. Of these, the lines of Miss Fanny Fudge are\r\nstrikingly true:\r\n\r\n                          \"Vain, critics, vain\r\n    All your efforts to saddle wit's fire with a chain!!\r\n    To blot out the splendor of fancy's young stream,\r\n    Or crop in its cradle the newly-fledged beam!!!\"\r\n\r\nBut though our worthy _confreres_ of the Parisian press have thus let\r\ntheir wits go a wool-gathering, and left the poor Exhibition in the\r\nlurch, it is but just to state that one and all display on the whole a\r\nmost friendly feeling towards the English; and even in quizzing us, as\r\nmost of them do, display great good nature. They feel, perhaps, a little\r\nsore at having been outstripped by us in the establishment of the first\r\ngreat Universal Exhibition; but this was only natural, and they console\r\nthemselves by stating that it was in France that the idea was first\r\nconceived, and by solemnly promising that France will some day _prendre\r\nsa revanche_. The most amusing of the _feuilletonistes_ is\r\nunquestionably M. Jules de Premary, of the _Patrie_; and we have thought\r\nit worth while to translate a portion of his last letter, as a specimen\r\nof what an intelligent man of letters feels on visiting us for the first\r\ntime, and before he becomes well acquainted with us:\r\n\r\n     \"One of the principal causes of surprise to me in walking\r\n     along the streets of London, has been to see myself all at\r\n     once become a curious animal. I did not think that I had any\r\n     of the qualities necessary for such a thing, being neither\r\n     humpbacked nor club-footed, neither a giant nor a dwarf.\r\n     Thus, then, on the day of my arrival I went along Regent\r\n     Street, and heard the exclamations and laughter of the crowd\r\n     on seeing me, I examined myself from head to foot, to\r\n     ascertain the cause of the unhoped-for success which I\r\n     obtained in England. I even felt all up my back, thinking\r\n     that perhaps some facetious boy might have transformed me\r\n     into a walking placard. There was nothing, however; but I\r\n     had moustachios and a foreign air! A foreign air! That is\r\n     one of the little miseries on which you do not count, O\r\n     simple and inexperienced travellers!\r\n\r\n     \"At home you may have the dignity and nobleness of the\r\n     Cid--you may be another Talma: but pass the Channel--show\r\n     yourself to the English, and in spite of yourself you will\r\n     become as comic as Arnal. Arnal! do I say? why, he would not\r\n     make them laugh so much as you do; and they would consider\r\n     our inimitable comedians Levassor and Hoffmann as serious\r\n     personages. Do not be angry, then, or cry with  Alceste,--\r\n\r\n        'Par la sambleu! Messieurs, je ne croyais pas etre\r\n         Si plaisant que je suis!'\r\n\r\n     They would only laugh the more. In this respect the English\r\n     are wanting in good taste and indulgence. Their astonishment\r\n     is silly and their mockery puerile. The sight of a pair of\r\n     moustachios makes them roar with laughter, and they are in\r\n     an ecstasy of fun at the sight of a rather broad-brimmed\r\n     hat. A people must be very much bored to seize such\r\n     occasions for amusing themselves. However, all the\r\n     _travers_, like all the qualities of the English, arise from\r\n     the national spirit carried to exaggeration. They consider\r\n     themselves the _beau ideal_ of human kind. Their stiffness\r\n     of bearing, their pale faces, their hair, their whiskers cut\r\n     into the shape of mutton chops, the excessive height of\r\n     their shirt collars, and the inelegant cut of their\r\n     coats--all that makes them as proud as Trafalgar and\r\n     Waterloo.\r\n\r\n     \"In our theatres we laugh at them as they laugh at us, and\r\n     on that score we are quits. But in our great towns they are\r\n     much better and more seriously received than we Frenchmen\r\n     are in England.\r\n\r\n     \"At Paris now-a-days nobody laughs at an Englishman; but at\r\n     London every body laughs at a Frenchman. We do not make this\r\n     remark from any feeling of ill-will; in fact, we think that\r\n     to cause a smile on the thin and pinched-up lips of old\r\n     England is not a small triumph for our beards and\r\n     moustachios. After all, too, the astonishment which the\r\n     Englishman manifests at the sight of a newly disembarked\r\n     Frenchman (an astonishment which appears singular when we\r\n     call to mind the frequent communications between the two\r\n     nations), is less inexplicable than may be thought.\r\n     Geographically speaking, France and England touch each\r\n     other--morally, they are at an immeasurable distance.\r\n     Nothing is done at Calais as at Dover, nothing at London as\r\n     at Paris. There is as much difference between the two races\r\n     as between white and black. In France, the Englishman\r\n     conforms willingly to our customs, and quickly adopts our\r\n     manner of acting; but in England we are like a stain on a\r\n     harmonious picture.\r\n\r\n     \"Our fashion of sauntering along the streets, smiling at the\r\n     pretty girls we meet, looking at the shops, or stopping to\r\n     chat with a friend, fills the English with stupefaction.\r\n     They always walk straight before them like mad dogs. In\r\n     conversation there is the same difference. In England it is\r\n     always solemn. Left alone after dinner, the men adopt a\r\n     subject of conversation, which never varies during all the\r\n     rest of the evening. Each one is allowed to develop his\r\n     argument without interruption. Perhaps he is not understood,\r\n     but he is listened to. When he has ended, it becomes the\r\n     turn of another, who is heard with the same respect. The\r\n     thing resembles a quiet sitting of the Parliament. But in\r\n     France, conversation is a veritable _melee_--it is the\r\n     contrary excess. A subject is left and taken up twenty\r\n     times, amidst joyous and unforeseen interruptions. We throw\r\n     words at each other's heads without doing ourselves any\r\n     harm; smart sallies break forth, and _bon mots_ roll under\r\n     the table. In short, the Englishman reflects before\r\n     speaking; the Frenchman speaks first and reflects\r\n     afterwards--if he has time. The Frenchman converses, the\r\n     Englishman talks: and it is the same with respect to\r\n     pleasure. Place a Frenchman, who feels _ennui_, by the side\r\n     of an Englishman who amuses himself, and it will be the\r\n     former who will have the gayest air. From love, the\r\n     Englishman only demands its brutal joys; whereas the\r\n     Frenchman pays court to a woman. The Englishman, at table,\r\n     drinks to repletion; the Frenchman never exceeds\r\n     intoxication.\r\n\r\n     \"A difference equally striking exists between the females of\r\n     the two countries. I do not now speak of the beauty of the\r\n     type of the one, or the elegance and good taste of the\r\n     others; but I will notice one or two great contrasts. In\r\n     France, a young girl is reserved, is timid, and as it were\r\n     hidden under the shade of the family: but the married woman\r\n     has every liberty, and many husbands can tell you that she\r\n     does not always use it with extreme moderation! In England,\r\n     you are surprised at the confident bearing of young girls,\r\n     and the chaste reserve of married women. The former not only\r\n     willingly listen to gallant compliments, but even excite\r\n     them; whilst the latter, by the simple propriety of their\r\n     bearing, impose on the boldest.\r\n\r\n     \"The boldness of young girls in England was explained to me\r\n     by the great emigration of young men--in other words, by the\r\n     scarcity of husbands. The French girl who wants a husband is\r\n     ordinarily rather disdainful; the English girl is by no\r\n     means difficult.\r\n\r\n     \"A Frenchwoman walks negligently leaning on our arm, and we\r\n     regulate our steps by the timidity and uncertainty of hers:\r\n     the Englishwoman walks with the head erect, and takes large\r\n     strides like a soldier charging. An accident made me\r\n     acquainted with the secret of the strange way of walking\r\n     which Englishwomen have. I was lately on a visit to the\r\n     family of a merchant, whose three daughters are receiving a\r\n     costly education. The French master, the drawing master, and\r\n     the music master had each given his lesson, when I saw a\r\n     sergeant of the grenadiers of the guard arrive. He went into\r\n     the garden, and was followed by the young ladies.\r\n\r\n     \"'Ah! mon Dieu!\" I cried to the father, 'these young ladies\r\n     are surely not going to learn the military exercise!'\r\n\r\n     \"'No,' said he, with a smile.\r\n\r\n     \"'What, then, has this professor in a red coat come for?'\r\n\r\n     \"'He is the _master of grace_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"'What! that grenadier, who is as long as the column in\r\n     Trafalgar-square?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Yes, or rather he is the _walking master_.'\r\n\r\n     \"I looked out of the window, and saw the three young ladies\r\n     drawn up and immovable as soldiers, and presently they began\r\n     to march to the step of the grenadier. They formed a\r\n     charming platoon, and trod the military step with a\r\n     precision worthy of admiration. I asked for an explanation\r\n     of such a strange thing.\r\n\r\n     \"'We in England,' said my host, 'understand better the duty\r\n     of women than you Frenchmen do. We cannot regulate our\r\n     manner of walking on that of a being subjected to us. Our\r\n     dignity forbids it. It is the woman's duty to follow us.\r\n     Consequently she must walk as we do,--we can't walk as she\r\n     does.'\r\n\r\n     \"'_Ma foi!_' said I, 'I must admit that in progress you are\r\n     decidedly our masters. In France the law, it is true,\r\n     commands the wife to follow her husband; but it does not, I\r\n     confess, say that she must do so at the rate of a _quick\r\n     march_!'\r\n\r\n     \"The contrasts between the two countries are in truth\r\n     inexhaustible. Indeed I defy the most patient observer, to\r\n     find any point of resemblance between them. In France,\r\n     houses are gay in appearance; in London, with the exception\r\n     of some streets in the centre, such as Regent-street or\r\n     Oxford-street, they are as dark and dismal as prisons. Our\r\n     windows open from the left to the right; windows in England\r\n     open from top to bottom. At Paris, to ring or knock too loud\r\n     is vulgar and ill-bred; at London, if you don't execute a\r\n     tattoo with the knocker or a symphony with the bell, you are\r\n     considered a poor wretch, and are left an hour at the door.\r\n     Our hack cabs take their stand on one side of the street; in\r\n     England they occupy the middle. Our coachmen get up in front\r\n     of their vehicles; in England they go behind. In Paris,\r\n     Englishmen are charming; at home they are--Englishmen. One\r\n     thing astonishes me greatly--that the English don't walk on\r\n     their hands, since we walk on our feet.\"\r\n\r\nBut the French gentlemen do not have it all their own way. The London\r\n_Leader_ attacks them pleasantly in a similar spirit, yet it is always\r\ntinged, upon both sides, with a shade of caustic feeling: \"Jules Janin,\r\nwho has fallen in love with our fog and kindliness, announces to all\r\nFrance the joyful news that there will be no Waterloo banquet this June:\r\nthe flag of France floating over the Crystal Palace suggests to the Duke\r\nthat the banquet would be a breach of hospitality, because it would\r\nrecall such \"cruel souvenirs!\" Janin believes that report; or at least\r\nprints it, which is to give journalistic credence to it. We are sorry to\r\nthink how \"cruelly\" France will be disappointed; and we are amused at\r\nthe excessive pre-occupation of Frenchmen with this said battle of\r\nWaterloo. It is the ineradicable belief of every Frenchman that we in\r\nEngland are in a perpetual self-swagger about Waterloo. We are prodigal\r\nof the word upon omnibus, shop, street, and road, because we wish to\r\nhumble France at every corner. Waterloo-house is an insult!\r\nWaterloo-bridge a defiance! Wellington boots an outrage! Every step you\r\ntake you trample on the national pride of France, for with \"insular\r\narrogance\" you walk in boots named of Wellington or of Blucher! We are\r\nintoxicated with our success at having beaten the French--never having\r\ndrubbed them before, from the times of Cressy, Poictiers, and Agincourt,\r\ndown to the Peninsular Campaign! This one success of Waterloo--(which,\r\nafter all, was _not_ a success, as France clearly gained the battle,\r\nonly she quitted the field in disgust!)--we cannot forget; we cherish\r\nit, we riot in it; we blazon the name everywhere to flatter our national\r\npride and humiliate the foreigner. And, curious enough, the foreigner\r\n_is_ humiliated! He turns his head away as he passes Waterloo-house; he\r\ndeclines crossing Waterloo-bridge, or crosses it in a passion; and even\r\nhis national dread of rain cannot induce him to ride in a Waterloo\r\nomnibus. Of all the many profound misconceptions of English society\r\ncurrent in France, none, we venture to say, is more completely baseless\r\nthan the belief in the English feeling about Waterloo. Though it would\r\nbe impossible to persuade a Frenchman that omnibus proprietors, hotel\r\nkeepers, and builders were guilty of no national swagger in using the\r\noffending word 'Waterloo.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHALKEN THE PAINTER.--A GHOST STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe take the following from a volume of of ghost stories, with\r\nillustrations by Phiz, which has lately been published in London. One\r\nMinheer Vanderhausen, through the means of a certain persuasive\r\neloquence, backed by money, becomes the husband of Rose, the niece of\r\nGerard Douw, and with whom Schalken, the celebrated painter's pupil, was\r\nin love. Vanderhausen and his wife set out ostensibly for Rotterdam, but\r\nreceiving no communication from either for a long time, Gerard resolves\r\nupon a journey to the city. No such individual as Vanderhausen is known\r\nthere, and the fate of the poor wife is told as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"One evening, the painter and his pupil were sitting by the\r\n     fire, having accomplished a comfortable meal, and had\r\n     yielded to the silent and delicious melancholy of digestion,\r\n     when their ruminations were disturbed by a loud sound at the\r\n     street door, as if occasioned by some person rushing and\r\n     scrambling vehemently against it. A domestic had run without\r\n     delay to ascertain the cause of the disturbance, and they\r\n     heard him twice or thrice interrogate the applicant for\r\n     admission, but without eliciting any other answer but a\r\n     sustained reiteration of the sounds. They heard him then\r\n     open the hall-door, and immediately there followed a light\r\n     and rapid tread upon the staircase. Schalken advanced\r\n     towards the door. It opened before he reached it, and Rose\r\n     rushed into the room. She looked wild, fierce, and haggard\r\n     with terror and exhaustion; but her dress surprised them as\r\n     much even as her unexpected appearance. It consisted of a\r\n     kind of white woollen wrapper, made close about the neck,\r\n     and descending to the very ground. It was much deranged and\r\n     travel soiled. The poor creature had hardly entered the\r\n     chamber when she fell senseless on the floor. With some\r\n     difficulty they succeeded in reviving her; and on recovering\r\n     her senses she instantly exclaimed, in a tone of terror\r\n     rather than mere impatience, 'Wine! wine!--quickly, or I'm\r\n     lost!\"\r\n\r\n     \"Astonished, and almost scared, at the strange agitation in\r\n     which the call was made, they at once administered to her\r\n     wishes, and she drank some wine with a haste and eagerness\r\n     which surprised them. She had hardly swallowed it, when she\r\n     exclaimed, with the same urgency, 'Food, for God's sake;\r\n     food at once, or I perish!'\r\n\r\n     \"A large fragment of a roast joint was upon the table, and\r\n     Schalken immediately began to cut some; but he was\r\n     anticipated; for no sooner did she see it than she caught\r\n     it, a more than mortal image of famine, and with her hands,\r\n     and even with her teeth, she tore off the flesh, and\r\n     swallowed it. When the paroxysm of hunger had been a little\r\n     appeased, she was on a sudden overcome with shame; or it may\r\n     have been that other more agitating thoughts overpowered and\r\n     scared her, for she began to weep bitterly, and to wring her\r\n     hands.\r\n\r\n     \"'Oh! send for a minister of God!' said she; 'I am not safe\r\n     till he comes; send for him speedily.'\r\n\r\n     \"Gerard Douw dispatched a messenger instantly, and prevailed\r\n     on his niece to allow him to surrender his bedchamber to her\r\n     use. He also persuaded her to retire there at once to rest:\r\n     her consent was extorted upon the condition that they would\r\n     not leave her for a moment.\r\n\r\n     \"'Oh, that the holy man were here!' she said; 'he can\r\n     deliver me: the dead and the living can never be one; God\r\n     has forbidden it.'\r\n\r\n     \"With these mysterious words she surrendered herself to\r\n     their guidance, and they proceeded to the chamber which\r\n     Gerard Douw had assigned to her use.\r\n\r\n     \"'Do not, do not leave me for a moment!' she said; 'I am\r\n     lost for ever if you do.'\r\n\r\n     \"Gerard Douw's chamber was approached through a spacious\r\n     apartment, which they were now about to enter. He and\r\n     Schalken each carried a candle, so that a sufficiency of\r\n     light was cast upon all surrounding objects. They were now\r\n     entering the large chamber, which, as I have said,\r\n     communicated with Douw's apartment, when Rose suddenly\r\n     stopped, and, in a whisper which thrilled them both with\r\n     horror, she said, 'O God! he is here! he is here! See, see!\r\n     there he goes!'\r\n\r\n     \"She pointed towards the door of the inner room, and\r\n     Schalken thought he saw a shadowy and ill-defined form\r\n     gliding into that apartment. He drew his sword, and raising\r\n     the candle so as to throw its light with increased\r\n     distinctness upon the objects in the room, he entered the\r\n     chamber into which the shadow had glided. No figure was\r\n     there--nothing but the furniture which belonged to the room;\r\n     and yet he could not be deceived as to the fact that\r\n     something had moved before them into the chamber. A\r\n     sickening dread came upon him, and the cold perspiration\r\n     broke out in heavy drops upon his forehead; nor was he more\r\n     composed when he heard the increased urgency and agony of\r\n     entreaty with which Rose implored them not to leave her for\r\n     a moment.\r\n\r\n     \"'I saw him,' said she, 'he's here. I cannot be deceived; I\r\n     know him; he's by me; he is with me; he's in the room. Then,\r\n     for God's sake, as you would save me, do not stir from\r\n     beside me.'\r\n\r\n     \"They at length prevailed upon her to lie down upon the bed,\r\n     where she continued to urge them to stay by her. She\r\n     frequently uttered incoherent sentences, repeating again and\r\n     again, 'The dead and the living cannot be one; God has\r\n     forbidden it:' and then again, 'Rest to the wakeful--sleep\r\n     to the sleep-walkers.' These and such mysterious and broken\r\n     sentences she continued to utter until the clergyman\r\n     arrived. Gerard Douw began to fear, naturally enough, that\r\n     terror or ill-treatment had unsettled the poor girl's\r\n     intellect; and he half suspected, from the suddenness of her\r\n     appearance, the unseasonableness of the hour, and, above\r\n     all, from the wildness and terror of her manner, that she\r\n     had made her escape from some place of confinement for\r\n     lunatics, and was in imminent fear of pursuit. He resolved\r\n     to summon medical advice as soon as the mind of his niece\r\n     had been in some measure set at rest by the offices of the\r\n     clergyman whose attendance she had so earnestly desired; and\r\n     until this object had been attained, he did not venture to\r\n     put any questions to her which might possibly, by reviving\r\n     painful or horrible recollections, increase her agitation.\r\n     The clergyman soon arrived; a man of ascetic countenance and\r\n     venerable age--one whom Gerard Douw respected much,\r\n     forasmuch as he was a veteran polemic, though one perhaps\r\n     more dreaded as a combatant, than beloved as a Christian--of\r\n     pure morality, subtile brain, and frozen heart. He entered\r\n     the chamber which communicated with that in which Rose\r\n     reclined; and immediately on his arrival she requested him\r\n     to pray for her, as for one who lay in the hands of Satan,\r\n     and who could hope for deliverance only from heaven.\r\n\r\n     \"That you may distinctly understand all the circumstances of\r\n     the event which I am going to describe, it is necessary to\r\n     state the relative position of the parties who were engaged\r\n     in it. The old clergyman and Schalken were in the anteroom\r\n     of which I have already spoken; Rose lay in the inner\r\n     chamber, the door of which was open; and by the side of the\r\n     bed, at her urgent desire, stood her guardian; a candle\r\n     burned in the bedchamber, and three were lighted in the\r\n     outer apartment. The old man now cleared his voice, as if\r\n     about to commence; but before he had time to begin, a sudden\r\n     gust of air blew out the candle which served to illuminate\r\n     the room in which the poor girl lay, and she with hurried\r\n     alarm exclaimed, 'Godfrey, bring in another candle; the\r\n     darkness is unsafe.'\r\n\r\n     \"Gerard Douw, forgetting for the moment her repeated\r\n     injunctions, in the immediate impulse, stepped from the\r\n     bedchamber into the other, in order to supply what she\r\n     desired.\r\n\r\n     \"'O God! do not go dear uncle,' shrieked the unhappy girl;\r\n     and at the same time she sprang from the bed and darted\r\n     after him, in order by her grasp to detain him. But the\r\n     warning came too late; for scarcely had he passed the\r\n     threshold, and hardly had his niece had time to utter the\r\n     startling exclamation, when the door which divided the two\r\n     rooms closed violently after him, as if swung to by a strong\r\n     blast of wind. Schalken and he both rushed to the door, but\r\n     their united and desperate efforts could not avail so much\r\n     as to shake it. Shriek after shriek burst from the inner\r\n     chamber, with all the piercing loudness of despairing\r\n     terror. Schalken and Douw strained every nerve to force open\r\n     the door; but all in vain. There was no sound of struggling\r\n     from within, but the screams seemed to increase in loudness,\r\n     and at the same time they heard the bolts of the latticed\r\n     window withdrawn, and the window itself grated upon the sill\r\n     as if thrown open. One _last_ shriek, so long, and piercing,\r\n     and agonized, as to be scarcely human, swelled from the\r\n     room, and suddenly there followed a death-like silence. A\r\n     light step was heard crossing the floor, as if from the bed\r\n     to the window, and almost at the same instant the door gave\r\n     way, and yielding to the pressure of the external\r\n     applicants, they were nearly precipitated into the room. It\r\n     was empty. The window was open, and Schalken sprang to a\r\n     chair, and gazed out upon the street and canal below. There\r\n     was no one there; but he saw, or thought he saw, the waters\r\n     of the broad canal beneath settling ring after ring, in\r\n     heavy circles, as if a moment before disturbed by the\r\n     submersion of some ponderous body.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF LIFE IN SWEDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHans Christian Anderson, the Danish poet and story-teller, whose\r\n_Improvisatore_ is one of the most beautiful and intrinsically truthful\r\nof the myriad beautiful books upon Italian life, has published a new\r\nwork, _Pictures of Sweden_. It is very genial summer reading, consisting\r\nof detached sketches of Swedish life and scenery, with interludes of\r\npoetic reverie. The London journals complain that it is not sufficiently\r\nwell translated, but we quote the following characteristic passages in\r\nwhich the same weird child-likeness of feeling which his readers will\r\nrecall, is expressed in the peculiar, subdued strain of northern\r\nsentimentalism, which is more the complexion, than the substance of his\r\nstyle. Here is the prelude to the book:\r\n\r\n     \"It is a delightful spring: the birds warble, but you do not\r\n     understand their song! Well, hear it in a free translation.\r\n\r\n     \"'Get on my back,' says the stork, our green island's sacred\r\n     bird, 'and I will carry thee over the Sound. Sweden also has\r\n     fresh and fragrant beech woods, green meadows and\r\n     cornfields. In Scania, with the flowering apple-trees behind\r\n     the peasant's house, you will think that you are still in\r\n     Denmark.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Fly with me,' says the swallow; 'I fly over Holland's\r\n     mountain ridge, where the beech-trees cease to grow; I fly\r\n     further towards the north than the stork. You shall see the\r\n     vegetable mould pass over into rocky ground; see snug, neat\r\n     towns, old churches and mansions, where all is good and\r\n     comfortable, where the family stand in a circle around the\r\n     table and say grace at meals, where the least of the\r\n     children says a prayer, and, morning and evening, sings a\r\n     psalm. I have heard it, I have seen it, when little, from my\r\n     nest under the eaves.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Come with me! come with me!' screams the restless\r\n     sea-gull, and flies in an expecting circle. 'Come with me to\r\n     the Skjaergaards, where rocky isles by thousands, with fir\r\n     and pine, lie like flower beds along the coast; where the\r\n     fishermen draw the well-filled nets!'\r\n\r\n     \"'Rest thee between our extended wings,' sing the wild\r\n     swans. 'Let us bear thee up to the great lakes, the\r\n     perpetually roaring elves (rivers), that rush on with arrowy\r\n     swiftness; where the oak forest has long ceased, and the\r\n     birch-tree becomes stunted. Rest thee between our extended\r\n     wings: we fly up to Sulitelma, the island's eye, as the\r\n     mountain is called; we fly from the vernal green valley, up\r\n     over the snow-drifts, to the mountain's top, whence thou\r\n     canst see the North Sea, on yonder side of Norway.\r\n\r\n     \"'We fly to Jemteland, where the rocky mountains are high\r\n     and blue; where the Foss roars and rushes; where the torches\r\n     are lighted as _budstikke,_ to announce that the ferryman is\r\n     expected. Up to the deep, cold-running waters, where the\r\n     midsummer sun does not set; where the rosy hue of eve is\r\n     that of morn.\"\r\n\r\nStockholm is thus pictured, with an allusion, at the close, to a\r\nbuilding dear to us all, now--as that which was first enriched by the\r\nvoice, whose recent lapse into silence has made our hearts heavy:\r\n\r\n     \"It is but the work of one night; the same night when Oluf\r\n     Hakonson, with iron and with fire, burst his onward way\r\n     through the stubborn ground; before the day breaks the\r\n     waters of the Maelar roll there; the Norwegian prince, Oluf,\r\n     sailed through the royal channel he had cut in the east. The\r\n     stockades, where the iron chains hang, must bear the\r\n     defences; the citizens from the burnt-down Sigtuna erect\r\n     themselves a bulwark here, and build their new little town\r\n     on stock-holms.[A] The clouds go, and the years go! Do you\r\n     see how the gables grow? there rise towers and forts. Birger\r\n     Jarl makes the town of Stockholm a fortress; the warders\r\n     stand with bow and arrow on the walls, reconnoitring over\r\n     lake and fiord, over Brunkaberg sand-ridge. There where the\r\n     sand slopes upwards from Roerstrand's Lake they build Clara\r\n     cloister, and between it and the town a street springs up:\r\n     several more appear; they form an extensive city, which soon\r\n     becomes the place of contest for different partisans, where\r\n     Ladelaas's sons plant the banner, and where the German\r\n     Albrecht's retainers burn the Swedes alive within its walls.\r\n     Stockholm is, however, the heart of the kingdom: that the\r\n     Danes know well; that the Swedes know too, and there is\r\n     strife and bloody combating. Blood flows by the\r\n     executioner's hand, Denmark's Christian the Second, Sweden's\r\n     executioner, stands in the market-place. Roll, ye runes! see\r\n     over Brunkaberg sand-ridge, where the Swedish people\r\n     conquered the Danish host, there they raise the May-pole: it\r\n     is midsummer-eve--Gustavus Vasa makes his entry into\r\n     Stockholm. Around the May-pole there grow fruit and\r\n     kitchen-gardens, houses and streets; they vanish in flames,\r\n     they rise again; that gloomy fortress towards the tower is\r\n     transformed into a palace, and the city stands magnificently\r\n     with towers and draw-bridges. There grows a town by itself\r\n     on the sand-ridge, a third springs up on the rock towards\r\n     the south; the old walls fall at Gustavus Adolphus's\r\n     command; the three towns are one, large and extensive,\r\n     picturesquely varied with old stone houses, wooden shops,\r\n     and grass-roofed huts; the sun shines on the brass balls of\r\n     the towers, and a forest of masts stands in that secure\r\n     harbor. * * *\r\n\r\n     \"It is a very little semicircular island, on which the\r\n     arches of the bridge rest: a garden full of flowers and\r\n     trees, which we overlook from the high parapet of the\r\n     bridge. Ladies and gentlemen promenade there; musicians\r\n     play, families sit there in groups, and take refreshments in\r\n     the vaulted halls under the bridge, and look out between the\r\n     green trees over the open water, to the houses and mansions,\r\n     and also to the woods and rocks: we forget that we are in\r\n     the midst of the city. It is the bridge here that unites\r\n     Stockholm with Nordmalen, where the greatest part of the\r\n     fashionable world live, in two long Berlin-like streets; yet\r\n     amongst all the great houses we will only visit one, and\r\n     that is the theatre. We will go on the stage itself--it has\r\n     an historical signification. Here by the third side-scene\r\n     from the stage-lights, to the right, as we look down towards\r\n     the audience, Gustavus the Third was assassinated at a\r\n     masquerade; and he was borne into that little chamber there,\r\n     close by the scene, whilst all the outlets were closed, and\r\n     the motley group of harlequins, polichinellos, wild men,\r\n     gods and goddesses, with unmasked faces, pale and terrified,\r\n     crept together; the dancing ballet-farce had become a real\r\n     tragedy. This theatre is Jenny Lind's childhood's home. Here\r\n     she has sung in the choruses when a little girl; here she\r\n     first made her appearance in public, and was cheeringly\r\n     encouraged when a child; here, poor and sorrowful, she has\r\n     shed tears, when her voice left her, and sent up pious\r\n     prayers to her Maker. From hence the world's nightingale\r\n     flew out over distant lands, and proclaimed the purity and\r\n     holiness of art.\"\r\n\r\nWe ramble a moment in the garden of Linnaeus, and contemplate his\r\nmonument. It is withered and wasted now; it appears not unlike that\r\ngrave garden of Ferney, with the close bower in which Voltaire used to\r\nwalk and meditate:\r\n\r\n     \"The walls shine brightly, and with varied hues, in the\r\n     great chapel behind the high altar. The fresco paintings\r\n     present to us the most eventful circumstances of Gustavus\r\n     Vasa's life. Here his clay moulders, with that of his three\r\n     consorts. Yonder, a work in marble, by Sargel, solicits our\r\n     attention: it adorns the burial-chapel of the De Geers; and\r\n     here, in the centre aisle, under that flat stone, rests\r\n     Linnaeus. In the side chapel, is his monument, erected by\r\n     _amici_ and _discipuli_; a sufficient sum was quickly raised\r\n     for its erection, and the King, Gustavus the Third, himself\r\n     brought his royal gift. The projector of the subscription\r\n     then explained to him, that the purposed inscription was,\r\n     that the monument was erected only by friends and disciples,\r\n     and King Gustavus answered: 'And am not I also one of\r\n     Linnaeus's disciples?' The monument was raised, and a hall\r\n     built in the botanical garden, under splendid trees. There\r\n     stands his bust; but the remembrance of himself, his home,\r\n     his own little garden--where is it most vivid? Lead us\r\n     thither. On yonder side of Fyri's rivulet, where the street\r\n     forms a declivity, where red-painted wooden houses boast\r\n     their living grass roofs, as fresh as if they were planted\r\n     terraces, lies Linnaeus's garden. We stand within it. How\r\n     solitary! how overgrown! Tall nettles shoot up between the\r\n     old, untrimmed, rank hedges. No water-plants appear more in\r\n     that little dried-up basin; the hedges that were formerly\r\n     clipped, put forth fresh leaves without being checked by the\r\n     gardener's shears. It was between these hedges that Linnaeus\r\n     at times saw his own double--that optical illusion which\r\n     presents the express image of a second self--from the hat to\r\n     the boots. Where a great man has lived and worked, the place\r\n     itself becomes, as it were, a part and parcel of him: the\r\n     whole, as well as a part, has mirrored itself in his eye; it\r\n     has entered into his soul, and becomes linked with it and\r\n     the whole world. We enter the orangeries: they are now\r\n     transformed into assembly-rooms; the blooming winter-garden\r\n     has disappeared; but the walls yet show a sort of herbarium.\r\n     They are hung round with the portraits of learned Swedes--a\r\n     herbarium from the garden of science and knowledge. Unknown\r\n     faces--and, to the stranger, the greatest part are unknown\r\n     names--meet us here.\"\r\n\r\nA palace of Gustavus Vasa's:\r\n\r\n     \"There yet stands a stone outline of Vadstene's rich palace\r\n     which he (Gustavus Vasa) erected, with towers and spires,\r\n     close by the cloister. At a far distance on the Vettern, it\r\n     looks as if it still stood in all its splendor; near, in\r\n     moonlight nights, it appears the same unchanged edifice, for\r\n     the fathom-thick walls yet remain; the carvings over the\r\n     windows and gates stand forth in light and shade, and the\r\n     moat round about, which is only separated from the Vettern\r\n     by the narrow carriage road, takes the reflection of the\r\n     immense building as a mirrored image.\r\n\r\n     \"We now stand before it in daylight. Not a pane of glass is\r\n     to be found in it; planks and old doors are nailed fast to\r\n     the window frames; the balls alone still stand on the two\r\n     towers, broad, heavy, and resembling colossal toadstools.\r\n     The iron spire of the one still towers aloft in the air; the\r\n     other spire is bent: like the hands on a sundial it shows\r\n     the time--the time that is gone. The other two balls are\r\n     half fallen down; lambs frisk about between the beams, and\r\n     the space below is used as a cow-stall.\r\n\r\n     \"The arms over the gateway have neither spot nor blemish:\r\n     they seem as if carved yesterday; the walls are firm, and\r\n     the stairs look like new. In the palace yard, far above the\r\n     gateway, the great folding door was opened, whence once the\r\n     minstrels stepped out and played a welcome greeting from the\r\n     balcony, but even this is broken down: we go through the\r\n     spacious kitchen, from whose white walls, a sketch of\r\n     Vadstene palace, ships, and flowering trees, in red chalk,\r\n     still attract the eye.\r\n\r\n     \"Here where they cooked and roasted, is now a large empty\r\n     space; even the chimney is gone; and from the ceiling where\r\n     thick, heavy beams of timber have been placed close to one\r\n     another, there hangs the dust-covered cobweb, as if the\r\n     whole were a mass of dark gray dropping stones.\r\n\r\n     \"We walk from hall to hall, and the wooden shutters are\r\n     opened to admit daylight. All is vast, lofty, spacious, and\r\n     adorned with antique chimney-pieces, and from every window\r\n     there is a charming prospect over the clear, deep Vettern.\r\n     In one of the chambers in the ground floor sat the insane\r\n     Duke Magnus (whose stone image we lately saw conspicuous in\r\n     the church), horrified at having signed his own brother's\r\n     death-warrant; dreamingly in love with the portrait of\r\n     Scotland's Queen, Mary Stuart; paying court to her and\r\n     expecting to see the ship, with her, glide over the sea\r\n     towards Vadstene. And she came--he thought she came--in the\r\n     form of a mermaid, raising herself aloft on the water: she\r\n     nodded and called to him, and the unfortunate Duke sprang\r\n     out of the window down to her. We gazed out of this window,\r\n     and below it we saw the deep moat in which he sank.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] \"Stock, signifies bulks, or beams; holms, _i.e._ islets, or river\r\nislands; hence, Stockholm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FRENCHMAN'S OPINIONS OF AMERICAN FEMALE POETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find in the Paris _Revue des Deux Mondes_, for May 15, an article,\r\nwhich we translate for _The International_, on \"The Female Poets of\r\nAmerica,\"[B] by M. E. MONTEGUT. This writer's opinions respecting the\r\ninfluence of Protestantism on the cultivation of poetry may amuse those\r\nwho remember who have been the greatest poets. It is a part of the cant\r\nof criticism to point to mediaeval art as a fruit of the Roman Catholic\r\nascendency--as if the Roman Catholics had done more than the Protestants\r\nfor high art since the Reformation. But M. Montegut is a man of wit, and\r\nhis criticism, though we confess that it loses some of its point in our\r\nversion, will entertain the hundred of our countrywomen who make verses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is an opinion very generally entertained that the Americans are\r\nalmost exclusively occupied with material affairs, with commerce, and\r\nthe varied forms of mechanical industry. The volume of Mr. Griswold will\r\ncontribute to dispel any such idea, for in its four hundred pages,\r\nnearly of the size of quartos, there are quoted ninety of the most\r\ncelebrated female poets of North America: ninety female poets! and all,\r\nwith few exceptions, contemporary. Why, all Europe could not count a\r\ngreater number. If therefore, we bear in mind that this voluminous\r\npoetic _flore_ contains only the names of women, and that Mr. Rufus\r\nGriswold has consecrated two volumes of similar dimensions, one to the\r\nPoets of the masculine gender, and the other to the Prose-Writers of\r\nboth genders, it is difficult to believe in the literary sterility of\r\nthe United States. But why is it, that among these three or four hundred\r\nwriters, only three or four are known beyond the Atlantic? It is, that a\r\nliterature is not altogether composed of harmonious reveries, of elegant\r\nimitations, of agreeable fancies; that poetry does not consist in a\r\nmelodious rhythm only, nor even in a tasteful choice of words, nor in a\r\nperfect knowledge of language. Poetry, as well as all the possible\r\nexpressions of thought and genius, arises from the very depths of the\r\nsoul. It is the exterior expression of the national life, the\r\nrecital,--from the lips of an individual animated and transported with\r\nthe popular spirit--of the mysteries of his country's existence, and the\r\ndesires, aspirations and convictions of his countrymen. The poet is the\r\ninterpreter of the moral character of his country to other nations, and\r\nhis works are the highest embodiment of the manners and habits of life\r\nin his country and his time. The poetry which does not fulfil these\r\nconditions is not poetry. Any man writing verse, who does not feel\r\nhimself agitated in a more lively and distinct manner with the desires\r\nwhich torment his contemporaries as a vague fever, who does not know\r\nthat his whole mission is to express, in an artistic and harmonious\r\nform, the clamors and the incorrect utterance of these desires, is not\r\nand cannot be a poet.\r\n\r\nIf such be the moral necessities which give birth to poetry, how is it\r\nthat America has not an original literature? How is it that she has no\r\ngreat artists, and that there are but three or four writers--Cooper,\r\nChanning, Emerson--who well express her spirit and tendencies? None of\r\nthe great moral qualities necessary to a poet are wanting to Americans.\r\nThey have a national pride, approaching even to sensitiveness; they have\r\nfirm and free religious faiths; life is energetic and manifests itself\r\nabundantly every where. How is it, we ask, that we meet no man of genius\r\nto tell us of the miracles of triumph over nature and barbarism; of\r\nthose hardy industrial enterprises, and those wonderful displays of\r\nhuman activity around them; to sing the adventurous heroes of commerce\r\nand mechanism, and that singular marriage in domestic life of sedentary\r\nvirtues with a changing, nomadic disposition--the love of the fireside,\r\nwhich remains undisturbed in the midst of perpetual displacement, as of\r\nold the tents of the patriarchs were pitched in the evening and stricken\r\nin the morning? Is it that there is no poetry in these subjects? Here,\r\nindeed, is a curious phenomenon, and one of the least-studied laws of\r\nliterary history.\r\n\r\nBut ought we to regard Americans unfortunate because they have no\r\nliterature of their own? In some points of view it is a reason for\r\nenvying them. When true poetry appears among a people, it is not always\r\na prophetic sign of future greatness; it is oftener a reflection of\r\ngreatness passed away. It announces not new destinies, but recounts a\r\nhistory of the vanished and vanishing. Whenever the voice of a great\r\npoet is heard, we are sure that the customs, the institutions, and the\r\nreligions he sings, are near their decline. Thus, Shakspeare, the most\r\nfaithful mirror of the middle and feudal ages, came with reform and the\r\nsixteenth century; and Calderon, with the decay of Spanish Catholicism.\r\nThat opinions and manners should partake of poesy, it is necessary that\r\nthey begin to fade away into the realm of the fabulous past; it is\r\nnecessary, in order that the ideal should appear, that these cease to\r\nexist. It was formerly said, and not without reason, \"Happy the people\r\nwho have no literature!\" and in our time we are tempted to say: Happy\r\nthe people who have no great poets! it is a proof that they enjoy the\r\nplentitude of life, that they have nothing to regret, that they are\r\nstill in all their primal innocency, and the native energy of their\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nIt is curious, also, to observe, how men animated by an heroic faith,\r\nseldom see that that faith and the deeds which it inspires, belong to\r\nthe poetic and ideal. The first Puritans, who embarked, without\r\nresources, in a frail vessel, to seek in America the enjoyment of a free\r\nreligion, now appear to us truly poetical. Walter Scott has drawn a\r\nthousand original characters of cavaliers and round-heads. Do you know\r\nwhat was the literature of those men full of the spirit of the Bible? Do\r\nyou know what was the character of the first poetic publications in the\r\nUnited States? We open Mr. Griswold's volume, and the first name is that\r\nof Anne Bradstreet, who proceeded thither with her father, an ardent\r\nnonconformist. Here is the title under which her poems were printed, in\r\nthe year 1640, at Boston: \"_Several Poems, compiled with great variety\r\nof Wit and Learning, full of delight; wherein especially is contained a\r\ncompleat Discourse and Description of the Four Elements, Constitutions,\r\nAges of Man, and Seasons of the Year, together with an exact Epitome of\r\nthe Three First Monarchies, viz. the Assyrian, Persian, and Grecian; and\r\nthe beginning of the Roman Commonwealth to the end of their last King;\r\nwith divers other Pleasant and Serious Poems: By a Gentlewoman of New\r\nEngland._\" This Mrs. Bradstreet, called by the Americans, at this epoch,\r\nthe \"tenth muse\"--probably a very good Protestant--made invocations to\r\nPhoebus, and imitated ---- Dubartas! Certainly, the emigrant\r\nAmericans, who were indeed the most zealous of all Protestants, did not\r\nsuspect the mournful poetry which Protestantism contains--a poetry which\r\nwe perceive to-day. It is even a part of the American life of our times.\r\nBut this absence of real poetry is far from being a bad sign; it is, on\r\nthe contrary, a proof of strength and energy.\r\n\r\nGreat works are not what we require of Americans; we would rather\r\nendeavor to discover in them the traces of the moral spirit of their\r\ncountry, its philosophical and historic signs, rather than poetic fables\r\nskilfully constructed and eloquently told. For example, these female\r\npoets of North America, suggest an interesting question for Europeans to\r\nexamine. Have all those Misses and Mistresses who write poems, dramas\r\nand sonnets, any features of resemblance with our female authors? Has\r\nAmerica, which is represented so coarse in manners, inherited the vices\r\nof European society, and become so degenerate as to give birth to that\r\nmonstrous nondescript, named among us a _bas-bleu_? We have endeavored,\r\ndiligently, to discover, in this large volume, traces of resemblance\r\nbetween our women of letters and the female poets of America, but we\r\nhave discovered none. These daughters and wives of American citizens, of\r\nmerchants, bankers, magistrates and doctors in theology, do not write as\r\nour female authors, from vain ambition, or love, or scandal, or (what\r\namong us is by no means uncommon) to repent of the scandal that they\r\nhave occasioned. They write as among us young girls draw or sing. Poesy\r\nis for them an ornamental art, and nothing more. Besides, this great\r\nnumber of female poets in America, is explained by the much more liberal\r\neducation received by the women of English blood and of the Protestant\r\nreligion. We can find better specimens of poetry, certainly, but nothing\r\nequalling them in the discretion and reserve that reign in all their\r\nverses. We have sought, diligently, to discover the sentiments which\r\nAmerican women are most pleased in translating into written poetry: one\r\nonly is expressed, freely and energetically--maternal love. The other\r\nsentiments and virtues are carefully veiled, as subjects upon which it\r\nwould be improper to dwell. Such verses are full of scruples and\r\ndelicacies, and to us, it is their principal charm. Love, so difficult\r\nfor the female heart to acknowledge in words; passionate confidences, so\r\neasily turned into sarcasms, and almost repulsive when uttered by the\r\nmouth of a woman, find no place in the inspirations of the American\r\npoetess. There are no strongly expressed individual passions. Vague and\r\nobjectless longings--the cold lights of mere fancy, are the\r\ncharacteristics of those writers. Sometimes we discover a regret, or a\r\nmournful remembrance, but so obscure as to be nearly lost in a vastly\r\ndiffused hope of some good which is not realized. We have endeavored to\r\ndiscover if the sentiment of conjugal love were there, but we are\r\ndisappointed. To us, Europeans, who are overwhelmed with romances, in\r\nwhich this chaste sentiment is analyzed and written of in a manner to\r\nproduce absolute nausea, it is not, perhaps, known how much discretion\r\nthere is in this passionless exterior, and how commendable it is that so\r\nholy a sentiment should not pass the sacred inclosures of the female\r\nheart; that it should not wound the delicacies of its own natural\r\nreserve and silence. The talents of these writers are exercised upon\r\npermitted subjects, and not, as too often among our own female poets,\r\nupon subjects at once easy and unlawful.\r\n\r\nThis modesty and reserve throughout the work become necessarily\r\nmonotonous--but it is of no great consequence to us. We would not have\r\nwritten if it had not been to acknowledge specimens of real literary\r\nexcellence. But we have in the work itself what is of considerable value\r\nas reflecting in some degree the American character. We can use these\r\nelegies, reveries and monodies as a means of discovering the nature of\r\nthe virtues thus brought out from obscurity, though in coloring too pale\r\nand uniform. The life of these women possesses nothing adventurous,\r\npassionate, or eccentric. It is composed of three facts: birth,\r\nmarriage, and death. As to the intervals between these three solemn\r\nevents, the biographer says little, and we suppose they are filled with\r\nexemplary virtues and the accomplishment of duties which human and\r\ndivine law imposes upon the woman. Three of these, however, are\r\ndistinguished from the others by their position in society, or by their\r\ntalents, and constitute the only singularities of the work.\r\n\r\nWe have just remarked, that these _poesies_ are all written by the\r\ndaughters of rich merchants, lawyers, and doctors of divinity; two,\r\nhowever, are of low condition--a negress, Philis Wheatley Peters; and a\r\ndomestic, Maria James. The negress belonged to the close of the\r\neighteenth century, and was born at a time to justify the pamphlets of\r\nFranklin on slavery, and the demands of philanthropy. This \"daughter of\r\nthe murky Senegal,\" as one of her critics called her, has been, thanks\r\nto the circumstances of her color, birth, and condition, a sort of\r\nhistoric character. Sold at ten years of age, in a public mart of\r\nslaves, she was purchased by Mrs. Wheatley, a lady who educated her, and\r\nwho afterwards permitted her to be called by her own name. This negress,\r\nso little known now, has had her day in history; she visited London,\r\nwhere she was an object of general esteem. Washington corresponded with\r\nher, and the Abbe Gregoire, our revolutionary regicide, announced her a\r\ngreat poet, in his Essay upon the Intellectual and Moral Faculties of\r\nthe Negro. The opponents of slavery applauded her verses with\r\nenthusiasm, and the upholders of slavery denounced and slandered her.\r\nShe has been, for a moment, in the eyes of the universe, the noblest\r\ntype of her race--this humble black slave has been, in the civilized\r\nworld, the representative of all her brethren. Her existence has been\r\none of the incidents of universal history, and this unknown person has\r\nhad her share, however small, in the revolutions of the world.\r\n\r\nMaria James was a poor servant, the child of an emigrant from Wales. An\r\nunlettered poet, she drew her only instruction from the Bible, the\r\nPilgrim's Progress, and Miss Hannah More, a kind of Madame de Genlis of\r\npuritanism; and yet it was this poor girl who wrote the most perfect\r\nlyric, the neatest, and in a literary view, the best composed, that we\r\nfind in the collection; the lyrical pieces, by the way, are not\r\ngenerally well written. The thoughts are indefinite, the images\r\nconfounded, and in some way run in upon each other. The principal\r\nsentiment is seldom neatly distinguished. These lyrics are as the\r\nbuzzing of bees, or rather as honey scarcely formed, of which each drop\r\ncontains the perfume of the flower whence it was extracted. Here is a\r\npiece by Maria James, which we do not give as her best, but which\r\noverflows with a profound religious feeling, and turns the heart of the\r\nreader, for a moment, to the haven of eternal repose:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PILGRIMS: TO A LADY.\r\n\r\n      We met as pilgrims meet,\r\n        Who are bound to a distant shrine,\r\n      Who spend the hours in converse sweet\r\n      From noon to the day's decline--\r\n    Soul mingling with soul, as they tell of their fears\r\n    And their hopes, as they passed through the valley of tears.\r\n\r\n      And still they commune with delight,\r\n        Of pleasures or toils by the way,\r\n      The winds of the desert that chill them by night,\r\n        Or heat that oppresses by day:\r\n    For one to the faithful is ever at hand,\r\n    As the shade of a rock in a weary land.\r\n\r\n      We met as soldiers meet,\r\n        Ere yet the fight is won--\r\n      Ere joyful at their captain's feet\r\n        Is laid their armor down:\r\n    Each strengthens his fellow to do and to bear,\r\n    In hope of the crown which the victors wear.\r\n\r\n      Though daily the strife they renew,\r\n        And their foe his thousands o'ercome,\r\n      Yet the promise unfailing is ever in view\r\n        Of safety, protection, and home:\r\n    Where they knew that their sov'reign such favor conferred,\r\n    \"As eye hath not seen, as the ear hath not heard.\"\r\n\r\n      We met as seamen meet,\r\n        On ocean's watery plain,\r\n      Where billows rise and tempests beat,\r\n        Ere the destined port they gain:\r\n    But tempests they baffle, and billows they brave,\r\n    Assured that their pilot is mighty to save.\r\n\r\n      They dwell on the scenes which have past,\r\n        Of perils they still may endure--\r\n      The haven of rest, where they anchor at last,\r\n        Where bliss is complete and secure--\r\n    Till its towers and spires arise from afar,\r\n    To the eye of faith as some radiant star.\r\n\r\n      We met as brethren meet,\r\n        Who are cast on a foreign strand,\r\n      Whose hearts are cheered as they hasten to greet\r\n        And commune of their native land--\r\n    Of their father's house in that world above,\r\n    Of his tender care and his boundless love.\r\n\r\n      The city so fair to behold,\r\n        The redeemed in their vestments of white--\r\n      In those mansions of rest, where, mid pleasures untold,\r\n        They finally hope to unite:\r\n    Where ceaseless ascriptions of praise shall ascend\r\n    To God and the Lamb in a world without end.\r\n\r\nBut of all these poetesses, the most remarkable, certainly to us, is\r\nMaria Brooks, who died in 1845, the author of a curious poem entitled\r\n_Zophiel_, which Southey admired, and which Charles Lamb declared to be\r\ntoo extraordinary to have been conceived in the mind of a woman.\r\nUnfortunately, in Mr. Griswold's volume, we have only an incomplete\r\nanalysis, with some brief fragments, of this poem. Notwithstanding its\r\nincompleteness, however, there is enough to show a powerful life and a\r\nwonderful imagination. There is in the poem a surprising union of Thomas\r\nMoore and Shelley. Imagine the bowers of _Lalla Rookh_, through which is\r\nsweeping the northern tempest of Shelley, bending the trees and\r\nscattering the roses. The odes _To Cuba_, to the _Shade of her Child_,\r\nand all her other lyrics, have, in a word, a very remarkable movement,\r\nand are full of mysterious inquietudes and inexplicable burnings. We\r\ncannot have an idea of the sweetness, and at the same time the\r\nimpetuosity which mingle in her verses, without thinking of the\r\nimpossible combination of the eagle and the dove--a dove with the stroke\r\nof an eagle's wing, and which would yet, in spite of its power, retain\r\nthe timid nature of the dove, be frightened at its own strength, and\r\ntremble in looking upward to the sun. Her compositions are full of\r\ndaring ideas imperfectly expressed, as if she were afraid of the\r\nboldness of her heart. Often, however, her thoughts fall into the\r\n_alambique_, the abstract and metaphysical. Her love to her child\r\ninspired the best lines she ever composed. The sports of the little one,\r\nwhom she should see no more, associated with the remembrance of forests,\r\nplains, and cataracts, give to that love the grandeur and infinitude of\r\nAmerican Nature. Of all the female poets of the new world, Maria Brooks\r\nseems to possess most the sibylline inspirations of the celebrated women\r\nof contemporaneous Europe. Yet she has none of that Byronean spirit that\r\nreigns so much among them; and if we would indicate the European poetry\r\nschool to which she should be attached, we would cite, rather than that\r\nof Byron, the names of Southey, her admirer, of Coleridge, and of John\r\nWilson, the author of the _City of the Plague_.\r\n\r\nMaria Brooks is the only brilliant exception that we have met in the\r\ncollection of Mr. Griswold. All her poetic companions draw their\r\ninspirations, not from their individual life, but their education, and\r\nas this education is the same for all, it is not astonishing that their\r\nworks are uniform and monotonous. Yet, we do not complain, as we have\r\nalready intimated, for we are thus enabled to see some of the features\r\nof American character more easily than if an original genius inspired\r\neach of the poetesses. The religious sentiment, for example, is every\r\nwhere uttered in these verses, but indeed it is the same that we find in\r\nthe writings of American essayists--a sort of Christian theism which is\r\nbecoming more the character of Protestantism in America. The spirit of\r\nChrist breathes indeed in these pages, but the person itself is seldom\r\nseen: Christ is always the teacher and saviour of the world, but the\r\ncrucified Redeemer is well nigh forgotten. The Son of God is manifested\r\nas he appeared to his disciples; transfigured upon Tabor, they see him\r\nin the radiant light conversing with the prophets of the ancient law. Do\r\nyou prostrate humanity in the place of the disciples and the astonished\r\ncrowd at the foot of the mountain, then you have an idea of the life of\r\nthe religious faiths more and more adopted in America. But the torments\r\nof the Divine agony--the cross of Golgotha, and all the tragedy in the\r\nSaviour's history upon earth, which the nations of the middle ages and\r\nthe ancient Christians held in precious remembrance, are almost\r\nforgotten. We mention the fact as being one which the religious and\r\nphilosophic of our times may reflect upon with profit. It is the symptom\r\nof an imminent crisis in Protestantism, and sooner or later, will not\r\nfail of attracting discussion. This theistic sentiment, which is the\r\nfoundation of the writings of Channing and Theodore Parker, makes itself\r\nfelt continually in the verses of this collection which by manner or\r\nsubject relate to religion.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of nature, oddly enough, never strike, as one would\r\nexpect, by their novelty. Far away we see pleasantly the names of palms,\r\ncotton-trees, cocoa trees, and the botanic names of flowers unknown to\r\nus, but it is no matter whether we exchange all these trees and exotic\r\nplants for poplars, oaks, and birches, or the modern plants of our\r\nEurope. We feel very little, in any poetry, the particular sentiment of\r\nan original nature. In the midst of the woods and forests of the new\r\nworld, one can readily believe himself among those of France or England;\r\nhe will remark only a more lively picture of verdure and waters. Have\r\nyou ever seen the landscapes of Theodore Rousseau? The grass is greener\r\nand the yellow leaves are yellower than in the paintings of any other\r\nartist. But the presence of nature is not there. Such is the effect upon\r\nus of the descriptions given by these female poets. Here, in support of\r\nour assertion, is a picture by Mrs. Frances Green.\r\n\r\n      Stillness of summer noontide over hill,\r\n    And deep embowering wood, and rock, and stream,\r\n    Spread forth her downy pinions, scattering sleep\r\n    Upon the drooping eyelids of the air.\r\n    No wind breathed through the forest that could stir\r\n    The lightest foliage. If a rustling sound\r\n    Escaped the trees, it might be nestling bird,\r\n    Or else the polished leaves were turning back\r\n    To their own natural places, whence the wind\r\n    Of the last hour had flung them. From afar\r\n    Came the deep roar of waters, yet subdued\r\n    To a melodious murmur, like the chant\r\n    Of naiads, ere they take their noontide rest.\r\n    A tremulous motion stirred the aspen leaves,\r\n    And from their shivering stems an utterance came,\r\n    So delicate and spirit like, it seemed\r\n    The soul of music breathed, without a voice.\r\n    The anemone bent low her drooping head,\r\n    Mourning the absence of her truant love,\r\n    Till the soft languor closed her sleepy eye,\r\n    To dream of zephyrs from the fragrant south,\r\n    Coming to wake her with renewed life.\r\n    The eglantine breathed perfume; and the rose\r\n    Cherished her reddening buds, that drank the light,\r\n    Fair as the vermil on the cheek of hope.\r\n    Where'er in sheltered nook or quiet dell,\r\n    The waters, like enamored lovers, found\r\n    A thousand sweet excuses for delay,\r\n    The clustering lilies bloomed upon their breast,\r\n    Love-tokens from the naiads, when they came\r\n    To trifle with the deep, impassioned waves.\r\n      The wild-bee hovering on voluptuous wing,\r\n    Scarce murmured to the blossom, drawing thence\r\n    Slumber with honey; then in the purpling cup,\r\n    As if oppressed with sweetness, sank to sleep.\r\n    The wood-dove tenderly caressed his mate;\r\n    Each looked within the other's drowsy eyes,\r\n    Till outward objects melted into dreams.\r\n      The rich vermilion of the tanager,\r\n    Or summer red-bird, flashed amid the green,\r\n    Like rubies set in richest emerald.\r\n    On some tall maple sat the oriole,\r\n    In black and orange, by his pendent nest,\r\n    To cheer his brooding mate with whispered songs;\r\n    While high amid the loftiest hickory\r\n    Perched the loquacious jay, his turquoise crest\r\n    Low drooping, as he plumed his shining coat,\r\n    Rich with the changeful blue of Nazareth.\r\n    And higher yet, amid a towering pine,\r\n    Stood the fierce hawk, half-slumbering, half-awake,\r\n    His keen eye flickering in his dark unrest,\r\n    As if he sought for plunder in his dreams.\r\n      The scaly snake crawled lazily abroad,\r\n    To revel in the sunshine; and the hare\r\n    Stole from her leafy couch, with ears erect\r\n    Against the soft air-current; then she crept,\r\n    With a light, velvet footfall, through the ferns.\r\n    The squirrel stayed his gambols; and the songs\r\n    Which late through all the forest arches rang,\r\n    Were graduated to a harmony\r\n    Of rudimental music, breathing low,\r\n    Making the soft wind richer--as the notes\r\n    Had been dissolved and mingled with the air.\r\n    Pawtucket almost slumbered, for his waves\r\n    Were lulled by their own chanting: breathing low,\r\n    With a just audible murmur, as the soul\r\n    Is stirred in visions with a thought of love,\r\n    He whispered back the whisper tenderly\r\n    Of the fair willows bending over him,\r\n    With a light hush upon their stirring leaves,\r\n    Blest watchers o'er his day-dreams. Not a sign\r\n    Of man or his abode met ear or eye,\r\n    But one great wilderness of living wood,\r\n    O'er hill, and cliff, and valley, swelled and waved,\r\n    An ocean of deep verdure. By the rock\r\n    Which bound and strengthen'd all their massive roots\r\n    Stood the great oak and giant sycamore;\r\n    Along the water-courses and the glades\r\n    Rose the fair maple and the hickory;\r\n    And on the loftier heights the towering pine--\r\n    Strong guardians of the forest--standing there,\r\n    On the old ramparts, sentinels of time,\r\n    To watch the flight of ages.[C]\r\n\r\nThese verses are pretty, perhaps very pretty. They give nature a\r\ncharming appearance,--too much like the \"everlasting spring\" of Ovid. Do\r\nyou not seem to lie in the shade of a European forest? Here are the same\r\ntrees, the same flowers, the same animals. But the trees are more\r\nabundant of leaves, the grass is thicker, the sun is brighter, the\r\nwaters warmer. But there is no profoundly original painting, no broad\r\ndescription by a few great outlines.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of the beautiful and ideal is expressed in this collection\r\nof poetry, in an uncolored, abstract, and metaphysical manner. We are\r\nnot sure that all these women love and understand the beautiful arts,\r\nand particularly the plastic arts; the only one whose influence they\r\nfeel deeply, and which they seem to prefer, is music. And this\r\npreference among the moderns for music is a curious fact. The\r\nsuperiority given to it above painting and sculpture may be accounted\r\nfor in some degree by the fact that music accords more with woman's\r\ninstincts. Music is truly the art of the nineteenth century _par\r\nexcellence_; it is the art which expresses best incredible aspirations;\r\nit is an art democratic in its essence. Appreciated by all living\r\nbeings, even the unintelligent tribes, to be felt, music demands neither\r\nscience nor long study--it makes every one happy, and tells to each the\r\nstory of his love.\r\n\r\nTo produce sculptors, poets, and painters, it is necessary that a\r\ncountry should boast of many centuries, of a history, of a long\r\nsuccession of traditions, of established customs; but modern nations,\r\nparticularly Americans, outstrip time, act with precipitation, and have\r\nno leisure to wait the traditions of history. Hence this extraordinary\r\nlove of music, the least costly of the arts. They love music as one\r\nloves the conversations of the evening, and refreshing sleep after a\r\nhard day's labor. The art of music then is, if we dare say so, the art\r\nof nations who have no time for meditation and reflection--the art of\r\nardent and feverish nations; for, to be understood, it requires only\r\nthat a man should have a soul, with warm desires and hopes. We find in\r\nthis collection two sonnets in honor of Beethoven and Mozart, in which\r\nthe genius of the two masters is perfectly appreciated and felt. They\r\nare from Margaret Fuller, since Countess d'Ossoli, who was drowned by\r\nshipwreck on her return to her native country.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN.\r\n\r\n    Most intellectual master of the art,\r\n      Which best of all teaches the mind of man\r\n      The universe in all its varied plan--\r\n    What strangely mingled thoughts thy strains impart!\r\n    Here the faint tenor thrills the inmost heart,\r\n      There the rich bass the reason's balance shows;\r\n      Here breathes the softest sigh that love e'er knows;\r\n    There sudden fancies seeming without chart,\r\n      Float into wildest breezy interludes;\r\n    The past is all forgot--hopes sweetly breathe,\r\n    And our whole being glows--when lo! beneath\r\n      The flowery brink, Despair's deep sob concludes!\r\n    Startled, we strive to free us from the chain--\r\n    Notes of high triumph swell, and we are thine again!\r\n\r\n\r\nMOZART.\r\n\r\n    If to the intellect and passions strong\r\n      Beethoven speak, with such resistless power,\r\n      Making us share the full creative hour,\r\n    When his wand fixed wild Fancy's mystic throng,\r\n    Oh, Nature's finest lyre! to thee belong\r\n      The deepest, softest tones of tenderness,\r\n      Whose purity the listening angels bless,\r\n    With silvery clearness of seraphic song.\r\n    Sad are those chords, oh heavenward striving soul!\r\n      A love, which never found its home on earth,\r\n      Pensively vibrates, even in thy mirth,\r\n    And gentle laws thy slightest notes control;\r\n    Yet dear that sadness! spheral concords felt\r\n    Purify most those hearts which most they melt.\r\n\r\nOf these two sonnets, we prefer that of Mozart, as expressing better, in\r\nour opinion, the character of the music of the great master--as more\r\ndiscriminating than that of Beethoven--a perfect description besides of\r\nthe author of _Fidelio_. The sonnets appear curious to us as sparklings\r\nof aesthetic poetry beyond the seas.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of American pride and of national susceptibility vibrate\r\nhere and there in all this poetry, but not very often. The remembrance\r\nof the early emigrants, the description of America when inhabited by\r\nsavage hordes, and the comparison of this barbaric state with the\r\nindustrial wonders of the nineteenth century, are themes somewhat rare,\r\nbut which are nevertheless not forgotten. We have also noticed two or\r\nthree pieces which brought a smile upon our lips--where the shades of\r\nold Indian sachems appear to bless modern civilization, and seem ready\r\nto thank the Great Spirit for having exterminated their race, despoiled\r\nand chased from their own native woods and prairies. There are besides a\r\nfew pieces borrowed from historic subjects, and a few dedicated to\r\nindividuals; some pages in honor of Washington and Napoleon, and this is\r\nall. The rest is composed of mere musings, fancies, and elegies,\r\nexpressing no precise and distinct sentiment.\r\n\r\nBut what matters the relative weakness of this poetry? Let us rise to\r\nhigher spheres than that purely literary. The moral character and the\r\nvirtues which this collection of poetry suggests are superior to the\r\npoetry itself. Who can tell, indeed, the good which may be done by these\r\nmusical reveries and innocent caprices? They have been composed in the\r\nbosom of tranquility, by the fireside, among parents, children,\r\nrelatives, and friends. These were the public to which they addressed\r\nthemselves, who admired them, and drew from them their contributions to\r\nthe good and beautiful. Probably many chaste tendernesses are recognized\r\nby the banks of these little limpid fountains of poesy; many hearts have\r\nrejoiced in these tender harmonies; many a man, weary with the labors of\r\nthe day, has felt the sweet words of his daughter or his wife thrill his\r\nsoul; he has beheld the bright gleams of ideal realities, and laid\r\nhimself down and dreamed of images of higher beauty. In that hard,\r\npractical country, many poetic germs have thus taken root, many coarse\r\nnatures have become more refined. What matters it, then, whether these\r\nspecimens of poetry be original or not?--they have been useful. We offer\r\nour thanks to the female poets of America, for the seeds of piety,\r\nvirtue, and nobility sown in their country. Without noise, without\r\nhumanitary pretensions, they have fulfilled their mission of religion\r\nand refinement.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] THE FEMALE POETS OF AMERICA: BY RUFUS WILMOT GRISWOLD. Philadelphia,\r\nHenry C. Baird, 1851.\r\n\r\n[C] From Nanuntenoo, an Indian Romance. By Frances H. Green.\r\nPhiladelphia, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEANNE MARIE, AND LYRICAL POETRY IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are induced to translate for _The International_ the following\r\ncrisply written critique from _Die Grenzboten_, not only from its giving\r\nfor the benefit of certain of our _dilettanti_ German scholars a few\r\njudicious remarks on the true merit of their \"new celebrity,\" JEANNE\r\nMARIE, but because the preceding account of the present state of lyrical\r\npoetry in Germany, is very nearly as applicable to lyrical poetry as it\r\nnow exists among the rising bards of America and England as to that of\r\nthe father-land:\r\n\r\n\"It is now about a century since the beginning of our most brilliant\r\nGerman lyrical era, and we are at the conclusion of a series of\r\ndevelopments, which individually display all of the peculiarities\r\nindicative of the decline of a great epoch in art. The incredible number\r\nof subjects which have been artistically treated, has inspired the minds\r\nof our cotemporaries with an almost superfluity of poetically adapted\r\nfigures, forms, tones and materials, with which we are familiar from our\r\nfirst breath. Vast numbers of corresponding series of similes, and\r\ncombinations of words and sentences have been naturalized in our\r\nlanguage, and the spirit of the rising generation cannot be other than\r\npowerfully influenced by the incredible variety of forms and phrases,\r\nwhich it acquires during education. From all which a limitation of the\r\ncreative power naturally results--since there is hardly a sentiment,\r\nhardly a perception of the present day, which has not been rendered\r\napplicable to poetic art; and the array of these imposing creations ring\r\nin the soul of the young poet wonderfully through each other. It is\r\nalmost impossible to experience a new feeling which has not been sung,\r\nand yet the impulse still exists to win for the again and again\r\nexperienced, a value, and a certain degree of originality. From which\r\nresults the most desperate efforts, by means of bold, artificial, highly\r\npolished or tasteless images and comparisons, to form a style and\r\nacquire a peculiar literary physiognomy: efforts which should by no\r\nmeans be despised, even when the critic is compelled to blame its\r\nresults; for it is natural and unavoidable. Such a superabundance of\r\npoetic forms of address, applications, words, and measures, are at\r\npresent current in the world, that for every poetic feeling a prosaic or\r\nmetrical reminiscence rings and echoes consciously or unconsciously, and\r\nmore or less clearly, through the poetic soul. To avoid this wearisome\r\nbeaten path, our poets are driven, on the one hand, into unheard of\r\nrefinements of metre and words--or on the other, into an affected\r\nbarbarism and roughness. And since the quantity of poetic metres,\r\napplications, and forms of speech, has become so incredibly large that\r\nthey every where pass and are received as a sort of _spiritual small\r\nchange_, it has become infinitely easier to express an idea in tolerably\r\ngood poetic language, than it was fifty years ago. Gleim, Holty, and\r\nBuerger, are to us great men, not because their poems are so much better\r\nthan those manufactured at the present day, but because their every poem\r\nwas a victory gained over the barbarism and want of form in the German\r\nlanguage as it then existed--a true conquest for the realm of beauty and\r\nart. At present, any fool who has by heart his Schiller or his Heine,\r\ncan collect and write that which may pass for his 'poem'--though perhaps\r\nnot an atom of the whole is the result of aught save mere reproduction.\r\nWhat is really wanting to all our writers is the _correct_ and\r\n_artistic_ adaptation of terms. For this modern dilettanti reproduction\r\nand combination of the thoughts and forms of others is but a rough and\r\nuncomely parody of those poetic creations, which were consecrated by an\r\nearnest striving and silent battle with the force of language. Among the\r\nnumerous modern poets in Germany, there live not a dozen who can write a\r\ntruly correct verse and make just applications of our so poetically\r\nadapted language. The which assertion, seemingly a paradox--is\r\nnevertheless natural enough.\r\n\r\n\"And yet the creative impulse lives in many a soul, nor has there for a\r\nlong time existed a more generally diffused or more exquisite\r\nappreciation of lyrical poetry than during the past year. New poets of\r\nan aristocratic or pious tendency are eagerly purchased and admired,\r\nwhich is also according to rule, since they reflect the spirit of the\r\nage, and correspond with modern wants. Such a peculiar influence on the\r\ninterest of the public at large has naturally conducted to the most\r\nelegant style of publication of recent poems. It has become a real\r\npleasure to see their paper, type, and binding, and their neat garments\r\nof fine linen, delicately trimmed and lettered with burnished gold. Such\r\na highly ornamented work at present adorns every table, and appears\r\nright well in the white little hand of its fair possessor.\r\n\r\n\"The poems of Jeanne Marie, the popular romance writer, are by an\r\nintelligent and well educated lady. She has evidently observed and\r\nreflected much in the world, and had also her own experiences\r\ntherein--yet knows how to express with propriety and consciousness her\r\nmost passionate feelings. She is, however, in her poems, rather witty\r\nand calculating, than inspired with heart and soul. Those productions\r\nare, for the greater part, images and comparisons--not unfrequently very\r\nexquisitely conceived and executed--the _point_ being occasionally a\r\ngross antithesis, as for example in the poem, _Alles nur Du_:\r\n\r\n    \"'What I most longed for, thou hast to me given,\r\n      What I possess, belongeth all to thee;\r\n    Thou art mine _I_--thine is my life and heaven,\r\n      My life is thine, and thine my all _To-Be_.'\r\n\r\n\"Or in other poems, the conclusion merely amounts to the explanation of\r\na comparison, as in the _New Cloak Song_, in which on a rusty nail, a\r\ntorn cloak explains itself as the cloak of Christian love. But where our\r\npoetess simply narrates or describes, her art is truly agreeable, only\r\nthat the lively and closely detailed perceptions, which shoot forth in\r\nher soul, often appear obscure from a want of practice in poetic\r\nlanguage, and not unfrequently entirely perverted on account of an utter\r\ndeficiency in logical acuteness.\r\n\r\n\"But since this poetess is endowed with far more than her\r\ncotemporaries--_id est_, a peculiar talent to conceive and represent in\r\na lively manner epic details--let us, for the sake of art, gently beg of\r\nher to do something for this her talent. She is by far too ignorant of\r\nthe art of application of terms in lyrical poetry, her delivery is too\r\nvariable and inaccurate, while botched-up expressions (_Flickwoerter_)\r\nand startling instances of incorrectness in language are in her writings\r\nevery where to be met with. As yet she is a mere amateur and\r\n_dilettant_, and her right, to lay before the literary world her poetic\r\ninspirations, may very correctly be doubted; and yet she has evidently\r\nin her the material for something far better. This she can attain in\r\nonly one way. She must lay aside all the flaunt and tawdriness of her\r\nsimiles and figures, and then strive to express a lively emotion or an\r\ninteresting expression, with the simplest words, first in prose--and\r\n_then_ in verse. What she has written should then be carefully thought\r\nover--every line and word tested, and no inaccuracy in poetical\r\nperceptions, no oblique expression, and no metrical defect be suffered\r\nto remain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Authors and Books._\r\n\r\n\r\nA new German work, entitled _Klopstock in Zurich from the years 1730 to\r\n1751_, gives quite a new portrait of the poet of the Messias, who, both\r\nby the time of his appearance and by the dignity of his theme, is held\r\nas the patriarch of German poetry. In this sprightly little volume the\r\nmystic halo with which an exaggerated homage has invested the head of\r\nthe genial young German rolls away, and we behold a pleasant fellow in\r\ngay summer costume, floating about upon the blue lake of Zurich,\r\nsurrounded by a circle of fair and admiring votaries, to whom he chants\r\nstrains from his immortal poem, and reaps a harvest of kisses in return.\r\nWe behold a chivalrous equestrian dashing through the still streets of\r\nold Zurich, draining unreasonable depths of beer with wild students,\r\nbiting glass, and swallowing coal, until the old Bodmer with whom he was\r\nliving--a reverential admirer of the great Prophet of the Messias, and\r\nin whose imagination Klopstock sat separate in a godlike and passionless\r\nserenity--was bitterly grieved by these earthly experiences of a Greek\r\nrather than of a Christian divinity, complained, remonstrated, rebuked,\r\nuntil the jovial poet was forced to leave the good Bodmer's house, and\r\nbetake himself to Rape's, with whom he sat in silken hose, and\r\nspeculated upon the universe. It is always pleasant to hear these human\r\nfacts of the heroes of fame and imagination. Few things remove\r\nWashington farther from the general sympathy than the unbending\r\nausterity of hue in which his mental portrait is always colored. Why\r\nshould our great men, whose humanity makes them dearer, go so solemnly\r\nand sadly through all posterity? Burns could draw the tired hostlers of\r\nvillage inns from their beds to listen open-mouthed and open-hearted to\r\nhis wondrous and witching stories. Shakspeare shall always have stolen\r\nsheep, even though De Quincy proves by splendid and resonant reasoning\r\nthat he could never have done it. Raphael shall have been a warm-blooded\r\nman, spite of our cold-blooded speculations upon his saintship, so that\r\nwe shall not wonder at De Maistre's delicate and dainty truth that the\r\nFornarina \"loved her love more than her lover.\" Not that sheep-stealing,\r\nor any other peccadillo is beautiful, or in any way to be commended or\r\nimitated, but that these are the signs of human and actual sympathy\r\nwhich these great and glorious geniuses show us--as stately sky-sailed\r\ngalleons, sweeping the sea into admiring calm at their progress, might\r\nhang out simple lanterns to the fishing-smacks around, to show their\r\ncrews that the same red blood was the sap of all that splendid life. \"Is\r\nhe not the Just?\" \"Yes--and because he is the Just, I have done it.\"\r\nPoor old Herr Bodmer could not see with equanimity the illustrious guest\r\nof his imagination boating about the lake with the girls at Zurich, and\r\nselling the stanzas--of priceless worth to him--for a snatched and\r\nblushing kiss. For our own part, we are glad that generous Mr. Morikofer\r\nhas pulled off the bleached horse hair wig of factitious gravity, and\r\nshown us the natural moist and waving hair of a human-hearted poet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA _History of German Literature_, from W. WACKERNAGEL, is coming out in\r\nparts at Basle. Since Gervinus there has been no broad treatment of the\r\nsubject. But Gervinus gives us rather a history of the cultivation than\r\nof the literature of Germany. Vilmar is much too partial and partisan,\r\nand Hillebrand treats only the period from Lessing to the present time.\r\nWackernagel surveys the whole ground from the beginning. The first part\r\nof his work is occupied with the elder literature of Germany, but he has\r\nhandled it so dexterously that it interests the general reader, even\r\nwhile he develops the laws by which the old high German proceeded from\r\nthe Gothic, and the middle high German from that. He divides the\r\nliterary history into three parts. 1. The old high German era, Frank,\r\nCarlovingian, of the German Latinity of the bards. 2. The middle high\r\nGerman, beginning with the Crusades, and treating all the chivalric,\r\nsocial, and international relations which they inspired. 3. The new\r\nGerman style. The treatise is original and profound, and lacks only a\r\nlittle more elaboration of the biographical notices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA somewhat curious proof of the influence which America at present\r\nexerts, even in language, may be found in the title of a dictionary\r\n(English and German), recently published at Brunswick. The title alluded\r\nto, is as follows: _A new and complete dictionary of the English and\r\nGerman languages, compiled with especial regard to the American idiom\r\nfor general use; containing a concise grammar, &c., &c._: by WILLIAM\r\nODELL ELWELL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCARL HEIDELOFF, whose exquisite work on the architectural ornaments of\r\nthe Middle Ages, should entitle him to the gratitude of every student of\r\nmediaeval art, will publish, before the end of this month, by Geigar of\r\nNuremberz, a folio, illustrated with the finest steel engravings,\r\nentitled _Architectonic Sketches, and complete buildings, in the\r\nByzantine and Old German styles_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has long been a mooted point among the philosophers of the beautiful\r\nin Germany whether the art of gardening was a legitimate branch of\r\naesthetic culture. Bouterweck denied that the artificial perversions of\r\nan old-fashioned French garden had the slightest relation to art, but\r\nadmitted that the _Landschafts-gartenkunst_, or art of landscape\r\ngardening, might very properly be ranked with painting and sculpture.\r\nThiersch passes the subject by in silent contempt, while Tittman, whose\r\nwork on beauty and art is fast becoming a universal hand-book of\r\naesthetics, declares, on the other hand, that it is, even more than\r\narchitecture, closely allied to the study of the beautiful, since its\r\nobject is far less directly connected with human wants, and more nearly\r\nrelated to the attractive and fascinating. Herr Rudolph Siebeck would\r\nappear, however, to have put the question for a time at rest, by a work\r\nat present publishing by Voigt, in Leipsic, entitled _Die Vildende\r\nGartenkunst, in ihren modernen Formen_, which, as he very correctly\r\nasserts, \"embraces in one comprehensive theory all those laws of the art\r\nof gardening which aesthetics present, by the application of natural and\r\nartificial methods, in order to plan and execute walks and grounds,\r\naccording to the dictates of a refined taste.\" In pursuance of this\r\ngreat aim, Herr Siebeck, (who was, by the way, formerly the imperial\r\nRussian court-gardener at Lazienka, and is at present council-gardener\r\nat Leipsic,) after completing his education as a practical gardener,\r\nscientifically studied the higher principles of his art at the\r\nuniversities of Munich and Leipsic, both of which, but particularly the\r\nformer, have long been celebrated for the facilities which they afford\r\nfor this study. After which, under the kind patronage of Baron Hugel, he\r\njourneyed to \"every country\" the natives of which had so far advanced in\r\nthe art of gardening as to deserve the honor of a visit. The results of\r\nthis study and labor are given in the above-titled volume, which\r\nembraces all things, if not exactly from the cedar of Lebanon to the\r\nhyssop on the wall, at least from the largest royal park to the smallest\r\ngarden in a city. The work is illustrated with twenty colored garden\r\nplans, arranged according to the following categories: 1. Kitchen\r\nGardens. 2. Pleasure Gardens. 3. Pleasure and Kitchen Gardens. 4. Public\r\nGardens. 5. A Botanical Garden.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first volume of a new _Life of Goethe_, by J. W. SCHAFER, has been\r\npublished, of which we find flattering accounts. Also the _Life and\r\nTimes of Joachim Jurgins_, with Goethe's fragments upon his works by G.\r\nC. Guhsaner. He was the contemporary of Galileo, Kepler, Cartesius, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFRANZ LISZT, the famous pianist, has written a pleasant pamphlet in\r\nfavor of the project of a Goethean Institute of Art in Weimar, where he\r\nis chapel master.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWEIL--not _Alexander_ of the Corsaire, but Dr. GUSTAV WEIL, Professor of\r\nOriental languages and History at Heidelberg--is publishing at Mannheim,\r\na _History of the Khalifs_,[D] which, as regards extent, erudition, and\r\naccuracy, may be fairly ranked with any work on this subject extant. The\r\ntitle is, however, only partial; that of \"An Universal History of\r\nIslamism,\" would be far more appropriate. The Khalifate forms, so to\r\nspeak, a nucleus around which are grouped as integral parts all of the\r\nnumerous dynasties which were in any degree connected with the\r\nKhalifate, while those which were more nearly within its influence, as\r\nthe Saffarides, the Tulinides, Bujides, and Saljucks, are illustrated\r\nwith extraordinary learning and research. An excellent history of Arabic\r\nliterature to the midst of the fourth century of the Hegira is\r\nappropriately introduced. The reader will remember that SCHLOSSER, in\r\nthe introduction to his fourth volume of the _Weltgeschichte_, remarks\r\nthat in the oriental portion of that work he had been guided _solely_ by\r\nthe \"Life of Mohammed,\" by Weil, and this \"History of the Khalifate,\" of\r\nwhich, however, only the first volume had then appeared. _Weil_, remarks\r\nthe great \"modern Tacitus,\" \"is at present universally recognized as one\r\nof the first oriental scholars in Germany or France. He has brought from\r\nmanuscripts many new things to light, and his works may be regarded as\r\nhistorical sources.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVON RAHDEN, a German officer of note, has published some very\r\ninteresting _Reminiscences of a Military Career_. The third part, which\r\nis just completed, contains the history of his campaigns with the\r\nearliest army in Spain. He is a soldier of the old type, and was devoted\r\nbody and soul to Don Carlos--and if his story occasionally expands into\r\nromance, it is readily forgiven for the greater local truth and\r\nimpression thereby obtained. He paints battle-pieces in a most vivid\r\nmanner, pervaded by that interest in the individual which lends so\r\nfascinating a charm to all narration. In his first Spanish battle, when\r\nstationed as an outpost in the very tempest of bullets and balls, he\r\nquietly takes time to draw the country and the situation of the enemy.\r\nHis hero is Lichnowsky--the young German Prince, who was so inhumanly\r\nbutchered during the session of the German Parliament in Frankfort. He\r\nwas in Spanish battle as cool, skilful, and death-despising, as he was\r\nchivalric against the crudeness of the political philosophers, and noble\r\nagainst the beastly brutality of his assassins, in central Germany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third part of the life of BARON VON STEIN, the celebrated Prussian\r\nstatesman, is published. The chief interest of this part is the history\r\nof Stein's sympathy with the Emperor Alexander of Russia, whom he\r\nregarded as the Saviour of Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADELBERT KELLER, one of the most zealous among the mediaeval romantic\r\nantiquaries of the Tubingen school, and well known by his accurate\r\neditions of the _Gesta Romanorum, Les Romans des Sept Sages, Romancero\r\ndel Cid_, and _Gudrun_, has recently, in company with Wilhelm Holland,\r\nprepared for the press a new edition of the songs of _Guillem IX., Count\r\nof Poictiers and Duke of Aquitania_. In addition to the chair of\r\nProfessor Extraordinary of Modern Languages, (which our readers need not\r\nbe informed is nothing very extraordinary at a German university,)\r\nKeller holds the far more important office of teacher of the German\r\nLanguage and Literature at the university of Tubingen. We presume that\r\nfew men, even in France or Germany, have more carefully or\r\nenthusiastically hunted over the various MS. libraries of Italy or his\r\nown country, in search of Minnesinger and Provencal literature than\r\nKeller.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe twenty-fifth publication of the _Geschichte der Europaischen\r\nStaaten_ (History of the States of Europe) consists of continuations of\r\nhistories of Austria and Prussia. The series is edited by the well-known\r\nscholars HEEREN and UKERT. It has been in progress more than twenty\r\nyears, and is designed to embrace a complete body of American history,\r\nby competent authors. Fifty volumes have already been issued, embracing\r\nin complete works, Italy, by Leo, finished 1832; German Empire, by\r\nPfister, 1836; Saxony, by Bottiger, 1837; Netherlands, by Van Kampen,\r\n1837; Austria, by Mailath, 1850; France to the Revolution, by Schmidt,\r\n1848; France, from the Revolution, by Wachsmuth, 1844; the Histories of\r\nDenmark, by Dahlmann (vol. III. in 1844); of Portugal, by Schafer (vol.\r\nIII. in 1850); of Russia, continued by Herrmann after Strahl's decease\r\n(vol. IV. 1849); of Prussia, by Stenzel (vol. IV. 1850) are all far\r\nadvanced, and their completion may be looked for at no distant period.\r\nSingle volumes, also, have appeared, by Zinkeisen, on the Ottoman\r\nKingdom; by Ropel, on Poland; and by Bulau on the Modern History of\r\nGermany. The _Athenaeum_ observes that when the series is completed, the\r\nGermans and those who read German in other countries will have, in no\r\nimmoderate compass, a body of European history, uniform in its general\r\nplan, and maintaining a standard of competent authorship such as cannot,\r\nwe believe, be found in any other language.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe well-known Countess SPAUR, the wife of the Bavarian Ambassador at\r\nRome, is engaged upon a series of memoirs of events connected with the\r\nflight of the Pope from Rome in 1849. It will be remembered that the\r\nPope escaped under convoy of the Bavarian ambassador, and the consequent\r\ncompleteness of information added to the graceful elegance of her style,\r\nwill produce a brilliant and interesting book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA singular occurrence which took place very recently in Berlin affords a\r\ncurious illustration of a line in _The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin_, in\r\nwhich, speaking of German idioms, the writer somewhat inaccurately\r\nremarks, that \"the U, twice dotted, is pronounced like E;\" inaccurately,\r\nwe say, since this pronunciation is not found in the pure north German.\r\nDr. WIRTH, director of the opera at Berlin, was during the past month\r\nconfounded by some not very intelligent police agents of that city with\r\nthe revolutionary WURTH (who was however deceased in 1848), arrested,\r\nand subjected to much personal inconvenience, before he could prove to\r\ntheir satisfaction that he was not the _ci-devant_ disturber of kingly\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe COUNTESS IDA HAHN-HAHN, has written her spiritual experience in a\r\nwork published in Mannheim, entitled, _From Babylon to Jerusalem_. It is\r\na history of her own soul, showing how it journeyed from confusion and\r\ndoubt to peace. In it she says of the famous holy coat of Treves: \"It\r\nwas not comprehended--what did that show? How wonderful and incredible\r\nit was that thousands and thousands journeyed up the Rhine and down, not\r\nalone of the lower classes, but of the intelligent, of the cultivated\r\nand elegant class. And could this be really the Saviour's garment? And\r\nwere the cures real which had been reported in all the journals as\r\nwrought by it? Like all the rest, I shared the religious enthusiasm of\r\nwhich no Protestant can conceive. Instead of ridiculing and scorning, I\r\nwrote that I knew not if this was the identical garment, but this was\r\ncertainly the same faith that cast the woman at the feet of Christ, and\r\ncaused her to kiss the hem of his robe, and be healed. My instinct was\r\njust, but my reasoning false. For if the old faith was so fast, so\r\nglowing, and so immortal in the old church, how could I ever say better\r\n_no_ church than _one_ only?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA singular book is announced in Germany, a country in which we are not\r\naware that singular books have ever been rare, under the title of\r\n_Intercourse with the Departed by means of Magnetism_. \"A book for the\r\nconsolation of Humanity, containing the most irresistible evidence of\r\nthe personal continuance and activity of the soul after its separation\r\nfrom the body, collected from contemporary notes taken from extatic\r\nsomnambulists, by LUIS ALPHONSE CAHAGNET, with a critical preface by Dr.\r\nJ. Newberth, authorized magnetizer in Berlin and Associate of the\r\nImperial Leopold Academy of Sciences.\" A prospectus, modest enough in\r\nstyle but of very large pretensions, sets forth that it is not a\r\nspeculation, but a communication of truth, which is nowise contrary to\r\nthe Christian religion, but is calculated to exercise a genial influence\r\nupon the faithful to disperse all doubts and to advance the kingdom of\r\nFaith and Love. Who will fail warmly to wish \"God-speed\" to a work that\r\nproposes to accomplish such rich results?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Russia the singular prejudice has long obtained that the old\r\nSclavonian dialects had nothing in common with the Russian language. But\r\nthere is now a change in the opinions of the learned, and many skilful\r\nphilologists are at present engaged in scientific speculations upon the\r\nsubject. SRESNEWSKY, DAWYDOFF, and SCHEWYREFF have recently published\r\nworks upon the question. The first has \"Memoirs upon the new efforts\r\ntowards a philological investigation of the old Sclavonian Language,\"\r\nand \"Thoughts upon the History of the Russian Language.\" Dawydoff has\r\npublished \"An attempt at a Grammar of Universal Comparison of the\r\nRussian Language,\" and Schwyreff \"A Journey to the Convent of\r\nKirillo-Bjeloserski,\" an archaeological work, represented as a model of\r\nits kind. Schewyreff is a well known, educated, and learned man, fully\r\ncognizant of the results of philogical study in the west. It is evident\r\nthat Russia constantly aims to put herself abreast of western science.\r\nWostokoff is busy upon a complete grammar of the old Sclavonic language,\r\nand a dictionary of the same. Both works will soon go to press. Since\r\nDobrowsky, the area of old Sclavonian philology has much extended\r\nitself, and there can be no doubt that Wostokoff has made use of all the\r\nnew material. The study of the Sclavonian language and literature has\r\nmore than a merely philological interest. It will throw much light upon\r\nthe confused history of Eastern Europe from the sixth to the ninth\r\ncentury,--a light sadly needed, even after Schaffarik's Sclavonian\r\nantiquities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Munich, we observe that THIERSCH, Professor of Fine Arts at the\r\nUniversity of the \"German Athens,\" and whose _Aesthetik_, if not the\r\nmost philosophic, is at least the most agreeable and practical, (though\r\nwe know that _Krug_ disposes of it in conversation very briefly with the\r\nexpression \"merely eclectic,\") has published a new edition of his _Ziber\r\ndas Erechtheum auf der Akropolis zu Athen_, with excellent colored\r\nillustrations by METZGER. Out of Germany the reputation of Thiersch\r\nrests principally upon his researches into and elucidations of Athenian\r\nantiquities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA drama by an unknown poet, ROBERT PROeLSS, _The Right of Love_, attracts\r\nmuch attention in Germany, from its clear and interesting style, its\r\nfresh and lively dialogue, and the delicate drawing of its characters.\r\nThe author seems to have modelled himself upon Shakspeare, but his work\r\nshows traces also of Italian study, and the critics, without questioning\r\nProelss' originality or asserting an imitation, are reminded of\r\nMachiavelli's Mandragora. They find in the author the material of a\r\ngenuine dramatist--experience, feeling, a sharp insight into character,\r\nand great skill in dialogue. The literary eye must be fastened upon such\r\npromise. It is so refreshing to find a Phenix in a mare's nest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pictures of Travel and Study, from the North of the United States of\r\nAmerica_, is the title of a new book of travel by Mr. CHARLES QUENTIN, a\r\nGerman gentleman and official from Prussia. It is a diary of\r\nimpressions, and without aiming at any high literary or philosophical\r\nexcellence, abounds in sharp and smart observations. Some things do not\r\nescape the shrewd eye of Mr. Quentin, that not all Americans observe. As\r\nan illustration, we remark his notice of the American female habit in\r\n\"shopping,\" of tumbling over all the goods in the shop and departing\r\nwithout finding \"anything to suit.\" Hence our author infers the social\r\nsupremacy of women in America. A new way of arriving at the old fact--a\r\nfact which the sane and sensible of the sex cannot fail to perceive and\r\nacknowledge. The book is written in a vivacious, colloquial humor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nERNST FORSTER, well known as having married the daughter of Jean Paul\r\nRichter, but more celebrated for his translation of and notes to the\r\nbest version of Vasari ever published, and who would deserve an\r\nhonorable mention were it only for his well-known hospitality to all\r\nAmericans visiting Munich, has recently given to the world, through the\r\neminent bibliographist and publisher Kaiser, a brochure, entitled, _Wem\r\nGebuhrt der Krang?_ (Who deserves the Wreath?) a holiday-gift on the\r\noccasion of uncovering the colossal bronze statue of Bavaria. Next to\r\nKing Ludwig himself, there are no Germans of the present day who\r\nentertain more comprehensive or sounder views of art in its manifold\r\nrelations than Dr. Ernst Forster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the remarkable increase of late years of the use of stucco\r\nornaments in our Atlantic cities, we deem it almost a duty to call the\r\nattention of our builders to a work by Professor Eisenlohr, recently\r\npublished, at a very moderate price, by Veith, of Carlsruhre, entitled\r\n_Architectural Ornaments, in Clay and Gypsum, for practical use, with\r\nLithographed Illustrations_. Folio, 1 volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe publishing house of BROCKHAUS, one of the largest in Germany, is\r\nprinting a series of Russian novels and poems, translated into German by\r\nWilliam Wolfsohn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The History of the United States Exploring Expedition_, under\r\nLieutenant WILKES, is just translated and published in Germany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOUNT MORITZ STRACHWITZ has published a new volume of poems.

To the profession this will be a work of\r\nthe greatest interest and importance. The idea originated with Dr.\r\nDAREMBERG, a learned physician, enamored of his art, versed in the\r\nancient languages--familiar with the study of MSS., and a visitor of all\r\nthe principal libraries of Europe for the purposes of his work. The book\r\nwill comprise the text of the authors, collated with manuscripts, and\r\nwith the best editions, with a French translation and notes. To each\r\ndivision there will be a copious index. Daremberg has too well\r\nappreciated the scope and dignity of his work to suppose that it could\r\nbe accomplished by any individual, and has therefore associated with\r\nhimself several of the most distinguished savans in various departments\r\nof the undertaking, both in France and elsewhere. He comprehended no\r\nless the immense expense of the work, and applied in its inception under\r\nthe monarchy, to the Government for aid. It was granted, and the\r\nRepublic does not shrink from the fulfilment of that promise of its\r\npredecessor, in so truly a democratic work--for every thing which tends\r\nto the knowledge of the means of preserving health is essentially\r\ndemocratic. The French translation is admirably precise and clear; the\r\nnotes are numerous but useful--chiefly upon natural history--the customs\r\nof the ancients--their hygiene, and upon all points which required\r\nelucidation. The work cannot be completed for several years, but\r\nDaremberg is young and ardent, and for his future labors he will have\r\nthe solace of his first great and undoubted success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of MIRABEAU during the last three years of his life,\r\nand the complete history of his relations to the Court, is announced in\r\nParis by Le Normant, in three octavo volumes. According to the _Journal\r\ndes Debats_, the greatest part of these papers have never been printed.\r\nMirabeau, a few days before his death, (2d April, 1794,) delivered them\r\nto his friend the Count de Mark, from whose hands, when he died at\r\nBrussels in 1833, they came into the possession of M. de Barcourt. This\r\ngentleman, formerly Ambassador to the United States, has enriched the\r\nvolume with historical notes and commentaries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOUIS BLANC has published a political pamphlet called _Plus de\r\nGirondins_ (No more Girondins), in which the opposition of the extreme\r\nparty to the moderate party is expressed with the greatest force. The\r\nfreedom of the press, and the liberty of public meeting, he wishes\r\nentirely unlimited, and the clubs to be every where opened as popular\r\nschools of politics. Exile has but knit him more closely to the\r\ndemocratic ideas, for whose development he hoped so much in the\r\nRevolution of '48. His compeer, Ledru Rollin, achieved nothing by his\r\nlast year's work upon the Decadence of England, but ridicule in England,\r\nand no great fame at home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA curious anecdote is told of SCRIBE, the French vaudevilliste. He was\r\none day at work in his cabinet, when a young man entered. It was\r\nLacenaire. He seemed very modest, and stated delicately the occasion of\r\nhis visit. He had been appointed to a situation in Belgium, but was\r\nentirely without means, and requested of Scribe thirty or forty francs\r\nto pay his way to Brussels. Scribe was attracted by the young man's tone\r\nand manner. \"Thirty to forty francs,\" said he, \"are too few. I must give\r\nyou a hundred, and if you choose to repay them, you can do so to an old\r\nwoman in Brussels, who was a servant of our family. Here is her\r\naddress.\" So saying, Scribe went to his drawer and took out the gold for\r\nthe young man, who expressed his gratitude with all the elegance of a\r\ncultivated and sensitive mind, and left a copy of verses with Scribe for\r\na remembrance. Since then Lacenaire has confessed that he knew the\r\narrangement of Scribe's chamber, and had chosen an hour when the\r\nservants were absent. \"I put myself between Scribe and the bell-rope,\r\nand if he had refused me, I should have made short and noiseless work\r\nwith my knife. Scribe owed his life to his generosity.\" In this little\r\nstory is there not an averted tragedy as sad as Eugene Aram's?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new work, of great importance to the oriental student, will soon reach\r\nEngland from Siam, where it has been already published. It is a new\r\nSiamese grammar, prepared by the Roman Catholic Vicar General, who has\r\nresided in Siam for twenty years. In the \"Journal of the English\r\nArchipelago,\" Mr. Taylor Jones announces the work and its value, with\r\nsome illustrative facts in the author's life. The bishop brings to the\r\ntask not alone his own remarkable intelligence and devotion, but the\r\nresults of the inquiries of his predecessors for two centuries. The work\r\nforms a quarto of two hundred and forty-six pages, and treats of a mass\r\nof matter necessary to the understanding of the language, but which is\r\nnot elsewhere to be found. Among this the reckoning of time, of money,\r\nmeasures, and weights, as well as chronology, literature, and religion,\r\nare included. The eight or ten pages devoted to chronology afford a\r\nclear and just insight into the old history of Siam. The enumeration of\r\nSiamese books, although not complete, shows that Siamese literature is\r\nby no means poor. The miscellaneous list contains one hundred and fifty\r\nvarious books upon grammar, arithmetic, astronomy, astrology, and\r\nhistory, and many poetical works, especially romances. The various\r\nwarlike romances of China are very faithfully translated and broadly\r\ndiffused in Siam. Sometimes these ponderous productions climb to a\r\nseries of ninety volumes. The historical reports of Siam make forty\r\nvolumes, and there are no less than thirty-six holy Buddhist books. A\r\nsketch of Buddhism is given in the present work, and the good bishop is\r\nnow about commencing a Siamese dictionary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe literature of democracy has received another illustration in a\r\nsocial tragedy in five acts, by the citizen Xavier Sauriac, entitled The\r\nDeath of Jesus. Its object of course is to embody dramatically the\r\nsentiment of the old Revolution that Jesus Christ was a _Sans Culottes_,\r\nakin to the feeling which causes ardent abolitionists to assert that he\r\nwas a negro. This tragedy makes Jesus Christ a democratic philosopher,\r\nHerod an apostle, Magdalen a kind of Fleur de Marie. The hero rehearses\r\na plan for the salvation of the world, which is simply crude communism.\r\nWe quote an illustration:\r\n\r\n    \"Quand l'etat, heritier de la famille eteinte,\r\n    Sera du sol entier possesseur sans contrainte,\r\n    Qu'il serve alors de pere a tous les citoyens\r\n    Et de la vie a tous depense les moyens.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n    \"Dans les bizars brillante du luxe industriel,\r\n    Il devienue lui seul, marchand universel.\"\r\n\r\nThis work is probably a very sincere one, and deserves a prominent place\r\namong the curiosities of literature. Nevertheless, such familiar\r\npresentation of the Saviour is not only blasphemous but ridiculous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. ALEXANDER DUFAI has published in Paris a satire on socialist women,\r\nunder the title of _Lelila, ou la Femme Socialiste_, and the journals of\r\nthe sect are very angry with him that he illustrates the tendencies of\r\nsocialism by presenting as his heroine its female apostle, George Sand.\r\nThat there may be no doubt of his intention, he tells us in the preface\r\nthat he has made _Lelila_ narrate her childhood, education, and poetic\r\ndreams, her marriage with a _sous prefet_, who did not \"understand\" her,\r\nand her amours with a poet who _did_ understand her, for he carried her\r\noff; he has also made _Lelila_ marry by turns all the socialist systems\r\nin the persons of their chiefs; and finally, shows her in the revolution\r\nof 1848, presiding at _Le Club des Femmes_, and playing an active part\r\nin public life. \"After this,\" observes the _Leader_, \"he has the\r\nshameless audacity to say he attacks the 'species,' not the\r\n'individual!'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two last volumes of the Remains of SAINT-MARTIN have just been\r\nissued from the National Press in Paris, under the title, _Fragments of\r\na History of the Arsacides, posthumous work of M. Saint-Martin_. He was\r\na well-known French _litterateur_, and director of the library of the\r\nArsenal. Strange stories are told of his unwearied diligence and\r\ndevotion to details. He was the original proposer of a plan for a\r\nsystematic and scientific investigation of oriental antiquities, and\r\nanother for a collection of oriental classics. This latter was his\r\ndarling project, for the execution of which Louis XVIII. granted a\r\ncommission; but the revolution of 1830 ruined his hopes. Yet a new\r\ncommission was named, and on the day upon which it was to hold its first\r\nsession, Saint-Martin was stricken by the cholera, and died without\r\nknowing that the hope of his life would be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Univers_ at Paris announces a newly-discovered document in relation\r\nto the trial of Louis XVI., proving that the report of the Debates in\r\nthe _Moniteur_ were falsified. This document is reported to have been\r\npublished on the third of January, 1794, but has escaped all the\r\nhistorians. It occurs in the report of the commission appointed by the\r\nConvention to examine the papers found in Robespierre's possession. A\r\nletter turns up, written by the editor of the Debates of the Convention\r\nin the _Moniteur_ to Robespierre, and of this import: \"You know that we\r\nalways report more fully the speeches of the Mountain than of the other\r\nside. In Convet's complaint against you, I printed only a short sketch\r\nof his first point, but the whole of your reply. And in the report of\r\nthe King's trial I introduced on his side only enough to preserve an\r\nappearance of impartiality,\" &c., &c. Lamartine received these papers to\r\nexamine when he announced his history of the Girondins, but returned\r\nthem, saying that he could make no use of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn important work is announced by Joubert in Paris, _Les Murailles\r\nRevolutionaries_, being a complete collection of professions of faith,\r\nproclamations, placards, decrees, bulletins, facsimiles of signatures,\r\ninedited autographs, &c., from February, 1848, to the present day: three\r\nvolumes quarto.

THACKERAY, who promises to come and see us, and who, of course, will\r\ntalk about us with the world afterwards, is delivering a course of six\r\nlectures in London upon the English humorists. The first was good, and\r\nas good as was expected, which is great praise--for few things are so\r\ndifficult as for a famous man to satisfy public expectation. The London\r\n_Leader_ thus speaks of it:\r\n\r\n     \"On Thursday the great satiric painter of social life--the\r\n     Fielding of our times--commenced at Willis's rooms the first\r\n     of those 'Lectures on the English Humorists of the\r\n     Eighteenth Century,' which many months ago we announced as\r\n     in preparation. We have never heard a lecture that delighted\r\n     us more. It was thoughtful and picturesque, with some\r\n     wonderful traces of pathos and far-reaching sentences.\r\n     Dwelling upon the moral aspects of Swift's position and\r\n     career, rather than attempting a criticism on his works,\r\n     Thackeray held his audience from first to last. He gave a\r\n     vivid picture of the early life and loneliness of the great\r\n     satirist amidst the exasperating servilities and insults\r\n     endured from Temple's household, as also of the turbulent\r\n     political bravo coming up to London to carve for himself a\r\n     pathway among lords whom he despised. In this part of the\r\n     lecture it was felt that, while satirizing that condition of\r\n     political corruption which made Swift a bravo, and used him\r\n     as such, the censor still touched upon living foibles; at\r\n     the allusion to the South Sea Bubble, with its railway\r\n     parallel, we observed some fair shoulders wince! Nor were\r\n     religious cant and formalism untouched in the admirable\r\n     picture of Swift's sacrifice of his life to an hypocrisy.\r\n     The audience was of the elite--Thomas Carlyle, Macaulay,\r\n     Milman, Milnes, Sir Robert Inglis, the Duke and Duchess of\r\n     Argyle, the Duchess of Sutherland, Lady Constance Leveson\r\n     Gower, Lady Lichfield, with many others, not a few lovely\r\n     women, and several men well known in literature and art.\"\r\n\r\nOf his second lecture we quote the _Times_:\r\n\r\n     \"The heroes of his second lecture were Congreve and Addison.\r\n     For Congreve, while he admitted the brilliancy of his wit,\r\n     he evinced no great respect. He characterized him as the\r\n     greatest literary \"swell\" that ever lived. With an air of\r\n     greatness, Congreve put on his best clothes, stalked among\r\n     wits who all thronged to admire him, however eminent they\r\n     might be, and approached fine ladies with a certainty of\r\n     conquest. The \"I am the great Mr. Congreve!\" was the\r\n     complacent ejaculation which seemed to break through all he\r\n     said and did. His character as a man of gallantry was\r\n     illustrated by citations from his poems, in which he\r\n     adulates or insults the ladies whom he immortalizes, and\r\n     every where appears as the irresistible seducer, sure to be\r\n     victorious in the end. And who could resist that very great\r\n     Mr. Congreve, with his very fine coat, squeezing a hand,\r\n     covered with diamonds, through the ringlets of a dishevelled\r\n     periwig? Of the moral principle of his comedies Mr.\r\n     Thackeray spoke with disgust, and traced the worship of\r\n     youth and recklessness, and the disrespect of old age, which\r\n     are such leading characteristics in those brilliant works,\r\n     through a whole series of dramatic categories from the\r\n     comedy to the puppet-show. The constant tendency, he\r\n     humorously described, is a recommendation to \"Eat and drink,\r\n     and go to the deuce, when your time comes, if deuce there\r\n     be; and he confessed that he regarded these witty banquets\r\n     without love as he would contemplate the ruins of Sallust's\r\n     house at Pompeii, with all its ghastly relics of festivity.\r\n     The foppish depreciation of his own literary productions\r\n     with which Congreve met the compliments of Voltaire, Mr.\r\n     Thackeray rather commended than otherwise, but not for a\r\n     reason which would have pleased the great man. He really did\r\n     think his productions worthless, if weighed against one\r\n     kindly line of Steele or Addison.\r\n\r\n     \"Addison is evidently Mr. Thackeray's favorite of the\r\n     'humorists' he has brought before the public. If Swift was\r\n     the most wretched of mankind, Addison appeared to him as the\r\n     most amiable. He admired the serene, calm character, who\r\n     could walk so majestically among his fellow-creatures, and\r\n     viewing with love all below him, could raise his eyes with\r\n     adoration to the blue sky above. He admitted that Addison\r\n     was not profound, and that his writings betray no appearance\r\n     of suffering--which probably he never knew prior to his\r\n     unlucky marriage--but at the same time he expatiated on the\r\n     kindliness of his wisdom and the genuine character of his\r\n     piety. The foible of drinking he did not attempt to conceal,\r\n     but observed that we should have liked Addison less had he\r\n     been without it, as we should have liked Sir Roger de\r\n     Coverley less without his vanities. Greatly he admired the\r\n     gentle spirit of Addison's sarcasm, as distinguished from\r\n     the merciless onslaught of Swift, remarking, that in his\r\n     mild court only minor cases were tried. Nor were words of\r\n     commendation the only means by which Mr. Thackeray indicated\r\n     his predilection for Addison. Of Swift he scarcely read a\r\n     line; Congreve he illustrated, not by extracts from the\r\n     comedies in which he lives for posterity, but by those minor\r\n     poems which, though admired by his cotemporaries, are now\r\n     little regarded; but he read several extracts from the\r\n     _Spectator_, and also Addison's well known hymn, as a\r\n     specimen of his deep feeling of devotion. Addison and\r\n     Congreve were both prosperous men in a wordly point of view,\r\n     and they were therefore introduced with a survey of that\r\n     golden age, when an epithalamium on some noble marriage, or\r\n     an ode to William III., was rewarded out of the public purse\r\n     to an extent that made the poet comfortable for life.\r\n     Congreve's first literary achievements earned for him,\r\n     through the patronage of Lord Halifax, places in the\r\n     commission for licensing hackney-coaches, in the\r\n     Custom-house, and in the Pipe-office. 'Alas!' said Mr.\r\n     Thackeray, 'there are no Pipe-offices now; the public have\r\n     smoked all the pipes!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHEODORE S. FAY--of whom the literary world has heard nothing for a long\r\ntime--has in the press of the Appletons, a poem, entitled _Ulric, or the\r\nVoices_. Mr. Fay wrote good verses twenty years ago, and we shall see\r\nwhether he has lost his art.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. HART, of Philadelphia, has lately published, in a very handsome\r\nstyle, several handbooks in the mechanic arts, which are much commended.\r\nAmong them are _The Manufacture of Steel_, by Frederick Overman; _The\r\nPractical Dyer's Guide_; the _American Cotton Spinner's Guide_, and the\r\nLondon _Year Book of Facts_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are soon to have a new book from THOMAS CARLYLE--a _Memoir of the\r\nlate John Sterling_, the \"Archaeus\" of _Blackwood_, and the author of\r\nsome of the finest compositions in recent English literature. Sterling,\r\nit is known to his friends, from a devout believer became a skeptic, and\r\nthen a deist, pantheist, or perhaps an atheist, and finally, having done\r\nall that he saw to do, deliberately shut himself up to die--wrote to his\r\nfriends what time he should leave the world, and on the very day, as if\r\nby a mere volition, went to his place. All this is concealed or passed\r\nover very lightly by Archdeacon Hare, his biographer, and Carlyle\r\ntherefore determines that the world shall have his friend's true\r\nhistory. Among Sterling's most intimate correspondents was Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson, and even Carlyle cannot write his life, we suspect, without\r\nhaving access to the extraordinary series of letters the poet sent to\r\nhis American friend--letters, we have reason to believe, that will\r\ncommand a greater fame for him than all his published works have won,\r\nletters that almost any man might die to be the author of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable event connected with literature in this country is\r\nan arrangement entered into between a New-York publisher and THOMAS H.\r\nBENTON, for the publication of the _Historical Memoirs of the Life and\r\nTimes_ of that eminent person. Mr. Benton is now about sixty-eight years\r\nof age, and for half a century he has been an active participant in\r\naffairs. He was thirty years a senator from Missouri, to which state he\r\nremoved some time before its admission to the Union. His name has been\r\nconnected with many great measures, and very few have exercised a more\r\npowerful influence upon our institutions or policy. The increase of his\r\nstrength, as well as the increase of his fame, has been gradual but\r\nregular. He has been from his youth a student. To every question which\r\nhas arrested his attention he has brought all the forces of his\r\nunderstanding, and what he has acquired by incessant and painful labor\r\nhe has to an astonishing degree retained after the occasions which made\r\nit necessary have passed. At a period much beyond the noon of other men,\r\nhe was still rising. He was of the age at which Cicero achieved his\r\nhighest triumphs, before he displayed the fullness and the perfection of\r\nhis powers, in several of the remarkable debates which have had relation\r\nto our empire on the Pacific. With his extraordinary experience, his\r\nfaithful and particular memory, and wisdom which is master of his\r\ntemper, he is perhaps before every man of his time in the requisites for\r\nsuch an undertaking as that which has occupied his leisure for many\r\nyears, and the chief portion of his time since he ceased to be a\r\nsenator. His work will probably make some five large octavo volumes, and\r\nit may be believed that in fame, authority, and length of life, it will\r\nequal the immortal production of Clarendon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new _Life of Mr. Jefferson_ is soon to be published by Mr. RANDALL,\r\nwho has been honorably distinguished in his connection with the\r\ngovernment of this state. The work will embrace a very interesting\r\nsketch of the private life of Mr. Jefferson, by Mr. Thomas Jefferson\r\nRandolph, the statesman's grandson and executor. Whatever we may think\r\nof the abilities or the special services of Mr. Jefferson, we are of\r\nthat large number who regard his principles as altogether erroneous and\r\ninjurious, and his character with little respect. The time is coming in\r\nwhich his history must be written, not by a maker of books, but by a\r\nphilosophical statesman. Every year the materials are becoming more\r\naccessible. The writings of Adams and Hamilton, now in course of\r\npublication, are important contributions to them. The looked-for\r\ncorrespondence of Madison will serve largely for the same end; but Mr.\r\nJefferson's life cannot be thoroughly understood until the collection of\r\nhis papers in the possession of the government is carefully and\r\nintelligibly studied. The four volumes of his letters printed by Mr.\r\nRandolph, embrace but about eight hundred, but there were sold to the\r\ngovernment by his executor the enormous number at _forty-two thousand\r\nletters_ and other documents, of which nearly sixteen thousand were\r\nwritten or signed by Mr. Jefferson himself. A large proportion of these\r\npapers are doubtless most important for the illustration of contemporary\r\nFrench and American biography, but the whole of them should be read by\r\nwhoever attempts to write the history of the apostle of the radical\r\ndemocracy in the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Memoir _with a selection of the unpublished writings of the late\r\nMargaret Fuller, Countess d'Ossoli_, is announced as in preparation by\r\nher friends RALPH WALDO EMERSON and WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING. The letters\r\nof Margaret Fuller to the _Tribune_, would fill a large volume, and we\r\nhope they will be reprinted with the collection of her private\r\ncorrespondence and inedited essays. And some of her later critical\r\nwritings for the _Tribune_, in which the fame of more than one favorite\r\nof certain coteries was assailed--will her editors have courage to\r\nreproduce them? Pray you, gentlemen, consider that you propose bringing\r\nMargaret Fuller herself from the sea, to speak again to us in her own\r\nlanguage; if the figure you present speak not as she spoke--all that she\r\nwould speak, regardless of your regards--it will not be believed that\r\nyou have commission for what you undertake.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev.

It is not often that such nice criticism is adventured in an\r\nAmerican review. By the way, we are surprised that in none of the\r\nreviewals of Everett that have fallen under our notice has there been\r\neven the suggestion of a parallel between the classical orator of\r\nHarvard and Mr. Legare. A feeble eulogist in a Philadelphia magazine\r\ncompares him with Webster, which is merely ridiculous, as the two men\r\nhave nothing in common. It would have pleased us if Dr. Gilman had\r\nweighed the merits of the illustrious Carolinian against those of the\r\nNew Englander most deserving of critical comparison with him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. GILMORE SIMMS has in the press of a Charleston publisher a complete\r\ncollection of his poems--or rather a collection embracing all his\r\npoetical compositions which so nearly meet the approval of his judgment\r\nthat he is willing to preserve them under his name. Mr. Simms is a\r\nvoluminous writer in verse as well as in prose, and we agree to an\r\nopinion in the _Southern Literary Messenger_, that as a poet he has by\r\nno means received justice from his contemporaries. Scarce any one in\r\nthis country has produced more fair verses, and with the fair is much\r\nthat is really beautiful. How much this proportion would be increased if\r\nhe would but labor! and not turn off sonnets as editors do paragraphs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMRS.

A book of much more real value may be looked for in Catherine\r\nBeecher's _True Remedy for Woman's Wrongs_, in the press of Phillips &\r\nSampson, of Boston.

In _The International_\r\nfor May we gave some account of the design. The work is executed\r\nthroughout with great care, and Colonel Pickett may be congratulated\r\nupon having done a very important service to his State, by his arduous\r\nand intelligently prosecuted labors, of which he gives an interesting\r\naccount in the following extract from his preface:\r\n\r\n     \"About four years since, feeling impressed with the fact\r\n     that it is the duty of every man to make himself, in some\r\n     way, useful to his race, I looked around in search of some\r\n     object, in the pursuit of which I could benefit my\r\n     fellow-citizens; for, although much interested in\r\n     agriculture, that did not occupy one-fourth of my time.\r\n     Having no taste for politics, and never having studied a\r\n     profession, I determined to write a History. I thought it\r\n     would serve to amuse my leisure hours; but it has been the\r\n     hardest work of my life. While exhausted by the labor of\r\n     reconciling the statements of old authors, toiling over old\r\n     French and Spanish manuscripts, travelling through Florida,\r\n     Alabama and Mississippi, for information, and corresponding\r\n     with persons in Europe and elsewhere, for facts, I have\r\n     sometimes almost resolved to abandon the attempt to prepare\r\n     a History of my State.\r\n\r\n     \"In reference to that portion of the work which relates to\r\n     the Indians, I will state, that my father removed from Anson\r\n     county, North-Carolina, and carried me to the wilds of the\r\n     'Alabama Territory,' in 1818, when I was a boy but eight\r\n     years of age. He established a trading house, in connection\r\n     with his plantation, in the present county of Autauga.\r\n     During my youthful days, I was accustomed to be much with\r\n     the Creek Indians--hundreds of whom came almost daily to the\r\n     trading house. For twenty years I frequently visited the\r\n     Creek nation. Their green-corn dances, ball-plays, war\r\n     ceremonies, and manners and customs, are all fresh in my\r\n     recollection. In my intercourse with them, I was thrown into\r\n     the company of many old white men, called 'Indian\r\n     countrymen,' who had for years conducted a commerce with\r\n     them. Some of these men had come to the Creek nation before\r\n     the revolutionary war, and others, being tories, had fled to\r\n     it during the war, and after it, to escape from whig\r\n     persecution. They were unquestionably the shrewdest and most\r\n     interesting men with whom I ever conversed. Generally of\r\n     Scotch descent, many of them were men of some education. All\r\n     of them were married to Indian wives, and some of them had\r\n     intelligent and handsome children. From these Indian\r\n     countrymen I learned much concerning the manners and customs\r\n     of the Creeks, with whom they had been so long associated,\r\n     and more particularly with regard to the commerce which they\r\n     carried on with them. In addition to this, I often conversed\r\n     with the Chiefs while they were seated in the shades of the\r\n     spreading mulberry and walnut, upon the banks of the\r\n     beautiful Tallapoosa. As they leisurely smoked their pipes,\r\n     some of them related to me the traditions of their country.\r\n     I occasionally saw Choctaw and Cherokee traders, and learned\r\n     much from them. I had no particular object in view at that\r\n     time, except the gratification of a curiosity, which led me,\r\n     for my own satisfaction alone, to learn something of the\r\n     early history of Alabama.\r\n\r\n     \"In relation to the invasion of Alabama by De Soto, which is\r\n     related in the first chapter of this work, I have derived\r\n     much information in regard to the route of that earliest\r\n     discoverer, from statements of General McGillivray, a Creek\r\n     of mixed blood, who ruled this country, with eminent\r\n     ability, from 1776 to 1793. I have perused the manuscript\r\n     history of the Creeks, by Stiggins, a half-breed, who also\r\n     received some particulars of the route of De Soto, during\r\n     his boyhood, from the lips of the oldest Indians. My library\r\n     contains many old Spanish and French maps, with the towns\r\n     through which De Soto passed, correctly laid down. The sites\r\n     of many of these are familiar to the present population.\r\n     Besides all these, I have procured from England and France\r\n     three journals of De Soto's expedition.\r\n\r\n     \"One of these journals was written by a cavalier of the\r\n     expedition, who was a native of Elvas, in Portugal. He\r\n     finished his narrative on the 10th February, 1557, in the\r\n     city of Evora, and it was printed in the house of Andrew de\r\n     Burgos, printer and gentleman of the Lord Cardinal and the\r\n     Infanta. It was translated into English, by Richard Hakluyt,\r\n     in 1609, and is to be found in the supplementary volume of\r\n     his voyages and discoveries; London: 1812. It is also\r\n     published at length in the Historical Collections of Peter\r\n     Force, of Washington city.\r\n\r\n     \"Another journal of the expedition was written by the Inca\r\n     Garcellasso de la Vega, a Peruvian by birth, and a native of\r\n     the city of Cusco. His father was a Spaniard of noble blood,\r\n     and his mother the sister of Capac, one of the Indian\r\n     sovereigns of Peru. Garcellasso was a distinguished writer\r\n     of that age. He had heard of the remarkable invasion of\r\n     Florida by De Soto, and he applied himself diligently to\r\n     obtain the facts. He found out an intelligent cavalier of\r\n     that expedition, with whom he had minute conversations of\r\n     all the particulars of it. In addition to this, journals\r\n     were placed in his hands, written in the camp of De\r\n     Soto--one by Alonzo de Carmona, a native of the town of\r\n     Priego, and the other, by Juan Coles, a native of Zafra.\r\n     Garcellasso published his work, at an early period, in\r\n     Spanish. It has been translated into French, but never into\r\n     English. The copy in our hands is entitled 'Histoire de la\r\n     Conquete de la Floride ou relation de ce qui s'est passe\r\n     dans la decouverte de ce pais, par Ferdinand De Soto,\r\n     Composee en Espagnol, par L'Inca Garcellasso de la Vega, et\r\n     traduite en Francois, par St. Pierre Richelet, en deux\r\n     tomes; a Leide: 1731.'\r\n\r\n     \"I have still another journal, and the last one, of the\r\n     expedition of De Soto. It was written by Biedma, who\r\n     accompanied De Soto, as his commissary. The journal is\r\n     entitled 'Relation de ce qui arriva pendant le voyage du\r\n     Captaine Soto, et details sur la nature du pas qu'il\r\n     parcourut; par Luis Hernandez de Biedma,' contained in a\r\n     volume entitled 'Recuil de Pieces sur la Floride,' one of a\r\n     series of 'Voyages et memoires originaux pour servir a la\r\n     L'Histoire de la Recouverte de L'Amerique publies pour la\r\n     premier fois en Francois; par H. Ternaux-Compans. Paris:\r\n     1841.'\r\n\r\n     \"In Biedma there is an interesting letter written by De\r\n     Soto, while he was at Tampa Bay, in Florida, which was\r\n     addressed to some town authorities in Cuba. The journal of\r\n     Biedma is much less in detail than those of the Portuguese\r\n     Gentleman and Garcellasso, but agrees with them in the\r\n     relation of the most important occurrences.\r\n\r\n     \"Our own accomplished writer, and earliest pioneer in\r\n     Alabama history--Alexander B. Meck, of Mobile--has furnished\r\n     a condensed, but well written and graphic account of De\r\n     Soto's expedition, contained in a monthly magazine, entitled\r\n     'The Southern,' Tuscaloosa, 1839. He is correct as to the\r\n     direction assumed by the Spaniards, over our soil, as well\r\n     as to the character of that extraordinary conquest.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall recur to the work on receiving the second volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLORD CAMPBELL, (who is himself a somewhat voluminous author, in history\r\nand general literature,) has reversed the decision of Baron Rolfe, given\r\nlast year, and has decided that foreigners _first publishing_ in England\r\nare entitled to copyright. He declared that the act of Anne for the\r\nencouragement of learning was furthered by allowing a copyright to\r\naliens who first published in England, that Parliament had always\r\nfavored the importation of foreign literature, and that the law would\r\nstill protect the property of the foreign author, recognize his rights,\r\nand give him redress for all wrongs inflicted upon him in England.\r\n\r\nThis decision is one of very great importance, though not final, as the\r\npirating booksellers have determined to carry the matter before the\r\nHouse of Lords, where Brougham, Lyndhurst, and several others of great\r\nauthority, are known to be against them. Meantime, Bentley and the other\r\npurchasers of American copyrights, have issued advertisements warning\r\nthe public against the purchase of unauthorized editions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. DR. BAIRD has added to the number of his works _The Christian\r\nRetrospect and Register, a Summary of Scientific Moral and Religious\r\nProgress in the First Half of the XIXth Century_. (_12mo. M. W. Dodd._)\r\nIt is an interesting compend of events, of which even a condensed\r\nhistory might fill a dozen volumes. In all respects it is superior to a\r\nwork of the same design published by Dr. Davis, and formerly reviewed in\r\nthis magazine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Parthenon_, is the title of a new work, remarkable for the beauty\r\nof its typography and of its wood cuts, to be published by Loomis &\r\nGriswold.

The first number contains, with a new story by Mr.\r\nCooper, the best poem ever published by Mr. Duganne, and two really\r\nexcellent poems by William Ross Wallace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOUISA PAYSON HOPKINS has just published (Gould & Lincoln of Boston) an\r\nexcellent little volume in practical religion, entitled _Life's Guiding\r\nStar_, and designed to illustrate the second and third questions of the\r\nWestminster Catechism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe works of the late Rev.

Here is\r\none from the _National Era_:\r\n\r\n\r\nANNIE CLAYVILLE.\r\n\r\n      In the bright'ning wake of April\r\n        Comes the lovely, lovely May,\r\n      But the step of Annie Clayville\r\n        Falleth fainter day by day.\r\n      In despite of sunshine, shadows\r\n        Lie upon her heart and brow:\r\n      Last year she was gay and happy--\r\n        Life is nothing to her now!\r\n\r\n      When she hears the wild bird singing,\r\n        Or the sweetly humming bee,\r\n      Only says she, faintly smiling,\r\n        What have you to do with me?\r\n      Yet, sing out for pleasant weather,\r\n        Wild birds in the woodland dells--\r\n      Fly out, little bees, and gather\r\n        Honey for your waxen wells.\r\n      Softly, silver rain of April,\r\n        Come down singing from the clouds,\r\n      Till daffodils and daisies\r\n        Shall be up in golden crowds;\r\n      Till the wild pinks hedge the meadows,\r\n        Blushing out of slender stems,\r\n      And the dandelions, starry,\r\n        Cover all the hills with gems.\r\n      From your cool beds in the rivers,\r\n        Blow, fresh winds, and gladness bring\r\n      To the locks that wait to hide you--\r\n        What have I to do with spring?\r\n\r\n    May is past--along the hollows\r\n        Chime the rills in sleepy tune,\r\n      While the harvest's yellow chaplet\r\n        Swings against the face of June.\r\n\r\n      Very pale lies Annie Clayville--\r\n        Still her forehead, shadow crowned,\r\n      And the watchers hear her saying,\r\n        As they softly tread around:\r\n      Go out, reapers, for the hill tops\r\n        Twinkle with the summer's heat--\r\n      Lay from out your swinging cradles\r\n        Golden furrows of ripe wheat!\r\n      While the little laughing children,\r\n        Lightly mixing work with play,\r\n      From between the long green winrows\r\n        Glean the sweetly-scented hay.\r\n      Let your sickles shine like sunbeams\r\n        In the silver-flowing rye,\r\n      Ears grow heavy in the cornfields--\r\n        That will claim you by and by.\r\n      Go out, reapers, with your sickles,\r\n        Gather home the harvest store!\r\n      Little gleaners, laughing gleaners,\r\n        I shall go with you no more.\r\n\r\n      Round the red moon of October,\r\n        White and cold the eve-stars climb,\r\n      Birds are gone, and flowers are dying--\r\n        'Tis a lonesome, lonesome time,\r\n      Yellow leaves along the woodland\r\n        Surge to drifts--the elm bough sways,\r\n      Creaking at the homestead window\r\n        All the weary nights and days.\r\n      Dismally the rain is falling--\r\n        Very dismally and cold;\r\n      Close, within the village graveyard,\r\n        By a heap of freshest mould,\r\n      With a simple, nameless headstone,\r\n        Lies a low and narrow mound,\r\n      And the brow of Annie Clayville\r\n        Is no longer shadow-crowned.\r\n      Rest thee, lost one, rest thee calmly,\r\n        Glad to go where pain is o'er--\r\n      Where they say not, through the night-time,\r\n        \"I am weary,\" any more.\r\n\r\nMR.

The foundations\r\nof the old Council House were disclosed, and farther investigation led\r\nto the discovery of very beautiful remains. They are mostly fragmentary,\r\nbut of the finest style. Especially an arm, with drapery, is very fine,\r\nand as the investigations are not yet completed, it is hoped that other\r\nparts of the statue may be obtained. More than sixty inscriptions have\r\nbeen also revealed. They are mostly decrees in praise of and memorials\r\nof honor to certain men. Some are of the Macedonian, others of the Roman\r\nperiod. Mr. Pittakis, the long resident and famous Athenian antiquariae,\r\nhas been properly put at the head of the party of investigation. His\r\ntopographical knowledge of Athens is probably superior to that of any\r\nother living man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe German painter CORNELIUS has recently composed a picture for the\r\nhospital of the Sisters of Charity in Berlin. The cartoon is at present\r\nin Dresden, where it will be cut in wood by the artist's old friend,\r\nDirector von Schnorr, for the Art-Guild there. It will afterward be\r\nengraved upon steel, and sold for the benefit of the hospital. The\r\nsubject is taken from the life of Elizabeth. The mother of the Landgrave\r\nof Thuringen has seen that Elizabeth has laid a beggar on the nuptial\r\nbed, for the purpose of nursing her, and he brings her son to see how\r\nhis wife forgets his dignity as well as her own. But her worldly\r\nselfishness is shamed in the most surprising manner. An angel has drawn\r\naside the curtain, and the landgrave, instead of a beggar, beholds the\r\nSaviour himself, who, with gentle aspect, stretches his hand toward the\r\nmother and son. Under the picture is the motto, \"What ye have done to\r\nthe least of these brethren, that ye have done to me.\" In its essential\r\ncharacter this picture resembles the cartoon for a painting upon glass\r\nin the cathedral of Aix. In both pictures the artist has reverted to the\r\nsensibility of his youth, and created forms which recall the paintings\r\nof the old German and elder Italian masters. In the present drawing the\r\nfigures of Elizabeth and of the two angels (one of whom is in a\r\nreverential posture behind the bed) are radiant with celestial\r\ntenderness and loveliness. From the countenance of Christ beams the\r\ndivinely mild rebuke of the deepest feeling of mistaken virtue. The\r\nlandgrave, a fine manly figure, is full of the earnest expression of the\r\nknowledge fast dawning upon his mind, and his mother shows\r\ncharacteristic worldliness subdued by a higher power. The whole picture\r\nis penetrated by the devotional sentiment of the middle ages. These are\r\nnot modern figures in middle age costume, but men who belong to their\r\ntime by expression and bearing. In the freedom and simplicity of\r\ntreatment we recognize the master, who may properly reproduce the life\r\nand art of a past time, from his entire sympathy with it. Another\r\ncartoon in the great series for the Berlin Campo Santo, upon which\r\nCornelius is now engaged, represents the happiness of those who hunger\r\nand thirst after righteousness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA German critic, speaking of the statues of the Greek Slave by Powers\r\nand of the Wounded Indian by Stevenson, says of the latter that the\r\ntouch of genius is visible in the work, but it is only the copying of\r\nnature, and has no ideal character; and of the former that the artist\r\nmust have developed his talent by long and patient study and\r\ncontemplation of the finest creations of art. The forms of nature are\r\nnot only reproduced, with the most poetic truth, but a glow of spiritual\r\nbeauty breathes all over the work. It is most interesting, concludes the\r\ncritic, to see the laying of the corner-stone of American art, an\r\nedifice whose completion none of us will live to see.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Festival of the unveiling of the statue of Frederick the Great, at\r\nBerlin, on the last day of May, is represented as one of the most\r\nsplendid spectacles ever witnessed in that city. The memory of \"Old\r\nFritz\" is cherished with a peculiar enthusiasm by the masses, who turned\r\nout in immense numbers. The day was the 110th anniversary of Frederick's\r\nascending the throne. The monument is a real historical work, and,\r\nbesides its artistic merit, may be consulted as an authentic record of\r\nthe warriors and statesmen who helped to found a great kingdom. It is an\r\nimmense advance on the insipid allegorical style, with its eternal Fames\r\nwith trumpets, and Victories descending with garlands. Except in one or\r\ntwo of the small bas-reliefs, Rauch has adhered to strict reality, only\r\nso skilfully modified that it never becomes vulgar or commonplace. His\r\nZiethens and Winterfeldts are warriors as stern and dignified in their\r\n\"regulation\" uniforms as if they were presented on the fields of Torgau\r\nand and Rossbach, like Achilles and Hector on the plains of Troy. A\r\nletter in the London _Times_ says there were present about eighty aged\r\nsoldiers who had served under the great King, and one old Hussar, of\r\nZiethen's regiment, was pointed out as having actually fought in the\r\nSeven Years' War; the junior of the party could not be less than\r\nfourscore; they were all accommodated with seats specially provided for\r\nthem; they wore the uniform of the period, of the old regulation cut,\r\nbut newly made for the day, so that the veterans looked quite brilliant.\r\nSome of them, perhaps, had not worn a uniform for half a century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe author of _Wanderings of a Pilgrim, during Four-and-Twenty Years in\r\nthe East_, has employed herself, since her return to England, in\r\nsuperintending the painting of a Diorama of Hindostan. Perhaps no one\r\nelse has so numerous a collection of beautiful sketches taken in the\r\nEast, and few, indeed, possess her knowledge of Indian manners and\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the close of last month the bronze statues of Gustavus Adolphus, and\r\nof Tegner, the Swedish poet who wrote the _Children of the last Supper_,\r\nwere cast in Munich.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince our last number, JENNY LIND has closed the series of her farewell\r\nconcerts in New-York, and a week afterward dissolved her business\r\nrelations with Mr. Barnum. Her career of nine months in this country has\r\nbeen a triumph unprecedented in the history of artistic success. She has\r\nappealed everywhere to the great general sympathy of the multitude, and\r\npartly, undoubtedly, owing to the prestige of her European fame, and the\r\nwonder at her remarkable vocalism, she has sung always before an\r\naudience essentially and characteristically American.\r\n\r\nBut the great service she has rendered, the fact which history would\r\nregard, is her introduction to us of some of the finest music,\r\npresented in a manner entirely adequate, and yet entirely different from\r\nall to which we were accustomed. She has illustrated the fact, that a\r\nnoble nature ennobles the position of a public artist, and that the most\r\nappreciative artistic sympathy with the highest and most unpopular\r\nmusic, has yet something popularly sympathetic. It is the old story of\r\ngreat genius. It is Burns, again, at once the despair of the most\r\nbrilliant and cultivated talent, and the delight of the entirely\r\nilliterate and vulgar sense. From this career of JENNY LIND must date a\r\nnew era for us, both in musical taste and musical criticism. Now that\r\nshe has shown us what is good music, whether popular or not, and what is\r\nperfect performance of it, whether in any favorite school or not, it\r\nwill no longer do to smear mediocrity with superlatives, or to criticise\r\nmusic upon any grounds other than those of the criticism of all other\r\narts. The manner in which JENNY LIND took our Penates, our _Sweet Home_,\r\nand _Auld Robin Gray_, and _Comin' thro' the Rye_, and restored them to\r\nus with a more graceful and significant life, was one of the most\r\nbeautiful signs of the presence and power of genius. To that, every\r\nthing has been subservient. The large and gracious charities of the\r\nwoman, the natural simplicity of her manner, and the personal magnetism\r\nwhich she every where diffused, were but the ornaments of the pure\r\nartistic nature, the divine priesthood of genius. JENNY LIND continues\r\nher progress through the country. It is understood that, after a month,\r\nshe will retire from the public eye, for the rest which she so much\r\nrequires, and afterwards, we learn from the best authority, she will, if\r\npossible, resume her concerts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE OPERA.--Immediately upon the departure of JENNY LIND, Mr. Maretzek\r\nopened the doors of the Astor Place Opera House for a short season,\r\npreparatory to his summer campaign in Castle Garden. Under his auspices\r\nBOSIO has reappeared, and BETTINI has made his bow. BOSIO is so\r\nbeautiful a woman, she has a voice so subtly sweet and sympathetic, a\r\nstyle of singing so simple and sufficient, and an instinctive\r\nfeminineness of feeling fine enough to make her acting always agreeable,\r\nthat her impression as a Prima Donna is the most symmetrical we have\r\nknown in New-York. Her womanliness is her charm and her success. Even in\r\ncharacters of so grandiose proportions in the imagination, as\r\n_Lucrezia_, she never drops for a moment the interest of the spectator,\r\nalthough it is new to him to find a tender feeling in his regard for the\r\nBorgia. This tenderness, however, is not fatal to the artistic effect.\r\nIt is that quality of feeling which he would have for a lost but lovely\r\nMagdalen. BOSIO'S _Zerlina_ is another quite perfect representation. Its\r\narch grace and sparkling beauty have never been surpassed by any Zerlina\r\nwe have seen. BOSIO, however, sketches rather than colors. Her acting is\r\na suggestive outline which the imagination naturally fills--and, within\r\nthe range of singers possible to us, we could select none so singularly\r\nfascinating as Bosio for the summer moonlight at Castle Garden.\r\n\r\nBETTINI is a young man, with a fresh, sweet, sympathetic tenor voice,\r\nwhich happily harmonizes with BOSIO'S. He has rather too magniloquent a\r\nstyle both of acting and singing, but is a very agreeable artist. We\r\ncould lay in the shadows of his portrait delicately, yet deeply enough,\r\nby saying that he is _young_. He has made a decided hit upon the town,\r\nand the first evening at Castle Garden attracted an audience of not less\r\nthan three thousand.\r\n\r\nDonizetti's opera of _Marino Faliero_ has been produced at Castle\r\nGarden, for the first time in America. It is only second rate music, but\r\nwas admirably sung by the company. MARINI looks the Doge and wears the\r\nducal robe with great dignity and success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS VON DER FLUE.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE BY THE AUTHOR OF \"RURAL\r\nHOURS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century proved an eventful and important period of Swiss\r\nhistory. The age which preceded it gave birth to the people, and brought\r\nthem an independent existence and a name; but it left them at its close\r\nthe mere skeleton of a political body, and it was not until a later day\r\nthat their national constitution received fulness and development--it\r\nwas not until the fifteenth century that the people acquired a clearly\r\ndistinct character and position among the countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the most celebrated battles in Swiss history, those which\r\ngave the confederates military fame with other nations, belong to this\r\nperiod. The battle of St. Jacques is altogether one of the most\r\nextraordinary on record. Thirty thousand French troops, chiefly from the\r\nfree company of Armagnac, commanded by the Dauphin, afterwards Louis\r\nXI., marched to the defence of Zurich, which had revolted against the\r\nconfederacy. They arrived at Basle in August, 1444. Fifteen hundred\r\nSwiss, from the cantons of Berne, Lucerne, Soleure and Basle, were\r\ndispatched to meet them. They found several thousand of the enemy in\r\nadvance. These they attacked, repulsed, and pursued to the river Birs,\r\nand then, dashing into the stream after the flying enemy, and in face of\r\na heavy cannonade, they actually assaulted the whole army of France in\r\ntheir camp on the opposite shore. The daring corps were soon divided,\r\nbut they fought like lions. Five hundred were in an open meadow, exposed\r\non all sides to the enemy; the remaining nine hundred threw themselves\r\nbehind a garden wall. These last repulsed the enemy there several times,\r\nand made two attacks in their turn. Hundreds and thousands of the\r\nArmagnacs fell--man by man the brave Swiss were struck down. The battle\r\nlasted ten hours before the whole corps of Swiss had fallen, for then\r\nonly could the enemy pause. Fourteen hundred and ninety of the\r\nconfederates were numbered with the dead, ten men only escaping by\r\nflight. Thousands upon thousands of the French army lay piled about the\r\ndead Swiss. This defeat, if such a name be fitted to the battle of St.\r\nJacques, produced all the results of a victory: the siege of Basle was\r\nabandoned, a peace was speedily concluded, and it was in consequence of\r\nthis brilliant action that Louis XI., when he ascended his father's\r\nthrone, concluded with the Swiss that close alliance which has lasted\r\nnearly to the present times.\r\n\r\nIt was in the fifteenth century also that Charles of Burgundy attacked\r\nthe confederates with all the forces of one of the richest and most\r\npowerful princes of the age. On the third of March, 1476, twenty\r\nthousand Swiss marched from Neufchatel to meet the army of Burgundy near\r\nGranson, a force which, with its followers, numbered one hundred\r\nthousand strong. The battle began in the morning, and at night Charles\r\nthe Bold was flying through the passes of the Jura, with five\r\ncompanions, his brilliant army dispersed to the four winds of heaven,\r\nhis choicest treasures in the hands of the frugal Swiss. In the month of\r\nJune of the same year Charles again appeared in Switzerland, at the head\r\nof an army still larger than that he had commanded at Granson. On the\r\ntwenty-second of June he lay before the little town of Morat, which he\r\nhad assaulted in vain. The Swiss, with thirty-four thousand men,\r\nadvanced to meet him, and with their usual ardor rushed upon the whole\r\nBurgundian force. In a few hours they had again routed an invading army\r\nnearly four times their own numbers. Charles fled from the field, with a\r\nsmall escort, leaving fifteen thousand of his army dead on the battle\r\nground, while thousands more were drowned in the adjoining lake.\r\n\r\nHaving been thus successful when opposed to northern troops, the Swiss\r\nshortly after tried their strength against a southern foe, the Duke of\r\nMilan. On this occasion the confederates were the aggressors, although\r\nunder the plea of retaliation. A party of Italians had cut timber in one\r\nof their forests. Immediately a descent upon the Italian valleys was\r\nplanned, and a considerable force crossed the southern Alps. A Milanese\r\narmy of fifteen thousand men marched up the Ticino to meet the\r\nmountaineers. At the village of Giornico lay the Swiss vanguard of six\r\nhundred men, from Uri, Schweyz, Lucerne, and Zurich, the main body of\r\ntheir troops not having yet advanced so far. It was mid-winter of the\r\nyear 1478. The Swiss caused the Ticino to overflow the meadows before\r\nthe village, which soon became a field of ice; and as the Milanese army\r\nadvanced upon Giornico, the confederates sallied out upon _skates_, and\r\nwith this advantage over their enemies, six hundred Swiss put to flight\r\na Milanese army of fifteen thousand men.\r\n\r\nAt that period the principal weapons were crossbows, arquebuses, lances,\r\nand halberds. Battle-axes and swords were also common, as well as knives\r\nand daggers. The body was still protected by armor, generally among the\r\nSwiss of plain workmanship; the head was covered by a helmet, or among\r\nthe common soldiery with a thick felt hat, ornamented with feathers of\r\nthe ostrich or the cock, according to the means of the owner. A white\r\ncross was stitched on the clothing in conspicuous places, and served as\r\na common uniform badge with the confederates.\r\n\r\nVictories so brilliant as those of Granson, Morat, and Giornico, with a\r\ndefeat so advantageous as that of St. Jacques, spread the fame of the\r\nmountaineers through Europe--princes eagerly sought their aid as\r\nmercenaries; they were frequently opposed to each other in rival armies,\r\nand as their fidelity became as well known as their courage, they were\r\nsolicited to form the body-guards of royalty.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss guards of the kings of France have a place in history. Their\r\nhonorable fidelity to Louis XVI. is known the world over. Even within\r\nthe present century the Swiss have watched at the gates of the\r\nTuileries, Louis XVIII. having revived the custom on his return to\r\nFrance. After the Hundred Days, however, the body was finally disbanded.\r\nTo the present hour it is understood that the King of Naples and the\r\nPope are still (or were very shortly since) surrounded by body-guards\r\nfrom the confederacy.\r\n\r\nBut much as these different wars added to Swiss glory, they were\r\nfollowed by serious evils to the nation. A warlike, rapacious spirit,\r\nand with it the love of a roving, restless life, spread with wonderful\r\nrapidity among the people. Their mountain homes were deserted, their\r\nlands lay fallow, their flocks were sold to procure the means of arming\r\nthemselves, employment among foreign powers was eagerly sought, and when\r\nit could not be obtained, parties of disbanded soldiers and idle\r\ncamp-followers spread disorder through the country to such an extent\r\nthat the severest measures were resorted to, and in the space of a few\r\nmonths as many as fifteen hundred vagabonds of this description were\r\npublicly executed.\r\n\r\nThe rich spoils of the Burgundian army produced a very unhappy effect.\r\nThe gold, and silver, and jewels found in the deserted camp gave the\r\nconquerors a taste for riches to which they had hitherto been strangers.\r\nFormerly they had been a frugal and contented people, but a few short\r\nyears produced a very striking change in this respect; a thirst for gold\r\nbecame general, bribes were openly offered and received, and foreign\r\ncoin had an all-powerful influence in directing the course of their\r\npolitics. Not only were the military openly in the pay of their\r\nneighbors, but the public men of the different cantons were only too\r\nwell acquainted with German florins, Italian ducats, and French crowns.\r\nIt is true, this fact was not considered so disgraceful in those times\r\nas it would be to-day. For, two hundred years since, half the court of\r\nEngland, with the king at their head, were in the pay of Louis XIV. But\r\nit would appear that bribery became more frequent and more impudent in\r\nSwiss politics than in those of other countries at the same period. On\r\none occasion the French minister had his money-bags publicly opened at\r\nBerne, and the royal pensions or bribes distributed in the town with the\r\nsound of the trumpet. At Friburg heaps of crowns were openly displayed,\r\npiled up with shovels, and the bystanders were asked if the silver did\r\nnot sound better than the empty promises of the Emperor Maximilian,\r\nnicknamed _Pochidanari_, or the Pennyless. At another time the French\r\nambassador went to the baths of Baden, in Arau, where people from all\r\nparts of the country were assembled, kept open house, paid the score for\r\nlarge troops of the company, and actually threw gold into the bathing\r\nrooms, for the women to scramble for. The result of a course like this\r\nwas very injurious to Swiss character. Highly honorable for courage and\r\nfidelity, it has yet been considered as too generally colored by the\r\nlove of money, verifying the proverb, \"_point d'argent, point de\r\nSuisse_.\"\r\n\r\nBut this mercenary spirit was not the only evil brought upon the\r\nconfederacy by the victories of the fifteenth century. Internal\r\ndifferences of the gravest nature soon followed. The division of the\r\nspoil was very unsatisfactory to the rural cantons. They made loud\r\ncomplaints of injustice, and became extremely jealous of the greater\r\nintelligence, power, and influence of the towns; while the burghers, in\r\ntheir turn, became suspicious of the pastoral cantons, accusing them of\r\nwishing to promote disturbances between themselves and their\r\nsubjects--subjects, we say, for the towns having acquired by conquest or\r\npurchase parcels of territory here and there, governed them as the\r\nfeudal lords governed their vassals. In short, from the whole history of\r\nthat period it is evident that a spirit of suspicion and jealousy was\r\nrife throughout the confederacy, threatening disunion and revolution. In\r\nthe hope of restoring confidence and unity, a council or Diet was\r\nconvened at Stantz, one of the principal towns of the canton of\r\nUnterwalden.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the deputations from the different cantons made their\r\nappearance at the little town of Stantz. They came by the lake of\r\nLucerne, or lake of the forest cantons, as it is more frequently called\r\nby the people themselves, a beautiful sheet of limpid water, lying in\r\nthe bosom of noble Alpine mountains, with sweet pastoral valleys opening\r\nhere and there among the solemn cliffs. There were soldiers, merchants,\r\nlawyers, and peasants in the assembly; there were burghers from Berne,\r\nZurich, and Lucerne, with shepherds from Schwyz and Uri; in addition to\r\nthe regular deputies, there were also agents from St. Gall, Appenzell,\r\nSoleure, and Friburg, applying for admission to the confederacy, to\r\nwhich they had been hitherto only allies. It was in the winter season\r\nthat the Diet assembled. The session was scarcely opened when it became\r\nevident that they had met in an evil temper; every subject introduced\r\nwas received with bitterness, mistrust, and suspicion. The angry\r\npassions of the rural cantons were thoroughly aroused; they were\r\nextremely jealous of the towns, and no reasoning could induce them to\r\naccede to the application for admission from Friburg and Soleure. These\r\ndistricts were headed by important cities, and every city was accused of\r\ntyranny. The burghers knew too much, they were too rich, they were too\r\nprosperous. The deputies of the larger cantons, on the other hand, were\r\nindignant at this petty jealousy, and at the refusal to receive Soleure\r\nand Friburg, whose citizens had fought side by side with them in so many\r\nof their struggles. The subject of the division of the spoils from the\r\nwar with Burgundy was again advanced by the rural cantons with renewed\r\nbitterness. In short, every matter broached seemed to offer only another\r\nfield for mistrust and fierce contention.\r\n\r\nWhile the Diet was thus holding its stormy session at Stantz, a\r\nconspiracy against Lucerne was discovered. The peasants of a rural\r\ndistrict subject to the town were implicated in it; they had resolved to\r\nseize the occasion of an approaching festival for attacking the\r\nburghers, murdering the governor and council, and razing the city to the\r\nground, so that in future nothing but a village, like their own, should\r\nexist on the spot. Tidings of the discovery of this conspiracy only\r\naggravated the evil temper of the Diet. From invective and accusation\r\nboth parties proceeded to the gravest threats. The deputies of Friburg\r\nand Soleure, in the hopes of restoring a better understanding,\r\nvoluntarily withdrew their application, but in vain. Both parties were\r\ntoo highly exasperated. Reconciliation was held to be impossible.\r\nDisunion and civil war, that most wretched, most shameful warfare, were\r\ndeclared inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe canton of Unterwalden was divided into two districts, each including\r\none of the two great gorges of that region. Each of these valleys had\r\nits own towering mountains, with rocky summits, wooded heights, and\r\ngreen alpine pastures. Through each flowed a stream, or rather wild\r\ntorrent, and the more level lands on their banks were thickly sprinkled\r\nwith rustic dwellings, in near neighborhood. Stantz, the seat of the\r\nDiet, and a mere village, was the principal town of Lower Unterwalden.\r\nThe sister valley of Upper Unterwalden was the most fertile and\r\nbeautiful. Its chief village was Sarnen. A stream called the Melch ran\r\nthrough a branch of the valley, to which it gave its name of Melchthal.\r\nThis dale was already noted ground in Swiss history, as the native spot\r\nof two of their heroes. Arnold von Melchthal, the companion of Tell,\r\nwas a peasant of this valley, as his name denotes; and Arnold von\r\nWinkelried, to whose heroic self-sacrifice they owed the victory of\r\nSempach, was also born and lived on the banks of the Melch. During the\r\ntime of the critical Diet of Stantz, there lived in this valley a family\r\nby the name of Loewenbrugger. They were among the most important\r\npeasants of the dale. Ten children, five sons and five daughters, had\r\nbeen born in the paternal cottage. Some were living there at the time,\r\nwith their mother, others had married and gone to different homes. The\r\nfather was absent. Nicholas Loewenbrugger had for many years held a\r\nconspicuous position in his native district. He had served his country\r\nfaithfully on many occasions by his wisdom and his courage. During their\r\nwars he had distinguished himself highly, not only for bravery, but also\r\nfor humanity. When still in middle life, however, he had retired from\r\nthe little world about him, leaving his paternal estate to the care of\r\nhis wife, and choosing a cliff on one of the neighboring mountains, he\r\nthere built himself a hermitage, in which he gave up his whole time to\r\ndevotion and religious services. So great was the simplicity of his\r\nascetic life, that it is said his only bed was the floor of his cell,\r\nand his pillow a stone. It was even believed that for years he had taken\r\nno other nourishment than the blessed elements of the holy sacrament.\r\nWhatever exaggerations may have been credited in that superstitious age,\r\nit is at least certain that his unfeigned piety and saintly life had\r\nacquired for him a high place in the respect of his countrymen, while\r\nthe name of Nicholas von der Flue, or Nicholas of the Rock, from the\r\nspot where he dwelt, was honored far and wide through the cantons.\r\n\r\nNews of the fierce dissensions of the Diet of Stantz spread rapidly\r\nthrough the different valleys about the lake of the forest cantons;\r\nevery hour it was expected that the assembly would break up in violence,\r\nand the deputies hurry home to prepare the different cantons for a\r\nterrible internal struggle. Every appearance warranted this opinion. The\r\npriest of Stantz, Heinrich Imgrund, was one of those who most sincerely\r\nmourned this state of things. One day, when matters were at the worst,\r\nand the danger appeared most imminent, the worthy man took his\r\nwalking-staff, and proceeded to the Melchthal. It was in winter, the\r\nlast week of December, and the old priest made his way over the snow and\r\nice to the hermitage of the pious Nicholas of the Flue. There he\r\nhastened to lay before the good man the state of things in Stantz, and\r\nthe dangers that threatened their common country. The hermit, unlike\r\nmany of his recluse brethren, had not lost all interest in the higher\r\nevents of the world to which he belonged, and he determined that every\r\nmeans in his power should be employed to avert the impending evil. Early\r\non the morning of December 22d, 1481, the venerable man, now far\r\nadvanced in life, left his little cell on the rock, and bent his way\r\ntowards Stantz, and we may well believe that, as he went on his\r\npatriotic errand, earnest prayers were offered by him in behalf of his\r\nmisguided countrymen.\r\n\r\nArrived at Stantz, he proceeded immediately to the hall where the Diet\r\nwas in session. While yet without the walls, the stormy uproar and\r\nfierce discord of the assembly reached his ears. Hurrying his steps, the\r\nold man entered the hall. He had scarcely crossed the threshold, when\r\nhis venerable figure, aged face, and hoary locks, attracted general\r\nattention; in another instant he was known to be Nicholas of the Rock.\r\nAs if by instinctive impulse, the whole assembly rose to their feet.\r\nSeizing the moment of their respectful attention, the venerable man\r\naddressed them in earnest, fervent tones. There were those in the Diet\r\nto whom his voice was not strange; men, who in former years had known\r\nhim as the soldier and the patriot, while to all within the walls his\r\ncharacter for wisdom and sanctity was well known. Every eye was fixed\r\nupon his venerable countenance, every ear listened eagerly to the words\r\nwhich fell from his honored lips. It was a remarkable scene; a spectator\r\ncould never have credited that this was an authoritative assembly into\r\nwhich the hermit had presented himself unbidden; it seemed rather as if\r\nthat hall were the presence chamber of the wise and saintly man, and\r\ndeputies from far and near--knight, merchant, and peasant--had gathered\r\nabout him, and pressed forward to receive his judgment. With all the\r\neloquence of wisdom, and a heartfelt interest, the venerable man\r\naddressed the assembly. He implored, he warned, he admonished; he\r\nreminded them the interests of a whole nation were committed to their\r\nhands, and that for the powers with which they were intrusted they were\r\nnot responsible to man alone, but also to their Almighty Maker. Had they\r\nmet together like traitors, like madmen, to tear asunder the body\r\npolitic over which they were the appointed guardians? Where was the\r\ncalmness of deliberation with which a dignified assembly should meet to\r\nutter, and to listen? Was it to revile each other, to menace, that they,\r\ngrave and mature men, had come from the farthest limits of their common\r\ncountry? Such language as he had heard, such disorder as he had\r\nwitnessed when he first crossed that threshold, was it manly, was it\r\nhonorable, was it rational? He bade them pause, and tell him to what,\r\nunder Providence, they owed their present position as a free and\r\nindependent nation, respected by their neighbours. Every man there\r\npresent knew beyond all contradiction, that it was to their union they\r\nowed this great debt of glory and prosperity. Without union they never\r\ncould have attained to independence; without union they never could have\r\npreserved their freedom against one of the most powerful princes of\r\nEurope. And now, the very bond to which they and their fathers owed\r\nevery national blessing and individual safety, they stood ready, in a\r\nmoment of passion, to sever violently. He asked them if a national bond\r\nwere absolutely nothing, that they held it now so cheap? There were men,\r\nhe knew, in every land who held cheap each tie which bound them to their\r\nfellows--men who had no feeling for father, or brother, or son; but,\r\nthanks be to God, such was not the case with all. Most human hearts\r\ncould value every social bond, whether of family, kindred, or country.\r\nAnd what course would they take, should the evil work be accomplished?\r\nDid they expect to thrive better singly--each canton to face the world\r\nand all its manifold interests alone, or did they mean to cling\r\ntogether, a few here, a few there, one nation broken up into half a\r\ndozen nations? Did they expect that any future union could be closer and\r\ndearer than that which had already held together for generations men of\r\nthe same blood and language; men who had suffered and triumphed\r\ntogether? He warned them that if the evil spirit of disunion and strife\r\nwere now let loose and encouraged by themselves, they must not expect it\r\nto end its work to-day, to stop short at the very hour they required it\r\nto sleep again; like all other evil influences, it must either be\r\nchecked and controlled, or the fatal poison must spread farther and\r\nfarther, until it ended in utter anarchy and confusion. It is not for\r\nman, made of the dust of the earth, to rouse evil and accursed passions,\r\nand bid them go thus far and no farther. He implored them to let no\r\nnarrow, selfish, momentary interest blind them to interests immeasurably\r\nhigher, and more lasting. It remained for the men of that generation to\r\nsay whether the crisis should be a fatal one or not; it lay within their\r\npower to steer the ark of their country's hopes safely over a stormy\r\nsea, or purposely, deliberately, wilfully, to rush on the breakers,\r\nuntil that noble, honored fabric foundered for ever. Evil passions,\r\nsuspicion, envy, jealousy, wrath, had too often, in the history of the\r\nworld, worked out general, public misery: but he trusted there was yet\r\nwithin the bosom of their own people wisdom, patience, and moderation\r\nsufficient to carry them safely through the storm. He called upon every\r\ngood man, every honest man, who could rise superior to the selfishness\r\nof the race, to move and act in the blessed cause of peace and concord.\r\nHe advised them to look each at his own post and duty, and to meddle\r\nless with those of his neighbors; he implored them, for conscience'\r\nsake, not to be so ready with mutual suspicion and recrimination. He\r\nwarned them that whatever evils were to be remedied, the task must be\r\nundertaken calmly and dispassionately to be well done.\r\n\r\nThen proceeding to the subjects immediately under discussion, he\r\ncontinued: \"Let not the towns insist on claims which are injurious to\r\nthe old confederates. Let the rural cantons bear in mind how Soleure and\r\nFriburg fought by their side, and received them freely into the\r\nconfederacy. Beware of intrigues, confederates! Beware of discord! Far\r\nbe it for any to sacrifice his father-land for selfish interests of his\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man paused. The better intentioned of the deputies, who had been\r\nsilenced by the violence of their companions, pressed about him. He\r\nrepeated his counsels; he entered more particularly into the subjects of\r\ndispute; more and more gathered to the ranks of peace; and, in short, it\r\nis a matter of history that the earnest address of the good man worked\r\nan entire change in the temper of the Diet. In one hour's time the\r\ncountry was saved. It may be doubted whether there is on record, in the\r\nwhole course of history, so striking an instance of the influence of\r\ndisinterested wisdom upon a public assembly at a moment so critical.\r\nProbably, such an incident could only occur in a simple state of\r\nsociety, where legislative pride and legislative weakness had not made\r\nsuch rapid strides as in later times. Happily for Switzerland, the\r\nquestion was decided on the spot; during that same day's session every\r\nsubject under debate was peaceably settled. The confederacy was saved.\r\nFriburg and Soleure were received into the union. The venerable Nicholas\r\nhad proposed that territorial conquests should be shared according to\r\ncantons, and the other spoil according to the population; both questions\r\nwere immediately decided in accordance with this plan. Other points were\r\namicably settled; and, instead of a fatal rupture, a covenant was\r\nentered into, since called the \"Covenant of Stantz,\" by which the bonds\r\nof union were drawn closer. The deputies separated in a friendly temper,\r\nand the happy news of reconciliation spread rapidly through the quiet\r\nvalleys and busy towns, while from the Alps to the Jura, the bells of\r\ntown-house, church, and convent, poured forth over hill and dale their\r\ngrateful peal of national joy.\r\n\r\nTo the present day the Swiss thankfully recur to the 22d of December,\r\n1481, and the appeal of Nicholas von der Flue to the Diet of Stantz, as\r\na memorable epoch in their history. Certainly the incident is very\r\nremarkable, and almost without a parallel in history. To us of the\r\npresent day, when revolution and violence are rife, when invective and\r\naccusation form the common speech of public writers and public speakers,\r\nto us of these days of controversy the fact that the personal character\r\nand wisdom of one man should have pacified and influenced to such a\r\ndegree a stormy assembly, appears all but incredible.\r\n\r\nThe traveller who visits the canton of Unterwalden to-day finds its\r\nmountains sublime, its valleys beautiful, its waters limpid and living,\r\nas of old. It is a wholly pastoral region, and the smooth green meadows\r\nare thickly sprinkled with peasant homes, neat, cheerful, and peculiar,\r\nlike those of all Switzerland. The valley of the Melch is particularly\r\npopulous, its green pasture grounds protected by noble mountains, rising\r\non either side six or eight thousand feet towards the heavens, are\r\nclosely dotted with pretty cottages. Among these rustic dwellings, that\r\nonce inhabited by Nicholas Loewenbrugger is still shown. It is in good\r\npreservation, and much like those which surround it. Probably the\r\narchitecture, like the dress of the Swiss peasantry, has varied but\r\nlittle for generations. Several personal relics of the venerable man are\r\nalso preserved, and shown to the pilgrim traveller--these are two\r\nswords, a silver goblet, and a couple of wooden spoons. It is very\r\nprobable that they were in fact what they claim to have been, the\r\nproperty of the good man, for we, in this country of change, have little\r\nidea of the great care taken with family relics of this description in\r\nthe households of the old world. A chapel has been built near the cell\r\noccupied by the hermit; his tomb is at Sachslen, about a league from the\r\nvillage of Sarnen, in the principal church of the canton. Descendants of\r\nthe patriot are still living in Unterwalden, where his family long held\r\na very honorable position, and is well represented at the present day.\r\nBut those who boast of his own blood and name can scarcely claim a\r\ndeeper and more heartfelt veneration for his memory than that which is\r\nfelt throughout the whole confederacy. There is no name in Switzerland,\r\nnot even that of Tell, revered more highly than the name of Nicolas von\r\nder Flue. \"Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the\r\nchildren of God.\"\r\n\r\nProbably, if earnest efforts in behalf of concord, like those of the old\r\nhermit, were more frequently made, history would, on many occasions,\r\nshow less gloomy pictures than those which she now unfolds to the world.\r\nBut it is a singular fact that, generally, good men are more easily\r\ndisheartened, and, consequently, far less active in times of internal\r\ndisturbance than the selfish and intriguing. Surely this ought not to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY WITHOUT A NAME.[E]\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 346._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was very consoling. She was with Mrs. Hastings two or\r\nthree times in the week, and poor Mrs. Hastings required a considerable\r\ndegree of consolation; for the arrest of her husband, coming so close\r\nupon the bitter mortification of loss, and abatement of dignity, and at\r\nthe end of a long period of weak health, had made her seriously ill. She\r\nnow kept her bed the whole day long, and lay, making herself worse by\r\nthat sort of fretful anxiety which was constitutional with her as well\r\nas with many other people. Mrs. Hazleton's visits were a great comfort\r\nto her, and yet, strange to say, Emily almost always found her more\r\nirritable after that lady had left her.\r\n\r\nPoor Emily seemed to shine under the cloud of misfortune. Her character\r\ncame out and acted nobly in the midst of disasters. She was her mother's\r\nnurse and constant attendant; she kept her father informed of every\r\nthing that passed--not an opportunity was missed of sending him a\r\nletter; and although she would have made any sacrifice to be with him in\r\nprison, to comfort and support him in the peril and sorrow of his\r\nsituation, she was well satisfied that he had not taken her, when she\r\nfound the state into which her mother had fallen.\r\n\r\nOften, after Mrs. Hazleton had sat for an hour or two with her sick\r\nfriend, she would come down and walk upon the terrace for a while with\r\nEmily, and comfort her much in the same way that she did Mrs. Hastings.\r\nShe would tell her not to despond about her mother: that though she was\r\ncertainly very ill, and in a dangerous state, yet people had recovered\r\nwho had been quite as ill as she was. Then she would talk about lungs,\r\nand nerves, and humors, and all kinds of painful and mortal diseases, as\r\nif she had studied medicine all her life; and she did it, too, with a\r\nquiet, dignified gravity which made it more impressive and alarming.\r\nThen again, she would turn to the situation of Mr. Hastings, and wonder\r\nwhat they would do with him. She would also bring every bit of news that\r\nshe could collect, regarding the case of Sir John Fenwick, especially\r\nwhen the intelligence was painful and disastrous; but she hinted that,\r\nperhaps, after all, they might not be able to prove any thing against\r\nMr. Hastings, and that even if they did--although the Government were\r\ninclined to be severe--they might, perhaps, commute his sentence to\r\ntransportation for the colonies, or imprisonment in the Tower for five\r\nor six years.\r\n\r\nIt is thus our friends often console us; some of them, from a dark and\r\ngloomy turn of mind, and some of them from the satisfaction many people\r\nfeel in meddling with the miseries of others. But it was neither natural\r\ndespondency of character, nor any general love of sorrowful scenes or\r\nthoughts, that moved Mrs. Hazleton in the present instance. She had a\r\npeculiar and especial pleasure in the wretchedness of the Hastings\r\nfamily, and particularly in that of Emily. The charming lady fancied\r\nthat if Marlow were free from his engagement with Emily the next day,\r\nand a suitor for her own hand, she would never think of marrying him. I\r\nam not quite sure of that fact, but that is no business of ours, dear\r\nreader, and one thing is certain, that she would have very willingly\r\nsacrificed one half of her whole fortune, nay more, to have placed an\r\neverlasting barrier between Emily and Marlow.\r\n\r\nShe was thus walking with her dear Emily, as she called her, one day on\r\nthat terrace at the back of the house where the memorable conversation\r\nhad taken place between Mr. Hastings and Sir John Fenwick, and was\r\ntreating Emily to a minute and particular account of the death of the\r\nlatter, when Marlow suddenly arrived from London, and entered the house\r\nby the large glass door in front. He found a servant in the hall who\r\ninformed him that Mrs. Hastings was still in bed, and that Emily was\r\nwalking on the terrace with Mrs. Hazleton. Marlow paused, and considered\r\nfor a moment. \"Any thing not dishonorable,\" he said to himself, \"is\r\njustifiable to clear up such a mystery;\" and passing quietly through the\r\nhouse into the dining-room, which had one window opening as a door upon\r\nthe terrace, he saw his fair Emily and her companion pass along towards\r\nthe other end of the walk without being himself perceived. He then\r\napproached the window, and calculating the distances nicely, so as to be\r\nsure that Mrs. Hazleton was fully as far distant from himself as she\r\ncould have been from Sir John Fenwick and Mr. Hastings on the evening\r\nwhen they walked there together, he pronounced her name in an ordinary\r\ntone, somewhat lower than that which Mr. Hastings usually employed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton instantly started, and looked round towards the spot where\r\nMarlow was now emerging from the room.\r\n\r\nThe lady could not miss an occasion, and the moment she saw him she\r\nexclaimed, \"Dear me! there is Mr. Marlow; I am afraid he brings bad\r\ntidings, Emily.\"\r\n\r\nEmily paused not to consider, but with her own wild grace ran forward\r\nand cast herself into his arms.\r\n\r\nFortunately Mrs. Hazleton had no dagger with her. Her face was\r\nbenevolent and smiling when she joined them; for the joy there was upon\r\nEmily's countenance forbade any affectation of apprehension. It said as\r\nplainly as possible, \"All is well;\" but she added the words too,\r\nstretching forth her hand to her supposed friend, and saying, \"Dear Mrs.\r\nHazleton, Charles brings me word that my father is safe--that the\r\nGovernment have declared they will not prosecute.\"\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you with my whole heart, Emily,\" replied the lady; \"and\r\nI do sincerely hope that ministers may keep their word better in this\r\ninstance than they have done in some others.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not the slightest doubt of it, my dear madam,\" said Marlow;\r\n\"for I have the official announcement under the hand of the Secretary of\r\nState.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must fly and tell my mother,\" said Emily, and without waiting for a\r\nreply she darted away.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton took a turn or two up and down the terrace with Marlow,\r\nconsidering whether it was at all possible for her to be of any further\r\ncomfort to her friends at the Court. As she could not stay all night,\r\nhowever, so as to prevent Emily and Marlow from having any happy private\r\nconversation together and as she judged that, in their present joy, they\r\nwould a good deal forget conventional restraints, and give way to their\r\nlover-like feelings even in her presence, which would be exceedingly\r\ndisagreeable to her, she soon re-entered the house, and ordered her\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that both Emily and Marlow were well satisfied\r\nto see her depart, and it is not to be wondered at if they gave\r\nthemselves up for half an hour to the pleasure of meeting again.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that time, however, Marlow drew forth a letter from his\r\npocket, carefully folded, so that a line or two only was apparent, and\r\nplacing it before Emily, inquired if she knew the hand.\r\n\r\n\"It is mine,\" said Emily, at first; but the moment after she exclaimed\r\n\"No!--it is not; it is Mrs. Hazleton's. I know it by the peculiar way\r\nshe forms the _g_ and the _y_.--Stay, let me see, Marlow. She has not\r\ndone so always; but that _g_, and that _y_, I am quite certain of. Why\r\ndo you ask, Marlow?\"\r\n\r\n\"For reasons of the utmost importance, dear Emily,\" he answered, \"have\r\nyou any letters or notes of Mrs. Hazleton's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is one which came yesterday,\" replied Emily; \"it is lying on\r\nmy table up-stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring it--bring it, dearest girl,\" he said; \"I wish very much to see\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had got, he examined it with a well-pleased smile, and then\r\nsaid, with a laugh, \"I must impound this, my love. I am now on the right\r\ntrack, and will not leave it till I have arrived at perfect certainty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very strange and mysterious to-day, Marlow,\" said the beautiful\r\ngirl, \"what does all this mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means, my love,\" replied Marlow, \"that I have very dark doubts and\r\nsuspicions of Mrs. Hazleton,--and all I have seen and heard to-day\r\nconfirms me. Now sit down here by me, dear Emily, and tell me if, to\r\nyour knowledge, you have ever given to Mrs. Hazleton cause of offence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" answered Emily, firmly and at once. \"Never in my life.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow mused, and then, with his arms round her waist, he continued,\r\n\"Bethink yourself, my love. Within the course of the last two or three\r\nyears, have you ever seen reason to believe that Mrs. Hazleton's\r\naffection for you is not so great as it appears?--Has it ever\r\nwavered?--Has it ever become doubtful to you from any stray word or\r\naccidental circumstance?\"\r\n\r\nEmily was silent for a moment, and then replied, thoughtfully, \"Perhaps\r\nI did think so, once or twice, when I was staying at her house, last\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, now, dear Emily,\" said Marlow, \"tell me every thing down to\r\nthe most minute circumstance that occurred there.\"\r\n\r\nEmily hesitated. \"Perhaps I ought not,\" she said; \"Mrs. Hazleton showed\r\nme, very strongly, that I ought not, except under an absolute\r\nnecessity.\"\r\n\r\n\"That necessity is now, my love,\" replied Marlow; \"love cannot exist\r\nwithout confidence, Emily; and I tell you, upon my honor and my faith,\r\nthat your happiness, my happiness, and even your father's safety,\r\ndepends in a great degree upon your telling me all. Do you believe me,\r\nEmily?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fully,\" she answered; \"and I will tell you all.\"\r\n\r\nThus seated together, she poured forth the whole tale to her lover's\r\nears, even to the circumstances which had occurred in her own room, when\r\nMrs. Hazleton had entered it, walking in her sleep. The whole conduct of\r\nJohn Ayliffe, now calling himself Sir John Hastings, was also displayed;\r\nand the dark and treacherous schemes which had been going on, began\r\ngradually to evolve themselves to Marlow's mind. Obscure and indistinct\r\nthey still were; but the gloomy shadow was apparent, and he could trace\r\nthe outline though he could not fill up the details.\r\n\r\n\"Base, treacherous woman!\" he murmured to himself, and then, pressing\r\nEmily more closely to his heart, he thanked her again and again for her\r\nfrankness. \"I will never misuse it, my Emily,\" he said; \"and no one\r\nshall ever know what you have told me except your father: to him it must\r\nbe absolutely revealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would have told him myself,\" said Emily, \"if he had ever asked me any\r\nquestions on the subject; but as he did not, and seemed very gloomy just\r\nthen, I thought it better to follow Mrs. Hazleton's advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"The worst and the basest she could have given you,\" said Marlow; \"I\r\nhave had doubts of her for a long time, Emily, but I have no doubts now;\r\nand, moreover, I firmly believe that the whole case of this John\r\nAyliffe--his claim upon your father's estate and title--is all false and\r\nfactitious together, supported by fraud, forgery, and crime. Have you\r\npreserved this young man's letter, or have you destroyed it, Emily?\"\r\n\r\n\"I kept it,\" she replied, \"thinking that, some time or another, I might\r\nhave to show it to my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then one more mark of confidence, my love,\" said Marlow; \"let me have\r\nthat letter. I do not wish to read it; therefore you had better fold it\r\nup and seal it; but it may be necessary as a link in the chain of\r\nevidence which I wish to bring forward for your father's satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read it, if you will, Marlow,\" she answered; \"I have told you the\r\ncontents, but it may be as well that you should see the words: I will\r\nbring it to you in a moment.\"\r\n\r\nThey read the letter over together, and when Marlow had concluded, he\r\nlaid his hand upon it, saying, \"This is Mrs. Hazleton's composition.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm almost inclined to fancy so, myself,\" answered Emily.\r\n\r\n\"He is incapable of writing this,\" replied her lover; \"I have seen his\r\nletters on matters of business, and he cannot write a plain sentence in\r\nEnglish to an end without making some gross mistake. This is Mrs.\r\nHazleton's doing, and there is some dark design underneath it. Would to\r\nGod that visit had never taken place!\"\r\n\r\n\"There has been little happiness in the house since,\" said Emily,\r\n\"except what you and I have known together, Marlow; and that has been\r\nsadly checkered by many a painful circumstance.\"\r\n\r\n\"The clouds are breaking, dear one,\" replied Marlow, rising; \"but I will\r\nnot pause one moment in my course till all this is made clear--no, not\r\neven for the delight of sitting here by you, my love. I will go home at\r\nonce, Emily; mount my horse, and ride over to Hartwell before it be\r\ndark.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your object there?\" asked Emily.\r\n\r\n\"To unravel one part of this mystery,\" replied her lover. \"I will\r\nascertain, by some means, from whom, or in what way, this young man\r\nobtained sufficient money to commence and carry on a very expensive suit\r\nat law. That he had it not himself, I am certain. That his chances were\r\nnot sufficiently good, when first he commenced, to induce any lawyer to\r\ntake the risk, I am equally certain. He must have had it from some one,\r\nand my suspicions point to Mrs. Hazleton. Her bankers are mine, and I\r\nwill find means to know. So, now, farewell, my love; I will see you\r\nagain early to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe lingered yet for a moment or two, and then left her.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nMarlow was soon on horseback, and riding on to the country town. But he\r\nhad lingered longer with Emily than he imagined, and the day declined\r\nvisibly as he rode along.\r\n\r\n\"The business hours are over,\" he thought; \"bankers and lawyers will\r\nhave abandoned the money-getting and mischief-making toils of the day;\r\nand I must stay at the inn till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe had been riding fast; but he now drew in his rein, and suffered his\r\nhorse to walk. The sun was setting gloriously, and the rich, rosy light,\r\ndiffused through the air, gave every thing an aspect of warmth, and\r\nrichness, and cheerfulness. But Marlow's heart was any thing but gay.\r\nWhether it was that the scenes which he had passed through in London,\r\nhis visits to a prison, his dealings with hard official men, the\r\ntoiling, moiling crowds that had surrounded him; the wearisome, eternal,\r\nyet ever-changing struggle of life displayed in the streets and houses\r\nof a capital, the infinite varieties of selfishness, and folly, and\r\nvice, and crime, had depressed his spirits, or that his health had\r\nsomewhat suffered in consequence of anxious waiting for events in the\r\nfoul air of the metropolis, I cannot tell. But certain, he was sadder\r\nthan was usual with him. His was a spirit strong and active, naturally\r\ndisposed to bright views and happy hopes, too firm to be easily\r\ndepressed, too elastic to be long kept down. But yet, as he rode along,\r\nthere was a sort of feeling of apprehension upon his mind that oppressed\r\nhim mightily. He revolved all that had lately passed. He compared the\r\nstate of Mr. Hastings' family, as it actually was, with what it had been\r\nwhen he first knew it, and there seemed to be a strange mystery in the\r\nchange. It had then been all happiness and prosperity with that\r\nhousehold; a calm, grave, thoughtful, but happy father and husband; a\r\nbright, amiable, affectionate mother and wife; a daughter, to his mind\r\nthe image of every thing that was sweet, and gentle, and tender--of\r\nevery thing that was gay, and sparkling, and cheerful; full of light and\r\nlife, and fancy, and hope. Now, there was a father in prison, deprived\r\nof his greatest share of worldly prosperity, cast down from his station\r\nin society, gloomy, desponding, suspicious, and, as it seemed to him,\r\nhardly sane: a mother, irritable, capricious, peevish, yielding to\r\ncalamity, and lying on a bed of sickness, while the bright angel of his\r\nlove remained to nurse, and tend, and soothe the one parent, with a\r\nheart torn and bleeding for the distresses of the other. \"What have they\r\ndone to merit all this?\" he asked himself. \"What fault, what crime have\r\nthey committed to draw down such sorrows on their heads? None--none\r\nwhatever. Their lives had been spent in kindly acts and good deeds; they\r\nhad followed the precepts of the religion they professed; their lives\r\nhad been spent in doing service to their fellow-creatures, and making\r\nall happy around them.\"\r\n\r\nThen again, on the other hand, he saw the coarse, and the low, and the\r\nbase, and the licentious prosperous and successful, rising on the ruins\r\nof the pure and the true. Wily schemes and villanous intrigues obtaining\r\nevery advantage, and honesty of purpose and rectitude of action\r\nfrustrated and cast down.\r\n\r\nMarlow was no unbeliever--he was not even inclined to skepticism--but\r\nhis mind labored, not without humility and reverence, to see how it\r\ncould reconcile such facts with the goodness and providence of God.\r\n\r\n\"He makes the sun shine upon the just and the unjust, we are told,\" said\r\nMarlow to himself; \"but here the sun seems to shine upon the unjust\r\nalone, and clouds and tempests hang about the just. It is very strange,\r\nand even discouraging; and yet, all that we see of these strange,\r\nunaccountable dispensations may teach us lessons for hereafter--may give\r\nus the grandest confirmation of the grandest truth. There must be\r\nanother world, in which these things will be made equal--a world where\r\nthe wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. We only see\r\nin part, and the part we do not see must be the part which will\r\nreconcile all the seeming contradictions between the justice and\r\ngoodness of God and the course of this mortal life.\"\r\n\r\nThis train pursued him till he reached the town, and put up his horse at\r\nthe inn. By that time it was quite dark, and he had tasted nothing since\r\nearly in the morning. He therefore ordered supper, and the landlord, by\r\nwhom he was now well known--a good, old, honest, country landlord of the\r\nolden time--brought in the meal himself, and waited on his guest at\r\ntable. It was so much the custom of gentlemen, in those days, to order\r\nwine whenever they stopped at an inn--it was looked upon so much as a\r\nmatter of course that this should be done for the good of the\r\nhouse--that the landlord, without any direct commands to that effect,\r\nbrought in a bottle of his very best old sherry, always a favorite wine\r\nwith the English people, though now hardly to be got, and placed it by\r\nthe side of his guest. Marlow was by habit no drinker of much wine. He\r\navoided, as much as in him lay, the deep potations then almost universal\r\nin England; but, not without an object, he that night gave in to a\r\ncustom which was very common in England then, and for many years\r\nafterwards, and requested the landlord, after the meal was over, to sit\r\ndown, and help him with his bottle.\r\n\r\n\"You'll need another bottle, if I once begin, Master Marlow,\" said the\r\njolly landlord, who was a wag in his way.\r\n\r\nMarlow nodded his head significantly, as if he were prepared for the\r\ninfliction, replying quietly, \"Under the influence of your good chat,\r\nMr. Cherrydew, I can bear it, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's hearty,\" said the landlord, drawing a chair sideways to\r\nthe table; for his vast rotundity prevented him from approaching it full\r\nfront. \"Here's to your very good health, sir, and may you never drink\r\nworse wine, sit in a colder room, or have a sadder companion.\"\r\n\r\nNow I have said that Marlow did not invite the landlord to join him,\r\nwithout an object. That object was to obtain information, and it had\r\nstruck him even while the trout, which formed the first dish at his\r\nsupper, was being placed on the table, that he might be able, if\r\nwilling, to afford it.\r\n\r\nLandlords in England at that time--I mean, of course, in country\r\ntowns--were very different in many respects, and of a different class\r\nfrom what they are at present. In the first place, they were not fine\r\ngentlemen: in the next place, they were not discharged valets de\r\nchambre, or butlers, who, having cheated their masters handsomely, and\r\nperhaps laid them under contribution in many ways, retire to enjoy the\r\nfat things at their ease in their native town. Then, again, they were on\r\nterms of familiar intercourse with two or three classes, completely\r\nseparate and distinct from each other--a sort of connecting link between\r\nthem. At their door the justice of the peace, the knight of the shire,\r\nthe great man of the neighborhood, dismounted from his horse, and had\r\nhis chat with mine host. There came the village lawyer when he had\r\ngained a cause, or won a large fee, or had been paid a long bill, to\r\nindulge in his pint of sherry, and gossipped, as he drank it, of all the\r\naffairs of his clients. There sneaked in the Doctor to get his glass of\r\neau de vie, or plague water, or aqua mirabilis, or strong spirits, in\r\nshort of any other denomination, and tell little dirty anecdotes of his\r\ncases, and his patients. There the alderman, the wealthy shop-keeper,\r\nand the small proprietor, or the large farmer, came to take his cheerful\r\ncup on Saturdays or on market-day. But, besides these, the inn was the\r\nresort, though approached by another door, of a lower and a poorer\r\nclass, with whom the landlord was still upon as good terms as with the\r\nothers. The wagoner, the carter, the lawyer's and the banker's clerk,\r\nthe shopman, the porter even, all came there; and it mattered not to Mr.\r\nCherrydew or his confraternity, whether it was a bowl of punch, a\r\ndraught of ale, a glass of spirits, or a bottle of old wine that his\r\nguests demanded; he was civil, and familiar, and chatty with them all.\r\n\r\nThus under the rosy and radiant face of Mr. Cherrydew, and in that good,\r\nround, fat head, was probably accumulated a greater mass of information,\r\nregarding the neighborhood in which he lived, and all that went on\r\ntherein, than in any other head in the whole town, and the only\r\ndifficulty was to extract that part of the store which was wanted.\r\n\r\nMarlow knew that it would not do to approach the principal subject of\r\ninquiry rashly; for Mr. Cherrydew, like most of his craft, was somewhat\r\ncautious, and would have shut himself up in silent reserve, or enveloped\r\nhimself in intangible ambiguities, if he had known that his guest had\r\nany distinct and important object in his questions--having a notion that\r\na landlord should be perfectly cosmopolitan in all his feelings and his\r\nactions, and should never commit himself in such a manner as to offend\r\nany one who was, had been, or might be his guest. He was fond of\r\ngossipping, it is true, loved a jest, and was not at all blind to the\r\nridiculous in the actions of his neighbors; but habitual caution was in\r\ncontinual struggle with his merry, tattling disposition, and he was\r\ngenerally considered a very safe man.\r\n\r\nMarlow, therefore, began at a great distance, saying, \"I have just come\r\ndown from London, Mr. Cherrydew, and rode over, thinking that I should\r\narrive in time to catch my lawyer in his office.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all over now, sir, for the night,\" replied the landlord. \"In\r\nthis, two-legged foxes differ from others: they go to their holes at\r\nsunset, just when other foxes go out to walk. They divide the world\r\nbetween them, Master Marlow; the one preys by day, the other by\r\nnight.--Well, I should like to see Lunnun. It must be a grand place,\r\nsir, though somewhat of a bad one. Why, what a number of executions I\r\nhave read of there lately, and then, this Sir John Fenwick's business.\r\nWhy, he changed horses here, going to dine with Sir Philip, as I shall\r\ncall him to the end of my days. Ah, poor gentleman, he has been in great\r\ntrouble! But I suppose, from what I hear, he'll get clear now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond all doubt,\" said Marlow; \"the Government have no case against\r\nhim. But you say very true, Mr. Cherrydew, there has been a sad number\r\nof executions in London--seven and twenty people hanged, at different\r\ntimes, while I was there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the town no better,\" said Mr. Cherrydew.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said Marlow, \"were you not one of the jury at the trial of\r\nthat fellow, Tom Cutter?--Fill your glass, Mr. Cherrydew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.--Yes I was, to be sure,\" answered the landlord; \"and\r\nI'll tell you the funniest thing in the world that happened the second\r\nday. Lord bless you, sir, I was foreman,--and on the first day the judge\r\nsuffered the case to go on till his dinner was quite cold, and we were\r\nall half starved; but he saw that he could not hang him that night, at\r\nall events--here's to your health, sir!--so he adjourned the Court, and\r\ncalled for a constable, and ordered all of us, poor devils, to be locked\r\nup tight in Jones's public-house till the next day; for the jury-room is\r\nso small, that there is not standing-room for more than three such as\r\nme. Well, the other men did not much like it, though I did not\r\ncare,--for I had my boots full of ham, and a brandy-bottle in my\r\nbreeches-pocket. One of them asked the judge, for all his great black\r\neyebrows, if he could'nt go on that night; but his lordship answered,\r\nwith a snort like a cart horse, and told us to hold our tongues, and\r\nmind our own business, and only to take care and keep ourselves\r\ntogether. Well, sir, we had to walk up the hill, you know, and there was\r\nthe constable following us with his staff in his hand; so I had\r\ncompassion on my poor fellow-sufferers, and I whispered, first to one,\r\nthen to another, that this sort of jog would never do, but I would\r\nmanage to tell them how to have a good night's rest. You see, says I,\r\nhere's but one constable to thirteen people, so when you get to the\r\ncross-roads, let every man take up his legs and run, each his own way.\r\nHe can but catch one, and the slowest runner will have the chance. Now,\r\nI was the fattest of them all, you see, so that every one of them\r\nthought that I should be the man. Well, sir, they followed my advice;\r\nbut it's a different thing to give advice, and take it. No sooner did we\r\nget to the cross-roads, than they scattered like a heap of dust in the\r\nwind, some down the roads and lanes, some over the styles and gates,\r\nsome through the hedges. Little Sninkum, the tailor, stuck in the hedge\r\nby the way, and was the man caught, for he was afraid of his broadcloth;\r\nbut I stood stock still, with a look of marvellous astonishment, crying\r\nout, \"For God's sake catch them, constable, or what will my lord say to\r\nyou and me?\" Off the poor devil set in a moment, one man to catch\r\ntwelve, all over the face of the country. He thought he was sure enough\r\nof me; but what did I do? why, as soon as he was gone, I waddled home to\r\nmy own house, and got my wife to put me to bed up-stairs, and pass me\r\nfor my grandfather. Well, sir, that's not the best of it yet. We were\r\nall in Court next day at the right hour, and snug in the jury-box before\r\nthe judge came in; but I have a notion he had heard something of the\r\nmatter. He looked mighty hard at Sninkum, whose face was all scratched\r\nto pieces, and opening his mouth with a pop, like the drawing of a cork,\r\nhe said, \"Why, man, you look as if you and your brethren had been\r\nfighting!\" and then he looked as hard at me, and roared, \"I hope\r\ngentlemen, you have kept yourselves together?\" Thereupon, I laid my two\r\nhands upon my stomach, sir,--it weighs a hundred and a half, if it were\r\ncut off to-morrow, as I know to my cost, who carry it--and I answered\r\nquite respectful, \"I can't answer for the other gentlemen, my lord, but\r\nI'll swear I've kept myself together.\" You should have heard how the\r\nCourt rang with the people laughing, while I remained as grave as a\r\njudge, and much graver than the one who was there; for I thought he\r\nwould have burst before he was done, and a fine mess that would have\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\nSerious as his thoughts were, Marlow could not refrain from smiling; but\r\nhe did not forget his object, and remarked, \"There were efforts made to\r\nsave that scoundrel, and the present Sir John Hastings certainly did his\r\nbest for his friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call him John Ayliffe, sir, call him John Ayliffe,\" said the host.\r\n\"Here's to you, sir,--he's never called any thing else here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said Marlow, musingly, \"if there was any relationship\r\nbetween this Tom Cutter and John Ayliffe's mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a pin's point of it, sir,\" replied the landlord. \"They were just\r\ntwo bad fellows together; that was the connection between them, and\r\nnothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, John stood by his friend, at all events,\" said Marlow; \"though\r\nwhere he got the money to pay the lawyers in that case, or in his suit\r\nagainst Sir Philip, is a marvel to me.\"\r\n\r\nMine host winked his eye knowingly, and gave a short laugh.\r\n\r\nThat did not entirely suit Marlow's purpose, and he added in a musing\r\ntone, \"I know that he wanted to borrow ten pounds two or three months\r\nbefore, but was refused, because he had not repaid what he had borrowed\r\nof the same party, previously.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" said the landlord; \"there are secrets in all things. He\r\ngot money, and money enough, somehow, just about that time. He has not\r\nrepaid it yet, either, but he has given a mortgage, I hear, for the\r\namount; and if he don't mortgage his own carcase for it too, I am very\r\nmuch mistaken, before he has done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortgage his own carcase! I do not understand what you mean,\" replied\r\nMarlow. \"I am sure I would not give a shilling for that piece of earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"A pretty widow lady, not a hundred miles off, may think differently,\"\r\nreplied the landlord, grinning again, and filling his glass once more.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ha,\" said Marlow, trying to laugh likewise; \"so you think she\r\nadvanced the money, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite sure of it, sir,\" said Mr. Cherrydew, nodding his head\r\nprofoundly. \"I did not witness the mortgage, but I know one who did.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Shanks' clerk, I suppose,\" said Marlow.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, no,\" replied the landlord; \"Shanks did not draw the mortgage,\r\neither; for he was lawyer to both parties, and Mrs. Hazleton didn't like\r\nthat;--O, she's cute enough!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you must be mistaken,\" said Marlow, in a decided tone; \"for\r\nMrs. Hazleton assured me, when there was a question between herself and\r\nme, that she was not nearly as rich as she was supposed, and that if the\r\nlaw should award me back rents, it would ruin her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gammon, sir!\" replied the landlord, who had now imbibed a sufficient\r\nquantity of wine, in addition to sundry potations during the day. \"I\r\nshould not have thought you a man to be so easily hooked, Mr. Marlow;\r\nbut if you will ask the clerk of Doubledoo and Kay, who was down here,\r\nstaying three or four days about business, you'll find that she advanced\r\nevery penny, and got a mortgage for upwards of five thousand\r\npounds;--but I think we had better have that other bottle, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" said Marlow, and Mr. Cherrydew rolled away to fetch it.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, what was that clerk's name you mentioned?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sims, sir, Sims,\" said the landlord, drawing the cork; and then setting\r\ndown the bottle on the table, he added, with a look of great contempt,\r\n\"he's the leetlest little man you ever saw, sir, not so tall as my girl\r\nDolly, and with no more stomach than a currycomb, a sort of cross breed\r\nbetween a monkey and a penknife. He's as full of fun as the one, too,\r\nand as sharp as the other. He will hold a prodigious quantity of punch,\r\nthough, small as he is. I could not fancy where he put it all, it must\r\nhave gone into his shoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Mr. Cherrydew,\" said Marlow, laughing, \"do not speak\r\ndisrespectfully of thin people--I am not very fat myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord bless you, sir, you are quite a fine, personable man; and in time,\r\nwith a few butts, you would be as fine a man as I am.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow devoutly hoped not, but he begged Mr. Cherrydew to sit down\r\nagain, and do his best to help him through the wine he had brought; and\r\nout of that bottle came a great many things which Marlow wanted much\r\nmore than the good sherry which it contained.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o'clock in the day when Marlow returned to the Court,\r\nas it was called. The butler informed him that Miss Emily was not\r\ndown--a very unusual thing with her, as she was exceedingly matutinal in\r\nher habits; but he found, on inquiry, that she had sat up with her\r\nmother during the greater part of the night. Marlow looked at his watch,\r\nthen at the gravelled space before the house, where his own horse was\r\nbeing led up and down by his groom, and a stranger who had come with him\r\nwas sitting quietly on horseback, as if waiting for him. \"I fear,\" said\r\nMarlow, after a moment's musing, \"I must disturb your young lady. Will\r\nyou tell her maid to go up and inform her that I am here, and wish to\r\nspeak with her immediately, as I have business which calls me to London\r\nwithout delay.\" The man retired, and Marlow entered what was then called\r\nthe withdrawing room, walking up and down in thought. He had not\r\nremained many minutes, however, when Emily herself appeared, with her\r\nlooks full of surprise and anxiety. \"What is the matter, Marlow?\" she\r\nsaid. \"Has any new evil happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay, my love,\" said Marlow, embracing her tenderly. \"You must not\r\nlet the few ills that have already befallen you, my Emily, produce that\r\napprehensiveness which long years of evil and mischance but too often\r\nengender. Brighter days are coming, I trust, my love; so far from new\r\nevils having arisen, I have been very fortunate in my inquiries, and\r\nhave got information which must lead to great results. I must pursue the\r\nclue that has been afforded me without a moment's delay or hesitation;\r\nfor once the thread be broken I may have difficulty in uniting it again.\r\nBut if I judge rightly, my Emily, it will lead me to the following\r\nresults. To the complete exposure of a base conspiracy; to the\r\npunishment of the offenders; to the restoration of your father's\r\nproperty, and of his rank.\"\r\n\r\nHe held her hand in his while he spoke, and gazed into her beautiful\r\neyes; but Emily did not seem very much overjoyed. \"For my own part,\" she\r\nsaid, \"I care little as to the loss of property or station, Marlow, and\r\nstill less do I care to punish offenders; but I think my father and\r\nmother will be very glad of the tidings you give me. May I tell them\r\nwhat you say?\"\r\n\r\nMarlow mused for a moment or two. He was anxious to give any comfort to\r\nMrs. Hastings, but yet he doubted her discretion, and he replied, \"Not\r\nthe whole, dear Emily, except in case of urgent need. You may tell your\r\nmother that I think I have obtained information which will lead to the\r\nrestoration of your father's property, and you may assure her that no\r\neffort shall be wanting on my part to attain that object. Say that I am,\r\neven now, setting out for London for the purpose, and that I am full of\r\ngood hopes. I believe I can prove,\" he added, after a moment's\r\nconsideration, and in reality more to lead Mrs. Hastings away from the\r\nright track than from any other consideration, although the point he was\r\nabout to state was a fact, \"I believe I can prove that the missing leaf\r\nof the marriage register, which was supposed to have been torn out by\r\nyour grandfather's orders, was there not two years ago, and that I can\r\nshow by whose hands it was torn out at a much later date. Assure her,\r\nhowever, that I will do every thing in my power, and bid her be of good\r\nhope.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand the matter,\" answered Emily, \"and never heard of\r\nthis register, but I dare say my mother has, and will comprehend your\r\nmeaning better than I do. I know the very hope will give her great\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember one thing, however, dear Emily,\" replied Marlow, \"on no\r\naccount mention to her my suspicions of Mrs. Hazleton, nor show any\r\nsuspicions of that good lady yourself. It is absolutely necessary that\r\nshe should be kept in ignorance of our doubts, till those doubts become\r\ncertainties. However, in case of any painful and unpleasant\r\ncircumstances occurring while I am absent, I must leave these papers\r\nwith you. They consist of the note sent you by Mrs. Hazleton which you\r\nshowed me, a paper which I feel confident is in her handwriting, but\r\nwhich imitates your hand very exactly, and which has led to wrong\r\nimpressions, and the letter of young John Ayliffe--or at least that\r\nwhich he wrote under Mrs. Hazleton's direction. I have added a few words\r\nof my own, on a separate sheet of paper, stating the impression which I\r\nhave in regard to all these matters, and which I will justify whenever\r\nit may be needful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what am I to do with them?\" asked Emily, simply.\r\n\r\n\"Keep them safely, and ever at hand, dear girl,\" replied Marlow, in a\r\ngrave tone. \"You will find your father on his return a good deal\r\naltered--moody and dissatisfied. It will be as well for you to take no\r\nnotice of such demeanor, unless he expresses plainly some cause of\r\ndiscontent. If he do so--if he should venture upon any occasion to\r\nreproach you, my Emily--\"\r\n\r\n\"For what?\" exclaimed Emily, in utter surprise.\r\n\r\n\"It would be too long and too painful to explain all just now, dear\r\none,\" answered her lover. \"But such a thing may happen, my Emily.\r\nDeceived, and in error, he may perhaps reproach you for things you never\r\ndreamt of. He may also judge wrongly of your conduct in not having told\r\nhim of this young scoundrel's proposal to you. In either case put that\r\npacket of papers in his hands, and tell him frankly and candidly every\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is sometimes so reserved and grave,\" said Emily, \"that I never like\r\nto speak to him on any subject to which he does not lead the way. I\r\nsometimes think he does not understand me, Marlow, and dread to open my\r\nwhole heart to him, as I would fain do, lest he should mistake me still\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let no dread stop you in this instance, my own dear girl,\" Marlow\r\nanswered. \"That there have been dark plots against you, Emily, I am\r\ncertain. The only way to meet and frustrate them is to place full and\r\nentire confidence in your father. I do not ask you to speak to him on\r\nthe subject unless he speaks to you, till I have obtained the proofs\r\nwhich will make all as clear as daylight. Then, every thing must be\r\ntold, and Sir Philip will find that had he been more frank himself he\r\nwould have met with no want of candor in his daughter. Now, one more\r\nkiss, dear love, and then to my horse's back.\"\r\n\r\nI will not pursue Marlow's journey across the fair face of merry\r\nEngland, nor tell the few adventures that befell him on the way, nor the\r\neager considerations that pressed, troop after troop, upon his mind,\r\nneither will I dwell long upon his proceedings in London, which occupied\r\nbut one brief day. He went to the house of his banker, sought out the\r\nlittle clerk of Messrs. Doubledoo and Kay, and contrived from both to\r\nobtain proof positive that Mrs. Hazleton had supplied a large sum of\r\nmoney to young John Ayliffe to carry on his suit against Sir Philip\r\nHastings. He also obtained a passport for France, and one or two letters\r\nfor influential persons in Paris, and returning to the inn where he had\r\nleft the man who had accompanied him from the country, set out for\r\nCalais, without pausing even to take rest himself. Another man, a clerk\r\nfrom his own lawyer's house, accompanied him, and though the passage was\r\nsomewhat long and stormy, he reached Calais in safety.\r\n\r\nJourneys to Paris were not then such easy things as now. Three days\r\npassed ere Marlow reached the French capital, and then both his\r\ncompanions were inclined to grumble not a little at the rapidity with\r\nwhich he travelled, and the small portion of rest he allowed them or\r\nhimself. In the capital, however, they paused for two days, and,\r\nfurnished with an interpreter and guide, amused themselves mightily,\r\nwhile Marlow passed his time in government offices, and principally with\r\nthe lieutenant of police, or one of his commissaries.\r\n\r\nAt length the young gentleman notified his two companions that they must\r\nprepare to accompany him at nine o'clock in the morning to St. Germain\r\nen Laye, where he intended to reside for some days. A carriage was at\r\nthe door to the moment, and they found in it a very decent and\r\nrespectable gentleman in black, with a jet-hilted sword by his side, and\r\na certain portion of not very uncorrupt English. The whole party jogged\r\non pleasantly up the steep ascent, and round the fine old palace, to a\r\nsmall inn which was indicated to the driver by the gentleman in black,\r\nfor whom that driver seemed to entertain a profound reverence. When\r\ncomfortably fixed in the inn, Marlow left his two English companions,\r\nand proceeded, as it was the hour of promenade, to take a walk upon the\r\nterrace with his friend in black. They passed a great number of groups,\r\nand a great number of single figures, and Marlow might have remarked, if\r\nhe had been so disposed, that several of the persons whom they met\r\nseemed to eye his companion with a suspicious and somewhat anxious\r\nglance. All Marlow's powers of observation, however, were directed in a\r\ndifferent way. He examined every face that he saw, every group that he\r\ncame near; but at length, as they passed a somewhat gayly dressed woman\r\nof the middle age, who was walking alone, the young Englishman touched\r\nthe arm of the man in black, saying, \"According to the description I\r\nhave had of her, that must be very like the person.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will follow her, and see,\" said the man in black.\r\n\r\nWithout appearing to notice her particularly, they kept near the lady\r\nwho had attracted their attention, as long as she continued to walk upon\r\nthe terrace, and then followed her when she left it, through several\r\nstreets which led away in the direction of the forest. At length she\r\nstopped at a small house, opened the door, and went in.\r\n\r\nThe man in black took out a little book from his pocket, closely written\r\nwith long lists of names.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur et Madame Jervis,\" he said, after having turned over several\r\npages. \"Here since three years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"That cannot be she, then,\" answered Marlow.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, stay,\" said his companion, \"that is _au premier_. On the second\r\nfloor lodges Monsieur Drummond. Old man of sixty-eight. He has been here\r\ntwo years; and above Madame Dupont, an old French lady whom I know quite\r\nwell. You must be mistaken, Monsieur, but we will go into this\r\n_charcutier's_ just opposite, and inquire whether that is Madame Jervis\r\nwho went in.\"\r\n\r\nIt proved to be so. The pork butcher had seen her as she passed the\r\nwindow, and Marlow's search had to begin again. When he and his\r\ncompanion returned to their inn, however, the man whom he had brought up\r\nfrom the country met him eagerly, saying, \"I have seen her, sir! I have\r\nseen her! She passed by here not ten minutes ago, dressed in weeds like\r\na widow, and walking very fast. I would swear to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ho,\" said the man in black, \"we will soon find her now,\" and\r\ncalling to the landlord, who was as profoundly deferential towards him\r\nas the coachman had been, he said in the sweetest possible tone, \"Will\r\nyou have the goodness to let Monsieur Martin know that the _bon homme\r\ngrivois_ wishes to speak with him for a moment?\"\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful with what rapidity Monsieur St. Martin, a tall, dashing\r\nlooking personage, with an infinite wig, obeyed the summons of the _bon\r\nhomme grivois_.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, _bon jour_, St. Martin,\" said the man in black.\r\n\r\n\"_Bon jour, Monsieur_,\" replied the other, with a profound obeisance.\r\n\r\n\"A lady of forty--has been handsome, fresh color, dark eyes, middle\r\nheight, hair brown, hardly gray,\" said the man in black. \"Dressed like\r\nan English widow, somewhat common air and manner, has come here within a\r\nyear. Where is she to be found, St. Martin?\"\r\n\r\nThe other, who had remained standing, took out his little book, and\r\nafter consulting its pages diligently, gave a street and a number.\r\n\r\n\"What's her name?\" asked the man in black.\r\n\r\n\"Mistress Brown,\" replied Monsieur St. Martin.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said the man in black, \"but we must wait till to-morrow morning,\r\nas it is now growing dark, and there must be no mistake; first, lest we\r\nscare the real bird in endeavoring to catch one we don't want, and next,\r\nlest we give annoyance to any of his Majesty's guests, which would\r\nreduce the king to despair.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at an early hour, the party of four proceeded to the\r\nstreet which had been indicated, discovered the number, and then entered\r\na handsome hotel, inhabited by an old French nobleman. The man in black\r\nseemed unknown to either the servants or their master, but a very few\r\nwords spoken in the ear of the latter, rendered him most civil and\r\naccommodating. A room in the front of the house, just over that of the\r\nporter, was put at the disposal of the visitors, and the man who had\r\naccompanied Marlow from the country was placed at the window to watch\r\nthe opposite dwelling. It was a balmy morning, and the house was near\r\nthe outskirts of the town, so that the fresh air of the country came\r\npleasantly up the street. The windows of the opposite house were,\r\nhowever, still closed, and it was not till Marlow and his companions had\r\nbeen there near three quarters of an hour, that a window on the first\r\nfloor was opened, and a lady looked out for a moment, and then drew in\r\nher head again.\r\n\r\n\"There she is!\" cried the man who was watching, \"there she is, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite certain?\" asked the man in black.\r\n\r\n\"Beyond all possible doubt, sir,\" replied the other. \"Lord bless you, I\r\nknow her as well as I know my own mother. I saw her almost every day for\r\nten years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said the man in black, \"I will go over first alone,\r\nand as soon as I have got in, you, Monsieur Marlow, with these two\r\ngentlemen, follow me thither. She won't escape me when once I'm in, but\r\nthe house may have a back way, and therefore we will not scare her by\r\ntoo many visitors at this early hour.\"\r\n\r\nHe accordingly took his departure, and Marlow and his companions saw him\r\nring the bell at the opposite house. But the suspicion of those within\r\nfully justified the precautions he had taken. Before he obtained\r\nadmission, he was examined very narrowly by a maid-servant from the\r\nwindow above. It is probable that he was quite conscious of this\r\nscrutiny, but he continued quietly humming an opera air for a minute or\r\ntwo, and then rang the bell again. The door was then opened. He entered,\r\nand Marlow and his companions ran across, and got in before the door was\r\nshut. The maid gave a little scream at the sudden ingress of so many\r\nmen, but the gentleman in black told her to be silent, to which she\r\nreplied, \"Oh, Monsieur, you have cheated me. You said you wanted\r\nlodgings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, my child,\" replied the man, \"but the lodgings which I want\r\nare those of Madame Brown, and you will be good enough to recollect that\r\nI command all persons, in the king's name, now in this house, to remain\r\nin it, and not to go out on any pretence whatever till they have my\r\npermission. Lock that door at the back, and then bring me the key.\"\r\n\r\nThe maid, pale and trembling, did as she was commanded, and the French\r\ngentleman then directed the man who had accompanied Marlow to precede\r\nthe rest up the stairs, and enter the front room of the first floor. The\r\nothers followed close, and as soon as the door of the room was open, it\r\nwas evident that the lady of the house had been alarmed by the noise\r\nbelow; for she stood looking eagerly towards the top of the stairs, with\r\ncheeks very pale indeed. At the same moment that this sight was\r\npresented to them, they heard the man who had gone on exclaim in\r\nEnglish, \"Ah, Mistress Ayliffe, how do you do? I am very glad to see\r\nyou. Do you know they said you were dead--ay, and swore to it.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ayliffe's mother sank down in a seat, and hid her face with her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nMarlow could not be hard-hearted with a woman, and he felt for the\r\nterrible state of agitation and alarm, to which John Ayliffe's mother\r\nwas reduced.\r\n\r\n\"We must be gentle with her,\" he said in French to the Commissary of\r\nPolice, who was with him, and whom we have hitherto called the man in\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n\"_Oui, monsieur_,\" replied the other, taking a pinch of snuff, and\r\nperfectly indifferent whether he was gentle or not,--for the Commissary\r\nhad the honor, as he termed it, of assisting at the breaking of several\r\ngentlemen on the wheel, to say nothing of sundry decapitations,\r\nhangings, and the question, ordinary and extraordinary, all of which\r\nhave a certain tendency, when witnessed often, slightly to harden the\r\nhuman heart, so that he was not tender.\r\n\r\nMarlow was approaching to speak to the unfortunate woman, when removing\r\nher hands from her eyes, she looked wildly round, exclaiming, \"Oh! have\r\nyou come to take me, have you come to take me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That must depend upon circumstances, madam,\" replied Marlow, in a quiet\r\ntone. \"I have obtained sufficient proofs of the conspiracy in which your\r\nson has been engaged with yourself and Mr. Shanks, the attorney, to\r\njustify me in applying to the Government of his most Christian Majesty\r\nfor your apprehension and removal to England. But I am unwilling to deal\r\nat all harshly with you, if it can be avoided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! pray don't, pray don't!\" she exclaimed vehemently; \"my son will\r\nkill me, I do believe, if he knew that you had found me out; for he has\r\ntold me, and written to me so often to hide myself carefully, that he\r\nwould think it was my fault.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is his own fault in ordering your letters to him to be sent to the\r\nSilver Cross at Hartwell,\" replied Marlow. \"Every body in the house knew\r\nthe handwriting, and became aware that you were not dead, as had been\r\npretended. But your son will soon be in a situation to kill nobody; for\r\nthe very fact of your being found here, with the other circumstances we\r\nknow, is sufficient to convict him of perjury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he'll lose the property and the title, and not be Sir John any\r\nmore,\" said the unhappy woman.\r\n\r\n\"Beyond all doubt,\" replied Marlow. \"But to return to the matter before\r\nus; my conduct with regard to yourself must be regulated entirely by\r\nwhat you yourself do. If you furnish me with full and complete\r\ninformation in regard to this nefarious business, in which I am afraid\r\nyou have been a participator, as well as a victim, I will consent to\r\nyour remaining where you are, under the superintendence of the police,\r\nof which this gentleman is a Commissary.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I have been a victim, indeed,\" answered Mrs. Ayliffe, weeping. \"I\r\ndeclare I have not had a moment's peace, or a morsel fit to eat since I\r\nhave been in this outlandish country, and I can hardly get any body, not\r\neven a servant girl, who understands a word of English, to speak to.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow thought that he saw an inclination to evade the point of his\r\nquestions, in order to gain time for consideration, and the Commissary\r\nthought so too: though both of them were, I believe, mistaken; for\r\ncollaterality, if I may use such a word, was a habit of the poor woman's\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe Commissary interrupted her somewhat sharply in her catalogue of the\r\nmiseries of France, by saying, \"I will beg you to give me your keys,\r\nmadame, for we must have a visitation of your papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"My keys, my keys!\" she said, putting her hands in the large pockets\r\nthen worn. \"I am sure I do not know what I have done with them, or where\r\nthey are.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, we will soon find keys that will open any thing,\" replied the\r\nCommissary. \"There are plenty of hammers in St. Germain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, stay a moment,\" said Marlow; \"I think Mrs. Ayliffe will save us\r\nthe trouble of taking any harsh steps.\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, don't; I will do any thing you please,\" she said, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, madame,\" said Marlow, \"will you have the goodness to state\r\nto this gentleman, who will take down your words, and afterwards\r\nauthenticate the statement, what is your real name, and your ordinary\r\nplace of residence in England?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, and he added more sternly, \"You may answer or not, as you\r\nlike, madame; we have proof by the evidence of Mr. Atkinson here, who\r\nhas known you so many years, that you are living now in France, when\r\nyour son made affidavit that you were dead. That is the principal point;\r\nbut at the same time I warn you, that if you do not frankly state the\r\ntruth in every particular, I must demand that you be removed to\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will indeed,\" she said, \"I will indeed;\" and raising her eyes to the\r\nface of the Commissary, of whom she seemed to stand in great dread, she\r\nstated truly her name and place of abode, adding, \"I would not, indeed I\r\nwould not have taken a false name, or come here at all, if my son had\r\nnot told me that it was the only way for him to get the estate, and\r\npromised that I should come back directly he had got it. But now, he\r\nsays I must remain here forever, and hide myself;\" and she wept\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, the Commissary continued to write actively, putting\r\ndown all she said. She seemed to perceive that she was committing\r\nherself, but, as is very common in such cases, she only rendered the\r\ndifficulties worse, adding, in a low tone, \"After all, the estate ought\r\nto have been his by right.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you think so, madame,\" replied Marlow, \"you had better return to\r\nEngland, and prove it; but I can hardly imagine that your son and his\r\nsharp lawyer would have had recourse to fraud and perjury in order to\r\nkeep you concealed, if they judged that he had any right at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, he might have a right in the eyes of God,\" replied the unhappy\r\nwoman, \"not in the eyes of the law. We were as much married before\r\nheaven as any two people could be, though we might not be married before\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, you and your husband,\" said the Commissary in an\r\ninsinuating tone.\r\n\r\n\"I and Mr. John Hastings, old Sir John's son,\" she answered; and the\r\nCommissary drawing Marlow for a moment aside, conversed with him in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nWhat they said she could not hear, and could not have understood had she\r\nheard, for they spoke in French; but she grew alarmed as they went on,\r\nevidently speaking about her, and turning their eyes towards her from\r\ntime to time. She thought they meditated at least sending her in custody\r\nto England, and perhaps much worse. Tales of bastiles, and dungeons, and\r\nwringing confessions from unwilling prisoners by all sorts of tortures,\r\npresented themselves to her imagination, and before they had concluded,\r\nshe exclaimed in a tone of entreaty, \"I will tell all, indeed I will\r\ntell all, if you will not send me any where.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Commissary thinks, madame,\" said Marlow, \"that the first thing we\r\nought to do is to examine your papers, and then to question you from the\r\nevidence they afford. The keys must, therefore, be found, or the locks\r\nmust be broken open.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they may be in that drawer,\" said Mrs. Ayliffe, pointing across\r\nto an escrutoire; and there they were accordingly found. No great search\r\nfor papers was necessary; for the house was but scantily furnished, and\r\nthe escrutoire itself contained a packet of six or seven letters from\r\nJohn Ayliffe to his mother, with two from Mr. Shanks, each of them\r\nending with the words \"_read and burn_;\" an injunction which she had\r\nreligiously failed to comply with. These letters formed a complete\r\nseries from the time of her quitting England up to that day. They gave\r\nher information of the progress of the suit against Sir Philip Hastings,\r\nand of its successful termination by his withdrawing from the defence.\r\nThe first letters held out to her, every day, the hope of a speedy\r\nreturn to England. The later ones mentioned long fictitious\r\nconsultations with lawyers in regard to her return, and stated that it\r\nwas found absolutely necessary that she should remain abroad under an\r\nassumed name. The last letter, however, evidently in answer to one of\r\nremonstrance and entreaty from her, was the most important in Marlow's\r\neyes. It was very peremptory in its tone, asked if she wanted to ruin\r\nand destroy her son, and threatened all manner of terrible things if she\r\nsuffered her retreat to be discovered. As some compensation, however,\r\nfor her disappointment, John Ayliffe promised to come and see her\r\nspeedily, and secure her a splendid income, which would enable her to\r\nkeep carriages and horses, and \"live like a princess.\" He excused his\r\nnot having done so earlier, on the ground that his friend Mrs. Hazleton\r\nhad advanced him a very large sum of money to carry on the suit, which\r\nhe was obliged to pay immediately. The letter ended with these words,\r\n\"She is as bitter against all the Hastings' as ever; and nothing will\r\nsatisfy her till she has seen the last of them all, especially that\r\nsaucy girl; but she is cute after her money, and will be paid. As for my\r\npart, I don't care what she does to Mistress Emily; for I now hate her\r\nas much as I once liked her,--but you will see something there, I think,\r\nbefore long.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Heaven,\" exclaimed Marlow, as he read that letter, \"what\r\ncan have possessed the woman with so much malice towards poor Emily\r\nHastings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, John used always to think,\" said Mistress Ayliffe, with a weak\r\nsmile coming upon her face in the midst of her distress, \"that it was\r\nbecause Madame Hazleton wanted to marry a man about there, called\r\nMarlow, and Mistress Emily carried him off from her.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissary laughed, and held out his snuff-box to Marlow, who did\r\nnot take the snuff, but fell into a deep fit of thought, while the\r\nCommissary continued his perquisitions.\r\n\r\nOnly two more papers of importance were found, and they were of a date\r\nfar back. The one fresh, and evidently a copy of some other letter, the\r\nother yellow, and with the folds worn through in several places. The\r\nformer was a copy of a letter of young John Hastings to the unfortunate\r\ngirl whom he had seduced, soothing her under her distress of mind, and\r\ncalling her his \"dear little wife.\" It was with the greatest difficulty\r\nshe could be induced to part with the original, it would seem, and had\r\nobtained a copy before she consented to do so. The latter was the\r\nantidote to the former. It was a letter from old Sir John Hastings to\r\nher father, and was to the following effect:\r\n\r\n     \"Sir:\r\n\r\n     \"As you have thought fit distinctly to withdraw all vain and\r\n     fraudulent pretences of any thing but an illicit connection\r\n     between your daughter and my late son, and to express\r\n     penitence for the insolent threats you used, I will not\r\n     withhold due support from my child's offspring, nor from the\r\n     unfortunate girl to whom he behaved ill. I therefore write\r\n     this to inform you that I will allow her the sum of two\r\n     hundred pounds per annum, as long as she demeans herself\r\n     with propriety and decorum. I will also leave directions in\r\n     my will for securing to her and her son, on their joint\r\n     lives, a sum of an equal amount, which may be rendered\r\n     greater if her behavior for the next few years is such as I\r\n     can approve.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                       \"JOHN HASTINGS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMarlow folded up the letter with a smile, and the Commissary proceeded,\r\nwith all due formalities, to mark and register the whole correspondence\r\nas found in the possession of Mrs. Ayliffe.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done, what may be called the examination of that good lady\r\nwas continued, but the sight of those letters in the hands of Marlow,\r\nand the well-satisfied smile with which he read them, had convinced her\r\nthat all farther attempt at concealment would be vain. Terror had with\r\nher a great effect in unloosing the tongue, and, as is very common in\r\nsuch cases, she flew into the extreme of loquacity, told every thing she\r\nknew, or thought, or imagined, and being, as is common with very weak\r\npeople, of a prying and inquisitive turn, she could furnish ample\r\ninformation in regard to all the schemes and contrivances by which her\r\nson had succeeded in convincing even Sir Philip Hastings himself of his\r\nlegitimacy.\r\n\r\nHer statements involved Mr. Shanks the lawyer in the scheme of fraud as\r\na principal, but they compromised deeply Mrs. Hazleton herself as\r\ncognizant of all that was going on, and aiding and abetting with her\r\npersonal advice. She detailed the whole particulars of the plan which\r\nhad been formed for bringing Emily Hastings to Mrs. Hazleton's house,\r\nand frightening her into a marriage with John Ayliffe; and she dwelt\r\nparticularly on the tutoring he had received from that lady, and his\r\nfrantic rage when the scheme was frustrated. The transactions between\r\nhim and the unhappy man Tom Cutter she knew only in part; but she\r\nadmitted that her son had laughed triumphantly at the thought of how Sir\r\nPhilip would be galled when he was made to believe that his beloved\r\nEmily had been to visit her young reprobate son at the cottage near the\r\npark, and that, too, at a time when he had been actually engaged in\r\npoaching.\r\n\r\nAll, in fact, came forth with the greatest readiness, and indeed much\r\nmore was told than any questions tended to elicit. She seemed indeed to\r\nhave now lost all desire for concealment, and to found her hopes and\r\nexpectations on the freest discovery. Her only dread, apparently, being\r\nthat she might be taken to England, and confronted with her son. On this\r\npoint she dwelt much, and Marlow consented that she should remain in\r\nFrance, under the supervision of the police, for a time at least, though\r\nhe would not promise her, notwithstanding all her entreaties, that she\r\nshould never be sent for. He endeavored, however, to obviate the\r\nnecessity of so doing, by taking every formal step that could be devised\r\nto render the evidence he had obtained available in a court of law, as\r\ndocumentary testimony. A magistrate was sent for, her statements were\r\nread over to her in his presence by the commissary of police, and though\r\nit cannot be asserted that either the style or the orthography of the\r\nworthy commissary were peculiarly English, yet Mrs. Ayliffe signed them,\r\nand swore to them in good set form, and in the presence of four\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nTo Marlow, the scene was a very painful one; for he had a natural\r\nrepugnance to seeing the weakness and degradation of human nature so\r\npainfully exhibited by any fellow-creature, and he left her with\r\nfeelings of pity, but still stronger feelings of contempt.\r\n\r\nAll such sensations, however, vanished when he reached the inn again,\r\nand he found himself in possession of evidence which would clear his\r\nbeloved Emily of the suspicions which had been instilled into her\r\nfather's mind, and which he doubted not in the least would effect the\r\nrestoration of Sir Philip Hastings to his former opulence and to his\r\nstation in society.\r\n\r\nThe mind of man has a sun in its own sky, which pours forth its\r\nsunshine, or is hidden by clouds, irrespective of the atmosphere around.\r\nIn fact we always see external objects through stained glass, and the\r\nhues imparted are in our windows, not in the objects themselves. It is\r\nwonderful how different the aspect of every thing was to the eyes of\r\nMarlow as he returned towards Paris, from that which the scene had\r\npresented as he went. All seemed sunshine and brightness, from the\r\nhappiness of his own heart. The gloomy images, which, as I have shown,\r\nhad haunted him on his way from his own house to Hartwell--the doubts,\r\nif they can be so called--the questionings of the unsatisfied heart in\r\nregard to the ways of Providence--the cloudy dreads which almost all men\r\nmust have felt as to the real, constant, minute superintendence of a\r\nSupreme Power being but a sweet vision, the child of hope and\r\nveneration, were all dispelled. I do not mean to say that they were\r\ndissipated by reason or by thought, for his was a strong mind, and\r\nreason and thought with him were always on the side of faith; but those\r\nclouds and mists were suddenly scattered by the success which he had\r\nobtained, and the cheering expectation which might be now well founded\r\nupon that success. It was not enough for him that he knew, and\r\nunderstood, and appreciated to the full the beauty and excellence of his\r\nEmily's character. He could not be contented unless every one connected\r\nwith her understood and appreciated it also. He cared little what the\r\nworld thought of himself, but he would have every one think well of her,\r\nand the deepest pang he had perhaps ever felt in life had been\r\nexperienced when he first found that Sir Philip Hastings doubted and\r\nsuspected his own child. Now, all must be clear--all must be bright. The\r\nbase and the fraudulent will be punished and exposed, the noble and the\r\ngood honored and justified. It was his doing; and as he alighted from\r\nthe carriage, and mounted the stairs of the hotel in Paris, his step was\r\nas triumphant as if he had won a great victory.\r\n\r\nFate will water our wine, however--I suppose lest we should become\r\nintoxicated with the delicious draught of joy. Marlow longed and hoped\r\nto fly back to England with the tidings without delay, but certain\r\nformalities had to be gone through, official seals and signatures\r\naffixed to the papers he had obtained, in order to leave no doubt of\r\ntheir authenticity. Cold men of office could not be brought to\r\ncomprehend or sympathize with his impetuous eagerness, and five whole\r\ndays elapsed before he was able to quit the French capital.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[E] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by G.

The _Examiner_ says they\r\nbring out with marked prominence his abhorrence of the Scotch, his\r\nbitter dislike of Johnson, and the men of genius connected with him, his\r\nuneasy contempt for Chesterfield and Lyttleton, his impatience of\r\nGarrick's popularity, and his better founded scorn of Cumberland and his\r\nclique. We do not mention his studied injustice to Chatterton, because\r\nin this there was not a little natural resentment of as great an\r\ninjustice to himself on the part of poor Chatterton's upholders; but\r\nperhaps nothing is more painfully impressed on all the letters than his\r\nmonstrous persistence in the refusal of all merit to the most\r\ndistinguished writers of his time who did not happen to belong to his\r\nset. Let the reader remember that within a few years before these\r\nletters, and during their continuance, all the writings of Sterne had\r\nbeen produced, and all the writings of Goldsmith; that Johnson had\r\npublished _Rasselas_ and the _Idler_, the edition of _Shakspeare_, the\r\n_Dictionary_, and the _Lives of the Poets_; that Smollett had given _Sir\r\nLancelot Greaves_ and _Humphrey Clinker_ to the world; that the first\r\npublication of Lady Mary Wortley Montague's letters had taken place;\r\nthat Percy had published his _Reliques_, Reid his _Inquiry_, and Hume\r\nhis immortal _History_; that the most important portion of the _Decline\r\nand Fall_ had appeared, and that the theatres could boast of the farces\r\nof Foote and the comedies of Goldsmith, Colman, and Sheridan. Yet here\r\nis all that Walpole can say of it!\r\n\r\n     \"What a figure will this our Augustan age make! Garrick's\r\n     prologues, epilogues, and verses, Sir W. Chambers's\r\n     Gardening, Dr. Nowel's Sermon, Whittington and his Cat, Sir\r\n     John Dalrymple's History and Life of Henry II. What a\r\n     library of poetry, taste, good sense, veracity, and\r\n     vivacity! Ungrateful Shebbear! indolent Smollett! trifling\r\n     Johnson! piddling Goldsmith! how little have they\r\n     contributed to the glory of a period in which all arts, all\r\n     sciences are encouraged and rewarded! Guthrie buried his\r\n     mighty genius in a review, and Mallet died of the first\r\n     effusions of his loyalty. The retrospect makes one\r\n     melancholy, but Ossian has appeared, and were Paradise once\r\n     more lost, we should not want an epic poem!\"\r\n\r\nWe take other passages from the letters exhibiting the same spirit--now\r\nsimply entertaining:\r\n\r\n     \"Dr. Goldsmith has written a comedy--no, it is the lowest of\r\n     all farces, it is not the subject I condemn, though very\r\n     vulgar, but the execution. The drift tends to no moral, no\r\n     edification of any kind--the situations, however, are well\r\n     imagined, and make one laugh in spite of the grossness of\r\n     the dialogue, the forced witticisms, and total improbability\r\n     of the whole plan and conduct. But what disgusts me most is,\r\n     that though the characters are very low, and aim at low\r\n     humor, not one of them says a sentence that is natural or\r\n     marks any character at all. It is set up in opposition to\r\n     sentimental comedy, and is as bad as the worst of them.\r\n     Garrick would not act it, but bought himself off by a poor\r\n     prologue.\r\n\r\n     \"You will be diverted to hear that Mr. Gibbon has quarrelled\r\n     with me. He lent me his second volume in the middle of\r\n     November. I returned it with a most civil panegyric. He came\r\n     for more incense, I gave it, but alas! with too much\r\n     sincerity, I added, 'Mr. Gibbon, I am sorry you should have\r\n     pitched on so disgusting a subject as the Constantinopolitan\r\n     history. There is so much of the Arians and Eunomians, and\r\n     semi-Pelagians; and there is such a strange contrast between\r\n     Roman and Gothic manners, and so little harmony between a\r\n     Consul Sabinus and a Ricimer, Duke of the Palace, that\r\n     though you have written the story as well as it could be\r\n     written, I fear few will have patience to read it.' He\r\n     colored; all his round features squeezed themselves into\r\n     sharp angles; he screwed up his button-mouth, and rapping\r\n     his snuff-box, said, \"It had never been put together\r\n     before'--'so well,' he meant to add, but gulped it. He meant\r\n     'so well,' certainly, for Tillemont, whom he quotes in every\r\n     page, has done the very thing. Well, from that hour to this,\r\n     I have never seen him, though he used to call once or twice\r\n     a week: nor has sent me the third volume, as he promised. I\r\n     well knew his vanity, even about his ridiculous face and\r\n     person, but thought he had too much sense to avow it so\r\n     palpably.\r\n\r\n     \"I have read Sheridan's Critic, but not having seen it, for\r\n     they say it is admirably acted, it appeared wondrously flat\r\n     and old, and a poor imitation; it makes me fear I shall not\r\n     be so much charmed with the School for Scandal, on reading,\r\n     as I was when I saw it.\"\r\n\r\nThere is of course no denying that these attempts to make \"small beer\"\r\nof the Gibbons, Humes, Goldsmiths, Johnsons, Smolletts, and other\r\nspirits already secure and serene among the immortals, however amusing\r\nin themselves, become mighty ridiculous by the side of as perpetual\r\npraise of the writer's own clique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT MONTE-LEONE: OR, THE SPY IN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE FROM THE FRENCH OF H.\r\nDE ST. GEORGES.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 357._\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--ON PAROLE.\r\n\r\nThree days after the night upon which the father and son had knocked at\r\nthe door of No. 7 Rue de Menors, another scene occurred. It was ten\r\no'clock. The Prince had not appeared at dinner. Confined by a slight\r\nindisposition to his room, he sent an excuse to his daughter-in-law. The\r\nPrince was respectful as far as possible to Aminta, looking on her as\r\nhead of the family and mistress of the household. The Countess of\r\nGrandmesnil had embroidered away a portion of the day, contradicted her\r\nniece, admired her nephew, commented on the last sermon of the Abbe de\r\nRozan on worldly pleasures, contriving therein to insert various\r\nbitter-sweet allusions to Aminta. Finally the Countess left the room.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis and Marquise were then alone together. After her discovery\r\nof the nocturnal absence of Henri, and especially after the reading of\r\nthe fatal note in which an appointment was made with the Marquis, Aminta\r\nfelt a sadness which she could not overcome. Too proud to reproach him,\r\nor suffer him to discover her sorrow, divided between unextinguished\r\nlove and deep mortification, Aminta lived in perpetual constraint,\r\nbiding her grief and humiliation under a false tranquillity, the\r\nrecompense for which she found in solitary tears. The Marquis seemed ill\r\nat ease. He had for some days been as moody as possible. His absence\r\nbecame every day more frequent, and the sudden departure of the Countess\r\nmade his situation very annoying to both of them. Not a word was said\r\nfor some moments. Henri sat with his eyes fixed on a paper, though he\r\ndid not read, and Aminta convulsively twisted between her fingers a kind\r\nof work which just then was fashionable. Her eyes however occasionally\r\nstrayed to her husband's face, on which they rested with anxiety. As she\r\nthus examined him, the features of Henri finally assumed such an\r\nexpression of despair that Aminta could not repress her sorrow, and\r\nsaid, \"What _is_ the matter? are you in pain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? not at all! I am well--very well,\" said the Marquis. \"I have\r\nsomething of importance to attend to,\" and he added, as he looked at\r\nthe clock, \"I am already rather late.\"\r\n\r\nAminta, in a supplicating tone, said, \"Henri, once the most important\r\nbusiness of your life was to be with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The business which calls me out is by no means as pleasant as that\r\nwould be.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I thought so,\" said Aminta--\"for the needle of jealousy had\r\nentered her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Aminta,\" said Maulear, looking at her, \"what is the matter? what do you\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I am afraid I have lost the greatest blessing of life in a\r\nmarriage like ours, and that, when my confidence in you is lost,\r\nhappiness is gone for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why have you lost it?\" said Maulear.\r\n\r\n\"You have yourself destroyed it. You, whom I thought so frank--you, in\r\nthe oaths of whom I had confidence--for whom I abandoned my mother and\r\nmy country,\" said she, with tears. \"You, against whose love I contended,\r\nfor I was afraid I would not be happy, or rather that you would not be.\r\nAlas! I am now sure of this. Your coldness, your indifference, your\r\nabandonment, tell me so more distinctly than your tongue could. Yet I\r\nhad rather you should say so, for there would at least be boldness in\r\nthe confession, while meanness is the element of dissimulation.\"\r\n\r\nThe head of the poor young woman fell on her shoulder, and she shed\r\nbitter tears.\r\n\r\n\"Aminta,\" said Henri, as he drew near and sought to take her hand, \"I\r\nswear that I have not deceived you.\"\r\n\r\nAminta looked towards him with a countenance lighted up with joy, but a\r\nfrightful thought, the recollection of the letter, pierced her heart\r\nlike an arrow.\r\n\r\n\"He deceives me,\" said she, and she felt herself blush for the man who\r\ndid not blush himself, though he was committing perjury. The door of the\r\nroom was then opened, and the Prince de Maulear entered. He was pale and\r\nagitated, though he had a smile on his lips. The smile, however, was\r\ncold and evidently studied. \"You are about to go out, Marquis,\" said he,\r\npointing to the hat which the latter had in his hand, without appearing\r\nto remark either the trouble of Henri or the tears of Aminta.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Monsieur, but I have an important appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry for your appointment,\" said the Prince, \"but you must break\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" muttered Henri.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will,\" said the Prince, but his manner implied, \"you must.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" said the Marquis, putting down his hat and gloves,\r\nwith marked ill humor, \"I obey you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince paid no further attention to him, but placed a chair near\r\nAminta, sat beside her, and pointing out a chair to the Marquis, bade\r\nhim do so also.\r\n\r\n\"We thought you unwell,\" said the Marquise to her father-in-law, making\r\nan effort to restrain herself. \"We are glad to see it is not the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"For three days,\" said the Prince, \"I have not felt well. Too long a\r\nwalk for a person of my age, and some important affairs have fatigued\r\nboth my body and mind. I therefore determined to pass this evening\r\ncalmly and quietly with you--with my family. I do not,\" said he,\r\nspeaking to Henri, \"expect it will be gay, but we cannot make a holiday\r\nall the time. We must sometimes be calm, and reflect. You, my daughter,\"\r\nsaid he to Aminta, \"may be sure I will do all I can to aid you. I know\r\nyou like to hear my old stories, but if you did not, and it were\r\nunpleasant to you, you would bear with me. I am about to tell you a long\r\none.\" The Marquis and the Marquise listened to the Prince with surprise.\r\nThe tone of this preamble seemed to them so foreign to the ordinary\r\nlanguage and habits of the Prince, that they began to see something\r\nstranger even than the piquant anecdotes and traditions he delighted in\r\nnarrating. \"This story is a revelation of a story I long doubted whether\r\nor not I should confide to you. Its avowal cannot but be painful to me,\r\nand a man does not like to blush before his children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do so, then, my father?\" said Henri.\r\n\r\n\"Because I wish to, monsieur,\" said the Prince sternly. \"Because in the\r\ncourse of his life man must suffer, when its suffering is good in its\r\neffects, because thereby he may punish evil, and do his duty.\" The young\r\ncouple looked at the Prince with terror, for his brow was moody, and on\r\nhis lips--across which irony, gayety, and sarcasm so often played--there\r\nwere now the marks of anger, menace, and indignation.\r\n\r\nThe old man spoke thus: \"After leaving Mettan, whither I had followed\r\nthe Princess, I went to Naples in 1792. Like almost all the _emigres_ of\r\nthat day, I had no money. One of the first Frenchmen I met with in that\r\ncity was Count Max de Nangis, with whom I had previously become\r\nacquainted in the strangest manner. We had been educated by the\r\nBenedictines, but our scholastic success was most unequal; for the Count\r\nsaw me regularly surpass him, and carry away every college prize. He\r\nnaturally disliked me. When we had entered society, our whimsical hate\r\ncontinued,--so that I seemed born to be the evil genius of the Count. If\r\nour horses were entered for the same stake, mine won the purse;\r\nsometimes by a length or a head only--but they won. If the Count fell in\r\nlove, he did so with a woman that loved me, and the Count was soon sent\r\nadrift. My marriage soon capped the climax. Count Max had a charming\r\ncousin, Mlle. de Devonne, whom he loved passionately. Their marriage had\r\nbeen quietly agreed on between the families, and was to be solemnized on\r\nthe majority of M. de Nangis. I was introduced to the Duke de Devonne,\r\nand saw his daughter, the most beautiful woman of the Court. After a\r\nshort time I became passionately in love with her. I soon saw that my\r\nlove was returned, and as the marriage to which I have referred had only\r\nbeen a matter of family-talk, known to a few friends, but not to the\r\npublic, my father induced the Dauphin to ask the Duke de Nangis for his\r\ndaughter's hand for me. Unwilling to offend the Prince, led astray by\r\nthe manifest interest of his daughter, and anxious to gratify her, the\r\nDuke consented. The Count de Nangis was enraged, and challenged me;--I\r\nwounded him in the arm. We fought again;--I wounded him in the thigh. He\r\nchallenged me again; and I run him through the body; he was forced to be\r\nsatisfied. All these duels took place in the county of _Saluces_, in\r\nSavoy,--then belonging to my family, and whither I had gone to attend to\r\nbusiness-matters. I married Mlle. de Devonne, who was your noble and\r\nexcellent mother,\"--this was said to Henri, \"I have told you this to\r\nexplain the hatred which had existed so long a time in the heart of M.\r\nde Nangis, when we met at Naples, in 1792. The first months of my\r\nsojourn were sad and solitary. Too proud to inform any one of the nature\r\nof my sufferings, I lived retired; and, except a few countrymen as poor\r\nas I was, saw no one. This was easy enough; for I had brought no letter\r\nof recommendation to the eminent people of that capital, in which I made\r\nsuch a bad figure, and amid which I was isolated. This life made one of\r\nmy habits and tastes suffer cruelly. A painful circumstance, however,\r\nmortified my self-love, and increased my humiliation,--the Count de\r\nNangis then was 'the observed of all observers,' in Naples. More prudent\r\nor more fortunate than I, he saved large sums of money from the tempest\r\nwhich overwhelmed all the large fortunes of France. He had a number of\r\nservants, and in luxury and magnificence equalled the wealthiest persons\r\nof the city. Notwithstanding my anxiety to avoid him, I met him\r\nfrequently, and I saw in his expression a kind of disdain and contempt\r\nwhich wounded me to the soul. One day, when I was more desperate than\r\never, I received a letter from France, and in it a check for fifty\r\nthousand livres, which the Countess of Grandmesnil had sent me.\r\nIntoxicated with joy, I hastened to get possession of this money, and\r\ncareless of the future, forgot this would be the only sum I should\r\nreceive for a long time, or perhaps would ever receive. I indulged in\r\nmad extravagance, took a carriage, and three days afterwards presented\r\nmyself at various noble houses, where my rank and title procured me a\r\nready reception. I saw M. de Nangis; we met in the same rooms, amid\r\npeople of high rank, and there was no trace of our old differences. I\r\nfancied, though, that the Count exhibited a secret spite at my recovery\r\nof fortune, which he thought more stable than it really was. At this\r\ntime people in Naples played high. The palace of Prince Leta was every\r\nnight filled with rich strangers, and with the principal nobles of\r\nNaples. Over his tables, loaded with gold, they played all night long. I\r\nwas taken to Prince Leta's, where a strange idea took possession of me.\r\nI fancied that I might, without danger or risk, increase my revenue, and\r\nprobably triple the poor sum I had been fortunate to receive. I played,\r\nand my good fortune did not desert me; at first I won with the strangest\r\ngood fortune. My daring increased, and I made some bold bets, which were\r\nsuccessful; so that in the course of a few evenings I won three hundred\r\nthousand francs.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Marquis glittered with strange light, as he heard his\r\nfather speak thus. The Prince did not seem to observe it, and\r\ncontinued--\r\n\r\n\"Chance led me into a room where the Count de Nangis also was--he too\r\nplayed. Remembering how my fortune had always seemed to surpass his, and\r\nall the victories I had won at his expense, I could not refrain from\r\nsecretly pitying him for the fate which had again brought him into\r\ncontact with me, and which led him again to contend with one who had\r\nuniformly triumphed over and beaten him in fortune, love, and war. We\r\nbegan to play--the Count betting high, and I following his example. The\r\ngame was something between faro and lansquenet, now completely\r\nforgotten, having been replaced by _ecarte_.\" The Prince saw his son\r\ntremble at the mention of the last game; for a few moments he paused,\r\nand then continued--\r\n\r\n\"The first games were unfortunate for me; I lost--I doubled the stakes,\r\nand lost again. At the conclusion of the evening my hundred thousand\r\ncrowns were reduced to a hundred thousand francs. I returned home\r\ncompletely overpowered, but less stupefied at my own losses than at the\r\nsuccess of my rival, who heretofore had been so unfortunate. On the next\r\nday I sent to M. de Nangis, before noon, the fifty thousand francs I\r\nowed him--on the previous evening I had on my person only fifty thousand\r\nfrancs with me. That night we met again at Prince Leta's. The game\r\nbegan--there were many spectators. I won ten thousand francs, and smiled\r\nconfidently at the change of fortune. It soon, however, changed once\r\nmore.--When the clock struck twelve I was ruined! 'On my honor!' said\r\nthe Count, 'I have sought for ten years to contend with you, Prince. If\r\ngold could indemnify me for all the losses you have caused me, confess\r\nthat, to-day, we are even.' My heart was ready to burst with rage, and I\r\nwas ready to insult him. 'We will not stop here, I hope,' said M. de\r\nNangis; 'and I wish to have more of your money; provided I have fifty\r\nthousand francs of yours, I ask nothing more of the god Plutus.'\r\n\r\n\"A terrible contest then took place in my mind. To confess that I had no\r\nmore money--that I was ruined, seemed impossible; a miserable false\r\npride prevented me. Should I, however, go on, and contract a debt which\r\nI could not discharge? 'Prince,' said the Count, pushing ten notes of a\r\nthousand francs towards me, 'ten thousand francs more I wish to lose,\r\nand something tells me that luck is about to turn.' The devil spoke to\r\nme through the mouth of man. '_On parole_,' said I, 'for I have no money\r\nwith me.' '_Pardieu_, said the Count, 'people like ourselves never have\r\nmore than fifty thousand francs in our pocket-books. _Parole_ is our\r\ncash, and none but citizens and bankers, who are loaded with gold like\r\nmules in Guatemala, have any thing else. Your word is good for five\r\nhundred thousand francs, and I will take it for cash.' I felt an icy\r\ncoldness run through my veins and stop at my very heart. I played again,\r\nand again I lost and won again. An hour afterwards I owed sixty thousand\r\nfrancs to the Count de Nangis. 'What is the matter?' said he ironically,\r\n'are you ill.' 'The heat,' said I, rising, 'is excessive; and if you\r\nplease we will stop here.' 'As you please,' said the Count; 'and\r\nto-morrow you shall have your revenge.' 'To-morrow, then, be it,' said\r\nI. My head was hot, yet a cold perspiration stood on my brow; my sight\r\nbecame troubled, my legs quailed, and I saw before me the terrible\r\nspectacle of dishonor. He at last had his enemy in his power, and was\r\nabout to doom him to infamy. Two words seemed written before my eyes,\r\nand by their aspect terrified me. Those two words contained all I had to\r\nfear and apprehend--they were worse to me than death. These words were a\r\ncontract of honor, a sacred article in even the gambler's code. These\r\nwords had been pronounced by the Count as he pushed his money towards\r\nme: they were '_on parole_.' I went to my hotel--for I had not yet left\r\nthe modest room I had inhabited while a more comfortable suite was being\r\nprepared--and gave way to despair. 'My name disgraced!' cried I, 'the\r\nname of the Prince de Maulear, which has been pure and honored for so\r\nmany centuries, made vile and disgraced by a miserable debt of sixty\r\nthousand francs, a sum once scarcely to be considered as a fraction of\r\nthe revenues of my family!' There was no one by to aid me--no one to\r\nwhom I could own my fault, my remorse, and my despair. Day came, and the\r\nhorror of my situation increased as the fatal hour drew near. Unable to\r\nresist this frightful torment I said, 'No! I will not live dishonored; I\r\nwill not bear a disgraced, shameful, and dishonored life.' I went to the\r\ntable and wrote: 'I owe to the Count de Nangis the sum of 60,000 francs,\r\nfor which I bequeath him all the profits ever likely to accrue to me\r\nfrom my property in France. Here, when I am about to die, I enjoin my\r\nson to discharge this debt of honor by every means in his power.' I then\r\ntook my pistols, loaded and cocked them--now be bold for one moment, and\r\nspare yourself years of shame and disgrace!--I placed one of the pistols\r\nwith the muzzle at my heart, and the other in my mouth. I was about to\r\npull the trigger when I heard a noise. The partition which divided me\r\nfrom the next room was shattered, and through the opening thus made, I\r\nsaw a man, pale and agitated. This person advanced towards we with a\r\npocket-book in his hands. 'Stop,' said he, 'here is what you owe--this\r\npocket-book contains sixty thousand livres.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--THE GAMBLER.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Maulear continued his story. Aminta timidly looked at her\r\nfather-in-law with painful emotion, for she knew how he must suffer in\r\nmaking such a confession. The Marquis seemed to suffer under increasing\r\ndiscomfort and terror.\r\n\r\n\"At the sudden and almost supernatural apparition of this stranger, who\r\nthus rose before me, the weapons fell from my hands, and as I was unable\r\nto speak, I made use of my eyes to question him.\r\n\r\n\"'I was there,' said the man, pointing to the chamber whence he had\r\nburst so suddenly; 'I have not lost one of the words you have uttered\r\nsince your return--I have watched every moment, the long and cruel agony\r\nof your soul. You have revealed yourself to me, your name, your family,\r\nyour isolated hopes, and your isolation in this city. I have seen your\r\ndespair hourly increase, until, but for me, you would have reached the\r\nclimax. Monsieur,' continued he, with a tone full of religion and\r\nsensibility, 'make this day the happiest of my life by enabling me to\r\nsave one of my fellows.'\r\n\r\n\"'One of your fellows, Monsieur? alas I am not such, for if I estimate\r\nyou according to your actions, you are a man of honor and heart, while\r\nI....'\r\n\r\n\"'You,' said he, interrupting me, 'you are like what you think me, a man\r\nof honor and heart. The proof that such is the case is, that, unable to\r\nbear the consequences of a moment of weakness, you were about to die to\r\navoid the consequences of that error. Monsieur de Maulear,' continued\r\nthe stranger, and he took my hand with touching kindness, 'permit me to\r\nrestore you to life and happiness, for you have a family perhaps, and\r\nchildren, and cannot abandon all thus. Listen to me,' said he, as he saw\r\nme refuse the pocket-book he offered me; 'I had a father who was one of\r\nthe noblest and best of men. He died many months ago, and my tears tell\r\nyou how I regret him. I know that he is in heaven and blesses me for\r\nwhat I do now, for thus he would have done. The money I offer you is a\r\npart of his fortune, and I am sure I appropriate it as he would wish me.\r\nTo refuse this, Monsieur, would be to exhibit ingratitude to Providence,\r\nwhich has evidently watched over you, in permitting me to hear and\r\ninduce you to pause.'\r\n\r\n\"'But,' said I, with deep emotion, 'you do not know me, and such a\r\nservice....'\r\n\r\n\"'Have I not told you,' said he, 'that in your sorrow you told me all.\r\nDo not, however, think I wish to be useful without a condition. I exact\r\none, and you will excuse me for making it the consideration of what I\r\npropose to do.'\r\n\r\n\"'What is it?' said I. 'You can exact any thing from man as the price of\r\nhis honor.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, swear to me that you will never play again.'\r\n\r\n\"'I do, I do!' said I. 'I pledge my faith not to.'\r\n\r\n\"'Take this pocket-book then,' said the stranger. It is now ten o'clock,\r\nand debts of honor should always be paid before noon.'\r\n\r\n\"'But your name, at least, I should know, Monsieur, before I take your\r\ngold.'\r\n\r\n\"'An insignificant one, which derives its only merit from the virtues of\r\nhim who transmitted it to me. My name is Luigi Rovero.'\"\r\n\r\n\"My father,\" said the Marquise, \"my father, was it he who....\"\r\n\r\nShe paused from a sentiment of respect and delicacy to the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"This, however, is not the only benefit he conferred on me. From the\r\neffects of the emotion I had undergone, a horrible illness seized me,\r\nand during this malady of long days and endless nights of suffering, my\r\nnew friend never left me. A crisis ensued; for three days my life was in\r\ndanger, and depended on the precision with which a certain remedy was\r\nadministered to me. For three days and nights he watched me without one\r\nminute of repose, and he not only restored my honor but preserved my\r\nlife. Rovero was a very brother to me, and I passed a whole year at\r\nNaples, living with him and never leaving him. A few months after I was\r\nable to discharge my pecuniary obligation to him--my debt of honor was\r\nbeyond my capacity. Here is the portrait of the person who was so dear\r\nto me,\" said the Prince, and he took from his pocket a magnificent gold\r\nbox on which was a miniature set with diamonds. \"Look at it, my\r\ndaughter,\" said he, \"and observe the noble face yours so often recalls\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\nAminta kissed the portrait, and Henri, then remembering the picture\r\nwhich Signora Rovero had shown him on his second visit to Sorrento,\r\nexplained his surprise when he saw it, for he had often seen the box and\r\nthe magnificent portrait.\r\n\r\n\"Plans, prejudices, pride, and family pride,\" said the Prince, \"my\r\nchild, disappeared, as you know, when I heard the words 'The daughter of\r\nRovero.' Rovero was my savior and brother. From that moment I understood\r\nthat in the far-away skies, he besought me to discharge my debt towards\r\nhim, and to prove the extent of my gratitude. I understood that he would\r\nhave bequeathed his daughter to me, to become my own; therefore, when I\r\nopened my arms you became my child, and since then my love for you has\r\ncontinually increased. When I took charge of your life, my daughter, I\r\ntook charge of your happiness, which I thought secured for ever. For\r\nsome time, though, you have shed tears in secret--do not tell me no,\"\r\nsaid the Prince, as he saw Aminta make a motion of negation. \"I have\r\nstudied you closely, and one cannot deceive a father's heart--I am your\r\nfather. Monsieur,\" said the Prince, turning towards his son, \"now you\r\nknow why I love your wife. You see that her sorrows are mine, and that\r\nher tears melt my heart. For two months you have distressed and made her\r\nweep over your neglect and indifference, the fatal secret of which I\r\nknow and intend to tell her.\"\r\n\r\nHenri quivered with fear.\r\n\r\n\"Father, for pity's sake, do not....\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the Prince, \"had you blushed earlier you would not do\r\nso now.\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter,\" said he, pointing to the Marquise who bent before him;\r\n\"your husband is not false to you, but he is a gamester.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he has not deceived me,\" said the young woman. With an emotion she\r\ncould not restrain, she rushed into the arms of the Marquis. For some\r\nmoments the Prince looked at her with deep emotion, for Aminta forgave\r\nand pardoned all in one who had not betrayed her. Then the Prince\r\ncontinued sadly--\r\n\r\n\"Do not rejoice so soon, my child; gaming is the instigator of all\r\nvices, and has led him so far as to _risk his honor without the means of\r\nredeeming his parole_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the Prince to his son, \"I have told you a terrible\r\nstory, to prove to what abasement the passion for gaming can reduce a\r\nman. That abasement you are in danger of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, if you knew the temptation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do--for three days ago your mysterious life was revealed to me. In\r\nthe circle to which you belong, in one of those societies formed to\r\ndivide and interfere with domestic life--where persons go in search of a\r\nliberty and after a license they do not find at home--in that place, led\r\nastray by morbid self-esteem, you played for the first time. What, in a\r\nman of your rank, should have been a mere amusement, a fugitive\r\npleasure, became a serious business. You played to win, or rather to\r\nrepair your losses. In the saloons of Paris you were constantly at the\r\necarte tables, that cursed game, the chances of which have ruined so\r\nmany persons. Thanks to it, you won immense sums from young Lord Elmore,\r\nat the last ball of M. L----, which you lost again in the more doubtful\r\nhouse of Mme. Fanny de Bruneval, where you had an appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, father! then he went to that woman's house to play?\" said Aminta,\r\nalmost involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"What else should he go for to the house of a dowager of fifty, who\r\nreceives all sorts of people, and where every thing is suspicious, from\r\nher guests to the very cards they use? This very night, in consequence\r\nof information received from me, that elegant abode will be examined by\r\nthe police most scrupulously. That,\" said the Prince, \"is one of the\r\nreasons why I have prevented my son from going thither. Now, Monsieur,\"\r\nsaid the Prince, \"make an explanation of the state of your funds. You\r\nhad six hundred thousand francs from your mother, you have expended two\r\nhundred thousand in furniture, horses, carriages, articles of luxury,\r\nand presents to your wife. With the expenditure of this money I have no\r\nfault to find, for you cannot estimate too highly the angel Heaven has\r\nsent you. Then you had four hundred thousand francs. You have realized\r\nthis money, and during the last two months have lost the sum of three\r\nhundred and ninety thousand francs. This evening, Monsieur, you were\r\nabout to tempt fortune with the ten thousand francs now in your\r\npossession. Is not this the exact state of your affairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Monsieur, it is cruel to say all this before the Marquise.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a hundred times less cruel than the suspicion to which you\r\nabandon her. Did you not see just now that instead of reproaching the\r\ngamester who had ruined her, she experienced only a tender emotion for\r\nthe husband she loved? Henri,\" continued the Prince, taking his son's\r\nhand in his own, \"when I told you how once in my life I had erred, when\r\nI confessed to you a fault which yet makes my cheek blush, I sought to\r\nmake you pause on the abyss into which you were near plunging. In\r\ntelling you this secret I deprived myself of the right of severity to\r\nyou. When, in a letter I wrote to you at Naples, I spoke lightly of a\r\nloss at cards I had undergone, I did not doubt that some day I would be\r\nobliged to tell you all that had taken place. I was wrong, however, in\r\nforbidding you to beware of what I had spoken of; for I should have\r\nknown that there are passions, like other diseases, which a father\r\ntransmits to his children. The body, like the soul, inherits them. I\r\nhowever pardon and forget all I have mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nHenri clasped the old man's hand, and Aminta kissed the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said the latter, \"only pardon you on the terms imposed on me\r\nby my generous friend Rovero. You will swear to me, on your honor, that\r\nyou will never play again, and I will confide in you as he did in me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do swear,\" said the Marquis, \"and will die if I ever break my oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now listen to me, my children,\" said the Prince, kindly; \"I have a\r\nhundred thousand francs a year--I will allow you fifty. A similar sum\r\nsatisfies me. To protect you, however, from all temptations to\r\nextravagance, I give you the income and not the capital, and as a reward\r\nof my indulgence, as a recompense of my courage in making the confession\r\nof a great error of my life, make your wife happy, reward her by\r\ntenderness for the care you have subjected her to, for the uneasiness\r\nshe has known, and my heart will be gratified for the bliss she will owe\r\nyou, as something to discharge my debt to her father.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince clasped his children to his heart and left. While this was\r\noccurring at the Hotel de Maulear, a storm overhung the hospitable roof\r\nof Mme. Fanny de Bruneval. This house had been correctly estimated by\r\nthe Prince de Maulear, angry as he naturally was at the sums lost by his\r\nson in those saloons. Madame de Bruneval assumed the military title of\r\nwidow of an ex-colonel of the Imperial Guard. There had really been such\r\na colonel on the _roles_ of the _grande armee_. Such a soldier had not\r\nonly had flesh and blood, but crosses and decorations. He had beaten,\r\nand well beaten, the Austrians, but had lost his horse at Leipsic, and\r\nbeen cut down by one of the black hussars of Brunswick. All this was\r\nreal, positive, and printed in black and white. There was no doubt about\r\nit. It was doubtful, though, if the Colonel ever had a wife. The\r\n_Moniteur_ mentioned the battles and the death--it said nothing of\r\nMadame. Colonel de Bruneval, once, during a time of peace--such times\r\nwere rare with the Emperor--came to Paris with a lady about forty,\r\nblonde like a German, rosy and fresh as a German, and speaking French\r\nwith a German accent. The Colonel introduced the lady to his brethren in\r\narms as _Madame la Colonelle_, and no one asked any other questions. No\r\none was ever bold enough to ask if the contract was perfectly regular;\r\nfor the Colonel was six feet high, tall as a drum-major, and was not\r\nonly a giant, but susceptible as possible, having a habit of translating\r\nlogic and syllogisms into sword-cuts and sabre slashes. The widow of the\r\nColonel, naturally enough, opened her house to her husband's\r\nbrothers-in-arms after the fatal blow of the black Brunswicker. The\r\nhouse of Mme. Bruneval, in 1818, had become a Bonapartist club, at which\r\nthe police squinted with unusual forbearance for a long time. We must,\r\nhowever, say, that the widow soon saw that the illustrious soldiers who\r\nfrequented her house did not indemnify her by their conversation for her\r\nexpenses. She therefore sought to make the presence of these heroes\r\navailable, and mingled with them a few honest people who were fond of\r\nplay, from whom the lights, like the altars of the god Plutus, received\r\nthe tithe of the stakes. At the widow's the play was high, and all kinds\r\nof games were recognized. All, however, was fair and above board, and\r\nthis kind of reputation attracted thither many persons who would not\r\nhave met on a field of battle less orthodox. People in good society were\r\nmet with there. People who, like the Marquis de Maulear, were unwilling\r\nto play in public, looked for excitement without regard to chance and\r\nsociety. There the famous match between the Marquis and Lord Elmore took\r\nplace. Count Monte-Leone also went occasionally to Mme. Bruneval's,\r\nsince he used to meet there many _Carbonari_ and Bonapartists; for, as\r\nwe have said, people of the most diverse opinions all united for one\r\npurpose, to destroy what was, and make their ideas triumph from the\r\nwreck of the general chaos.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the lesson given by the Prince to the Marquis de\r\nMaulear, the Count presented Taddeo to Mme. de Bruneval, and while the\r\nplay seemed animated in various parts of the room, the _Carbonari_\r\ntalked in a neighboring room of a plan conceived by several wealthy\r\nAmericans who were affiliated with the society, of a plan to bear off\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon from his prison at St. Helena, and carry him to\r\nFrance. Important, however, as the subject was, the Count paid but\r\nlittle attention to it. He was then at one of the most painful crises of\r\nhis life. In about an hour he would need all his courage and persuasion\r\nto combat and conquer one of the greatest obstacles man can meet with in\r\nhis career--the will of an energetic and passionate woman. Not long\r\nbefore, Monte-Leone had received the following note:\r\n\r\n\"For fifteen days I have not seen you. I do not know why you avoid me. I\r\nhad rather die than continue to live thus. I wish to hear my fate from\r\nyour own lips. For eight days _he_ will be away. Come--if you refuse\r\nme--if you are not with me when midnight comes, it will be the proof of\r\nan eternal adieu, and I will cease to live.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count waited with impatience for the period of this terrible\r\ninterview. He knew the feeling which had inspired this note, how full of\r\nirrepressible indignation her mind was, and that it would shrink from no\r\ndanger and no excess. He sought in vain to shake off Taddeo, but since\r\nthe scene in Verneuil street, when the wretch set to watch Monte-Leone\r\nhad been overheard by Rovero, the young man had been almost\r\nheart-broken. On this evening, though, he did not lose sight of Taddeo\r\nfor an instant. The Count saw with terror that the time was drawing\r\nnear, yet he could not leave the room. Taking advantage of a moment when\r\nTaddeo was not by, the Count was about to leave, when a noise was heard\r\nin the anteroom. The door was thrown open, and a man with a white scarf\r\nadvanced amid the company. There was no possibility of mistake, for\r\njustice, herself, as the Prince de Maulear had told his son, had come\r\ninto the gaming-house, disguised as a Commissary of Police. All who were\r\npresent felt the greatest uneasiness--they were about to be arrested on\r\nthe double charge of _Carbonarism_ and forbidden play. Was it to the\r\ngamesters or to the _Carbonari_ that the Commissary paid his visit? All\r\nwere excited, though from different motives.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the Commissary, exhibiting his warrant to Madame\r\nBruneval, who, like the commander of a besieged place, sought to parley\r\nwith the enemy; \"you are the widow of Colonel de Bruneval.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, sir,\" said the German lady, whose color became greater than ever,\r\n\"and cannot conceive why I should be thus insulted. I am not, I suppose,\r\nunder the surveillance of the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, madame,\" said the Commissary, \"your house has long been\r\npointed out to us, as the rendezvous of many Buonapartists\"--the\r\nBuonapartists became alarmed--\"and,\" continued the Commissary, \"as a\r\nplace where forbidden games are played. For these reasons, we are about\r\nto make an examination in the premises and in relation to the persons\r\nhere--until that is completed, none can leave this room.\"\r\n\r\nThe clock struck twelve. The sound made the Count grow pale, for it was\r\nthe hour of the rendezvous. His situation was annoying, and a moment's\r\ndelay might bring about a catastrophe. The note had said: \"If you are\r\nnot at my house by midnight, I shall be dead before one.\" The Count made\r\nup his mind, and with his habitual decision in all critical,\r\nembarrassing, or dangerous conjunctures, said that he must at all risks\r\nget out of the house and go whither he was expected, to save life--which\r\nevery moment endangered. In such a state of affairs, _ruse_ was the best\r\ncourse he could adopt--especially as that promised his immediate\r\nextrication. He was about to adopt a difficult course; he purposed to\r\nput out the lights, rush on the magistrate and his attendants, and then\r\nbreak through the doors. Before adopting this extreme course, the Count\r\nwished to know if he had many Carbonari around him. Glancing around the\r\nguests of Madame Bruneval, he placed his hand on his brow and made\r\nslowly the secret sign by means of which the Carbonari recognized each\r\nother. The Commissary had not removed his eyes from the Count, who he\r\nwas well aware, though he did not know his name, was one of the\r\nprincipal persons of the assemblage. No sooner had Monte-Leone made the\r\nsign than, much to his surprise, he saw the Commissary acknowledge it.\r\nThe Count then discovered that the magistrate was a Carbonari, and that\r\nthere was one more brother than could have been expected in the room.\r\nThis strange circumstance had its explanation in the statement of\r\nD'Harcourt at Doctor Matheus's: \"We meet our brethren every where; in\r\nthe city, in the courts, among the lawyers, and among the judges.\" The\r\ninquiry was brief and a mere matter of form. The Commissary did nothing.\r\nMonte-Leone was one of the first who received permission to leave.\r\nFollowed by Taddeo, he rushed out. Rovero called on him to stop, but the\r\nCount paid no attention to his cries. The clock was about to strike one,\r\nand hurrying across the streets and squares of Louis XV., with the\r\nrapidity of an arrow, he did not pause until he had reached the _Champs\r\nElysees_, where a little green door veiled by a hedge was opened to\r\nadmit him.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--DESPAIR.\r\n\r\nWhen the door opened, a woman appeared and said, \"Follow me, Count,\r\nMadame is waiting for your excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"What o'clock is it?\" asked he, with great anxiety.\r\n\r\nShe answered, \"A quarter after one.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you leave your mistress?\"\r\n\r\n\"At twelve. Madame bade me wait here for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lost!--dead! perhaps dead!\" exclaimed the Count. He hurried down the\r\nalley directly to the hotel.\r\n\r\n\"Signore! Signore!\" said the woman; \"all the servants have not perhaps\r\ngone to bed, and if you be seen now in the garden of the Embassy, what\r\nwill people say and think of Madame?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take me directly to her,\" said the Count, \"for her life is in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her life!\" said the woman, with terror. Then, as if struck with an\r\nidea, she added, \"Wait, though, Madame bade me not come into her room\r\nuntil to-morrow, unless I brought your excellency with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" said the Count, dragging the woman after him. Thus they\r\nwent to the right wing of the building. A small door opened on a private\r\nstairway communicating with the rooms of the Duchess of Palma. The\r\nservant pointed out the door to the Count, and then preceded him. The\r\nstairway ended at a little hall on the first floor. There the Count\r\nstopped and the woman put a key in another door in the wall, through\r\nwhich the Count entered a waiting-room and passed into a boudoir, where\r\nthe _femme de chambre_ asked him to sit for a few moments while she\r\ninformed the Duchess of his arrival. The Count was for some minutes\r\nalone in the boudoir, and at last heard a half stifled cry behind him.\r\nHe looked around and saw the servant motionless and with terror\r\nimpressed on every feature. She pointed to the Duchess's room with one\r\nhand, and lifted up the curtain of the door with the other. The Count\r\nentered the room where a terrible spectacle awaited him. The Duchess,\r\npale as death, was extended on a sofa; by her side was a lamp almost\r\nburnt out, and the flickering light cast from time to time a pale lustre\r\nover this scene of sadness and death. The pulse and heart of La Felina\r\nwere motionless. By her side was a flacon of red liquor, which was\r\nspilled on the rosewood stand. The Count held the flacon to his nose and\r\nlip, and recognized its contents to be laudanum, that bringer of calm or\r\nruin, of sleep or death.\r\n\r\nA feeling of deep sorrow took possession of him. The love and devotion\r\nof that woman appeared to him in their proper light--limitless and vast.\r\nRemorse lacerated his heart; for he charged himself with being the cause\r\nof the terrible crime she had committed. Again the Count approached the\r\nDuchess, and somewhat calmer than he had first been, perceived a faint\r\npalpitation. He placed a mirror near Felina's lips, and a thin mist\r\novercast it. \"She lives!\" said Monte-Leone; \"a lethargic sleep has\r\nplunged her in this apparent death. Thank heaven, from having taken too\r\nsmall a dose, the opium has acted as a narcotic--not as a poison. She\r\nmust be roused from this dangerous state. Listen,\" said he to the\r\nservant, \"I have a friend who will save your mistress without noise or\r\nscandal. He is a physician, as skilful as he is prudent. Send him this,\r\nat once,\" said he, writing hastily a few lines on a fragment of paper he\r\ntook from the Duchess's desk. \"Order the carriage at once, say that your\r\nmistress is ill and a physician indispensable. Suffer no one to enter\r\nthis room but the person for whom I have written, and I will answer for\r\nthe consequences. Here, this note is for Doctor Matheus, No. 7 _rue de\r\nBabylonne_--hurry.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Monte-Leone was alone with the Duchess, he sought to arouse her\r\nfrom the sleep which oppressed her, by making her inhale the perfumes of\r\nseveral flacons which he found near. This was, however, in vain, and he\r\nsoon abandoned it. \"Poor woman,\" said he, sitting by and looking at her\r\nwith compassion; \"this is then the end of her life and love: to what\r\nmisery has she been led by passion, while mine was not more lasting than\r\nthe perfume of a rose.\" As he abandoned himself to these cruel thoughts,\r\nthe eyes of the Count fell on a letter, which she had with her expiring\r\nstrength attempted to throw into the fire. It had, however, fallen on\r\nthe hearth and was but partially burned. The Count took hold of it with\r\nthe intention of destroying it, lest it might contain some secret\r\ncompromising the Duchess. Just, however, as he was about to destroy it,\r\nhe fancied that he saw his own name, and unable to resist his curiosity,\r\nhe glanced rapidly over it. The following detached phrases had been\r\nspared by the fire:\r\n\r\n    \"You gave me bread when I was famishing,\r\n    and apparel when I had none....\r\n\r\n    \"The consequence of....\r\n\r\n    \"body and soul....\r\n\r\n    \"But I feel your....\r\n\r\n    \"is mine....\r\n\r\n    \"belongs to you....\r\n\r\n    \"This Monte-Leone deserves to be....\r\n\r\n    \"offends you....\r\n\r\n    \"live for you....\r\n\r\n    \"or if I....\r\n\r\n    \"It will be for me....\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of this, said the Count, and what does she\r\nmeditate? Has the Duchess a confidant? Can this man be my enemy? How\r\nhave I injured him?\"\r\n\r\nThe servant entered, and the Count placed the letter in his bosom. A\r\nhalf hour passed in anxious expectation of Matheus. The wheels of a\r\ncarriage were heard in the courtyard and aroused the Count from his\r\nthoughts. The servant went to meet the Doctor and soon after introduced\r\nFrederick von Apsberg into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Look there,\" said the Count, pointing to La Felina.\r\n\r\nThe doctor drew near and examined her.\r\n\r\n\"Suicide and laudanum,\" said he. He felt the pulse. \"Just in\r\ntime--luckily you told me what was the matter, and I have brought some\r\nactive and powerful antidotes. In a quarter of an hour cerebral\r\ncongestion would have ensued, and death.\" He poured out a few drops of a\r\nliquid he had brought in a glass spoon, and forced it between the\r\nconvulsive teeth of the Duchess. Three minutes afterwards she heaved a\r\ndeep sigh. \"Now I will answer for her recovery,\" said Von Apsberg. The\r\nDuchess opened her eyes soon after and glanced around her. She was,\r\nthough, unable to distinguish any thing, so haggard and fixed had they\r\nbecome. The Count stood aside. For a few moments through the vast room\r\nnothing was heard but the feeble panting and anxious breathing of the\r\ninvalid, which, however, gradually grew more regular and natural.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said the doctor, giving the Duchess a glass of water, into\r\nwhich he had poured a few drops of the liquid he had brought with him,\r\n\"do you wish to live?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"Then do not take this antidote, for the poison is yet in your system\r\nand this alone can neutralize it.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Monte-Leone advanced towards La Felina.\r\n\r\n\"He here!\" murmured she.\r\n\r\n\"Live,\" said the Count, \"live, I beg you.\"\r\n\r\nWithout replying, the Duchess looked towards the doctor as if she were\r\nabout to ask him for the elixir. She drained the glass.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Von Apsberg, \"madame must be calm and silent; least of all\r\nmust she indulge in any emotion,\" added he, looking at Monte-Leone, \"or\r\nthe medicine will be powerless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are _you_?\" said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"A friend, a brother of mine, to whose heart I confide all the secrets\r\nof my life.\"\r\n\r\n_La Felina_ glanced a few moments at the doctor, and said, \"I remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, the Duchess has not forgot the Pulcinella at the Eutruscan\r\nhouse. She has not forgotten the dreamy German lad whom she once\r\nlectured so sternly, but who never was offended with her. The lecture\r\ndid him a great service, for the joyous Pulcinella, changing his humor\r\nand dress, has now become a grave doctor who never jests, and insists\r\nthat his prescriptions be literally followed. To add example to precept,\r\nI will remain in this room and watch over the prophetess of San Carlo,\r\nand if I do not leave her cured and reasonable,\" said he, whispering in\r\nthe Duchess's ear, \"for I am a physician of the mind as well as body, I\r\nwill at least do her some good. All my brothers of the medical\r\nprofession cannot say as much.\"\r\n\r\nHe then handed the Count his hat and pointed to the door.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow evening, at nine,\" said the Count, \"I will call on you.\" An\r\nexpression of joy hung on La Felina's lips, and she nodded in\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone placed his lips on the yet icy hand of the ambassadress, and\r\nthen approached Von Apsberg, to whom he said in a low tone, \"You swear\r\nthat you will save her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Matheus.\r\n\r\nThe Count went to the door, not the one the doctor had pointed out, but\r\nto the secret one through which he had come, and a few minutes after was\r\nalone in the _Champs Elysees_, doubtful whether all that had passed was\r\nnot a dream. The letter which he had found, and which rattled in his\r\nbosom, with its mysterious broken phrases, its shreds of threats and\r\nvengeance, sufficed to recall to his mind the reality of the scene which\r\nhe had been both an actor and participator in. According to his promise,\r\non the day after this series of alarms and torments, Monte-Leone went to\r\nthe hotel of the Neapolitan minister just as the bell of Saint Philippe\r\nde Roule rang for nine. The Count on this occasion came us an ordinary\r\nvisitor to the principal door.\r\n\r\n\"The Duchess,\" said the usher, \"made an exception of Count Monte-Leone\r\nalone, in orders she gave that no one should be admitted. Madame had\r\nlast night a nervous attack from which she yet suffers. She, however,\r\nexpects your excellency.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count went into the reception room, and soon after was introduced\r\ninto the Duchess's boudoir. He found Madame de Palma lying on a divan,\r\nand her countenance yet showed traces of her sufferings. Monte-Leone was\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess gave him her hand and bade him be seated. She said, \"You see\r\nalmost a spectre or ghost escaped from the grave. Do not, however, be\r\nafraid, the ghost will not rise before you animated by wrath and anger.\r\nDid it wish to do so, it is now too feeble.\" The Duchess used her salts,\r\nas if she would regain that strength which seemed rapidly leaving her.\r\n\r\n\"Felina,\" said the Count, gently and sadly, \"did you wish to die?\"\r\n\r\n\"What now is life to me?\" said she, \"I meet with only contempt and\r\ndesertion from him for whom I forgot my gratitude and duty. Be frank\r\nwith me, do not fear my despair; but this doubt is too cruel. _Tell_ me\r\nthat you do not love me, let me learn it from your mouth, not from your\r\nindifference.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count wished to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you do not know,\" continued she, and with her hand she bade him\r\nlisten, \"what those long hours of expectation are, when every noise\r\nseems to announce the coming of the person you love--when the hope\r\nhaving been twenty times deceived, the ear rather than the heart listens\r\nwith the anxiety of death to the sound of every carriage which passes\r\nby, but does not stop at your door--to the bell which announces another\r\nvisitor than the one who is expected. You do not know the torment of\r\nthose wretched evenings when alone, with no companion but sorrow--you\r\nsee ever before you your devotion to the one man all the time staring\r\nyou in the face, him attracted elsewhere by other charms. The soul that\r\nsuffers thus, by some instinctive powers, sees him approach every rival,\r\nbecome intoxicated by her glance, listen to her voice, take her hand\r\nstealthily, live in her life, while she dies a thousand times an hour--a\r\nthousand deaths as often as despair passes a picture before her. Do you\r\nsee, Count, how horrible all this is? This is murderous, though time\r\nmust elapse before the deadly poison takes effect on the heart. In such\r\ncases one who does not die rapidly is mad. Yesterday I had in my power\r\nthe means of avoiding such tortures.\"\r\n\r\nCompletely exhausted, the Duchess fell back on the cushion. The eyes of\r\nthe Count glistened with tears, and he knelt before the poor woman who\r\nhad suffered so much for him.\r\n\r\n\"Felina,\" said he, \"until to-day I thought courage consisted in braving\r\ndanger, and even death: I now know that I have only to unveil my heart\r\nto you to prove that my daring did not need that I should contend with\r\nthe ocean, be immured in a dungeon, and bare my neck to the axe. I will\r\nhave that courage, for to me it is a duty, and I will not shrink from\r\nit. When I met you on the Lago di Como--when sad at the fact that I had\r\nbeen deserted by men who did not know me, by the woman I adored, I saw\r\nyour immense tenderness unfolded to me, when you uttered those\r\npassionate words which my heart had no power then of understanding, I\r\nfancied that I had forgotten the past in the charms of a present full of\r\nlove and intoxicating passion. I told you all I felt, and was sincere\r\nand happy. I remembered what you had done for me, and I fancied I had\r\nfound the angel of my existence in you. Alas! a few months after, the\r\nbandage was torn from my brow, and, excuse me, but all I thought dead in\r\nmy soul became more animated than ever. I saw my tenderness was the\r\noffspring of friendship, that my love changed into deep affection,\r\nwhich, however, was not of the kind you expected from me. With terror\r\nand despair I discovered that I was ungrateful to you. Twenty times I\r\nwas on the point of making this painful confession, yet as many times I\r\nfelt my strength fail. Now, though, when you have wished to die for the\r\nunworthy man for whom you would have made such a sacrifice, when you\r\nhave appealed to my honor, I must speak to you, and avow to you my true\r\nsentiments, which it would be improper for me any longer to conceal from\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Count was speaking, the Duchess lay half asleep on the divan,\r\nwith her eyes closed, and her hand on her heart, the pulsations of which\r\nshe tried to restrain. One might have thought she slept, but for her\r\nshort respiration, and the heaving of her breast, which indicated great\r\nfeverish agitation. She remained in this motionless state a few seconds\r\nafter Monte-Leone had ceased. She then slowly opened her eyelids, and\r\nresting her head on her hand, as if her marble shoulders would not\r\nsuffice to sustain it, looked at the Count with those eyes whence\r\nemanated the burning glance of delirium. A single look--a single glance\r\nwas cast on the Count; this glance, however, was instinct with a\r\nterrible thought, and she became at once chill and cold.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for your frankness,\" said she to the Count, giving him her\r\nhand. \"Perhaps I would have thanked you had you suffered me to die\r\nwithout telling me what you have heard. You, however, wished me to live,\r\nand I can understand why, for my death would have poisoned all your\r\nexistence. I will live, then, but for you alone.\" The same glance she\r\nhad thrown on the Count appeared again, but immediately died away.\r\n\"Yet,\" continued she, \"listen to me. I cannot consent to lose you--I can\r\nconsent to be your friend, but will not think you another's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Felina,\" said the Count, \"I understand you. On my life and soul, I\r\nswear I will never speak of love to her of whom you think. Her ties and\r\nvirtues I will respect, her honor will relieve your apprehensions, and I\r\nknow what this honor imposes on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have faith in you,\" said Felina; \"understand me, though, and do not\r\nrequire what I cannot give. Do not add to my grief, the vengeance and\r\nexcess of which you cannot calculate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Threats!\" said the Count, bitterly. He was about to speak to the\r\nDuchess of the fragments of the letter, but was prevented by a secret\r\npresentiment.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Felina, \"not threats. Such are not intended for friends, and\r\nto me you are a friend.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count took her hand. It was cold as death.\r\n\r\n\"Come to see me often,\" said she; \"invalids need a physician; and\r\nskilful as the one you brought last night may be, your visits will exert\r\na better effect--you will enable me to contend with myself. Then, too,\"\r\nsaid she, growing pale, \"I will see you.... Now leave me, for I am\r\nfeeble. Since you wish me to live, I must not exhaust the rest of my\r\nlife ... I will try to sleep; but I will not sleep as long as I expected\r\nto last night.\" Then, as if she was completely exhausted by such a\r\nvariety of shocks, she bade the Count adieu.\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone left her. Just as he was about to cross the peristyle, he\r\nsaw the shadow of a man gliding into the hotel through the half open\r\ndoor. The face of this man was suddenly lighted up by one of the\r\nreflectors of the palace, and Monte-Leone remembered features yet\r\npresent to his memory. They were the features of STENIO SALVATORI of\r\n_Torre del Greco_.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--THE MAGNETIZER.\r\n\r\nThe lecture the Prince had given to his son seemed to have done him\r\ngood. For two months the family of the Prince de Maulear had been calm\r\nand happy. Aminta, in the care, attention, and watchfulness of her\r\nhusband, enjoyed again all the emotions of her early marriage days. Her\r\nletters to her mother were filled with hope far different than that\r\nexpressed in the one we have read. Henri constantly avoided every thing\r\nwhich could possibly awaken the sad passion which chance, temptation,\r\nand the weakness of his character had led him into. He never approached\r\nthe card-table, and paid no attention to the challenges of his old\r\nadversaries. He began to learn whist and other games of combination,\r\ncalculation, and science, which leave the head cold and the reason\r\nsound, and at which no one ever pretended to bet a thousand francs a\r\ntrick, as was subsequently done in 1846, at the house of Count A. ----\r\nand that of M. de R----, Minister of D. People then played whist for\r\nwhist's sake, not to become rich or bankrupt.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected event disturbed the quiet life of the inmates of the\r\nHotel-Maulear. Aminta received a letter from her mother, in which\r\nSignora Rovero announced to her daughter a piece of intelligence, which\r\nfor her children's sake delighted, while for her own sake it distressed\r\nher. The Roman Cardinal, Filippo Justiniani, her brother, of whom we\r\nspoke in one of the first chapters of this book, had died, leaving his\r\nfortune to his nephew and niece. This fortune was more than a million.\r\nSignora Rovero, therefore, wished her son-in-law, the Marquis de\r\nMaulear, and Taddeo, to come at once to Rome, to receive this\r\ninheritance; the one in the name of his wife, and the other for himself.\r\n\r\nThis letter produced very different effects in the family of the Prince\r\nde Maulear. Instead of rejoicing at a fortune which was to be purchased\r\nby the absence of her husband, the young _marquise_ was rather grieved\r\nthan pleased at it. The revenue the Prince had appropriated to his\r\nchildren was sufficient to make their career quite brilliant. This\r\nincrease of fortune, therefore, had little value in Aminta's eyes; but a\r\nseparation, though but temporary, from Henri might endanger, in one so\r\nvolatile as the Marquis was, the influence she had acquired over him.\r\nShe apprehended this, and fear, in a heart impassionable as his was,\r\ncould not but be the source of uneasiness and torment. The idea of\r\naccompanying the Marquis often suggested itself to her, but it was then\r\nthe depth of winter, and her health, naturally delicate, had been so\r\nrecently shaken by the troubles she had experienced, that she could not,\r\nat such a time, venture on such an excursion. The Prince de Maulear did\r\nnot see his son leave him without dissatisfaction. He did not think him\r\ncompletely cured of the moral malady he had undertaken to cure, but\r\nwatched over him paternally and kindly. The Marquis, though he sincerely\r\nregretted that he must be separated from his charming wife, whom he now\r\nloved better than ever, did not conceal the pleasure which such a trip\r\ncaused him. He did not deny that the kind of atony to which his\r\nmonotonous life subjected him, made it necessary that he should be\r\nsomewhat galvanised by the excitement of travel.\r\n\r\nTaddeo, too, had been more kindly received by the Duchess since the\r\nscene which had taken place between Monte-Leone and her. He was\r\ndistressed at the absence which removed him from that woman whose\r\ninfluence over his heart nothing could overcome.\r\n\r\nAll these feelings, however, resulted in the same circumstance--the\r\nprompt departure of the two heirs from the eternal city. When they left,\r\nAminta felt a deep distress, and the Prince de Maulear a sombre\r\npresentiment.\r\n\r\nFifteen days afterwards, a letter, dated at Rome, informed the young\r\nMarquise of the arrival of her husband and brother at the capital of the\r\nChristian world. This letter informed them also that there were\r\ndifficulties in the way of obtaining possession of the estate of\r\nCardinal Justiniani, from the fact that his eminence had made various\r\nbequests to convents, churches, and religious foundations, in relation\r\nto which it was necessary for the Holy Father himself to make a\r\ndecision, which would much retard the final arrangement of their\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAminta felt that her sadness was doubled at this news, and the feeling\r\ngrew more poignant from the fact that her husband's letters became every\r\nday more rare and more cold. Aware of the devotion of the Prince de\r\nMaulear to her, and knowing how uneasy the old man was about his son,\r\nthe young woman did all she could to conceal her anxiety from her\r\nfather-in-law, and by means of a thousand pretexts kept from his sight\r\nthe often icy letters written by her husband. When the Prince questioned\r\nher about what he wrote from Rome, he received an evasive reply. \"Well,\r\nwell,\" he would say, \"one should not inquire into them. Fathers have\r\nnothing to say about them; and provided, my child, that you are happy, I\r\nwill ask nothing more.\" Thus two months rolled by. The young Marquise\r\nwaited anxiously every day for the coming of the post, and the hours\r\nrolled by only to deceive her. Deep mortification soon replaced regret.\r\nSurrounded by the homage of a society which adored her, Aminta saw\r\nherself deserted by the man to whom she was bound for life, and the\r\nhumiliation of this indifference almost overpowered the agony she felt.\r\nThe fact was, that having already been sacrificed to the miserable\r\npassion for play, she now fancied she was postponed to the pleasure of\r\ntravel, and her firm character, softened by the happiness in which the\r\nearly days of her marriage had been passed, began now to assume the\r\nfirmness of womanhood, with all the characteristics of the Italian\r\nnature. Such was the condition of Aminta's mind when she received the\r\nvisit of the Count Monte-Leone. When he came she was alone. They were\r\nboth annoyed by this novel position, and for a time their conversation\r\nwas commonplace. But soon the memory of the past began to assert its\r\ninfluence over them. The Count spoke of Naples as Neapolitans only can.\r\nHe infused into his conversation the passionate energy which ever exists\r\nin their souls in relation to that climate, so highly favored by heaven.\r\nAminta, to whom the cold climate of France had not been that of her\r\nlove, surrendered her whole soul to the happiness awakened by those\r\nsmiling ideas. The Count recalled to her Sorrento and its perfumed\r\nhills, its azure sea and brilliant sky. He then recalled to her the\r\nvilla where he had been so nobly welcomed, where days flitted by like\r\nhours, where the silence of a calm and beautiful nature were only\r\ninterrupted by the breeze and the waves, which died away among myrtle\r\nand orange-groves, or by the songs of birds in the luxuriant thickets.\r\nAminta listened to him with increasing trouble, for his voice had never\r\nseemed so penetrating and mild. Astonishment took possession of her when\r\nshe thought that the mind of this man, so sensible to the charms of\r\nnature, so aware of the simple beauties of Italian scenery, was the\r\nenergetic and powerful soul which braved death without weakness, and\r\ndefied the executioner without fear. The Count thus led, contrary to his\r\nown wishes, into the dangerous retrospect of the past, felt his reason\r\ngive way, as he found himself in the presence of one whose very\r\nappearance agitated his reason, because she recalled that country where\r\nthe gayest and happiest hours of his life had passed.\r\n\r\nAminta, anxious to triumph over the involuntary emotion which took\r\npossession of her, diverted the Count from all the seductions of his\r\nmemory and love by asking if Taddeo was a better friend than brother,\r\nand if letters were as great rarities to him as to herself. The Count\r\nreplied that Taddeo wrote often. He then, with an effort, shook off his\r\ndelicious dream, and sadly returned to real life. \"The Marquis and he,\"\r\nsaid Monte-Leone, \"are yet at Rome, as M. de Maulear must have told you.\r\nRome has never been gayer than it now is. Festivals and entertainments\r\nare numerous, and the richest strangers of Europe are now there; while\r\nballs and cards are all the rage.\"\r\n\r\nAt the last phrase Aminta grew pale. The Count observed this, and\r\nattributing its cause to some illness, rose to go away. The Marquise,\r\nthough, said with a vivacity which surprised him, \"And does the Holy\r\nfather authorize play in his states?\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not authorize but tolerates it. This is sufficient for a bank\r\nkept by a rich society of capitalists, to realize millions by this\r\npassion, and to produce many disasters and calamities.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquise felt her heart grow chill, and as she began to grow sick\r\nshe dismissed the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Will the _Marquise_ permit me to call on her again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Count; and if you receive any news from Rome--from the Marquis and\r\nmy brother, tell me of it, I beg you.\" The Count left, more in love than\r\never; and Aminta remained alone, unhappy, agitated, and a prey to\r\ninstinctive and wretched thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes our duty to conduct the reader to a magnificent hotel in\r\nthe Faubourg St. Germain, and make him a spectator of a scene which\r\noccurred a few days after the conversation we have spoken of. We wish to\r\nintroduce him to the beautiful girl of whom Dr. Matheus caught a glimpse\r\nfrom the windows of the laboratory. This girl was no longer the most\r\nbrilliant rose of the parterre. Seated in a large arm-chair, near a\r\nwindow of the saloon, which looked out upon the garden, her pale\r\ncomplexion, and the hectic flush of her cheek, her red lips, and the\r\ndark ring about the eyes, indicated general indisposition. An old man\r\nsat near her, with one of her hands in his; while, with his eyes fixed\r\non her, he seemed with despair to read the expression of intense\r\nsuffering. The old man was the Duke d'Harcourt, and the invalid, his\r\ndaughter _Marie_.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, papa! this is nothing but a horrid _migraine_ to which I have long\r\nbeen subject. The pain in the chest which accompanies it, you know,\r\nnever lasts long, and is almost always cured by the very presence of the\r\nkind doctor, whom we might almost fancy to be a sorcerer.\"\r\n\r\n\"The means he employs, my child, and which he has communicated to me, is\r\nnot sorcery, but a science, scarcely known as yet, and the source of\r\nmuch dispute. I confess I had no great faith in it until experience had\r\nrevealed to me its power and reality.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you faith, papa, in the power of the doctor?\" asked the young\r\ngirl, with a singular accent.\r\n\r\n\"I believe, my child, in what I see. He benefits you, and therefore\r\ndissipates all my hesitation. Magnetism is not new; Mesmer, the able\r\nForia, and afterwards many serious and learned men have inquired into\r\nit, and discovered undeniable virtues. Unfortunately, imposture and\r\ncharlatanism soon took possession of it, and, therefore, it has been\r\noverburdened with ridicule and contempt. If it be a truth, as all I have\r\nseen induces me to think; if in the employment of this fluid there be\r\nmeans to assist nature, a studious man, who has any charity towards his\r\nfellows, should study before he decides on it, and reject nothing novel,\r\nas it may be, until he has proven it to be false or impotent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is the doctor!\" said the Vicomte d'Harcourt, quickly opening the\r\ndoor, and introducing Von Apsberg.--\"I have taken him from a grave\r\nconsultation to see my sister.\" Hurrying to his sister, the Vicomte\r\nkissed her. Marie blushed; was not this blush caused, perhaps, by the\r\ncoming of the doctor?--Was it caused by Rene's kiss? The heart alone can\r\ntell; and young women's hearts do not answer such questions very\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\n\"Marie yet suffers,\" said the Duke to the false Matheus. \"With you\r\nthough, doctor, hope and health always return. For that reason we are\r\nunwilling you should ever leave us.\" It was now the doctor's turn to\r\nblush.\r\n\r\n\"You certainly,\" said he, \"estimate my influence over the disease to be\r\nin proportion to my wish to soothe it. If such were really the case, you\r\nmight be of good cheer, for my wishes are limitless.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a doctor for you, modest, talented, and one who uses no drugs\r\nand none of the remedies of the old medicine,\" said the Vicomte;\r\n\"pantomime with him is every thing, as with the ballet-doctors of the\r\nopera. A few signs and gestures and away goes the disease, like the\r\ndevil when holy water is brought him.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg said with a smile, \"such an eulogium as the Vicomte's would,\r\na few centuries ago, have sent me to the stake. Fortunately there is now\r\nno danger of that, for there is no longer any faith in magicians.\r\nRightly enough, too, for if not so, there would be no glory and\r\nadvantage in wisdom. _Savans_ are fond of their privileges. For my own\r\npart, though no philosopher, I do not deal in magic, though from study I\r\nhave learned that there are secret agents in nature too much neglected\r\neven now, though much good has resulted and the most marvellous effects\r\nhave been produced from them. Of these agents, the magnetic fluid is the\r\nsurest, the most active and powerful. Like all other imponderable\r\nfluids, it is invisible, passing through space perhaps with the rapidity\r\nof light, though unlike the latter, its passage is not interrupted by\r\nthe opposition of opaque bodies, which it penetrates as caloric does.[F]\r\nI do not pretend, Duke,\" continued Von Apsberg, \"to teach you the theory\r\nof magnetism, but at all risks to justify your confidence in me, which\r\nnow induces you to confide so precious a trust to me. As an honest man I\r\nthink I am not deceived in the hope I expressed at my first visit, that\r\nyour daughter, from my system of action, will acquire that vital force\r\nwhich will enable her to overcome her natural weakness, and thus reach\r\nthe period of life when, age coming to aid nature, she will acquire a\r\ndegree of health which will bid defiance to all the accidents of youth\r\nand assure her a healthy life in future. I call God to witness that I\r\nact with a heartfelt conviction and religious sincerity. I will, though,\r\nswear, that if in a short time I see no evidence of the efficacy of my\r\nremedy, I will inform you of the fact without delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure, sir, you will. I confide in your honor as I do in your\r\nskill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said the Vicomte, \"you are right to do so. The doctor is a\r\nbrother to me, and looks on Marie almost as a sister.\"\r\n\r\nBoth the doctor and Marie now blushed. No one though remarked it, for\r\njust then the Prince and _Marquise_ de Maulear were announced. The Duke\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"They are friends and need not disturb you.\"\r\n\r\nAminta loved Marie d'Harcourt. These two beautiful women had conceived a\r\ndeep affection for each other. Aminta, though, who was a few years older\r\nthan Marie, and had a right to more gravity, as a married woman,\r\nmatronized the young girl, and it was rather an amusing picture to see a\r\nmother twenty years old, _chaperoning_ a daughter of seventeen and\r\nexplaining the peculiarities of a life they were equally ignorant of.\r\n\r\n\"Prince,\" said the Duke, \"Doctor Matheus is a famous magnetist, who has\r\nbeen serviceable to Marie already, and when you came in was about to\r\nsubject her again to the influence of the fluid.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Parbleu!_\" said the Prince, \"I would be glad to witness the\r\nexperiment. I am myself something of an adept, having known the Abbe\r\nForia in my youth. People used to laugh at him, but the court and the\r\npeople were present at his curious exhibitions. I, too, was magnetized,\r\ndrank magnetic water, and passed whole hours on the magnetic chair\r\nsurrounded by iron rings; all this was to cure me of a sciatica, which,\r\nnevertheless, he did not do at all. He asserted that I had no faith, and\r\nthat I arrayed myself against the power of the fluid. I, however, only\r\nask to believe, and if the doctor can convert me, I am willing.\"\r\n\r\nWithout answering the Prince, Von Apsberg approached Marie d'Harcourt.\r\nAminta sat by the patient. The doctor looked at the young girl. Seated a\r\nfew feet from her, he placed his hands in front of Marie's brow, and\r\nthen lowering them slowly, made some magnetic passes, seeming to direct\r\nhis action to the gastric regions where she suffered most. Marie did not\r\nseem at all affected by the operation.\r\n\r\nWhile Matheus was doing thus the Marquise, who sat in front of the\r\ndoctor, felt her brow grow heavy, her eyes close, and a deep\r\nstupefaction take possession of her. She soon felt that sleep was\r\noverpowering her, and after a few attempts to resist it, her head sunk\r\non her bosom, and leaning back in her chair, she was completely\r\noverpowered.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter is sick,\" said the Prince, hurrying to Aminta.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said the physician coldly, \"she only sleeps.\"\r\n\r\n\"She sleeps,\" said all who witnessed the scene, and who were evidently\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOMNAMBULIST.\r\n\r\n\"She sleeps!\" said Matheus, pointing to Aminta, \"and to fall so suddenly\r\ninto that state when I did not intend it, shows her to be very\r\nimpressionable and nervous.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Prince,\" said the Marquis, \"has often told me she is a\r\nsomnambulist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am no longer amazed,\" said Von Apsberg, \"at the spontaneity of her\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it true,\" said the Prince, \"that somnambulists have the power of\r\nbeing able to see what is taking place in remote spots--that they can\r\ntransport themselves to remote places and accompany the persons who are\r\npointed out to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"All these phenomena are real,\" replied the doctor, \"but they demand the\r\nmost perfect lucidity in the person magnetized.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can,\" asked the Duke, \"such experiments be made without\r\ninconvenience or danger to the subjects?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardieu,\" said the Prince, \"I would like the doctor to question my\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"About what?\" said Matheus.\r\n\r\n\"Something interesting to us all. For a month we have had no news from\r\nmy son, and are becoming uneasy about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you wish,\" said the doctor, \"to know what the Marquis de\r\nMaulear is engaged in now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Stop,\" said Rene, \"I object. There is no reason why a wife should know\r\nwhat her husband is about when he is three hundred leagues away. The\r\ndevil! That is dangerous, and the Marquise might some day regret it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you see,\" said Marie, with her soft voice, \"it would be dangerous\r\nfor her--she would not like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not fear that,\" said the Vicomte, \"but I vow there would be no\r\nmarriages possible, if women had the faculty of knowing at any hour, and\r\nin any place, what their husbands are about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the Prince, \"I have a better opinion of my son than the\r\nVicomte has of his friend, and I hope the doctor will send my\r\ndaughter-in-law on a visit to Rome.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this time Aminta continued asleep, but so soundly,\r\nthat her bosom scarcely heaved, and her breath escaped almost insensibly\r\nfrom her lips.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said the doctor, \"it is, in the first place, necessary that I\r\nshould establish a communication between the _Marquise_ and myself. I\r\nmust be able to place in her hands, to enable her to touch, something\r\nwhich belonged to the Marquis de Maulear. The best thing is a lock of\r\nthe Marquis's hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing in the world is easier; my daughter-in-law always wears a\r\nbracelet of the Marquis's hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"On which arm?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"On the left,\" said M. de Maulear. \"If Mademoiselle Marie be pleased to\r\ntake it off we will place it as the doctor wishes in the hands of the\r\nsomnambulist.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you sure,\" said Marie to Von Apsberg, \"are you sure she will\r\nnot suffer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, Mademoiselle, I would not have her suffer either for your sake or\r\nfor her own.\"\r\n\r\nMarie arose from her chair and walked painfully towards the Marquise,\r\nwho, having bared Aminta's arm a little above the wrist, found there a\r\nbracelet of the Marquis's hair. When she was about to touch it she said\r\nto the doctor, \"I shall awake her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be afraid of that, you will not.\"\r\n\r\nSlight, however, as the motion was, to which the sleeper's arm had been\r\nsubjected, the _Marquise_ half arose from her chair and made an effort\r\nto open her eyes. Von Apsberg extended his arm towards the Marquise's\r\nbrow, and she again sank into as deep a sleep as before. The bracelet\r\nwas given by Marie to the doctor, who placed it in Aminta's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"we will begin.\" Silence was at once established, and\r\nall was solemn and almost terrible; for it seemed that something was in\r\npreparation of the most terrible character, and that the room was\r\nbecoming filled with all those invisible phantoms we know as TERROR,\r\nFATE, and MISFORTUNE, and which on their leaden wings seem to soar above\r\nmortality. The strongest and best organized minds of our kind have, in\r\nthe silent places of their hearts, something of superstition, which\r\ndevelop themselves in certain conditions of the corporeal and mental\r\norganization. Without pretending to considerations of a very serious\r\nkind, the guests of the Duke d'Harcourt experienced a kind of mute\r\nterror, which in this world always precedes misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe strange power which the doctor used was also well calculated to\r\nimpress those who contemplated this scene. The doctor took Aminta's hand\r\nin his and said most respectfully:[G]\r\n\r\n\"Does the Marquise understand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Will you answer my questions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you read in my heart any malevolence or hostility to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"You then have confidence in me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure that in questioning you, as I am about to, I have no other\r\nobject but to relieve you of uneasiness in relation to the Marquis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that is the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Doctor, placing his thumbs on Aminta's forehead, \"I\r\nwish you to go at once to Rome, to Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is far away,\" said the Marquise, feebly.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to,\" said Matheus, imperiously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said the sleeper, with a smile, \"there is no reason why\r\nyou should be angry.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent. All the spectators, with their eyes fixed and their\r\nnecks extended, seemed to watch with anxiety every scene of this\r\nwhimsical drama. Their souls seemed hung on their lips.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my God!\" said the Marquise, with agitation, \"what a journey--how\r\ncold it is amid these mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"She crosses the Alps,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe Marquise coughed.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Marie, \"she will take cold.\" The young girl wrapped the\r\nshawl around her friend.\r\n\r\n\"This cold will not be dangerous,\" said the Vicomte, gayly.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" said Matheus.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the somnambulist, \"what a magnificent country! What a sun!\r\nThis then is Rome,\" said she, with enthusiasm, \"the city of the\r\nCaesars--the eternal city--the city of God!\"\r\n\r\nShe bowed herself respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Matheus, \"and now you must find him you love; you must look\r\nfor your husband amid this vast city.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" said the Marquise.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall lose myself amid these long streets; besides I am afraid of\r\nthese men in masks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear. I _wish_ you to see the Marquis at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquise clasped the bracelet of her husband's hair convulsively,\r\nand then uttering a cry of joy, said:\r\n\r\n\"It is he--Henri, Henri, I see him.\"\r\n\r\nShe extended her arms as if to embrace him. The flush which had covered\r\nher face was soon succeeded by a mortal pallor.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh God!\" said she, \"he does not see me. He passes by without looking at\r\nme. Whither does he go? Why is he so sad? Why is his hair so disordered?\r\nWhy? why?\"\r\n\r\nThe tone in which these words were uttered were so deeply sorrowful,\r\nthat the doctor reached forward his hand and said to the Prince: \"_Must\r\nI awaken the Marquise?_\" Before the Prince could reply, Aminta stood\r\nerect and said, \"No! I will go with him. Henri, Henri! for pity's sake\r\ndo not. I never will forgive you! Henri, you would not commit perjury?\r\nMy God!\" said she, clasping her hands, \"he will go thither! Fatal,\r\nterrible passion!\"\r\n\r\nShe then shed tears, and fell back into the arms of Marie, who sustained\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Enough, doctor, enough!\" said Marie, \"I beseech you. She suffers, you\r\nsee. She shall not do so. I will not consent to.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor took the young woman's hand, and prepared to arouse her from\r\nthis condition and to restore her to real life. Just then the Prince de\r\nMaulear, with intense agony on his face, rushed towards his\r\ndaughter-in-law, repelling Matheus.\r\n\r\n\"Will the health and happiness of the Marquise be endangered,\" said he,\r\n\"if she continue longer in this condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her heart alone will suffer, Monsieur,\" said the doctor, \"neither her\r\nhealth nor her life is in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, then, Monsieur,\" said the Prince, coldly, \"for we speak of my\r\nson. On what the Marquise has said depends the repose of my life, her\r\nhappiness, and the honor of my family.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Matheus, \"my honor forbids me to follow up the excitement\r\nany longer. Know that the true apostles of the science I now practise\r\nbefore you, make it a rigid law never to make use of such phenomena as\r\nyou have seen, to penetrate hidden secrets, or to read by force the\r\nconsciences of those whom they submit to the exercise of their will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the Prince, \"we have around us here only honest hearts,\r\nwhich are also friendly. I, therefore, do not at all fear to initiate\r\nthem into my family secrets. Besides this, vain curiosity exerts no\r\ninfluence over me, but a nobler thought, the possibility, perhaps, of\r\npreventing cruel misfortunes which I now apprehend, and which I would\r\nanticipate.\"\r\n\r\n\"_See!_\" said the doctor to the Marquise. \"_I wish you to_----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" said the somnambulist. \"I have seen enough. Do not force me to\r\nfollow out his wanderings--he has forgotten me--his father--his\r\nhonor--his oath--himself!\"\r\n\r\n\"_See!_\" said the doctor, replacing his hand over the Marquise's eyes,\r\n\"_I wish it._\"\r\n\r\n\"Henri! Henri!\" exclaimed she, \"will nothing then restrain you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is he about, then?\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"See, see! he sits in front of a table covered with money. The wheel\r\nturns. The people who look after it do so with haggard eyes. How pale\r\nand withered they are! See how he throws the money on the table. Poor\r\nHenri--how he suffers! His brow is frozen. How horribly pale he is! He\r\nbeats his breast. See that pale and pitiless man sweeping away all the\r\nmoney! Ah!\" said she, \"he quivers--he seems about to faint--no, he takes\r\nout his pocket-book, and throws other notes on the table. The wheel\r\nturns again. My God, have pity on him! Lost, lost again! He endures\r\ntorments worse than death. Henri! for mercy's sake, stop--remember your\r\nwife--your Aminta--\"\r\n\r\nHer sobs increased, and inarticulate sounds burst from her chest. The\r\nPrince listened with increasing agitation to the heart-rending words of\r\nAminta. His eyes wandered, troubled and uncertain, between the Marquise\r\nand the doctor. His eyes became cold, his cheeks livid, and from time to\r\ntime the noble and venerable old man seemed to bend beneath another half\r\ncentury. All the others, sad and terrified, seemed fascinated by this\r\nterrible drama.\r\n\r\n\"He has in his hand his last notes,\" said Aminta--\"he places them before\r\nhim. Silence! hark, there is a confused noise. The wheel again makes its\r\nodious circle. It stops--Henri advances to take them. No, no, they are\r\nnot his. The man seizes them, and takes possession of this. What does he\r\nsay?\" continued she, with attention--\"ruined! ruined! he says. Well,\r\nwhat matter? it is only gold--only gold that he has lost. Dear Henri,\"\r\nsaid she, in a beseeching air, as if she knelt before him--\"husband,\r\nwhat is the value of your money, if you love me? Listen to me. Do not\r\nweep, for your tears will kill me. Come to me--I forgive you. I will not\r\nreproach you, and you will not leave me again--never, never, never. He\r\nrepels and avoids me. Whither does he go? What a desert! what an\r\nisolated street! How dark it is!--let us follow him, and not desert him.\r\nWhat do I see at the end of this street?\" She looked through her hands,\r\nas if to enable her to see further. \"What long black cloth is that? What\r\npall is that? Henri does not walk--but I cannot follow him,\" said she,\r\nin a heart-rending voice. \"Listen to me, Henri, I am suffering--I have\r\nwalked so far and am so overcome. I do not see him--he is gone! he draws\r\nnear the pall. My God! is there not a mourning-cloth painted on the\r\nhorizon? It is water--a river--he rushes toward it--let us reach him--I\r\ncannot! Ah! here he is. I am with him now. What does he want. He calls\r\nme--he pronounces my name. Here I am--close--next to you. Your father\r\nalso calls you. Come, come, let us turn to him. He does not hear me--he\r\nlifts his eye to heaven--he prays. Henri, Henri, why do you approach\r\nthis dark water? Take care of the water--death is before you--under your\r\nvery feet.\"...\r\n\r\nJust then the Marquise uttered a terrible cry, and was seized with a\r\nviolent nervous attack.\r\n\r\n\"You would insist, Monsieur,\" said the doctor to the Prince, in a\r\nreproachful tone. Then, taking the young woman's hands, he clasped them\r\nin his own, and made a few rapid passes over her face and eyes. He then\r\nmade her smell a flacon of salts, and opened a window of the room, close\r\nto which he placed the Marquise's chair. This occupied a few minutes,\r\nall who were present standing around Mme. de Maulear, and paying\r\nattention only to her. The first excitement having passed away, they\r\ndiscovered that the Prince de Maulear had fainted. The doctor drew near\r\nthe old man, and soon restored him to consciousness. When he had\r\nrecovered his senses, the Prince called the doctor to him, and\r\nwhispered, \"Do you believe all this?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor clasped the hand of the Prince, and went away.\r\n\r\nThe Marquise de Maulear, smiling and calm, said, \"Have I not been\r\nasleep?\"\r\n\r\nHer memory, however, recalled nothing of the scenes which had passed\r\nbefore her in her somnambulism. She forgot, as people frequently do,\r\nboth pleasant and mournful dreams....\r\n\r\nFifteen days after this scene Mme. de Maulear saw her mother stop at the\r\nhotel of the Prince. Behind Signora Rovero, humble and trembling, was\r\nthe deformed and courageous boy, whom the children of Sorrento had\r\ncalled Scorpione. The Marquise, both happy and surprised, rushed into\r\nher mother's arms. With great anxiety, she suddenly cried, \"Henri--the\r\nMarquis--where is he?\"\r\n\r\nIn reply, the Signora Rovero clasped her daughter to her breast, and\r\nwept.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[F] The translator has here elided about two pages on the theory of\r\nmagnetism which he has thought rather detracted than otherwise from the\r\ninterest of this book.\r\n\r\n[G] Madame la Marquise, se trouve-t-elle ainsi suffisament en rapport\r\navec moi?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nSCENES AT MALMAISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Palace of Malmaison, though not built on a large scale, became, with\r\nthe additions afterwards made, a most princely residence. The hall, the\r\nbilliard-room, the reception-rooms, the saloon, dining-room, and\r\nNapoleon's private apartment, occupied the ground floor, and are\r\ndescribed as having been very delightful. The gallery was appropriated\r\nto the noblest specimens of the fine arts; it was adorned with\r\nmagnificent statuary by Canova and other celebrated artists, and the\r\nwalls were hung with the finest paintings. The pleasure-grounds, which\r\nwere Josephine's especial care, were laid out with admirable taste;\r\nshrubs and flowers of the rarest and finest growth and the most\r\ndelicious odors, were there in the richest profusion. But there is an\r\ninterest far deeper than the finest landscape, or the most exquisite\r\nembellishments of art, could ever impart--an interest touchingly\r\nassociated with the precincts where the gifted and renowned have moved,\r\nand with the passions and affections, the joys and sorrows by which they\r\nwere there agitated. It is, indeed, an interest which excites a mournful\r\nsympathy, and may awaken salutary reflection. Who, indeed, could visit\r\nMalmaison without experiencing such?\r\n\r\nThe vicissitudes experienced by some individuals have been so strange,\r\nthat had they been described in a romance, it would have lost all\r\ninterest from their improbability; but occurring in real life, they\r\nexcite a feeling of personal concern which forever attaches to the name\r\nwith which they are associated. Of this, the eventful life of Napoleon\r\nfurnishes a striking example. There cannot be found in the range of\r\nhistory one who appears to have identified himself so much with the\r\nfeelings of every class and every time; nay, his manners and appearance\r\nare so thoroughly impressed on every imagination, that there are few who\r\ndo not rather feel as if he were one whom they had seen and with whom\r\nthey had conversed, than of whom they had only heard and read. Scarcely\r\nless checkered than his, was the life of Josephine: from her early days\r\nshe was destined to experience the most unlooked-for reverses of\r\nfortune: her very introduction to the Beauharnais family and connection\r\nwith them, were brought about in a most unlikely and singular manner,\r\nwithout the least intention on her part, and it ultimately led to her\r\nbeing placed on the throne of France. The noble and wealthy family of\r\nBeauharnais had great possessions in the West Indies, which fell to two\r\nbrothers, the representatives of that distinguished family; many of its\r\nmembers had been eminent for their services in the navy, and in various\r\ndepartments. The heirs to the estates had retired from the royal marine\r\nservice with the title of _chefs d'escadre_. The elder brother, the\r\nMarquis de Beauharnais, was a widower, with two sons; the younger,\r\nVicomte de Beauharnais, had married Mademoiselle Mouchard, by whom he\r\nhad one son and two daughters. The brothers, warmly attached to each\r\nother from infancy, wished to draw still closer the bonds which united\r\nthem, by the marriage of the Marquis's sons with the daughters of the\r\nVicomte; and with this view, a rich plantation in St. Domingo had never\r\nbeen divided. The two sisters were looked on as the affianced brides of\r\ntheir cousins; and when grown up, the elder was married to the elder son\r\nof the Marquis, who, according to the prevalent custom of his country,\r\nassumed the title of Marquis, as his brother did that of Vicomte. M.\r\nRenaudin, a particular friend of the Beauharnais, undertook the\r\nmanagement of their West Indian property. The Marquis, wishing to show\r\nsome attention in return for this kindness, invited Madame Renaudin over\r\nto Paris, to spend some time. The invitation was gladly accepted; and\r\nMadame Renaudin made herself useful to her host by superintending his\r\ndomestic concerns. But she soon formed plans for the advancement of her\r\nown family. With the Marquis's permission, she wrote to Martinique, to\r\nher brother, M. Tacher de la Pagerie, to beg that he would send over one\r\nof his daughters. The young lady landed at Rochefort, was taken ill, and\r\ndied almost immediately. Notwithstanding this unhappy event, Madame did\r\nnot relinquish the project which she had formed, of bringing about a\r\nunion between the young Vicomte and a niece of her own. She sent for\r\nanother;--and _Josephine_ was sent. When the young creole arrived, she\r\nhad just attained her fifteenth year, and was eminently attractive; her\r\nelegant form and personal charms were enhanced by the most winning\r\ngrace, modesty, and sweetness of disposition. Such fascinations could\r\nnot have failed in making an impression on the young man with whom she\r\nwas domesticated. His opportunities of becoming acquainted with his\r\ncousin were only such as were afforded by an occasional interview at the\r\ngrating of the convent, where she was being educated; so no attachment\r\nhad been formed; and he fell passionately in love with the innocent and\r\nlovely Josephine. She was not long insensible to the devotion of a lover\r\nso handsome and agreeable as the young Vicomte. Madame Renaudin sought\r\nthe good offices of an intimate friend, to whose influence with the\r\nyoung man's father she trusted for the success of her project. In a\r\nconfidential interview the lady introduced the subject--spoke of the\r\nardent attachment of the young people, of the charms of the simple girl\r\nwho had won his son's heart, and urged the consideration of the young\r\nman's happiness on his father, assuring him it rested on his consent to\r\nhis marriage with Josephine. The Marquis was painfully excited; he loved\r\nhis son tenderly, and would have made any sacrifice to insure his\r\nhappiness; but his affection for his brother, and the repugnance which\r\nhe felt, to fail in his engagement to him, kept him in a state of the\r\nmost perplexing uneasiness. At length, stating to his brother how\r\nmatters stood, he found that he had mortally offended him; so deeply,\r\nindeed, did he resent the affront, that he declared he could never\r\nforget or forgive it--a promise too faithfully kept.\r\n\r\nThe affection and confidence of a whole life were thus snapped asunder\r\nin a moment. The Vicomte insisted on a division of the West Indian\r\nproperty; and, with feelings so bitterly excited, no amicable\r\narrangement could take place, and the brothers had recourse to law, in\r\nwhich they were involved for the rest of their days.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the young people took place, and the youthful\r\nMademoiselle Tacher de Pagerie became Vicomtesse de Beauharnais.\r\n\r\nIt is said that her husband's uncle took a cruel revenge for the\r\ndisappointment, of which she had been the cause, by awakening suspicion\r\nof the fidelity of Josephine in the mind of her husband. The distracting\r\ndoubts he raised made his nephew wretched; to such a degree was his\r\njealousy excited, that he endeavored, by legal proceedings, to procure a\r\ndivorce; but the evidence he adduced utterly failed, and after some\r\ntime, a reconciliation took place.\r\n\r\nThe uncle died, and his daughter had in the mean time married the\r\nMarquis de Barral. So all went well with the young couple. They met with\r\nthe most flattering reception at court. The Vicomte, who was allowed to\r\nbe the most elegant dancer of his day, was frequently honored by being\r\nthe partner of the Queen. And as to Josephine, she was the admired of\r\nall admirers; she was not only considered one of the most beautiful\r\nwomen at court, but all who conversed with her were captivated by her\r\ngrace and sweetness. She entered into the gayeties of Versailles with\r\nthe animation natural to her time of life and disposition.\r\n\r\nBut the sunshine of the royal circle was, ere long, clouded, and the\r\ngathering storm could be too well discerned; amusement was scarcely\r\nthought of. The States General assembled, and every thing denoted a\r\nrevolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nJosephine was an especial favorite with the Queen; and in those days,\r\ndark with coming events, she had the most confidential conversations\r\nwith her; all the fears and melancholy forebodings which caused the\r\nQueen such deep anxiety, were freely imparted to her friend. Little did\r\nJosephine think, while sympathizing with her royal mistress, that she\r\nwould herself rule in that court, and that she, too, would be a sufferer\r\nfrom the elevation of her situation. Her husband, the Vicomte de\r\nBeauharnais, was then called to join the army, as war had been\r\nunexpectedly declared. He distinguished himself so much, that he\r\nattained the rank of general. But in the midst of his successful career,\r\nhe saw the danger which was impending, and he could perceive that not\r\nonly were the days of Louis's power numbered, but he even feared that\r\nhis life was not safe. His fears were unhappily fulfilled; and he\r\nhimself, merely on account of belonging to the aristocracy, was\r\ndenounced by his own troops, and deprived of his commission by\r\nauthority, arrested, brought to Paris, and thrown into prison. It was\r\nduring his imprisonment that the Vicomte had the most affecting proofs\r\nof the attachment of Josephine: all the energies of her mind and of her\r\nstrong affection were bent on obtaining his liberty; no means she could\r\ndevise were left untried; she joined her own supplications to the\r\nsolicitations of friends, to whom she had appealed in her emergency; she\r\nendeavored, in the most touching manner, to console and cheer him. But\r\nthe gratification of soothing him by her presence and endearments was\r\nsoon denied, for she was seized, and taken as a prisoner to the convent\r\nof the Carmelites. A few weeks passed, and the unfortunate Vicomte was\r\nbrought to trial, and condemned to death by the revolutionary tribunal.\r\nThough natural tears fell at thoughts of parting from his wife and\r\nchildren, and leaving them unprotected in the world, his courage never\r\nforsook him to the last.\r\n\r\nWhen the account of his execution reached Josephine she fainted away,\r\nand was for a long time alarmingly ill. It was while in prison, and\r\nevery moment expecting to be summoned before the revolutionary tribunal,\r\nthat Josephine cut off her beautiful tresses, as the only gift which she\r\nhad to leave her children, for all the family estates in Europe had been\r\nseized, and the destruction of property at St. Domingo had cut off all\r\nsupplies from that quarter. Yet amidst her anxieties, her afflictions,\r\nand her dangers, her fortitude never forsook her, and her example and\r\nher efforts to calm them, to a degree supported the spirits of her\r\nfellow-prisoners. Josephine herself ascribed her firmness to her\r\nimplicit trust in the prediction of an old negress which she had\r\ntreasured in her memory from childhood. Her trust, indeed, in the\r\ninexplicable mysteries of divination was sufficiently proved by the\r\ninterest with which she is said to have frequently applied herself\r\nduring her sad hours of imprisonment to learn her fortune from a pack of\r\ncards. Mr. Alison mentions, that he had heard of the prophecy of the\r\nnegress in 1801, long before Napoleon's elevation to the throne.\r\nJosephine herself, Mr. Alison goes on to say, narrated this\r\nextraordinary passage in her life in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n     \"One morning the jailer entered the chamber where I slept\r\n     with the Duchesse d'Aiguillon and two other ladies, and told\r\n     me he was going to take my mattress, and give it to another\r\n     prisoner.\r\n\r\n     \"'Why,' said Madame Aiguillon, eagerly, 'will not Madame de\r\n     Beauharnais obtain a better one?'\r\n\r\n     \"'No, no,' replied he, with a fiendish smile, 'she will have\r\n     no need of one, for she is about to be led to the\r\n     Conciergerie, and then to the guillotine.\"\r\n\r\n     \"At these words, my companions in misfortune uttered\r\n     piercing shrieks. I consoled them as well as I could; and at\r\n     length, worn out with their eternal lamentations, I told\r\n     them that their grief was utterly unreasonable; that I not\r\n     only should not die, but live to be queen of France.\r\n\r\n     \"'Why, then, do you not name your maids of honor?' said\r\n     Madame Aiguillon, irritated at such expressions at such a\r\n     moment.\r\n\r\n     \"'Very true,' said I, 'I did not think of that. Well, my\r\n     dear, I make you one of them.'[H]\r\n\r\n     \"Upon this the tears of the ladies fell apace, for they\r\n     never doubted I was mad; but the truth was, I was not gifted\r\n     with any extraordinary courage, but internally persuaded of\r\n     the truth of the oracle.\r\n\r\n     \"Madame d'Aiguillon soon after became unwell, and I drew her\r\n     towards the window, which I opened, to admit through the\r\n     bars a little fresh air. I then perceived a poor woman who\r\n     knew us, and who was making a number of signs, which I could\r\n     not at first understand. She constantly held up her gown\r\n     (_robe_); and seeing that she had some object in view, I\r\n     called out _robe_; to which she answered _yes_. She then\r\n     lifted up a stone, and put it into her lap, which she lifted\r\n     a second time. I called out _pierre_. Upon this, she evinced\r\n     the greatest joy at perceiving that her signs were\r\n     understood. Joining then the stone to her robe, she eagerly\r\n     imitated the motion of cutting off the head, and immediately\r\n     began to dance and evince the most extravagant joy.\r\n\r\n     \"This singular pantomime awakened in our minds a vague hope\r\n     that possibly Robespierre might be no more.\r\n\r\n     \"At this moment, while we were vacillating between hope and\r\n     fear, we heard a great noise in the corridor, and the\r\n     terrible voice of our jailer, who said to his dog, giving\r\n     him at the same time a kick, 'Get in, you cursed\r\n     Robespierre.'\"\r\n\r\nThis speech told them they were saved.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of Barras, a portion of her husband's property, in\r\nwhich Malmaison was included, was restored to Josephine. In this\r\nfavorite abode she amused herself in exercising her taste in the\r\nembellishment of the grounds, and in the pursuit of botany; but her\r\nchief enjoyment was in the society and instruction of her children, to\r\nwhom she was passionately attached. Their amiable dispositions and their\r\ntalents were a source of the most exquisite pleasure to her, not,\r\nhowever, unmingled with regret at finding herself without the means of\r\nconferring on them the advantages of which they were so deserving.\r\nHowever, a better time was to come. Madame Tallien and several of\r\nJosephine's friends, after a time, prevailed on her to enter into\r\nsociety, and the fair associates became the principal ornaments of the\r\ndictatorial circle. Through their influence revolutionary manners were\r\nreformed, and all the power which their charms and their talents gave\r\nthem was exerted in the cause of humanity.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's acquaintance with Josephine arose from the impression made on\r\nhim by her son, Eugene Beauharnais, then a little boy. He came to\r\nrequest that his father's sword, which had been delivered up, might be\r\nrestored to him. The boy's appearance,--the earnestness with which he\r\nurged his request, and the tears which could not be stayed when he\r\nbeheld the sword, interested Napoleon so much in his favor, that not\r\nonly was the sword given to him, but he determined to become acquainted\r\nwith the mother of the boy. He visited her, and soon his visits became\r\nfrequent. He delighted to hear the details which she gave of the court\r\nof Louis.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" he would say, as he sat by her side of an evening, \"now let us\r\ntalk of the old court--let us make a tour to Versailles.\" It was in\r\nthese frequent and familiar interviews that the fascinations of\r\nJosephine won the heart of Napoleon. \"She is,\" said he, \"grace\r\npersonified--every thing she does is with a grace and delicacy peculiar\r\nto herself.\"\r\n\r\nThe admiration and love of such a man could not fail to make an\r\nimpression on a woman like Josephine. It has been said, that it was\r\nimpossible to be in Napoleon's company without being struck by his\r\npersonal appearance; not so much by the exquisite symmetry of his\r\nfeatures, and the noble head and forehead, which have furnished the\r\npainter and the sculptor with one of their finest models; nor even by\r\nthe meditative look, so indicative of intellectual power; but the magic\r\ncharm was the varying expression of countenance, which changed with\r\nevery passing thought, and glowed with every feeling. His smile, it is\r\nsaid, always inspired confidence. \"It is difficult, if not impossible,\"\r\nso the Duchess of Abrantes writes, \"to describe the charm of his\r\ncountenance when he smiled;--his soul was upon his lips and in his\r\neyes.\" The magic power of that expression at a later period is well\r\nknown. The Emperor of Russia experienced it when he said, \"I never loved\r\nany one more than that man.\" He possessed, too, that greatest of all\r\ncharms, a harmonious voice, whose tones, like his countenance, changing\r\nfrom emphatic impressiveness to caressing softness, found their way to\r\nevery heart. It may not have been those personal and mental gifts alone\r\nwhich won Josephine's heart; the ready sympathy with which Napoleon\r\nentered into her feelings may have been the greatest charm to an\r\naffectionate nature like hers.\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of one of those confidential evenings that, as they\r\nsat together, she read to him the last letter which she had received\r\nfrom her husband: it was a most touching farewell. Napoleon was deeply\r\naffected; and it has been said that that letter, and Josephine's emotion\r\nas she read it, had a powerful effect upon his feelings, already so much\r\nexcited by admiration.\r\n\r\nJosephine soon consented to give her hand to the young soldier of\r\nfortune who had no dower but his sword. On his part, he gave a pledge\r\nthat he would consider her children as his own, and that their interest\r\nshould be his first concern. The world can testify how he redeemed his\r\npledge! To his union with Josephine he was indebted for his chief\r\nhappiness. Her affection, and the interchange of thought with her, were\r\nprized beyond all the greatness to which he had attained. Many of the\r\nlittle incidents of their every-day life cannot be read without deep\r\ninterest--evincing, as they do, a depth of affection and tenderness of\r\nfeeling which it is difficult to conceive should ever have been\r\nsacrificed to ambition. They visited together the prison where Josephine\r\nhad passed so many dreary and sad hours. He saw the loved name traced on\r\nthe dank wall, by the hand which was now his own. She had told him of a\r\nring, which she had fondly prized; it had been the gift of her mother.\r\nShe pointed out to him the flag under which she had contrived to hide\r\nit. When it was taken from its hiding-place and put into her hand, her\r\ndelight enchanted Napoleon. Seldom have two persons met whose feelings\r\nand whose tastes appeared more perfectly in unison than theirs, during\r\nthe _happy_ days of their wedded life. The delight which they took in\r\nthe fine arts was a source of constant pleasure; and in their days of\r\npower and elevation, it was their care to encourage artists of talent.\r\nMany interesting anecdotes are related of their kind and generous acts\r\ntowards them. In Josephine's manner of conferring favors, there was\r\nalways something still more gratifying than the advantage\r\nbestowed--something that implied that she entered into the feelings of\r\nthose whom she wished to serve. She had observed that M. Turpin, an\r\nartist who went frequently to Malmaison, had no coveyance but an almost\r\nworn-out cabriolet, drawn by a sorry horse. One day, when about to take\r\nhis leave, he was surprised to see a nice new vehicle and handsome horse\r\ndrawn up. His own arms painted on the pannels, and stamped on the\r\nharness, at once told him they were intended for him; but this was not\r\nthe only occasion on which Josephine ministered to the straitened means\r\nof the painter. She employed him in making a sketch of a Swiss view,\r\nwhile sitting with her, and directed him to take it home, and bring the\r\npicture to her when finished. She was delighted with the beautiful\r\nlandscape which he produced, and showed it with pleasure to every\r\nvisitor who came in. The artist no doubt felt a natural gratification at\r\nfinding his fine work appreciated. Josephine then called him aside, and\r\nput the stipulated price in bank-notes into his hand.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said she, \"is for your excellent mother; but it may not be to\r\nher taste; so tell her that I shall not be offended at her changing this\r\ntrifling token of my friendship, and of the gratification which her\r\nson's painting has given me, for whatever might be more acceptable.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she put into his hand a diamond of the value of six\r\nthousand francs.\r\n\r\nJosephine attended Napoleon in many of his campaigns. When she was not\r\nwith him, he corresponded regularly with her, and no lover ever wrote\r\nletters more expressive of passionate attachment.\r\n\r\n\"By what art is it,\" he says, in one of them, \"that you have been able\r\nto captivate all my faculties? It is a magic, my sweet love, which will\r\nfinish only with my life. To live for Josephine is the history of my\r\nlife. I am trying to reach you. I am dying to be with you. What lands,\r\nwhat countries separate us! What a time before you read these lines!\"\r\n\r\nJosephine returned her husband's fondness with her whole heart. Utterly\r\nregardless of privation and fatigue, she was ever earnest in urging him\r\nto allow her to accompany him on all his long journeys; and often, at\r\nmidnight, when just setting out on some expedition, he has found her in\r\nreadiness.\r\n\r\n\"No, love,\" he would say, \"No, no, love, do not ask me; the fatigue\r\nwould be too much for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" she would answer; \"No, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have not a moment to spare.\"\r\n\r\n\"See, I am quite ready;\" and she would drive off, seated by Napoleon's\r\nside.\r\n\r\nFrom having mingled in scenes of gayety from her earliest days, and from\r\nthe pleasure which her presence was sure to diffuse, and perhaps, it may\r\nbe added, from a nature singularly guileless, that could see no evil in\r\nwhat appeared to her but as innocent indulgencies, she was led into\r\nexpenses and frivolous gratifications which were by no means essential\r\nfor a mind like hers. Dishonest tradesmen took advantage of her\r\ninexperience and extreme easiness, and swelled their bills to an\r\nenormous amount; but her greatest and far most congenial outlay, was in\r\nthe relief of the distressed. She could not endure to deny the petition\r\nof any whom she believed to be suffering from want; and this tenderness\r\nof heart was often imposed on by the artful and rapacious. Those who,\r\nfrom interested motives, desired to separate her from Napoleon, felt a\r\nsecret satisfaction in the uneasiness which her large expenditure\r\noccasionally gave him. To their misrepresentations may be ascribed the\r\nviolent bursts of jealousy by which he was at times agitated; but he was\r\never ready to perceive that there was no foundation to justify them. It\r\nwas during one of their separations, that the insinuations of those\r\nabout Napoleon excited his jealousy to such a degree, that he wrote a\r\nhasty letter to Josephine, accusing her of _coquetry_, and of evidently\r\npreferring the society of men to those of her own sex.\r\n\r\n\"The ladies,\" she says, in her reply, \"are filled with fear and\r\nlamentations for those who serve under you; the gentlemen eagerly\r\ncompliment me on your success, and speak of you in a manner that\r\ndelights me. My aunt and those about me can tell you, ungrateful as you\r\nare, whether _I have been coquetting with any body_. These are your\r\nwords, and they would be hateful to me, were I not certain you see\r\nalready that they are unjust, and are sorry for having written them.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon's brothers strove to alienate his affections from Josephine;\r\nbut the intense agony which he suffered when suspicion was awakened,\r\nmust have proved to them how deep these affections were. Perhaps no\r\ntrait in Josephine's character exalts it more than her conduct to the\r\nfamily who had endeavored to injure her in the most tender point. She\r\noften was the means of making peace between Napoleon and different\r\nmembers of his family with whom he was displeased. Even after the\r\nseparation which they had been instrumental in effecting, she still\r\nexerted that influence which she never lost, to reconcile differences\r\nwhich arose between them. Napoleon could never long mistrust her\r\ngenerous and tender feelings, and the intimate knowledge of such a\r\ndisposition every day increased his love; she was not only the object of\r\nhis fondest affection, but he believed her to be in some mysterious\r\nmanner connected with his destiny; a belief which chimed in with the\r\npopular superstition by which she was regarded as his good genius,--a\r\nsuperstition which took still deeper hold of the public mind when days\r\nof disaster came, whose date commenced in no long time after the\r\nseparation. The apparently accidental circumstance by which Josephine\r\nhad escaped the explosion of the infernal machine was construed by many\r\nas a direct interposition of Providence in favor of _Napoleon's Guardian\r\nAngel_.\r\n\r\nIt was just as she was stepping into her carriage, which was to follow\r\nclosely that of the First Consul to the theatre, that General Rapp, who\r\nhad always before appeared utterly unobservant of ladies' dress,\r\nremarked to Josephine that the pattern of the shawl did not match her\r\ndress. She returned to the house, and ran up to her apartment to change\r\nit for another. The delay did not occupy more than three minutes, but\r\nthey sufficed to save her life. Napoleon's carriage just cleared the\r\nexplosion. Had Josephine been close behind, nothing could have saved\r\nher. In the happy days of love and confidence, Malmaison was the scene\r\nof great enjoyment: the hand of taste could be discerned in all its\r\nembellishments. Napoleon preferred it to any other residence. When he\r\narrived there from the Luxembourg or the Tuileries, he was wild with\r\ndelight, like a school-boy let loose from school. Every thing enchanted\r\nhim, but most of all, perhaps, the chimes of the village church-bells.\r\nIt may have been partly owing to the associations which they awakened.\r\nHe would stop in his rambles if he heard them, lest his footfall should\r\ndrown the sound--he would remain as if entranced, in a kind of ecstasy,\r\ntill they ceased. \"Ah! how they remind me of the first years I spent at\r\nBrienne!\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon added considerably to the domain of Malmaison by purchasing the\r\nnoble woods of Butard, which joined it. He was in a perfect ecstasy with\r\nthe improvement; and, in a few days after the purchase was completed,\r\nproposed that they should all make a party to see it. Josephine put on\r\nher shawl, and, accompanied by her friends, set out. Napoleon, in a\r\nstate of enchantment, rode on before; but he would then gallop back, and\r\ntake Josephine's hand. He was compared to a child, who, in the eagerness\r\nof delight, flies back to his mother to impart his joy.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more agreeable than the society of Malmaison. Napoleon\r\ndisliked ceremony, and wished all his guests to be perfectly at their\r\nease. All his evenings were spent in Josephine's society, in which he\r\ndelighted. Both possessed the rare gift of conversational powers.\r\nGeneral information and exquisite taste were rendered doubly attractive\r\nby the winning manners and sweet voice of Josephine. As for Napoleon, he\r\nappeared to have an intuitive knowledge on all subjects. He was like an\r\ninspired person when seen amidst men of every age, and all professions.\r\nAll thronged round the pale, studious-looking young man--feeling that\r\n\"he was more fitted to give than to receive lessons.\" Argument with him\r\nalmost invariably ended by his opponent going over to his side. His tact\r\nwas such that he knew how to select the subject for discussion on which\r\nthe person with whom he conversed was best informed; and thus, from his\r\nearliest days, he increased his store of information, and gave infinite\r\npleasure by the interest which he took in the pursuits of those whom\r\nchance threw in his way. The delightful flow of his spirits showed how\r\nmuch he enjoyed the social evenings. He amused his guests in a thousand\r\nways. If he sat down to cards, he diverted them by pretending to cheat,\r\nwhich he might have done with impunity, as he never took his winnings.\r\nHe sometimes entertained them with tales composed on the moment. When\r\nthey were of ghosts and apparitions, he took care to tell them by a dim\r\nlight, and to preface them by some solemn and striking observation.\r\nPrivate theatricals sometimes made the entertainment of the evening.\r\nDifferent members of Napoleon's family and several of the guests\r\nperformed. The plays are described as having been acted to an audience\r\nof two or three hundred, and going off with great effect--every one,\r\nindeed, endeavored to acquit themselves to the best, of their ability,\r\nfor they knew they had a severe critic in Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe amiable and engaging manners of Napoleon and Josephine gave to\r\nMalmaison its greatest charm. The ready sympathy of Josephine with all\r\nwho were in sorrow, or any kind of distress, endeared her to every one.\r\nIf any among her domestics were ill, she was sure to visit the sick bed,\r\nand soothe the sufferer by her tenderness. Indeed, her sympathy was\r\noften known to bring relief when other means had failed. She was deeply\r\naffected by the calamity of M. Decrest. He had lost his only son\r\nsuddenly by a fatal accident. The young man had been on the eve of\r\nmarriage, and all his family were busy in making preparations for the\r\njoyful occasion, when news of his death was brought. The poor father\r\nremained in a state of nearly complete stupor from the moment of the\r\nmelancholy intelligence. All attempts to rouse him were unavailing. When\r\nJosephine was made acquainted with his alarming state, she lost not a\r\nmoment in hurrying to him: and leading his little daughter by the hand,\r\nand taking his infant in her arms, she threw herself, with his two\r\nremaining children, at his feet. The afflicted man burst into tears, and\r\nnature found a salutary relief, which saved his life. In such acts\r\nJosephine was continually engaged. Nothing could withdraw her mind from\r\nthe claims of the unfortunate. Her tender respect for the feelings of\r\nothers was never laid aside; and with those who strove to please her she\r\nwas always pleased. On one occasion, when the ladies about her could not\r\nrestrain their laughter at the discordant music made by an itinerant\r\nmusician, who had requested permission to play before her, she preserved\r\na becoming gravity, and encouraged, and thanked, and rewarded the poor\r\nman. \"He did his best to gratify us,\" she said, when he was gone; \"I\r\nthink it was my duty not only to avoid hurting his feelings, but to\r\nthank and reward him for the trouble which he took to give pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the lessons which she impressed upon her children. She often\r\ntalked with them of the privations of other days, and charged them never\r\nto forget those days amidst the smiles of fortune which they now\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nJosephine saw with great uneasiness the probable elevation of the First\r\nConsul to the throne. She felt that it would bring danger to him, and\r\nruin to herself; for she had discernment enough to anticipate that she\r\nwould be sacrificed to the ambition of those who wished to establish an\r\nhereditary right to the throne of the empire. Every step of his\r\nadvancing power caused her deep anxiety. \"The real enemies of\r\nBonaparte,\" she said to Raderer, as Alison tells, \"the real enemies of\r\nBonaparte are those who put into his head ideas of hereditary\r\nsuccession, dynasty, divorce, and marriage. I do not approve the\r\nprojects of Napoleon,\" she added. \"I have often told him so. He hears me\r\nwith attention, but I can plainly see that I make no impression. The\r\nflatterers who surround him soon obliterate all I have said.\" She strove\r\nto restrain his desire of conquest, by urging on him continually a far\r\ngreater object--that of rendering France happy by encouraging her\r\nindustry and protecting her agriculture. In a long letter, in which she\r\nearnestly expostulates with him on the subject, she turns to herself in\r\naffecting terms: \"Will not the throne,\" she says, \"inspire you with the\r\nwish to contract new alliances? Will you not seek to support your power\r\nby new family connections? Alas! whatever these connections may be, will\r\nthey compensate for those which were first knit by corresponding\r\nfitness, and which affection promised to perpetuate?\" So far, indeed,\r\nfrom feeling elated by her own elevation to a throne, she regretted it\r\nwith deep melancholy. \"The assumption of the throne,\" she looked on as\r\n\"an act that must ever be an ineffaceable blot upon Napoleon's name.\" It\r\nhas been asserted by her friends that she never recovered her spirits\r\nafter. The pomps and ceremonies, too, attendant on the imperial state,\r\nmust have been distasteful to one who loved the retirement of home, and\r\nhated every kind of restraint and ostentation.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Napoleon became Emperor he lavished the greatest\r\nhonors on the children of Josephine. Her daughter Hortense received the\r\nhand of Louis Bonaparte, and the crown of Holland. Eugene, his first\r\nacquaintance of the family and especial favorite, obtained the rank of\r\ncolonel, and was adopted as one of the imperial family; and the son of\r\nHortense and Louis was adopted as heir to the throne of France. The\r\ncoronation took place at Notre Dame, with all the show and pomp of which\r\nthe French are so fond. When the papal benediction was pronounced,\r\nNapoleon placed the crown on his head with his own hands. He then turned\r\nto Josephine who knelt before him, and there was an affectionate\r\nplayfulness in the manner in which he took pains to arrange it, as he\r\nplaced the crown upon her head. It seemed at that moment as if he forgot\r\nthe presence of all but her. After putting on the crown, he raised it,\r\nand placing it more lightly on, regarded her the while with looks of\r\nfond admiration. On the morning of the coronation, Napoleon had sent for\r\nRaguideau the notary, who little thought that he had been summoned into\r\nthe august presence to be reminded of what had passed on the occasion of\r\ntheir last meeting, and of which he had no idea the Emperor was in\r\npossession. While Napoleon had been paying his addresses to Josephine,\r\nthey walked arm in arm to the notary's, for neither of them could boast\r\nof a carriage. \"You are a great fool,\" replied the notary to Josephine,\r\nwho had just communicated her intention of marrying the young\r\nofficer--\"you are a great fool, and you will live to repent it. You are\r\nabout to marry a man who has nothing but his cloak and his sword.\"\r\nNapoleon, who was waiting in the antechamber, overheard these words, but\r\nnever spoke of them to any one. \"Now,\" said Napoleon, with a smile,\r\naddressing the old man, who had been ushered into his presence--\"now,\r\nwhat say you, Raguideau, have I nothing but my cloak and sword?\" The\r\nEmpress and the notary both stood amazed at this first intimation that\r\nthe warning had been overheard.\r\n\r\nThe following year, the magnificent coronation at Milan took place,\r\nsurpassing, if possible, in grandeur that at Paris. Amidst the\r\ngorgeousness of that spectacle, however, there were few by whom it was\r\nnot forgotten in the far deeper interest which the principal actors in\r\nthe scene inspired. Amidst the blaze of beauty and of jewels, and the\r\nstrains of music, by which he was surrounded, what were the feelings of\r\nNapoleon, as he held within his grasp the iron crown of Charlemagne,\r\nwhich had reposed in the treasury of Monza for a thousand years, and for\r\nwhich he had so ardently longed. Even at that moment when he placed it\r\non his own head, were the aspirings of the ambitious spirit\r\nsatisfied?--or were not his thoughts taking a wider range of conquest\r\nthan he had yet achieved? And for her, who knelt at his feet, about to\r\nreceive the highest honor that mortal hands can confer--did the pomp and\r\ncircumstance of that scene, and the glory of the crown, satisfy her\r\nloving heart? Ah, surely no! It was away in the sweet retirement of\r\nMalmaison--amidst the scenes hallowed by Napoleon's early affection. And\r\nhow few years were to elapse ere the crown just placed on the head of\r\nJosephine was to be transferred to another?--when the place which\r\nshe--the loving and beloved--occupied by her husband's side was to be\r\nfilled by another? Though doubts had arisen in her mind--though she knew\r\nthe influence of those who feared the sceptre might pass into the hands\r\nof another dynasty--still, the hope never forsook her, that affection\r\nwould triumph over ambition, till Napoleon himself communicated the\r\ncruel determination. With what abandonment of self she was wont to cast\r\nher whole dependence on Napoleon, may be seen in a letter addressed to\r\nPope Pius VII. In it she says: \"My first sentiment--one to which all\r\nothers are subservient--is a conviction of my own weakness and\r\nincapacity. Of myself I am but little; or, to speak more correctly, my\r\nonly value is derived from the extraordinary man to whom I am united.\r\nThis inward conviction, which occasionally humbles my pride, eventually\r\naffords me some encouragement, when I calmly reflect. I whisper to\r\nmyself, that the arm under which the whole earth is made to tremble, may\r\nwell support my weakness.\"\r\n\r\nHortense's promising child was dead; Napoleon and Josephine had shed\r\nbitter tears together over the early grave of their little favorite; and\r\nthere was now not even a nominal heir to the throne. The machinations of\r\nthe designing were in active motion. Lucien introduced the subject, and\r\nsaid to Josephine that it was absolutely necessary for the satisfaction\r\nof the nation that Napoleon should have a son, and asked whether she\r\nwould pass off an illegitimate one as her own. This proposal she refused\r\nwith the utmost indignation, preferring any alternative to one so\r\ndisgraceful.\r\n\r\nOn Napoleon's return from the battle of Wagram, Josephine hastened to\r\nwelcome him. After the first warm greetings and tender embraces, she\r\nperceived that something weighed upon his mind. The restraint and\r\nembarrassment of his manner filled her with dread. For fifteen days she\r\nwas a prey to the most cruel suspense, yet she dreaded its termination\r\nby a disclosure fatal to her happiness. Napoleon, who loved her so much,\r\nand who had hitherto looked to her alone for all his domestic felicity,\r\nhimself felt all the severity of the blow, which he was about to\r\ninflict. The day at length came, and it is thus affectingly described by\r\nMr. Alison:\r\n\r\n     \"They dined together as usual, but neither spoke a word\r\n     during the repast; their eyes were averted as soon as they\r\n     met, but the countenance of both revealed the mortal anguish\r\n     of their minds. When it was over, he dismissed the\r\n     attendants, and approaching the Empress with a trembling\r\n     step, took her hand, and laid it upon his heart.\r\n     'Josephine,' said he, 'my good Josephine, you know how I\r\n     have loved you; it is to you alone that I owe the few\r\n     moments of happiness I have known in the world. Josephine,\r\n     my destiny is more powerful than my will; my dearest\r\n     affections must yield to the interests of France.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Say no more,' cried the Empress, 'I expected this; I\r\n     understand and feel for you, but the stroke is not the less\r\n     mortal.' With these words, she uttered piercing shrieks, and\r\n     fell down in a swoon.\r\n\r\n     \"Doctor Corvisart was at hand to render assistance, and she\r\n     was restored to a sense of her wretchedness in her own\r\n     apartment. The Emperor came to see her in the evening, but\r\n     she could hardly bear the emotion occasioned by his\r\n     appearance.\"\r\n\r\nLittle did Napoleon think, when he was making a sacrifice of all the\r\n'happiness which he had known in the world,' that the ambitious views\r\nfor which it was relinquished would fade away ere five years ran their\r\ncourse. What strange destinies do men carve out for themselves! what\r\nsacrifices are they ever making of felicity and of real good, in the\r\npursuit of some phantom which is sure to elude their grasp! How many\r\nEdens have been forfeited by madness and by folly, since the first pair\r\nwere expelled from Paradise!\r\n\r\nIt was not without an effort on her part to turn Napoleon from a purpose\r\nso agonizing to them both, that Josephine gave up all hope. In about a\r\nmonth after the disclosure, a painful task devolved on the imperial\r\nfamily. The motives for the divorce were to be stated in public, and the\r\nheart-stricken Josephine was to subscribe to its necessity in presence\r\nof the nation. In conformity with the magnanimous resolve of making so\r\ngreat a sacrifice for the advantage of the empire, it was expedient that\r\nan equanimity of deportment should be assumed. The scene which took\r\nplace could never be forgotten by those who witnessed it. Napoleon stood\r\npale and immovable as a statue, showing in the very stillness of his air\r\nand countenance a deep emotion. Josephine and Hortense alone appeared\r\ndivested of every ornament, while those about them sparkled in all the\r\nsplendor of court costume. Every eye was directed to Josephine, as with\r\nslow steps she reached the seat which had been prepared for her. She\r\ntook it with her accustomed grace, and preserved throughout a dignified\r\ncomposure. Hortense stood weeping behind her chair, and poor Eugene was\r\nnearly overcome by agitation, as the act of separation was read;\r\nNapoleon declared that it was in consideration of the interests of the\r\nmonarchy and the wishes of his people that there should be an heir to\r\nthe throne, that he was induced \"to sacrifice the sweetest affections of\r\nhis heart.\" \"God knows,\" said he, \"what such a determination has cost my\r\nheart.\" Of Josephine he spoke with the tenderest affection and respect.\r\n\"She has embellished fifteen years of my life; the remembrance of them\r\nwill be for ever engraven on my heart.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was Josephine's turn to speak, though tears were in her eyes,\r\nand though her voice faltered, the dignity of all she uttered impressed\r\nevery one who was present. \"I respond to all the sentiments of the\r\nEmperor,\" she said, \"in consenting to the dissolution of a marriage\r\nwhich henceforth is an obstacle to the happiness of France, by depriving\r\nit of the blessing of being one day governed by the descendants of that\r\ngreat man, evidently raised up by Providence to efface the evils of a\r\nterrible revolution, and restore the altar, the throne, and social\r\norder. I know,\" she went on to say, \"what this act, commanded by policy\r\nand exalted interests, has cost his heart; but we both glory in the\r\nsacrifice which we make to the good of our country. I feel elevated by\r\ngiving the greatest proof of attachment and devotion _that ever was\r\ngiven upon earth_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not till Josephine heard the fatal words which were to part her\r\nfrom the object of her affection for ever, that her courage seemed for a\r\nmoment to forsake her; but hastily brushing away her tears that forced\r\ntheir way, she took the pen which was handed to her, and signed the act;\r\nthen taking the arm of Hortense, and followed by Eugene, she left the\r\nsaloon, and hurried to her own apartment, where she shut herself up\r\nalone for the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that, notwithstanding the courage with which the\r\nimperial family came forward before the public on this occasion, they\r\ngave way to the most passionable grief in private. Napoleon had retired\r\nfor the night, and had gone to his bed in silence and sadness, when the\r\nprivate door opened, and Josephine appeared. Her hair fell in wild\r\ndisorder, and her countenance bore the impress of an incurable grief.\r\nShe advanced with a faltering step; then paused; and bursting into an\r\nagony of tears, threw herself on Napoleon's neck, and sobbed as if her\r\nheart were breaking. He tried to console her, but his own tears fell\r\nfast with hers. A few broken words--a last embrace--and they parted. The\r\nnext morning, the whole household assembled to pay the last tribute of\r\nrespect to a mistress whom they loved and revered. With streaming eyes,\r\nthey saw her pass the gates of the Tuileries, never to return.\r\n\r\nThe feelings with which Josephine took up her residence at Malmaison,\r\namidst the scenes so dear to her, may be conceived; but true to the\r\nwishes of the Emperor, and to the dictates of her own elevated mind, she\r\nbore up under her trying situation with exemplary dignity; but grief had\r\ndone its part; and no one could look into her face, or meet the sweet\r\nmelancholy smile with which she welcomed them, without being moved.\r\nHappy days, which she had enjoyed amidst these scenes with many of those\r\nwho waited on her, were sadly contrasted with her forlorn feelings; and\r\nthough she strove to speak cheerfully, and never complained, the tears\r\nwhich she tried to check or to conceal would sometimes force their way.\r\nThe chief indulgence which she allowed her feelings was during those\r\nhours of the day when she shut herself up in Napoleon's cabinet; that\r\nchamber where so many moments of confidential intercourse had passed,\r\nand which she continued to hold so sacred, that scarcely any one but\r\nherself ever entered it. She would not suffer any thing to be moved\r\nsince Napoleon had occupied it. She would herself wipe away the dust,\r\nfearing that other hands might disturb what he had touched. The volume\r\nwhich he had been reading when last there lay on the table, open at the\r\npage at which he had last looked. The map was there, with all his\r\ntracings of some meditated route; the pen which had given permanence to\r\nsome passing thought lay beside it; articles of dress were on some of\r\nthe chairs; every thing looked as if he were about to enter.\r\n\r\nEven under the changed circumstances which brought Josephine back to\r\nMalmaison, her influence over Napoleon, which had been always powerful,\r\nwas not diminished. No estrangement took place between them. His visits\r\nto her were frequent, though her increased sadness was always observed\r\non those days when he made them. They corresponded to the last moment of\r\nher life. The letters which she received from him were her greatest\r\nsolace. It is thus she alludes to them in writing to him:--\"Continue to\r\nretain a kind recollection of your friend; give her the consolation of\r\noccasionally hearing from you, that you still preserve that attachment\r\nfor her which alone constitutes the happiness of her existence.\"\r\n\r\nThe nuptials of Napoleon and Marie Louise took place a very short time\r\nafter the divorce was ratified. Whatever the bitter feelings of\r\nJosephine might have been, they were not mingled with one ungenerous or\r\nunjust sentiment. No ill-feeling towards the new Empress was excited in\r\nher bosom by the rapturous greetings with which she was welcomed on her\r\narrival. \"Every one ought,\" said she, \"to endeavor to render France dear\r\nto an Empress who has left her native country to take up her abode among\r\nstrangers.\"\r\n\r\nBut however elevated above all the meaner passions, the affections of\r\nJosephine had received a wound from which they could never recover, and\r\nshe found it essential for any thing like peace of mind, to remove from\r\nscenes of former happiness. She retired to a noble mansion in Navarre,\r\nthe gift of Napoleon; and as he had made a most munificent settlement on\r\nher, she was able to follow the bent of her benevolent mind, and to pass\r\nher time in doing good. So far from feeling any mortification on the\r\nbirth of his son, she unfeignedly participated in the gratification\r\nwhich the Emperor felt, and she ever took the most lively interest in\r\nthe child. She was deeply affected when his birth was announced to her,\r\nand retired to her chamber to weep unseen; but no murmur mingled with\r\nthose natural tears.\r\n\r\nIt is rare to meet an example of one like Josephine, who has escaped the\r\nfaults which experience tells us beset the extremes of destiny. In all\r\nthe power and luxury of the highest elevation, no cold selfishness ever\r\nchilled the current of her generous feelings; for in the midst of\r\nprosperity her highest gratification was to serve her fellow-creatures,\r\nand in adverse circumstances, unspited at the world, such was still her\r\nsweetest solace. She was, indeed, so wonderfully sustained throughout\r\nall the changes and chances of her eventful life, that it needs no\r\nassurance to convince us that she must have sought for support beyond\r\nthis transitory scene.\r\n\r\nShe employed the peasantry about Navarre in making roads and other\r\nuseful works. Ever prompt in giving help to those in want, she chanced\r\nto meet one of the sisters of charity one day, seeking assistance for\r\nthe wounded who lay in a neighboring hospital. Josephine gave large\r\nrelief, promised to put all in train to have her supplied with linen for\r\nthe sick, and that she would help to prepare lint for their wounds. The\r\npetitioner pronounced a blessing on her, and went on her way, but turned\r\nback to ask the name of her benefactress; the answer was affecting--\"_I\r\nam poor Josephine._\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but that Napoleon's thoughts often turned with\r\ntenderness to the days that he had passed with Josephine. Proof was\r\ngiven of an unchanging attachment to her, in the favors which he\r\nlavished on those connected with her by relationship or affection. Among\r\nher friends was Mrs. Damer, so celebrated for her success in sculpture.\r\nShe had become acquainted with her while she was passing some time in\r\nParis. Charmed by Josephine's varied attractions, she delighted in her\r\nsociety, and they became fast friends; when parting, they promised never\r\nto forget each other. The first intimation which Mrs. Damer had of\r\nJosephine's second marriage was one day when a French gentleman waited\r\non her; he was the bearer of a most magnificent piece of porcelain and a\r\nletter, with which he had been charged for her by the wife of the First\r\nConsul. Great was her astonishment, when she opened the letter, to find\r\nthat it was indeed from the wife of the First Consul; no longer\r\nVicomtesse de Beauharnais, but her dear friend Josephine, who urged her,\r\nwith all the warmth of friendship, to pay her an immediate visit at\r\nParis. \"I do long,\" she added, \"to present my husband to you.\" Such a\r\ntempting invitation was gladly accepted, and she was received with joy\r\nby Napoleon and Josephine. In after years, she constantly recalled to\r\nmind the pleasures of that visit, with mingled feelings of melancholy\r\nand delight. The domestic scene left a lasting impression. Napoleon,\r\nalways so fascinating in conversation, made himself delightfully\r\nagreeable to her; he loved to talk with her of her art; and his\r\noriginality, enthusiasm, and taste gave an interest to every thing he\r\nsaid. He had a great admiration for Fox, and expressed a wish to have\r\nhis bust. When Mrs. Damer next visited Paris, she brought Fox's bust,\r\nbut Josephine's place was occupied by another. The Emperor saw her, and\r\nmet her with all the cordiality and kindness which the recollection of\r\nformer happy days, and her attachment to Josephine, were sure to\r\ninspire. At parting, he gave her a splendid snuff-box, with his\r\nlikeness set in diamonds. The box is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nIt was in her retirement at Navarre that Josephine wept bitterly over\r\nthe fallen fortunes of Napoleon. The Russian expedition caused her such\r\ndeep inquietude that her health and spirits visibly declined; she saw in\r\nit a disastrous fate for Napoleon, and trembled, too, for the safety of\r\nEugene, a son so dearly and so deservedly beloved, and who was, if\r\npossible, rendered still more precious, as the especial favorite of\r\nNapoleon, and as having been the means of introducing him to her.\r\nJosephine now scarcely joined her ladies, but would remain for the\r\nlength of the day alone in her chamber, by the large travelling-desk\r\nwhich contained Napoleon's letters. Among these there was one that she\r\nwas observed to read over and over again, and then to place in her\r\nbosom; it was the last that she had received; it was written from\r\nBrienne. A passage in it runs thus: \"On revisiting this spot, where I\r\npassed my youthful days, and contrasting the peaceful condition I then\r\nenjoyed with the state of terror and agitation to which my mind is now a\r\nprey, often have I addressed myself in these words: I have sought death\r\nin numberless engagements, I can no longer dread its approach; I should\r\nnow hail it as a boon. Nevertheless, I could still wish to see Josephine\r\nonce more--\" He again adds: \"Adieu, my dear Josephine; never dismiss\r\nfrom your recollection one who has never forgotten, and never will\r\nforget, you.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be needless to dwell on the rapid events which led to\r\nNapoleon's abdication, but it would be impossible, even in this\r\nimperfect sketch, not to be struck by the strange coincidences of\r\nJosephine's life,--twice married--twice escaped from a violent\r\ndeath--twice crowned--both husbands sought for a divorce--one husband\r\nwas executed--the other banished! One of Napoleon's first cares, in\r\nmaking his conditions when he abdicated, was an ample provision for\r\nJosephine; 40,000_l._ per annum was settled on her.\r\n\r\nIt was after Napoleon's departure from the shores of France, that the\r\nEmperor Alexander, touched with admiration of Josephine's character, and\r\nwith pity for her misfortunes, prevailed on her to return to Malmaison\r\nto see him there. The associations so linked with the spot that she had\r\nloved to beautify must, indeed, have been overpowering. It was there\r\nthat Napoleon's passionate attachment to her was formed. How many\r\nrecollections must have been awakened by the pleasure-grounds adorned\r\nwith the costly shrubs and plants which they had so often admired\r\n_together_; how many tears had afterwards fallen among them when the\r\nhours of separation came. The Emperor Alexander used every effort to\r\nconsole her, and promised his protection to her children, but sorrow had\r\ndone its part, and the memories of other times had their effect.\r\nJosephine fell sick; malignant sore throat was the form which disease\r\ntook, during the fatal illness of but a few days. Alexander was\r\nunremitting in his attentions; he again soothed the dying mother by the\r\nrenewal of his promise of care for her children, a promise most\r\nfaithfully kept. It was in the year 1814 that Napoleon left France for\r\nElba, and also that Josephine died. The bells to which they had loved to\r\nlisten together tolled her funeral knell. Her remains rest in the parish\r\nchurch of Ruel, near Malmaison. They were followed to the place of\r\ninterment by a great number of illustrious persons who were desirous of\r\npaying this parting token of respect to one so much loved and honored.\r\nUpwards of eight thousand of the neighboring peasantry joined the\r\nfuneral procession to pay their tribute of affection and veneration to\r\nher, who was justly called, '_the mother of the poor and distressed_.'\r\nThe tomb erected by her children marks the spot where she takes her\r\n'long last sleep.' It bears the simple inscription--\r\n\r\n    EUGENE ET HORTENSE A JOSEPHINE.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, too, paid a parting visit to the residence which he had\r\npreferred to every other. After his unsuccessful attempt to resume the\r\nsovereignty of France, he spent six days at Malmaison to muse over\r\ndeparted power and happiness, and then left the shores of France for\r\never!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[H] Josephine might afterwards have fulfilled this promise, had not\r\nMadame d'Aiguillon been a divorced wife, which excluded her from holding\r\nany situation about the Empress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Art Journal.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAVE OF GRACE AGUILAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Pilgrimages, pilgrimages!\" exclaimed a German friend whose family had\r\nbeen shorn of its \"olive branches\" by so many hurricanes, that, although\r\nstill in the prime of life, his head was bowed and his hair\r\ngray:--\"pilgrimages! what is life but a pilgrimage over graves?\" The\r\nolder we grow, the better we comprehend the force of this sad truth;\r\nlife is, indeed, a pilgrimage over graves; but how different are the\r\nideas and emotions they suggest or excite!\r\n\r\nIn pent-up cities the graves cluster round ancient churches:\r\ncongregations after congregations are pressed into festering earth until\r\nthe inclosure becomes a charnel-house; yet they prove how devoutly later\r\noccupants have longed to rest in death with the loved in life. The\r\nnameless mounds are hardly shrouded by broken turf; records, on the\r\ncankering, crumbling head-stones, are almost obliterated; some are\r\nclosely bordered and capped by heavy stones, as if rich inheritors\r\ndreaded a resurrection; others there are, where the dock and the nettle\r\nare matted around rusty railings, as though no hand remained that ever\r\npressed, in friendship or affection, the hand which moulders beneath;\r\nothers, again, are marked by broad head-stones, new and well-lettered,\r\nthe black on the pure white setting forth a proud array of virtues, of\r\nwhich the co-mates of the departed never heard; a few dingy and heavy\r\nmonuments stand apart, and look down with civic haughtiness on humbler\r\ngraves. Repulsive specimens of bad taste are these elaborate monuments\r\noften; in their ornaments so unmeaning, their clumsy dignity so\r\nintrusive, so coarsely ostentatious--the epitaphs so earnest in saying\r\n_by whom_ the carved stones were erected!\r\n\r\nOur village churchyards, lying away amid glorious trees, or tranquil\r\nvalleys, or sleeping on the sloping hills, where \"birds sing, lambs\r\nbleat, and ploughboys whistle,\"--however picturesque they may appear in\r\nthe distance, have frequently the same uncared for aspect as those\r\nwithin the city. We love the living, but we _seem_ to care little for\r\nthe dead. However much we may muse on crossing \"the churchyard,\" or\r\nindulge in poesy, where\r\n\r\n    \"The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep,\"\r\n\r\nour places of burial, with the exception of cemeteries, which are as yet\r\ntoo new to show what they may become, bear but slight testimony to the\r\n\"love which lives forever.\" The contrast is humiliating when we visit\r\nother lands, and mark the attention paid to graves of relatives and\r\nfriends. A certain sum is annually set apart by the peasants in many\r\ndistricts of France, for visiting and decking the resting-places of\r\nthose whom Death has taken; the fresh garland is hung on the simple\r\ncross, and the prayer earnestly repeated for the soul's peace; and these\r\ntributes continue for years and years, long after the bitterness of\r\nsorrow has passed away.\r\n\r\nWe have seen an aged woman, with white hair, strewing flowers on her\r\nmother's grave, though forty years had passed since the separation of\r\nthe living from the dead; and once, attracted by the beauty of a girl\r\nwho had been decking, and then praying, beside a nameless grave, we\r\nasked for whom she mourned--although the word \"mourned\" had little\r\nassociation with her bright face and sunny smile.\r\n\r\nShe answered, none of her people slept there; she had nothing of herself\r\nto do with graves; it was Marie's mother's grave, and Marie had gone far\r\naway--to England. Marie was her friend, and she had promised her that\r\nshe would deck that grave, and pray beside it; and all for the love she\r\nbore her friend. We asked if she was certain Marie would return:\r\n\r\n\"No, there was no certainty; but she would watch the grave, and deck it,\r\nand say the prayers Marie would have said, all the same; she loved\r\nMarie, and had promised her.\" There was something very tender in this\r\nfriendly fidelity, this tending the dead for the sake of the living--the\r\nliving, dead to her.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, the place of tombs has rarely been one of sorrow; we have\r\nloved to visit the last dwellings of those who have gone home before us.\r\nWe have thought of the enjoyment of re-union; and dwelt upon the delight\r\nof an eternity of harmony and love--that \"perfect love which casteth out\r\nfear.\" We have speculated on seeing Milton in the company of angels; on\r\nrecognizing Bunyan with the faithful; on beholding Fenelon at the \"right\r\nhand,\" and Mendelssohn among the chosen! Knowing that God is a more\r\nmerciful judge than man, we believe that there we shall see many faiths\r\nprostrate in adoration of the one great LORD, who is for all, and \"above\r\nall, and in us all.\" We have looked to the higher nature, the divine\r\nessence of those we have honored; and when noble deeds have been done,\r\nor lofty genius has triumphed, we have listened with more than doubt to\r\nthe insinuations of those who, in former, as in present times, aim to\r\ndetract from the excellence it is not given them to understand. We do\r\nnot cater for the prejudices of sects or parties, but simply desire to\r\nlay our tribute of homage on the graves of those who seem to us most\r\nworthy, and have been most useful. We have enjoyed the high privilege of\r\nknowing many remarkable people who have passed from among us during the\r\nlast twenty years,--having won for themselves a glorious immortality by\r\nthe exercise of talents which, in any other country, would have led to\r\nnational distinctions. Yet they are well remembered! and to them be\r\n_all_ the glory of success. The memory of these great lights,--great\r\nauthors, great statesmen, great philosophers, great warriors,--is still\r\n\r\n     \"Green in our souls.\"\r\n\r\nBut there were some stars of lesser magnitude, who, if longer spared\r\namong us, would have become luminaries of power; some who were summoned,\r\nwhen, according to our finite views, they had arrived at the period for\r\ntheir faculties to expand, and they were about to reap the harvest of\r\nlong years of labor and of care; such was Mrs. Fletcher, better known as\r\nMiss Jewsbury, one of the chosen friends of Mrs. Hemans, who passed away\r\nin a foreign land, far from all who loved her.\r\n\r\nAnd such was GRACE AGUILAR--a Jewess, of mind so elevated, heart so\r\npure, and principles so just and true, as to deserve a lofty seat among\r\nthose \"Women of Israel,\" whose lives were so beautifully rendered by her\r\ndelicate and powerful pen. It seems Quixotic in this day of sunshine, of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, to attempt to combat the prejudices which,\r\nwe are gravely told, do not now exist against the Jewish community; yet\r\nit is impossible to observe society, and not perceive that whatever\r\npolitical disabilities may be removed from them, individual prejudice\r\nagainst those from whom our blessed Saviour sprang, and who gave birth\r\nto the apostles of the Christian faith, is as deeply seated, as in the\r\ndays when faggot and fire were the ministers employed for their\r\nconversion.\r\n\r\nHow can it be that we, in our age, look down with cold or scornful eyes\r\nupon this once \"chosen people\"--chosen when the material world was in\r\nits youth--those children of Israel, whose history is the foundation of\r\nour faith? We read _our_ Bible, which is _their_ Bible; our code of\r\nconduct is based upon _their_ commandments, which are _our_\r\ncommandments; _our_ salvation is gained by the Jewish sacrifice of the\r\nlamb without spot or blemish; _our_ apostles, the promulgators of the\r\nfulfilment of the Old Testament prophecies, and the founders of the New,\r\nwere Jews. We are especially blessed in triumphing in a hope\r\nfulfilled--while to them the promise is yet to come; they linger and\r\nwait century after century for what they lost, and we won: this is their\r\nsorrow, and hard to bear is their punishment--but it should not detract\r\nfrom the honor and glory which was, and is, theirs from ages past. The\r\ncondemnation we give them is unworthy of us, and undeserved by\r\nthem--_They brought no wrath upon us by their blindness_; and we should\r\nremember the time will come when we shall be gathered--Jews and\r\nGentiles--together from the four quarters of the globe, from the east\r\nand from the west, from the north and from the south, \"And there shall\r\nbe one fold and one Shepherd.\" But of what do we, in these days, chiefly\r\naccuse the Jews?--of being a Mammon-making, and a Mammon-loving\r\npeople?--Ought we not to look to ourselves in that matter, and remember\r\nthe old saying about houses of glass, and throwing of stones? There are\r\nbut too many evidences of late before the world, of the Mammon-worship\r\nof _our own_ people, to render any bowing down to the molten image\r\nremarkable in the children of Israel; yet it is marvellous how those who\r\nthink and reason on all new things, give in to old prejudices without\r\nquestion or examination--clinging with childlike tenacity to foul\r\ntraditions, as if they were established truths.\r\n\r\nWe no longer politically outrage a people who have been, at all times,\r\nLOYAL, peaceable, and industrious; we do not confine them to any\r\nparticular quarter of our great city; nor drive them out of it like\r\nrabid dogs; we suffer them to make money and keep it, and we borrow it\r\nfor our own wants; we allow them to worship as they please--but denying\r\nthem a cordial fellowship with us, we restrict their improvement in all\r\nArts, but the one of money-making;--and they, unable to obtain\r\ndistinction except through their gold, naturally cling to that which\r\ngives them what all men covet--Power.\r\n\r\nAt our first introduction to Grace Aguilar we were struck, as much by\r\nthe earnestness and eloquence of her conversation, as by her delicate\r\nand lovely countenance. Her person and address were exceedingly\r\nprepossessing; her eyes, of the deep blue that look almost black in\r\nparticular lights; and her hair dark and abundant. There was no attempt\r\nat display; no affectation of learning; no desire to obtrude \"me and my\r\nbooks\" upon any one, or in any way: in all things she was graceful and\r\nwell-bred. You felt at once that she was a carefully educated\r\ngentlewoman, and if there was more warmth and cordiality of manner than\r\na stranger generally evinces on a first introduction, we remembered her\r\ndescent,[I] and that the tone of her studies, as well as her passionate\r\nlove of music and high musical attainments had increased her\r\nsensibility. When we came to know her better, we were charmed and\r\nastonished at her extensive reading; at her knowledge of foreign\r\nliterature, and actual learning--relieved by a refreshing pleasure in\r\njuvenile amusements. Each interview increased our friendship, and the\r\nquantity and quality of her acquirements commanded our admiration. She\r\nhad made acquaintance with the beauties of English nature during a long\r\nresidence in Devonshire; loved the country with her whole heart, and\r\nenriched her mind by the leisure it afforded. She had collected and\r\narranged conchological and mineralogical specimens to a considerable\r\nextent; loved flowers as only sensitive women can love them; and with\r\nall this was deeply read in theology and history. Whatever she knew she\r\nknew thoroughly; rising at six in the morning, and giving to each hour\r\nits employment; cultivating and exercising her home affections, and\r\nkeeping open heart for many friends. All these qualities were warmed by\r\na fervid enthusiasm for whatever was high and holy. She spurned all envy\r\nand uncharitableness, and rendered loving homage to whatever was great\r\nand good. It was difficult to induce her to speak of herself or of her\r\nown doings. After her death, it was deeply interesting to hear from the\r\none of all others who loved and knew her best (her mother), of the\r\nprogress of her mind from infancy to womanhood; it proved so\r\nconvincingly how richly she deserved the affection she inspired.\r\n\r\nGrace Aguilar, the only daughter of Emanuel and Sarah Aguilar, was born\r\nat the Paragon, in Hackney, in June 1816;[J] for eight years she was an\r\nonly child, and after that period had elapsed, two boys were added to\r\nthe family. Grace was of so fragile and delicate a constitution, that\r\nher parents took her to Hastings when she was four years old; and at\r\nthat early age she commenced collecting and arranging shells, learning\r\nto read, almost by intuition, and when asked to choose a gift, always\r\npreferring \"a book.\" These gift-books were not read and thrown aside,\r\nbut preserved with the greatest care, and frequently perused.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of seven years this extraordinary child kept a daily\r\njournal, jotting down what she saw, heard, and thought, with the most\r\nrigid regard to the truth; indeed, after visiting a new scene, her chief\r\ndelight was to read and ponder over whatever she could find relating to\r\nwhat she had observed. Her parents were both passionately fond of the\r\nbeauties of nature, and she enjoyed scenery with them, at an age when\r\nchildren are supposed to be incapable of much observation. Her mother, a\r\nhighly educated and accomplished woman, loved to direct her child's mind\r\nto the study of whatever was beautiful and true: before she completed\r\nher twelfth year she wrote a little drama called \"Gustavus Vasa;\" it was\r\nan indication of what, in after life, became her ruling passion.\r\n\r\nThe first history placed in her hand was that of Josephus; increasing,\r\nas it was certain to do, her interest in her own people. In 1828, after\r\nvarious English wanderings, the family, in consequence of Mr. Aguilar's\r\nimpaired health, went to reside in Devonshire. The beauty of the scenery\r\nwhich surrounds Tavistock inspired her first poetic effusions, and she\r\nbecame passionately fond of her new power; yet her well-regulated mind\r\nprevented her indulging in the exercise of this fascinating talent,\r\nuntil her daily duties and studies were performed.\r\n\r\nA life spent as was that of Grace Aguilar, affords little incident or\r\nvariety; it is simply a record of talents highly cultivated, of duties\r\naffectionately fulfilled, and, as years advanced, of the formation of a\r\ngreat purpose persevered in with stoic resolution, until, supported by\r\npillows, and shaken by intense suffering, the trembling fingers could no\r\nlonger hold the pen. It cannot fail to interest those at all acquainted\r\nwith her writings, to learn how she mingled the most intense faith and\r\ndevotion to her own people, with respect for the teachers of\r\nChristianity. Well as we knew her, we were quite unacquainted with her\r\nreligious habits; though the odor of sanctity exhaled from all she did\r\nand said, she never assumed to be holier than others; never sought\r\ndiscussion; never, in her intercourse with Christians, though sometimes\r\nsorely pressed, gave utterance to a hard word or an uncharitable\r\nfeeling; even when roused to plead with eloquent lips and tearful eyes\r\nthe cause of her beloved Israel.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful picture to look upon--this young and highly endowed\r\nJewish maiden, nurtured in the bosom of her own family, the beloved of\r\nher parents,--themselves high-class Hebrews,--gifted with tastes for the\r\nbeautiful in Art and Nature, and a sublime love for the true; leaving\r\nthe traffic of the busy city, content with a moderate competence,\r\nsoothed by the accomplishments, the graces and the devotion of that one\r\ncherished daughter, whose high pursuits and purposes never prevented the\r\ndaily and hourly exercise of those domestic duties and services, which\r\nthe increasing indisposition of her father demanded more and more.\r\n\r\nStimulated by the counsel of a judicious friend, who, while she admired\r\nthe varied talents of the young girl, saw, that for any _great purpose_,\r\nthey must be concentrated, Grace Aguilar prayed fervently to God that\r\nshe might be enabled to do something to elevate the character of her\r\npeople in the eyes of the Christian world, and--what was, and is, even\r\nmore important--in their own esteem. They had, she thought, been too\r\nlong satisfied to go on as they had gone during the days of their\r\ntribulation and persecution; content to amass wealth, without any\r\npurpose beyond its possession; she panted to set before them \"The\r\nRecords of Israel,\" to hold up to their admiration \"The Women of\r\nIsrael,\" those heroic women of whom any nation might be justly proud.\r\nHere was a grand purpose,--a purpose which made her heart beat high\r\nwithin her bosom. She knew she had to write _against_ popular feeling;\r\nshe had the still more bitter knowledge that the greater number of those\r\nfor whom she contended, cared little, and thought less, of the CAUSE to\r\nwhich she was devoted, heart and soul. But what large mind was ever\r\ndeterred from a great purpose by difficulties? The young Jewish girl,\r\nwith few, if any, literary connections; with limited knowledge as to how\r\nshe could set those things before the world; treasured up her intention\r\nfor a while, and then imparted it to that mother who she felt assured\r\nwould support her in whatever design was high and holy. Her mother\r\nexulted in her daughter's plan, and had faith in that daughter's power\r\nto work it out: she believed in her noble child, and thanked the God of\r\nIsrael, who had put the thought into her mind. Mrs. Aguilar knew that\r\nGrace had not made religion her study only for her own personal\r\nobservance and profit. She knew that she embraced its _principles_ in a\r\nwidely-extended and truly liberal sense; the good of her people was her\r\nfirst, but not her sole, object. The Hebrew mother had frequently wept\r\ntears of joy and gratitude when she observed how her beloved child\r\ncarried her practice of the holy and benevolent precepts of her faith\r\ninto every act of her daily life--doing all the good her limited means\r\npermitted--finding time, in the midst of her cherished studies, and\r\nstill more cherished domestic duties, and most varied occupations, to\r\nwork for and instruct her poor neighbors; and, while steadily venerating\r\nand adhering to her own faith, neither inquiring nor heeding the\r\nreligious opinions of the needy, whom she succored or consoled. Her\r\nyoung life had flowed on in bestowing and receiving blessings, and now,\r\nwhen her aspiring soul sought still higher objects, how could her\r\nmother, knowing her so well, doubt that she would falter or fail in her\r\nundertaking! Proofs have been for some time before the world that she\r\ndid neither.\r\n\r\nShe first translated a little work from the French, called \"Israel\r\nDefended;\" she tried her pinions in \"The Magic Wreath,\" and, feeling her\r\nmental strength, soared upwards in the cause of her people; she wrote\r\n\"Home Influence,\" and \"The Spirit of Judaism.\" But the triumphant spirit\r\nwas, ere long, clogged by the body's weakness. In the spring of 1838,\r\nshe was attacked by measles, and from that illness she never perfectly\r\nrecovered. Soon, she commenced the work that of itself is sufficient to\r\ncreate and crown a reputation--\"The Women of Israel.\" But while her\r\nmental powers increased in strength and activity, she became subject to\r\nrepeated attacks of bodily prostration; and her once round and graceful\r\nform was but a shadow. The physician recommended change of air and\r\nscene: and sometimes she rallied, but there was no permanent\r\nimprovement. Music was still, as it had ever been, her solace and\r\ndelight; but she was obliged to relinquish her practice of the harp, and\r\nto exercise her voice but seldom; still her spirit cried \"On, on,\" and\r\nevery hour she could command was devoted to her pen.\r\n\r\n\"The Records of Israel,\" \"The Women of Israel,\" and \"The Jewish Faith,\"\r\nseparately and together, show how, heart and soul, she labored in the\r\ncause she had so emphatically made her own. The first publication\r\nrelating so particularly to her own people, met with but a cool\r\nreception from the English Jews; but in America (where the Hebrews enjoy\r\nperfect equality with their Christian brethren) they hailed this rising\r\nstar with joy, and looked anxiously for its meridian. Letters and\r\ncongratulations came to her across the Atlantic; and those who had read\r\nonly her fugitive pieces, were astonished at the concentrated zeal and\r\npious energy which animated her when writing of the Hebrews.\r\n\r\nA little \"History of the English Jews,\" published by the Messrs.\r\nChambers, is perhaps superior to her other writings in style and\r\nfinish--the sentences are more condensed--the information more full of\r\ninterest. It was, we believe, her last labor of love, and she greatly\r\nrejoiced in its publication. When it was finished, she had resolved to\r\nvisit the German baths, and enjoy, as much as her increased debility\r\npermitted, the society of her eldest brother, who at the time was\r\nstudying music (the art in which he now so much excels) at Frankfort.\r\nHer youngest brother was at sea. There were times, even before her\r\ndeparture for Germany, that she felt as if her days were numbered; but\r\nthis feeling she studiously concealed from her mother, and bore her\r\nsufferings with the sweet and placid patience which rendered it a\r\nprivilege to see her and to hear her speak. At times she thought she\r\nmight be spared a little longer to comfort her mother, to witness the\r\ndistinction certain to reward her brother, and enjoy the reputation\r\nwhich now rushed upon her, especially from her own people, both here and\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nDevotedly attached to her friends, she bitterly regretted that she could\r\nnot take leave of them all; but her weakness increased daily; propped up\r\nby pillows she still continued to write, until her medical advisers\r\nexpressly commanded that she should abstain from this--her \"greatest and\r\nlast luxury.\" She obeyed, though expressing her conviction that writing\r\ndid her good, not harm; she frequently said that when oppressed by care,\r\nanxiety, and pain, her favorite pursuit drew her from herself, and she\r\nfirmly believed that writing relieved her headaches,--and this at a\r\nperiod when she had grown too ill even to listen to music. But, all--all\r\nher sufferings were borne with angelic patience, as the will of her\r\nHeavenly Father, and she would console her mother with words of\r\ncheerfulness and hope.\r\n\r\nWe have said her life had in it nothing to render it remarkable; surely,\r\nwe are in error, her patient, industrious, self-sacrificing life, was\r\nremarkable not only for its sanctity, its talent, and its high purpose,\r\nbut for its earnest and beautiful simplicity, and perfect _womanliness_.\r\n\r\nWhen the period of her departure for Germany had arrived, her friends\r\nfound it difficult to bid her farewell; for they thought it would be the\r\nlast time they should ever press her thin attenuated hand; but the\r\nbrightness of her eyes, the hopefulness of her smile, made them hope\r\nagainst hope. She left England on the 16th of June, 1847, lingered in\r\nthe brilliant city of Frankfort for a few weeks, and then went to the\r\nbaths at Langen Schwalback. She persevered in her use of the baths and\r\nmineral waters, but they afforded no relief; she was seized one night\r\nwith violent spasms, and the next day was removed to Frankfort.\r\nConvinced that recovery was now impossible, she calmly and collectedly\r\nawaited the coming of death: and though all power of speech was gone,\r\nshe was able to make her wants and wishes known by conversing on her\r\nfingers. Her great anxiety was to soothe her mother; though her tongue\r\nrefused to perform its office, those wasted fingers would entreat her to\r\nbe patient, and trust in God. She would name some cherished verse in the\r\nBible, or some dearly-loved psalm, that she desired might be read aloud.\r\nThe last time her fingers moved it was to spell upon them feebly,\r\n\"_Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him_;\" when they could no\r\nlonger perform her will, her loving eyes would seek her mother and then\r\nlook upwards, intimating that they should meet hereafter. Amen!\r\n\r\nHer death occasioned deep regret among the Hebrews both in Europe and\r\nAmerica: foreign tabernacles poured forth their lamentations, private\r\nfriends gave voice to their grief in prose and poetry, and the various\r\njournals of both hemispheres spoke of her with the respect and\r\nadmiration she deserved. But to those who really knew Grace Aguilar, all\r\neulogium falls short of her deserts; and she has left a blank in her\r\nparticular walk of literature, which we never expect to see filled up!\r\nHer loss to her own people is immense; she was a golden light between\r\nthe Christian and the Jew; respected and admired alike by both, she drew\r\neach in charity closer to the other; she was a proof, living and\r\nillustrious, of Jewish excellence and Jewish liberality, and loyalty,\r\nand intelligence. The sling of the son of Jesse was not wielded with\r\nmore power and effect against the scorner of his people, than was her\r\npen against the giant Prejudice.\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt more than may be thought necessary on Grace Aguilar's\r\nchampionship of her own people, because _that_ distinguishes her from\r\nall other female authors of our time; and when writing of the \"fold of\r\nJudah,\" there is a tone of feeling in all she has published which\r\nelevates and sustains her in a remarkable manner. In conversation, the\r\nmention of her people produced the same effect. Sometimes she seemed as\r\none inspired; and the intense brightness of her eyes, the deep tones of\r\nher voice, the natural and unaffected eloquence of her words, when\r\nreferring to the past history of the Jews,--and the positive radiance of\r\nher countenance when she spoke of the gathering of the tribes at\r\nJerusalem, could never be forgotten by those who knew this young Jewish\r\nlady. In time, as we have said, her own people estimated her as she\r\ndeserved. She received a very beautiful address from some of the \"women\r\nof Israel\" before she left this country for Germany. Among her works of\r\na more general nature, \"Home Influence\" is perhaps the most popular; and\r\nits sequel, \"The Mother's Recompense,\" though only lately published, was\r\nwritten as far back as the year 1836. \"The Vale of Cedars\" is a tale of\r\nJewish faith and Jewish suffering, founded on singular facts that came\r\nto her knowledge through some of her own people: the arrangement of the\r\nstory was difficult, as it is always difficult to embellish what is\r\nsimple and dignified, without destroying its effect and beauty--but, as\r\nwe have said, whenever Grace touched upon her own people, she wrote and\r\nspoke as one inspired; she condensed and spiritualized, and all her\r\nthoughts and feelings were steeped in the essence of celestial love and\r\ntruth. We are persuaded that had this young woman lived in the perilous\r\ntimes of persecution, she would have gone to the stake for her faith's\r\nsake, and died praying for her murderers. And this heroism was not only\r\nfor the great trials of life; she was also a heroine in her endurance of\r\nsmall sufferings, and petty annoyances, deeming it sinful to manifest\r\nimpatience, and thinking it right to be afflicted.\r\n\r\nGrace Aguilar had earnestly desired that we should have met her at\r\nFrankfort; and the only letter we received from her after her arrival\r\nthere, was full of the pleasant hope that we should meet again--in that\r\ncheerful city; this was however impossible; but when we knew that we\r\nshould see her no more in this world, we promised ourselves a pilgrimage\r\nto her grave: and over all the plans which mingled with our dreams of\r\nthe splendid churches and vast cathedrals we were to see in Germany,\r\nwould come a vision of Grace Aguilar's quiet grave in the Jewish\r\nburying-ground of Frankfort-on-the-Main; and all the reality of the\r\nanimated handsome city, its merchant palaces in the _Zeil_, and _Neue\r\nMainzer Strasse_, its old _Dom_, so full of interest, with its fine\r\nmonument of Rudolph of Sachsenhausen, beside which you cannot but recall\r\nthe time when St. Bernard preached the crusade within its walls,--not\r\neven when we stood alone beneath the roof of St. Leonhard's Church, and\r\nknew that there once stood the Palace of Charlemagne,--not there--nor\r\nanywhere--could we forget that we had vowed a pilgrimage to the grave of\r\n\"the lost star of the house of Judah.\"\r\n\r\nHow wild and inharmonious is the mingling of sights, as you whirl\r\nthrough continental cities! Heroic monuments--dark and deep\r\ndungeons--magnificent palaces--pictures--flowers--instruments of\r\ntorture--delicious operas--all crowded together into a few short days!\r\n\r\nWe had not failed to remember that the brilliant city of Frankfort was\r\nthe cradle of the Rothschilds; and it had been suggested that before we\r\nvisited the Jews' burying-ground, we should see \"The Jews' Quarter,\" to\r\nlook upon the house where the \"very rich man was born,\" and where his\r\nmother chose to live to the end of her many days, preferring, wise woman\r\nthat she was, to dwell to the last amongst her own people; yet living,\r\nwe believe, long enough to know that her grandson represented in\r\nParliament the first city of the modern world: and so became a practical\r\nillustration of the altered position of the Jews in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century--sheltered under the vine and fig-tree that\r\nflourishes in England.\r\n\r\nIn few of the German cities did the Jews endure more persecution than in\r\nthe _free_ city of Frankfort. During the past century the gates of the\r\nquarter to which they were confined, were closed upon them at an early\r\nhour, and egress and ingress were alike denied. In 1796 Marshal Jourdan,\r\nin bombarding the town, knocked down the gate of the Jews' quarter, and\r\nlaid several houses in ruin; they have not since been replaced. Another\r\ntyrannical law, not repealed until 1834, restricted the number of Hebrew\r\nmarriages in the city to thirteen yearly. It would seem, however, that,\r\nlike the mother of the Rothschilds, the people continue to dwell in\r\ntheir own quarter from choice, not necessity; and well it is for the\r\nlover of the picturesque and for the antiquary that they do so. A ramble\r\nin the Jews' quarter at Frankfort might well repay a journey from\r\nLondon; it is like going back to the fourteenth century, and meeting the\r\npeople you read of in history far gone. Imagine the narrowest possible\r\nstreets through which a carriage can drive, flanked at either side by\r\nhouses so high that the blue sky above becomes an idea rather than a\r\nreality; story after story, with windows of ancient construction, small\r\nand narrow, inclosed by iron gratings, from which frequently depended\r\nportions of many-colored draperies; garments for sale, which might have\r\nbeen of the spoil of the Egyptian; strong swords and all kinds of\r\nweapons, rust-worn; bunches of keys, whose handles would drive an\r\nantiquary distracted by their elaborate workmanship; dresses of all\r\ncountries and all fashions, fez caps, and old but costly turbans. The\r\nrich balconies of the most exquisite design, however time-worn; the\r\n_jalousies_, sometimes within, sometimes without the windows; the\r\nAtlantes, supporting entablatures; lost none of their effect from being\r\nhalf draped by a scarlet mantle or variegated scarf of Barbary. Numbers\r\nof the houses were profusely ornamented at intervals by ball-flowers in\r\nthe hollow mouldings, and balustrades, supporting carved copings. Then\r\nabove the doors, some of which evidently led to an inner court or a\r\nmysterious-looking passage, was inserted the most exquisitely wrought\r\niron-work, sufficiently beautiful to form a model for a Berlin bracelet;\r\nwhile from a stealthy passage peered forth the half shrouded face and\r\nilluminated eyes of dazzling brightness, of some ancient Jewess, whose\r\nlong, lean, yellow fingers grasped the strong, but exquisitely moulded\r\nhandle of the entrance. The doors (except the very modern ones) were all\r\nof great strength, frequently studded with nails, and the bolts, now\r\nworn and rusty, had withstood many a rude assault. We passed beneath\r\nsmall oriel windows, supported by richly carved stone brackets, gray and\r\nmouldering; and beside bay windows, of pure Gothic times; and when we\r\ngazed up--up--up--story after story, we saw what appeared to us more\r\nthan one Belvedere, doubtless erected by some wealthy Jew as a place\r\nfrom whence he could overlook the city it was forbidden him to tread, or\r\nto enjoy pure air, which certainly he could not do in the densely close\r\nstreet beneath. Many of the brackets supporting a solitary balcony were\r\nof beautiful design, though the greater number were defaced and\r\ncrumbling. We also passed several of the fan-shaped windows, so\r\ncharacteristic of the early German style, and here and there a quaint\r\nand fantastic _gurgoyle_; from the mouth of one depended a bunch of\r\nsoiled but many colored ribbons. What a vision it seems to us now--that\r\nwonderful Jews' quarter of the bright and busy city of Frankfort!--a\r\nvision of some far-off Oriental Pompeii, repeopled in a dream! Never did\r\nwe look upon faces so keen and withered, beards so black, or eyes so\r\nbright; once we saw a curly-headed child, half naked in its swarthy\r\nbeauty, throned, like a baby-king, upon a pile of yellow cushions; and\r\nonce again, as we drove slowly on, a tall young girl turned up a face of\r\nscornful beauty, as if she thought we pale-faced Christians had no\r\nbusiness there,--and those two young creatures were all we clearly\r\nobserved of youthful beauty within the \"Quarter.\"\r\n\r\nThe avenues in the outskirts of German towns contribute greatly to their\r\ninterest,--they protect from both sun and wind. We drove leisurely along\r\nthat which leads to the Cemetery of Frankfort, and turned up a narrower\r\nroad, that we might enter the walled-off portion of ground appropriated\r\nas the Jews' burying-ground. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the view\r\nfrom the gate of entrance. The city is spread out in the valley like a\r\npanorama; the brightest sunshine illumined the scene; a girl was seated\r\nbeneath the branches of a spreading tree in the distance; she was a\r\ngarland-weaver, and there she spent her days weaving garlands, which the\r\nliving bought from her to place on the graves of their departed friends.\r\nThe gates were open. Mrs. Aguilar had told us that HER grave was near\r\nthe wall of the Protestant burying-ground--and there we found it.\r\n\r\nThe head stone which marks the spot, bears upon it a butterfly and five\r\nstars, and beneath is the inscription:\r\n\r\n     \"Give her of the fruits of her hands, and let her own works\r\n     praise her in the gates.\"--PROV. Chap. xxxi., 31.\r\n\r\nOur pilgrimage was accomplished. It was, though in a foreign city, a\r\npilgrimage to an English Shrine--for it was to the grave of an English\r\nwoman--pure and good. On the 16th of September, 1847, at the early age\r\nof thirty-one, Grace Aguilar was laid in that cemetery, far from the\r\nEngland she loved so well--the bowl was broken, the silver cord was\r\nloosed!\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclude this tribute to the memory of one we loved,\r\nrespected, and admired, without extracting a portion of an address\r\npresented to her by several young Jewish ladies, before her departure\r\nfor Germany. Had the gift which accompanied it been of the richest and\r\nrarest jewels, and offered by the princes of this earthly world, it\r\ncould not have been as acceptable as it was, coming from the hearts and\r\nhands of the maidens of her own faith.\r\n\r\nWe would simply add that the address is a proof, if proof were needed,\r\nthat Jewish ladies not only feel and appreciate what is refined, and\r\nhigh, and holy, but know how to express their feelings beautifully and\r\nwell. Its orientalism does not detract from its pure and sweet\r\nsimplicity:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SISTER:--Our admiration of your talents, our\r\n     veneration for your character, our gratitude for the eminent\r\n     services your writings render our sex, our people, our\r\n     faith,--in which the sacred cause of true religion is\r\n     embodied, all these motives combine to induce us to intrude\r\n     on your presence, in order to give utterance to sentiments\r\n     which we are happy to feel, and delighted to express. Until\r\n     you arose, it has, in modern times, never been the case,\r\n     that a woman in Israel should stand forth, the public\r\n     advocate of the faith of Israel, that with the depth and\r\n     purity which is the treasure of woman, and the strength of\r\n     mind and extensive knowledge that form the pride of man, she\r\n     should call on her own to cherish, on others to respect, the\r\n     truth as it is in Israel. You, sister, have done this, and\r\n     more. You have taught us to know and appreciate our own\r\n     dignity; to feel and to prove that no female character can\r\n     be more pure than that of the Jewish maiden, none more pious\r\n     than that of the women in Israel. You have vindicated our\r\n     social and spiritual equality in the faith; you have, by\r\n     your excellent example, triumphantly refuted the aspersion\r\n     that the Jewish religion leaves unmoved the heart of the\r\n     Jewish woman,--while your writings place within our reach\r\n     those higher motives, those holier consolations, which flow\r\n     from the spirituality of our religion, which urge the soul\r\n     to commune with its Maker, and direct it to His grace and\r\n     His mercy, as the best guide and protector here and\r\n     hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nWe can say nothing of Grace Aguilar more eloquently or beautifully true;\r\nit is the just acknowledgment of a large debt from the Women of Israel\r\nto a holy and good sister, who, having done much to destroy prejudice,\r\nand to inculcate charity, merits the thanks of the true Christian as\r\nmuch as of the conscientious Jew.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] Grace Aguilar's family fled to England to escape Spanish and\r\nPortuguese persecutions, and some of them found homes and fortunes in\r\nthe West Indies. Her mother's name was Diaz Fernandes.\r\n\r\n[J] Her family were of the tribe of Judah. Of the original twelve tribes\r\ntwo only are at present are known: the tribe of Judah, the fourth son of\r\nJacob and Leah, and the tribe of Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob and\r\nRachel. The other tribes revolted from Rehoboam, A.M. 2964, when there\r\nwere two separate kingdoms, A.M. 3205, when the ten tribes were made\r\ncaptives by Shalmaneser, king of Assyria. The ten tribes have never\r\nsince been heard of; but the Israelites believe they are in existence,\r\nand will be gathered \"from all the nations whither the Lord our God hath\r\nscattered them.\" The Spanish and Portuguese Jews are of the tribe of\r\nJudah. The German Jews are of the tribe of Benjamin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Frazer's Magazine.\r\n\r\nTHE CLOISTER-LIFE OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V.--PART. II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be lodged in the monastic palace of Yuste was a distinction which\r\nqueen Mary of Hungary shared with one, and only one, of the visitors of\r\nher brother. The personage whom the imperial eremite delighted thus to\r\nhonor was Francisco Borja, who a few years before had exchanged his\r\ndukedom of Gandia for the robe of the order of Jesus. In his brilliant\r\nyouth, this remarkable man had been the star and pride of the nobility\r\nof Spain. Heir of a great and wealthy house, which was a branch of the\r\nroyal line of Aragon, and which had given two pontiffs to Rome, he was\r\ndistinguished no less by the favor of the emperor than by the splendor\r\nof his birth, the graces of his person, and the endowments of his mind.\r\nBorn to be a soldier and a courtier, he was also an accomplished\r\nscholar, and no inconsiderable statesman. He broke horses and trained\r\nhawks as well as the most expert master of the menage and the mews; he\r\ncomposed masses, which long kept their place in the cathedral-choirs of\r\nSpain; he was well versed in polite learning, and deeply read in the\r\nmathematics; he served in Africa and Italy with distinction; and as\r\nviceroy of Catalonia he displayed abilities for business and\r\nadministration which in a few years would have enabled him to rival the\r\nfame of Mendoza and De Lannoy. The pleasures and the honors of the\r\nworld, however, seemed, even from the first, to have but slender\r\nattraction for the man so rarely fitted to obtain them. In the midst of\r\nlife and its triumphs, his thoughts perpetually turned upon death and\r\nits mysteries. Ever punctilious in the performance of his religious\r\nduties, he early began to take delight in spiritual contemplation, and\r\nto discipline his mind by self-imposed penance. Even in his favorite\r\nsport of falconry, he sought occasion for self-punishment by resolutely\r\nfixing his eyes on the ground at the moment when he knew that his best\r\nhawk was about to stoop upon the heron. These tendencies were fixed by\r\nan incident which followed the death of the empress Isabella. As her\r\nmaster of the horse, it was Borja's duty to attend the body from Toledo\r\nto the chapel-royal of the cathedral of Granada, and to make oath of its\r\nidentity ere it was laid in the grave. But when the coffin was opened,\r\nand the cerements drawn aside, the progress of decay was found to have\r\nbeen so rapid, that the mild and lovely face of Isabella could no longer\r\nbe recognized by the most trusted and most faithful of her servants. His\r\nconscience would not allow him to swear, that the mass of corruption\r\nthus disclosed was the remains of his royal mistress, but only that\r\nhaving watched day and night beside it, he felt convinced that it was\r\nthe same form which he had seen wrapped in its shroud at Toledo. From\r\nthat moment, in the twenty-ninth year of his prosperous life, he\r\nresolved to spend what remained to him of time in earnest preparation\r\nfor eternity. A few years later, the death of his beautiful and\r\nexcellent wife strengthened his purpose, and snapped the dearest tie\r\nwhich bound him to the world. Having completed the Jesuits' college at\r\nGandia, their first establishment of that kind in Europe, and having\r\nmarried his son and his two daughters, he put his affairs in order and\r\nretired into the young and still struggling society of Ignatius Loyola.\r\nIn the year 1548, the thirty-eighth of his age, he ceased to be duke of\r\nGandia, and became father Francis of the Company of Jesus.\r\n\r\nBorja did not appear at Yuste as a chance or uninvited guest. Charles\r\nseems to have regarded him with an affection as strong as his cold\r\nnature was capable of entertaining. It was with no ordinary interest\r\nthat he watched the career of the man whom alone he had chosen to make\r\nthe confidant of his intended abdication, and who had unexpectedly\r\nforestalled him in the execution of the scheme. They were now in\r\ncircumstances in some respects similar, in others widely different. Both\r\nhad voluntarily descended from the eminence of their hereditary\r\nfortunes. Broken in health and spirits, the emperor had come to Yuste to\r\nrest and to die. The duke, on the other hand, in the full vigor of his\r\nage, had entered the humblest of the religious orders, to work out his\r\nsalvation in a course of self-denial and toil, ending only in the grave.\r\nHis career in the Company began with severe theological study, from\r\nwhich he passed to the pulpit and the professor's chair. As provincial\r\nof Aragon and Andalusia, he had been for some time laboring as a\r\npreacher, and teacher in various cities of Spain; he had founded\r\ncolleges at Plasencia and Seville; and he was now delivering lectures at\r\nAlcala, in the college which Jesuit energy soon raised to be the stately\r\npile which still forms one of the most prominent ruins of that Palmyra\r\nof universities.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been in the early spring of the year 1557, that the\r\nemperor determined to send for his old companion and counsellor. The\r\nmessage was conveyed to Alcala by a servant of the count of Oropesa.\r\nBorja at first excused himself, pleading ill-health and the duties of\r\nhis calling; and it was not until he had received a second summons, from\r\nthe mouth of the duke of Medina-Celi, that he consented to go to Yuste.\r\nOn the way he was met by a messenger, bearing a letter from the regent\r\nJuana, which advised him that her father's object in seeking an\r\ninterview was to persuade him to pass from the Company into the order of\r\nSt. Jerome. He arrived at the monastery early in December, attended by\r\ntwo brothers of the order, father Marcos, and father Bartolome\r\nBustamente, the latter known to fame as a scholar, and as architect of\r\nthe noble hospital of St. John Baptist at Toledo. The emperor not only\r\npaid his guest the unusual compliment of lodging him in his own\r\nquarters, but even busied himself in making preparations for his\r\nreception. To make his chamber as comfortable as conventual austerity\r\nwould permit, Luis Quixada had hung it with some tapestry which remained\r\nin the meagre imperial wardrobe. But this his master, judging that it\r\nwould rather offend than please the visitor, caused him to take down,\r\nsupplying its place with some black cloth, of which he despoiled the\r\nwalls of his own cell.\r\n\r\nThe royal recluse received the noble missionary with a cordiality which\r\nwas more foreign to his nature than to his habits, but which on this\r\noccasion was probably sincere. Both had withdrawn themselves from the\r\npomps and vanities of life; but, custom being stronger than reason or\r\nfaith, their greeting was as ceremonious as if it had been exchanged\r\nbeneath the canopy of state at Augsburg or Valladolid. Not only did the\r\nJesuit, lapsing into the grandee, kneel to kiss the hand of Charles, but\r\nhe even insisted on remaining upon his knees during the interview.\r\nCharles, who addressed him as duke, of course frequently entreated him\r\nto rise and be seated, but in vain. \"I humbly beg your majesty,\" said\r\nhe, \"to suffer me to continue kneeling; for I feel,\" he added, in a\r\nspirit of extravagant loyalty, \"as if, in the presence of your majesty,\r\nI were in the presence of God himself.\"\r\n\r\nBeing aware of his host's intentions with regard to himself and his\r\nhabit, he anticipated them, by asking permission to give an account of\r\nhis life since he made religious profession, and of the reasons which\r\nhad led him to join the Jesuits,--\"of which matters,\" he said, \"I will\r\nspeak to your majesty as I would speak to my Maker, who knows that all\r\nthat I am going to say is true.\" Leave being granted, he narrated, at\r\ngreat length, how, being resolved to enter a monastic order, he had\r\nprayed, and caused many masses to be said, for God's guidance in making\r\nhis choice; how, at first, he inclined to the rule of St. Francis, but\r\nfound that, whenever his thoughts went in that direction, he was seized\r\nwith an unaccountable melancholy; how he turned his eyes to the other\r\norders, one after another, and always with the same gloomy result; how,\r\non the contrary, when it at last occurred to him to join the Company,\r\nthe Lord had filled his soul with peace and joy; how it frequently\r\nhappened in the great orders that churchmen arrived at higher honors in\r\nthis life than if they had remained in the world, a chance which he\r\ndesired by all means to shun, and which was hardly offered in a recent\r\nand humble fraternity, still in the furnace of trial through which the\r\nothers had long ago passed; how the Company, by embracing in its scheme\r\nthe active as well as the contemplative life, provided for the spiritual\r\nwelfare of men of the most opposite characters, and of each man in the\r\nvarious stages of his mental being; and lastly, how he had submitted\r\nthese reasons to several grave and holy fathers of the other orders, and\r\nhad received their approval and blessing before he took the vows which\r\nfor ten years had been the hope and consolation of his life.\r\n\r\nThe emperor listened to this long narrative with attention, and\r\nexpressed his satisfaction at hearing his friend's history from his own\r\nlips. \"For,\" said he, \"I felt great surprise when I received at Augsburg\r\nyour letter from Rome, notifying the choice you had made of a religious\r\nbrotherhood. And I still think, that a man of your weight ought to have\r\nentered an order which had been approved by age rather than this new\r\none, in which no white hairs are found, and which besides, in some\r\nquarters, bears but an indifferent reputation.\" To this Borja replied,\r\nthat in all institutions, even in Christianity itself, the purest piety\r\nand the noblest zeal were to be found near the source; that had he been\r\naware of any evil in the Company, he would never have joined, or he\r\nwould already have quitted it; and that, in the matter of white hairs,\r\nthough it was hard to expect that the children should be old while the\r\nparent was still young, even these were not wanting, as might be seen in\r\nhis companion, the father Bustamente. That ecclesiastic, who had begun\r\nhis novitiate at the age of sixty, was accordingly called into the\r\npresence. The emperor at once recognized him as a priest who had been\r\nsent to his court at Naples, soon after the campaign of Tunis, charged\r\nwith an important mission by Cardinal Tavera, primate of Spain.\r\n\r\nThree hours of discourse with these able, earnest, and practised\r\nchampions of Jesuitism appear to have had their natural influence on the\r\nmind of Charles. He hated innovation with the hate of a king, a devotee,\r\nand an old man; and having fought for forty years a losing battle\r\nagainst the reform of the terrible monk of Saxony, he looked with\r\nsuspicion even upon the great orthodox movement, led by the soldier of\r\nGuipuzcoa. The infant Company, although, or perhaps because, in favor at\r\nthe Vatican, had gained no footing in the imperial court; and as its\r\nfame grew, the prelates around the throne, sons or friends of the\r\nancient orders, were more likely to remind their master, that its\r\ngeneral had been once admonished by the holy office of Toledo, than to\r\ndwell on his piety and eloquence, or on the splendid success of his\r\nmissions in the East. But from his ancient servant and brother in arms,\r\nin the quiet shades of Yuste, Charles heard a different tale, which\r\nseems to have changed his feelings towards the Jesuits, from distrust\r\nand dislike, to approval and friendly regard.\r\n\r\nSometimes the talk of the emperor and his guest was of old times, and of\r\ntheir former selves. \"Do you remember,\" said Charles, \"how I told you in\r\n1542, at Moncon,\" during the holding of the Cortes of Aragon, \"of my\r\nintention of abdicating the throne? I spoke of it to only one person\r\nbesides.\" The Jesuit replied that he had kept the secret truly, but that\r\nnow he hoped he might mention the mark of confidence with which he had\r\nbeen honored. \"Yes,\" said Charles; \"now that the thing is done, you may\r\nsay what you will.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the emperor's most curious and interesting revelations to Borja,\r\nwas the fact that he had composed memoirs of a part of his reign. He\r\nasked if the father thought that a man's writing an account of his own\r\nactions savored too much of vanity; and said, that he had drawn up a\r\nnotice of his various campaigns and travels, not with any view to\r\nvain-glory, but in order that the truth might be known; for he had\r\nobserved in the works of the historians of his time, that they were led\r\ninto error, as much by ignorance, as by passion and prejudice. What\r\njudgment Borja delivered upon this case of conscience does not appear.\r\nNor is the fate of the memoirs known. But the work cannot have been\r\nlarge, having been composed to beguile time spent in sailing down the\r\nRhine from Mayence. Van Male, to whose letters we owe our knowledge of\r\nthis fact, and who was employed to translate his master's French into\r\nLatin, praises the terseness and elegance of the style. This translation\r\nwas spoken of, in 1560, by Ruscelli, in a letter addressed to Philip\r\nII., as soon to be published; and Brantome wonders why so excellent a\r\nspeculation could have been neglected by the booksellers. It is plain,\r\ntherefore, that Borja is not to be blamed for the loss, if they are\r\nindeed lost, of the precious commentaries of the Caesar of Castile. And\r\nindeed, though a saint, and an advocate for the mortification of all\r\nworldly desires, he was hardly capable of advising the imperial author\r\nto put his manuscript in one of his Flemish fireplaces. The stern\r\nascetic had not quite cast off, or, at least, on occasion he could\r\nreassume, the ways and language of the insinuating chamberlain. To one\r\nof the devout queries of the emperor, he replied in a style of courtly\r\ngallantry, which sounds strange in the mouth of the friend of Francis\r\nXavier, and would have done honor to a later Jesuit, who labored in the\r\nvineyard of Versailles. Narrating the course of his penances and\r\nprayers, Charles asked him whether he could sleep with his clothes on;\r\n\"for, I must confess,\" added he, contritely, \"that my infirmities, which\r\nprevent me from doing many things of the kind that I would gladly do,\r\nrender this penance impossible in my case.\" Borja, who practised every\r\nkind of self-punishment, and had in early life in one year fasted down a\r\ncubit of his girth, eluded the question by an answer, which was perhaps\r\nas remarkable for modesty as for dexterity. \"Your majesty,\" said he,\r\n\"cannot sleep in your clothes, because you have watched so many nights\r\nin mail. Let us thank God that you have done more service by keeping\r\nthose vigils in arms, than many a cloistered monk who sleeps in his\r\nhair-shirt.\"\r\n\r\nThe new allegiance of the Jesuit did not permit him to spare more than\r\nthree days to his old master. Duty required him once more to take his\r\nstaff in his hand, and proceed on his visitation of the rising schools\r\nand colleges of the company. While at Yuste he had been treated with\r\nmarked distinction. Not only did his host arrange the upholstery of his\r\napartment, but he sent him each day the most approved dish from his own\r\ntable, the only part of his establishment which was somewhat removed\r\nfrom conventual meagerness. The honored guest set forth to Valladolid,\r\nwith the pleasing impression that he left regrets behind him; and he\r\nlikewise carried away two hundred ducats for alms, which Luis Quixada\r\nhad been directed to force upon his acceptance. \"It is a small sum,\"\r\nsaid the mayordomo; \"but in comparison with the present revenues of my\r\nlord the emperor, it is the largest bounty which he ever bestowed at one\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nJohn III., king of Portugal, dying on the 11th of June, 1557, state or\r\nfamily affairs required Charles to send a trusty messenger to his\r\nsister, the widowed queen Catherine. He immediately bethought him of his\r\ncousin and counsellor, the Jesuit, whose order had early gained the ear\r\nof the deceased monarch, and who himself enjoyed the friendship and\r\nconfidence of all that remained of the house of Avis. Borja received the\r\nsummons at Simancas, where he had founded a small establishment, and\r\nwhither he loved to escape from the court of Valladolid, to unstinted\r\npenance and prayer. The sun of July had begun to scorch the naked plains\r\nof the Duero, and the good father was in poor health. Nevertheless, he\r\nrepaired to Yuste and received his instructions; and then scorning\r\nrepose in the cool woodlands, at once took the road to Portugal across\r\nthe charred wastes of Estremadura. This haste, and the heat, threw him\r\ninto a fever, of which he nearly died in the city of Evora; and when\r\nonce more able to resume his journey, he was nearly lost, in a squall,\r\nin crossing the Tagus to Lisbon. His mission accomplished, he eluded the\r\nnursing of the queen and the Cardinal Henry, and hurried back to Yuste,\r\nwhere he probably arrived early in September.\r\n\r\nThe usual gracious reception awaited him. The nature of his business in\r\nPortugal has not been recorded by his biographers. But he seems to have\r\nconducted it to the emperor's satisfaction. It was on this occasion, or\r\nthe last, that Charles returned certain letters addressed to him, by\r\nFather Francis, on the politics and politicians of the day, and written\r\nat his request, and on condition of close secresy. \"You may be sure,\"\r\nsaid he, on restoring them, \"that no one but I have seen them.\" The\r\nconfidence thus reposed in the judgment and observation of the Jesuit,\r\nby the shrewdest prince of the age, shows how keenly the things of earth\r\nmay be scanned by eyes which seem wholly fixed on heaven.\r\n\r\nThe emperor likewise told him of a dispute between two nobles, which had\r\nbeen referred to him for decision, and on which he desired his opinion,\r\nbecause he probably knew on whose side the right lay. The dispute was\r\nabout a title to certain lands, and the parties were Borja's son,\r\nCharles, then duke of Gandia, and Don Alonso de Cardona, admiral of\r\nAragon. Thus appealed to, the father behaved with that stoical\r\nindifference to the voice of blood which somewhat shocked his lay\r\nadmirers, and commanded the loud applause of his reverend biographers.\r\n\"I know not,\" he said, \"whose cause is the just one; but I pray your\r\nmajesty not only not to allow the admiral to be wronged, but to show him\r\nall the favor compatible with equity.\" On the emperor's expressing some\r\nnot unnatural surprise, this Cato of the company offered the very poor\r\nexplanation of his request, that, perhaps, the admiral needed the\r\ndisputed lands more than the duke, and that it was good to assist the\r\nnecessitous.\r\n\r\nBorja paid a fourth and last visit in the following year, 1558, to the\r\nmonastery. He was sent for by the emperor for the benefit of his\r\nspiritual counsels, possibly after he had been attacked by his closing\r\nillness. For within a few days after the minister's return to\r\nValladolid, tidings reached the court that the invalid was no more.\r\nDuring his brief sojourn at Yuste, his holy conversation and example\r\nawakened the religious zeal of Magdalena de Ulloa, the wife of the\r\nmayordomo, Quixada. The good seed thus chance-sown by the wayside sprang\r\nup in after years, bearing abundant fruit for the company in the three\r\ncolleges founded and endowed by that devout lady at Villagarcia,\r\nSantander, and Oviedo. Almost a century after his visits, the fame of\r\nthe third general of the Jesuits lingered in the country around Yuste.\r\nIn 1650, the centenarian of Guijo, a neighboring village, used to tell\r\nhow he had seen the emperor and the Count of Oropesa on the road to\r\nXarandilla, and to point out a great tree, under which they had partaken\r\nof a repast, and he, a child, had been permitted to pick up the crumbs.\r\nBut of the individual impressions left on his memory by that remarkable\r\ngroup, none had endured for the third generation, except \"the meek and\r\npenitent face of him they called the saintly duke,\"--\"_el duque santo_.\"\r\n\r\nIn such occupations and in such companionship noiselessly glided away\r\nthe cloister life of Charles V. The benefit which his health had reaped\r\nfrom the fine air of Yuste, was but transient. It began to decline\r\nrapidly in the spring of 1558, after the death of queen Eleanor, to whom\r\nhe was tenderly attached. He caused funeral rites to be performed in her\r\nhonor, in the church of the monastery, with all the pomp of light and\r\nmusic that the brotherhood could command. Indeed, funeral services were,\r\nin some sort, the festivals of his lugubrious life; for whenever he\r\nreceived intelligence of the death of a prince of the blood, or a knight\r\nof the Golden Fleece, he caused his obsequies to be celebrated by the\r\nJeromites. He was also very mindful of the souls of his deceased\r\nfriends, and the masses which were offered day by day up for himself\r\nwere preceded by some for his father, his mother, and his wife.\r\n\r\nAs his infirmities increased, his prayers grew longer, and his penances\r\nmore severe. He wrapped his emaciated body in hair-cloth, and flogged it\r\nwith scourges, which were afterwards found in his cell, stained with his\r\nblood. Restless and sleepless, he would roam, ghost-like, through the\r\ncorridors of the convent, and call up the drowsy monks for the midnight\r\nservices of the church. Once he was asked by a slugglish novice, whose\r\nslumbers he had broken, why he could not be satisfied with turning the\r\nworld upside down, but must also disturb the peace and rest which it was\r\nreported he had come to seek at Yuste.\r\n\r\nFrom all secular things and persons he kept entirely aloof. Of the\r\nevents then passing in the world, nothing stirred his curiosity or his\r\ninterest but the ruthless crusade against heresy, led by Cardinal\r\nValdes, the fiercest inquisitor since the days of Torquemada. For the\r\ngreat northern Reformation had made itself felt, though with feeble and\r\ntransient effect, even in Spain,--as the Lisbon earthquake troubled the\r\nwaters of Lochlomond. Strange questions were stirred in the schools of\r\nAlcala and Salamanca; new doctrines were taught from the pulpits of\r\nSeville and Valladolid; wool-clad wolves were said to lurk even in the\r\nfolds of St. Francis and St. Dominic; and Lutheran traders ran casks of\r\nheretical tracts upon the shores of the bay of Cadiz. Amongst the\r\npersons arrested at Valladolid was Dr. Augustin Cazalla, canon of\r\nSalamanca, who had been one of the emperor's preachers, and as such, had\r\nresided, from 1546 to 1552, at the imperial court in Germany. Though he\r\nhad distinguished himself in the land of the Reformation by sermons\r\nagainst its doctrines, and had returned to Spain with untarnished\r\northodoxy, he was accused not only with being infected with Lutheran\r\nprinciples, but of having \"dogmatized,\" as the inquisition happily\r\ncalled preaching, in a conventicle at Valladolid. Charles was much moved\r\nwhen he heard of his arrest, not with pity for the probable fate of the\r\nman, but with horror of his crime. \"Father,\" said he to the prior, \"if\r\nthere be any thing which could drag me from this retreat, it would be to\r\naid in chastising heretics. For such creatures as these, however, this\r\nis not necessary; but I have written to the inquisition to burn them\r\nall, for none of them will ever become true Catholics, or are worthy to\r\nlive.\" This recommendation, seldom neglected, was exactly observed in\r\nthe case of the poor chaplain. Denying the offence of dogmatizing, he\r\nconfessed having held heretical opinions, and offered to abjure them.\r\nNevertheless he was \"relaxed,\" or in secular speech, burnt, with\r\nthirteen companions, at Valladolid, in the presence of the\r\nprincess-regent and her court.\r\n\r\nA more illustrious victim of the holy office was Constantine Ponce de la\r\nFuente, canon of Seville, and famous both as a pulpit orator, and as\r\nauthor of several theological works, which were much esteemed in Italy\r\nas well as Spain. He, too, had attended the emperor in Germany, as his\r\npreacher and almoner. For him Charles seemed to entertain more respect;\r\nfor upon hearing that he had been committed to the castle of Triana, he\r\nremarked, \"If Constantine is a heretic, he will prove a great one.\" The\r\ncanon's \"merits,\" for so the inquisition, with a sort of grim humor,\r\ncalled the acts or opinions which qualified a man for the stake, were\r\ncertain heretical treatises in his handwriting, which had been dug with\r\nhis other papers out of a wall. Confessing to the proscribed doctrines,\r\nbut refusing to name his disciples, he was thrown into a dungeon, damp\r\nand noisome as Jeremiah's pit, far below the level of the Guadalquivir,\r\nwhere a dysentery soon delivered him from his chains. \"Yet did not his\r\nbody,\" says the historian[K] of Spanish literature, writing several ages\r\nafter, with all the bitterness of a contemporary, \"for this escape the\r\navenging flames.\" His bones, and a carefully modelled effigy of him,\r\nwith outstretched arms, as he charmed the crowd from the pulpits of\r\nSeville, figured at the _auto-da-fe_ which, in 1560, illuminated the\r\nburning-place, the _quemadero_, of that city. Another sufferer there,\r\nFray Domingo de Guzman, was also known to the emperor. His arrest,\r\nhowever, merely drew from him the contemptuous remark, that fray Domingo\r\nmight have been shut up as much for idiocy as for heresy.\r\n\r\nIn looking back on the religious troubles of his reign, Charles bitterly\r\nregretted that he did not put Luther to death when he was in his power.\r\nHe had spared him, he said, on account of his pledged word, which,\r\nindeed, he would have been bound to respect had the offences of Luther\r\nmerely concerned his own authority; but he now saw that he had erred, in\r\npreferring the obligation of his promise to the greater duty of avenging\r\nupon that arch-heretic his offences against God. Had Luther been\r\nremoved, he conceived the plague might have been stayed: now, it was\r\ngoing on from bad to worse. He had some consolation, however, in\r\nrecollecting how steadily he refused to hear the points at issue argued\r\nin his presence. At this price he had declined to purchase the support\r\nof some of the protestant princes of the empire, when marching against\r\nthe duke of Saxony and the landgrave of Hesse; he had declined it even\r\nwhen flying, with only ten horsemen, before the army of duke Maurice. He\r\nknew how dangerous it was, especially for those who, like himself, had\r\nlittle learning, to parley with heretics, who were armed with reasons so\r\napt and so well ordered. Suppose one of their arguments had been planted\r\nin his soul; how did he know that he could ever have got it rooted out?\r\nSo have many better men of every form of faith learned to look upon\r\ntheir belief as something external to themselves, to be kept hid away in\r\nthe dark, lest, like ice, it should melt in the free air and light of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nThe grave was now in all his thoughts. One morning, his barber, a\r\nmalapert of the old comedies, ventured to ask him what he was thinking\r\nof. \"I am thinking,\" replied Charles, \"that I have here a sum of two\r\nthousand crowns, which I cannot employ better than in performing my\r\nfuneral.\" \"Do not let that trouble your Majesty,\" rejoined the fellow;\r\n\"if you die and we live, we will take care to bury you with all honors.\"\r\n\"You do not perceive, Nicolas,\" said the emperor, rather pursuing his\r\nown train of thought than replying to the barber, \"that it makes a\r\ndifference in a man's walking, if he holds the light before or behind\r\nhim.\" The same opinion had been held by a bishop of Liege, Cardinal\r\nErard de la Mark, whom Charles must have known, and whose example\r\nperhaps suggested the idea. For many years before 1558, the year of his\r\ndeath, did this prelate rehearse his obsequies, annually carrying his\r\ncoffin to the tomb which he had prepared for himself in his cathedral.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding on the step, however, the emperor determined to submit\r\nthe question to his confessor, Fray Juan de Regla. They had just been\r\nhearing the service for the souls of his parents and his wife. Speaking\r\nof such rites in general, he asked the friar if they were most effectual\r\nwhen performed before, or when performed after, death. Fray Juan, after\r\ndue deliberation, gave his verdict in favor of solemnities which\r\npreceded decease. \"Then,\" said the emperor, \"I will have my funeral\r\nperformed while I am still alive.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this celebrated service took place next day, being the 30th\r\nof August, 1558. So short a time being allowed for the preparations,\r\nthey cannot have severely drained the bag of dollars, which Nicholas the\r\nbarber wished to reserve for other purposes. A wooden monument, however,\r\nwas erected in the chapel in front of the high altar; the ornaments of\r\nthe convent were brought out and arranged to the best advantage; and the\r\nwhole was illuminated with a blaze of wax-lights. The household of the\r\nemperor, all in deep mourning attended; and thither Luis Quixada brought\r\nDon Juan, from his sports in the forest, to learn his first lesson of\r\nthe vanity of human greatness. \"The pious monarch himself,\" says the\r\nhistorian of the Jeromites, \"was there, in sable weeds, and bearing a\r\ntaper, to see himself interred, and to celebrate his own obsequies.\" And\r\nwhen the solemn mass for the defunct was sung, he came forward and gave\r\nhis taper into the hands of the officiating priest, in token of his\r\ndesire to yield his soul into the hands of his Maker. High above, over\r\nthe kneeling throng, and the gorgeous vestments, the flowers, and the\r\nincense, and the glittering altar--the same idea shone forth in that\r\nsplendid canvas of Titian, which pictured Charles kneeling on the\r\nthreshold of the heavenly mansion.\r\n\r\nWhen the dirge was sung, and the ceremonies over, and Charles had, as it\r\nwere, come back for a little while to life, he told his confessor that\r\nhe felt the better for being buried. Of a scene which might well have\r\nshaken the nerves of the boldest hunter on the Sierra, he said next day,\r\nthat it had filled his soul with joy and consolation that seemed to\r\nreact upon his body. That evening he caused to be brought, from the\r\nrepository where his few valuables were kept, a portrait of the empress,\r\nand hung for some time, lost in thought, over the gentle face, which, in\r\nits blue eyes, auburn hair, and pensive beauty, somewhat resembled the\r\nnoble countenance of that other Isabella, the great queen of Castile. He\r\nnext called for a picture of our Lord praying in the Garden; and after\r\nlong gazing, passed from that to a Last Judgment, by Titian. Perhaps\r\nthis was a sketch or small copy of the great altar-piece, or it may be\r\nthat he turned to the original itself, which could be seen by opening\r\nthe window, through which his bedchamber commanded a view of the altar.\r\nHaving looked his last upon the image of the wife of his youth; it\r\nseemed as if he were now bidding farewell, in the contemplation of this\r\nmasterpiece, to the noble art which he loved with a love that years, and\r\ncares, and sickness could not quench, and that will ever be remembered\r\nwith his better fame. He remained so long abstracted and motionless,\r\nthat the physician who was on the watch thought it right to awake him\r\nfrom his reverie. On being spoken to, he turned round and said, \"I feel\r\nmyself ill.\" The doctor felt his pulse, and pronounced him in a fever.\r\nHe was seated at the moment in the open gallery, to the west of his\r\napartments, into which the sinking sun poured his tempered splendor\r\nthrough the boughs of the great walnut-tree. From this pleasant spot,\r\nfilled with the fragrance of the garden and the murmur of the fountain,\r\nand bright with glimpses of the golden Vera, they carried him to the\r\ngloomy chamber of his sleepless nights, and laid him on the bed from\r\nwhich he was to rise no more.\r\n\r\nHis old enemy, the gout, had not troubled him for several days. The\r\ndisorder with which he was now attacked was a tertian fever, likewise a\r\nmalady familiar to his shattered frame. The fits now were of unusual\r\nviolence, the cold fit lasting twice as long as the hot. His physician\r\ntwice attempted to relieve him by bleeding, but the operation seemed\r\nrather to augment than allay the violence of the disease. Being sensible\r\nthat his hour was come, and wishing to add a codocil to his will, he\r\ndispatched a messenger to Valladolid, to the regent Juana, requiring an\r\nauthorization for his secretary Gaztelu to act as a notary for the\r\npurpose. The princess, seeing the imminence of the danger, along with\r\nthe authorization, instantly sent off her physician, Cornelio, to Yuste,\r\nwhile she herself prepared to follow. It is possible that she also sent\r\nfather Borja, to pay a last visit of consolation to his friend.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had made his will at Brussels, on the 6th of June, 1554. The\r\ncodocil is dated at Yuste, the 9th of September, 1558. From the great\r\nlength of this document, its minuteness, and the frequent recurrence of\r\nprovisions in case of his death before he should see his son, an event\r\nwhich now was beyond hope, it seems to have been prepared some time\r\nbefore. But as it must have been read to him before his trembling hand\r\naffixed the necessary signature, it remains as a proof that one of his\r\nlast acts was to urge Philip II., by his love and allegiance, and his\r\nhope of salvation, to take care that \"the heretics were repressed and\r\nchastised, with all publicity and rigor, as their faults deserved,\r\nwithout respect of persons, and without regard to any plea in their\r\nfavor.\" The rest of the paper is filled with directions for his funeral,\r\nand with a list of legacies to forty-eight servants, and many thoughtful\r\narrangements for the comfort of those who had followed him from\r\nFlanders. Though willing to send all his Protestant subjects to\r\nmartyrdom, he watched with fatherly kindness over the fortunes of his\r\ngrooms and scullions. It is said that Fray Juan de Regla proposed that\r\nDon Juan of Austria should be named in the will as next heir to the\r\ncrown after Philip, his sister, and his children; but if this incredible\r\nadvice were given by the confessor, the dying man had energy enough left\r\nto reject it with indignation.\r\n\r\nDay by day the tide of life continued to ebb with visible fall. The sick\r\nman, however, was still able to attend to his devotions, to confess, and\r\nto receive the sacrament. He would not allow his confessor, Regla, to be\r\nabsent from his bedside, and the poor man, who could hardly find a\r\nmoment for his repasts, was nearly worn out with incessant watching. On\r\nevery Sunday and feast day, at half-past three in the afternoon, the\r\nchaplain, Villalva, preached in the church, the window of the sick-room\r\nbeing left open, and the doors being shut to all but the friars. The\r\npatient likewise frequently caused passages of Scripture to be read to\r\nhim, and was never weary of hearing the psalm which begins, _Domine!\r\nrefugium factum es nobis_. On the 19th of September, towards evening,\r\nthe patient asked for the rite of extreme unction. By the desire of the\r\nprior, Luis Quixada, who was ever at his pillow, inquired whether he\r\nwould have it administered according to the form for friars, or after\r\nthe briefer fashion of the laity. He chose the former, in which the\r\nseven penitential psalms were read, as well as a litany and sundry\r\nprayers and verses of scripture. During the reading of the psalms, it\r\nwas observed that he joined in the responses of the monks with an\r\naudible voice. When the ceremony was over, instead of being exhausted,\r\nhe seemed to have been revived by it. His appetite for food having\r\nentirely failed him for some days, Quixada seized the opportunity of\r\nurging him to take some. \"Trouble me not, Luis Quixada,\" said he; \"my\r\nlife is going out of me, and I cannot eat.\" The next morning, the 20th,\r\nhe asked for the eucharist. His confessor told him that having received\r\nextreme unction, the other sacrament was unnecessary. \"It may not be\r\nnecessary,\" said the dying man; \"yet it is good company on so long a\r\njourney.\" His wish was accordingly complied with; the wafer was brought\r\nto his bedside, followed by the whole community in solemn procession,\r\nand he received it from the hands of his confessor with tears of\r\ndevotion, incessantly repeating the words of our Saviour, \"_In me manes,\r\nego in te maneam_.\" In spite of his extreme weakness, he remained for a\r\nquarter of an hour kneeling in his bed, and uttering devout\r\nejaculations, in praise of the blessed sacrament, which the simple\r\nfriars attributed to divine inspiration.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 19th of September, a remarkable visitor knocked at\r\nthe gate of Yuste. It was the new Archbishop of Toledo, Bartolome\r\nCarranza de Miranda--a name which stands high on the list of the Wolseys\r\nof the world, of men remembered less for their splendid success than for\r\ntheir signal fall. From a simple Dominican, he had risen to be a\r\nprofessor at Valladolid, a leading doctor of Trent, prior of Palencia,\r\nprovincial of Spain, and prime adviser of Philip II. in that movement\r\nwhich Spanish churchmen loved to call the reduction of England. During\r\nMary's reign, the ruthless black friar had been a mark for popular\r\nvengeance; and Oxford, Cambridge, and Lambeth, long remembered how he\r\nhad preached the sacrifice of the mass, dug up the bones of Bucer, and\r\npresided at the burning of Cranmer. For these services he had been\r\nrewarded by Philip II. with the richest see in Christendom; and he was\r\nnow on his way to take possession of the throne of Toledo, little\r\nthinking that his enemy, the inquisitor Valdes, was already preparing\r\nthe indictment which was to make his reign a long disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop was expected at Yuste. He had been long known to the\r\nEmperor, who had paved the way for his success by sending him to display\r\nhis lore at the council of Trent. Charles had afterwards offered him the\r\nPeruvian bishopric of Cuzco, the post of confessor to the heir-apparent\r\nof Spain, and lastly, the bishopric of the Canaries. His refusal of all\r\nthese pieces of preferment caused his patron some surprise, which was\r\nchanged into displeasure by his acceptance of the see of Toledo. Reports\r\nhad also got abroad, which cast a doubt on the orthodoxy of the new\r\nprelate,--of all doubts, as Charles thought, the gravest. He was anxious\r\nfor an opportunity of conversing with him, partly, it seems, to upbraid\r\nhim with his new honors, and partly in order to ascertain how far these\r\nreports were well founded. William, one of his barbers, related that he\r\nhad heard his majesty say, \"When I gave Carranza the bishopric of the\r\nCanaries, he refused it; now he accepts Toledo. We shall see what we are\r\nto think of his virtue.\" In this frame of mind, he had been expecting\r\nthe unconscious prelate for some time; these feelings of dislike being,\r\nno doubt, strengthened by his confessor, father Regla, a bitter enemy,\r\nand one of the foremost accusers of Carranza.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the ruin of this celebrated man was decreed\r\non evidence which would have been listened to only by a secret tribunal\r\nof unscrupulous enemies. It may be that some of his printed theology\r\ncontained--what theology does not?--passages capable of interpretations\r\nneither intended nor foreseen by the writer; it may be that he had\r\npillaged the writings of reformers, whose persons he would willingly\r\nhave given to the flames. But it is certain that he was a man of\r\nunambitious nature, of active benevolence, and, according to the notions\r\nof that age, of exemplary life; that he was a scholar and theologian of\r\npractised and consummate skill, a wary shepherd of the faithful, a\r\nrelentless butcher of heretics; that he carried his reluctance to the\r\nmitre so far beyond the bounds of decent clerical coyness, as to\r\nrecommend three eminent rivals to Philip II., as more fit and proper\r\nthan himself for the primacy; and that one of his first acts, as\r\narchbishop, was to advise the king to appropriate the revenues of a\r\ncanonry in every cathedral in Spain to the use of the Inquisition.\r\nSetting aside, therefore, the palpable personal hatred which betrayed\r\nitself in all the proceedings against him, it seems probable that he\r\nspoke the plain truth, when he made his dying declaration, that he had\r\nnever held any of the heretical opinions of which he had been accused.\r\n\r\nIn after days, when enduring the sickness of deferred hope in his prison\r\nat Valladolid or at Rome, the archbishop perhaps regarded it as one of\r\nthe mischances which marked the ebb of his fortunes, that he reached\r\nYuste too late either to explain to the emperor the circumstances of his\r\npromotion, or to remove the suspicion which had been cast on his faith.\r\nOn the evening of his arrival, Charles was too ill to receive him, and\r\nthe day following, although he was thrice admitted into the sick room,\r\nhe found occasion to utter only a few words. Those words, few and simple\r\nas they were, were some weeks after reported to the Holy Office, with,\r\nas it seems, gross exaggeration, by the confessor, father Regla.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of September, it was evident that the end was approaching.\r\nThe few friends of the emperor who lived in the neighborhood had\r\nassembled at the convent. The count of Oropesa was there from\r\nXarandilla, with several of the family of Toledo, and Don Luis de Avila\r\nhad come from Plasencia. They, and the prior and some of the monks, were\r\nfrequently in the sick-room, in which Quixada kept constant watch. The\r\npatient had hardly spoken during the whole day. In the afternoon, when\r\nOropesa introduced the archbishop, he merely told him to be seated, but\r\nwas unable to hold any conversation. Towards night he grew hourly worse.\r\nThe physicians, Mathesio and Cornelio, at last announced to the group\r\naround the bed, that the resources of their art were exhausted, and that\r\nall hope was over. Cornelio, the court doctor from Valladolid, then\r\nretired; Mathesio remained, feeling the pulse of the dying man, and\r\nsaying at intervals, \"His majesty has only two hours to live--only one\r\nhour--only half an hour.\" Charles meanwhile lay in a stupor, seemingly\r\nunconscious of what was going on around him, but now and then mumbling a\r\nprayer, and turning his eyes to heaven. At last he roused himself, and\r\npronounced the name of William Van Male. On the man's coming to his\r\nsupport, he leaned towards him, as if to obtain ease by a change of\r\nposture; at the same time uttering a groan of agony. The physician now\r\nlooked towards the door, and said to the archbishop, who was standing\r\nthere in the shade, \"_Domine! jam moritur_.\" The prelate approached, and\r\nknelt down by the bed, holding a crucifix in his hand, and saying in a\r\nloud tone, \"Behold him who answers for sin; sin is no more; all is\r\nforgiven!\" Sad and swarthy of visage, Carranza had also a hoarse,\r\ndisagreeable voice. On hearing it, the emperor gave signs of impatience\r\nso distinct, that the faithful Quixada thought it right to interfere and\r\nsay, \"Hark, my lord, you are disturbing his majesty.\" The archbishop\r\ntook the hint, and retired.\r\n\r\nIt was near two o'clock on the morning of the 21st of September, St.\r\nMatthew's day. Fray Francisco de Villalva, the favorite chaplain, now\r\npresented himself at the bedside. Addressing the dying man, he told him\r\nhow blessed a privilege he enjoyed in having been born on the day of St.\r\nMatthias, the apostle, who had been chosen by lot to complete the number\r\nof the twelve, and in being about to die on the day of St. Matthew, the\r\nevangelist, who, for Christ's sake, had forsaken wealth, as his majesty\r\nhad forsaken imperial power. For some time he continued to hold forth in\r\nthe same edifying strain. At length, Charles, rousing himself, said,\r\n\"The time is come, bring me the candle and the crucifix.\" These were\r\ncherished relics, which he had kept in reserve for this supreme hour.\r\nThe one was a taper from Our Lady's shrine at Monserrat; the other, a\r\ncrucifix of beautiful workmanship, which before had been taken from the\r\ndead hand of his mother Juana, in the convent of Tordesillas, and which\r\nafterwards comforted the last moments of his son Philip, in the convent\r\nof the Escorial. When brought by the attendant, he turned eagerly to\r\nreceive them; and taking one into each hand, he remained silent for some\r\nminutes, with his eyes fixed upon the figure of the Saviour. Those who\r\nstood nearest the bed then heard him say, quickly, as if replying to a\r\nsudden call, \"_Ya voy, Senor_--Now, Lord, I go.\" A few moments of\r\ndeath-wrestle between soul and body followed; and then, with a voice\r\nloud and clear enough to be heard in the other apartments, he cried\r\nthree times, \"_Ay, Jesus!_\" and expired.\r\n\r\nIn or near the chamber of death were assembled the prior and the\r\nchaplains, and the household; the count of Oropesa, his brother Don\r\nFrancisco, his cousin, Don Juan Pacheco, and his uncle Diego abbot of\r\nCabanas, Don Luis de Avila, and archbishop Carranza. Don Juan of\r\nAustria, too, in the quality of page to Quixada, stood by the death-bed\r\nof him he was afterwards so proud to call his sire.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the death, and part of the day following, the physicians\r\nand attendants were engaged in embalming the body, and arranging it for\r\nthe grave. Meanwhile, a leaden coffin was prepared, and likewise a\r\nmassive outer case of chestnut wood, and a black velvet pall to cover\r\nthe whole. Sandoval had heard, but gave no credit to the story, of the\r\ncoffin which the emperor was said to have brought with him to Yuste, and\r\nto have kept under his bed. Another version of the tale, he says, made\r\nthe coffin a winding-sheet, but no mention of either was found in the\r\nminute account drawn up by the prior Angulo. When all was ready, the\r\ncoffin was lowered, by ten or twelve men, through the window which\r\nopened from the bedchamber into the church, and placed upon a stage\r\nerected in the middle of the isle. These preparations were hardly\r\ncompleted, when the corregidor of Plasencia arrived with his clerks and\r\nconstables, and asserted that, as the emperor had died within his\r\njurisdiction, it was his duty to see that the remains had been deposited\r\nin a place of safety. In spite, therefore, of the remonstrances of the\r\nprior, he caused the coffins to be opened, that he might identify the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe solemn funeral services, or the honors, as they were called, were\r\ncommenced the next day, Tuesday, the 27th of October. They were an\r\nexpansion of the rites in which the emperor had himself taken part a few\r\nweeks before, and they lasted for three days. Mass was said each day by\r\nthe Archbishop of Toledo, the prior of Yuste assisting as deacon, and\r\nthe prior of Granada as subdeacon, amongst the tears of the whole\r\nbrotherhood. Funeral services were also preached, on the first day by\r\nthe eloquent Villalva, on the second by the prior of Granada, and on the\r\nthird by the prior of Yuste. The imperial dust was then committed to the\r\nearth. \"Let my sepulchre,\" said the will of Charles, \"be so ordered,\r\nthat the lower half of my body lie beneath, and the upper half before,\r\nthe high altar, that the priest who says mass may tread upon my head\r\nand breast.\" But the clergy present being divided in opinion as to the\r\nlawfulness of placing under the high altar a corpse not in the odor of\r\nsanctity, the matter was compromised by laying the coffin in a cavity\r\nmade in the wall behind, so that it encroached only on a small portion\r\nof the holy ground.\r\n\r\nFuneral honors also took place in the presence of the regent and her\r\ncourt, in the beautiful church of the Royal Benedictines at Valladolid.\r\nA sermon was preached on the occasion by Francisco Borja, from the text,\r\n\"_Ecce longavi fugiens et mansi in solitudine._\"--\"Lo! then would I\r\nwander afar off, and remain in the wilderness.\" (Psalm lv. 7.)[L] It was\r\nfilled with praise of the emperor for his pious magnanimity in taking\r\nleave of the world before the world had taken leave of him--praise\r\nwhich, from the mouth of a Jesuit who had once been a wealthy grandee,\r\nmust have savored somewhat of self-glorification. Amongst other edifying\r\nreminiscences of his friend, Borja told his hearers that he had it from\r\nthe lips of the deceased, that never, since he was one-and-twenty years\r\nold, had he failed to set apart some portion of each day for inward\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nBrussels excelled all the other cities of the Austrian dominion in the\r\nsplendor with which she did honor to the emperor's memory. The\r\nceremonies took place on the 29th and 30th of December. The procession,\r\nin which King Philip walked, attended by the dukes of Savoy and\r\nBrunswick, and a host of the nobility of Spain, Germany, and the\r\nNetherlands, was two hours in passing from the palace to the church of\r\nSt. Gudule. Its principal feature was a huge galley, large enough for\r\nmarine service, placed on a cunningly devised sea, which answered the\r\ndouble purpose of supporting some isles, emblematic of the Indies, and\r\nof concealing the power which rolled the huge structure along. Faith,\r\nHope, and Charity, were the crew of this enchanted bark; and her sides\r\nwere hung with twelve paintings of Charles's principal exploits, which\r\nwere further set forth in golden letter-press on the black satin sails.\r\nA long line of horses followed, each led by two gentlemen, and bearing\r\non its housings the blazon of one of the states of the emperor. They\r\nwere led up the aisle of the church past the altar, and the seats\r\noccupied by the order of the Golden Fleece. As the last horse, covered\r\nwith a black foot-cloth, went by, the count of Bossu, one of the\r\nknights, the early playmate and dear friend of the emperor, threw\r\nhimself on his knees, and remained for some time prostrated on the\r\npavement in an agony of grief.\r\n\r\nThe chapel of Yuste was merely a temporary resting-place of the royal\r\ndead. In his will the emperor had confided the care of his bones to his\r\nson, expressing a wish, however, to be laid beside his wife and his\r\nfather in the cathedral of Granada, in that splendid chapel-royal, rich\r\nwith the tombs and trophies of Ferdinand and Isabella. Philip, however,\r\nshivering in the rear at St. Quentin, had already vowed to St. Lawrence\r\nthe great monastery which it was his after delight to make the chief\r\nmonument of the power and the piety of the house of Hapsburg. At the\r\nEscorial, therefore, he united the bones of his father and mother, and\r\nplaced them, on the fourth of February, 1574, in a vault beneath the\r\njasper shrine, which yet contains their fine effigies, wrought in bronze\r\nby Leoni. The occasion was marked by one of those terrific storms, sent,\r\nas the monks supposed, by the devil, in the hope of overthrowing that\r\nfortress of piety. A grand arch of timber, erected at the door of the\r\nchurch, was blown away, and its hangings of rich brocades, rent into\r\nminute shreds, were scattered far and wide over the surrounding chase.\r\nEighty years later, the repose of the emperor was once more broken by\r\nhis great-grandson, Philip IV. For thirty-three years that prince was\r\nengaged in building the celebrated Pantheon, begun by his father, Philip\r\nIII. On the sixteenth of March, 1654, the dust of the Austrian kings of\r\nSpain and of their consorts who had continued the line, was translated\r\nfrom the plain vault of Philip II. to this splendid sepulchral chamber,\r\nwhich gleamed, in the light of a thousand tapers, with its marble and\r\njasper and gold, like a creation of oriental romance. Each coffin was\r\nborne by three nobles and three Jeromite friars; the procession being\r\nheaded by that of Charles V., carried by Don Luis de Haro, the Duke of\r\nAbrantes, and the Marquess of Aytona. As the remains were to be\r\ndeposited in a marble sarcophagus, it became necessary to remove the\r\nprevious coverings, which enabled Philip IV. to come face to face with\r\nhis great ancestor. The body of the emperor was found to be quite\r\nentire. After looking at it for some minutes in silence, the king turned\r\nto Haro, and said, \"Honored body, Don Luis.\" \"Very honored,\" replied the\r\nminister; words, brief indeed, but very pregnant; for the prior of the\r\nEscorial has left it recorded \"that they condensed all that a Christian\r\nought to feel on so solemn an occasion.\"\r\n\r\nCharles did not leave the world without some of those portents in which\r\nthe men of that age loved to trace the influence of a remarkable death\r\nupon the operations of nature. A comet appeared over the monastery at\r\nthe beginning of his last illness, and was seen no more after the night\r\non which he died. In the spring of 1558, a lily in his garden, beneath\r\nhis windows, bore two buds, of which one flowered and withered in due\r\ncourse, but the other remained a bud through the summer and autumn, to\r\nthe great astonishment of the gardener and the friars. But on the night\r\nof the twenty-first of September it burst into full bloom, an emblem of\r\nthe whiteness of the parting spirit, and of the sure and certain hope of\r\nits reception into bliss. It was reverently gathered, and fastened upon\r\nthe black veil which covered the sacramental shrine in the church. In\r\nthe week following the grand obsequies, a pied bird, large as a vulture,\r\nbut of a kind unknown at Yuste, perched at night on the roof of the\r\nchurch, exactly over the imperial grave, and disturbed the friars by\r\nbarking like a dog. For five successive nights it barked there in the\r\nclear moonlight, always at the same hour, and always arriving from the\r\neast, and flying away towards the west. And four years later, a holy\r\nCapuchin of the New World, Fray Luis Mendez, as he knelt in his\r\nconvent-chapel at Guatemala, was blessed with a vision, wherein he saw\r\nthe emperor before the judgment-seat of our Lord, making his defence\r\nagainst the accusing demons, with so much success that he received\r\nhonorable acquittal, and was in the end carried off to heaven by the\r\nangels of light.\r\n\r\nThe codicil of the will of Charles, the only part of the document which\r\nbelongs to his life at Yuste, is drawn up with a minuteness of detail\r\nvery characteristic of the careful habits of the man. After a profession\r\nof attachment to the church, and hatred of heresy, and after the\r\ndirections for his burial which have been already noticed, he proceeds\r\nto describe a monument and an altar-piece which he wished to be erected\r\nin the church of the convent, in the event of Yuste being chosen by his\r\nson for the final resting-place of his bones. The altar-piece was to be\r\nof alabaster, a copy in relief of Titian's picture of the \"Last\r\nJudgment,\" the picture on which he was gazing at the moment when he\r\nfirst felt the touch of death. A custodia, or sacramental tabernacle,\r\nwas likewise to be made of alabaster and marble, and placed between\r\nstatues of himself and the empress. They were to be sculptured, kneeling\r\nwith hands clasped as in prayer, barefoot, and with uncovered heads, and\r\nclad in sheets like penitents. For further particulars, he referred the\r\nking to Luis Quixada, and the confessor Regla, who were fully instructed\r\nin his meaning and wishes. In case of the removal of his body, instead\r\nof the altar-piece and monument, the convent was to receive a picture\r\nfor their altar, of such kind as the king shall appoint. In compliance\r\nwith this desire, Philip presented the monks with a copy of Titian's\r\n\"Judgment,\" which adorned their high altar until the suppression of the\r\nconvents, in 1823, when it was carried off to the parish church of\r\nTexeda.\r\n\r\nThe emperor next expresses his concern at hearing that the pensions\r\nwhich he had granted to the servants whom he had dismissed at\r\nXarandilla, had been very ill-paid, and he entreats the king to order\r\ntheir punctual payment for the future. He directs that the friars of\r\nYuste and the friars from other convents, who had been specially\r\nemployed in his service, as readers, preachers, and musicians, shall\r\nreceive such gratuities as shall appear sufficient to father Regla and\r\nQuixada. To the confessor himself he bequeaths an annual pension of four\r\nhundred ducats (about 80_l._ sterling), and four hundred ducats in\r\nlegacy. Of Luis Quixada he twice speaks in the most affectionate terms,\r\nacknowledging his long and good service, and his willing fidelity in\r\nincurring the expense and inconvenience of removing his wife and\r\nhousehold to Yuste. Lamenting that he has done so little to promote his\r\ninterest, he earnestly recommends him to the king's favor, and, with a\r\nlegacy of 2000 ducats, he leaves him a pension to the value of his\r\npresent appointment (without mentioning the sum), until he is provided\r\nwith a place of greater emolument. He also desires that the Infanta will\r\ncause the amount of fines recovered by his attorney, or that might be\r\nrecovered in cases still pending against the poachers and rioters of\r\nQuacos, to be paid into the hands of a person named by the executors for\r\ndistribution amongst the poor of the village. The contents of his larder\r\nand cellar, and his stores of provisions in general, at the day of his\r\ndecease, and likewise the dispensary, with its drugs and vessels, he\r\nleaves to the brotherhood of Yuste, and to the poor any money which may\r\nremain in his coffers after defraying the wages of his servants.\r\n\r\nThese are all mentioned by name, and for the most part receive pensions,\r\nexcept a few to whom small gratuities are given, it being explained that\r\nprevious provision has been made for them. The pensions range from four\r\nhundred florins (32_l._ sterling), conferred on the doctor, Enrique\r\nMathesio, to ninety florins, which requite the services of Isabel\r\nPlantin, the laundress of the table-linen. The gratuities vary from\r\n150,000 maravedis (about 45_l._ sterling), left to the secretary\r\nGaztelu, to 7500, given to Jorge de Diana, a boy employed in the\r\nworkshop of Torriano. That mechanician being already pensioned to the\r\namount of 200 crowns, receives only 15,000 maravedis; he is likewise\r\nreminded that he has been paid something to account on the price of a\r\nclock which is in hand, and for which his employer is content that the\r\nexecutors shall pay a fair valuation.\r\n\r\nThese sums were all to be paid at Valladolid. After the funeral service\r\nwas ended, therefore, on the 29th of October, when the count of Oropesa\r\nand the other neighbors returned to their homes, and the archbishop took\r\nthe road to Toledo, most of the household of the emperor were also ready\r\nto depart. Only three Flemings remained behind for a few days to bring\r\nup the rear with the heavy baggage. Within about a fortnight after the\r\ndeath of Charles, the Jeromites of Yuste were again alone among the\r\nyellow October woods, and the convent relapsed into its ancient\r\nobscurity, never more to be remembered, except as the cell of the\r\nimperial recluse.\r\n\r\nSo ended the career of Charles V., the greatest monarch of the memorable\r\nsixteenth century. The vast extent of his dominions in Europe, the\r\nwealth poured into his coffers by the New World, the energy and sagacity\r\nof his mind, and the important crisis of the world's history in which he\r\nacted, have combined to make him more famous than any of the successors\r\nof Charlemagne. The admiration which was raised by the great events of\r\nhis reign was sustained to the last by the unwonted manner of its close.\r\nIn our days, abdication has been so frequently the refuge of weak men\r\nfallen on evil times, or the last shift of baffled bad men, that it is\r\ndifficult for us to conceive the sensation which must have been produced\r\nby the retirement of Charles. Now that the \"divinity which doth hedge a\r\nking\" has decayed into a bowing wall and a tottering fence, it is almost\r\nimpossible to look upon the solemn ceremony which was enacted at\r\nBrussels, with the feeling and eyes of the sixteenth century. The act of\r\nthe emperor was not, indeed, a thing altogether unheard of, but it was\r\nknown only in books, and belonged, as the Spaniard used to say, to the\r\ndays of king Wamba. The knights of the Fleece who wept on the platform\r\naround their Caesar, knew little more about Diocletian than was known by\r\nthe farmers and clothiers who elbowed each other in the crowd below. It\r\nwas only some studious monk who was aware that a Theodosius and an Isaac\r\nhad submitted their heads to the razor to save their necks from the\r\nbowstring; that a Lothaire had led a hermit's life in the Ardennes; that\r\na Carloman had milked the ewes of the Benedictines at Monte Cassino. The\r\nretirement of Charles, therefore, was fitted to strike the imagination\r\nof men by the novelty of the occasion, by the solemnity of its\r\ncircumstances, by the splendor of the resigned crown, and by the\r\nworld-wide fame with which it had been worn.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the emperor gave the true reasons of his act,\r\nwhen, panting for breath, and unable to stand alone, he told the states\r\nof Flanders that he resigned the government because it was a burden\r\nwhich his shattered frame could no longer bear. It was to no sudden\r\nimpulse, however, that he yielded; but he calmly fulfilled a resolve\r\nwhich he had cherished for many years. Indeed, he seems to have\r\ndetermined to abdicate, almost at the time when he determined to reign.\r\nFor so powerful a mind has rarely been so tardy in giving evidence of\r\npower. Until he appeared in Italy in 1530, the thirtieth year of his\r\nage, his strong will had been as wax in the hands of other men. Up to\r\nthat time the most laborious, reserved, and inflexible of princes was\r\nthe most docile subject of his ministers. But if his mind was slow to\r\nripen, his body was no less premature in its decay. By nature and\r\nhereditary habit a keen sportsman, and in youth unwearied in tracking\r\nthe wolf and the bear over the hills of Toledo and Granada, he was\r\nreduced, ere he had turned fifty, to content himself with shooting crows\r\nand daws amongst the trees of his gardens. Familiarized by feeble health\r\nwith images of death, he had determined twenty years before his\r\nabdication to interpose some interval of rest between the council and\r\nthe grave. He had agreed with his empress, who died in 1538, that as\r\nsoon as the state affairs and the age of their children should permit,\r\nthey should retire into religious seclusion: he into a cloister of\r\nfriars, and she into a nunnery. In 1542, he spoke of his design to the\r\nduke of Gandia; and in 1546 it was whispered at court, and was mentioned\r\nby the sharp-eared envoy of Venice, in a dispatch to the Doge. Since\r\nthen, decaying health and declining fortune had maintained him in that\r\ngeneral vexation of spirit which he shared with king Solomon. His later\r\nschemes of conquest and policy had resulted in disaster and disgrace.\r\nThe Pope, the great Turk, the Protestant princes, and the king of\r\nFrance, were once more arrayed against the potentate who in the bright\r\nmorning of his career had imposed laws upon them all. The flight from\r\nInnsbruck had avenged the cause which seemed lost at Muhlberg; Guise and\r\nthe gallant townsmen of Metz had enabled the French wits to turn the\r\nemperor's proud motto, _Plus ultra_, into _Non ultra metas_. Whilst the\r\nProtestant faith was spreading even in the dominions of the house of\r\nHapsburg, the doctors of the church assembled in that council which had\r\ncost so much treasure and intrigue, continued to quibble, for the sole\r\nbenefit of the tavern-keepers of Trent. The finances both of Spain and\r\nthe other Austrian states were in the utmost disorder, and the lord of\r\nMexico and Peru had been forced to borrow from the duke of Florence. It\r\nis no wonder, therefore, that he seized the first gleam of sunshine and\r\nreturning calm to make for the long-desired harbor of refuge; and that\r\nhe relieved his brow of its thorny crowns as soon as he had attained an\r\nobject dear to him as a father, a politician, and a devotee, by placing\r\nhis son Philip on the rival throne of the heretic Tudors.\r\n\r\nHis habits and turn of mind, as well as his Spanish blood, and the\r\nspirit of his age, made a convent the natural place of his retreat.\r\nMonachism seems to have had for him the charm, vague, yet powerful,\r\nwhich soldiership has for most boys; and he was ever fond of catching\r\nglimpses of the life which he had resolved, sooner or later, to embrace.\r\nWhen the empress died, he retired to indulge his grief in the cloisters\r\nof La Sisla, at Toledo. After his return from one of his African\r\ncampaigns, he paid a visit to the noble convent of Mejorada, near\r\nOlmedo, and spent two days in familiar converse with the Benedictines,\r\nsharing their refectory fare, and walking for hours in their garden\r\nalleys of venerable cypress. When he held his court at Brussels, he was\r\nfrequently a guest at the convent of Groenendael; and the monks\r\ncommemorated his condescensions, as well as his skill as a marksman, by\r\nplacing a bronze statue of him on the banks of their fish-pond, into\r\nwhich he had brought down a heron, from an amazing altitude, with his\r\ngun. Though unable at Yuste to indulge the love of sport, which may\r\nhave had its influence in drawing him to the chestnut woods of the Vera,\r\nwe have seen that he continued to the last to take his pleasure in the\r\nconverse and companionship of the Jeromites.\r\n\r\nIn the cloister, Charles was no less popular than he had been in the\r\nworld; for in spite of his feeble health and phlegmatic temperament, in\r\nspite of his caution, which amounted to distrust, and his selfishness,\r\nwhich frequently took the form of treachery, in spite of his love of\r\npower, and the unsparing severity with which he punished the assertion\r\nof popular rights, there was still that in his conduct and bearing which\r\ngained the favor of the multitude. A little book, of no literary value,\r\nbut frequently printed both in French and Flemish, sufficiently\r\nindicates in its title the qualities which colored the popular view of\r\nhis character. \"The Life and Actions, Heroic and Pleasant, of the\r\ninvincible Emperor Charles V.\" was long a favorite chap-book in the Low\r\nCountries. It relates how he defeated Solyman the magnificent, and how\r\nhe permitted a Walloon boor to obtain judgment against him for the value\r\nof a sheep, killed by the wheels of his coach; how he charged the\r\nMoorish horsemen at Tunis; and how he jested incognito with the woodmen\r\nof Soigne. A similar impression, deepened by his reputation for\r\nsanctity, he seems to have left behind him amongst the sylvan hamlets of\r\nEstremadura.\r\n\r\nIn one point alone did Charles in the cell differ widely from Charles on\r\nthe throne. In the world, fanaticism had not been one of his vices; he\r\nfeared the keys no more than his cousin of England; and he confronted\r\nthe successor of St. Peter no less boldly than he made head against the\r\nheir of St. Louis. When he held Clement VII. prisoner in Rome, he\r\npermitted at Madrid the mockery of masses for that pontiff's speedy\r\ndeliverance. Against the Protestants he fought rather as rebels than as\r\nheretics; and he frequently stayed the hand of the triumphant zealots of\r\nthe church. At Wittenberg, he set a fine example of moderation, in\r\nforbidding the destruction of the tomb of Luther--saying, that he\r\ncontended with the living, and not with the dead. But once within the\r\nwalls of Yuste, and he assumed all the passions, and prejudices, and\r\nsuperstitions of a friar. Looking back on his past life, he thanked God\r\nfor the evil that he had done in the matter of religious persecution,\r\nand repented him, in sackcloth and ashes, of having kept his plighted\r\nword to a heretic. Religion was the enchanted ground whereon that strong\r\nwill was paralyzed, and that keen intellect fell groveling in the dust.\r\nProtestant and philosophic historians love to relate how Charles,\r\nfinding that no two of his time-pieces could be made to go alike,\r\nremarked that he had perhaps erred in spending so much blood and\r\ntreasure in the hope of compelling men to uniformity in the more\r\ndifficult matter of religion. We fear the anecdote must have been\r\ninvented by some manufacturer of libels or panegyrics, such as Sleidan\r\nand Jovius, whom Charles was wont to call his liars. No remark of equal\r\nwisdom can be brought home to the lips of the Spanish Diocletian; nor\r\nwas the philosophy \"of him who walked in the Salonian garden's noble\r\nshade\" ever heard amongst the litanies and the scourges which resounded\r\nthrough the cloisters of Yuste.\r\n\r\nTo those who have perused this brief record of the recluse and his\r\nlittle court, it may be agreeable to know the subsequent fortunes of the\r\npersonages who acted upon that miniature stage.\r\n\r\nQueen Mary of Hungary died at Cigales on the 28th of October, 1558, four\r\nweeks after the death of her brother. So passed away, in the same year,\r\nand within a few months of one another, the royal group who landed at\r\nLaredo.\r\n\r\nFrom Yuste, Luis Quixada and his wife returned to their house at\r\nVillagarcia, near Valladolid, taking Don Juan with them. When Philip II.\r\narrived in Spain, in 1559, he received his brother and his guardian at\r\nthe neighboring convent of San Pedro de la Espina. They afterwards\r\nfollowed the court to Madrid, where Quixada had an opportunity of\r\nsignalizing his devotion to his master's son, by rescuing him from a\r\nfire, which burnt down their house in the night, before he attended to\r\nthe safety of Dona Magdalena. This, and his other services, were not\r\nneglected by the king, who made him master of the horse to the\r\nheir-apparent, and president of the council of the Indies, and gave him\r\nseveral commanderies in the order of Calatrava. When Don Juan was sent\r\nto command against the Moriscos, whom Christian persecution and bad\r\nfaith had driven to revolt in the Alpuxarras, the old major-domo went\r\nwith him as a military tutor. They were reconnoitring the strong\r\nmountain fortress of Seron, when a bold sally from the place threw the\r\nCastilians into disorder bordering on flight, in the course of which a\r\nbullet from an infidel gun finished the campaigns of the comrade of\r\nCharles V. He fell, shot through the shoulder, by the side of his pupil;\r\nand he died of the wound at Canilles, on the 25th of February, 1570, in\r\nthe arms of his wife, who had hurried from Madrid to nurse him. Don Juan\r\nburied him with military honors, and mourned for him as for a father.\r\n\r\nThe good Dona Magdalena retired to Villagarcia, and employed her\r\nchildless widowhood in works of charity and piety, in prayers for the\r\nsoul of her husband, and for the success of her darling young prince.\r\nFor the latter she also engaged in a work of a more practical and\r\nsecular kind; for the hero of Lepanto wore no linen but what was wrought\r\nby her loving hands. His sad and early death severed her chief tie to\r\nthe world, and left religion no rival in her heart. The companions of\r\nFrancis Borja, who had first kindled the holy flames of her devotion at\r\nYuste, became her guides and counsellors; and she built and endowed no\r\nless than three Jesuit colleges at Villagarcia, Santander, and Oviedo.\r\nHer life of gentle and blameless enthusiasm ended in 1598, when she was\r\nlaid beside her lord in the collegiate church of Villagarcia. Amongst\r\nthe relics of that temple, two crucifixes were held in peculiar\r\nveneration,--one being that which she had pressed to her dying lips, the\r\nother a trophy rescued by Luis Quixada from a church burned by the Moors\r\nin the war of the Alpuxarras.\r\n\r\nWilliam Van Male, the gentle and literary chamberlain, returned to\r\nFlanders, with a slender annual pension of 150 florins, which was to be\r\nreduced one half on his becoming keeper of the palace at Brussels, an\r\noffice of which the king had given him the reversion. He died in 1560,\r\nand was buried in the church of St. Gudule, at Brussels, where his\r\nwidow, Hippolyta Reynen, was laid by his side in 1579.\r\n\r\nFather Borja continued to teach and to travel with unflagging zeal. Soon\r\nafter preaching the emperor's funeral sermon, he was again in Portugal,\r\nvisiting the colleges at Evora, Coimbra, and Braga, and aiding in the\r\nfoundation of the college of Porto. Called to Rome by Pope Pius IV., to\r\nadvise on affairs of the church, he was twice chosen vicar-general of\r\nthe company; and finally, in 1565, he received the staff of Loyola.\r\nDuring his rule of seven years, the order lengthened its cords and\r\nstrengthened its stakes in every part of the world, and in every\r\ncondition of mankind. Its astute politicians gained the ear of princes\r\nand prelates who had hitherto been cold, or adverse; its colleges rose\r\namid the snows of Poland, and the forests of Peru; Barbary, Florida, and\r\nBrazil, were watered with the blood of its martyrs; and its ministers of\r\nmercy moved amongst the roar of battle, on the bastions of Malta and the\r\ndecks at Lepanto. The general of this great army visited his native\r\nSpain, for the last time, in 1571, when he was sent by Pope Pius V. to\r\nfan the anti-Turkish flame in the bosom of Philip II., and to add a\r\nmorsel of the true cross to the relics of the Escorial. Of the offers to\r\nbuild houses for the company, which now poured in, the last that he\r\naccepted was Dona Magdalena de Ulloa's college at Villagarcia, thus\r\nfinding, after many days, the bread which he had cast upon the waters at\r\nYuste. From Spain, he went to preach the crusade at the courts of\r\nPortugal and France--an arduous journey, which proved fruitful of royal\r\ncaresses, but fatal to his enfeebled frame. Falling ill by the way, he\r\nhad barely strength to reach Rome to die. In the year 1572, the\r\nsixty-second of his age, he was laid beside his companions in toil and\r\nglory, and his predecessors in power, Loyola and Laynez.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"After long experience of the world,\" says Junius, \"I affirm before God,\r\nI never knew a rogue who was not unhappy.\" Very likely: another author\r\nhad intimated before the observations of Junius, that even the righteous\r\n\"is of few days and full of trouble.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[K] Nicolas Antonio.\r\n\r\n[L] Psalm liv. 7. The Vulgate Psalm liv. is our Psalm lv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the North British Review.\r\n\r\nDICKENS AND THACKERAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur impression of the difference between the two authors in the matter\r\nof style is very much what it has always been from a general reading\r\nacquaintance with their works, namely, that Mr. Thackeray is the more\r\nterse and idiomatic, and Mr. Dickens the more diffuse and luxuriant\r\nwriter. Both seem to be easy penmen, and to have language very readily\r\nat their command; both also seem to convey their meaning as simply as\r\nthey can, and to be careful, according to their notions of verbal\r\naccuracy; but in Mr. Dickens's sentences there is a leafiness, a\r\ntendency to words and images, for their own sake; whereas, in Mr.\r\nThackeray's, one sees the stem and outline of the thought better. We\r\nhave no great respect for that canon of style which demands in English\r\nwriters the use of Saxon in preference to Latin words, thinking that a\r\nrule to which there are natural limitations, variable with the writer's\r\naim and with the subject he treats; but we should suppose that critics\r\nwho do regard the rule would find Mr. Thackeray's style the more\r\naccordant with it. On the whole, if we had to choose passages at random,\r\nto be set before young scholars as examples of easy and vigorous English\r\ncomposition, we would take them rather from Thackeray than from Dickens.\r\nThere is a Horatian strictness, a racy strength, in Mr. Thackeray's\r\nexpressions, even in his more level and tame passages, which we miss in\r\nthe corresponding passages in Mr. Dickens's writings, and in which we\r\nseem to recognize the effect of those classical studies through which an\r\naccurate and determinate, though somewhat bald use of words becomes a\r\nfixed habit. In the ease, and at the same time thorough polish and\r\npropriety with which Mr. Thackeray can use slang words, we seem\r\nespecially to detect the university man. Snob, swell, buck, gent,\r\nfellow, fogy--these, and many more such expressive appellatives, not yet\r\nsanctioned by the dictionary, Mr. Thackeray employs more frequently, we\r\nbelieve, than any other living writer, and yet always with\r\nunexceptionable taste. In so doing he is conscious, no doubt, of the\r\nsame kind of security that permits Oxford and Cambridge men, and even,\r\nas we can testify, Oxford and Cambridge clergymen, to season their\r\nconversation with similar words--namely, the evident air of educated\r\nmanliness with which they can be introduced, and which, however rough\r\nthe guise, no one can mistake. In the use of the words genteel, vulgar,\r\nfemale, and the like--words which men diffident of their own breeding\r\nare observed not to risk; as well as in the art of alternating\r\ngracefully between the noun lady and the noun woman, the Scylla and\r\nCharybdis, if we may say so, of shy talkers--Mr. Thackeray is also a\r\nperfect master, commanding his language in such cases with an\r\nunconscious ease, not unlike that which enables the true English\r\ngentleman he is so fond of portraying, either to name titled personages\r\nof his acquaintance without seeming a tuft-hunter, or to refrain from\r\nnaming them without the affectation of radicalism. In Mr. Dickens, of\r\ncourse, we have the same perfect taste and propriety; but in him the\r\nresult appears to arise, if we may so express ourselves, rather from the\r\nkeen and feminine sensibility of a fine genius, whose instinct is always\r\nfor the pure and beautiful, than from the self-possession of a mind\r\ncorrect under any circumstances by discipline and sure habit. Where Mr.\r\nDickens is not exerting himself, that is, in passages of mere equable\r\nnarrative or description, where there is nothing to move or excite him,\r\nhis style, as we have already said, seems to us more careless and\r\nlanguid than that of Mr. Thackeray; sometimes, indeed, a whole page is\r\nonly redeemed from weakness by those little touches of wit, and those\r\nhumorous turns of conception which he knows so well how to sprinkle over\r\nit. It is due to Mr. Dickens to state, however, that in this respect his\r\n\"Copperfield\" is one of his most pleasing productions, and a decided\r\nimprovement on its predecessor \"Dombey.\" Not only is the spirit of the\r\nbook more gentle and mellow, but the style is more continuous and\r\ncareful, with fewer of those recurring tricks of expression, the dread\r\nremnants of former felicities, which constituted what was called his\r\nmannerism. Nor must we omit to remark also, that in passages where\r\nhigher feeling is called into play, Mr. Dickens's style always rises\r\ninto greater purity and vigor, the weakness and the superfluity\r\ndisappearing before the concentrating force of passion, and the language\r\noften pouring itself forth in a clear and flowing song. This, in fact,\r\nis according to the nature of the luxuriant or poetical genius, which\r\nnever expresses itself in its best or most concise manner unless the\r\nmood be high as well as the meaning clear,--for maintaining the\r\nexcellence of the style of a terse and highly reflective writer, such as\r\nThackeray, on the other hand, the presence of a clear meaning is at all\r\ntimes sufficient, though, of course, here also the pitch and melody will\r\ndepend on the mood....\r\n\r\nThere is one piece of positive doctrine, however, in which both Pen and\r\nWarrington agree, and of which Mr. Thackeray's writings are decidedly\r\nthe exponents in the present day, as Mr. Dickens's are of the doctrine\r\nof kindliness. This doctrine may be called the doctrine of\r\nanti-snobbism. Singular fact! in the great city of London, where higher\r\nand more ancient faiths seem to have all but perished, and where men\r\nbustle in myriads, scarce restrained by any spiritual law, there has\r\narisen of late years, as there arose in Mecca of old, a native form of\r\nethical belief, by which its inhabitants are tried and try each other.\r\n\"Thou shall not be a snob;\" such is the first principle at present of\r\nCockney ethics. And observe how much real sincerity there is in this\r\nprinciple, how it really addresses itself to facts, and only to facts,\r\nknown and admitted. It is not the major morals of human nature, but what\r\nare called the minor morals of society, and these chiefly in their\r\naesthetic aspect, as modes of pleasant breeding, that the Cockney system\r\nof ethics recognizes. Its maxims and commands are not \"Thou shalt do no\r\nwrong,\" \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me,\" \"Thou shalt not\r\ncovet,\"--but, \"Thou shalt pronounce thy H's,\" \"Thou shalt not abuse\r\nwaiters as if they were dogs,\" \"Thou shalt not falsely make a boast of\r\ndining with peers and members of Parliament.\" He who offends in these\r\nrespects is a snob. Thus, at least, the Cockney moralist professes no\r\nmore than he really believes. The real species of moral evil recognized\r\nin London, the real kind of offence which the moral sentiment there\r\npunishes, and cannot away with, is snobbism. The very name, it will be\r\nobserved, is characteristic and unpretentious--curt, London-born,\r\nirreverent. When you say that a man is a snob, it does not mean that you\r\ndetest and abhor him, but only that you must cut him, or make fun of\r\nhim. Such is anti-snobbism, the doctrine of which Mr. Thackeray, among\r\nhis other merits, has the merit of being the chief literary expounder\r\nand apostle. Now it is not a very awful doctrine, certainly; it is not,\r\nas our friend Warrington would be the first to admit, the doctrine in\r\nthe strength of which one would like to guide his own soul, or to face\r\nthe future and the everlasting; still it has its use, and by all means\r\nlet it have, yes, let it have its scribes and preachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words.\r\n\r\nWORK AWAY!\r\n\r\n\r\n            Work away!\r\n    For the Master's eye is on us,\r\n    Never off us, still upon us,\r\n            Night and day!\r\n            Work away!\r\n    Keep the busy fingers plying,\r\n    Keep the ceaseless shuttles flying;\r\n    See that never thread lie wrong;\r\n    Let not clash or clatter round us,\r\n    Sound of whirring wheels, confound us;\r\n    Steady hand! let wool be strong\r\n    And firm, that has to last long!\r\n            Work away!\r\n\r\n    Keep upon the anvil ringing\r\n    Stroke of hammer; on the gloom\r\n    Set 'twixt cradle and 'twixt tomb\r\n    Shower of fiery sparkles flinging;\r\n    Keep the mighty furnace glowing;\r\n    Keep the red ore hissing, flowing\r\n    Swift within the ready mould;\r\n    See that each one than the old\r\n    Still be fitter, still be fairer\r\n    For the master to behold:\r\n            Work away!\r\n\r\n            Work away!\r\n    For the leader's eye is on us,\r\n    Never off us, still upon us,\r\n            Night and day!\r\n    Wide the trackless prairies round us,\r\n    Dark and unsunned woods surround us,\r\n    Steep and savage mountains bound us;\r\n            Far away\r\n    Smile the soft savannahs green,\r\n    Rivers sweep and roll between:\r\n            Work away!\r\n\r\n    Bring your axes, woodmen true;\r\n    Smite the forest till the blue\r\n    Of Heaven's sunny eye looks through\r\n    Every wild and tangled glade;\r\n    Jungle swamp and thicket shade\r\n            Give to-day!\r\n    O'er the torrents fling your bridges,\r\n    Pioneers!

Behring Straits shall be the door by which we\r\nenter the Pacific Ocean. We are soon flitting between islands; from the\r\nAmerican peninsula of Alaska runs a chain of islands,--the\r\nAleutian,--which lie sprinkled upon our track, like a train of crumbs\r\ndropped by some Tom Thumb among the giants, who may aforetime have been\r\nled astray, not in the wood, but on the water. If he landed on\r\nKamtchatka, from the point of that peninsula he made a fresh start,\r\ndropping more crumbs,--the Kurile Islands,--till he dropped some larger\r\npieces, and a whole slice for the main island of Japan, before he again\r\nreached the continent and landed finally on the Corea. In sailing by\r\nthese islands, we have abundant reason to observe that they indicate\r\nmain lines of volcanic action. From Behring Strait, in fact, we enter\r\nthe Pacific, between two great batteries of subterranean fire. Steering\r\nfor Japan, we pass, on the Kamtchatkan coast, the loftiest volcano in\r\nthe old world, Kamtchatskaja (fifteen thousand, seven hundred and\r\nsixty-three feet). Following the course of the volcanic chain of Kurile\r\nIslands, of which the most northerly belong to Russia, the southern\r\nKuriles are the first land we encounter subject to Japan. We do not go\r\nashore here, to be sent to prison like Golownin, for we are content, at\r\npresent, to remember that the natives of these islands are the hairiest\r\namong men. We sail on, too polite to outrage Japanese propriety by\r\nlanding, even from a Phantom Ship, on the main island; so we sail to\r\nKiusiu, and run into the bay of Nagasaki. The isles of Japan, calling\r\nrocks islands, are in number three thousand eight hundred and fifty. The\r\nmain island, Nippon, is larger than Ireland, and is important enough to\r\nhave been justly called the England of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nOnly there is a mighty difference between this England, talking about\r\nliberty, or cherishing free trade, and that Dai Nippon; in which not a\r\nsoul does as he pleases, and from which the commerce of the whole world\r\nis shut out. Dai (or great) Nippon is the name of the whole state, which\r\nthe Chinese modify into Jih-pun, and which we have further altered to\r\nJapan. On Kiusiu, a large southern island, Nagasaki is the only port\r\ninto which, on any possible excuse, a foreign vessel is allowed to\r\nenter. This port we are now approaching; the dark rocks of the coast\r\nline are reflected from a brilliant sea; we pass a mountain island,\r\ncultivated to the very summit, terrace above terrace; green hills invite\r\nus to our haven, and blue mountains in the distance tempt us to an\r\nonward journey. There are white houses shining among cedars; there are\r\npointed temple roofs; boats with their sails up make the water near us\r\nlively; surely we shall like Japan. We enter the bay now, and approach\r\nNagasaki, between fruitful hills and temple groves, steeps clothed with\r\nevergreen oak, cedars, and laurels, picturesque rocks, attacked by man,\r\nand wheedled out of practicable ground for corn and cabbages. There is\r\nNagasaki on a hill side, regularly built, every house peeping from its\r\nlittle nest of greens; and there is the Dutch factory, named Dezima.\r\nZima in Japanese means \"island,\" for this factory is built upon an\r\nisland. No Europeans but the Dutch; no Dutch except these managers of\r\ntrade who are locked up in Dezima, may traffic with Japan; and these may\r\ntraffic to the extent only of two ships yearly, subject to all manner of\r\nrestrictions. As for the resident Dutch, they are locked up in Dezima,\r\nwhich is an island made on purpose for them. As if three thousand, eight\r\nhundred and fifty were not enough, another little island, fan-shaped,\r\nwas built up out of the sea a few yards from the shore of Nagasaki.\r\nThere the Dutchmen live; a bridge connects their island with the\r\nmainland, but a high gate and a guard of soldiers prevent all\r\nunseasonable rambles. In another part of the town there is a factory\r\nallowed to the Chinese. Other strangers entering this port are treated\r\ncourteously, are supplied gratuitously with such necessaries as they\r\nwant, but are on no account allowed to see the town, still less to\r\npenetrate into the country, and are required to be gone about their\r\nbusiness as soon as possible. Strangers attempting entry at any other\r\nport belonging to Japan, are without ceremony fired upon as enemies. The\r\nadmitted Dutch traders are rigorously searched; every thing betraying\r\nChristianity is locked up; money and arms are removed, and hostages are\r\ntaken. Every man undergoes personal scrutiny. The Dutch are allowed no\r\nmoney. The Japanese authorities manage all sales for them; pay the\r\nminutest items of expenditure, and charge it on the profits of their\r\ntrade, which are then placed on the return vessel, not in money, but in\r\ngoods. The Japanese deal justly, even generously, in their way; but it\r\nis their way to allow the foreigners no money power. They restrict their\r\nexports almost wholly to camphor and copper, and allow no native\r\nworkmanship to go abroad. Yet among themselves, as between one island\r\nand another, commerce is encouraged to the utmost. The Japanese\r\nterritories range in the temperate zone through a good many degrees, and\r\ninclude all shades of climate between that of Liverpool and that of\r\nConstantinople. Between island and island, therefore, busy interchange\r\ntakes place by means of junks, like these which now surround us in the\r\nNagasaki harbor. You can observe how weak they look about the sterns,\r\nwith rudders insecure. The law compels them to be so; for that is an\r\nacute device by which they are prevented from travelling too far; they\r\ndare not trust themselves too boldly to the mercy of the sea, and as it\r\nis, many wrecked men accuse the prudence of their lawgivers. But life is\r\ncheap; the population of Japan is probably near thirty million,--and who\r\nshould care for a few dozen mariners?\r\n\r\nIf you please, we will now walk up into Nagasaki, with our phantom\r\ncloaks about us. Being in a region visited by earthquakes, of course we\r\nfind the houses of one story lightly built; they are built here of wood\r\nand clay with chopped straw,--coated over, like our town suburban\r\nvillas, with cement. Paper, instead of glass, for window panes, Venetian\r\nblinds, and around each house a verandah, we observe at once. But our\r\nattention is attracted from the houses to the people. How very awkwardly\r\nthey slip along! With so much energy and vigor in their faces, how is it\r\nthat they never thought of putting reasonable shoes upon their feet?\r\nThey wear instead of shoes mere soles of wood or matting, held to the\r\nfoot each by a peg which runs between the great toe and its neighbor,\r\nthrough a hole made for that purpose in the sock. These clouts they put\r\naway on entering a house, as we should put away umbrellas, and wear only\r\nsocks in-doors. Nevertheless the people here look handsome in their\r\nloose, wide gowns, bound by a girdle round the waist, with long sleeves,\r\nof which, by the bye, you may perceive that the dependent ends are\r\nJapanese coat-pockets. Thence you see yonder gentleman drawing his\r\nnose-paper,--one of the little squares of clean white paper always ready\r\nin the sleeve-pocket to serve the purpose of our handkerchief. That\r\nlittle square when used is, you see, thrown away; but if the gentleman\r\nwere in a house he would return it to his pocket, to be got rid of in a\r\nmore convenient place. The women's robes are like those of the men in\r\nform, but richer in material, more various with gold and color. As to\r\nthe head equipment, we observe, however, a great difference between the\r\nsexes. The men shave their own heads, leaving hair only at the back part\r\nand upon the temples, which they gather forward, and tie up into a tuft.\r\nThe women keep their entire crop of hair standing, and they make the\r\nmost of it; they spread it out into a turban, and stick through it not a\r\nfew pieces of polished tortoise-shell, as big as office rulers.[M]\r\nInviting admiration, the young beauty of Japan paints her face red and\r\nwhite, and puts a purple stain upon her lips; but the remaining touches\r\nare forbidden to a damsel till her heart is lost. The swain who seeks to\r\nmarry her, fixes outside her father's house a certain shrub; if this be\r\ntaken in-doors by the family, his suit he knows to be accepted; and when\r\nnext he gets a peep at his beloved, he watches with a palpitating heart\r\nthe movement of her lips, to see whether her teeth be blackened; for by\r\nblackened teeth she manifests the reciprocal affection. Only after\r\nmarriage, however, is the lady glorified with a permission not only to\r\nhave black teeth, but also to pull out her eyebrows.\r\n\r\nThose are not little beggars yonder trotting by that lady who is so\r\nmagnificently dressed; they are her children. The children of the\r\nJapanese are all dressed meanly, upon moral grounds. Notice those\r\ngentlemen who bow to one another; the ends of a scarf worn by each of\r\nthem exactly meet the ground, yet one bows lower than another, and they\r\ngo on walking in the bowed position until each has lost the other from\r\nhis sight. Those scarfs are regulated by the law; each man must bow so\r\nthat his scarf shall touch the ground, and it is so made long or short,\r\nthat he may humble himself more or less profoundly in exact accordance\r\nwith his rank.\r\n\r\nOf rank there are eight classes after the Mikado and the Ziogoon, whom\r\nwe shall come to visit in our travels presently. There are, one, the\r\nprinces; two, the nobles, who owe feudal service to the prince, or the\r\nempire; three, the priests; and four, the soldiers; these four form the\r\nhigher orders, and enjoy the privilege of wearing two swords and\r\npetticoat trousers. Class five counts as respectable; inferior officials\r\nand doctors constitute this class, and wear one sword with the trousers.\r\nMerchants and respectable tradesmen form class six, whose legs may not\r\npollute the trousers, though, by entering themselves as domestics to a\r\nman of rank, they may enjoy the privilege of carrying one sword. These\r\nare the only people by whom wealth can be accumulated. Class\r\nseven--artists, artisans, and petty shopkeepers. Class eight--day\r\nlaborers and peasants. Tradesmen who work on leather, tanners, &c., are\r\nexcluded from classification. They are defiled, and may not even live\r\nwith other men; they live in villages of their own, so thoroughly\r\nunrecognized, that Japanese authority, in measuring the miles along a\r\nroad, breaks off at the entrance of a currier's village, leaves it\r\nexcluded from his measurement, which is resumed upon the other side. So,\r\nif we travel post, we get through leather-sellers' villages for nothing.\r\n\r\nThese houses in Nagasaki, which at a distance looked so much like\r\nmansions, are the store-rooms wherein tradesmen keep their valuable\r\nstock, and families their valuable furniture. For desolating fires are\r\ncommon in the towns and cities of Japan; so common, that almost every\r\nhouse is prudently provided with a fire-proof store-room, having copper\r\nshutters to the windows, and the walls covered a foot thick with clay.\r\nAttached to each is a large vessel of liquid mud, with which the whole\r\nbuilding is smeared on an alarm of fire; and this method of\r\nfire-insurance is exceedingly effective, where there is nothing like a\r\nSun or Atlas Company to fall upon, and the most abstemious of fires eats\r\nup, at any rate, a street.\r\n\r\nThat door is open, and there is no horseshoe over it--there's not an\r\niron horseshoe in Japan,--so two ghosts slip into the house unperceived.\r\nFirst, here is a portico for palanquins, shoes, and umbrellas; into this\r\nthe kitchens open. In the back apartments we shall find the family. We\r\nwalk into the drawing-room, and there the master sits. It is most\r\nfortunate that we are now invisible; for, did we visit in the flesh, we\r\nshould be teased by the necessities of Japanese civility. That gentleman\r\nwould sit upon his heels before us; we should sit on our heels before\r\nhim; we should then all bow our heads as low as possible. Then we should\r\nmake compliments to one another, the answer to each being \"_He, he,\r\nhe!_\" Then pipes and tea would be brought in; after this we might begin\r\nto talk. Before we left we should receive sweetmeats on a sheet of white\r\npaper, in which it would be our duty to fold up whatever we did not eat,\r\nand put it in our pockets. Eat what you like, and pocket what remains,\r\nis Japanese good-breeding. At a dinner-party the servant of each guest\r\nbrings baskets, that he may take away his master's portion of the feast.\r\nThis master, however, is unconscious of our shadowy appearance, and\r\ncontinues busy with his book. It is Laplace, translated into Japanese,\r\nthrough Dutch. The Japanese are thoroughly alive to the advanced state\r\nof European science, and on those fixed occasions when the Dutchmen from\r\nthe factory visit the capital, the Dutch physician is invariably visited\r\nby the native physicians, naturalists, and astronomers, who display on\r\ntheir own parts wonderful acumen, and most dexterously pump for European\r\nknowledge. Scientific books in the Dutch language they translate and\r\npublish into Japanese. The country has not been shut up out of contempt\r\nfor foreigners, and native men of science have so diligently profited by\r\nopportunities afforded from without, that they construct by their own\r\nartificers, barometers, telescopes, make their own almanacks, and\r\ncalculate their own eclipses. Hovering about this gentleman, our eyes\r\ndetect at once that the impression on his page is taken from a wood-cut\r\nimitation of handwriting; movable types are not yet introduced into\r\nJapan. The writing, like Chinese, is up and down the page, and not\r\nacross it. Three or four different characters seem to be used\r\nindiscriminately, and some of them are certainly Chinese. The good folks\r\nof Dai Nippon are indebted to the Chinese for the first strong impulse\r\nto their civilization; not being themselves of Chinese origin, but a\r\ndistinct branch of the Mongolian family. Their language is quite\r\ndifferent, and has exceedingly long words, instead of being built up,\r\nlike Chinese, of mono-syllables. Japanese written in Chinese character\r\nis understood by any Chinaman; but so would English be, since Chinese\r\nwriting represents ideas. So, if a Spaniard writes five, an Englishman\r\nreads it as \"five,\" and understands correctly, yet the Spaniard would\r\ntell you that he wrote not \"five,\" but \"cinco.\"\r\n\r\nHovering still about this gentleman, and beguiled by the strangeness of\r\nall things we see into a curiosity like that of children, we admire his\r\nsword. The hilt is very beautiful, composed of various metals blended\r\ninto a fine enamel. This enamel is used in Japan where Europeans would\r\nuse jewels, because the art of cutting precious stones is not known to\r\nthe Japanese. For the blade of this sword it is not impossible that a\r\nsum has been given not unlike a hundred pounds; the tempering of steel\r\nis carried to perfection in Japan, where gentlemen are connoisseurs in\r\nsword-blades. Young nobles lend their maiden swords to the executioner\r\n(who is always chosen from the defiled leather-selling race) that they\r\nmay be tried upon real flesh and blood; as executions in Japan are\r\ngenerally cruel, and some criminals are hacked to death, rather than\r\nkilled outright, the swords on such occasions are refreshed with a fair\r\ntaste of blood. The mats upon the floor are the next things we notice. A\r\nthick matting of straw forms a substratum, over which are spread the\r\nfine mats, elegantly fringed. To see that lackered work inlaid with\r\nmother-of-pearl, which we familiarly call Japan, in its perfection, we\r\nmust evidently visit it at home. Any thing of the kind so exquisitely\r\nbeautiful as this little table, is not to be found in Europe. Whatever\r\ntrinkets pass out of these islands into Europe, do so _nayboen_--that\r\nis, with secret connivance--but the first-rate manufactures are in no\r\nway suffered to come to us. Without _nayboen_, life would be\r\ninsupportable in a minute wilderness of rules and customs. People even\r\ndie _nayboen_--that is, a man lies unburied, and is said to be alive,\r\nwhen his death otherwise would lead to disagreeable results. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, when rules are made intolerably strict, evasion is habitual.\r\nThe amount that cannot be evaded is astonishing enough, as we shall see\r\nere we return to England. Now we are in the house of this gentleman at\r\nNagasaki. His wife enters, and by their mutual behavior it is evident\r\nthat ladies in Japan are to their husbands very much what ladies are in\r\nEngland. This lady passes to the garden; the room ends with a projecting\r\nangle open to the garden on each side, a sort of bay, which every house\r\nhas; and if there be no more ground than just the supplementary\r\ntriangles on each side to complete the square, still there is always\r\nthat, and that is always quite enough, for want of more. It is enough to\r\nspend a fortune upon, in dwarf trees and vegetable curiosities. The\r\nJapanese shine like the Chinese in monstrosities. They can dwarf trees\r\nso well, that in a little box four inches square, President Meylan saw\r\ngrowing a fir, a bamboo, and a plum-tree, in full blossom. Or they\r\nhypertrophy plants if they please, until a radish is produced as large\r\nas a boy six years old. Their gardens, however small, are always laid\r\nout in landscape style, and each is adorned with a temple, not a mere\r\nornamental summerhouse, but the real shrine of a household god. Into\r\nthis garden walks the lady, and returns with a few flowers. She takes\r\nthese to an elegant shelf fixed in a recess of the apartment, upon which\r\na bouquet stands, and is engaged upon her nosegay. An act of taste? O\r\ndear, no; every drawing-room in Japan has such a shelf, with flowers\r\nplaced upon it; every lady entering who found her husband there, and\r\nmeant to talk with him, would in the first place make the nosegay talk,\r\nand say, \"The wife and husband are alone together.\" If company arrive,\r\nthe flowers must be otherwise adjusted; the position of every flower,\r\nand even of green leaves in that bouquet, is fixed by custom, which is\r\nlaw, to vary with the use to which the room is put. One of the most\r\ndifficult and necessary parts of female education in Japan is to acquire\r\na perfect knowledge of the rules laid down in a large book on the\r\narrangements of the drawing-room nosegay, in a manner suitable to every\r\ncase. It is the Japanese \"use of the globes\" to ladies' schools. To boys\r\nand girls, after reading and writing, which are taught (hear, England!)\r\nto the meanest Japanese, the most necessary part of education is an\r\nelaborate training in the ceremonial rules of life. Bows proper for\r\nevery occasion, elegant kotoos, the whole science and practice of\r\ngood-breeding, have to be learned through many tedious years. To boys\r\nthere is given special training in the hara-kiri, or the art of ripping\r\none's self up. Many occasions present themselves on which it as much\r\nconcerns the honor of a Japanese to cut himself open, as it concerned an\r\nEnglishman some years ago to fire a pistol at his friend. The occasions\r\nare so frequent, that a Japanese boys' school would be incomplete in\r\nwhich instruction was not given in this art of suicide. Boys practise\r\nall the details in dramatic fashion, and in after life, if a day come\r\nwhen disgrace, caused often by the deeds of other men, appears\r\ninevitable, he appoints a day, and according to the exigencies of the\r\ncase, before his family or his assembled connections, ceremoniously cuts\r\nopen his own belly at a solemn dinner. Dying in this way, he is said to\r\nhave died in the course of nature; dying before shame came to him, he is\r\nsaid to have died undisgraced, and so has saved his family from that\r\nparticipation in his fall which otherwise was imminent. Now we must\r\nleave this house, in which we have spent perhaps a little too much time:\r\nyet in the whole time we did not once hear the squalling of a baby,\r\nthough a baby was there certainly. If this should meet the eye of Mr.\r\nMeek, he is informed that in Japan, children, until they are three years\r\nold, are not allowed to wear any thing tight about their persons.\r\n\r\nNow we are once more in the streets of Nagasaki, and observe, that for a\r\ngentleman to turn his back upon a friend, is true politeness in this\r\nmost original of lands. It signifies that he who so turns is unworthy to\r\nbehold the face, &c. A bridal procession passes us; the bride in her\r\nlong white veil. There is a touch of poetry connected with that veil--it\r\nliterally is the shroud in which she will be buried.\r\n\r\nWe are out of town, now, and delighting in the open country. Exquisite\r\nviews of hill, and dale, and wood, and water, tempt the sight. Rice\r\nfields, of course, we pass; rice is a staple article of diet to the\r\nJapanese, as to so many other millions of the human race. It is the\r\nvegetable food that finds its way into more mouths than any other. There\r\nis wheat also in Japan, used chiefly for making cakes and soy; barley\r\nfor feeding cattle. The cattle being used as beasts of draught and\r\nburden, it is thought improper to kill them, or to deprive the young\r\ncalves of their milk; the Japanese, therefore, refrain from milk and\r\nbeef. They eat great quantities of fish, poultry, and venison. In the\r\ncountry gardens we see quinces, pears, plums, cherries, peaches,\r\noranges, and citrons too; bean-fields abound, and farms, of which the\r\nhedges are all tea. Where soil and climate favor, many a hillside in\r\nJapan is cultivated as a tea plantation; but beyond this the tea-plant\r\nis used by the farmers generally as a hedge from which they gather their\r\nown leaves, and dry tea for home use, just as our farmers brew their own\r\nOctober beer. Now we are flitting under cedar groves, now under firs,\r\nnow under mulberry plantations for the silkworm; every good point in the\r\nlandscape is occupied by a temple, which is composed of one large\r\nedifice and many little ones. The little ones are used by\r\npleasure-parties. There is a snake, and there you see in the tree a\r\nlong-tailed monkey (_Inuus speciosus_); there is no other kind of monkey\r\nin these islands, and the snakes are all of a species found nowhere\r\nelse. The tree frog and the eatable frog live in the north of Nippon.\r\nHere we have squirrels. There are no lions and tigers; there is not a\r\nsingle animal of the cat tribe known upon these islands; you can meet\r\nwith nothing worse than a wild boar. Great pains are taken to destroy\r\nthe foxes. Here are pheasants without game-laws, and the peacock yonder\r\nlooks as if he felt himself at home. Several palanquins have passed us\r\non the road, varying much in shape and minor details. The shape of the\r\npalanquin, the length of the poles, their position, the way in which\r\nthey are held, and the number of holders, all are fixed so as to accord\r\nprecisely with the rank of the good gentleman inside. The number of\r\nattendants in the train, even of an inconsiderable man, is startling;\r\nand as for a prince, he might be setting out to conquer China. The roads\r\nare good, and there is no lack of horsemen, but we have not seen draught\r\ncarriages; perhaps these hills are an impediment to travelling by such\r\nconveyance; roads over hills and mountains being simply flights of\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nHollo! What couple scampers by in such a hurry? 'Tis the post: the\r\ngreatest princes must get out of its way. One man runs with the letters,\r\nand another keeps pace with him, to supply his place in case of illness\r\nor accident; if both posts fail, the nearest man, whatever be his\r\ndignity, must do their work for them. These posts are never horsed; but\r\neach pair, at the conclusion of a stage, finds the next couple waiting\r\nto catch the important bundle thrown to them, and set off instantly,\r\nbefore the spent runners have reached the spot where they may halt and\r\nget their wind again. Goods are conveyed on packhorses or oxen over\r\nland, but water transit by lakes, rivers, or canals, is much more\r\ncommon. The roads are well swept, for the farmers on each side\r\ndiligently scrape up all manure; and as men with brooms clear all away\r\nbefore a traveller of rank, the highway is kept in a very neat\r\ncondition. Men selling straw clouts for travellers, and straw shoes for\r\nthe horses, which require, of course, frequent renewal, pick up a living\r\nby the roadside, and we pass them frequently. Observe that mighty\r\ncamphor-tree, which every traveller has mentioned. To Kaempfer it was\r\nvenerable for its age in the year 1691; still it is healthy, and so\r\nlarge that fifteen men can stand within its hollow. Hot-springs, of\r\ncourse, we pass in a volcanic country. There is a coal-mine also here,\r\nthough charcoal is the fuel usually burned.\r\n\r\nWe have now crossed Kiusiu, and reached the seaport of Kokura, where we\r\nfind our Phantom Ship in readiness to take us through a sea covered with\r\nislets, to the large island of Nippon. We shall disembark, and travel\r\nvery rapidly through Ohosaka to Miyako, where the divine Mikado holds\r\nhis court. We pass some strange-looking men covered with matting, each\r\nof whom has in his hand a long wooden spoon. The spoon is their\r\ncockle-shell, for they are pilgrims travelling in the most pious form,\r\nas beggars, to the shrine of their own goddess. This pilgrimage is made\r\nby all good Japanese--the oftener the better, especially as they grow\r\nold, because they get each time full absolution from the priests for\r\ntheir past sins.\r\n\r\nThe sun goddess and the Mikado are allied together; and as we now are\r\njourneying towards a seat of government, we can do nothing better than\r\ndiscuss the Japanese religion. It begins with an Oriental \"once upon a\r\ntime,\" of gods who reigned for a few millions of years apiece, above\r\nwhom there was, and is, and ever will be, one supreme God, free from\r\ncare. The last of seven royal gods said to his wife one day, \"There's\r\nearth somewhere, I'm sure!\" and so he poked about with his spear in the\r\nwater, feeling for it. Drops falling from his spear-point made the\r\nislands of Japan. Then this god made eight millions of other gods, and\r\nalso created the ten thousand things. Having ordered matters to his\r\nsatisfaction, he made a present of his Japanese earth to his pet\r\ndaughter, the sun goddess. The sun goddess reigned only two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand years, and her four successors filled the next two\r\nmillion; the last of the four, being the great-great-grandson of the sun\r\ngoddess, fancied a mortal life, and left a mortal boy, who reigned on\r\nearth, and was the first Mikado: from him all Mikados are descended.\r\nThis is the native Japanese religion, called Sintoo; worshipping the sun\r\ngoddess, and _Kami_, which are minor gods or saints. The Sintoos bow\r\nbefore no images, but put as emblems in their temples a sheet of white\r\npaper and a mirror, to denote the soul pure and incapable of stain. The\r\nworshipper kneels, gazes at the mirror, offers sacrifice of fruit or\r\nrice, deposits money, and retires. Upon this creed Buddhism has been\r\ngrafted; but the religion of the learned Japanese is Sintoo--a\r\nphilosophic moral doctrine which they cherish secretly, while outwardly\r\nobserving rites prescribed by custom.\r\n\r\nBut _revenons a nos Mikados_: the first Mikado, though of fabulous\r\ndescent, is an historical person, Zin-mu-teen-woo, and with him Japanese\r\nhistory begins--at a period from whence we date rational annals in some\r\nother countries, about 660 B.C. We will note those points of history\r\nthat are essential to a comprehension of the present government. Mikados\r\nfollowed each other, sole rulers and powerful, until they fell into a\r\ntrick of abdicating in favor of their children, and then doing the duty\r\nwithout being annoyed by the ceremonies of their office. That had its\r\ninconvenient results, for presently came one Mikado who married the\r\ndaughter of a powerful papa; and when the time came for retirement, and\r\nhe had abdicated in favor of a son three years old, the powerful papa\r\nthrust him aside into a prison, and usurped the regency. A civil war was\r\nthe result of this; Yoritomo leaped up as champion of the imprisoned\r\nman, so recently a king, released him, and restored him to the regency\r\nover his infant son. For this essential service good Yoritomo was made a\r\nsort of field-marshal, or Ziogoon. The ex-Mikado dying, left Yoritomo\r\nthe guardian of his son; and so for twenty years the Ziogoon was regent.\r\nInfant Mikados still continuing to be the fashion, regency became\r\nhereditary to the Ziogoons; and these last being men, it eventually came\r\nto pass that the Mikado was stripped of all power, and converted into a\r\nmagnificent doll, while the real court was transferred to Jeddo, where\r\nthe Ziogoons reside. Retributive justice we shall meet with in a little\r\nwhile, but we have now reached Miyako, the Mikado's residence, and\r\nnominally still the capital of Nippon.\r\n\r\nPoor Mikado, what a miserable honor he must think it is to be divine! He\r\nrepresents the sun goddess on earth, and is required to sit upon his\r\nthrone quite still, and without moving his head for several hours every\r\nday, lest the whole earth should be unsteady. When not sitting, he must\r\nleave his crown upon the throne to keep watch in his absence. Being so\r\nvery holy, he is deprived of all use of his legs; earth is not worthy of\r\nhis tread. His nails and hair are never cut--for who may mutilate a god?\r\nEvery article of dress that he puts on must be brand new; his plates,\r\nand cups, and dishes, every thing he touches at a meal--even the kitchen\r\nutensils used in cooking for him--must not be used twice, and of course\r\nno profane man may employ what has been sanctified by the Mikado's use.\r\nWhatever clothes he puts off are immediately burned; his pots and\r\nvessels are destroyed. This hourly waste being a heavy pull on the\r\nfinances of the Ziogoon, the divine victim gets only the coarsest slops\r\nto dress in, and eats off the cheapest crockery. No wonder that he still\r\nkeeps up the fashion of resigning. His palace is circumscribed with\r\npalisades, and an officer residing without the gate spies all his\r\nactions, and reports them to the Ziogoon. Still the poor fellow is\r\ndivine. The gods, it is believed, all spend a month at his place, during\r\nwhich month they are not at home in their own temples, and worship is\r\naccordingly suspended. The Mikado grants religious titles, fixes feasts\r\nand fasts, and settles doctrinal disputes. Thus there arose once schism\r\nin Japan about the color of the devil. Four factions respectfully\r\ndeclared him to be black, white, red, and green. The theologic knot was\r\ngiven to the Mikado that day to unravel, who, knowing the obstinacy of\r\ntheologians well, declared all parties to be right; and so the devil of\r\nJapan remains to this day a four-colored monster. Offices of state in\r\nthe Mikado's court--the Dairi it is called--are above all in honor,\r\nobjects of ambition even to the Ziogoon. The dwellers in the Dairi with\r\nthe holy prisoner, both male and female, are the most refined and\r\ncultivated Japanese. From their ranks are supplied the poets of the\r\nland, who sing the beauties of the rapid Oyewaga, or legends of the\r\nsnow-capped Foesi.\r\n\r\nMiyako is the classic ground, the Athens of Japan. But we must go on to\r\nthe Japanese London, Jeddo, the real capital, a grand metropolis, with\r\nabout one million, six hundred thousand inhabitants. Of course there is\r\na wilderness of suburb; there are endless streets; there is a river\r\nthrough the town which flows into the bay, from which this capital is\r\nnot far distant. There are bridges; there is a vast multitude of people\r\nthronging to and fro; there are shops, signs, inscriptions. We will walk\r\ninto a theatre; for here, as in the days of AEschylus, performances take\r\nplace by day. There is a pit, and there are tiers of elegant seats,\r\nwhich answer to our boxes; the scenery and dresses are handsome, only in\r\nscene painting there is no perspective. As in the early European drama,\r\nthe subjects illustrated are the deeds of gods and heroes; not more than\r\ntwo speakers occupy the scene at once; boys act the female characters.\r\nSeveral pieces are performed, each piece divided into acts, and the plan\r\nis to give after Act I. of the first play, Act I. of the second, and\r\nthen to begin the third, before taking the series of second acts. As\r\neach actor in each piece plays also several parts, one might consider\r\nthis arrangement to be rather puzzling. Gentlemen go out after the act\r\nof any piece they wish to hear, and attend to other matters till the\r\nnext act of the same piece shall come on; but ladies sit with pleasure\r\nthrough the whole. Dear souls! they steal a march upon our feminine box\r\nornaments; for they bring with them a collection of dresses to the play,\r\nslip out during each pause to change their clothes, and reappear, to\r\ncatch the admiration of beholders, every time in a new costume.\r\n\r\nThe palace of the Ziogoon covers much ground, being in fact a rural\r\nscene--a palace and a park, locked up within the town. As for the\r\nZiogoon, he also is locked up within his trenches. To understand how he\r\nis fettered, and, at the same time, how all the people of Japan have\r\ncome to be locked up, we must pursue our little thread of history.\r\nYoritomo established, as we said, the power of the Ziogoons, which\r\nflourished for a long time. Kublah Khan endeavored to make Nippon\r\nsubject to him; but without success, winds and waves fighting with the\r\nJapanese. Mongolians were forbidden then to touch Japanese ground, but a\r\ncentury later friendly relations were restored with China. In 1543, two\r\nPortuguese, Antonio Moto and Francesco Zeimoto, landed in Japan,\r\nexciting great interest among a mercantile people, trading at that time,\r\nit is said, with sixteen foreign nations. The Portuguese taught new\r\narts, they brought new wares, and they were welcomed eagerly; some of\r\nthem settled, and were married in Japan. The Jesuits came, too, with\r\nChristianity, and their preaching was abundantly successful. Now, it so\r\nhappened that about the same time, when the Portuguese first arrived, a\r\ncivil war was waged between two brothers, for the dignity of Ziogoon.\r\nBoth brothers perished in this war, and then the vassal princes fought\r\nover the fallen bone. Nobunaga, the most powerful of these, was aided\r\nby a person of obscure birth, named Hide-yosi. Nobunaga became Ziogoon,\r\nfavored the Christians, and invested Hide-yosi with high military rank.\r\nAn usurper murdered Nobunaga, was then himself murdered, and left vacant\r\na seat which Hide-yosi was now strong enough to seize. He took the name\r\nof Tayko, and is the great hero of the annals of Japan. He it was who\r\ncontinued the robbery of the Mikado's power, and secured himself against\r\nrevolt by establishing a system of check over the princes, which\r\nprevails to this day. He left a son bearing the name of Hide-yosi, six\r\nyears old, and to secure his power, married him to the daughter of\r\nJyeyas, a strong papa. Jyeyas played the usurper, of course, and a large\r\nfaction supported the young Hide-yosi, whom he had sworn to guard. The\r\nboy was Christian at heart; his cause, also, was just; the Jesuits,\r\ntherefore, and the great body of the Christians warmly took his part.\r\nHad he maintained his right successfully, Christianity would have become\r\nthe state religion in Japan. Jyeyas conquered, and the Christians,\r\npersecuted, afterwards rebelling, they were rooted out--regarded as a\r\nsect politically hostile. Their rebellion broke loose in the\r\nprincipality of Arima; the Prince of Arima drove the insurgents, seventy\r\nthousand in number, to the peninsula of Simabara, where they stood at\r\nbay. Since they were not to be dislodged, the Dutch, then settled at\r\nFirato, were desired to aid the government; accordingly they sent a\r\nman-of-war, which fired upon the Christians and sealed their fate. To\r\nthis service the Dutch were indebted for their permission to retain one\r\nfactory. All other Christians were destroyed or expelled, and since\r\nthose days every stranger has been required, exempting the Dutch\r\nfactory, to trample on an image of the Saviour, as an evidence of his\r\nnot being a Christian interloper.\r\n\r\nTo finish our history, we must record that Jyeyas, having established\r\nhis own usurpation, completed the reduction of the Mikado to a state of\r\nhelplessness; completed the fettering of the princes, and the protective\r\nsystem of espial; and being deified, on death, under the name, of\r\nGongen, was the founder of the Gongen dynasty of Ziogoons, which still\r\nrules in Japan, and still adheres to the protective system. But in\r\ncourse of time the power of the Ziogoons has waned; the Ziogoon himself\r\nis now a puppet to his council, which is governed by a president, who by\r\nno means is able to do what he likes.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how all the Japanese are tied and bound, and kept in\r\nprofound peace. In the first place, nearly half the population are\r\nofficials in pay, and the whole empire is sprinkled thickly with spies,\r\nsome public and official, who may intrude where they please, others\r\nconcealed and not acknowledged, although paid, by government.\r\nFurthermore, every householder is required to watch the actions of his\r\nfive intermediate neighbors, and to keep a sharp eye upon movements\r\nopposite. Every prince is assisted in his government by two secretaries,\r\nwhom the court appoints, one to reside with him, and the other to reside\r\nat Jeddo. These take every act of government out of his hands. The\r\nsecretary, who lives with him, watches him, and acts upon instructions\r\nfrom the secretary who resides at Jeddo, who again is prompted by the\r\ncouncil. Not only does the prince live surrounded by a mob of unknown\r\nspies, but he is obliged, every alternate year, to leave his\r\nprincipality and to reside at Jeddo; his wife and family are always kept\r\nat Jeddo in the character of hostages. Furthermore, pains are taken to\r\nprevent a prince from being rich. He is required at Jeddo to impoverish\r\nhimself by displays of pomp; and if his purse be long, the Ziogoon\r\ninvites himself to dinner with him; an honor great enough to ruin any\r\nnoble in Japan. Similar checks are upon all governors of towns and all\r\nofficials. Any neglect reported by a spy, any infraction of a rule,\r\nthreatens disgrace, and makes it necessary to perform the act of suicide\r\nbefore described. So it was not without cause that they were taught at\r\nschool the hara-kiri. Perhaps you think the council is omnipotent. Far\r\nfrom it. The council may, indeed, make any law, which will be submitted\r\nby the president for sanction to the Ziogoon. Then, should the Ziogoon\r\nrefuse his signature, and differ in opinion from the council, if he\r\nblame the law, the question is submitted to the Ziogoon's three next of\r\nkin, and they are umpires. If these decide against the Ziogoon, he is\r\ndeposed immediately; if they decide against the council, then its\r\npresident and members must rip themselves up.\r\n\r\nYet still this tyranny of custom, which would seem to be so burdensome\r\nto all, goes on, because all are so bound that none can begin to stir.\r\nThe Japanese, as we have partly been able to see, are an acute\r\nrace--they have original and thinking minds; with a dash of Asiatic\r\nfierceness, they are generous, joyous, sympathetic. They love picnic\r\nparties and music, with a buffoon; who first encourages them to throw\r\noff restraint, to laugh and riot in good-nature; and, assuming then his\r\nsecond office, draws himself up demurely, to give all a lesson in\r\npoliteness. The buffoons who go for hire to promote mirth with a\r\npleasure-party, go also as masters of the ceremonies. The treatment of\r\nGolownin, as a prisoner, will also illustrate the nature of the\r\nJapanese. In moving from one prison to another, he walked, bound so\r\ntightly with thin cords that they cut wounds into his flesh. These\r\nwounds the soldiers dressed every evening, but did not slacken any\r\nstring; they said that he was fettered in the customary way. Yet these\r\nmen willingly would take him on their backs, to carry him, when he was\r\nfoot-sore; people in the villages were gladly suffered to show sympathy\r\nby feeding him with pleasant things as he passed through; and when he\r\nhad made efforts to escape; which, if successful, would have entailed\r\nhara-kiri on his guards; they still showed no abatement of good-nature.\r\n\r\nUnder the main bridge of Jeddo lies our Phantom Ship, and from the heart\r\nof that great city of the East we float out to the sea. It does not take\r\nus long to get to Tower Stairs;--and now a Phantom Cab will take you\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[M] Hats are not used by either sex except in rainy weather, but every\r\nJapanese carries a fan; even the beggar yonder holds his fan to that\r\nyoung lady, whereupon she drops her charitable gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL:\r\n\r\nOR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 409._\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V. CONTINUED.--CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLeonard had been about six weeks with his uncle, and those weeks were\r\nwell spent. Mr. Richard had taken him to his counting-house, and\r\ninitiated him into business and the mysteries of double entry; and, in\r\nreturn for the young man's readiness and zeal in matters which the acute\r\ntrader instinctively felt were not exactly to his tastes, Richard\r\nengaged the best master the town afforded to read with his nephew in the\r\nevening. This gentleman was the head-usher of a large school--who had\r\nhis hours to himself after eight o'clock--and was pleased to vary the\r\ndull routine of enforced lessons by instructions to a pupil who took\r\ndelightedly--even to the Latin grammar. Leonard made rapid strides, and\r\nlearned more in those six weeks than many a cleverish boy does in twice\r\nas many months. These hours which Leonard devoted to study Richard\r\nusually spent from home--sometimes at the houses of his grand\r\nacquaintances in the Abbey Gardens, sometimes in the reading-room\r\nappropriated to those aristocrats. If he stayed at home, it was in\r\ncompany with his head clerk, and for the purpose of checking his account\r\nbooks, or looking over the names of doubtful electors.\r\n\r\nLeonard had naturally wished to communicate his altered prospects to his\r\nold friends, that they in turn might rejoice his mother with such good\r\ntidings. But he had not been two days in the house before Richard had\r\nstrictly forbidden all such correspondence.\r\n\r\n\"Look you,\" said he, \"at present we are on an experiment--we must see if\r\nwe like each other. Suppose we don't, you will only have raised\r\nexpectations in your mother which must end in bitter disappointment; and\r\nsuppose we do, it will be time enough to write when something definite\r\nis settled.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my mother will be so anxious--\"\r\n\r\n\"Make your mind easy on that score. I will write regularly to Mr. Dale,\r\nand he can tell her that you are well and thriving. No more words, my\r\nman--when I say a thing, I say it.\" Then, observing that Leonard looked\r\nblank and dissatisfied, Richard added, with a good-humored smile, \"I\r\nhave my reasons for all this--you shall know them later. And I tell you\r\nwhat,--if you do as I bid you, it is my intention to settle something\r\nhandsome on your mother; but if you don't, devil a penny she'll get from\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nWith that Richard turned on his heel, and in a few moments his voice was\r\nheard loud in objurgation with some of his people.\r\n\r\nAbout the fourth week of Leonard's residence at Mr. Avenel's, his host\r\nbegan to evince a certain change of manner. He was no longer quite so\r\ncordial with Leonard, nor did he take the same interest in his progress.\r\nAbout the same period he was frequently caught by the London butler\r\nbefore the looking-glass. He had always been a smart man in his dress,\r\nbut he was now more particular. He would spoil three white cravats when\r\nhe went out of an evening, before he could satisfy himself as to a tie.\r\nHe also bought a Peerage, and it became his favorite study at odd\r\nquarters of an hour. All these symptoms proceeded from a cause, and that\r\ncause was--Woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe first people at Screwstown were indisputably the Pompleys. Colonel\r\nPompley was grand, but Mrs. Pompley was grander. The colonel was stately\r\nin right of his military rank and his services in India; Mrs. Pompley\r\nwas majestic in right of her connections. Indeed, Colonel Pompley\r\nhimself would have been crushed under the weight of the dignities which\r\nhis lady heaped upon him, if he had not been enabled to prop his\r\nposition with \"a connection\" of his own. He would never have held his\r\nown, nor been permitted to have an independent opinion on matters\r\naristocratic, but for the well-sounding name of his relations, \"the\r\nDigbies.\" Perhaps on the principle that obscurity increases the natural\r\nsize of objects, and is an element of the sublime, the Colonel did not\r\ntoo accurately define his relations \"the Digbies;\" he let it be casually\r\nunderstood that they were the Digbies to be found in Debrett. But if\r\nsome indiscreet _Vulgarian_ (a favorite word with both the Pompleys)\r\nasked point-blank if he meant \"my Lord Digby,\" the Colonel, with a lofty\r\nair, answered--\"The elder branch, sir.\" No one at Screwstown had ever\r\nseen these Digbies: they lay amidst the Far--the Recondite--even to the\r\nwife of Colonel Pompley's bosom. Now and then, when the Colonel referred\r\nto the lapse of years, and the uncertainty of human affections, he would\r\nsay--\"When young Digby and I were boys together,\" and then add with a\r\nsigh, \"but we shall never meet again in this world. His family interest\r\nsecured him a valuable appointment in a distant part of the British\r\ndominions.\" Mrs. Pompley was always rather cowed by the Digbies. She\r\ncould not be skeptical as to this connection, for the Colonel's mother\r\nwas certainly a Digby, and the Colonel impaled the Digby arms. _En\r\nrevanche_, as the French say, for these marital connections, Mrs.\r\nPompley had her own favorite affinity, which she specially selected from\r\nall others when she most desired to produce effect; nay, even upon\r\nordinary occasions the name rose spontaneously to her lips--the name of\r\nthe Honorable Mrs. M'Catchley. Was the fashion of a gown or cap\r\nadmired, her cousin, Mrs. M'Catchley, had just sent to her the pattern\r\nfrom Paris. Was it a question whether the Ministry would stand, Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley was in the secret, but Mrs. Pompley had been requested not to\r\nsay. Did it freeze, \"my cousin, Mrs. M'Catchley, had written word that\r\nthe icebergs at the Pole were supposed to be coming this way.\" Did the\r\nsun glow with more than usual fervor, Mrs. M'Catchley had informed her\r\n\"that it was Sir Henry Halford's decided opinion that it was on account\r\nof the cholera.\" The good people knew all that was doing at London, at\r\ncourt, in this world--nay, almost in the other--through the medium of\r\nthe Honorable Mrs. M'Catchley. Mrs. M'Catchley was, moreover, the most\r\nelegant of women, the wittiest creature, the dearest. King George the\r\nFourth had presumed to admire Mrs. M'Catchley, but Mrs. M'Catchley,\r\nthough no prude, let him see that she was proof against the corruptions\r\nof a throne. So long had the ears of Mrs. Pompley's friends been filled\r\nwith the renown of Mrs. M'Catchley, that at last Mrs. M'Catchley was\r\nsecretly supposed to be a myth, a creature of the elements, a poetic\r\nfiction of Mrs. Pompley's. Richard Avenel, however, though by no means a\r\ncredulous man, was an implicit believer in Mrs. M'Catchley. He had\r\nlearned that she was a widow--an honorable by birth, an honorable by\r\nmarriage--living on her handsome jointure, and refusing offers every day\r\nthat she so lived. Somehow or other, whenever Richard Avenel thought of\r\na wife, he thought of the Honorable Mrs. M'Catchley. Perhaps that\r\nromantic attachment to the fair invisible preserved him heart-whole\r\namongst the temptations of Screwstown. Suddenly, to the astonishment of\r\nthe Abbey Gardens, Mrs. M'Catchley proved her identity, and arrived at\r\nColonel Pompley's in a handsome travelling-carriage, attended by her\r\nmaid and footman. She had come to stay some weeks--a tea-party was given\r\nin her honor. Mr. Avenel and his nephew were invited, Colonel Pompley,\r\nwho kept his head clear in the midst of the greatest excitement, had a\r\ndesire to get from the corporation a lease of a piece of ground\r\nadjoining his garden, and he no sooner saw Richard Avenel enter, than he\r\ncaught him by the button, and drew him into a quiet corner in order to\r\nsecure his interest. Leonard, meanwhile, was borne on by the stream,\r\ntill his progress was arrested by a sofa table at which sate Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley herself, with Mrs. Pompley by her side. For on this great\r\noccasion the hostess had abandoned her proper post at the entrance, and,\r\nwhether to show her respect to Mrs. M'Catchley, or to show Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley her well-bred contempt for the people of Screwstown, remained\r\nin state by her friend, honoring only the _elite_ of the town with\r\nintroductions to the illustrious visitor.\r\n\r\nMrs. M'Catchley was a very fine woman--a woman who justified Mrs.\r\nPompley's pride in her. Her cheekbones were rather high, it is true, but\r\nthat proved the purity of her Caledonian descent; for the rest, she had\r\na brilliant complexion, heightened by a _soupcon_ of rouge--good-eyes\r\nand teeth, a showy figure, and all the ladies of Screwstown pronounced\r\nher dress to be perfect. She might have arrived at that age at which one\r\nintends to stop for the next ten years, but even a Frenchman would not\r\nhave called her _passee_--that is, for a widow. For a spinster, it would\r\nhave been different.\r\n\r\nLooking round her with a glass, which Mrs. Pompley was in the habit of\r\ndeclaring that \"Mrs. M'Catchley used like an angel,\" this lady suddenly\r\nperceived Leonard Avenel; and his quiet, simple, thoughtful air and\r\nlooks so contrasted with the stiff beaux, to whom she had been\r\npresented, that experienced in fashion as so fine a personage must be\r\nsupposed to be, she was nevertheless deceived into whispering to Mrs.\r\nPompley--\r\n\r\n\"That young man has really an _air distingue_--who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Mrs. Pompley, in unaffected surprise, \"that is the nephew of\r\nthe rich Vulgarian I was telling you of this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! and you say that he is Mr. Arundel's heir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Avenel--not Arundel--my sweet friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Avenel is not a bad name,\" said Mrs. M'Catchley. \"But is the uncle\r\nreally so rich?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Colonel was trying this very day to guess what he is worth; but he\r\nsays it is impossible to guess it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the young man is his heir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is thought so: and reading for college, I hear. They say he is\r\nclever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Present him, my love: I like clever people,\" said Mrs. M'Catchley,\r\nfalling back languidly.\r\n\r\nAbout ten minutes afterwards, Richard Avenel, having effected his escape\r\nfrom the Colonel, and his gaze being attracted towards the sofa table by\r\nthe buzz of the admiring crowd, beheld his nephew in animated\r\nconversation with the long-cherished idol of his dreams. A fierce pang\r\nof jealousy shot through his breast. His nephew never looked so handsome\r\nand so intelligent; in fact, poor Leonard had never before been drawn\r\nout by a woman of the world, who had learned how to make the most of\r\nwhat little she knew. And, as jealousy operates like a pair of bellows\r\non incipient flames, so, at first sight of the smile which the fair\r\nwidow bestowed upon Leonard, the heart of Mr. Avenel felt in a blaze.\r\n\r\nHe approached with a step less assured than usual, and, overhearing\r\nLeonard's talk, marvelled much at the boy's audacity. Mrs. M'Catchley\r\nhad been speaking of Scotland and the Waverly Novels, about which\r\nLeonard knew nothing. But he knew Burns, and on Burns he grew artlessly\r\neloquent. Burns the poet and peasant; Leonard might well be eloquent on\r\n_him_. Mrs. M'Catchley was amused and pleased with his freshness and\r\n_naivete_, so unlike any thing she had ever heard or seen, and she drew\r\nhim on and on, till Leonard fell to quoting: And Richard heard, with\r\nless respect for the sentiment than might be supposed, that\r\n\r\n    \"Rank is but the guinea stamp,\r\n    The man's the gowd for a' that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" exclaimed Mr. Avenel. \"Pretty piece of politeness to tell that\r\nto a lady like the Honorable Mrs. M'Catchley. You'll excuse him, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" said Mrs. M'Catchley, startled, and lifting her glass. Leonard,\r\nrather confused, rose, and offered his chair to Richard, who dropped\r\ninto it. The lady, without waiting for formal introduction, guessed that\r\nshe saw the rich uncle.\r\n\r\n\"Such a sweet poet--Burns!\" said she, dropping her glass. \"And it is so\r\nrefreshing to find so much youthful enthusiasm,\" she added, pointing her\r\nfan towards Leonard, who was receding fast among the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he is youthful, my nephew--rather green!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say green!\" said Mrs. M'Catchley. Richard blushed scarlet. He was\r\nafraid he had committed himself to some expression low and shocking. The\r\nlady resumed, \"Say unsophisticated.\"\r\n\r\n\"A tarnation long word,\" thought Richard; but he prudently bowed, and\r\nheld his tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Young men nowadays,\" continued Mrs. M'Catchley, resettling herself on\r\nthe sofa, \"affect to be so old. They don't dance, and they don't read,\r\nand they don't talk much; and a great many of them wear _toupets_ before\r\nthey are two-and-twenty!\"\r\n\r\nRichard mechanically passed his hand through his thick curls. But he was\r\nstill mute; he was still ruefully chewing the cud of the epithet\r\n_green_. What occult horrid meaning did the word convey to ears polite?\r\nWhy should he not say \"green?\"\r\n\r\n\"A very fine young man your nephew, sir,\" resumed Mrs. M'Catchley.\r\n\r\nRichard grunted.\r\n\r\n\"And seems full of talent Not yet at the University? Will he go to\r\nOxford or Cambridge!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not made up my mind yet, if I shall send him to the University\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\n\"A young man of his expectations!\" exclaimed Mrs. M'Catchley, artfully.\r\n\r\n\"Expectations!\" repeated Richard, firing up. \"Has the boy been talking\r\nto you of his expectations?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, sir. But the nephew of the rich Mr. Avenel. Ah, one hears a\r\ngreat deal, you know, of rich people; it is the penalty of wealth, Mr.\r\nAvenel!\"\r\n\r\nRichard was very much flattered. His crest rose.\r\n\r\n\"And they say,\" continued Mrs. M'Catchley, dropping out her words very\r\nslowly, as she adjusted her blonde scarf, \"that Mr. Avenel has resolved\r\nnot to marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil they do, ma'am!\" bolted out Richard, gruffly; and then,\r\nashamed of his _lapsus linguae_, screwed up his lips firmly, and glared\r\non the company with an eye of indignant fire.\r\n\r\nMrs. M'Catchley observed him over her fan. Richard turned abruptly, and\r\nshe withdrew her eyes modestly, and raised the fan.\r\n\r\n\"She's a real beauty,\" said Richard, between his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe fan fluttered.\r\n\r\nFive minutes afterwards, the widow and the bachelor seemed so much at\r\ntheir ease that Mrs. Pompley--who had been forced to leave her friend,\r\nin order to receive the Dean's lady--could scarcely believe her eyes\r\nwhen she returned to the sofa.\r\n\r\nNow, it was from that evening that Mr. Richard Avenel exhibited the\r\nchange of mood which I have described. And from that evening he\r\nabstained from taking Leonard with him to any of the parties in the\r\nAbbey Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSome days after this memorable _soiree_, Colonel Pompley sat alone in\r\nhis drawing-room (which opened pleasantly on an old-fashioned garden)\r\nabsorbed in the house bills. For Colonel Pompley did not leave that\r\ndomestic care to his lady--perhaps she was too grand for it. Colonel\r\nPompley with his own sonorous voice ordered the joints, and with his own\r\nheroic hand dispensed the stores. In justice to the Colonel, I must\r\nadd--at whatever risk of offence to the fair sex--that there was not a\r\nhouse at Screwstown so well managed as the Pompleys'; none which so\r\nsuccessfully achieved the difficult art of uniting economy with show. I\r\nshould despair of conveying to you an idea of the extent to which\r\nColonel Pompley made his income go. It was but seven hundred a-year; and\r\nmany a family contrive to do less upon three thousand. To be sure, the\r\nPompleys had no children to sponge upon them. What they had, they spent\r\nall on themselves. Neither, if the Pompleys never exceeded their income,\r\ndid they pretend to live much within it. The two ends of the year met at\r\nChristmas--just met, and no more.\r\n\r\nColonel Pompley sat at his desk. He was in his well brushed blue\r\ncoat--buttoned across his breast--his gray trowsers fitted tight to his\r\nlimbs, and fastened under his boots with a link chain. He saved a great\r\ndeal of money in straps. No one ever saw Colonel Pompley in\r\ndressing-gown and slippers. He and his house were alike in order--always\r\nfit to be seen--\r\n\r\n    \"From morn to noon, from noon to dewy eve.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was a short compact man, inclined to be stout--with a very\r\nred face, that seemed not only shaved, but rasped. He wore his hair\r\ncropped close, except just in front, where it formed what the\r\nhairdresser called a feather; but it seemed a feather of iron, so stiff\r\nand so strong was it. Firmness and precision were emphatically marked\r\non the Colonel's countenance. There was a resolute strain on his\r\nfeatures, as if he was always employed in making the two ends meet!\r\n\r\nSo he sat before his house-book, with his steel pen in his hand, and\r\nmaking crosses here and notes of interrogation there. \"Mrs. M'Catchley's\r\nmaid,\" said the Colonel to himself, \"must be put upon rations. The tea\r\nthat she drinks! Good Heavens!--tea again!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a modest ring at the outer door. \"Too early for a visitor!\"\r\nthought the Colonel. \"Perhaps it is the water rates.\"\r\n\r\nThe neat man-servant--never seen, beyond the offices, save in _grande\r\ntenue_, plushed and powdered--entered, and bowed.\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman, sir, wishes to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"A gentleman,\" repeated the Colonel, glancing towards the clock. \"Are\r\nyou sure it is a gentleman?\"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated. \"Why, sir, I ben't exactly sure; but he speaks like a\r\ngentleman. He do say he comes from London to see you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nA long and interesting correspondence was then being held between the\r\nColonel and one of his wife's trustees touching the investment of Mrs.\r\nPompley's fortune. It might be the trustee--nay, it must be. The trustee\r\nhad talked of running down to see him.\r\n\r\n\"Let him come in,\" said the Colonel; \"and when I ring--sandwiches and\r\nsherry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beef, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ham.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel put aside his house-book, and wiped his pen.\r\n\r\nIn another minute the door opened, and the servant announced\r\n\r\n    \"MR. DIGBY.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel's face fell, and he staggered back.\r\n\r\nThe door closed, and Mr. Digby stood in the middle of the room, leaning\r\non the great writing-table for support. The poor soldier looked sicklier\r\nand shabbier, and nearer the end of all things in life and fortune, than\r\nwhen Lord L'Estrange had thrust the pocket-book into his hands. But\r\nstill the servant showed knowledge of the world in calling him\r\ngentleman; there was no other word to apply to him.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" began Colonel Pompley, recovering himself, and with great\r\nsolemnity, \"I did not expect this pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor visitor stared round him dizzily, and sank into a chair,\r\nbreathing hard. The Colonel looked as a man only looks upon a poor\r\nrelation, and buttoned up first one trowser-pocket and then the other.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were in Canada,\" said the Colonel at last.\r\n\r\nMr. Digby had now got breath to speak, and he said meekly, \"The climate\r\nwould have killed my child, and it is two years since I returned.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have found a very good place in England, to make it worth\r\nyour while to leave Canada.\"\r\n\r\n\"She could not have lived through another winter in Canada--the doctor\r\nsaid so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh,\" quoth the Colonel.\r\n\r\nMr. Digby drew a long breath. \"I would not come to you, Colonel Pompley,\r\nwhile you could think that I came as a beggar for myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel's brow relaxed. \"A very honorable sentiment, Mr. Digby.\"\r\n\r\n\"No: I have gone through a great deal; but you see, Colonel,\" added the\r\npoor relation, with a faint smile, \"the campaign is wellnigh over, and\r\npeace is at hand.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel seemed touched.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk so, Digby--I don't like it. You are younger than I\r\nam--nothing more disagreeable than these gloomy views of things. You\r\nhave got enough to live upon, you say--at least so I understand you. I\r\nam very glad to hear it; and, indeed, I could not assist you, so many\r\nclaims on me. So it is all very well, Digby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Colonel Pompley,\" cried the soldier, clasping his hands, and with\r\nfeverish energy, \"I am a suppliant, not for myself, but my child! I have\r\nbut one--only one--a girl. She has been so good to me. She will cost you\r\nlittle. Take here when I die; promise her a shelter--a home. I ask no\r\nmore. You are my nearest relative. I have no other to look to. You have\r\nno children of your own. She will be a blessing to you, as she has been\r\nall upon earth to me!\"\r\n\r\nIf Colonel Pompley's face was red in ordinary hours, no epithet\r\nsufficiently rubicund or sanguineous can express its color at this\r\nappeal. \"The man's mad,\" he said at last, with a tone of astonishment\r\nthat almost concealed his wrath--\"stark mad! I take his child!--lodge\r\nand board a great, positive, hungry child! Why, sir, many and many a\r\ntime have I said to Mrs. Pompley, ''Tis a mercy we have no children. We\r\ncould never live in this style if we had children--never make both ends\r\nmeet.' Child--the most expensive, ravenous, ruinous thing in the\r\nworld--a child!\"\r\n\r\n\"She has been accustomed to starve,\" said Mr. Digby, plaintively. \"Oh,\r\nColonel, let me see your wife. _Her_ heart I can touch--she is a woman.\"\r\n\r\nUnlucky father! A more untoward, unseasonable request the Fates could\r\nnot have put into his lips.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pompley see the Digbies! Mrs. Pompley learn the condition of the\r\nColonel's grand connections! The Colonel would never have been his own\r\nman again. At the bare idea, he felt as if he could have sunk into the\r\nearth with shame. In his alarm he made a stride to the door, with the\r\nintention of locking it. Good heavens, if Mrs. Pompley should come in!\r\nAnd the man, too, had been announced by name. Mrs. Pompley might have\r\nlearned already that a Digby was with her husband--she might be actually\r\ndressing to receive him worthily--there was not a moment to lose.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel exploded. \"Sir, I wonder at your impudence. See Mrs.\r\nPompley! Hush, sir, hush!--hold your tongue. I have disowned your\r\nconnection. I will not have my wife--a woman, sir, of the first\r\nfamily--disgraced by it. Yes; you need not fire up. John Pompley is not\r\na man to be bullied in his own house. I say disgraced. Did not you run\r\ninto debt, and spend your fortune? Did not you marry a low creature--a\r\nvulgarian--a tradesman's daughter?--and your poor father such a\r\nrespectable man--a beneficed clergyman! Did not you sell your\r\ncommission! Heaven knows what became of the money! Did not you turn (I\r\nshudder to say it) a common stage-player, sir? And then, when you were\r\non your last legs, did I not give you L200 out of my own purse to go to\r\nCanada? And now here you are again--and ask me, with a coolness\r\nthat--that takes away my breath--takes away--my breath, sir--to provide\r\nfor the child you have thought proper to have;--a child whose\r\nconnections on the mother's side are of the most abject and\r\ndiscreditable condition. Leave my house, leave it--good heavens, sir,\r\nnot that way!--this.\" And the Colonel opened the glass door that led\r\ninto the garden. \"I will let you out this way. If Mrs. Pompley should\r\nsee you!\" And with that thought the Colonel absolutely hooked his arm\r\ninto his poor relation's, and hurried him into the garden.\r\n\r\nMr. Digby said not a word, but he struggled ineffectually to escape from\r\nthe Colonel's arm; and his color went and came, came and went, with a\r\nquickness that showed that in those shrunken veins there were still some\r\ndrops of a soldier's blood.\r\n\r\nBut the Colonel had now reached a little postern-door in the garden\r\nwall. He opened the latch, and thrust out his poor cousin. Then looking\r\ndown the lane, which was long, straight, and narrow, and seeing it was\r\nquite solitary, his eye fell upon the forlorn man, and remorse shot\r\nthrough his heart. For a moment the hardest of all kinds of avarice,\r\nthat of the _genteel_, relaxed its gripe. For a moment the most\r\nintolerant of all forms of pride, that which is based upon false\r\npretences, hushed its voice, and the Colonel hastily drew out his purse.\r\n\"There,\" said he--\"that is all I can do for you. Do leave the town as\r\nquick as you can, and don't mention your name to any one. Your father\r\nwas such a respectable man--beneficed clergyman!\"\r\n\r\n\"And paid for your commission, Mr. Pompley. My name!--I am not ashamed\r\nof it. But do not fear I shall claim your relationship. No; I am ashamed\r\nof _you_!\"\r\n\r\nThe poor cousin put aside the purse, still stretched towards him, with a\r\nscornful hand, and walked firmly down the lane.\r\n\r\nColonel Pompley stood irresolute. At that moment a window in his house\r\nwas thrown open. He heard the noise, turned round, and saw his wife\r\nlooking out.\r\n\r\nColonel Pompley sneaked back through the shrubbery, hiding himself\r\namongst the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\"Ill-luck is a _betise_,\" said the great Cardinal Richelieu; and on the\r\nlong run, I fear, his eminence was right. If you could drop Dick Avenel\r\nand Mr. Digby in the middle of Oxford-street--Dick in a fustian jacket,\r\nDigby in a suit of superfine--Dick with five shillings in his pocket,\r\nDigby with a thousand pounds--and if, at the end of ten years, you\r\nlooked up your two men, Dick would be on his road to a fortune,\r\nDigby--what we have seen him! Yet Digby had no vice; he did not drink,\r\nnor gamble. What was he, then? Helpless. He had been an only son--a\r\nspoiled child--brought up as a \"gentleman;\" that is, as a man who was\r\nnot expected to be able to turn his hand to any thing. He entered, as we\r\nhave seen, a very expensive regiment, wherein he found himself, at his\r\nfather's death, with L4000, and the incapacity to say \"No.\" Not\r\nnaturally extravagant, but without an idea of the value of money--the\r\neasiest, gentlest, best-tempered man whom example ever led astray. This\r\npart of his career comprised a very common history--the poor man living\r\non equal terms with the rich. Debt; recourse to usurers; bills signed\r\nsometimes for others, renewed at twenty per cent.; the L4000 melted like\r\nsnow; pathetic appeal to relations; relations have children of their\r\nown; small help given grudgingly, eked out by much advice, and coupled\r\nwith conditions. Amongst the conditions there was a very proper and\r\nprudent one--exchange into a less expensive regiment. Exchange effected;\r\npeace; obscure country quarters; _ennui_, flute-playing, and idleness.\r\nMr. Digby had no resources on a rainy day--except flute-playing; pretty\r\ngirl of inferior rank; all the officers after her; Digby smitten; pretty\r\ngirl very virtuous; Digby forms honorable intentions; excellent\r\nsentiments; imprudent marriage. Digby falls in life; colonel's lady will\r\nnot associate with Mrs. Digby; Digby cut by his whole kith and kin; many\r\ndisagreeable circumstances in regimental life; Digby sells out; love in\r\na cottage; execution in ditto. Digby had been much applauded as an\r\namateur actor; thinks of the stage; genteel comedy--a gentlemanlike\r\nprofession. Tries in a provincial town, under another name; unhappily\r\nsucceeds; life of an actor; hand-to-mouth life; illness; chest affected;\r\nDigby's voice becomes hoarse and feeble; not aware of it; attributes\r\nfailing success to ignorant provincial public; appears in London; is\r\nhissed; returns to provinces; sinks into very small parts; prison;\r\ndespair; wife dies; appeal again to relations; a subscription\r\nmade to get rid of him; send him out of the country; place in\r\nCanada--superintendent to an estate, L150 a-year; pursued by ill-luck;\r\nnever before fit for business, not fit now; honest as the day, but keeps\r\nslovenly accounts; child cannot bear the winter of Canada; Digby wrapped\r\nup in the child; return home; mysterious life for two years; child\r\npatient, thoughtful, loving; has learned to work; manages for father;\r\noften supports him; constitution rapidly breaking; thought of what will\r\nbecome of this child--worst disease of all. Poor Digby!--Never did a\r\nbase, cruel, unkind thing in his life; and here he is, walking down the\r\nlane from Colonel Pompley's house! Now, if Digby had but learned a\r\nlittle of the world's cunning, I think he would have succeeded even with\r\nColonel Pompley. Had he spent the L100 received from Lord l'Estrange\r\nwith a view to effect--had he bestowed a fitting wardrobe on himself and\r\nhis pretty Helen; had he stopped at the last stage, taken thence a smart\r\nchaise and pair, and presented himself at Colonel Pompley's in a way\r\nthat would not have discredited the Colonel's connection, and then,\r\ninstead of praying for home and shelter, asked the Colonel to become\r\nguardian to his child in case of his death, I have a strong notion that\r\nthe Colonel, in spite of his avarice, would have stretched both ends so\r\nas to take in Helen Digby. But our poor friend had no such arts. Indeed,\r\nof the L100 he had already very little left, for before leaving\r\ntown he had committed what Sheridan considered the extreme of\r\nextravagance--frittered away his money in paying his debts; and as for\r\ndressing up Helen and himself--if that thought had ever occurred to him,\r\nhe would have rejected it as foolish. He would have thought that the\r\nmore he showed his poverty, the more he would be pitied--the worst\r\nmistake a poor cousin can commit. According to Theophrastus, the\r\npartridge of Paphlagonia has two hearts; so have most men: it is the\r\ncommon mistake of the unlucky to knock at the wrong one.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMr. Digby entered the room of the inn in which he had left Helen. She\r\nwas seated by the window, and looking out wistfully on the narrow\r\nstreet, perhaps at the children at play. There had never been a playtime\r\nfor Helen Digby. She sprang forward as her father came in. His coming\r\nwas her holiday.\r\n\r\n\"We must go back to London,\" said Mr. Digby, sinking helplessly on the\r\nchair. Then with his sort of sickly smile--for he was bland even to his\r\nchild--\"Will you kindly inquire when the first coach leaves?\"\r\n\r\nAll the active cares of their careful life devolved upon that quiet\r\nchild. She kissed her father, placed before him a cough mixture which he\r\nhad brought from London, and went out silently to make the necessary\r\ninquiries, and prepare for the journey back.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock the father and child were seated in the night-coach,\r\nwith one other passenger--a man muffled up to the chin. After the first\r\nmile, the man let down one of the windows. Though it was summer, the air\r\nwas chill and raw. Digby shivered and coughed.\r\n\r\nHelen placed her hand on the window, and, leaning towards the passenger,\r\nwhispered softly.\r\n\r\n\"Eh!\" said the passenger, \"draw up the windows? You have got your own\r\nwindow; this is mine. Oxygen, young lady,\" he added solemnly, \"oxygen is\r\nthe breath of life. Cott, child!\" he continued, with suppressed choler,\r\nand a Welsh pronunciation, \"Cott! let us breathe and live.\"\r\n\r\nHelen was frightened, and recoiled.\r\n\r\nHer father, who had not heard, or had not heeded, this colloquy,\r\nretreated into the corner, put up the collar of his coat, and coughed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"It is cold, my dear,\" said he languidly to Helen.\r\n\r\nThe passenger caught the word, and replied indignantly, but as if\r\nsoliloquizing--\r\n\r\n\"Cold--ugh! I do believe the English are the stuffiest people! Look at\r\ntheir four-post beds?--all the curtains drawn, shutters closed, board\r\nbefore the chimney--not a house with a ventilator! Cold--ugh!\"\r\n\r\nThe window next Mr. Digby did not fit well into its frame.\r\n\r\n\"There is a sad draught,\" said the invalid.\r\n\r\nHelen instantly occupied herself in stopping up the chinks of the window\r\nwith her handkerchief. Mr. Digby glanced ruefully at the other window.\r\nThe look, which was very eloquent, aroused yet more the traveller's\r\nspleen.\r\n\r\n\"Pleasant!\" said he. \"Cott! I suppose you will ask me to go outside\r\nnext! But people who travel in a coach should know the law of a coach. I\r\ndon't interfere with your window; you have no business to interfere with\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I did not speak,\" said Mr. Digby meekly.\r\n\r\n\"But Miss here did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir!\" said Helen plaintively, \"if you knew how papa suffers!\" And\r\nher hand again moved towards the obnoxious window.\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear: the gentleman is in his right,\" said Mr. Digby; and,\r\nbowing with his wonted suavity, he added, \"Excuse her, sir. She thinks a\r\ngreat deal too much of me.\"\r\n\r\nThe passenger said nothing, and Helen nestled closer to her father, and\r\nstrove to screen him from the air.\r\n\r\nThe passenger moved uneasily. \"Well,\" said he, with a sort of snort,\r\n\"air is air, and right is right: but here goes\"--and he hastily drew up\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nHelen turned her face full towards the passenger with a grateful\r\nexpression, visible even in the dim light.\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind, sir,\" said poor Mr. Digby; \"I am ashamed to\"--his\r\ncough choked the rest of the sentence.\r\n\r\nThe passenger, who was a plethoric, sanguineous man, felt as if he were\r\nstifling. But he took off his wrappers, and resigned the oxygen like a\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nPresently he drew nearer to the sufferer, and laid hand on his wrist.\r\n\r\n\"You are feverish, I fear. I am a medical man. St!--one--two. Cott! you\r\nshould not travel; you are not fit for it!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Digby shook his head; he was too feeble to reply.\r\n\r\nThe passenger thrust his hand into his coat-pocket, and drew out what\r\nseemed a cigar-case, but what, in fact, was a leathern repertory,\r\ncontaining a variety of minute phials. From one of these phials he\r\nextracted two tiny globules. \"There,\" said he; \"open your mouth--put\r\nthose on the tip of your tongue. They will lower the pulse--check the\r\nfever. Be better presently--but should not travel--want rest--you should\r\nbe in bed. Aconite!--Henbane!--hum! Your papa is of fair complexion--a\r\ntimid character, I should say--a horror of work, perhaps. Eh, child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" faltered Helen, astonished and alarmed--Was the man a conjuror?\r\n\r\n\"A case for _phosphor_!\" cried the passenger; \"that fool Browne would\r\nhave said _arsenic_. Don't be persuaded to take arsenic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arsenic, sir!\" echoed the mild Digby. \"No; however unfortunate a man\r\nmay be, I think, sir, that suicide is--tempting, perhaps, but highly\r\ncriminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suicide,\" said the passenger tranquilly--\"suicide is my hobby! You have\r\nno symptom of that kind, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens! No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"If ever you feel violently impelled to drown yourself, take\r\n_pulsatilla_. But if you feel a preference towards blowing out your\r\nbrains, accompanied with weight in the limbs, loss of appetite, dry\r\ncough, and bad corns--_sulphuret of antimony_. Don't forget.\"\r\n\r\nThough poor Mr. Digby confusedly thought that the gentleman was out of\r\nhis mind, yet he tried politely to say \"that he was much obliged, and\r\nwould be sure to remember;\" but his tongue failed him, and his own ideas\r\ngrew perplexed. His head fell back heavily, and he sank into a silence\r\nwhich seemed that of sleep.\r\n\r\nThe traveller looked hard at Helen, as she gently drew her father's head\r\non her shoulder, and there pillowed it with a tenderness which was more\r\nthat of mother than child.\r\n\r\n\"Moral affections--soft--compassionate!--a good child and would go well\r\nwith--_pulsatilla_.\"\r\n\r\nHelen held up her finger, and glanced from her father to the traveller,\r\nand then to her father again.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--_pulsatilla_!\" muttered the homoeopathist: and, esconcing\r\nhimself in his own corner, he also sought to sleep. But, after vain\r\nefforts, accompanied by restless gestures and movements, he suddenly\r\nstarted up, and again extracted his phial-book.\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce are they to me!\" he muttered; \"morbid sensibility of\r\ncharacter--_coffee_? No!--accompanied by vivacity and violence--_Nux_!\"\r\nHe brought his book to the window, contrived to read the label on a\r\npigmy bottle. \"_Nux!_ that's it,\" he said--and he swallowed a globule!\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" quoth he, after a pause, \"I don't care a straw for the\r\nmisfortunes of other people--nay, I have half a mind to let down the\r\nwindow.\"\r\n\r\nHelen looked up.\r\n\r\n\"But I won't,\" he added resolutely; and this time he fell fairly asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nThe coach stopped at eleven o'clock, to allow the passengers to sup. The\r\nhomoeopathist woke up, got out, gave himself a shake, and inhaled the\r\nfresh air into his vigorous lungs with an evident sensation of delight.\r\nHe then turned and looked into the coach.\r\n\r\n\"Let your father get out, my dear,\" said he, with a tone more gentle\r\nthan usual. \"I should like to see him in-doors--perhaps I can do him\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nBut what was Helen's terror when she found that her father did not stir.\r\nHe was in a deep swoon, and still quite insensible when they lifted him\r\nfrom the carriage. When he recovered his senses, his cough returned, and\r\nthe effort brought up blood.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for him to proceed farther. The homoeopathist\r\nassisted to undress and put him into bed. And having administered\r\nanother of his mysterious globules, he inquired of the landlady how far\r\nit was to the nearest doctor--for the inn stood by itself in a small\r\nhamlet. There was the parish apothecary three miles off. But on hearing\r\nthat the gentlefolks employed Dr. Dosewell, and it was a good seven\r\nmiles to his house, the homoeopathist fetched a deep breath. The coach\r\nonly stopped a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n\"Cott!\" said he angrily to himself--\"the _nux_ was a failure. My\r\nsensibility is chronic. I must go through a long course to get rid of\r\nit. Hallo, guard! get out my carpet-bag. I shan't go on to-night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the good man, after a very slight supper, went up stairs again to\r\nthe sufferer.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I send for Dr. Dosewell, sir?\" asked the landlady, stopping him\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hum! At what hour to-morrow does the next coach to London pass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not before eight, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, send for the doctor to be here at seven. That leaves us at least\r\nsome hours free from allopathy and murder,\" grunted the disciple of\r\nHahnemann, as he entered the room.\r\n\r\nWhether it was the globule that the homoeopathist had administered, or\r\nthe effect of nature, aided by repose, that checked the effusion of\r\nblood, and restored some temporary strength to the poor sufferer, is\r\nmore than it becomes one not of the Faculty to opine. But certainly Mr.\r\nDigby seemed better, and he gradually fell into a profound sleep, but\r\nnot till the doctor had put his ear to his chest, tapped it with his\r\nhand, and asked several questions; after which the homoeopathist\r\nretired into a corner of the room, and, leaning his face on his hand,\r\nseemed to meditate. From his thoughts he was disturbed by a gentle\r\ntouch. Helen was kneeling at his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Is he very ill--very?\" said she; and her fond wistful eyes were fixed\r\non the physician's with all the earnestness of despair.\r\n\r\n\"Your father _is_ very ill,\" replied the doctor after a short pause. \"He\r\ncannot move hence for some days at least. I am going to London--shall I\r\ncall on your relations, and tell some of them to join you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, sir,\" answered Helen, coloring. \"But do not fear; I can\r\nnurse papa. I think he has been worse before--that is, he has complained\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nThe homoeopathist rose and took two strides across the room, then he\r\npaused by the bed, and listened to the breathing of the sleeping man.\r\n\r\nHe stole back to the child, who was still kneeling, took her in his arms\r\nand kissed her. \"Tamm it,\" said he angrily, and putting her down, \"go to\r\nbed now--you are not wanted any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir,\" said Helen, \"I cannot leave him so. If he wakes he would\r\nmiss me.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor's hand trembled; he had recourse to his globules. \"Anxiety,\r\ngrief suppressed,\" muttered he. \"Don't you want to cry, my dear?\r\nCry--do!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" murmured Helen.\r\n\r\n\"_Pulsatilla!_\" said the doctor, almost with triumph. \"I said so from\r\nthe first. Open your mouth--here! Good night. My room is opposite--No.\r\n6; call me if he wakes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock Dr. Dosewell arrived, and was shown into the room of\r\nthe homoeopathist, who, already up and dressed, had visited his\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Morgan,\" said the homoeopathist; \"I am a physician. I\r\nleave in your hands a patient whom, I fear, neither I nor you can\r\nrestore. Come and look at him.\"\r\n\r\nThe two doctors went into the sick-room. Mr. Digby was very feeble, but\r\nhe had recovered his consciousness, and inclined his head courteously.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to cause so much trouble,\" said he. The homoeopathist drew\r\naway Helen; the allopathist seated himself by the bedside and put his\r\nquestions, felt the pulse, sounded the lungs, and looked at the tongue\r\nof the patient. Helen's eye was fixed on the strange doctor, and her\r\ncolor rose, and her eye sparkled when he got up cheerfully, and said in\r\na pleasant voice. \"You may have a little tea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea!\" growled the homoeopathist--\"barbarian!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is better, then, sir?\" said Helen, creeping to the allopathist.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, my dear--certainly; and we shall do very well, I hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe two doctors then withdrew.\r\n\r\n\"Last about a week!\" said Dr. Dosewell, smiling pleasantly, and showing\r\na very white set of teeth.\r\n\r\n\"I should have said a month; but our systems are different,\" replied Dr.\r\nMorgan, drily.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (courteously).--\"We country doctors bow to our\r\nmetropolitan superiors; what would you advise? You would venture,\r\nperhaps, the experiment of bleeding.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan_, (spluttering and growing Welsh, which he never did but in\r\nexcitement). \"Pleed! Cott in heaven! do you think I am a butcher--an\r\nexecutioner? Pleed! Never.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell._--\"I don't find it answer, myself, when both lungs are\r\ngone! But perhaps you are for inhaling.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"Fiddledee!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (with some displeasure).--\"What would you advise, then,\r\nin order to prolong our patient's life for a month?\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"Stop the haemoptysis--give him _rhus_!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell._--\"Rhus, sir! _Rhus!_ I don't know that medicine.\r\n_Rhus!_\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"_Rhus toxicodendron._\"\r\n\r\nThe length of the last word excited Dr. Dosewell's respect. A word of\r\nfive syllables--this was something like! He bowed deferentially, but\r\nstill looked puzzled. At last he said, smiling frankly, \"You great\r\nLondon practitioners have so many new medicines; may I ask what Rhus\r\ntoxico--toxico--\r\n\r\n\"Dendron.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is?\"\r\n\r\n\"The juice of the Upas--vulgarly called the Poison-Tree.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Dosewell started.\r\n\r\n\"Upas--poison-tree--little birds that come under the shade fall down\r\ndead! You give upas juice in haemoptysis--what's the dose?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Morgan grinned maliciously, and produced a globule the size of a\r\nsmall pin's head.\r\n\r\nDr. Dosewell recoiled in disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said he very coldly, and assuming at once an air of superb\r\nsuperiority, \"I see--a homoeopathist, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"A homoeopathist!\"\r\n\r\n\"Um!\"\r\n\r\n\"Um!\"\r\n\r\n\"A strange system, Dr. Morgan,\" said Dr. Dosewell, recovering his\r\ncheerful smile, but with a curl of contempt in it, \"and would soon do\r\nfor the druggists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Serve 'em right. The druggists soon do for the patients.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (with dignity.)--\"You don't know, perhaps, Dr. Morgan,\r\nthat I am an apothecary as well as a surgeon. In fact,\" he added, with a\r\ncertain grand humility, \"I have not yet taken a diploma, and am but\r\nDoctor by courtesy.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"All one, sir! Doctor signs the death-warrant--'pothecary\r\ndoes the deed!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (with a withering sneer.)--\"Certainly we don't profess\r\nto keep a dying man alive upon the juice of the deadly upas-tree.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan_, (complacently.)--\"Of course you don't. There are no\r\npoisons with us. That's just the difference between you and me, Dr.\r\nDosewell!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (pointing to the homoeopathist's travelling\r\npharmacopoeia, and with affected candor.)--\"Indeed, I have always said\r\nthat if you can do no good, you can do no harm, with your\r\ninfinitesimals.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Morgan, who had been obtuse to the insinuation of poisoning, fires\r\nup violently at the charge of doing no harm.\r\n\r\n\"You know nothing about it! I could kill quite as many people as you, if\r\nI chose it; but I don't choose.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (shrugging up his shoulders.)--\"Sir! 'tis no use\r\narguing; the thing's against common sense. In short, it is my firm\r\nbelief that it is--is a complete--\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"A complete what?\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (provoked to the utmost.)--\"Humbug!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"Humbug! Cott in heaven! You old--\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell._--\"Old what, sir?\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan_, (at home in a series of alliteral vowels, which none but a\r\nCymbrian could have uttered without gasping.)--\"Old allopathical\r\nanthropophagite!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (starting up, seizing by the back the chair on which he\r\nhad sate, and bringing it down violently on its four legs)--\"Sir!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan_, (imitating the action with his own chair.)--\"Sir!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell._--\"You're abusive.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"You're impertinent.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell._--\"Sir!\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"Sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe two rivals fronted each other.\r\n\r\nThey were both athletic men, and fiery men. Dr. Dosewell was the taller,\r\nbut Dr. Morgan was the stouter. Dr. Dosewell on the mother's side was\r\nIrish; but Dr. Morgan on both sides was Welsh. All things considered, I\r\nwould have backed Dr. Morgan if it had come to blows. But, luckily for\r\nthe honor of science, here the chambermaid knocked at the door, and\r\nsaid, \"The coach is coming, sir.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Morgan recovered his temper and his manners at that announcement.\r\n\"Dr. Dosewell,\" said he, \"I have been too hot--I apologize.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Morgan,\" answered the allopathist, \"I forgot myself. Your hand,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"We are both devoted to humanity, though with different\r\nopinions. We should respect each other.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell._--\"Where look for liberality, if men of science are\r\nilliberal to their brethren?\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan_, (aside.)--\"The old hypocrite! He would pound me in a\r\nmortar if the law would let him.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (aside.)--\"The wretched charlatan! I should like to\r\npound him in a mortar.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan._--\"Good-bye, my esteemed and worthy brother.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell._--\"My excellent friend, good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n_Dr. Morgan_, (returning in haste.)--\"I forgot. I don't think our poor\r\npatient is very rich. I confide him to your disinterested\r\nbenevolence.\"--(Hurries away.)\r\n\r\n_Dr. Dosewell_, (in a rage.)--\"Seven miles at six o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and perhaps done out of my fee! Quack! Villain!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Dr. Morgan had returned to the sick-room.\r\n\r\n\"I must wish you farewell,\" said he to poor Mr. Digby, who was languidly\r\nsipping his tea, \"But you are in the hands of a--of a--gentleman in the\r\nprofession.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been too kind--I am shocked,\" said Mr. Digby. \"Helen, where's\r\nmy purse?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Morgan paused.\r\n\r\nHe paused, first, because it must be owned that his practice was\r\nrestricted, and a fee gratified the vanity natural to unappreciated\r\ntalent, and had the charm of novelty which is sweet to human nature\r\nitself. Secondly, he was a man\r\n\r\n    \"Who knew his rights, and, knowing, dared maintain.\"\r\n\r\nHe had resigned a coach fare--slaved a night--and thought he had\r\nrelieved his patient. He had a right to his fee.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand he paused, because, though he had small practice, he\r\nwas tolerably well off, and did not care for money itself, and he\r\nsuspected his patient to be no Cresus.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the purse was in Helen's hand. He took it from her, and saw\r\nbut a few sovereigns within the well-worn network. He drew the child a\r\nlittle aside.\r\n\r\n\"Answer me, my dear, frankly--is your papa rich?\" And he glanced at the\r\nshabby clothes strewed on the chair, and Helen's faded frock.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, no!\" said Helen, hanging her head.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all you have?\"\r\n\r\n\"All.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ashamed to offer you two guineas,\" said Mr. Digby's hollow voice\r\nfrom the bed.\r\n\r\n\"And I should be still more ashamed to take them. Good-bye, sir. Come\r\nhere, my child. Keep your money, and don't waste it on the other doctor\r\nmore than you can help. His medicines can do your father no good. But I\r\nsuppose you must have some. He's no physician, therefore there's no fee.\r\nHe'll send a bill--it can't be much. You understand. And now, God bless\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Morgan was off. But as he paid the landlady his bill, he said\r\nconsiderately, \"The poor people up stairs can pay you, but not that\r\ndoctor--and he's of no use. Be kind to the little girl, and get the\r\ndoctor to tell his patient (quietly, of course) to write to his\r\nfriends--soon--you understand. Somebody must take charge of the poor\r\nchild. And stop--hold your hand; take care--these globules for the\r\nlittle girl when her father dies--(here the Doctor muttered to himself,\r\n'grief;--_aconite_')--and if she cries too much afterwards--these (don't\r\nmistake.) Tears:--_caustic_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, sir,\" cried the coachman.\r\n\r\n\"Coming;--tears--_caustic_,\" repeated the homoeopathist, pulling out\r\nhis handkerchief and his phial-book together as he got into the coach;\r\nand he hastily swallowed his anti-lachrymal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nRichard Avenal was in a state of great nervous excitement. He proposed\r\nto give an entertainment of a kind wholly new to the experience of\r\nScrewstown. Mrs. M'Catchley had described with much eloquence the\r\n_Dejeunes dansants_ of her fashionable friends residing in the elegant\r\nsuburbs of Wimbledon and Fulham. She declared that nothing was so\r\nagreeable. She had even said point-blank to Mr. Avenel, \"Why don't you\r\ngive a _Dejeune dansant_?\" And, therewith, a _Dejeune dansant_ Mr.\r\nAvenel resolved to give.\r\n\r\nThe day was fixed, and Mr. Avenel entered into all the requisite\r\npreparations with the energy of a man and the providence of a woman.\r\n\r\nOne morning as he stood musing on the lawn, irresolute as to the best\r\nsite for the tents, Leonard came up to him with an open letter in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"My dear uncle,\" said he, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed Mr. Avenel, with a start. \"Ha--well--what now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just received a letter from Mr. Dale. He tells me that my poor\r\nmother is very restless and uneasy, because he cannot assure her that he\r\nhas heard from me; and his letter requires an answer. Indeed, I shall\r\nseem very ungrateful to him--to all--if I do not write.\"\r\n\r\nRichard Avenel's brows met. He uttered an impatient \"pish!\" and turned\r\naway. Then coming back, he fixed his clear hawk-like eye on Leonard's\r\ningenuous countenance, linked his arm in his nephew's, and drew him into\r\nthe shrubbery.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Leonard,\" said he, after a pause, \"it is time that I should give\r\nyou some idea of my plans with regard to you. You have seen my manner of\r\nliving--some difference from what you ever saw before, I calculate. Now\r\nI have given you, what no one gave me, a lift in the world; and where I\r\nplace you, there you must help yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such is my duty and my desire,\" said Leonard, heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Good. You are a clever lad, and a genteel lad, and will do me credit. I\r\nhave had doubts of what is best for you. At one time I thought of\r\nsending you to college. That, I know, is Mr. Dale's wish; perhaps it is\r\nyour own. But I have given up that idea; I have something better for\r\nyou. You have a clear head for business, and are a capital\r\narithmetician. I think of bringing you up to superintend my business:\r\nby-and-by I will admit you into partnership; and before you are thirty\r\nyou will be a rich man. Come, does that suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear uncle,\" said Leonard frankly, but much touched by this\r\ngenerosity, \"it is not for me to have a choice. I should have preferred\r\ngoing to college, because there I might gain independence for myself,\r\nand cease to be a burden on you. Moreover, my heart moves me to studies\r\nmore congenial with the college than the counting-house. But all this is\r\nnothing compared with my wish to be of use to you, and to prove in any\r\nway, however feebly, my gratitude for all your kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a good, grateful, sensible lad,\" exclaimed Richard heartily;\r\n\"and believe me, though I'm a rough diamond, I have your true interest\r\nat heart. You _can_ be of use to me, and in being so you will best serve\r\nyourself. To tell you the truth, I have some idea of changing my\r\ncondition. There's a lady of fashion and quality who, I think, may\r\ncondescend to become Mrs. Avenel; and if so, I shall probably reside a\r\ngreat part of the year in London. I don't want to give up my business.\r\nNo other investment will yield the same interest. But you can soon learn\r\nto superintend it for me, as some day or other I may retire, and then\r\nyou can step in. Once a member of our great commercial class, and with\r\nyour talents, you may be any thing--member of parliament, and after\r\nthat, minister of state, for what I know. And my wife--hem!--that is to\r\nbe--has great connections, and you shall marry well; and--oh, the\r\nAvenels will hold their heads with the highest, after all! Damn the\r\naristocracy--we clever fellows will be the aristocrats--eh!\" Richard\r\nrubbed his hands.\r\n\r\nCertainly, as we have seen, Leonard, especially in his earlier steps to\r\nknowledge, had repined at his position in the many degrees of\r\nlife--certainly he was still ambitious--certainly he could not now have\r\nreturned contentedly to the humble occupation he had left; and woe to\r\nthe young man who does not hear with a quickened pulse, and brightening\r\neye, words that promise independence, and flatter with a hope of\r\ndistinction. Still, it was with all the reaction of chill and mournful\r\ndisappointment that Leonard, a few hours after this dialogue with his\r\nuncle, found himself alone in the fields, and pondering over the\r\nprospects before him. He had set his heart upon completing his\r\nintellectual education, upon developing those powers within him which\r\nyearned for an arena of literature, and revolted from the routine of\r\ntrade. But to his credit be it said that he vigorously resisted this\r\nnatural disappointment, and by degrees schooled himself to look\r\ncheerfully on the path imposed on his duty, and sanctioned by the manly\r\nsense that was at the core of his character.\r\n\r\nI believe that this self-conquest showed that the boy had true genius.\r\nThe false genius would have written sonnets and despaired.\r\n\r\nBut still Richard Avenel left his nephew sadly perplexed as to the\r\nknotty question from which their talk on the future had diverged--viz.\r\nshould he write to the parson; and assure the fears of his mother? How\r\ndo so without Richard's consent, when Richard had on a former occasion\r\nso imperiously declared that, if he did, it would lose his mother all\r\nthat Richard intended to settle on her. While he was debating this\r\nmatter with his conscience, leaning against a stile that interrupted a\r\npath to the town, Leonard Fairfield was startled by an exclamation. He\r\nlooked up, and beheld Mr. Sprott the tinker.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nThe tinker, blacker and grimmer than ever, stared hard at the altered\r\nperson of his old acquaintance, and extended his sable fingers, as if\r\ninclined to convince himself by the sense of touch, that it was Leonard\r\nin the flesh that he beheld, under vestments so marvellously elegant and\r\npreternaturally spruce.\r\n\r\nLeonard shrank mechanically from the contact, while in great surprise he\r\nfaltered--\r\n\r\n\"You here, Mr. Sprott! What could bring you so far from home?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Ome!\" echoed the tinker, \"I 'as no 'ome! or rayther, d'ye see, Muster\r\nFairfilt, I makes myself at 'ome verever I goes! Lor' love ye I ben't\r\nsettled in no parridge. I vanders here and vanders there, and that's my\r\n'ome verever I can mend my kettles, and sell my tracks!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the tinker slid his panniers on the ground, gave a grunt of\r\nrelease and satisfaction, and seated himself with great composure on the\r\nstile, from which Leonard had retreated.\r\n\r\n\"But, dash my vig,\" resumed Mr. Sprott, as he once more surveyed\r\nLeonard, \"vy, you bees a rale gentleman now, sure_ly_. Vot's the\r\ndodge--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dodge!\" repeated Leonard mechanically--\"I don't understand you.\" Then,\r\nthinking that it was neither necessary nor expedient to keep up his\r\nacquaintance with Mr. Sprott, nor prudent to expose himself to the\r\nbattery of questions which he foresaw that further parley would bring\r\nupon him, he extended a crown-piece to the tinker; and saying with a\r\nhalf smile, \"You must excuse me for leaving you--I have business in the\r\ntown; and do me the favor to accept this trifle,\" he walked briskly off.\r\n\r\nThe tinker looked long at the crown-piece, and sliding it into his\r\npocket, said to himself--\r\n\r\n\"Ho--'ush-money! No go, my swell cove.\"\r\n\r\nAfter venting that brief soliloquy he sat silent a little while, till\r\nLeonard was nearly out of sight, then rose, resumed his fardle, and\r\ncreeping quick along the hedgerows, followed Leonard towards the town.\r\nJust in the last field, as he looked over the hedge, he saw Leonard\r\naccosted by a gentleman of comely mien and important swagger. That\r\ngentleman soon left the young man, and came, whistling loud, up the\r\npath, and straight towards the tinker. Mr. Sprott looked round, but the\r\nhedge was too neat to allow of a hiding-place, so he put a bold front\r\non, and stepped forth like a man. But, alas for him! before he got into\r\nthe public path, the proprietor of the land, Mr. Richard Avenel, (for\r\nthe gentleman was no less a personage) had spied out the trespasser, and\r\ncalled to him with a \"Hillo, fellow,\" that spoke all the dignity of a\r\nman who owns acres, and all the wrath of a man who beholds those acres\r\nimpudently invaded.\r\n\r\nThe tinker stopped, and Mr. Avenel stalked up to him. \"What the devil\r\nare you doing on my property, lurking by my hedge? I suspect you are an\r\nincendiary!\"\r\n\r\n\"I be a tinker,\" quoth Mr. Sprott, not louting low, (for a sturdy\r\nrepublican was Mr. Sprott,) but like a lord of humankind,\r\n\r\n    \"Pride in his port, defiance in his eye.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Avenel's fingers itched to knock the tinker's villanous hat off his\r\nJacobinical head, but he repressed the undignified impulse by thrusting\r\nboth hands deep into his trowsers' pockets.\r\n\r\n\"A tinker?\" he cried--\"that's a vagrant; and I'm a magistrate, and I've\r\na great mind to send you to the treadmill--that I have. What do you do\r\nhere, I say? You have not answered my question?\"\r\n\r\n\"What does I do 'ere?\" said Mr. Sprott. \"Vy, you had better ax my\r\ncrakter of the young gent I saw you talking with just now; he knows me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What! my nephew know you?\"\r\n\r\n\"W--hew,\" whistled the tinker, \"your nephew is it, sir? I have a great\r\nrespek for your family. I have known Mrs. Fairfilt, the vasherwoman,\r\nthis many a year. I 'umbly ax your pardon.\" And he took off his hat this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. Avenel turned red and white in a breath. He growled out something\r\ninaudible, turned on his heel, and strode off. The tinker watched him as\r\nhe had watched Leonard, and then dogged the uncle as he had dogged the\r\nnephew. I don't presume to say that there was cause and effect in what\r\nhappened that night, but it was what is called \"a curious coincidence\"\r\nthat that night one of Richard Avenel's ricks was set on fire; and that\r\nthat day he called Mr. Sprott an incendiary. Mr. Sprott was a man of\r\nvery high spirit and did not forgive an insult easily. His nature was\r\ninflammatory, and so was that of the lucifers which he always carried\r\nabout him, with his tracts and glue-pots. The next morning there was an\r\ninquiry made for the tinker, but he had disappeared from the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate thing that the _dejeune dansant_ so absorbed Mr.\r\nRichard Avenel's thoughts, that even the conflagration of his rick could\r\nnot scare away the graceful and poetic images connected with that\r\npastoral festivity. He was even loose and careless in the questions he\r\nput to Leonard about the tinker; nor did he set justice in pursuit of\r\nthat itinerant trader; for, to say truth, Richard Avenel was a man\r\naccustomed to make enemies amongst the lower orders; and though he\r\nsuspected Mr. Sprott of destroying his rick, yet, when he once set about\r\nsuspecting, he found that he had quite as good cause to suspect fifty\r\nother persons. How on earth could a man puzzle himself about ricks and\r\ntinkers, when all his cares and energies were devoted to a _dejeune\r\ndansant_? It was a maxim of Richard Avenel's, as it ought to be of\r\nevery clever man, \"to do one thing at a time;\" and therefore he\r\npostponed all other considerations till the _dejeune dansant_ was fairly\r\ndone with. Amongst these considerations was the letter which Leonard\r\nwished to write to the parson. \"Wait a bit, and we will _both_ write!\"\r\nsaid Richard good-humoredly, \"the moment the _dejeune dansant_ is over!\"\r\n\r\nIt must be owned that this fete was no ordinary provincial ceremonial.\r\nRichard Avenel was a man to do a thing well when he set about it--\r\n\r\n    \"He soused the cabbage with a bounteous heart.\"\r\n\r\nBy little and little his first notions had expanded, till what had been\r\nmeant to be only neat and elegant now embraced the costly and\r\nmagnificent. Artificers accustomed to _dejeune dansants_ came all the\r\nway from London to assist, to direct, to create. Hungarian singers, and\r\nTyrolese singers, and Swiss peasant-women who were to chant the _Ranz\r\ndes Vaches_, and milk cows or make syllabubs, were engaged. The great\r\nmarquee was decorated as a Gothic banquet hall; the breakfast itself was\r\nto consist of \"all the delicacies of the season.\" In short, as Richard\r\nAvenel said to himself, \"It is a thing once in a way; a thing on which I\r\ndon't object to spend money, provided that the thing _is_--the thing!\"\r\n\r\nIt had been a matter of grave meditation how to make the society worthy\r\nof the revel; for Richard Avenel was not contented with the mere\r\naristocracy of the town--his ambition had grown with his expenses.\r\n\"Since it will cost so much,\" said he, \"I may as well come it strong,\r\nand get in the county.\"\r\n\r\nTrue, that he was personally acquainted with very few of what are called\r\ncounty families. But still, when a man makes himself of mark in a large\r\ntown, and can return one of the members whom that town sends to\r\nparliament; and when, moreover, that man proposes to give some superb\r\nand original entertainment, in which the old can eat and the young can\r\ndance, there is no county in the island that has not families enow who\r\nwill be delighted by an invitation from THAT MAN. And so Richard,\r\nfinding that, as the thing got talked of, the Dean's lady, and Mrs.\r\nPompley, and various other great personages, took the liberty to suggest\r\nthat Squire this, and Sir Somebody that, would be _so_ pleased if they\r\nwere asked, fairly took the bull by the horns, and sent out his cards to\r\nthe Park, Hall, and Rectory, within a circumference of twelve miles. He\r\nmet with but few refusals, and he now counted upon five hundred guests.\r\n\r\n\"In for a penny, in for a pound,\" said Mr. Richard Avenel. \"I wonder\r\nwhat Mrs. M'Catchley _will_ say?\" Indeed, if the whole truth must be\r\nknown, Mr. Richard Avenel not only gave that _dejeune dansant_ in honor\r\nof Mrs. M'Catchley, but he had fixed in his heart of hearts upon that\r\noccasion, (when surrounded by all his splendor, and assisted by the\r\nseductive arts of Terpsichore and Bacchus,) to whisper to Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley those soft words which--but why not here let Mr. Richard\r\nAvenel use his own idiomatic and unsophisticated expression? \"Please the\r\npigs, then,\" said Mr. Avenel to himself, \"I shall pop the question.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nThe Great Day arrived at last; and Mr. Richard Avenel, from his\r\ndressing-room window, looked on the scene below as Hannibal or Napoleon\r\nlooked from the Alps on Italy. It was a scene to gratify the thought of\r\nconquest, and reward the labors of ambition. Placed on a little eminence\r\nstood the singers from the mountains of the Tyrol, their high-crowned\r\nhats and filagree buttons and gay sashes gleaming in the sun. Just seen\r\nfrom his place of watch, though concealed from the casual eye, the\r\nHungarian musicians lay in ambush amidst a little belt of laurels and\r\nAmerican shrubs. Far to the right lay what had once been called\r\n(_horresco referens_) the duckpond, where--_Dulce sonant tenui gutture\r\ncarmen aves_. But the ruthless ingenuity of the head artificer had\r\nconverted the duckpond into a Swiss lake, despite grievous wrong and\r\nsorrow to the _assuetum innocuumque genus_--the familiar and harmless\r\nhabitants, who had been all expatriated and banished from their native\r\nwaves. Large poles twisted with fir branches, stuck thickly around the\r\nlake, gave to the waters the becoming Helvetian gloom. And here, beside\r\nthree cows all bedecked with ribbons, stood the Swiss maidens destined\r\nto startle the shades with the _Ranz des Vaches_. To the left, full upon\r\nthe sward, which it almost entirely covered, stretched the great Gothic\r\nmarquee, divided into two grand sections--one for the _dancing_, one for\r\nthe _dejeune_.\r\n\r\nThe day was propitious--not a cloud in the sky. The musicians were\r\nalready tuning their instruments; figures of waiters--hired of\r\nGunter--trim and decorous, in black trowsers and white waistcoats,\r\npassed to and fro the space between the house and the marquee. Richard\r\nlooked and looked; and as he looked he drew mechanically his razor\r\nacross the strop; and when he had looked his fill, he turned reluctantly\r\nto the glass and shaved! All that blessed morning he had been too busy,\r\ntill then, to think of shaving.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast deal of character in the way that a man performs that\r\noperation of shaving! You should have seen Richard Avenel shave! You\r\ncould have judged at once how he would shave his neighbors, when you saw\r\nthe celerity, the completeness with which he shaved himself--a\r\nforestroke and a backstroke, and _tondenti barba cadebat_! Cheek and\r\nchin were as smooth as glass. You would have buttoned up your pockets\r\ninstinctively if you had seen him. But the rest of Mr. Avenel's toilet\r\nwas not completed with correspondent dispatch. On his bed, and on his\r\nchairs, and on his sofa, and on his drawers, lay trowsers and vests, and\r\ncravats, enough to distract the choice of a Stoic. And first one pair of\r\ntrowsers was tried on, and then another--and one waistcoat, and then a\r\nsecond, and then a third. Gradually that _chef d'oeuvre_ of\r\ncivilization--a _man dressed_--grew into development and form; and,\r\nfinally. Mr. Richard Avenel emerged into the light of day. He had been\r\nlucky in his costume--he felt it. It might not suit every one in color\r\nor cut, but it suited him. And this was his garb. On such occasions,\r\nwhat epic poet would not describe the robe and tunic of a hero?\r\n\r\nHis surtout--in modern phrase, his frock-coat--was blue, a rich blue, a\r\nblue that the royal brothers of George the Fourth were wont to favor.\r\nAnd the surtout, single-breasted, was thrown open gallantly; and in the\r\nsecond button-hole thereof was a moss rose. The vest was white, and the\r\ntrowsers a pearl-gray, with what tailors style \"a handsome fall over the\r\nboot.\" A blue and white silk cravat, tied loose and debonair; an ample\r\nfield of shirt front, with plain gold studs; a pair of lemon-colored kid\r\ngloves, and a white hat, placed somewhat too knowingly on one side,\r\ncomplete the description, and \"give the world assurance of the man.\"\r\nAnd, with his light, firm, well-shaped figure, his clear complexion, his\r\nkeen bright eye, and features that bespoke the courage, precision, and\r\nalertness of his character--that is to say, features bold, not large,\r\nwell-defined and regular--you might walk long through town or country\r\nbefore you would see a handsomer specimen of humanity than our friend\r\nRichard Avenel.\r\n\r\nHandsome, and feeling that he was handsome; rich, and feeling that he\r\nwas rich; lord of the fete, and feeling that he was lord of the fete,\r\nRichard Avenel stepped out upon his lawn.\r\n\r\nAnd now the dust began to rise along the road, and carriages, and gigs,\r\nand chaises, and flies, might be seen at near intervals and in quick\r\nprocession. People came pretty much about the same time--as they do in\r\nthe country--heaven reward them for it!\r\n\r\nRichard Avenel was not quite at his ease at first in receiving his\r\nguests, especially those whom he did not know by sight. But when the\r\ndancing began, and he had secured the fair hand of Mrs. M'Catchley for\r\nthe initiatory quadrille, his courage and presence of mind returned to\r\nhim; and, seeing that many people whom he had not received at all seemed\r\nto enjoy themselves very much, he gave up the attempt to receive those\r\nwho came after,--and that was a great relief to all parties.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Leonard looked on the animated scene with a silent melancholy,\r\nwhich he in vain endeavored to shake off--a melancholy more common\r\namongst very young men in such scenes than we are apt to suppose.\r\nSomehow or other the pleasure was not congenial to him; he had no Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley to endear it--he knew very few people--he was shy--he felt\r\nhis position with his uncle was equivocal--he had not the habit of\r\nsociety--he heard incidentally many an ill-natured remark upon his uncle\r\nand the entertainment--he felt indignant and mortified. He had been a\r\ngreat deal happier eating his radishes, and reading his book, by the\r\nlittle fountain in Riccabocca's garden. He retired to a quiet part of\r\nthe grounds, seated himself under a tree, leant his cheek on his hand,\r\nand mused. He was soon far away;--happy age, when, whatever the present,\r\nthe future seems so fair and so infinite!\r\n\r\nBut now the _dejeune_ had succeeded the earlier dances; and, as\r\nchampagne flowed royally, it is astonishing how the entertainment\r\nbrightened.\r\n\r\nThe sun was beginning to slope towards the west, when, during a\r\ntemporary cessation of the dance, all the guests had assembled in such\r\nspace as the tent left on the lawn, or thickly filled the walks\r\nimmediately adjoining it. The gay dresses of the ladies, the joyous\r\nlaughter heard every where, and the brilliant sun light over all,\r\nconveyed even to Leonard the notion, not of mere hypocritical pleasure,\r\nbut actual healthful happiness. He was attracted from his reverie, and\r\ntimidly mingled with the groups. But Richard Avenel, with the fair Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley--her complexion more vivid, and her eyes more dazzling, and\r\nher step more elastic than usual, had turned from the gayety just as\r\nLeonard had turned towards it, and was now on the very spot (remote,\r\nobscure, shaded by the few trees above five years old Mr. Avenel's\r\nproperty boasted) which the dreamer had deserted.\r\n\r\nAnd then! Ah! then! moment so meet for the sweet question of questions,\r\nplace so appropriate for the delicate, bashful, murmured popping\r\nthereof!--suddenly from the sward before, from the groups beyond, there\r\nfloated to the ears of Richard Avenel an indescribable mingled ominous\r\nsound--a sound as of a general titter--a horrid, malignant, but low\r\ncachination. And Mrs. M'Catchley, stretching forth her parasol,\r\nexclaimed, \"Dear me, Mr. Avenel, what can they be all crowding there\r\nfor?\"\r\n\r\nThere are certain sounds and certain sights--the one indistinct, the\r\nother vaguely conjecturable--which, nevertheless, we know by an\r\ninstinct, bode some diabolical agency at work in our affairs. And if any\r\nman gives an entertainment, and hears afar a general ill-suppressed\r\nderisive titter, and sees all his guests hurrying towards one spot, I\r\ndefy him to remain unmoved and uninquisitive. I defy him still more to\r\ntake that precise occasion (however much he may have before designed it)\r\nto drop gracefully on his right knee before the handsomest Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley in the universe, and--pop the question! Richard Avenel\r\nblurted out something very like an oath; and, half guessing that\r\nsomething must have happened that it would not be pleasing to bring\r\nimmediately under the notice of Mrs. M'Catchley, he said, hastily,\r\n\"Excuse me! I'll just go and see what is the matter--pray, stay till I\r\ncome back.\" With that he sprang forth; in a minute he was in the midst\r\nof the group, that parted aside with the most obliging complacency to\r\nmake way for him.\r\n\r\n\"But what's the matter?\" he asked, impatiently, yet fearfully. Not a\r\nvoice answered. He strode on, and beheld his nephew in the arms of a\r\nwoman!\r\n\r\n\"God bless my soul!\" said Richard Avenel.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAnd such a woman!\r\n\r\nShe had on a cotton gown--very neat, I dare say--for an under housemaid:\r\nand _such_ thick shoes! She had on a little black straw bonnet; and a\r\nkerchief, that might have cost tenpence, pinned across her waist instead\r\nof a shawl; and she looked altogether--respectable, no doubt, but\r\nexceedingly dusty! And she was hanging upon Leonard's neck, and\r\nscolding, and caressing, and crying very loud. \"God bless my soul!\" said\r\nMr. Richard Avenel.\r\n\r\nAnd as he uttered that innocent self-benediction, the woman hastily\r\nturned round, and, darting from Leonard, threw herself right upon\r\nRichard Avenel--burying under her embrace blue-coat, moss-rose, white\r\nwaistcoat and all--with a vehement sob and a loud exclamation!\r\n\r\n\"Oh! brother Dick!--dear, dear brother Dick! and I lives to see thee\r\nagin!\" And then came two such kisses--you might have heard them a mile\r\noff! The situation of brother Dick was appalling! and the crowd, that\r\nhad before only tittered politely, could not now resist the effect of\r\nthis sudden embrace. There was a general explosion!--it was a roar! That\r\nroar would have killed a weak man; but it sounded to the strong heart of\r\nRichard Avenel like the defiance of a foe, and it plucked forth in an\r\ninstant from all conventional let and barrier the native spirit of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nHe lifted abruptly his handsome masculine head, looked round the ring of\r\nhis ill-bred visitors with a haughty stare of rebuke and surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" then said he, very coolly, \"I don't see what\r\nthere is to laugh at! A brother and sister meet after many years'\r\nseparation, and the sister cries, poor thing! For my part, I think it\r\nvery natural that _she_ should cry; but not that you should laugh!\" In\r\nan instant the whole shame was removed from Richard Avenel, and rested\r\nin full weight upon the bystanders. It is impossible to say how foolish\r\nand sheepish they all looked, nor how slinkingly each tried to creep\r\noff.\r\n\r\nRichard Avenel seized his advantage with the promptitude of a man who\r\nhad got on in America, and was therefore accustomed to make the best of\r\nthings. He drew Mrs. Fairfield's arm in his, and led her into the house;\r\nbut when he had got her safe into his parlor--Leonard following all the\r\ntime--and the door was closed upon those three, _then_ Richard Avenel's\r\nire burst forth.\r\n\r\n\"You impudent, ungrateful, audacious drab!\"\r\n\r\nYes, drab was the word. I am shocked to say it, but the duties of a\r\nhistorian are stern; and the word _was_ drab.\r\n\r\n\"Drab!\" faltered poor Jane Fairfield; and she clutched hold of Leonard\r\nto save herself from falling.\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" cried Leonard fiercely.\r\n\r\nYou might as well have cried \"sir\" to a torrent. Richard hurried on,\r\nfurious.\r\n\r\n\"You nasty, dirty, dusty dowdy! How dare you come here to disgrace me in\r\nmy own house and premises, after my sending you fifty pounds? To take\r\nthe very time, too, when--when\"--\r\n\r\nRichard gasped for breath; and the laugh of his guests rang in his ears,\r\nand got into his chest, and choked him. Jane Fairfield drew herself up,\r\nand her tears were dried.\r\n\r\n\"I did not come to disgrace you; I came to see my boy, and\"--\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" interrupted Richard, \"to see _him_.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to Leonard: \"You have written to this woman, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I have not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not lie; and he is as good as yourself, and better, Richard\r\nAvenel,\" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfield; \"and I won't stand here and hear him\r\ninsulted--that's what I won't. And as for your fifty pounds, there are\r\nforty-five of it; and I'll work my fingers to the bone till I pay back\r\nthe other five. And don't be afeared I shall disgrace you, for I'll\r\nnever look on your face agin; and you're a wicked bad man--that's what\r\nyou are.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman's voice was so raised and so shrill, that any other and\r\nmore remorseful feeling which Richard might have conceived, was drowned\r\nin his apprehension that she would be overheard by his servants--a\r\nmasculine apprehension, with which females rarely sympathize; which, on\r\nthe contrary, they are inclined to consider a mean and cowardly terror\r\non the part of their male oppressors.\r\n\r\n\"Hush! hold your infernal squall--do!\" said Mr. Avenel in a tone that he\r\nmeant to be soothing. \"There--sit down--and don't stir till I come back\r\nagain, and can talk to you calmly. Leonard, follow me, and help to\r\nexplain things to our guests.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood still, but shook his head slightly.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" said Richard Avenel, in a very portentous\r\ngrowl. \"Shaking your head at me? Do you intend to disobey me? You had\r\nbetter take care!\"\r\n\r\nLeonard's front rose; he drew one arm round his mother, and thus he\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you have been kind to me and generous, and that thought alone\r\nsilenced my indignation when I heard you address such language to my\r\nmother: for I felt that, if I spoke, I should say too much. Now I speak,\r\nand it is to say shortly that\"--\r\n\r\n\"Hush, boy,\" said poor Mrs. Fairfield frightened; \"don't mind me. I did\r\nnot come to make mischief, and ruin your prospex. I'll go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you ask her pardon, Mr. Avenel?\" said Leonard, firmly; and he\r\nadvanced towards his uncle.\r\n\r\nRichard, naturally hot and intolerant of contradiction, was then\r\nexcited, not only by the angry emotions which, it must be owned, a man\r\nso mortified, and in the very flush of triumph, might well experience,\r\nbut by much more wine than he was in the habit of drinking; and when\r\nLeonard approached him, he misinterpreted the movement into one of\r\nmenace and aggression. He lifted his arm: \"Come a step nearer,\" said he\r\nbetween his teeth, \"and I'll knock you down.\" Leonard advanced that\r\nforbidden step; but as Richard caught his eye, there was something in\r\nthat eye--not defying, not threatening, but bold and dauntless--which he\r\nrecognized and respected, for that something spoke the freeman. The\r\nuncle's arm mechanically fell to his side.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot strike me, Mr. Avenel,\" said Leonard, \"for you are aware\r\nthat I could not strike again my mother's brother. As her son, I once\r\nmore say to you,--ask her pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten thousand devils! Are you mad? or do you want to drive me mad? you\r\ninsolent beggar, fed and clothed by my charity. Ask her pardon!--what\r\nfor? That she has made me the object of jeer and ridicule with that\r\nd----d cotton gown, and those double-d----d thick shoes? I vow and\r\nprotest they've got nails in them! Hark ye, sir, I've been insulted by\r\nher, but I'm not to be bullied by you. Come with me instantly, or I\r\ndiscard you; not a shilling of mine shall you have as long as I live.\r\nTake your choice,--be a peasant, a laborer, or\"--\r\n\r\n\"A base renegade to natural affection, a degraded beggar indeed!\" cried\r\nLeonard, his breast heaving, and his cheeks in a glow. \"Mother, mother,\r\ncome away. Never fear,--I have strength and youth, and we will work\r\ntogether as before.\"\r\n\r\nBut poor Mrs. Fairfield, overcome by her excitement, had sunk down into\r\nRichard's own handsome morocco leather easy-chair, and could neither\r\nspeak nor stir.\r\n\r\n\"Confound you both!\" muttered Richard. \"You can't be seen creeping out\r\nof my house now. Keep her here, you young viper, you; keep her till I\r\ncome back; and then if you choose to go, go and be\"--\r\n\r\nNot finishing his sentence, Mr. Avenel hurried out of the room, and\r\nlocked the door, putting the key into his pocket. He paused for a moment\r\nin the hall, in order to collect his thoughts, drew three or four deep\r\nbreaths, gave himself a great shake, and, resolved to be faithful to his\r\nprinciple of doing one thing at a time, shook off in that shake all\r\ndisturbing recollection of his mutinous captives. Stern as Achilles when\r\nhe appeared to the Trojans, Richard Avenel stalked back to his lawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nBrief as had been his absence, the host could see that, in the interval,\r\na great and notable change had come over the spirit of his company. Some\r\nof those who lived in the town were evidently preparing to return home\r\non foot; those who lived at a distance, and whose carriages (having been\r\nsent away, and ordered to return at a fixed hour), had not yet arrived,\r\nwere gathered together in small knots and groups; all looked sullen and\r\ndispleased, and all instinctively turned from their host as he passed\r\nthem by. They felt they had been lectured, and they were more put out\r\nthan Richard himself. They did not know if they might not be lectured\r\nagain. This vulgar man, of what might he not be capable?\r\n\r\nRichard's shrewd sense comprehended in an instant all the difficulties\r\nof his position; but he walked on deliberately and directly towards Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley, who was standing near the grand marquee with the Pompleys\r\nand the Dean's lady. As these personages saw him make thus boldly\r\ntowards them, there was a flutter. \"Hang the fellow!\" said the Colonel,\r\nintrenching himself in his stock, \"he is coming here. Low and\r\nshocking,--what shall we do? Let us stroll on.\"\r\n\r\nBut Richard threw himself in the way of the retreat. \"Mrs. M'Catchley,\"\r\nsaid he very gravely, and offering her his arm, \"allow me three words\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor widow looked very much discomposed. Mrs. Pompley pulled her by\r\nthe sleeve. Richard still stood gazing into her face, with his arm\r\nextended. She hesitated a minute, and then took the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Monstrous impudent!\" cried the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Let Mrs. M'Catchley alone, my dear,\" responded Mrs. Pompley; \"_she_\r\nwill know how to give him a lesson!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Richard, as soon as he and his companion were out of\r\nhearing, \"I rely on you to do me a favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"On me?\"\r\n\r\n\"On you, and you alone. You have influence with all those people, and a\r\nword from you will effect what I desire. Mrs. M'Catchley,\" added\r\nRichard, with a solemnity that was actually imposing, \"I flatter myself\r\nthat you have some friendship for me, which is more than I can say of\r\nany other in these grounds--will you do me this favor, ay or no?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Mr. Avenel?\" asked Mrs. M'Catchley, much disturbed, and\r\nsomewhat softened--for she was by no means a woman without feeling;\r\nindeed, she considered herself nervous.\r\n\r\n\"Get all your friends--all the company in short--to come back into the\r\ntent for refreshments--for any thing. I want to say a few words to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless me! Mr. Avenel--a few words!\" cried the widow, \"but that's just\r\nwhat they are all afraid of! You must pardon me, but you really can't\r\nask people to a _dejeune dansant_, and then--scold 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to scold them,\" said Mr. Avenel, very seriously--\"upon my\r\nhonor, I'm not! I'm going to make all right, and I even hope afterwards\r\nthat the dancing may go on--and that you will honor me again with your\r\nhand. I leave you to your task; and, believe me, I'm not an ungrateful\r\nman,\" He spoke, and bowed--not without some dignity--and vanished within\r\nthe breakfast division of the marquee. There he busied himself in\r\nre-collecting the waiters, and directing them to rearrange the mangled\r\nremains of the table as they best could. Mrs. M'Catchley, whose\r\ncuriosity and interest were aroused, executed her commission with all\r\nthe ability and tact of a woman of the world, and in less than a quarter\r\nof an hour the marquee was filled--the corks flew--the champagne bounced\r\nand sparkled--people drank in silence, munched fruits and cakes, kept up\r\ntheir courage with the conscious sense of numbers, and felt a great\r\ndesire to know what was coming. Mr. Avenel, at the head of the table,\r\nsuddenly rose--\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" said he, \"I have taken the liberty to invite you\r\nonce more into this tent, in order to ask you to sympathize with me,\r\nupon an occasion which took us all a little by surprise to-day.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, you all know I am a new man--the maker of my own fortunes.\"\r\n\r\nA great many heads bowed involuntarily. The words were said manfully,\r\nand there was a general feeling of respect.\r\n\r\n\"Probably, too,\" resumed Mr. Avenel, \"you may know that I am the son of\r\nvery honest tradespeople. I say honest, and they are not ashamed of\r\nme--I say tradespeople, and I'm not ashamed of them. My sister married\r\nand settled at a distance. I took her son to educate and bring up. But I\r\ndid not tell her where he was, nor even that I had returned from\r\nAmerica--I wished to choose my own time for that, when I could give her\r\nthe surprise, not only of a rich brother, but of a son whom I intended\r\nto make a gentleman, so far as manners and education can make one. Well,\r\nthe poor dear woman has found me out sooner than I expected, and turned\r\nthe tables on me by giving me a surprise of her own invention. Pray,\r\nforgive the confusion this little family scene has created: and though I\r\nown it was very laughable at the moment, and I was wrong to say\r\notherwise, yet I am sure I don't judge ill of your good hearts when I\r\nask you to think what brother and sister must feel who parted from each\r\nother when they were boy and girl. To me (and Richard gave a great\r\ngulp--for he felt that a great gulp alone could swallow the abominable\r\nlie he was about to utter)--to me this has been _a very happy occasion_!\r\nI'm a plain man: no one can take ill what I've said. And, wishing that\r\nyou may be all as happy in your family as I am in mine--humble though it\r\nbe--I beg to drink your very good healths!\"\r\n\r\nThere was an universal applause when Richard sat down--and so well in\r\nhis plain way had he looked the thing, and done the thing, that at least\r\nhalf of those present--who till then had certainly disliked and half\r\ndespised him--suddenly felt that they were proud of his acquaintance.\r\nFor however aristocratic this country of ours may be, and however\r\nespecially aristocratic be the genteeler classes in provincial towns and\r\ncoteries--there is nothing which English folks, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, in their hearts so respect as a man who has risen from nothing,\r\nand owns it frankly! Sir Compton Delaval, an old baronet, with a\r\npedigree as long as a Welshman's, who had been reluctantly decoyed to\r\nthe feast by his three unmarried daughters--not one of whom, however,\r\nhad hitherto condescended even to bow to the host--now rose. It was his\r\nright: he was the first person there in rank and station.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" quoth Sir Compton Delaval, \"I am sure that I\r\nexpress the feelings of all present when I say that we have heard with\r\ngreat delight and admiration the words addressed to us by our excellent\r\nhost. (Applause.) And if any of us, in what Mr. Avenel describes justly\r\nas the surprise of the moment, were betrayed into an unseemly merriment\r\nat--at--(the Dean's lady whispered 'some of the')--some of the--some of\r\nthe\"--repeated Sir Compton, puzzled, and coming to a dead\r\nlock--('holiest sentiments,' whispered the Dean's lady)--\"ay, some of\r\nthe holiest sentiments in our nature--I beg him to accept our sincerest\r\napologies. I can only say, for my part, that I am proud to rank Mr.\r\nAvenel amongst the gentlemen of the county, (here Sir Compton gave a\r\nsounding thump on the table,) and to thank him for one of the most\r\nbrilliant entertainments it has ever been my lot to witness. If he won\r\nhis fortune honestly, he knows how to spend it nobly!\"\r\n\r\nWhiz went a fresh bottle of champagne.\r\n\r\n\"I am not accustomed to public speaking, but I could not repress my\r\nsentiments. And I've now only to propose to you the health of our host,\r\nRichard Avenel, Esquire; and to couple with that the health of his--very\r\ninteresting sister, and long life to them both!\"\r\n\r\nThe sentence was half drowned in enthusiastic plaudits, and in three\r\ncheers for Richard Avenel, Esquire, and his very interesting sister.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a cursed humbug,\" thought Richard Avenel, as he wiped his forehead;\r\n\"but the world _is_ such a humbug!\" Then he glanced towards Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley, and to his great satisfaction, saw Mrs. M'Catchley wiping\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nNow, though the fair widow might certainly have contemplated the\r\nprobability of accepting Mr. Avenel as a husband, she had never before\r\nfelt the least bit in love with him; and now she did. There is something\r\nin courage and candor--at a word, in manliness--that all women, the most\r\nworldly, do admire in men; and Richard Avenel, humbug though his\r\nconscience said he was, seemed to her like a hero.\r\n\r\nThe host saw his triumph, \"Now for another dance!\" said he gaily; and he\r\nwas about to offer his hand to Mrs. M'Catchley, when Sir Compton Delaval\r\nseizing it, and giving it a hearty shake, cried, \"You have not yet\r\ndanced with my eldest daughter; so, if you won't ask her, why, I must\r\noffer her to you as your partner. Here--Sarah.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah Delaval, who was five feet eight, and as stately as she was\r\ntall, bowed her head graciously; and Mr. Avenel, before he knew where he\r\nwas, found her leaning on his arm. But as he passed into the next\r\ndivision of the tent, he had to run the gauntlet of all the gentlemen,\r\nwho thronged round to shake hands with him. Their warm English hearts\r\ncould not be satisfied till they had so repaired the sin of their\r\nprevious haughtiness and mockery. Richard Avenel might then have safely\r\nintroduced his sister--gown, kerchief, thick shoes and all--to the\r\ncrowd; but he had no such thought. He thanked heaven devoutly that she\r\nwas safely under lock and key.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the third dance that he could secure Mrs. M'Catchley's\r\nhand, and then it was twilight. The carriages were at the door, but no\r\none yet thought of going. People were really enjoying themselves. Mr.\r\nAvenel had had time, in the interim, to mature all his plans for\r\ncompleting and consummating that triumph which his tact and pluck had\r\ndrawn from his momentary disgrace. Excited as he was with wine and\r\nsuppressed passion, he had yet the sense to feel that, when all the halo\r\nthat now surrounded him had evaporated, and Mrs. M'Catchley was\r\nredelivered up to the Pompleys, whom he felt to be the last persons his\r\ninterest could desire for her advisers--the thought of his low relations\r\nwould return with calm reflection. Now was the time. The iron was\r\nhot--now was the time to strike it, and forge the enduring chain. As he\r\nled Mrs. M'Catchley after the dance, into the lawn, he therefore said\r\ntenderly: \"How shall I thank you for the favor you have done me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Mrs. M'Catchley warmly, \"it was no favor--and I am so glad--\"\r\nShe stopped.\r\n\r\n\"You're not ashamed of me, then, in spite of what has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ashamed of you! Why, I should be so proud of you, if I were--\"\r\n\r\n\"Finish the sentence, and say--'your wife!'--there it is out. My dear\r\nmadam, I am rich, as you know; I love you very heartily. With your help,\r\nI think I can make a figure in a larger world than this; and that\r\nwhatever my father, my grandson at least will be--But it is time enough\r\nto speak of _him_. What say you?--you turn away. I'll not tease you--it\r\nis not my way. I said before, ay or no; and your kindness so emboldens\r\nme that I say it again--ay or no?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you take me so unawares--so--so--Lord, my dear Mr. Avenel; you are\r\nso hasty--I--I--.\" And the widow actually blushed, and was genuinely\r\nbashful.\r\n\r\n\"Those horrid Pompleys!\" thought Richard, as he saw the Colonel bustling\r\nup with Mrs. M'Catchley's cloak on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"I press for your answer,\" continued the suitor, speaking very fast. \"I\r\nshall leave this place to-morrow, if you will not give it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave this place--leave me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will be mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Avenel!\" said the widow, languidly, and leaving her hand in\r\nhis; \"who can resist you?\" Up came Colonel Pompley: Richard took the\r\nshawl: \"No hurry for that now, Colonel--Mrs. M'Catchley feels already at\r\nhome here.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes afterwards. Richard Avenel so contrived that it was known by\r\nthe whole company that their host was accepted by the Honorable Mrs.\r\nM'Catchley. And every one said, \"He is a very clever man, and a very\r\ngood fellow,\" except the Pompleys--and the Pompleys were frantic. Mr.\r\nRichard Avenel had forced his way into the aristocracy of the country.\r\nThe husband of an Honorable--connected with peers!\r\n\r\n\"He will stand for our city--Vulgarian!\" cried the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"And his wife will walk out before me,\" cried the Colonel's lady--\"nasty\r\nwoman!\" And she burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThe guests were gone; and Richard had now leisure to consider what\r\ncourse to pursue with regard to his sister and her son.\r\n\r\nHis victory over his guests had in much softened his heart towards his\r\nrelations; but he still felt bitterly aggrieved at Mrs. Fairfield's\r\nunseasonable intrusion, and his pride was greatly chafed by the boldness\r\nof Leonard. He had no idea of any man whom he had served, or meant to\r\nserve, having a will of his own--having a single thought in opposition\r\nto his pleasure. He began, too, to feel that words had passed between\r\nhim and Leonard which could not be well forgotten by either, and would\r\nrender their close connection less pleasant than heretofore. He, the\r\ngreat Richard Avenel, beg pardon of Mrs. Fairfield, the washerwoman! No;\r\nshe and Leonard must beg his. \"That must be the first step,\" said\r\nRichard Avenel; \"and I suppose they have come to their senses.\" With\r\nthat expectation, he unlocked the door of his parlor, and found himself\r\nin complete solitude. The moon, lately risen, shone full into the room,\r\nand lit up every corner. He stared round, bewildered--the birds had\r\nflown. \"Did they go through the key-hole?\" said Mr. Avenel. \"Ha! I\r\nsee!--the window is open!\" The window reached to the ground. Mr. Avenel,\r\nin his excitement, had forgotten that easy mode of egress.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, throwing himself into his easy-chair, \"I suppose I\r\nshall soon hear from them; they'll be wanting my money fast enough, I\r\nfancy.\" His eye caught sight of a letter, unsealed, lying on the table.\r\nHe opened it, and saw bank-notes to the amount of L50--the widow's\r\nforty-five country notes, and a new note, Bank of England, that he had\r\nlately given to Leonard. With the money were these lines, written in\r\nLeonard's bold, clear writing, though a word or two here and there\r\nshowed that the hand had trembled--\r\n\r\n     \"I thank you for all you have done to one whom you regarded\r\n     as the object of charity. My mother and I forgive what has\r\n     passed. I depart with her. You bade me make my choice, and I\r\n     have made it. LEONARD FAIRFIELD.\"\r\n\r\nThe paper dropped from Richard's hand, and he remained mute and\r\nremorseful for a moment. He soon felt, however, that he had no help for\r\nit but working himself up into a rage. \"Of all creatures in the world,\"\r\ncried Richard, stamping his foot on the floor, \"there are none so\r\ndisagreeable, insolent, and ungrateful as poor relations. I wash my\r\nhands of them!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Review of the Month\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nBoth political parties are already moving with reference to the choice\r\nof a Presidential candidate for the coming campaign of 1852. The\r\ndemonstrations thus far, however, have been principally local, and give\r\nno clue whatever to the probable choice of the National Conventions of\r\nthe parties. In Boston, a paper nominating the Hon. Daniel Webster for\r\nthe Presidency, on the ground of his devotion to the Union and\r\nConstitution, has been circulated for signatures. The Democrats of New\r\nHampshire have declared their preference for the Hon. Levi Woodbury. The\r\nWhigs of Pennsylvania manifest a strong predilection for taking up Gen.\r\nScott. A considerable class, who advocate the freedom of the Public\r\nLands to actual settlers, have formally adopted the Hon. Isaac P.\r\nWalker, of Wisconsin, for their candidate.\r\n\r\nThe President and Cabinet reached Buffalo on Friday afternoon, the 17th\r\nof May. Here they were received by an immense concourse of people, and\r\npublicly welcomed by the city authorities. On the following day the\r\nPresident went to Aurora, to visit his father's family, and Secretaries\r\nGraham and Crittenden took the opportunity to visit Niagara. The\r\ndistinguished guests left Buffalo on the following Tuesday morning,\r\ndined at Rochester, where a public reception was given to them, and were\r\ngreeted at Syracuse, where they arrived at midnight, with a torchlight\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nThe next day they visited Rome, Oneida and Utica, where they remained\r\nall night, and were received in Albany on Thursday afternoon, the 23d,\r\nwith a grand military and civic reception. From Albany they returned\r\ndirectly to Washington, making no stop at any intermediate point. Mr.\r\nWebster, who had been detained at Dunkirk by the illness of his son,\r\nremained at Buffalo a few days after the departure of the Presidential\r\nparty. On Wednesday evening, the 21st, he was complimented with a dinner\r\nfrom the citizens, at which he made a familiar speech of some length.\r\nThe following day he addressed the citizens of Buffalo. His speech was\r\nan explanation and defence of his course with regard to the Compromise\r\nmeasures, and the questions which have recently agitated the country. It\r\nis regarded as one of the most able and effective addresses he has made\r\nfor some time past. On his return to Washington, Mr. Webster delivered\r\nanother speech at Albany on the 29th.\r\n\r\nThe Government has received information from Chihuahua, that claims to\r\nthe amount of twenty millions of dollars, for damages done to Mexican\r\nproperty by the Indians from the American side of the Rio Grande, have\r\nbeen filed with the Mexican authorities for presentation to our\r\nGovernment under the Treaty which provides that this country shall\r\nprevent Indian depredations. Much damage has unquestionably been\r\ncommitted since the Treaty, but the amount has been enormously\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster General has announced an arrangement, to take effect\r\nafter the 1st of this month, by which letters to the West India Islands,\r\nports in the Gulf of Mexico and on the Atlantic Coast of South America,\r\ncan be sent through the United States Post Office, on prepayment of the\r\nAmerican postage to any of the British ports, with the addition of the\r\nBritish postage, when destined for ports belonging to other Governments.\r\n\r\nM. de Sartiges, the newly appointed French Minister to this country,\r\npresented his credentials to the President on the 29th of May. Mr.\r\nPaine, who claims to have invented a process for manufacturing gas from\r\nwater, is in Washington endeavoring to procure a contract from\r\nWashington for the illumination of light-houses. The pendulum\r\nexperiment, exhibiting the rotation of the earth, has been tried in the\r\nCapitol, with the most satisfactory result.\r\n\r\nThe projected expedition for the invasion of Cuba, has, it is believed,\r\nbeen completely broken up. The Steamer Gaston, after searching the\r\ncoasts and rivers, returned to Baltimore with twenty-five men under\r\narrest. A camp of three hundred men, near Jacksonville, had been broken\r\nup just before the arrival of the Steamer. Upwards of fifteen hundred\r\npersons had visited the place since the invasion was projected, but\r\nafter squandering their funds, they again dispersed. The U.S. revenue\r\ncutter Fancy went on a similar cruise, a week after the Gaston, and\r\nsucceeded in discovering an encampment on a branch of the St. John's\r\nriver. The three officers and leaders of the company were arrested and\r\ntaken to Savannah; the men were ordered to return to their homes.\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable stir in State politics and legislation\r\nduring the past month. In the Virginia Reform Convention, the violent\r\ndebate on the question of representation, on which the members of the\r\neastern and western parts of the State were arrayed against each other,\r\nhas been settled by the adoption of a compromise. The difficulty was in\r\nrelation to slave representation. The committee to whom the subject was\r\nreferred, reported a plan providing that the House of Delegates shall\r\nconsist of 150 members, eighty-two to be chosen from the West and\r\nsixty-eight from the East, making a Western majority of fourteen; the\r\nSenate to consist of fifty members, thirty from the East and twenty from\r\nthe West, making an Eastern majority of ten. It is also made the duty of\r\nthe General Assembly, in the year 1865, to re-apportion the\r\nrepresentation in both Houses. The people of Maryland have adopted the\r\nnew State Constitution by a large majority. Its prominent features\r\nare--the ineligibility of clergymen to seats in the Legislature; the\r\ndisqualification of persons engaged in duels as principals or seconds,\r\nfrom holding office; the extension of the Governor's term to four years,\r\nat a salary of $2,600 per annum; the election of judges by the people;\r\nthe abolition of lotteries and of imprisonment for debt, and the\r\nexemption of the homestead, to the value of $500, from legal process.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Legislature adjourned on the 24th of May, after a\r\nsession of nearly five months. A bill for the aid of the proposed\r\nEuropean and North American Halifax Railroad, was debated at\r\nconsiderable length, but was finally referred to the next Legislature.\r\nThe message of the Governor of Maine, which was delivered to the\r\nLegislature on the 19th of May, contains a strong complaint against\r\nMassachusetts for her policy in regard to her claims in Maine lands, and\r\nespecially for refusing her aid in the construction of the Aroostook\r\nRoad, which passes through the territory claimed by Massachusetts. The\r\nelection in Texas for Governor and Members of the Legislature, is\r\nexciting great interest. Unusual importance is attached to the election,\r\nas the disposition of the Ten Millions received from the United States\r\nwill be in the hands of the successful candidates. Mr. Foote, U.S.\r\nSenator from Mississippi, has been nominated by the Union Convention of\r\nthat State as candidate for Governor, which nomination he has accepted.\r\n\r\nThe secession excitement is on the decline in South Carolina, and no\r\nfurther action on the subject is anticipated. In Georgia, the\r\nsecessionists held a State Convention at Milledgeville, on the 28th of\r\nMay. A series of resolutions was adopted, declaring that the rights of\r\nthe South had been violated, and advocating the extension of the line of\r\n36 deg. 30', as the limit of slavery, to the Pacific Ocean. The Union\r\nConvention of the same State met on the 3d of June, and after\r\nre-adopting the resolutions of the Georgia Convention, nominated the\r\nHon. Howell Cobb, late Speaker of Congress, as candidate for Governor.\r\n\r\nAn important law-suit, which, has some resemblance to the late agitation\r\non the Slavery question, has been pending in the United States Circuit\r\nCourt, in New-York. The suit was commenced at the instance of the\r\nSouthern Methodist Conference against the Trustees of the Methodist Book\r\nConcern, in New-York, for the establishment of a claim to a large amount\r\nof property now in the hands of the Trustees. A division of the American\r\nMethodist Church took place in 1845, on account of a difference in\r\nrelation to the ownership of slaves by the ministry of the Church. The\r\nSouthern members formed a separate organization, called the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church, South, and have since then claimed a division of the\r\nfunds of the Book Concern. The Northern Church, in their defence,\r\nmaintained that the separation was a secession on the part of the South,\r\nand therefore that the Church was not entitled to any share in the\r\nestablishment. As the property of the concern is valued at nearly a\r\nmillion of dollars, the case assumed an important aspect, and the ablest\r\ncounsel were employed on both sides. Daniel Webster and Reverdy Johnson\r\nwere engaged by the plaintiffs, and Thomas Ewing and Rufus Choate for\r\nthe defence. The case has not yet been decided, but in the mean time\r\nproposals for arbitration and compromise have been made, which may prove\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe elections in New-York to supply the vacancies in the State Senate,\r\ncreated by the resignation of twelve senators, for the purpose of\r\ndefeating the bill for the enlargement of the Erie Canal, by leaving\r\nthat body without a quorum, took place on the 27th of May. Six of the\r\nformer senators were returned, and five others, favorable to the\r\nenlargement, in place of those who had resigned: the vote in the 26th\r\nDistrict was a tie. The special session of the Legislature met on the\r\n10th of June. The election secured to the Senate a quorum of the friends\r\nof the Canal Bill, and therefore insures its passage.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Census of the United States has been published. The total\r\npopulation amounts to 23,267,408, including 3,179,470 slaves. The whole\r\nnumber of Representatives to Congress based on this population is 233.\r\n\r\nAn attack of \"gold excitement,\" on a small scale, has appeared in Maine.\r\nIt is reported and generally believed that the precious metal has been\r\nfound in the Northern part of the State, in the streams which flow into\r\nthe west branch of the Penobscot and into Moose River. The country is a\r\nhigh plateau, near the Canadian boundary, where, also, the tributaries\r\nof the Chaudiere take their rise. On the latter streams, it is said, the\r\nProvincial Government of Canada has been quietly carrying on mining\r\noperations for two years past. Several companies of adventurers from the\r\ntowns of Maine and New Hampshire have started for the Northern Eldorado.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Western States have been visited by violent and\r\ndestructive tornadoes. In the city of St. Louis, upwards of one hundred\r\nbuildings were injured. The regions about Louisville, Ky., and\r\nPittsburg, also suffered severely. During the last week in May an\r\nimmense amount of rain fell in the Northern part of Illinois; occasional\r\ngreat freshets in all the rivers. The flood was greater than had been\r\nknown for many years; the mill-dams and mills were swept away, and a\r\ngreat amount of property damaged. Two viaducts on the Indiana Canal were\r\nentirely destroyed. The grain crops of the Middle and Western States\r\npromise an abundant harvest. The cotton crop in South Carolina, the\r\nnorthern part of Georgia and the Tennessee Valley, has been considerably\r\ninjured by the coldness of the season.\r\n\r\nA serious riot occurred at Hoboken, near New-York, on Monday, the 26th\r\nof May. It was the holiday of Pentecost, and the German residents of the\r\ncity, to the number of near ten thousand, crossed the Hudson to\r\ncelebrate the day according to their national customs. They were beset\r\nin the afternoon by a company of rowdies, between whom and a German\r\nsociety of gymnasts an altercation arose, resulting in a general fight,\r\nin the course of which the Germans were grossly injured by their\r\nantagonists. Two persons were killed, and forty or fifty badly wounded.\r\nThe rowdies all escaped, and of fifty Germans who were arrested, only\r\nten were found to have participated in the affray. The riot, after\r\nlasting till 9 o'clock at night, was finally quelled by calling out the\r\nmilitary. The inhabitants of Hoboken have organized a company for the\r\nprevention of disorder in future.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of May Jenny Lind gave fourteen concerts in New-York,\r\nwithout any diminution of her wonderful success, the last concert\r\nrealizing upwards of $18,000. At the close, the termination of her\r\ncontract with Mr. Barnum, at the hundredth concert, was announced. On\r\ngiving her first concert at Philadelphia, however, a new agreement was\r\nmade, by which the contract was at once broken off, Miss Lind having\r\nthen sung ninety-three times, on condition of her forfeiting the sum of\r\n$25,000. The concerts in Philadelphia, given on her own account, were\r\nvery successful.\r\n\r\nSeveral large defalcations in public officers have lately come to light.\r\nThe Postmaster of Macon, Ga., failed for the sum of $50,000, part of\r\nwhich was the Post-office funds. He escaped by flight. The late City\r\nCollector of Baltimore is charged with a deficiency of $30,000 in the\r\naccounts of the Custom House, but has surrendered his property in trust,\r\nand expresses his desire to have the subject investigated. A man named\r\nBrown was recently taken to Washington by the Marshal of Michigan, on a\r\ncharge of forging Land Warrants. A company of Mormons, under the\r\ngovernment of a man named Strang, on Beaver Island, in Huron River, have\r\ngot into difficulty with the authorities and the American citizens. They\r\nrecently attacked two men by the name of Bennett, who were known to be\r\nhostile to their claims: killed one, and dangerously wounded the other.\r\nStrang and some of his companions voluntarily delivered themselves into\r\nthe hands of the authorities, and are awaiting their trial.\r\n\r\nIn the Lake Superior region business of all kinds has become very\r\nactive. The steamboats on the Lake are crowded with passengers and\r\nfreight, and the country about the mines is improving rapidly. Lands are\r\nbeing cleared, roads laid out, houses built, and the region rapidly\r\nassuming the appearance of a permanent settlement. Several new mines of\r\nunusual richness have been discovered, and all the old shafts deepened\r\nand extended, with the most successful results. The prospects of the\r\nmines on the Ontmagon are equally favorable. Hostilities have again\r\nbroken out between the Sioux and Chippewa Indians. Several of the latter\r\ntribe were murdered by the former, who formed into war parties, and\r\nmarched against their enemies.\r\n\r\nThe first Centennial Celebration of the Pennsylvania Hospital took place\r\non the 3d of June, in Philadelphia.--The cholera still appears at\r\nintervals along the Western rivers. There were 13 deaths in New Orleans\r\nduring the week ending May 31st.--In the case of Scott, indicted at\r\nBoston for the rescue of the fugitive slave Shadrach, the jury were\r\nunable to agree upon a verdict. Although agreeing as to the\r\nconstitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Law, they stood equally divided\r\non the question of convicting the prisoner. A new trial has been\r\nordered.\r\n\r\nA personal combat took place in the streets of Lynchburg, Va., on the\r\n5th of June, between Mr. Saunders, a member of the State Convention, and\r\nMr. Terry, Editor of the Lynchburg \"Virginian.\" Five shots were\r\nexchanged, and both parties so severely wounded that they died shortly\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe emigration across the plains has commenced, but will be much smaller\r\nthan that of last year. It is calculated that 300 wagons will cross\r\nduring the Summer, three-fourths of which will go to the Salt Lake and\r\nOregon, and the remainder to California. Grass is abundant on the\r\nplains, but the snow is reported to be very deep in the mountains beyond\r\nFort Laramie.\r\n\r\nAdvices from Texas give accounts of the rapid improvement of the lands\r\non the Brazos River. The troubles with the Indians still continue. A\r\nbattle between a small company of Texan militia and a band of Indians,\r\ntook place near the head waters of the Lema River, on the 24th of May:\r\nSix Indians were killed, and the remainder driven off. An expedition has\r\nbeen ordered by Gen. Harney, to aid the Indian agents in their demand\r\nfor the release of white prisoners in captivity. A train, composed of\r\n170 wagons, with a large escort, left San Antonio for El Paso on the 7th\r\nof May. A company of Americans, while crossing the Rio Grande to attend\r\na ball at Rima, were fired upon by a party of Mexican soldiers. Two of\r\nthe American soldiers were severely wounded, and the Mexicans apologized\r\nfor the act on the ground of its being a mistake.\r\n\r\nNews from Santa Fe to the 1st of May has arrived. On the 2d of April,\r\nGovernor Calhoun consummated a treaty with Francisco Chacon, principal\r\nchief of the Apaches east of the Rio Grande. The savages agreed to give\r\nup what stolen property had been in their possession for the previous\r\neight months, and to settle in towns, provided teachers and implements\r\nof husbandry were furnished them. As might have been expected, this\r\ntreaty was broken within three weeks of its adoption, although Chacon\r\nbound himself to maintain the peace, on penalty of forfeiting his head.\r\nFifteen companies of the U.S. troops were to leave Santa Fe on the 10th\r\nof May, upon a campaign against the Navajo Indians. This movement was\r\nconsidered necessary, on account of the serious injury which the health\r\nof the soldiers had sustained from the inactivity of their mode of life.\r\n\r\nGovernor Calhoun issued a proclamation on the 23d of April, appointing\r\nthe 19th of May for the election of members of the Legislative Assembly.\r\nThe first session of the Legislature was to commence at Santa Fe on the\r\n2d of June. The Mexicans were well pleased with the new Government,\r\nsince it removed the power from the hands of the military. Business was\r\nvery brisk at Santa Fe, and a number of mills were in the course of\r\nerection in the neighborhood. The census of the territory, taken by\r\ndirection of the Governor, shows a population of 56,984, in addition to\r\nthe Indians. The Boundary Commissioners were on the Rio Grande, near\r\nDona Ana, and had decided to place the corner-stone six or seven miles\r\nbelow that place.\r\n\r\nThe news of the formation of a Territorial Government for Utah, and the\r\nappointment of Brigham Young as Governor, was first received at the Salt\r\nLake, by way of California. The General Assembly of the Church for the\r\nState of Deseret, have transferred all their powers to the Territorial\r\nGovernment, and adjourned. The \"Quorum of Seventies\" had agreed to erect\r\nan extensive rotunda in the Salt Lake City, to be called the \"Seventies'\r\nHall of Science.\" The Mormons have established a colony in Iron County,\r\nabout 250 miles nearly south of the Salt Lake City. Several families,\r\nwith 130 men and supplies of all kinds, under charge of Elder Geo. A.\r\nSmith, left on the 7th of December, and when last heard from, they had\r\n1600 acres cleared, and 400 sown with grain. Elders Lyman and Rich left\r\nearly in March with 150 wagons, to form another settlement on the\r\nColorado, on the Californian line. The Mormons design establishing a\r\ncontinuous line of stations on the Pacific on this route.\r\n\r\nThe steamers which left San Francisco on the 15th of April and the 1st\r\nof May, carried away $3,000,000 in gold dust, nearly all of which was\r\nshipped to the Atlantic States. The news from all parts of the gold\r\nregion is unusually favorable. The rains which came on towards the end\r\nof March continued for two weeks, and furnished an abundant supply of\r\nwater for the dry diggings. The piles of earth which had been heaped up\r\nduring the winter, were yielding excellent returns. In the higher ranges\r\nof the mountains there had been heavy falls of snow, which had cut off\r\nthe supplies of some of the remote diggings, and several persons were\r\nfrozen to death near the head waters of Feather River. The rich placers\r\ndiscovered in this region have attracted many thousands of miners; and\r\nthe trail through the snows was lined with the carcases of mules which\r\nhad perished from the cold. On account of the scarcity of supplies,\r\nboard had risen to $56 per week.\r\n\r\nImportant discoveries have been made in Shaste Valley, in the northern\r\npart of the State. One thousand acres were tested, and found to yield\r\nten cents to the panful of earth. The first discoverers averaged $80\r\napiece daily. The diggings differ from all others in the circumstance of\r\nall the earth containing gold down to the bottom rock, which is struck\r\nat a depth of four feet. The gold is found in coarse grams, interspersed\r\nwith large lumps. An extensive emigration had already set towards the\r\nnew placer. The Volcano diggings continue to give large returns; while\r\nthere is no diminution in the yield of the old localities on the\r\nAmerican Fork, the Stanislaus and the Mariposa. The quartz veins on the\r\nlatter river and in the neighborhood of Nevada City, give proof of\r\nastonishing richness; but the gold is generally found in such fine\r\nparticles, that not more than half of it can be collected by any\r\nmachinery which has yet been brought into use. Veins of silver ore,\r\nwhich promise to be very rich, have been discovered on Carson's Creek.\r\n\r\nThe Californian Legislature adjourned on the last day of April, after a\r\nsession of four months. Among its last acts was the passage of a law,\r\nexempting homesteads and other property from forced sale in certain\r\ncases. It also passed a Usury Law, fixing interest at ten per cent., and\r\nallowing eighteen per cent. by special agreement. Party politics have\r\nattained a height scarcely known in the older States at present. The\r\nCity election in San Francisco was very hotly contested, but finally\r\nresulted in the choice of all the Whig candidates, except two. Both\r\nparties are marshalling their forces for the coming State election. The\r\nprominent candidates for Governor, are Major Roman, the present State\r\nTreasurer, with the Democrats, and Major Pearson B. Redding with the\r\nWhigs.\r\n\r\nA body of Indians have been committing depredations on the Salinas\r\nPlains, near Monterey. They have killed three persons near the town of\r\nSan Luis Obispo, robbed all the ranches, and driven away the horses from\r\nSan Antonio to San Miguel. According to the treaty made with the Nevada\r\nIndians by the U. S. Commissioners, six tribes, numbering in all 1500\r\npersons, have been removed to a tract of land twelve miles square,\r\nbetween the Merced and Tuolomne Rivers, which is secured to them for\r\never. In the vicinity of Los Angeles, the tribes still continue their\r\ndepredations. Lynch law still remains in force in all the mining\r\ndistricts. A band of five Mexicans, who had been detected stealing\r\ncattle on the San Joaquin River, were tried in a summary manner, and all\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nA project has been started to supply San Francisco with water from a\r\nlake called \"Mountain Lake,\" a few miles from the city. It is described\r\nas a body of pure water, a mile in circumference, and 153 feet above the\r\nsea. A line seventy-five feet long, was dropped into the centre without\r\nfinding bottom. It is estimated to furnish twenty-five millions of\r\ngallons of pure water daily. In the neighborhood of San Francisco, San\r\nJose, Sacramento City, Sonoma and Bodega, large tracts of land have been\r\nbrought under cultivation: and the harvest of grain and vegetables will\r\nthis year go far towards supplying the wants of California. Nearly all\r\nkinds of vegetables attain a size and flavor which are not equalled in\r\nany other part of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is rumored that an expedition is about being raised in the southern\r\npart of California, for the purpose of invading the Mexican province of\r\nLower California. A certain Gen. Morehead is said to have left with a\r\nforce of two hundred men, well armed and provisioned. There is also talk\r\nof similar movement, having reference to the State of Sonora.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Mail Steamship Company have made their depot in Oregon at\r\nPacific City, on Baker's Bay. The coast region of Oregon, from the mouth\r\nof the Umpqua to Vancouver's Island, is rapidly filling up with\r\nemigrants. Another steamer, of 100 tons burden, has been placed on the\r\nWilliamette, to run from Oregon City to the mouth of the Columbia. Gen.\r\nLane, the ex-governor of the Territory, has been nominated by a\r\nconvention of the people, irrespective of party, as a candidate for\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPE.\r\n\r\nThe main topic of interest in ENGLAND is still the Great Exhibition.\r\nEven the uncertainties of the Ministerial existence, the Papal\r\nAggression Bill, the Ceylon Question, and other measures, sink into\r\ninsignificance beside the imposing display of the products of all\r\nnations, opened in Hyde Park. The continued support and encouragement\r\ngiven by the Queen, who has visited it almost daily since the opening,\r\nhas contributed greatly to the success of the undertaking. The receipts\r\nfor the first two or three weeks were from $10,000 to $15,000 per day.\r\nAfter the price of admission was reduced to one shilling, the receipts\r\ndecreased considerably; but in the last accounts, from fifty to sixty\r\nthousand persons visited the building daily. The entire amount received\r\nfrom the sale is already more than L50,000; and it is expected that the\r\nproceeds will be sufficient, with the amount subscribed, to defray the\r\nwhole expense of the building. The limit for the admission of articles\r\nhas been extended to the 1st of September. Thirty juries have been\r\nappointed, to decide on the merits of the different classes of\r\ncontributions, and adjudge the medals, which will be distributed to the\r\nvalue of L20,000.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Lord John Russell holds its position with better success\r\nthan was anticipated. The Malt Tax, one of its measures, was carried by\r\na majority of 136. The debate on the Ceylon Government question, where a\r\ndefeat was again anticipated, resulted in sustaining the Ministers by a\r\nmajority of 80. As this was the main question before the House, Lord\r\nJohn Russell's place is secure for the rest of the session. The two\r\ngreat parties have agreed not to make the Papal Aggression Bill a point\r\nof political difference. In consequence of this, the Government carried\r\nevery question on the bill by a large majority. Mr. W. G. Fox made an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to introduce a bill for Free Schools in England and\r\nWales. A riot occurred at Tamworth, the residence of the late Sir Robt.\r\nPeel, on account of a Protectionist banquet having been held there. A\r\nmob broke into the hall, and dispersed the company, who armed themselves\r\nand engaged in a regular fight. The quarrel was only subdued by the\r\nintervention of the military. The Collins' steamer Pacific, having made\r\nthe trip from New-York to Liverpool in nine days and nineteen hours, the\r\nEnglish papers admit the defeat of the Cunard line.\r\n\r\nThe recent political movements in FRANCE contain no salient points of\r\ninterest. The subject of the revision of the Constitution is still\r\nagitated among all parties, and there seems a slow and gradual\r\npreparation for a severe struggle. The Legitimatists are strongly in\r\nfavor of the measure. The debate thereupon will come on about the 1st of\r\nJuly, and will probably last about a month. Next to this in importance\r\nis the subject of the next general election, which will take place in\r\nMay, 1852. All parties are mingling their intrigues in the general\r\npreparation. Among the different plans is that of the fusion of the two\r\nbranches of the Bourbon family into a single monarchical party, to which\r\nGuizot and the Duke de Nemours are said to be favorable. The friends of\r\nLouis Napoleon are in favor of a revision of the Constitution for the\r\npurpose of prolonging his term. The _Constitutionnel_, the organ of the\r\nmiddle class in Paris, advocates the repeal of the law limiting the\r\nsuffrage. Emile de Girardin, editor of the _Presse_, has made a violent\r\nattack upon Generals Cavaignac and Changarnier, charging the latter with\r\nhaving formed a design of invading England, while Ledru-Rollin was\r\nminister of the Interior. To this attack neither of the generals has\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\nIn GERMANY, the Dresden Conferences have closed. The King of Prussia and\r\nthe Emperor of Austria have visited Warsaw as the guests of the Emperor\r\nNicholas. The meeting, however, is considered as something more than a\r\nmere visit of courtesy. At the latest dates the three potentates were\r\nstill at Warsaw, but nothing had transpired indicative of the nature of\r\ntheir conferences. The Prussian General Assembly had adjourned. During\r\nthe recent session upwards of eleven and a half millions of thalers were\r\nvoted for the expenses of the late useless campaign.\r\n\r\nAustria is making desperate efforts to relieve herself from her\r\nembarrassing financial position. Baron Rothschild, one of the principal\r\ncreditors of the empire, has been summoned to assist at the\r\nconsultation; the prospect is said to be better than had been\r\nanticipated. A change has taken place in the Austrian Ministry,\r\nBaumgarten having been made Minister of Commerce in place of Brueck. The\r\nCountess Teleki, and her companion Madame Eardly, have been arrested in\r\nHungary, on charge of conveying letters from the political refugees in\r\nLondon to their partisans in Asia Minor and Hungary. They are to be\r\ntried by a court martial.\r\n\r\nITALY is in a most unfortunate condition. The reaction continues to\r\nincrease in power, while the discontent of the Republican party still\r\nferments in all quarters. The condition of the country is very analogous\r\nto what it was previous to the Revolution. The Government of Tuscany is\r\nentirely under the control of Austria; while that of Naples, grown bold\r\nin tyranny, is more actively oppressive than ever. The death of the King\r\nof Naples was reported; but it turns out that instead of this being the\r\ncase, he is more vigorous and tyrannical than ever. In Rome, the rule of\r\nthe French soldiery is almost insupportable. Persons are daily arrested\r\nfor the cut of their beards, or the color of their garments. In addition\r\nto this, there is a bitter hostility between the French and Roman\r\ntroops, and several sanguinary quarrels have occurred. At Nice there has\r\nbeen a threatening meeting, claiming the revocation of certain fiscal\r\nregulations of the Government. There has been no league of Sardinia with\r\nany other of the Italian States.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection of the Duke de Saldanha, in PORTUGAL, was entirely\r\nsuccessful; and the Queen has been obliged to name him President of the\r\nCouncil, after an attempt to appoint the Viscount de Castro and the Duke\r\nof Terecira, friends of the fallen Minister, Count de Thomar. The latter\r\ngentleman was dismissed from his situation as Minister to Madrid, and\r\nhas taken up his residence in England. Saldanha remained some time in\r\nOporto, administering the Government in the name of the Queen, but\r\nafterwards proceeded to Lisbon. He has not yet announced the course he\r\nwill pursue. In the mean time, large bodies of Reformers are calling\r\nupon the Queen to abdicate.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations in relation to the release of Kossuth, Count Bathyani,\r\nand the other Hungarian leaders, have taken an unfavorable turn; and it\r\nis now almost certain that the Sublime Porte will consent to retain the\r\nunfortunate exiles as prisoners for some time to come. The Governments\r\nof Austria and Russia protest against their release, and their influence\r\nwill probably prevent the acceptance of the liberal offer made by the\r\nUnited States in behalf of the Hungarians.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Parliament met at Toronto on the 20th of May, by Lord\r\nElgin, the Governor-General, who read the Royal speech in English and\r\nFrench. The most important topic it contained was a project for\r\nincreasing the representation. It was also stated that the change in the\r\nNavigation Laws had increased foreign shipping in the Canadian ports;\r\nthat the new Postage Law will soon yield an equal revenue with the\r\nformer exorbitant system; that a measure will be introduced for reducing\r\nthe civil list and withdrawing the troops. The Government refers to the\r\nHalifax and Quebec Railroad in a manner favorable to the adoption of the\r\nconditions on which the Imperial Government offer to guaranty a loan.\r\nThe Government has since introduced a measure to abolish the law of\r\nprimogeniture in Upper Canada. The question of a reciprocity of trade\r\nwith the United States, has given rise to a long discussion in the\r\nLegislature; but the Governor refused to produce the correspondence on\r\nthe subject with the Government of the United States. The Minister of\r\nFinance insisted on measures of retaliation, and proposed to close the\r\ncanals against American vessels. The question was finally postponed for\r\na fortnight, in order to await the result of negotiations with the\r\nAmerican Government. The Governor-General sent to the Assembly a\r\ndetailed account of the public debt of the Canadas, which, on the 31st\r\nof January last, amounted to $18,049,875, paying an annual interest of\r\n$877,674.\r\n\r\nThe Annexation feeling is said to be on the decrease in Canada, and the\r\nidea of an independent Northern Republic, consisting of the British\r\nProvinces and the territory now held by the Hudson's Bay Company, has\r\narisen in its stead! The Episcopal Church is making great efforts to\r\nprevent the secularization of the Clergy Reserves, and a general\r\nConvention of both the clergy and laity has been held at Toronto, in\r\nopposition to the measure. A large and enthusiastic meeting has been\r\nheld at Halifax, and Earl Grey's proposition in regard to the Halifax\r\nand Quebec Railway, was unanimously accepted. The propeller Franklin,\r\nrunning between St. John's, Newfoundland, and Halifax, was wrecked on\r\nthe 17th of May; the passengers and mails were saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEXICO--CENTRAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Government is in a state of great perplexity, on account of\r\nthe desperate state of its finances. All projects for the adjustment of\r\nthe revenues, or the consolidation of the Interior Debt, have thus far\r\nentirely failed. Senor Esteva, the Minister of Finance, resigned early\r\nin May, on account of the difficulties he encountered in attempting to\r\ncarry out the imperfect provisions of the law. Senor Yanez, the Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs, was appointed in his place. He proposed a plan of\r\nincreasing the revenue by reducing the expenses of the public offices,\r\nimposing a tax on manufactures, and levying contributions on the\r\nStates,--a course which was strongly opposed by the friends of the\r\nAdministration. Congress adjourned on the 22d of May, without making any\r\nprovision for the emergency: and a special session has been called, to\r\nmeet on the 2d of June. The Tehuantepec grant to Garay was annulled in\r\nboth Houses by a large majority.\r\n\r\nEx-President Pedraza died in the capital on the 13th of April. The\r\ncommercial house of Rondero, in the city of Mexico, has failed in the\r\namount of $600,000. The police in the city is very deficient, and many\r\nof the streets in the suburbs are almost deserted, on account of the\r\nhordes of robbers which roam and plunder at large. The Northern States\r\nof Mexico are in great distress, from an unprecedented drought. No rain\r\nhas fallen since last August; provisions are enormously dear, and a\r\ngeneral famine was apprehended.\r\n\r\nIn Yucatan, the Indian war is drawing to a close. Gen. La Vega, who had\r\narrived at Campeachy to take command of the forces, was received with\r\ngreat enthusiasm. The Indians have recently sustained several bloody\r\ndefeats, and are evidently very much discouraged. In their endeavor to\r\ntake by assault the town of Bacalar, they were received with such a\r\nheavy fire by the garrison, that they were utterly routed, and the river\r\nwas choked up by their dead bodies, while the whites suffered only a\r\ntrifling loss.\r\n\r\nThere is little news of interest from Central America. A mule-track, or\r\ntransit-road as it is called, has been made from Rivas de Nicaragua to\r\nthe Gulf of San Juan del Sur: and the line from New-York to San\r\nFrancisco is expected to be completed by the 17th of July. The subject\r\nof a new Constitution is engaging public attention in Honduras. A\r\nviolent earthquake was experienced in the State of Costa Rica, on the\r\nmorning of the 18th of March. A great amount of property was destroyed\r\nin the cities of San Jose, Heredia, and Barba.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST INDIES.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba, the fears of an invasion, with which the island has been\r\nagitated for three months past, appear to have subsided. A number of\r\narrests have been made, but no revolutionary preparations have been\r\ndiscovered. Several prisoners have been convicted of disaffection to the\r\nGovernment, and are to be sent to Spain for safekeeping. Mr. Christopher\r\nMadan, who voluntarily delivered himself up to the authorities, has been\r\nbanished to Spain, and condemned to pay his share of the damages done by\r\nLopez at Cardenas.\r\n\r\nThe Jamaica House of Assembly was prorogued by the Governor on the 23d\r\nof May; the Governor made a long speech on the occasion. The cholera\r\nstill lingers in the island, and appears in several localities which\r\nhave been hitherto exempt.\r\n\r\nThe island of Hayti is tranquil for the present. The proposition of the\r\nU.S. Commissioner. Mr. Walsh, in connection with the French and English\r\nConsuls, for a ten years' truce with the Dominicans, was rejected by the\r\nHaytian Government. The Emperor has since addressed a proclamation to\r\nthe former Government, proposing the appointment of delegates on both\r\nsides, to negotiate terms of peace. Prince Bobo, who, in consequence of\r\nhaving been engaged in a conspiracy against the Emperor, had fled to the\r\nmountains with a few adherents, has not been captured.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nAn insurrection broke out in Santiago, the capital of Chili, on the 20th\r\nof April. It was occasioned by excited political feeling, growing out of\r\nthe approaching Presidential election. About twenty persons were killed,\r\nand fifty wounded. The province was immediately placed under martial\r\nlaw: and as the Government possesses much power, no further trouble was\r\nanticipated. About seven o'clock, on the morning of the 2d of April,\r\nValparaiso was visited by a terrible earthquake. The earth continued to\r\nheave violently for a minute, throwing down a large number of buildings,\r\nand cracking and damaging others. The population assembled in the\r\nsquares in the utmost terror and distress. Soon afterwards a heavy rain\r\nset in, which, on account of the shattered roofs, did immense damage to\r\nproperty. The entire loss is estimated at $1,500,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Brazil is adopting stringent measures for the\r\nsuppression of the Slave Trade. Several of the most prominent dealers\r\nhave been fined or forced to leave the country.\r\n\r\nThe hostility to Rosas in Brazil, Paraguay, Entre-Rios and the Oriental\r\nStates, became so great, that, seeing no way of extricating himself from\r\nthe difficulty, he offered his resignation to the Legislature of Buenos\r\nAyres. This, however, was considered as merely a trick to shift the\r\nresponsibility from his own shoulders. Five of the Argentine Provinces\r\nhave passed resolutions refusing to accept his resignation, and\r\nrestoring to him all his former powers. The city of Montevideo is still\r\nbesieged by the forces of Gen. Oribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYNESIA.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March another difficulty occurred between the French\r\nofficials at the Sandwich Islands and the Hawaiian Government. The\r\nFrench demanded a repeal of the duty on wines and brandies, the election\r\nof a Frenchman to the Cabinet of King Kamehameha, and the adoption of\r\nthe French language as the official tongue! In case of refusal, they\r\nthreatened to blockade Honolulu, and take possession of the island. A\r\ncompromise was effected, however, in which the King agreed to refer the\r\ndisputed subjects to the Legislature, and to receive documents from\r\nFrench subjects in the French language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT DEATHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. SAMUEL GEORGE MORTON, one of the most eminent of our men of science,\r\ndied suddenly in Philadelphia on the 15th of May. Mr. E. G. Squier, in\r\nannouncing the occurrence to the Ethnological Society, said: \"The name\r\nof Dr. Morton is best known to the world through those splendid\r\nmonuments of scientific research, '_Crania Americana_,' and '_Crania\r\nEgyptiaca_', which attest alike his industry and zeal!--his patient\r\nanalytical and comprehensive generalizing abilities, and his sound and\r\nimpartial judgment. Besides these works, he was the author of numerous\r\npapers in scientific journals of this country and of Europe, as also of\r\na number of pamphlets on various subjects connected with the studies in\r\nwhich he was engaged. Among these the 'Inquiry into the Distinctive\r\nCharacteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America,' published in 1844,\r\ndeserves to be specially mentioned as a comprehensive _resume_ of the\r\ngeneral results of his inquiries. Dr. Morton had a wide practice in his\r\nprofession, of which he was a distinguished member--a profession\r\npeculiarly subject to those interruptions and contingencies so\r\nunfavorable to philosophical investigation. Yet in the intervals of\r\nleisure which were afforded to him during hours snatched from sleep, he\r\nmade those arduous researches of which we have the leading results in\r\nthe works which I have enumerated. The facts and data upon which these\r\nresearches were based, were collected with almost incredible labor, and\r\nat an expense which few students could afford, or affording, would have\r\nconsented to incur. Dr. MORTON'S museum of Crania, presented by him to\r\nthe Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, of which he was a\r\nprincipal supporter and most active officer, comprised not less than 900\r\nhuman skulls, and 600 of the inferior animals. These were collected from\r\nevery quarter of the globe, and afford types of every race, and almost\r\nevery family of men. The correspondence and general and special\r\nexertions, which the collection of such a museum involves, must have\r\nbeen immense; and we can but admire the untiring zeal and patient\r\nindustry of the man who undertook and accomplished it. It is a brilliant\r\nexample of what men may do if animated by a true spirit; and must afford\r\nencouragement to those engaged in cognate researches in a country like\r\nour own, where public aid is rarely extended to objects of this nature.\r\nAs Americans we may take just pride in the reflection, that an American\r\nphysician, by his individual exertions, with the aid of a few personal\r\nfriends, made a Craniological Museum surpassing extent the united\r\ncollections of half of Europe, and one which must now be consulted by\r\nevery scholar before he can undertake to write upon the great questions\r\ninvolved in the natural history of man. In March last the Government of\r\nthe United States placed in the hands of Dr. MORTON the Crania collected\r\nby the American Exploring Expedition, with a view to their careful\r\ninvestigation at his hands; but the interesting results which we had\r\nevery reason to expect from such investigation, have been cut short by\r\nhis untimely death, which has also suddenly terminated a wide series of\r\ninquiries, instituted by the same active mind, looking to a work more\r\ncomprehensive, if not more interesting and valuable than any which he\r\nhad published before. Dr. MORTON was essentially a man of no theories;\r\nhe brought to the service of science an earnest love of truth in its\r\nsimplest and severest form, and was always ready to yield his opinions\r\nto the rigid requirements of facts. Possessed of a high intellect and a\r\ngenerous disposition, he always assumed that those who differed most\r\nwidely from him in their views, were animated by the same desire to\r\narrive at truth, and dealt with questions of science as matters to be\r\nkept superior to all personal considerations and influences. He had, in\r\nshort, a true appreciation of the dignity and aims of philosophy. In\r\nprivate life, and in his personal intercourse with men, Dr. MORTON added\r\nlustre to his high character as a scholar and philosopher. Mild and\r\ncourteous in his demeanor, devoted in his friendships, generous,\r\nupright, and true; as a husband, father, friend and citizen, he was a\r\nman in the noblest acceptation of the word--one whom, none knew but to\r\nesteem, and whose whole life as a model of virtue and excellence.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. SHEIL, one of the most brilliant rhetoricians of the age in which he\r\nlived, has prematurely closed his remarkable career in a foreign land,\r\nand in a manner so sudden that the surprise which the event must\r\noccasion will be only exceeded by the deep affliction of his friends and\r\nthe regret of the public. The Right Hon. Richard Lalor Sheil was a\r\nnative of Dublin, born in the year 1793. His father, imitating the\r\nexample of many Irish Roman Catholics of good family, sought in other\r\ncountries that independence and those means of advancement which the\r\npenal laws, then in force, denied them in the land of their nativity. He\r\nresided for many years at Cadiz, and engaged in mercantile pursuits with\r\nmore than ordinary success. Having amassed a competence, he returned to\r\nthe county of Waterford, purchased an estate, and built a mansion.\r\nUnfortunately, he was again led into commercial speculation, which\r\nproved of a disastrous character, and he eventually died unable to\r\nbequeath to his son more than the means of acquiring a liberal\r\neducation. That education, commenced at Stoneyhurst, was continued at\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, where the young Mr. Sheil, then remarkable for\r\nthe precocity of his talents, graduated with much distinction, and at\r\nthe age of twenty-one, in the year 1814, he was called to the Irish bar.\r\nIn the profession of the law, though he attained the rank of Queen's\r\ncounsel, he never enjoyed a lucrative practice. On remarkable occasions\r\nhe held briefs and made showy speeches, but the attorneys had no\r\nconfidence in his legal acquirements, and though the judges regarded\r\naffectionately his personal character and greatly admired his genius,\r\nyet his arguments were listened to with comparatively little attention.\r\nIt was said, however, that he determined, if possible, to get on in the\r\nmore arduous walks of the profession, and hoped for especial favor in\r\nthe Rolls' Court, having married at an early age Miss O'Halloran, niece\r\nto Sir William MacMahon, (who then presided in that court), and niece\r\nalso to Sir John MacMahon, who at that time was private secretary to the\r\nPrince Regent. But all this gossip of the \"Four Courts\" ended in\r\nnothing. Mr. Sheil, instead of an eminent lawyer, became a political\r\nagitator, and in the Roman Catholic Association reached a position\r\nsecond only to that of Mr. O'Connell. His speeches at public meetings in\r\nDublin, the first of which was delivered by him at the early age of\r\neighteen, attracted the admiration of all classes; his passionate tone\r\ndelighted the vulgar, his wit and exquisite fancy charmed the most\r\ncultivated minds, while his perfect amiability of character, his high\r\nand generous nature, secured the friendship of every one who enjoyed the\r\nadvantage of his acquaintance. With all this celebrity, however, he was\r\nnot making a fortune, and when literature offered to him some of its\r\nrewards, he gladly contributed to the monthly periodicals of that day,\r\nproducing at the same time the tragedy of _Evadne_, and many other\r\ndramatic works.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Relief Bill of 1829, when it became a law, opened to\r\nMr. Sheil a new and more extended sphere of action; he was returned to\r\nParliament for Lord Anglesey's borough of Milbourne Port, and soon\r\nbecame one of the favorite orators of the House. At first, there was\r\nsome disposition to laugh at his shrill tones and vehement\r\ngesticulation, but Parliament soon recognized him as one of its\r\nornaments. His great earnestness and apparent sincerity, his unrivalled\r\nfelicity of illustration, his extraordinary power of pushing the meaning\r\nof words to the utmost extent, and wringing from them a force beyond the\r\nrange of ordinary expression, much more than the force of his reasoning\r\nor the range of his political knowledge, obtained for him in Parliament\r\nmarked attention, and, for the most part, unqualified applause. When he\r\nrose to speak, members took their places, and the hum of private\r\nconversation was hushed, in order that the House might enjoy the\r\nperformances of an accomplished artist--not that they should receive the\r\nlessons of a statesmanlike adviser, or follow the lead of a commanding\r\npolitician. Still, for twenty years, he held a prominent place in the\r\nHouse of Commons, though throughout a great portion of that period he\r\nrepresented very insignificant constituencies. Mr. Sheil was returned\r\nfor Milbourne Port in 1830, having been an unsuccessful candidate for\r\nthe county of Louth. In 1831, however, he got in for Louth; in 1832 was\r\nreturned for Tipperary, without contest, and again in 1835; but in 1837\r\nthere was an opposition, against which he prevailed. His principal\r\ninfluence in that county, exclusive of the weight of his public\r\ncharacter, is understood to have been derived from his second marriage\r\nwith the widow of Mr. Edmund Power, of Gurteen, which took place in\r\n1830. It will be remembered that the eldest son of that gentleman fell\r\nvery recently by his own hand; and during his minority, whatever\r\ninfluence he might possess as a landlord was in a great degree at the\r\ncommand of Mr. Sheil, who continued to sit for Tipperary till 1841,\r\nthough he encountered some opposition on accepting office in 1838. From,\r\nthe general election in 1841 till the time of his departure for Florence\r\nin 1850, he represented, through the influence of the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, the small borough of Dungarvon, always of course supporting\r\nthe most liberal section of the Whigs. Amongst his first appointments\r\nwas that of Vice-President of the Board of Trade, in the last Melbourne\r\nMinistry, and then he became Judge Advocate General, which office he\r\nheld only from June to September, 1841. On the return of the present\r\nMinisters he was appointed Master of the Mint, and in 1850, went out as\r\nBritish Minister to Florence. For many years past, his health had been\r\ndeclining, his fits of gout grew more frequent and severe, his speeches\r\nin Parliament, never very numerous, came at length to be few and far\r\nbetween; though his political friends regarded him with infinite favor,\r\nthey began to think he might be just as useful to them in Florence as in\r\nLondon, especially as the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill was soon to be\r\nbrought in; and although that appointment amounted to shelving for life\r\na man not yet 60 years of age, though it was nothing less than an\r\nexpatriation of the individual and an extinction of what might have been\r\na growing fame, yet he submitted not merely with a philosophical\r\nindifference, but almost in a joyous spirit, feeling, or seeming to\r\nfeel, that it was great promotion and a dignified retirement. He was old\r\nin constitution, if not in years, with powers better suited to the\r\ndevelopment of general principles than to that successful administration\r\nof details which a practical age demands. With Grattan, Flood, and\r\nCurran, he would have well co-operated from 1782 to 1800, but amongst\r\nthe public men of England in the middle of this century he appeared\r\ngrievously out of place, and he therefore was perhaps quite sincere in\r\nthe expressions of delight with which he escaped from Downing-street to\r\nenjoy the fine vintages and bright sunshine of the south. He is stated\r\nto have expired at Florence on the 26th ult., owing to an attack of gout\r\nin the stomach.--_London Times, June 3._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. RICHARD PHILLIPS, the well-known chemist, died suddenly in London on\r\nthe tenth of May. He was in his seventy-fifth year, and at least fifty\r\nyears of his life had been devoted to science. He was one of the\r\nfounders of the Geological Society, a very old member of the Royal\r\nSociety, and for many years a member of its Council. In the\r\n_Transactions_ of that body will be found numerous papers by him on\r\nchemical subjects, and many of his discoveries were of great importance\r\nto the analytical chemist. He was editor of the _Annals of Philosophy_\r\nfrom 1812, and one of the editors of the _Philosophical Magazine_. He\r\nwas appointed Lecturer on Chemistry at the London Hospital in 1817, and\r\nfor many years was Lecturer on Chemistry at St. Thomas's Hospital, to\r\nwhich office he was appointed in 1832; and was among the earliest\r\nchemists to the Museum of Practical Geology.\r\n\r\nHis attention to Pharmaceutical Chemistry was very great; and the\r\nregular improvement which has marked during the period of more than\r\ntwenty years the _London Pharmacopoeia_ has been largely due to his\r\nsuggestions and criticisms. His first translation was published in 1824.\r\nHe had been during the last twelve months busily engaged for the College\r\nof Physicians on the new edition of the _Pharmacopoeia_,--and\r\nconsiderable progress had been made in the new translation. For many\r\nyears Mr. Phillips had been in the habit of furnishing to the faculty\r\nand the druggists of the United Kingdom a translation of the\r\n_Pharmacopoeia_, with appended notes, the value of which has been\r\nfully appreciated by those for whom it was intended. He was for the last\r\ntwo years the President of the Chemical Society--by all the members of\r\nwhich he was regarded with the highest consideration. In his \"History of\r\nChemistry,\" Dr. Thompson says--\"Of modern British analytical chemists,\r\nundoubtedly the first is Mr. Richard Phillips, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor not a few analyses conducted with great skill and performed with\r\ngreat accuracy.\" All the chemical articles in the _Penny Cyclopoedia_\r\nwere by Mr. Phillips:--and scattered through the various scientific\r\njournals will be found papers on various chemical subjects and reviews\r\nof scientific works from his pen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"OLD DOWTON,\" the celebrated comedian, is dead. He was born at Exeter in\r\n1763, and consequently was in his eighty-eighth year. At sixteen he was\r\napprenticed to an architect, but having performed successfully the part\r\nof Carlos, in \"The Revenge,\" at a private theatre, he was induced to\r\njoin a travelling company, and after completing a circuit, was engaged\r\nby Mr. Hughes, manager of the Plymouth theatre. His first appearance at\r\nDrury-lane was on the tenth of October, 1796, in the difficult character\r\nof Sheva, in Cumberland's comedy of _The Jew_. This had long been a\r\nfavorite part of Bannister's--Elliston had also marked it for his own.\r\nMr. Dowton stepped into the field, and, without taking the laurel from\r\neither, honorably shared it with both. His first appearance at\r\nDrury-lane was on the tenth of October, 1796, in this difficult\r\ncharacter. He was hailed as a genuine actor, and crowned with applause.\r\nIn 1805 he was engaged at the Haymarket, and on the fifteenth of August\r\nin that year revived for his benefit the warm-weather tragedy of the\r\n_Tailors_, which produced a memorable fracas. The principal _roles_ in\r\nthe burlesque were sustained by Dowton, Mathews, Liston, and Mrs. Gibbs,\r\nas _Francisco_, _Abrahamides_, _Zachariades_, and _Tittilinda_. The\r\ngreat success of _Tom Thumb_, in which Dowton played _King Arthur_ very\r\nhumorously, stimulated him to this attempt. His two principal\r\nShakspearian characters were _Sir John Falstaff_ and _Dogberry_. As _Dr.\r\nCantwell_ in the _Hypocrite_ he was inimitable. His other best parts\r\nwere _Sir Anthony Absolute_ and _Major Sturgeon_. With the proceeds of\r\nhis farewell benefit at Her Majesty's Theatre a few years since, an\r\nannuity was purchased, on which he has lived to a fine green old age,\r\nhappy in the bosom of his family and a large circle of professional and\r\nprivate friends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADMIRAL SIR EDWARD CODRINGTON died recently in London. He entered the\r\nnaval service in 1783, and bore a part in some distinguished affairs. He\r\nwas lieutenant of the Queen Charlotte in Howe's victory of the 1st of\r\nJune, 1794, and captain of the Babet in Bridport's action, July, 1795.\r\nAt the memorable victory of Trafalgar, he was captain of the Orion. He\r\ncommanded on the Walcheren expedition; was afterwards employed at the\r\ndefence of Cadiz, and commanded a squadron co-operating with the Spanish\r\npatriots on the coast of Catalonia. He was also captain of the fleet in\r\nthe Chesapeake, and at New Orleans in 1814. In October, 1827, with the\r\ncombined fleet, he destroyed the Turkish fleet in the harbor of\r\nNavarino. He was gazetted on five occasions, viz., in 1805, 1809, 1811,\r\n1814, 1815. For some period he commanded on the Mediterranean station.\r\nHe has also held other naval appointments. He represented Devonport in\r\nParliament from 1832 to 1840. In politics he was a \"liberal.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe death of EARL COTTENHAM, late Lord Chancellor, took place at the\r\nsmall town of Pietra Santa, in the duchy of Mucca, on the twenty-ninth\r\nof April. Charles Christopher Pepys was born in Great-Russell street,\r\nBloomsbury, in 1781. The family was originally of Diss, in Norfolk, but\r\nearly in the sixteenth century it removed to Cottenham, in\r\nCambridgeshire, from which place the deceased derived his title. Amongst\r\nhis ancestors may be mentioned Samuel Pepys, author of the _Diary_, and\r\nSecretary of the Admiralty in the time of Charles the Second; and\r\nRichard Pepys, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland in 1664. William Weller\r\nPepys, the father of the late Lord Chancellor, who held the office of a\r\nMaster in Chancery, was created a baronet in the year 1801. Lord\r\nCottenham was in the seventy-first year of his age, having been born in\r\n1781. He was graduated LL.B. at Trinity College, Cambridge, 1803; was\r\ncalled to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, 1804; appointed a king's counsel,\r\n1826; Solicitor General to Queen Adelaide, 1830; solicitor-general to\r\nthe king, February, 1834; master of the rolls, September, 1834; first\r\ncommissioner when the great seal was in commission, in 1835; lord\r\nchancellor from 1836 to September, 1841, and again appointed to that\r\noffice in August, 1846; was appointed a commissioner to consider the\r\nstate of the bishoprics, 1847. Represented the borough of Malton in\r\nParliament from 1832 to 1836; had previously sat for Higham Ferrars.\r\nUnder his second appointment he held the great seal until the Easter\r\nterm, 1850, when ill health compelled him to retire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecord of Scientific Discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor S. F. B. MORSE has written an interesting letter to the\r\n_National Intelligencer_ respecting the _Hillotype_, an improvement upon\r\nthe daguerreotype which appears to be genuine and very important. The\r\nimprovement by Baird exhibited lately in London, is spoken of as a great\r\nadvance upon the silvered plate, as it cannot but be: it is making a\r\nsurface of porcelain susceptible to the sun's rays. And now, in the very\r\ndepths of our forests, a discovery has been perfected which leaves\r\nnothing to be desired by daguerreotypists. France, England, and America,\r\nhave thus each contributed to the perfection of the photogenic art, our\r\ncountry supplying the crowning improvement:\r\n\r\n\"You perhaps have seen it announced,\" says Mr. Morse, \"that a Mr. Hill,\r\nof this state, formerly a Baptist clergyman, was under the necessity,\r\nfrom ill health, of abandoning the ministry, and for a support practised\r\nthe daguerreotype art, and has made the discovery of photographing in\r\ncolors, or chromotography. The magnificence of this discovery is as\r\nremarkable as the original discovery of photography by Daguerre. Many\r\naffect to doubt the fact of this discovery by Mr. Hill, but I have every\r\nreason to believe it strictly true. A week or two since I received a\r\nmost interesting letter from him, in consequence of his learning that I\r\nhad expressed a hope that he would not think of attempting to secure his\r\nproperty in his discovery by a _patent_. I determined to visit him, and\r\nsave him, if possible, from the evils I had experienced. So last week I\r\nwent up to Kingston, and, hiring a gig, I set forth in a northwesterly\r\ndirection in search of Westkill, in Greene county, some thirty-six miles\r\nin the interior, and after seven hours' drive through a wild region of\r\nthe Western Catskill mountains, passing into the very outskirts of\r\ncivilization, through a deep gorge of mountain precipices that rose on\r\neach side of the road more than a thousand feet, at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees, I at length found the little village of some three\r\nhundred inhabitants of which I was in search, embosomed in the deep\r\nvalley of the Westkill creek. I had no difficulty in finding Mr. Hill.\r\nHe is unquestionably a man of genius, intelligence, and piety, retiring\r\nand sensitive; and his simple description of the effect upon him when\r\nthe result of his discovery stood revealed before him, was true to\r\nnature, and, among other things, demonstrated to me that his discovery\r\nwas a fact. I have not time to give you the details of the conversation;\r\nbut I succeeded in dissuading him from thinking of a patent as a\r\nsecurity, and in this I am rejoiced. He shall not be plagued by\r\nlawsuits, have his life shortened and made miserable, and his just right\r\nin the property of his discovery snatched from him, if I can prevent it.\r\nHis discovery, fortunately for him, is one that can be kept secret, and\r\nhis case furnishes a capital example of the reality and nature of\r\nproperty in invention or discovery. It can be seen at a glance in this\r\nstage of the matter that Mr. Hill now has that property absolutely in\r\nhis own possession, and no one has a right to demand it of him, nor\r\nrequest it, without paying him such a price as he may affix to his\r\nproperty. I have a plan which pleased him, and which I think, will\r\nsecure the object aimed at, to wit, ample remuneration to him, and in\r\nsuch a shape as to leave him the use of his powers the remainder of his\r\nlife (unlike my own case) for further research and scientific pursuits,\r\nwithout fear of fraud, of attacks on his character, and endless\r\nlitigation. More of this another time. I must now stop, simply remarking\r\non the strangeness of the circumstances of this discovery as contrasted\r\nwith Daguerre's discovery; the latter surrounded by every facility for\r\nexperiment in the metropolis of refinement and science, the former\r\nsurrounded by no facilities whatever for experiment, excepting such as\r\nwere transported by him at great trouble and comparative expense, with\r\nlimited pecuniary means, into the primeval forest, with scarcely an\r\nindividual to consult with except his wife, and literally surrounded by\r\nwild beasts--the deer, the bears, the wolves, the wild-cats, and the\r\npanthers too, still inhabiting the wild mountain forests that inclose\r\nthe village.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR BLUME, of Leyden, has been elected a member of the French\r\nAcademy, to fill a vacancy in the section of botany. Among the\r\ncandidates were Professor John Torrey, of New-York, and Professor Gray\r\nof Harvard College. Professor Blume presented on the occasion his\r\nsplendid new work on botany: a Flora, in four volumes, folio, of the\r\npeninsula of India, the islands of the Sonde, and of the Indian\r\nArchipelago; the title is _Rumphia_, the contents being collected from\r\nthe seven folios of the botanist Everard Rumph, published in the middle\r\nof the last century. Professor Blume resided many years in Batavia, and\r\nadded the results of his own scientific and extensive research\r\nthroughout Java and the Archipelago. On the 24th ult. M. de Juissen\r\nsubmitted to the Academy an interesting report on the work, in which he\r\nsays, \"A poisonous tree, the _Upas-Antiar_, has been the subject of\r\nnumerous fictions, by which it has acquired great celebrity. It has\r\ntherefore attracted the attention of many travellers, who have\r\ndissipated the stories, as Mr. Blume does, with piquant details.\" He\r\nexplains a part of the terrible reputation of the tree, by the fact that\r\nthe volcanic soil emits, on different spots, deleterious gases, which\r\nhave a fatal effect on animal life--an effect erroneously imputed to the\r\nadjacent trees. Their juice, indeed, possesses highly energetic\r\nproperties. The birds often take refuge on their elevated tops, without\r\nthe least injury. [A specimen of the Upas tree has been recently brought\r\nto the United States by an officer of the navy, and it is alleged that\r\nwhile it does not poison the atmosphere, its sap is quite as fatal to\r\nlife as its effluvia has been represented to be.] The natives poison\r\ntheir arms with the juice of another Upas, _Strychnos tieute_. Mr. Blume\r\nvisited a mangrove tree--_ficus India_--of gigantic dimensions and\r\nremote antiquity, which is regarded and preserved as a sort of religious\r\nmonument. The branches spread a shade over a vast area, and form\r\nthemselves for the parasite growth of a multitude of other plants on\r\ntheir surface. The professor obtained license to herborize on the top.\r\nHe collected thirty-seven species, without reckoning lichens and mosses,\r\nbut being restricted as to time, did not inspect half of the display.\r\nThe plants were fully developed, with rich foliage and graceful and\r\nbrilliant flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies' Summer Fashions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe changes for the season are not in general very striking. There is\r\nsaid to be an unusual prevalence of sombre colors, with artistically\r\nagreeing brighter ones. Striped silks, taffetas, and bareges, are all in\r\nvogue.\r\n\r\nFor BONNETS the materials employed are very numerous. Paille de riz,\r\nfine Florence straw, gauze, tulle, crape, and crepe lisse, are all\r\nfashionable; silk, also, but it is not much in request. The stripes are\r\nround, very open at the sides, but not standing out so much as they were\r\nlast season over the forehead; the crowns are also very low, and the\r\ncurtains full, and always short enough to be becoming. Among the most\r\nelegant rice straw bonnets are those lined with white tulle and\r\nornamented with tufts of violets and snowdrops, the exterior decorated\r\nwith a wreath of the same flowers. Others have exteriors trimmed with a\r\nlight panache, composed of fuschias, heliotropes, and sprigs of\r\neglantine, mingled with long blades of grass (this ornament droops over\r\nthe brim on one side), the interior trimmed with small tufts of fruit\r\nblossoms. Rice and Florence straw bonnets are trimmed with a petite\r\ncouronne of rose and white marabout tips, forming a tuft on each side;\r\nthe interior is lined with rose and white tulle bouillonnee, and tufts\r\nof narrow blonde intermingled with small tips of rose marabouts.\r\nBouquets of white roses and flowers of the double-blossomed peach are\r\nalso in great request for these bonnets. The majority of gauze, tulle,\r\ncrape, and crepe bonnets, are trimmed in a light style with flowers or\r\nmarabouts. French chip, trimmed with broad lace, promises to be\r\nconsiderably worn. Plain straw is always respectable, but it is less\r\nworn this season than heretofore.\r\n\r\nIn PROMENADE AND CARRIAGE DRESSES the redingote form is adopted in plain\r\nsilks of a quiet kind, or striped, that are not showy, for the\r\npromenade. Redingotes for carriage dress are much trimmed, some with\r\npassementerie, lace, or ribbon; lace is much in vogue; ribbon is more\r\nso; it admits of a great variety of forms; one of the most novel is a\r\ncockle-shell wreath arranged in two rows of festoons up each side of\r\nthe front of the dress. Fashionable as flounces are for in-door and\r\ncarriage-dress, they are, comparatively speaking, little seen in the\r\npromenade; the extreme width of the skirts, which does not seem at all\r\nlikely to diminish, accounts in some degree for this.\r\n\r\nIn EVENING DRESSES silks predominate for robes, but always the new\r\nspring silks, the heavy ones being quite laid aside; the bodies are cut\r\nlow, but moderately so; they are of the Louis Quinze, and la Grecque\r\nstyles; the latter have the draperies attached by knots of ribbon, or\r\nbrilliant ornaments, as the dress is rich or otherwise. A deep fall of\r\nlace, placed under the last drapery, is looped with it in the centre,\r\nand also on the shoulder; it turns round the back, and falls, _en\r\nmancheron_, over the sleeve, which is always very short if the corsage\r\nis _a la Grecque_. The Louis Quinze has the lace disposed in a full fall\r\n_a l'enfant_; or also a berthe, either round or pointed; the latter is\r\n_en coeur_, very voluminous at the top, but with the lace narrowing to\r\na point at the waist; the skirts, if trimmed, are flounced, but many are\r\nmade without garnitures. Several white dresses, trimmed, with black\r\nlace, have lately appeared; this fashion gains ground, but it is not yet\r\na decided one.\r\n\r\nThe majority of evening dresses combine richness of effect with the\r\nlight textures adapted to summer, ball, and dinner costume. Dresses of\r\nwhite crape have been made with double jupes, or with three flounces,\r\nthe latter edged with pink-ruches, or with four or five rows of narrow\r\nribbon. The berthe is of the shawl form, and should be trimmed to\r\ncorrespond with the flounces, either with ruches or rows of ribbon. A\r\nbouquet of flowers may be worn in the centre of the corsage. New barege\r\ndresses are made with three flounces, scalloped, and trimmed at the edge\r\nwith a quilling of ribbon. The corsages of some of these dresses are\r\nmade close to the figure, and with basques; the latter, like the\r\nflounces, having a scalloped or vandyked edge, trimmed with a quilling\r\nof ribbon. Other dresses of the same material have drawn corsagas, and\r\nthen the top flounce is set on at the lower end of the waist, and by\r\nthat means serves as a basque. The flounce may be open or not in front.\r\nSleeves are almost universally worn open at the ends, whether the dress\r\nbe plain or of a superior kind. The under-sleeves worn in dressed\r\ncostume are also open at the ends, in the pagoda form, and are trimmed\r\nwith fontanges or frills of lace, or richly worked muslin. Dresses\r\nintended for walking or neglige costume have muslin under-sleeves\r\nfastened at the wrist with turned-up cuffs. For sleeves reaching to the\r\nwrist, and not open at the ends, cuffs of various patterns are worn.\r\nThose generally adopted have two or three buillonnees, with a row of\r\nlace between each; or a single buillonnee, edged by a lace frill,\r\nfalling over the hand.\r\n\r\nMANTELETS are likely to supersede pardessus in a great degree; there is\r\na variety in their forms, and they are made of silk, muslin, and lace.\r\nThe Medicis, the Violetta, and the Victoria, are the most remarkable of\r\nthe new shapes. The first is of deep violet taffetas, small, and the\r\nhind part of an oval form--the garniture composed of three flounces, cut\r\nin dents, and encircled with a deep fringe, surmounted by a light\r\nembroidery; a narrow flounce in the same style goes round the throat.\r\nBeing set on full it has something of a ruff.\r\n\r\nBLACK VELVET COLLARS date from the earliest days of Louis XV., for the\r\n_beau monde_, who adopted them from the peasantry, with whom they had\r\nbeen long in vogue. They are now revived, and likely to become general.\r\nThe collar is a black velvet ribbon, never very broad, crossed on the\r\nthroat, and fastened by an ornament of jewelry or gold, according to the\r\nfancy or the fortune of the wearer; the ends descend upon the neck, and\r\nsome are bordered with seed pearl or diamond fringe. These collars can\r\nbe becoming only to blonde belles.\r\n\r\nThere is no probability of any radical change in the costume of women of\r\nthe better classes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]",
