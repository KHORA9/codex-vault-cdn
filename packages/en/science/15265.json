The red waters of the swamp grew sinister and sullen. The\r\ntall pines lost their slimness and stood in wide blurred blotches all\r\nacross the way, and a great shadowy bird arose, wheeled and melted,\r\nmurmuring, into the black-green sky.\r\n\r\nThe boy wearily dropped his heavy bundle and stood still, listening as\r\nthe voice of crickets split the shadows and made the silence audible. A\r\ntear wandered down his brown cheek. They were at supper now, he\r\nwhispered--the father and old mother, away back yonder beyond the night.\r\nThey were far away; they would never be as near as once they had been,\r\nfor he had stepped into the world. And the cat and Old Billy--ah, but\r\nthe world was a lonely thing, so wide and tall and empty! And so bare,\r\nso bitter bare! Somehow he had never dreamed of the world as lonely\r\nbefore; he had fared forth to beckoning hands and luring, and to the\r\neager hum of human voices, as of some great, swelling music.\r\n\r\nYet now he was alone; the empty night was closing all about him here in\r\na strange land, and he was afraid. The bundle with his earthly treasure\r\nhad hung heavy and heavier on his shoulder; his little horde of money\r\nwas tightly wadded in his sock, and the school lay hidden somewhere far\r\naway in the shadows. He wondered how far it was; he looked and harkened,\r\nstarting at his own heartbeats, and fearing more and more the long dark\r\nfingers of the night.\r\n\r\nThen of a sudden up from the darkness came music. It was human music,\r\nbut of a wildness and a weirdness that startled the boy as it fluttered\r\nand danced across the dull red waters of the swamp. He hesitated, then\r\nimpelled by some strange power, left the highway and slipped into the\r\nforest of the swamp, shrinking, yet following the song hungrily and half\r\nforgetting his fear. A harsher, shriller note struck in as of many and\r\nruder voices; but above it flew the first sweet music, birdlike,\r\nabandoned, and the boy crept closer.\r\n\r\nThe cabin crouched ragged and black at the edge of black waters. An old\r\nchimney leaned drunkenly against it, raging with fire and smoke, while\r\nthrough the chinks winked red gleams of warmth and wild cheer. With a\r\nrevel of shouting and noise, the music suddenly ceased. Hoarse staccato\r\ncries and peals of laughter shook the old hut, and as the boy stood\r\nthere peering through the black trees, abruptly the door flew open and a\r\nflood of light illumined the wood.\r\n\r\nAmid this mighty halo, as on clouds of flame, a girl was dancing. She\r\nwas black, and lithe, and tall, and willowy. Her garments twined and\r\nflew around the delicate moulding of her dark, young, half-naked limbs.\r\nA heavy mass of hair clung motionless to her wide forehead. Her arms\r\ntwirled and flickered, and body and soul seemed quivering and whirring\r\nin the poetry of her motion.\r\n\r\nAs she danced she sang. He heard her voice as before, fluttering like a\r\nbird's in the full sweetness of her utter music. It was no tune nor\r\nmelody, it was just formless, boundless music. The boy forgot himself\r\nand all the world besides. All his darkness was sudden light; dazzled he\r\ncrept forward, bewildered, fascinated, until with one last wild whirl\r\nthe elf-girl paused. The crimson light fell full upon the warm and\r\nvelvet bronze of her face--her midnight eyes were aglow, her full purple\r\nlips apart, her half hid bosom panting, and all the music dead.\r\nInvoluntarily the boy gave a gasping cry and awoke to swamp and night\r\nand fire, while a white face, drawn, red-eyed, peered outward from some\r\nhidden throng within the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" a harsh voice cried.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" \"Who is it?\" and pale crowding faces blurred the light.\r\n\r\nThe boy wheeled blindly and fled in terror stumbling through the swamp,\r\nhearing strange sounds and feeling stealthy creeping hands and arms and\r\nwhispering voices. On he toiled in mad haste, struggling toward the road\r\nand losing it until finally beneath the shadows of a mighty oak he sank\r\nexhausted. There he lay a while trembling and at last drifted into\r\ndreamless sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was morning when he awoke and threw a startled glance upward to the\r\ntwisted branches of the oak that bent above, sifting down sunshine on\r\nhis brown face and close curled hair. Slowly he remembered the\r\nloneliness, the fear and wild running through the dark. He laughed in\r\nthe bold courage of day and stretched himself.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he bethought him again of that vision of the night--the\r\nwaving arms and flying limbs of the girl, and her great black eyes\r\nlooking into the night and calling him. He could hear her now, and hear\r\nthat wondrous savage music. Had it been real? Had he dreamed? Or had it\r\nbeen some witch-vision of the night, come to tempt and lure him to his\r\nundoing? Where was that black and flaming cabin? Where was the girl--the\r\nsoul that had called him? _She_ must have been real; she had to live and\r\ndance and sing; he must again look into the mystery of her great eyes.\r\nAnd he sat up in sudden determination, and, lo! gazed straight into the\r\nvery eyes of his dreaming.\r\n\r\nShe sat not four feet from him, leaning against the great tree, her\r\neyes now languorously abstracted, now alert and quizzical with mischief.\r\nShe seemed but half-clothed, and her warm, dark flesh peeped furtively\r\nthrough the rent gown; her thick, crisp hair was frowsy and rumpled, and\r\nthe long curves of her bare young arms gleamed in the morning sunshine,\r\nglowing with vigor and life. A little mocking smile came and sat upon\r\nher lips.\r\n\r\n\"What you run for?\" she asked, with dancing mischief in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Because--\" he hesitated, and his cheeks grew hot.\r\n\r\n\"I knows,\" she said, with impish glee, laughing low music.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" he challenged, sturdily.\r\n\r\n\"You was a-feared.\"\r\n\r\nHe bridled. \"Well, I reckon you'd be a-feared if you was caught out in\r\nthe black dark all alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" she scoffed and hugged her knees. \"Pooh! I've stayed out all\r\nalone heaps o' nights.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with a curious awe.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe you,\" he asserted; but she tossed her head and her eyes\r\ngrew scornful.\r\n\r\n\"Who's a-feared of the dark? I love night.\" Her eyes grew soft.\r\n\r\nHe watched her silently, till, waking from her daydream, she abruptly\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"Where you from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Georgia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's that?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in surprise, but she seemed matter-of-fact.\r\n\r\n\"It's away over yonder,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Behind where the sun comes up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it ain't so far,\" she declared. \"I knows where the sun rises, and\r\nI knows where it sets.\" She looked up at its gleaming splendor glinting\r\nthrough the leaves, and, noting its height, announced abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"I'se hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"So'm I,\" answered the boy, fumbling at his bundle; and then, timidly:\r\n\"Will you eat with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, and watched him with eager eyes.\r\n\r\nUntying the strips of cloth, he opened his box, and disclosed chicken\r\nand biscuits, ham and corn-bread. She clapped her hands in glee.\r\n\r\n\"Is there any water near?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nWithout a word, she bounded up and flitted off like a brown bird,\r\ngleaming dull-golden in the sun, glancing in and out among the trees,\r\ntill she paused above a tiny black pool, and then came tripping and\r\nswaying back with hands held cupwise and dripping with cool water.\r\n\r\n\"Drink,\" she cried. Obediently he bent over the little hands that seemed\r\nso soft and thin. He took a deep draught; and then to drain the last\r\ndrop, his hands touched hers and the shock of flesh first meeting flesh\r\nstartled them both, while the water rained through. A moment their eyes\r\nlooked deep into each other's--a timid, startled gleam in hers; a wonder\r\nin his. Then she said dreamily:\r\n\r\n\"We'se known us all our lives, and--before, ain't we?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Ye--es--I reckon,\" he slowly returned. And then, brightening, he asked\r\ngayly: \"And we'll be friends always, won't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said at last, slowly and solemnly, and another brief moment\r\nthey stood still.\r\n\r\nThen the mischief danced in her eyes, and a song bubbled on her lips.\r\nShe hopped to the tree.\r\n\r\n\"Come--eat!\" she cried. And they nestled together amid the big black\r\nroots of the oak, laughing and talking while they ate.\r\n\r\n\"What's over there?\" he asked pointing northward.\r\n\r\n\"Cresswell's big house.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yonder to the west?\"\r\n\r\n\"The school.\"\r\n\r\nHe started joyfully.\r\n\r\n\"The school! What school?\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Miss' School.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith's school?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" The tone was disdainful.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's where I'm going. I was a-feared it was a long way off; I\r\nmust have passed it in the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate it!\" cried the girl, her lips tense.\r\n\r\n\"But I'll be so near,\" he explained. \"And why do you hate it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--you'll be near,\" she admitted; \"that'll be nice; but--\" she\r\nglanced westward, and the fierce look faded. Soft joy crept to her face\r\nagain, and she sat once more dreaming.\r\n\r\n\"Yon way's nicest,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's there?\"\r\n\r\n\"The swamp,\" she said mysteriously.\r\n\r\n\"And what's beyond the swamp?\"\r\n\r\nShe crouched beside him and whispered in eager, tense tones: \"Dreams!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Dreams?\" vaguely--\"dreams? Why, dreams ain't--nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes they is!\" she insisted, her eyes flaming in misty radiance as\r\nshe sat staring beyond the shadows of the swamp. \"Yes they is! There\r\nain't nothing but dreams--that is, nothing much.\r\n\r\n\"And over yonder behind the swamps is great fields full of dreams, piled\r\nhigh and burning; and right amongst them the sun, when he's tired o'\r\nnight, whispers and drops red things, 'cept when devils make 'em black.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy stared at her; he knew not whether to jeer or wonder.\r\n\r\n\"How you know?\" he asked at last, skeptically.\r\n\r\n\"Promise you won't tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered.\r\n\r\nShe cuddled into a little heap, nursing her knees, and answered slowly.\r\n\r\n\"I goes there sometimes. I creeps in 'mongst the dreams; they hangs\r\nthere like big flowers, dripping dew and sugar and blood--red, red\r\nblood. And there's little fairies there that hop about and sing, and\r\ndevils--great, ugly devils that grabs at you and roasts and eats you if\r\nthey gits you; but they don't git me. Some devils is big and white, like\r\nha'nts; some is long and shiny, like creepy, slippery snakes; and some\r\nis little and broad and black, and they yells--\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was listening in incredulous curiosity, half minded to laugh,\r\nhalf minded to edge away from the black-red radiance of yonder dusky\r\nswamp. He glanced furtively backward, and his heart gave a great bound.\r\n\r\n\"Some is little and broad and black, and they yells--\" chanted the girl.\r\nAnd as she chanted, deep, harsh tones came booming through the forest:\r\n\r\n\"_Zo-ra! Zo-ra!_ O--o--oh, Zora!\"\r\n\r\nHe saw far behind him, toward the shadows of the swamp, an old\r\nwoman--short, broad, black and wrinkled, with fangs and pendulous lips\r\nand red, wicked eyes. His heart bounded in sudden fear; he wheeled\r\ntoward the girl, and caught only the uncertain flash of her\r\ngarments--the wood was silent, and he was alone.\r\n\r\nHe arose, startled, quickly gathered his bundle, and looked around him.\r\nThe sun was strong and high, the morning fresh and vigorous. Stamping\r\none foot angrily, he strode jauntily out of the wood toward the big\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nBut ever and anon he glanced curiously back. Had he seen a haunt? Or was\r\nthe elf-girl real? And then he thought of her words:\r\n\r\n\"We'se known us all our lives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Two_\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nDay was breaking above the white buildings of the Negro school and\r\nthrowing long, low lines of gold in at Miss Sarah Smith's front window.\r\nShe lay in the stupor of her last morning nap, after a night of\r\nharrowing worry. Then, even as she partially awoke, she lay still with\r\nclosed eyes, feeling the shadow of some great burden, yet daring not to\r\nrouse herself and recall its exact form; slowly again she drifted toward\r\nunconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\"_Bang! bang! bang!_\" hard knuckles were beating upon the door below.\r\n\r\nShe heard drowsily, and dreamed that it was the nailing up of all her\r\ndoors; but she did not care much, and but feebly warded the blows away,\r\nfor she was very tired.\r\n\r\n\"_Bang! bang! bang!_\" persisted the hard knuckles.\r\n\r\nShe started up, and her eye fell upon a letter lying on her bureau. Back\r\nshe sank with a sigh, and lay staring at the ceiling--a gaunt, flat,\r\nsad-eyed creature, with wisps of gray hair half-covering her baldness,\r\nand a face furrowed with care and gathering years.\r\n\r\nIt was thirty years ago this day, she recalled, since she first came to\r\nthis broad land of shade and shine in Alabama to teach black folks.\r\n\r\nIt had been a hard beginning with suspicion and squalor around; with\r\npoverty within and without the first white walls of the new school home.\r\nYet somehow the struggle then with all its helplessness and\r\ndisappointment had not seemed so bitter as today: then failure meant but\r\nlittle, now it seemed to mean everything; then it meant disappointment\r\nto a score of ragged urchins, now it meant two hundred boys and girls,\r\nthe spirits of a thousand gone before and the hopes of thousands to\r\ncome. In her imagination the significance of these half dozen gleaming\r\nbuildings perched aloft seemed portentous--big with the destiny not\r\nsimply of a county and a State, but of a race--a nation--a world. It was\r\nGod's own cause, and yet--\r\n\r\n\"_Bang! bang! bang!_\" again went the hard knuckles down there at the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith slowly arose, shivering a bit and wondering who could\r\npossibly be rapping at that time in the morning. She sniffed the\r\nchilling air and was sure she caught some lingering perfume from Mrs.\r\nVanderpool's gown. She had brought this rich and rare-apparelled lady up\r\nhere yesterday, because it was more private, and here she had poured\r\nforth her needs. She had talked long and in deadly earnest. She had not\r\nspoken of the endowment for which she had hoped so desperately during a\r\nquarter of a century--no, only for the five thousand dollars to buy the\r\nlong needed new land. It was so little--so little beside what this woman\r\nsquandered--\r\n\r\nThe insistent knocking was repeated louder than before.\r\n\r\n\"Sakes alive,\" cried Miss Smith, throwing a shawl about her and leaning\r\nout the window. \"Who is it, and what do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, ma'am. I've come to school,\" answered a tall black boy with a\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\n\"Well, why don't you go to the office?\" Then she saw his face and\r\nhesitated. She felt again the old motherly instinct to be the first to\r\nwelcome the new pupil; a luxury which, in later years, the endless push\r\nof details had denied her.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" she cried shortly, and began to dress.\r\n\r\nA new boy, she mused. Yes, every day they straggled in; every day came\r\nthe call for more, more--this great, growing thirst to know--to do--to\r\nbe. And yet that woman had sat right here, aloof, imperturbable,\r\nlistening only courteously. When Miss Smith finished, she had paused\r\nand, flicking her glove,--\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Smith,\" she said softly, with a tone that just escaped a\r\ndrawl--\"My dear Miss Smith, your work is interesting and your\r\nfaith--marvellous; but, frankly, I cannot make myself believe in it. You\r\nare trying to treat these funny little monkeys just as you would your\r\nown children--or even mine. It's quite heroic, of course, but it's sheer\r\nmadness, and I do not feel I ought to encourage it. I would not mind a\r\nthousand or so to train a good cook for the Cresswells, or a clean and\r\nfaithful maid for myself--for Helene has faults--or indeed deft and\r\ntractable laboring-folk for any one; but I'm quite through trying to\r\nturn natural servants into masters of me and mine. I--hope I'm not too\r\nblunt; I hope I make myself clear. You know, statistics show--\"\r\n\r\n\"Drat statistics!\" Miss Smith had flashed impatiently. \"These are\r\nfolks.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool smiled indulgently. \"To be sure,\" she murmured, \"but\r\nwhat sort of folks?\"\r\n\r\n\"God's sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well--\"\r\n\r\nBut Miss Smith had the bit in her teeth and could not have stopped. She\r\nwas paying high for the privilege of talking, but it had to be said.\r\n\r\n\"God's sort, Mrs. Vanderpool--not the sort that think of the world as\r\narranged for their exclusive benefit and comfort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do want to count--\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith bent forward--not a beautiful pose, but earnest.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to count, and I want to count, too; but I don't want us to\r\nbe the only ones that count. I want to live in a world where every soul\r\ncounts--white, black, and yellow--all. _That's_ what I'm teaching these\r\nchildren here--to count, and not to be like dumb, driven cattle. If you\r\ndon't believe in this, of course you cannot help us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your spirit is admirable, Miss Smith,\" she had said very softly; \"I\r\nonly wish I could feel as you do. Good-afternoon,\" and she had rustled\r\ngently down the narrow stairs, leaving an all but imperceptible\r\nsuggestion of perfume. Miss Smith could smell it yet as she went down\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast bell jangled. \"Five thousand dollars,\" she kept repeating\r\nto herself, greeting the teachers absently--\"five thousand dollars.\" And\r\nthen on the porch she was suddenly aware of the awaiting boy. She eyed\r\nhim critically: black, fifteen, country-bred, strong, clear-eyed.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" she asked in that brusque manner wherewith her natural timidity\r\nwas wont to mask her kindness. \"Well, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've come to school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph--we can't teach boys for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy straightened. \"I can pay my way,\" he returned.\r\n\r\n\"You mean you can pay what we ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes. Ain't that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. The rest is gathered from the crumbs of Dives' table.\"\r\n\r\nThen he saw the twinkle in her eyes. She laid her hand gently upon his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't hurry you'll be late to breakfast,\" she said with an air\r\nof confidence. \"See those boys over there? Follow them, and at noon come\r\nto the office--wait! What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Blessed Alwyn,\" he answered, and the passing teachers smiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Three_\r\n\r\nMISS MARY TAYLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Taylor did not take a college course for the purpose of\r\nteaching Negroes. Not that she objected to Negroes as human\r\nbeings--quite the contrary. In the debate between the senior societies\r\nher defence of the Fifteenth Amendment had been not only a notable bit\r\nof reasoning, but delivered with real enthusiasm. Nevertheless, when the\r\nend of the summer came and the only opening facing her was the teaching\r\nof children at Miss Smith's experiment in the Alabama swamps, it must be\r\nfrankly confessed that Miss Taylor was disappointed.\r\n\r\nHer dream had been a post-graduate course at Bryn Mawr; but that was out\r\nof the question until money was earned. She had pictured herself earning\r\nthis by teaching one or two of her \"specialties\" in some private school\r\nnear New York or Boston, or even in a Western college. The South she had\r\nnot thought of seriously; and yet, knowing of its delightful\r\nhospitality and mild climate, she was not averse to Charleston or New\r\nOrleans. But from the offer that came to teach Negroes--country Negroes,\r\nand little ones at that--she shrank, and, indeed, probably would have\r\nrefused it out of hand had it not been for her queer brother, John. John\r\nTaylor, who had supported her through college, was interested in cotton.\r\nHaving certain schemes in mind, he had been struck by the fact that the\r\nSmith School was in the midst of the Alabama cotton-belt.\r\n\r\n\"Better go,\" he had counselled, sententiously. \"Might learn something\r\nuseful down there.\"\r\n\r\nShe had been not a little dismayed by the outlook, and had protested\r\nagainst his blunt insistence.\r\n\r\n\"But, John, there's no society--just elementary work--\"\r\n\r\nJohn had met this objection with, \"Humph!\" as he left for his office.\r\nNext day he had returned to the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Been looking up Tooms County. Find some Cresswells there--big\r\nplantations--rated at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Some\r\nothers, too; big cotton county.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to know, John, if I teach Negroes I'll scarcely see much of\r\npeople in my own class.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Butt in. Show off. Give 'em your Greek--and study Cotton. At\r\nany rate, I say go.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, howsoever reluctantly, she had gone.\r\n\r\nThe trial was all she had anticipated, and possibly a bit more. She was\r\na pretty young woman of twenty-three, fair and rather daintily moulded.\r\nIn favorable surroundings, she would have been an aristocrat and an\r\nepicure. Here she was teaching dirty children, and the smell of confused\r\nodors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable.\r\n\r\nThen there was the fact of their color: it was a fact so insistent, so\r\nfatal she almost said at times, that she could not escape it.\r\nTheoretically she had always treated it with disdainful ease.\r\n\r\n\"What's the mere color of a human soul's skin,\" she had cried to a\r\nWellesley audience and the audience had applauded with enthusiasm. But\r\nhere in Alabama, brought closely and intimately in touch with these dark\r\nskinned children, their color struck her at first with a sort of\r\nterror--it seemed ominous and forbidding. She found herself shrinking\r\naway and gripping herself lest they should perceive. She could not help\r\nbut think that in most other things they were as different from her as\r\nin color. She groped for new ways to teach colored brains and marshal\r\ncolored thoughts and the result was puzzling both to teacher and\r\nstudent. With the other teachers she had little commerce. They were in\r\nno sense her sort of folk. Miss Smith represented the older New England\r\nof her parents--honest, inscrutable, determined, with a conscience which\r\nshe worshipped, and utterly unselfish. She appealed to Miss Taylor's\r\nruddier and daintier vision but dimly and distantly as some memory of\r\nthe past. The other teachers were indistinct personalities, always very\r\nbusy and very tired, and talking \"school-room\" with their meals. Miss\r\nTaylor was soon starving for human companionship, for the lighter\r\ntouches of life and some of its warmth and laughter. She wanted a glance\r\nof the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and\r\nreforms. She felt out of the world, shut in and mentally anæmic; great\r\nas the \"Negro Problem\" might be as a world problem, it looked sordid and\r\nsmall at close range. So for the hundredth time she was thinking today,\r\nas she walked alone up the lane back of the barn, and then slowly down\r\nthrough the bottoms. She paused a moment and nodded to the two boys at\r\nwork in a young cotton field.\r\n\r\n\"Cotton!\"\r\n\r\nShe paused. She remembered with what interest she had always read of\r\nthis little thread of the world. She had almost forgotten that it was\r\nhere within touch and sight. For a moment something of the vision of\r\nCotton was mirrored in her mind. The glimmering sea of delicate leaves\r\nwhispered and murmured before her, stretching away to the Northward.\r\nShe remembered that beyond this little world it stretched on and on--how\r\nfar she did not know--but on and on in a great trembling sea, and the\r\nfoam of its mighty waters would one time flood the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nShe glimpsed all this with parted lips, and then sighed impatiently.\r\nThere might be a bit of poetry here and there, but most of this place\r\nwas such desperate prose.\r\n\r\nShe glanced absently at the boys.\r\n\r\nOne was Bles Alwyn, a tall black lad. (Bles, she mused,--now who would\r\nthink of naming a boy \"Blessed,\" save these incomprehensible creatures!)\r\nHer regard shifted to the green stalks and leaves again, and she started\r\nto move away. Then her New England conscience stepped in. She ought not\r\nto pass these students without a word of encouragement or instruction.\r\n\r\n\"Cotton is a wonderful thing, is it not, boys?\" she said rather primly.\r\nThe boys touched their hats and murmured something indistinctly. Miss\r\nTaylor did not know much about cotton, but at least one more remark\r\nseemed called for.\r\n\r\n\"How long before the stalks will be ready to cut?\" she asked carelessly.\r\nThe farther boy coughed and Bles raised his eyes and looked at her; then\r\nafter a pause he answered slowly. (Oh! these people were so slow--now a\r\nNew England boy would have answered and asked a half-dozen questions in\r\nthe time.)\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't know,\" he faltered.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know! Well, of all things!\" inwardly commented Miss\r\nTaylor--\"literally born in cotton, and--Oh, well,\" as much as to ask,\r\n\"What's the use?\" She turned again to go.\r\n\r\n\"What is planted over there?\" she asked, although she really didn't\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n\"Goobers,\" answered the smaller boy.\r\n\r\n\"Goobers?\" uncomprehendingly.\r\n\r\n\"Peanuts,\" Bles specified.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" murmured Miss Taylor. \"I see there are none on the vines yet. I\r\nsuppose, though, it's too early for them.\"\r\n\r\nThen came the explosion. The smaller boy just snorted with irrepressible\r\nlaughter and bolted across the fields. And Bles--was Miss Taylor\r\ndeceived?--or was he chuckling? She reddened, drew herself up, and then,\r\ndropping her primness, rippled with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Bles?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with twinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, Miss Taylor, it's like this: farming don't seem to be\r\nyour specialty.\"\r\n\r\nThe word was often on Miss Taylor's lips, and she recognized it. Despite\r\nherself she smiled again.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it isn't--I don't know anything about farming. But what did\r\nI say so funny?\"\r\n\r\nBles was now laughing outright.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Miss Taylor! I declare! Goobers don't grow on the tops of vines,\r\nbut underground on the roots--like yams.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and we--we don't pick cotton stalks except for kindling.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have been thinking of hemp. But tell me more about cotton.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes lighted, for cotton was to him a very real and beautiful thing,\r\nand a life-long companion, yet not one whose friendship had been\r\ncoarsened and killed by heavy toil. He leaned against his hoe and talked\r\nhalf dreamily--where had he learned so well that dream-talk?\r\n\r\n\"We turn up the earth and sow it soon after Christmas. Then pretty soon\r\nthere comes a sort of greenness on the black land and it swells and\r\ngrows and, and--shivers. Then stalks shoot up with three or four leaves.\r\nThat's the way it is now, see? After that we chop out the weak stalks,\r\nand the strong ones grow tall and dark, till I think it must be like the\r\nocean--all green and billowy; then come little flecks here and there\r\nand the sea is all filled with flowers--flowers like little bells, blue\r\nand purple and white.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that must be beautiful,\" sighed Miss Taylor, wistfully, sinking to\r\nthe ground and clasping her hands about her knees.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am. But it's prettiest when the bolls come and swell and burst,\r\nand the cotton covers the field like foam, all misty--\"\r\n\r\nShe bent wondering over the pale plants. The poetry of the thing began\r\nto sing within her, awakening her unpoetic imagination, and she\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n\"The Golden Fleece--it's the Silver Fleece!\"\r\n\r\nHe harkened.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Have you never heard of the Golden Fleece, Bles?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am,\" he said eagerly; then glancing up toward the Cresswell\r\nfields, he saw two white men watching them. He grasped his hoe and\r\nstarted briskly to work.\r\n\r\n\"Some time you'll tell me, please, won't you?\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at her watch in surprise and arose hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with pleasure,\" she said moving away--at first very fast, and then\r\nmore and more slowly up the lane, with a puzzled look on her face.\r\n\r\nShe began to realize that in this pleasant little chat the fact of the\r\nboy's color had quite escaped her; and what especially puzzled her was\r\nthat this had not happened before. She had been here four months, and\r\nyet every moment up to now she seemed to have been vividly, almost\r\npainfully conscious, that she was a white woman talking to black folk.\r\nNow, for one little half-hour she had been a woman talking to a boy--no,\r\nnot even that: she had been talking--just talking; there were no persons\r\nin the conversation, just things--one thing: Cotton.\r\n\r\nShe started thinking of cotton--but at once she pulled herself back to\r\nthe other aspect. Always before she had been veiled from these folk: who\r\nhad put the veil there? Had she herself hung it before her soul, or had\r\nthey hidden timidly behind its other side? Or was it simply a brute\r\nfact, regardless of both of them?\r\n\r\nThe longer she thought, the more bewildered she grew. There seemed no\r\nanalogy that she knew. Here was a unique thing, and she climbed to her\r\nbedroom and stared at the stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Four_\r\n\r\nTOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor had written to his sister. He wanted information, very\r\ndefinite information, about Tooms County cotton; about its stores, its\r\npeople--especially its people. He propounded a dozen questions, sharp,\r\nsearching questions, and he wanted the answers tomorrow. Impossible!\r\nthought Miss Taylor. He had calculated on her getting this letter\r\nyesterday, forgetting that their mail was fetched once a day from the\r\ntown, four miles away. Then, too, she did not know all these matters and\r\nknew no one who did. Did John think she had nothing else to do? And\r\nsighing at the thought of to-morrow's drudgery, she determined to\r\nconsult Miss Smith in the morning.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith suggested a drive to town--Bles could take her in the\r\ntop-buggy after school--and she could consult some of the merchants and\r\nbusiness men. She could then write her letter and mail it there; it\r\nwould be but a day or so late getting to New York.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Miss Smith drily, slowly folding her napkin, \"of\r\ncourse, the only people here are the Cresswells.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Miss Taylor invitingly. There was an allurement about\r\nthis all-pervasive name; it held her by a growing fascination and she\r\nwas anxious for the older woman to amplify. Miss Smith, however,\r\nremained provokingly silent, so Miss Taylor essayed further.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of people are the Cresswells?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"The old man's a fool; the young one a rascal; the girl a ninny,\" was\r\nMiss Smith's succinct and acid classification of the county's first\r\nfamily; adding, as she rose, \"but they own us body and soul.\" She\r\nhurried out of the dining-room without further remark. Miss Smith was\r\nmore patient with black folk than with white.\r\n\r\nThe sun was hanging just above the tallest trees of the swamp when Miss\r\nTaylor, weary with the day's work, climbed into the buggy beside Bles.\r\nThey wheeled comfortably down the road, leaving the sombre swamp, with\r\nits black-green, to the right, and heading toward the golden-green of\r\nwaving cotton fields. Miss Taylor lay back, listlessly, and drank the\r\nsoft warm air of the languorous Spring. She thought of the golden sheen\r\nof the cotton, and the cold March winds of New England; of her brother\r\nwho apparently noted nothing of leaves and winds and seasons; and of the\r\nmighty Cresswells whom Miss Smith so evidently disliked. Suddenly she\r\nbecame aware of her long silence and the silence of the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Bles,\" she began didactically, \"where are you from?\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced across at her and answered shortly:\r\n\r\n\"Georgia, ma'am,\" and was silent.\r\n\r\nThe girl tried again.\r\n\r\n\"Georgia is a large State,\"--tentatively.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going back there when you finish?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you ought to--and work for your people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, puzzled, and looked about. The old horse jogged lazily on,\r\nand Bles switched him unavailingly. Somehow she had missed the way\r\ntoday. The Veil hung thick, sombre, impenetrable. Well, she had done her\r\nduty, and slowly she nestled back and watched the far-off green and\r\ngolden radiance of the cotton.\r\n\r\n\"Bles,\" she said impulsively, \"shall I tell you of the Golden Fleece?\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, please,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe settled herself almost luxuriously, and began the story of Jason and\r\nthe Argonauts.\r\n\r\nThe boy remained silent. And when she had finished, he still sat silent,\r\nelbow on knee, absently flicking the jogging horse and staring ahead at\r\nthe horizon. She looked at him doubtfully with some disappointment that\r\nhis hearing had apparently shared so little of the joy of her telling;\r\nand, too, there was mingled a vague sense of having lowered herself to\r\ntoo familiar fellowship with this--this boy. She straightened herself\r\ninstinctively and thought of some remark that would restore proper\r\nrelations. She had not found it before he said, slowly:\r\n\r\n\"All yon is Jason's.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" she asked, puzzled.\r\n\r\nHe pointed with one sweep of his long arm to the quivering mass of\r\ngreen-gold foliage that swept from swamp to horizon.\r\n\r\n\"All yon golden fleece is Jason's now,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was--Cresswell's,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I mean.\"\r\n\r\nShe suddenly understood that the story had sunk deeply.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear you say that,\" she said methodically, \"for Jason was\r\na brave adventurer--\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought he was a thief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well--those were other times.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Cresswells are thieves now.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor answered sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Bles, I am ashamed to hear you talk so of your neighbors simply because\r\nthey are white.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bles continued.\r\n\r\n\"This is the Black Sea,\" he said, pointing to the dull cabins that\r\ncrouched here and there upon the earth, with the dark twinkling of their\r\nblack folk darting out to see the strangers ride by.\r\n\r\nDespite herself Miss Taylor caught the allegory and half whispered, \"Lo!\r\nthe King himself!\" as a black man almost rose from the tangled earth at\r\ntheir side. He was tall and thin and sombre-hued, with a carven face and\r\nthick gray hair.\r\n\r\n\"Your servant, mistress,\" he said, with a sweeping bow as he strode\r\ntoward the swamp. Miss Taylor stopped him, for he looked interesting,\r\nand might answer some of her brother's questions. He turned back and\r\nstood regarding her with sorrowful eyes and ugly mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Do you live about here?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'se lived here a hundred years,\" he answered. She did not believe it;\r\nhe might be seventy, eighty, or even ninety--indeed, there was about him\r\nthat indefinable sense of age--some shadow of endless living; but a\r\nhundred seemed absurd.\r\n\r\n\"You know the people pretty well, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knows dem all. I knows most of 'em better dan dey knows demselves. I\r\nknows a heap of tings in dis world and in de next.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a great cotton country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dey don't raise no cotton now to what dey used to when old Gen'rel\r\nCresswell fust come from Carolina; den it was a bale and a half to the\r\nacre on stalks dat looked like young brushwood. Dat was cotton.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know the Cresswells, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Know dem? I knowed dem afore dey was born.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are--wealthy people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dey rolls in money and dey'se quality, too. No shoddy upstarts dem,\r\nbut born to purple, lady, born to purple. Old Gen'ral Cresswell had\r\nniggers and acres no end back dere in Carolina. He brung a part of dem\r\nhere and here his son, de father of dis Colonel Cresswell, was born. De\r\nson--I knowed him well--he had a tousand niggers and ten tousand acres\r\nafore de war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they kind to their slaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yaas, yaas, ma'am, dey was careful of de're niggers and wouldn't\r\nlet de drivers whip 'em much.\"\r\n\r\n\"And these Cresswells today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dey're quality--high-blooded folks--dey'se lost some land and\r\nniggers, but, lordy, nuttin' can buy de Cresswells, dey naturally owns\r\nde world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they honest and kind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yaas, ma'am--dey'se good white folks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good white folk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yaas, ma'am--course you knows white folks will be white\r\nfolks--white folks will be white folks. Your servant, ma'am.\" And the\r\nswamp swallowed him.\r\n\r\nThe boy's eyes followed him as he whipped up the horse.\r\n\r\n\"He's going to Elspeth's,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"We just call him Old Pappy--he's a preacher, and some folks say a\r\nconjure man, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is Elspeth?\"\r\n\r\n\"She lives in the swamp--she's a kind of witch, I reckon, like--like--\"\r\n\r\n\"Like Medea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--only--I don't know--\" and he grew thoughtful.\r\n\r\nThe road turned now and far away to the eastward rose the first\r\nstraggling cabins of the town. Creeping toward them down the road rolled\r\na dark squat figure. It grew and spread slowly on the horizon until it\r\nbecame a fat old black woman, hooded and aproned, with great round hips\r\nand massive bosom. Her face was heavy and homely until she looked up and\r\nlifted the drooping cheeks, and then kindly old eyes beamed on the young\r\nteacher, as she curtsied and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening, honey! Good-evening! You sure is pretty dis evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Aunt Rachel, how are you?\" There was genuine pleasure in the\r\ngirl's tone.\r\n\r\n\"Just tolerable, honey, bless de Lord! Rumatiz is kind o' bad and Aunt\r\nRachel ain't so young as she use ter be.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what brings you to town afoot this time of day?\"\r\n\r\nThe face fell again to dull care and the old eyes crept away. She\r\nfumbled with her cane.\r\n\r\n\"It's de boys again, honey,\" she returned solemnly; \"dey'se good boys,\r\ndey is good to de're old mammy, but dey'se high strung and dey gits\r\nfighting and drinking and--and--last Saturday night dey got took up\r\nagain. I'se been to Jedge Grey--I use to tote him on my knee,\r\nhoney--I'se been to him to plead him not to let 'em go on de gang,\r\n'cause you see, honey,\" and she stroked the girl's sleeve as if pleading\r\nwith her, too, \"you see it done ruins boys to put 'em on de gang.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor tried hard to think of something comforting to say, but\r\nwords seemed inadequate to cheer the old soul; but after a few moments\r\nthey rode on, leaving the kind face again beaming and dimpling.\r\n\r\nAnd now the country town of Toomsville lifted itself above the cotton\r\nand corn, fringed with dirty straggling cabins of black folk. The road\r\nswung past the iron watering trough, turned sharply and, after passing\r\ntwo or three pert cottages and a stately house, old and faded, opened\r\ninto the wide square. Here pulsed the very life and being of the land.\r\nYonder great bales of cotton, yellow-white in its soiled sacking, piled\r\nin lofty, dusty mountains, lay listening for the train that, twice a\r\nday, ran out to the greater world. Round about, tied to the well-gnawed\r\nhitching rails, were rows of mules--mules with back cloths; mules with\r\nsaddles; mules hitched to long wagons, buggies, and rickety gigs; mules\r\nmunching golden ears of corn, and mules drooping their heads in\r\nsorrowful memory of better days.\r\n\r\nBeyond the cotton warehouse smoked the chimneys of the seed-mill and the\r\ncotton-gin; a red livery-stable faced them and all about three sides of\r\nthe square ran stores; big stores and small wide-windowed, narrow\r\nstores. Some had old steps above the worn clay side-walks, and some were\r\nflush with the ground. All had a general sense of dilapidation--save\r\none, the largest and most imposing, a three-story brick. This was\r\nCaldwell's \"Emporium\"; and here Bles stopped and Miss Taylor entered.\r\n\r\nMr. Caldwell himself hurried forward; and the whole store, clerks and\r\ncustomers, stood at attention, for Miss Taylor was yet new to the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nShe bought a few trifles and then approached her main business.\r\n\r\n\"My brother wants some information about the county, Mr. Caldwell, and I\r\nam only a teacher, and do not know much about conditions here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! where do you teach?\" asked Mr. Caldwell. He was certain he knew the\r\nteachers of all the white schools in the county. Miss Taylor told him.\r\nHe stiffened slightly but perceptibly, like a man clicking the buckles\r\nof his ready armor, and two townswomen who listened gradually turned\r\ntheir backs, but remained near.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes,\" he said, with uncomfortable haste. \"Any--er--information--of\r\ncourse--\" Miss Taylor got out her notes.\r\n\r\n\"The leading land-owners,\" she began, sorting the notes searchingly, \"I\r\nshould like to know something about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Colonel Cresswell is, of course, our greatest landlord--a\r\nhigh-bred gentleman of the old school. He and his son--a worthy\r\nsuccessor to the name--hold some fifty thousand acres. They may be\r\nconsidered representative types. Then, Mr. Maxwell has ten thousand\r\nacres and Mr. Tolliver a thousand.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor wrote rapidly. \"And cotton?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"We raise considerable cotton, but not nearly what we ought to; nigger\r\nlabor is too worthless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! The Negroes are not, then, very efficient?\"\r\n\r\n\"Efficient!\" snorted Mr. Caldwell; at last she had broached a phase of\r\nthe problem upon which he could dilate with fervor. \"They're the\r\nlowest-down, ornriest--begging your pardon--good-for-nothing loafers you\r\never heard of. Why, we just have to carry them and care for them like\r\nchildren. Look yonder,\" he pointed across the square to the court-house.\r\nIt was an old square brick-and-stucco building, sombre and stilted and\r\nvery dirty. Out of it filed a stream of men--some black and shackled;\r\nsome white and swaggering and liberal with tobacco-juice; some white and\r\nshaven and stiff. \"Court's just out,\" pursued Mr. Caldwell, \"and them\r\nniggers have just been sent to the gang--young ones, too; educated but\r\ngood for nothing. They're all that way.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor looked up a little puzzled, and became aware of a battery of\r\neyes and ears. Everybody seemed craning and listening, and she felt a\r\nsudden embarrassment and a sense of half-veiled hostility in the air.\r\nWith one or two further perfunctory questions, and a hasty expression of\r\nthanks, she escaped into the air.\r\n\r\nThe whole square seemed loafing and lolling--the white world perched on\r\nstoops and chairs, in doorways and windows; the black world filtering\r\ndown from doorways to side-walk and curb. The hot, dusty quadrangle\r\nstretched in dreary deadness toward the temple of the town, as if doing\r\nobeisance to the court-house. Down the courthouse steps the sheriff,\r\nwith Winchester on shoulder, was bringing the last prisoner--a\r\ncurly-headed boy with golden face and big brown frightened eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It's one of Dunn's boys,\" said Bles. \"He's drunk again, and they say\r\nhe's been stealing. I expect he was hungry.\" And they wheeled out of the\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor was tired, and the hastily scribbled letter which she\r\ndropped into the post in passing was not as clearly expressed as she\r\ncould wish.\r\n\r\nA great-voiced giant, brown and bearded, drove past them, roaring a\r\nhymn. He greeted Bles with a comprehensive wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n\"I guess Tylor has been paid off,\" said Bles, but Miss Taylor was too\r\ndisgusted to answer. Further on they overtook a tall young yellow boy\r\nwalking awkwardly beside a handsome, bold-faced girl. Two white men came\r\nriding by. One leered at the girl, and she laughed back, while the\r\nyellow boy strode sullenly ahead. As the two white riders approached the\r\nbuggy one said to the other:\r\n\r\n\"Who's that nigger with?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of them nigger teachers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they'll stop this damn riding around or they'll hear something,\"\r\nand they rode slowly by.\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor felt rather than heard their words, and she was\r\nuncomfortable. The sun fell fast; the long shadows of the swamp swept\r\nsoft coolness on the red road. Then afar in front a curled cloud of\r\nwhite dust arose and out of it came the sound of galloping horses.\r\n\r\n\"Who's this?\" asked Miss Taylor.\r\n\r\n\"The Cresswells, I think; they usually ride to town about this time.\"\r\nBut already Miss Taylor had descried the brown and tawny sides of the\r\nspeeding horses.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" she thought. \"The Cresswells!\" And with it came a\r\nsudden desire not to meet them--just then. She glanced toward the swamp.\r\nThe sun was sifting blood-red lances through the trees. A little\r\nwagon-road entered the wood and disappeared. Miss Taylor saw it.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see the sunset in the swamp,\" she said suddenly. On came the\r\ngalloping horses. Bles looked up in surprise, then silently turned into\r\nthe swamp. The horses flew by, their hoof-beats dying in the distance. A\r\ndark green silence lay about them lit by mighty crimson glories beyond.\r\nMiss Taylor leaned back and watched it dreamily till a sense of\r\noppression grew on her. The sun was sinking fast.\r\n\r\n\"Where does this road come out?\" she asked at last.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't come out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does it go?\"\r\n\r\n\"It goes to Elspeth's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we must turn back immediately. I thought--\" But Bles was already\r\nturning. They were approaching the main road again when there came a\r\nfluttering as of a great bird beating its wings amid the forest. Then a\r\ngirl, lithe, dark brown, and tall, leaped lightly into the path with\r\ngreetings on her lips for Bles. At the sight of the lady she drew\r\nsuddenly back and stood motionless regarding Miss Taylor, searching her\r\nwith wide black liquid eyes. Miss Taylor was a little startled.\r\n\r\n\"Good--good-evening,\" she said, straightening herself.\r\n\r\nThe girl was still silent and the horse stopped. One tense moment pulsed\r\nthrough all the swamp. Then the girl, still motionless--still looking\r\nMiss Taylor through and through--said with slow deliberateness:\r\n\r\n\"I hates you.\"\r\n\r\nThe teacher in Miss Taylor strove to rebuke this unconventional greeting\r\nbut the woman in her spoke first and asked almost before she knew it--\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Five_\r\n\r\nZORA\r\n\r\n\r\nZora, child of the swamp, was a heathen hoyden of twelve wayward,\r\nuntrained years. Slight, straight, strong, full-blooded, she had dreamed\r\nher life away in wilful wandering through her dark and sombre kingdom\r\nuntil she was one with it in all its moods; mischievous, secretive,\r\nbrooding; full of great and awful visions, steeped body and soul in\r\nwood-lore. Her home was out of doors, the cabin of Elspeth her port of\r\ncall for talking and eating. She had not known, she had scarcely seen, a\r\nchild of her own age until Bles Alwyn had fled from her dancing in the\r\nnight, and she had searched and found him sleeping in the misty morning\r\nlight. It was to her a strange new thing to see a fellow of like years\r\nwith herself, and she gripped him to her soul in wild interest and new\r\ncuriosity. Yet this childish friendship was so new and incomprehensible\r\na thing to her that she did not know how to express it. At first she\r\npounced upon him in mirthful, almost impish glee, teasing and mocking\r\nand half scaring him, despite his fifteen years of young manhood.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they is devils down yonder behind the swamp,\" she would whisper,\r\nwarningly, when, after the first meeting, he had crept back again and\r\nagain, half fascinated, half amused to greet her; \"I'se seen 'em, I'se\r\nheard 'em, 'cause my mammy is a witch.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy would sit and watch her wonderingly as she lay curled along the\r\nlow branch of the mighty oak, clinging with little curved limbs and\r\nflying fingers. Possessed by the spirit of her vision, she would chant,\r\nlow-voiced, tremulous, mischievous:\r\n\r\n\"One night a devil come to me on blue fire out of a big red flower that\r\ngrows in the south swamp; he was tall and big and strong as anything,\r\nand when he spoke the trees shook and the stars fell. Even mammy was\r\nafeared; and it takes a lot to make mammy afeared, 'cause she's a witch\r\nand can conjure. He said, 'I'll come when you die--I'll come when you\r\ndie, and take the conjure off you,' and then he went away on a big\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shucks!\" the boy would say, trying to express scornful disbelief when,\r\nin truth, he was awed and doubtful. Always he would glance involuntarily\r\nback along the path behind him. Then her low birdlike laughter would\r\nrise and ring through the trees.\r\n\r\nSo passed a year, and there came the time when her wayward teasing and\r\nthe almost painful thrill of her tale-telling nettled him and drove him\r\naway. For long months he did not meet her, until one day he saw her deep\r\neyes fixed longingly upon him from a thicket in the swamp. He went and\r\ngreeted her. But she said no word, sitting nested among the greenwood\r\nwith passionate, proud silence, until he had sued long for peace; then\r\nin sudden new friendship she had taken his hand and led him through the\r\nswamp, showing him all the beauty of her swamp-world--great shadowy oaks\r\nand limpid pools, lone, naked trees and sweet flowers; the whispering\r\nand flitting of wild things, and the winging of furtive birds. She had\r\ndropped the impish mischief of her way, and up from beneath it rose a\r\nwistful, visionary tenderness; a mighty half-confessed, half-concealed,\r\nstriving for unknown things. He seemed to have found a new friend.\r\n\r\nAnd today, after he had taken Miss Taylor home and supped, he came out\r\nin the twilight under the new moon and whistled the tremulous note that\r\nalways brought her.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you speak so to Miss Taylor?\" he asked, reproachfully. She\r\nconsidered the matter a moment.\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand,\" she said. \"You can't never understand. I can see\r\nright through people. You can't. You never had a witch for a mammy--did\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you see I have to take care of you and see things for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" he said thoughtfully, \"you must learn to read.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"So that you can read books and know lots of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't white folks make books?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--most of the books.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh! I knows more than they do now--a heap more.\"\r\n\r\n\"In some ways you do; but they know things that give them power and\r\nwealth and make them rule.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. They don't really rule; they just thinks they rule. They just\r\ngot things--heavy, dead things. We black folks is got the _spirit_.\r\nWe'se lighter and cunninger; we fly right through them; we go and come\r\nagain just as we wants to. Black folks is wonderful.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not understand what she meant; but he knew what he wanted and he\r\ntried again.\r\n\r\n\"Even if white folks don't know everything they know different things\r\nfrom us, and we ought to know what they know.\"\r\n\r\nThis appealed to her somewhat.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe they know much,\" she concluded; \"but I'll learn to read\r\nand just see.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be hard work,\" he warned. But he had come prepared for\r\nacquiescence. He took a primer from his pocket and, lighting a match,\r\nshowed her the alphabet.\r\n\r\n\"Learn those,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" she asked, looking at the letters disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\"Because that's the way,\" he said, as the light flared and went out.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" she disputed, disappearing in the wood and\r\nreturning with a pine-knot. They lighted it and its smoky flame threw\r\nwavering shadows about. She turned the leaves till she came to a picture\r\nwhich she studied intently.\r\n\r\n\"Is this about this?\" she asked, pointing alternately to reading and\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And if you learn--\"\r\n\r\n\"Read it,\" she commanded. He read the page.\r\n\r\n\"Again,\" she said, making him point out each word. Then she read it\r\nafter him, accurately, with more perfect expression. He stared at her.\r\nShe took the book, and with a nod was gone.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday and dark. She never asked Bles to her home--to that\r\nmysterious black cabin in mid-swamp. He thought her ashamed of it, and\r\ndelicately refrained from going. So tonight she slipped away, stopped\r\nand listened till she heard his footsteps on the pike, and then flew\r\nhomeward. Presently the old black cabin loomed before her with its wide\r\nflapping door. The old woman was bending over the fire, stirring some\r\nsavory mess, and a yellow girl with a white baby on one arm was placing\r\ndishes on a rickety wooden table when Zora suddenly and noiselessly\r\nentered the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come, is you? I 'lowed victuals would fetch you,\" grumbled the hag.\r\n\r\nBut Zora deigned no answer. She walked placidly to the table, where she\r\ntook up a handful of cold corn-bread and meat, and then went over and\r\ncurled up by the fire.\r\n\r\nElspeth and the girl talked and laughed coarsely, and the night wore\r\non.\r\n\r\nBy and by loud laughter and tramping came from the road--a sound of\r\nnumerous footsteps. Zora listened, leapt to her feet and started to the\r\ndoor. The old crone threw an epithet after her; but she flashed through\r\nthe lighted doorway and was gone, followed by the oath and shouts from\r\nthe approaching men. In the hut night fled with wild song and revel, and\r\nday dawned again. Out from some fastness of the wood crept Zora. She\r\nstopped and bathed in a pool, and combed her close-clung hair, then\r\nentered silently to breakfast.\r\n\r\nThus began in the dark swamp that primal battle with the Word. She hated\r\nit and despised it, but her pride was in arms and her one great life\r\nfriendship in the balance. She fought her way with a dogged persistence\r\nthat brought word after word of praise and interest from Bles. Then,\r\nonce well begun, her busy, eager mind flew with a rapidity that\r\nstartled; the stories especially she devoured--tales of strange things\r\nand countries and men gripped her imagination and clung to her memory.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you there was lots to learn?\" he asked once.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it all,\" she retorted; \"every bit. I'se thought it all before;\r\nonly the little things is different--and I like the little, strange\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\nSpring ripened to summer. She was reading well and writing some.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" he announced one morning under their forest oak, \"you must go to\r\nschool.\"\r\n\r\nShe eyed him, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've found some things worth knowing in this world, haven't you,\r\nZora?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she admitted.\r\n\r\n\"But there are more--many, many more--worlds on worlds of things--you\r\nhave not dreamed of.\"\r\n\r\nShe stared at him, open-eyed, and a wonder crept upon her face battling\r\nwith the old assurance. Then she looked down at her bare brown feet and\r\ntorn gown.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a little money, Zora,\" he said quickly.\r\n\r\nBut she lifted her head.\r\n\r\n\"I'll earn mine,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" he asked doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I'll pick cotton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Course I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's hard work.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to work,\" she mused. \"You see, mammy's pappy was a king's\r\nson, and kings don't work. I don't work; mostly I dreams. But I can\r\nwork, and I will--for the wonder things--and for you.\"\r\n\r\nSo the summer yellowed and silvered into fall. All the vacation days\r\nBles worked on the farm, and Zora read and dreamed and studied in the\r\nwood, until the land lay white with harvest. Then, without warning, she\r\nappeared in the cotton-field beside Bles, and picked.\r\n\r\nIt was hot, sore work. The sun blazed; her bent and untrained back\r\npained, and the soft little hands bled. But no complaint passed her\r\nlips; her hands never wavered, and her eyes met his steadily and\r\ngravely. She bade him good-night, cheerily, and then stole away to the\r\nwood, crouching beneath the great oak, and biting back the groans that\r\ntrembled on her lips. Often, she fell supperless to sleep, with two\r\ngreat tears creeping down her tired cheeks.\r\n\r\nWhen school-time came there was not yet money enough, for cotton-picking\r\nwas not far advanced. Yet Zora would take no money from Bles, and worked\r\nearnestly away.\r\n\r\nMeantime there occurred to the boy the momentous question of clothes.\r\nHad Zora thought of them? He feared not. She knew little of clothes and\r\ncared less. So one day in town he dropped into Caldwell's \"Emporium\"\r\nand glanced hesitantly at certain ready-made dresses. One caught his\r\neye. It came from the great Easterly mills in New England and was red--a\r\nvivid red. The glowing warmth of this cloth of cotton caught the eye of\r\nBles, and he bought the gown for a dollar and a half.\r\n\r\nHe carried it to Zora in the wood, and unrolled it before her eyes that\r\ndanced with glad tears. Of course, it was long and wide; but he fetched\r\nneedle and thread and scissors, too. It was a full month after school\r\nhad begun when they, together back in the swamp, shadowed by the\r\nfoliage, began to fashion the wonderful garment. At the same time she\r\nlaid ten dollars of her first hard-earned money in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"You can finish the first year with this money,\" Bles assured her,\r\ndelighted, \"and then next year you must come in to board; because, you\r\nsee, when you're educated you won't want to live in the swamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wants to live here always.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not at Elspeth's.\"\r\n\r\n\"No-o--not there, not there.\" And a troubled questioning trembled in her\r\neyes, but brought no answering thought in his, for he was busy with his\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\"Then, you see, Zora, if you stay here you'll need a new house, and\r\nyou'll want to learn how to make it beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a beautiful, great castle here in the swamp,\" she dreamed; \"but,\"\r\nand her face fell, \"I can't get money enough to board in; and I don't\r\nwant to board in--I wants to be free.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, curled down so earnestly at her puzzling task, and a\r\npity for the more than motherless child swept over him. He bent over\r\nher, nervously, eagerly, and she laid down her sewing and sat silent and\r\npassive with dark, burning eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" he said, \"I want you to do all this--for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, if you wants me to,\" she said quietly, but with something in\r\nher voice that made him look half startled into her beautiful eyes and\r\nfeel a queer flushing in his face. He stretched his hand out and taking\r\nhers held it lightly till she quivered and drew away, bending again\r\nover her sewing.\r\n\r\nThen a nameless exaltation rose within his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" he whispered, \"I've got a plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked, still with bowed head.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, till I tell you of the Golden Fleece.\"\r\n\r\nThen she too heard the story of Jason. Breathless she listened, dropping\r\nher sewing and leaning forward, eager-eyed. Then her face clouded.\r\n\r\n\"Do you s'pose mammy's the witch?\" she asked dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"No; she wouldn't give her own flesh and blood to help the thieving\r\nJason.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him searchingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she would, too,\" affirmed the girl, and then she paused, still\r\nintently watching him. She was troubled, and again a question eagerly\r\nhovered on her lips. But he continued:\r\n\r\n\"Then we must escape her,\" he said gayly. \"See! yonder lies the Silver\r\nFleece spread across the brown back of the world; let's get a bit of it,\r\nand hide it here in the swamp, and comb it, and tend it, and make it the\r\nbeautifullest bit of all. Then we can sell it, and send you to school.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat silently bent forward, turning the picture in her mind. Suddenly\r\nforgetting her trouble, she bubbled with laughter, and leaping up\r\nclapped her hands.\r\n\r\n\"And I knows just the place!\" she cried eagerly, looking at him with a\r\nflash of the old teasing mischief--\"down in the heart of the\r\nswamp--where dreams and devils lives.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp at the school-house Miss Taylor was musing. She had been invited to\r\nspend the summer with Mrs. Grey at Lake George, and such a\r\nsummer!--silken clothes and dainty food, motoring and golf, well-groomed\r\nmen and elegant women. She would not have put it in just that way, but\r\nthe vision came very close to spelling heaven to her mind. Not that she\r\nwould come to it vacant-minded, but rather as a trained woman, starved\r\nfor companionship and wanting something of the beauty and ease of life.\r\nShe sat dreaming of it here with rows of dark faces before her, and the\r\nsingsong wail of a little black reader with his head aslant and his\r\npatched kneepants.\r\n\r\nThe day was warm and languorous, and the last pale mist of the Silver\r\nFleece peeped in at the windows. She tried to follow the third-reader\r\nlesson with her finger, but persistently off she went, dreaming, to some\r\nexquisite little parlor with its green and gold, the clink of dainty\r\nchina and hum of low voices, and the blue lake in the window; she would\r\nglance up, the door would open softly and--\r\n\r\nJust here she did glance up, and all the school glanced with her. The\r\ndrone of the reader hushed. The door opened softly, and upon the\r\nthreshold stood Zora. Her small feet and slender ankles were black and\r\nbare; her dark, round, and broad-browed head and strangely beautiful\r\nface were poised almost defiantly, crowned with a misty mass of waveless\r\nhair, and lit by the velvet radiance of two wonderful eyes. And hanging\r\nfrom shoulder to ankle, in formless, clinging folds, blazed the scarlet\r\ngown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Six_\r\n\r\nCOTTON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cry of the naked was sweeping the world. From the peasant toiling in\r\nRussia, the lady lolling in London, the chieftain burning in Africa, and\r\nthe Esquimaux freezing in Alaska; from long lines of hungry men, from\r\npatient sad-eyed women, from old folk and creeping children went up the\r\ncry, \"Clothes, clothes!\" Far away the wide black land that belts the\r\nSouth, where Miss Smith worked and Miss Taylor drudged and Bles and Zora\r\ndreamed, the dense black land sensed the cry and heard the bound of\r\nanswering life within the vast dark breast. All that dark earth heaved\r\nin mighty travail with the bursting bolls of the cotton while black\r\nattendant earth spirits swarmed above, sweating and crooning to its\r\nbirth pains.\r\n\r\nAfter the miracle of the bursting bolls, when the land was brightest\r\nwith the piled mist of the Fleece, and when the cry of the naked was\r\nloudest in the mouths of men, a sudden cloud of workers swarmed between\r\nthe Cotton and the Naked, spinning and weaving and sewing and carrying\r\nthe Fleece and mining and minting and bringing the Silver till the Song\r\nof Service filled the world and the poetry of Toil was in the souls of\r\nthe laborers. Yet ever and always there were tense silent white-faced\r\nmen moving in that swarm who felt no poetry and heard no song, and one\r\nof these was John Taylor.\r\n\r\nHe was tall, thin, cold, and tireless and he moved among the Watchers of\r\nthis World of Trade. In the rich Wall Street offices of Grey and\r\nEasterly, Brokers, Mr. Taylor, as chief and confidential clerk surveyed\r\nthe world's nakedness and the supply of cotton to clothe it. The object\r\nof his watching was frankly stated to himself and to his world. He\r\npurposed going into business neither for his own health nor for the\r\nhealing or clothing of the peoples but to apply his knowledge of the\r\nworld's nakedness and of black men's toil in such a way as to bring\r\nhimself wealth. In this he was but following the teaching of his highest\r\nideal, lately deceased, Mr. Job Grey. Mr. Grey had so successfully\r\nmanipulated the cotton market that while black men who made the cotton\r\nstarved in Alabama and white men who bought it froze in Siberia, he\r\nhimself sat--\r\n\r\n     _\"High on a throne of royal state\r\n     That far outshone the wealth\r\n     Of Ormuz or of Ind._\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this he died eventually, leaving the burden of his\r\nwealth to his bewildered wife, and his business to the astute Mr.\r\nEasterly; not simply to Mr. Easterly, but in a sense to his spiritual\r\nheir, John Taylor.\r\n\r\nTo be sure Mr. Taylor had but a modest salary and no financial interest\r\nin the business, but he had knowledge and business daring--effrontery\r\neven--and the determination was fixed in his mind to be a millionaire at\r\nno distant date. Some cautious fliers on the market gave him enough\r\nsurplus to send his sister Mary through the high school of his country\r\nhome in New Hampshire, and afterward through Wellesley College; although\r\njust why a woman should want to go through college was inexplicable to\r\nJohn Taylor, and he was still uncertain as to the wisdom of his charity.\r\n\r\nWhen she had an offer to teach in the South, John Taylor hurried her off\r\nfor two reasons: he was profoundly interested in the cotton-belt, and\r\nthere she might be of service to him; and secondly, he had spent all the\r\nmoney on her that he intended to at present, and he wanted her to go to\r\nwork. As an investment he did not consider Mary a success. Her letters\r\nintimated very strongly her intention not to return to Miss Smith's\r\nSchool; but they also brought information--disjointed and incomplete, to\r\nbe sure--which mightily interested Mr. Taylor and sent him to atlases,\r\nencyclopædias, and census-reports. When he went to that little lunch\r\nwith old Mrs. Grey he was not sure that he wanted his sister to leave\r\nthe cotton-belt just yet. After lunch he was sure that he did not want\r\nher to leave.\r\n\r\nThe rich Mrs. Grey was at the crisis of her fortunes. She was an elderly\r\nlady, in those uncertain years beyond fifty, and had been left suddenly\r\nwith more millions than she could easily count. Personally she was\r\ninclined to spend her money in bettering the world right off, in such\r\nways as might from time to time seem attractive. This course, to her\r\nhusband's former partner and present executor, Mr. Edward Easterly, was\r\nnot only foolish but wicked, and, incidentally, distinctly unprofitable\r\nto him. He had expressed himself strongly to Mrs. Grey last night at\r\ndinner and had reinforced his argument by a pointed letter written this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nTo John Taylor Mrs. Grey's disposal of the income was unbelievable\r\nblasphemy against the memory of a mighty man. He did not put this in\r\nwords to Mrs. Grey--he was only head clerk in her late husband's\r\noffice--but he became watchful and thoughtful. He ate his soup in\r\nsilence when she descanted on various benevolent schemes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what do you know,\" she asked finally, \"about Negroes--about\r\neducating them?\" Mr. Taylor over his fish was about to deny all\r\nknowledge of any sort on the subject, but all at once he recollected his\r\nsister, and a sudden gleam of light radiated his mental gloom.\r\n\r\n\"Have a sister who is--er--devoting herself to teaching them,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Is that so!\" cried Mrs. Grey, joyfully. \"Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Tooms County, Alabama--in--\" Mr. Taylor consulted a remote mental\r\npocket--\"in Miss Sara Smith's school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how fortunate! I'm so glad I mentioned the matter. You see, Miss\r\nSmith is a sister of a friend of ours, Congressman Smith of New Jersey,\r\nand she has just written to me for help; a very touching letter, too,\r\nabout the poor blacks. My father set great store by blacks and was a\r\nleading abolitionist before he died.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor was thinking fast. Yes, the name of Congressman Peter Smith\r\nwas quite familiar. Mr. Easterly, as chairman of the Republican State\r\nCommittee of New Jersey, had been compelled to discipline Mr. Smith\r\npretty severely for certain socialistic votes in the House, and\r\nconsequently his future career was uncertain. It was important that such\r\na man should not have too much to do with Mrs. Grey's philanthropies--at\r\nleast, in his present position.\r\n\r\n\"Should like to have you meet and talk with my sister, Mrs. Grey; she's\r\na Wellesley graduate,\" said Taylor, finally.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey was delighted. It was a combination which she felt she needed.\r\nHere was a college-girl who could direct her philanthropies and her\r\netiquette during the summer. Forthwith Mary Taylor received an\r\nintimation from her brother that vast interests depended on her summer\r\nvacation.\r\n\r\nThus it had happened that Miss Taylor came to Lake George for her\r\nvacation after the first year at the Smith School, and she and Miss\r\nSmith had silently agreed as she left that it would be better for her\r\nnot to return. But the gods of lower Broadway thought otherwise. Not\r\nthat Mary Taylor did not believe in Miss Smith's work, she was too\r\nhonest not to believe in education; but she was sure that this was not\r\nher work, and she had not as yet perfected in her own mind any theory of\r\nthe world into which black folk fitted. She was rather taken back,\r\ntherefore, to be regarded as an expert on the problem. First her brother\r\nattacked her, not simply on cotton, but, to her great surprise, on Negro\r\neducation; and after listening to her halting uncertain remarks, he\r\nsuggested to her certain matters which it would be better for her to\r\nbelieve when Mrs. Grey talked to her.\r\n\r\n\"Interested in darkies, you see,\" he concluded, \"and looks to you to\r\ntell things. Better go easy and suggest a waiting-game before she goes\r\nin heavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Miss Smith needs money--\" the New England conscience prompted. John\r\nTaylor cut in sharply:\r\n\r\n\"We all need money, and I know people who need Mrs. Grey's more than\r\nMiss Smith does at present.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor found the Lake George colony charming. It was not\r\nultra-fashionable, but it had wealth and leisure and some breeding.\r\nEspecially was this true of a circumscribed, rather exclusive, set which\r\ncentred around the Vanderpools of New York and Boston. They, or rather\r\nMr. Vanderpool's connections, were of Old Dutch New York stock; his\r\nfather it was who had built the Lake George cottage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool was a Wells of Boston, and endured Lake George now and\r\nthen during the summer for her husband's sake, although she regarded it\r\nall as rather a joke. This summer promised to be unusually lonesome for\r\nher, and she was meditating a retreat to the Massachusetts north shore\r\nwhen she chanced to meet Mary Taylor, at a miscellaneous dinner, and\r\nfound her interesting. She discovered that this young woman knew things,\r\nthat she could talk books, and that she was rather pretty. To be sure\r\nshe knew no people, but Mrs. Vanderpool knew enough to even things.\r\n\r\n\"By the bye, I met some charming Alabama people last winter, in\r\nMontgomery--the Cresswells; do you know them?\" she asked one day, as\r\nthey were lounging in wicker chairs on the Vanderpool porch. Then she\r\nanswered the query herself: \"No, of course you could not. It is too bad\r\nthat your work deprives you of the society of people of your class. Now\r\nmy ideal is a set of Negro schools where the white teachers _could_ know\r\nthe Cresswells.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes--\" faltered Miss Taylor; \"but--wouldn't that be difficult?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, would the Cresswells approve of educating Negroes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, 'educating'! The word conceals so much. Now, I take it the\r\nCresswells would object to instructing them in French and in dinner\r\netiquette and tea-gowns, and so, in fact, would I; but teach them how to\r\nhandle a hoe and to sew and cook. I have reason to know that people like\r\nthe Cresswells would be delighted.\"\r\n\r\n\"And with the teachers of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?--provided, of course, they were--well, gentlefolk and\r\nassociated accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But one must associate with one's pupils.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, certainly; just as one must associate with one's maids\r\nand chauffeurs and dressmakers--cordially and kindly, but with a\r\ndifference.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but, dear Mrs. Vanderpool, you wouldn't want your children trained\r\nthat way, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, my dear. But these are not my children, they are the\r\nchildren of Negroes; we can't quite forget that, can we?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I suppose not,\" Miss Taylor admitted, a little helplessly. \"But--it\r\nseems to me--that's the modern idea of taking culture to the masses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, then, the modern idea is not my idea; it is too socialistic.\r\nAnd as for culture applied to the masses, you utter a paradox. The\r\nmasses and work is the truth one must face.\"\r\n\r\n\"And culture and work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite incompatible, I assure you, my dear.\" She stretched her silken\r\nlimbs, lazily, while Miss Taylor sat silently staring at the waters.\r\n\r\nJust then Mrs. Grey drove up in her new red motor.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Mary Taylor's arrival the acquaintance of the\r\nVanderpools and Mrs. Grey had been a matter chiefly of smiling bows.\r\nAfter Miss Taylor came there had been calls and casual intercourse, to\r\nMrs. Grey's great gratification and Mrs. Vanderpool's mingled amusement\r\nand annoyance. Mrs. Grey announced the arrival of the Easterlys and John\r\nTaylor for the week-end. As Mrs. Vanderpool could think of nothing less\r\nboring, she consented to dine.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Mrs. Grey's ornate cottage was different from that of\r\nthe Vanderpools. The display of wealth and splendor had a touch of the\r\nbarbaric. Mary Taylor liked it, although she found the Vanderpool\r\natmosphere more subtly satisfying. There was a certain grim power\r\nbeneath the Greys' mahogany and velvets that thrilled while it appalled.\r\nPrecisely that side of the thing appealed to her brother. He would have\r\nseen little or nothing in the plain elegance yonder, while here he saw a\r\nJapanese vase that cost no cent less than a thousand dollars. He meant\r\nto be able to duplicate it some day. He knew that Grey was poor and less\r\nknowing than he sixty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe dead millionaire had begun his fortune by buying and selling\r\ncotton--travelling in the South in reconstruction times, and sending his\r\nagents. In this way he made his thousands. Then he took a step forward,\r\nand instead of following the prices induced the prices to follow him.\r\nTwo or three small cotton corners brought him his tens of thousands.\r\nAbout this time Easterly joined him and pointed out a new road--the\r\nbuying and selling of stock in various cotton-mills and other industrial\r\nenterprises. Grey hesitated, but Easterly pushed him on and he made his\r\nhundreds of thousands. Then Easterly proposed buying controlling\r\ninterests in certain large mills and gradually consolidating them. The\r\nplan grew and succeeded, and Grey made his millions.\r\n\r\nThen Grey stopped; he had money enough, and he would venture no farther.\r\nHe \"was going to retire and eat peanuts,\" he said with a chuckle.\r\n\r\nEasterly was disgusted. He, too, had made millions--not as many as Grey,\r\nbut a few. It was not, however, simply money that he wanted, but power.\r\nThe lust of financial dominion had gripped his soul, and he had a vision\r\nof a vast trust of cotton manufacturing covering the land. He talked\r\nthis incessantly into Grey, but Grey continued to shake his head; the\r\nthing was too big for his imagination. He was bent on retiring, and just\r\nas he had set the date a year hence he inadvertently died. On the whole,\r\nMr. Easterly was glad of his partner's definite withdrawal, since he\r\nleft his capital behind him, until he found his vast plans about to be\r\ncircumvented by Mrs. Grey withdrawing this capital from his control. \"To\r\ngive to the niggers and Chinamen,\" he snorted to John Taylor, and strode\r\nup and down the veranda. John Taylor removed his coat, lighted a black\r\ncigar, and elevated his heels. The ladies were in the parlor, where the\r\nfemale Easterlys were prostrating themselves before Mrs. Vanderpool.\r\n\r\n\"Just what is your plan?\" asked Taylor, quite as if he did not know.\r\n\r\n\"Why, man, the transfer of a hundred millions of stock would give me\r\ncontrol of the cotton-mills of America. Think of it!--the biggest trust\r\nnext to steel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not bigger?\" asked Taylor, imperturbably puffing away. Mr. Easterly\r\neyed him. He had regarded Taylor hitherto as a very valuable asset to\r\nthe business--had relied on his knowledge of routine, his judgment and\r\nhis honesty; but he detected tonight a new tone in his clerk, something\r\nalmost authoritative and self-reliant. He paused and smiled at him.\r\n\r\n\"Bigger?\"\r\n\r\nBut John Taylor was dead in earnest. He did not smile.\r\n\r\n\"First, there's England--and all Europe; why not bring them into the\r\ntrust?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly, later; but first, America. Of course, I've got my eyes on the\r\nEuropean situation and feelers out; but such matters are more difficult\r\nand slower of adjustment over there--so damned much law and gospel.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's another side.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are planning to combine and control the manufacture of cotton--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about your raw material? The steel trust owns its iron mines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course--mines could be monopolized and hold the trust up; but our\r\nraw material is perfectly safe--farms growing smaller, farms isolated,\r\nand we fixing the price. It's a cinch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Taylor surveyed him with a narrowed look.\r\n\r\n\"Certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not. I've been looking up things, and there are three points you'd\r\nbetter study: First, cotton farms are not getting smaller; they're\r\ngetting bigger almighty fast, and there's a big cotton-land monopoly in\r\nsight. Second, the banks and wholesale houses in the South _can_ control\r\nthe cotton output if they work together. Third, watch the Southern\r\n'Farmers' League' of big landlords.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Easterly threw away his cigar and sat down. Taylor straightened up,\r\nswitched on the porch light, and took a bundle of papers from his coat\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\"Here are census figures,\" he said, \"commercial reports and letters.\"\r\nThey pored over them a half hour. Then Easterly arose.\r\n\r\n\"There's something in it,\" he admitted, \"but what can we do? What do you\r\npropose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Monopolize the growth as well as the manufacture of cotton, and use\r\nthe first to club European manufacturers into submission.\"\r\n\r\nEasterly stared at him.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" he ejaculated; \"you're crazy!\"\r\n\r\nBut Taylor smiled a slow, thin smile, and put away his papers. Easterly\r\ncontinued to stare at his subordinate with a sort of fascination, with\r\nthe awe that one feels when genius unexpectedly reveals itself from a\r\nsource hitherto regarded as entirely ordinary. At last he drew a long\r\nbreath, remarking indefinitely:\r\n\r\n\"I'll think it over.\"\r\n\r\nA stir in the parlor indicated departure.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you watch the Farmers' League, and note its success and methods,\"\r\ncounselled John Taylor, his tone and manner unchanged. \"Then figure what\r\nit might do in the hands of--let us say, friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's running it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A Colonel Cresswell is its head, and happens also to be the force\r\nbehind it. Aristocratic family--big planter--near where my sister\r\nteaches.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm--well, we'll watch _him_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And say,\" as Easterly was turning away, \"you know Congressman Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mrs. Grey seems to be depending on him for advice in distributing\r\nsome of her charity funds.\"\r\n\r\nEasterly appeared startled.\r\n\r\n\"She is, is she!\" he exclaimed. \"But here come the ladies.\" He went\r\nforward at once, but John Taylor drew back. He noted Mrs. Vanderpool,\r\nand thought her too thin and pale. The dashing young Miss Easterly was\r\nmore to his taste. He intended to have a wife like that one of these\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"Mary,\" said he to his sister as he finally rose to go, \"tell me about\r\nthe Cresswells.\"\r\n\r\nMary explained to him at length the impossibility of her knowing much\r\nabout the local white aristocracy of Tooms County, and then told him all\r\nshe had heard.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Grey talked to you much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"About darky schools?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does she intend to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think she will aid Miss Smith first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you suggest anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I told her what I thought about coöperating with the local white\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Cresswells?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--you see Mrs. Vanderpool knows the Cresswells.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does, eh? Good! Say, that's a good point. You just bear heavy on\r\nit--coöperate with the Cresswells.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes. But--you see, John, I don't just know whether one _could_\r\ncoöperate with the Cresswells or not--one hears such contradictory\r\nstories of them. But there must be some other white people--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff! It's the Cresswells we want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Mary was very dubious, \"they are--the most important.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seven_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLACE OF DREAMS\r\n\r\nWhen she went South late in September, Mary Taylor had two definite but\r\nallied objects: she was to get all possible business information\r\nconcerning the Cresswells, and she was to induce Miss Smith to prepare\r\nfor Mrs. Grey's benevolence by interesting the local whites in her work.\r\nThe programme attracted Miss Taylor. She felt in touch, even if dimly\r\nand slightly, with great industrial movements, and she felt, too, like a\r\ndiscerning pioneer in philanthropy. Both roles she liked. Besides, they\r\nheld, each, certain promises of social prestige; and society, Miss\r\nTaylor argued, one must have even in Alabama.\r\n\r\nBles Alwyn met her at the train. He was growing to be a big fine bronze\r\ngiant, and Mary was glad to see him. She especially tried, in the first\r\nfew weeks of opening school, to glean as much information as possible\r\nconcerning the community, and particularly the Cresswells. She found the\r\nNegro youth quicker, surer, and more intelligent in his answers than\r\nthose she questioned elsewhere, and she gained real enjoyment from her\r\nlong talks with him.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't Bles developing splendidly?\" she said to Miss Smith one\r\nafternoon. There was an unmistakable note of enthusiasm in her voice.\r\nMiss Smith slowly closed her letter-file but did not look up.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said crisply. \"He's eighteen now--quite a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"And most interesting to talk with.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm--very\"--drily. Mary was busy with her own thoughts, and she did not\r\nnotice the other woman's manner.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" she pursued, \"I'm a little afraid of one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you've noted it, too?--his friendship for that impossible girl,\r\nZora?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith gave her a searching look.\r\n\r\n\"What of it?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n\"She is so far beneath him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a bold, godless thing; I don't understand her.\"\r\n\r\n\"The two are not quite the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not; but she is unnaturally forward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bright,\" Miss Smith amplified.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; she knows quite too much. You surely remember that awful scarlet\r\ndress? Well, all her clothes have arrived, or remained, at a simplicity\r\nand vividness that is--well--immodest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she think them immodest?\"\r\n\r\n\"What she thinks is a problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"_The_ problem, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes.\"\r\n\r\nThey paused a moment. Then Miss Smith said slowly: \"What I don't\r\nunderstand, I don't judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but you can't always help seeing and meeting it,\" laughed Miss\r\nTaylor.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. I don't try; I court the meeting and seeing. It is the\r\nonly way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps, for us--but not for a boy like Bles, and a girl like\r\nZora.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; men and women must exercise judgment in their intercourse\r\nand\"--she glanced sharply at Miss Taylor--\"my dear, you yourself must\r\nnot forget that Bles Alwyn is a man.\"\r\n\r\nFar up the road came a low, long, musical shouting; then with creaking\r\nand straining of wagons, four great black mules dashed into sight with\r\ntwelve bursting bales of yellowish cotton looming and swaying behind.\r\nThe drivers and helpers were lolling and laughing and singing, but Miss\r\nTaylor did not hear nor see. She had sat suddenly upright; her face had\r\nflamed crimson, and then went dead white.\r\n\r\n\"Miss--Miss Smith!\" she gasped, overwhelmed with dismay, a picture of\r\nwounded pride and consternation.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith turned around very methodically and took her hand; but while\r\nshe spoke the girl merely stared at her in stony silence.\r\n\r\n\"Now, dear, don't mean more than I do. I'm an old woman, and I've seen\r\nmany things. This is but a little corner of the world, and yet many\r\npeople pass here in thirty years. The trouble with new teachers who come\r\nis, that like you, they cannot see black folk as human. All to them are\r\neither impossible Zoras, or else lovable Blessings. They forget that\r\nZora is not to be annihilated, but studied and understood, and that Bles\r\nis a young man of eighteen and not a clod.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that he should dare--\" Mary began breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"He hasn't dared,\" Miss Smith went gently on. \"No thought of you but as\r\na teacher has yet entered his dear, simple head. But, my point is simply\r\nthis: he's a man, and a human one, and if you keep on making much over\r\nhim, and talking to him and petting him, he'll have the right to\r\ninterpret your manner in his own way--the same that any young man\r\nwould.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but, he's a--a--\"\r\n\r\n\"A Negro. To be sure, he is; and a man in addition. Now, dear, don't\r\ntake this too much to heart; this is not a rebuke, but a clumsy warning.\r\nI am simply trying to make clear to you _why_ you should be careful.\r\nTreat poor Zora a little more lovingly, and Bles a little less warmly.\r\nThey are just human--but, oh! so human.\"\r\n\r\nMary Taylor rose up stiffly and mumbled a brief good-night. She went to\r\nher room, and sat down in the dark. The mere mention of the thing was to\r\nher so preposterous--no, loathsome, she kept repeating.\r\n\r\nShe slowly undressed in the dark, and heard the rumbling of the cotton\r\nwagons as they swayed toward town. The cry of the Naked was sweeping the\r\nworld, and yonder in the night black men were answering the call. They\r\nknew not what or why they answered, but obeyed the irresistible call,\r\nwith hearts light and song upon their lips--the Song of Service. They\r\nlashed their mules and drank their whiskey, and all night the piled\r\nfleece swept by Mary Taylor's window, flying--flying to that far cry.\r\nMiss Taylor turned uneasily in her bed and jerked the bed-clothes about\r\nher ears.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Vanderpool is right,\" she confided to the night, with something of\r\nthe awe with which one suddenly comprehends a hidden oracle; \"there must\r\nbe a difference, always, always! That impudent Negro!\"\r\n\r\nAll night she dreamed, and all day,--especially when trim and immaculate\r\nshe sat in her chair and looked down upon fifty dark faces--and upon\r\nZora.\r\n\r\nZora sat thinking. She saw neither Miss Taylor nor the long straight\r\nrows of desks and faces. She heard neither the drone of the spellers nor\r\ndid she hear Miss Taylor say, \"Zora!\" She heard and saw none of this.\r\nShe only heard the prattle of the birds in the wood, far down where the\r\nSilver Fleece would be planted.\r\n\r\nFor the time of cotton-planting was coming; the gray and drizzle of\r\nDecember was past and the hesitation, of January. Already a certain\r\nwarmth and glow had stolen into the air, and the Swamp was calling its\r\nchild with low, seductive voice. She knew where the first leaves were\r\nbursting, where tiny flowers nestled, and where young living things\r\nlooked upward to the light and cried and crawled. A wistful longing was\r\nstealing into her heart. She wanted to be free. She wanted to run and\r\ndance and sing, but Bles wanted--\r\n\r\n\"Zora!\"\r\n\r\nThis time she heard the call, but did not heed it. Miss Taylor was very\r\ntiresome, and was forever doing and saying silly things. So Zora paid no\r\nattention, but sat still and thought. Yes, she would show Bles the place\r\nthat very night; she had kept it secret from him until now, out of\r\nperverseness, out of her love of mystery and secrets. But tonight, after\r\nschool, when he met her on the big road with the clothes, she would take\r\nhim and show him the chosen spot.\r\n\r\nSoon she was aware that school had been dismissed, and she leisurely\r\ngathered up her books and rose. Mary Taylor regarded her in perplexed\r\ndespair. Oh, these people! Mrs. Vanderpool was right: culture and--some\r\nmasses, at least--were not to be linked; and, too, culture and\r\nwork--were they incompatible? At any rate, culture and _this_ work were.\r\n\r\nNow, there was Mrs. Vanderpool--she toiled not, neither did she spin,\r\nand yet! If all these folk were like poor, stupid, docile Jennie it\r\nwould be simpler, but what earthly sense was there in trying do to\r\nanything with a girl like Zora, so stupid in some matters, so\r\nstartlingly bright in others, and so stubborn in everything? Here, she\r\nwas doing some work twice as well and twice as fast as the class, and\r\nother work she would not touch because she \"didn't like it.\" Her\r\nclassification in school was nearly as difficult as her classification\r\nin the world, and Miss Taylor reached up impatiently and removed the\r\ngold pin from her stock to adjust it more comfortably when Zora\r\nsauntered past unseeing, unheeding, with that curious gliding walk which\r\nMiss Taylor called stealthy. She laid the pin on the desk and on sudden\r\nimpulse spoke again to the girl as she arranged her neck trimmings.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" she said evenly, \"why didn't you come to class when I called?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't hear you,\" said Zora, looking at her full-eyed and telling the\r\nhalf-truth easily.\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor was sure Zora was lying, and she knew that she had lied to\r\nher on other occasions. Indeed, she had found lying customary in this\r\ncommunity, and she had a New England horror of it. She looked at Zora\r\ndisapprovingly, while Zora looked at her quite impersonally, but\r\nsteadily. Then Miss Taylor braced herself, mentally, and took the war\r\ninto Africa.\r\n\r\n\"Do you ever tell lies, Zora?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know that is a wicked, bad habit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because God hates them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does _you_ know He does?\" Zora's tone was still impersonal.\r\n\r\n\"He hates all evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why is lies evil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they make us deceive each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nZora bent forward and looked squarely into Miss Taylor's blue eyes. Miss\r\nTaylor looked into the velvet blackness of hers and wondered what they\r\nveiled.\r\n\r\n\"Is it wrong,\" asked Zora, \"to make believe you likes people when you\r\ndon't, when you'se afeared of them and thinks they may rub off and dirty\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--why--yes, if you--if you, deceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you lies sometimes, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor stared helplessly at the solemn eyes that seemed to look so\r\ndeeply into her.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps--I do, Zora; I'm sure I don't mean to, and--I hope God will\r\nforgive me.\"\r\n\r\nZora softened.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I reckon He will if He's a good God, because He'd know that lies\r\nlike that are heaps better than blabbing the truth right out. Only,\" she\r\nadded severely, \"you mustn't keep saying it's wicked to lie 'cause it\r\nain't. Sometimes I lies,\" she reflected pensively, \"and sometimes I\r\ndon't--it depends.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor forgot her collar, and fingered the pin on the desk. She\r\nfelt at once a desperate desire to know this girl better and to\r\nestablish her own authority. Yet how should she do it? She kept toying\r\nwith the pin, and Zora watched her. Then Miss Taylor said, absently:\r\n\r\n\"Zora, what do you propose to do when you grow up?\"\r\n\r\nZora considered.\r\n\r\n\"Think and walk--and rest,\" she concluded.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, what work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Work? Oh, I sha'n't work. I don't like work--do you?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor winced, wondering if the girl were lying again. She said\r\nquickly:\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes--that is, I like some kinds of work.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kinds?\"\r\n\r\nBut Miss Taylor refused to have the matter made personal, as Zora had a\r\ndisconcerting way of pointing all their discussions.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody likes some kinds of work,\" she insisted.\r\n\r\n\"If you likes it, it ain't work,\" declared Zora; but Mary Taylor\r\nproceeded around her circumscribed circle:\r\n\r\n\"You might make a good cook, or a maid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate cooking. What's a maid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, a woman who helps others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Helps folks that they love? I'd like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not a question of affection,\" said Miss Taylor, firmly: \"one is\r\npaid for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't work for pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you'll have to, child; you'll have to earn a living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you work for pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"I work to earn a living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same thing, I reckon, and it ain't true. Living just comes free,\r\nlike--like sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff! Zora, your people must learn to work and work steadily and work\r\nhard--\" She stopped, for she was sure Zora was not listening; the far\r\naway look was in her eyes and they were shining. She was beautiful as\r\nshe stood there--strangely, almost uncannily, but startlingly beautiful\r\nwith her rich dark skin, softly moulded features, and wonderful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"My people?--my people?\" she murmured, half to herself. \"Do you know my\r\npeople? They don't never work; they plays. They is all little, funny\r\ndark people. They flies and creeps and crawls, slippery-like; and they\r\ncries and calls. Ah, my people! my poor little people! they misses me\r\nthese days, because they is shadowy things that sing and smell and bloom\r\nin dark and terrible nights--\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor started up. \"Zora, I believe you're crazy!\" she cried. But\r\nZora was looking at her calmly again.\r\n\r\n\"We'se both crazy, ain't we?\" she returned, with a simplicity that left\r\nthe teacher helpless.\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor hurried out, forgetting her pin. Zora looked it over\r\nleisurely, and tried it on. She decided that she liked it, and putting\r\nit in her pocket, went out too.\r\n\r\nSchool was out but the sun was still high, as Bles hurried from the barn\r\nup the big road beside the soft shadows of the swamp. His head was busy\r\nwith new thoughts and his lips were whistling merrily, for today Zora\r\nwas to show him the long dreamed of spot for the planting of the Silver\r\nFleece. He hastened toward the Cresswell mansion, and glanced anxiously\r\nup the road. At last he saw her coming, swinging down the road, lithe\r\nand dark, with the big white basket of clothes poised on her head.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" he yodled, and she waved her apron.\r\n\r\nHe eased her burden to the ground and they sat down together, he\r\nnervous and eager; she silent, passive, but her eyes restless. Bles was\r\nfull of his plans.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" he said, \"we'll make it the finest bale ever raised in Tooms;\r\nwe'll just work it to the inch--just love it into life.\"\r\n\r\nShe considered the matter intently.\r\n\r\n\"But,\"--presently,--\"how can we sell it without the Cresswells knowing?\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't try; we'll just take it to them and give them half, like the\r\nother tenants.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the swamp is mortal thick and hard to clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can do it.\"\r\n\r\nZora had sat still, listening; but now, suddenly, she leapt to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" she said, \"I'll take the clothes home, then we'll go\"--she\r\nglanced at him--\"down where the dreams are.\" And laughing, they hurried\r\non.\r\n\r\nElspeth stood in the path that wound down to the cottage, and without a\r\nword Zora dropped the basket at her feet. She turned back; but Bles,\r\nstruck by a thought, paused. The old woman was short, broad, black and\r\nwrinkled, with yellow fangs, red hanging lips, and wicked eyes. She\r\nleered at them; the boy shrank before it, but stood his ground.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Elspeth,\" he began, \"Zora and I are going to plant and tend some\r\ncotton to pay for her schooling--just the very best cotton we can\r\nfind--and I heard\"--he hesitated,--\"I heard you had some wonderful\r\nseed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she mumbled, \"I'se got the seed--I'se got it--wonder seed, sowed\r\nwid the three spells of Obi in the old land ten tousand moons ago. But\r\nyou couldn't plant it,\" with a sudden shrillness, \"it would kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" Bles tried to object, but she waved him away.\r\n\r\n\"Git the ground--git the ground; dig it--pet it, and we'll see what\r\nwe'll see.\" And she disappeared.\r\n\r\nZora was not sure that it had been wise to tell their secret.\r\n\r\n\"I was going to steal the seed,\" she said. \"I knows where it is, and I\r\ndon't fear conjure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't steal, Zora,\" said Bles, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Zora quickly asked.\r\n\r\nBut before he answered, they both forgot; for their faces were turned\r\ntoward the wonder of the swamp. The golden sun was pouring floods of\r\nglory through the slim black trees, and the mystic sombre pools caught\r\nand tossed back the glow in darker, duller crimson. Long echoing cries\r\nleapt to and fro; silent footsteps crept hither and yonder; and the\r\ngirl's eyes gleamed with a wild new joy.\r\n\r\n\"The dreams!\" she cried. \"The dreams!\" And leaping ahead, she danced\r\nalong the shadowed path. He hastened after her, but she flew fast and\r\nfaster; he followed, laughing, calling, pleading. He saw her twinkling\r\nlimbs a-dancing as once he saw them dance in a halo of firelight; but\r\nnow the fire was the fire of the world. Her garments twined and flew in\r\nshadowy drapings about the perfect moulding of her young and dark\r\nhalf-naked figure. Her heavy hair had burst its fastenings and lay in\r\nstiffened, straggling masses, bending reluctantly to the breeze, like\r\ncurled smoke; while all about, the mad, wild singing rose and fell and\r\ntrembled, till his head whirled. He paused uncertainly at a parting of\r\nthe paths, crying:\r\n\r\n\"Zora! Zora!\" as for some lost soul. \"Zora! Zora!\" echoed the cry,\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the music fell; there came a long slow-growing silence; and\r\nthen, with a flutter, she was beside him again, laughing in his ears and\r\ncrying with mocking voice:\r\n\r\n\"Is you afeared, honey?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw in her eyes sweet yearnings, but could speak nothing. He could\r\nonly clasp her hand tightly, and again down they raced through the wood.\r\n\r\nAll at once the swamp changed and chilled to a dull grayness; tall,\r\ndull trees started down upon the murky waters; and long pendent\r\nstreamings of moss-like tears dripped from tree to earth. Slowly and\r\nwarily they threaded their way.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of the path, Zora?\" he once inquired anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I could find it asleep,\" she answered, skipping sure-footed onward. He\r\ncontinued to hold her hand tightly, and his own pace never slackened.\r\nAround them the gray and death-like wilderness darkened. They felt and\r\nsaw the cold white mist rising slowly from the ground, and waters\r\ngrowing blacker and broader.\r\n\r\nAt last they came to what seemed the end. Silently and dismally the\r\nhalf-dead forest, with its ghostly moss, lowered and darkened, and the\r\nblack waters spread into a great silent lake of slimy ooze. The dead\r\ntrunk of a fallen tree lay straight in front, torn and twisted, its top\r\nhidden yonder and mingled with impenetrable undergrowth.\r\n\r\n\"Where now, Zora?\" he cried.\r\n\r\nIn a moment she had slipped her hand away and was scrambling upon the\r\ntree trunk. The waters yawned murkily below.\r\n\r\n\"Careful! careful!\" he warned, struggling after her until she\r\ndisappeared amid the leaves. He followed eagerly, but cautiously; and\r\nall at once found himself confronting a paradise.\r\n\r\nBefore them lay a long island, opening to the south, on the black lake,\r\nbut sheltered north and east by the dense undergrowth of the black swamp\r\nand the rampart of dead and living trees. The soil was virgin and black,\r\nthickly covered over with a tangle of bushes, vines, and smaller growth\r\nall brilliant with early leaves and wild flowers.\r\n\r\n\"A pretty tough proposition for clearing and ploughing,\" said Bles, with\r\npractised eye. But Zora eagerly surveyed the prospect.\r\n\r\n\"It's where the Dreams lives,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nMeantime Miss Taylor had missed her brooch and searched for it in vain.\r\nIn the midst of this pursuit the truth occurred to her--Zora had stolen\r\nit. Negroes would steal, everybody said. Well, she must and would have\r\nthe pin, and she started for Elspeth's cabin.\r\n\r\nOn the way she met the old woman in the path, but got little\r\nsatisfaction. Elspeth merely grunted ungraciously while eyeing the white\r\nwoman with suspicion.\r\n\r\nMary Taylor, again alone, sat down at a turn in the path, just out of\r\nsight of the house, and waited. Soon she saw, with a certain grim\r\nsatisfaction, Zora and Bles emerging from the swamp engaged in earnest\r\nconversation. Here was an opportunity to overwhelm both with an\r\nunforgettable reprimand. She rose before them like a spectral vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"Zora, I want my pin.\"\r\n\r\nBles started and stared; but Zora eyed her calmly with something like\r\ndisdain.\r\n\r\n\"What pin?\" she returned, unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"Zora, don't deny that you took my pin from the desk this afternoon,\"\r\nthe teacher commanded severely.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say I didn't take no pin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Persons who will lie and steal will do anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't people do anything they wants to?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you knew the pin was mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw you a-wearing of it,\" admitted Zora easily.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have stolen it, and you are a thief.\"\r\n\r\nStill Zora appeared to be unimpressed with the heinousness of her fault.\r\n\r\n\"Did you make that pin?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, but it is mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is it yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it was given to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't need it; you've got four other prettier ones--I counted.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes no difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes it does--folks ain't got no right to things they don't need.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes no difference, Zora, and you know it. The pin is mine. You\r\nstole it. If you had wanted a pin and asked me I might have given you--\"\r\n\r\nThe girl blazed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want your old gifts,\" she almost hissed. \"You don't own what\r\nyou don't need and can't use. God owns it and I'm going to send it back\r\nto Him.\"\r\n\r\nWith a swift motion she whipped the pin from her pocket and raised her\r\narm to hurl it into the swamp. Bles caught her hand. He caught it\r\nlightly and smiled sorrowfully into her eyes. She wavered a moment, then\r\nthe answering light sprang to her face. Dropping the brooch into his\r\nhand, she wheeled and fled toward the cabin.\r\n\r\nBles handed it silently to Miss Taylor. Mary Taylor was beside herself\r\nwith impatient anger--and anger intensified by a conviction of utter\r\nhelplessness to cope with any strained or unusual situations between\r\nherself and these two.\r\n\r\n\"Alwyn,\" she said sharply, \"I shall report Zora for stealing. And you\r\nmay report yourself to Miss Smith tonight for disrespect toward a\r\nteacher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eight_\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. HARRY CRESSWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cresswells, father and son, were at breakfast. The daughter was\r\ntaking her coffee and rolls up stairs in bed.\r\n\r\n\"P'sh! I don't like it!\" declared Harry Cresswell, tossing the letter\r\nback to his father. \"I tell you, it is a damned Yankee trick.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a man of thirty-five, smooth and white, slight, well-bred and\r\nmasterful. His father, St. John Cresswell, was sixty, white-haired,\r\nmustached and goateed; a stately, kindly old man with a temper and much\r\nfamily pride.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" he said, his air half preoccupied, half unconcerned, \"I\r\nsuppose so--and yet\"--he read the letter again, aloud: \"'Approaching you\r\nas one of the most influential landowners of Alabama, on a confidential\r\nmatter'--h'm--h'm--'a combination of capital and power, such as this\r\nnation has never seen'--'cotton manufacturers and cotton growers.' ...\r\nWell, well! Of course, I suppose there's nothing in it. And yet, Harry,\r\nmy boy, this cotton-growing business is getting in a pretty tight pinch.\r\nUnless relief comes somehow--well, we'll just have to quit. We simply\r\ncan't keep the cost of cotton down to a remunerative figure with niggers\r\ngetting scarcer and dearer. Every year I have to pinch 'em closer and\r\ncloser. I had to pay Maxwell two hundred and fifty to get that old darky\r\nand his boys turned over to me, and one of the young ones has run away\r\nalready.\"\r\n\r\nHarry lighted a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"We must drive them more. You're too easy, father; they understand that.\r\nBy the way, what did that letter say about a 'sister'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Says he's got a sister over at the nigger school whom perhaps we know.\r\nI suppose he thinks we dine there occasionally.\" The old man chuckled.\r\n\"That reminds me, Elspeth is sending her girl there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" An angry gleam shot into the younger man's eye.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She announced this morning, pert as you please, that she couldn't\r\ntote clothes any more--she had to study.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn it! This thing is going too far. We can't keep a maid or a\r\nplough-boy on the place because of this devilish school. It's going to\r\nruin the whole labor system. We've been too mild and decent. I'm going\r\nto put my foot down right here. I'll make Elspeth take that girl out of\r\nschool if I have to horse-whip her, and I'll warn the school against\r\nfurther interference with our tenants. Here, in less than a week, go two\r\nplough-hands--and now this girl.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled.\r\n\r\n\"You'll hardly miss any work Zora does,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'll make her work. She's giving herself too many damned airs. I know\r\nwho's back of this--it's that nigger we saw talking to the white woman\r\nin the field the other day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't work yourself up. The wench don't amount to much anyhow. By\r\nthe way, though, if you do go to the school it won't hurt to see this\r\nTaylor's sister and size the family up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! I'm going to give the Smith woman such a scare that she'll keep\r\nher hands off our niggers.\" And Harry Cresswell rode away.\r\n\r\nMary Taylor had charge of the office that morning, while Miss Smith,\r\nshut up in her bedroom, went laboriously over her accounts. Miss Mary\r\nsuddenly sat up, threw a hasty glance into the glass and felt the back\r\nof her belt. It was--it couldn't be--surely, it was Mr. Harry Cresswell\r\nriding through the gateway on his beautiful white mare. He kicked the\r\ngate open rather viciously, did not stop to close it, and rode straight\r\nacross the lawn. Miss Taylor noticed his riding breeches and leggings,\r\nhis white linen and white, clean-cut, high-bred face. Such apparitions\r\nwere few about the country lands. She felt inclined to flutter, but\r\ngripped herself.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning,\" she said, a little stiffly.\r\n\r\nMr. Cresswell halted and stared; then lifting the hat which he had\r\nneglected to remove in crossing the hall, he bowed in stately grace.\r\nMiss Taylor was no ordinary picture. Her brown hair was almost golden;\r\nher dark eyes shone blue; her skin was clear and healthy, and her white\r\ndress--happy coincidence!--had been laundered that very morning. Her\r\nhalf-suppressed excitement at the sudden duty of welcoming the great\r\naristocrat of the county, gave a piquancy to her prettiness.\r\n\r\n\"The--devil!\" commented Mr. Harry Cresswell to himself. But to Miss\r\nTaylor:\r\n\r\n\"I beg pardon--er--Miss Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--I'm sorry. Miss Smith is engaged this morning. I am Miss Taylor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot share Miss Taylor's sorrow,\" returned Mr. Cresswell gravely,\r\n\"for I believe I have the honor of some correspondence with Miss\r\nTaylor's brother.\" Mr. Cresswell searched for the letter, but did not\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Has John written you?\" She beamed suddenly. \"I'm so glad. It's more\r\nthan he's done for me this three-month. I beg your pardon--do sit\r\ndown--I think you'll find this one easier. Our stock of chairs is\r\nlimited.\"\r\n\r\nIt was delightful to have a casual meeting receive this social stamp;\r\nthe girl was all at once transfigured--animated, glowing, lovely; all of\r\nwhich did not escape the caller's appraising inspection.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said Mr. Cresswell. \"I've left your gate gaping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't mind ... I hope John's well?\"\r\n\r\n\"The truth is,\" confessed Cresswell, \"it was a business matter--cotton,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"John is nothing but cotton; I tell him his soul is fibrous.\"\r\n\r\n\"He mentioned your being here and I thought I'd drop over and welcome\r\nyou to the South.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" returned Miss Taylor, reddening with pleasure despite\r\nherself. There was a real sincerity in the tone. All this confirmed so\r\nmany convictions of hers.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, you know how it is in the South,\" Cresswell pursued, the\r\nopening having been so easily accomplished.\r\n\r\n\"I understand perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"My sister would be delighted to meet you, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh I realize the--difficulties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you wouldn't mind riding by some day--it's embarrassing to\r\nsuggest this, but, you know--\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor was perfectly self-possessed.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cresswell,\" she said seriously, \"I know very well that it wouldn't\r\ndo for your sister to call here, and I sha'n't mind a bit coming by to\r\nsee her first. I don't believe in standing on stupid ceremony.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell thanked her with quiet cordiality, and suggested that when he\r\nwas driving by he might pick her up in his gig some morning. Miss Taylor\r\nexpressed her pleasure at the prospect. Then the talk wandered to\r\ngeneral matters--the rain, the trees, the people round about, and,\r\ninevitably--the Negro.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, by the bye,\" said Mr. Cresswell, frowning and hesitating over the\r\nrecollection of his errand's purpose, \"there was one matter\"--he paused.\r\nMiss Taylor leant forward, all interest. \"I hardly know that I ought to\r\nmention it, but your school--\"\r\n\r\nThis charming young lady disarmed his truculent spirit, and the usually\r\ncollected and determined young man was at a loss how to proceed. The\r\ngirl, however, was obviously impressed and pleased by his evidence of\r\ninterest, whatever its nature; so in a manner vastly different from the\r\none he had intended to assume, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"There is a way in which we may be of service to you, and that is by\r\nenlightening you upon points concerning which the nature of your\r\nposition--both as teacher and socially--must keep you in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"For instance, all these Negroes are, as you know, of wretchedly low\r\nmorals; but there are a few so depraved that it would be suicidal to\r\ntake them into this school. We recognize the good you are doing, but we\r\ndo not want it more than offset by utter lack of discrimination in\r\nchoosing your material.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not--have we--\" Miss Mary faltered. This beginning was a bit\r\nominous, wholly unexpected.\r\n\r\n\"There is a girl, Zora, who has just entered, who--I must speak\r\ncandidly--who ought not to be here; I thought it but right to let you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, so much. I'll tell Miss Smith.\" Mary Taylor suddenly felt\r\nherself a judge of character. \"I suspected that she was--not what she\r\nought to be. Believe me, we appreciate your interest.\"\r\n\r\nA few more words, and Mr. Cresswell, after bending courteously over her\r\nhand with a deference no New Englander had ever shown, was riding away\r\non his white mare.\r\n\r\nFor a while Mary Taylor sat very quietly. It was like a breath of air\r\nfrom the real world, this hour's chat with a well-bred gentleman. She\r\nwondered how she had done her part--had she been too eager and\r\nschool-girlish? Had she met this stately ceremony with enough breeding\r\nto show that she too was somebody? She pounced upon Miss Smith the\r\nminute that lady entered the office.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith, who do you think has been here?\" she burst out\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"I saw him on the lawn.\" There was a suspicious lack of warmth in this\r\nbrief affirmation.\r\n\r\n\"He was so gracious and kindly, and he knows my brother. And oh, Miss\r\nSmith! we've got to send that Zora right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed\"--the observation was not even interrogatory. The preceptress of\r\nthe struggling school for Negro children merely evinced patience for the\r\nyounger woman's fervency.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he says she's utterly depraved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Said that, did he?\" Miss Smith watched her with tranquil regard. Miss\r\nTaylor paused.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, we cannot think of keeping her.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith pursed her lips, offering her first expression of opinion.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we'll worry along with her a little while anyhow,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe girl stared at Miss Smith in honest, if unpardonable, amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that you are going to keep in this school a girl who\r\nnot only lies and steals but is positively--_immoral_?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith smiled, wholly unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"No; but I mean that _I_ am here to learn from those whose ideas of\r\nright do not agree with mine, to discover _why_ they differ, and to let\r\nthem learn of me--so far as I am worthy.\"\r\n\r\nMary Taylor was not unappreciative of Miss Smith's stern\r\nhigh-mindedness, but her heart hardened at this, to her, misdirected\r\nzeal. Echo of the spirit of an older day, Miss Smith seemed, to her, to\r\nbe cramped and paralyzed in an armor of prejudice and sectionalisms.\r\nPlain-speaking was the only course, and Mary, if a little complacent\r\nperhaps in her frankness, was sincere in her purpose.\r\n\r\n\"I think, Miss Smith, you are making a very grave mistake. I regard\r\nZora as a very undesirable person from every point of view. I look upon\r\nMr. Cresswell's visit today as almost providential. He came offering an\r\nolive branch from the white aristocracy to this work; to bespeak his\r\nappreciation and safeguard the future. Moreover,\" and Miss Taylor's\r\nvoice gathered firmness despite Miss Smith's inscrutable eye, \"moreover,\r\nI have reason to know that the disposition--indeed, the plan--in certain\r\nquarters to help this work materially depends very largely on your\r\nwillingness to meet the advances of the Southern whites half way.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused for a reply or a question. Receiving neither, she walked with\r\ndignity up the stairs. From her window she could see Cresswell's\r\nstraight shoulders, as he rode toward town, and beyond him a black speck\r\nin the road. But she could not see the smile on Mr. Cresswell's lips,\r\nnor did she hear him remark twice, with seeming irrelevance, \"The\r\ndevil!\"\r\n\r\nThe rider, being closer to it, recognized in Mary Taylor's \"black speck\"\r\nBles Alwyn walking toward him rapidly with axe and hoe on shoulder,\r\nwhistling merrily. They saw each other almost at the same moment and\r\nwhistle and smile faded. Mr. Cresswell knew the Negro by sight and\r\ndisliked him. He belonged in his mind to that younger class of\r\nhalf-educated blacks who were impudent and disrespectful toward their\r\nsuperiors, not even touching his hat when he met a white man. Moreover,\r\nhe was sure that it was Miss Taylor with whom this boy had been talking\r\nso long and familiarly in the cotton-field last Spring--an offence\r\ndoubly heinous now that he had seen Miss Taylor.\r\n\r\nHis first impulse was to halt the Negro then and there and tell him a\r\nfew plain truths. But he did not feel quarrelsome at the moment, and\r\nthere was, after all, nothing very tangible to justify a berating. The\r\nfellow's impudence was sure to increase, and then! So he merely reined\r\nhis horse to the better part of the foot-path and rode on.\r\n\r\nBles, too, was thinking. He knew the well-dressed man with his\r\nmilk-white face and overbearing way. He would expect to be greeted with\r\nraised hat but Bles bit his lips and pulled down his cap firmly. The\r\naxe, too, in some indistinct way felt good in his hand. He saw the horse\r\ncoming in his pathway and stepping aside in the dust continued on his\r\nway, neither looking nor speaking.\r\n\r\nSo they passed each other by, Mr. Cresswell to town, Bles to the swamp,\r\napparently ignorant of each other's very existence. Yet, as the space\r\nwidened between them, each felt a more vindictive anger for the other.\r\n\r\nHow dares the black puppy to ignore a Cresswell on the highway? If this\r\nwent on, the day would surely come when Negroes felt no respect or fear\r\nwhatever for whites? And then--my God! Mr. Cresswell struck his mare a\r\nvicious blow and dashed toward town.\r\n\r\nThe black boy, too, went his way in silent, burning rage. Why should he\r\nbe elbowed into the roadside dust by an insolent bully? Why had he not\r\nstood his ground? Pshaw! All this fine frenzy was useless, and he knew\r\nit. The sweat oozed on his forehead. It wasn't man against man, or he\r\nwould have dragged the pale puppy from his horse and rubbed his face in\r\nthe earth. It wasn't even one against many, else how willingly, swinging\r\nhis axe, would have stood his ground before a mob.\r\n\r\nNo, it was one against a world, a world of power, opinion, wealth,\r\nopportunity; and he, the one, must cringe and bear in silence lest the\r\nworld crash about the ears of his people. He slowly plodded on in bitter\r\nsilence toward the swamp. But the day was balmy, the way was beautiful;\r\ncontempt slowly succeeded anger, and hope soon triumphed over all. For\r\nyonder was Zora, poised, waiting. And behind her lay the Field of\r\nDreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nine_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTING\r\n\r\n\r\nZora looked down upon Bles, where he stood to his knees in mud. The toil\r\nwas beyond exhilaration--it was sickening weariness and panting despair.\r\nThe great roots, twined in one unbroken snarl, clung frantically to the\r\nblack soil. The vines and bushes fought back with thorn and bramble.\r\nZora stood wiping the blood from her hands and staring at Bles. She saw\r\nthe long gnarled fingers of the tough little trees and they looked like\r\nthe fingers of Elspeth down there beneath the earth pulling against the\r\nboy. Slowly Zora forgot her blood and pain. Who would win--the witch, or\r\nJason?\r\n\r\nBles looked up and saw the bleeding hands. With a bound he was beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Zora!\" The cry seemed wrung from his heart by contrition. Why had he\r\nnot known--not seen before! \"Zora, come right out of this! Sit down here\r\nand rest.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him unwaveringly; there was no flinching of her spirit.\r\n\r\n\"I sha'n't do it,\" she said. \"You'se working, and I'se going to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--Zora--you're not used to such work, and I am. You're tired out.\"\r\n\r\n\"So is you,\" was her reply.\r\n\r\nHe looked himself over ruefully, and dropping his axe, sat down beside\r\nher on a great log. Silently they contemplated the land; it seemed\r\nindeed a hopeless task. Then they looked at each other in sudden,\r\nunspoken fear of failure.\r\n\r\n\"If we only had a mule!\" he sighed. Immediately her face lighted and her\r\nlips parted, but she said nothing. He presently bounded to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Zora. To-morrow is Saturday, and I'll work all day. We just\r\n_will_ get it done--sometime.\" His mouth closed with determination.\r\n\r\n\"We won't work any more today, then?\" cried Zora, her eagerness\r\nbetraying itself despite her efforts to hide it.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ won't,\" affirmed Bles. \"But I've got to do just a little--\"\r\n\r\nBut Zora was adamant: he was tired; she was tired; they would rest.\r\nTo-morrow with the rising sun they would begin again.\r\n\r\n\"There'll be a bright moon tonight,\" ventured Bles.\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll come too,\" Zora announced positively, and he had to promise\r\nfor her sake to rest.\r\n\r\nThey went up the path together and parted diffidently, he watching her\r\nflit away with sorrowful eyes, a little disturbed and puzzled at the\r\nburden he had voluntarily assumed, but never dreaming of drawing back.\r\n\r\nZora did not go far. No sooner did she know herself well out of his\r\nsight than she dropped lightly down beside the path, listening intently\r\nuntil the last echo of his footsteps had died away. Then, leaving the\r\ncabin on her right, and the scene of their toil on her left, she cut\r\nstraight through the swamp, skirted the big road, and in a half-hour\r\nwas in the lower meadows of the Cresswell plantations, where the tired\r\nstock was being turned out to graze for the night. Here, in the shadow\r\nof the wood, she lingered. Slowly, but with infinite patience, she broke\r\none strand after another of the barbed-wire fencing, watching, the\r\nwhile, the sun grow great and crimson, and die at last in mighty\r\nsplendor behind the dimmer westward forests.\r\n\r\nThe voices of the hands and hostlers grew fainter and thinner in the\r\ndistance of purple twilight until the last of them disappeared. Silence\r\nfell, deep and soft; the silence of a day sinking to sleep. Not until\r\nthen did Zora steal forth from her hiding-place.\r\n\r\nShe had chosen her mule long before--a big, black beast, snorting over\r\nhis pile of corn,--and gliding up to him, she gathered his supper into\r\nher skirt, found a stout halter, and fed him sparingly as he followed\r\nher. Quickly she unfastened the pieces of the fence, led the animal\r\nthrough, and spliced them again; and then, with fox-like caution, she\r\nguided her prize through the labyrinthine windings of the swamp. It was\r\ndark and haunting, and ever and again rose lonely night cries. The girl\r\ntrembled a little, but plodded resolutely on until the dim silver disk\r\nof the half-moon began to glimmer through the trees. Then she pressed on\r\nmore swiftly, and fed more scantily, until finally, with the moonlight\r\npouring over them at the black lagoon, Zora attempted to drive the\r\nanimal into the still waters; but he gave a loud protesting snort and\r\nbalked. By subtle temptings she gave him to understand that plenty lay\r\nbeyond the dark waters, and quickly swinging herself to his back she\r\nstarted to ride him up and down along the edge of the lagoon, petting\r\nand whispering to him of good things beyond. Slowly her eyes grew wide;\r\nshe seemed to be riding out of dreamland on some hobgoblin beast.\r\n\r\nDeeper and deeper they penetrated into the dark waters. Now they entered\r\nthe slime; now they stumbled on hidden roots; but deeper and deeper they\r\nwaded until at last, turning the animal's head with a jerk, and giving\r\nhim a sharp stroke of the whip, she headed straight for the island. A\r\nmoment the beast snorted and plunged; higher and higher the black still\r\nwaters rose round the girl. They crept up her little limbs, swirled\r\nround her breasts and gleamed green and slimy along her shoulders. A\r\nwild terror gripped her. Maybe she was riding the devil's horse, and\r\nthese were the yawning gates of hell, black and sombre beneath the cold,\r\ndead radiance of the moon. She saw again the gnarled and black and\r\nclaw-like fingers of Elspeth gripping and dragging her down.\r\n\r\nA scream struggled in her breast, her fingers relaxed, and the big\r\nbeast, stretching his cramped neck, rose in one mighty plunge and\r\nplanted his feet on the sand of the island.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBles, hurrying down in the morning with new tools and new determination,\r\nstopped and stared in blank amazement. Zora was perched in a tree\r\nsinging softly and beneath a fat black mule was finishing his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Zora--\" he gasped, \"how--how did you do it?\"\r\n\r\nShe only smiled and sang a happier measure, pausing only to whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Dreams--dreams--it's all dreams here, I tells you.\"\r\n\r\nBles frowned and stood irresolute. The song proceeded with less\r\nassurance, slower and lower, till it stopped, and the singer dropped to\r\nthe ground, watching him with wide eyes. He looked down at her, slight,\r\ntired, scratched, but undaunted, striving blindly toward the light with\r\nstanch, unfaltering faith. A pity surged in his heart. He put his arm\r\nabout her shoulders and murmured:\r\n\r\n\"You poor, brave child.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she shivered with joy.\r\n\r\nAll day Saturday and part of Sunday they worked feverishly. The trees\r\ncrashed and the stumps groaned and crept up into the air, the brambles\r\nblazed and smoked; little frightened animals fled for shelter; and a\r\nwide black patch of rich loam broadened and broadened till it kissed,\r\non every side but the sheltered east, the black waters of the lagoon.\r\nLate Sunday night the mule again swam the slimy lagoon, and disappeared\r\ntoward the Cresswell fields. Then Bles sat down beside Zora, facing the\r\nfields, and gravely took her hand. She looked at him in quick,\r\nbreathless fear.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" he said, \"sometimes you tell lies, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said slowly; \"sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, Zora, sometimes you steal--you stole the pin from Miss Taylor, and\r\nwe stole Mr. Cresswell's mule for two days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said faintly, with a perplexed wrinkle in her brows, \"I stole\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Zora, I don't want you ever to tell another lie, or ever to take\r\nanything that doesn't belong to you.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him silently with the shadow of something like terror far\r\nback in the depths of her deep eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Always--tell--the truth?\" she repeated slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHer fingers worked nervously.\r\n\r\n\"All the truth?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe thought a while.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he finally, \"it is not necessary always to tell all the\r\ntruth; but never tell anything that isn't the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if it hurts me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if it hurts. God is good, He will not let it hurt much.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a fair God, ain't He?\" she mused, scanning the evening sky.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--He's fair, He wouldn't take advantage of a little girl that did\r\nwrong, when she didn't know it was wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHer face lightened and she held his hands in both hers, and said\r\nsolemnly as though saying a prayer:\r\n\r\n\"I won't lie any more, and I won't steal--and--\" she looked at him in\r\nstartled wistfulness--he remembered it in after years; but he felt he\r\nhad preached enough.\r\n\r\n\"And now for the seed!\" he interrupted joyously. \"And then--the Silver\r\nFleece!\"\r\n\r\nThat night, for the first time, Bles entered Zora's home. It was a\r\nsingle low, black room, smoke-shadowed and dirty, with two dingy beds\r\nand a gaping fire-place. On one side of the fire-place sat the yellow\r\nwoman, young, with traces of beauty, holding the white child in her\r\narms; on the other, hugging the blaze, huddled a formless heap, wreathed\r\nin coils of tobacco smoke--Elspeth, Zora's mother.\r\n\r\nZora said nothing, but glided in and stood in the shadows.\r\n\r\n\"Good-evening,\" said Bles cheerily. The woman with the baby alone\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\n\"I came for the seed you promised us--the cotton-seed.\"\r\n\r\nThe hag wheeled and approached him swiftly, grasping his shoulders and\r\ntwisting her face into his. She was a horrible thing--filthy of breath,\r\ndirty, with dribbling mouth and red eyes. Her few long black teeth hung\r\nloosely like tusks and the folds of fat on her chin curled down on her\r\ngreat neck. Bles shuddered and stepped back.\r\n\r\n\"Is you afeared, honey?\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said sturdily.\r\n\r\nShe chuckled drily. \"Yes, you is--everybody's 'feared of old Elspeth;\r\nbut she won't hurt you--you's got the spell;\" and wheeling again, she\r\nwas back at the fire.\r\n\r\n\"But the seed?\" he ventured.\r\n\r\nShe pointed impressively roofward. \"The dark of the moon, boy, the dark\r\nof the moon--the first dark--at midnight.\" Bles could not wring another\r\nword from her; nor did the ancient witch, by word or look, again give\r\nthe slightest indication that she was aware of his presence.\r\n\r\nWith reluctant farewell, Bles turned home. For a space Zora watched him,\r\nand once she started after him, but came slowly back, and sat by the\r\nfire-place.\r\n\r\nOut of the night came voices and laughter, and the sound of wheels and\r\ngalloping horses. It was not the soft, rollicking laughter of black men,\r\nbut the keener, more metallic sound of white men's cries, and Bles Alwyn\r\npaused at the edge of the wood, looked back and hesitated, but decided\r\nafter a moment to go home and to bed.\r\n\r\nZora, however, leapt to her feet and fled into the night, while the hag\r\nscreamed after her and cursed. There was tramping of feet on the cabin\r\nfloor, and loud voices and singing and cursing.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Zora?\" some one yelled, with an oath. \"Damn it! where is she? I\r\nhaven't seen her for a year, you old devil.\"\r\n\r\nThe hag whimpered and snarled. Far down in the field of the Fleece, Zora\r\nlay curled beneath a tall dark tree asleep. All night there was coming\r\nand going in the cabin; the talk and laughter grew loud and boisterous,\r\nand the red fire glared in the night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe days flew by and the moon darkened. In the swamp, the hidden island\r\nlay spaded and bedded, and Bles was throwing up a dyke around the edge;\r\nZora helped him until he came to the black oak at the western edge. It\r\nwas a large twisted thing with one low flying limb that curled out\r\nacross another tree and made a mighty seat above the waters.\r\n\r\n\"Don't throw the dirt too high there,\" she begged; \"it'll bring my seat\r\ntoo near the earth.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's a throne,\" he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"It needs a roof,\" he whimsically told her when his day's work was done.\r\nDeftly twisting and intertwining the branches of tree and bush, he wove\r\na canopy of living green that shadowed the curious nest and warded it\r\nsnugly from wind and water.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning Bles slipped down and improved the nest; adding\r\nfoot-rests to make the climbing easy, peep-holes east and west, a bit\r\nof carpet over the bark, and on the rough main trunk, a little picture\r\nin blue and gold of Bougereau's Madonna. Zora sat hidden and alone in\r\nsilent ecstasy. Bles peeped in--there was not room to enter: the girl\r\nwas staring silently at the Madonna. She seemed to feel rather than hear\r\nhis presence, and she inquired softly:\r\n\r\n\"Who's it, Bles?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mother of God,\" he answered reverently.\r\n\r\n\"And why does she hold a lily?\"\r\n\r\n\"It stands for purity--she was a good woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"With a baby,\" Zora added slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--\" said Bles, and then more quickly--\"It is the Christ Child--God's\r\nbaby.\"\r\n\r\n\"God is the father of all the little babies, ain't He, Bles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes--yes, of course; only this little baby didn't have any other\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know one like that,\" she said,--and then she added softly: \"Poor\r\nlittle Christ-baby.\"\r\n\r\nBles hesitated, and before he found words Zora was saying:\r\n\r\n\"How white she is; she's as white as the lily, Bles; but--I'm sorry\r\nshe's white--Bles, what's purity--just whiteness?\"\r\n\r\nBles glanced at her awkwardly but she was still staring wide-eyed at the\r\npicture, and her voice was earnest. She was now so old and again so much\r\na child, an eager questioning child, that there seemed about her\r\ninnocence something holy.\r\n\r\n\"It means,\" he stammered, groping for meanings--\"it means being\r\ngood--just as good as a woman knows how.\"\r\n\r\nShe wheeled quickly toward him and asked him eagerly:\r\n\r\n\"Not better--not better than she knows, but just as good, in--lying and\r\nstealing and--and everything?\"\r\n\r\nBles smiled.\r\n\r\n\"No--not better than she knows, but just as good.\"\r\n\r\nShe trembled happily.\r\n\r\n\"I'm--pure,\" she said, with a strange little breaking voice and\r\ngesture. A sob struggled in his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you are,\" he whispered tenderly, hiding her little hands in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\"I--I was so afraid--sometimes--that I wasn't,\" she whispered, lifting\r\nup to him her eyes streaming with tears. Silently he kissed her lips.\r\n\r\nFrom that day on they walked together in a new world. No revealing word\r\nwas spoken; no vows were given, none asked for; but a new bond held\r\nthem. She grew older, quieter, taller, he humbler, more tender and\r\nreverent, as they toiled together.\r\n\r\nSo the days passed. The sun burned in the heavens; but the silvered\r\nglory of the moon grew fainter and fainter and each night it rose later\r\nthan the night before. Then one day Zora whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Tonight!\"\r\n\r\nBles came to the cabin, and he and Zora and Elspeth sat silently around\r\nthe fire-place with its meagre embers. The night was balmy and still;\r\nonly occasionally a wandering breeze searching the hidden places of the\r\nswamp, or the call and song of night birds, jarred the stillness. Long\r\nthey sat, until the silence crept into Bles's flesh, and stretching out\r\nhis hand, he touched Zora's, clasping it.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the old woman rose and hobbled to a big black chest. Out of\r\nit she brought an old bag of cotton seed--not the white-green seed which\r\nBles had always known, but small, smooth black seeds, which she handled\r\ncarefully, dipping her hands deep down and letting them drop through her\r\ngnarled fingers. And so again they sat and waited and waited, saying no\r\nword.\r\n\r\nNot until the stars of midnight had swung to the zenith did they start\r\ndown through the swamp. Bles sought to guide the old woman, but he found\r\nshe knew the way better than he did. Her shadowy figure darting in and\r\nout among the trunks till they crossed the tree bridge, moved ever\r\nnoiselessly ahead.\r\n\r\nShe motioned the boy and girl away to the thicket at the edge, and\r\nstood still and black in the midst of the cleared island. Bles slipped\r\nhis arm protectingly around Zora, glancing fearfully about in the\r\ndarkness. Slowly a great cry rose and swept the island. It struck madly\r\nand sharply, and then died away to uneasy murmuring. From afar there\r\nseemed to come the echo or the answer to the call. The form of Elspeth\r\nblurred the night dimly far off, almost disappearing, and then growing\r\nblacker and larger. They heard the whispering \"_swish-swish_\" of falling\r\nseed; they felt the heavy tread of a great coming body. The form of the\r\nold woman suddenly loomed black above them, hovering a moment formless\r\nand vast then fading again away, and the \"_swish-swish_\" of the falling\r\nseed alone rose in the silence of the night.\r\n\r\nAt last all was still. A long silence. Then again the air seemed\r\nsuddenly filled with that great and awful cry; its echoing answer\r\nscreamed afar and they heard the raucous voice of Elspeth beating in\r\ntheir ears:\r\n\r\n_\"De seed done sowed! De seed done sowed!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ten_\r\n\r\nMR. TAYLOR CALLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thinking the matter over,\" said Harry Cresswell to his father, \"I'm\r\ninclined to advise drawing this Taylor out a little further.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel puffed his cigar and one eye twinkled, the lid of the other\r\nbeing at the moment suggestively lowered.\r\n\r\n\"Was she pretty?\" he asked; but his son ignored the remark, and the\r\nfather continued:\r\n\r\n\"I had a telegram from Taylor this morning, after you left. He'll be\r\npassing through Montgomery the first of next month, and proposes\r\ncalling.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll wire him to come,\" said Harry, promptly.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the door opened and a young lady entered. Helen\r\nCresswell was twenty, small and pretty, with a slightly languid air.\r\nOutside herself there was little in which she took very great interest,\r\nand her interest in herself was not absorbing. Yet she had a curiously\r\nsweet way. Her servants liked her and the tenants could count on her\r\nspasmodic attentions in time of sickness and trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning,\" she said, with a soft drawl. She sauntered over to her\r\nfather, kissed him, and hung over the back of his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get that novel for me, Harry?\"--expectantly regarding her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\"I forgot it, Sis. But I'll be going to town again soon.\"\r\n\r\nThe young lady showed that she was annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"By the bye, Sis, there's a young lady over at the Negro school whom I\r\nthink you'd like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Black or white?\"\r\n\r\n\"A young lady, I said. Don't be sarcastic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard you. I did not know whether you were using our language or\r\nothers'.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's really unusual, and seems to understand things. She's planning to\r\ncall some day--shall you be at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, Harry; you're crazy.\" And she strolled out to the porch,\r\nexchanged some remarks with a passing servant, and then nestled\r\ncomfortably into a hammock. She helped herself to a chocolate and called\r\nout musically:\r\n\r\n\"Pa, are you going to town today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going in an hour or so, and business at the bank will keep me until\r\nafter lunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care, I just must go. I'm clean out of anything to read. And I\r\nwant to shop and call on Dolly's friend--she's going soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Can you be ready by eleven?\"\r\n\r\nShe considered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I reckon,\" she drawled, prettily swinging her foot and watching\r\nthe tree-tops above the distant swamp.\r\n\r\nHarry Cresswell, left alone, rang the bell for the butler.\r\n\r\n\"Still thinking of going, are you, Sam?\" asked Cresswell, carelessly,\r\nwhen the servant appeared. He was a young, light-brown boy, his manner\r\nobsequious.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, sir--if you can spare me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spare you, you black rascal! You're going anyhow. Well, you'll repent\r\nit; the North is no place for niggers. See here, I want lunch for two at\r\none o'clock.\" The directions that followed were explicit and given with\r\na particularity that made Sam wonder. \"Order my trap,\" he finally\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nCresswell went out on the high-pillared porch until the trap appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Harry! I wanted to go in the trap--take me?\" coaxed his sister.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Sis, but I'm going the other way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Miss Cresswell, easily, as she settled down\r\nto another chocolate. Cresswell did not take the trouble to reply.\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor was on her morning walk when she saw him spinning down the\r\nroad, and both expressed surprise and pleasure at the meeting.\r\n\r\n\"What a delightful morning!\" said the school-teacher, and the glow on\r\nher face said even more.\r\n\r\n\"I'm driving round through the old plantation,\" he explained; \"won't you\r\njoin me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The invitation is tempting,\" she hesitated; \"but I've got just oodles\r\nof work.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! on Saturday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Saturday is my really busy day, don't you know. I guess I could get\r\noff; really, though, I suspect I ought to tell Miss Smith.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked a little perplexed; but the direction in which her\r\ninclinations lay was quite clear to him.\r\n\r\n\"It--it would be decidedly the proper thing,\" he murmured, \"and we\r\ncould, of course, invite Miss--\"\r\n\r\nShe saw the difficulty and interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\"It's quite unnecessary; she'll think I have simply gone for a long\r\nwalk.\" And soon they were speeding down the silent road, breathing the\r\nperfume of the pines.\r\n\r\nNow a ride of an early spring morning, in Alabama, over a leisurely old\r\nplantation road and behind a spirited horse, is an event to be enjoyed.\r\nAdd to this a man bred to be agreeable and outdoing his training, and a\r\npretty girl gay with new-found companionship--all this is apt to make a\r\nmorning worth remembering.\r\n\r\nThey turned off the highway and passed through long stretches of\r\nploughed and tumbled fields, and other fields brown with the dead ghosts\r\nof past years' cotton standing straggling and weather-worn. Long,\r\nstraight, or curling rows of ploughers passed by with steaming,\r\nstruggling mules, with whips snapping and the yodle of workers or the\r\nsharp guttural growl of overseers as a constant accompaniment.\r\n\r\n\"They're beginning to plough up the land for the cotton-crop,\" he\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\"What a wonderful crop it is!\" Mary had fallen pensive.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed--if only we could get decent returns for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I thought it was a most valuable crop.\" She turned to him\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"It is--to Negroes and manufacturers, but not to planters.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why don't the planters do something?\"\r\n\r\n\"What can be done with Negroes?\" His tone was bitter. \"We tried to\r\ncombine against manufacturers in the Farmers' League of last winter. My\r\nfather was president. The pastime cost him fifty thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor was perplexed, but eager. \"You must correspond with my\r\nbrother, Mr. Cresswell,\" she gravely observed. \"I'm sure he--\" Before\r\nshe could finish, an overseer rode up. He began talking abruptly, with a\r\nquick side-glance at Mary, in which she might have caught a gleam of\r\nsurprised curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"That old nigger, Jim Sykes, over on the lower place, sir, ain't showed\r\nup again this morning.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell nodded. \"I'll drive by and see,\" he said carelessly.\r\n\r\nThe old man was discovered sitting before his cabin with his head in\r\nhis hands. He was tall, black, and gaunt, partly bald, with tufted hair.\r\nOne leg was swathed in rags, and his eyes, as he raised them, wore a\r\ncowed and furtive look.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Uncle Jim, why aren't you at work?\" called Cresswell from the\r\nroadside. The old man rose painfully to his feet, swayed against the\r\ncabin, and clutched off his cap.\r\n\r\n\"It's my leg again, Master Harry--the leg what I hurt in the gin last\r\nfall,\" he answered, uneasily.\r\n\r\nCresswell frowned. \"It's probably whiskey,\" he assured his companion, in\r\nan undertone; then to the man:\r\n\r\n\"You must get to the field to-morrow,\"--his habitually calm, unfeeling\r\npositiveness left no ground for objection; \"I cannot support you in\r\nidleness, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master Harry,\" the other returned, with conciliatory eagerness; \"I\r\nknows that--I knows it and I ain't shirking. But, Master Harry, they\r\nain't doing me right 'bout my cabin--I just wants to show you.\" He got\r\nout some dirty papers, and started to hobble forward, wincing with pain.\r\nMary Taylor stirred in her seat under an involuntary impulse to help,\r\nbut Cresswell touched the horse.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Uncle Jim,\" he said; \"we'll look it over to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned presently to where they could see the Cresswell oaks waving\r\nlazily in the sunlight and the white gleam of the pillared \"Big House.\"\r\n\r\nA pause at the Cresswell store, where Mr. Cresswell entered, afforded\r\nMary Taylor an opportunity further to extend her fund of information.\r\n\r\n\"Do you go to school?\" she inquired of the black boy who held the horse,\r\nher mien sympathetic and interested.\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am,\" he mumbled.\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Buddy--I'se one of Aunt Rachel's chilluns.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where do you live, Buddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I lives with granny, on de upper place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll see Aunt Rachel and ask her to send you to school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't do no good--she done ast, and Mr. Cresswell, he say he ain't\r\ngoing to have no more of his niggers--\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Cresswell came out just then, and with him a big, fat, and\r\ngreasy black man, with little eyes and soft wheedling voice. He was\r\nfollowing Cresswell at the side but just a little behind, hat in hand,\r\nhead aslant, and talking deferentially. Cresswell strode carelessly on,\r\nanswering him with good-natured tolerance.\r\n\r\nThe black man stopped with humility before the trap and swept a profound\r\nobeisance. Cresswell glanced up quizzically at Miss Taylor.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" he announced, \"is Jones, the Baptist preacher--begging.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, lady,\"--in mellow, unctuous tones--\"I don't know what we poor black\r\nfolks would do without Mr. Cresswell--the Lord bless him,\" said the\r\nminister, shoving his hand far down into his pocket.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward they were approaching the Cresswell Mansion, when the\r\nyoung man reined in the horse.\r\n\r\n\"If you wouldn't mind,\" he suggested, \"I could introduce my sister to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be delighted,\" answered Miss Taylor, readily.\r\n\r\nWhen they rolled up to the homestead under its famous oaks the hour was\r\npast one. The house was a white oblong building of two stories. In front\r\nwas the high pillared porch, semi-circular, extending to the roof with a\r\nbalcony in the second story. On the right was a broad verandah looking\r\ntoward a wide lawn, with the main road and the red swamp in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe butler met them, all obeisance.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Miss Helen to come down,\" said Mr. Cresswell.\r\n\r\nSam glanced at him.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Helen will be dreadful sorry, but she and the Colonel have just\r\ngone to town--I believe her Aunty ain't well.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cresswell looked annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well! that's too bad,\" he said. \"But at any rate, have a seat a\r\nmoment out here on the verandah, Miss Taylor. And, Sam, can't you find\r\nus a sandwich and something cool? I could not be so inhospitable as to\r\nsend you away hungry at this time of day.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor sat down in a comfortable low chair facing the refreshing\r\nbreeze, and feasted her eyes on the scene. Oh, this was life: a smooth\r\ngreen lawn, and beds of flowers, a vista of brown fields, and the dark\r\nline of wood beyond. The deft, quiet butler brought out a little table,\r\nspread with the whitest of cloths and laid with the brightest of silver,\r\nand \"found\" a dainty lunch. There was a bit of fried chicken breast,\r\nsome crisp bacon, browned potatoes, little round beaten biscuit, and\r\nrose-colored sherbet with a whiff of wine in it. Miss Taylor wondered a\r\nlittle at the bounty of Southern hospitality; but she was hungry, and\r\nshe ate heartily, then leaned back dreamily and listened to Mr.\r\nCresswell's smooth Southern _r_'s, adding a word here and there that\r\nkept the conversation going and brought a grave smile to his pale lips.\r\nAt last with a sigh she arose to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"I must go! What shall I tell Miss Smith! No, no--no carriage; I must\r\nwalk.\" Of course, however, she could not refuse to let him go at least\r\nhalf-way, ostensibly to tell her of the coming of her brother. He\r\nexpressed again his disappointment at his sister's absence.\r\n\r\nSomewhat to Miss Taylor's surprise Miss Smith said nothing until they\r\nwere parting for the night, then she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Was Miss Cresswell at home?\"\r\n\r\nMary reddened.\r\n\r\n\"She had been called suddenly to town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear, I wouldn't do it again.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was angry.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a school-girl, but a grown woman, and capable of caring for\r\nmyself. Moreover, in matter of propriety I do not think you have usually\r\nfound my ideas too lax--rather the opposite.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there, dear; don't be angry. Only I think if your brother\r\nknew--\"\r\n\r\n\"He will know in a very few weeks; he is coming to visit the\r\nCresswells.\" And Miss Taylor sailed triumphantly up the stairs.\r\n\r\nBut John Taylor was not the man to wait weeks when a purpose could be\r\naccomplished in days or hours. No sooner was Harry Cresswell's telegram\r\nat hand than he hastened back from Savannah, struck across country, and\r\nthe week after his sister's ride found him striding up the carriage-way\r\nof the Cresswell home.\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor had prospered since summer. The cotton manufacturers'\r\ncombine was all but a fact; Mr. Easterly had discovered that his chief\r\nclerk's sense and executive ability were invaluable, and John Taylor was\r\nslated for a salary in five figures when things should be finally\r\nsettled, not to mention a generous slice of stock--watery at present,\r\nbut warranted to ripen early.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Easterly still regarded Taylor's larger trust as chimerical,\r\nsome occurrences of the fall made him take a respectful attitude toward\r\nit. Just as the final clauses of the combine agreement were to be\r\nsigned, there appeared a shortage in the cotton-crop, and prices began\r\nto soar. The cause was obviously the unexpected success of the new\r\nFarmers' League among the cotton-growers. Mr. Easterly found it\r\ncomparatively easy to overthrow the corner, but the flurry made some of\r\nthe manufacturers timid, and the trust agreement was postponed until a\r\nyear later. This experience and the persistence of Mr. Taylor induced\r\nMr. Easterly to take a step toward the larger project: he let in some\r\neager outside capital to the safer manufacturing scheme, and withdrew a\r\ncorresponding amount of Mrs. Grey's money. This he put into John\r\nTaylor's hands to invest in the South in bank stock and industries with\r\nthe idea of playing a part in the financial situation there.\r\n\r\n\"It's a risk, Taylor, of course, and we'll let the old lady take the\r\nrisk. At the worst it's safer than the damned foolishness she has in\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\nSo it happened that John Taylor went South to look after large\r\ninvestments and, as Mr. Easterly expressed it, \"to bring back facts,\r\nnot dreams.\" His investment matters went quickly and well, and now he\r\nturned to his wider and bigger scheme. He wrote the Cresswells\r\ntentatively, expecting no reply, or an evasive one; planning to circle\r\naround them, drawing his nets closer, and trying them again later. To\r\nhis surprise they responded quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Humph! Hard pressed,\" he decided, and hurried to them.\r\n\r\nSo it was the week after Mary Taylor's ride that found him at\r\nCresswell's front door, thin, eagle-eyed, fairly well dressed and\r\nradiating confidence.\r\n\r\n\"John Taylor,\" he announced to Sam, jerkily, thrusting out a card. \"Want\r\nto see Mr. Cresswell; soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nSam made him wait a half-hour, for the sake of discipline, and then\r\nbrought father and son.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, Mr. Cresswell, and Mr. Cresswell again,\" said Mr. Taylor,\r\nhelping himself to a straight-backed chair. \"Hope you'll pardon this\r\nunexpected visit. Found myself called through Montgomery, just after I\r\ngot your wire; thought I'd better drop over.\"\r\n\r\nAt Harry's suggestion they moved to the verandah and sat down over\r\nwhiskey and soda, which Taylor refused, and plunged into the subject\r\nwithout preliminaries.\r\n\r\n\"I'm assuming that you gentlemen are in the cotton business for making\r\nmoney. So am I. I see a way in which you and your friends can help me\r\nand mine, and clear up more millions than all of us can spend; for this\r\nreason I've hunted you up. This is my scheme.\r\n\r\n\"See here; there are a thousand cotton-mills in this country, half of\r\nthem in the South, one-fourth in New England, and one-fourth in the\r\nMiddle States. They are capitalized at six hundred million dollars. Now\r\nlet me tell you: we control three hundred and fifty millions of that\r\ncapitalization. The trust is going through capitalization at a billion.\r\nThe only thing that threatens it is child-labor legislation in the\r\nSouth, the tariff, and the control of the supply of cotton. Pretty big\r\nhindrances, you say. That's so, but look here: we've got the stock so\r\nplaced that nothing short of a popular upheaval can send any Child Labor\r\nbill through Congress in six years. See? After that we don't care. Same\r\nthing applies to the tariff. The last bill ran ten years. The present\r\nbill will last longer, or I lose my guess--'specially if Smith is in the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, there remains raw cotton. The connection of cotton-raising\r\nand its raw material is too close to risk a manufacturing trust that\r\ndoes not include practical control of the raw material. For that reason\r\nwe're planning a trust to include the raising and manufacturing of\r\ncotton in America. Then, too, cornering the cotton market here means the\r\nwhip-hand of the industrial world. Gentlemen, it's the biggest idea of\r\nthe century. It beats steel.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell chuckled.\r\n\r\n\"How do you spell that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nBut John Taylor was not to be diverted; his thin face was pale, but his\r\ngray eyes burned with the fire of a zealot. Harry Cresswell only smiled\r\ndimly and looked interested.\r\n\r\n\"Now, again,\" continued John Taylor. \"There are a million cotton farms\r\nin the South, half run by colored people and half by whites. Leave the\r\ncolored out of account as long as they are disfranchised. The half\r\nmillion white farms are owned or controlled by five thousand wholesale\r\nmerchants and three thousand big landowners, of whom you, Colonel\r\nCresswell, are among the biggest with your fifty thousand acres. Ten\r\nbanks control these eight thousand people--one of these is the Jefferson\r\nNational of Montgomery, of which you are a silent director.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell started; this man evidently had inside information.\r\nDid he know of the mortgage, too?\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed. I'm safe,\" Taylor assured him. \"Now, then, if we can\r\nget the banks, wholesale merchants, and biggest planters into line we\r\ncan control the cotton crop.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" objected Harry Cresswell, \"while the banks and the large\r\nmerchants may be possibilities, do you know what it means to try to get\r\nplanters into line?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do. And what I don't know you and your father do. Colonel\r\nCresswell is president of the Farmers' League. That's the reason I'm\r\nhere. Your success last year made you indispensable to our plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our success?\" laughed Colonel Cresswell, ruefully, thinking of the\r\nfifty thousand dollars lost and the mortgage to cover it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir--success! You didn't know it; we were too careful to allow\r\nthat; and I say frankly you wouldn't know it now if we weren't convinced\r\nyou were too far involved and the League too discouraged to repeat the\r\ndose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, look here, sir,\" began Colonel Cresswell, flushing and drawing\r\nhimself erect.\r\n\r\n\"There, there, Colonel Cresswell, don't misunderstand me. I'm a plain\r\nman. I'm playing a big game--a tremendous one. I need you, and I know\r\nyou need me. I find out about you, and my sources of knowledge are wide\r\nand unerring. But the knowledge is safe, sir; it's buried. Last year\r\nwhen you people curtailed cotton acreage and warehoused a big chunk of\r\nthe crop you gave the mill men the scare of their lives. We had a hasty\r\nconference and the result was that the bottom fell out of your credit.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell grew pale. There was a disquieting, relentless element\r\nin this unimpassioned man's tone.\r\n\r\n\"You failed,\" pursued John Taylor, \"because you couldn't get the banks\r\nand the big merchants behind you. We've got 'em behind us--with big\r\nchunks of stock and a signed iron-clad agreement. You can wheel the\r\nplanters into line--will you do it?\" John Taylor bent forward tense but\r\ncool and steel-like. Harry Cresswell laid his hand on his father's arm\r\nand said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"And where do we come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's business,\" affirmed John Taylor. \"You and two hundred and fifty\r\nof the biggest planters come in on the ground-floor of the\r\ntwo-billion-dollar All-Cotton combine. It can easily mean two million\r\nto you in five years.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the other planters?\"\r\n\r\n\"They come in for high-priced cotton until we get our grip.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\nThe quiet question seemed to invoke a vision for John Taylor; the gray\r\neyes took on the faraway look of a seer; the thin, bloodless lips formed\r\na smile in which there was nothing pleasant.\r\n\r\n\"They keep their mouths shut or we squeeze 'em and buy the land. We\r\npropose to own the cotton belt of the South.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell started indignantly from his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think--by God, sir!--that I'd betray Southern gentlemen to--\"\r\n\r\nBut Harry's hand and impassive manner restrained him; he cooled as\r\nsuddenly as he had flared up.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much, Mr. Taylor,\" he concluded; \"we'll consider this\r\nmatter carefully. You'll spend the night, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't possibly--must catch that next train back.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we must talk further,\" the Colonel insisted. \"And then, there's\r\nyour sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! Forgot all about Mary.\" John Taylor after a little desultory\r\ntalk, followed his host up-stairs.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon John Taylor was sitting beside Helen Cresswell on the\r\nporch which overlooked the terrace, and was, on the whole, thinking less\r\nof cotton than he had for several years. To be sure, he was talking\r\ncotton; but he was doing it mechanically and from long habit, and was\r\nreally thinking how charming a girl Helen Cresswell was. She fascinated\r\nhim. For his sister Taylor had a feeling of superiority that was almost\r\ncontempt. The idea of a woman trying to understand and argue about\r\nthings men knew! He admired the dashing and handsome Miss Easterly, but\r\nshe scared him and made him angrily awkward. This girl, on the other\r\nhand, just lounged and listened with an amused smile, or asked the most\r\nchild-like questions. She required him to wait on her quite as a matter\r\nof course--to adjust her pillows, hand her the bon-bons, and hunt for\r\nher lost fan. Mr. Taylor, who had not waited on anybody since his mother\r\ndied, and not much before, found a quite inexplicable pleasure in these\r\nlittle domesticities. Several times he took out his watch and frowned;\r\nyet he managed to stay with her quite happily.\r\n\r\nOn her part Miss Cresswell was vastly amused. Her acquaintance with men\r\nwas not wide, but it was thorough so far as her own class was concerned.\r\nThey were all well-dressed and leisurely, fairly good looking, and they\r\nsaid the same words and did the same things in the same way. They paid\r\nher compliments which she did not believe, and they did not expect her\r\nto believe. They were charmingly deferential in the matter of dropped\r\nhandkerchiefs, but tyrannical of opinion. They were thoughtful about\r\ncandy and flowers, but thoughtless about feelings and income. Altogether\r\nthey were delightful, but cloying. This man was startlingly different;\r\nungainly and always in a desperate, unaccountable hurry. He knew no\r\npretty speeches, he certainly did not measure up to her standard of\r\nbreeding, and yet somehow he was a gentleman. All this was new to Helen\r\nCresswell, and she liked it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the men above-stairs lingered in the Colonel's office--the\r\nolder one perturbed and sputtering, the younger insistent and\r\nimperturbable.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, father,\" he was saying, \"as you yourself have said, one\r\nbad crop of cotton would almost ruin us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the prospects are good.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are prospects in March? No, father, this is the situation--three\r\ngood crops in succession will wipe off our indebtedness and leave us\r\nfacing only low prices and a scarcity of niggers; on the other hand--\"\r\nThe father interrupted impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, on the other hand, if we plunge deeper in debt and betray our\r\nfriends we may come out millionaires or--paupers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said Harry Cresswell, calmly. \"Now, our plan is to take no\r\nchances; I propose going North and looking into this matter thoroughly.\r\nIf he represents money and has money, and if the trust has really got\r\nthe grip he says it has, why, it's a case of crush or get crushed, and\r\nwe'll have to join them on their own terms. If he's bluffing, or the\r\nthing looks weak, we'll wait.\"\r\n\r\nIt all ended as matters usually did end, in Harry's having his way. He\r\ncame downstairs, expecting, indeed, rather hoping, to find Taylor\r\nimpatiently striding to and fro, watch in hand; but here he was,\r\nungainly, it might be, but quite docile, drawing the picture of a\r\npower-loom for Miss Cresswell, who seemed really interested. Harry\r\nsilently surveyed them from the door, and his face lighted with a new\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nTaylor, espying him, leapt to his feet and hauled out his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Well--I--\" he began lamely.\r\n\r\n\"No, you weren't either,\" interrupted Harry, with a laugh that was\r\nunmistakably cordial and friendly. \"You had quite forgotten what you\r\nwere waiting for--isn't that so, Sis?\"\r\n\r\nHelen regarded her brother through her veiling lashes: what meant this\r\nsudden assumption of warmth and amiability?\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed; he was raging with impatience,\" she returned.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Miss Cresswell, I--I--\" John Taylor forsook social amenities and\r\npulled himself together. \"Well,\" shortly, \"now for that talk--ready?\"\r\nAnd quite forgetting Miss Cresswell, he bolted into the parlor.\r\n\r\n\"The decision we have come to is this,\" said Harry Cresswell. \"We are in\r\ndebt, as you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-nine thousand, seven hundred and forty-two dollars and twelve\r\ncents,\" responded Taylor; \"in three notes, due in twelve, twenty-four,\r\nand thirty-six months, interest at eight per cent, held by--\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel snorted his amazement, and Harry Cresswell cut in:\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he calmly admitted; \"and with good crops for three years we'd be\r\nall right; good crops even for two years would leave us fairly well\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean it would relieve you of the present stringency and put you\r\nface to face with the falling price of cotton and rising wages,\" was\r\nJohn Taylor's dry addendum.\r\n\r\n\"Rising price of cotton, you mean,\" Harry corrected.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, temporarily,\" John Taylor admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, and thus postpone the decision.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Cresswell. I'm offering to let you in on the ground\r\nfloor--_now_--not next year, or year after.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Taylor, have you any money in this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything I've got.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the thing is this way: if you can prove to us that conditions are\r\nas you say, we're in for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Meet me in New York, say--let's see, this is March tenth--well,\r\nMay third.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Cresswell was thinking rapidly. This man without doubt represented\r\nmoney. He was anxious for an alliance. Why? Was it all straight, or did\r\nthe whole move conceal a trick?\r\n\r\nHis eyes strayed to the porch where his pretty sister sat languidly, and\r\nthen toward the school where the other sister lived. John Taylor looked\r\nout on the porch, too. They glanced quickly at each other, and each\r\nwondered if the other had shared his thought. Harry Cresswell did not\r\nvoice his mind for he was not wholly disposed to welcome what was there;\r\nbut he could not refrain from saying in tones almost confidential:\r\n\r\n\"You could recommend this deal, then, could you--to your own friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"To my own family,\" asserted John Taylor, looking at Harry Cresswell\r\nwith sudden interest. But Mr. Cresswell was staring at the end of his\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eleven_\r\n\r\nTHE FLOWERING OF THE FLEECE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" observed Miss Smith, \"it's a great blessing not to need\r\nspectacles, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nZora thought that it was; but she was wondering just what spectacles had\r\nto do with the complaint she had brought to the office from Miss Taylor.\r\n\r\n\"I'm always losing my glasses and they get dirty and--Oh, dear! now\r\nwhere is that paper?\"\r\n\r\nZora pointed silently to the complaint.\r\n\r\n\"No, not that--another paper. It must be in my room. Don't you want to\r\ncome up and help me look?\"\r\n\r\nThey went up to the clean, bare room, with its white iron bed, its cool,\r\nspotless shades and shining windows. Zora walked about softly and\r\nlooked, while Miss Smith quietly searched on desk and bureau, paying no\r\nattention to the girl. For the time being she was silent.\r\n\r\n\"I sometimes wish,\" she began at length, \"I had a bright-eyed girl like\r\nyou to help me find and place things.\"\r\n\r\nZora made no comment.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes Bles helps me,\" added Miss Smith, guilefully.\r\n\r\nZora looked sharply at her. \"Could I help?\" she asked, almost timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I don't know,\"--the answer was deliberate. \"There are one or two\r\nlittle things perhaps--\"\r\n\r\nPlacing a hand gently upon Zora's shoulder, she pointed out a few odd\r\ntasks, and left the girl busily doing them; then she returned to the\r\noffice, and threw Miss Taylor's complaint into the waste-basket.\r\n\r\nFor a week or more Zora slipped in every day and performed the little\r\ntasks that Miss Smith laid out: she sorted papers, dusted the bureau,\r\nhung a curtain; she did not do the things very well, and she broke some\r\nchina, but she worked earnestly and quickly, and there was no thought of\r\npay. Then, too, did not Bles praise her with a happy smile, as together,\r\nday after day, they stood and watched the black dirt where the Silver\r\nFleece lay planted? She dreamed and sang over that dark field, and again\r\nand again appealed to him: \"S'pose it shouldn't come up after all?\" And\r\nhe would laugh and say that of course it would come up.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Zora was helping Miss Smith in the bedroom, she paused\r\nwith her arms full of clothes fresh from the laundry.\r\n\r\n\"Where shall I put these?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith looked around. \"They might go in there,\" she said, pointing\r\nto a door. Zora opened it. A tiny bedroom was disclosed, with one broad\r\nwindow looking toward the swamp; white curtains adorned it, and white\r\nhangings draped the plain bureau and wash-stand and the little bed.\r\nThere was a study table, and a small bookshelf holding a few books, all\r\nsimple and clean. Zora paused uncertainly, and surveyed the room.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes when you're tired and want to be alone you can come up here,\r\nZora,\" said Miss Smith carelessly. \"No one uses this room.\"\r\n\r\nZora caught her breath sharply, but said nothing. The next day Miss\r\nSmith said to her when she came in:\r\n\r\n\"I'm busy now, dear, but you go up to your little room and read and I'll\r\ncall.\"\r\n\r\nZora quietly obeyed. An hour later Miss Smith looked in, then she closed\r\nthe door lightly and left. Another hour flew by before Zora hurried\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"I was reading, and I forgot,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" returned Miss Smith. \"I didn't need you. And any day,\r\nafter you get all your lessons, I think Miss Taylor will excuse you and\r\nlet you go to your room and read.\" Miss Taylor, it transpired, was more\r\nthan glad.\r\n\r\nDay after day Bles and Zora visited the field; but ever the ground lay\r\nan unrelieved black beneath the bright sun, and they would go\r\nreluctantly home again, today there was much work to be done, and Zora\r\nlabored steadily and eagerly, never pausing, and gaining in deftness and\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Bles went to town with the school wagon. A light shower\r\nflew up from the south, lingered a while and fled, leaving a fragrance\r\nin the air. For a moment Zora paused, and her nostrils quivered; then\r\nwithout a word she slipped down-stairs, glided into the swamp, and sped\r\naway to the island. She swung across the tree and a low, delighted cry\r\nbubbled on her lips. All the rich, black ground was sprinkled with\r\ntender green. She bent above the verdant tenderness and kissed it; then\r\nshe rushed back, bursting into the room.\r\n\r\n\"_It's come! It's come!--the Silver Fleece!_\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith was startled.\r\n\r\n\"The Silver Fleece!\" she echoed in bewilderment.\r\n\r\nZora hesitated. It came over her all at once that this one great\r\nall-absorbing thing meant nothing to the gaunt tired-look woman before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Would Bles care if I told?\" she asked doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Miss Smith ventured.\r\n\r\nAnd then the girl crouched at her feet and told the dream and the\r\nstory. Many factors were involved that were quite foreign to the older\r\nwoman's nature and training. The recital brought to her New England mind\r\nmany questions of policy and propriety. And yet, as she looked down upon\r\nthe dark face, hot with enthusiasm, it all seemed somehow more than\r\nright. Slowly and lightly Miss Smith slipped her arm about Zora, and\r\nnodded and smiled a perfect understanding. They looked out together into\r\nthe darkening twilight.\r\n\r\n\"It is so late and wet and you're tired tonight--don't you think you'd\r\nbetter sleep in your little room?\"\r\n\r\nZora sat still. She thought of the noisy flaming cabin and the dark\r\nswamp; but a contrasting thought of the white bed made her timid, and\r\nslowly she shook her head. Nevertheless Miss Smith led her to the room.\r\n\r\n\"Here are things for you to wear,\" she pointed out, opening the bureau,\r\n\"and here is the bath-room.\" She left the girl standing in the middle of\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nIn time Zora came to stay often at Miss Smith's cottage, and to learn\r\nnew and unknown ways of living and dressing. She still refused to board,\r\nfor that would cost more than she could pay yet, and she would accept no\r\ncharity. Gradually an undemonstrative friendship sprang up between the\r\npale old gray-haired teacher and the dark young black-haired girl.\r\nDelicately, too, but gradually, the companionship of Bles and Zora was\r\nguided and regulated. Of mornings Zora would hurry through her lessons\r\nand get excused to fly to the swamp, to work and dream alone. At noon\r\nBles would run down, and they would linger until he must hurry back to\r\ndinner. After school he would go again, working while she was busy in\r\nMiss Smith's office, and returning later, would linger awhile to tell\r\nZora of his day while she busied herself with her little tasks. Saturday\r\nmornings they would go to the swamp and work together, and sometimes\r\nMiss Smith, stealing away from curious eyes, would come and sit and talk\r\nwith them as they toiled.\r\n\r\nIn those days, for these two souls, earth came very near to heaven.\r\nBoth were in the midst of that mighty change from youth to womanhood and\r\nmanhood. Their manner toward each other by degrees grew shyer and more\r\nthoughtful. There was less of comradeship, but the little meant more.\r\nThe rough good fellowship was silently put aside; they no longer lightly\r\nclasped hands; and each at times wondered, in painful\r\nself-consciousness, if the other cared.\r\n\r\nThen began, too, that long and subtle change wherein a soul, until now\r\nunmindful of its wrappings, comes suddenly to consciousness of body and\r\nclothes; when it gropes and tries to adjust one with the other, and\r\nthrough them to give to the inner deeper self, finer and fuller\r\nexpression. One saw it easily, almost suddenly, in Alwyn's Sunday suit,\r\nvivid neckties, and awkward fads.\r\n\r\nSlower, subtler, but more striking was the change in Zora, as she began\r\nto earn bits of pin money in the office and to learn to sew. Dresses\r\nhung straighter; belts served a better purpose; stockings were smoother;\r\nunderwear was daintier. Then her hair--that great dark mass of immovable\r\ninfinitely curled hair--began to be subdued and twisted and combed\r\nuntil, with steady pains and study, it lay in thick twisted braids about\r\nher velvet forehead, like some shadowed halo. All this came much more\r\nslowly and spasmodically than one tells it. Few noticed the change much;\r\nnone noticed all; and yet there came a night--a student's social--when\r\nwith a certain suddenness the whole school, teachers and pupils,\r\nrealized the newness of the girl, and even Bles was startled.\r\n\r\nHe had bought her in town, at Christmas time, a pair of white satin\r\nslippers, partly to test the smallness of her feet on which in younger\r\ndays he had rallied her, and partly because she had mentioned a possible\r\nwhite dress. They were a cheap, plain pair but dainty, and they fitted\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening came and the students were marching and the teachers,\r\nsave Miss Smith, were sitting rather primly apart and commenting, she\r\nentered the room. She was a little late, and a hush greeted her. One\r\nboy, with the inimitable drawl of the race, pushed back his ice-cream\r\nand addressed it with a mournful head-shake:\r\n\r\n\"Go way, honey, yo' los' yo' tas'e!\"\r\n\r\nThe dress was plain and fitted every curving of a healthy girlish form.\r\nShe paused a moment white-bodied and white-limbed but dark and\r\nvelvet-armed, her full neck and oval head rising rich and almost black\r\nabove, with its deep-lighted eyes and crown of silent darkling hair.\r\n\r\nTo some, such a revelation of grace and womanliness in this hoyden, the\r\ngentle swelling of lankness to beauty, of lowliness to shy self-poise,\r\nwas a sudden joy, to others a mere blindness. Mary Taylor was perplexed\r\nand in some indefinite way amazed; and many of the other teachers saw no\r\nbeauty, only a strangeness that brought a smile. They were such as know\r\nbeauty by convention only, and find it lip-ringed, hoop-skirted,\r\ntattooed, or corsetted, as time and place decree.\r\n\r\nThe change in Zora, however, had been neither cataclysmic nor\r\nrevolutionary and it was yet far--very far--from complete. She still ran\r\nand romped in the woods, and dreamed her dreams; she still was\r\npassionately independent and \"queer.\" Tendencies merely had become\r\nmanifest, some dominant. She would, unhindered, develop to a brilliant,\r\nsumptuous womanhood; proud, conquering, full-blooded, and deep\r\nbosomed--a passionate mother of men. Herein lay all her early wildness\r\nand strangeness. Herein lay, as yet half hidden, dimly sensed and all\r\nunspoken, the power of a mighty all-compelling love for one human soul,\r\nand, through it, for all the souls of men. All this lay growing and\r\ndeveloping; but as yet she was still a girl, with a new shyness and\r\ncomeliness and a bold, searching heart.\r\n\r\nIn the field of the Silver Fleece all her possibilities were beginning\r\nto find expression. These new-born green things hidden far down in the\r\nswamp, begotten in want and mystery, were to her a living wonderful\r\nfairy tale come true. All the latent mother in her brooded over them;\r\nall her brilliant fancy wove itself about them. They were her\r\ndream-children, and she tended them jealously; they were her Hope, and\r\nshe worshipped them. When the rabbits tried the tender plants she\r\nwatched hours to drive them off, and catching now and then a pulsing\r\npink-eyed invader, she talked to it earnestly:\r\n\r\n\"Brer Rabbit--poor little Brer Rabbit, don't you know you mustn't eat\r\nZora's cotton? Naughty, naughty Brer Rabbit.\" And then she would show it\r\nwhere she had gathered piles of fragrant weeds for it and its fellows.\r\n\r\nThe golden green of the first leaves darkened, and the plants sprang\r\nforward steadily. Never before was such a magnificent beginning, a full\r\nmonth ahead of other cotton. The rain swept down in laughing, bubbling\r\nshowers, and laved their thirsty souls, and Zora held her beating breast\r\nday by day lest it rain too long or too heavily. The sun burned fiercely\r\nupon the young cotton plants as the spring hastened, and they lifted\r\ntheir heads in darker, wilder luxuriance; for the time of hoeing was at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThese days were days of alternate hope and doubt with Bles Alwyn.\r\nStrength and ambition and inarticulate love were fighting within him. He\r\nfelt, in the dark thousands of his kind about him, a mighty calling to\r\ndeeds. He was becoming conscious of the narrowness and straightness of\r\nhis black world, and red anger flashed in him ever and again as he felt\r\nhis bonds. His mental horizon was broadening as he prepared for the\r\ncollege of next year; he was faintly grasping the wider, fuller world,\r\nand its thoughts and aspirations.\r\n\r\nBut beside and around and above all this, like subtle, permeating ether,\r\nwas--Zora. His feelings for her were not as yet definite, expressed, or\r\ngrasped; they were rather the atmosphere in which all things occurred\r\nand were felt and judged. From an amusing pastime she had come to be a\r\ncompanion and thought-mate; and now, beyond this, insensibly they were\r\ndrifting to a silenter, mightier mingling of souls. But drifting,\r\nmerely--not arrived; going gently, irresistibly, but not yet at the\r\nrealized goal.\r\n\r\nHe felt all this as the stirring of a mighty force, but knew not what\r\nhe felt. The teasing of his fellows, the common love-gossip of the\r\nschool yard, seemed far different from his plight. He laughed at it and\r\nindignantly denied it. Yet he was uncomfortable, restless, unhappy. He\r\nfancied Zora cared less for his company, and he gave her less, and then\r\nwas puzzled to find time hanging so empty, so wretchedly empty, on his\r\nhands. When they were together in these days they found less to talk\r\nabout, and had it not been for the Silver Fleece which in magic\r\nwilfulness opened both their mouths, they would have found their\r\ncompanionship little more than a series of awkward silences. Yet in\r\ntheir silences, their walks, and their sittings there was a\r\ncompanionship, a glow, a satisfaction, as came to them nowhere else on\r\nearth, and they wondered at it.\r\n\r\nThey were both wondering at it this morning as they watched their\r\ncotton. It had seemingly bounded forward in a night and it must be hoed\r\nforthwith. Yet, hoeing was murder--the ruthless cutting away of tenderer\r\nplants that the sturdier might thrive the more and grow.\r\n\r\n\"I hate it, Bles, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Killing any of it; it's all so pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it must be, so that what's left will be prettier, or at least more\r\nuseful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it shouldn't be so; everything ought to have a chance to be\r\nbeautiful and useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it ought to be so,\" admitted Bles, \"but it isn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it so--anywhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon not. Death and pain pay for all good things.\"\r\n\r\nShe hoed away silently, hesitating over the choice of the plants,\r\npondering this world-old truth, saddened by its ruthless cruelty.\r\n\r\n\"Death and pain,\" she murmured; \"what a price!\"\r\n\r\nBles leaned on his hoe and considered. It had not occurred to him till\r\nnow that Zora was speaking better and better English: the idioms and\r\nerrors were dropping away; they had not utterly departed, however, but\r\ncame crowding back in moments of excitement. At other times she clothed\r\nMiss Smith's clear-cut, correct speech in softer Southern accents. She\r\nwas drifting away from him in some intangible way to an upper world of\r\ndress and language and deportment, and the new thought was pain to him.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the Fleece rose and spread and grew to its wonderful\r\nflowering; and so these two children grew with it into theirs. Zora\r\nnever forgot how they found the first white flower in that green and\r\nbillowing sea, nor her low cry of pleasure and his gay shout of joy.\r\nSlowly, wonderfully the flowers spread--white, blue, and purple bells,\r\nhiding timidly, blazing luxuriantly amid the velvet leaves; until one\r\nday--it was after a southern rain and the sunlight was twinkling through\r\nthe morning--all the Fleece was in flower--a mighty swaying sea,\r\ndarkling rich and waving, and upon it flecks and stars of white and\r\npurple foam. The joy of the two so madly craved expression that they\r\nburst into singing; not the wild light song of dancing feet, but a low,\r\nsweet melody of her fathers' fathers, whereunto Alwyn's own deep voice\r\nfell fitly in minor cadence.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith and Miss Taylor, who were sorting the mail, heard them\r\nsinging as they came up out of the swamp. Miss Taylor looked at them,\r\nthen at Miss Smith.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Smith sat white and rigid with the first opened letter in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twelve_\r\n\r\nTHE PROMISE\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Smith sat with her face buried in her hands while the tears\r\ntrickled silently through her thin fingers. Before her lay the letter,\r\nread a dozen times:\r\n\r\n\"Old Mrs. Grey has been to see me, and she has announced her intention\r\nof endowing five colored schools, yours being one. She asked if $500,000\r\nwould do it. She has plenty of money, so I told her $750,000 would be\r\nbetter--$150,000 apiece. She's arranging for a Board of Trust, etc.\r\nYou'll probably hear from her soon. You've been so worried about\r\nexpenses that I thought I'd send this word on; I knew you'd be glad.\"\r\n\r\nGlad? Dear God, how flat the word fell! For thirty years she had sown\r\nthe seed, planting her life-blood in this work, that had become the\r\nmarrow of her soul.\r\n\r\nSuccessful? No, it had not been successful; but it had been human.\r\nThrough yonder doorway had trooped an army of hundreds upon hundreds of\r\nbright and dull, light and dark, eager and sullen faces. There had been\r\ngood and bad, honest and deceptive, frank and furtive. Some had caught,\r\nkindled and flashed to ambition and achievement; some, glowing dimly,\r\nhad plodded on in a slow, dumb faithful work worth while; and yet others\r\nhad suddenly exploded, hurtling human fragments to heaven and to hell.\r\nAround this school home, as around the centre of some little universe,\r\nhad whirled the sorrowful, sordid, laughing, pulsing drama of a world:\r\nbirth pains, and the stupor of death; hunger and pale murder; the riot\r\nof thirst and the orgies of such red and black cabins as Elspeth's,\r\ncrouching in the swamp.\r\n\r\nShe groaned as she read of the extravagances of the world and saw her\r\nown vanishing revenues; but the funds continued to dwindle until Sarah\r\nSmith asked herself: \"What will become of this school when I die?\" With\r\ntrembling fingers she had sat down to figure how many teachers must be\r\ndropped next year, when her brother's letter came, and she slipped to\r\nher knees and prayed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey's decision was due in no little way to Mary Taylor's reports.\r\nSlowly but surely the girl had begun to think that she had found herself\r\nin this new world. She would never be attuned to it thoroughly, for she\r\nwas set for different music. The veil of color and race still hung\r\nthickly between her and her pupils; and yet she seemed to see some\r\npoints of penetration. No one could meet daily a hundred or more of\r\nthese light-hearted, good-natured children without feeling drawn to\r\nthem. No one could cross the thresholds of the cabins and not see the\r\nold and well-known problems of life and striving. More and more,\r\ntherefore, the work met Miss Taylor's approval and she told Mrs. Grey\r\nso.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Mary Taylor had come to some other definite\r\nconclusions: she believed it wrong to encourage the ambitions of these\r\nchildren to any great extent; she believed they should be servants and\r\nfarmers, content to work under present conditions until those conditions\r\ncould be changed; and she believed that the local white aristocracy,\r\nhelped by Northern philanthropy, should take charge of such gradual\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions she did not pretend to have originated; but she\r\nadopted them from reading and conversation, after hesitating for a year\r\nbefore such puzzling contradictions as Bles Alwyn and Harry Cresswell.\r\nFor her to conclude to treat Bles Alwyn as a man despite his color was\r\nas impossible as to think Mr. Cresswell a criminal. Some compromise was\r\nimperative which would save her the pleasure of Mr. Cresswell's company\r\nand at the same time leave open a way of fulfilling the world's duty to\r\nthis black boy. She thought she had found this compromise and she wrote\r\nMrs. Grey suggesting a chain of endowed Negro schools under the\r\nmanagement of trustees composed of Northern business men and local\r\nSouthern whites. Mrs. Grey acquiesced gladly and announced her plan,\r\neventually writing Miss Smith of her decision \"to second her noble\r\nefforts in helping the poor colored people,\" and she hoped to have the\r\nplan under way before next fall.\r\n\r\nThe sharpness of Miss Smith's joy did not let her dwell on the proposed\r\n\"Board of Trust\"; of course, it would be a board of friends of the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nShe sat in her office looking out across the land. School had closed for\r\nthe year and Bles with the carryall was just taking Miss Taylor to the\r\ntrain with her trunk and bags. Far up the road she could see dotted here\r\nand there the little dirty cabins of Cresswell's tenants--the Cresswell\r\ndomain that lay like a mighty hand around the school, ready at a word to\r\nsqueeze its life out. Only yonder, to the eastward, lay the way out; the\r\nfive hundred acres of the Tolliver plantation, which the school needed\r\nso sadly for its farm and community. But the owner was a hard and\r\nignorant white man, hating \"niggers\" only a shade more than he hated\r\nwhite aristocrats of the Cresswell type. He had sold the school its\r\nfirst land to pique the Cresswells; but he would not sell any more, she\r\nwas sure, even now when the promise of wealth faced the school.\r\n\r\nShe lay back and closed her eyes and fell lightly asleep. As she slept\r\nan old woman came toiling up the hill northward from the school, and\r\nout of the eastward spur of the Cresswell barony. She was fat and black,\r\nhooded and aproned, with great round head and massive bosom. Her face\r\nwas dull and heavy and homely, her old eyes sorrowful. She moved\r\nswiftly, carrying a basket on her arm. Opposite her, to the southward,\r\nbut too far for sight, an old man came out of the lower Cresswell place,\r\nskirting the swamp. He was tall, black, and gaunt, part bald with tufted\r\nhair, and a cowed and furtive look was in his eyes. One leg was\r\ncrippled, and he hobbled painfully.\r\n\r\nUp the road to the eastward that ran past the school, with the morning\r\nsun at his back, strode a young man, yellow, crisp-haired, strong-faced,\r\nwith darkly knit brows. He greeted Bles and the teacher coldly, and\r\nmoved on in nervous haste. A woman, hurrying out of the westward swamp\r\nup the path that led from Elspeth's, saw him and shrank back hastily.\r\nShe turned quickly into the swamp and waited, looking toward the school.\r\nThe old woman hurried into the back gate just as the old man appeared to\r\nthe southward on the road. The young man greeted him cordially and they\r\nstopped a moment to talk, while the hiding woman watched.\r\n\r\n\"Howdy, Uncle Jim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Howdy, son. Hit's hot, ain't it? How is you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tolerable, how are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poorly, son, poorly--and worser in mind. I'se goin' up to talk to old\r\nMiss.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I, but I just see Aunt Rachel going in. We'd better wait.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith started up at the timid knocking, and rubbed her eyes. It was\r\nlong since she had slept in the daytime and she was annoyed at such\r\nlaziness. She opened the back door and led the old woman to the office.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what have you got there?\" she demanded, eyeing the basket.\r\n\r\n\"Just a little chicken fo' you and a few aigs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are so thoughtful!\" Sarah Smith's was a grateful heart.\r\n\r\n\"Go 'long now--hit ain't a thing.\"\r\n\r\nThen came a pause, the old woman sliding into the proffered seat, while\r\nover her genial, dimpled smile there dropped a dull veil of care. Her\r\neyes shifted uneasily. Miss Smith tried not to notice the change.\r\n\r\n\"Well, are you all moved, Aunt Rachel?\" she inquired cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, and we ain't gwine to move.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought it was all arranged.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" gloomily, \"but de ole Cunnel, he won't let us go.\"\r\n\r\nThe listener was instantly sympathetic. \"Why not?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"He says we owes him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But didn't you settle at Christmas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm; but when he found we was goin' away, he looked up some more\r\ndebts.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know 'zactly--more'n a hundred dollars. Den de boys done got in\r\ndat trouble, and he paid their fines.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, one was a-gambling, and the other struck the overseer what was\r\na-whippin' him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whipping him!\"--in horrified exclamation, quite as much at Aunt\r\nRachel's matter-of-fact way of regarding the matter as at the deed\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm. He didn't do his work right and he whipped him. I speck he\r\nneeded it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he's a grown man,\" Miss Smith urged earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm; he's twenty now, and big.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whipped him!\" Miss Smith repeated. \"And so you can't leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"No'm, he say he'll sell us out and put us in de chain-gang if we go.\r\nThe boys is plumb mad, but I'se a-pleadin' with 'em not to do nothin'\r\nrash.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but I thought they had already started to work a crop on the\r\nTolliver place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, dey had; but, you see, dey were arrested, and then Cunnel\r\nCresswell took 'em and 'lowed they couldn't leave his place. Ol' man\r\nTolliver was powerful mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Aunt Rachel, it's slavery!\" cried the lady in dismay. Aunt Rachel\r\ndid not offer to dispute her declaration.\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm, hit's slavery,\" she agreed. \"I hates it mighty bad, too, 'cause\r\nI wanted de little chillens in school; but--\" The old woman broke down\r\nand sobbed.\r\n\r\nA knocking came at the door; hastily wiping her eyes Aunt Rachel rose.\r\n\r\n\"I'll--I'll see what I can do, Aunt Rachel--I must do something,\"\r\nmurmured Miss Smith hastily, as the woman departed, and an old black man\r\ncame limping in. Miss Smith looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I begs pardon, Mistress--I begs pardon. Good-morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning--\" she hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Sykes--Jim Sykes--that's me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I've heard of you, Mr. Sykes; you live over south of the swamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am, that's me; and I'se got a little shack dar and a bit of\r\nland what I'se trying to buy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of Colonel Cresswell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm, of de Cunnel.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how long have you been buying it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Going on ten year now; and dat's what I comes to ask you about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness me! And how much have you paid a year?\"\r\n\r\n\"I gen'rally pays 'bout three bales of cotton a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he furnish you rations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only sugar and coffee and a little meat now and then.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it amount to a year?\"\r\n\r\n\"I doesn't rightly know--but I'se got some papers here.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith looked them over and sighed. It was the same old tale of\r\nblind receipts for money \"on account\"--no items, no balancing. By his\r\nhelp she made out that last year his total bill at Cresswell's store was\r\nperhaps forty dollars.\r\n\r\n\"An' last year's bill was bigger'n common 'cause I hurt my leg working\r\nat the gin and had to have some medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, as far as I can see, Mr. Sykes, you've paid Cresswell about a\r\nthousand dollars in the last ten years. How large is your place?\"\r\n\r\n\"About twenty acres.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what were you to pay for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four hundred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you got the deed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, but I ain't finished paying yet; de Cunnel say as how I owes him\r\ntwo hundred dollars still, and I can't see it. Dat's why I come over\r\nhere to talk wid you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the deed?\"\r\n\r\nHe handed it to her and her heart sank. It was no deed, but a\r\ncomplicated contract binding the tenant hand and foot to the landlord.\r\nShe sighed, he watching her eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I'se getting old,\" he explained, \"and I ain't got nobody to take care\r\nof me. I can't work as I once could, and de overseers dey drives me too\r\nhard. I wants a little home to die in.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith's throat swelled. She couldn't tell him that he would never\r\nget one at the present rate; she only said:\r\n\r\n\"I'll--look this up. You come again next Saturday.\"\r\n\r\nThen sadly she watched the ragged old slave hobble away with his\r\ncherished \"papers.\" He greeted the young man at the gate and passed out,\r\nwhile the latter walked briskly up to the door and knocked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, how do you do, Robert?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Miss Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, are you getting things in shape so as to enter school early next\r\nyear?\"\r\n\r\nRobert looked embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I came to tell you, Miss Smith. Mr. Cresswell has offered\r\nme forty acres of good land.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith looked disheartened.\r\n\r\n\"Robert, here you are almost finished, and my heart is set on your going\r\nto Atlanta University and finishing college. With your fine voice and\r\ntalent for drawing--\"\r\n\r\nA dogged look settled on Robert's young bright face, and the speaker\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use, Miss Smith--what opening is there for a--a nigger with\r\nan education?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith was shocked.\r\n\r\n\"Why--why, every chance,\" she protested, \"and where there's none _make_\r\na chance!\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Taylor says\"--Miss Smith's heart sank; how often had she heard\r\nthat deadening phrase in the last year!--\"that there's no use. That\r\nfarming is the only thing we ought to try to do, and I reckon she thinks\r\nthere ain't much chance even there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Robert, farming is a noble calling. Whether you're suited to it or not,\r\nI don't yet know, but I'd like nothing better than to see you settled\r\nhere in a decent home with a family, running a farm. But, Robert,\r\nfarming doesn't call for less intelligence than other things; it calls\r\nfor more. It is because the world thinks any training good enough for a\r\nfarmer that the Southern farmer is today practically at the mercy of his\r\nkeener and more intelligent fellows. And of all people, Robert, your\r\npeople need trained intelligence to cope with this problem of farming\r\nhere. Without intelligence and training and some capital it is the\r\nwildest nonsense to think you can lead your people out of slavery. Look\r\nround you.\" She told him of the visitors. \"Are they not hard working\r\nhonest people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet they are slaves--dumb driven cattle.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they have no education.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have a smattering; therefore are ready to pit yourself against\r\nthe organized plantation system without capital or experience. Robert,\r\nyou may succeed; you may find your landlord honest and the way clear;\r\nbut my advice to you is--finish your education, develop your talents,\r\nand then come to your life work a full-fledged man and not a\r\nhalf-ignorant boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll think of it,\" returned the boy soberly. \"I reckon you're right. I\r\nknow Miss Taylor don't think much of us. But I'm tired of waiting; I\r\nwant to get to work.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith laid a kindly hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I've been waiting thirty years, Robert,\" she said, with feeling, and he\r\nhung his head.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to talk about it,\" he awkwardly responded, turning slowly\r\naway. But Miss Smith stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Robert, where is the land Cresswell offers you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's on the Tolliver place.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Tolliver place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is going to buy it.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith dismissed the boy absently and sat down. The crisis seemed\r\ndrawing near. She had not dreamed the Tolliver place was for sale. The\r\nold man must be hard pressed to sell to the Cresswells.\r\n\r\nShe started up. Why not go see him? Perhaps a mortgage on the strength\r\nof the endowment? It was dangerous--but--\r\n\r\nShe threw a veil over her hair, and opened the door. A woman stood\r\nthere, who shrank and cowered, as if used to blows. Miss Smith eyed her\r\ngrimly, then slowly stepped back.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" she commanded briefly, motioning the woman to a chair.\r\n\r\nBut she stood, a pathetic figure, faded, worn, yet with unmistakable\r\ntraces of beauty in her golden face and soft brown hair. Miss Smith\r\ncontemplated her sadly. Here was her most haunting failure, this girl\r\nwhom she first had seen twelve years ago in her wonderful girlish\r\ncomeliness. She had struggled and fought for her, but the forces of the\r\ndevil had triumphed. She caught glimpses of her now and then, but today\r\nwas the first time she had spoken to her for ten years. She saw the\r\ntears that gathered but did not fall; then her hands quivered.\r\n\r\n\"Bertie,\" she began brokenly. The girl shivered, but stood aloof.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith,\" she said. \"No--don't talk--I'm bad--but I've got a little\r\ngirl, Miss Smith, ten years old, and--and--I'm afraid for her; I want\r\nyou to take her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no place for one so young. And why are you afraid for her?\"\r\n\r\n\"The men there are beginning to notice her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"At Elspeth's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you stay there now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"_He_ wants me to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must you do as he wants?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But I want the child--different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't _you_ want to be different?\"\r\n\r\nThe woman quivered again but she answered steadily: \"No.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith sank into a chair and moistened her dry lips.\r\n\r\n\"Elspeth's is an awful place,\" she affirmed solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Zora?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is not there much now, she stays away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if she escapes, why not you?\"\r\n\r\n\"She wants to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to.\"\r\n\r\nThis stubborn depravity was so distressing that Sarah Smith was at an\r\nutter loss what to say or do.\r\n\r\n\"I can do nothing--\" she began.\r\n\r\n\"For me,\" the woman quickly replied; \"I don't ask anything; but for the\r\nchild,--she isn't to blame.\"\r\n\r\nThe older woman wavered.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you try?\" pleaded the younger.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I'll try, I'll try; I am trying all the time, but there are more\r\nthings than my weak strength can do. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith stood a long time in the doorway, watching the fading figure\r\nand vaguely trying to remember what it was that she had started to do,\r\nwhen the sharp staccato step of a mule drew her attention to a rider who\r\nstopped at the gate. It was her neighbor, Tolliver--a gaunt,\r\nyellow-faced white man, ragged, rough, and unkempt; one of the poor\r\nwhites who had struggled up and failed. He spent no courtesy on the\r\n\"nigger\" teacher, but sat in his saddle and called her to the gate, and\r\nshe went.\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" he roughly opened up, \"I've got to sell some land and them damn\r\nCresswells are after it. You can have it for five thousand dollars if\r\nyou git the cash in a week.\" With a muttered oath he rode abruptly off;\r\nbut not before she had seen the tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAll night Sarah Smith lay thinking, and all day she thought and dreamed.\r\nToward dark she walked slowly out the gate and up the highway toward the\r\nCresswell oaks. She had never been within the gates before, and she\r\nlooked about thoughtfully. The great trees in their regular curving rows\r\nmust have been planted more than half a century ago. The lawn was well\r\ntended and the flowers. Yes, there were signs of taste and wealth. \"But\r\nit was built on a moan,\" cried Miss Smith to herself, passionately, and\r\nshe would not look round any more, but stared straight ahead where she\r\nsaw old Colonel Cresswell smoking and reading on the verandah.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel saw her, too, and was uneasy, for he knew that Miss Smith\r\nhad a sharp tongue and a most disconcerting method of argument, which\r\nhe, as a Southern gentleman, courteous to all white females, even if\r\nthey did eat with \"niggers,\" could not properly answer. He received her\r\nwith courtesy, offered a chair, laid aside his cigar, and essayed some\r\ngeneral remarks on cotton weather. But Miss Smith plunged into her\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Cresswell, I'm thinking of raising some money from a mortgage\r\non our school property.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel's face involuntarily lighted up. He thought he saw the\r\nbeginning of the end of an institution which had been a thorn in his\r\nflesh ever since Tolliver, in a fit of rage, had sold land for a Negro\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\"H'm,\" he reflected deprecatingly, wiping his brow.\r\n\r\n\"I need some ready money,\" she continued, \"to keep from curtailing our\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have good prospects in a year or so\"--the Colonel looked up sharply,\r\nbut said nothing--\"and so I thought of a mortgage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Money is pretty tight,\" was the Colonel's first objection.\r\n\r\n\"The land is worth, you know, at least fifty dollars an acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than twenty-five dollars, I fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you wanted seventy-five dollars for poorer land last year! We have\r\ntwo hundred acres.\" It was not for nothing that this lady had been born\r\nin New England.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't reckon it as worth more than five thousand dollars,\"\r\ninsisted the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"And ten thousand dollars for improvements.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Colonel arose. \"You had better talk to the directors of the\r\nJefferson Bank,\" he said politely. \"They may accommodate you--how much\r\nwould you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five thousand dollars,\" Miss Smith replied. Then she hesitated. That\r\nwould buy the land, to be sure; but money was needed to develop and run\r\nit; to install tenants; and then, too, for new teachers. But she said\r\nnothing more, and, nodding to his polite bow, departed. Colonel\r\nCresswell had noticed her hesitation, and thought of it as he settled to\r\nhis cigar again.\r\n\r\nBles Alwyn arose next morning and examined the sky critically. He\r\nfeared rain. The season had been quite wet enough, particularly down on\r\nthe swamp land, and but yesterday Bles had viewed his dykes with\r\napprehension for the black pool scowled about them. He dared not think\r\nwhat a long heavy rain might do to the wonderful island of cotton which\r\nnow stood fully five feet high, with flowers and squares and budding\r\nbolls. It might not rain, but the safest thing would be to work at those\r\ndykes, so he started for spade and hoe. He heard Miss Smith calling,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\n\"Bles--hitch up!\"\r\n\r\nHe was vexed. \"Are you--in a hurry, Miss Smith?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" she replied, with unmistakable positiveness.\r\n\r\nHe started off, and hesitated. \"Miss Smith, would Jim do to drive?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" sharply. \"I want you particularly.\" At another time she might have\r\nobserved his anxiety, but today she was agitated. She knew she was\r\ntaking a critical step.\r\n\r\nSlowly Bles hitched up. After all it might not rain, he argued as they\r\njogged toward town. In silence they rode on. Bles kept looking at the\r\nskies. The south was getting darker and darker. It might rain. It might\r\nrain only an hour or so, but, suppose it should rain a day--two days--a\r\nweek?\r\n\r\nMiss Smith was looking at her own skies and despite the promised sunrise\r\nthey loomed darkly. Five thousand was needed for the land and at least\r\nanother thousand for repairs. Two thousand would \"buy\" a half dozen\r\ndesirable tenants by paying their debts to their present landlords. Then\r\ntwo thousand would be wanted for new teachers and a carpenter shop--ten\r\nthousand dollars!\r\n\r\nIt was a great temptation. And yet, once in the hands of these\r\npast-masters of debt-manipulation, would her school be safe? Suppose,\r\nafter all, this Grey gift--but she caught her breath sharply just as a\r\nwet splash of rain struck upon her forehead. No. God could not be so\r\ncruel. She pushed her bonnet back: how good and cool the water felt! But\r\non Bles as he raised the buggy top it felt hot and fiery.\r\n\r\nHe felt the coming of some great calamity, the end of a dream. This\r\nrain might stay for days; it looked like such a downpour; and that would\r\nmean the end of the Silver Fleece; the end of Zora's hopes; the end of\r\neverything. He gulped in despairing anger and hit the staid old horse\r\nthe smartest tap she had known all summer.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bles, what's the matter?\" called Miss Smith, as the horse started\r\nforward. He murmured something about getting wet and drew up at the\r\nToomsville bank.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith was invited politely into the private parlor. She explained\r\nher business. The President was there and Colonel Cresswell and one\r\nother local director.\r\n\r\n\"I have come for a mortgage. Our land is, as you know, gentlemen, worth\r\nat least ten thousand dollars; the buildings cost fifteen thousand\r\ndollars; our property is, therefore, conservatively valued at\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars. Now I want to mortgage it for\"--she\r\nhesitated--\"five thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell was silent, but the president said:\r\n\r\n\"Money is rather scarce just now, Miss Smith; but it happens that I have\r\nten thousand dollars on hand, which we prefer, however, to loan in one\r\nlump sum. Now, if the security were ample, I think perhaps you might get\r\nthis ten thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith grew white; it was the sum she wanted. She tried to escape\r\nthe temptation, yet the larger amount was more than twice as desirable\r\nto her as the smaller, and she knew that they knew it. They were trying\r\nto tempt her; they wanted as firm a hold on the school property as\r\npossible. And yet, why should she hesitate? It was a risk, but the\r\nreturns would be enormous--she must do it. Besides, there was the\r\nendowment; it was certain; yes--she felt forced to close the bargain.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" she declared her decision, and they handed her the\r\npreliminary papers. She took the pen and glanced at Mr. Cresswell; he\r\nwas smiling slightly, but nevertheless she signed her name grimly, in a\r\nlarge round hand, \"Sarah Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirteen_\r\n\r\nMRS. GREY GIVES A DINNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Charles Smith, Miss Sarah's brother, was walking swiftly uptown\r\nfrom Mr. Easterly's Wall Street office and his face was pale. At last\r\nthe Cotton Combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was\r\nslated for the Senate. The price he had paid was high: he was to\r\nrepresent the interests of the new trust and sundry favorable measures\r\nwere already drafted and reposing in the safe of the combine's legal\r\ndepartment. Among others was one relating to child labor, another that\r\nwould effect certain changes in the tariff, and a proposed law providing\r\nfor a cotton bale of a shape and dimensions different from the\r\ncustomary--the last constituting a particularly clever artifice which,\r\nunder the guise of convenience in handling, would necessitate the\r\ninstallation of entirely new gin and compress machinery, to be supplied,\r\nof course, by the trust.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Smith drew near Mrs. Grey's Murray Hill residence his face had\r\nmelted to a cynical smile. After all why should he care? He had tried\r\nindependence and philanthropy and failed. Why should he not be as other\r\nmen? He had seen many others that very day swallow the golden bait and\r\npromise everything. They were gentlemen. Why should he pose as better\r\nthan his fellows? There was young Cresswell. Did his aristocratic air\r\nprevent his succumbing to the lure of millions and promising the\r\ninfluence of his father and the whole Farmer's League to the new\r\nproject? Mr. Smith snapped his fingers and rang the bell. The door\r\nopened softly. The dark woodwork of the old English wainscoting glowed\r\nwith the crimson flaming of logs in the wide fireplace. There was just\r\nthe touch of early autumn chill in the air without, that made both the\r\nfire and the table with its soft linen, gold and silver plate, and\r\ntwinkling glasses a warming, satisfying sight.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey was a portly woman, inclined to think much of her dinner and\r\nher clothes, both of which were always rich and costly. She was not\r\nherself a notably intelligent woman; she greatly admired intelligence or\r\nwhatever looked to her like intelligence in others. Her money, too, was\r\nto her an ever worrying mystery and surprise, which she found herself\r\nalways scheming to husband shrewdly and spend philanthropically--a\r\ndifficult combination.\r\n\r\nAs she awaited her guests she surveyed the table with both satisfaction\r\nand disquietude, for her social functions were few, tonight there\r\nwere--she checked them off on her fingers--Sir James Creighton, the rich\r\nEnglish manufacturer, and Lady Creighton, Mr. and Mrs. Vanderpool, Mr.\r\nHarry Cresswell and his sister, John Taylor and his sister, and Mr.\r\nCharles Smith, whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be United\r\nStates Senator from New Jersey--a selection of guests that had been\r\ndetermined, unknown to the hostess, by the meeting of cotton interests\r\nearlier in the day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey's chef was high-priced and efficient, and her butler was the\r\nenvy of many; consequently, she knew the dinner would be good. To her\r\nintense satisfaction, it was far more than this. It was a most agreeable\r\ncouple of hours; all save perhaps Mr. Smith unbent, the Englishman\r\nespecially, and the Vanderpools were most gracious; but if the general\r\npleasure was owing to any one person particularly it was to Mr. Harry\r\nCresswell. Mrs. Grey had met Southerners before, but not intimately, and\r\nshe always had in mind vividly their cruelty to \"poor Negroes,\" a\r\nsubject she made a point of introducing forthwith. She was therefore\r\nmost agreeably surprised to hear Mr. Cresswell express himself so\r\ncordially as approving of Negro education.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I thought,\" said Mrs. Grey, \"that you Southerners rather\r\ndisapproved--or at least--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cresswell inclined his head courteously.\r\n\r\n\"We Southerners, my dear Mrs. Grey, are responsible for a variety of\r\nreputations.\" And he told an anecdote that set the table laughing.\r\n\"Seriously, though,\" he continued, \"we are not as black as the blacks\r\npaint us, although on the whole I _prefer_ that Helen should marry--a\r\nwhite man.\"\r\n\r\nThey all glanced at Miss Cresswell, who lay softly back in her chair\r\nlike a white lily, gleaming and bejewelled, her pale face flushing under\r\nthe scrutiny; Mrs. Grey was horrified.\r\n\r\n\"Why--why the idea!\" she sputtered. \"Why, Mr. Cresswell, how can you\r\nconceive of anything else--no Northerner dreams--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cresswell sipped his wine slowly.\r\n\r\n\"No--no--I do not think you do _mean_ that--\" He paused and the\r\nEnglishman bent forward.\r\n\r\n\"Really, now, you do not mean to say that there is a danger of--of\r\namalgamation, do you?\" he sang.\r\n\r\nMr. Cresswell explained. No, of course there was no immediate danger;\r\nbut when people were suddenly thrust beyond their natural station,\r\nfilled with wild ideas and impossible ambitions, it meant terrible\r\ndanger to Southern white women.\r\n\r\n\"But you believe in some education?\" asked Mary Taylor.\r\n\r\n\"I believe in the training of people to their highest capacity.\" The\r\nEnglishman here heartily seconded him.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" Cresswell added significantly, \"capacity differs enormously\r\nbetween races.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vanderpools were sure of this and the Englishman, instancing India,\r\nbecame quite eloquent. Mrs. Grey was mystified, but hardly dared admit\r\nit. The general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most\r\nindividuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being\r\nallowed much education, and as for the \"lower races\" it was simply\r\ncriminal to open such useless opportunities to them.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I had a colored servant-girl once,\" laughed Mrs. Vanderpool by way\r\nof climax, \"who spent half her wages in piano lessons.\"\r\n\r\nThen Mary Taylor, whose conscience was uncomfortable, said:\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Cresswell, you surely believe in schools like Miss Smith's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Decidedly,\" returned Mr. Cresswell, with enthusiasm, \"it has done great\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey was gratified and murmured something of Miss Smith's\r\n\"sacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Positively heroic,\" added Cresswell, avoiding his sister's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Mary Taylor hastened to encourage this turn of the\r\nconversation, \"there are many points on which Miss Smith and I disagree,\r\nbut I think everybody admires her work.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey wanted particulars. \"What did you disagree about?\" she asked\r\nbluntly.\r\n\r\n\"I may be responsible for some of the disagreement,\" interrupted Mr.\r\nCresswell, hesitatingly; \"I'm afraid Miss Smith does not approve of us\r\nwhite Southerners.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you mean to say you can't even advise her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; we can. But--we're not--er--exactly welcomed. In fact,\" said\r\nCresswell gravely, \"the chief criticism I have against your Northerners'\r\nschools for Negroes is, that they not only fail to enlist the sympathy\r\nand aid of the _best_ Southerners, but even repel it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very wrong--very wrong,\" commented the Englishman warmly, a\r\nsentiment in which Mrs. Grey hastened to agree.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" continued Cresswell, \"I am free to confess that I have no\r\npersonal desire to dabble in philanthropy, or conduct schools of any\r\nkind; my hands are full of other matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's precisely the advice of such disinterested men that\r\nphilanthropic work needs,\" Mr. Vanderpool urged.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I volunteered advice once in this case and I sha'n't repeat the\r\nexperiment soon,\" said Cresswell laughing. Mrs. Grey wanted to hear the\r\nincident, but the young man was politely reluctant. Mary Taylor,\r\nhowever, related the tale of Zora to Mrs. Grey's private ear later.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately,\" said Mr. Vanderpool, \"Northerners and Southerners are\r\narriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" Cresswell agreed. \"After all, they never were far apart,\r\neven in slavery days; both sides were honest and sincere.\"\r\n\r\nAll through the dinner Mr. Smith had been preoccupied and taciturn. Now\r\nhe abruptly shot a glance at Cresswell.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that one was right and one was wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Cresswell, \"both were right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought the only excuse for fighting was a great Right; if Right is\r\non neither side or simultaneously on both, then War is not only Hell but\r\nDamnation.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey looked shocked and Mrs. Vanderpool smiled.\r\n\r\n\"How about fighting for exercise?\" she suggested.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate,\" said Cresswell, \"we can all agree on helping these poor\r\nvictims of our quarrel as far as their limited capacity will allow--and\r\nno farther, for that is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nVery soon after dinner Charles Smith excused himself. He was not yet\r\ninured to the ways of high finance, and the programme of the cotton\r\nbarons, as unfolded that day, lay heavy on his mind, despite all his\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a--full day,\" he explained to Mrs. Grey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fourteen_\r\n\r\nLOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rain was sweeping down in great thick winding sheets. The wind\r\nscreamed in the ancient Cresswell oaks and swirled across the swamp in\r\nloud, wild gusts. The waters roared and gurgled in the streams, and\r\nalong the roadside. Then, when the wind fell murmuring away, the clouds\r\ngrew blacker and blacker and rain in long slim columns fell straight\r\nfrom Heaven to earth digging itself into the land and throwing back the\r\nred mud in angry flashes.\r\n\r\nSo it rained for one long week, and so for seven endless days Bles\r\nwatched it with leaden heart. He knew the Silver Fleece--his and\r\nZora's--must be ruined. It was the first great sorrow of his life; it\r\nwas not so much the loss of the cotton itself--but the fantasy, the\r\nhopes, the dreams built around it. If it failed, would not they fail?\r\nWas not this angry beating rain, this dull spiritless drizzle, this wild\r\nwar of air and earth, but foretaste and prophecy of ruin and\r\ndiscouragement, of the utter futility of striving? But if his own\r\ndespair was great his pain at the plight of Zora made it almost\r\nunbearable. He did not see her in these seven days. He pictured her\r\nhuddled there in the swamp in the cheerless leaky cabin with worse than\r\nno companions. Ah! the swamp, the cruel swamp! It was a fearful place in\r\nthe rain. Its oozing mud and fetid vapors, its clinging slimy\r\ndraperies,--how they twined about the bones of its victims and chilled\r\ntheir hearts. Yet here his Zora,--his poor disappointed child--was\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nChild? He had always called her child--but now in the inward\r\nillumination of these dark days he knew her as neither child nor sister\r\nnor friend, but as the One Woman. The revelation of his love lighted and\r\nbrightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in\r\nburning wonder. He panted to know if she, too, knew, or knew and cared\r\nnot, or cared and knew not. She was so strange and human a creature. To\r\nher all things meant something--nothing was aimless, nothing merely\r\nhappened. Was this rain beating down and back her love for him, or had\r\nshe never loved? He walked his room, gripping his hands, peering through\r\nthe misty windows toward the swamp--rain, rain, rain, nothing but rain.\r\nThe world was water veiled in mists.\r\n\r\nThen of a sudden, at midday, the sun shot out, hot and still; no breath\r\nof air stirred; the sky was like blue steel; the earth steamed. Bles\r\nrushed to the edge of the swamp and stood there irresolute. Perhaps--if\r\nthe water had but drained from the cotton!--it was so strong and tall!\r\nBut, pshaw! Where was the use of imagining? The lagoon had been level\r\nwith the dykes a week ago; and now? He could almost see the beautiful\r\nSilver Fleece, bedraggled, drowned, and rolling beneath the black lake\r\nof slime. He went back to his work, but early in the morning the thought\r\nof it lured him again. He must at least see the grave of his hope and\r\nZora's, and out of it resurrect new love and strength.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she, too, might be there, waiting, weeping. He started at the\r\nthought. He hurried forth sadly. The rain-drops were still dripping and\r\ngleaming from the trees, flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight. He\r\nsplashed and stamped along, farther and farther onward until he neared\r\nthe rampart of the clearing, and put foot upon the tree-bridge. Then he\r\nlooked down. The lagoon was dry. He stood a moment bewildered, then\r\nturned and rushed upon the island. A great sheet of dazzling sunlight\r\nswept the place, and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green, thick,\r\ntall, wet, and willowy. The squares of cotton, sharp-edged, heavy, were\r\njust about to burst to bolls! And underneath, the land lay carefully\r\ndrained and black! For one long moment he paused, stupid, agape with\r\nutter amazement, then leaned dizzily against a tree.\r\n\r\nThe swamp, the eternal swamp, had been drained in its deepest fastness;\r\nbut, how?--how? He gazed about, perplexed, astonished. What a field of\r\ncotton! what a marvellous field! But how had it been saved?\r\n\r\nHe skirted the island slowly, stopping near Zora's oak. Here lay the\r\nreading of the riddle: with infinite work and pain, some one had dug a\r\ncanal from the lagoon to the creek, into which the former had drained by\r\na long and crooked way, thus allowing it to empty directly. The canal\r\nwent straight, a hundred yards through stubborn soil, and it was oozing\r\nnow with slimy waters.\r\n\r\nHe sat down weak, bewildered, and one thought was uppermost--Zora! And\r\nwith the thought came a low moan of pain. He wheeled and leapt toward\r\nthe dripping shelter in the tree. There she lay--wet, bedraggled,\r\nmotionless, gray-pallid beneath her dark-drawn skin, her burning eyes\r\nsearching restlessly for some lost thing, her lips a-moaning.\r\n\r\nIn dumb despair he dropped beside her and gathered her in his arms. The\r\nearth staggered beneath him as he stumbled on; the mud splashed and\r\nsunlight glistened; he saw long snakes slithering across his path and\r\nfear-struck beasts fleeing before his coming. He paused for neither path\r\nnor way but went straight for the school, running in mighty strides, yet\r\ngently, listening to the moans that struck death upon his heart. Once he\r\nfell headlong, but with a great wrench held her from harm, and minded\r\nnot the pain that shot through his ribs. The yellow sunshine beat\r\nfiercely around and upon him, as he stumbled into the highway, lurched\r\nacross the mud-strewn road, and panted up the porch.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith--!\" he gasped, and then--darkness.\r\n\r\nThe years of the days of her dying were ten. The boy that entered the\r\ndarkness and the shadow of death emerged a man, a silent man and grave,\r\nworking furiously and haunting, day and night, the little window above\r\nthe door. At last, of one gray morning when the earth was stillest, they\r\ncame and told him, \"She will live!\" And he went out under the stars,\r\nlifted his long arms and sobbed: \"Curse me, O God, if I let me lose her\r\nagain!\" And God remembered this in after years.\r\n\r\nThe hope and dream of harvest was upon the land. The cotton crop was\r\nshort and poor because of the great rain; but the sun had saved the\r\nbest, and the price had soared. So the world was happy, and the face of\r\nthe black-belt green and luxuriant with thickening flecks of the coming\r\nfoam of the cotton.\r\n\r\nUp in the sick room Zora lay on the little white bed. The net and web of\r\nendless things had been crawling and creeping around her; she had\r\nstruggled in dumb, speechless terror against some mighty grasping that\r\nstrove for her life, with gnarled and creeping fingers; but now at last,\r\nweakly, she opened her eyes and questioned.\r\n\r\nBles, where was he? The Silver Fleece, how was it? The Sun, the Swamp?\r\nThen finding all well, she closed her eyes and slept. After some days\r\nthey let her sit by the window, and she saw Bles pass, but drew back\r\ntimidly when he looked; and he saw only the flutter of her gown, and\r\nwaved.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a day when they let her walk down to the porch, and\r\nshe felt the flickering of her strength again. Yet she looked different;\r\nher buxom comeliness was spiritualized; her face looked smaller, and her\r\nmasses of hair, brought low about her ears, heightened her ghostly\r\nbeauty; her skin was darkly transparent, and her eyes looked out from\r\nvelvet veils of gloom. For a while she lay in her chair, in happy,\r\ndreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree. Bles did not know yet that she\r\nwas down; but soon he would come searching, for he came each hour, and\r\nshe pressed her little hands against her breast to still the beating of\r\nher heart and the bursting wonder of her love.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly a panic seized her. He must not find her here--not here;\r\nthere was but one place in all the earth for them to meet, and that was\r\nyonder in the Silver Fleece. She rose with a fleeting glance, gathered\r\nthe shawl round her, then gliding forward, wavering, tremulous, slipped\r\nacross the road and into the swamp. The dark mystery of the Swamp swept\r\nover her; the place was hers. She had been born within its borders;\r\nwithin its borders she had lived and grown, and within its borders she\r\nhad met her love. On she hurried until, sweeping down to the lagoon and\r\nthe island, lo! the cotton lay before her! A great white foam was spread\r\nupon its brown and green; the whole field was waving and shivering in\r\nthe sunlight. A low cry of pleasure burst from her lips; she forgot her\r\nweakness, and picking her way across the bridge, stood still amid the\r\ncotton that nestled about her shoulders, clasping it lovingly in her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nHe heard that she was down-stairs and ran to meet her with beating\r\nheart. The chair was empty; but he knew. There was but one place then\r\nfor these two souls to meet. Yet it was far, and he feared, and ran with\r\nstartled eyes.\r\n\r\nShe stood on the island, ethereal, splendid, like some tall, dark, and\r\ngorgeous flower of the storied East. The green and white of the cotton\r\nbillowed and foamed about her breasts; the red scarf burned upon her\r\nneck; the dark brown velvet of her skin pulsed warm and tremulous with\r\nthe uprushing blood, and in the midnight depths of her great eyes flamed\r\nthe mighty fires of long-concealed and new-born love.\r\n\r\nHe darted through the trees and paused, a tall man strongly but slimly\r\nmade. He threw up his hands in the old way and hallooed; happily she\r\ncrooned back a low mother-melody, and waited. He came down to her\r\nslowly, with fixed, hungry eyes, threading his way amid the Fleece. She\r\ndid not move, but lifted both her dark hands, white with cotton; and\r\nthen, as he came, casting it suddenly to the winds, in tears and\r\nlaughter she swayed and dropped quivering in his arms. And all the world\r\nwas sunshine and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fifteen_\r\n\r\nREVELATION\r\n\r\n\r\nHarry Cresswell was scowling over his breakfast. It was not because his\r\napartment in the New York hotel was not satisfactory, or his breakfast\r\nunpalatable; possibly a rather bewildering night in Broadway was\r\nexpressing its influence; but he was satisfied that his ill-temper was\r\ndue to a paragraph in the morning paper:\r\n\r\n\"It is stated on good authority that the widow of the late\r\nmultimillionaire, Job Grey, will announce a large and carefully planned\r\nscheme of Negro education in the South, and will richly endow schools in\r\nSouth Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell finally thrust his food away. He knew that Mrs. Grey helped\r\nMiss Smith's school, and supposed she would continue to do so; with that\r\nin mind he had striven to impress her, hoping that she might trust his\r\njudgment in later years. He had no idea, however, that she meant to\r\nendow the school, or entertained wholesale plans for Negro education.\r\nThe knowledge made him suspicious. Why had neither Mary nor John Taylor\r\nmentioned this? Was there, after all, some \"nigger-loving\" conspiracy\r\nback of the cotton combine? He took his hat and started down-town.\r\n\r\nOnce in John Taylor's Broadway office, he opened the subject\r\nabruptly--the more so perhaps because he felt a resentment against\r\nTaylor for certain unnamed or partially voiced assumptions. Here was a\r\nplace, however, for speech, and he spoke almost roughly.\r\n\r\n\"Taylor, what does this mean?\" He thrust the clipping at him.\r\n\r\n\"Mean? That Mrs. Grey is going to get rid of some of her surplus\r\ncash--is going to endow some nigger schools,\" Taylor drily retorted.\r\n\r\n\"It must be stopped,\" declared Cresswell.\r\n\r\nThe other's brows drew up.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" in a surprised tone.\r\n\r\n\"Why? Why? Do you think the plantation system can be maintained without\r\nlaborers? Do you think there's the slightest chance of cornering cotton\r\nand buying the Black Belt if the niggers are unwilling to work under\r\npresent conditions? Do you know the man that stands ready to gobble up\r\nevery inch of cotton land in this country at a price which no trust can\r\nhope to rival?\"\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor's interest quickened.\r\n\r\n\"Why, no,\" he returned sharply. \"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Black Man, whose woolly head is filled with ideas of rising. We're\r\nstriving by main force to prevent this, and here come your damned\r\nNorthern philanthropists to plant schools. Why, Taylor, it'll knock the\r\ncotton trust to hell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't get excited,\" said Taylor, judicially. \"We've got things in our\r\nhands; it's the Grey money, you know, that is back of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what confounds me,\" declared the perplexed young man. \"Are\r\nyou men fools, or rascals? Don't you see the two schemes can't mix?\r\nThey're dead opposite, mutually contradictory, absolutely--\" Taylor\r\nchecked him; it was odd to behold Harry Cresswell so disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, wait a moment. Let's see. Sit down. Wish I had a cigar for you,\r\nbut I don't smoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you happen to have any whiskey handy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what the devil--Oh, well, fire away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here. We control the Grey millions. Of course, we've got to\r\nlet her play with her income, and that's considerable. Her favorite game\r\njust now is Negro education, and she's planning to go in heavy. Her\r\nadviser in this line, however, is Smith, and he belongs to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the man who's going to be Senator from New Jersey. He has a sister\r\nteaching in the South--you know, of course; it's at your home where my\r\nsister Mary taught.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott! Is that woman's brother going to spend this money? Why,\r\nare you daft? See here! American cotton-spinning supremacy is built on\r\ncheap cotton; cheap cotton is built on cheap niggers. Educating, or\r\nrather _trying_ to educate niggers, will make them restless and\r\ndiscontented--that is, scarce and dear as workers. Don't you see you're\r\nplanning to cut off your noses? This Smith School, particularly, has\r\nnearly ruined our plantation. It's stuck almost in our front yard; _you_\r\nare planning to put our plough-hands all to studying Greek, and at the\r\nsame time to corner the cotton crop--rot!\"\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor caressed his lean jaw.\r\n\r\n\"New point of view to me; I sort of thought education would improve\r\nthings in the South,\" he commented, unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"It would if we ran it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--we Southerners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um!--I see--there's light. See here, let's talk to Easterly about\r\nthis.\" They went into the next office, and after a while got audience\r\nwith the trust magnate. Mr. Easterly heard the matter carefully and\r\nwaved it aside.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that doesn't concern us, Taylor; let Cresswell take care of the\r\nwhole thing. We'll see that Smith does what Cresswell wants.\"\r\n\r\nBut Taylor shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Smith would kick. Mrs. Grey would get suspicious, and the devil be to\r\npay. This is better. Form a big committee of Northern business men like\r\nyourself--philanthropists like Vanderpool, and Southerners like\r\nCresswell; let them be a sort of Negro Education steering-committee.\r\nWe'll see that on such committee you Southerners get what you\r\nwant--control of Negro education.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds fair. But how about the Smith School? My father writes me\r\nthat they are showing signs of expecting money right off--is that true?\r\nIf it is, I want it stopped; it will ruin our campaign for the Farmers'\r\nLeague.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor looked at Cresswell. He thought he saw something more than\r\ngeneral policy, or even racial prejudice--something personal--in his\r\nvehemence. The Smith School was evidently a severe thorn in the flesh of\r\nthis man. All the more reason for mollifying him. Then, too, there was\r\nsomething in his argument. It was not wise to start educating these\r\nNegroes and getting them discontented just now. Ignorant labor was not\r\nideal, but it was worth too much to employers to lose it now. Educated\r\nNegro labor might be worth more to Negroes, but not to the cotton\r\ncombine. \"H'm--well, then--\" and John Taylor went into a brown study,\r\nwhile Cresswell puffed impatiently at a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"I have it,\" said Taylor. Cresswell sat up. \"First, let Mr. Easterly get\r\nSmith.\" Easterly turned to the telephone.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is Easterly.... Yes--how about Mrs. Grey's education\r\nschemes?... Yes.... h'm--well,--see here Smith, we must go a little easy\r\nthere.... Oh, no, no,--but to advertise just now a big scheme of Negro\r\nEducation would drive the Cresswells, the Farmers' League, and the whole\r\nbusiness South dead against us.... Yes, yes indeed; they believe in\r\neducation all right, but they ain't in for training lawyers and\r\nprofessors just yet.... No, I don't suppose her school is.... Well,\r\nthen; see here. She'll be reasonable, won't she, and placate the\r\nCresswells?... No, I mean run the school to suit their ideas.... No, no,\r\nbut in general along the lines which they could approve.... Yes, I\r\nthought so ... of course ... good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Inclined to be a little nasty?\" asked Taylor.\r\n\r\n\"A little sharp--but tractable. Now, Mr. Cresswell, the thing is in your\r\nhands. We'll get this committee which Taylor suggests appointed, and\r\nsend it on a junket to Alabama; you do the rest--see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who'll be the committee?\" asked Cresswell.\r\n\r\n\"Name it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cresswell smiled and left.\r\n\r\nThe winter started in severely, and it was easy to fill two private cars\r\nwith members of the new Negro Education Board right after Thanksgiving.\r\nCresswell had worked carefully and with caution. There was Mrs. Grey,\r\ncomfortable and beaming, Mr. Easterly, who thought this a good business\r\nopportunity, and his family. Mrs. Vanderpool liked the South and was\r\namused at the trip, and had induced Mr. Vanderpool to come by stories of\r\nshooting.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Vanderpool.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Smith and John Taylor were both too busy to go, but\r\nbronchial trouble induced the Rev. Dr. Boldish of St. Faith's rich\r\nparish to be one of the party, and at the last moment Temple Bocombe,\r\nthe sociologist, consented to join.\r\n\r\n\"Awfully busy,\" he said, \"but I've been reading up on the Negro problem\r\nsince you mentioned the matter to me last week, Mr. Cresswell, and I\r\nthink I understand it thoroughly. I may be able to help out.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessary spice of young womanhood was added to the party by Miss\r\nTaylor and Miss Cresswell, together with the silent Miss Boldish. They\r\nwere a comfortable and sometimes merry party. Dr. Boldish pointed out\r\nthe loafers at the stations, especially the black ones; Mr. Bocombe\r\ncounted them and estimated the number of hours of work lost at ten cents\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\n\"Do they get that--ten cents an hour?\" asked Miss Taylor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" replied Mr. Bocombe; \"but suppose they do, for\r\ninstance. That is an average wage today.\"\r\n\r\n\"They look lazy,\" said Mrs. Grey.\r\n\r\n\"They are lazy,\" said Mr. Cresswell.\r\n\r\n\"So am I,\" added Mrs. Vanderpool, suppressing a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"It is uninteresting,\" murmured her husband, preparing for a nap.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the members of the party enjoyed themselves from the moment\r\nthey drew out of Jersey City to the afternoon when, in four carriages,\r\nthey rolled beneath the curious eyes of all Toomsville and swept under\r\nthe shadowed rampart of the swamp.\r\n\r\n\"The Christmas\" was coming and all the Southern world was busy. Few\r\npeople were busier than Bles and Zora. Slowly, wonderfully for them,\r\nheaven bent in these dying days of the year and kissed the earth, and\r\nthe tremor thrilled all lands and seas. Everything was good, all things\r\nwere happy, and these two were happiest of all. Out of the shadows and\r\nhesitations of childhood they had stepped suddenly into manhood and\r\nwomanhood, with firm feet and uplifted heads. All the day that was\r\ntheirs they worked, picking the Silver Fleece--picking it tenderly and\r\nlovingly from off the brown and spent bodies which had so utterly\r\nyielded life and beauty to the full fruition of this long and silken\r\ntendril, this white beauty of the cotton. November came and flew, and\r\nstill the unexhausted field yielded its frothing fruit.\r\n\r\nToday seemed doubly glorious, for Bles had spoken of their marriage;\r\nwith twined hands and arms, and lips ever and again seeking their mates,\r\nthey walked the leafy way.\r\n\r\nUnconscious, rapt, they stepped out into the Big Road skirting the edge\r\nof the swamp. Why not? Was it not the King's Highway? And Love was King.\r\nSo they talked on, unknowing that far up the road the Cresswell coaches\r\nwere wheeling along with precious burdens. In the first carriage were\r\nMrs. Grey and Mrs. Vanderpool, Mr. Cresswell and Miss Taylor. Mrs.\r\nVanderpool was lolling luxuriously, but Mrs. Grey was a little stiff\r\nfrom long travel and sat upright. Mr. Cresswell looked clean-cut and\r\nhandsome, and Miss Taylor seemed complacent and responsible. The dying\r\nof the day soothed them all insensibly. Groups of dark little children\r\npassed them as they neared the school, staring with wide eyes and\r\ngreeting timidly.\r\n\r\n\"There seems to be marrying and giving in marriage,\" laughed Mrs.\r\nVanderpool.\r\n\r\n\"Not very much,\" said Mr. Cresswell drily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, at least plenty of children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where are the houses?\" asked Mrs. Grey.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps in the swamp,\" said Mrs. Vanderpool lightly, looking up at the\r\nsombre trees that lined the left.\r\n\r\n\"They live where they please and do as they please,\" Cresswell\r\nexplained; to which Mrs. Vanderpool added: \"Like other animals.\"\r\n\r\nMary Taylor opened her lips to rebuke this levity when suddenly the\r\ncoachman called out and the horses swerved, and the carriage's four\r\noccupants faced a young man and a young woman embracing heartily.\r\n\r\nOut through the wood Bles and Zora had come to the broad red road;\r\nplayfully he celebrated all her beauty unconscious of time and place.\r\n\r\n\"You are tall and bend like grasses on the swamp,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"And yet look up to you,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Your eyes are darkness dressed in night.\"\r\n\r\n\"To see you brighter, dear,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Your little hands are much too frail for work.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must grow larger, then, and soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your feet are far too small to travel on.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll travel on to you--that's far enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your lips--your full and purple lips--were made alone for kissing, not\r\nfor words.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll do for both.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed in utter joy and touched her hair with light caressing hands.\r\n\r\n\"It does not fly with sunlight,\" she said quickly, with an upward\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered. \"It sits and listens to the night.\"\r\n\r\nBut even as she nestled to him happily there came the harsh thunder of\r\nhorses' hoofs, beating on their ears. He drew her quickly to him in\r\nfear, and the coach lurched and turned, and left them facing four pairs\r\nof eyes. Miss Taylor reddened; Mrs. Grey looked surprised; Mrs.\r\nVanderpool smiled; but Mr. Cresswell darkened with anger. The couple\r\nunclasped shamefacedly, and the young man, lifting his hat, started to\r\nstammer an apology; but Cresswell interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\"Keep your--your philandering to the woods, or I shall have you\r\narrested,\" he said slowly, his face colorless, his lips twitching with\r\nanger. \"Drive on, John.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Taylor felt that her worst suspicions had been confirmed; but Mrs.\r\nVanderpool was curious as to the cause of Cresswell's anger. It was so\r\ngenuine that it needed explanation.\r\n\r\n\"Are kisses illegal here?\" she asked before the horses started, turning\r\nthe battery of her eyes full upon him. But Cresswell had himself well in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"But the girl is--notorious.\"\r\n\r\nOn the lovers the words fell like a blow. Zora shivered, and a grayish\r\nhorror mottled the dark burning of her face. Bles started in anger, then\r\npaused in shivering doubt. What had happened? They knew not; yet\r\ninvoluntarily their hands fell apart; they avoided each other's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I--I must go now,\" gasped Zora, as the carriage swept away.\r\n\r\nHe did not hold her, he did not offer the farewell kiss, but stood\r\nstaring at the road as she walked into the swamp. A moment she paused\r\nand looked back; then slowly, almost painfully, she took the path back\r\nto the field of the Fleece, and reaching it after long, long minutes,\r\nbegan mechanically to pick the cotton. But the cotton glowed crimson in\r\nthe failing sun.\r\n\r\nBles walked toward the school. What had happened? he kept asking. And\r\nyet he dared not question the awful shape that sat somewhere, cold and\r\nstill, behind his soul. He heard the hoofs of horses again. It was Miss\r\nTaylor being brought back to the school to greet Miss Smith and break\r\nthe news of the coming of the party. He raised his hat. She did not\r\nreturn the greeting, but he found her pausing at the gate. It seemed to\r\nher too awful for this foolish fellow thus to throw himself away. She\r\nfaced him and he flinched as from some descending blow.\r\n\r\n\"Bles,\" she said primly, \"have you absolutely no shame?\"\r\n\r\nHe braced himself and raised his head proudly.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to marry her; it is no crime.\" Then he noted the expression\r\non her face, and paused.\r\n\r\nShe stepped back, scandalized.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be, Bles Alwyn,\" she said, \"that you don't know the sort of girl\r\nshe is?\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his hands and warded off her words, dumbly, as she turned to\r\ngo, almost frightened at the havoc she saw. The heavens flamed scarlet\r\nin his eyes and he screamed.\r\n\r\n\"It's a lie! It's a damned lie!\" He wheeled about and tore into the\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\n\"It's a damned lie!\" he shouted to the trees. \"Is it?--is it?\" chirped\r\nthe birds. \"It's a cruel falsehood!\" he moaned. \"Is it?--is it?\"\r\nwhispered the devils within.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him as though suddenly the world was staggering and\r\nfaltering about him. The trees bent curiously and strange breathings\r\nwere upon the breezes. He unbuttoned his collar that he might get more\r\nair. A thousand things he had forgotten surged suddenly to life. Slower\r\nand slower he ran, more and more the thoughts crowded his head. He\r\nthought of that first red night and the yelling and singing and wild\r\ndancing; he thought of Cresswell's bitter words; he thought of Zora\r\ntelling how she stayed out nights; he thought of the little bower that\r\nhe had built her in the cotton field. A wild fear struggled with his\r\nanger, but he kept repeating, \"No, no,\" and then, \"At any rate, she will\r\ntell me the truth.\" She had never lied to him; she would not dare; he\r\nclenched his hands, murder in his heart.\r\n\r\nSlowly and more slowly he ran. He knew where she was--where she must be,\r\nwaiting. And yet as he drew near huge hands held him back, and heavy\r\nweights clogged his feet. His heart said: \"On! quick! She will tell the\r\ntruth, and all will be well.\" His mind said: \"Slow, slow; this is the\r\nend.\" He hurled the thought aside, and crashed through the barrier.\r\n\r\nShe was standing still and listening, with a huge basket of the piled\r\nfroth of the field upon her head. One long brown arm, tender with\r\ncurvings, balanced the cotton; the other, poised, balanced the slim\r\nswaying body. Bending she listened, her eyes shining, her lips apart,\r\nher bosom fluttering at the well-known step.\r\n\r\nHe burst into her view with the fury of a beast, rending the wood away\r\nand trampling the underbrush, reeling and muttering until he saw her.\r\nShe looked at him. Her hands dropped, she stood very still with drawn\r\nface, grayish-brown, both hands unconsciously out-stretched, and the\r\ncotton swaying, while deep down in her eyes, dimly, slowly, a horror lit\r\nand grew. He paused a moment, then came slowly onward doggedly,\r\ndrunkenly, with torn clothes, flying collar, and red eyes. Then he\r\npaused again, still beyond arm's-length, looking at her with fear-struck\r\neyes. The cotton on her head shivered and dropped in a pure mass of\r\nwhite and silvery snow about her limbs. Her hands fell limply and the\r\nhorror flamed in her wet eyes. He struggled with his voice but it grated\r\nand came hoarse and hard from his quivering throat.\r\n\r\n\"Zora!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Bles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You--you told me--you were--pure.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent, but her body went all a-tremble. He stepped forward\r\nuntil she could almost touch him; there standing straight and tall he\r\nglared down upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Answer me,\" he whispered in a voice hard with its tight held sobs. A\r\nmisery darkened her face and the light died from her eyes, yet she\r\nlooked at him bravely and her voice came low and full as from afar.\r\n\r\n\"I asked you what it meant to be pure, Bles, and--and you told--and I\r\ntold you the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"What it meant!--what it meant!\" he repeated in the low, tense anguish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But--but, Bles--\" She faltered; there came an awful pleading in her\r\neyes; her hand groped toward him; but he stepped slowly back--\"But,\r\nBles--you said--willingly--you said--if--if she knew--\"\r\n\r\nHe thundered back in livid anger:\r\n\r\n\"Knew! All women know! You should have _died_!\"\r\n\r\nSobs were rising and shaking her from head to foot, but she drove them\r\nback and gripped her breasts with her hands.\r\n\r\n\"No, Bles--no--all girls do not know. I was a child. Not since I knew\r\nyou, Bles--never, never since I saw you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since--since,\" he groaned--\"Christ! But before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, before.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God!\"\r\n\r\nShe knew the end had come. Yet she babbled on tremblingly:\r\n\r\n\"He was our master, and all the other girls that gathered there did his\r\nwill; I--I--\" she choked and faltered, and he drew farther away--\"I\r\nbegan running away, and they hunted me through the swamps. And\r\nthen--then I reckon I'd have gone back and been--as they all are--but\r\nyou came, Bles--you came, and you--you were a new great thing in my\r\nlife, and--and--yet, I was afraid I was not worthy until you--you said\r\nthe words. I thought you knew, and I thought that--that purity was just\r\nwanting to be pure.\"\r\n\r\nHe ground his teeth in fury. Oh, he was an innocent--a blind baby--the\r\njoke and laughing-stock of the country around, with yokels grinning at\r\nhim and pale-faced devils laughing aloud. The teachers knew; the girls\r\nknew; God knew; everybody but he knew--poor blind, deaf mole, stupid\r\njackass that he was. He must run--run away from this world, and far off\r\nin some free land beat back this pain.\r\n\r\nThen in sheer weariness the anger died within his soul, leaving but\r\nashes and despair. Slowly he turned away, but with a quick motion she\r\nstood in his path.\r\n\r\n\"Bles,\" she cried, \"how can I grow pure?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her listlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Never--never again,\" he slowly answered her.\r\n\r\nDark fear swept her drawn face.\r\n\r\n\"Never?\" she gasped.\r\n\r\nPity surged and fought in his breast; but one thought held and burned\r\nhim. He bent to her fiercely:\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nShe pointed toward the Cresswell Oaks, and he turned away. She did not\r\nattempt to stop him again, but dropped her hands and stared drearily up\r\ninto the clear sky with its shining worlds.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Bles,\" she said slowly. \"I thank God he gave you to me--just\r\na little time.\" She hesitated and waited. There came no word as the man\r\nmoved slowly away. She stood motionless. Then slowly he turned and came\r\nback. He laid his hand a moment, lightly, upon her head.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye--Zora,\" he sobbed, and was gone.\r\n\r\nShe did not look up, but knelt there silent, dry-eyed, till the last\r\nrustle of his going died in the night. And then, like a waiting storm,\r\nthe torrent of her grief swept down upon her; she stretched herself upon\r\nthe black and fleece-strewn earth, and writhed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sixteen_\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT REFUSAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAll night Miss Smith lay holding the quivering form of Zora close to her\r\nbreast, staring wide-eyed into the darkness--thinking, thinking. In the\r\nmorning the party would come. There would be Mrs. Grey and Mary Taylor,\r\nMrs. Vanderpool, who had left her so coldly in the lurch before, and\r\nsome of the Cresswells. They would come well fed and impressed with the\r\ncharming hospitality of their hosts, and rather more than willing to see\r\nthrough those host's eyes. They would be in a hurry to return to some\r\nsocial function, and would give her work but casual attention.\r\n\r\nIt seemed so dark an ending to so bright a dream. Never for her had a\r\nfall opened as gloriously. The love of this boy and girl, blossoming as\r\nit had beneath her tender care, had been a sacred, wonderful history\r\nthat revived within her memories of long-forgotten days. But above lay\r\nthe vision of her school, redeemed and enlarged, its future safe, its\r\nusefulness broadened--small wonder that to Sarah Smith the future had\r\nseemed in November almost golden.\r\n\r\nThen things began to go wrong. The transfer of the Tolliver land had not\r\nyet been effected; the money was ready, but Mr. Tolliver seemed busy or\r\nhesitating. Next came this news of Mrs. Grey's probable conditions. So\r\nhere it was Christmas time, and Sarah Smith's castles lay almost in\r\nruins about her.\r\n\r\nThe girl moaned in her fitful sleep and Miss Smith soothed her. Poor\r\nchild! here too was work--a strange strong soul cruelly stricken in her\r\nyouth. Could she be brought back to a useful life? How she needed such a\r\nstrong, clear-eyed helper in this crisis of her work! Would Zora make\r\none or would this blow send her to perdition? Not if Sarah Smith could\r\nsave her, she resolved, and stared out the window where the pale red\r\ndawn was sending its first rays on the white-pillared mansion of the\r\nCresswells.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey saw the light on the columns, too, as she lay lazily in her\r\nsoft white bed. There was a certain delicious languor in the late\r\nlingering fall of Alabama that suited her perfectly. Then, too, she\r\nliked the house and its appointments; there was not, to be sure, all the\r\nluxury that she was used to in her New York mansion, but there was a\r\ncertain finish about it, an elegance and staid old-fashioned hospitality\r\nthat appealed to her tremendously. Mrs. Grey's heart warmed to the sight\r\nof Helen in her moments of spasmodic caring for the sick and afflicted\r\non the estate. No better guardian of her philanthropies could be found\r\nthan these same Cresswells. She must, of course, go over and see dear\r\nSarah Smith; but really there was not much to say or to look at.\r\n\r\nThe prospects seemed most alluring. Later, Mr. Easterly talked a while\r\non routine business, saying, as he turned away:\r\n\r\n\"I am more and more impressed, Mrs. Grey, with your wisdom in placing\r\nlarge investments in the South. With peaceful social conditions the\r\nreturns will be large.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey heard this delicate flattery complacently. She had her streak\r\nof thrift, and wanted her business capacity recognized. She listened\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\"For this reason, I trust you will handle your Negro philanthropies\r\njudicially, as I know you will. There's dynamite in this race problem\r\nfor amateur reformers, but fortunately you have at hand wise and\r\nsympathetic advisers in the Cresswells.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey agreed entirely.\r\n\r\nMary Taylor, alone of the committee, took her commission so seriously as\r\nto be anxious to begin work.\r\n\r\n\"We are to visit the school this morning, you know,\" she reminded the\r\nothers, looking at her watch; \"I'm afraid we're late already.\"\r\n\r\nThe remark created mild consternation. It seemed that Mr. Vanderpool had\r\ngone hunting and his wife had not yet arisen. Dr. Boldish was very\r\nhoarse, Mr. Easterly was going to look over some plantations with\r\nColonel Cresswell, and Mr. Bocombe was engrossed in a novel.\r\n\r\n\"Clever, but not true to life,\" he said.\r\n\r\nFinally the clergyman and Mr. Bocombe, Mrs. Grey and Mrs. Vanderpool and\r\nMiss Taylor started for the school, with Harry Cresswell, about an hour\r\nafter lunch. The delay and suppressed excitement among the little folks\r\nhad upset things considerably there, but at the sight of the visitors at\r\nthe gate Miss Smith rang the bell.\r\n\r\nThe party came in, laughing and chatting. They greeted Miss Smith\r\ncordially. Dr. Boldish was beginning to tell a good story when a silence\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nThe children had gathered, quietly, almost timidly, and before the\r\ndistinguished company realized it, they turned to meet that battery of\r\nfour hundred eyes. A human eye is a wonderful thing when it simply waits\r\nand watches. Not one of these little things alone would have been worth\r\nmore than a glance, but together, they became mighty, portentous. Mr.\r\nBocombe got out his note-book and wrote furiously therein. Dr. Boldish,\r\nnaturally the appointed spokesman, looked helplessly about and whispered\r\nto Mrs. Vanderpool:\r\n\r\n\"What on earth shall I talk about?\"\r\n\r\n\"The brotherhood of man?\" suggested the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Hardly advisable,\" returned Dr. Boldish, seriously, \"in our friend's\r\npresence,\"--with a glance toward Cresswell. Then he arose.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" he said, touching his finger-tips and using blank verse in\r\nA minor. \"This is an auspicious day. You should be thankful for the\r\ngifts of the Lord. His bounty surrounds you--the trees, the fields, the\r\nglorious sun. He gives cotton to clothe you, corn to eat, devoted\r\nfriends to teach you. Be joyful. Be good. Above all, be thrifty and save\r\nyour money, and do not complain and whine at your apparent\r\ndisadvantages. Remember that God did not create men equal but unequal,\r\nand set metes and bounds. It is not for us to question the wisdom of the\r\nAlmighty, but to bow humbly to His will.\r\n\r\n\"Remember that the slavery of your people was not necessarily a crime.\r\nIt was a school of work and love. It gave you noble friends, like Mr.\r\nCresswell here.\" A restless stirring, and the battery of eyes was turned\r\nupon that imperturbable gentleman, as if he were some strange animal.\r\n\"Love and serve them. Remember that we get, after all, little education\r\nfrom books; rather in the fields, at the plough and in the kitchen. Let\r\nyour ambition be to serve rather than rule, to be humble followers of\r\nthe lowly Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nWith an upward glance the Rev. Dr. Boldish sat down amid a silence a\r\nshade more intense than that which had greeted him. Then slowly from the\r\nfar corner rose a thin voice, tremulously. It wavered on the air and\r\nalmost broke, then swelled in sweet, low music. Other and stronger\r\nvoices gathered themselves to it, until two hundred were singing a soft\r\nminor wail that gripped the hearts and tingled in the ears of the\r\nhearers. Mr. Bocombe groped with a puzzled expression to find the pocket\r\nfor his note-book; Harry Cresswell dropped his eyes, and on Mrs.\r\nVanderpool's lips the smile died. Mary Taylor flushed, and Mrs. Grey\r\ncried frankly:\r\n\r\n\"Poor things!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Mrs. Grey, turning about, \"we haven't but just a moment and\r\nwe want to take a little look at your work.\" She smiled graciously upon\r\nMiss Smith.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey thought the cooking-school very nice.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" she said, \"that you furnish cooks for the county.\"\r\n\r\n\"Largely,\" said Miss Smith. Mrs. Vanderpool looked surprised, but Miss\r\nSmith added: \"This county, you know, is mostly black.\" Mrs. Grey did not\r\ncatch the point.\r\n\r\nThe dormitories were neat and the ladies expressed great pleasure in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly nice for them to know what a clean place is,\" commented\r\nMrs. Grey. Mr. Cresswell, however, looked at a bath-room and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"How practical!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Can you not stop and see some of the classes?\" Sarah Smith knew in her\r\nheart that the visit was a failure, still she would do her part to the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if we shall have time,\" Mrs. Grey returned, as they walked on.\r\n\"Mr. Cresswell expects friends to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a magnificent intelligence office,\" remarked Mr. Bocombe, \"for\r\nfurnishing servants to the nation. I saw splendid material for cooks and\r\nmaids.\"\r\n\r\n\"And plough-boys,\" added Cresswell.\r\n\r\n\"And singers,\" said Mary Taylor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now that's just my idea,\" said Mrs. Grey, \"that these schools\r\nshould furnish trained servants and laborers for the South. Isn't that\r\nyour idea, Miss Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" the lady replied, \"or at least I shouldn't put it just\r\nthat way. My idea is that this school should furnish men and women who\r\ncan work and earn an honest living, train up families aright, and\r\nperform their duties as fathers, mothers, and citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes, precisely,\" said Mrs. Grey, \"that's what I meant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the whites can attend to the duties of citizenship without\r\nhelp,\" observed Mr. Cresswell.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let the blacks meddle in politics,\" said Dr. Boldish.\r\n\r\n\"I want to make these children full-fledged men and women, strong,\r\nself-reliant, honest, without any 'ifs' and 'ands' to their\r\ndevelopment,\" insisted Miss Smith.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, and that is just what Mr. Cresswell wants. Isn't it, Mr.\r\nCresswell?\" asked Mrs. Grey.\r\n\r\n\"I think I may say yes,\" Mr. Cresswell agreed. \"I certainly want these\r\npeople to develop as far as they can, although Miss Smith and I would\r\ndiffer as to their possibilities. But it is not so much in the general\r\ntheory of Negro education as in its particular applications where our\r\nchief differences would lie. I may agree that a boy should learn higher\r\narithmetic, yet object to his loafing in plough-time. I might want to\r\neducate some girls but not girls like Zora.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool glanced at Mr. Cresswell, smiling to herself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey broke in, beaming:\r\n\r\n\"That's just it, dear Miss Smith,--just it. Your heart is good, but you\r\nneed strong practical advice. You know we weak women are so impractical,\r\nas my poor Job so often said. Now, I'm going to arrange to endow this\r\nschool with at least--at least a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. One\r\ncondition is that my friend, Mr. Cresswell here, and these other\r\ngentlemen, including sound Northern business men like Mr. Easterly,\r\nshall hold this money in trust, and expend it for your school as they\r\nthink best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cresswell would be their local representative?\" asked Miss Smith\r\nslowly with white face.\r\n\r\n\"Why yes--yes, of course.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long, tense silence. Then the firm reply,\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Grey, I thank you, but I cannot accept your offer.\"\r\n\r\nSarah Smith's voice was strong, the tremor had left her hands. She had\r\nexpected something like this, of course; yet when it came--somehow it\r\nfailed to stun. She would not turn over the direction of the school, or\r\nthe direction of the education of these people, to those who were most\r\nopposed to their education. Therefore, there was no need to hesitate;\r\nthere was no need to think the thing over--she had thought it over--and\r\nshe looked into Mrs. Grey's eyes and with gathering tears in her own\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Again, I thank you very much, Mrs. Grey.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey was a picture of the most emphatic surprise, and Mr. Cresswell\r\nmoved to the window. Mrs. Grey looked helplessly at her companions.\r\n\r\n\"But--I don't understand, Miss Smith--why can't you accept my offer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you ask me to put my school in control of those who do not wish\r\nfor the best interests of black folk, and in particular I object to Mr.\r\nCresswell,\" said Miss Smith, slowly but very distinctly, \"because his\r\nrelation to the forces of evil in this community has been such that he\r\ncan direct no school of mine.\" Mrs. Vanderpool moved toward the door and\r\nMr. Cresswell bowing slightly followed. Dr. Boldish looked indignant and\r\nMr. Bocombe dove after his note-book. Mary Taylor, her head in a whirl,\r\ncame forward. She felt that in some way she was responsible for this\r\ndreadful situation and she wanted desperately to save matters from final\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" she said, \"Mrs. Grey, we'll talk this matter over again later. I\r\nam sure Miss Smith does not mean quite all she says--she is tired and\r\nnervous. You join the others and don't wait for me and I will be along\r\ndirectly.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Grey was only too glad to escape and Mr. Bocombe got a chance to\r\ntalk. He drew out his note-book.\r\n\r\n\"Awfully interesting,\" he said, \"awfully. Now--er--let's see--oh, yes.\r\nDid you notice how unhealthy the children looked? Race is undoubtedly\r\ndying out; fact. No hope. Weak. No spontaneity either--rather languid,\r\ndid you notice? Yes, and their heads--small and narrow--no brain\r\ncapacity. They can't concentrate; notice how some slept when Dr. Boldish\r\nwas speaking? Mr. Cresswell says they own almost no land here; think of\r\nit? This land was worth only ten dollars an acre a decade ago, he says.\r\nNegroes might have bought all and been rich. Very shiftless--and that\r\nsinging. Now, I wonder where they got the music? Imitation, of course.\"\r\nAnd so he rattled on, noting not the silence of the others.\r\n\r\nAs the carriage drove off Mary turned to Miss Smith.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Smith,\" she began--but Miss Smith looked at her, and said\r\nsternly, \"Sit down.\"\r\n\r\nMary Taylor sat down. She had been so used to lecturing the older woman\r\nthat the sudden summoning of her well known sternness against herself\r\ntook her breath, and she sat awkwardly like the school girl that she was\r\nwaiting for Miss Smith to speak. She felt suddenly very young and very\r\nhelpless--she who had so jauntily set out to solve this mighty problem\r\nby a waving of her wand. She saw with a swelling of pity the drawn and\r\nstricken face of her old friend and she started up.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" repeated Miss Smith harshly. \"Mary Taylor, you are a fool.\r\nYou are not foolish, for the foolish learn; you are simply a fool. You\r\nwill never learn; you have blundered into this life work of mine and\r\nwell nigh ruined it. Whether I can yet save it God alone knows. You have\r\nblundered into the lives of two loving children, and sent one wandering\r\naimless on the face of the earth and the other moaning in yonder chamber\r\nwith death in her heart. You are going to marry the man that sought\r\nZora's ruin when she was yet a child because you think of his\r\naristocratic pose and pretensions built on the poverty, crime, and\r\nexploitation of six generations of serfs. You'll marry him and--\"\r\n\r\nBut Miss Taylor leapt to her feet with blazing cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you?\" she screamed, beside herself.\r\n\r\n\"But God in heaven help you if you do,\" finished Miss Smith, calmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seventeen_\r\n\r\nTHE RAPE OF THE FLEECE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen slowly from the torpor of ether, one wakens to the misty sense of\r\neternal loss, and there comes the exquisite prick of pain, then one\r\nfeels in part the horror of the ache when Zora wakened to the world\r\nagain. The awakening was the work of days and weeks. At first in sheer\r\nexhaustion, physical and mental, she lay and moaned. The sense of\r\nloss--of utter loss--lay heavy upon her. Something of herself, something\r\ndearer than self, was gone from her forever, and an infinite loneliness\r\nand silence, as of endless years, settled on her soul. She wished\r\nneither food nor words, only to be alone. Then gradually the pain of\r\ninjury stung her when the blood flowed fuller. As Miss Smith knelt\r\nbeside her one night to make her simple prayer Zora sat suddenly\r\nupright, white-swathed, dishevelled, with fury in her midnight eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I want no prayers!\" she cried, \"I will not pray! He is no God of mine.\r\nHe isn't fair. He knows and won't tell. He takes advantage of us--He\r\nworks and fools us.\" All night Miss Smith heard mutterings of this\r\nbitterness, and the next day the girl walked her room like a\r\ntigress,--to and fro, to and fro, all the long day. Toward night a dumb\r\ndespair settled upon her. Miss Smith found her sitting by the window\r\ngazing blankly toward the swamp. She came to Miss Smith, slowly, and put\r\nher hands upon her shoulders with almost a caress.\r\n\r\n\"You must forgive me,\" she pleaded plaintively. \"I reckon I've been\r\nmighty bad with you, and you always so good to me; but--but, you see--it\r\nhurts so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it hurts, dear; I know it does. But men and women must learn to\r\nbear hurts in this world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not hurts like this; they couldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, even hurts like this. Bear and stand straight; be brave. After\r\nall, Zora, no man is quite worth a woman's soul; no love is worth a\r\nwhole life.\"\r\n\r\nZora turned away with a gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n\"You were born in ice,\" she retorted, adding a bit more tenderly, \"in\r\nclear strong ice; but I was born in fire. I live--I love; that's all.\"\r\nAnd she sat down again, despairingly, and stared at the dull swamp. Miss\r\nSmith stood for a moment and closed her eyes upon a vision.\r\n\r\n\"Ice!\" she whispered. \"My God!\"\r\n\r\nThen, at length, she said to Zora:\r\n\r\n\"Zora, there's only one way: do something; if you sit thus brooding\r\nyou'll go crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do crazy folks forget?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Zora!\" Miss Smith ridiculed the girl's fantastic vagaries;\r\nher sound common sense rallied to her aid. \"They are the people who\r\nremember; sane folk forget. Work is the only cure for such pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's nothing to do--nothing I want to do--nothing worth\r\ndoing--now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Silver Fleece?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl sat upright.\r\n\r\n\"The Silver Fleece,\" she murmured. Without further word, slowly she\r\narose and walked down the stairs, and out into the swamp. Miss Smith\r\nwatched her go; she knew that every step must be the keen prickle of\r\nawakening flesh. Yet the girl walked steadily on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was the Christmas--not Christmas-tide of the North and West, but\r\nChristmas of the Southern South. It was not the festival of the Christ\r\nChild, but a time of noise and frolic and license, the great Pay-Day of\r\nthe year when black men lifted their heads from a year's toiling in the\r\nearth, and, hat in hand, asked anxiously: \"Master, what have I earned?\r\nHave I paid my old debts to you? Have I made my clothes and food? Have I\r\ngot a little of the year's wage coming to me?\" Or, more carelessly and\r\ncringingly: \"Master, gimme a Christmas gift.\"\r\n\r\nThe lords of the soil stood round, gauging their cotton, measuring their\r\nmen. Their stores were crowded, their scales groaned, their gins sang.\r\nIn the long run public opinion determines all wage, but in more\r\nprimitive times and places, private opinion, personal judgment of some\r\nman in power, determines. The Black Belt is primitive and the landlord\r\nwields the power.\r\n\r\n\"What about Johnson?\" calls the head clerk.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he's a faithful nigger and needs encouragement; cancel his debt\r\nand give him ten dollars for Christmas.\" Colonel Cresswell glowed, as if\r\nhe were full of the season's spirit.\r\n\r\n\"And Sanders?\"\r\n\r\n\"How's his cotton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, and a lot of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's trying to get away. Keep him in debt, but let him draw what he\r\nwants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Rachel?\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm, they're way behind, aren't they? Give her a couple of dollars--not\r\na cent more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jim Sykes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, Harry, how about that darky, Sykes?\" called out the Colonel.\r\n\r\nExcusing himself from his guests, Harry Cresswell came into the office.\r\n\r\nTo them this peculiar spectacle of the market place was of unusual\r\ninterest. They saw its humor and its crowding, its bizarre effects and\r\nunwonted pageantry. Black giants and pigmies were there; kerchiefed\r\naunties, giggling black girls, saffron beauties, and loafing white men.\r\nThere were mules and horses and oxen, wagons and buggies and carts; but\r\nabove all and in all, rushing through, piled and flying, bound and\r\nbaled--was cotton. Cotton was currency; cotton was merchandise; cotton\r\nwas conversation.\r\n\r\nAll this was \"beautiful\" to Mrs. Grey and \"unusually interesting\" to\r\nMrs. Vanderpool. To Mary Taylor it had the fascination of a puzzle whose\r\nother side she had already been partially studying. She was particularly\r\nimpressed with the joy and abandon of the scene--light laughter, huge\r\nguffaws, handshakes, and gossipings.\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" she concluded, \"this is no oppressed people.\" And\r\nsauntering away from the rest she noted the smiles of an undersized\r\nsmirking yellow man who hurried by with a handful of dollar bills. At a\r\nside entrance liquor was evidently on sale--men were drinking and women,\r\ntoo; some were staggering, others cursing, and yet others singing. Then\r\nsuddenly a man swung around the corner swearing in bitter rage:\r\n\r\n\"The damned thieves, they'se stole a year's work--the white--\" But some\r\none called, \"Hush up, Sanders! There's a white woman.\" And he threw a\r\nstartled look at Mary and hurried by. She was perplexed and upset and\r\nstood hesitating a moment when she heard a well-known voice:\r\n\r\n\"Why, Miss Taylor, I was alarmed for you; you really must be careful\r\nabout trusting yourself with these half drunken Negroes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be better not to give them drink, Mr. Cresswell?\"\r\n\r\n\"And let your neighbor sell them poison at all hours? No, Miss Taylor.\"\r\nThey joined the others, and all were turning toward the carriage when a\r\nfigure coming down the road attracted them.\r\n\r\n\"Quite picturesque,\" observed Mrs. Vanderpool, looking at the tall, slim\r\ngirl swaying toward them with a piled basket of white cotton poised\r\nlightly on her head. \"Why,\" in abrupt recognition, \"it is our Venus of\r\nthe Roadside, is it not?\"\r\n\r\nMary saw it was Zora. Just then, too, Zora caught sight of them, and for\r\na moment hesitated, then came on; the carriage was in front of the\r\nstore, and she was bound for the store. A moment Mary hesitated, too,\r\nand then turned resolutely to greet her. But Zora's eyes did not see\r\nher. After one look at that sorrow-stricken face, Mary turned away.\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell stood by the door, his hat on, his hands in his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Zora, what have you there?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Cotton, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHarry Cresswell bent over it.\r\n\r\n\"Great heavens! Look at this cotton!\" he ejaculated. His father\r\napproached. The cotton lay in silken handfuls, clean and shimmering,\r\nwith threads full two inches long. The idlers, black and white,\r\nclustered round, gazing at it, and fingering it with repeated\r\nexclamations of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Where did this come from?\" asked the Colonel sharply. He and Harry were\r\nboth eying the girl intently.\r\n\r\n\"I raised it in the swamp,\" Zora replied quietly, in a dead voice. There\r\nwas no pride of achievement in her manner, no gladness; all that had\r\nflown.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I think there's two bales.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two bales! Where is it? How the devil--\" The Colonel was forgetting his\r\nguests, but Harry intervened.\r\n\r\n\"You'll need to get it picked right off,\" he suggested.\r\n\r\n\"It's all picked, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll send a wagon, sir--\"\r\n\r\nBut the Colonel hardly waited.\r\n\r\n\"Here you, Jim, take the big mules and drive like--Where's that wench?\"\r\n\r\nBut Zora was already striding on ahead, and was far up the red road when\r\nthe great mules galloped into sight and the long whip snapped above\r\ntheir backs. The Colonel was still excited.\r\n\r\n\"That cotton must be ours, Harry--all of it. And see that none is\r\nstolen. We've got no contract with the wench, so don't dally with her.\"\r\nBut Harry said firmly, quietly:\r\n\r\n\"It's fine cotton, and she raised it; she must be paid well for it.\"\r\nColonel Cresswell glanced at him with something between contempt and\r\nastonishment on his face.\r\n\r\n\"You go along with the ladies,\" Harry added; \"I'll see to this cotton.\"\r\nMary Taylor's smile had rewarded him; now he must get rid of his\r\ncompany--before Zora returned.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when the cotton came; such a load as Cresswell's store had\r\nnever seen before. Zora watched it weighed, received the cotton checks,\r\nand entered the store. Only the clerk was there, and he was closing. He\r\npointed her carelessly to the office in the back part. She went into the\r\nsmall dim room, and laying the cotton-check on the desk, stood waiting.\r\nSlowly the hopelessness and bitterness of it all came back in a great\r\nwhelming flood. What was the use of trying for anything? She was lost\r\nforever. The world was against her, and again she saw the fingers of\r\nElspeth--the long black claw-like talons that clutched and dragged her\r\ndown--down. She did not struggle--she dropped her hands listlessly,\r\nwearily, and stood but half conscious as the door opened and Mr. Harry\r\nCresswell entered the dimly lighted room. She opened her eyes. She had\r\nexpected his father. Somewhere way down in the depths of her nature the\r\nprimal tiger awoke and snarled. She was suddenly alive from hair to\r\nfinger tip. Harry Cresswell paused a second and swept her full length\r\nwith his eye--her profile, the long supple line of bosom and hip, the\r\nlittle foot. Then he closed the door softly and walked slowly toward\r\nher. She stood like stone, without a quiver; only her eye followed the\r\ncrooked line of the Cresswell blue blood on his marble forehead as she\r\nlooked down from her greater height; her hand closed almost caressingly\r\non a rusty poker lying on the stove nearby; and as she sensed the hot\r\nbreath of him she felt herself purring in a half heard whisper.\r\n\r\n\"I should not like--to kill you.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her long and steadily as he passed to his desk. Slowly he\r\nlighted a cigarette, opened the great ledger, and compared the\r\ncotton-check with it.\r\n\r\n\"Three thousand pounds,\" he announced in a careless tone. \"Yes, that\r\nwill make about two bales of lint. It's extra cotton--say fifteen cents\r\na pound--one hundred fifty dollars--seventy-five dollars to you--h'm.\"\r\nHe took a note-book out of his pocket, pushed his hat back on his head,\r\nand paused to relight his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see--your rent and rations--\"\r\n\r\n\"Elspeth pays no rent,\" she said slowly, but he did not seem to hear.\r\n\r\n\"Your rent and rations with the five years' back debt,\"--he made a hasty\r\ncalculation--\"will be one hundred dollars. That leaves you twenty-five\r\nin our debt. Here's your receipt.\"\r\n\r\nThe blow had fallen. She did not wince nor cry out. She took the\r\nreceipt, calmly, and walked out into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThey had stolen the Silver Fleece.\r\n\r\nWhat should she do? She never thought of appeal to courts, for Colonel\r\nCresswell was Justice of the Peace and his son was bailiff. Why had they\r\nstolen from her? She knew. She was now penniless, and in a sense\r\nhelpless. She was now a peon bound to a master's bidding. If Elspeth\r\nchose to sign a contract of work for her to-morrow, it would mean\r\nslavery, jail, or hounded running away. What would Elspeth do? One never\r\nknew. Zora walked on. An hour ago it seemed that this last blow must\r\nhave killed her. But now it was different. Into her first despair had\r\ncrept, in one fierce moment, grim determination. Somewhere in the world\r\nsat a great dim Injustice which had veiled the light before her young\r\neyes, just as she raised them to the morning. With the veiling, death\r\nhad come into her heart.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, they should not kill her; they should not enslave her. A\r\ndesperate resolve to find some way up toward the light, if not to it,\r\nformed itself within her. She would not fall into the pit opening before\r\nher. Somehow, somewhere lay The Way. She must never fall lower; never be\r\nutterly despicable in the eyes of the man she had loved. There was no\r\ndream of forgiveness, of purification, of re-kindled love; all these she\r\nplaced sadly and gently into the dead past. But in awful earnestness,\r\nshe turned toward the future; struggling blindly, groping in half formed\r\nplans for a way.\r\n\r\nShe came thus into the room where sat Miss Smith, strangely pallid\r\nbeneath her dusky skin. But there lay a light in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eighteen_\r\n\r\nTHE COTTON CORNER\r\n\r\n\r\nAll over the land the cotton had foamed in great white flakes under the\r\nwinter sun. The Silver Fleece lay like a mighty mantle across the earth.\r\nBlack men and mules had staggered beneath its burden, while deep songs\r\nwelled in the hearts of men; for the Fleece was goodly and gleaming and\r\nsoft, and men dreamed of the gold it would buy. All the roads in the\r\ncountry had been lined with wagons--a million wagons speeding to and fro\r\nwith straining mules and laughing black men, bearing bubbling masses of\r\npiled white Fleece. The gins were still roaring and spitting flames and\r\nsmoke--fifty thousand of them in town and vale. Then hoarse iron throats\r\nwere filled with fifteen billion pounds of white-fleeced, black-specked\r\ncotton, for the whirling saws to tear out the seed and fling five\r\nthousand million pounds of the silken fibre to the press.\r\n\r\nAnd there again the black men sang, like dark earth-spirits flitting in\r\ntwilight; the presses creaked and groaned; closer and closer they\r\npressed the silken fleece. It quivered, trembled, and then lay cramped,\r\ndead, and still, in massive, hard, square bundles, tied with iron\r\nstrings. Out fell the heavy bales, thousand upon thousand, million upon\r\nmillion, until they settled over the South like some vast dull-white\r\nswarm of birds. Colonel Cresswell and his son, in these days, had a long\r\nand earnest conversation perforated here and there by explosions of the\r\nColonel's wrath. The Colonel could not understand some things.\r\n\r\n\"They want us to revive the Farmers' League?\" he fiercely demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Harry calmly replied.\r\n\r\n\"And throw the rest of our capital after the fifty thousand dollars\r\nwe've already lost?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were fool enough to consent--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, Father--and don't get excited. Listen. Cotton is going up--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's going up! Short crop and big demand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Cotton is going up, and then it's going to fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it; the trust has got money and credit enough to force it down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then?\" The Colonel glared.\r\n\r\n\"Then somebody will corner it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Farmers' League won't stand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. The Farmers' League can do the cornering and hold it for\r\nhigher prices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord, son! if we only could!\" groaned the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"We can; we'll have unlimited credit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but--\" stuttered the bewildered Colonel, \"I don't understand. Why\r\nshould the trust--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Father--what's the use of understanding. Our advantage is\r\nplain, and John Taylor guarantees the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's John Taylor?\" snorted the Colonel. \"Why should we trust him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Harry slowly, \"he wants to marry Helen--\"\r\n\r\nHis father grew apopletic.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not saying he will, Father; I'm only saying that he wants to,\"\r\nHarry made haste to placate the rising tide of wrath.\r\n\r\n\"No Southern gentleman--\" began the Colonel. But Harry shrugged his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Which is better, to be crushed by the trust or to escape at their\r\nexpense, even if that escape involves unwarranted assumptions on the\r\npart of one of them? I tell you, Father, the code of the Southern\r\ngentleman won't work in Wall Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll tell you why--there _are_ no Southern gentlemen,\" growled his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Fleece was golden, for its prices were flying aloft. Mr.\r\nCaldwell told Colonel Cresswell that he confidently expected twelve-cent\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\n\"The crop is excellent and small, scarcely ten million bales,\" he\r\ndeclared. \"The price is bound to go up.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell was hesitant, even doubtful; the demand for cotton at\r\nhigh prices usually fell off rapidly and he had heard rumors of\r\ncurtailed mill production. While, then, he hoped for high prices he\r\nadvised the Farmers' League to be on guard.\r\n\r\nMr. Caldwell seemed to be right, for cotton rose to ten cents a\r\npound--ten and a half--eleven--and then the South began to see visions\r\nand to dream dreams.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear,\" said Mr. Maxwell, whose lands lay next to the\r\nCresswells' on the northwest, \"yes, if cotton goes to twelve or thirteen\r\ncents as seems probable, I think we can begin the New House\"--for Mrs.\r\nMaxwell's cherished dream was a pillared mansion like the Cresswells'.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolliver looked at his house and barns. \"Well, daughter, if this\r\ncrop sells at twelve cents, I'll be on my feet again, and I won't have\r\nto sell that land to the nigger school after all. Once out of the\r\nclutch of the Cresswells--well, I think we can have a coat of paint.\"\r\nAnd he laughed as he had not laughed in ten years.\r\n\r\nDown in the bottoms west of the swamp a man and woman were figuring\r\npainfully on an old slate. He was light brown and she was yellow.\r\n\r\n\"Honey,\" he said tremblingly, \"I b'lieve we can do it--if cotton goes to\r\ntwelve cents, we can pay the mortgage.\"\r\n\r\nTwo miles north of the school an old black woman was shouting and waving\r\nher arms. \"If cotton goes to twelve cents we can pay out and be free!\"\r\nand she threw her apron over her head and wept, gathering her children\r\nin her arms.\r\n\r\nBut even as she cried a flash and tremor shook the South. Far away to\r\nthe north a great spider sat weaving his web. The office looked down\r\nfrom the clouds on lower Broadway, and was soft with velvet and leather.\r\nSwift, silent messengers hurried in and out, and Mr. Easterly, deciding\r\nthe time was ripe, called his henchman to him.\r\n\r\n\"Taylor, we're ready--go South.\"\r\n\r\nAnd John Taylor rose, shook hands silently, and went.\r\n\r\nAs he entered Cresswell's plantation store three days later, a colored\r\nwoman with a little boy turned sadly away from the counter.\r\n\r\n\"No, aunty,\" the clerk was telling her, \"calico is too high; can't let\r\nyou have any till we see how your cotton comes out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted a bit; I promised the boy--\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, go on--Why, Mr. Taylor!\" And the little boy burst into tears\r\nwhile he was hurried out.\r\n\r\n\"Tightening up on the tenants?\" asked Taylor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; these niggers are mighty extravagant. Besides, cotton fell a\r\nlittle today--eleven to ten and three-fourths; just a flurry, I reckon.\r\nHad you heard?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor said he had heard, and he hurried on. Next morning the long\r\nshining wires of that great Broadway web trembled and flashed again and\r\ncotton went to ten cents.\r\n\r\n\"No house this year, I fear,\" quoth Mr. Maxwell, bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe next day nine and a half was the quotation, and men began to look at\r\neach other and asked questions.\r\n\r\n\"Paper says the crop is larger than the government estimate,\" said\r\nTolliver, and added, \"There'll be no painting this year.\" He looked\r\ntoward the Smith School and thought of the five thousand dollars\r\nwaiting; but he hesitated. John Taylor had carefully mentioned seven\r\nthousand dollars as a price he was willing to pay and \"perhaps more.\"\r\nWas Cresswell back of Taylor? Tolliver was suspicious and moved to delay\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\"It's manipulation and speculation in New York,\" said Colonel Cresswell,\r\n\"and the Farmers' League must begin operations.\"\r\n\r\nThe local paper soon had an editorial on \"our distinguished fellow\r\ncitizen, Colonel Cresswell,\" and his efforts to revive the Farmers'\r\nLeague. It was understood that Colonel Cresswell was risking his whole\r\nprivate fortune to hold the price of cotton, and some effort seemed to\r\nbe needed, for cotton dropped to nine cents within a week. Swift\r\nnegotiations ensued, and a meeting of the executive committee of the\r\nFarmers' League was held in Montgomery. A system of warehouses and\r\nwarehouse certificates was proposed.\r\n\r\n\"But that will cost money,\" responded each of the dozen big landlords\r\nwho composed the committee; whereupon Harry Cresswell introduced John\r\nTaylor, who represented thirty millions of Southern bank stock.\r\n\r\n\"I promise you credit to any reasonable amount,\" said Mr. Taylor, \"I\r\nbelieve in cotton--the present price is abnormal.\" And Mr. Taylor knew\r\nwhereof he spoke, for when he sent a cipher despatch North, cotton\r\ndropped to eight and a half. The Farmers' League leased three warehouses\r\nat Savannah, Montgomery, and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThen silently the South gripped itself and prepared for battle. Men\r\nstopped spending, business grew dull, and millions of eyes were glued\r\nto the blackboards of the cotton-exchange. Tighter and tighter the\r\nreins grew on the backs of the black tenants.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith, is yo' got just a drap of coffee to lend me? Mr. Cresswell\r\nwon't give me none at the store and I'se just starving for some,\" said\r\nAunt Rachel from over the hill. \"We won't git free this year, Miss\r\nSmith, not this year,\" she concluded plaintively.\r\n\r\nCotton fell to seven and a half cents and the muttered protest became\r\nangry denunciation. Why was it? Who was doing it?\r\n\r\nHarry Cresswell went to Montgomery. He was getting nervous. The thing\r\nwas too vast. He could not grasp it. It set his head in a whirl. Harry\r\nCresswell was not a bad man--are there any bad men? He was a man who\r\nfrom the day he first wheedled his black mammy into submission, down to\r\nhis thirty-sixth year, had seldom known what it was voluntarily to deny\r\nhimself or curb a desire. To rise when he would, eat what he craved, and\r\ndo what the passing fancy suggested had long been his day's programme.\r\nSuch emptiness of life and aim had to be filled, and it was filled; he\r\nhelped his father sometimes with the plantations, but he helped\r\nspasmodically and played at work.\r\n\r\nThe unregulated fire of energy and delicacy of nervous poise within him\r\ncontinually hounded him to the verge of excess and sometimes beyond.\r\nCool, quiet, and gentlemanly as he was by rule of his clan, the ice was\r\nthin and underneath raged unappeased fires. He craved the madness of\r\nalcohol in his veins till his delicate hands trembled of mornings. The\r\nwomen whom he bent above in languid, veiled-eyed homage, feared lest\r\nthey love him, and what work was to others gambling was to him.\r\n\r\nThe Cotton Combine, then, appealed to him overpoweringly--to his passion\r\nfor wealth, to his passion for gambling. But once entered upon the game\r\nit drove him to fear and frenzy: first, it was a long game and Harry\r\nCresswell was not trained to waiting, and, secondly, it was a game whose\r\nintricacies he did not know. In vain did he try to study the matter\r\nthrough. He ordered books from the North, he subscribed for financial\r\njournals, he received special telegraphic reports only to toss them\r\naway, curse his valet, and call for another brandy. After all, he kept\r\nsaying to himself, what guarantee, what knowledge had he that this was\r\nnot a \"damned Yankee trick\"?\r\n\r\nNow that the web was weaving its last mesh in early January he haunted\r\nMontgomery, and on this day when it seemed that things must culminate or\r\nhe would go mad, he hastened again down to the Planters' Hotel and was\r\nquickly ushered to John Taylor's room. The place was filled with tobacco\r\nsmoke. An electric ticker was drumming away in one corner, a telephone\r\nringing on the desk, and messenger boys hovered outside the door and\r\nraced to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" asked Cresswell, maintaining his composure by an effort, \"how\r\nare things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Great!\" returned Taylor. \"League holds three million bales and controls\r\nfive. It's the biggest corner in years.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how's cotton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ticker says six and three-fourths.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell sat down abruptly opposite Taylor, looking at him fixedly.\r\n\r\n\"That last drop means liabilities of a hundred thousand to us,\" he said\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" Taylor blandly admitted.\r\n\r\nBeads of sweat gathered on Cresswell's forehead. He looked at the\r\nscrawny iron man opposite, who had already forgotten his presence. He\r\nordered whiskey, and taking paper and pencil began to figure, drinking\r\nas he figured. Slowly the blood crept out of his white face leaving it\r\nwhiter, and went surging and pounding in his heart. Poverty--that was\r\nwhat those figures spelled. Poverty--unclothed, wineless poverty, to dig\r\nand toil like a \"nigger\" from morning until night, and to give up horses\r\nand carriages and women; that was what they spelled.\r\n\r\n\"How much--farther will it drop?\" he asked harshly.\r\n\r\nTaylor did not look up.\r\n\r\n\"Can't tell,\" he said, \"'fraid not much though.\" He glanced through a\r\ntelegram. \"No--damn it!--outside mills are low; they'll stampede soon.\r\nMeantime we'll buy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Taylor--\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are one hundred thousand offered at six and three-fourths.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, Taylor--\" Cresswell half arose.\r\n\r\n\"Done!\" cried Taylor. \"Six and one-half,\" clicked the machine.\r\n\r\nCresswell arose from his chair by the window and came slowly to the wide\r\nflat desk where Taylor was working feverishly. He sat down heavily in\r\nthe chair opposite and tried quietly to regain his self-control. The\r\nliabilities of the Cresswells already amounted to half the value of\r\ntheir property, at a fair market valuation. The cotton for which they\r\nhad made debts was still falling in value. Every fourth of a cent fall\r\nmeant--he figured it again tremblingly--meant one hundred thousand more\r\nof liabilities. If cotton fell to six he hadn't a cent on earth. If it\r\nstayed there--\"My God!\" He felt a faintness stealing over him but he\r\nbeat it back and gulped down another glass of fiery liquor.\r\n\r\nThen the one protecting instinct of his clan gripped him. Slowly,\r\nquietly his hand moved back until it grasped the hilt of the big Colt's\r\nrevolver that was ever with him--his thin white hand became suddenly\r\nsteady as it slipped the weapon beneath the shadow of the desk.\r\n\r\n\"If it goes to six,\" he kept murmuring, \"we're ruined--if it goes to\r\nsix--if--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tick,\" sounded the wheel and the sound reverberated like sudden thunder\r\nin his ears. His hand was iron, and he raised it slightly. \"Six,\" said\r\nthe wheel--his finger quivered--\"and a half.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell!\" yelled Taylor. \"She's turned--there'll be the devil to pay now.\"\r\nA messenger burst in and Taylor scowled.\r\n\r\n\"She's loose in New York--a regular mob in New Orleans--and--hark!--By\r\nGod! there's something doing here. Damn it--I wish we'd got another\r\nmillion bales. Let's see, we've got--\" He figured while the wheel\r\nwhirred--\"7--7-1/2--8--8-1/2.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell listened, staggered to his feet, his face crimson and his hair\r\nwild.\r\n\r\n\"My God, Taylor,\" he gasped. \"I'm--I'm a half a million ahead--great\r\nheavens!\"\r\n\r\nThe ticker whirred, \"8-3/4--9--9-1/2--10.\" Then it stopped dead.\r\n\r\n\"Exchange closed,\" said Taylor. \"We've cornered the market all\r\nright--cornered it--d'ye hear, Cresswell? We got over half the crop and\r\nwe can send prices to the North Star--you--why, I figure it you\r\nCresswells are worth at least seven hundred and fifty thousand above\r\nliabilities this minute,\" and John Taylor leaned back and lighted a big\r\nblack cigar.\r\n\r\n\"I've made a million or so myself,\" he added reflectively.\r\n\r\nCresswell leaned back in his chair, his face had gone white again, and\r\nhe spoke slowly to still the tremor in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I've gambled--before; I've gambled on cards and on horses; I've\r\ngambled--for money--and--women--but--\"\r\n\r\n\"But not on cotton, hey? Well, I don't know about cards and such; but\r\nthey can't beat cotton.\"\r\n\r\n\"And say, John Taylor, you're my friend.\" Cresswell stretched his hand\r\nacross the desk, and as he bent forward the pistol crashed to the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nineteen_\r\n\r\nTHE DYING OF ELSPETH\r\n\r\n\r\nRich! This was the thought that awakened Harry Cresswell to a sense of\r\nendless well-being. Rich! No longer the mirage and semblance of wealth,\r\nthe memory of opulence, the shadow of homage without the substance of\r\npower--no; now the wealth was real, cold hard dollars, and in piles. How\r\nmuch? He laughed aloud as he turned on his pillow. What did he care?\r\nEnough--enough. Not less than half a million; perhaps three-quarters of\r\na million; perhaps--was not cotton still rising?--a whole round million!\r\nThat would mean from twenty-five to fifty thousand a year. Great\r\nheavens! and he'd been starving on a bare couple of thousand and trying\r\nto keep up appearances! today the Cresswells were almost millionaires;\r\naye, and he might be married to more millions.\r\n\r\nHe sat up with a start. Today Mary was going North. He had quite\r\nforgotten it in the wild excitement of the cotton corner. He had\r\nneglected her. Of course, there was always the hovering doubt as to\r\nwhether he really wanted her or not. She had the form and carriage; her\r\nbeauty, while not startling, was young and fresh and firm. On the other\r\nhand there was about her a certain independence that he did not like to\r\nassociate with women. She had thoughts and notions of the world which\r\nwere, to his Southern training, hardly feminine. And yet even they\r\npiqued him and spurred him like the sight of an untrained colt. He had\r\nnot seen her falter yet beneath his glances or tremble at his touch. All\r\nthis he desired--ardently desired. But did he desire her as a wife? He\r\nrather thought that he did. And if so he must speak today.\r\n\r\nThere was his father, too, to reckon with. Colonel Cresswell, with the\r\nperversity of the simple-minded, had taken the sudden bettering of their\r\nfortunes as his own doing. He had foreseen; he had stuck it out; his\r\ncredit had pulled the thing through; and the trust had learned a thing\r\nor two about Southern gentlemen.\r\n\r\nToward John Taylor he perceptibly warmed. His business methods were such\r\nas a Cresswell could never stoop to; but he was a man of his word, and\r\nColonel Cresswell's correspondence with Mr. Easterly opened his eyes to\r\nthe beneficent ideals of Northern capital. At the same time he could not\r\nconsider the Easterlys and the Taylors and such folk as the social\r\nequals of the Cresswells, and his prejudice on this score must still be\r\nreckoned with.\r\n\r\nBelow, Mary Taylor lingered on the porch in strange uncertainty. Harry\r\nCresswell would soon be coming downstairs. Did she want him to find her?\r\nShe liked him frankly, undisguisedly; but from the love she knew to be\r\nso near her heart she recoiled in perturbation. He wooed her--whether\r\nconsciously or not, she was always uncertain--with every quiet\r\nattention and subtle deference, with a devotion seemingly quite too\r\ndelicate for words; he not only fetched her flowers, but flowers that\r\nchimed with day and gown and season--almost with mood. He had a woman's\r\npremonitions in fulfilling her wishes. His hands, if they touched her,\r\nwere soft and tender, and yet he gave a curious impression of strength\r\nand poise and will.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in all things he was in her eyes a gentleman in the fine\r\nold-fashioned aristocracy of the term; her own heart voiced all he did\r\nnot say, and pleaded for him to her own confusion.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in her heart, lay the awful doubt--and the words kept ringing\r\nin her ears! \"You will marry this man--but heaven help you if you do!\"\r\n\r\nSo it was that on this day when she somehow felt he would speak, his\r\nfootsteps on the stairs filled her with sudden panic. Without a word she\r\nslipped behind the pillars and ran down among the oaks and sauntered out\r\nupon the big road. He caught the white flutter of her dress, and smiled\r\nindulgently as he watched and waited and lightly puffed his cigarette.\r\n\r\nThe morning was splendid with that first delicious languor of the spring\r\nwhich breathes over the Southland in February. Mary Taylor filled her\r\nlungs, lifted her arms aloft, and turning, stepped into the deep shadow\r\nof the swamp.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the air, the day, the scene about her subtly changed. She felt\r\na closeness and a tremor, a certain brooding terror in the languid\r\nsombre winds. The gold of the sunlight faded to a sickly green, and the\r\nearth was black and burned. A moment she paused and looked back; she\r\ncaught the man's silhouette against the tall white pillars of the\r\nmansion and she fled deeper into the forest with the hush of death about\r\nher, and the silence which is one great Voice. Slowly, and mysteriously\r\nit loomed before her--that squat and darksome cabin which seemed to\r\nfitly set in the centre of the wilderness, beside its crawling slime.\r\n\r\nShe paused in sudden certainty that there lay the answer to her doubts\r\nand mistrust. She felt impelled to go forward and ask--what? She did not\r\nknow, but something to still this war in her bosom. She had seldom seen\r\nElspeth; she had never been in her cabin. She had felt an inconquerable\r\naversion for the evil hag; she felt it now, and shivered in the warm\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nAs she came in full view of the door, she paused. On the step of the\r\ncabin, framed in the black doorway, stood Zora. Measured by the squat\r\ncabin she seemed in height colossal; slim, straight as a pine,\r\nmotionless, with one long outstretched arm pointing to where the path\r\nswept onward toward the town.\r\n\r\nIt was too far for words but the scene lay strangely clear and sharp-cut\r\nin the green mystery of the sunlight. Before that motionless, fateful\r\nfigure crouched a slighter, smaller woman, dishevelled, clutching her\r\nbreast; she bent and rose--hesitated--seemed to plead; then turning,\r\nclasped in passionate embrace the child whose head was hid in Zora's\r\ngown. Next instant she was staggering along the path whither Zora\r\npointed.\r\n\r\nSlowly the sun was darkened, and plaintive murmurings pulsed through the\r\nwood. The oppression and fear of the swamp redoubled in Mary Taylor.\r\n\r\nZora gave no sign of having seen her. She stood tall and still, and the\r\nlittle golden-haired girl still sobbed in her gown. Mary Taylor looked\r\nup into Zora's face, then paused in awe. It was a face she did not know;\r\nit was neither the beautifully mischievous face of the girl, nor the\r\npain-stricken face of the woman. It was a face cold and mask-like,\r\nregular and comely; clothed in a mighty calm, yet subtly, masterfully\r\nveiling behind itself depths of unfathomed misery and wild revolt. All\r\nthis lay in its darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, Miss Taylor.\"\r\n\r\nMary, who was wont to teach this woman--so lately a child--searched in\r\nvain for words to address her now. She stood bare-haired and hesitating\r\nin the pale green light of the darkened morning. It seemed fit that a\r\ndeep groan of pain should gather itself from the mysterious depths of\r\nthe swamp, and drop like a pall on the black portal of the cabin. But\r\nit brought Mary Taylor back to a sense of things, and under a sudden\r\nimpulse she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Is--is anything the matter?\" she asked nervously.\r\n\r\n\"Elspeth is sick,\" replied Zora.\r\n\r\n\"Is she very sick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--she has been called,\" solemnly returned the dark young woman.\r\n\r\nMary was puzzled. \"Called?\" she repeated vaguely.\r\n\r\n\"We heard the great cry in the night, and Elspeth says it is the End.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to Mary Taylor to question this mysticism; she all at\r\nonce understood--perhaps read the riddle in the dark, melancholy eyes\r\nthat so steadily regarded her.\r\n\r\n\"Then you can leave the place, Zora?\" she exclaimed gladly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I could leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the place looks--evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you will stay?\"\r\n\r\nZora's eyes were now fixed far above the woman's head, and she saw a\r\nhuman face forming itself in the vast rafters of the forest. Its eyes\r\nwere wet with pain and anger.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nThe child furtively uncovered her face and looked at the stranger. She\r\nwas blue-eyed and golden-haired.\r\n\r\n\"Whose child is this?\" queried Mary, curiously.\r\n\r\nZora looked coldly down upon the child.\r\n\r\n\"It is Bertie's. Her mother is bad. She is gone. I sent her. She and the\r\nothers like her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where have you sent them?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Hell!\"\r\n\r\nMary Taylor started under the shock. Impulsively she moved forward with\r\nhands that wanted to stretch themselves in appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Zora! Zora! _You_ mustn't go, too!\"\r\n\r\nBut the black girl drew proudly back.\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ there,\" she returned, with unmistakable simplicity of absolute\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nThe white woman shrank back. Her heart was wrung; she wanted to say\r\nmore--to explain, to ask to help; there came welling to her lips a flood\r\nof things that she would know. But Zora's face again was masked.\r\n\r\n\"I must go,\" she said, before Mary could speak. \"Good-bye.\" And the dark\r\ngroaning depths of the cabin swallowed her.\r\n\r\nWith a satisfied smile, Harry Cresswell had seen the Northern girl\r\ndisappear toward the swamp; for it is significant when maidens run from\r\nlovers. But maidens should also come back, and when, after the lapse of\r\nmany minutes, Mary did not reappear, he followed her footsteps to the\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\nHe frowned as he noted the footprints pointing to Elspeth's--what did\r\nMary Taylor want there? A fear started within him, and something else.\r\nHe was suddenly aware that he wanted this woman, intensely; at the\r\nmoment he would have turned Heaven and earth to get her. He strode\r\nforward and the wood rose darkly green above him. A long, low, distant\r\nmoan seemed to sound upon the breeze, and after it came Mary Taylor.\r\n\r\nHe met her with tender solicitude, and she was glad to feel his arm\r\nbeneath hers.\r\n\r\n\"I've been searching for you,\" he said after a silence. \"You should not\r\nwander here alone--it is dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, dangerous?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Wandering Negroes, and even wild beasts, in the forest depths--and\r\nmalaria--see, you tremble now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not from malaria,\" she slowly returned.\r\n\r\nHe caught an unfamiliar note in his voice, and a wild desire to justify\r\nhimself before this woman clamored in his heart. With it, too, came a\r\ncooler calculating intuition that frankness alone would win her now. At\r\nall hazards he must win, and he cast the die.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Taylor,\" he said, \"I want to talk to you--I have wanted to for--a\r\nyear.\" He glanced at her: she was white and silent, but she did not\r\ntremble. He went on:\r\n\r\n\"I have hesitated because I do not know that I have a right to speak or\r\nexplain to--to--a good woman.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt her arm tighten on his and he continued:\r\n\r\n\"You have been to Elspeth's cabin; it is an evil place, and has meant\r\nevil for this community, and for me. Elspeth was my mother's favorite\r\nservant and my own mammy. My mother died when I was ten and left me to\r\nher tender mercies. She let me have my way and encouraged the bad in me.\r\nIt's a wonder I escaped total ruin. Her cabin became a rendezvous for\r\ndrinking and carousing. I told my father, but he, in lazy indifference,\r\ndeclared the place no worse than all Negro cabins, and did nothing. I\r\nceased my visits. Still she tried every lure and set false stories going\r\namong the Negroes, even when I sought to rescue Zora. I tell you this\r\nbecause I know you have heard evil rumors. I have not been a good\r\nman--Mary; but I love you, and you can make me good.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps no other appeal would have stirred Mary Taylor. She was in many\r\nrespects an inexperienced girl. But she thought she knew the world; she\r\nknew that Harry Cresswell was not all he should be, and she knew too\r\nthat many other men were not. Moreover, she argued he had not had a fair\r\nchance. All the school-ma'am in her leaped to his teaching. What he\r\nneeded was a superior person like herself. She loved him, and she\r\ndeliberately put her arms about his neck and lifted her face to be\r\nkissed.\r\n\r\nBack by the place of the Silver Fleece they wandered, across the Big\r\nRoad, up to the mansion. On the steps stood John Taylor and Helen\r\nCresswell hand in hand and they all smiled at each other. The Colonel\r\ncame out, smiling too, with the paper in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Easterly's right,\" he beamed, \"the stock of the Cotton Combine--\" he\r\npaused at the silence and looked up. The smile faded slowly and the red\r\nblood mounted to his forehead. Anger struggled back of surprise, but\r\nbefore it burst forth silently the Colonel turned, and muttering some\r\nunintelligible word, went slowly into the house and slammed the door.\r\n\r\nSo for Harry Cresswell the day burst, flamed, and waned, and then\r\nsuddenly went out, leaving him dull and gray; for Mary and her brother\r\nhad gone North, Helen had gone to bed, and the Colonel was in town.\r\nOutside the weather was gusty and lowering with a chill in the air. He\r\npaced the room fitfully.\r\n\r\nWell, he was happy. Or, was he happy?\r\n\r\nHe gnawed his mustache, for already his quick, changeable nature was\r\nfeeling the rebound from glory to misery. He was a little ashamed of his\r\nexaltation; a bit doubtful and uncertain. He had stooped low to this\r\nYankee school-ma'am, lower than he had ever stooped to a woman. Usually,\r\nwhile he played at loving, women grovelled; for was he not a Cresswell?\r\nWould this woman recognize that fact and respect him accordingly?\r\n\r\nThen there was Zora; what had she said and hinted to Mary? The wench was\r\nalways eluding and mocking him, the black devil! But, pshaw!--he poured\r\nhimself a glass of brandy--was he not rich and young? The world was his.\r\n\r\nHis valet knocked.\r\n\r\n\"Gentleman is asking if you forgits it's Saturday night, sir?\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nCresswell walked thoughtfully to the window, swept back the curtain, and\r\nlooked toward the darkness and the swamp. It lowered threateningly;\r\nbehind it the night sky was tinged with blood.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said; \"I'm not going.\" And he shut out the glow.\r\n\r\nYet he grew more and more restless. The devil danced in his veins and\r\nburned in his forehead. His hands shook. He heard a rustle of departing\r\nfeet beneath his window, then a pause and a faint halloo.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he called, and in a moment went downstairs and out into\r\nthe night. As he closed the front door there seemed to come faintly up\r\nfrom the swamp a low ululation, like the prolonged cry of some wild\r\nbird, or the wail of one's mourning for his dead.\r\n\r\nWithin the cabin, Elspeth heard. Tremblingly, she swayed to her feet, a\r\nhaggard, awful sight. She motioned Zora away, and stretching her hands\r\npalms upward to the sky, cried with dry and fear-struck gasp:\r\n\r\n\"I'se called! I'se called!\"\r\n\r\nOn the bed the child smiled in its dreaming; the red flame of the\r\nfirelight set the gold to dancing in her hair. Zora shrank back into the\r\nshadows and listened. Then it came. She heard the heavy footsteps\r\ncrashing through the underbrush--coming, coming, as from the end of the\r\nworld. She shrank still farther back, and a shadow swept the door.\r\n\r\nHe was a mighty man, black and white-haired, and his eyes were the eyes\r\nof death. He bent to enter the door, and then uplifting himself and\r\nstretching his great arms, his palms touched the blackened rafters.\r\n\r\nZora started forward. Thick memories of some forgotten past came piling\r\nin upon her. Where had she known him? What was he to her?\r\n\r\nSlowly Elspeth, with quivering hands, unwound the black and snake-like\r\nobject that always guarded her breast. Without a word, he took it, and\r\nagain his hands flew heavenward. With a low and fearful moan the old\r\nwoman lurched sideways, then crashed, like a fallen pine, upon the\r\nhearthstone. She lay still--dead.\r\n\r\nThree times the man passed his hands, wave-like, above the dead. Three\r\ntimes he murmured, and his eyes burned into the shadows, where the girl\r\ntrembled. Then he turned and went as he had come, his heavy feet\r\ncrashing through the underbrush, on and on, fainter and fainter, as to\r\nthe end of the world.\r\n\r\nZora shook herself from the trance-like horror and passed her hands\r\nacross her eyes to drive out the nightmare. But, no! there lay the dead\r\nupon the hearth with the firelight flashing over her, a bloated,\r\nhideous, twisted thing, distorted in the rigor of death. A moment Zora\r\nlooked down upon her mother. She felt the cold body whence the\r\nwandering, wrecked soul had passed. She sat down and stared death in the\r\nface for the first time. A mighty questioning arose within, a\r\nquestioning and a yearning.\r\n\r\nWas Elspeth now at peace? Was Death the Way--the wide, dark Way? She had\r\nnever thought of it before, and as she thought she crept forward and\r\nlooked into the fearful face pityingly.\r\n\r\n\"Mammy!\" she whispered--with bated breath--\"Mammy Elspeth!\" Out of the\r\nnight came a whispered answer: \"_Elspeth! Elspeth!_\"\r\n\r\nZora sprang to her feet, alert, fearful. With a swing of her arm, she\r\npulled the great oaken door to and dropped the bar into its place. Over\r\nthe dead she spread a clean white sheet. Into the fire she thrust\r\npine-knots. They glared in vague red, and shadowy brilliance, waving and\r\nquivering and throwing up thin swirling columns of black smoke. Then\r\nstanding beside the fireplace with the white, still corpse between her\r\nand the door, she took up her awful vigil.\r\n\r\nThere came a low knocking at the door; then silence and footsteps\r\nwandering furtively about. The night seemed all footsteps and whispers.\r\nThere came a louder knocking, and a voice:\r\n\r\n\"_Elspeth! Elspeth! Open the door; it's me._\"\r\n\r\nThen muttering and wandering noises, and silence again.\r\n\r\nThe child on the bed turned itself, murmuring uneasily in its dreams.\r\nAnd then _they_ came. Zora froze, watching the door, wide-eyed, while\r\nthe fire flamed redder. A loud quick knock at the door--a pause--an oath\r\nand a cry.\r\n\r\n\"_Elspeth! Open this door, damn you!_\"\r\n\r\nA moment of waiting and then the knocking came again, furious and long\r\ncontinued. Outside there was much trampling and swearing. Zora did not\r\nmove; the child slept on. A tugging and dragging, a dull blow that set\r\nthe cabin quivering; then,--\r\n\r\n\"_Bang! Crack! Crash!_\"--the door wavered, splintered, and dropped upon\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nWith a snarl, a crowd of some half-dozen white faces rushed forward,\r\nwavered and stopped. The awakened child sat up and stared with wide blue\r\neyes. Slowly, with no word, the intruders turned and went silently away,\r\nleaving but one late comer who pressed forward.\r\n\r\n\"What damned mummery is this?\" he cried, and snatching at the sheet,\r\ndragged it from the black distorted countenance of the corpse. He\r\nshuddered but for a moment he could not stir. He felt the midnight eyes\r\nof the girl--he saw the twisted, oozing mouth of the hag, blue-black and\r\nhideous.\r\n\r\nSuddenly back behind there in the darkness a shriek split the night like\r\na sudden flash of flame--a great ringing scream that cracked and swelled\r\nand stopped. With one wild effort the man hurled himself out the door\r\nand plunged through the darkness. Panting and cursing, he flashed his\r\nhuge revolver--\"_bang! bang! bang!_\" it cracked into the night. The\r\nsweat poured from his forehead; the terror of the swamp was upon him.\r\nWith a struggling and tearing in his throat, he tripped and fell\r\nfainting under the silent oaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty_\r\n\r\nTHE WEAVING OF THE SILVER FLEECE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Silver Fleece, darkly cloaked and girded, lay in the cotton\r\nwarehouse of the Cresswells, near the store. Its silken fibres, cramped\r\nand close, shone yellow-white in the sunlight; sadly soiled, yet\r\nbeautiful. Many came to see Zora's twin bales, as they lay, handling\r\nthem and questioning, while Colonel Cresswell grew proud of his\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world was going well with the Colonel. Freed from money cares,\r\npraised for his generalship in the cotton corner, able to entertain\r\nsumptuously, he was again a Southern gentleman of the older school, and\r\nso in his envied element. Yet today he frowned as he stood poking\r\nabsently with his cane at the baled Fleece.\r\n\r\nThis marriage--or, rather, these marriages--were not to his liking. It\r\nwas a _mesalliance_ of a sort that pricked him tenderly; it savored\r\ngrossly of bargain and sale. His neighbors regarded it with\r\ndisconcerting equanimity. They seemed to think an alliance with\r\nNorthern millions an honor for Cresswell blood, and the Colonel thumped\r\nthe nearer bale vigorously. His cane slipped along the iron bands\r\nsuddenly, and the old man lurching forward, clutched in space to save\r\nhimself and touched a human hand.\r\n\r\nZora, sitting shadowed on the farther bale, drew back her hand quickly\r\nat the contact, and started to move away.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" thundered the Colonel, more angry at his involuntary\r\nfright than at the intrusion. \"Here, boys!\"\r\n\r\nBut Zora had come forward into the space where the sunlight of the wide\r\nfront doors poured in upon the cotton bales.\r\n\r\n\"It's me, Colonel,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe glared at her. She was taller and thinner than formerly, darkly\r\ntransparent of skin, and her dark eyes shone in strange and dusky\r\nbrilliance. Still indignant and surprised, the Colonel lifted his voice\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil are you doing here?--sleeping when you ought to be at\r\nwork! Get out! And see here, next week cotton chopping begins--you'll go\r\nto the fields or to the chain-gang. I'll have no more of your loafing\r\nabout my place.\"\r\n\r\nAwaiting no reply, the Colonel, already half ashamed of his vehemence,\r\nstormed out into the sunlight and climbed upon his bay mare.\r\n\r\nBut Zora still stood silent in the shadow of the Silver Fleece, hearing\r\nand yet not hearing. She was searching for the Way, groping for the\r\nthreads of life, seeking almost wildly to understand the foundations of\r\nunderstanding, piteously asking for answer to the puzzle of life. All\r\nthe while the walls rose straight about her and narrow. To continue in\r\nschool meant charity, yet she had nowhere to go and nothing to go with.\r\nTo refuse to work for the Cresswells meant trouble for the school and\r\nperhaps arrest for herself. To work in the fields meant endless toil and\r\na vista that opened upon death.\r\n\r\nLike a hunted thing the girl turned and twisted in thought and faced\r\neverywhere the blank Impossible. Cold and dreamlike without, her shut\r\nteeth held back seething fires within, and a spirit of revolt that\r\ngathered wildness as it grew. Above all flew the dream, the phantasy,\r\nthe memory of the past, the vision of the future. Over and over she\r\nwhispered to herself: \"This is not the End; this can not be the End.\"\r\n\r\nSomehow, somewhere, would come salvation. Yet what it would be and what\r\nshe expected she did not know. She sought the Way, but what way and\r\nwhither she did not know, she dared not dream.\r\n\r\nOne thing alone lay in her wild fancy like a great and wonderful fact\r\ndragging the dream to earth and anchoring it there. That was the Silver\r\nFleece. Like a brooding mother, Zora had watched it. She knew how the\r\ngin had been cleaned for its pressing and how it had been baled apart\r\nand carefully covered. She knew how proud Colonel Cresswell was of it\r\nand how daily he had visitors to see it and finger the wide white wound\r\nin its side.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, grown on my place, by my niggers, sir!\" he assured them; and\r\nthey marvelled.\r\n\r\nTo Zora's mind, this beautiful baled fibre was hers; it typified\r\nhappiness; it was an holy thing which profane hands had stolen. When it\r\ncame back to her (as come it must, she cried with clenched hands) it\r\nwould bring happiness; not the great Happiness--that was gone\r\nforever--but illumination, atonement, and something of the power and the\r\nglory. So, involuntarily almost, she haunted the cotton storehouse,\r\nflitting like a dark and silent ghost in among the workmen, greeting\r\nthem with her low musical voice, warding them with the cold majesty of\r\nher eyes; each day afraid of some last parting, each night\r\ntriumphant--it was still there!\r\n\r\nThe Colonel--Zora already forgotten--rode up to the Cresswell Oaks,\r\npondering darkly. It was bad enough to contemplate Helen's marriage in\r\ndistant prospect, but the sudden, almost peremptory desire for marrying\r\nat Eastertide, a little less than two months away, was absurd. There\r\nwere \"business reasons arising from the presidential campaign in the\r\nfall,\" John Taylor had telegraphed; but there was already too much\r\nbusiness in the arrangement to suit the Colonel. With Harry it was\r\ndifferent. Indeed it was his own quiet suggestion that made John Taylor\r\nhurry matters.\r\n\r\nHarry trusted to the novelty of his father's new wealth to make the\r\nlatter complacent; he himself felt an impatient longing for the haven of\r\na home. He had been too long untethered. He distrusted himself. The\r\ndevil within was too fond of taking the bit in his teeth. He would\r\nremember to his dying day one awful shriek in the night, as of a soul\r\ntormenting and tormented. He wanted the protection of a good woman, and\r\nsometimes against the clear whiteness of her letters so joyous and\r\ngenerous, even if a bit prim and didactic, he saw a vision of himself\r\nreflected as he was, and he feared.\r\n\r\nIt was distinctively disconcerting to Colonel Cresswell to find Harry\r\nquite in favor of early nuptials, and to learn that the sole objection\r\neven in Helen's mind was the improbability of getting a wedding-gown in\r\ntime. Helen had all a child's naive love for beautiful and dainty\r\nthings, and a wedding-gown from Paris had been her life dream. On this\r\npoint, therefore, there ensued spirited arguments and much\r\ncorrespondence, and both her brother and her lover evinced\r\ncharacteristic interest in the planning.\r\n\r\nSaid Harry: \"Sis, I'll cable to Paris today. They can easily hurry the\r\nthing along.\"\r\n\r\nHelen was delighted; she handed over a telegram just received from John\r\nTaylor. \"Send me, express, two bales best cotton you can get.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel read the message. \"I don't see the connection between this\r\nand hurrying up a wedding-gown,\" he growled. None of them discerned the\r\nhandwriting of Destiny.\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I,\" said Harry, who detected yielding in his father's tone.\r\n\"But we'd better send him the two prize bales; it will be a fine\r\nadvertisement of our plantation, and evidently he has a surprise in\r\nstore for us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel affected to hesitate, but next morning the Silver Fleece\r\nwent to town.\r\n\r\nZora watched it go, and her heart swelled and died within her. She\r\nwalked to town, to the station. She did not see Mrs. Vanderpool arriving\r\nfrom New Orleans; but Mrs. Vanderpool saw her, and looked curiously at\r\nthe tall, tragic figure that leaned so dolorously beside the freight\r\ncar. The bales were loaded into the express car; the train pulled away,\r\nits hoarse snorting waking vague echoes in the forest beyond. But to the\r\ngirl who stood at the End, looking outward to darkness, those echoes\r\nroared like the crack of doom. A passing band of contract hands called\r\nto her mockingly, and one black giant, laughing loudly, gripped her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Come, honey,\" he shouted, \"you'se a'dreaming! Come on, honey!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned abruptly and gripped his hand, as one drowning grips anything\r\noffered--gripped till he winced. She laughed a loud mirthless laugh,\r\nthat came pouring like a sob from her deep lungs.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" she mocked, and joined them.\r\n\r\nThey were a motley crowd, ragged, swaggering, jolly. There were husky,\r\nbig-limbed youths, and bold-faced, loud-tongued girls. To-morrow they\r\nwould start up-country to some backwoods barony in the kingdom of\r\ncotton, and work till Christmas time. Today was the last in town; there\r\nwas craftily advanced money in their pockets and riot in their hearts.\r\nIn the gathering twilight they marched noisily through the streets; in\r\ntheir midst, wide-eyed and laughing almost hysterically, marched Zora.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool meantime rode thoughtfully out of town toward Cresswell\r\nOaks. She was returning from witnessing the Mardi Gras festivities at\r\nNew Orleans and at the urgent invitation of the Cresswells had stopped\r\noff. She might even stay to the wedding if the new plans matured.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool was quite upset. Her French maid, on whom she had\r\ndepended absolutely for five years or more, had left her.\r\n\r\n\"I think I want to try a colored maid,\" she told the Cresswells,\r\nlaughingly, as they drove home. \"They have sweet voices and they can't\r\ndoff their uniform. Helene without her cap and apron was often mistaken\r\nfor a lady, and while I was in New Orleans a French confectioner married\r\nher under some such delusion. Now, haven't you a girl about here who\r\nwould do?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" declared Harry decisively, but his sister suggested that she might\r\nask Miss Smith at the colored school.\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs. Vanderpool laughed, but after tea she wandered idly down the\r\nroad. The sun behind the swamp was crimsoning the world. Mrs. Vanderpool\r\nstrolled alone to the school, and saw Sarah Smith. There was no\r\ncordiality in the latter's greeting, but when she heard the caller's\r\nerrand her attention was at once arrested and held. The interests of her\r\ncharges were always uppermost in her mind.\r\n\r\n\"Can't I have the girl Zora?\" Mrs. Vanderpool at last inquired.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith started, for she was thinking of Zora at that very instant.\r\nThe girl was later than usual, and she was momentarily expecting to see\r\nher tall form moving languidly up the walk.\r\n\r\nShe gave Mrs. Vanderpool a searching look. Mrs. Vanderpool glanced\r\ninvoluntarily at her gown and smiled as she did it.\r\n\r\n\"Could I trust you with a human soul?\" asked Miss Smith abruptly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool looked up quickly. The half mocking answer that rose\r\ninvoluntarily to her lips was checked. Within, Mrs. Vanderpool was a\r\nlittle puzzled at herself. Why had she asked for this girl? She had felt\r\na strange interest in her--a peculiar human interest since she first saw\r\nher and as she saw her again this afternoon. But would she make a\r\nsatisfactory maid? Was it not a rather dangerous experiment? Why had she\r\nasked for her? She certainly had not intended to when she entered the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIn the silence Miss Smith continued: \"Here is a child in whom the\r\nfountains of the great deep are suddenly broken up. With peace and care\r\nshe would find herself, for she is strong. But here there is no peace.\r\nSlavery of soul and body awaits her and I am powerless to protect her.\r\nShe must go away. That going away may make or ruin her. She knows\r\nnothing of working for wages and she has not the servant's humility; but\r\nshe has loyalty and pluck. For one she loves there is nothing she would\r\nnot do; but she cannot be driven. Or rather, if she is driven, it may\r\nrouse in her the devil incarnate. She needs not exactly affection--she\r\nwould almost resent that--but intelligent interest and care. In return\r\nfor this she will gradually learn to serve and serve loyally. Frankly,\r\nMrs. Vanderpool, I would not have chosen you for this task of human\r\neducation. Indeed, you would have been my last thought--you seem to\r\nme--I speak plainly--a worldly woman. Yet, perhaps--who can tell?--God\r\nhas especially set you to this task. At any rate, I have little choice.\r\nI am at my wits' end. Elspeth, the mother of this child, is not long\r\ndead; and here is the girl, beautiful, unprotected; and here am I,\r\nalmost helpless. She is in debt to the Cresswells, and they are pressing\r\nthe claim to her service. Take her if you can get her--it is, I fear,\r\nher only chance. Mind you--if you can persuade her; and that may be\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she now?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith glanced out at the darkening landscape, and then at her\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know; she's very late. She's given to wandering, but usually\r\nshe is here before this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw her in town this afternoon,\" said Mrs. Vanderpool.\r\n\r\n\"Zora? In town?\" Miss Smith rose. \"I'll send her to you tomorrow,\" she\r\nsaid quietly. Mrs. Vanderpool had hardly reached the Oaks before Miss\r\nSmith was driving toward town.\r\n\r\nA small cabin on the town's ragged fringe was crowded to suffocation.\r\nWithin arose noisy shouts, loud songs, and raucous laughter; the\r\nscraping of a fiddle and whine of an accordion. Liquor began to appear\r\nand happy faces grew red-eyed and sodden as the dances whirled. At the\r\nedge of the orgy stood Zora, wild-eyed and bewildered, mad with the pain\r\nthat gripped her heart and hammered in her head, crying in tune with the\r\nfrenzied music--\"the End--the End!\"\r\n\r\nAbruptly she recognized a face despite the wreck and ruin of its beauty.\r\n\r\n\"Bertie!\" she cried as she seized the mother of little Emma by the arm.\r\n\r\nThe woman staggered and offered her glass.\r\n\r\n\"Drink,\" she cried, \"drink and forget.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment Zora sprang forward and seized the burning liquid in both\r\nhands. A dozen hands clapped a devil's tattoo. A score of voices yelled\r\nand laughed. The shriek of the music was drowned beneath the thunder of\r\nstamping feet. Men reeled to singing women's arms, but above the roar\r\nrose the song of the voice of Zora--she glided to the middle of the\r\nroom, standing tip-toed with skirts that curled and turned; she threw\r\nback her head, raised the liquor to her lips, paused and looked into the\r\nface of Miss Smith.\r\n\r\nA silence fell like a lightning flash on the room as that white face\r\npeered in at the door. Slowly Zora's hands fell and her eyes blinked as\r\nthough waking from some awful dream. She staggered toward the woman's\r\noutstretched arms....\r\n\r\nLate that night the girl lay close in Miss Smith's motherly embrace.\r\n\r\n\"I was going to hell!\" she whispered, trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Zora?\" asked Miss Smith calmly.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't find the Way--and I wanted to forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"People in hell don't forget,\" was the matter-of-fact comment. \"And,\r\nZora, what way do you seek? The way where?\"\r\n\r\nZora sat up in bed, and lifted a gray and stricken face.\r\n\r\n\"It's a lie,\" she cried, with hoarse earnedstness, \"the way nowhere.\r\nThere is no Way! You know--I want _him_--I want nothing on earth but\r\nhim--and him I can't ever have.\"\r\n\r\nThe older woman drew her down tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"No, Zora,\" she said, \"there's something you want more than him and\r\nsomething you can have!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked the wondering girl.\r\n\r\n\"His respect,\" said Sarah Smith, \"and I know the Way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty-one_\r\n\r\nTHE MARRIAGE MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool watched Zora as she came up the path beneath the oaks.\r\n\"She walks well,\" she observed. And laying aside her book, she waited\r\nwith a marked curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe girl's greeting was brief, almost curt, but unintentionally so, as\r\none could easily see, for back in her eyes lurked an impatient hunger;\r\nshe was not thinking of greetings. She murmured a quick word, and stood\r\nstraight and tall with her eyes squarely on the lady.\r\n\r\nIn the depths of Mrs. Vanderpool's heart something strange--not new, but\r\nvery old--stirred. Before her stood this tall black girl, quietly\r\nreturning her look. Mrs. Vanderpool had a most uncomfortable sense of\r\nbeing judged, of being weighed,--and there arose within her an impulse\r\nto self-justification.\r\n\r\nShe smiled and said sweetly, \"Won't you sit?\" But despite all this, her\r\nmind seemed leaping backward a thousand years; back to a simpler,\r\nprimal day when she herself, white, frail, and fettered, stood before\r\nthe dusky magnificence of some bejewelled barbarian queen and sought to\r\njustify herself. She shook off the phantasy,--and yet how well the girl\r\nstood. It was not every one that could stand still and well.\r\n\r\n\"Please sit down,\" she repeated with her softest charm, not dreaming\r\nthat outside the school white persons did not ask this girl to sit in\r\ntheir presence. But even this did not move Zora. She sat down. There was\r\nin her, walking, standing, sitting, a simple directness which Mrs.\r\nVanderpool sensed and met.\r\n\r\n\"Zora, I need some one to help me--to do my hair and serve my coffee,\r\nand dress and take care of me. The work will not be hard, and you can\r\ntravel and see the world and live well. Would you like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do not know how to do all these things,\" returned Zora, slowly.\r\nShe was thinking rapidly--Was this the Way? It sounded wonderful. The\r\nWorld, the great mysterious World, that stretched beyond the swamp and\r\ninto which Bles and the Silver Fleece had gone--did it lead to the Way?\r\nBut if she went there what would she see and do, and would it be\r\npossible to become such a woman as Miss Smith pictured?\r\n\r\n\"What is the world like?\" asked Zora.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool smiled. \"Oh, I meant great active cities and buildings,\r\nmyriads of people and wonderful sights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--but back of it all, what is it really? What does it look like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, child! Don't ask. Really, it isn't worth while peering back of\r\nthings. One is sure to be disappointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what's the use of seeing the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, one must live; and why not be happy?\" answered Mrs. Vanderpool,\r\namused, baffled, spurred for the time being from her chronic _ennui_.\r\n\r\n\"Are you happy?\" retorted Zora, looking her over carefully, from silken\r\nstockings to garden hat. Mrs. Vanderpool laid aside her little mockery\r\nand met the situation bravely.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she replied simply. Her eyes grew old and tired.\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily Zora's hand crept out protectingly and lay a moment over\r\nthe white jewelled fingers. Then quickly recovering herself, she started\r\nhastily to withdraw it, but the woman's fingers closed around the darker\r\nones, and Mrs. Vanderpool's eyes became dim.\r\n\r\n\"I need you, Zora,\" she said; and then, seeing the half-formed question,\r\n\"Yes, and you need me; we need each other. In the world lies\r\nopportunity, and I will help you.\"\r\n\r\nZora rose abruptly, and Mrs. Vanderpool feared, with a tightening of\r\nheart, that she had lost this strangely alluring girl.\r\n\r\n\"I will come to-morrow,\" said Zora.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Vanderpool went in to lunch, reaction and lingering doubts came\r\ntrouping back. To replace the daintiest of trained experts with the most\r\nbaffling semi-barbarian, well!\r\n\r\n\"Have you hired a maid?\" asked Helen.\r\n\r\n\"I've engaged Zora,\" laughed Mrs. Vanderpool, lightly; \"and now I'm\r\nwondering whether I have a jewel or--a white elephant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably neither,\" remarked Harry Cresswell, drily; but he avoided the\r\nlady's inquiring eyes.\r\n\r\nNext morning Zora came easily into Mrs. Vanderpool's life. There was\r\nlittle she knew of her duties, but little, too, that she could not learn\r\nwith a deftness and divination almost startling. Her quietness, her\r\nquickness, her young strength, were like a soothing balm to the tired\r\nwoman of fashion, and within a week she had sunk back contentedly into\r\nZora's strong arms.\r\n\r\n\"It's a jewel,\" she decided.\r\n\r\nWith this verdict, the house agreed. The servants waited on \"Miss Zora\"\r\ngladly; the men scarcely saw her, and the ladies ran to her for help in\r\nall sorts. Harry Cresswell looked upon this transformation with an\r\namused smile, but the Colonel saw in it simply evidence of dangerous\r\nobstinacy in a black girl who hitherto had refused to work.\r\n\r\nZora had been in the house but a week when a large express package was\r\nreceived from John Taylor. Its unwrapping brought a cry of pleasure\r\nfrom the ladies. There lay a bolt of silken-like cambric of wondrous\r\nfineness and lustre, marked: \"For the wedding-dress.\" The explanation\r\naccompanied the package, that Mary Taylor had a similar piece in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nHelen and Harry said nothing of the cablegram to the Paris tailor, and\r\nHelen took no steps toward having the cambric dress made, not even when\r\nthe wedding invitations appeared.\r\n\r\n\"A Cresswell married in cotton!\" Helen was almost in tears lest the\r\nParis gown be delayed, and sure enough a cablegram came at last saying\r\nthat there was little likelihood of the gown being ready by Easter. It\r\nwould be shipped at the earliest convenience, but it could hardly catch\r\nthe necessary boat. Helen had a good cry, and then came a wild rush to\r\nget John Taylor's cloth ready. Still, Helen was querulous. She decided\r\nthat silk embroidery must embellish the skirt. The dressmaker was in\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't a single spare worker,\" she declared.\r\n\r\nHelen was appealing to Mrs. Vanderpool.\r\n\r\n\"I can do it,\" said Zora, who was in the room.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know how?\" asked the dressmaker.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I want to know.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool gave a satisfied nod. \"Show her,\" she said. The\r\ndressmaker was on the edge of rebellion. \"Zora sews beautifully,\" added\r\nMrs. Vanderpool.\r\n\r\nThus the beautiful cloth came to Zora's room, and was spread in a glossy\r\ncloud over her bed. She trembled at its beauty and felt a vague inner\r\nyearning, as if some subtle magic of the woven web were trying to tell\r\nher its story.\r\n\r\nShe worked over it faithfully and lovingly in every spare hour and in\r\nlong nights of dreaming. Wilfully she departed from the set pattern and\r\nsewed into the cloth something of the beauty in her heart. In new and\r\nintricate ways, with soft shadowings and coverings, she wove in that\r\nwhite veil her own strange soul, and Mrs. Vanderpool watched her\r\ncuriously, but in silence.\r\n\r\nMeantime all things were arranged for a double wedding at Cresswell\r\nOaks. As John and Mary Taylor had no suitable home, they were to come\r\ndown and the two brides to go forth from the Cresswell mansion.\r\nAccordingly the Taylors arrived a week before the wedding and the home\r\ntook on a festive air. Even Colonel Cresswell expanded under the genial\r\ninfluences, and while his head still protested his heart was glad. He\r\nhad to respect John Taylor's undoubted ability; and Mary Taylor was\r\ncertainly lovely, in spite of that assumption of cleverness of which the\r\nColonel could not approve.\r\n\r\nMary returned to the old scenes with mingled feelings. Especially was\r\nshe startled at seeing Zora a member of the household and apparently\r\nhigh in favor. It brought back something of the old uneasiness and\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nAll this she soon forgot under the cadence of Harry Cresswell's pleasant\r\nvoice and the caressing touch of his arm. He seemed handsomer than ever;\r\nand he was, for sleep and temperance and the wooing of a woman had put a\r\ntinge in his marble face, smoothed the puffs beneath his eyes, and given\r\nhim a more distinguished bearing and a firmer hand. And Mary Taylor was\r\nvery happy. So was her brother, only differently; he was making money;\r\nhe was planning to make more, and he had something to pet which seemed\r\nto him extraordinarily precious and valuable.\r\n\r\nTaylor eagerly inquired after the cloth, and followed the ladies to\r\nZora's room, adjoining Mrs. Vanderpool's, to see it. It lay uncut and\r\nshimmering, covered with dim silken tracery of a delicacy and beauty\r\nwhich brought an exclamation to all lips.\r\n\r\n\"That's what we can do with Alabama cotton,\" cried John Taylor in\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThey turned to him incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"But--\"\r\n\r\n\"No 'buts' about it; these are the two bales you sent me, woven with a\r\nsilk woof.\" No one particularly noticed that Zora had hastily left the\r\nroom. \"I had it done in Easterly's New Jersey mills according to an old\r\nplan of mine. I'm going to make cloth like that right in this county\r\nsome day,\" and he chuckled gayly.\r\n\r\nBut Zora was striding up and down the halls, the blood surging in her\r\nears. After they were gone she came back and closed the doors. She\r\ndropped on her knees and buried her face in the filmy folds of the\r\nSilver Fleece.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it! I knew it!\" she whispered in mingled tears and joy. \"It\r\ncalled and I did not understand.\"\r\n\r\nIt was her talisman new-found; her love come back, her stolen dream come\r\ntrue. Now she could face the world; God had turned it straight again.\r\nShe would go into the world and find--not Love, but the thing greater\r\nthan Love. Outside the door came voices--the dressmaker's tones, Helen's\r\nsoft drawl, and Mrs. Vanderpool's finished accents. Her face went\r\nsuddenly gray. The Silver Fleece was not hers! It belonged--She rose\r\nhastily. The door opened and they came in. The cutting must begin at\r\nonce, they all agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Is it ready, Zora?\" inquired Helen.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Zora quietly answered, \"not quite, but tomorrow morning, early.\"\r\nAs soon as she was alone again, she sat down and considered. By and by,\r\nwhile the family was at lunch, she folded the Silver Fleece carefully\r\nand locked it in her new trunk. She would hide it in the swamp. During\r\nthe afternoon she sent to town for oil-cloth, and bade the black\r\ncarpenter at Miss Smith's make a cedar box, tight and tarred. In the\r\nmorning she prepared Mrs. Vanderpool's breakfast with unusual care. She\r\nwas sorry for Mrs. Vanderpool, and sorry for Miss Smith. They would not,\r\nthey could not, understand. What would happen to her? She did not know;\r\nshe did not care. The Silver Fleece had returned to her. Soon it would\r\nbe buried in the swamp whence it came. She had no alternative; she must\r\nkeep it and wait.\r\n\r\nShe heard the dressmaker's voice, and then her step upon the stair. She\r\nheard the sound of Harry Cresswell's buggy, and a scurrying at the front\r\ndoor. On came the dressmaker's footsteps--then her door was\r\nunceremoniously burst open.\r\n\r\nHelen Cresswell stood there radiant; the dressmaker, too, was wreathed\r\nin smiles. She carried a big red-sealed bundle.\r\n\r\n\"Zora!\" cried Helen in ecstasy. \"It's come!\" Zora regarded her coldly,\r\nand stood at bay. The dressmaker was ripping and snipping, and soon\r\nthere lay revealed before them--the Paris gown!\r\n\r\nHelen was in raptures, but her conscience pricked her. She appealed to\r\nthem. \"Ought I to tell? You see, Mary's gown will look miserably common\r\nbeside it.\"\r\n\r\nThe dressmaker was voluble. There was really nothing to tell; and\r\nbesides, Helen was a Cresswell and it was to be expected, and so forth.\r\nHelen pursed her lips and petulantly tapped the floor with her foot.\r\n\r\n\"But the other gown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\" asked the dressmaker, looking about. \"It would make a\r\npretty morning-dress--\"\r\n\r\nBut Helen had taken a sudden dislike to the thought of it.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want it,\" she declared. \"And besides, I haven't room for it in\r\nmy trunks.\"\r\n\r\nOf a sudden she leaned down and whispered to Zora: \"Zora, hide it and\r\nkeep it if you want it. Come,\" to the dressmaker, \"I'm dying to try this\r\non--now.... Remember, Zora--not a word.\" And all this to Zora seemed no\r\nsurprise; it was the Way, and it was opening before her because the\r\ntalisman lay in her trunk.\r\n\r\nSo at last it came to Easter morning. The world was golden with jasmine,\r\nand crimson with azalea; down in the darker places gleamed the misty\r\nglory of the dogwood; new cotton shook, glimmered, and blossomed in the\r\nblack fields, and over all the soft Southern sun poured its awakening\r\nlight of life. There was happiness and hope again in the cabins, and\r\nhope and--if not happiness, ambition, in the mansions.\r\n\r\nZora, almost forgetting the wedding, stood before the mirror. Laying\r\naside her dress, she draped her shimmering cloth about her, dragging her\r\nhair down in a heavy mass over ears and neck until she seemed herself a\r\nbride. And as she stood there, awed with the mystical union of a dead\r\nlove and a living new born self, there came drifting in at the window,\r\nfaintly, the soft sound of far-off marriage music.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis thy marriage morning, shining in the sun!\"\r\n\r\nTwo white and white-swathed brides were coming slowly down the great\r\nstaircase of Cresswell Oaks, and two white and black-clothed bridegrooms\r\nawaited them. Either bridegroom looked gladly at the flow of his\r\nsister's garments and almost darkly at his bride's. For Helen was decked\r\nin Parisian splendor, while Mary was gowned in the Fleece.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis thy marriage morning, shining in the sun!\"\r\n\r\nUp floated the song of the little dark-faced children, and Zora\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty-two_\r\n\r\nMISS CAROLINE WYNN\r\n\r\n\r\nBles Alwyn was seated in the anteroom of Senator Smith's office in\r\nWashington. The Senator had not come in yet, and there were others\r\nwaiting, too.\r\n\r\nThe young man sat in a corner, dreaming. Washington was his first great\r\ncity, and it seemed a never-ending delight--the streets, the buildings,\r\nthe crowds; the shops, and lights, and noise; the kaleidoscopic panorama\r\nof a world's doing, the myriad forms and faces, the talk and laughter of\r\nmen. It was all wonderful magic to the country boy, and he stretched his\r\narms and filled his lungs and cried: \"Here I shall live!\"\r\n\r\nEspecially was he attracted by his own people. They seemed transformed,\r\nrevivified, changed. Some might be mistaken for field hands on a\r\nholiday--but not many. Others he did not recognize--they seemed strange\r\nand alien--sharper, quicker, and at once more overbearing and more\r\nunscrupulous.\r\n\r\nThere were yet others--and at the sight of these Bles stood straighter\r\nand breathed like a man. They were well dressed, and well appearing men\r\nand women, who walked upright and looked one in the eye, and seemed like\r\npersons of affairs and money. They had arrived--they were men--they\r\nfilled his mind's ideal--he felt like going up to them and grasping\r\ntheir hands and saying, \"At last, brother!\" Ah, it was good to find\r\none's dreams, walking in the light, in flesh and blood. Continually such\r\nthoughts were surging through his brain, and they were rioting through\r\nit again as he sat waiting in Senator Smith's office.\r\n\r\nThe Senator was late this morning; when he came in he glanced at the\r\nmorning paper before looking over his mail and the list of his callers.\r\n\"Do fools like the American people deserve salvation?\" he sneered,\r\nholding off the headlines and glancing at them.\r\n\r\n\"'League Beats Trust.' ... 'Farmers of South Smash Effort to Bear Market\r\n... Send Cotton to Twelve Cents ... Common People Triumph.'\r\n\r\n\"A man is induced to bite off his own nose and then to sing a pæan of\r\nvictory. It's nauseating--senseless. There is no earthly use striving\r\nfor such blockheads; they'd crucify any Saviour.\" Thus half consciously\r\nSenator Smith salved his conscience, while he extracted a certificate of\r\ndeposit for fifty thousand dollars from his New York mail. He thrust it\r\naside from his secretary's view and looked at his list as he rang the\r\nbell: there was Representative Todd, and somebody named Alwyn--nobody of\r\nimportance. Easterly was due in a half-hour. He would get rid of Todd\r\nmeantime.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Todd,\" he mused; \"a lamb for the slaughter.\"\r\n\r\nBut he patiently listened to him plead for party support and influence\r\nfor his bill to prohibit gambling in futures.\r\n\r\n\"I was warned that it was useless to see you, Senator Smith, but I would\r\ncome. I believe in you. Frankly, there is a strong group of your old\r\nfriends and followers forming against you; they met only last night, but\r\nI did not go. Won't you take a stand on some of these progressive\r\nmatters--this bill, or the Child Labor movement, or Low Tariff\r\nlegislation?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith listened but shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"When the time comes,\" he announced deliberately, \"I shall have\r\nsomething to say on several of these matters. At present I can only say\r\nthat I cannot support this bill,\" and Mr. Todd was ushered out. He met\r\nMr. Easterly coming in and greeted him effusively. He knew him only as a\r\nrich philanthropist, who had helped the Neighborhood Guild in\r\nWashington--one of Todd's hobbies.\r\n\r\nEasterly greeted Smith quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Got my letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are the three bills. You will go on the Finance Committee\r\ntomorrow; Sumdrich is chairman by courtesy, but you'll have the real\r\npower. Put the Child Labor Bill first, and we'll work the press. The\r\nTariff will take most of the session, of course. We'll put the cotton\r\ninspection bill through in the last days of the session--see? I'm\r\nmanoeuvring to get the Southern Congressmen into line.... Oh, one thing.\r\nThompson says he's a little worried about the Negroes; says there's\r\nsomething more than froth in the talk of a bolt in the Northern Negro\r\nvote. We may have to give them a little extra money and a few more minor\r\noffices than usual. Talk with Thompson; the Negroes are sweet on you and\r\nhe's going to be the new chairman of the campaign, you know. Ever met\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a moment,\" the statesman stayed the financier.\r\n\r\n\"Todd just let fall something of a combination against us in\r\nCongress--know anything of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not definitely; I heard some rumors. Better see if you can run it down.\r\nWell, I must hurry--good day.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Bles Alwyn in the outer office was waiting and musing, a lady\r\ncame in. Out of the corner of his eye he caught the curve of her gown,\r\nand as she seated herself beside him, the suggestion of a faint perfume.\r\nA vague resentment rose in him. Colored women would look as well as\r\nthat, he argued, with the clothes and wealth and training. He paused,\r\nhowever, in his thought: he did not want them like the whites--so cold\r\nand formal and precise, without heart or marrow. He started up, for the\r\nsecretary was speaking to him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the--er--the man who had a letter to the Senator?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see it. Oh, yes--he will see you in a moment.\"\r\n\r\nBles was returning the letter to his pocket when he heard a voice almost\r\nat his ear.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon--\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and started. It was the lady next to him, and she was colored!\r\nNot extremely colored, but undoubtedly colored, with waving black hair,\r\nlight brown skin, and the fuller facial curving of the darker world. And\r\nyet Bles was surprised, for everything else about her--her voice, her\r\nbearing, the set of her gown, her gloves and shoes, the whole impression\r\nwas--Bles hesitated for a word--well, \"white.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes, ma'am,\" he stammered, becoming suddenly conscious that the\r\nlady had now a second time asked him if he was acquainted with Senator\r\nSmith. \"That is, ma'am,\"--why was he saying \"ma'am,\" like a child or a\r\nservant?--\"I know his sister and have a letter for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you live in Washington?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No--but I want to. I've been trying to get in as a clerk, and I haven't\r\nsucceeded yet. That's what I'm going to see Senator Smith about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you had the civil-service examinations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I made ninety-three in the examination for a treasury clerkship.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no appointment? I see--they are not partial to us there.\"\r\n\r\nBles was glad to hear her say \"us.\"\r\n\r\nShe continued after a pause:\r\n\r\n\"May I venture to ask a favor of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" he responded.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Wynn,\" lowering her voice slightly and leaning toward him.\r\n\"There are so many ahead of me and I am in a hurry to get to my school;\r\nbut I must see the Senator--couldn't I go in with you? I think I might\r\nbe of service in this matter of the examination, and then perhaps I'd\r\nget a chance to say a word for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd be very glad to have you come,\" said Bles, cordially.\r\n\r\nThe secretary hesitated a little when the two started in, but Miss\r\nWynn's air was so quietly assured that he yielded.\r\n\r\nSenator Smith looked at the tall, straight black man with his smooth\r\nskin and frank eyes. And for a second time that morning a vision of his\r\nown youth dimmed his eyes. But he spoke coldly:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Alwyn, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, Miss Wynn.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator glanced at Miss Wynn and she bowed demurely. Then he turned\r\nto Alwyn.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Alwyn, Washington is a bad place to start in the world.\"\r\n\r\nBles looked surprised and incredulous. He could conceive of no finer\r\nstarting-place, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"It is a grave,\" continued the Senator, \"of ambitions and ideals. You\r\nwould far better go back to Alabama\"--pausing and looking at the young\r\nman keenly--\"but you won't--you won't--not yet, at any rate.\" And Bles\r\nshook his head slowly.\r\n\r\n\"No--well, what can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want work--I'll do anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you'll do one thing--be a clerk, and then if you have the right\r\nstuff in you you will throw up that job in a year and start again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like at least to try it, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't help you much there; that's in civil-service, and you\r\nmust take the examination.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"So? Where, and what mark?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Treasury Department; I got a mark of ninety-three.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!--and no appointment?\" The Senator was incredulous.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; not yet.\"\r\n\r\nHere Miss Wynn interposed.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Senator,\" she said, \"civil-service rules are not always\r\nimpervious to race prejudice.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator frowned.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to intimate that Mr. Alwyn's appointment is held up because\r\nhe is colored?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--well!\" The Senator rang for a clerk.\r\n\r\n\"Get me the Treasury on the telephone.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment the bell rang.\r\n\r\n\"I want Mr. Cole. Is that you, Mr. Cole? Good-morning. Have you a young\r\nman named Alwyn on your eligible list? What? Yes?\" A pause. \"Indeed?\r\nWell, why has he no appointment? Of course, I know, he's a Negro. Yes, I\r\ndesire it very much--thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get an appointment to-morrow morning,\" and the Senator rose.\r\n\"How is my sister?\" he asked absently.\r\n\r\n\"She was looking worried, but hopeful of the new endowment when I left.\"\r\nThe Senator held out his hand; Bles took it and then remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I beg pardon, but Miss Wynn wanted a word on another matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator turned to Miss Wynn.\r\n\r\n\"I am a school-teacher, Senator Smith, and like all the rest of us I am\r\ndeeply interested in the appointment of the new school-board.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know the district committee attends to those things,\" said the\r\nSenator hastily. \"And then, too, I believe there is talk of abolishing\r\nthe school-board and concentrating power in the hands of the\r\nsuperintendent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said Miss Wynn. \"And I came to tell you, Senator Smith,\r\nthat the interests which are back of this attack upon the schools are no\r\nfriends of yours.\" Miss Wynn extracted from her reticule a typewritten\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nHe took the paper and read it intently. Then he keenly scrutinized the\r\nyoung woman, and she steadily returned his regard.\r\n\r\n\"How am I to know this is true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow it up and see.\"\r\n\r\nHe mused.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get these facts?\" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n\"It is hardly necessary to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" he persisted, \"if I were sure of its source I would know my\r\nground better and--my obligation to you would be greater.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed and glanced toward Alwyn. He had moved out of earshot and\r\nwas waiting by the window.\r\n\r\n\"I am a teacher in the M Street High School,\" she said, \"and we have\r\nsome intelligent boys there who work their way through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Senator.\r\n\r\n\"Some,\" continued Miss Wynn, tapping her boot on the carpet, \"some--wait\r\non table.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator slowly put the paper in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" he said, \"Miss Wynn, what can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"If Judge Haynes is reappointed to the school-board I shall probably\r\ncontinue to teach in the M Street High School,\" she said slowly.\r\n\r\nThe Senator made a memorandum and said:\r\n\r\n\"I shall not forget Miss Wynn--nor her friends.\" And he bowed, glancing\r\nat Alwyn.\r\n\r\nThe woman contemplated Bles in momentary perplexity, then bowing in\r\nturn, left. Bles followed, debating just what he ought to say, how far\r\nhe might venture to accompany her, what--but she easily settled it all.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you--good-bye,\" she said briefly at the door, and was gone.\r\nBles did not know whether to feel relieved or provoked, or disappointed,\r\nand by way of compromise felt something of all three.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he received notice of his appointment to a clerkship in\r\nthe Treasury Department, at a salary of nine hundred dollars. The sum\r\nseemed fabulous and he was in the seventh heaven. For many days the\r\nconsciousness of wealth, the new duties, the street scenes, and the city\r\nlife kept him more than busy. He planned to study, and arranged with a\r\nprofessor at Howard University to guide him. He bought an armful of\r\nbooks and a desk, and plunged desperately to work.\r\n\r\nGradually as he became used to the office routine, and in the hours when\r\nhe was weary of study, he began to find time hanging a little heavily on\r\nhis hands; indeed--although he would not acknowledge it--he was getting\r\nlonesome, homesick, amid the myriad men of a busy city. He argued to\r\nhimself that this was absurd, and yet he knew that he was longing for\r\nhuman companionship. When he looked about him for fellowship he found\r\nhimself in a strange dilemma: those black folk in whom he recognized the\r\nold sweet-tempered Negro traits, had also looser, uglier manners than he\r\nwas accustomed to, from which he shrank. The upper classes of Negroes,\r\non the other hand, he still observed from afar; they were strangers not\r\nonly in acquaintance but because of a curious coldness and aloofness\r\nthat made them cease to seem his own kind; they seemed almost at times\r\nlike black white people--strangers in way and thought.\r\n\r\nHe tried to shake off this feeling but it clung, and at last in sheer\r\ndesperation, he promised to go out of a night with a fellow clerk who\r\nrather boasted of the \"people\" he knew. He was soon tired of the\r\nstrange company, and had turned to go home, when he met a newcomer in\r\nthe doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Why, hello, Sam! Sam Stillings!\" he exclaimed delightedly, and was soon\r\ngrasping the hand of a slim, well-dressed man of perhaps thirty, with\r\nyellow face, curling hair, and shifting eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all things, Bles--er--ah--Mr. Alwyn! Thought you were hoeing\r\ncotton.\"\r\n\r\nBles laughed and continued shaking his head. He was foolishly glad to\r\nsee the former Cresswell butler, whom he had known but slightly. His\r\nface brought back unuttered things that made his heart beat faster and a\r\nyearning surge within him.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you went to Chicago,\" cried Bles.\r\n\r\n\"I did, but goin' into politics--having entered the political field, I\r\ncame here. And you graduated, I suppose, and all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Bless admitted a little sadly, as he told of his coming north, and\r\nof Senator Smith's influence. \"But--but how are--all?\"\r\n\r\nAbruptly Sam hooked his arm into Alwyn's and pulled him with him down\r\nthe street. Stillings was a type. Up from servility and menial service\r\nhe was struggling to climb to money and power. He was shrewd, willing to\r\nstoop to anything in order to win. The very slights and humiliations of\r\nprejudice he turned to his advantage. When he learned all the\r\nparticulars of Alwyn's visit to Senator Smith and his cordial reception\r\nhe judged it best to keep in touch with this young man, and he forthwith\r\ninvited Bles to accompany him the next night to the Fifteenth Street\r\nPresbyterian Church.\r\n\r\n\"You'll find the best people there,\" he said; \"the aristocracy. The\r\nTreble Clef gives a concert, and everybody that's anybody will be\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nThey met again the following evening and proceeded to the church. It was\r\na simple but pleasant auditorium, nearly filled with well-dressed\r\npeople. During the programme Bles applauded vociferously every number\r\nthat pleased him, which is to say, every one--and stamped his feet,\r\nuntil he realized that he was attracting considerable attention to\r\nhimself. Then the entertainment straightway lost all its charm; he grew\r\npainfully embarrassed, and for the remainder of the evening was\r\nawkwardly self-conscious. When all was over, the audience rose leisurely\r\nand stood in little knots and eddies, laughing and talking; many moved\r\nforward to say a word to the singers and players, Stillings stepped\r\naside to a group of men, and Bles was left miserably alone. A man came\r\nto him, a white-faced man, with slightly curling close gray hair, and\r\nhigh-bred ascetic countenance.\r\n\r\n\"You are a stranger?\" he asked pleasantly, and Bles liked him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" he answered, and they fell to talking. He discovered that\r\nthis was the pastor of the church.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know no one in town?\"\r\n\r\n\"One or two of my fellow clerks and Mr. Stillings. Oh, yes, I've met\r\nMiss Wynn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, here is Miss Wynn now.\"\r\n\r\nBles turned. She was right behind him, the centre of a group. She\r\nturned, slowly, and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she uttered twice, but with difference cadence. Then something\r\nlike amusement lurked a moment in her eye, and she quietly presented\r\nBles to her friends, while Stillings hovered unnoticed in the offing:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Jones--Mr. Alwyn of--\" she paused a second--\"Alabama. Miss\r\nTaylor--Mr. Alwyn--and,\" with a backward curving of her neck, \"Mr.\r\nTeerswell,\" and so on. Mr. Teerswell was handsome and indolent, with\r\nindecision in his face and a cynical voice. In a moment Bles felt the\r\nsubtle antagonism of the group. He was an intruder. Mr. Teerswell nodded\r\neasily and turned away, continuing his conversation with the ladies.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Wynn was perverse and interrupted. \"I saw you enjoyed the\r\nconcert, Mr. Alwyn,\" she said, and one of the young ladies rippled\r\naudibly. Bles darkened painfully, realizing that these people must have\r\nbeen just behind him. But he answered frankly:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did immensely--I hope I didn't disturb you; you see, I'm not\r\nused to hearing such singing.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Teerswell, compelled to listen, laughed drily.\r\n\r\n\"Plantation melodies, I suppose, are more your specialty,\" he said with\r\na slight cadence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Bles simply. A slight pause ensued.\r\n\r\nThen came the surprise of the evening for Bles Alwyn. Even his\r\ninexperienced eye could discern that Miss Wynn was very popular, and\r\nthat most of the men were rivals for her attentions.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Alwyn,\" she said graciously, rising. \"I'm going to trouble you to\r\nsee me to my door; it's only a block. Good-night, all!\" she called, but\r\nshe bowed to Mr. Teerswell.\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn placed her hand lightly on Bles's arm, and for a moment he\r\npaused. A thrill ran through him as he felt again the weight of a little\r\nhand and saw beside him the dark beautiful eyes of a girl. He felt again\r\nthe warm quiver of her body. Then he awoke to the lighted church and the\r\nmoving, well-dressed throng. The hand on his arm was not so small; but\r\nit was well-gloved, and somehow the fancy struck him that it was a cold\r\nhand and not always sympathetic in its touch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty-three_\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING OF ZORA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I did not know the world was so large,\" remarked Zora as she and Mrs.\r\nVanderpool flew east and northward on the New York-New Orleans limited.\r\nFor a long time the girl had given herself up to the sheer delight of\r\nmotion. Gazing from the window, she compared the lands she passed with\r\nthe lands she knew: noting the formation of the cotton; the kind and\r\ngrowth of the trees; the state of the roads. Then the comparisons became\r\ninfinite, endless; the world stretched on and on until it seemed mere\r\ndistance, and she suddenly realized how vast a thing it was and spoke.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool was amused. \"It's much smaller than one would think,\"\r\nshe responded.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to Atlanta Zora stared and wrinkled her brows. It was her\r\nfirst large city. The other towns were replicas of Toomsville; strange\r\nin number, not in kind; but this was different, and she could not\r\nunderstand it. It seemed senseless and unreasonable, and yet so\r\nstrangely so that she was at a loss to ask questions. She was very\r\nsolemn as they rode on and night came down with dreams.\r\n\r\nShe awoke in Washington to new fairylands and wonders; the endless going\r\nand coming of men; great piles that challenged heaven, and homes crowded\r\non homes till one could not believe that they were full of living\r\nthings. They rolled by Baltimore and Philadelphia, and she talked of\r\nevery-day matters: of the sky which alone stood steadfast amid whirling\r\nchange; of bits of empty earth that shook themselves here and there\r\nloose from their burden of men, and lay naked in the cold shining\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nAll the while the greater questions were beating and curling and\r\nbuilding themselves back in her brain, and above all she was wondering\r\nwhy no one had told her before of all this mighty world. Mrs.\r\nVanderpool, to whom it seemed too familiar for comment, had said no\r\nword; or, if she had spoken, Zora's ears had not been tuned to\r\nunderstand; and as they flew toward the towering ramparts of New York,\r\nshe sat up big with the terror of a new thought: suppose this world were\r\nfull yet of things she did not know nor dream of? How could she find\r\nout? She must know.\r\n\r\nWhen finally they were settled in New York and sat high up on the Fifth\r\nAvenue front of the hotel, gradually the inarticulate questioning found\r\nwords, albeit strange ones.\r\n\r\n\"It reminds me of the swamp,\" she said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool, just returned from a shopping tour, burst into\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"It is--but I marvel at your penetration.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, it is moving--always moving.\"\r\n\r\n\"The swamp seemed to me unearthly still.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes,\" cried Zora, eagerly, brushing back the rumpled hair; \"and so\r\ndid the city, at first, to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still! New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You see, I saw the buildings and forgot the men; and the\r\nbuildings were so tall and silent against Heaven. And then I came to see\r\nthe people, and suddenly I knew the city was like the swamp, always\r\nrestless and changing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And more beautiful?\" suggested Mrs. Vanderpool, slipping her arms into\r\nher lounging-robe.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; not nearly so beautiful. And yet--more interesting.\" Then with\r\na puzzled look: \"I wonder why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps because it's people and not things.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's people in the swamp,\" asserted Zora, dreamily, smoothing out the\r\npillows of the couch, \"'little people,' I call them. The difference is,\r\nI think, that there I know how the story will come out; everything is\r\nchanging, but I know how and why and from what and to what. Now here,\r\n_every_thing seems to be happening; but what is it that is happening?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must know what has happened, to know what may happen,\" said Mrs.\r\nVanderpool.\r\n\r\n\"But how can I know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get you some books to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know what it means,\" wistfully.\r\n\r\n\"It is meaningless.\" The woman's cynicism was lost upon Zora, of course,\r\nbut it possessed the salutary effect of stimulating the girl's thoughts,\r\nencouraging her to discover for herself.\r\n\r\n\"I think not; so much must mean something,\" she protested.\r\n\r\nZora gathered up the clothes and things and shaded the windows, glancing\r\nthe while down on the street.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody is going, going,\" she murmured. \"I wonder where. Don't they\r\never get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Few arrive,\" said Mrs. Vanderpool. Zora softly bent and passed her cool\r\nsoft hand over her forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Then why do they go?\"\r\n\r\n\"The zest of the search, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Zora as she noiselessly left the room and closed the door;\r\n\"no, they are searching for something they have lost. Perhaps they, too,\r\nare searching for the Way,\" and the tears blinded her eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool lay in the quiet darkened room with a puzzled smile on\r\nher lips. A month ago she had not dreamed that human interest in anybody\r\nwould take so strong a hold upon her as her liking for Zora had done.\r\nShe was a woman of unusual personal charm, but her own interest and\r\naffections were seldom stirred. Had she been compelled to earn a living\r\nshe would have made a successful teacher or manipulator of men. As it\r\nwas, she viewed the human scene with detached and cynical interest. She\r\nhad no children, few near relations, a husband who went his way and\r\nstill was a gentleman.\r\n\r\nEssentially Mrs. Vanderpool was unmoral. She held the code of her social\r\nset with sportsmanlike honor; but even beyond this she stooped to no\r\nintrigue, because none interested her. She had all the elements of power\r\nsave the motive for doing anything in particular. For the first time,\r\nperhaps, Zora gave her life a peculiar human interest. She did not love\r\nthe girl, but she was intensely interested in her; some of the interest\r\nwas selfish, for Zora was going to be a perfect maid. The girl's\r\nlanguage came to be more and more like Mrs. Vanderpool's; her dress and\r\ntaste in adornment had been Mrs. Vanderpool's first care, and it led to\r\na curious training in art and sense of beauty until the lady now and\r\nthen found herself learner before the quick suggestiveness of Zora's\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Harry Cresswell called a month or so later the talk naturally\r\nincluded mention of Zora. Mary was happy and vivacious, and noted the\r\ngirl's rapid development.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what I shall make out of her?\" queried Mrs. Vanderpool. \"Do\r\nyou know, I believe I could mould her into a lady if she were not\r\nblack.\"\r\n\r\nMary Cresswell laughed. \"With that hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has artistic possibilities. You should have seen my hair-dresser's\r\nface when I told her to do it up. Her face and Zora's were a pantomime\r\nfor the gods. Yet it was done. It lay in some great twisted cloud and in\r\nthat black net gown of mine Zora was simply magnificent. Her form is\r\nperfect, her height is regal, her skin is satin, and my jewels found a\r\nresting place at last. Jewels, you know, dear, were never meant for\r\nwhite folk. I was tempted to take her to the box at the opera and let\r\nNew York break its impudent neck.\"\r\n\r\nMary was shocked.\r\n\r\n\"But, Mrs. Vanderpool,\" she protested, \"is it right? Is it fair? Why\r\nshould you spoil this black girl and put impossible ideas into her head?\r\nYou can make her a perfect maid, but she can never be much more in\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a perfect maid now; that's the miracle of it--she's that deft\r\nand quick and quiet and thoughtful! The hotel employees think her\r\nperfect; my friends rave--really, I'm the most blessed of women. But do\r\nyou know I like the girl? I--well, I think of her future.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's wrong to treat her as you do. You make her an equal. Her room is\r\none of the best and filled with books and bric-a-brac. She sometimes\r\neats with you--is your companion, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it? She loves to read, and I guide her while she keeps me up on\r\nthe latest stuff. She can talk much better than many of my friends and\r\nthen she piques my curiosity: she's a sort of intellectual sauce that\r\nstirs my rapidly failing mental appetite. I think that as soon as I can\r\nmake up my mind to spare her, I'll take her to France and marry her off\r\nin the colonies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's possible; but one doesn't easily give up good servants. By\r\nthe way, I learn from Miss Smith that the boy, Bles Alwyn, in whom Zora\r\nwas so interested, is a clerk in the Treasury Department at Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! I'm going to Washington this winter; I'll look him over and see\r\nif he's worth Zora--which I greatly doubt.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell pursed her lips and changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen the Easterlys?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ladies left their cards--they are quite impossible. Mr. Easterly\r\ncalls this afternoon. I can't imagine why, but he asked for an\r\nappointment. Will you go South with Mr. Cresswell? I'm glad to hear he's\r\nentering politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall do some early house hunting in Washington,\" said Mrs.\r\nCresswell, rising as Mr. Easterly was announced.\r\n\r\nMr. Easterly was not at home in Mrs. Vanderpool's presence. She spoke a\r\nlanguage different from his, and she had shown a disconcerting way, in\r\nthe few times when he had spoken with her, of letting the weight of the\r\nconversation rest on him. He felt very distinctly that Mrs. Vanderpool\r\nwas not particularly desirous of his company, nor that of his family.\r\nNevertheless, he needed Mrs. Vanderpool's influence just now, and he was\r\nwilling to pay considerable for it. Once under obligation to him her\r\nservices would be very valuable. He was glad to find Mrs. Cresswell\r\nthere. It showed that the Cresswells were still intimate, and the\r\nCresswells were bound to him and his interests by strong ties. He bowed\r\nas Mrs. Cresswell left, and then did not beat around the bush because,\r\nin this case, he did not know how.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Vanderpool, I need your aid.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool smiled politely, and murmured something.\r\n\r\n\"We are, you know, in the midst of a rather warm presidential campaign,\"\r\ncontinued Mr. Easterly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" with polite interest.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to win easily, but our majority in Congress for certain\r\nmatters will depend on the attitude of Southerners and you usually spend\r\nthe winters in Washington. If, now, you could drop a word here and\r\nthere--\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should I?\" asked Mrs. Vanderpool.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Vanderpool, to be frank, I know some excellent investments that\r\nyour influence in this line would help. I take it you're not so rich but\r\nthat--\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Mr. Easterly, I know little about such matters and care less. I\r\nhave food and clothes. Why worry with more?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Easterly half expected this and he determined to deliver his last\r\nshot on the run. He arose with a disappointed air.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Mrs. Vanderpool, I see how it is: you have plenty and one\r\ncan't expect your services or influence for nothing. It had occurred to\r\nme that your husband might like something political; but I presume not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something political?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You see, it's barely possible, for instance, that there will be a\r\nchange in the French ambassadorship. The present ambassador is old\r\nand--well, I don't know, but as I say, it's possible. Of course though,\r\nthat may not appeal to you, and I can only beg your good offices in\r\ncharity if--if you see your way to help us. Well, I must be going.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is--I thought the President appointed ambassadors.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, but we appoint Presidents,\" laughed Mr. Easterly.\r\n\"Good-day. I shall hope to see you in Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-day,\" Mrs. Vanderpool returned absently.\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone she walked slowly to Zora's room and opened the door.\r\nFor a long time she stood quietly looking in. Zora was curled in a chair\r\nwith a book. She was in dreamland; in a world of books builded\r\nthoughtfully for her by Mrs. Vanderpool, and before that by Miss Smith.\r\nHer work took but little of her time and left hours for reading and\r\nthinking. In that thought-life, more and more her real living centred.\r\n\r\nHour after hour, day after day, she lay buried, deaf and dumb to all\r\nelse. Her heart cried, up on the World's four corners of the Way, and to\r\nit came the Vision Splendid. She gossiped with old Herodotus across the\r\nearth to the black and blameless Ethiopians; she saw the sculptured\r\nglories of Phidias marbled amid the splendor of the swamp; she listened\r\nto Demosthenes and walked the Appian Way with Cornelia--while all New\r\nYork streamed beneath her window.\r\n\r\nShe saw the drunken Goths reel upon Rome and heard the careless Negroes\r\nyodle as they galloped to Toomsville. Paris, she knew,--wonderful,\r\nhaunting Paris: the Paris of Clovis, and St. Louis; of Louis the Great,\r\nand Napoleon III; of Balzac, and her own Dumas. She tasted the mud and\r\ncomfort of thick old London, and the while wept with Jeremiah and sang\r\nwith Deborah, Semiramis, and Atala. Mary of Scotland and Joan of Arc\r\nheld her dark hands in theirs, and Kings lifted up their sceptres.\r\n\r\nShe walked on worlds, and worlds of worlds, and heard there in her\r\nlittle room the tread of armies, the paeans of victory, the breaking of\r\nhearts, and the music of the spheres.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool watched her a while.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" she presently broke into the girl's absorption, \"how would you\r\nlike to be Ambassador to France?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty-four_\r\n\r\nTHE EDUCATION OF ALWYN\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Caroline Wynn of Washington had little faith in the world and its\r\npeople. Nor was this wholly her fault. The world had dealt cruelly with\r\nthe young dreams and youthful ambitions of the girl; partly with its\r\nusual heartlessness, partly with that cynical and deadening reserve fund\r\nwhich it has today for its darker peoples. The girl had bitterly\r\nresented her experiences at first: she was brilliant and well-trained;\r\nshe had a real talent for sculpture, and had studied considerably; she\r\nwas sprung from at least three generations of respectable mulattoes, who\r\nhad left a little competence which yielded her three or four hundred\r\ndollars a year. Furthermore, while not precisely pretty, she was\r\ngood-looking and interesting, and she had acquired the marks and\r\ninsignia of good breeding. Perhaps she wore her manners just a trifle\r\nconsciously; perhaps she was a little morbid that she would fail of\r\nrecognition as a lady. Nor was this unnatural: her brown skin invited a\r\ndifferent assumption. Despite this almost unconscious mental\r\naggressiveness, she was unusually presentable and always well-groomed\r\nand pleasant of speech. Yet she found nearly all careers closed to her.\r\nAt first it seemed accidental, the luck of life. Then she attributed it\r\nto her sex; but at last she was sure that, beyond chance and womanhood,\r\nit was the colorline that was hemming her in. Once convinced of this,\r\nshe let her imagination play and saw the line even where it did not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nWith her bit of property and brilliant parts she had had many suitors\r\nbut they had been refused one after another for reasons she could hardly\r\nhave explained. For years now Tom Teerswell had been her escort. Whether\r\nor not Caroline Wynn would every marry him was a perennial subject of\r\nspeculation among their friends and it usually ended in the verdict that\r\nshe could not afford it--that it was financially impossible.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the two were usually seen in public together, and although\r\nshe often showed her quiet mastery of the situation, seldom had she\r\nsnubbed him so openly as at the Treble Clef concert.\r\n\r\nTeerswell was furious and began to plot vengeance; but Miss Wynn was\r\nattracted by the personality of Bles Alwyn. Southern country Negroes\r\nwere rare in her set, but here was a man of intelligence and keenness\r\ncoupled with an amazing frankness and modesty, and perceptibly shadowed\r\nby sorrow. The combination was, so far as she had observed, both rare\r\nand temporary and she was disposed to watch it in this case purely as a\r\nmatter of intellectual curiosity. At the door of her home, therefore,\r\nafter a walk of unusual interest, she said:\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to have a few friends in next Tuesday night; won't you come,\r\nMr. Alwyn?\" And Mr. Alwyn said that he would.\r\n\r\nNext morning Miss Wynn rather repented her hasty invitation, but of\r\ncourse nothing could be done now. Nothing? Well, there was one thing;\r\nand she went to the telephone. A suggestion to Bles that he might\r\nprofitably extend his acquaintance sent him to a certain tailor shop\r\nkept by a friend of hers; a word to the tailor guarded against the least\r\nsuspicion of intrigue entering Bles's head.\r\n\r\nIt turned out quite as Miss Wynn had designed; Mr. Grey, the tailor,\r\ngave Bles some points on dressing, and made him, Southern fashion, a\r\nfrock-coat for dress wear that set off his fine figure. On the night of\r\nthe gathering at Miss Wynn's Bles dressed with care, hesitating long\r\nover a necktie, but at last choosing one which he had recently purchased\r\nand which pleased him particularly. He was prompt to the minute and was\r\nconsequently the first guest; but Miss Wynn's greeting was so quietly\r\ncordial that his embarrassment soon fled. She looked him over at leisure\r\nand sighed at his tie; otherwise he was thoroughly presentable according\r\nto the strictest Washington standard.\r\n\r\nThey sat down and talked of generalities. Then an idea occurring to her,\r\nshe conducted the conversation by devious paths to ties and asked Alwyn\r\nif he had heard of the fad of collecting ties. He had not, and she\r\nshowed him a sofa pillow.\r\n\r\n\"Your tie quite attracted me,\" she said; \"it would make just the dash of\r\ncolor I need in my new pillow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may have it and welcome. I'll send--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! A bird in the hand, you know. I'll trade with you now for\r\nanother I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done!\"\r\n\r\nThe exchange was soon made, Miss Wynn tying the new one herself and\r\nsticking a small carved pin in it. Bles slowly sat down again, and after\r\na pause said, \"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up quickly, but he seemed quite serious and good-natured.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he explained, \"in the country we don't know much about ties.\"\r\n\r\nThe well-balanced Miss Wynn for a moment lost her aplomb, but only for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\"We must all learn,\" she replied with penetration, and so their\r\nfriendship was established.\r\n\r\nThe company now began to gather, and soon the double parlor held an\r\nassemblage of twenty-five or thirty persons. They formed a picturesque\r\ngroup: conventional but graceful in dress; animated in movement; full of\r\ngood-natured laughter, but quite un-American in the beautiful modulation\r\nof their speaking tones; chiefly noticeable, however, to a stranger, in\r\nthe vast variety of color in skin, which imparted to the throng a\r\npiquant and unusual interest. Every color was here; from the dark brown\r\nof Alwyn, who was customarily accounted black, to the pale pink-white of\r\nMiss Jones, who could \"pass for white\" when she would, and found her\r\ngreatest difficulties when she was trying to \"pass\" for black. Midway\r\nbetween these two extremes lay the sallow pastor of the church, the\r\ncreamy Miss Williams, the golden yellow of Mr. Teerswell, the golden\r\nbrown of Miss Johnson, and the velvet brown of Mr. Grey. The guest\r\nthemselves did not notice this; they were used to asking one's color as\r\none asks of height and weight; it was simply an extra dimension in their\r\nworld whereby to classify men.\r\n\r\nBeyond this and their hair, there was little to distinguish them from a\r\nmodern group of men and women. The speech was a softened English, purely\r\nand, on the whole, correctly spoken--so much so that it seemed at first\r\nalmost unfamiliar to Bles, and he experienced again the uncomfortable\r\nfeeling of being among strangers. Then, too, he missed the loud but\r\nhearty good-nature of what he had always called \"his people.\" To be\r\nsure, a more experienced observer might have noted a lively, excitable\r\ntropical temperament set and cast in a cold Northern mould, and yet\r\nflashing fire now and then in a sudden anomalous out-bursting. But Bles\r\nmissed this; he seemed to have slipped and lost his bearings, and the\r\ncharacteristics of his simple world were rolling curiously about. Here\r\nstood a black man with a white man's voice, and yonder a white woman\r\nwith a Negro's musical cadences; and yet again, a brown girl with\r\nexactly Miss Cresswell's air, and yonder, Miss Williams, with Zora's\r\nwistful willfulness.\r\n\r\nBles was bewildered and silent, and his great undying sorrow sank on his\r\nheart with sickening hopeless weight. His hands got in the way and he\r\nfound no natural nook in all those wide and tastefully furnished rooms.\r\nOnce he discovered himself standing by a marble statue of a nude woman,\r\nand he edged away; then he stumbled over a rug and saved himself only to\r\nstep on Miss Jones's silken train. Miss Jones's smile of pardon was\r\nwintry. When he did approach a group and listen, they seemed speaking of\r\nthings foreign to him--usually of people he did not know, their homes,\r\ntheir doings, their daughters and their fathers. They seemed to know\r\npeople intimately who lived far away.\r\n\r\n\"You mean the Smiths of Boston?\" asked Miss Jones.\r\n\r\n\"No, of Cleveland. They're not related.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard that McGhee of St. Paul will be in the city next week with his\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the Bentleys of Chicago.\"\r\n\r\nBles passed on. He was disappointed. He was full of things to say, of\r\nmighty matters to discuss; he felt like stopping these people and\r\ncrying: \"Ho! What of the morning? How goes the great battle for black\r\nmen's rights? I have came with messages from the host, to you who guard\r\nthe mountain tops.\"\r\n\r\nApparently they were not discussing or caring about \"the Problem.\" He\r\ngrew disgusted and was edging toward the door when he encountered his\r\nhostess.\r\n\r\n\"Is all well with you, Mr. Alwyn?\" she asked lightly.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not enjoying myself,\" said Bles, truthfully.\r\n\r\n\"Delicious! And why not?\"\r\n\r\nHe regarded her earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"There are so many things to talk about,\" he said; \"earnest things;\r\nthings of importance. I--I think when our people--\" he hesitated.\r\nOur?--was _our_ right? But he went on: \"When our people meet we ought\r\nto talk of our situation, and what to do and--\"\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn continued to smile.\r\n\r\n\"We're all talking of it all the time,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe looked incredulous.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are,\" she insisted. \"We veil it a little, and laugh as lightly\r\nas we can; but there is only one thought in this room, and that's grave\r\nand serious enough to suit even you, and quite your daily topic.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, there's the rub. You haven't learned our language yet. We don't\r\njust blurt into the Negro Problem; that's voted bad form. We leave that\r\nto our white friends. We saunter to it sideways, touch it delicately\r\nbecause\"--her face became a little graver--\"because, you see, it hurts.\"\r\n\r\nBles stood thoughtful and abashed.\r\n\r\n\"I--I think I understand,\" he gravely said at last.\r\n\r\n\"Come here,\" she said with a sudden turn, and they joined an absorbed\r\ngroup in the midst of a conversation.\r\n\r\n\"--Thinking of sending Jessie to Bryn Mawr,\" Bles heard Miss Jones\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\"Could she pass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they might think her Spanish.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's a snobbish place and she would have to give up all her\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Freddie could scarcely visit--\" the rest was lost.\r\n\r\n\"Which, being interpreted,\" whispered Miss Wynn, \"means that Bryn Mawr\r\ndraws the color line while we at times surmount it.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved on to another group.\r\n\r\n\"--Splendid draughtsman,\" a man was saying, \"and passed at the head of\r\nthe crowd; but, of course, he has no chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's civil-service, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is. But what of that? There was Watson--\"\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn did not pause. She whispered: \"This is the tale of Civil\r\nService Reform, and how this mighty government gets rid of black men\r\nwho know too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" Bles tried to protest.\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" Miss Wynn commanded and they joined the group about the piano.\r\nTeerswell, who was speaking, affected not to notice them, and continued:\r\n\r\n\"--I tell you, it's got to come. We must act independently and not be\r\nbought by a few offices.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all well enough for you to talk, Teerswell; you have no wife and\r\nbabies dependant on you. Why should we who have sacrifice the substance\r\nfor the shadow?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, the Judge has got the substance,\" laughed Teerswell. \"Still I\r\ninsist: divide and conquer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Unite, and keep.\"\r\n\r\nBles was puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"They're talking of the coming campaign,\" said Miss Wynn.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Bles aloud. \"You don't mean that any one can advise a\r\nblack man to vote the Democratic ticket?\"\r\n\r\nAn elderly man turned to them.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" he said; \"that is just my attitude; I fought for my\r\nfreedom. I know what slavery is; may I forget God when I vote for\r\ntraitors and slave-holders.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion waxed warm and Miss Wynn turned away and sought Miss\r\nJones.\r\n\r\n\"Come, my dear,\" she said, \"it's 'The Problem' again.\" They sauntered\r\naway toward a ring of laughter.\r\n\r\nThe discussion thus begun at Miss Wynn's did not end there. It was on\r\nthe eve of the great party conventions, and the next night Sam Stillings\r\ncame around to get some crumbs from this assembly of the inner circle,\r\ninto which Alwyn had been so unaccountably snatched, and outside of\r\nwhich, despite his endeavors, Stillings lingered and seemed destined to\r\nlinger. But Stillings was a patient, resolute man beneath his\r\ndeferential exterior, and he saw in Bles a stepping stone. So he began\r\nto drop in at his lodgings and tonight invited him to the Bethel\r\nLiterary.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Bles.\r\n\r\n\"A debating club--oldest in the city; the best people all attend.\"\r\n\r\nBles hesitated. He had half made up his mind that this was the proper\r\ntime to call on Miss Wynn. He told Stillings so, and told him also of\r\nthe evening and the discussion.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's the subject up tonight,\" Stillings declared, \"and Miss Wynn\r\nwill be sure to be there. You can make your call later. Perhaps you\r\nwouldn't mind taking me when you call.\" Alwyn reached for his hat.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived, the basement of the great church was filling with a\r\nthrong of men and women. Soon the officers and the speaker of the\r\nevening appeared. The president was a brown woman who spoke easily and\r\nwell, and introduced the main speaker. He was a tall, thin,\r\nhatchet-faced black man, clean shaven and well dressed, a lawyer by\r\nprofession. His theme was \"The Democratic Party and the Negro.\" His\r\nargument was cool, carefully reasoned, and plausible. He was evidently\r\nfeeling for the sympathy of his audience, and while they were not\r\nenthusiastic, they warmed to him gradually and he certainly was strongly\r\nimpressing them.\r\n\r\nBles was thinking. He sat in the back of the hall, tense, alert,\r\nnervous. As the speaker progressed a white man came in and sat down\r\nbeside him. He was spectacled, with bushy eyebrows and a sleepy look.\r\nBut he did not sleep. He was very observant.\r\n\r\n\"Who's speaking?\" he asked Bles, and Bles told him. Then he inquired\r\nabout one or two other persons. Bles could not inform him, but Stillings\r\ncould and did. Stillings seemed willing to devote considerable time to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBles forgot the man. He was almost crouching for a spring, and no sooner\r\nhad the speaker, with a really fine apostrophe to independence and\r\nreason in voting, sat down, than Bles was on his feet, walking forward.\r\nHis form was commanding, his voice deep and musical, and his\r\nearnestness terribly evident. He hardly waited for recognition from the\r\nslightly astonished president, but fairly burst into speech.\r\n\r\n\"I am from Alabama,\" he began earnestly, \"and I know the Democratic\r\nParty.\" Then he told of government and conditions in the Black Belt, of\r\nthe lying, oppression, and helplessness of the sodden black masses;\r\nthen, turning, he reminded them of the history of slavery. Finally, he\r\npointed to Lincoln's picture and to Sumner's and mentioned other white\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"And, my brothers, they are not all dead yet. The gentleman spoke of\r\nSenator Smith and blamed and ridiculed him. I know Senator Smith but\r\nslightly, but I do know his sister well.\"\r\n\r\nDropping to simple narrative, he told of Miss Smith and of his coming to\r\nschool; and if his audience felt that great depth of emotion that welled\r\nbeneath his quiet, almost hesitating, address, it was not simply because\r\nof what he did say, but because, too, of the unspoken story that lay too\r\ndeep for words. He spoke for nearly an hour, and when he stopped, for a\r\nmoment his hearers sighed and then sprang into a whirlwind of applause.\r\nThey shouted, clapped, and waved while he sat in blank amazement, and\r\nwas with difficulty forced to the rostrum to bow again and again. The\r\nspectacled white man leaned over to Stillings.\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\" he asked. Stillings told him. The man noted the name and\r\nwent quietly out.\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn sat lost in thought, and Teerswell beside her fumed. She was\r\nnot easily moved, but that speech had moved her. If he could thus stir\r\nmen and not be himself swayed, she mused, he would be--invincible. But\r\ntonight he was moved as greatly as his hearers had been, and that was\r\ndangerous. If his intense belief happened to be popular, all right; but\r\nif not? She frowned. He was worth watching, she concluded; quite worth\r\nwatching, and perhaps worth guiding.\r\n\r\nWhen Alwyn accompanied her home that night, Miss Wynn set herself to\r\nknow him better for she suspected that he might be a coming man. The\r\nbest preliminary to her purpose was, she knew, to speak frankly of\r\nherself, and that she did. She told him of her youth and training, her\r\nambitions, her disappointments. Quite unconsciously her cynicism crept\r\nto the fore, until in word and tone she had almost scoffed at many\r\nthings that Alwyn held true and dear. The touch was too light, the\r\nmeaning too elusive, for Alwyn to grasp always the point of attack; but\r\nsomehow he got the distant impression that Miss Wynn had little faith in\r\nTruth and Goodness and Love. Vaguely shocked he grew so silent that she\r\nnoticed it and concluded she had said too much. But he pursued the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"Surely there must be many friends of our race willing to stand for the\r\nright and sacrifice for it?\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed unpleasantly, almost mockingly.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--there's Miss Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"She gets a salary, doesn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"A very small one.\"\r\n\r\n\"About as large as she could earn. North, I don't doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the unselfish work she does--the utter sacrifice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, we'll omit Alabama, and admit the exception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, here, in Washington--there's your friend, the Judge, who has\r\nbefriended you so, as you admit.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed again.\r\n\r\n\"You remember our visit to Senator Smith?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it got the Judge his reappointment to the school board.\"\r\n\r\n\"He deserved it, didn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I deserved it,\" she said luxuriously, hugging her knee and smiling;\r\n\"you see, his appointment meant mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what of it--didn't--\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" she cut in a little sharply. \"Once a young brown girl, with\r\nboundless faith in white folks, went to a Judge's office to ask for an\r\nappointment which she deserved. There was no one there. The benign old\r\nJudge with his saintly face and white hair suggested that she lay aside\r\nher wraps and spend the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nBles arose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"What--what did you do?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down--there's a good boy.\" I said: \"'Judge, a friend is expecting\r\nme at two,' it was then half-past one, 'would I not best telephone?'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Step right into the booth,' said the Judge, quite indulgently.\" Miss\r\nWynn leaned back, and Bles felt his heart sinking; but he said nothing.\r\n\"And then,\" she continued, \"I telephoned the Judge's wife that he was\r\nanxious to see her on a matter of urgent business; namely, my\r\nappointment.\" She gazed reflectively out of the window. \"You should have\r\nseen his face when I told him,\" she concluded. \"I was appointed.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bles asked coldly:\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you have him arrested?\"\r\n\r\n\"For what? And suppose I had?\"\r\n\r\nBles threw out his arms helplessly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it isn't as bad as that all over the world, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's worse,\" affirmed Miss Wynn, quietly positive.\r\n\r\n\"And you are still friendly with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you have? I use the world; I did not make it; I did not\r\nchoose it. He is the world. Through him I earn my bread and butter. I\r\nhave shown him his place. Shall I try in addition to reform? Shall I\r\nmake him an enemy? I have neither time nor inclination. Shall I resign\r\nand beg, or go tilting at windmills? If he were the only one it would be\r\ndifferent; but they're all alike.\" Her face grew hard. \"Have I shocked\r\nyou?\" she said as they went toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered slowly. \"But I still--believe in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are young yet, my friend,\" she lightly replied. \"And besides, that\r\ngood Miss Smith has gone and grafted a New England conscience on a\r\ntropical heart, and--dear me!--but it's a gorgeous misfit.\r\nGood-bye--come again.\" She bowed him graciously out, and paused to take\r\nthe mail from the box. There was, among many others, a letter from\r\nSenator Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty-five_\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Easterly sat in Mrs. Vanderpool's apartments in the New Willard,\r\nWashington, drinking tea. His hostess was saying rather carelessly:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Mr. Vanderpool has developed a quite unaccountable liking\r\nfor the idea of being Ambassador to France?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" mildly exclaimed Mr. Easterly, helping himself liberally to\r\ncakes. \"I do hope the thing can be managed, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"What are the difficulties?\" Mrs. Vanderpool interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Well, first and foremost, the difficulty of electing our man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that a foregone conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was. But do you know that we're encountering opposition from the\r\nmost unexpected source?\"\r\n\r\nThe lady was receptive, and the speaker concluded:\r\n\r\n\"The Negroes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Negroes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There are five hundred thousand or more black voters in pivotal\r\nNorthern States, you know, and they're in revolt. In a close election\r\nthe Negroes of New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois choose the\r\nPresident.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, business interests have driven our party to make friends with the\r\nSouth. The South has disfranchised Negroes and lynched a few. The\r\ndarkies say we've deserted them.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool laughed.\r\n\r\n\"What extraordinary penetration,\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate,\" said Mr. Easterly, drily, \"Mr. Vanderpool's first step\r\ntoward Paris lies in getting the Northern Negroes to vote the Republican\r\nticket. After that the way is clear.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool mused.\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose you know any one who is acquainted with any number of\r\nthese Northern darkies?\" continued Mr. Easterly.\r\n\r\n\"Not on my calling-list,\" said Mrs. Vanderpool, and then she added more\r\nthoughtfully:\r\n\r\n\"There's a young clerk in the Treasury Department named Alwyn who has\r\nbrains. He's just from the South, and I happened to read of him this\r\nmorning--see here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Easterly read an account of the speech at the Bethel Literary.\r\n\r\n\"We'll look this young man up,\" he decided; \"he may help. Of course,\r\nMrs. Vanderpool, we'll probably win; we can buy these Negroes off with a\r\nlittle money and a few small offices; then if you will use your\r\ninfluence for the part with the Southerners, I can confidently predict\r\nfrom four to eight years' sojourn in Paris.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool smiled and called her maid as Mr. Easterly went.\r\n\r\n\"Zora!\" She had to call twice, for Zora, with widened eyes, was reading\r\nthe Washington Post.\r\n\r\nMeantime in the office of Senator Smith, toward which Mr. Easterly was\r\nmaking his way, several members of the National Republican campaign\r\ncommittee had been closeted the day before.\r\n\r\n\"Now, about the niggers,\" the chairman had asked; \"how much more boodle\r\ndo they want?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what's bothering us,\" announced a member; \"it isn't the boodle\r\ncrowd that's hollering, but a new set, and I don't understand them; I\r\ndon't know what they represent, nor just how influential they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do to help you?\" asked Senator Smith.\r\n\r\n\"This. You are here at Washington with these Negro office-holders at\r\nyour back. Find out for us just what this revolt is, how far it goes,\r\nand what good men we can get to swing the darkies into line--see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" the Senator acquiesced. He called in a spectacled man with\r\nbushy eyebrows and a sleepy look.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to work the Negro political situation,\" directed the\r\nSenator, \"and bring me all the data you can get. Personally, I'm at sea.\r\nI don't understand the Negro of today at all; he puzzles me; he doesn't\r\nfit any of my categories, and I suspect that I don't fit his. See what\r\nyou can find out.\"\r\n\r\nThe man went out, and the Senator turned to his desk, then paused and\r\nsmiled. One day, not long since, he had met a colored person who\r\npersonified his perplexity concerning Negroes; she was a lady, yet she\r\nwas black--that is, brown; she was educated, even cultured, yet she\r\ntaught Negroes; she was quiet, astute, quick and diplomatic--everything,\r\nin fact, that \"Negroes\" were not supposed to be; and yet she was a\r\n\"Negro.\" She had given him valuable information which he had sought in\r\nvain elsewhere, and the event proved it correct. Suppose he asked\r\nCaroline Wynn to help him in this case? It would certainly do no harm\r\nand it might elect a Republican president. He wrote a short letter with\r\nhis own hand and sent it to post.\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn read the letter after Alwyn's departure with a distinct thrill\r\nwhich was something of a luxury for her. Evidently she was coming to\r\nher kingdom. The Republican boss was turning to her for confidential\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\"What do the colored people want, and who can best influence them in\r\nthis campaign?\"\r\n\r\nShe curled up on the ottoman and considered. The first part of the query\r\ndid not bother her.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever they want they won't get,\" she said decisively.\r\n\r\nBut as to the man or men who could influence them to believe that they\r\nwere getting, or about to get, what they wanted--there was a question.\r\nOne by one she considered the men she knew, and, by a process of\r\nelimination, finally arrived at Bles Alwyn.\r\n\r\nWhy not take this young man in hand and make a Negro leader of him--a\r\nprotagonist of ten millions? It would not be unpleasant. But could she\r\ndo it? Would he be amenable to her training and become worldly wise? She\r\nflattered herself that he would, and yet--there was a certain steadfast\r\nlook in the depths of his eyes that might prove to be sheer\r\nstubbornness. At any rate, who was better? There was a fellow,\r\nStillings, whom Alwyn had introduced and whom she had heard of. Now he\r\nwas a politician--but nothing else. She dismissed him. Of course,\r\nthere was the older set of office-holders and rounders. But she was\r\ndetermined to pick a new man. He was worth trying, at any rate; she knew\r\nnone other with the same build, the brains, the gifts, the adorable\r\nyouth. Very good. She wrote two letters, and then curled up to her novel\r\nand candy.\r\n\r\nNext day Senator Smith held Miss Wynn's letter unopened in his hand when\r\nMr. Easterly entered. They talked of the campaign and various matters,\r\nuntil at last Easterly said:\r\n\r\n\"Say, there's a Negro clerk in the Treasury named Alwyn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know him--I had him appointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. He may help us. Have you seen this?\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator read the clipping.\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't noticed it--but here's my agent.\"\r\n\r\nThe spectacled man entered with a mass of documents. He had papers,\r\nposters, programmes, and letters.\r\n\r\n\"The situation is this,\" he said. \"A small group of educated Negroes are\r\ntrying to induce the rest to punish the Republican Party for not\r\nprotecting them. These men are not politicians, nor popular leaders, but\r\nthey have influence and are using it. The old-style Negro politicians\r\nare no match for them, and the crowd of office-holders are rather\r\nbewildered. Strong measures are needed. Educated men of earnestness and\r\nability might stem the tide. And I believe I know one such man. He spoke\r\nat a big meeting last night at the Metropolitan church. His name is\r\nAlwyn.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Smith listened as he opened the letter from Caroline Wynn. Then\r\nhe started.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" he ejaculated, looking quickly up at Easterly. \"This is\r\npositively uncanny. From three separate sources the name of Alwyn pops\r\nup. Looks like a mascot. Call up the Treasury. Let's have him up when\r\nthe sub-committee meets to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nBles Alwyn hurried up to Senator Smith's office, hoping to hear\r\nsomething about the school; perhaps even about--but he stopped with a\r\nsigh, and sat down in the ante-room. He was kept waiting a few moments\r\nwhile Senator Smith, the chairman, and one other member of the\r\nsub-committee had a word.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I don't know the young man, mind you,\" said the Senator; \"but he's\r\nstrongly recommended.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we offer him?\" asked the chairman.\r\n\r\n\"Try him at twenty-five dollars a speech. If he balks, raise to fifty\r\ndollars, but no more.\"\r\n\r\nThey summoned the young man. The chairman produced cigars.\r\n\r\n\"I don't smoke,\" said Bles apologetically.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we haven't anything to drink,\" said the chairman. But Senator\r\nSmith broke in, taking up at once the paramount interest.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Alwyn, as you know, the Democrats are making an effort to get the\r\nNegro vote in this campaign. Now, I know the disadvantages and wrongs\r\nwhich black men in this land are suffering. I believe the Republicans\r\nought to do more to defend them, and I'm satisfied they will; but I\r\ndoubt if the way to get Negro rights is to vote for those who took them\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you perfectly,\" said Bles.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you do, and that you made an unusually fine speech on the\r\nsubject the other night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\" This was a good deal more than Bles had expected, and\r\nhe was embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, we think you're just the man to take the stump during\r\nSeptember and October and convince the colored people of their real\r\ninterests.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if I could, sir; I'm not a speaker. In fact, that was my first\r\npublic speech.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better. Are you willing to try?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, sir; but I could hardly afford to give up my position.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll arrange for a leave of absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll try, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you expect as pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose my salary would stop?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean in addition to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing, sir; I'd be glad to do the work.\"\r\n\r\nThe chairman nearly choked; sitting back, he eyed the young man. Either\r\nthey were dealing with a fool, or else a very astute politician. If the\r\nformer, how far could they trust him; if the latter, what was his game?\r\n\r\n\"Of course, there'll be considerable travelling,\" the chairman ventured,\r\nlooking reflectively out of the window.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might pay the railroad fare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir. When shall I begin?\"\r\n\r\nThe chairman consulted his calendar.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you hold yourself in readiness for one week from today.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" and Bles rose. \"Good-day, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nBut the chairman was still puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what's his game?\" he asked helplessly.\r\n\r\n\"He may be honest,\" offered Senator Smith, contemplating the door almost\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\nThe campaign progressed. The National Republican Committee said little\r\nabout the Negro revolt and affected to ignore it. The papers were\r\nsilent. Underneath this calm, however, the activity was redoubled. The\r\nprominent Negroes were carefully catalogued, written to, and put under\r\npersonal influence. The Negro papers were quietly subsidized, and they\r\nbegan to ridicule and reproach the new leaders.\r\n\r\nAs the Fall progressed, mass-meetings were held in Washington and the\r\nsmall towns. Larger and larger ones were projected, and more and more\r\nAlwyn was pushed to the front. He was developing into a most effective\r\nspeaker. He had the voice, the presence, the ideas, and above all he was\r\nintensely in earnest. There were other colored orators with voice,\r\npresence, and eloquence; but their people knew their record and\r\ndiscounted them. Alwyn was new, clear, and sincere, and the black folk\r\nhung on his words. Large and larger crowds greeted him until he was the\r\ncentral figure in a half dozen great negro mass-meetings in the chief\r\ncities of the country, culminating in New York the night before\r\nelection. Perhaps the secret newspaper work, the personal advice of\r\nemployers and friends, and the liberal distribution of cash, would have\r\ndelivered a large part of the Negro vote to the Republican candidate.\r\nPerhaps--but there was a doubt. With the work of Alwyn, however, all\r\ndoubt disappeared, and there was little reason for denying that the new\r\nPresident walked into the White House through the instrumentality of an\r\nunknown Georgia Negro, little past his majority. This is what Senator\r\nSmith said to Mr. Easterly; what Miss Wynn said to herself; and it was\r\nwhat Mrs. Vanderpool remarked to Zora as Zora was combing her hair on\r\nthe Wednesday after election.\r\n\r\nZora murmured an indistinct response. As already something of the beauty\r\nof the world had found question and answer in her soul, and as she began\r\nto realize how the world had waxed old in thought and stature, so now in\r\ntheir last days a sense of the power of men, as set over against the\r\nimmensity and force of their surroundings, became real to her. She had\r\nbegun to read of the lives and doing of those called great, and in her\r\nmind a plan was forming. She saw herself standing dim within the\r\nshadows, directing the growing power of a man: a man who would be great\r\nas the world counted greatness, rich, high in position,\r\npowerful--wonderful because his face was black. He would never see her;\r\nnever know how she worked and planned, save perhaps at last, in that\r\nsupreme moment as she passed, her soul would cry to his, \"Redeemed!\" And\r\nhe would understand.\r\n\r\nAll this she was thinking and weaving; not clearly and definitely, but\r\nin great blurred clouds of thought of things as she said slowly:\r\n\r\n\"He should have a great position for this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly,\" Mrs. Vanderpool agreed, and then curiously: \"What?\"\r\n\r\nZora considered. \"Negroes,\" she said, \"have been Registers of the\r\nTreasury, and Recorders of Deeds here in Washington, and Douglas was\r\nMarshal; but I want Bles--\" she paused and started again. \"Those are not\r\ngreat enough for Mr. Alwyn; he should have an office so important that\r\nNegroes would not think of leaving their party again.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool took pains to repeat Zora's words to Mr. Easterly. He\r\nconsidered the matter.\r\n\r\n\"In one sense, it's good advice,\" he admitted; \"but there's the South to\r\nreckon with. I'll think it over and speak to the President. Oh, yes; I'm\r\ngoing to mention France at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool smiled and leaned back in her carriage. She noted with\r\nconsiderable interest the young colored woman who was watching her from\r\nthe sidewalk: a brown, well-appearing young woman of notable\r\nself-possession. Caroline Wynn scrutinized Mrs. Vanderpool because she\r\nhad been speaking with Mr. Easterly, and Mr. Easterly was a figure of\r\npolitical importance. That very morning Miss Wynn had telegraphed Bles\r\nAlwyn. Alwyn arrived at Washington just as the morning papers heralded\r\nthe sweeping Republican victory. All about he met new deference and new\r\nfriends; strangers greeted him familiarly on the street; Sam Stillings\r\nbecame his shadow; and when he reported for work his chief and fellow\r\nclerks took unusual interest in him.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen Senator Smith yet?\" Miss Wynn asked after a few words of\r\ncongratulation.\r\n\r\n\"No. What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" she answered. \"Go to him today; don't fail. I shall be at\r\nhome at eight tonight.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Bles an exceedingly silly thing to do--calling on a busy\r\nman with no errand; but he went. He decided that he would just thank the\r\nSenator for his interest, and get out; or, if the Senator was busy, he\r\nwould merely send in his card. Evidently the Senator was busy, for his\r\nwaiting-room was full. Bles handed the card to the secretary with a word\r\nof apology, but the secretary detained him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Alwyn,\" he said affably; \"glad to see you. The Senator will\r\nwant to see you, I know. Wait just a minute.\" And soon Bles was shaking\r\nSenator Smith's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Alwyn,\" said the Senator heartily, \"you delivered the goods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir. I tried to.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Smith thoughtfully looked him over and drew out the letters.\r\n\r\n\"Your friends, Mr. Alwyn,\" he said, adjusting his glasses, \"have a\r\nrather high opinion of you. Here now is Stillings, who helped on the\r\ncampaign. He suggests an eighteen-hundred-dollar clerkship for you.\" The\r\nSenator glanced up keenly and omitted to state what Stillings suggested\r\nfor himself. Alwyn was visibly grateful as well as surprised.\r\n\r\n\"I--I hoped,\" he began hesitatingly, \"that perhaps I might get a\r\npromotion, but I had not thought of a first-class clerkship.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm.\" Senator Smith leaned back and twiddled his thumbs, staring at\r\nAlwyn until the hot blood darkened his cheeks. Then Bles sat up and\r\nstared politely but steadily back. The Senator's eyes dropped and he put\r\nout his hand for the second note.\r\n\r\n\"Now, your friend, Miss Wynn\"--Alwyn started--\"is even more ambitious.\"\r\nHe handed her letter to the young man, and pointed out the words.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Senator,\" Bles read, \"we expect Mr. Alwyn to be the next\r\nRegister of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nBles looked up in amazement, but the Senator reached for a third letter.\r\nThe room was very still. At last he found it. \"This,\" he announced\r\nquietly, \"is from a man of great power and influence, who has the ear of\r\nthe new President.\" He smoothed out the letter, paused briefly, then\r\nread aloud:\r\n\r\n\"'It has been suggested to me by'\"--the Senator did not read the name;\r\nif he had \"Mrs. Vanderpool\" would have meant little to Alwyn--\"'It has\r\nbeen suggested to me by blank that the future allegiance of the Negro\r\nvote to the Republican Party might be insured by giving to some\r\nprominent Negro a high political position--for instance, Treasurer of\r\nthe United States'--salary, six thousand dollars,\" interpolated Senator\r\nSmith--\"'and that Alwyn would be a popular and safe appointment for that\r\nposition.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator did not read the concluding sentence, which ran: \"Think this\r\nover; we can't touch political conditions in the South; perhaps this sop\r\nwill do.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time Alwyn sat motionless, while the Senator said nothing.\r\nThen the young man rose unsteadily.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I quite grasp all this,\" he said as he shook hands.\r\n\"I'll think it over,\" and he went out.\r\n\r\nWhen Caroline Wynn heard of that extraordinary conversation her\r\namazement knew no bounds. Yet Alwyn ventured to voice doubts:\r\n\r\n\"I'm not fitted for either of those high offices; there are many others\r\nwho deserve more, and I don't somehow like the idea of seeming to have\r\nworked hard in the campaign simply for money or fortune. You see, I\r\ntalked against that very thing.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn's eyes widened.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what else--\" she began and then changed. \"Mr. Alwyn, the line\r\nbetween virtue and foolishness is dim and wavering, and I should hate to\r\nsee you lost in that marshy borderland. By a streak of extraordinary\r\nluck you have gained the political leadership of Negroes in America.\r\nHere's your chance to lead your people, and here you stand blinking and\r\nhesitating. Be a man!\"\r\n\r\nAlwyn straightened up and felt his doubts going. The evening passed very\r\npleasantly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to have a little dinner for you,\" said Miss Wynn finally, and\r\nAlwyn grew hot with pleasure. He turned to her suddenly and said:\r\n\r\n\"Why, I'm rather--black.\" She expressed no surprise but said\r\nreflectively:\r\n\r\n\"You _are_ dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I've been given to understand that Miss Wynn and her set\r\nrather--well, preferred the lighter shades of colored folk.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn laughed lightly.\r\n\r\n\"My parents did,\" she said simply. \"No dark man ever entered their\r\nhouse; they were simply copying the white world. Now I, as a matter of\r\naesthetic beauty, prefer your brown-velvet color to a jaundiced yellow,\r\nor even an uncertain cream; but the world doesn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the world; and especially America. One may be Chinese, Spaniard,\r\neven Indian--anything white or dirty white in this land, and demand\r\ndecent treatment; but to be Negro or darkening toward it unmistakably\r\nmeans perpetual handicap and crucifixion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, then, admit that you draw the color-line?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I don't; but the world does. I am not prejudiced as my parents\r\nwere, but I am foresighted. Indeed, it is a deep ethical query, is it\r\nnot, how far one has the right to bear black children to the world in\r\nthe Land of the Free and the home of the brave. Is it fair--to the\r\nchildren?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is!\" he cried vehemently. \"The more to take up the fight, the\r\nsurer the victory.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed at his earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"You are refreshing,\" she said. \"Well, we'll dine next Tuesday, and\r\nwe'll have the cream of our world to meet you.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew that this was a great triumph. It flattered his vanity. After\r\nall, he was entering this higher dark world whose existence had piqued\r\nand puzzled him so long. He glanced at Miss Wynn beside him there in the\r\ndimly lighted parlor: she looked so aloof and unapproachable, so\r\nhandsome and so elegant. He thought how she would complete a house--such\r\na home as his prospective four or six thousand dollars a year could\r\neasily purchase. She saw him surveying her, and she smiled at him.\r\n\r\n\"I find but one fault with you,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe stammered for a pretty speech, but did not find it before she\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"Yes--you are so delightfully primitive; you will not use the world as\r\nit is but insist on acting as if it were something else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is the wife of my Judge: she is a fact in my world; in\r\nyours she is a problem to be stated, straightened, and solved. If she\r\nhad come to you, as she did to me yesterday, with her theory that all\r\nthat Southern Negroes needed was to learn how to make good servants and\r\nlay brick--\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have shown her--\" Bles tried to interject.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the sort. You would have tried to show her and would have\r\nfailed miserably. She hasn't learned anything in twenty years.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely you didn't join her in advocating that ten million people be\r\nmenials?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; I simply listened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there was no harm in that; I believe in silence at times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but I did not listen like a log, but positively and eloquently;\r\nwith a nod, a half-formed word, a comment begun, which she finished.\"\r\n\r\nBles frowned.\r\n\r\n\"As a result,\" continued Miss Wynn, \"I have a check for five hundred\r\ndollars to finish our cooking-school and buy a cast of Minerva for the\r\nassembly-room. More than that, I have now a wealthy friend. She thinks\r\nme an unusually clever person who, by a process of thought not unlike\r\nher own, has arrived at very similar conclusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but,\" objected Bles, \"if the time spent cajoling fools were used\r\nin convincing the honest and upright, think how much we would gain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little. The honest and upright are a sad minority. Most of these\r\nwhite folk--believe me, boy,\" she said caressingly,--\"are fools and\r\nknaves: they don't want truth or progress; they want to keep niggers\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it; there are scores, thousands, perhaps millions such,\r\nI admit; but the average American loves justice and right, and he is the\r\none to whom I appeal with frankness and truth. Great heavens! don't you\r\nlove to be frank and open?\"\r\n\r\nShe narrowed her eyelids.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sometimes I do; once I was; but it's a luxury few of us Negroes\r\ncan afford. Then, too, I insist that it's jolly to fool them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you hate the deception?\"\r\n\r\nShe chuckled and put her head to one side.\r\n\r\n\"At first I did; but, do you know, now I believe I prefer it.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked so horrified that she burst out laughing. He laughed too. She\r\nwas a puzzle to him. He kept thinking what a mistress of a mansion she\r\nwould make.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say these things?\" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Because I want you to do well here in Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"General philanthropy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, special.\" Her eyes were bright with meaning.\r\n\r\n\"Then you care--for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHe bent forward and cast the die.\r\n\r\n\"Enough to marry me?\"\r\n\r\nShe answered very calmly and certainly:\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned toward her. And then between him and her lips a dark and\r\nshadowy face; two great storm-swept eyes looked into his out of a world\r\nof infinite pain, and he dropped his head in hesitation and shame, and\r\nkissed her hand. Miss Wynn thought him delightfully bashful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty-six_\r\n\r\nCONGRESSMAN CRESSWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe election of Harry Cresswell to Congress was a very simple matter.\r\nThe Colonel and his son drove to town and consulted the Judge; together\r\nthey summoned the sheriff and the local member of the State legislature.\r\n\r\n\"I think it's about time that we Cresswells asked for a little of the\r\npolitical pie,\" the Colonel smilingly opened.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you want?\" asked the Judge.\r\n\r\n\"Harry wants to go to Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe Judge hesitated. \"We'd half promised that to Caldwell,\" he objected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It will be a little costly this year, too,\" suggested the sheriff,\r\ntentatively.\r\n\r\n\"About how much?\" asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"At least five thousand,\" said the Legislator.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel said nothing. He simply wrote a check and the matter was\r\nsettled. In the Fall Harry Cresswell was declared elected. There were\r\nfour hundred and seventy-two votes cast but the sheriff added a cipher.\r\nHe said it would look better.\r\n\r\nEarly December found the Cresswells domiciled in a small house in Du\r\nPont Circle, Washington. They had an automobile and four servants, and\r\nthe house was furnished luxuriously. Mary Taylor Cresswell, standing in\r\nher morning room and looking out on the flowers of the square, told\r\nherself that few people in the world had cause to be as happy as she.\r\nShe was tastefully gowned, in a way to set off her blonde beauty and her\r\ndelicate rounded figure. She was surrounded with wealth, and above all,\r\nshe was in that atmosphere of aristocracy for which she had always\r\nyearned; and already she was acquiring that poise of the head, and a\r\nmanner of directing the servants, which showed her born to the purple.\r\n\r\nShe had cause to be extremely happy, she told herself this morning, and\r\nyet she was puzzled to understand why she was not. Why was she restless\r\nand vaguely ill at ease so often these days?\r\n\r\nOne matter, indeed, did worry her; but that would right itself in time,\r\nshe was sure. She had always pictured herself as directing her husband's\r\nwork. She did not plan to step in and demand a share; she knew from\r\nexperience with her brother that a woman must prove her usefulness to a\r\nman before he will admit it, and even then he may be silent. She\r\nintended gradually and tactfully to relieve her husband of care\r\nconnected with his public life so that, before he realized it, she would\r\nbe his guiding spirit and his inspiration. She had dreamed the details\r\nof doing this so long that it seemed already done, and she could imagine\r\nno obstacle to its realization. And yet she found herself today no\r\nnearer her goal than when first she married. Not because Mr. Cresswell\r\ndid not share his work, but because, apparently, he had no work, no\r\nduties, no cares. At first, in the dim glories of the honeymoon, this\r\nseemed but part of his delicate courtesy toward her, and it pleased her\r\ndespite her thrifty New England nature; but now that they were settled\r\nin Washington, the election over and Congress in session, it really\r\nseemed time for Work and Life to begin in dead earnest, and New England\r\nMary was dreaming mighty dreams and golden futures.\r\n\r\nBut Harry apparently was as content as ever with doing nothing. He arose\r\nat ten, dined at seven, and went to bed between midnight and sunrise.\r\nThere was some committee meetings and much mail, but Mary was admitted\r\nto knowledge of none of these. The obvious step, of course, would be to\r\nset him at work; but from this undertaking Mary unconsciously recoiled.\r\nShe had already recognized that while her tastes and her husband's were\r\nmostly alike, they were also strikingly different in many respects. They\r\nagreed in the daintiness of things, the elegance of detail; but they did\r\nnot agree always as to the things themselves. Given the picture, they\r\nwould choose the same frame--but they would not choose the same picture.\r\nThey liked the same voice, but not the same song; the same company, but\r\nnot the same conversation. Of course, Mary reflected, frowning at the\r\nflowers--of course, this must always be so when two human beings are\r\nthrown into new and intimate association. In time they would grow to\r\nsweet communion; only, she hoped the communion would be on tastes nearer\r\nhers than those he sometimes manifested.\r\n\r\nShe turned impatiently from the window with a feeling of loneliness. But\r\nwhy lonely? She idly fingered a new book on the table and then put it\r\ndown sharply. There had been several attempts at reading aloud between\r\nthem some evenings ago, and this book reminded her of them. She had\r\nbought Jane Addams' \"Newer Ideals of Peace,\" and he had yawned over it\r\nundisguisedly. Then he had brought this novel, and--well, she had balked\r\nat the second chapter, and he had kissed her and called her his \"little\r\nprude.\" She did not want to be a prude; she hated to seem so, and had\r\nfor some time prided herself on emancipation from narrow New England\r\nprejudices. For example, she had not objected to wine at dinner; it had\r\nseemed indeed rather fine, imparting, as it did, an old-fashioned\r\nflavor; but she did not like the whiskey, and Harry at times appeared to\r\nbecome just a bit too lively--nothing excessive, of course, but his eyes\r\nand the smell and the color were a little too suggestive. And yet he was\r\nso kind and good, and when he came in at evening he bent so gallantly\r\nfor his kiss, and laid fresh flowers before her: could anything have\r\nbeen more thoughtful and knightly?\r\n\r\nJust here again she was puzzled; with her folk, hard work and inflexible\r\nduty were of prime importance; they were the rock foundation; and she\r\nsomehow had always counted on the courtesies of life as added to them,\r\nmaking them sweet and beautiful. But in this world, not perhaps so much\r\nwith Harry as with others of his set, the depths beneath the gravely\r\ninclined head, the deferential smile and ceremonious action, the light\r\nclever converse, had sounded strangely hollow once or twice when she had\r\nessayed to sound them, and a certain fear to look and see possessed her.\r\n\r\nThe bell rang, and she was a little startled at the fright that struck\r\nher heart. She did not analyze it. In reality--pride forbade her to\r\nadmit it--she feared it was a call of some of Harry's friends: some\r\nlanguid, assured Southern ladies, perilously gowned, with veiled disdain\r\nfor this interloping Northerner and her strong mind. Especially was\r\nthere one from New Orleans, tall and dark--\r\n\r\nBut it was no caller. It was simply some one named Stillings to see Mr.\r\nCresswell. She went down to see him--he might be a constituent--and\r\nfound a smirky brown man, very apologetic.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know me--does you, Mrs. Cresswell?\" said Stillings. He knew\r\nwhen it was diplomatic to forget his grammar and assume his dialect.\r\n\r\n\"Why--no.\"\r\n\r\n\"You remember I worked for Mr. Harry and served you-all lunch one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--why, yes! I remember now very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wants to see Mr. Harry very much; could I wait in the back\r\nhall?\"\r\n\r\nMary started to have him wait in the front hall, but she thought better\r\nof it and had him shown back. Less than an hour later her husband\r\nentered and she went quickly to him. He looked worn and white and tired,\r\nbut he laughed her concern lightly off.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be in earlier tonight,\" he declared.\r\n\r\n\"Is the Congressional business very heavy?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed so hilariously that she felt uncomfortable, which he\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" he answered deftly; \"not very.\" And as they moved toward the\r\ndining-room Mary changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she exclaimed, suddenly remembering. \"There is a man--a colored\r\nman--waiting to see you in the back hall, but I guess he can wait until\r\nafter lunch.\"\r\n\r\nThey ate leisurely.\r\n\r\n\"There's going to be racing out at the park this evening,\" said Harry.\r\n\"Want to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going to hear an art lecture at the Club,\" Mary returned, and\r\ngrew thoughtful; for here walked her ghost again. Of course, the Club\r\nwas an affair with more of gossip than of intellectual effort, but\r\ntoday, largely through her own suggestion, an art teacher of European\r\nreputation was going to lecture, and Mary preferred it to the company of\r\nthe race track. And--just as certainly--her husband didn't.\r\n\r\n\"Don't forget the man, dear,\" she reminded him; but he was buried in his\r\npaper, frowning.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that,\" he said finally. She glanced at the\r\nhead-lines--\"Prominent Negro Politician Candidate for High Office at\r\nHands of New Administration. B. Alwyn of Alabama.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Bles!\" she said, her face lighting as his darkened.\r\n\r\n\"An impudent Negro,\" he voiced his disgust. \"If they must appoint\r\ndarkies why can't they get tractable ones like my nigger Stillings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stillings?\" she repeated. \"Why, he's the man that's waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam, is it? Used to be one of our servants--you remember? Wants to\r\nborrow more money, I presume.\" He went down-stairs, after first helping\r\nhimself to a glass of whiskey, and then gallantly kissing his wife. Mrs.\r\nCresswell was more unsatisfied than usual. She could not help feeling\r\nthat Mr. Cresswell was treating her about as he treated his wine--as an\r\nindulgence; a loved one, a regular one, but somehow not as the reality\r\nand prose of life, unless--she started at the thought--his life was all\r\nindulgence. Having nothing else to do, she went out and paraded the\r\nstreets, watching the people who were happy enough to be busy.\r\n\r\nCresswell and Stillings had a long conference, and when Stillings\r\nhastened away he could not forbear cutting a discreet pigeon-wing as he\r\nrounded the corner. He had been promised the backing of the whole\r\nSouthern delegation in his schemes.\r\n\r\nThat night Teerswell called on him in his modest lodgings, where over\r\nhot whiskey and water they talked.\r\n\r\n\"The damned Southern upstart,\" growled Teerswell, forgetting Stillings'\r\nbirth-place. \"Do you mean to say he's actually slated for the place?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's sure of it, unless something turns up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, who'd have dreamed it?\" Teerswell mixed another stiff dram.\r\n\r\n\"And that isn't all,\" came Sam Stillings' unctuous voice.\r\n\r\nTeerswell glanced at him. \"What else?\" he asked, pausing with the\r\nsteaming drink poised aloft.\r\n\r\n\"If I'm not mistaken, Alwyn intends to marry Miss Wynn.\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie!\" the other suddenly yelled with an oath, overturning his\r\ntumbler and striding across the floor. \"Do you suppose she'd look at\r\nthat black--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, see here,\" said the astute Stillings, checking the details upon\r\nhis fingers. \"They visit Senator Smith's together; he takes her home\r\nfrom the Treble Clef; they say he talked to nobody else at her party;\r\nshe recommends him for the campaign--\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" Teerswell again exploded. But Stillings continued smoothly:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have ways of finding things out. She corresponds with him during\r\nthe campaign; she asks Smith to make him Register; and he calls on her\r\nevery night.\"\r\n\r\nTeerswell sat down limply.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he groaned. \"It's all up. She's jilted me--and I--and I--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see as it's all up yet,\" Stillings tried to reassure him.\r\n\r\n\"But didn't you say they were engaged?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they are; but--well, you know Carrie Wynn better than I do:\r\nsuppose, now--suppose he should lose the appointment?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you say that's sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless something turns up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what _can_ turn up?\"\r\n\r\n\"We might turn something.\"\r\n\r\n\"What--what--I tell you man, I'd--I'd do anything to down that nigger. I\r\nhate him. If you'll help me I'll do anything for you.\"\r\n\r\nStillings arose and carefully opening the hall door peered out. Then he\r\ncame back and, seating himself close to Teerswell, pushed aside the\r\nwhiskey.\r\n\r\n\"Teerswell,\" he whispered, \"you know I was working to be Register of the\r\nTreasury. Well, now, when the scheme of making Alwyn Treasurer came up\r\nthey determined to appoint a Southern white Republican and give me a\r\nplace under Alwyn. Now, if Alwyn fails to land I've got no chance for\r\nthe bigger place, but I've got a good chance to be Register according to\r\nthe first plan. I helped in the campaign; I've got the Negro secret\r\nsocieties backing me and--I don't mind telling you--the solid Southern\r\nCongressional delegation. I'm trying now ostensibly for a\r\nchief-clerkship under Bles, and I'm pretty sure of it: it pays\r\ntwenty-five hundred. See here: if we can make Bles do some fool talking\r\nand get it into the papers, he'll be ditched, and I'll be Register.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great!\" shouted Teerswell.\r\n\r\n\"Wait--wait. Now, if I get the job, how would you like to be my\r\nassistant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like it? Why, great Jehoshaphat! I'd marry Carrie--but how can I help\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"This way. I want to be better known among influential Negroes. You\r\nintroduce me and let me make myself solid. Especially I must get in Miss\r\nWynn's set so that both of us can watch her and Alwyn, and make her\r\nfriends ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it--shake!\" And Stillings put his oily hand into Teerswell's\r\nnervous grip.\r\n\r\n\"Now, here,\" Stillings went on, \"you stow all that jealousy and heavy\r\ntragedy. Treat Alwyn well and call on Miss Wynn as usual--see?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a hard pill--but all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave the rest to me; I'm hand in glove with Alwyn. I'll put stuff into\r\nhim that'll make him wave the bloody shirt at the next meeting of the\r\nBethel Literary--see? Then I'll go to Cresswell and say, 'Dangerous\r\nnigger--, just as I told you.' He'll begin to move things. You see?\r\nCresswell is in with Smith--both directors in the big Cotton\r\nCombine--and Smith will call Alwyn down. Then we'll think further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stillings, you look like a fool, but you're a genius.\" And Teerswell\r\nfairly hugged him. A few more details settled, and some more whiskey\r\nconsumed, and Teerswell went home at midnight in high spirits. Stillings\r\nlooked into the glass and scowled.\r\n\r\n\"Look like a fool, do I?\" he mused. \"Well, I ain't!\"\r\n\r\nCongressman Cresswell was stirred to his first political activity by the\r\nhint given him through Stillings. He not only had a strong personal\r\ndislike for Alwyn, but he regarded the promise to him of a high office\r\nas a menace to the South.\r\n\r\nThe second speech which Alwyn made at the Bethel Literary was, as\r\nStillings foresaw, a reply to the stinging criticisms of certain colored\r\npapers engineered by Teerswell, who said that Alwyn had been bribed to\r\nremain loyal to the Republicans by a six thousand dollar office. Alwyn\r\nhad been cut to the quick, and his reply was a straight out defence of\r\nNegro rights and a call to the Republican Party to redeem its pledges.\r\n\r\nCaroline Wynn, seeing the rocks for which her political craft was\r\nheaded, adroitly steered several newspaper reports into the waste\r\nbasket, but Stillings saw to it that a circumstantial account was in the\r\n_Colored American_, and that a copy of this paper was in Congressman\r\nCresswell's hands. Cresswell lost no time in calling on Senator Smith\r\nand pointing out to him that Bles Alwyn was a dangerous Negro: seeking\r\nsocial equality, hating white people, and scheming to make trouble. He\r\nwas too young and heady. It would be fatal to give such a man office and\r\ninfluence; fatal for the development of the South, and bad for the\r\nCotton Combine.\r\n\r\nSenator Smith was unconvinced. Alwyn struck him as a well-balanced\r\nfellow, and he thought he deserved the office. He would, however, warn\r\nhim to make no further speeches like that of last night. Cresswell\r\nmentioned Stillings as a good, inoffensive Negro who knew his place and\r\ncould be kept track of.\r\n\r\n\"Stillings is a good man,\" admitted Smith; \"but Alwyn is better.\r\nHowever, I'll bear what you say in mind.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell found Mr. Easterly in Mrs. Vanderpool's parlor, and that\r\ngentleman was annoyed at the news.\r\n\r\n\"I especially picked out this Alwyn because he was Southern and\r\ntractable, and seemed to have sense enough to know how to say well what\r\nwe wanted to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"When, as a matter of fact,\" drawled Mrs. Vanderpool, \"he was simply\r\nhonest.\"\r\n\r\n\"The South won't stand it,\" Cresswell decisively affirmed.\r\n\r\n\"Well--\" began Mr. Easterly.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" interrupted Mrs. Vanderpool. \"I'm interested in Alwyn; in\r\nfact, an honest man in politics, even if he is black, piques my\r\ncuriosity. Give him a chance and I'll warrant he'll develop all the\r\ndesirable traits of a first class office-holder.\"\r\n\r\nEasterly hesitated. \"We must not offend the South, and we must placate\r\nthe Negroes,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"The right sort of Negro--one like Stillings--appointed to a reasonable\r\nposition, would do both,\" opined Cresswell.\r\n\r\n\"It evidently didn't,\" Mrs. Vanderpool interjected.\r\n\r\nCresswell arose. \"I tell you, Mr. Easterly, I object--it mustn't go\r\nthrough.\" He took his leave.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool did not readily give up her plea for Alwyn, and bade\r\nZora get Mr. Smith on the telephone for discussion.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" reported Easterly, hanging up the receiver, \"we may land him. It\r\nseems that he is engaged to a Washington school-teacher, and Smith says\r\nshe has him well in hand. She's a pretty shrewd proposition, and\r\nunderstands that Alwyn's only chance now lies in keeping his mouth shut.\r\nWe may land him,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Engaged!\" gasped Mrs. Vanderpool.\r\n\r\nZora quietly closed the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty-seven_\r\n\r\nTHE VISION OF ZORA\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Zora found the little church she never knew; but somehow, in the\r\nlong dark wanderings which she had fallen into the habit of taking at\r\nnightfall, she stood one evening before it. It looked warm, and she was\r\ncold. It was full of her people, and she was very, very lonely. She sat\r\nin a back seat, and saw with unseeing eyes. She said again, as she had\r\nsaid to herself a hundred times, that it was all right and just what she\r\nhad expected. What else could she have dreamed? That he should ever\r\nmarry her was beyond possibility; that had been settled long\r\nsince--there where the tall, dark pines, wan with the shades of evening,\r\ncast their haunting shadows across the Silver Fleece and half hid the\r\nblood-washed west. After _that_ he would marry some one else, of course;\r\nsome good and pure woman who would help and uplift and serve him.\r\n\r\nShe had dreamed that she would help--unknown, unseen--and perhaps she\r\nhad helped a little through Mrs. Vanderpool. It was all right, and yet\r\nwhy so suddenly had the threads of life let go? Why was she drifting in\r\nvast waters; in uncharted wastes of sea? Why was the puzzle of life\r\nsuddenly so intricate when but a little week ago she was reading it, and\r\nits beauty and wisdom and power were thrilling her delighted hands?\r\nCould it be possible that all unconsciously she had dared dream a\r\nforbidden dream? No, she had always rejected it. When no one else had\r\nthe right; when no one thought; when no one cared, she had hovered over\r\nhis soul as some dark guardian angel; but now, now somebody else was\r\nreceiving his gratitude. It was all right, she supposed; but she, the\r\noutcast child of the swamp, what was there for her to do in the great\r\nworld--her, the burden of whose sin--\r\n\r\nBut then came the voice of the preacher: _\"Behold the Lamb of God, that\r\ntaketh away the sin of the world_.\"\r\n\r\nShe found herself all at once intently listening. She had been to church\r\nmany times before, but under the sermons and ceremonies she had always\r\nsat coldly inert. In the South the cries, contortions, and religious\r\nfrenzy left her mind untouched; she did not laugh or mock, she simply\r\nsat and watched and wondered. At the North, in the white churches, she\r\nenjoyed the beauty of wall, windows, and hymn, liked the voice and\r\nsurplice of the preacher; but his words had no reference to anything in\r\nwhich she was interested. Here suddenly came an earnest voice addressed,\r\nby singular chance, to her of all the world.\r\n\r\nShe listened, bending forward, her eyes glued to the speaker's lips and\r\nletting no word drop. He had the build and look of the fanatic: thin to\r\nemancipation; brown; brilliant-eyed; his words snapped in nervous energy\r\nand rang in awful earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"Life is sin, and sin is sorrow. Sorrow is born of selfishness and\r\nself-seeking--our own good, our own happiness, our own glory. As if any\r\none of us were worth a life! No, never. A single self as an end is, and\r\nought to be, disappointment; it is too low; it is nothing. Only in a\r\nwhole world of selves, infinite, endless, eternal world on worlds of\r\nselves--only in their vast good is true salvation. The good of others\r\nis our true good; work for others; not for your salvation, but the\r\nsalvation of the world.\" The audience gave a low uneasy groan and the\r\nminister in whose pulpit the stranger preached stirred uneasily. But he\r\nwent on tensely, with flying words:\r\n\r\n\"Unselfishness is sacrifice--Jesus was supreme sacrifice.\" (\"Amen,\"\r\nscreamed a voice.) \"In your dark lives,\" he cried, \"_who_ is the King of\r\nGlory? Sacrifice. Lift up your heads, then, ye gates of prejudice and\r\nhate, and let the King of Glory come in. Forget yourselves and your\r\npetty wants, and behold your starving people. The wail of black millions\r\nsweeps the air--east and west they cry, Help! Help! Are you dumb? Are\r\nyou blind? Do you dance and laugh, and hear and see not? The cry of\r\ndeath is in the air; they murder, burn, and maim us!\" (\"Oh--oh--\" moaned\r\nthe people swaying in their seats.) \"When we cry they mock us; they ruin\r\nour women and debauch our children--what shall we do?\r\n\r\n\"Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away sin. Behold the Supreme\r\nSacrifice that makes us clean. Give up your pleasures; give up your\r\nwants; give up all to the weak and wretched of our people. Go down to\r\nPharaoh and smite him in God's name. Go down to the South where we\r\nwrithe. Strive--work--build--hew--lead--inspire! God calls. Will you\r\nhear? Come to Jesus. The harvest is waiting. Who will cry: 'Here am I,\r\nsend me!'\"\r\n\r\nZora rose and walked up the aisle; she knelt before the altar and\r\nanswered the call: \"Here am I--send me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then she walked out. Above her sailed the same great stars; around\r\nher hummed the same hoarse city; but within her soul sang some new song\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Zora?\" Mrs. Vanderpool inquired, for she seemed to\r\nsee in the girl's face and carriage some subtle change; something that\r\nseemed to tell how out of the dream had stepped the dreamer into the\r\nrealness of things; how suddenly the seeker saw; how to the wanderer,\r\nthe Way was opened.\r\n\r\nJust how she sensed this Mrs. Vanderpool could not have explained, nor\r\ncould Zora. Was there a change, sudden, cataclysmic? No. There were to\r\ncome in future days all the old doubts and shiverings, the old restless\r\ncry: \"It is all right--all right!\" But more and more, above the doubt\r\nand beyond the unrest, rose the great end, the mighty ideal, that\r\nflickered and wavered, but ever grew and waxed strong, until it became\r\npossible, and through it all things else were possible. Thus from the\r\ngrave of youth and love, amid the soft, low singing of dark and bowed\r\nworshippers, the Angel of the Resurrection rolled away the stone.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Zora?\" Mrs. Vanderpool repeated.\r\n\r\nZora looked up, almost happily--standing poised on her feet as if to\r\ntell of strength and purpose.\r\n\r\n\"I have found the Way,\" she cried joyously.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool gave her a long searching look.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been?\" she asked. \"I've been waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry--but I've been--converted.\" And she told her story.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw, Zora!\" Mrs. Vanderpool uttered impatiently. \"He's a fakir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Zora serenely and quietly; \"but he brought the Word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zora, don't talk cant; it isn't worthy of your intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was more than intelligent--it was true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zora--listen, child! You were wrought up tonight, nervous--wild. You\r\nwere happy to meet your people, and where he said one word you supplied\r\ntwo. What you attribute to him is the voice of your own soul.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zora merely smiled. \"All you say may be true. But what does it\r\nmatter? I know one thing, like the man in the Bible: 'Whereas I was\r\nblind now I see.'\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool gave a little helpless gesture. \"And what shall you do?\"\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going back South to work for my people.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\" The old careworn look stole across Mrs. Vanderpool's features.\r\n\r\nZora came gently forward and slipped her arms lovingly about the other\r\nwoman's neck.\r\n\r\n\"Not right off,\" she said gently; \"not until I learn more. I hate to\r\nleave you, but--it calls!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool held the dark girl close and began craftily:\r\n\r\n\"You see, Zora, the more you know the more you can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if you are determined I will see that you are taught. You must know\r\nsettlement-work and reform movements; not simply here but--\" she\r\nhesitated--\"in England--in France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will it take long?\" Zora asked, smoothing the lady's hair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool considered. \"No--five years is not long; it is all too\r\nshort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five years: it is very long; but there is a great deal to learn. Must I\r\nstudy five years?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool threw back her head.\r\n\r\n\"Zora, I am selfish I know, but five years truly is none too long. Then,\r\ntoo, Zora, we have work to do in that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is Alwyn's career,\" and Mrs. Vanderpool looked into Zora's eyes.\r\n\r\nThe girl did not shrink, but she paused.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said slowly, \"we must help him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And after he rises--\"\r\n\r\n\"He will marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"The woman he loves,\" returned Zora, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--that is best,\" sighed Mrs. Vanderpool. \"But how shall we help\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Make him Treasurer of the United States without sacrificing his\r\nmanhood or betraying his people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do that,\" said Mrs. Vanderpool slowly.\r\n\r\n\"It will cost something,\" said Zora.\r\n\r\n\"I will do it,\" was the lady's firm assurance. Zora kissed her.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon Mrs. Cresswell went down to a white social settlement\r\nof which Congressman Todd had spoken, where a meeting of the Civic Club\r\nwas to be held. She had come painfully to realize that if she was to\r\nhave a career she must make it for herself. The plain, unwelcome truth\r\nwas that her husband had no great interests in life in which she could\r\nfind permanent pleasure. Companionship and love there was and, she told\r\nherself, always would be; but in some respects their lives must flow in\r\ntwo streams. Last night, for the second time, she had irritated him; he\r\nhad spoken almost harshly to her, and she knew she must brood or work\r\ntoday. And so she hunted work, eagerly.\r\n\r\nShe felt the atmosphere the moment she entered. There were carelessly\r\ngowned women and men smart and shabby, but none of them were thinking of\r\nclothes nor even of one another. They had great deeds in mind; they were\r\nscanning the earth; they were toiling for men. The same grim excitement\r\nthat sends smaller souls hunting for birds and rabbits and lions, had\r\nsent them hunting the enemies of mankind: they were bent to the chase,\r\nscenting the game, knowing the infinite meaning of their hunt and the\r\nglory of victory. Mary Cresswell had listened but a half hour before her\r\nworld seemed so small and sordid and narrow, so trivial, that a sense of\r\nshame spread over her. These people were not only earnest, but expert.\r\nThey acknowledged the need of Mr. Todd's educational bill.\r\n\r\n\"But the Republicans are going to side-track it; I have that on the best\r\nauthority,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"True; but can't we force them to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only by political power, and they've just won a campaign.\"\r\n\r\n\"They won it by Negro votes, and the Negro who secured the votes is\r\neager for this bill; he's a fine, honest fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; work with him; and when we can be of real service let us\r\nknow. Meantime, this Child Labor bill is different. It's bound to pass.\r\nBoth parties are back of it, and public opinion is aroused. Now our work\r\nis to force amendments enough to make the bill effective.\"\r\n\r\nDiscussion followed; not flamboyant and declamatory, but tense,\r\nstaccato, pointed. Mrs. Cresswell found herself taking part. Someone\r\nmentioned her name, and one or two glances of interest and even\r\ncuriosity were thrown her way. Congressmen's wives were rare at the\r\nCivic Club.\r\n\r\nCongressmen Todd urged Mrs. Cresswell to stay after the discussion and\r\nattend a meeting of the managers and workers of the Washington social\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\n\"Have you many settlements?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Three in all--two white and one colored.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will they all be represented?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course, Mrs. Cresswell. If you object to meeting the colored\r\npeople--\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell blushed.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" she answered; \"I used to teach colored people.\"\r\n\r\nShe watched this new group gather: a business man, two fashionable\r\nladies, three college girls, a gray-haired colored woman, and a young\r\nspectacled brown man, and then, to her surprise, Mrs. Vanderpool and\r\nZora.\r\n\r\nZora was scarcely seated when that strange sixth sense of hers told her\r\nthat something had happened, and it needed but a side-glance from Mrs.\r\nVanderpool to indicate what it was. She sat with folded hands and the\r\nold dreamy look in her eyes. In one moment she lived it all again--the\r\nred cabin, the moving oak, the sowing of the Fleece, and its fearful\r\nreaping. And now, when she turned her head, she would see the woman who\r\nwas to marry Bles Alwyn. She had often dreamed of her, and had set a\r\nhigh ideal. She wanted her to be handsome, well dressed, earnest and\r\ngood. She felt a sort of person proprietorship in her, and when at last\r\nthe quickened pulse died to its regular healthy beat, she turned and\r\nlooked and knew.\r\n\r\nCaroline Wynn deemed it a part of the white world's education to\r\nparticipate in meetings like this; doing so was not pleasant, but it\r\nappealed to her cynicism and mocking sense of pleasure. She always\r\nroused hostility as she entered: her gown was too handsome, her gloves\r\ntoo spotless, her air had hauteur enough to be almost impudent in the\r\nopinion of most white people. Then gradually her intelligence, her cool\r\nwit and self-possession, would conquer and she would go gracefully out\r\nleaving a rather bewildered audience behind. She sat today with her dark\r\ngold profile toward Zora, and the girl looked and was glad. She was such\r\na woman she would have Bles marry. She was glad, and she choked back the\r\nsob that struggled and fought in her throat.\r\n\r\nThe meeting never got beyond a certain constraint. The Congressman made\r\nan excellent speech; there were various sets of figures read by the\r\nworkers; and Miss Wynn added a touch of spice by several pertinent\r\nquestions and comments. Then, as the meeting broke up and Mrs. Cresswell\r\ncame forward to speak to Zora, Mrs. Vanderpool managed to find herself\r\nnear Miss Wynn and to be introduced. They exchanged a few polite\r\nphrases, fencing delicately to test the other's wrist and interest. They\r\ntouched on the weather, and settlement work; but Miss Wynn did not\r\npropose to be stranded on the Negro problem.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the next bit of excitement will be in the inauguration,\" she\r\nsaid to Mrs. Vanderpool.\r\n\r\n\"I understand it will be unusually elaborate,\" returned Mrs. Vanderpool,\r\na little surprised at the turn. Then she added pleasantly: \"I think I\r\nshall see it through, from speech to ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do usually,\" Miss Wynn asserted, adjusting her furs.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool was further surprised. Did colored people attend the\r\nball?\r\n\r\n\"We sorely need a national ball-room,\" she said. \"Isn't the census\r\nbuilding wretched?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" smiled Miss Wynn.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I thought you said--\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant _our_ ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Mrs. Vanderpool in turn. \"Oh!\" Here a thought came. Of\r\ncourse, the colored people had their own ball; she remembered having\r\nheard about it. Why not send Zora? She plunged in:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Wynn, I have a maid--such an intelligent girl; I do wish she could\r\nattend your ball--\" seeing her blunder, she paused. Miss Wynn was coolly\r\nbuttoning her glove.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she acknowledged politely, \"few of us can afford maids, and\r\ntherefore we do not usually arrange for them; but I think we can have\r\nyour _protégée_ look on from the gallery. Good-afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Vanderpool drove home she related the talk to Zora. Zora was\r\nsilent at first. Then she said deliberately:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Wynn was right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Zora!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Helene attend the ball four years ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Zora, must you folk ape our nonsense as well as our sense?\"\r\n\r\n\"You force us to,\" said Zora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty-eight_\r\n\r\nTHE ANNUNCIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new President had been inaugurated. Beneath the creamy pile of the\r\nold Capitol, and facing the new library, he had stood aloft and looked\r\ndown on a waving sea of faces--black-coated, jostling, eager-eyed fellow\r\ncreatures. They had watched his lips move, had scanned eagerly his dress\r\nand the gowned and decorated dignitaries beside him; and then, with\r\nblare of band and prancing of horses, he had been whirled down the dip\r\nand curve of that long avenue, with its medley of meanness and thrift\r\nand hurry and wealth, until, swinging sharply, the dim walls of the\r\nWhite House rose before him. He entered with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThen the vast welter of humanity dissolved and streamed hither and\r\nthither, gaping and laughing until night, when thousands poured into the\r\nred barn of the census shack and entered the artificial fairyland\r\nwithin. The President walked through, smiling; the senators protected\r\ntheir friends in the crush; and Harry Cresswell led his wife to a\r\nlittle oasis of Southern ladies and gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\"This is democracy for you,\" said he, wiping his brow.\r\n\r\nFrom a whirling eddy Mrs. Vanderpool waved at them, and they rescued\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I think I am ready to go,\" she gasped. \"Did you ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" Cresswell invited. But just then the crowd pushed them apart and\r\nshot them along, and Mrs. Cresswell found herself clinging to her\r\nhusband amid two great whirling variegated throngs of driving,\r\nwhite-faced people. The band crashed and blared; the people laughed and\r\npushed; and with rhythmic sound and swing the mighty throng was dancing.\r\n\r\nIt took much effort, but at last the Cresswell party escaped and rolled\r\noff in their carriages. They swept into the avenue and out again, then\r\nup 14th Street, where, turning for some street obstruction, they passed\r\na throng of carriages on a cross street.\r\n\r\n\"It's the other ball,\" cried Mrs. Vanderpool, and amid laughter she\r\nadded, \"Let's go!\"\r\n\r\nIt was--the other ball. For Washington is itself, and something else\r\nbesides. Along beside it ever runs that dark and haunting echo; that\r\nshadowy world-in-world with its accusing silence, its emphatic\r\nself-sufficiency. Mrs. Cresswell at first demurred. She thought of\r\nElspeth's cabin: the dirt, the smell, the squalor: of course, this would\r\nbe different; but--well, Mrs. Cresswell had little inclination for\r\nslumming. She was interested in the under-world, but intellectually, not\r\nby personal contact. She did not know that this was a side-world, not an\r\nunder-world. Yet the imposing building did not look sordid.\r\n\r\n\"Hired?\" asked some one.\r\n\r\n\"No, owned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\nThen there was a hitch.\r\n\r\n\"Tickets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where can we buy them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on sale,\" was the curt reply.\r\n\r\n\"Actually exclusive!\" sneered Cresswell, for he could not imagine any\r\none unwelcome at a Negro ball. Then he bethought himself of Sam\r\nStillings and sent for him. In a few minutes he had a dozen\r\ncomplimentary tickets in his hand.\r\n\r\nThey entered the balcony and sat down. Mary Cresswell leaned forward. It\r\nwas interesting. Beneath her was an ordinary pretty ball--flowered,\r\nsilked, and ribboned; with swaying whirling figures, music, and\r\nlaughter, and all the human fun of gayety and converse.\r\n\r\nAnd then she was impressed with the fact that this was no ordinary\r\nscene; it was, on the contrary, most extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThere was a black man waltzing with a white woman--no, she was not\r\nwhite, for Mary caught the cream and curl of the girl as she swept past:\r\nbut there was a white man (was he white?) and a black woman. The color\r\nof the scene was wonderful. The hard human white seemed to glow and live\r\nand run a mad gamut of the spectrum, from morn till night, from white to\r\nblack; through red and sombre browns, pale and brilliant yellows, dead\r\nand living blacks. Through her opera-glasses Mary scanned their hair;\r\nshe noted everything from the infinitely twisted, crackled, dead, and\r\ngrayish-black to the piled mass of red golden sunlight. Her eyes went\r\ndreaming; there below was the gathering of the worlds. She saw types of\r\nall nations and all lands swirling beneath her in human brotherhood, and\r\na great wonder shook her. They seemed so happy. Surely, this was no\r\nnether world; it was upper earth, and--her husband beckoned; he had been\r\nlaughing incontinently. He saw nothing but a crowd of queer looking\r\npeople doing things they were not made to do and appearing absurdly\r\nhappy over it. It irritated him unreasonably.\r\n\r\n\"See the washer-woman in red,\" he whispered. \"Look at the monkey. Come,\r\nlet's go.\"\r\n\r\nThey trooped noisily down-stairs, and Cresswell walked unceremoniously\r\nbetween a black man and his partner. Mrs. Vanderpool recognized and\r\ngreeted the girl as Miss Wynn. Mrs. Cresswell did not notice her, but\r\nshe paused with a start of recognition at the sight of the man.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bles!\" she exclaimed impetuously, starting to hold out her hand.\r\nShe was sincerely pleased at seeing him. Then she remembered. She bowed\r\nand smiled, looking at him with interest and surprise. He was correctly\r\ndressed, and the white shirt set off the comeliness of his black face in\r\ncompelling contrast. He carried himself like a man, and bowed with\r\ngravity and dignity. She passed on and heard her husband's petulant\r\nvoice in her ear.\r\n\r\n\"Mary--Mary! for Heaven's sake, come on; don't shake hands with\r\nniggers.\"\r\n\r\nIt was recurring flashes of temper like this, together with evidences of\r\ndubious company and a growing fondness for liquor, that drove Mary\r\nCresswell more and more to find solace in the work of Congressman Todd's\r\nCivic Club. She collected statistics for several of the Committee, wrote\r\nletters, interviewed a few persons, and felt herself growing in\r\nusefulness and importance. She did not mention these things to her\r\nhusband; she knew he would not object, but she shrank from his ridicule.\r\n\r\nThe various causes advocated by the Civic Club felt the impetus of the\r\naggressive work of the organization. This was especially the case with\r\nthe National Education Bill and the amendment to the Child Labor Bill.\r\nThe movement became strong enough to call Mr. Easterly down from New\r\nYork. He and the inner circle went over matters carefully.\r\n\r\n\"We need the political strength of the South,\" said Easterly; \"not only\r\nin framing national legislation in our own interests, but always in\r\nState laws. Particularly, we must get them into line to offset Todd's\r\nfoolishness. The Child Labor Bill must either go through unamended or be\r\nkilled. The Cotton Inspection Bill--our chief measure--must be slipped\r\nthrough quietly by Southern votes, while in the Tariff mix-up we must\r\ntake good care of cotton.\r\n\r\n\"Now, on the other hand, we are offending the Southerners in three ways:\r\nTodd's revived Blair Bill is too good a thing for niggers; the South is\r\nclamoring for a first classy embassy appointment; and the President's\r\nnomination of Alwyn as Treasurer will raise a howl from Virginia to\r\nTexas.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is some strong influence back of Alwyn,\" said Senator Smith; \"not\r\nonly are the Negroes enthused, but the President has daily letters from\r\nprominent whites.\"\r\n\r\n\"The strong influence is named Vanderpool,\" Easterly drily remarked.\r\n\"She's playing a bigger political game than I laid out for her. That's\r\nthe devil with women: they can't concentrate: they get too damned many\r\nside issues. Now, I offered her husband the French ambassadorship\r\nprovided she'd keep the Southerners feeling good toward us. She's hand\r\nin glove with the Southerners, all right; but she wants not only her\r\nhusband's appointment but this darkey's too.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's been decided, hasn't it?\" put in Smith.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" grumbled Easterly; \"but it makes it hard already. At any rate,\r\nthe Educational Bill must be killed right off. No more talk; no more\r\nconsideration--kill it, and kill it now. Now about this Child Labor\r\nBill: Todd's Civic Club is raising the mischief. Who's responsible?\"\r\n\r\nThe silent Jackson spoke up. \"Congressman Cresswell's wife has been very\r\nactive, and Todd thinks they've got the South with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Congressman Cresswell's wife!\" Easterly's face was one great\r\nexclamation point. \"Now what the devil does this mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Senator Smith, \"that it may mean an attempt on the\r\npart of Cresswell's friends to boost him for the French ambassadorship.\r\nHe's the only Southerner with money enough to support the position, and\r\nthere's been a good deal of quiet talk, I understand, in Southern\r\ncircles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's treason!\" Easterly shouted. \"It will ruin the plans of the\r\nCombine to put this amended Child Labor Bill through. John Taylor has\r\njust written me that he's starting mills at Toomsville, and that he\r\ndepends on unrestricted labor conditions, as we must throughout the\r\nSouth. Doesn't Cresswell know this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. I think it's just a bluff. If he gets the appointment he'll\r\nlet the bill drop.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see--everybody is raising his price, is he? Pretty soon the darky\r\nwill be holding us up. Well, see Cresswell, and put it to him strong. I\r\nmust go. Wire me.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Smith presented the matter bluntly to Cresswell as soon as he\r\nsaw him. \"Which would the South prefer--Todd's Education Bill, or\r\nAlwyn's appointment?\"\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Cresswell that the smaller matter of Stillings'\r\nintrigue should interest him more than Todd's measure, of which he knew\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"What is Todd's bill?\" asked Harry Cresswell, darkening.\r\n\r\nSmith, surprised, got out a copy and explained. Cresswell interrupted\r\nbefore he was half through.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see,\" he said angrily, \"that that will ruin our plans for the\r\nCotton Combine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" replied Smith; \"but it will not do the immediate harm that\r\nthe amended Child Labor Bill will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" demanded Cresswell, frowning again.\r\n\r\nSenator Smith regarded him again: was Cresswell playing a shrewd game?\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" he said at length, \"aren't you promoting it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the reply. \"Never heard of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" Senator Smith began, and paused. He turned and took up a circular\r\nissued by the Civic Club, giving a careful account of their endeavors to\r\namend and pass the Child Labor Bill. Cresswell read it, then threw it\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" he indignantly repudiated the measure. \"That will never do;\r\nit's as bad as the Education Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your wife is encouraging it and we thought you were back of it.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell stared in blank amazement.\r\n\r\n\"My wife!\" he gasped. Then he bethought himself. \"It's a mistake,\" he\r\nsupplemented; \"Mrs. Cresswell gave them no authority to sign her name.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's been very active,\" Smith persisted, \"and naturally we were all\r\nanxious.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell bit his lip. \"I shall speak to her; she does not realize what\r\nuse they are making of her passing interest.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried away, and Senator Smith felt a bit sorry for Mrs. Cresswell\r\nwhen he recalled the expression on her husband's face.\r\n\r\nMary Cresswell did not get home until nearly dinner time; then she came\r\nin glowing with enthusiasm. Her work had received special commendation\r\nthat afternoon, and she had been asked to take the chairmanship of the\r\ncommittee on publicity. Finding that her husband was at home, she\r\ndetermined to tell him--it was so good to be doing something worth\r\nwhile. Perhaps, too, he might be made to show some interest. She thought\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Todd and the old dream glowed faintly again.\r\n\r\nCresswell looked at her as she entered the library where he was waiting\r\nand smoking. She was rumpled and muddy, with flying hair and thick\r\nwalking shoes and the air of bustle and vigor which had crept into her\r\nblood this last month. Truly, her cheeks were glowing and her eyes\r\nbright, but he disapproved. Softness and daintiness, silk and lace and\r\nglimmering flesh, belonged to women in his mind, and he despised Amazons\r\nand \"business\" women. He received her kiss coldly, and Mary's heart\r\nsank. She essayed some gay greeting, but he interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\"What's this stuff about the Civic Club?\" he began sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Stuff?\" she queried, blankly.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I said.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" she answered stiffly. \"I belong to the Civic\r\nClub, and have been working with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" His resentment grew as he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"I did not think you were interested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you know that this Child Labor business was opposed to my\r\ninterests?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear, I did not dream it. It's a Republican bill, to be sure; but you\r\nseemed very friendly with Senator Smith, who introduced it. We were\r\nsimply trying to improve it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we didn't want it improved.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what some said; but I did not believe such--deception.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Cresswell's face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you will drop this bill and the Civic Club from now on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I say so,\" he retorted explosively, too angry to explain\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked at him--a long, fixed, penetrating look which revealed more\r\nthan she had ever seen before, then turned away and went slowly\r\nup-stairs. She did not come down to dinner, and in the evening the\r\ndoctor was called.\r\n\r\nCresswell drooped a bit after eating, hesitated, and reflected. He had\r\nacted too cavalierly in this Civic Club mess, he concluded, and yet he\r\nwould not back down. He'd go see her and pet her a bit, but be firm.\r\n\r\nHe opened her boudoir door gently, and she stood before him radiant,\r\nclothed in silk and lace, her hair loosened. He paused, astonished. But\r\nshe threw herself upon his neck, with a joyful, half hysterical cry.\r\n\r\n\"I will give it all up--everything! Willingly, willingly!\" Her voice\r\ndropped abruptly to a tremulous whisper. \"Oh, Harry! I--I am to be the\r\nmother of a child!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Twenty-nine_\r\n\r\nA MASTER OF FATE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is not the slightest doubt, Miss Wynn,\" Senator Smith was saying,\r\n\"but that the schools of the District will be reorganized.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Board of Education abolished?\" she added.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The power will be delegated to a single white superintendent.\"\r\n\r\nThe vertical line in Caroline Wynn's forehead became pronounced.\r\n\r\n\"Whose work is this, Senator?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there are, of course, various parties back of the change: the\r\n'outs,' the reformers, the whole tendency to concentrate responsibility,\r\nand so on. But, frankly, the deciding factor was the demand of the\r\nSouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything in Washington that the South does not already own?\"\r\n\r\nSenator Smith smiled thinly.\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" drily; \"but we own the South.\"\r\n\r\n\"And part of the price is putting the colored schools of the District in\r\nthe hands of a Southern man and depriving us of all voice in their\r\ncontrol?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, Miss Wynn. But you'd be surprised to know that it was the\r\nNegroes themselves who stirred the South to this demand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all; you mean the colored newspapers, I presume.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same, with Teerswell's clever articles; then his partner Stillings\r\nworked the 'impudent Negro teacher' argument on Cresswell until\r\nCresswell was wild to get the South in control of the schools.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do Teerswell and Stillings want?\"\r\n\r\n\"They want Bles Alwyn to make a fool of himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a trifle cryptic,\" Miss Wynn mused. The Senator amplified.\r\n\r\n\"We are giving the South the Washington schools and killing the\r\nEducation Bill in return for this support of some of our measures and\r\ntheir assent to Alwyn's appointment. You see I speak frankly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can stand it, Senator.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you can. Well, now, if Alwyn should act unwisely and offend\r\nthe South, somebody else stands in line for the appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"As Treasurer?\" she asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, they are too shrewd to ask that; it would offend their backers,\r\nor shall I say their tools, the Southerners. No, they ask only to be\r\nRegister and Assistant Register of the Treasury. This is an office\r\ncolored men have held for years, and it is quite ambitious enough for\r\nthem; so Stillings assures Cresswell and his friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Miss Wynn slowly acknowledged. \"But how do they hope to make\r\nMr. Alwyn blunder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too easily, I fear--unless _you_ are very careful. Alwyn has been\r\nworking like a beaver for the National Education Bill. He's been in to\r\nsee me several times, as you probably know. His heart is set on it. He\r\nregards its passage as a sort of vindication of his defence of the\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, the party has dropped the bill for good, and Alwyn doesn't like\r\nit. If he should attack the party--\"\r\n\r\n\"But he wouldn't,\" cried Miss Wynn with a start that belied her\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know that he is to be invited to make the principal address to\r\nthe graduates of the colored high-school?\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" she objected. \"They have selected Bishop Johnson; I--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you did,\" laughed the Senator, \"but the Judge got orders from\r\nhigher up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shrewd Mr. Teerswell,\" remarked Miss Wynn, sagely.\r\n\r\n\"Shrewd Mr. Stillings,\" the Senator corrected; \"but perhaps too shrewd.\r\nSuppose Mr. Alwyn should take this occasion to make a thorough defence\r\nof the party?\"\r\n\r\n\"But--will he?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's where you come in,\" Senator Smith pointed out, rising, \"and the\r\nreal reason of this interview. We're depending on you to pull the party\r\nout of an awkward hole,\" and he shook hands with his caller.\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn walked slowly up Pennsylvania Avenue with a smile on her face.\r\n\r\n\"I did not give him the credit,\" she declared, repeating it; \"I did not\r\ngive him the credit. Here I was, playing an alluring game on the side,\r\nand my dear Tom transforms it into a struggle for bread and butter; for\r\nof course, if the Board of Education goes, I lose my place.\" She lifted\r\nher head and stared along the avenue.\r\n\r\nA bitterness dawned in her eyes. The whole street was a living insult to\r\nher. Here she was, an American girl by birth and breeding, a daughter of\r\ncitizens who had fought and bled and worked for a dozen generations on\r\nthis soil; yet if she stepped into this hotel to rest, even with full\r\npurse, she would be politely refused accommodation. Should she attempt\r\nto go into this picture show she would be denied entrance. She was\r\nthirsty with the walk; but at yonder fountain the clerk would roughly\r\nrefuse to serve her. It was lunch time; there was no place within a mile\r\nwhere she was allowed to eat. The revolt deepened within her. Beyond\r\nthese known and definite discriminations lay the unknown and hovering.\r\nIn yonder store nothing hindered the clerk from being exceptionally\r\npert; on yonder street-car the conductor might reserve his politeness\r\nfor white folk; this policeman's business was to keep black and brown\r\npeople in their places. All this Caroline Wynn thought of, and then\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nThis was the thing poor blind Bles was trying to attack by \"appeals\" for\r\n\"justice.\" Nonsense! Does one \"appeal\" to the red-eyed beast that\r\nthrottles him? No. He composes himself, looks death in the eye, and\r\nspeaks softly, on the chance. Whereupon Miss Wynn composed herself,\r\nwaved gayly at a passing acquaintance, and matched some ribbons in a\r\ndepartment store. The clerk was new and anxious to sell.\r\n\r\nMeantime her brain was busy. She had a hard task before her. Alwyn's\r\nabsurd conscience and Quixotic ideas were difficult to cope with. After\r\nhis last indiscreet talk she had ventured deftly to remonstrate, and she\r\nwell remembered the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't what I said true?\" he had asked.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. Is that an excuse for saying it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The facts ought to be known.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but ought you to tell them?\"\r\n\r\n\"If not I, who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one who is less useful elsewhere, and whom I like less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carrie,\" he had been intensely earnest. \"I want to do the best thing,\r\nbut I'm puzzled. I wonder if I'm selling my birthright for six thousand\r\ndollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"In case of doubt, do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's the doubt: I may convert; I may open the eyes of the blind;\r\nI may start a crusade for Negro rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't believe it; it's useless; we'll never get our rights in this\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't believe that!\" he had ejaculated, shocked.\r\n\r\nWell, she must begin again. As she had hoped, he was waiting for her\r\nwhen she reached home. She welcomed him cordially, made a little music\r\nfor him, and served tea.\r\n\r\n\"Bles,\" she said, \"the Opposition has been laying a pretty shrewd trap\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he asked absently.\r\n\r\n\"They are going to have you chosen as High School commencement orator.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? Stuff!\"\r\n\r\n\"You--and not stuff, but 'Education' will be your natural theme. Indeed,\r\nthey have so engineered it that the party chiefs expect from you a\r\ndefence of their dropping of the Educational Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and probably your nomination will come before the speech and\r\nconfirmation after.\"\r\n\r\nBles walked the floor excitedly for a while and then sat down and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\"It was a shrewd move,\" he said; \"but I think I thank them for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't. But still,\r\n\r\n     _\"''T is the sport to see the engineer hoist\r\n     by his own petar.'\"_\r\n\r\nBles mused and she watched him covertly. Suddenly she leaned over.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover,\" she said, \"about that same date I'm liable to lose my\r\nposition as teacher.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her quickly, and she explained the coming revolution in\r\nschool management.\r\n\r\nHe did not discuss the matter, and she was equally reticent; but when he\r\nentered the doors of his lodging-place and, gathering his mail, slowly\r\nmounted the stairs, there came the battle of his life.\r\n\r\nHe knew it and he tried to wage it coolly and with method. He arrayed\r\nthe arguments side by side: on this side lay success; the greatest\r\noffice ever held by a Negro in America--greater than Douglass or Bruce\r\nor Lynch had held--a landmark, a living example and inspiration. A man\r\nowed the world success; there were plenty who could fail and stumble and\r\ngive multiple excuses. Should he be one? He viewed the other side. What\r\nmust he pay for success? Aye, face it boldly--what? Mechanically he\r\nsearched for his mail and undid the latest number of the _Colored\r\nAmerican_. He was sure the answer stood there in Teerswell's biting\r\nvulgar English. And there it was, with a cartoon:\r\n\r\n                HIS MASTER'S VOICE\r\n\r\n     Alwyn is Ordered to Eat His Words or Get Out\r\n            Watch Him Do It Gracefully\r\n           The Republican Leaders, etc.\r\n\r\nHe threw down his paper, and the hot blood sang in his ears. The\r\nsickening thought was that it was true. If he did make the speech\r\ndemanded it would be like a dog obedient to his master's voice.\r\n\r\nThe cold sweat oozed on his face; throwing up the window, he drank in\r\nthe Spring breeze, and stared at the city he once had thought so\r\nalluring. Somehow it looked like the swamp, only less beautiful; he\r\nstretched his arms and his lips breathed--\"Zora!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned hastily to his desk and looked at the other piece of mail--a\r\nsingle sealed note carefully written on heavy paper. He did not\r\nrecognize the handwriting. Then his mind flew off again. What would they\r\nsay if he failed to get the office? How they would silently hoot and\r\njeer at the upstart who suddenly climbed so high and fell. And Carrie\r\nWynn--poor Carrie, with her pride and position dragged down in his ruin:\r\nhow would she take it? He writhed in soul. And yet, to be a man; to say\r\ncalmly, \"No\"; to stand in that great audience and say, \"My people first\r\nand last\"; to take Carrie's hand and together face the world and\r\nstruggle again to newer finer triumphs--all this would be very close to\r\nattainment of the ideal. He found himself staring at the little letter.\r\nWould she go? Would she, could she, lay aside her pride and cynicism,\r\nher dainty ways and little extravagances? An odd fancy came to him:\r\nperhaps the answer to the riddle lay sealed within the envelope he\r\nfingered.\r\n\r\nHe opened it. Within lay four lines of writing--no more--no address, no\r\nsignature; simply the words:\r\n\r\n     _\"It matters now how strait the gate,\r\n       How charged with punishment the scroll;\r\n     I am the master of my fate,\r\n       I am the captain of my soul.\"_\r\n\r\nHe stared at the lines. Eleven o'clock--twelve--one--chimed the\r\ndeep-voiced clock without, before Alwyn went to bed.\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn had kept a vigil almost as long. She knew that Bles had\r\ninfluential friends who had urged his preferment; it might be wise to\r\nenlist them. Before she fell asleep she had determined to have a talk\r\nwith Mrs. Vanderpool. She had learned from Senator Smith that the lady\r\ntook special interest in Alwyn.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool heard Miss Wynn's story next day with some inward\r\ndismay. Really the breadth and depth of intrigue in this city almost\r\nfrightened her as she walked deeper into the mire. She had promised Zora\r\nthat Bles should receive his reward on terms which would not wound his\r\nmanhood. It seemed an easy, almost an obvious thing, to promise at the\r\ntime. Yet here was this rather unusual young woman asking Mrs.\r\nVanderpool to use her influence in making Alwyn bow to the yoke. She\r\nfenced for time.\r\n\r\n\"But I do not know Mr. Alwyn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you did; you recommended him highly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew of him slightly in the South and I have watched his career\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be too bad to have that career spoiled now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is it necessary? Suppose he should defend the Education Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"And criticise the party?\" asked Miss Wynn. \"It would take strong\r\ninfluence to pull him through.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if that strong influence were found?\" said Mrs. Vanderpool\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"It would surely involve some other important concession to the South.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool looked up, and an interjection hovered on her lips. Was\r\nit possible that the price of Alwyn's manhood would be her husband's\r\nappointment to Paris? And if it were?\r\n\r\n\"I'll do what I can,\" she said graciously; \"but I am afraid that will\r\nnot be much.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn hesitated. She had not succeeded even in guessing the source\r\nof Mrs. Vanderpool's interest in Alwyn, and without that her appeal was\r\nbut blind groping. She stopped on her way to the door to admire a bronze\r\nstatuette and find time to think.\r\n\r\n\"You are interested in bronzes?\" asked Mrs. Vanderpool.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; I'm far too poor. But I've dabbled a bit in sculpture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" Mrs. Vanderpool revealed a mild interest, and Miss Wynn was\r\ncompelled to depart with little enlightenment.\r\n\r\nOn the way up town she concluded that there was but one chance of\r\nsuccess: she must write Alwyn's speech. With characteristic decision she\r\nbegan her plans at once.\r\n\r\n\"What will you say in your speech?\" she asked him that night as he rose\r\nto go.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her and she wavered slightly under his black eyes. The\r\nfight was becoming a little too desperate even for her steady nerves.\r\n\r\n\"You would not like me to act dishonestly, would you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she involuntarily replied, regretting the word the moment she had\r\nuttered it. He gave her one of his rare sweet smiles, and, rising,\r\nbefore she realized his intent, he had kissed her hands and was gone.\r\n\r\nShe asked herself why she had been so foolish; and yet, somehow, sitting\r\nthere alone in the firelight, she felt glad for once that she had risen\r\nabove intrigue. Then she sighed and smiled, and began to plot anew.\r\nTeerswell dropped in later and brought his friend, Stillings. They found\r\ntheir hostess gay and entertaining.\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn gathered books about her, and in the days of April and May she\r\nand Alwyn read up on education. He marvelled at the subtlety of her\r\nmind, and she at the relentlessness of his. They were very near each\r\nother during these days, and yet there was ever something between them:\r\na vision to him of dark and pleading eyes that he constantly saw beside\r\nher cool, keen glance. And he to her was always two men: one man above\r\nmen, whom she could respect but would not marry, and one man like all\r\nmen, whom she would marry but could not respect. His devotion to an\r\nideal which she thought so utterly unpractical, aroused keen curiosity\r\nand admiration. She was sure he would fail in the end, and she wanted\r\nhim to fail; and somehow, somewhere back beyond herself, her better self\r\nlonged to find herself defeated; to see this mind stand firm on\r\nprinciple, under circumstances where she believed men never stood. Deep\r\nwithin her she discovered at times a passionate longing to believe in\r\nsomebody; yet she found herself bending every energy to pull this man\r\ndown to the level of time-servers, and even as she failed, feeling\r\nsomething like contempt for his stubbornness.\r\n\r\nThe great day came. He had her notes, her suggestions, her hints, but\r\nshe had no intimation of what he would finally say.\r\n\r\n\"Will you come to hear me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"That is best,\" he said, and then he added slowly, \"I would not like you\r\never to despise me.\"\r\n\r\nShe answered sharply: \"I want to despise you!\"\r\n\r\nDid he understand? She was not sure. She was sorry she had said it; but\r\nshe meant it fiercely. Then he left her, for it was already four in the\r\nafternoon and he spoke at eight.\r\n\r\nIn the morning she came down early, despite some dawdling over her\r\ntoilet. She brought the morning paper into the dining-room and sat down\r\nwith it, sipping her coffee. She leaned back and looked leisurely at the\r\nheadings. There was nothing on the front page but a divorce, a\r\nrevolution, and a new Trust. She took another sip of her coffee, and\r\nturned the page. There it was, \"Colored High Schools Close--Vicious\r\nAttack on Republican Party by Negro Orator.\"\r\n\r\nShe laid the paper aside and slowly finished her coffee. A few minutes\r\nlater she went to her desk and sat there so long that she started at\r\nhearing the clock strike nine.\r\n\r\nThe day passed. When she came home from school she bought an evening\r\npaper. She was not surprised to learn that the Senate had rejected\r\nAlwyn's nomination; that Samuel Stillings had been nominated and\r\nconfirmed as Register of the Treasury, and that Mr. Tom Teerswell was to\r\nbe his assistant. Also the bill reorganizing the school board had\r\npassed. She wrote two notes and posted them as she went out to walk.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached home Stillings was there, and they talked earnestly.\r\nThe bell rang violently. Teerswell rushed in.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Carrie!\" he cried eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Tom,\" she responded, giving him a languid hand. Stillings rose\r\nand departed. Teerswell nodded and said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think of last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great speech, I hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fool speech--that speech cost him, I calculate, between twenty-four\r\nand forty-eight thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly he's satisfied with his bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly. Are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"With his bargain?\" quickly. \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he pressed her, \"with your bargain?\"\r\n\r\n\"What bargain?\" she parried.\r\n\r\n\"To marry him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; that's off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it off?\" cried Teerswell delightedly. \"Good! It was foolish from the\r\nfirst--that black country--\"\r\n\r\n\"Gently,\" Miss Wynn checked him. \"I'm not yet over the habit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come. See what I've bought. You know I have a salary now.\" He produced\r\na ring with a small diamond cluster.\r\n\r\n\"How pretty!\" she said, taking it and looking at it. Then she handed it\r\nback.\r\n\r\nHe laughed gayly. \"It's yours, Carrie. You're going to marry me.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him queerly.\r\n\r\n\"Am I? But I've got another ring already,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, send Alwyn's back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have. This is still another.\" And uncovering her hand she showed a\r\nring with a large and beautiful diamond.\r\n\r\nHe rose. \"Whose is that?\" he demanded apprehensively.\r\n\r\n\"Mine--\" her eyes met his.\r\n\r\n\"But who gave it to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stillings,\" was the soft reply.\r\n\r\nHe stared at her helplessly. \"I--I--don't understand!\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to be brief, I'm engaged to Mr. Stillings.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! To that flat-headed--\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she coolly interrupted, \"to the Register of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nThe man was too dumbfounded, too overwhelmed for coherent speech.\r\n\r\n\"But--but--come; why in God's name--will you throw yourself away on--on\r\nsuch a--you're joking--you--\"\r\n\r\nShe motioned him to a chair. He obeyed like one in a trance.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Tom, be calm. When I was a baby I loved you, but that is long\r\nago. Today, Tom, you're an insufferable cad and I--well, I'm too much\r\nlike you to have two of us in the same family.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Stillings!\" he burst forth, almost in tears. \"The snake--what is\r\nhe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly as bad as you, I'll admit; but he has four thousand a year and\r\nsense enough to keep it. In truth, I need it; for, thanks to your\r\npolitical activity, my own position is gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he's a--a damned rascal!\" Wounded self-conceit was now getting the\r\nupper hand.\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I think he is. But he's such an exceptional rascal; he appeals to me.\r\nYou know, Tom, we're all more or less rascally--except one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except who?\" he asked quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Bles Alwyn.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she slowly agreed. \"Bles Alwyn, the Fool--and the Man. But by\r\ngrace of the Negro Problem, I cannot afford to marry a man--Hark! Some\r\none is on the steps. I'm sure it's Bles. You'd better go now. Don't\r\nattempt to fight with him; he's very strong. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nAlwyn entered. He didn't notice Teerswell as he passed out. He went\r\nstraight to Miss Wynn holding a crumpled note, and his voice faltered a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Bles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am selfish and--small.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you are not. You want to be; but give it up, Carrie; it isn't worth\r\nthe cost. Come, let's be honest and poor--and free.\"\r\n\r\nShe regarded him a moment, searchingly, then a look half quizzical, half\r\nsorrowful came into her eyes. She put both her hands on his shoulders\r\nand said as she kissed his lips:\r\n\r\n\"Bles, almost thou persuadest me--to be a fool. Now go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty_\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF ZORA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I never realized before just what a lie meant,\" said Zora.\r\n\r\nThe paper in Mrs. Vanderpool's hands fell quickly to her lap, and she\r\ngazed across the toilet-table.\r\n\r\nAs she gazed that odd mirage of other days haunted her again. She did\r\nnot seem to see her maid, nor the white and satin morning-room. She saw,\r\nwith some long inner sight, a vast hall with mighty pillars; a smooth,\r\nmarbled floor and a great throng whose silent eyes looked curiously upon\r\nher. Strange carven beasts gazed on from a setting of rich, barbaric\r\nsplendor and she herself--the Liar--lay in rags before the gold and\r\nivory of that lofty throne whereon sat Zora.\r\n\r\nThe foolish phantasy passed with the second of time that brought it, and\r\nMrs. Vanderpool's eyes dropped again to her paper, to those lines,--\r\n\r\n\"The President has sent the following nominations to the Senate ... To\r\nbe ambassador to France, John Vanderpool, Esq.\"\r\n\r\nThe first feeling of triumph thrilled faintly again until the low voice\r\nof Zora startled her. It was so low and calm, it came as though\r\njourneying from great distances and weary with travel.\r\n\r\n\"I used to think a lie a little thing, a convenience; but now I see. It\r\nis a great No and it kills things. You remember that day when Mr.\r\nEasterly called?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mrs. Vanderpool, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"I heard all he said. I could not help it; my transom was open. And\r\nthen, too, after he mentioned--Mr. Alwyn's name, I wanted to hear. I\r\nknew that his appointment would cost you the embassy--unless Bles was\r\ntempted and should fall. So I came to you to say--to say you mustn't pay\r\nthe price.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I lied,\" said Mrs. Vanderpool. \"I told you that he should be\r\nappointed and remain a man. I meant to make him see that he could yield\r\nwithout great cost. But I let you think I was giving up the embassy when\r\nI never intended to.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke coldly, yet Zora knew. She reached out and took the white,\r\nstill hands in hers, and over the lady's face again flitted that\r\nstricken look of age.\r\n\r\n\"I do not blame you,\" said Zora gently. \"I blame the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the world,\" Mrs. Vanderpool uttered harshly, then suddenly\r\nlaughed. But Zora went on:\r\n\r\n\"It bewildered me when I first read the news early this morning; the\r\nworld--everything--seemed wrong. You see, my plan was all so splendid.\r\nJust as I turned away from him, back to my people, I was to help him to\r\nthe highest. I was so afraid he would miss it and think that Right\r\ndidn't win in Life, that I wrote him--\"\r\n\r\n\"You wrote him? So did I.\"\r\n\r\nZora glanced at her quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Vanderpool. \"I thought I knew him. He seemed an\r\nordinary, rather priggish, opinionated country boy, and I wrote and\r\nsaid--Oh, I said that the world is the world; take it as it is. You\r\nwrote differently, and he obeyed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he did not know it was I. I was just a Voice from nowhere calling\r\nto him. I thought I was right. I wrote each day, sometimes twice,\r\nsending bits of verse, quotations, references, all saying the same\r\nthing: Right always triumphs. But it doesn't, does it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It never does save by accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think that is quite so,\" Zora pondered aloud, \"and I am a\r\nlittle puzzled. I do not belong in this world where Right and Wrong get\r\nso mixed. With us yonder there is wrong, but we call it wrong--mostly.\r\nOh, I don't know; even there things are mixed.\" She looked sadly at Mrs.\r\nVanderpool, and the fear that had been hovering behind her mistress's\r\neyes became visible.\r\n\r\n\"It was so beautiful,\" said Zora. \"I expected a great thing of you--a\r\nsacrifice. I do not blame you because you could not do it; and yet--yet,\r\nafter this,--don't you see?--I cannot stay here.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool arose and walked over to her. She stood above her, in\r\nher silken morning-gown, her brown and gray sprinkled hair rising above\r\nthe pale, strong-lined face.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" she faltered, \"will you leave me?\"\r\n\r\nZora answered, \"Yes.\" It was a soft \"yes,\" a \"yes\" full of pity and\r\nregret, but a \"yes\" that Mrs. Vanderpool knew in her soul to be final.\r\n\r\nShe sat down again on the lounge and her fingers crept along the\r\ncushions.\r\n\r\n\"Ambassadorships come--high,\" she said with a catch in her voice. Then\r\nafter a pause: \"When will you go, Zora?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you leave for the summer.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool looked out upon the beautiful city. She was a little\r\nsurprised at herself. She had found herself willing to sacrifice almost\r\nanything for Zora. No living soul had ever raised in her so deep an\r\naffection, and yet she knew now that, although the cost was great, she\r\nwas willing to sacrifice Zora for Paris. After all, it was not too\r\nlate; a rapid ride even now might secure high office for Alwyn and make\r\nCresswell ambassador. It would be difficult but possible. But she had\r\nnot the slightest inclination to attempt it, and she said aloud, half\r\nmockingly:\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Zora. I promised--and--I lied. Liars have no place in\r\nheaven and heaven is doubtless a beautiful place--but oh, Zora! you\r\nhaven't seen Paris!\"\r\n\r\nTwo months later they parted simply, knowing well it was forever. Mrs.\r\nVanderpool wrote a check.\r\n\r\n\"Use this in your work,\" she said. \"Miss Smith asked for it long ago. It\r\nis--my campaign contribution.\"\r\n\r\nZora smiled and thanked her. As she put the sealed envelope in her trunk\r\nher hand came in contact with a long untouched package. Zora took it out\r\nsilently and opened it and the beauty of it lightened the room.\r\n\r\n\"It is the Silver Fleece,\" said Zora, and Mrs. Vanderpool kissed her and\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nZora walked alone to the vaulted station. She did not try to buy a\r\nPullman ticket, although the journey was thirty-six hours. She knew it\r\nwould be difficult if not impossible and she preferred to share the lot\r\nof her people. Once on the foremost car, she leaned back and looked. The\r\ncar seemed clean and comfortable but strangely short. Then she realized\r\nthat half of it was cut off for the white smokers and as the door swung\r\nwhiffs of the smoke came in. But she was content for she was almost\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIt was eighteen little months ago that she had ridden up to the world\r\nwith widening eyes. In that time what had happened? Everything. How well\r\nshe remembered her coming, the first reflection of yonder gilded dome\r\nand the soaring of the capitol; the swelling of her heart, with\r\ninarticulate wonder; the pain of the thirst to know and understand. She\r\ndid not know much now but she had learned how to find things out. She\r\ndid not understand all, but some things she--\r\n\r\n\"Ticket\"--the tone was harsh and abrupt. Zora started. She had always\r\nnoted how polite conductors were to her and Mrs. Vanderpool--was it\r\nsimply because Mrs. Vanderpool was evidently a great and rich lady? She\r\nheld up her ticket and he snatched it from her muttering some direction.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Change at Charlotte,\" he snapped as he went on.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Zora that his discourtesy was almost forced: that he was\r\nafraid he might be betrayed into some show of consideration for a black\r\nwoman. She felt no anger, she simply wondered what he feared. The\r\nincreasing smell of tobacco smoke started her coughing. She turned. To\r\nbe sure. Not only was the door to the smoker standing open, but a white\r\npassenger was in her car, sitting by the conductor and puffing heartily.\r\nAs the black porter passed her she said gently:\r\n\r\n\"Is smoking allowed in here?\"\r\n\r\n\"It ain't non o' my business,\" he flung back at her and moved away. All\r\nday white men passed back and forward through the car as through a\r\nthoroughfare. They talked loudly and laughed and joked, and if they did\r\nnot smoke they carried their lighted cigars. At her they stared and made\r\ncomments, and one of them came and lounged almost over her seat,\r\ninquiring where she was going.\r\n\r\nShe did not reply; she neither looked nor stirred, but kept whispering\r\nto herself with something like awe: \"This is what they must endure--my\r\npoor people!\"\r\n\r\nAt Lynchburg a newsboy boarded the train with his wares. The conductor\r\nhad already appropriated two seats for himself, and the newsboy routed\r\nout two colored passengers, and usurped two other seats. Then he began\r\nto be especially annoying. He joked and wrestled with the porter, and on\r\nevery occasion pushed his wares at Zora, insisting on her buying.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't you got no money?\" he asked. \"Where you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" he whispered another time, \"don't you want to buy these gold\r\nspectacles? I found 'em and I dassen't sell 'em open, see? They're\r\nworth ten dollars--take 'em for a dollar.\"\r\n\r\nZora sat still, keeping her eyes on the window; but her hands worked\r\nnervously, and when he threw a book with a picture of a man and\r\nhalf-dressed woman directly under her eyes, she took it and dropped it\r\nout the window.\r\n\r\nThe boy started to storm and demanded pay, while the conductor glared at\r\nher; but a white man in the conductor's seat whispered something, and\r\nthe row suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\nA gang of colored section hands got on, dirty and loud. They sprawled\r\nabout and smoked, drank, and bought candy and cheap gewgaws. They eyed\r\nher respectfully, and with one of them she talked a little as he\r\nawkwardly fingered his cap.\r\n\r\nAs the day wore on Zora found herself strangely weary. It was not simply\r\nthe unpleasant things that kept happening, but the continued\r\napprehension of unknown possibilities. Then, too, she began to realize\r\nthat she had had nothing to eat. Travelling with Mrs. Vanderpool there\r\nwas always a dainty lunch to be had at call. She did not expect this,\r\nbut she asked the porter:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where I can get a lunch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Search me,\" he answered, lounging into a seat. \"Ain't no chance betwixt\r\nhere and Danville as I knows on.\"\r\n\r\nZora viewed her plight with a certain dismay--twelve hours without food!\r\nHow foolish of her not to have thought of this. The hours passed. She\r\nturned desperately to the gruff conductor.\r\n\r\n\"Could I buy a lunch from the dining-car?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the curt reply.\r\n\r\nShe made herself as comfortable as she could, and tried to put the\r\nmatter from her mind. She remembered how, forgotten years ago, she had\r\noften gone a day without eating and thought little of it. Night came\r\nslowly, and she fell to dreaming until the cry came, \"Charlotte! Change\r\ncars!\" She scrambled out. There was no step to the platform, her bag\r\nwas heavy, and the porter was busy helping the white folks to alight.\r\nShe saw a dingy lunchroom marked \"Colored,\" but she had no time to go to\r\nit for her train was ready.\r\n\r\nThere was another colored porter on this, and he was very polite and\r\naffable.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss; certainly I'll fetch you a lunch--plenty of time.\" And he\r\ndid. It did not look clean but Zora was ravenous.\r\n\r\nThe white smoker now had few occupants, but the white train crew\r\nproceeded to use the colored coach as a lounging-room and sleeping-car.\r\nThere was no passenger except Zora. They took off their coats, stretched\r\nthemselves on the seats, and exchanged jokes; but Zora was too tired to\r\nnotice much, and she was dozing wearily when she felt a touch on the arm\r\nand found the porter in the seat beside her with his arm thrown\r\nfamiliarly behind her along the top of the back. She rose abruptly to\r\nher feet and he started up.\r\n\r\n\"I beg pardon,\" he said, grinning.\r\n\r\nZora sat slowly down as he got up and left. She determined to sleep no\r\nmore. Yet a vast vision sank on her weary spirit--the vision of a dark\r\ncloud that dropped and dropped upon her, and lay as lead along her\r\nstraining shoulders. She must lift it, she knew, though it were big as a\r\nworld, and she put her strength to it and groaned as the porter cried in\r\nthe ghostly morning light:\r\n\r\n\"Atlanta! All change!\"\r\n\r\nAway yonder at the school near Toomsville, Miss Smith sat waiting for\r\nthe coming of Zora, absently attending the duties of the office. Dark\r\nlittle heads and hands bobbed by and soft voices called:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith, I wants a penny pencil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith, is yo' got a speller fo' ten cents?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith, mammy say please lemme come to school this week and she'll\r\nsho' pay Sata'day.\"\r\n\r\nYet the little voices that summoned her back to earth were less\r\nclamorous than in other years, for the school was far from full, and\r\nMiss Smith observed the falling off with grave eyes. This condition was\r\npatently the result of the cotton corner and the subsequent\r\nmanipulation. When cotton rose, the tenants had already sold their\r\ncotton; when cotton fell the landlords squeezed the rations and lowered\r\nthe wages. When cotton rose again, up went the new Spring rent\r\ncontracts. So it was that the bewildered black serf dawdled in listless\r\ninability to understand. The Cresswells in their new wealth, the\r\nMaxwells and Tollivers in the new pinch of poverty, stretched long arms\r\nto gather in the tenants and their children. Excuse after excuse came to\r\nthe school.\r\n\r\n\"I can't send the chilluns dis term, Miss Smith; dey has to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cresswell won't allow Will to go to school this term.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Tolliver done put Sam in the field.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so Miss Smith contemplated many empty desks.\r\n\r\nSlowly a sort of fatal inaction seized her. The school went on; daily\r\nthe dark little cloud of scholars rose up from hill and vale and settled\r\nin the white buildings; the hum of voices and the busy movements of\r\nindustrious teachers filled the day; the office work went on\r\nmethodically; but back of it all Miss Smith sat half hopeless. It cost\r\nfive thousand a year to run the school, and this sum she raised with\r\nincreasingly greater difficulty. Extra and heart-straining effort had\r\nbeen needed to raise the eight hundred dollars additional for interest\r\nmoney on the mortgage last year. Next year it might have to come out of\r\nthe regular income and thus cut off two teachers. Beyond all this the\r\nraising of ten thousand dollars to satisfy the mortgage seemed simply\r\nimpossible, and Miss Smith sat in fatal resignation, awaiting the coming\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"It's the Lord's work. I've done what I could. I guess if He wants it to\r\ngo on, He'll find a way. And if He doesn't--\" She looked off across the\r\nswamp and was silent.\r\n\r\nThen came Zora's letter, simple and brief, but breathing youth and\r\nstrength of purpose. Miss Smith seized upon it as an omen of salvation.\r\nIn vain her shrewd New England reason asked: \"What can a half-taught\r\nblack girl do in this wilderness?\" Her heart answered back: \"What is\r\nimpossible to youth and resolution?\" Let the shabbiness increase; let\r\nthe debts pile up; let the boarders complain and the teachers\r\ngossip--Zora was coming. And somehow she and Zora would find a way.\r\n\r\nAnd Zora came just as the sun threw its last crimson through the black\r\nswamp; came and gathered the frail and white-haired woman in her arms;\r\nand they wept together. Long and low they talked, far into the soft\r\nSouthern night; sitting shaded beneath the stars, while nearby blinked\r\nthe drowsy lights of the girls' dormitory. At last Miss Smith said,\r\nrising stiffly:\r\n\r\n\"I forgot to ask about Mrs. Vanderpool. How is she, and where?\"\r\n\r\nZora murmured some answer; but as she went to bed in her little white\r\nroom she sat wondering sadly. Where was the poor spoiled woman? Who was\r\nputting her to bed and smoothing the pillow? Who was caring for her, and\r\nwhat was she doing? And Zora strained her eyes Northward through the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Mrs. Vanderpool, rising from a gala dinner in the\r\nbrilliant drawing-room of her Lake George mansion, was reading the\r\nevening paper which her husband had put into her hands. With startled\r\neyes she caught the impudent headlines:\r\n\r\n              VANDERPOOL DROPPED\r\n\r\n          Senate Refuses to Confirm\r\n\r\n Todd Insurgents Muster Enough Votes to Defeat\r\n\r\n      Confirmation of President's Nominee\r\n\r\nRumored Revenge for Machine's Defeat of Child Labor\r\n\r\n               Bill Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paper trembled in her jewelled hands. She glanced down the column.\r\n\r\n\"Todd asks: Who is Vanderpool, anyhow? What did he ever do? He is known\r\nonly as a selfish millionaire who thinks more of horses than of men.\"\r\n\r\nCarelessly Mrs. Vanderpool threw the paper to the floor and bit her lips\r\nas the angry blood dyed her face.\r\n\r\n\"They _shall_ confirm him,\" she whispered, \"if I have to mortgage my\r\nimmortal soul!\" And she rang up long distance on the telephone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty-one_\r\n\r\nA PARTING OF WAYS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Was the child born dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse than dead!\"\r\n\r\nSomehow, somewhere, Mary Cresswell had heard these words; long, long,\r\nago, down there in the great pain-swept shadows of utter agony, where\r\nEarth seemed slipping its moorings; and now, today, she lay repeating\r\nthem mechanically, grasping vaguely at their meaning. Long she had\r\nwrestled with them as they twisted and turned and knotted themselves,\r\nand she worked and toiled so hard as she lay there to make the thing\r\nclear--to understand.\r\n\r\n\"Was the child born dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse than dead!\"\r\n\r\nThen faint and fainter whisperings: what could be worse than death? She\r\nhad tried to ask the grey old doctor, but he soothed her like a child\r\neach day and left her lying there. Today she was stronger, and for the\r\nfirst time sitting up, looking listlessly out across the world--a queer\r\nworld. Why had they not let her see the child--just one look at its\r\nlittle dead face? That would have been something. And again, as the\r\ndoctor cheerily turned to go, she sought to repeat the old question. He\r\nlooked at her sharply, then interrupted, saying kindly:\r\n\r\n\"There, now; you've been dreaming. You must rest quietly now.\" And with\r\na nod he passed into the other room to talk with her husband.\r\n\r\nShe was not satisfied. She had not been dreaming. She would tell Harry\r\nto ask him--she did not often see her husband, but she must ask him now\r\nand she arose unsteadily and swayed noiselessly across the floor. A\r\nmoment she leaned against the door, then opened it slightly. From the\r\nother side the words came distinctly and clearly:\r\n\r\n\"--other children, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have no other children, Mr. Cresswell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children unto the\r\nthird and fourth generation.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly, softly, she crept away. Her mind seemed very clear. And she\r\nbegan a long journey to reach her window and chair--a long, long\r\njourney; but at last she sank into the chair again and sat dry-eyed,\r\nwondering who had conceived this world and made it, and why.\r\n\r\nA long time afterward she found herself lying in bed, awake, conscious,\r\nclear-minded. Yet she thought as little as possible, for that was pain;\r\nbut she listened gladly, for without she heard the solemn beating of the\r\nsea, the mighty rhythmic beating of the sea. Long days she lay, and sat\r\nand walked beside those vast and speaking waters, till at last she knew\r\ntheir voice and they spoke to her and the sea-calm soothed her soul.\r\n\r\nFor one brief moment of her life she saw herself clearly: a well-meaning\r\nwoman, ambitious, but curiously narrow; not willing to work long for\r\nthe Vision, but leaping at it rashly, blindly, with a deep-seated sense\r\nof duty which she made a source of offence by preening and parading it,\r\nand forcing it to ill-timed notice. She saw that she had looked on her\r\nhusband as a means not an end. She had wished to absorb him and his work\r\nfor her own glory. She had idealized for her own uses a very human man\r\nwhose life had been full of sin and fault. She must atone.\r\n\r\nNo sooner, in this brief moment, did she see herself honestly than her\r\nold habits swept her on tumultuously. No ordinary atonement would do.\r\nThe sacrifice must be vast; the world must stand in wonder before this\r\nclever woman sinking her soul in another and raising him by sheer will\r\nto the highest.\r\n\r\nSo after six endless months Mary Cresswell walked into her Washington\r\nhome again. She knew she had changed in appearance, but she had\r\nforgotten to note how much until she saw the stare--almost the\r\nrecoil--of her husband, the muttered exclamation, the studied, almost\r\noverdone welcome. Then she went up to her mirror and looked long, and\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nShe was strong; she felt well; but she was slight, almost scrawny, and\r\nher beauty was gone forever. It had been of that blonde white-and-pink\r\ntype that fades in a flash, and its going left her body flattened and\r\nangular, her skin drawn and dead white, her eyes sunken. From the\r\nradiant girl whom Cresswell had met three years earlier the change was\r\nstartling, and yet the contrast seemed even greater than it was, for her\r\nglory then had been her abundant and almost golden hair. Now that hair\r\nwas faded, and falling so fast that at last the doctor advised her to\r\ncut it short. This left her ill-shaped head exposed and emphasized the\r\nsunken hollows of her face. She knew that she was changed but she did\r\nnot quite realize how changed, until now as she stood and gazed.\r\n\r\nYet she did not hesitate but from that moment set herself to her new\r\nlife task. Characteristically, she started dramatically and largely. She\r\nwas to make her life an endless sacrifice; she was to revivify the\r\nmanhood in Harry Cresswell, and all this for no return, no partnership\r\nof soul--all was to be complete sacrifice and sinking soul in soul.\r\n\r\nIf Mary Cresswell had attempted less she would have accomplished more.\r\nAs it was, she began well; she went to work tactfully, seeming to note\r\nno change in his manner toward her; but his manner had changed. He was\r\nstudiously, scrupulously polite in private, and in public devoted; but\r\nthere was no feeling, no passion, no love. The polished shell of his\r\nclan reflected conventional light even more carefully than formerly\r\nbecause the shell was cold and empty. There were no little flashes of\r\nanger now, no poutings nor sweet reconciliations. Life ran very smoothly\r\nand courteously; and while she did not try to regain the affection, she\r\nstrove to enthrall his intellect. She supplied a sub-committee upon\r\nwhich he was serving--not directly, but through him--with figures, with\r\nreports, books, and papers, so that he received special commendations; a\r\npraise that piqued as well as pleased him, because it implied a certain\r\nsurprise that he was able to do it.\r\n\r\n\"The damned Yankees!\" he sneered. \"They think they've got the brains of\r\nthe nation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not make a speech on the subject?\" she suggested.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. The matter under discussion was the cotton-goods schedule of\r\nthe new tariff bill, about which really he knew a little; his wife\r\nplaced every temptation to knowledge before him, even inspiring Senator\r\nSmith to ask him to defend that schedule against the low-tariff\r\nadvocate. Mary Cresswell worked with redoubled energy, and for nearly a\r\nweek Harry staid at home nights and studied. Thanks to his wife the\r\nspeech was unusually informing and well put, and the fact that a\r\nprominent free-trader spoke the same afternoon gave it publicity, while\r\nMr. Easterly saw to the press despatches.\r\n\r\nCresswell subscribed to a clipping-bureau and tasted the sweets of\r\ndawning notoriety, and Mrs. Cresswell arranged a select dinner-party\r\nwhich included a cabinet officer, a foreign ambassador, two\r\nmillionaires, and the leading Southern Congressmen. The talk came\r\naround to the failure of the Senate to confirm Mr. Vanderpool, and it\r\nwas generally assumed that the President would not force the issue.\r\n\r\nWho, then, should be nominated? There were several suggestions, but the\r\nknot of Southern Congressmen about Mrs. Cresswell declared emphatically\r\nthat it must be a Southerner. Not since the war had a prominent\r\nSoutherner represented America at a first-class foreign court; it was\r\nshameful; the time was ripe for change. But who? Here opinions differed\r\nwidely. Nearly every one mentioned a candidate, and those who did not\r\nseemed to refrain from motives of personal modesty.\r\n\r\nMary Cresswell sped her departing guests with a distinct purpose in\r\nmind. She must make herself leader of the Southern set in Washington and\r\nconcentrate its whole force on the appointment of Harry Cresswell as\r\nambassador to France. Quick reward and promotion were essential to\r\nHarry's success. He was not one to keep up the strain of effort a long\r\ntime. Unless, then, tangible results came and came quickly, he was\r\nliable to relapse into old habits. Therefore he must succeed and succeed\r\nat once. She would have preferred a less ornamental position than the\r\nambassadorship, but there were no other openings. The Alabama senators\r\nwere firmly seated for at least four years and the Governorship had been\r\ncarefully arranged for. A term of four years abroad, however, might\r\nbring Harry Cresswell back in time for greater advancement. At any rate,\r\nit was the only tangible offering, and Mary Cresswell silently\r\ndetermined to work for it.\r\n\r\nHere it was that she made her mistake. It was one thing for her to be a\r\ntactful hostess, pleasing her husband and his guests; it was another for\r\nher to aim openly at social leadership and political influence. She had\r\nat first all the insignia of success. Her dinners became of real\r\npolitical significance and her husband figured more and more as a\r\nleading Southerner. The result was two-fold. Cresswell, on the one hand,\r\nwith his usual selfishness, took his rising popularity as a matter of\r\ncourse and as the fruits of his own work; he was rising, he was making\r\nvaluable speeches, he was becoming a social power, and his only handicap\r\nwas his plain and over-ambitious wife. But on the other hand Mrs.\r\nCresswell forgot two pitfalls: the cleft between the old Southern\r\naristocracy and the pushing new Southerners; and above all, her own\r\nNorthern birth and presumably pro-Negro sympathies.\r\n\r\nWhat Mrs. Cresswell forgot Mrs. Vanderpool sensed unerringly. She had\r\nheard with uneasiness of Cresswell's renewed candidacy for the Paris\r\nambassadorship, and she set herself to block it. She had worked hard.\r\nThe President stood ready to send her husband's appointment again to the\r\nSenate whenever Easterly could assure him of favorable action. Easterly\r\nhad long and satisfactory interviews with several senators, while the\r\nTodd insurgents were losing heart at the prospect of choosing between\r\nVanderpool and Cresswell. At present four Southern votes were needed to\r\nconfirm Vanderpool; but if they could not be had, Easterly declared it\r\nwould be good politics to nominate Cresswell and give him Republican\r\nsupport. Manifestly, then, Mrs. Vanderpool's task was to discredit the\r\nCresswells with the Southerners. It was not a work to her liking, but\r\nthe die was cast and she refused to contemplate defeat.\r\n\r\nThe result was that while Mrs. Cresswell was giving large and brilliant\r\nparties to the whole Southern contingent, Mrs. Vanderpool was\r\nengineering exclusive dinners where old New York met stately Charleston\r\nand gossiped interestingly. On such occasions it was hinted not once,\r\nbut many times, that the Cresswells were well enough, but who was that\r\nupstart wife who presumed to take social precedence?\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until Mrs. Cresswell's plan for an all-Southern art\r\nexhibit in Washington that Mrs. Vanderpool, in a flash of inspiration,\r\nsaw her chance. In the annual exhibit of the Corcoran Art Gallery, a\r\nSouthern girl had nearly won first prize over a Western man. The\r\nconcensus of Southern opinion was that the judgment had been unfair, and\r\nMrs. Cresswell was convinced of this. With quick intuition she\r\nsuggested a Southern exhibit with such social prestige back of it as to\r\nimpress the country.\r\n\r\nThe proposal caught the imagination of the Southern set. None suspected\r\na possible intrusion of the eternal race issue for no Negroes were\r\nallowed in the Corcoran exhibit or school. This Mrs. Vanderpool easily\r\nascertained and a certain sense of justice combined in a curious way\r\nwith her political intrigue to bring about the undoing of Mary\r\nCresswell.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool's very first cautious inquiries by way of the back\r\nstairs brought gratifying response--for did not all black Washington\r\nknow well of the work in sculpture done by Mrs. Samuel Stillings, _nee_\r\nWynn? Mrs. Vanderpool remembered Mrs. Stillings perfectly, and she\r\nwalked, that evening, through unobtrusive thoroughfares and called on\r\nMrs. Stillings. Had Mrs. Stillings heard of the new art movement? Did\r\nshe intend to exhibit? Mrs. Stillings did not intend to exhibit as she\r\nwas sure she would not be welcome. She had had a bust accepted by the\r\nCorcoran Art Gallery once, and when they found she was colored they\r\nreturned it. But if she were especially invited? That would make a\r\ndifference, although even then the line would be drawn somehow.\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be worth a fight?\" suggested Mrs. Vanderpool with a little\r\nheightening of color in her pale cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mrs. Stillings, as she brought out some specimens of her\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanderpool was both ashamed and grateful. With money and leisure\r\nMrs. Stillings had been able to get in New York and Boston the training\r\nshe had been denied in Washington on account of her color. The things\r\nshe exhibited really had merit and one curiously original group appealed\r\nto Mrs. Vanderpool tremendously.\r\n\r\n\"Send it,\" she counseled with strangely contradictory feelings of\r\nenthusiasm, and added: \"Enter it under the name of Wynn.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general invitations to the art exhibit numbers of\r\nspecial ones were issued to promising Southern amateurs who had never\r\nexhibited. For these a prize of a long-term scholarship and other\r\nsmaller prizes were offered. When Mrs. Vanderpool suggested the name of\r\n\"Miss Wynn\" to Mrs. Cresswell among a dozen others, for special\r\ninvitation, there was nothing in its sound to distinguish it from the\r\nrest of the names, and the invitation went duly. As a result there came\r\nto the exhibit a little group called \"The Outcasts,\" which was really a\r\nmasterly thing and sent the director, Signor Alberni, into hysterical\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\nIn the private view and award of prizes which preceded the larger social\r\nfunction the jury hesitated long between \"The Outcasts\" and a painting\r\nfrom Georgia. Mrs. Cresswell was enthusiastic and voluble for the bit of\r\nsculpture, and it finally won the vote for the first prize.\r\n\r\nAll was ready for the great day. The President was coming and most of\r\nthe diplomatic corps, high officers of the army, and all the social\r\nleaders. Congress would be well represented, and the boom for Cresswell\r\nas ambassador to France was almost visible in the air.\r\n\r\nMary Cresswell paused a moment in triumph looking back at the darkened\r\nhall, when a little woman fluttered up to her and whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Cresswell, have you heard the gossip?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"That Wynn woman they say is a nigger. Some are whispering that you\r\nbrought her in purposely to force social equality. They say you used to\r\nteach darkies. Of course, I don't believe all their talk, but I thought\r\nyou ought to know.\" She talked a while longer, then fluttered furtively\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell sat down limply. She saw ruin ahead--to think of a black\r\ngirl taking a prize at an all-Southern art exhibit! But there was still\r\na chance, and she leaped to action. This colored woman was doubtless\r\nsome poor deserving creature. She would call on her immediately, and by\r\nan offer of abundant help induce her to withdraw quietly.\r\n\r\nEntering her motor, she drove near the address and then proceeded on\r\nfoot. The street was a prominent one, the block one of the best, the\r\nhouse almost pretentious. She glanced at her memorandum again to see if\r\nshe was mistaken. Perhaps the woman was a domestic; probably she was,\r\nfor the name on the door was Stillings. It occurred to her that she had\r\nheard that name before--but where? She looked again at her memorandum\r\nand at the house.\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell, asking the trim black maid: \"Is there a person named\r\nCaroline Wynn living in this house?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" she finally replied. \"Won't you come in?\" She was shown\r\ninto the parlor, where she sat down. The room was most interesting,\r\nfurnished in unimpeachable taste. A few good pictures were on the walls,\r\nand Mrs. Cresswell was examining one when she heard the swish of silken\r\nskirts. A lady with gold brown face and straight hair stood before her\r\nwith pleasant smile. Where had Mrs. Cresswell seen her before? She tried\r\nto remember, but could not.\r\n\r\n\"You wished to see--Caroline Wynn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell groped for her proper cue, but the brown lady merely\r\noffered a chair and sat down silently. Mrs. Cresswell's perplexity\r\nincreased. She had been planning to descend graciously but\r\nauthoritatively upon some shrinking girl, but this woman not only seemed\r\nto assume equality but actually looked it. From a rapid survey, Mrs.\r\nCresswell saw a black silk stocking, a bit of lace, a tailor-made gown,\r\nand a head with two full black eyes that waited in calmly polite\r\nexpectancy.\r\n\r\nSomething had to be said.\r\n\r\n\"I--er--came; that is, I believe you sent a group to the art exhibit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was good--very good.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Wynn said nothing, but sat calmly looking at her visitor. Mrs.\r\nCresswell felt irritated.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she managed to continue, \"we are very sorry that we cannot\r\nreceive it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? I understood it had taken the first prize.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell was aghast. Who had rushed the news to this woman? She\r\nrealized that there were depths to this matter that she did not\r\nunderstand and her irritation increased.\r\n\r\n\"You know that we could not give the prize to a--Negro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite immaterial. Social equality cannot be forced. At the same\r\ntime I recognize the injustice, and I have come to say that if you will\r\nwithdraw your exhibit you will be given a scholarship in a Boston\r\nschool.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not aware that I had asked for anything.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell felt herself getting angry.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you send your exhibit when you knew it was not wanted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you asked me to.\"\r\n\r\n\"We did not ask for colored people.\"\r\n\r\n\"You asked all Southern-born persons. I am a person and I am Southern\r\nborn. Moreover, you sent me a personal letter.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell was sure that this was a lie and was thoroughly incensed.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot have the prize,\" she almost snapped. \"If you will withdraw I\r\nwill pay you any reasonable sum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I do not want money; I want justice.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell arose and her face was white.\r\n\r\n\"That is the trouble with you Negroes: you wish to get above your places\r\nand force yourselves where you are not wanted. It does no good, it only\r\nmakes trouble and enemies.\" Mrs. Cresswell stopped, for the colored\r\nwoman had gone quietly out of the room and in a moment the maid entered\r\nand stood ready. Mrs. Cresswell walked slowly to the door and stepped\r\nout. Then she turned.\r\n\r\n\"What does Miss Wynn do for a living?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl tittered.\r\n\r\n\"She used to teach school but she don't do nothing now. She's just\r\nmarried; her husband is Mr. Stillings, Register of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell saw light as she turned to go down the steps. There was\r\nbut one resource--she must keep the matter out of the newspapers, and\r\nsee Stillings, whom she now remembered well.\r\n\r\n\"I beg pardon, does the Miss Wynn live here who got the prize in the art\r\nexhibition?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell turned in amazement. It was evidently a reporter, and the\r\nmaid was admitting him. The news would reach the papers and be blazoned\r\nto-morrow. Slowly she caught her motor and fell wearily back on its\r\ncushions.\r\n\r\n\"Where to, Madame?\" asked the chauffeur.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" returned Madame; so the chauffeur took her home.\r\n\r\nShe walked slowly up the stairs. All her carefully laid plans seemed\r\nabout to be thwarted and her castles were leaning toward ruin.\r\n\r\nYet all was not lost, if her husband continued to believe in her. If, as\r\nshe feared, he should suspect her on account of this Negro woman, and\r\nquarrel with her--\r\n\r\nBut he must not. This very night, before the morning papers came out,\r\nshe must explain. He must see; he must appreciate her efforts.\r\n\r\nShe rushed into her dressing-room and called her maid. Contrary to her\r\nPuritan notions, she frankly sought to beautify herself. She remembered\r\nthat it was the anniversary of her coming to this house. She got out her\r\nwedding-dress, and although it hung loosely, the maid draped the Silver\r\nFleece beautifully about her.\r\n\r\nShe heard her husband enter and come up-stairs. Quickly finishing her\r\ntoilet, she hurried down to arrange the flowers, for they were alone\r\nthat night. The telephone rang. She knew it would ring up-stairs in his\r\nroom, but she usually answered it for he disliked to. She raised the\r\nreceiver and started to speak when she realized that she had broken into\r\nthe midst of a conversation.\r\n\r\n\"--committee won't meet tonight, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n\"So? All right. Anything on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--big spree at Nell's. Will you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure thing; you know me! What time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Meet us at the Willard by nine. S'long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nShe slowly, half guiltily, replaced the receiver. She had not meant to\r\nlisten, but now to her desperate longing to keep him home was added a\r\nnew motive. Where was \"Nell's\"? What was \"Nell's\"? What was--and there\r\nwas fear in her heart. At dinner she tried all her powers on him. She\r\nhad his favorite dishes; she mixed his salad and selected his wine; she\r\ntalked interestingly, and listened sympathetically, to him. He looked at\r\nher with more attention. Her cheeks were more brilliant, for she had\r\ntouched them with rouge. Her eyes flashed; but he glanced furtively at\r\nher short hair. She saw the act; but still she strove until he was\r\ncontent and laughing; then coming round back of his chair, she placed\r\nher arms about his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Harry, will you do me a favor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes--if--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is something I want very, very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all right, if--\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry, I feel a little--hysterical, tonight, and--you will not refuse\r\nme, will you, Harry?\"\r\n\r\nStanding there, she saw the tableau in her own mind, and it looked\r\nstrange. She was afraid of herself. She knew that she would do something\r\nfoolish if she did not win this battle. She felt that overpowering\r\nfanaticism back within her raging restlessly. If she was not careful--\r\n\r\n\"But what is it you want?\" asked her husband.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want you to go out tonight.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed awkwardly.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, girl! The sub-committee on the cotton schedule meets\r\ntonight--very important; otherwise--\"\r\n\r\nShe shuddered at the smooth lie and clasped him closer, putting her\r\ncheek to his.\r\n\r\n\"Harry,\" she pleaded, \"just this once--for me.\"\r\n\r\nHe disengaged himself, half impatiently, and rose, glancing at the\r\nclock. It was nearly nine. A feeling of desperation came over her.\r\n\r\n\"Harry,\" she asked again as he slipped on his coat.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be foolish,\" he growled.\r\n\r\n\"Just this once--Harry--I--\" But the door banged to, and he was gone.\r\n\r\nShe stood looking at the closed door a moment. Something in her head was\r\nready to snap. She went to the rack and taking his long heavy overcoat\r\nslipped it on. It nearly touched the floor. She seized a soft\r\nbroad-brimmed hat and umbrella and walked out. Just what she meant to do\r\nshe did not know, but somehow she must save her husband and herself from\r\nevil. She hurried to the Willard Hotel and watched, walking up and down\r\nthe opposite sidewalk. A woman brushed by her and looked her in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Hell! I thought you was a man,\" she said. \"Is this a new gag?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell looked down at herself involuntarily and smiled wanly.\r\nShe did look like a man, with her hat and coat and short hair. The woman\r\npeered at her doubtingly. She was, as Mrs. Cresswell noticed, a young\r\nwoman, once pretty, perhaps, and a little over-dressed.\r\n\r\n\"Are you walking?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mrs. Cresswell, and then in a moment it\r\nflashed upon her. She took the woman's arm and walked with her. Suddenly\r\nshe stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Where's--Nell's?\"\r\n\r\nThe woman frowned. \"Oh, that's a swell place,\" she said. \"Senators and\r\nmillionaires. Too high for us to fly.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell winced. \"But where is it?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"We'll walk by it if you want to.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mary Cresswell walked in another world. Up from the ground of the\r\ndrowsy city rose pale gray forms; pale, flushed, and brilliant, in\r\nsilken rags. Up and down they passed, to and fro, looking and gliding\r\nlike sheeted ghosts; now dodging policemen, now accosting them\r\nfamiliarly.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Elise,\" growled one big blue-coat.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" and he peered at Mrs. Cresswell, who shrank back.\r\n\r\n\"Friend of mine. All right.\"\r\n\r\nA horror crept over Mary Cresswell: where had she lived that she had\r\nseen so little before? What was Washington, and what was this fine,\r\ntall, quiet residence? Was this--\"Nell's\"?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is it--good-bye--I must--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait--what is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any name,\" answered the woman suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Well--pardon me! Here!\" and she thrust a bill into the woman's hand.\r\n\r\nThe girl stared. \"Well, you're a queer one! Thanks. Guess I'll turn in.\"\r\n\r\nMary Cresswell turned to see her husband and his companions ascending\r\nthe steps of the quiet mansion. She stood uncertainly and looked at the\r\nopening and closing door. Then a policeman came by and looked at her.\r\n\r\n\"Come, move on,\" he brusquely ordered. Her vacillation promptly\r\nvanished, and she resolutely mounted the steps. She put out her hand to\r\nring, but the door flew silently open and a man-servant stood looking at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I have some friends here,\" she said, speaking coarsely.\r\n\r\n\"You will have to be introduced,\" said the man. She hesitated and\r\nstarted to turn away. Thrusting her hand in her pocket it closed upon\r\nher husband's card-case. She presented a card. It worked a rapid\r\ntransformation in the servant's manner, which did not escape her.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" he invited her.\r\n\r\nShe did not stop at the outstretched arm of the cloakman, but glided\r\nquickly up the stairs toward a vision of handsome women and strains of\r\nmusic. Harry Cresswell was sitting opposite and bending over an impudent\r\nblue-and-blonde beauty. Mary slipped straight across to him and leaned\r\nacross the table. The hat fell off, but she let it go.\r\n\r\n\"Harry!\" she tried to say as he looked up.\r\n\r\nThen the table swayed gently to and fro; the room bowed and whirled\r\nabout; the voices grew fainter and fainter--all the world receded\r\nsuddenly far away. She extended her hands languidly, then, feeling so\r\nutterly tired, let her eyelids drop and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nShe awoke with a start, in her own bed. She was physically exhausted but\r\nher mind was clear. She must go down and meet him at breakfast and talk\r\nfrankly with him. She would let bygones be bygones. She would explain\r\nthat she had followed him to save him, not to betray him. She would\r\npoint out the greater career before him if only he would be a man; she\r\nwould show him that they had not failed. For herself she asked nothing,\r\nonly his word, his confidence, his promise to try.\r\n\r\nAfter his first start of surprise at seeing her at the table, Cresswell\r\nuttered nothing immediately save the commonplaces of greeting. He\r\nmentioned one or two bits of news from the paper, upon which she\r\ncommented while dawdling over her egg. When the servant went out and\r\nclosed the door, she paused a moment considering whether to open by\r\nappeal or explanation. His smooth tones startled her:\r\n\r\n\"Of course, after your art exhibit and the scene of last night, Mary, it\r\nwill be impossible for us to live longer together.\"\r\n\r\nShe stared at him, utterly aghast--voiceless and numb.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the crisis approaching for some time, and the Negro\r\nbusiness settles it,\" he continued. \"I have now decided to send you to\r\nmy home in Alabama, to my father or your brother. I am sure you will be\r\nhappier there.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose. Bowing courteously, he waited, coldly and calmly, for her to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nAll at once she hated him and hated his aristocratic repression; this\r\ncold calm that hid hell and its fires. She looked at him, wide-eyed, and\r\nsaid in a voice hoarse with horror and loathing:\r\n\r\n\"You brute! You nasty brute!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty-two_\r\n\r\nZORA'S WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nZora was looking on her world with the keener vision of one who, blind\r\nfrom very seeing, closes the eyes a space and looks again with wider\r\nclearer vision. Out of a nebulous cloudland she seemed to step; a land\r\nwhere all things floated in strange confusion, but where one thing stood\r\nsteadfast, and that was love. When love was shaken all things moved, but\r\nnow, at last, for the first time she seemed to know the real and mighty\r\nworld that stood behind that old and shaken dream.\r\n\r\nSo she looked on the world about her with new eyes. These men and women\r\nof her childhood had hitherto walked by her like shadows; today they\r\nlived for her in flesh and blood. She saw hundreds and thousands of\r\nblack men and women: crushed, half-spirited, and blind. She saw how high\r\nand clear a light Sarah Smith, for thirty years and more, had carried\r\nbefore them. She saw, too, how that the light had not simply shone in\r\ndarkness, but had lighted answering beacons here and there in these dull\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nThere were thoughts and vague stirrings of unrest in this mass of black\r\nfolk. They talked long about their firesides, and here Zora began to sit\r\nand listen, often speaking a word herself. All through the countryside\r\nshe flitted, till gradually the black folk came to know her and, in\r\nsilent deference to some subtle difference, they gave her the title of\r\nwhite folk, calling her \"Miss\" Zora.\r\n\r\nToday, more than ever before, Zora sensed the vast unorganized power in\r\nthis mass, and her mind was leaping here and there, scheming and\r\ntesting, when voices arrested her.\r\n\r\nIt was a desolate bit of the Cresswell manor, a tiny cabin, new-boarded\r\nand bare, in front of it a blazing bonfire. A white man was tossing into\r\nthe flames different household articles--a feather bed, a bedstead, two\r\nrickety chairs. A young, boyish fellow, golden-faced and curly, stood\r\nwith clenched fists, while a woman with tear-stained eyes clung to him.\r\nThe white man raised a cradle to dash it into the flames; the woman\r\ncried, and the yellow man raised his arm threateningly. But Zora's hand\r\nwas on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Rob?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"They're selling us out,\" he muttered savagely. \"Millie's been sick\r\nsince the last baby died, and I had to neglect my crop to tend her and\r\nthe other little ones--I didn't make much. They've took my mule, now\r\nthey're burning my things to make me sign a contract and be a slave. But\r\nby--\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Rob, let Millie come with me--we'll see Miss Smith. We must get\r\nland to rent and arrange somehow.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother sobbed, \"The cradle--was baby's!\"\r\n\r\nWith an oath the white man dashed the cradle into the fire, and the red\r\nflame spurted aloft.\r\n\r\nThe crimson fire flashed in Zora's eyes as she passed the overseer.\r\n\r\n\"Well, nigger, what are you going to do about it?\" he growled\r\ninsolently.\r\n\r\nZora's eyelids drooped, her upper lip quivered.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" she answered softly. \"But I hope your soul will burn in hell\r\nforever and forever.\"\r\n\r\nThey proceeded down the plantation road, but Zora could not speak. She\r\npushed them slowly on, and turned aside to let the anger, the impotent,\r\nfutile anger, rage itself out. Alone in the great broad spaces, she knew\r\nshe could fight it down, and come back again, cool and in calm and\r\ndeadly earnest, to lead these children to the light.\r\n\r\nThe sorrow in her heart was new and strange; not sorrow for herself, for\r\nof that she had tasted the uttermost; but the vast vicarious suffering\r\nfor the evil of the world. The tumult and war within her fled, and a\r\nsense of helplessness sent the hot tears streaming down her cheeks. She\r\nlonged for rest; but the last plantation was yet to be passed. Far off\r\nshe heard the yodle of the gangs of peons. She hesitated, looking for\r\nsome way of escape: if she passed them she would see something--she\r\nalways saw something--that would send the red blood whirling madly.\r\n\r\n\"Here, you!--loafing again, damn you!\" She saw the black whip writhe and\r\ncurl across the shoulders of the plough-boy. The boy crouched and\r\nsnarled, and again the whip hissed and cracked.\r\n\r\nZora stood rigid and gray.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" her silent soul was shrieking within, \"why doesn't the\r\ncoward--\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the \"coward\" did. The whip was whirring in the air again; but\r\nit never fell. A jagged stone in the boy's hand struck true, and the\r\noverseer plunged with a grunt into the black furrow. In blank dismay,\r\nZora came back to her senses.\r\n\r\n\"Poor child!\" she gasped, as she saw the boy flying in wild terror over\r\nthe fields, with hue and cry behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Poor child!--running to the penitentiary--to shame and hunger and\r\ndamnation!\"\r\n\r\nShe remembered the rector in Mrs. Vanderpool's library, and his\r\nquestion that revealed unfathomable depths of ignorance: \"Really, now,\r\nhow do you account for the distressing increase in crime among your\r\npeople?\"\r\n\r\nShe swung into the great road trembling with the woe of the world in her\r\neyes. Cruelty, poverty, and crime she had looked in the face that\r\nmorning, and the hurt of it held her heart pinched and quivering. A\r\nmoment the mists in her eyes shut out the shadows of the swamp, and the\r\nroaring in her ears made a silence of the world.\r\n\r\nBefore she found herself again she dimly saw a couple sauntering along\r\nthe road, but she hardly noticed their white faces until the little\r\nvoice of the girl, raised timidly, greeted her.\r\n\r\n\"Howdy, Zora.\"\r\n\r\nZora looked. The girl was Emma, and beside her, smiling, stood a\r\nhalf-grown white man. It was Emma, Bertie's child; and yet it was not,\r\nfor in the child of other days Zora saw for the first time the dawning\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nAnd she saw, too, the white man. Suddenly the horror of the swamp was\r\nupon her. She swept between the couple like a gust, gripping the child's\r\narm till she paled and almost whimpered.\r\n\r\n\"I--I was just going on an errand for Miss Smith!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nLooking down into her soul, Zora discerned its innocence and the fright\r\nshining in the child's eyes. Her own eyes softened, her grip became a\r\ncaress, but her heart was hard.\r\n\r\nThe young man laughed awkwardly and strolled away. Zora looked back at\r\nhim and the paramount mission of her life formed itself in her mind. She\r\nwould protect this girl; she would protect all black girls. She would\r\nmake it possible for these poor beasts of burden to be decent in their\r\ntoil. Out of protection of womanhood as the central thought, she must\r\nbuild ramparts against cruelty, poverty, and crime. All this in\r\nturn--but now and first, the innocent girlhood of this daughter of shame\r\nmust be rescued from the devil. It was her duty, her heritage. She must\r\noffer this unsullied soul up unto God in mighty atonement--but how? Here\r\nnow was no protection. Already lustful eyes were in wait, and the child\r\nwas too ignorant to protect herself. She must be sent to\r\nboarding-school, somewhere far away; but the money? God! it was money,\r\nmoney, always money. Then she stopped suddenly, thrilled with the\r\nrecollection of Mrs. Vanderpool's check.\r\n\r\nShe dismissed the girl with a kiss, and stood still a moment\r\nconsidering. Money to send Emma off to school; money to buy a school\r\nfarm; money to \"buy\" tenants to live on it; money to furnish them\r\nrations; money--\r\n\r\nShe went straight to Miss Smith.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith, how much money have you?\" Miss Smith's hand trembled a bit.\r\nAh, that splendid strength of young womanhood--if only she herself had\r\nit! But perhaps Zora was the chosen one. She reached up and took down a\r\nwell-worn book.\r\n\r\n\"Zora,\" she said slowly, \"I've been going to tell you ever since you\r\ncame, but I hadn't the courage. Zora,\" Miss Smith hesitated and gripped\r\nthe book with thin white fingers, \"I'm afraid--I almost know that this\r\nschool is doomed.\"\r\n\r\nThere lay a silence in the room while the two women stared into each\r\nother's souls with startled eyes. Swallowing hard, Miss Smith spoke.\r\n\r\n\"When I thought the endowment sure, I mortgaged the school in order to\r\nbuy Tolliver's land. The endowment failed, as you know, because--perhaps\r\nI was too stubborn.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zora's eyes snapped \"No!\" and Miss Smith continued:\r\n\r\n\"I borrowed ten thousand dollars. Then I tried to get the land, but\r\nTolliver kept putting me off, and finally I learned that Colonel\r\nCresswell had bought it. It seems that Tolliver got caught tight in the\r\ncotton corner, and that Cresswell, through John Taylor, offered him\r\ntwice what he had agreed to sell to me for, and he took it. I don't\r\nsuppose Taylor knew what he was doing; I hope he didn't.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there I was with ten thousand dollars idle on my hands, paying\r\nten per cent on it and getting less than three per cent. I tried to get\r\nthe bank to take the money back, but they refused. Then I was\r\ntempted--and fell.\" She paused, and Zora took both her hands in her own.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" continued Miss Smith, \"just as soon as the announcement of\r\nthe prospective endowment was sent broadcast by the press, the donations\r\nfrom the North fell off. Letter after letter came from old friends of\r\nthe school full of congratulations, but no money. I ought to have cut\r\ndown the teaching force to the barest minimum, and gone North\r\nbegging--but I couldn't. I guess my courage was gone. I knew how I'd\r\nhave to explain and plead, and I just could not. So I used the ten\r\nthousand dollars to pay its own interest and help run the school.\r\nAlready it's half gone, and when the rest goes then will come the end.\"\r\n\r\nWithout, the great red sun paused a moment over the edge of the swamp,\r\nand the long, low cry of night birds broke sadly on the twilight\r\nsilence. Zora sat stroking the lined hands.\r\n\r\n\"Not the end,\" she spoke confidently. \"It cannot end like this. I've got\r\na little money that Mrs. Vanderpool gave me, and somehow we must get\r\nmore. Perhaps I might go North and--beg.\" She shivered. Then she sat up\r\nresolutely and turned to the book.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go over matters carefully,\" she proposed.\r\n\r\nTogether they counted and calculated.\r\n\r\n\"The balance is four thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight dollars,\"\r\nsaid Miss Smith.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and then there's Mrs. Vanderpool's check.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much is that?\"\r\n\r\nZora paused; she did not know. In her world there was little calculation\r\nof money. Credit and not cash is the currency of the Black Belt. She had\r\nbeen pleased to receive the check, but she had not examined it.\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know,\" she presently confessed. \"I think it was one\r\nthousand dollars; but I was so hurried in leaving that I didn't look\r\ncarefully,\" and the wild thought surged in her, suppose it was more!\r\n\r\nShe ran into the other room and plunged into her trunk; beneath the\r\nclothes, beneath the beauty of the Silver Fleece, till her fingers\r\nclutched and tore the envelope. A little choking cry burst from her\r\nthroat, her knees trembled so that she was obliged to sit down.\r\n\r\nIn her fingers fluttered a check for--_ten thousand dollars!_\r\n\r\nIt was not until the next day that the two women were sufficiently\r\ncomposed to talk matters over sanely.\r\n\r\n\"What is your plan?\" asked Zora.\r\n\r\n\"To put the money in a Northern savings bank at three per cent interest;\r\nto supply the rest of the interest, and the deficit in the running\r\nexpenses, from our balance, and to send you North to beg.\"\r\n\r\nZora shook her head. \"It won't do,\" she objected. \"I'd make a poor\r\nbeggar; I don't know human nature well enough, and I can't talk to rich\r\nwhite folks the way they expect us to talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be hypocrisy, Zora; you would be serving in a great cause.\r\nIf you don't go, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait! You sha'n't go. If any one goes it must be me. But let's think it\r\nout: we pay off the mortgage, we get enough to run the school as it has\r\nbeen run. Then what? There will still be slavery and oppression all\r\naround us. The children will be kept in the cotton fields; the men will\r\nbe cheated, and the women--\" Zora paused and her eyes grew hard.\r\n\r\nShe began again rapidly: \"We must have land--our own farm with our own\r\ntenants--to be the beginning of a free community.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith threw up her hands impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"But sakes alive! Where, Zora? Where can we get land, with Cresswell\r\nowning every inch and bound to destroy us?\"\r\n\r\nZora sat hugging her knees and staring out the window toward the sombre\r\nramparts of the swamp. In her eyes lay slumbering the madness of long\r\nago; in her brain danced all the dreams and visions of childhood.\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking,\" she murmured, \"of buying the swamp.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty-three_\r\n\r\nTHE BUYING OF THE SWAMP\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's a shame,\" asserted John Taylor with something like real feeling.\r\nHe was spending Sunday with his father-in-law, and both, over their\r\nafter-dinner cigars, were gazing thoughtfully at the swamp.\r\n\r\n\"What's a shame?\" asked Colonel Cresswell.\r\n\r\n\"To see all that timber and prime cotton-land going to waste. Don't you\r\nremember those fine bales of cotton that came out of there several\r\nseasons ago?\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel smoked placidly. \"You can't get it cleared,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But couldn't you hire some good workers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Niggers won't work. Now if we had Italians we might do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and in a few years they'd own the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right; so there we are. There's only one way to get that swamp\r\ncleared.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sell it to some fool darkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sell it? It's too valuable to sell.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it. You don't understand. The only way to get decent work\r\nout of some niggers is to let them believe they're buying land. In nine\r\ncases out of ten he works hard a while and then throws up the job. We\r\nget back our land and he makes good wages for his work.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in the tenth case--suppose he should stick to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\"--easily, \"we could get rid of him when we want to. White people\r\nrule here.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor frowned and looked a little puzzled. He was no moralist, but\r\nhe had his code and he did not understand Colonel Cresswell. As a matter\r\nof fact, Colonel Cresswell was an honest man. In most matters of\r\ncommerce between men he was punctilious to a degree almost annoying to\r\nTaylor. But there was one part of the world which his code of honor did\r\nnot cover, and he saw no incongruity in the omission. The uninitiated\r\ncannot easily picture to himself the mental attitude of a former\r\nslaveholder toward property in the hands of a Negro. Such property\r\nbelonged of right to the master, if the master needed it; and since\r\nridiculous laws safeguarded the property, it was perfectly permissible\r\nto circumvent such laws. No Negro starved on the Cresswell place,\r\nneither did any accumulate property. Colonel Cresswell saw to both\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nAs the Colonel and John Taylor were thus conferring, Zora appeared,\r\ncoming up the walk.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" asked the Colonel shading his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It's Zora--the girl who went North with Mrs. Vanderpool,\" Taylor\r\nenlightened him.\r\n\r\n\"Back, is she? Too trifling to stick to a job, and full of Northern\r\nnonsense,\" growled the Colonel. \"Even got a Northern walk--I thought for\r\na moment she was a lady.\"\r\n\r\nNeither of the gentlemen ever dreamed how long, how hard, how\r\nheart-wringing was that walk from the gate up the winding way beneath\r\ntheir careless gaze. It was not the coming of the thoughtless, careless\r\ngirl of five years ago who had marched a dozen times unthinking before\r\nthe faces of white men. It was the approach of a woman who knew how the\r\nworld treated women whom it respected; who knew that no such treatment\r\nwould be thought of in her case: neither the bow, the lifted hat, nor\r\neven the conventional title of decency. Yet she must go on naturally and\r\neasily, boldly but circumspectly, and play a daring game with two\r\npowerful men.\r\n\r\n\"Can I speak with you a moment, Colonel?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel did not stir or remove his cigar; he even injected a little\r\ngruffness into his tone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it?\"\r\n\r\nOf course, she was not asked to sit, but she stood with her hands\r\nclasped loosely before her and her eyes half veiled.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel, I've got a thousand dollars.\" She did not mention the other\r\nnine.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel sat up.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Vanderpool gave it to me to use in helping the colored people.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's just what I came to see you about. You see, I might give\r\nit to the school, but I've been thinking that I'd like to buy some land\r\nfor some of the tenants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got no land to sell,\" said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking you might sell a bit of the swamp.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell and Taylor glanced at each other and the Colonel re-lit his\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n\"How much of it?\" he asked finally.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; I thought perhaps two hundred acres.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred acres? Do you expect to buy that land for five dollars an\r\nacre?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir. I thought it might cost as much as twenty-five dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you've only got a thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; I thought I might pay that down and then pay the rest from\r\nthe crops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's going to work on the place?\"\r\n\r\nZora named a number of the steadiest tenants to whom she had spoken.\r\n\r\n\"They owe me a lot of money,\" said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"We'd try to pay that, too.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell considered. There was absolutely no risk. The cost of\r\nthe land, the back debts of the tenants--no possible crops could pay for\r\nthem. Then there was the chance of getting the swamp cleared for almost\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"How's the school getting on?\" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Very poorly,\" answered Zora sadly. \"You know it's mortgaged, and Miss\r\nSmith has had to use the mortgage money for yearly expenses.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n\"It will cost you fifty dollars an acre,\" he said finally. Zora looked\r\ndisappointed and figured out the matter slowly.\r\n\r\n\"That would be one thousand down and nine thousand to pay--\"\r\n\r\n\"With interest,\" said Cresswell.\r\n\r\nZora shook her head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"What would the interest be?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ten per cent.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood silent a moment and Colonel Cresswell spoke up:\r\n\r\n\"It's the best land about here and about the only land you can buy--I\r\nwouldn't sell it to anybody else.\"\r\n\r\nShe still hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"The trouble is, you see, Colonel Cresswell, the price is high and the\r\ninterest heavy. And after all I may not be able to get as many tenants\r\nas I'd need. I think though, I'd try it if--if I could be sure you'd\r\ntreat me fairly, and that I'd get the land if I paid for it.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell reddened a little, and John Taylor looked away.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you don't want to undertake it, all right.\"\r\n\r\nZora looked thoughtfully across the field--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Maxwell has a bit of land,\" she began meditatively.\r\n\r\n\"Worked out, and not worth five dollars an acre!\" snapped the Colonel.\r\nBut he did not propose to hand Maxwell a thousand dollars. \"Now, see\r\nhere, I'll treat you as well as anybody, and you know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe so, sir,\" acknowledged Zora in a tone that brought a sudden\r\nkeen glance from Taylor; but her face was a mask. \"I reckon I'll make\r\nthe bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Bring the money and we'll fix the thing up.\"\r\n\r\n\"The money is here,\" said Zora, taking an envelope out of her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Well, leave it here, and I'll see to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you see, sir, Miss Smith is so methodical; she expects some papers\r\nor receipts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's too late tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly you could sign a sort of receipt and later--\"\r\n\r\nCresswell laughed. \"Well, write one,\" he indulgently assented. And Zora\r\nwrote.\r\n\r\nWhen Zora left Colonel Cresswell's about noon that Sunday she knew her\r\nwork had just begun, and she walked swiftly along the country roads,\r\ncalling here and there. Would Uncle Isaac help her build a log home?\r\nWould the boys help her some time to clear some swamp land? Would Rob\r\nbecome a tenant when she asked? For this was the idle time of the year.\r\nCrops were laid by and planting had not yet begun.\r\n\r\nThis too was the time of big church meetings. She knew that in her part\r\nof the country on that day the black population, man, woman, and child,\r\nwere gathered in great groups; all day they had been gathering,\r\nstreaming in snake-like lines along the country roads, in well-brushed,\r\nbrilliant attire, half fantastic, half crude. Down where the\r\nToomsville-Montgomery highway dipped to the stream that fed the\r\nCresswell swamp squatted a square barn that slept through day and weeks\r\nin dull indifference. But on the First Sunday it woke to sudden mighty\r\nlife. The voices of men and children mingled with the snorting of\r\nanimals and the cracking of whips. Then came the long drone and\r\nsing-song of the preacher with its sharp wilder climaxes and the\r\nanswering \"amens\" and screams of the worshippers. This was the shrine of\r\nthe Baptists--shrine and oracle, centre and source of inspiration--and\r\nhither Zora hurried.\r\n\r\nThe preacher was Jones, a big man, fat, black, and greasy, with little\r\neyes, unctuous voice, and three manners: his white folks manner, soft,\r\nhumble, wheedling; his black folks manner, voluble, important,\r\ncondescending; and above all, his pulpit manner, loud, wild, and strong.\r\nHe was about to don this latter cloak when Zora approached with a\r\nrequest briefly to address the congregation. Remembering some former\r\nsnubs, his manner was lordly.\r\n\r\n\"I doesn't see,\" he returned reflectively, wiping his brows, \"as how I\r\ncan rightly spare you any time; the brethren is a-gettin' mighty\r\nonpatient to hear me.\" He pulled down his cuffs, regarding her\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I might speak after you're through,\" she suggested. But he objected\r\nthat there was the regular collection and two or three other\r\ncollections, a baptism, a meeting of the trustees; there was no time, in\r\nshort; but--he eyed her again.\r\n\r\n\"Does you want--a collection?\" he questioned suspiciously, for he could\r\nimagine few other reasons for talking. Then, too, he did not want to be\r\ntoo inflexible, for all of his people knew Zora and liked her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, I want no collection at all. I only want a little voluntary\r\nwork on their part.\" He looked relieved, frowned through the door at the\r\naudience, and looked at his bright gold watch. The whole crowd was not\r\nthere yet--perhaps--\r\n\r\n\"You kin say just a word before the sermont,\" he finally yielded; \"but\r\nnot long--not long. They'se just a-dying to hear me.\"\r\n\r\nSo Zora spoke simply but clearly: of neglect and suffering, of the sins\r\nof others that bowed young shoulders, of the great hope of the\r\nchildren's future. Then she told something of what she had seen and read\r\nof the world's newer ways of helping men and women. She talked of\r\ncooperation and refuges and other efforts; she praised their way of\r\nadopting children into their own homes; and then finally she told them\r\nof the land she was buying for new tenants and the helping hands she\r\nneeded. The preacher fidgeted and coughed but dared not actually\r\ninterrupt, for the people were listening breathless to a kind of\r\nstraightforward talk which they seldom heard and for which they were\r\nhungering.\r\n\r\nAnd Zora forgot time and occasion. The moments flew; the crowd increased\r\nuntil the wonderful spell of those dark and upturned faces pulsed in her\r\nblood. She felt the wild yearning to help them beating in her ears and\r\nblinding her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my people!\" she almost sobbed. \"My own people, I am not asking you\r\nto help others; I am pleading with you to help yourselves. Rescue your\r\nown flesh and blood--free yourselves--free yourselves!\" And from the\r\nswaying sobbing hundreds burst a great \"Amen!\" The minister's dusky face\r\ngrew more and more sombre, and the angry sweat started on his brow. He\r\nfelt himself hoaxed and cheated, and he meant to have his revenge. Two\r\nhundred men and women rose and pledged themselves to help Zora; and when\r\nshe turned with overflowing heart to thank the preacher he had left the\r\nplatform, and she found him in the yard whispering darkly with two\r\ndeacons. She realized her mistake, and promised to retrieve it during\r\nthe week; but the week was full of planning and journeying and talking.\r\n\r\nSaturday dawned cool and clear. She had dinner prepared for cooking in\r\nthe yard: sweet potatoes, hoe-cake, and buttermilk, and a hog to be\r\nbarbecued. Everything was ready by eight o'clock in the morning. Emma\r\nand two other girl helpers were on the tip-toe of expectancy. Nine\r\no'clock came and no one with it. Ten o'clock came, and eleven. High\r\nnoon found Zora peering down the highway under her shading hand, but no\r\nsoul in sight. She tried to think it out: what could have happened? Her\r\npeople were slow, tardy, but they would not thus forget her and\r\ndisappoint her without some great cause. She sent the girls home at dusk\r\nand then seated herself miserably under the great oak; then at last one\r\nhalf-grown boy hurried by.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to come, Miss Zora, but I was afeared. Preacher Jones has been\r\ntalking everywhere against you. He says that your mother was a voodoo\r\nwoman and that you don't believe in God, and the deacons voted that the\r\nmembers mustn't help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do the people believe that?\" she asked in consternation.\r\n\r\n\"They just don't know what to say. They don't 'zactly believe it, but\r\nthey has to 'low that you didn't say much 'bout religion when you\r\ntalked. You ain't been near Big Meetin'--and--and--you ain't saved.\" He\r\nhurried on.\r\n\r\nZora leaned her head back wearily, watching the laced black branches\r\nwhere the star-light flickered through--as coldly still and immovable as\r\nshe had watched them from those gnarled roots all her life--and she\r\nmurmured bitterly the world-old question of despair: \"What's the use?\"\r\nIt seemed to her that every breeze and branch was instinct with\r\nsympathy, and murmuring, \"What's the use?\" She wondered vaguely why, and\r\nas she wondered, she knew.\r\n\r\nFor yonder where the black earth of the swamp heaved in a formless mound\r\nshe felt the black arms of Elspeth rising from the sod--gigantic,\r\nmighty. They stole toward her with stealthy hands and claw-like talons.\r\nThey clutched at her skirts. She froze and could not move. Down, down\r\nshe slipped toward the black slime of the swamp, and the air about was\r\nhorror--down, down, till the chilly waters stung her knees; and then\r\nwith one grip she seized the oak, while the great hand of Elspeth\r\ntwisted and tore her soul. Faint, afar, nearer and nearer and ever\r\nmightier, rose a song of mystic melody. She heard its human voice and\r\nsought to cry aloud. She strove again and again with that gripping,\r\ntwisting pain--that awful hand--until the shriek came and she awoke.\r\n\r\nShe lay panting and sweating across the bent and broken roots of the\r\noak. The hand of Elspeth was gone but the song was still there. She rose\r\ntrembling and listened. It was the singing of the Big Meeting in the\r\nchurch far away. She had forgotten this religious revival in her days of\r\nhurried preparation, and the preacher had used her absence and apparent\r\nindifference against her and her work. The hand of Elspeth was reaching\r\nfrom the grave to pull her back; but she was no longer dreaming now.\r\nDrawing her shawl about her, she hurried down the highway.\r\n\r\nThe meeting had overflowed the church and spread to the edge of the\r\nswamp. The tops of young trees had been bent down and interlaced to form\r\na covering and benches twined to their trunks. Thus a low and wide\r\ncathedral, all green and silver in the star-light, lay packed with a\r\nliving mass of black folk. Flaming pine torches burned above the\r\ndevotees; the rhythm of their stamping, the shout of their voices, and\r\nthe wild music of their singing shook the night. Four hundred people\r\nfell upon their knees when the huge black preacher, uncoated, red-eyed,\r\nfrenzied, stretched his long arms to heaven. Zora saw the throng from\r\nafar, and hesitated. After all, she knew little of this strange faith of\r\ntheirs--had little belief in its mummery. She herself had been brought\r\nup almost without religion save some few mystic remnants of a\r\nhalf-forgotten heathen cult. The little she had seen of religious\r\nobservance had not moved her greatly, save once yonder in Washington.\r\nThere she found God after a searching that had seared her soul; but He\r\nhad simply pointed the Way, and the way was human.\r\n\r\nHumanity was near and real. She loved it. But if she talked again of\r\nmere men would these devotees listen? Already the minister had spied her\r\ntall form and feared her power. He set his powerful voice and the frenzy\r\nof his hearers to crush her.\r\n\r\n\"Who is dis what talks of doing the Lord's work for Him? What does de\r\ngood Book say? Take no thought 'bout de morrow. Why is you trying to\r\nmake dis ole world better? I spits on the world! Come out from it. Seek\r\nJesus. Heaven is my home! Is it yo's?\" \"Yes,\" groaned the multitude. His\r\narm shot out and he pointed straight at Zora.\r\n\r\n\"Beware the ebil one!\" he shouted, and the multitude moaned. \"Beware of\r\ndem dat calls ebil good. Beware of dem dat worships debbils; the debbils\r\ndat crawl; de debbils what forgits God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Help him, Lord!\" cried the multitude.\r\n\r\nZora stepped into the circle of light. A hush fell on the throng; the\r\npreacher paused a moment, then started boldly forward with upraised\r\nhands. Then a curious thing happened. A sharp cry arose far off down\r\ntoward the swamp and the sound of great footsteps coming, coming as from\r\nthe end of the world; there swelled a rhythmical chanting, wilder and\r\nmore primitive than song. On, on it came, until it swung into sight. An\r\nold man led the band--tall, massive, with tufted gray hair and wrinkled\r\nleathery skin, and his eyes were the eyes of death. He reached the\r\ncircle of light, and Zora started: once before she had seen that old\r\nman. The singing stopped but he came straight on till he reached Zora's\r\nside and then he whirled and spoke.\r\n\r\nThe words leaped and flew from his lips as he lashed the throng with\r\nbitter fury. He said what Zora wanted to say with two great differences:\r\nfirst, he spoke their religious language and spoke it with absolute\r\nconfidence and authority; and secondly, he seemed to know each one there\r\npersonally and intimately so that he spoke to no inchoate throng--he\r\nspoke to them individually, and they listened awestruck and fearsome.\r\n\r\n\"God is done sent me,\" he declared in passionate tones, \"to preach His\r\nacceptable time. Faith without works is dead; who is you that dares to\r\nset and wait for the Lord to do your work?\" Then in sudden fury, \"Ye\r\ngeneration of vipers--who kin save you?\" He bent forward and pointed his\r\nlong finger. \"Yes,\" he cried, \"pray, Sam Collins, you black devil; pray,\r\nfor the corn you stole Thursday.\" The black figure moved. \"Moan, Sister\r\nMaxwell, for the backbiting you did today. Yell, Jack Tolliver, you\r\nsneaking scamp, t'wil the Lord tell Uncle Bill who ruined his daughter.\r\nWeep, May Haynes, for that baby--\"\r\n\r\nBut the woman's shriek drowned his words, and he whirled full on the\r\npreacher, stamping his feet and waving his hands. His anger choked him;\r\nthe fat preacher cowered gray and trembling. The gaunt fanatic towered\r\nover him.\r\n\r\n\"You--you--ornery hound of Hell! God never knowed you and the devil owns\r\nyour soul!\" There leapt from his lips a denunciation so livid, specific,\r\nand impassioned that the preacher squatted and bowed, then finally fell\r\nupon his face and moaned.\r\n\r\nThe gaunt speaker turned again to the people. He talked of little\r\nchildren; he pictured their sin and neglect. \"God is done sent me to\r\noffer you all salvation,\" he cried, while the people wept and wailed;\r\n\"not in praying, but in works. Follow me!\" The hour was halfway between\r\nmidnight and dawn, but nevertheless the people leapt frenziedly to their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nAnd, singing and chanting, the throng poured out upon the black highway,\r\nwaving their torches. Zora knew his intention. With a half-dozen of\r\nyounger onlookers she unhitched teams and rode across the land, calling\r\nat the cabins. Before sunrise, tools were in the swamp, axes and saws\r\nand hammers. The noise of prayer and singing filled the Sabbath dawn.\r\nThe news of the great revival spread, and men and women came pouring in.\r\nThen of a sudden the uproar stopped, and the ringing of axes and grating\r\nof saws and tugging of mules was heard. The forest trembled as by some\r\nmighty magic, swaying and falling with crash on crash. Huge bonfires\r\nblazed and crackled, until at last a wide black scar appeared in the\r\nthick south side of the swamp, which widened and widened to full twenty\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose higher and higher till it blazed at high noon. The workers\r\ndropped their tools. The aroma of coffee and roasting meat rose in the\r\ndim cool shade. With ravenous appetites the dark, half-famished throng\r\nfell upon the food, and then in utter weariness stretched themselves and\r\nslept: lying along the earth like huge bronze earth-spirits, sitting\r\nagainst trees, curled in dense bushes.\r\n\r\nAnd Zora sat above them on a high rich-scented pile of logs. Her senses\r\nslept save her sleepless eyes. Amid a silence she saw in the little\r\ngrove that still stood, the cabin of Elspeth tremble, sigh, and\r\ndisappear, and with it flew some spirit of evil.\r\n\r\nThen she looked down to the new edge of the swamp, by the old lagoon,\r\nand saw Bles Alwyn standing there. It seemed very natural; and closing\r\nher eyes, she fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty-four_\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF ALWYN\r\n\r\n\r\nBles Alwyn stared at Mrs. Harry Cresswell in surprise. He had not seen\r\nher since that moment at the ball, and he was startled at the change.\r\nHer abundant hair was gone; her face was pale and drawn, and there were\r\nlittle wrinkles below her sunken eyes. In those eyes lurked the tired\r\nlook of the bewildered and the disappointed. It was in the lofty\r\nwaiting-room of the Washington station where Alwyn had come to meet a\r\nfriend. Mrs. Cresswell turned and recognized him with genuine pleasure.\r\nHe seemed somehow a part of the few things in the world--little and\r\nunimportant perhaps--that counted and stood firm, and she shook his hand\r\ncordially, not minding the staring of the people about. He took her bag\r\nand carried it towards the gate, which made the observers breathe\r\neasier, seeing him in servile duty. Someway, she knew not just how, she\r\nfound herself telling him of the crisis in her life before she realized;\r\nnot everything, of course, but a great deal. It was much as though she\r\nwere talking to some one from another world--an outsider; but one she\r\nhad known long, one who understood. Both from what she recounted and\r\nwhat she could not tell he gathered the substance of the story, and it\r\nbewildered him. He had not thought that white people had such troubles;\r\nyet, he reflected, why not? They, too, were human.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you hear from the school?\" he ventured after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes--not directly--but Zora used to speak of it.\"\r\n\r\nBles looked up quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Zora?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Didn't you see her while she was here? She has gone back now.\"\r\n\r\nThen the gate opened, the crowd surged through, sweeping them apart, and\r\nnext moment he was alone.\r\n\r\nAlwyn turned slowly away. He forgot the friend he was to meet. He forgot\r\neverything but the field of the Silver Fleece. It rose shadowy there in\r\nthe pale concourse, swaying in ghostly breezes. The purple of its\r\nflowers mingled with the silver radiance of tendrils that trembled\r\nacross the hurrying throng, like threads of mists along low hills. In\r\nits midst rose a dark, slim, and quivering form. She had been here--here\r\nin Washington! Why had he not known? What was she doing? \"She has gone\r\nback now\"--back to the Sun and the Swamp, back to the Burden.\r\n\r\nWhy should not he go back, too? He walked on thinking. He had failed.\r\nHis apparent success had been too sudden, too overwhelming, and when he\r\nhad faced the crisis his hand had trembled. He had chosen the Right--but\r\nthe Right was ineffective, impotent, almost ludicrous. It left him\r\nshorn, powerless, and in moral revolt. The world had suddenly left him,\r\nas the vision of Carrie Wynn had left him, alone, a mere clerk, an\r\ninsignificant cog in the great grinding wheel of humdrum drudgery. His\r\nchance to do and thereby to be had not come.\r\n\r\nHe thought of Zora again. Why not go back to the South where she had\r\ngone? He shuddered as one who sees before him a cold black pool whither\r\nhis path leads. To face the proscription, the insult, the lawless hate\r\nof the South again--never! And yet he went home and sat down and wrote a\r\nlong letter to Miss Smith.\r\n\r\nThe reply that came after some delay was almost curt. It answered few of\r\nhis questions, argued with none of his doubts, and made no mention of\r\nZora. Yes, there was need of a manager for the new farm and settlement.\r\nShe was not sure whether Alwyn could do the work or not. The salary was\r\nmeagre and the work hard. If he wished it, he must decide immediately.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later found Alwyn on the train facing Southward in the Jim\r\nCrow car. How he had decided to go back South he did not know. In fact,\r\nhe had not decided. He had sat helpless and inactive in the grip of\r\ngreat and shadowed hands, and the thing was as yet incomprehensible. And\r\nso it was that the vision Zora saw in the swamp had been real enough,\r\nand Alwyn felt strangely disappointed that she had given no sign of\r\ngreeting on recognition.\r\n\r\nIn other ways, too, Zora, when he met her, was to him a new creature.\r\nShe came to him frankly and greeted him, her gladness shining in her\r\neyes, yet looking nothing more than gladness and saying nothing more.\r\nJust what he had expected was hard to say; but he had left her on her\r\nknees in the dirt with outstretched hands, and somehow he had expected\r\nto return to some corresponding mental attitude. The physical change of\r\nthese three years was marvellous. The girl was a woman, well-rounded and\r\npoised, tall, straight, and quick. And with this went mental change: a\r\nself-mastery; a veiling of the self even in intimate talk; a subtle air\r\nas of one looking from great and unreachable heights down on the dawn of\r\nthe world. Perhaps no one who had not known the child and the girl as he\r\nhad would have noted all this; but he saw and realized the\r\ntransformation with a pang--something had gone; the innocence and wonder\r\nof the child, and in their place had grown up something to him\r\nincomprehensible and occult.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith was not to be easily questioned on the subject. She took no\r\nhints and gave no information, and when once he hazarded some pointed\r\nquestions she turned on him abruptly, observing acidly: \"If I were you\r\nI'd think less of Zora and more of her work.\"\r\n\r\nGradually, in his spiritual perplexity, Alwyn turned to Mary Cresswell.\r\nShe was staying with the Colonel at Cresswell Oaks. Her coming South was\r\nsupposed to be solely for reasons of health, and her appearance made\r\nthis excuse plausible. She was lonely and restless, and naturally drawn\r\ntoward the school. Her intercourse with Miss Smith was only formal, but\r\nher interest in Zora's work grew. Down in the swamp, at the edge of the\r\ncleared space, had risen a log cabin; long, low, spacious, overhung with\r\noak and pine. It was Zora's centre for her settlement-work. There she\r\nlived, and with her a half-dozen orphan girls and children too young for\r\nthe boarding department of the school. Mrs. Cresswell easily fell into\r\nthe habit of walking by here each day, coming down the avenue of oaks\r\nacross the road and into the swamp. She saw little of Zora personally\r\nbut she saw her girls and learned much of her plans.\r\n\r\nThe rooms of the cottage were clean and light, supplied with books and\r\npictures, simple toys, and a phonograph. The yard was one wide green and\r\ngolden play-ground, and all day the music of children's glad crooning\r\nand the singing of girls went echoing and trembling through the trees,\r\nas they played and sewed and washed and worked.\r\n\r\nFrom the Cresswells and the Maxwells and others came loads of clothes\r\nfor washing and mending. The Tolliver girls had simple dresses made,\r\nembroidery was ordered from town, and soon there would be the gardens\r\nand cotton fields. Mrs. Cresswell would saunter down of mornings.\r\nSometimes she would talk to the big girls and play with the children;\r\nsometimes she would sit hidden in the forest, listening and glimpsing\r\nand thinking, thinking, till her head whirled and the world danced red\r\nbefore her eyes, today she rose wearily, for it was near noon, and\r\nstarted home. She saw Alwyn swing along the road to the school\r\ndining-room where he had charge of the students at the noonday meal.\r\n\r\nAlwyn wanted Mrs. Cresswell's judgment and advice. He was growing\r\ndoubtful of his own estimate of women. Evidently something about his\r\nstandards was wrong; consequently he made opportunities to talk with\r\nMrs. Cresswell when she was about, hoping she would bring up the subject\r\nof Zora of her own accord. But she did not. She was too full of her own\r\ncares and troubles, and she was only too glad of willing and sympathetic\r\nears into which to pour her thoughts. Miss Smith soon began to look on\r\nthese conversations with some uneasiness. Black men and white women\r\ncannot talk together casually in the South and she did not know how far\r\nthe North had put notions in Alwyn's head.\r\n\r\nToday both met each other almost eagerly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell had just had a bit of news which only he would fully\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard of the Vanderpools?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No--except that he was appointed and confirmed at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they had only arrived in France when he died of apoplexy. I do\r\nnot know,\" added Mrs. Cresswell, \"I may be wrong and--I hope I'm not\r\nglad.\" Then there leapt to her mind a hypothetical question which had to\r\ndo with her own curious situation. It was characteristic of her to brood\r\nand then restlessly to seek relief in consulting the one person near who\r\nknew her story. She started to open the subject again today.\r\n\r\nBut Alwyn, his own mind full, spoke first and rapidly. He, too, had\r\nturned to her as he saw her come from Zora's home. He must know more\r\nabout the girl. He could no longer endure this silence. Zora beneath her\r\napparent frankness was impenetrable, and he felt that she carefully\r\navoided him, although she did it so deftly that he felt rather than\r\nobserved it. Miss Smith still systematically snubbed him when he\r\nbroached the subject of Zora. With others he did not speak; the matter\r\nseemed too delicate and sacred, and he always had an awful dread lest\r\nsometime, somewhere, a chance and fatal word would be dropped, a breath\r\nof evil gossip which would shatter all. He had hated to obtrude his\r\ntroubles on Mrs. Cresswell, who seemed so torn in soul. But today he\r\nmust speak, although time pressed.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Cresswell,\" he began hurriedly, \"there's a matter--a personal\r\nmatter of which I have wanted to speak--a long time--I--\" The\r\ndinner-bell rang, and he stopped, vexed.\r\n\r\n\"Come up to the house this afternoon,\" she said; \"Colonel Cresswell will\r\nbe away--\" Then she paused abruptly. A strange startling thought flashed\r\nthrough her brain. Alwyn noticed nothing. He thanked her cordially and\r\nhurried toward the dining-hall, meeting Colonel Cresswell on horseback\r\njust as he turned into the school gate.\r\n\r\nMary Cresswell walked slowly on, flushing and paling by turns. Could it\r\nbe that this Negro had dared to misunderstand her--had presumed? She\r\nreviewed her conduct. Perhaps she had been indiscreet in thus making a\r\nconfidant of him in her trouble. She had thought of him as a boy--an old\r\nstudent, a sort of confidential servant; but what had he thought? She\r\nremembered Miss Smith's warning of years before--and he had been North\r\nsince and acquired Northern notions of freedom and equality. She bit her\r\nlip cruelly.\r\n\r\nYet, she mused, she was herself to blame. She had unwittingly made the\r\nintimacy and he was but a Negro, looking on every white woman as a\r\ngoddess and ready to fawn at the slightest encouragement. There had been\r\nno one else here to confide in. She could not tell Miss Smith her\r\ntroubles, although she knew Miss Smith must suspect. Harry Cresswell,\r\napparently, had written nothing home of their quarrel. All the neighbors\r\nbehaved as if her excuse of ill-health were sufficient to account for\r\nher return South to escape the rigors of a Northern winter. Alwyn, and\r\nAlwyn alone, really knew. Well, it was her blindness, and she must right\r\nit quietly and quickly with hard ruthless plainness. She blushed again\r\nat the shame of it; then she began to excuse.\r\n\r\nAfter all, which was worse--a Cresswell or an Alwyn? It was no sin that\r\nAlwyn had done; it was simply ignorant presumption, and she must correct\r\nhim firmly, but gently, like a child. What a crazy muddle the world was!\r\nShe thought of Harry Cresswell and the tale he told her in the swamp.\r\nShe thought of the flitting ghosts that awful night in Washington. She\r\nthought of Miss Wynn who had jilted Alwyn and given her herself a very\r\nbad quarter of an hour. What a world it was, and after all how far was\r\nthis black boy wrong? Just then Colonel Cresswell rode up behind and\r\ngreeted her.\r\n\r\nShe started almost guiltily, and again a sense of the awkwardness of her\r\nposition reddened her face and neck. The Colonel dismounted, despite her\r\nprotest, and walked beside her. They chatted along indifferently, of the\r\ncrops, her brother's new baby, the proposed mill.\r\n\r\n\"Mary,\" his voice abruptly struck a new note. \"I don't like the way you\r\ntalk with that Alwyn nigger.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he continued, \"you're Northern born and you have been a\r\nteacher in this school and feel differently from us in some ways; but\r\nmark what I say, a nigger will presume on the slightest pretext, and you\r\nmust keep them in their place. Then, too, you are a Cresswell now--\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled bitterly; he noticed it, but went on:\r\n\r\n\"You are a Cresswell, even if you have caught Harry up to some of his\r\ndeviltry,\"--she started,--\"and got miffed about it. It'll all come out\r\nright. You're a Cresswell, and you must hold yourself too high to\r\n'Mister' a nigger or let him dream of any sort of equality.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke pleasantly, but with a certain sharp insistence that struck a\r\nnote of fear in Mary's heart. For a moment she thought of writing Alwyn\r\nnot to call. But, no; a note would be unwise. She and Colonel Cresswell\r\nlunched rather silently.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must get to town,\" he finally announced. \"The mill directors\r\nmeet today. If Maxwell calls by about that lumber tell him I'll see him\r\nin town.\" And away he went.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely reached the highway and ridden a quarter of a mile or\r\nso when he spied Bles Alwyn hurrying across the field toward the\r\nCresswell Oaks. He frowned and rode on. Then reining in his horse, he\r\nstopped in the shadow of the trees and watched Alwyn.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Zora saw him as she came up from her house. She, too,\r\nstopped, and soon saw whom he was watching. She had been planning to see\r\nMr. Cresswell about the cut timber on her land. By legal right it was\r\nhers but she knew he would claim half, treating her like a mere tenant.\r\nSeeing him watching Alwyn she paused in the shadow and waited, fearing\r\ntrouble. She, too, had felt that the continued conversations of Alwyn\r\nand Mrs. Cresswell were indiscreet, but she hoped that they had\r\nattracted no one else's attention. Now she feared the Colonel was\r\nsuspicious and her heart sank. Alwyn went straight toward the house and\r\ndisappeared in the oak avenue. Still Colonel Cresswell waited but Zora\r\nwaited no longer. Alwyn must be warned. She must reach Cresswell's\r\nmansion before Cresswell did and without him seeing her. This meant a\r\nlong detour of the swamp to approach the Oaks from the west. She\r\nsilently gathered up her skirts and walked quickly and carefully away.\r\n\r\nShe was a strong woman, lithe and vigorous, living in the open air and\r\nused to walking. Once out of hearing she threw away her hat and bending\r\nforward ran through the swamp. For a while she ran easily and swiftly.\r\nThen for a moment she grew dizzy and it seemed as though she was\r\nstanding still and the swamp in solemn grandeur marching past--in solemn\r\nmocking grandeur. She loosened her dress at the neck and flew on.\r\n\r\nShe sped at last through the oaks, up the terraces, and slowing down to\r\nan unsteady walk, staggered into the house. No one would wonder at her\r\nbeing there. She came up now and then and sorted the linen and piled the\r\nbaskets for her girls. She entered a side door and listened. The\r\nColonel's voice sounded impatiently in the front hall.\r\n\r\n\"Mary! Mary?\"\r\n\r\nA pause, then an answer:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father!\"\r\n\r\nHe started up the front stairway and Zora hurried up the narrow back\r\nstairs, almost overturning a servant.\r\n\r\n\"I'm after the clothes,\" she explained. She reached the back landing\r\njust in time to see Colonel Cresswell's head rising up the front\r\nstaircase. With a quick bound she almost fell into the first room at the\r\ntop of the stairs.\r\n\r\nBles Alwyn had hurried through his dinner duties and hastened to the\r\nOaks. The questions, the doubts, the uncertainty within him were\r\nclamoring for utterance. How much had Mrs. Cresswell ever known of Zora?\r\nWhat kind of a woman was Zora now? Mrs. Cresswell had seen her and had\r\ntalked to her and watched her. What did she think? Thus he formulated\r\nhis questions as he went, half timid, and fearful in putting them and\r\nyet determined to know.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell, waiting for him, was almost panic-stricken. Probably he\r\nwould beat round the bush seeking further encouragement; but at the\r\nslightest indication she must crush him ruthlessly and at the same time\r\npoint the path of duty. He ought to marry some good girl--not Zora, but\r\nsome one. Somehow Zora seemed too unusual and strange for him--too\r\ninhuman, as Mary Cresswell judged humanity. She glanced out from her\r\nseat on the upper verandah over the front porch and saw Alwyn coming.\r\nWhere should she receive him? On the porch and have Mr. Maxwell ride up?\r\nIn the parlor and have the servants astounded and talking? If she took\r\nhim up to her own sitting-room the servants would think he was doing\r\nsome work or fetching something for the school. She greeted him briefly\r\nand asked him in.\r\n\r\n\"Good-afternoon, Bles\"--using his first name to show him his place, and\r\nthen inwardly recoiling at its note of familiarity. She preceded him\r\nup-stairs to the sitting-room, where, leaving the door ajar, she seated\r\nherself on the opposite side of the room and waited.\r\n\r\nHe fidgeted, then spoke rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Cresswell--this is a personal affair.\" She reddened angrily. \"A\r\nlove affair\"--she paled with something like fear--\"and I\"--she started\r\nto speak, but could not--\"I want to know what you think about Zora?\"\r\n\r\n\"About Zora!\" she gasped weakly. The sudden reaction, the revulsion of\r\nher agitated feelings, left her breathless.\r\n\r\n\"About Zora. You know I loved her dearly as a boy--how dearly I have\r\nonly just begun to realize: I've been wondering if I understood--if I\r\nwasn't--\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell got angrily to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"You have come here to speak to me of that--that--\" she choked, and Bles\r\nthought his worst fears realized.\r\n\r\n\"Mary, Mary!\" Colonel Cresswell's voice broke suddenly in upon them.\r\nWith a start of fear Mrs. Cresswell rushed out into the hall and closed\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"Mary, has that Alwyn nigger been here this afternoon?\" Mr. Cresswell\r\nwas coming up-stairs, carrying his riding whip.\r\n\r\n\"Why, no!\" she answered, lying instinctively before she quite realized\r\nwhat her lie meant. She hesitated. \"That is, I haven't seen him. I must\r\nhave nodded over my book,\"--looking toward the little verandah at the\r\nfront of the upper hall, where her easy chair stood with her book. Then\r\nwith an awful flash of enlightenment she realized what her lie might\r\nmean, and her heart paused.\r\n\r\nCresswell strode up.\r\n\r\n\"I saw him come up--he must have entered. He's nowhere downstairs,\" he\r\nwavered and scowled. \"Have you been in your sitting-room?\" And then, not\r\nwaiting for a reply, he strode to the door.\r\n\r\n\"But the damned scoundrel wouldn't dare!\"\r\n\r\nHe deliberately placed his hand in his right-hand hip-pocket and threw\r\nopen the door.\r\n\r\nMary Cresswell stood frozen. The full horror of the thing burst upon\r\nher. Her own silly misapprehension, the infatuation of Alwyn for Zora,\r\nher thoughtless--no, vindictive--betrayal of him to something worse than\r\ndeath. She listened for the crack of doom. She heard a bird singing far\r\ndown in the swamp; she heard the soft raising of a window and the\r\nclosing of a door. And then--great God in heaven! must she live forever\r\nin this agony?--and then, she heard the door bang and Mr. Cresswell's\r\ngruff voice--\r\n\r\n\"Well, where is he?--he isn't in there!\"\r\n\r\nMary Cresswell felt that something was giving way within. She swayed and\r\nwould have crashed to the bottom of the staircase if just then she had\r\nnot seen at the opposite end of the hall, near the back stairs, Zora and\r\nAlwyn emerge calmly from a room, carrying a basket full of clothes.\r\nColonel Cresswell stared at them, and Zora instinctively put up her hand\r\nand fastened her dress at the throat. The Colonel scowled, for it was\r\nall clear to him now.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he angrily opened upon them, \"if you niggers want to meet\r\naround keep out of this house; hereafter I'll send the clothes down. By\r\nGod, if you want to make love go to the swamp!\" He stamped down the\r\nstairs while an ashy paleness stole beneath the dark-red bronze of\r\nZora's face.\r\n\r\nThey walked silently down the road together--the old familiar road.\r\nAlwyn was staring moodily ahead.\r\n\r\n\"We must get married--before Christmas, Zora,\" he presently avowed, not\r\nlooking at her. He felt the basket pause and he glanced up. Her dark\r\neyes were full upon him and he saw something in their depths that\r\nbrought him to himself and made him realize his blunder.\r\n\r\n\"Zora!\" he stammered, \"forgive me! Will you marry me?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him calmly with infinite compassion. But her reply was\r\nuttered unhesitantly; distinct, direct.\r\n\r\n\"No, Bles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty-five_\r\n\r\nTHE COTTON MILL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Toomsville started in their beds and listened. A new song\r\nwas rising on the air: a harsh, low, murmuring croon that shook the\r\nvillage ranged around its old square of dilapadated stores. It was not a\r\nsong of joy; it was not a song of sorrow; it was not a song at all,\r\nperhaps, but a confused whizzing and murmuring, as of a thousand\r\nill-tuned, busy voices. Some of the listeners wondered; but most of the\r\ntown cried joyfully, \"It's the new cotton-mill!\"\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor's head teemed with new schemes. The mill trust of the North\r\nwas at last a fact. The small mills had not been able to buy cotton when\r\nit was low because Cresswell was cornering it in the name of the\r\nFarmers' League; now that it was high they could not afford to, and many\r\nsurrendered to the trust.\r\n\r\n\"Next thing,\" wrote Taylor to Easterly, \"is to reduce cost of\r\nproduction. Too much goes in wages. Gradually transfer mills South.\"\r\n\r\nEasterly argued that the labor was too unskilled in the South and that\r\nto send Northern spinners down would spread labor troubles. Taylor\r\nreplied briefly: \"Never fear; we'll scare them with a vision of niggers\r\nin the mills!\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell was not so easily won over to the new scheme. In the\r\nfirst place he was angry because the school, which he had come to regard\r\nas on its last legs, somehow still continued to flourish. The\r\nten-thousand-dollar mortgage had but three more years, and that would\r\nend all; but he had hoped for a crash even earlier. Instead of this,\r\nMiss Smith was cheerfully expanding the work, hiring new teachers, and\r\nespecially she had brought to help her two young Negroes whom he\r\nsuspected. Colonel Cresswell had prevented the Tolliver land sale, only\r\nto be inveigled himself into Zora's scheme which now began to worry him.\r\nHe must evict Zora's tenants as soon as the crops were planted and\r\nharvested. There was nothing unjust about such a course, he argued, for\r\nNegroes anyway were too lazy and shiftless to buy the land. They would\r\nnot, they could not, work without driving. All this he imparted to John\r\nTaylor, to which that gentleman listened carefully.\r\n\r\n\"H'm, I see,\" he owned. \"And I know the way out.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"A cotton mill in Toomsville.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that got to do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring in whites.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want poor white trash; I'd sooner have niggers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here,\" argued Taylor, \"you can't have everything you\r\nwant--day's gone by for aristocracy of old kind. You must have\r\nneighbors: choose, then, white or black. I say white.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they'll rule us--out-vote us--marry our daughters,\" warmly objected\r\nthe Colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Some of them may--most of them won't. A few of them with brains will\r\nhelp us rule the rest with money. We'll plant cotton mills beside the\r\ncotton fields, use whites to keep niggers in their place, and the fear\r\nof niggers to keep the poorer whites in theirs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"There's something in that,\" he confessed after a while; \"but it's a\r\nmighty big experiment, and it may go awry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not with brains and money to guide it. And at any rate, we've got to\r\ntry it; it's the next logical step, and we must take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in the meantime, I'm not going to give up good old methods; I'm\r\ngoing to set the sheriff behind these lazy niggers,\" said the Colonel;\r\n\"and I'm going to stop that school putting notions into their heads.\"\r\n\r\nIn three short months the mill at Toomsville was open and its wheels\r\nwhizzing to the boundless pride of the citizens.\r\n\r\n\"Our enterprise, sir!\" they said to the strangers on the strength of the\r\nfive thousand dollars locally invested.\r\n\r\nOnce it had vigor to sing, the song of the mill knew no resting; morning\r\nand evening, day and night it crooned its rhythmic tune; only during the\r\ndaylight Sundays did its murmur die to a sibilant hiss. All the week its\r\ndoors were filled with the coming and going of men and women and\r\nchildren: many men, more women, and greater and greater throngs of\r\nchildren. It seemed to devour children, sitting with its myriad eyes\r\ngleaming and its black maw open, drawing in the pale white mites,\r\nsucking their blood and spewing them out paler and ever paler. The face\r\nof the town began to change, showing a ragged tuberculous looking side\r\nwith dingy homes in short and homely rows.\r\n\r\nThere came gradually a new consciousness to the town. Hitherto town and\r\ncountry had been ruled by a few great landlords but at the very first\r\nelection, Colton, an unknown outsider, had beaten the regular candidate\r\nfor sheriff by such a majority that the big property owners dared not\r\ncount him out. They had, however, an earnest consultation with John\r\nTaylor.\r\n\r\n\"It's just as I said,\" growled Colonel Cresswell, \"if you don't watch\r\nout our whole plantation system will be ruined and we'll be governed by\r\nthis white trash from the hills.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's only one way,\" sighed Caldwell, the merchant; \"we've got to\r\nvote the niggers.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor laughed. \"Nonsense!\" he spurned the suggestion. \"You're\r\nold-fashioned. Let the mill-hands have the offices. What good will it\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"What good! Why, they'll do as they please with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bosh! Don't we own the mill? Can't we keep wages where we like by\r\nthreatening to bring in nigger labor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you can't, permanently,\" Maxwell disputed, \"for they sometime will\r\ncall your bluff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let 'em call,\" said Taylor, \"and we'll put niggers in the mills.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" ejaculated the landlords in chorus. Only Maxwell was silent.\r\n\"And kill the plantation system?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, maybe some time, of course. But not for years; not until you've\r\nmade your pile. You don't really expect to keep the darkies down\r\nforever, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't,\" Maxwell slowly admitted. \"This system can't last\r\nalways--sometimes I think it can't last long. It's wrong, through and\r\nthrough. It's built on ignorance, theft, and force, and I wish to God we\r\nhad courage enough to overthrow it and take the consequences. I wish it\r\nwas possible to be a Southerner and a Christian and an honest man, to\r\ntreat niggers and dagoes and white trash like men, and be big enough to\r\nsay, 'To Hell with consequences!'\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell stared at his neighbor, speechless with bewilderment\r\nand outraged traditions. Such unbelievable heresy from a Northerner or a\r\nNegro would have been natural; but from a Southerner whose father had\r\nowned five hundred slaves--it was incredible! The other landlords\r\nscarcely listened; they were dogged and impatient and they could suggest\r\nno remedy. They could only blame the mill for their troubles.\r\n\r\nJohn Taylor left the conference blithely. \"No,\" he said to the\r\ncommittee from the new mill-workers' union. \"Can't raise wages,\r\ngentlemen, and can't lessen hours. Mill is just started and not yet\r\npaying expenses. You're getting better wages than you ever got. If you\r\ndon't want to work, quit. There are plenty of others, white and black,\r\nwho want your jobs.\"\r\n\r\nThe mention of black people as competitors for wages was like a red rag\r\nto a bull. The laborers got together and at the next election they made\r\na clean sweep, judge, sheriff, two members of the legislature, and the\r\nregistrars of votes. Undoubtedly the following year they would capture\r\nHarry Cresswell's seat in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe result was curious. From two sides, from landlord and white laborer,\r\ncame renewed oppression of black men. The laborers found that their\r\npolitical power gave them little economic advantage as long as the\r\nthreatening cloud of Negro competition loomed ahead. There was some talk\r\nof a strike, but Colton, the new sheriff, discouraged it.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, boys, where the trouble lies: it's the niggers. They live\r\non nothing and take any kind of treatment, and they keep wages down. If\r\nyou strike, they'll get your jobs, sure. We'll just have to grin and\r\nbear it a while, but get back at the darkies whenever you can. I'll\r\nstick 'em into the chain-gang every chance I get.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, inspired by fright, the grip of the landlords on the\r\nblack serfs closed with steadily increasing firmness. They saw one class\r\nrising from beneath them to power, and they tightened the chains on the\r\nother. Matters simmered on in this way, and the only party wholly\r\nsatisfied with conditions was John Taylor and the few young Southerners\r\nwho saw through his eyes. He was making money. The landlords, on the\r\ncontrary, were losing power and prestige, and their farm labor, despite\r\nstrenuous efforts, was drifting to town attracted by new and incidental\r\nwork and higher wages. The mill-hands were more and more overworked and\r\nunderpaid, and hated the Negroes for it in accordance with their\r\nleaders' directions.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the oppressed blacks and scowling mill-hands could not\r\nhelp recurring again and again to the same inarticulate thought which no\r\none was brave enough to voice. Once, however, it came out flatly. It was\r\nwhen Zora, crowding into the village courthouse to see if she could not\r\nhelp Aunt Rachel's accused boy, found herself beside a gaunt, overworked\r\nwhite woman. The woman was struggling with a crippled child and Zora,\r\nturning, lifted him carefully for the weak mother, who thanked her half\r\ntimidly. \"That mill's about killed him,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the manacled boy was led into court, and the woman\r\nsuddenly turned again to Zora.\r\n\r\n\"Durned if I don't think these white slaves and black slaves had ought\r\nter git together,\" she declared.\r\n\r\n\"I think so, too,\" Zora agreed.\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell himself caught the conversation and it struck him with\r\na certain dismay. Suppose such a conjunction should come to pass? He\r\nedged over to John Taylor and spoke to him; but Taylor, who had just\r\nsuccessfully stopped a suit for damages to the injured boy, merely\r\nshrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"What's this nigger charged with?\" demanded the Judge when the first\r\nblack boy was brought up before him.\r\n\r\n\"Breaking his labor contract.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any witnesses?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the contract here,\" announced the sheriff. \"He refuses to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"A year, or one hundred dollars.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell paid his fine, and took him in charge.\r\n\r\n\"What's the charge here?\" said the Judge, pointing to Aunt Rachel's boy.\r\n\r\n\"Attempt to kill a white man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any witnesses?\"\r\n\r\n\"None except the victim.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Zora, coming forward.\r\n\r\nBoth the sheriff and Colonel Cresswell stared at her. Of course, she was\r\nsimply a black girl but she was an educated woman, who knew things about\r\nthe Cresswell plantations that it was unnecessary to air in court. The\r\nnewly elected Judge had not yet taken his seat, and Cresswell's word was\r\nstill law in the court. He whispered to the Judge.\r\n\r\n\"Case postponed,\" said the Court.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff scowled.\r\n\r\n\"Wait till Jim gets on the bench,\" he growled.\r\n\r\nThe white bystanders, however, did not seem enthusiastic and one man--he\r\nwas a Northern spinner--spoke out plainly.\r\n\r\n\"It's none o' my business, of course. I've been fired and I'm damned\r\nglad of it. But see here: if you mutts think you're going to beat these\r\nbig blokes at their own game of cheating niggers you're daffy. You take\r\nthis from me: get together with the niggers and hold up this whole\r\ncapitalist gang. If you don't get the niggers first, they'll use 'em as\r\na club to throw you down. You hear me,\" and he departed for the train.\r\n\r\nColton was suspicious. The sentiment of joining with the Negroes did not\r\nseem to arouse the bitter resentment he expected. There even came\r\nwhispers to his ears that he had sold out to the landlords, and there\r\nwas enough truth in the report to scare him. Thus to both parties came\r\nthe uncomfortable spectre of the black men, and both sides went to work\r\nto lay the ghost.\r\n\r\nParticularly was Colonel Cresswell stirred to action. He realized that\r\nin Bles and Zora he was dealing with a younger class of educated black\r\nfolk, who were learning to fight with new weapons. They were, he was\r\nsure, as dissolute and weak as their parents, but they were shrewder and\r\nmore aspiring. They must be crushed, and crushed quickly. To this end he\r\nhad recourse to two sources of help--Johnson and the whites in town.\r\n\r\nJohnson was what Colonel Cresswell repeatedly called \"a faithful\r\nnigger.\" He was one of those constitutionally timid creatures into whom\r\nthe servility of his fathers had sunk so deep that it had become\r\nsecond-nature. To him a white man was an archangel, while the\r\nCresswells, his father's masters, stood for God. He served them with\r\ndog-like faith, asking no reward, and for what he gave in reverence to\r\nthem, he took back in contempt for his fellows--\"niggers!\" He applied\r\nthe epithet with more contempt than the Colonel himself could express.\r\nTo the Negroes he was a \"white folk's nigger,\" to be despised and\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\nTo him Colonel Cresswell gave a few pregnant directions. Then he rode to\r\ntown, and told Taylor again of his fears of a labor movement which would\r\ninclude whites and blacks. Taylor could not see any great danger.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he conceded, \"they'll eventually get together; their\r\ninterests are identical. I'll admit it's our game to delay this as long\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be delayed forever, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't be,\" was the terse response. \"But even if they do ally\r\nthemselves, our way is easy: separate the leaders, the talented, the\r\npushers, of both races from their masses, and through them rule the rest\r\nby money.\"\r\n\r\nBut Colonel Cresswell shook his head. \"It's precisely these leaders of\r\nthe Negroes that we mush crush,\" he insisted. Taylor looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was the lazy, shiftless, and criminal Negroes, you\r\nfeared?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang it, no! We can deal with them; we've got whips, chain-gangs,\r\nand--mobs, if need be--no, it's the Negro who wants to climb up that\r\nwe've got to beat to his knees.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor could not follow this reasoning. He believed in an aristocracy of\r\ntalent alone, and secretly despised Colonel Cresswell's pretensions of\r\nbirth. If a man had ability and push Taylor was willing and anxious to\r\nopen the way for him, even though he were black. The caste way of\r\nthinking in the South, both as applied to poor whites and to Negroes,\r\nhe simply could not understand. The weak and the ignorant of all races\r\nhe despised and had no patience with them. \"But others--a man's a man,\r\nisn't he?\" he persisted. But Colonel Cresswell replied:\r\n\r\n\"No, never, if he's black, and not always when he's white,\" and he\r\nstalked away.\r\n\r\nZora sensed fully the situation. She did not anticipate any immediate\r\nunderstanding with the laboring whites, but she knew that eventually it\r\nwould be inevitable. Meantime the Negro must strengthen himself and\r\nbring to the alliance as much independent economic strength as possible.\r\nFor the development of her plans she needed Bles Alwyn's constant\r\ncooperation. He was business manager of the school and was doing well,\r\nbut she wanted to point out to him the larger field. So long as she was\r\nuncertain of his attitude toward her, it was difficult to act; but now,\r\nsince the flash of the imminent tragedy at Cresswell Oaks had cleared\r\nthe air, with all its hurt a frank understanding had been made possible.\r\nThe very next day Zora chose to show Bles over her new home and grounds,\r\nand to speak frankly to him. They looked at the land, examined the\r\nproposed farm sites, and viewed the living-room and dormitory in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't seen my den,\" said Zora.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Smith is in there now; she often hides there. Come.\"\r\n\r\nHe went into the large central house and into the living-room, then out\r\non the porch, beyond which lay the kitchen. But to the left, and at the\r\nend of the porch, was a small building. It was ceiled in dark yellow\r\npine, with figured denim on the walls. A straight desk of rough hewn\r\nwood stood in the corner by the white-curtained window, and a couch and\r\ntwo large easy-chairs faced a tall narrow fireplace of uneven stone. A\r\nthick green rag-carpet covered the floor; a few pictures were on the\r\nwalls--a Madonna, a scene of mad careering horses, and some sad baby\r\nfaces. The room was a unity; things fitted together as if they belonged\r\ntogether. It was restful and beautiful, from the cheerful pine blaze\r\nbefore which Miss Smith was sitting, to the square-paned window that let\r\nin the crimson rays of gathering night. All round the room, stopping\r\nonly at the fireplace, ran low shelves of the same yellow pine, filled\r\nwith books and magazines. He scanned curiously Plato's Republic, Gorky's\r\n\"Comrades,\" a Cyclopædia of Agriculture, Balzac's novels, Spencer's\r\n\"First Principles,\" Tennyson's Poems.\r\n\r\n\"This is my university,\" Zora explained, smiling at his interested\r\nsurvey. They went out again and wandered down near the old lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Bles,\" she began, \"since we understand each other, can we not work\r\ntogether as good friends?\" She spoke simply and frankly, without\r\napparent effort, and talked on at length of her work and vision.\r\n\r\nSomehow he could not understand. His mental attitude toward Zora had\r\nalways been one of guidance, guardianship, and instruction. He had been\r\njudging and weighing her from on high, looking down upon her with\r\nthoughts of uplift and development. Always he had been holding her dark\r\nlittle hands to lead her out of the swamp of life, and always, when in\r\nsenseless anger he had half forgotten and deserted her, this vision of\r\nelder brotherhood had still remained. Now this attitude was being\r\nrevolutionized. She was proposing to him a plan of wide scope--a bold\r\nregeneration of the land. It was a plan carefully studied out, long\r\nthought of and read about. He was asked to be co-worker--nay, in a sense\r\nto be a follower, for he was ignorant of much.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. Then all at once a sense of his utter unworthiness\r\noverwhelmed him. Who was he to stand and judge this unselfish woman? Who\r\nwas he to falter when she called? A sense of his smallness and\r\nnarrowness, of his priggish blindness, rose like a mockery in his soul.\r\nOne thing alone held him back: he was not unwilling to be simply human,\r\na learner and a follower; but would he as such ever command the love and\r\nrespect of this new and inexplicable woman? Would not comradeship on the\r\nbasis of the new friendship which she insisted on, be the death of love\r\nand thoughts of love?\r\n\r\nThus he hesitated, knowing that his duty lay clear. In her direst need\r\nhe had deserted her. He had left her to go to destruction and expected\r\nthat she would. By a superhuman miracle she had risen and seated herself\r\nabove him. She was working; here was work to be done. He was asked to\r\nhelp; he would help. If it killed his old and new-born dream of love,\r\nwell and good; it was his punishment.\r\n\r\nYet the sacrifice, the readjustment was hard; he grew to it gradually,\r\ninwardly revolting, feeling always a great longing to take this woman\r\nand make her nestle in his arms as she used to; catching himself again\r\nand again on the point of speaking to her and urging, yet ever again\r\nholding himself back and bowing in silent respect to the dignity of her\r\nlife. Only now and then, when their eyes met suddenly or unthinkingly, a\r\ngreat kindling flash of flame seemed struggling behind showers of tears,\r\nuntil in a moment she smiled or spoke, and then the dropping veil left\r\nonly the frank open glance, unwavering, soft, kind, but nothing more.\r\nThen Alwyn would go wearily away, vexed or disappointed, or merely sad,\r\nand both would turn to their work again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty-six_\r\n\r\nTHE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell started all the more grimly to overthrow the new work\r\nat the school because somewhere down beneath his heart a pity and a\r\nwonder were stirring; pity at the perfectly useless struggle to raise\r\nthe unraisable, a wonder at certain signs of rising. But it was\r\nimpossible--and unthinkable, even if possible. So he squared his jaw and\r\ncheated Zora deliberately in the matter of the cut timber. He placed\r\nevery obstacle in the way of getting tenants for the school land. Here\r\nJohnson, the \"faithful nigger,\" was of incalculable assistance. He was\r\namong the first to hear the call for prospective tenants.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was in the big room of Zora's house, and Aunt Rachel came\r\nearly with her cheery voice and smile which faded so quickly to lines of\r\nsorrow and despair, and then twinkled back again. After her hobbled old\r\nSykes. Fully a half-hour later Rob hurried in.\r\n\r\n\"Johnson,\" he informed the others, \"has sneaked over to Cresswell's to\r\ntell of this meeting. We ought to beat that nigger up.\" But Zora asked\r\nhim about the new baby, and he was soon deep in child-lore. Higgins and\r\nSanders came together--dirty, apologetic, and furtive. Then came\r\nJohnson.\r\n\r\n\"How do, Miss Zora--Mr. Alwyn, I sure is glad to see you, sir. Well, if\r\nthere ain't Aunt Rachel! looking as young as ever. And Higgins, you\r\nscamp--Ah, Mr. Sanders--well, gentlemen and ladies, this sure is gwine\r\nto be a good cotton season. I remember--\" And he ran on endlessly, now\r\nto this one, now to that, now to all, his little eyes all the while\r\ndancing insinuatingly here and there. About nine o'clock a buggy drove\r\nup and Carter and Simpson came in--Carter, a silent, strong-faced, brown\r\nlaborer, who listened and looked, and Simpson, a worried nervous man,\r\nwho sat still with difficulty and commenced many sentences but did not\r\nfinish them. Alwyn looked at his watch and at Zora, but she gave no sign\r\nuntil they heard a rollicking song outside and Tylor burst into the\r\nroom. He was nearly seven feet high and broad-shouldered, yellow, with\r\ncurling hair and laughing brown eyes. He was chewing an enormous quid of\r\ntobacco, the juice of which he distributed generously, and had had just\r\nliquor enough to make him jolly. His entrance was a breeze and a roar.\r\n\r\nAlwyn then undertook to explain the land scheme.\r\n\r\n\"It is the best land in the county--\"\r\n\r\n\"When it's cl'ared,\" interrupted Johnson, and Simpson looked alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"It is partially cleared,\" continued Alwyn, \"and our plan is to sell off\r\nsmall twenty-acre farms--\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't do nothing on twenty acres--\" began Johnson, but Tylor laid\r\nhis huge hand right over his mouth and said briefly:\r\n\r\n\"Shut up!\"\r\n\r\nAlwyn started again: \"We shall sell a few twenty-acre farms but keep one\r\ncentral plantation of one hundred acres for the school. Here Miss Zora\r\nwill carry on her work and the school will run a model farm with your\r\nhelp. We want to centre here agencies to make life better. We want all\r\nsorts of industries; we want a little hospital with a resident physician\r\nand two or three nurses; we want a cooperative store for buying\r\nsupplies; we want a cotton-gin and saw-mill, and in the future other\r\nthings. This land here, as I have said, is the richest around. We want\r\nto keep this hundred acres for the public good, and not sell it. We are\r\ngoing to deed it to a board of trustees, and those trustees are to be\r\nchosen from the ones who buy the small farms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's going to get what's made on this land?\" asked Sanders.\r\n\r\n\"All of us. It is going first to pay for the land, then to support the\r\nHome and the School, and then to furnish capital for industries.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson snickered. \"You mean youse gwine to git yo' livin' off it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Alwyn; \"but I'm going to work for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's gwine--\" began Simpson, but stopped helplessly.\r\n\r\n\"Who's going to tend this land?\" asked the practical Carter.\r\n\r\n\"All of us. Each man is going to promise us so many days' work a year,\r\nand we're going to ask others to help--the women and girls and school\r\nchildren--they will all help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you put trust in that sort of help?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can when once the community learns that it pays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does you own the land?\" asked Johnson suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"No; we're buying it, and it's part paid for already.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion became general. Zora moved about among the men whispering\r\nand explaining; while Johnson moved, too, objecting and hinting. At last\r\nhe arose.\r\n\r\n\"Brethren,\" he began, \"the plan's good enough for talkin' but you can't\r\nwork it; who ever heer'd tell of such a thing? First place, the land\r\nain't yours; second place, you can't get it worked; third place, white\r\nfolks won't 'low it. Who ever heer'd of such working land on shares?\"\r\n\r\n\"You do it for white folks each day, why not for yourselves,\" Alwyn\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause we ain't white, and we can't do nothin' like that.\"\r\n\r\nTylor was asleep and snoring and the others looked doubtfully at each\r\nother. It was a proposal a little too daring for them, a bit too far\r\nbeyond their experience. One consideration alone kept them from\r\nshrinking away and that was Zora's influence. Not a man was there whom\r\nshe had not helped and encouraged nor who had not perfect faith in her;\r\nin her impetuous hope, her deep enthusiasm, and her strong will. Even\r\nher defects--the hard-held temper, the deeply rooted dislikes--caught\r\ntheir imagination.\r\n\r\nFinally, after several other meetings five men took courage--three of\r\nthe best and two of the weakest. During the Spring long negotiations\r\nwere entered into by Miss Smith to \"buy\" the five men. Colonel Cresswell\r\nand Mr. Tolliver had them all charged with large sums of indebtedness\r\nand these sums had to be assumed by the school. As Colonel Cresswell\r\ncounted over two thousand dollars of school notes and deposited them\r\nbeside the mortgage he smiled grimly for he saw the end. Yet, even then\r\nhis hand trembled and that curious doubt came creeping back. He put it\r\naside angrily and glanced up.\r\n\r\n\"Nigger wants to talk with you,\" announced his clerk.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel sauntered out and found Bles Alwyn waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Cresswell,\" he said, \"I have charge of the buying for the\r\nschool and our tenants this year and I naturally want to do the best\r\npossible. I thought I'd come over and see about getting my supplies at\r\nyour store.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right; you can get anything you want,\" said Colonel\r\nCresswell cheerily, for this to his mind was evidence of sense on the\r\npart of the Negroes. Bles showed his list of needed supplies--seeds,\r\nmeat, corn-meal, coffee, sugar, etc. The Colonel glanced over it\r\ncarelessly, then moved away.\r\n\r\n\"All right. Come and get what you want--any time,\" he called back.\r\n\r\n\"But about the prices,\" said Alwyn, following him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they'll be all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. But what I want is an estimate of your lowest cash prices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cash?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell thought a while; such a business-like proposition from Negroes\r\nsurprised him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll let you know,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a week later before Alwyn approached him again.\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here,\" said Colonel Cresswell, \"there's practically no\r\ndifference between cash and time prices. We buy our stock on time and\r\nyou can just as well take advantage of this as not. I have figured out\r\nabout what these things will cost. The best thing for you to do is to\r\nmake a deposit here and get things when you want them. If you make a\r\ngood deposit I'll throw off ten per cent, which is all of my profit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Alwyn, but he looked over the account and found the\r\nwhole bill at least twice as large as he expected. Without further\r\nparley, he made some excuse and started to town while Mr. Cresswell went\r\nto the telephone.\r\n\r\nIn town Alwyn went to all the chief merchants one after another and\r\nreceived to his great surprise practically the same estimate. He could\r\nnot understand it. He had estimated the current market prices according\r\nto the Montgomery paper, yet the prices in Toomsville were fifty to a\r\nhundred and fifty per cent higher. The merchant to whom he went last,\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know we're not going to interfere with Colonel Cresswell's\r\ntenants?\" He stated the dealers' attitude, and Alwyn saw light. He went\r\nhome and told Zora, and she listened without surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Now to business,\" she said briskly. \"Miss Smith,\" turning to the\r\nteacher, \"as I told you, they're combined against us in town and we must\r\nbuy in Montgomery. I was sure it was coming, but I wanted to give\r\nColonel Cresswell every chance. Bles starts for Montgomery--\"\r\n\r\nAlwyn looked up. \"Does he?\" he asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Zora, smiling in turn. \"We must lose no further time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's no train from Toomsville tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's one from Barton in the morning and Barton is only twenty\r\nmiles away.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a long walk.\" Alwyn thought a while, silently. Then he rose. \"I'm\r\ngoing,\" he said. \"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than a week the storehouse was full, and tenants were at work.\r\nThe twenty acres of cleared swamp land, attended to by the voluntary\r\nlabor of all the tenants, was soon bearing a magnificent crop. Colonel\r\nCresswell inspected all the crops daily with a proprietary air that\r\nwould have been natural had these folk been simply tenants, and as such\r\nhe persisted in regarding them.\r\n\r\nThe cotton now growing was perhaps not so uniformly fine as the first\r\nacre of Silver Fleece, but it was of unusual height and thickness.\r\n\r\n\"At least a bale to the acre,\" Alwyn estimated, and the Colonel mentally\r\ndetermined to take two-thirds of the crop. After that he decided that he\r\nwould evict Zora immediately; since sufficient land was cleared already\r\nfor his purposes and moreover, he had seen with consternation a herd of\r\ncattle grazing in one field on some early green stuff, and heard a drove\r\nof hogs in the swamp. Such an example before the tenants of the Black\r\nBelt would be fatal. He must wait a few weeks for them to pick the\r\ncotton--then, the end. He was fighting the battle of his color and\r\ncaste.\r\n\r\nThe children sang merrily in the brown-white field. The wide baskets,\r\npoised aloft, foamed on the erect and swaying bodies of the dark\r\ncarriers. The crop throughout the land was short that year, for prices\r\nhad ruled low last season in accordance with the policy of the Combine.\r\nThis year they started high again. Would they fall? Many thought so and\r\nhastened to sell.\r\n\r\nZora and Alwyn gathered their tenants' crops, ginned them at the\r\nCresswells' gin, and carried their cotton to town, where it was\r\ndeposited in the warehouse of the Farmers' League.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Alwyn, \"we would best sell while prices are high.\"\r\n\r\nZora laughed at him frankly.\r\n\r\n\"We can't,\" she said. \"Don't you know that Colonel Cresswell will attach\r\nour cotton for rent as soon as it touches the warehouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is ours. No black man ordinarily can sell his crop without a\r\nwhite creditor's consent.\"\r\n\r\nAlwyn fumed.\r\n\r\n\"The best way,\" he declared, \"is to go to Montgomery and get a\r\nfirst-class lawyer and just fight the thing through. The land is legally\r\nours, and he has no right to our cotton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you must remember that no man like Colonel Cresswell regards a\r\nbusiness bargain with a colored man as binding. No white man under\r\nordinary circumstances will help enforce such a bargain against\r\nprevailing public opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if we cannot trust to the justice of the case, and if you knew we\r\ncouldn't, why did you try?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I had to try; and moreover the circumstances are not altogether\r\nordinary: the men in power in Toomsville now are not the landlords of\r\nthis county; they are poor whites. The Judge and sheriff were both\r\nelected by mill-hands who hate Cresswell and Taylor. Then there's a new\r\nyoung lawyer who wants Harry Cresswell's seat in Congress; he don't know\r\nmuch law, I'm afraid; but what he don't know of this case I think I do.\r\nI'll get his advice and then--I mean to conduct the case myself,\" Zora\r\ncalmly concluded.\r\n\r\n\"Without a lawyer!\" Bles Alwyn stared his amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Without a lawyer in court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zora! That would be foolish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it? Let's think. For over a year now I've been studying the law of\r\nthe case,\" and she pointed to her law books; \"I know the law and most of\r\nthe decisions. Moreover, as a black woman fighting a hopeless battle\r\nwith landlords, I'll gain the one thing lacking.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sympathy of the court and the bystanders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! From these Southerners?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, from them. They are very human, these men, especially the\r\nlaborers. Their prejudices are cruel enough, but there are joints in\r\ntheir armor. They are used to seeing us either scared or blindly angry,\r\nand they understand how to handle us then, but at other times it is hard\r\nfor them to do anything but meet us in a human way.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Zora, think of the contact of the court, the humiliation, the\r\ncoarse talk--\"\r\n\r\nZora put up her hand and lightly touched his arm. Looking at him, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Mud doesn't hurt much. This is my duty. Let me do it.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes fell before the shadow of a deeper rebuke. He arose heavily.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he acquiesced as he passed slowly out.\r\n\r\nThe young lawyer started to refuse to touch the case until he saw--or\r\ndid Zora adroitly make him see?--a chance for eventual political\r\ncapital. They went over the matter carefully, and the lawyer acquired a\r\nrespect for the young woman's knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"First,\" he said, \"get an injunction on the cotton--then go to court.\"\r\nAnd to insure the matter he slipped over and saw the Judge.\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell next day stalked angrily into his lawyers' office.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" he thundered, handing the lawyer the notice of the\r\ninjunction.\r\n\r\n\"See the Judge,\" began the lawyer, and then remembered, as he was often\r\nforced to do these days, who was Judge.\r\n\r\nHe inquired carefully into the case and examined the papers. Then he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Cresswell, who drew this contract of sale?\"\r\n\r\n\"The black girl did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"She certainly did--wrote it in my presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's mighty well done.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean it will stand in law?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly will. There's but one way to break it, and that's to\r\nallege misunderstanding on your part.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell winced. It was not pleasant to go into open court and\r\nacknowledge himself over-reached by a Negro; but several thousand\r\ndollars in cotton and land were at stake.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead,\" he concurred.\r\n\r\n\"You can depend on Taylor, of course?\" added the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" answered Cresswell. \"But why prolong the thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, she's got your cotton tied by injunction.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how she did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy enough: this Judge is the poor white you opposed in the last\r\nprimary.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a week the case was called, and they filed into the courtroom.\r\nCresswell's lawyer saw only this black woman--no other lawyer or sign of\r\none appeared to represent her. The place soon filled with a lazy,\r\ntobacco-chewing throng of white men. A few blacks whispered in one\r\ncorner. The dirty stove was glowing with pine-wood and the Judge sat at\r\na desk.\r\n\r\n\"Where's your lawyer?\" he asked sharply of Zora.\r\n\r\n\"I have none,\" returned Zora, rising.\r\n\r\nThere came a silence in the court. Her voice was low, and the men leaned\r\nforward to listen. The Judge felt impelled to be over-gruff.\r\n\r\n\"Get a lawyer,\" he ordered.\r\n\r\n\"Your honor, my case is simple, and with your honor's permission I wish\r\nto conduct it myself. I cannot afford a lawyer, and I do not think I\r\nneed one.\"\r\n\r\nCresswell's lawyer smiled and leaned back. It was going to be easier\r\nthan he supposed. Evidently the woman believed she had no case, and was\r\nweakening.\r\n\r\nThe trial proceeded, and Zora stated her contention. She told how long\r\nher mother and grandmother had served the Cresswells and showed her\r\nreceipt for rent paid.\r\n\r\n\"A friend sent me some money. I went to Mr. Cresswell and asked him to\r\nsell me two hundred acres of land. He consented to do so and signed this\r\ncontract in the presence of his son-in-law.\"\r\n\r\nJust then John Taylor came into the court, and Cresswell beckoned to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to help me out, John.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" whispered Taylor. \"What can I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swear that Cresswell didn't mean to sign this,\" said the lawyer\r\nquickly, as he arose to address the court.\r\n\r\nTaylor looked at the paper blankly and then at Cresswell and some\r\ninkling of the irreconcilable difference in the two natures leapt in\r\nboth their hearts. Cresswell might gamble and drink and lie \"like a\r\ngentleman,\" but he would never willingly cheat or take advantage of a\r\nwhite man's financial necessities. Taylor, on the other hand, had a\r\nhorror of a lie, never drank nor played games of chance, but his whole\r\nlife was speculation and in the business game he was utterly ruthless\r\nand respected no one. Such men could never thoroughly understand each\r\nother. To Cresswell a man who had cheated the whole South out of\r\nmillions by a series of misrepresentations ought to regard this little\r\nfalsehood as nothing.\r\n\r\nMeantime Colonel Cresswell's lawyer was on his feet, and he adopted his\r\nmost irritating and contemptuous manner.\r\n\r\n\"This nigger wench wrote out some illegible stuff and Colonel Cresswell\r\nsigned it to get rid of her. We are not going to question the legality\r\nof the form--that's neither here nor there. The point is, Mr. Cresswell\r\nnever intended--never dreamed of selling this wench land right in front\r\nof his door. He meant to rent her the land and sign a receipt for rent\r\npaid in advance. I will not worry your honor by a long argument to\r\nprove this, but just call one of the witnesses well known to you--Mr.\r\nJohn Taylor of the Toomsville mills.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor looked toward the door and then slowly took the stand.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Taylor,\" said the lawyer carelessly, \"were you present at this\r\ntransaction?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see Colonel Cresswell sign this paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, did he intend so far as you know to sign such a paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know his intentions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he say he meant to sign such a contract?\"\r\n\r\nTaylor hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he finally answered. Colonel Cresswell looked up in amazement and\r\nthe lawyer dropped his glasses.\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't think you perhaps understood me, Mr. Taylor,\" he gasped.\r\n\"I--er--meant to ask if Colonel Cresswell, in signing this paper, meant\r\nto sign a contract to sell this wench two hundred acres of land?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said he did,\" reiterated Taylor. \"Although I ought to add that he\r\ndid not think the girl would ever be able to pay. If he had thought she\r\nwould pay, I don't think he would have signed the paper.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell went red, than pale, and leaning forward before the\r\nwhole court, he hurled:\r\n\r\n\"You damned scoundrel!\"\r\n\r\nThe Judge rapped for order and fidgeted in his seat. There was some\r\nconfusion and snickering in the courtroom. Finally the Judge plucked up\r\ncourage:\r\n\r\n\"The defendant is ordered to deliver this cotton to Zora Cresswell,\" he\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nThe raging of Colonel Cresswell's anger now turned against John Taylor\r\nas well as the Negroes. Wind of the estrangement flew over town quickly.\r\nThe poor whites saw a chance to win Taylor's influence and the sheriff\r\napproached him cautiously. Taylor paid him slight courtesy. He was\r\nirritated with this devilish Negro problem; he was making money; his\r\nwife and babies were enjoying life, and here was this fool trial to\r\nupset matters. But the sheriff talked.\r\n\r\n\"The thing I'm afraid of,\" he said, \"is that Cresswell and his gang will\r\nswing in the niggers on us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let 'em vote.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they'd have to read and write.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Taylor, \"it might be a good thing.\"\r\n\r\nColton eyed him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"You'd let a nigger vote?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, if he had sense enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"There ain't no nigger got sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pshaw!\" Taylor ejaculated, walking away.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff was angry and mistrustful. He believed he had discovered a\r\ndeep-laid scheme of the aristocrats to cultivate friendliness between\r\nwhites and blacks, and then use black voters to crush the whites. Such a\r\ncourse was, in Colton's mind, dangerous, monstrous, and unnatural; it\r\nmust be stopped at all hazards. He began to whisper among his friends.\r\nOne or two meetings were held, and the flame of racial prejudice was\r\nstudiously fanned.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the town and country quickly began to change. Whatever\r\nlittle beginnings of friendship and understanding had arisen now quickly\r\ndisappeared. The town of a Saturday no longer belonged to a happy,\r\ncareless crowd of black peasants, but the black folk found themselves\r\nelbowed to the gutter, while ugly quarrels flashed here and there with a\r\nquick arrest of the Negroes.\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell made a sudden resolve. He sent for the sheriff and\r\nreceived him at the Oaks, in his most respectable style, filling him\r\nwith good food, and warming him with good liquor.\r\n\r\n\"Colton,\" he asked, \"are you sending any of your white children to the\r\nnigger school yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" yelled Colton.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel laughed, frankly telling Colton John Taylor's philosophy on\r\nthe race problem,--his willingness to let Negroes vote; his threat to\r\nlet blacks and whites work together; his contempt for the officials\r\nelected by the people.\r\n\r\n\"Candidly, Colton,\" he concluded, \"I believe in aristocracy. I can't\r\nthink it right or wise to replace the old aristocracy by new and untried\r\nblood.\" And in a sudden outburst--\"But, by God, sir! I'm a white man,\r\nand I place the lowest white man ever created above the highest darkey\r\never thought of. This Yankee, Taylor, is a nigger-lover. He's secretly\r\nencouraging and helping them. You saw what he did to me, and I'm warning\r\nyou in time.\"\r\n\r\nColton's glass dropped.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was you that was corralling the niggers against us,\" he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel reddened. \"I don't count all white men my equals, I admit,\"\r\nhe returned with dignity, \"but I know the difference between a white man\r\nand a nigger.\"\r\n\r\nColton stretched out his massive hand. \"Put it there, sir,\" said he; \"I\r\nmisjudged you, Colonel Cresswell. I'm a Southerner, and I honor the old\r\naristocracy you represent. I'm going to join with you to crush this\r\nYankee and put the niggers in their places. They are getting impudent\r\naround here; they need a lesson and, by gad! they'll get one they'll\r\nremember.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here, Colton,--nothing rash,\" the Colonel charged him,\r\nwarningly. \"Don't stir up needless trouble; but--well, things must\r\nchange.\"\r\n\r\nColton rose and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"The niggers need a lesson,\" he muttered as he unsteadily bade his host\r\ngood-bye. Cresswell watched him uncomfortably as he rode away, and\r\nagain a feeling of doubt stirred within him. What new force was he\r\nloosening against his black folk--his own black folk, who had lived\r\nabout him and his fathers nigh three hundred years? He saw the huge form\r\nof the sheriff loom like an evil spirit a moment on the rise of the road\r\nand sink into the night. He turned slowly to his cheerless house\r\nshuddering as he entered the uninviting portals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty-seven_\r\n\r\nTHE MOB\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Emma, Bertie's child, came home after a two years' course of study,\r\nshe had passed from girlhood to young womanhood. She was white, and\r\nsandy-haired. She was not beautiful, and she appeared to be fragile; but\r\nshe also looked sweet and good, with that peculiar innocence which peers\r\nout upon the world with calm, round eyes and sees no evil, but does\r\nmethodically its simple, everyday work. Zora mothered her, Miss Smith\r\nfound her plenty to do, and Bles thought her a good girl. But Mrs.\r\nCresswell found her perfect, and began to scheme to marry her off. For\r\nMary Cresswell, with the restlessness and unhappiness of an unemployed\r\nwoman, was trying to atone for her former blunders.\r\n\r\nHer humiliation after the episode at Cresswell Oaks had been complete.\r\nIt seemed to her that the original cause of her whole life punishment\r\nlay in her persistent misunderstanding of the black people and their\r\nproblem. Zora appeared to her in a new and glorified light--a vigorous,\r\nself-sacrificing woman. She knew that Zora had refused to marry Bles,\r\nand this again seemed fitting. Zora was not meant for marrying; she was\r\na born leader, wedded to a great cause; she had long outgrown the boy\r\nand girl affection. She was the sort of woman she herself might have\r\nbeen if she had not married.\r\n\r\nAlwyn, on the other hand, needed a wife; he was a great, virile boy,\r\nrequiring a simple, affectionate mate. No sooner did she see Emma than\r\nshe was sure that this was the ideal wife. She compared herself with\r\nHelen Cresswell. Helen was a contented wife and mother because she was\r\nfitted for the position, and happy in it; while she who had aimed so\r\nhigh had fallen piteously. From such a fate she would save Zora and\r\nBles.\r\n\r\nEmma's course in nurse-training had been simple and short and there was\r\nno resident physician; but Emma, in her unemotional way, was a born\r\nnurse and did much good among the sick in the neighborhood. Zora had a\r\nsmall log hospital erected with four white beds, a private room, and an\r\noffice which was also Emma's bedroom. The new white physician in town,\r\njust fresh from school in Atlanta, became interested and helped with\r\nadvice and suggestions.\r\n\r\nMeantime John Taylor's troubles began to increase. Under the old\r\npolitical regime it had been an easy matter to avoid serious\r\ndamage-suits for the accidents in the mill. Much child labor and the\r\nlack of protective devices made accidents painfully frequent. Taylor\r\ninsisted that the chief cause was carelessness, while the mill hands\r\nalleged criminal neglect on his part. When the new labor officials took\r\ncharge of the court and the break occurred between Colonel Cresswell and\r\nhis son-in-law, Taylor found that several damage-suits were likely to\r\ncost him a considerable sum.\r\n\r\nHe determined not to let the bad feelings go too far, and when a\r\nparticularly distressing accident to a little girl took place, he showed\r\nmore than his usual interest and offered to care for her. The new young\r\nphysician recommended Zora's infirmary as the only near place that\r\noffered a chance for the child's recovery.\r\n\r\n\"Take her out,\" Taylor promptly directed.\r\n\r\nZora was troubled when the child came. She knew the suspicious temper of\r\nthe town whites. The very next day Taylor sent out a second case, a\r\nchild who had been hurt some time before and was not recovering as she\r\nshould. Under the care of the little hospital and the gentle nurse the\r\nchildren improved rapidly, and in two weeks were outdoors, playing with\r\nthe little black children and even creeping into classrooms and\r\nlistening. The grateful mothers came out twice a week at least; at first\r\nwith suspicious aloofness, but gradually melting under Zora's tact until\r\nthey sat and talked with her and told their troubles and struggles. Zora\r\nrealized how human they were, and how like their problems were to hers.\r\nThey and their children grew to love this busy, thoughtful woman, and\r\nZora's fears were quieted.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe came suddenly. The sheriff rode by, scowling and hunting\r\nfor some poor black runaway, when he saw white children in the Negro\r\nschool and white women, whom he knew were mill-hands, looking on. He was\r\nblack with anger; turning he galloped back to town. A few hours later\r\nthe young physician arrived hastily in a cab to take the women and\r\nchildren to town. He said something in a low tone to Zora and drove\r\naway, frowning.\r\n\r\nZora came quickly to the school and asked for Alwyn. He was in the barn\r\nand she hurried there.\r\n\r\n\"Bles,\" she said quietly, \"it is reported that a Toomsville mob will\r\nburn the school tonight.\"\r\n\r\nBles stood motionless.\r\n\r\n\"I've been fearing it. The sheriff has been stirring up the worst\r\nelements in the town lately and the mills pay off tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she said quietly, \"we must prepare.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, his face aglow with admiration.\r\n\r\n\"You wonder-woman!\" he exclaimed softly.\r\n\r\nA moment they regarded each other. She saw the love in his eyes, and he\r\nsaw rising in hers something that made his heart bound. But she turned\r\nquickly away.\r\n\r\n\"You must hurry, Bles; lives are at stake.\" And in another moment he\r\nthundered out of the barn on the black mare.\r\n\r\nAlong the pike he flew and up the plantation roads. Across broad fields\r\nand back again, over to the Barton pike and along the swamp. At every\r\ncabin he whispered a word, and left behind him grey faces and whispering\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nHis horse was reeking with sweat as he staggered again into the\r\nschool-yard; but already the people were gathering, with frightened,\r\nanxious, desperate faces. Women with bundles and children, men with\r\nguns, tottering old folks, wide-eyed boys and girls. Up from the swamp\r\nland came the children crying and moaning. The sun was setting. The\r\nwomen and children hurried into the school building, closing the doors\r\nand windows. A moment Alwyn stood without and looked back. The world was\r\npeaceful. He could hear the whistle of birds and the sobbing of the\r\nbreeze in the shadowing oaks. The sky was flashing to dull and purplish\r\nblue, and over all lay the twilight hush as though God did not care.\r\n\r\nHe threw back his head and clenched his hands. His soul groaned within\r\nhim. \"Heavenly Father, was man ever before set to such a task?\" Fight?\r\nGod! if he could but fight! If he could but let go the elemental\r\npassions that were leaping and gathering and burning in the eyes of\r\nyonder caged and desperate black men. But his hands were tied--manacled.\r\nOne desperate struggle, a whirl of blood, and the whole world would rise\r\nto crush him and his people. The white operatore in yonder town had but\r\nto flash the news, \"Negroes killing whites,\" to bring all the country,\r\nall the State, all the nation, to red vengeance. It mattered not what\r\nthe provocation, what the desperate cause.\r\n\r\nThe door suddenly opened behind him and he wheeled around.\r\n\r\n\"Zora!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Bles,\" she answered softly, and they went silently in to their people.\r\n\r\nAll at once, from floor to roof, the whole school-house was lighted up,\r\nsave a dark window here and there. Then some one slipped out into the\r\ndarkness and soon watch-fire after watch-fire flickered and flamed in\r\nthe night, and then burned vividly, sending up sparks and black smoke.\r\nThus ringed with flaming silence, the school lay at the edge of the\r\ngreat, black swamp and waited. Owls hooted in the forest. Afar the\r\nshriek of the Montgomery train was heard across the night, mingling with\r\nthe wail of a wakeful babe; and then redoubled silence. The men became\r\nrestless, and Johnson began to edge away toward the lower hall. Alwyn\r\nwas watching him when a faint noise came to him on the eastern breeze--a\r\nlow, rumbling murmur. It died away, and rose again; then a distant\r\ngun-shot woke the echoes.\r\n\r\n\"They're coming!\" he cried. Standing back in the shadow of a front\r\nwindow, he waited. Slowly, intermittently, the murmuring swelled, till\r\nit grew distinguishable as yelling, cursing, and singing, intermingled\r\nwith the crash of pistol-shots. Far away a flame, as of a burning cabin,\r\narose, and a wilder, louder yell greeted it. Now the tramp of footsteps\r\ncould be heard, and clearer and thicker the grating and booming of\r\nvoices, until suddenly, far up the pike, a black moving mass, with\r\nglitter and shout, swept into view. They came headlong, guided by\r\npine-torches, which threw their white and haggard faces into wild\r\ndistortion. Then as bonfire after bonfire met their gaze, they moved\r\nslowly and more slowly, and at last sent a volley of bullets at the\r\nfires. One bullet flew high and sang through a lighted window. Without a\r\nword, Uncle Isaac sank upon the floor and lay still. Silence and renewed\r\nmurmuring ensued, and the sound of high voices in dispute. Then the mass\r\ndivided into two wings and slowly encircled the fence of fire; starting\r\nnoisily and confidently, and then going more slowly, quietly, warily, as\r\nthe silence of the flame began to tell on their heated nerves.\r\n\r\nStrained whispers arose.\r\n\r\n\"Careful there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, damn ye!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's some one by yon fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there ain't.\"\r\n\r\n\"See the bushes move.\"\r\n\r\n_Bang! bang! bang!_\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's rush through and fire the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"And leave a pa'cel of niggers behind to shoot your lights out? Not me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the hell are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could see a nigger.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Hark!\"_\r\n\r\nStealthy steps were approaching, a glint of steel flashed behind the\r\nfire lights. Each band mistook the other for the armed Negroes, and the\r\nleaders yelled in vain; human power can not stay the dashing torrent of\r\nfear-inspired human panic. Whirling, the mob fled till it struck the\r\nroad in two confused, surging masses. Then in quick frenzy, shots flew;\r\nthree men threw up their hands and tumbled limply in the dust, while the\r\nmain body rushed pellmell toward town.\r\n\r\nAt early dawn, when the men relaxed from the strain of the night's\r\nvigil, Alwyn briefly counselled them: \"Hide your guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" blustered Rob. \"Haven't I a right to have a gun?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have, Rob; but don't be foolish--hide it. We've not heard the\r\nlast of this.\"\r\n\r\nBut Rob tossed his head belligerently.\r\n\r\nIn town, rumor spread like wildfire. A body of peaceful whites passing\r\nthrough the black settlement had been fired on from ambush, and six\r\nkilled--no, three killed--no, one killed and two severely wounded.\r\n\r\n\"The thing mustn't stop here,\" shouted Sheriff Colton; \"these niggers\r\nmust have a lesson.\" And before nine next morning fully half the grown\r\nmembers of the same mob, now sworn in as deputies, rode with him to\r\nsearch the settlement. They tramped insolently through the school\r\ngrounds, but there was no shred of evidence until they came to Rob's\r\ncabin and found his gun. They tied his hands behind him and marched him\r\ntoward town.\r\n\r\nBut before the mob arrived the night before, Johnson feeling that his\r\nsafety lay in informing the white folks, had crawled with his gun into\r\nthe swamp. In the morning he peered out as the cavalcade approached, and\r\nnot knowing what had happened, he recognized Colton, the sheriff, and\r\nsignalled to him cautiously. In a moment a dozen men were on him, and he\r\nappealed and explained in vain--the gun was damning evidence. The voices\r\nof Rob's wife and children could be heard behind the two men as they\r\nwere hurried along at a dog trot.\r\n\r\nThe town poured out to greet them--\"The murderers! the murderers! Kill\r\nthe niggers!\" and they came on with a rush. The sheriff turned and\r\ndisappeared in the rear. There was a great cloud of dust, a cry and a\r\nwild scramble, as the white and angry faces of men and boys gleamed a\r\nmoment and faded.\r\n\r\nA hundred or more shots rang out; then slowly and silently, the mass of\r\nwomen and men were sucked into the streets of the town, leaving but\r\nblack eddies on the corners to throw backward glances toward the bare,\r\ntowering pine where swung two red and awful things. The pale boy-face of\r\none, with soft brown eyes glared up sightless to the sun; the dead,\r\nleathered bronze of the other was carved in piteous terror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty-eight_\r\n\r\nATONEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months had flown. It was Spring again, and Zora sat in the\r\ntransformed swamp--now a swamp in name only--beneath the great oak,\r\ndreaming. And what she dreamed there in the golden day she dared not\r\nformulate even to her own soul. She rose with a start, for there was\r\nwork to do. Aunt Rachel was ill, and Emma went daily to attend her;\r\ntoday, as she came back, she brought news that Colonel Cresswell, who\r\nhad been unwell for several days, was worse. She must send Emma up to\r\nhelp, and as she started toward the school she glanced toward the\r\nCresswell Oaks and saw the arm-chair of its master on the pillared\r\nporch.\r\n\r\nColonel Cresswell sat in his chair on the porch, alone. As far as he\r\ncould see, there was no human soul. His eyes were blood-shot, his cheeks\r\nsunken, and his breath came in painful gasps. A sort of terror shook\r\nhim until he heard the distant songs of black folk in the fields. He\r\nsighed, and lying back, closed his eyes and the breath came easier. When\r\nhe opened them again a white figure was coming up the avenue of the\r\nOaks. He watched it greedily. It was Mary Cresswell, and she started\r\nwhen she saw him.\r\n\r\n\"You are worse, father?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Worse and better,\" he replied, smiling cynically. Then suddenly he\r\nannounced: \"I've made my will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--why--\" she stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" sharply. \"Because I'm going to die.\"\r\n\r\nShe said nothing. He smiled and continued:\r\n\r\n\"I've got it all fixed. Harry was in a tight place--gambling as\r\nusual--and I gave him a lump sum in lieu of all claims. Then I gave John\r\nTaylor--you needn't look. I sent for him. He's a damned scoundrel; but\r\nhe won't lie, and I needed him. I willed his children all the rest\r\nexcept two or three legacies. One was one hundred thousand dollars for\r\nyou--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father!\" she cried. \"I don't deserve it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon two years with Harry was worth about that much,\" he returned\r\ngrimly. \"Then there's another gift of two hundred thousand dollars and\r\nthis house and plantation. Whom do you think that's for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Helen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Helen!\" he raised his hand in threatening anger. \"I might rot here for\r\nall she cares. No--no--but then--I'll not tell you--I--ah--\" A spasm of\r\npain shot across his face, and he lay back white and still. Abruptly he\r\nsat up again and peered down the oaks. \"Hush!\" he gasped. \"Who's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--it's a girl--I--\"\r\n\r\nHe gripped her till she winced.\r\n\r\n\"My God--it walks--like my wife--I tell you--she held her head so--who\r\nis it?\" He half rose.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father, it's nobody but Emma--little Emma--Bertie's child--the\r\nmulatto girl. She's a nurse now, and I asked to have her come and attend\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"oh--\" He looked at the girl curiously. \"Come here.\" He\r\npeered into her white young face. \"Do you know me?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl shrank away from him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I teach and nurse at the school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Well, I'm going to give you some money--do you know why?\"\r\n\r\nA flash of self-consciousness passed over the girl's face; she looked at\r\nhim with her wide blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Grandfather,\" she faltered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cresswell rose to her feet; but the old man slowly dropped the\r\ngirl's hand and lay back in his chair, with lips half smiling.\r\n\"Grandfather,\" he repeated softly. He closed his eyes a space and then\r\nopened them. A tremor shivered in his limbs as he stared darkly at the\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" he cried harshly. \"Do you hear the bodies creaking on the limbs?\r\nIt's Rob and Johnson. I did it--I--\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he rose and stood erect and his wild eyes stricken with death\r\nstared full upon Emma. Slowly and thickly he spoke, working his\r\ntrembling hands.\r\n\r\n\"Nell--Nell! Is it you, little wife, come back to accuse me? Ah, Nell,\r\ndon't shrink! I know--I have sinned against the light and the blood of\r\nyour poor black people is red on these old hands. No, don't put your\r\nclean white hands upon me, Nell, till I wash mine. I'll do it, Nell;\r\nI'll atone. I'm a Cresswell yet, Nell, a Cresswell and a gen--\" He\r\nswayed. Vainly he struggled for the word. The shudder of death shook his\r\nsoul, and he passed.\r\n\r\nA week after the funeral of Colonel Cresswell, John Taylor drove out to\r\nthe school and was closeted with Miss Smith. His sister, installed once\r\nagain for a few days in her old room at the school, understood that he\r\nwas conferring about Emma's legacy, and she was glad. She was more and\r\nmore convinced that the marriage of Emma and Bles was the best possible\r\nsolution of many difficulties. She had asked Emma once if she liked\r\nBles, and Emma had replied in her innocent way,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so much.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Bles, he was often saying what a dear child Emma was. Neither\r\nperhaps realized yet that this was love, but it needed, Mrs. Cresswell\r\nwas sure, only the lightning-flash, and they would know. And who could\r\nfurnish that illumination better than Zora, the calm, methodical Zora,\r\nwho knew them so well?\r\n\r\nAs for herself, once she had accomplished the marriage and paid the\r\nmortgage on the school out of her legacy, she would go abroad and in\r\ntravel seek forgetfulness and healing. There had been no formal divorce,\r\nand so far as she was concerned there never would be; but the separation\r\nfrom her husband and America would be forever.\r\n\r\nHer brother came out of the office, nodded casually, for they had little\r\nintercourse these days, and rode away. She rushed in to Miss Smith and\r\nfound her sitting there--straight, upright, composed in all save that\r\nthe tears were streaming down her face and she was making no effort to\r\nstop them.\r\n\r\n\"Why--Miss Smith!\" she faltered.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith pointed to a paper. Mrs. Cresswell picked it up curiously. It\r\nwas an official notification to the trustees of the Smith School of a\r\nlegacy of two hundred thousand dollars together with the Cresswell house\r\nand plantation. Mrs. Gresswell sat down in open-mouthed astonishment.\r\nTwice she tried to speak, but there were so many things to say that she\r\ncould not choose.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Zora,\" Miss Smith at last managed to say.\r\n\r\nZora was dreaming again. Somehow, the old dream-life, with its glorious\r\nphantasies, had come silently back, richer and sweeter than ever. There\r\nwas no tangible reason why, and yet today she had shut herself in her\r\nden. Searching down in the depths of her trunk, she drew forth that\r\nfilmy cloud of white--silk-bordered and half finished to a gown. Why\r\nwere her eyes wet today and her mind on the Silver Fleece? It was an\r\nanniversary, and perhaps she still remembered that moment, that supreme\r\nmoment before the mob. She half slipped on, half wound about her, the\r\nwhite cloud of cloth, standing with parted lips, looking into the long\r\nmirror and gleaming in the fading day like midnight gowned in mists and\r\nstars. Abruptly there came a peremptory knocking at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Zora! Zora!\" sounded Mrs. Cresswell's voice. Forgetting her informal\r\nattire, she opened the door, fearing some mishap. Mrs. Cresswell poured\r\nout the news. Zora received it in such motionless silence that Mary\r\nwondered at her want of feeling. At last, however, she said happily to\r\nZora:\r\n\r\n\"Well, the battle's over, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's just begun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just begun?\" echoed Mary in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Think of the servile black folk, the half awakened restless whites, the\r\nfat land waiting for the harvest, the masses panting to know--why, the\r\nbattle is scarcely even begun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess that's so,\" Mary began to comprehend. \"We'll thank God it\r\nhas begun, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" Zora reverently repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Come, let's go back to poor, dear Miss Smith,\" suggested Mary.\r\n\r\n\"I can't come just now--but pretty soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Oh, I see; you're trying on something--how pretty and becoming!\r\nWell, hurry.\"\r\n\r\nAs they stood together, the white woman deemed the moment opportune; she\r\nslipped her arm about the black woman's waist and began:\r\n\r\n\"Zora, I've had something on my mind for a long time, and I shouldn't\r\nwonder if you had thought of the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bles and Emma.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Their liking for each other.\"\r\n\r\nZora bent a moment and caught up the folds of the Fleece.\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't noticed it,\" she said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're busy, you see. They've been very much together--his taking\r\nher to her charges, bringing her back, and all that. I know they love\r\neach other; yet something holds them apart, afraid to show their love.\r\nDo you know--I've wondered if--quite unconciously, it is you? You know\r\nBles used to imagine himself in love with you, just as he did afterward\r\nwith Miss Wynn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss--Wynn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the Washington girl. But he got over that and you straightened him\r\nout finally. Still, Emma probably thinks yours is the prior claim,\r\nknowing, of course, nothing of facts. And Bles knows she thinks of him\r\nand you, and I'm convinced if you say the word, they'd love and marry.\"\r\n\r\nZora walked silently with her to the door, where, looking out, she saw\r\nBles and Emma coming from Aunt Rachel's. He was helping her from the\r\ncarriage with smiling eyes, and her innocent blue eyes were fastened on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nZora looked long and searchingly.\r\n\r\n\"Please run and tell them of the legacy,\" she begged. \"I--I will\r\ncome--in a moment.\" And Mrs. Cresswell hurried out.\r\n\r\nZora turned back steadily to her room, and locked herself in. After all,\r\nwhy shouldn't it be? Why had it not occurred to her before in her\r\nblindness? If she had wanted him--and ah, God! was not all her life\r\nsimply the want of him?--why had she not bound him to her when he had\r\noffered himself? Why had she not bound him to her? She knew as she\r\nasked--because she had wanted all, not a part--everything, love, respect\r\nand perfect faith--not one thing could she spare then--not one thing.\r\nAnd now, oh, God! she had dreamed that it was all hers, since that night\r\nof death and circling flame when they looked at each other soul to soul.\r\nBut he had not meant anything. It was pity she had seen there, not love;\r\nand she rose and walked the room slowly, fast and faster.\r\n\r\nWith trembling hands she drew the Silver Fleece round her. Her head swam\r\nagain and the blood flashed in her eyes. She heard a calling in the\r\nswamp, and the shadow of Elspeth seemed to hover over her, claiming her\r\nfor her own, dragging her down, down.... She rushed through the swamp.\r\nThe lagoon lay there before her presently, gleaming in the\r\ndarkness--cold and still, and in it swam an awful shape.\r\n\r\nShe held her burning head--was not everything plain? Was not everything\r\nclear? This was Sacrifice! This was the Atonement for the unforgiven\r\nsin. Emma's was the pure soul which she must offer up to God; for it was\r\nGod, a cold and mighty God, who had given it to Bles--her Bles. It was\r\nwell; God willed it. But could she live? Must she live? Did God ask\r\nthat, too?\r\n\r\nAll at once she stood straight; her whole body grew tense, alert. She\r\nheard no sound behind her, but knew he was there, and braced herself.\r\nShe must be true. She must be just. She must pay the uttermost farthing.\r\n\r\n\"Bles,\" she called faintly, but did not turn her head.\r\n\r\n\"Zora!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bles,\" she choked, but her voice came stronger, \"I know--all. Emma is a\r\ngood girl. I helped bring her up myself and did all I could for her and\r\nshe--she is pure; marry her.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice came slow and firm:\r\n\r\n\"Emma? But I don't love Emma. I love--some one else.\"\r\n\r\nHer heart bounded and again was still. It was that Washington girl then.\r\nShe answered dully, groping for words, for she was tired:\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The best woman in all the world, Zora.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is\"--she struggled at the word madly--\"is she pure?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is more than pure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must marry her, Bles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not worthy of her,\" he answered, sinking before her.\r\n\r\nThen at last illumination dawned upon her blindness. She stood very\r\nstill and lifted up her eyes. The swamp was living, vibrant, tremulous.\r\nThere where the first long note of night lay shot with burning crimson,\r\nburst in sudden radiance the wide beauty of the moon. There pulsed a\r\nglory in the air. Her little hands groped and wandered over his\r\nclose-curled hair, and she sobbed, deep voiced:\r\n\r\n\"Will you--marry me, Bles?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              L'ENVOI\r\n\r\n     Lend me thine ears, O God the Reader, whose Fathers aforetime sent\r\n     mine down into the land of Egypt, into this House of Bondage. Lay\r\n     not these words aside for a moment's phantasy, but lift up thine\r\n     eyes upon the Horror in this land;--the maiming and mocking and\r\n     murdering of my people, and the prisonment of their souls. Let my\r\n     people go, O Infinite One, lest the world shudder at\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The End\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Quest of the Silver Fleece, by W.
