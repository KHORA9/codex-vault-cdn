Around Ozma's throne, on such occasions, are grouped all\r\nthe important personages of Oz, such as the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead,\r\nTiktok the Clockwork Man, the Tin Woodman, the Wizard of Oz, the Shaggy\r\nMan and other famous fairy people. Little Dorothy usually has a seat at\r\nOzma's feet, and crouched on either side the throne are two enormous\r\nbeasts known as the Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese two beasts are Ozma's chief guardians, but as everyone loves the\r\nbeautiful girl Princess there has never been any disturbance in the\r\ngreat Throne Room, or anything for the guardians to do but look fierce\r\nand solemn and keep quiet until the Royal Audience is over and the\r\npeople go away to their homes.\r\n\r\nOf course no one would dare be naughty while the huge Lion and Tiger\r\ncrouched beside the throne; but the fact is, the people of Oz are very\r\nseldom naughty. So Ozma's big guards are more ornamental than useful,\r\nand no one realizes that better than the beasts themselves.\r\n\r\nOne day, after everybody had left the Throne Room except the Cowardly\r\nLion and the Hungry Tiger, the Lion yawned and said to his friend:\r\n\r\n\"I'm getting tired of this job. No one is afraid of us and no one pays\r\nany attention to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" replied the big Tiger, purring softly. \"We might as well\r\nbe in the thick jungles where we were born, as trying to protect Ozma\r\nwhen she needs no protection. And I'm dreadfully hungry all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have enough to eat, I'm sure,\" said the Lion, swaying his tail\r\nslowly back and forth.\r\n\r\n\"Enough, perhaps; but not the kind of food I long for,\" answered the\r\nTiger. \"What I'm hungry for is fat babies. I have a great desire to eat\r\na few fat babies. Then, perhaps, the people of Oz would fear me and I'd\r\nbecome more important.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"True,\" agreed the Lion. \"It would stir up quite a rumpus if you ate but\r\n_one_ fat baby. As for myself; my claws are sharp as needles and strong\r\nas crowbars, while my teeth are powerful enough to tear a person to\r\npieces in a few seconds. If I should spring upon a man and make chop\r\nsuey of him, there would be wild excitement in the Emerald City and the\r\npeople would fall upon their knees and beg me for mercy. That, in my\r\nopinion, would render me of considerable importance.\"\r\n\r\n\"After you had torn the person to pieces, what would you do next?\" asked\r\nthe Tiger sleepily.\r\n\r\n\"Then I would roar so loudly it would shake the earth and stalk away to\r\nthe jungle to hide myself, before anyone could attack me or kill me for\r\nwhat I had done.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" nodded the Tiger. \"You are really cowardly.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure. That is why I am named the Cowardly Lion. That is why I\r\nhave always been so tame and peaceable. But I'm awfully tired of being\r\ntame,\" added the Lion, with a sigh, \"and it would be fun to raise a row\r\nand show people what a terrible beast I really am.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tiger remained silent for several minutes, thinking deeply as he\r\nslowly washed his face with his left paw. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\"I'm getting old, and it would please me to eat at least one fat baby\r\nbefore I die. Suppose we surprise these people of Oz and prove our\r\npower. What do you say? We will walk out of here just as usual and the\r\nfirst baby we meet I'll eat in a jiffy, and the first man or woman you\r\nmeet you will tear to pieces. Then we will both run out of the city\r\ngates and gallop across the country and hide in the jungle before anyone\r\ncan stop us.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; I'm game,\" said the Lion, yawning again so that he showed\r\ntwo rows of dreadfully sharp teeth.\r\n\r\nThe Tiger got up and stretched his great, sleek body.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" he said. The Lion stood up and proved he was the larger of\r\nthe two, for he was almost as big as a small horse.\r\n\r\nOut of the palace they walked, and met no one. They passed through the\r\nbeautiful grounds, past fountains and beds of lovely flowers, and met no\r\none. Then they unlatched a gate and entered a street of the city, and\r\nmet no one.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how a fat baby will taste,\" remarked the Tiger, as they\r\nstalked majestically along, side by side.\r\n\r\n\"I imagine it will taste like nutmegs,\" said the Lion.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Tiger, \"I've an idea it will taste like gumdrops.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned a corner, but met no one, for the people of the Emerald City\r\nwere accustomed to take their naps at this hour of the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how many pieces I ought to tear a person into,\" said the Lion,\r\nin a thoughtful voice.\r\n\r\n\"Sixty would be about right,\" suggested the Tiger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Would that hurt any more than to tear one into about a dozen pieces?\"\r\ninquired the Lion, with a little shudder.\r\n\r\n\"Who cares whether it hurts or not?\" growled the Tiger.\r\n\r\nThe Lion did not reply. They entered a side street, but met no one.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they heard a child crying.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" exclaimed the Tiger. \"There is my meat.\"\r\n\r\nHe rushed around a corner, the Lion following, and came upon a nice fat\r\nbaby sitting in the middle of the street and crying as if in great\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked the Tiger, crouching before the baby.\r\n\r\n\"I--I--I-lost my m-m-mamma!\" wailed the baby.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you poor little thing,\" said the great beast, softly stroking the\r\nchild's head with its paw. \"Don't cry, my dear, for mamma can't be far\r\naway and I'll help you to find her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said the Lion, who stood by.\r\n\r\n\"Go on where?\" asked the Tiger, looking up.\r\n\r\n\"Go on and eat your fat baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you dreadful creature!\" said the Tiger reproachfully; \"would you\r\nwant me to eat a poor little lost baby, that doesn't know where its\r\nmother is?\" And the beast gathered the little one into its strong, hairy\r\narms and tried to comfort it by rocking it gently back and forth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Lion growled low in his throat and seemed very much disappointed;\r\nbut at that moment a scream reached their ears and a woman came bounding\r\nout of a house and into the street. Seeing her baby in the embrace of\r\nthe monster Tiger the woman screamed again and rushed forward to rescue\r\nit, but in her haste she caught her foot in her skirt and tumbled head\r\nover heels and heels over head, stopping with such a bump that she saw\r\nmany stars in the heavens, although it was broad daylight. And there she\r\nlay, in a helpless manner, all tangled up and unable to stir.\r\n\r\nWith one bound and a roar like thunder the huge Lion was beside her.\r\nWith his strong jaws he grasped her dress and raised her into an upright\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing! Are you hurt?\" he gently asked.\r\n\r\nGasping for breath the woman struggled to free herself and tried to\r\nwalk, but she limped badly and tumbled down again.\r\n\r\n\"My baby!\" she said pleadingly.\r\n\r\n\"The baby is all right; don't worry,\" replied the Lion; and then he\r\nadded: \"Keep quiet, now, and I'll carry you back to your house, and the\r\nHungry Tiger will carry your baby.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tiger, who had approached the place with the child in its arms,\r\nasked in astonishment:\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to tear her into sixty pieces?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"No, nor into six pieces,\" answered the Lion indignantly. \"I'm not\r\nsuch a brute as to destroy a poor woman who has hurt herself trying to\r\nsave her lost baby. If you are so ferocious and cruel and bloodthirsty,\r\nyou may leave me and go away, for I do not care to associate with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" answered the Tiger. \"I'm not cruel--not in the\r\nleast--I'm only hungry. But I thought _you_ were cruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank heaven I'm respectable,\" said the Lion, with dignity. He then\r\nraised the woman and with much gentleness carried her into her house,\r\nwhere he laid her upon a sofa. The Tiger followed with the baby, which\r\nhe safely deposited beside its mother. The little one liked the Hungry\r\nTiger and grasping the enormous beast by both ears the baby kissed the\r\nbeast's nose to show he was grateful and happy.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you very much,\" said the woman. \"I've often heard what good\r\nbeasts you are, in spite of your power to do mischief to mankind, and\r\nnow I know that the stories are true. I do not think either of you have\r\never had an evil thought.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion hung their heads and did not look\r\ninto each other's eyes, for both were shamed and humbled. They crept\r\naway and stalked back through the streets until they again entered the\r\npalace grounds, where they retreated to the pretty, comfortable rooms\r\nthey occupied at the back of the palace. There they silently crouched in\r\ntheir usual corners to think over their adventure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter a while the Tiger said sleepily:\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe fat babies taste like gumdrops. I'm quite sure they\r\nhave the flavor of raspberry tarts. My, how hungry I am for fat babies!\"\r\n\r\nThe Lion grunted disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\"You're a humbug,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\" retorted the Tiger, with a sneer. \"Tell me, then, into how many\r\npieces you usually tear your victims, my bold Lion?\"\r\n\r\nThe Lion impatiently thumped the floor with his tail.\r\n\r\n\"To tear anyone into pieces would soil my claws and blunt my teeth,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I'm glad I didn't muss myself up this afternoon by hurting that\r\npoor mother.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tiger looked at him steadily and then yawned a wide, wide yawn.\r\n\r\n\"You're a coward,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Lion, \"it's better to be a coward than to do wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" answered the other. \"And that reminds me that I nearly\r\nlost my own reputation. For, had I eaten that fat baby I would not now\r\nbe the Hungry Tiger. It's better to go hungry, seems to me, than to be\r\ncruel to a little child.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then they dropped their heads on their paws and went to sleep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE DOROTHY AND TOTO\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy was a little Kansas girl who once accidentally found the\r\nbeautiful Land of Oz and was invited to live there always. Toto was\r\nDorothy's small black dog, with fuzzy, curly hair and bright black eyes.\r\nTogether, when they tired of the grandeur of the Emerald City of Oz,\r\nthey would wander out into the country and all through the land,\r\npeering into queer nooks and corners and having a good time in their own\r\nsimple way. There was a little Wizard living in Oz who was a faithful\r\nfriend of Dorothy and did not approve of her traveling alone in this\r\nway, but the girl always laughed at the little man's fears for her and\r\nsaid she was not afraid of anything that might happen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne day while on such a journey, Dorothy and Toto found themselves among\r\nthe wild wooded hills at the southeast of Oz--a place usually avoided by\r\ntravelers because so many magical things abounded there. And, as they\r\nentered a forest path, the little girl noticed a sign tacked to a tree,\r\nwhich said: \"Look out for Crinklink.\"\r\n\r\nToto could not talk, as many of the animals of Oz can, for he was just\r\na common Kansas dog; but he looked at the sign so seriously that Dorothy\r\nalmost believed he could read it, and she knew quite well that Toto\r\nunderstood every word she said to him.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind Crinklink,\" said she. \"I don't believe anything in Oz will\r\ntry to hurt us, Toto, and if I get into trouble you must take care of\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bow-wow!\" said Toto, and Dorothy knew that meant a promise.\r\n\r\nThe path was narrow and wound here and there between the trees, but they\r\ncould not lose their way, because thick vines and creepers shut them in\r\non both sides. They had walked a long time when, suddenly turning a\r\ncurve of the pathway, they came upon a lake of black water, so big and\r\nso deep that they were forced to stop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Well, Toto,\" said Dorothy, looking at the lake, \"we must turn back, I\r\nguess, for there is neither a bridge nor a boat to take us across the\r\nblack water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's the ferryman, though,\" cried a tiny voice beside them, and the\r\ngirl gave a start and looked down at her feet, where a man no taller\r\nthan three inches sat at the edge of the path with his legs dangling\r\nover the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Dorothy; \"I didn't see you before.\"\r\n\r\nToto growled fiercely and made his ears stand up straight, but the\r\nlittle man did not seem in the least afraid of the dog. He merely\r\nrepeated: \"I'm the ferryman, and it's my business to carry people across\r\nthe lake.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy couldn't help feeling surprised, for she could have picked the\r\nlittle man up with one hand, and the lake was big and broad. Looking at\r\nthe ferryman more closely she saw that he had small eyes, a big nose,\r\nand a sharp chin. His hair was blue and his clothes scarlet, and Dorothy\r\nnoticed that every button on his jacket was the head of some animal. The\r\ntop button was a bear's head and the next button a wolf's head; the next\r\nwas a cat's head and the next a weasel's head, while the last button of\r\nall was the head of a field-mouse. When Dorothy looked into the eyes\r\nof these animals' heads, they all nodded and said in a chorus: \"Don't\r\nbelieve all you hear, little girl!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" said the small ferryman, slapping each button head in turn,\r\nbut not hard enough to hurt them. Then he turned to Dorothy and asked:\r\n\"Do you wish to cross over the lake?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I'd like to,\" she answered, hesitating; \"but I can't see how you\r\nwill manage to carry us, without any boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you can't see, you mustn't see,\" he answered with a laugh. \"All you\r\nneed do is shut your eyes, say the word, and--over you go!\"\r\n\r\nDorothy wanted to get across, in order that she might continue her\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" she said, closing her eyes; \"I'm ready.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly she was seized in a pair of strong arms--arms so big and\r\npowerful that she was startled and cried out in fear.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" roared a great voice, and the girl opened her eyes to find\r\nthat the tiny man had suddenly grown to a giant and was holding both her\r\nand Toto in a tight embrace while in one step he spanned the lake and\r\nreached the other shore.\r\n\r\nDorothy became frightened, then, especially as the giant did not stop\r\nbut continued tramping in great steps over the wooded hills, crushing\r\nbushes and trees beneath his broad feet. She struggled in vain to free\r\nherself, while Toto whined and trembled beside her, for the little dog\r\nwas frightened, too.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" screamed the girl. \"Let me down!\" But the giant paid no\r\nattention. \"Who are you, and where are you taking me?\" she continued;\r\nbut the giant said not a word. Close to Dorothy's ear, however, a voice\r\nanswered her, saying: \"This is the terrible Crinklink, and he has you in\r\nhis power.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy managed to twist her head around and found it was the second\r\nbutton on the jacket--the wolf's head--which had spoken to her.\r\n\r\n\"What will Crinklink do with me?\" she asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"No one knows. You must wait and see,\" replied the wolf.\r\n\r\n\"Some of his captives he whips,\" squeaked the weasel's head.\r\n\r\n\"Some he transforms into bugs and other things,\" growled the bear's\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Some he enchants, so that they become doorknobs,\" sighed the cat's\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Some he makes his slaves--even as we are--and that is the most dreadful\r\nfate of all,\" added the field-mouse. \"As long as Crinklink exists we\r\nshall remain buttons, but as there are no more buttonholes on his jacket\r\nhe will probably make you a slave.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDorothy began to wish she had not met Crinklink. Meantime, the giant\r\ntook such big steps that he soon reached the heart of the hills,\r\nwhere, perched upon the highest peak, stood a log castle. Before this\r\ncastle he paused to set down Dorothy and Toto, for Crinklink was at\r\npresent far too large to enter his own doorway. So he made himself grow\r\nsmaller, until he was about the size of an ordinary man. Then he said to\r\nDorothy, in stern, commanding tones:\r\n\r\n\"Enter, girl!\"\r\n\r\nDorothy obeyed and entered the castle, with Toto at her heels. She\r\nfound the place to be merely one big room. There was a table and\r\nchair of ordinary size near the center, and at one side a wee bed\r\nthat seemed scarcely big enough for a doll. Everywhere else were\r\ndishes--dishes--dishes! They were all soiled, and were piled upon the\r\nfloor, in all the corners and upon every shelf. Evidently Crinklink had\r\nnot washed a dish for years, but had cast them aside as he used them.\r\n\r\nDorothy's captor sat down in the chair and frowned at her.\r\n\r\n\"You are young and strong, and will make a good dishwasher,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean me to wash all those dishes?\" she asked, feeling both\r\nindignant and fearful, for such a task would take weeks to accomplish.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I mean,\" he retorted. \"I need clean dishes, for all I\r\nhave are soiled, and you're going to make 'em clean or get trounced. So\r\nget to work and be careful not to break anything. If you smash a dish,\r\nthe penalty is one lash from my dreadful cat-o'-nine-tails for every\r\npiece the dish breaks into,\" and here Crinklink displayed a terrible\r\nwhip that made the little girl shudder.\r\n\r\nDorothy knew how to wash dishes, but she remembered that often she\r\ncarelessly broke one. In this case, however, a good deal depended on\r\nbeing careful, so she handled the dishes very cautiously.\r\n\r\nWhile she worked, Toto sat by the hearth and growled low at Crinklink,\r\nand Crinklink sat in his chair and growled at Dorothy because she moved\r\nso slowly. He expected her to break a dish any minute, but as the hours\r\npassed away and this did not happen Crinklink began to grow sleepy. It\r\nwas tiresome watching the girl wash dishes and often he glanced\r\nlongingly at the tiny bed. Now he began to yawn, and he yawned and\r\nyawned until finally he said:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to take a nap. But the buttons on my jacket will be wide\r\nawake and whenever you break a dish the crash will waken me. As I'm\r\nrather sleepy I hope you won't interrupt my nap by breaking anything for\r\na long time.\"\r\n\r\nThen Crinklink made himself grow smaller and smaller until he was three\r\ninches high and of a size to fit the tiny bed. At once he lay down and\r\nfell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nDorothy came close to the buttons and whispered: \"Would you really warn\r\nCrinklink if I tried to escape?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't escape,\" growled the bear. \"Crinklink would become a giant,\r\nand soon overtake you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you might kill him while he sleeps,\" suggested the cat, in a soft\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Dorothy, drawing back; \"I couldn't poss'bly _kill_\r\nanything--even to save my life.\"\r\n\r\nBut Toto had heard this conversation and was not so particular about\r\nkilling monsters. Also the little dog knew he must try to save his\r\nmistress. In an instant he sprang upon the wee bed and was about to\r\nseize the sleeping Crinklink in his jaws when Dorothy heard a loud crash\r\nand a heap of dishes fell from the table to the floor. Then the girl saw\r\nToto and the little man rolling on the floor together, like a fuzzy\r\nball, and when the ball stopped rolling, behold! there was Toto wagging\r\nhis tail joyfully and there sat the little Wizard of Oz, laughing\r\nmerrily at the expression of surprise on Dorothy's face.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, it's me,\" said he, \"and I've been playing tricks on\r\nyou--for your own good. I wanted to prove to you that it is really\r\ndangerous for a little girl to wander alone in a fairy country; so I\r\ntook the form of Crinklink to teach you a lesson. There isn't any\r\nCrinklink, to be sure; but if there had been you'd be severely whipped\r\nfor breaking all those dishes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Wizard now rose, took off the coat with the button heads, and spread\r\nit on the floor, wrong side up. At once there crept from beneath it a\r\nbear, a wolf, a cat, a weasel, and a field-mouse, who all rushed from\r\nthe room and escaped into the mountains.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Toto,\" said Dorothy; \"let's go back to the Emerald City.\r\nYou've given me a good scare, Wizard,\" she added, with dignity, \"and\r\np'raps I'll forgive you, by'n'by; but just now I'm mad to think how\r\neasily you fooled me.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIKTOK AND THE NOME KING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nome King was unpleasantly angry. He had carelessly bitten his\r\ntongue at breakfast and it still hurt; so he roared and raved and\r\nstamped around in his underground palace in a way that rendered him very\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that on this unfortunate day Tiktok, the Clockwork Man,\r\nvisited the Nome King to ask a favor. Tiktok lived in the Land of Oz,\r\nand although he was an active and important person, he was made entirely\r\nof metal. Machinery within him, something like the works of a clock,\r\nmade him move; other machinery made him talk; still other machinery made\r\nhim think.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlthough so cleverly constructed, the Clockwork Man was far from\r\nperfect. Three separate keys wound up his motion machinery, his speech\r\nworks, and his thoughts. One or more of these contrivances was likely to\r\nrun down at a critical moment, leaving poor Tiktok helpless. Also some\r\nof his parts were wearing out, through much use, and just now his\r\nthought machinery needed repair. The skillful little Wizard of Oz had\r\ntinkered with Tiktok's thoughts without being able to get them properly\r\nregulated, so he had advised the Clockwork Man to go to the Nome King\r\nand secure a new set of springs, which would render his thoughts more\r\nelastic and responsive.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful what you say to the Nome King,\" warned the Wizard. \"He has a\r\nbad temper and the least little thing makes him angry.\"\r\n\r\nTiktok promised, and the Wizard wound his machinery and set him walking\r\nin the direction of the Nome King's dominions, just across the desert\r\nfrom the Land of Oz. He ran down just as he reached the entrance to the\r\nunderground palace, and there Kaliko, the Nome King's Chief Steward,\r\nfound him and wound him up again.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see the King,\" said Tiktok, in his jerky voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Kaliko, \"it may be safe for a cast-iron person like you\r\nto face his Majesty this morning; but you must announce yourself, for\r\nshould I show my face inside the jewel-studded cavern where the King is\r\nnow raving, I'd soon look like a dish of mashed potatoes, and be of no\r\nfurther use to anyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a-fraid,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"Then walk in and make yourself at home,\" answered Kaliko, and threw\r\nopen the door of the King's cavern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTiktok promptly walked in and faced the astonished Nome King, to whom\r\nhe said: \"Good morn-ing. I want two new steel springs for my\r\nthought-works and a new cog-wheel for my speech-pro-du-cer. How a-bout\r\nit, your Maj-es-ty?\"\r\n\r\nThe Nome King growled a menacing growl and his eyes were red with rage.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you enter my presence?\" he shouted.\r\n\r\n\"I dare an-y-thing,\" said Tiktok. \"I'm not a-fraid of a fat Nome.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis was true, yet an unwise speech. Had Tiktok's thoughts been in good\r\nworking order he would have said something else. The angry Nome King\r\nquickly caught up his heavy mace and hurled it straight at Tiktok. When\r\nit struck the metal man's breast, the force of the blow burst the\r\nbolts which held the plates of his body together and they clattered to\r\nthe floor in a score of pieces. Hundreds and hundreds of wheels, pins,\r\ncogs and springs filled the air like a cloud and then rattled like hail\r\nupon the floor.\r\n\r\nWhere Tiktok had stood was now only a scrap-heap and the Nome King was\r\nso amazed by the terrible effect of his blow that he stared in wonder.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty's anger quickly cooled. He remembered that the Clockwork Man\r\nwas a favorite subject of the powerful Princess, Ozma of Oz, who would\r\nbe sure to resent Tiktok's ruin.\r\n\r\n\"Too bad! too bad!\" he muttered, regretfully. \"I'm really sorry I made\r\njunk of the fellow. I didn't know he'd break.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better be,\" remarked Kaliko, who now ventured to enter the room.\r\n\"You'll have a war on your hands when Ozma hears of this, and the\r\nchances are you will lose your throne and your kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nome King turned pale, for he loved to rule the Nomes and did not\r\nknow of any other way to earn a living in case Ozma fought and conquered\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Do--do you think Ozma will be angry?\" he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure of it,\" said Kaliko. \"And she has the right to be. You've made\r\nscrap-iron of her favorite.\"\r\n\r\nThe King groaned.\r\n\r\n\"Sweep him up and throw the rubbish into the black pit,\" he commanded;\r\nand then he shut himself up in his private den and for days would see no\r\none, because he was so ashamed of his unreasoning anger and so feared\r\nthe results of his rash act.\r\n\r\nKaliko swept up the pieces, but he did not throw them into the black\r\npit. Being a clever and skillful mechanic he determined to fit the\r\npieces together again.\r\n\r\nNo man ever faced a greater puzzle; but it was interesting work and\r\nKaliko succeeded. When he found a spring or wheel worn or imperfect, he\r\nmade a new one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks, by working steadily night and day, the Chief Steward\r\ncompleted his task and put the three sets of clockworks and the last\r\nrivet into Tiktok's body. He then wound up the motion machinery, and the\r\nClockwork Man walked up and down the room as naturally as ever. Then\r\nKaliko wound up the thought works and the speech regulator and said to\r\nTiktok:\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine,\" said the Clockwork Man. \"You have done a ve-ry good job,\r\nKal-i-ko, and saved me from de-struc-tion. Much o-bliged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" replied the Chief Steward. \"I quite enjoyed the\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the Nome King's gong sounded, and Kaliko rushed away through\r\nthe jewel-studded cavern and into the den where the King had hidden,\r\nleaving the doors ajar.\r\n\r\n\"Kaliko,\" said the King, in a meek voice, \"I've been shut up here long\r\nenough to repent bitterly the destruction of Tiktok. Of course Ozma will\r\nhave revenge, and send an army to fight us, but we must take our\r\nmedicine. One thing comforts me: Tiktok wasn't really a live person; he\r\nwas only a machine man, and so it wasn't very wicked to stop his\r\nclockworks. I couldn't sleep nights, at first, for worry; but there's no\r\nmore harm in smashing a machine man than in breaking a wax doll. Don't\r\nyou think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am too humble to think in the presence of your Majesty,\" said Kaliko.\r\n\r\n\"Then get me something to eat,\" commanded the King, \"for I'm nearly\r\nstarved. Two roasted goats, a barrel of cakes and nine mince pies will\r\ndo me until dinnertime.\"\r\n\r\nKaliko bowed and hurried away to the royal kitchen, forgetting Tiktok,\r\nwho was wandering around in the outer cavern. Suddenly the Nome King\r\nlooked up and saw the Clockwork Man standing before him, and at the\r\nsight the monarch's eyes grew big and round and he fell a-trembling in\r\nevery limb.\r\n\r\n\"Away, grim Shadow!\" he cried. \"You're not here, you know; you're only a\r\nhash of cogwheels and springs, lying at the bottom of the black pit.\r\nVanish, thou Vision of the demolished Tiktok, and leave me in peace--for\r\nI have bitterly repented!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Then beg my pardon,\" said Tiktok in a gruff voice, for Kaliko had\r\nforgotten to oil the speech works.\r\n\r\nBut the sound of a voice coming from what he thought a mere vision was\r\ntoo much for the Nome King's shaken nerves. He gave a yell of fear and\r\nrushed from the room. Tiktok followed, so the King bolted through the\r\ncorridors on a swift run and bumped against Kaliko, who was returning\r\nwith a tray of things to eat. The sound of the breaking dishes, as they\r\nstruck the floor, added to the King's terror and he yelled again and\r\ndashed into a great cavern where a thousand Nomes were at work hammering\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Look out! Here comes a phantom clockwork man!\" screamed the\r\nterrified monarch, and every Nome dropped his tools and made a rush\r\nfrom the cavern, knocking over their King in their mad flight and\r\nrecklessly trampling upon his prostrate fat body. So, when Tiktok came\r\ninto the cavern, there was only the Nome King left, and he was rolling\r\nupon the rocky floor and howling for mercy, with his eyes fast shut so\r\nthat he could not see what he was sure was a dreadful phantom that was\r\ncoming straight toward him.\r\n\r\n\"It oc-curs to me,\" said Tiktok calmly, \"that your Maj-es-ty is act-ing\r\nlike a ba-by I am not a phan-tom. A phan-tom is unreal, while I am the\r\nreal thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe King rolled over, sat up and opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I smash you to pieces?\" he asked in trembling tones.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"Then you are nothing but a junk-heap, and this form in which you now\r\nappear cannot be real.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, though,\" declared Tiktok. \"Kal-i-ko picked up my piec-es and put\r\nme to-geth-er a-gain. I'm as good as new, and perhaps bet-ter.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, your Majesty,\" added Kaliko, who now made his appearance,\r\n\"and I hope you will forgive me for mending Tiktok. He was quite broken\r\nup, after you smashed him, and I found it almost as hard a job to match\r\nhis pieces as to pick turnips from gooseberry bushes. But I did it,\" he\r\nadded proudly.\r\n\r\n\"You are forgiven,\" announced the Nome King, rising to his feet and\r\ndrawing a long breath. \"I will raise your wages one specto a year, and\r\nTiktok shall return to the Land of Oz loaded with jewels for the\r\nPrincess Ozma.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all right,\" said Tiktok. \"But what I want to know is, why did\r\nyou hit me with your mace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I was angry,\" admitted the King. \"When I am angry I always do\r\nsomething that I am sorry for afterward. So I have firmly resolved never\r\nto get angry again; unless--unless--\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless what, your Majesty?\" inquired Kaliko.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Unless something annoys me,\" said the Nome King. And then he went to\r\nhis treasure-chamber to get the jewels for Princess Ozma of Oz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOZMA AND THE LITTLE WIZARD\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there lived in the beautiful Emerald City, which lies\r\nin the center of the fairy Land of Oz, a lovely girl called Princess\r\nOzma, who was ruler of all that country. And among those who served this\r\ngirlish Ruler and lived in a cozy suite of rooms in her splendid palace,\r\nwas a little, withered old man known as the Wizard of Oz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis little Wizard could do a good many queer things in magic; but he\r\nwas a kind man, with merry, twinkling eyes and a sweet smile; so,\r\ninstead of fearing him because of his magic, everybody loved him.\r\n\r\nNow, Ozma was very anxious that all her people who inhabited the\r\npleasant Land of Oz should be happy and contented, and therefore she\r\ndecided one morning to make a journey to all parts of the country, that\r\nshe might discover if anything was amiss, or anyone discontented, or if\r\nthere was any wrong that ought to be righted. She asked the little\r\nWizard to accompany her and he was glad to go.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I take my bag of magic tools with me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Ozma. \"We may need a lot of magic before we return,\r\nfor we are going into strange corners of the land, where we may meet\r\nwith unknown creatures and dangerous adventures.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Wizard took his bag of magic tools and the two left the Emerald\r\nCity and wandered over the country for many days, at last reaching a\r\nplace far up in the mountains which neither of them had ever visited\r\nbefore. Stopping one morning at a cottage, built beside the rocky path\r\nwhich led into a pretty valley beyond, Ozma asked a man:\r\n\r\n\"Are you happy? Have you any complaint to make of your lot?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the man replied:\r\n\r\n\"We are happy except for three mischievous Imps that live in yonder\r\nvalley and often come here to annoy us. If your Highness would only\r\ndrive away those Imps, I and my family would be very happy and very\r\ngrateful to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are these bad Imps?\" inquired the girl Ruler.\r\n\r\n\"One is named Olite, and one Udent and one Ertinent, and they have no\r\nrespect for anyone or anything. If strangers pass through the valley the\r\nImps jeer at them and make horrid faces and call names, and often they\r\npush travelers out of the path or throw stones at them. Whenever Imp\r\nOlite or Imp Udent or Imp Ertinent comes here to bother us, I and my\r\nfamily run into the house and lock all the doors and windows, and we\r\ndare not venture out again until the Imps have gone away.\"\r\n\r\nPrincess Ozma was grieved to hear this report and the little Wizard\r\nshook his head gravely and said the naughty Imps deserved to be\r\npunished. They told the good man they would see what could be done to\r\nprotect him and at once entered the valley to seek the dwelling place of\r\nthe three mischievous creatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBefore long they came upon three caves, hollowed from the rocks, and in\r\nfront of each cave squatted a queer little dwarf. Ozma and the Wizard\r\npaused to examine them and found them well-shaped, strong and lively.\r\nThey had big round ears, flat noses and wide grinning mouths, and\r\ntheir jet-black hair came to points on top of their heads, much\r\nresembling horns. Their clothing fitted snugly to their bodies and limbs\r\nand the Imps were so small in size that at first Ozma did not consider\r\nthem at all dangerous. But one of them suddenly reached out a hand and\r\ncaught the dress of the Princess, jerking it so sharply that she nearly\r\nfell down, and a moment later another Imp pushed the little Wizard so\r\nhard that he bumped against Ozma and both unexpectedly sat down upon the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAt this the Imps laughed boisterously and began running around in a\r\ncircle and kicking dust upon the Royal Princess, who cried in a sharp\r\nvoice: \"Wizard, do your duty!\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard promptly obeyed. Without rising from the ground he opened his\r\nbag, got the tools he required and muttered a magic spell.\r\n\r\nInstantly the three Imps became three bushes--of a thorny stubby\r\nkind--with their roots in the ground. As the bushes were at first\r\nmotionless, perhaps through surprise at their sudden transformation, the\r\nWizard and the Princess found time to rise from the ground and brush the\r\ndust off their pretty clothes. Then Ozma turned to the bushes and said:\r\n\r\n\"The unhappy lot you now endure, my poor Imps, is due entirely to your\r\nnaughty actions. You can no longer annoy harmless travelers and you\r\nmust remain ugly bushes, covered with sharp thorns, until you repent of\r\nyour bad ways and promise to be good Imps.\"\r\n\r\n\"They can't help being good now, your Highness,\" said the Wizard, who\r\nwas much pleased with his work, \"and the safest plan will be to allow\r\nthem always to remain bushes.\"\r\n\r\nBut something must have been wrong with the Wizard's magic, or the\r\ncreatures had magic of their own, for no sooner were the words spoken\r\nthan the bushes began to move. At first they only waved their branches\r\nat the girl and little man, but pretty soon they began to slide over the\r\nground, their roots dragging through the earth, and one pushed itself\r\nagainst the Wizard and pricked him so sharply with its thorns that he\r\ncried out: \"Ouch!\" and started to run away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOzma followed, for the other bushes were trying to stick their thorns\r\ninto her legs and one actually got so near her that it tore a great rent\r\nin her beautiful dress. The girl Princess could run, however, and she\r\nfollowed the fleeing Wizard until he tumbled head first over a log and\r\nrolled upon the ground. Then she sprang behind a tree and shouted:\r\n\"Quick! Transform them into something else.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard heard, but he was much confused by his fall. Grabbing from\r\nhis bag the first magical tool he could find he transformed the bushes\r\ninto three white pigs. That astonished the Imps. In the shape of\r\npigs--fat, roly-poly and cute--they scampered off a little distance and\r\nsat down to think about their new condition.\r\n\r\nOzma drew a long breath and coming from behind the tree she said:\r\n\r\n\"That is much better, Wiz, for such pigs as these must be quite\r\nharmless. No one need now fear the mischievous Imps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I intended to transform them into mice,\" replied the Wizard, \"but in my\r\nexcitement I worked the wrong magic. However, unless the horrid\r\ncreatures behave themselves hereafter, they are liable to be killed and\r\neaten. They would make good chops, sausages or roasts.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut the Imps were now angry and had no intention of behaving. As Ozma\r\nand the little Wizard turned to resume their journey, the three pigs\r\nrushed forward, dashed between their legs, and tripped them up, so that\r\nboth lost their balance and toppled over, clinging to one another. As\r\nthe Wizard tried to get up he was tripped again and fell across the back\r\nof the third pig, which carried him on a run far down the valley until\r\nit dumped the little man in the river. Ozma had been sprawled upon the\r\nground but found she was not hurt, so she picked herself up and ran to\r\nthe assistance of the Wizard, reaching him just as he was crawling out\r\nof the river, gasping for breath and dripping with water. The girl could\r\nnot help laughing at his woeful appearance. But he had no sooner wiped\r\nthe wet from his eyes than one of the impish pigs tripped him again and\r\nsent him into the river for a second bath. The pigs tried to trip Ozma,\r\ntoo, but she ran around a stump and so managed to keep out of their way.\r\nSo the Wizard scrambled out of the water again and picked up a sharp\r\nstick to defend himself. Then he mumbled a magic mutter which instantly\r\ndried his clothes, after which he hurried to assist Ozma. The pigs were\r\nafraid of the sharp stick and kept away from it.\r\n\r\n\"This won't do,\" said the Princess. \"We have accomplished nothing, for\r\nthe pig Imps would annoy travelers as much as the real Imps. Transform\r\nthem into something else, Wiz.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Wizard took time to think. Then he transformed the white pigs into\r\nthree blue doves.\r\n\r\n\"Doves,\" said he, \"are the most harmless things in the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had he spoken when the doves flew at them and tried to peck\r\nout their eyes. When they endeavored to shield their eyes with their\r\nhands, two of the doves bit the Wizard's fingers and another caught the\r\npretty pink ear of the Princess in its bill and gave it such a cruel\r\ntweak that she cried out in pain and threw her skirt over her head.\r\n\r\n\"These birds are worse than pigs, Wizard,\" she called to her companion.\r\n\"Nothing is harmless that is animated by impudent anger or impertinent\r\nmischief. You must transform the Imps into something that is not alive.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard was pretty busy, just then, driving off the birds, but he\r\nmanaged to open his bag of magic and find a charm which instantly\r\ntransformed the doves into three buttons. As they fell to the ground he\r\npicked them up and smiled with satisfaction. The tin button was Imp\r\nOlite, the brass button was Imp Udent and the lead button was Imp\r\nErtinent. These buttons the Wizard placed in a little box which he put\r\nin his jacket pocket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"the Imps cannot annoy travelers, for we shall carry\r\nthem back with us to the Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we dare not use the buttons,\" said Ozma, smiling _once more_ now\r\nthat the danger was over.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked the Wizard. \"I intend to sew them upon my coat and\r\nwatch them carefully. The spirits of the Imps are still in the buttons,\r\nand after a time they will repent and be sorry for their naughtiness.\r\nThen they will decide to be very good in the future. When they feel that\r\nway, the tin button will turn to silver and the brass to gold, while the\r\nlead button will become aluminum. I shall then restore them to their\r\nproper forms, changing their names to pretty names instead of the ugly\r\nones they used to bear. Thereafter the three Imps will become good\r\ncitizens of the Land of Oz and I think you will find they will prove\r\nfaithful subjects of our beloved Princess Ozma.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is magic well worthwhile,\" exclaimed Ozma, well pleased.\r\n\"There is no doubt, my friend, but that you are a very clever Wizard.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE SAWHORSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a room of the Royal Palace of the Emerald City of Oz hangs a Magic\r\nPicture, in which are shown all the important scenes that transpire in\r\nthose fairy dominions. The scenes shift constantly and by watching them,\r\nOzma, the girl Ruler, is able to discover events taking place in any\r\npart of her kingdom.\r\n\r\nOne day she saw in her Magic Picture that a little girl and a little boy\r\nhad wandered together into a great, gloomy forest at the far west of Oz\r\nand had become hopelessly lost. Their friends were seeking them in the\r\nwrong direction and unless Ozma came to their rescue the little ones\r\nwould never be found in time to save them from starving.\r\n\r\nSo the Princess sent a message to Jack Pumpkinhead and asked him to come\r\nto the palace. This personage, one of the queerest of the queer\r\ninhabitants of Oz, was an old friend and companion of Ozma. His form was\r\nmade of rough sticks fitted together and dressed in ordinary clothes.\r\nHis head was a pumpkin with a face carved upon it, and was set on top a\r\nsharp stake which formed his neck.\r\n\r\nJack was active, good-natured and a general favorite; but his pumpkin\r\nhead was likely to spoil with age, so in order to secure a good supply\r\nof heads he grew a big field of pumpkins and lived in the middle of it,\r\nhis house being a huge pumpkin hollowed out. Whenever he needed a new\r\nhead he picked a pumpkin, carved a face on it and stuck it upon the\r\nstake of his neck, throwing away the old head as of no further use.\r\n\r\nThe day Ozma sent for him Jack was in prime condition and was glad to be\r\nof service in rescuing the lost children. Ozma made him a map, showing\r\njust where the forest was and how to get to it and the paths he must\r\ntake to reach the little ones. Then she said:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"You'd better ride the Sawhorse, for he is swift and intelligent and\r\nwill help you accomplish your task.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered Jack, and went to the royal stable to tell the\r\nSawhorse to be ready for the trip.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable animal was not unlike Jack Pumpkinhead in form, although\r\nso different in shape. Its body was a log, with four sticks stuck into\r\nit for legs. A branch at one end of the log served as a tail, while in\r\nthe other end was chopped a gash that formed a mouth. Above this were\r\ntwo small knots that did nicely for eyes. The Sawhorse was the favorite\r\nsteed of Ozma and to prevent its wooden legs from wearing out she had\r\nthem shod with plates of gold.\r\n\r\nJack said \"Good morning\" to the Sawhorse and placed upon the creature's\r\nback a saddle of purple leather, studded with jewels.\r\n\r\n\"Where now?\" asked the horse, blinking its knot eyes at Jack.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to rescue two babes in the wood,\" was the reply. Then he\r\nclimbed into the saddle and the wooden animal pranced out of the stable,\r\nthrough the streets of the Emerald City and out upon the highway leading\r\nto the western forest where the children were lost.\r\n\r\nSmall though he was, the Sawhorse was swift and untiring. By nightfall\r\nthey were in the far west and quite close to the forest they sought.\r\nThey passed the night standing quietly by the roadside. They needed no\r\nfood, for their wooden bodies never became hungry; nor did they sleep,\r\nbecause they never tired. At daybreak they continued their journey and\r\nsoon reached the forest.\r\n\r\nJack now examined the map Ozma had given him and found the right path to\r\ntake, which the Sawhorse obediently followed. Underneath the trees all\r\nwas silent and gloomy and Jack beguiled the way by whistling gayly as\r\nthe Sawhorse trotted along.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe paths branched so many times and in so many different ways that the\r\nPumpkinhead was often obliged to consult Ozma's map, and finally the\r\nSawhorse became suspicious.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you are right?\" it asked.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" answered Jack. \"Even a Pumpkinhead whose brains are seeds\r\ncan follow so clear a map as this. Every path is plainly marked, and\r\nhere is a cross where the children are.\"\r\n\r\nFinally they reached a place, in the very heart of the forest, where\r\nthey came upon the lost boy and girl. But they found the two children\r\nbound fast to the trunk of a big tree, at the foot of which they were\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nWhen the rescuers arrived, the little girl was sobbing bitterly and the\r\nboy was trying to comfort her, though he was probably frightened as\r\nmuch as she.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up, my dears,\" said Jack, getting out of the saddle. \"I have come\r\nto take you back to your parents. But why are you bound to that tree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" cried a small, sharp voice, \"they are thieves and robbers.\r\nThat's why!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" said Jack, looking around to see who had spoken. The voice\r\nseemed to come from above.\r\n\r\nA big grey squirrel was sitting upon a low branch of the tree. Upon the\r\nsquirrel's head was a circle of gold, with a diamond set in the center\r\nof it. He was running up and down the limbs and chattering excitedly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"These children,\" continued the squirrel, angrily, \"robbed our\r\nstorehouse of all the nuts we had saved up for winter. Therefore, being\r\nKing of all the Squirrels in this forest, I ordered them arrested and\r\nput in prison, as you now see them. They had no right to steal our\r\nprovisions and we are going to punish them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were hungry,\" said the boy, pleadingly, \"and we found a hollow tree\r\nfull of nuts, and ate them to keep alive. We didn't want to starve when\r\nthere was food right in front of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" remarked Jack, nodding his pumpkin head. \"I don't blame\r\nyou one bit, under the circumstances. Not a bit.\"\r\n\r\nThen he began to untie the ropes that bound the children to the tree.\r\n\r\n\"Stop that!\" cried the King Squirrel, chattering and whisking about.\r\n\"You mustn't release our prisoners. You have no right to.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jack paid no attention to the protest. His wooden fingers were\r\nawkward and it took him some time to untie the ropes. When at last he\r\nsucceeded, the tree was full of squirrels, called together by their\r\nKing, and they were furious at losing their prisoners. From the tree\r\nthey began to hurl nuts at the Pumpkinhead, who laughed at them as he\r\nhelped the two children to their feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow, at the top of this tree was a big dead limb, and so many squirrels\r\ngathered upon it that suddenly it broke away and fell to the ground.\r\nPoor Jack was standing directly under it and when the limb struck him it\r\nsmashed his pumpkin head into a pulpy mass and sent Jack's wooden form\r\ntumbling, to stop with a bump against a tree a dozen feet away.\r\n\r\nHe sat up, a moment afterward, but when he felt for his head it was\r\ngone. He could not see; neither could he speak. It was perhaps the\r\ngreatest misfortune that could have happened to Jack Pumpkinhead, and\r\nthe squirrels were delighted. They danced around in the tree in great\r\nglee as they saw Jack's plight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe boy and girl were indeed free, but their protector was ruined. The\r\nSawhorse was there, however, and in his way he was wise. He had seen\r\nthe accident and knew that the smashed pumpkin would never again serve\r\nJack as a head. So he said to the children, who were frightened at this\r\naccident to their new found friend:\r\n\r\n\"Pick up the Pumpkinhead's body and set it on my saddle. Then mount\r\nbehind it and hold on. We must get out of this forest as soon as we can,\r\nor the squirrels may capture you again. I must guess at the right path,\r\nfor Jack's map is no longer of any use to him since that limb destroyed\r\nhis head.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe two children lifted Jack's body, which was not at all heavy, and\r\nplaced it upon the saddle. Then they climbed up behind it and the\r\nSawhorse immediately turned and trotted back along the path he had\r\ncome, bearing all three with ease. However, when the path began to\r\nbranch into many paths, all following different directions, the wooden\r\nanimal became puzzled and soon was wandering aimlessly about, without\r\nany hope of finding the right way. Toward evening they came upon a fine\r\nfruit tree, which furnished the children a supper, and at night the\r\nlittle ones lay upon a bed of leaves while the Sawhorse stood watch,\r\nwith the limp, headless form of poor Jack Pumpkinhead lying helpless\r\nacross the saddle.\r\n\r\nNow, Ozma had seen in her Magic Picture all that had happened in the\r\nforest, so she sent the little Wizard, mounted upon the Cowardly Lion,\r\nto save the unfortunates. The Lion knew the forest well and when he\r\nreached it he bounded straight through the tangled paths to where the\r\nSawhorse was wandering, with Jack and the two children on his back.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard was grieved at the sight of the headless Jack, but believed\r\nhe could save him. He first led the Sawhorse out of the forest and\r\nrestored the boy and girl to the arms of their anxious friends, and then\r\nhe sent the Lion back to Ozma to tell her what had happened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Wizard now mounted the Sawhorse and supported Jack's form on the\r\nlong ride to the pumpkin field. When they arrived at Jack's house the\r\nWizard selected a fine pumpkin--not too ripe--and very neatly carved a\r\nface on it. Then he stuck the pumpkin solidly on Jack's neck and asked\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\"Well, old friend, how do you feel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\" replied Jack, and shook the hand of the little Wizard\r\ngratefully. \"You have really saved my life, for without your assistance\r\nI could not have found my way home to get a new head. But I'm all right,\r\nnow, and I shall be very careful not to get this beautiful head\r\nsmashed.\" And he shook the Wizard's hand again.\r\n\r\n\"Are the brains in the new head any better than the old ones?\" inquired\r\nthe Sawhorse, who had watched Jack's restoration.\r\n\r\n\"Why, these seeds are quite tender,\" replied the Wizard, \"so they will\r\ngive our friend tender thoughts. But, to speak truly, my dear Sawhorse,\r\nJack Pumpkinhead, with all his good qualities, will never be noted for\r\nhis wisdom.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCARECROW AND THE TIN WOODMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere lived in the Land of Oz two queerly made men who were the best of\r\nfriends. They were so much happier when together that they were seldom\r\napart; yet they liked to separate, once in a while, that they might\r\nenjoy the pleasure of meeting again.\r\n\r\nOne was a Scarecrow. That means he was a suit of blue Munchkin clothes,\r\nstuffed with straw, on top of which was fastened a round cloth head,\r\nfilled with bran to hold it in shape. On the head were painted two eyes,\r\ntwo ears, a nose and a mouth. The Scarecrow had never been much of a\r\nsuccess in scaring crows, but he prided himself on being a superior man,\r\nbecause he could feel no pain, was never tired and did not have to eat\r\nor drink. His brains were sharp, for the Wizard of Oz had put pins and\r\nneedles in the Scarecrow's brains.\r\n\r\nThe other man was made all of tin, his arms and legs and head being\r\ncleverly jointed so that he could move them freely. He was known as the\r\nTin Woodman, having at one time been a woodchopper, and everyone loved\r\nhim because the Wizard had given him an excellent heart of red plush.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman lived in a magnificent tin castle, built on his country\r\nestate in the Winkie Land, not far from the Emerald City of Oz. It had\r\npretty tin furniture and was surrounded by lovely gardens in which were\r\nmany tin trees and beds of tin flowers. The palace of the Scarecrow was\r\nnot far distant, on the banks of a river, and this palace was in the\r\nshape of an immense ear of corn.\r\n\r\nOne morning the Tin Woodman went to visit his friend the Scarecrow, and\r\nas they had nothing better to do they decided to take a boat ride on the\r\nriver. So they got into the Scarecrow's boat, which was formed from a\r\nbig corncob, hollowed out and pointed at both ends and decorated around\r\nthe edges with brilliant jewels. The sail was of purple silk and\r\nglittered gayly in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nThere was a good breeze that day, so the boat glided swiftly over the\r\nwater. By and by they came to a smaller river that flowed from out a\r\ndeep forest, and the Tin Woodman proposed they sail up this stream, as\r\nit would be cool and shady beneath the trees of the forest. So the\r\nScarecrow, who was steering, turned the boat up the stream and the\r\nfriends continued talking together of old times and the wonderful\r\nadventures they had met with while traveling with Dorothy, the little\r\nKansas girl. They became so much interested in this talk that they\r\nforgot to notice that the boat was now sailing through the forest, or\r\nthat the stream was growing more narrow and crooked.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Scarecrow glanced up and saw a big rock just ahead of them.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" he cried; but the warning came too late.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman sprang to his feet just as the boat bumped into the\r\nrock, and the jar made him lose his balance. He toppled and fell\r\noverboard and being made of tin he sank to the bottom of the water in an\r\ninstant and lay there at full length, face up.\r\n\r\nImmediately the Scarecrow threw out the anchor, so as to hold the boat\r\nin that place, and then he leaned over the side and through the clear\r\nwater looked at his friend sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" he exclaimed; \"what a _misfortune_!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed,\" replied the Tin Woodman, speaking in muffled tones\r\nbecause so much water covered him. \"I cannot drown, of course, but I\r\nmust lie here until you find a way to get me out. Meantime, the water is\r\nsoaking into all my joints and I shall become badly rusted before I am\r\nrescued.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" agreed the Scarecrow; \"but be patient, my friend, and I'll\r\ndive down and get you. My straw will not rust, and is easily replaced,\r\nif damaged, so I'm not afraid of the water.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow now took off his hat and made a dive from the boat into\r\nthe water; but he was so light in weight that he barely dented the\r\nsurface of the stream, nor could he reach the Tin Woodman with his\r\noutstretched straw arms. So he floated to the boat and climbed into it,\r\nsaying the while:\r\n\r\n\"Do not despair, my friend. We have an extra anchor aboard, and I will\r\ntie it around my waist, to make me sink, and dive again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that!\" called the tin man. \"That would anchor you also to the\r\nbottom, where I am, and we'd both be helpless.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough,\" sighed the Scarecrow, wiping his wet face with a\r\nhandkerchief; and then he gave a cry of astonishment, for he found he\r\nhad wiped off one painted eye and now had but one eye to see with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"How dreadful!\" said the poor Scarecrow. \"That eye must have been\r\npainted in water-color, instead of oil. I must be careful not to wipe\r\noff the other eye, for then I could not see to help you at all.\"\r\n\r\nA shriek of elfish laughter greeted this speech and looking up the\r\nScarecrow found the trees full of black crows, who seemed much amused by\r\nthe straw man's one-eyed countenance. He knew the crows well, however,\r\nand they had usually been friendly to him because he had never deceived\r\nthem into thinking he was a meat man--the sort of man they really\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\n\"Don't laugh,\" said he; \"you may lose an eye yourselves some day.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't look as funny as you, if we did,\" replied one old crow, the\r\nking of them. \"But what has gone wrong with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Tin Woodman, my dear friend and companion, has fallen overboard and\r\nis now on the bottom of the river,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I'm trying to\r\nget him out again, but I fear I shall not succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's easy enough,\" declared the old crow. \"Tie a string to him and\r\nall of my crows will fly down, take hold of the string, and pull him up\r\nout of the water. There are hundreds of us here, so our united strength\r\ncould lift much more than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't tie a string to him,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"My straw is\r\nso light that I am unable to dive through the water. I've tried it, and\r\nknocked one eye out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you fish for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is a good idea,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I'll make the attempt.\"\r\n\r\nHe found a fishline in the boat, with a stout hook at the end of it. No\r\nbait was needed, so the Scarecrow dropped the hook into the water till\r\nit touched the Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"Hook it into a joint,\" advised the crow, who was now perched upon a\r\nbranch that stuck far out and bent down over the water.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow tried to do this, but having only one eye he could not see\r\nthe joints very clearly.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up, please,\" begged the Tin Woodman; \"you've no idea how damp it\r\nis down here.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Can't you help?\" asked the crow.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" inquired the tin man.\r\n\r\n\"Catch the line and hook it around your neck.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman made the attempt and after several trials wound the line\r\naround his neck and hooked it securely.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried the King Crow, a mischievous old fellow. \"Now, then, we'll\r\nall grab the line and pull you out.\"\r\n\r\nAt once the air was filled with black crows, each of whom seized the\r\ncord with beak or talons. The Scarecrow watched them with much interest\r\nand forgot that he had tied the other end of the line around his own\r\nwaist, so he would not lose it while fishing for his friend.\r\n\r\n\"All together for the good caws!\" shrieked the King Crow, and with a\r\ngreat flapping of wings the birds rose into the air.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow clapped his stuffed hands in glee as he saw his friend\r\ndrawn from the water into the air; but the next moment the straw man was\r\nhimself in the air, his stuffed legs kicking wildly; for the crows had\r\nflown straight up through the trees. On one end of the line dangled the\r\nTin Woodman, hung by the neck, and on the other dangled the Scarecrow,\r\nhung by the waist and clinging fast to the spare anchor of the boat,\r\nwhich he had seized hoping to save himself.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, there--be careful!\" shouted the Scarecrow to the crows. \"Don't take\r\nus so high. Land us on the river bank.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut the crows were bent on mischief. They thought it a good joke to\r\nbother the two, now that they held them captive.\r\n\r\n\"Here's where the crows scare the Scarecrow!\" chuckled the naughty King\r\nCrow, and at his command the birds flew over the forest to where a tall\r\ndead tree stood higher than all the other trees. At the very top was a\r\ncrotch, formed by two dead limbs, and into the crotch the crows dropped\r\nthe center of the line. Then, letting go their hold, they flew away,\r\nchattering with laughter, and left the two friends suspended high in the\r\nair--one on each side of the tree.\r\n\r\nNow the Tin Woodman was much heavier than the Scarecrow, but the reason\r\nthey balanced so nicely was because the straw man still clung fast to\r\nthe iron anchor. There they hung, not ten feet apart, yet unable to\r\nreach the bare tree-trunk.\r\n\r\n\"For goodness sake don't drop that anchor,\" said the Tin Woodman\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" inquired the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"If you did I'd tumble to the ground, where my tin would be badly dented\r\nby the fall. Also you would shoot into the air and alight somewhere\r\namong the tree-tops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Scarecrow, earnestly, \"I shall hold fast to the\r\nanchor.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time they both dangled in silence, the breeze swaying them gently\r\nto and fro. Finally the tin man said: \"Here is an emergency, friend,\r\nwhere only brains can help us. We must think of some way to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do the thinking,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"My brains are the\r\nsharpest.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought so long that the tin man grew tired and tried to change his\r\nposition, but found his joints had already rusted so badly that he could\r\nnot move them. And his oil-can was back in the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose your brains are rusted, friend Scarecrow?\" he asked in a\r\nweak voice, for his jaws would scarcely move.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed. Ah, here's an idea at last!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with this the Scarecrow clapped his hands to his head, forgetting\r\nthe anchor, which tumbled to the ground. The result was astonishing;\r\nfor, just as the tin man had said, the light Scarecrow flew into the\r\nair, sailed over the top of the tree and landed in a bramble-bush, while\r\nthe tin man fell plump to the ground, and landing on a bed of dry leaves\r\nwas not dented at all. The Tin Woodman's joints were so rusted, however,\r\nthat he was unable to move, while the thorns held the Scarecrow a fast\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nWhile they were in this sad plight the sound of hoofs was heard and\r\nalong the forest path rode the little Wizard of Oz, seated on a wooden\r\nSawhorse. He smiled when he saw the one-eyed head of the Scarecrow\r\nsticking out of the bramble-bush, but he helped the poor straw man out\r\nof his prison.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, dear Wiz,\" said the grateful Scarecrow. \"Now we must get the\r\noil-can and rescue the Tin Woodman.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTogether they ran to the river bank, but the boat was floating in\r\nmidstream and the Wizard was obliged to mumble some magic words to draw\r\nit to the bank, so the Scarecrow could get the oil-can. Then back they\r\nflew to the tin man, and while the Scarecrow carefully oiled each joint\r\nthe little Wizard moved the joints gently back and forth until they\r\nworked freely. After an hour of this labor the Tin Woodman was again on\r\nhis feet, and although still a little stiff he managed to walk to the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard and the Sawhorse also got aboard the corncob craft and\r\ntogether they returned to the Scarecrow's palace. But the Tin Woodman\r\nwas very careful not to stand up in the boat again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]",
