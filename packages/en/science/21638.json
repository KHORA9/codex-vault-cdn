My desire has been to create for you the\r\nimpression that you have suddenly been plunged forward into that\r\ntime--to give you the feeling Columbus might have had could he have read\r\na novel of our present-day life.\r\n\r\nTo this end I have conceived myself a writer of that future time,\r\naddressing his contemporary public. You are to imagine yourself reading\r\na present day translation of my original text--a translation so free\r\nthat a thousand little colloquialisms will have crept into it that could\r\nnot possibly have their counterparts in the year 2430.\r\n\r\nApart from the text, you will occasionally find brief explanatory\r\nfootnotes. Conceive them as having been put there by the translator.\r\n\r\nIf you find parts of this tale unusual or bizarre, please remember that\r\nwe are living now in a comparatively ignorant day. The tale is not\r\nintended to be fantastic or full of new and strange ideas. I have used\r\nnothing but those developments of our present-day civilization to which\r\nwe are all looking forward as logical probabilities--woven them into a\r\npicture of what life in America very probably will be five hundred years\r\nfrom now. To that extent, the tale itself is intended to be only a love\r\nstory of adventure and romance--written, not for you, but for that\r\nfuture audience._\r\n\r\nRAY CUMMINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n       I.

The President fell\r\nalmost at my feet. I was quite certain then that the Venus man at my\r\nelbow was the murderer. I don't know why, call it intuition if you will.\r\nThe Venus man did not make a move; he merely stood beside me in the\r\npress of the throng, seemingly as absorbed as all of us in what the\r\nPresident was saying.\r\n\r\nIt was late afternoon. The sun was setting behind the cliffs across the\r\nriver. There were perhaps a hundred and fifty thousand people within\r\nsight of the President, listening raptly to his words. It was at Park\r\nSixty, and I was standing on the Tenth Level.[1] The crowd packed all\r\ntwelve of the levels; the park was black with people. The President\r\nstood on a balcony of the park tower. He was no more than a few hundred\r\nfeet above me, well within direct earshot. Around him on all sides were\r\nthe electric megaphones which carried his voice to all parts of the\r\naudience. Behind me, a thousand feet overhead, the main aerials were\r\nscattering it throughout the city, I suppose five million people were\r\nlistening to the voice of the President at that moment. He had just said\r\nthat we must remain friendly with Venus; that in our enlightened age\r\ncontroversies were inevitable, but that they should be settled with\r\nsober thought--around the council table. This talk of war was\r\nridiculous. He was denouncing the public news-broadcasters; moulders of\r\npublic opinion, who every day--every hour--must offer a new sensation to\r\ntheir millions of subscribers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: New York City, about where Yonkers now stands.]\r\n\r\nHe had reached this point when without warning his body pitched forward.\r\nThe balcony rail caught it; and it hung there inert. The slanting rays\r\nof the sun fell full upon the ruffled white shirt; white, but turning\r\npink, then red, with the crimson stain welling out from beneath.\r\n\r\nFor an instant the crowd was stunned into silence. Then a murmur arose,\r\nand swelled into shouts of horror. A surge of people swept me forward. I\r\ncould not see clearly what was happening on the balcony. The form of the\r\nmurdered President was hanging there against the rail; a score of\r\ngovernment officials were rushing toward it; but the body, toppling over\r\nthe low support, came hurtling downward into the crowd, quite near me;\r\nbut I could not reach it--the throng was too dense.\r\n\r\nThe shouts everywhere were deafening. I was shoved along the Tenth Level\r\nby the press of people coming up the stairway. Shouts, excited\r\nquestions; the wail of children almost trampled under foot; the screams\r\nof women. And over it all, the electrically magnified voice of the\r\ntraffic director-general in the peak of the main tower roaring his\r\norders to the crowd.\r\n\r\nIt was a panic until the traffic-directors descended upon us. We were\r\npushed up on the moving sidewalks. North or south, whichever direction\r\ncame handiest, we were herded upon the sidewalks and whirled away. With\r\na hundred other spectators near me I was shoved to a sidewalk moving\r\nsouth along the Tenth Level. It was going some four miles an hour. But\r\nthey would not let me stay there. From behind, the crowd was shoving;\r\nand from one parallel strip of moving pavement to the other I was pushed\r\nalong--until at last I reached the seats of the forty mile an hour\r\ninside section.\r\n\r\nThe scene at Park Sixty was far out of direct sight and hearing. The\r\npark there had already been cleared of spectators, I knew; and they were\r\ndoubtless bearing the President's body away.\r\n\r\n\"Murdered!\" said a man beside me. \"Murdered! Look there!\"\r\n\r\nWe were across the river, into Manhattan. The Tenth Level here runs\r\nabout four hundred feet above the ground-street of the city. The man\r\nbeside me was pointing to a steel tower we were passing. It was several\r\nhundreds yards away; on its side abreast of us was a forty-foot square\r\nnews-mirror, brightly illumined. On all the stairways and balconies here\r\na local crowd had gathered, watching the mirror. It was reporting the\r\npresent scene at Park Sixty. As we sped past the tower I could see in\r\nthe silver surface of the mirror the image of the now empty park from\r\nwhich we had been so summarily ejected. They were carrying off the\r\nPresident's body; a little group of officials bearing it away; red,\r\nbroken, gruesome, with the dying rays of the sun still upon it. Carrying\r\nit slowly along to where an aero-car was waiting on the side landing\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nWe were past the mirror in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Murdered,\" the man next to me repeated. \"The President murdered.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed stunned, as indeed everyone was. Then he eyed me--my cap,\r\nwhich had on it the insignia of my calling.\r\n\r\n\"You are one of them,\" he said bitterly. \"The last word he said--the\r\nlurid news-gatherers.\"\r\n\r\nBut I shook my head. \"We are necessary. It was unfortunate that he\r\nshould have said that.\"\r\n\r\nI had no opportunity to talk further. The man moved away toward the foot\r\nof a landing stage near us. A south-bound flyer had overtaken us and was\r\nlanding. I boarded it also, and ten minutes later was in my office in\r\nSouth-Manhattan.\r\n\r\nI was at this time employed by one of the most enterprising\r\nnews-organizations in Greater New York. There was pandemonium in there\r\nthat evening. My supper came up in the pneumatic tube from the public\r\ncookery nearby, but I had hardly time to taste it.\r\n\r\nThis, the evening of May 12, 2430, was for me--and for all the\r\nEarth--the most stirring evening of history. Events of inter-planetary\r\nimportance tumbled over each other as they came to us through the air\r\nfrom the Official Information Stations. And we--myself and a thousand\r\nlike me in our office--retold them for our twenty million subscribers\r\nthroughout the Anglo-Saxon Nation.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Anglo-Saxon Republic was murdered at 5:10. It was\r\nthe first of the new murders. I say new murders, for not in two hundred\r\nyears had the life of so high an official been wilfully taken. But it\r\nwas only the first. At 6:15 word came from Tokyohama,[2] that the ruler\r\nof Allied Mongolia was dead--murdered under similar circumstances. And\r\nten minutes later from Mombozo, Africa, the blacks reported their leader\r\nkilled while asleep in his official residence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Tokyo-Yokohama, Japan.]\r\n\r\nThe Earth momentarily was without leadership!\r\n\r\nI was struggling to get accounts of these successive disasters out over\r\nour audiophones. Above my desk, in a duplicating mirror from\r\nHeadquarters, I could see that at the palace of Mombozo a throng of\r\nterrified blacks were gathered. It was night there--a blurred scene of\r\nflashing lights and frightened, milling people.\r\n\r\nGreys--next to me--had a mirror tuned to Tokyohama. The sun there was\r\nshining upon almost a similar scene of panic. Black and yellow men--on\r\nopposite sides of the Earth. And between them our white races in\r\nturmoil. Outside my own window I could hear the shouts of the crowd that\r\njammed the Twentieth Level.\r\n\r\nGreys leaned toward me. \"Seven o'clock, Jac. You've got the arrival of\r\nthe Venus mail. Don't overlook it ... By the code, man, your hands are\r\nshaking! You're white as a ghost!\"\r\n\r\nThe Venus mail; I had forgotten it completely.\r\n\r\n\"Greys, I wonder if it'll get in.\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at me strangely. \"You're thinking that, too. I told the\r\nBritish National Announcer it was a Venus plot. He laughed at me. Those\r\nGreat Londoners can't see their fingers before them. He said, 'That's\r\nyour lurid sense of newscasting.'\"\r\n\r\nVenus plot! I remembered my impressions of the Venus man who was beside\r\nme when our President fell.\r\n\r\nGreys was back at his work. I swept the south shore of Eastern Island[3]\r\nwith my finder, and picked up the image of the inter-planetary landing\r\nstage, at which the Venus mail was due to arrive. I could see the blaze\r\nof lights plainly; and with another, closer focus I caught the huge\r\nlanding platform itself. It was empty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Now Long Island.]\r\n\r\nThe station-master there answered my call. He had no word of the mail.\r\n\r\n\"Try the lookout at Table Mountain,\" he advised me. \"They may be coming\r\ndown that way.... Sure I'll let you know.... What a night! They say that\r\nin Mediterrania--\"\r\n\r\nBut I cut off; it was no time to chat with him. Table Mountain,\r\nCapetown, had no word of the mail. Then I caught the Yukon Station. The\r\nmail flyer had come down on the North Polar side--was already crossing\r\nHudson Bay.\r\n\r\nAt 8:26 it landed on Eastern Island. A deluge of Venus despatches\r\noverwhelmed me. But the mail news, before I could even begin to handle\r\nmy section of it, was far overshadowed. Venus, now at 8:44 was calling\r\nus by helio. The message came in the inter-planetary code, was decoded\r\nat National Headquarters, and from there flashed to us.\r\n\r\nThe ruler of the Venus Central State was murdered! An almost incoherent\r\nmessage. The murder of the ruler, at a time co-incident with 6:30 in\r\nGreater New York. Then the words:\r\n\r\n_\"City being attacked ... Tarrano, beware Tarrano ... You are in danger\r\nof ...\"_\r\n\r\nIn danger of what? The message broke off. The observers, behind their\r\nhuge telescopes at the Potomac Headquarters, saw the helio-lights of the\r\nVenus Central State go dark suddenly. Our own station flashed its call,\r\nbut there was no answer. Venus--evening star on that date--was sinking\r\nto the horizon. But our Observatory in Texas could see the planet\r\nclearly; and gave the same report.\r\n\r\nCommunication was broken. The authorities of the Venus Central\r\nState--friendly to us in spite of the recent immigration\r\ncontroversy--had tried to warn us.\r\n\r\nOf what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_Warning_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must have been nearly nine o'clock when a personal message came for\r\nme. Not through the ordinary open airways, but in the National Length,\r\nand coded. It came to my desk by official messenger, decoded, printed\r\nand sealed.\r\n\r\n     _Jac Hallen, Inter-Allied News_. Come to me, North-east Island at\r\n     once, if they can spare you. Important. Answer.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Brende.\r\n\r\nOur Division Manager scanned the message curiously and told me I could\r\ngo. I got off my answer. I did not dare call Dr. Brende openly, since he\r\nhad used the code, but sent it the same way. I would be up at once.\r\n\r\nWith a word of good-bye to Greys, I shoved aside my work, caught up a\r\nheavy jacket and cap and left the office. The levels outside our\r\nbuilding were still jammed with an excited throng. I pushed my way\r\nthrough it, up to the entrance to the Staten Bridge. The waters of the\r\nharbor beneath me had a broad band of moonlight upon them, dim in the\r\nglare of the city lights. I glanced upward with satisfaction. A good\r\nnight for air-traveling.\r\n\r\nMy small personal air-car was on the stage near the bridge entrance. The\r\nattendant was there, staring at me as I dashed up in such haste. He\r\nhanded me my key from the rack.\r\n\r\n\"Going far, Jac? What a night! They'll be ordering them off if many more\r\ngo up.... Going north?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said shortly.\r\n\r\nI was away, rising with my helicopters until the city was a yellow haze\r\nbeneath me. I _was_ going north--to Dr. Brende's little private island\r\noff the coast of Maine. The lower lanes were pretty well crowded. I\r\ntried one of the north-bound at 8,000 feet; but the going was awkward.\r\nThen I went to 16,000.\r\n\r\nBut Grille, the attendant back at the bridge, evidently had his finder\r\non me, out of plain curiosity. He called me.\r\n\r\n\"They'll chase you out of there,\" came his voice. \"Nothing doing up\r\nthere tonight. That's reserved. Didn't you know it?\"\r\n\r\nI grinned at him. In the glow of my pitlight I hoped he could see my\r\nface and the grin.\r\n\r\n\"They'll never catch me,\" I said. \"I'm traveling fast tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chase you out,\" he persisted. \"The patrol's keeping them low. General\r\nOrders, an hour ago. Didn't you know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you ought to. You ought to know everything in your business.\r\nBesides, the lights are up.\"\r\n\r\nThey were indeed; I could see them in all the towers underneath me. I\r\nwas flying north-east; and at the moment, with a following wind, I was\r\ndoing something over three-fifty.\r\n\r\n\"But they'll shut off your power,\" Grille warned. \"You'll come down soon\r\nenough then.\"\r\n\r\nWhich was also true enough. The evening local-express for Boston and\r\nbeyond was overhauling me. And when the green beam of a traffic tower\r\ncame up and picked me out, I decided I had better obey. Dutifully I\r\ndescended until the beam, satisfied, swung away from me.\r\n\r\nAt 8,000 feet, I went on. There was too much traffic for decent speed\r\nand the directors in every pilot bag and tower I passed seemed watching\r\nme closely. At the latitude of Boston, I swung out to sea, off the main\r\narteries of travel. The early night mail for Eurasia,[4] with Great\r\nLondon its first stop, went by me far overhead. I could make out its\r\ngreen and purple lights, and the spreading silver beam that preceded it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Now Europe and Asia.]\r\n\r\nAlone in my pit, with the dull whir of my propellers alone breaking the\r\nsilence of the night, I pondered the startling events of the past few\r\nhours. Above me the stars and planets gleamed in the deep purple of an\r\nalmost cloudless sky. Venus had long since dropped below the horizon.\r\nBut Mars was up there--approaching the zenith. I wondered what the\r\nMartian helio might be saying. I could have asked Greys back at the\r\noffice. But Greys, I knew, would be too busy to bother with me.\r\n\r\nWhat could Dr. Brende want of me? I was glad he had sent for me--there\r\nwas nowhere I would rather have gone this particular evening. And it\r\nwould give me a chance to see Elza again.\r\n\r\nI could tell by the light-numerals below, that I was now over Maine. I\r\ndid not need to consult my charts; I had been up this way many times,\r\nfor, the Brendes--the doctor, his daughter Elza, and her twin brother\r\nGeorg--I counted my best friends.\r\n\r\nI was over the sea, with the coast of Maine to my left. The traffic,\r\nsince I left the line of Boston, had been far less. The patrols flashed\r\nby me at intervals, but they did not molest me.\r\n\r\nI descended presently, and located the small two-mile island which Dr.\r\nBrende owned and upon which he lived.\r\n\r\nIt was 10:20 when I came down to find them waiting for me on the runway.\r\n\r\nThe doctor held out both his hands. \"Good enough, Jac. I got your\r\ncode--we've been waiting for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's crowded,\" I said. \"Heavy up to Boston. And they wouldn't let me go\r\nhigh.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. And then Elza put her cool little hand in mine.\r\n\r\n\"We're glad to see you, Jac. Very glad.\"\r\n\r\nThey took me to the house. Dr. Brende was a small, dark man of\r\nsixty-odd, smooth-shaven, a thin face, with a mop of iron-grey hair\r\nabove it, and keen dark eyes beneath bushy white brows. He was usually\r\nkindly and gentle of manner--at times a little abstracted; at other\r\ntimes he could be more forceful and direct than anyone with whom I had\r\never had contact.\r\n\r\nAt the house we were joined by the doctor's son, Georg. My best friend,\r\nI should say; certainly, for my part, I treasured his friendship very\r\nhighly. He and Elza were twins--twenty-three years old at this time. I\r\nam two years older; and I had been a room-mate with Georg at the Common\r\nUniversity of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nOur friendship had, if anything, grown closer since my promotion into\r\nthe business world. Yet we were as unlike as two individuals could\r\npossibly be. I am dark-haired, slim, and of comparatively slight\r\nmuscular strength. Restless--full of nervous energy--and, they tell me,\r\nsomewhat short of temper. Georg was a blond, powerful young giant. A\r\nhead taller than I--blue-eyed, from his mother, now dead--square-jawed,\r\nand a complexion pink and white. He was slow to anger. He seldom spoke\r\nimpulsively; and usually with a slow, quiet drawl. Always he seemed\r\nlooking at life and people with a half-humorous smile--looking at the\r\nhuman pageant with its foibles, follies and frailties--tolerantly. Yet\r\nthere was nothing conceited about him. Quite the reverse. He was\r\ngenerally wholly deprecating in manner, as though he himself were of\r\nleast importance. Until aroused. In our days of learning, I saw Georg\r\nonce--just once--thoroughly angered.\r\n\r\n\"... Came up promptly, didn't you?\" Georg was saying. He was leading me\r\nto the house doorway, but I stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go to the grove,\" I suggested. We turned down from the small\r\nviaduct, passed the house, and went into the heavy grove of trees\r\nnearby.\r\n\r\n\"He's hungry,\" Elza declared. \"Jac, did you eat at the office tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Did you really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some,\" I admitted. In truth the run up here had brought me a thoroughly\r\nhearty appetite, which I just realized.\r\n\r\n\"I was pretty busy, you know,\" I added. \"Such a night--but don't you\r\nbother.\"\r\n\r\nBut she had already scurried away toward the house. Dear little Elza! I\r\nwished then, for the hundredth time, that I was a man of wealth--or at\r\nleast, not as poor as a tower timekeeper. True, I made fair money--but\r\nthe urge to spend it recklessly dominated me. I decided in that moment,\r\nto reform for good; and lay by enough to justify asking a woman to be my\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nWe reclined on a mossy bank in the grove of trees, so thick a grove that\r\nit hid the house from our sight.\r\n\r\nThe doctor extinguished the glowing lights with which the tree-branches\r\nwere dotted. We were in the semi-darkness of a beautiful, moonlit night.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go to sleep, Jac!\"\r\n\r\nI became aware that Georg and his father were smiling at me.\r\n\r\nI sat up, snapping my wits into alertness. \"No. Of course not. I guess\r\nI'm tired. You've no idea what the office was like tonight. Roaring.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine,\" Georg said. \"You were at Park Sixty when the President\r\nfell, weren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But I wasn't supposed to be. I wasn't assigned to that. How did\r\nyou guess?\"\r\n\r\n\"Elza saw you. She had our finder on you--I couldn't push her away from\r\nit.\" His slow smile was quizzical.\r\n\r\n\"On me? In all that crowd. She must have searched about very carefully\r\nto----\"\r\n\r\nI stopped; I could feel my cheeks burning, and was glad of the dimness\r\nthere under the trees.\r\n\r\n\"She did,\" said Georg.\r\n\r\n\"I sent for you, Jac,\" Dr. Brende interjected abstractedly,\r\n\"because----\"\r\n\r\nBut Georg checked him. \"Not now, father. Someone--anyone--might pick you\r\nup. Your words--or read your lips--there's light enough here to register\r\non a finder.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded. \"He's afraid--you see, Jac, it's these Venus----\"\r\n\r\n\"Father--please. It's a long chance--but why take any? We can insulate\r\nin the house.\"\r\n\r\nThe chance that someone who shouldn't be, was tuned to us as we sat\r\nthere in that lonely grove! With the doctor's widespread reputation--his\r\nmore than national prominence--it did not seem to me to be such a long\r\nchance either, on this, of all nights.\r\n\r\n\"As you say, no use in putting private things into the public air,\" I\r\nremarked; and I felt then as though a thousand hostile eyes and ears\r\nwere watching and listening. \"We can talk of what everybody knows,\"\r\nGeorg commented. \"The Martian Ruler of the Little People was\r\nassassinated an hour ago. You heard that coming up?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said; but I had imagined as much. \"Did they say--\"\r\n\r\n\"They said nothing,\" Dr. Brende put in. \"The flash of a dozen helioed\r\nwords--no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"It went dark, like Venus?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Just discontinued. I judge they're excited up there--the Bureau\r\ndisorganized perhaps--I don't know. That was the last we got at the\r\nhouse, just before you came down. There may be something in there\r\nnow--you Inter-Allied people are pretty reliable.\"\r\n\r\nThe ruler of the Venus Central State, the leading monarch of Mars, and\r\nour three chief executives of Earth--murdered almost simultaneously! It\r\nwas incredible--any one of the murders would have been incredible--yet\r\nit was true.\r\n\r\nThere had been times--in the Inter-Allied Office, particularly--when I\r\nhad been insulated from aerial eavesdropping. But never had I felt the\r\nneed of it more than now. A constraint fell over me; I seemed afraid to\r\nsay anything. I think we all three felt very much like that; and it was\r\na relief when Elza arrived with my dainty little meal.\r\n\r\n\"Any word from Mars, Elza?\" her father asked.\r\n\r\nShe sat down beside me, helping me to the food.\r\n\r\n\"I did not look,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nShe did not look, because she was busy preparing my meal! Dear little\r\nElza! And because of my accursed extravagance--my poverty--no word of\r\nlove had ever passed between us!\r\n\r\nI thought I had never seen Elza so beautiful as this moment. A slim\r\nlittle thing, perfectly formed and matured, and inches shorter than I.\r\nThick brown hair braided, and hanging below her waist. A face--pretty as\r\nher mother's must have been--yet intellectual as her father's.\r\n\r\nI had taken Elza to the great music festivals of the city, and counted\r\nher the best dressed girl in all the vast throng. Tonight she was\r\ndressed simply. A grey-blue, tubular sort of skirt, clinging close to\r\nthe lines of her figure and split at the side for walking; a\r\ntight-fitting bodice, light in color (a man knows little of the\r\ntechnicalities of such things); throat bare, with a flaring rolled\r\ncollar behind--a throat like a rose-petal with the moonlight on it; arms\r\nbare, save for the upper, triangular sleeves.\r\n\r\nIt must suffice; I can only say she was adorable. Almost in silence I\r\nate my meal, with her beside me.\r\n\r\nGeorg went into the house once, to consult the news-tape. It was crowded\r\nwith Earth events--excitement, confusion everywhere--inconsequential\r\nreports, they seemed, by comparison with what had gone before. But of\r\nhelios from Mars, or Venus, there were none reported. Of Venus, the tape\r\nsaid nothing save that each of our westward stations was vainly calling\r\nin turn, as the planet dropped toward its horizon.\r\n\r\nI finished my meal--too leisurely for Georg and the doctor; and then we\r\nall went into the house, to the insulated room where at last we could\r\ntalk openly.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the main corridor, we heard the low voice of the\r\nInter-Allied news-announcer, coming from the disc in a room nearby.\r\n\r\n_\"And Venus----\"_\r\n\r\nThe words caught our attention. We hurried in, and stood by the\r\nInter-Allied equipment. Georg picked up the pile of tape whereon the\r\nannouncer's words were being printed. He ran back over it.\r\n\r\n\"Another helio from Venus!\" he exclaimed. \"Ten minutes ago.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw his lips go tight together. He made no move to hide the\r\ntape from Elza, but she was beside him and already reading it. Her\r\nfingers switched off the announcer's droning voice.\r\n\r\n_\"Pacific Coastal Station,\"_ Elza read. In the sudden silence of the\r\nroom her voice was low, clear, and steady, though her hands were\r\ntrembling. _\"P.C.S. 10.42 Venus helio. 'Defeat! Beware Tarrano! Notify\r\nyour Dr. Brende in Eurasia, danger.'\"_\r\n\r\nWe men stared at each other. But Elza went on reading.\r\n\r\n_\"P.C.S. 10.44 Venus helio. 'Lost! No more! Smashing apparatus!' The\r\nVenus sending station went dark at 10.44.30. Hawaiian station will call\r\nlater, but have little hope of re-establishing connection. Tokyohama\r\n10.46 Official, via Potomac National Headquarters. Excitement here\r\ncontinues. Levels crowded----\"_\r\n\r\nElza dropped the tape. \"That's all of importance. Venus Central Station\r\nwarning _you_, father.\"\r\n\r\nA buzz across the room called the doctor to his personal receiver. It\r\nwas a message in code from Potomac National Headquarters. We watched the\r\nqueer-looking characters printing on the tape. Very softly, in a voice\r\nhardly above a whisper, Georg decoded it.\r\n\r\n_\"Dr. Brende, see P.C.S. 10.42, warning you, probably of Venus\r\nimmigrants now here. Do you need guard? Or will you come to Washington\r\nat once for personal safety?\"_\r\n\r\n\"Father!\" cried Elza.\r\n\r\nGeorg burst out. \"Enough of this. We cannot--dare not talk in here.\r\nFather, come----\"\r\n\r\nWe went out into the corridor again, across which was the small room\r\ninsulated from all aerial vibrations. In the corridor a figure was\r\nstanding--the one other member of the Brende household--the\r\nmaid-servant, a girl about Elza's age. I knew her well, of course, but\r\nthis evening I had forgotten her existence. She was standing in the\r\ncorridor. Did I imagine it, or had she been gazing up at the mechanism\r\nten feet above the floor--the mechanism controlling the insulated room?\r\n\r\n\"You wish me, Miss Elza? I thought I heard you call.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Ahla, not 'til later.\"\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of respect, the girl withdrew, passing from our sight\r\ndown the incline which led to the lower part of the house.\r\n\r\nIt was a very small incident, but in view of what was transpiring, it\r\ngave me a shock nevertheless.\r\n\r\nFor Elza's maid was a Venus girl!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_Spy in the House_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insulated room was small, with a dome-shaped ceiling, no windows,\r\nand but one small, heavy door through which we entered, closing it\r\ncarefully behind us.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" Dr. Brende exclaimed. \"Now we can talk freely.\"\r\n\r\nBut I was not satisfied. \"That girl, Ahla--can you trust her?\"\r\n\r\nThey all looked at me in surprise. When one is close to danger,\r\nsometimes one recognizes it least; with Ahla in this household for over\r\na year now, they could not imagine her an enemy.\r\n\r\n\"I saw her looking up at the insulator,\" I added swiftly. \"Out there in\r\nthe corridor. Am I talking wild? Perhaps I am. But she seemed startled;\r\nand she was standing just under the insulator, wasn't she?\"\r\n\r\n\"But--\" began Elza.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" I exclaimed. \"When I first saw the President fall, at Park\r\nSixty, I felt that a Venus man had done it. These other murders--they're\r\nall the same. Done by Venus men of the Cold Country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ahla's country,\" Elza murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Exactly. And the Venus Central State has been attacked and has\r\nfallen. An assassination on Mars, and three here on Earth--all\r\nsimultaneously. It's one gigantic plot, I tell you--and the Cold Country\r\nof Venus is at the bottom of it.\"\r\n\r\nGeorg jumped to his feet. \"I'll see if the room has been tampered with.\"\r\n\r\nHe was back presently. \"The insulator is intact. I set the alarm bell.\r\nIf she touches it--\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the cookery, where she should be. I told her we would eat in an\r\nhour. That ought to keep her busy.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Brende made an attempt at a smile. \"I think we are all a little\r\noverwrought--though with reason, no doubt. Sit down, Jac. Elza, come\r\nhere by me. Don't look so solemn, child.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew Elza to him, with his arm about her. I would have spoken, but\r\nhis gesture checked me. \"I have much to say, Jac. I think I understand\r\nthese events, perhaps better than any of you. Let me go back two\r\nyears--when I was in the Venus Central State.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded my remembrance; and he went on:\r\n\r\n\"At that time the authorities there were greatly perturbed. They were\r\nmenaced by rebellion in the Cold Country. They would not let the Cold\r\nCountry people into the Central State, for it is already overcrowded.\r\nYou did not know that, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the threatened rebellion?\" I asked. \"They were trying to keep\r\nit secret, but we heard rumors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so. And Jac, I will tell you why they kept it secret. The Central\r\nState was encouraging emigration to the Earth. The Venus Cold Country is\r\na poor place to live in--and on a whole its inhabitants are miserable\r\npeople. Villainous, too, I should say. The Central State did not want\r\nthem within its borders; and so it kept secret its troubles with\r\nthem--and encouraged emigration to the Earth.\r\n\r\n\"We--as you know--make no distinction between Venus people. We are\r\nfriendly with the Central State, and the Cold Country is governed by\r\nit--or was until tonight. Thus, you see, we have been in the position of\r\nhaving to receive these renegade immigrants. Shut out from all the good\r\nland and decent climate of Venus, they began coming here.\r\n\r\n\"But we did not want them, and of late we have been holding them off,\r\ncutting the quota allowed very materially. Last week, as you also know,\r\nin Triple Conference, our three races decided to allow at each Inferior\r\nConjunction of the Earth and Venus, so small a quota that the Central\r\nState protested vigorously.\r\n\r\n\"The controversy has been hot; but the Central State--trying to foist\r\noff its undesirables on us--knows it is in the wrong. And fundamentally,\r\nit is friendly to us--I think it has proven that in the last two hours.\"\r\n\r\nAgain I would have spoken, but he went on at once.\r\n\r\n\"I know you're familiar with most of this, Jac. But you news-gatherers\r\nsometimes reason in too lurid a fashion. Let me go on. Mars was drawn\r\ninto the affair. To extricate ourselves, we offered to admit--under\r\ntemporary guard--all Venus immigrants who would pass on at once--at the\r\nfirst astronomical opportunity--to Mars. This would have been very nice\r\nfor us--but not for Mars.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are hot-headed, in Mars,\" Georg commented.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said the doctor. \"But very direct and forceful,\r\nnevertheless. They met our suggestion with a law excluding Venus\r\nimmigrants entirely. It was this, I think, that precipitated tonight's\r\nevents--though of course they must have been brewing for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"This Tarrano--\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"I heard of him when I was in Venus,\" said Dr. Brende. \"He was at that\r\ntime a lower official in the Cold Country. Evidently he has risen in his\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"I come now to conjecture--but I think it must be fairly close to truth.\r\nTarrano, leading the Cold Country, has risen to open rebellion. His\r\nattack upon the Central State must have come suddenly--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean, just this evening?\" Elza asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not. But hoping to quell the rebellion, the Central State\r\nhas suppressed news of it. At such a time--with this controversy going\r\non--such reports would only injure the Central State's inter-planetary\r\nposition. That's obvious, isn't it? Then tonight, when things were\r\ndesperate, the Central State gave out its call. Tarrano has conquered\r\nVenus, I'm sure. And at the last, before destroying its helio, the\r\nCentral State tried to warn us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what?\" I demanded. \"And what about these murders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Done by emissaries of Tarrano, no doubt. For revenge, because of the\r\nMartian and Earth legislation--or for--\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we should not speculate too much,\" said Georg. \"At least, not\r\non that line. They warned you personally, father. We were so careful to\r\nkeep everything secret--\"\r\n\r\nDr. Brende mopped his forehead. He was trying to appear calm--I knew he\r\ndid not want unduly to alarm Elza; but I could see that he was laboring\r\nunder great emotion nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"Things get out, Georg,\" he said. \"We have been careful--yes. But two\r\nyears ago, when I visited the Central State, I told them there what I\r\nhoped to accomplish. There were no grave inter-planetary problems\r\nthen--I thought I had no need of great secrecy. And since then, though,\r\nwe have been very careful--\"\r\n\r\nCareful! With a Venus girl from the Cold Country living in their\r\nhousehold! Truly, humans are a strange mixture of sagacity and folly!\r\n\r\n\"The Central State has heard something concerning you,\" Georg said.\r\n\"That could easily happen--prisoners captured from Tarrano's forces, for\r\ninstance. With dispatches--or perhaps some intercepted aerial message.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was this secret they were discussing? I was the only one in the\r\nroom who did not know it. And why had Dr. Brende sent for me tonight?\r\n\r\nI asked him both questions. His face went even more solemn than it had\r\nbeen before.\r\n\r\n\"I sent for you, Jac, because in a measure I anticipated what has now\r\nbefallen. Danger specifically to us Brendes, I mean. We count you as our\r\nfriend--\"\r\n\r\nHow it warmed my heart to hear him say that; and to see the glance that\r\nElza cast me!\r\n\r\n\"--Our friend. I am an old man--you are young. Yet you are wise, too. We\r\nneed you tonight.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand when I would have told him how glad I was to be with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"You know something of my work,\" he said, as a statement, rather than a\r\nquestion. \"I should say, mine and Georg's and Elza's, for they have both\r\nhelped me materially.\"\r\n\r\nI knew that Dr. Brende had for years been one of the Earth's most\r\neminent research physicians. It was he who discovered the light\r\nvibrations which had banished forever the dread germs of several of the\r\nmajor diseases. He did not practice; his work was research only.\r\n\r\nHe went on: \"Jac, I have found what for years I have been striving to\r\nfind--a vibration of light, though it is invisible--which so far as I\r\ncan determine, kills every bacillus harmful to man. There is nothing new\r\nin the idea--I have been working at it all my life. Sunlight! Altered\r\nand modified in several particulars, yet sunlight nevertheless. How\r\nstrange that for countless centuries, man never realized the blessed\r\nboon of sunlight--the greatest enemy of all disease!\r\n\r\n\"Each year, as you know, I have conquered some of what we call the major\r\ndiseases. A few of them--cancer[5], for instance--persisted in eluding\r\nme. Its bacilli--you can easily recognize the tiny purplish, horned rods\r\nwhich cause what we popularly call cancer--just would not die. No form\r\nof light or other vibration I could devise, seemed to hurt them--unless\r\nI used a vibration harmful, even fatal, to the blood-contents itself: I\r\nkilled the cancer--in the words of you news-gatherers--but I also killed\r\nthe patient.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A medical word, translated here as _cancer_, though\r\npossibly not that.]\r\n\r\nHis eyes smiled at the jest, but his face remained intensely serious.\r\n\r\n\"Then, Jac, I solved that problem--just a few months ago. And upon the\r\nheels of it I solved another, of infinitely more importance.\" He paused\r\nslightly. \"I have learned how to kill, or at least arrest, the bacillus\r\nof old age. It is a bacillus, you know. We grow old because every day we\r\nlive beyond the age of thirty--the bacillus of old age is attacking us.\r\nI call them the Brende-bacilli--these tiny, frayed discs that make us\r\ngrow old. I have seen them--and killed them!\"\r\n\r\nIt dawned on me slowly, the import of what he was saying.\r\n\r\n\"You mean----\"\r\n\r\n\"He means,\" said Georg, \"that at present we cannot only banish\r\ndisease--all disease--but we can keep your body from aging. Not\r\npermanently, doubtless--but with the span of life lengthened threefold\r\nat least. Only by violence now need you die prematurely.\"\r\n\r\nThis then was the secret the existence of which Tarrano had learned. He\r\nhad....\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Brende was quietly voicing my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"It seems obvious, Jac, that this Tarrano at least suspects that I have\r\nmade some such discovery as this. That he would withhold it from\r\nmankind, for the benefit of his own race, seems also obvious. That he is\r\nabout to make an attempt to get it from me, I am convinced.\"\r\n\r\nI remembered the wording of the message of warning from the Central\r\nState. _\"Your Dr. Brende, in Eurasia.\"_ I mentioned it.\r\n\r\n\"Our main laboratory is there,\" Georg said. \"In Northern\r\nSiberia--isolated from people so far as possible, and in a climate\r\nadvantageous for the work.\"\r\n\r\nElza spoke for the first time in many minutes.\r\n\r\n\"We have guards there, Jac--eight of our assistants.... Father, I called\r\nRobins a while ago. He said everything was all right. But don't you\r\nthink we should call him again?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor had drifted into deep thought. \"What? Oh, yes, Elza. I was\r\nthinking we should go there. My notes--descriptions of how to build a\r\nlarger apparatus--larger than the small model I have installed there--my\r\nnotes are all there, and I want them. And I don't think, at such a time,\r\nI should trust Robins to bring them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I send to Headquarters?\" Georg asked. \"They wanted an\r\nanswer, you remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going there to the Potomac--tell them that. Tell them we will come\r\nthere for safety. But first I must get my notes, and the model.\"\r\n\r\nAs Georg went to the door, something in his attitude made us all start\r\nto our feet and follow him. No alarm from the insulator had come, yet\r\nfor myself I had not forgotten that Venus girl outside.\r\n\r\nGeorg was at the door, tense as though to spring forward as soon as he\r\nopened it. I was close behind him.\r\n\r\n\"What----\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, Jac! Quiet! I just want to see--in case she _is_ doing\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nHe jerked open the door suddenly and bounded through, with me after him.\r\n\r\nThe corridor was empty. But there was a whirring coming from the\r\ninstrument room.\r\n\r\nWe leaped across the padded corridor. In the instrument room, Ahla the\r\nmaid sat at the table with a head-piece clasped to her ears. She was\r\ntalking softly but swiftly into the transmitter. In the mirror beside\r\nher I caught a glimpse of the place to which she was talking. A sort of\r\ncave--flickering lights--a crowd of dark figures of Venus men, seemingly\r\narmed.\r\n\r\nShe must have heard us coming. A sweep of her white arm dashed the\r\nmirror to the floor, smashing it. Then she cast off the head-piece, and\r\nleaping to her feet, faced us, blazing and defiant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_To the North Pole_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You stand back! You do not touch me!\"\r\n\r\nThe Venus girl fairly hissed the words. Her eyes were dilated; her white\r\nhair hung in a tumbling, wavy mass over her shoulders. She stood\r\ntense--a frail, girlish figure in a short, grey-cloth mantle, with long\r\ngrey stockings beneath.\r\n\r\nWe were startled. Georg stopped momentarily; then he jumped at her. It\r\nwas a false move, for before we could reach her, with a piercing cry,\r\nshe was tearing at the instruments on the table; her fingers, with burns\r\nunheeded, ripping the delicate wires, smashing the small mirrors,\r\nflinging everything to the floor.\r\n\r\nA few seconds only, but it was enough. She was panting when Georg caught\r\nher by the wrists, and we others gathered around them.\r\n\r\n\"Ahla!\" Elza cried in horror.\r\n\r\nI can appreciate the shock to Elza, who had trusted, even loved this\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nDr. Brende stood in confused astonishment, staring at the wreck of the\r\ninstrument table. From a naked wire a little black coil of smoke was\r\ncoming up. I fumbled about and switched the current out of everything.\r\n\r\nWe were cut off from all communication with the world. It gave me a\r\nqueer feeling--made the small island we were on seem so remote.\r\n\r\nGeorg was shaking the girl, demanding with whom she had been talking and\r\nwhy. But she fell into sullen silence, and nothing we could do would\r\nmake her break it. It infuriated me, that stubbornness; it was all I\r\ncould do to keep from harming her in my efforts to make her talk.\r\n\r\nGeorg, at last, pulled me away; he led the girl to a couch and sternly\r\nbade her sit there without moving. She seemed willing enough to do that;\r\nshe still had not spoken, but her eyes were watching us closely.\r\n\r\nDr. Brende was examining the smashed instruments. \"Ruined. We cannot use\r\nthem. Those messages--we must send them. I must talk to Robins----\"\r\n\r\nWe went into the corridor, out of earshot of the girl, but where we\r\ncould watch her. That we were in immediate danger was obvious, and we\r\nall realized it. Ahla had told some of her people that we were here on\r\nthe island; doubtless was planning to have them come here at once and\r\nseize us.\r\n\r\nHow far away from us were they? I had seen in the mirror the interior of\r\na cave-like room. Where was it? Might it not be near at hand--over on\r\nthe mainland? Might not these enemies arrive on the island at any\r\nmoment?\r\n\r\nGeorg suggested that we send our messages from the aeros. We had my own\r\ncar--and a larger car of the Brendes. More than ever now, Dr. Brende was\r\nworried over the safety of his Siberian laboratory; but from the aero we\r\ncould talk to Robins.\r\n\r\nWe went to the landing stage. I wanted to tie up Ahla, but as Georg\r\nsaid, she could do nothing now that the instrument room was out of\r\ncommission. We admonished her sternly to stay where she was, and left\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nOn the open landing stage my small aero was lying where I had left it;\r\nbut a moment's glance showed us it was wrecked--its instruments and its\r\ndriving mechanism demolished!\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it now; Ahla had planned to keep us on the\r\nisland while her people came and seized us. Fortunately the Brende car\r\nwas well housed and barred. We saw that the gates had been tampered\r\nwith, but with the limited time Ahla had to work in, she had been unable\r\nto force them. We swung them wide, and to our infinite relief found the\r\ncar unharmed.\r\n\r\nAt once Dr. Brende called Robins. But the laboratory did not answer!\r\n\r\n\"It may be your sending apparatus,\" I suggested. \"Send your message down\r\nto Headquarters--with their high power they'll get Robins quickly\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\nHe tried that--sending also his answer to the previous coded message\r\nHeadquarters had sent him. It was now 11:45. We waited some eight\r\nminutes, during which time I rushed back to the house. Ahla was sitting\r\nobediently where I had left her.\r\n\r\n\"You stay there,\" I told her. \"If you move, I'll break every bone in\r\nyour rotten little body.\"\r\n\r\nBack at the landing stage I found Dr. Brende in despair. Headquarters\r\ncould not raise Robins. They had relayed the message to Wrangel and\r\nSpitzbergen Islands--but the stations there reported similarly. Dr.\r\nBrende's laboratory did not answer its call.\r\n\r\nThis decided us. We had no wish to remain where we were. The Brende car,\r\nfar larger than the small one of mine, was fully equipped and\r\nprovisioned. We rolled it out, and in a moment were flying in the air.\r\n\r\nDr. Brende's car was large, commodious, and smooth-riding. A pleasure to\r\nfly in such a car! Georg was at the controls. I sat close beside Elza in\r\nthe semi-darkness, gazing down through the pit-rail window to where the\r\nisland was dropping away beneath us. It was a perfect night; the moon\r\nhad set; the stars and planets gleamed in an almost cloudless sky. Red\r\nMars, I saw, very nearly over our heads.\r\n\r\nIt was now midnight, and for the moment we chanced to have the air to\r\nourselves. We rose to the 10,000-foot level, then headed directly North.\r\nIt carried us inland; soon the sea was out of sight behind. Lights\r\ndotted the landscape--a town or city here and there, and occasionally a\r\ntower.\r\n\r\nDr. Brende was poring over charts, illumined by a dim glow-light beside\r\nhim. \"Can we get power all the way, Georg?... Elza child, hadn't you\r\nbetter lie down? A long trip--you'll be tired out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call Royal Mountain[6],\" Georg suggested. \"Ask them about serving us\r\npower; I'll stay 10,000 or below. Under one thousand, when we get\r\nfurther north. Ask them if they can guarantee us power all the way.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Now Montreal.]\r\n\r\nThe station at Royal Mountain would guarantee us nothing on this night;\r\nthey advised us to keep low. Their own power-sending station was working\r\nas usual. But this night--who could tell what General Orders might come?\r\nEveryone's nerves were frayed; this Director demanded gruffly to know\r\nwho we were.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him none of his business,\" I put in. My own nerves were frayed,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\"Quiet!\" warned Georg. \"He'll hear you--and it _is_ his business if he\r\nwants to make it so. Tell him we are the Inter-Allied News, father. That\r\nis true enough, and no use putting into the air that Dr. Brende is\r\nflying north.\"\r\n\r\nRoyal Mountain let us through. We passed well to the east of it about\r\n12:45--too far away to sight its lights. The cross-traffic was somewhat\r\nheavier here. Beneath it, at 5,000 and 6,000 feet, a steady stream of\r\ncars was passing east and west.\r\n\r\nWe were riding easily--little wind, almost none--and were doing 390\r\nmiles an hour. You cannot bank or turn very well at such a speed; it is\r\ninjurious to the human body. But our course was straight north. Dr.\r\nBrende showed it to me on his chart--north, following the 70th West\r\nMeridian. Compass corrections as we got further north--and astronomical\r\nreadings, these would take us direct to the Pole. I could never fathom\r\nthis air navigation; I flew by tower lights, and landmarks--but to Dr.\r\nBrende and Georg, the mathematics of it were simple.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock we had crossed the route of the Chicago-Great London Mail\r\nflyer. But we did not see the vessel. The temperature was growing\r\nsteadily colder. The pit was inclosed, and I switched on the heaters.\r\nElza had fallen asleep on the side couch, with my promise to awaken her\r\nat the first sign of dawn.\r\n\r\nAt two-thirty, the Greater New York-East Indian Express overhauled us\r\nand passed overhead. It was flying almost north, bound for Bombay and\r\nCeylon via Novaya Zemlya. It was in the 18,000-foot lane. The air up\r\nthere was clear, but beneath us a fog obscured the land.\r\n\r\nAt intervals all this time Dr. Brende had been trying to raise\r\nRobins--but there was still no answer. We did not discuss what might be\r\nthe trouble. Of what use could such talk be?\r\n\r\nBut it perturbed us, for imagination can picture almost anything. Georg\r\neven felt the strain of it, for he said almost gruffly:\r\n\r\n\"Stop it, father. I don't think you should call attention to us so much.\r\nGet the meteorological reports from the Pole--we need them. If they tell\r\nus this weather will hold at 10,000 and below, we'll make good time.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after three o'clock we swept over Hudson Strait into Baffinland. We\r\nwere down to 4,000 feet, but the fog still lay under us like a blanket.\r\nIt clung low; we were well above it, in a cloudless night, with no wind\r\nsave the rush of our forward flight.\r\n\r\nThen came the pink flush of dawn. True to my promise I awakened Elza.\r\nBut there was nothing for her to see; the stars growing pale, pink\r\nspreading into orange, and then the sun. But the fog under us still lay\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nWe were holding our speed very nearly at 380 an hour. By daylight--about\r\nfive o'clock, after a light meal--we were over Baffin Bay. I had\r\nrelieved Georg at the controls. The headlands of North Greenland lay\r\nbefore us. Then the fog lifted a little, broke away in places. The water\r\nbecame visible--drift and slush-ice of the Spring, with lines of open\r\nwater here and there.\r\n\r\nAnd then the fog closed down again, lifting momentarily at six o'clock\r\nwhen we passed over the north-western tip of Greenland. The tower there\r\ngave us its routine signal, which we answered in kind. There was little\r\ntraffic along here; a few local cars in the lowest lanes.\r\n\r\nShortly after six, when we were above Grantland, another of the great\r\ntrans-Arctic passenger liners went over us. The San Francisco Night\r\nline, for Mid-Eurasia and points South. It was crossing Greenland, from\r\nSan Francisco, Vancouver, Edmonton, to the North Cape, the Russias, and\r\nAfrican points south of Suez.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock, with the sun circling the lower sky, the fog under us\r\nsuddenly dissipated completely. We were over the Polar ocean. Masses of\r\ndrift ice and slush, but for the most part surprisingly clear. At eight\r\no'clock, flying low--no more than a thousand feet--we sighted the steel\r\ntower with foundations sunk into the ocean's depths which marks the top\r\nof our little Earth.\r\n\r\nWe flashed by the tower in a moment, answering the director's signal\r\nperfunctorily. Southward now, on the 110th East Meridian, without\r\ndeviating from the straight course we had held.\r\n\r\nIt was truly a beautiful sight, this Polar ocean. Masses of ice,\r\nglittering in the morning sunlight. A fog-bank to the left; but\r\neverywhere else patches of green water and floes that gleamed like\r\nmillions of precious stones as they flung back the light to us. Or\r\nagain, a mass of low, solid ice, flushed pink in the morning light. And\r\nbehind us, just above the horizon, a segment of purple sky where a storm\r\nwas gathering--a deep purple which was mirrored in the placid patches of\r\nopen water, and darkened the ice-floes to a solemn, sombre hue.\r\n\r\nElza was entranced, though she had made many trans-Polar trips. But\r\nGeorg, now again at the controls, kept his eyes on the instruments; and\r\nthe doctor, trying vainly once more to talk with his laboratory, now so\r\nclose ahead of us, sat in moody silence.\r\n\r\nIt was 9:38 when we sighted, well off to the right, the rocky headland\r\nof Cape Chelusin[7]--the most northerly point of Eurasia. A long, low\r\ncliff of grey rock, ridged white with snow in its clefts. We swung\r\ntoward it, at greatly decreased speed, and at an altitude of only a few\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Now Cape Chelyuskin, Laimur Peninsula, Siberia.]\r\n\r\nThis was all a bleak, desolate region--curiously so--and I think, one of\r\nthe very few so desolate on Earth. As we advanced, the Siberian coast\r\nspread out before us. Mountains behind, and a strip of rocky lowland\r\nalong the sea. There were patches of snow--the mountains were white with\r\nit; but on the lowlands, for the most part the Spring sun had already\r\nmelted it. The Spring was well advanced; there were many open channels\r\nin the water over which we were skimming--drift-ice, and slush-ice which\r\nsoon would be gone.\r\n\r\nCape Chelusin! It was here that Dr. Brende had placed his Arctic\r\nlaboratory--as far from the haunts of man as he could find--a hundred\r\nmiles from the nearest person, so he told me. And as I gazed about me I\r\nrealized how isolated we were. Not a car in the whole circular panorama\r\nof sky; no sign of vessel on the water; no towns on the land.\r\n\r\nIt was just after ten in the morning when we dropped silently to the\r\nsmall landing stage a hundred yards or so from the shore. We disembarked\r\nin the sunlight of what would have been a pleasant December morning in\r\nGreater New York; and I gazed about me curiously. A level lowland of\r\ncrags with the white of snow in their hollows; a collection of broad,\r\nlow buildings nearby, with a narrow steel viaduct running down to them\r\nfrom the landing stage. And behind everything, the frowning headland of\r\nthe Cape.\r\n\r\nThe buildings stood silent, without sign of life. There was no one in\r\nsight anywhere. No one out to greet us; I thought it a little strange\r\nbut I said nothing.\r\n\r\nWe started down the viaduct. Under us, in patches of soil, I could see\r\nthe vivid colors of the little Arctic flowers already rearing their\r\nheads to the Spring sunlight. I called Elza's attention to them. A vague\r\napprehension was within me; my heart was pounding unreasonably. But this\r\nwas Dr. Brende's affair, not mine; and I wanted to hide my perturbation\r\nfrom Elza.\r\n\r\nThe viaduct reached the ground; a path led on to the houses.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Dr. Brende called out:\r\n\r\n\"Robins! Robins! Grantley! Where are you!\"\r\n\r\nThe words seemed to echo back faintly to us; but the buildings remained\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better wait here with Elza,\" Georg said.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go on--see what----\"\r\n\r\nHe checked his words, and started forward. But Dr. Brende was with him,\r\nand in doubt what to do I followed with Elza.\r\n\r\nWe entered the nearest building, into a low, dim room, with doors on the\r\nsides. In the silence I seemed to hear my heart pounding my ribs. Elza's\r\nface was pale and perturbed, but she smiled very courageously at me.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" said Georg. \"You wait here.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned into a side door leading to another room, and in an instant\r\nwas back with a face from which the color had departed.\r\n\r\n\"They're not in there,\" he said unsteadily. \"Elza--you go outside with\r\nfather.... They must be around somewhere, Jac. Come, look.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a rustle behind us. Arms came around me, pinning me. I heard\r\nElza scream, saw Georg fighting two dark forms which had leaped upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI was flung to the ground, but I fought--three men, it seemed to be, who\r\nwere upon me. Then Georg's voice:\r\n\r\n\"Jac! Stop--they'll kill you.\"\r\n\r\nI yielded suddenly, and my assailants jerked me to my feet. A group of\r\nVenus men were surrounding us. Georg, his jacket torn to ribbons, was\r\nbacked up against the wall with three or four Venus men holding him.\r\n\r\nAnd on the floor nearby Dr. Brende lay prone, with a crimson stain\r\nspreading on his white ruffled shirt, and Elza sobbing over him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_Outlawed Flight_\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Brende was dead. We knew it in the moment that followed our sudden\r\nassault and capture. Elza knelt there sobbing. Then she stood up, her\r\ntears checked; and on her face a look of pathetic determination to\r\nrepress her grief. Now that we had yielded, the Venus men, searching us\r\nfor our weapons, cast us loose. We bent over Dr. Brende, Georg and I.\r\nDead. No power in this universe could bring him back to us.\r\n\r\nGeorg pressed his lips tightly together. His face, red from the exertion\r\nof his fight, went pale. But he showed no other emotion. And, as he\r\nleaned toward me, he whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Got us, Jac! Say nothing. Don't put up any show of fight.\"\r\n\r\nElza now was standing against the wall, a hand before her eyes. I went\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\"Elza, dear----\"\r\n\r\nHer hand pressed mine.\r\n\r\nOur captors stood curiously watching us. There seemed to be at least ten\r\nof them--men as tall as myself, though not so tall as Georg. Swarthy,\r\ngray-skinned fellows--one or two of them squat, ape-like with their\r\nheavy shoulders and dangling arms. Men of the Venus Cold Country. They\r\nwere talking together in their queer, soft language. One of them I took\r\nto be the leader. Argo was his name, I afterward learned. He was\r\nsomewhat taller than the rest, and slim. A man perhaps thirty. Paler of\r\nskin than most of his companions--gray skin with a bronze cast. Dressed\r\nlike the others in fur. But his heavy jacket was open, disclosing a\r\nruffled white shirt, with a low black stock about his throat.\r\n\r\nA shifty-eyed fellow, this Argo. Smooth-shaven, with a mouth\r\nslack-lipped, and small black eyes. But his features were finely\r\nchiseled; and with that bronze cast to his skin, I guessed that he was\r\nfrom the Venus Central State. He seemed much perturbed that Dr. Brende\r\nwas dead. Occasionally he burst into English as he rebuked one of the\r\nothers for the killing.\r\n\r\nNo more than a moment had passed. Georg joined Elza and me. We stood\r\nwaiting. Georg whispered: \"They killed Robins and his helpers. In\r\nthere----\" He gestured. \"I saw them lying in there. If only I had--\"\r\n\r\nArgo was standing before us. \"This is a very pleasant surprise--\" He\r\nspoke the careful English of the educated foreigner. His tone was\r\nironical. \"Very pleasant--\"\r\n\r\nAbruptly he turned away again. But in that instant, his eyes had roved\r\nElza in a way that turned me cold.\r\n\r\nThey led us away, down a padded hallway into the instrument room. It was\r\nin full operation; our Inter-Allied news-tape was clicking; the low\r\nvoice of the announcer droned through the silence. I started toward the\r\ntape, but Argo waved me away. He had volunteered us nothing, and again\r\nGeorg advised silence.\r\n\r\nArgo had given his orders. Through a window I saw men carrying apparatus\r\nfrom the house. A small metal frame of sun-mirrors, prisms and vacuum\r\ntubes. Georg whispered: \"Father's model.\"\r\n\r\nThe man with it passed beyond my sight. Others came along, carrying the\r\ncylinders of books--Dr. Brende's notes--and a variety of other\r\nparaphernalia. Carrying it back from the shore toward the headlands of\r\nthe Cape, where I realized now they had an aero secreted.\r\n\r\nArgo was at a mirror; he had a head-piece on; he was talking into a\r\ndisc--talking in a private code. I could see the surface of the small\r\nmirror. A room, with windows. Through one of the windows, by daylight,\r\npalms and huge banana leaves were visible. A room seemingly in the\r\ntropics of our own hemisphere.\r\n\r\nArgo was triumphant--explaining, doubtless, that he had captured us.\r\nMingled with his voice, the Inter-Allied announcer was saying:\r\n\r\n_\"Greater-New York 10.32 Martian Helio, via Tokyohama: Little People\r\nProclamation----\"_\r\n\r\nA man standing near the tape switched off the droning voice. At the\r\nreceiving table, every few seconds came the buzz of the laboratory's\r\ncall. Wrangel Island again calling Robins; but no one paid any heed.\r\nArgo finished at the mirror. He glanced over the tape, smiling\r\nsardonically. Then, methodically, deliberately, he swept the instruments\r\nto the floor, jerked out the connections, turned out the\r\ncurrent--wrecked it all with a few strokes. A moment later we were taken\r\naway.\r\n\r\nOutside, from back by the low reaches of the Cape, we saw an aero\r\nrising. They had loaded it with Dr. Brende's effects, and in it half of\r\nthe men were departing. It rose vertically until we could see it only as\r\na speck in the blue of the morning sky--a speck vanishing to the north\r\nover the Pole.\r\n\r\nWith four or five of the men--all those remaining--Argo took us three to\r\nthe Brende car. We did not pass Dr. Brende's body, lying there in the\r\nouter room. Elza and Georg gazed that way involuntarily; but they said\r\nnothing. The greatest grief is that which is hidden, and never once\r\nafterward did either of them show it by more than an affectionate word\r\nfor that father whom they had loved so dearly.\r\n\r\nSoon we were back in the Brende car in which we had landed no more than\r\nan hour before. It was a standard Byctin model--evidently Argo and his\r\nmen knew how to operate it perfectly. We were herded into the pit, and\r\nin a moment more were in the air.\r\n\r\nArgo seemed now rather anxious to make friends with us. He was in a high\r\ngood humor. His eyes flashed at me sharply when I questioned him once or\r\ntwice; but he offered us no indignities. To Elza he spoke commandingly,\r\nbut with that deference to which every woman of birth and breeding is\r\nentitled from a man.\r\n\r\nWe rose straight up and, at 18,000 feet, headed northward by a point or\r\ntwo west. We would pass the Pole on our right--too far to sight it with\r\nthe naked eye, I realized; but I knew, too, that the Director there\r\nwould see the distant image of us on his finder, even though we refused\r\nconnection should he call us. And we had no right to be up here in the\r\n18,000-foot lane. They'd order us down--shut off our power, if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe could not escape observation on this daylight flight. Heading this\r\nway, it would take us past the Pole and on southward, down the Western\r\nHemisphere over the Americas. We could not refuse connection for long.\r\nWe would be challenged, then brought down. Or, if Argo answered a call,\r\nsome Director would examine our pit with his finder--would see Elza,\r\nGeorg and me as prisoners. We could gesture surreptitiously to him....\r\n\r\nMy thoughts ran on. Argo's soft, ironic voice brought me out of them.\r\n\r\n\"We will answer the first call that comes,\" he said smilingly. \"You\r\nunderstand? We are the Inter-Allied News on Official Dispatch.\" He was\r\naddressing me, his glance going to the insignia on my cap. \"_You_ are of\r\nthe Inter-Allied?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\nI did not like his tone. \"None of your--\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet, Jac,\" Georg warned.\r\n\r\n\"Jac Hallen,\" I amended.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Division 8, Manhattan,\" he read from my cap. \"Well, when the first\r\nDirector calls--from the Pole perhaps--you will tell him we are\r\nInter-Allied Officials. He will see us here--I do not believe, the way\r\nwe are sitting, that he will think anything is wrong. He will see us of\r\nVenus. There are Venus men employed by the Inter-Allied. Is it not so?\"\r\n\r\nI had to admit that it was. He nodded. \"You will fool the Directors, Jac\r\nHallen. You understand? You will get the reports on weather today down\r\nthe 67th Meridian West. And ask if we can have power to the Equator and\r\nbelow.\" His eyes flashed. \"And if you attempt any trickery--you will\r\ndie. You understand?\"\r\n\r\nI did, indeed. And I knew that his plans were well laid--that I would be\r\nhelpless to give us over without paying for it with my life--with the\r\nlives of Elza and Georg as well.\r\n\r\nFrom up here in the 18th lane, the Polar ocean lay a glittering white\r\nand purple expanse beneath us. Then, again, a fog rolled out down there\r\nlike a blanket. We passed the Pole, a hundred miles or more to one side,\r\nand headed Southward. No challenge. Under us, occasional local cars\r\nswept by; but up here we were clear of traffic.\r\n\r\nElza prepared our lunch, in the little electric galley forward of the\r\nobservation pit. The Great London-East Indies Mail Flyer crossed us,\r\ncoming along this same level. It was headed toward the Pole from the\r\nBritish Isles. Its pilot challenged us before it had come up over the\r\nhorizon. A crusty fellow. His face in the mirror glared at me as I\r\naccepted connection. He ordered me down, Inter-Allied or no.\r\n\r\nArgo was at my elbow. His pencil-ray dug into my ribs. Had I made a\r\nfalse move it would have drilled me clean with its tiny burning light. I\r\ntold the pilot we would descend. It placated him; but he saw Argo's\r\nface, mumbled something about damned foreigners--general orders probably\r\ncoming tomorrow to clean out Venia--damned well rid of the traitors.\r\nThen he disconnected. Venia, Georg and I were sure, was where Argo was\r\nnow taking us. But the rest of his comments I did not clearly understand\r\nuntil later.\r\n\r\nWe descended, and the flyer came up over the horizon and passed us\r\noverhead. We were pointing southward now, had picked up the 67th West\r\nMeridian and were following it down. The Hays station[8] challenged us;\r\nbut they were satisfied with my explanation. Argo had us up in speed\r\naround four hundred miles per hour. We went down Davis Strait, over\r\nNewfoundland, avoiding the congested cross-traffic of mid-afternoon in\r\nthe lowest lanes, and out over the main Atlantic. Night closed down upon\r\nus. It was safer for Argo now. We flew without lights. Outlawed. Had\r\nthey caught us at it, we would have been brought down, captured by the\r\npatrol and imprisoned. Yet Argo doubtless considered the chance of that\r\nless dangerous than a reliance upon my ability to trick the succeeding\r\ndirectors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Hayes Peninsula, Northwest Greenland, near the present site\r\nof Etah.]\r\n\r\nWith darkness we ascended again to the upper mail lanes. Over the main\r\nEastern Atlantic now, and out here this night, there was little local\r\ntraffic. The mail and passenger liners went by at intervals--the\r\nspreading beams of their lurid headlights giving us warning enough so\r\nthat we could dive down and avoid being caught in their light. I prayed\r\nthat one of their lights might pick us up, but none did.\r\n\r\nNorth of Bermuda, a division of the North Atlantic patrol circled over\r\nus. The ocean was calm. Argo dropped us to the surface. We floated there\r\nlike a derelict--dark, silent, save for the lapping of the water against\r\nour aluminite pontoons. The patrol's searching beams swept within a\r\nhundred feet of us--missed us by a miracle. And as the patrol passed on,\r\nwe rose again to our course.\r\n\r\nArgo gave us one of the small cabins to ourselves that night. He was\r\nstill deferential to Elza, but in his manner and in the glitter of those\r\nlittle black eyes, there was irony, and an open, though unexpressed,\r\nadmiration for her beauty.\r\n\r\nWe slept little. Georg and I--one or the other of us--was awake all\r\nnight. We talked occasionally--not much, for speculation was of no\r\navail. We wondered what could be transpiring abroad through all these\r\nhours. Hours of unprecedented turmoil on Earth, and on our neighboring\r\nworlds. We wondered how the Central State of Venus might be faring with\r\nthe revolution. Would they ask aid of the Earth? This Tarrano--merely a\r\nname to us as yet, but a name already full of dread. Where was he? Had\r\nhe been responsible for all this? Dr. Brende's secret was in his hands\r\nnow, we were sure. What would he do next?\r\n\r\nAbout three o'clock in the morning--a fair, calm night--our power died\r\nabruptly. We were in the Caribbean Sea not far above the Northern coast\r\nof South America, at 15° North latitude, 67° West longitude. Our power\r\ndied. Elza was fast asleep, but the sudden quiet brought Georg and me to\r\nalertness. We joined Argo in the pit. He was perturbed, and cursing. We\r\ndropped, gliding down, for there was no need of picking a landing with\r\nthe emergency heliocopter batteries--glided down to the calm surface.\r\nFor a moment we lay there, rocking--a dark blob on the water. I heard a\r\nsudden sharp swish. An under-surface freight vessel, plowing from\r\nVenezuelan ports to the West Indian Islands, came suddenly to the\r\nsurface. Its headlight flashed on, but missed us. It sped past. I could\r\nsee the sleek black outline of its wet back, and the lines of foam as it\r\nsheered the water. We lay rocking in its wake as it disappeared\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nThen, without warning, our power came on again. An inadvertent break\r\nperhaps; or maybe some local or general orders. We did not know. Argo\r\nwas picking from the air occasional news, but he said nothing of it to\r\nus; and he was sending out nothing, of course.\r\n\r\nDawn found us over the mountains. The Director at Caracas challenged us.\r\nArgo kept me by his side constantly now. Dutifully we answered every\r\ncall. The local morning traffic was beginning to pick up; but we mingled\r\nwith it, at 8,000 feet and more, to clear the mountains comfortably.\r\n\r\nElza again cooked and, with Argo joining us, we had breakfast. Argo's\r\ngood nature continued, as we successfully approached the end of our\r\nflight. But still he volunteered nothing to us. We asked him no\r\nquestions. Elza was grave-faced, solemn. But she did not bother Georg\r\nand me with woman's fears. Bravely she kept her own counsel, anxious\r\nonly to be of help to us.\r\n\r\nWe passed over the Venezuelan Province, over the mountains and into\r\nAmazonia, headwaters of the great river--still on the 67th Meridian\r\nWest. The jungles here were sparsely settled; there were, I knew, no\r\nmore than a dozen standard cities of a million population, or over, in\r\nthe whole region of Western Brazilana. As we advanced, I noticed an\r\nunusual number of the armed government flyers above us. Many were\r\nhovering, almost motionless, as though waiting for orders. But none of\r\nthem molested us.\r\n\r\nNear the 10th parallel South latitude, we passed under a fleet of the\r\nwhite official vessels, with a division of the Brazilana patrol joined\r\nwith them. A hundred vessels hovering up there in an east and west\r\nline--a line a hundred miles long it must have been.\r\n\r\nHovering there, for what? We did not know; but Argo, leering up at them\r\ninsolently, may have guessed. They challenged us, but let us through.\r\n\r\n\"You are the last one in,\" this sub-director of the patrol told us. I\r\ncould see him in our mirror as his gaze examined our pit--a dapper,\r\njaunty fellow with the up-tilted mustache affected in Latina. \"Last one\r\nin--you Inter-Allied are a nuisance.\"\r\n\r\nHe was more particular than those directors we had passed before. My\r\nbadge and my verbal explanation were not enough. He made me show him the\r\nInter-Allied seal which I always carried, and I gave him the pass-code\r\nof the current week.\r\n\r\n\"Last one in,\" he reiterated. \"And you wouldn't get in now without those\r\nrefugees with you. Venia's closed after noon of today. Didn't you know\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is. They shut off the power early this morning for all low\r\nvibrations--yours and under. Brought 'em all down for a general traffic\r\ninspection. Then changed their minds and threw it on again. But if\r\nyou're coming out north again, you've got to get out by noon. And you go\r\nin at your own peril.\"\r\n\r\nHe assumed that Argo and his men were Venus refugees going with me into\r\nVenia! I only vaguely understood what might be afoot, but I did not dare\r\nquestion him. Argo's side glance at me was menacing. I agreed with this\r\ndirector obediently and broke connection.\r\n\r\nWe seemed now to have passed within the patrol line. There were no more\r\nofficial vessels to be seen. We clung low, and at 12° South, 60° 2O'\r\nWest, at 10:16 that morning we descended in Venia, capital of the\r\nCentral Latina Province, largest immigrant colony of the Western\r\nHemisphere.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Now Matto Grosso State, Brazil.]\r\n\r\nWe landed on a stage of one of the upper crescent terraces. A crowd of\r\nVenus people surrounded us. Even in the turmoil of our debarkation, I\r\nwondered where the official landing director might be. None of the\r\ngoverning officials were in sight. The place was in confusion. Crowds\r\nwere on the spider bridges; the terraces and the sloping steps were\r\njammed. Milling, excited people. The foreign police, pompous Venus men\r\nin gaudy uniforms, were herding the people about.\r\n\r\nBut none of our Earth officials! Where were they, who should have been\r\nin charge of all this confusion?\r\n\r\nMy heart sank. Something drastic, sinister, had occurred. We had no time\r\nto guess what it might be. Argo drove us forward, with scant courtesy\r\nnow, down in a vertical car, through a tunnel on foot to what they\r\ncalled here in Venia the Lower Plaza. We crossed it, and entered one of\r\ntheir queerly flat buildings at the ground level; entered through an\r\narchway, passed through several rooms and came at last into a room\r\nwhirring with instruments.\r\n\r\nArgo said triumphantly, yet humbly: \"Tarrano, Master--we are here.\"\r\n\r\nA man at a table of helio-sending instruments turned and faced us. We\r\nwere in the presence of the dread Tarrano!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_Man of Destiny_\r\n\r\n\r\nTarrano! He rose slowly to his feet, his gaze on us for an instant, then\r\nturning to Argo.\r\n\r\n\"So! You took them? Well done, Argo!\"\r\n\r\nHis gesture dismissed his subordinate; Argo backed from the room. From a\r\ndisc, an announcer was detailing dispatches. Tarrano frowned slightly.\r\nHe advanced to us as we three stood together. I had heard Elza give a\r\nlow, surprised cry as we entered. She stood with a hand upon my arm. I\r\ncould feel her trembling, but her face now was impassive.\r\n\r\nGeorg whispered to me: \"This Tarrano----\"\r\n\r\nBut our captor's voice checked him. \"Come this way, please.\" He\r\nsignalled, and three men came forward. To them he issued short commands;\r\nthey took their places at the instrument tables. Then he led us from the\r\nroom through an arch, over a small trestle, into a tiny inner courtyard.\r\nA tropical garden, surrounded by blank circular walls of the building. A\r\npatch of blue sky showed above it. A garden secluded from prying eyes,\r\nwith only a single spider bridge crossing overhead. Vivid flowers and\r\nfoliage made it a bower. Brown bark paths laced it; a tiny fountain\r\nsplashed in the center.\r\n\r\nTarrano sat on the rim of the fountain; he gestured to a white stone\r\nbench where we three sat in a row, Elza between us. It made me feel like\r\na child.\r\n\r\n\"Your father is dead.\" He was addressing Elza; and then Georg. \"That is\r\nunfortunate. He was a good man. I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was soft and musical. He sat there on the fountain rim, an\r\nelbow on his crossed knees, chin resting in his hand, his eyes studying\r\nus. A small, slight figure of a man, no more than thirty-five. Simply\r\ndressed; white trousers of the tropics, with a strip of narrow black\r\ndown the leg-fronts; a girdle of gold; ruffled white shirt, with sleeves\r\nthat flared a trifle, and a neck-piece of black. From his belt dangled a\r\nfew instruments and several personal weapons--beautifully wrought,\r\nsmall--almost miniatures--yet deadly-looking for all that.\r\n\r\nHe was bareheaded; black hair closely clipped. A face smooth-shaven.\r\nThin, with a nose hawk-like, and black eyes and heavy brows. His mouth\r\nwas thin-lipped, though smiling now, disclosing even, white teeth. Yet a\r\ncruel mouth, with the firm jaw of determination and power under it. The\r\nfamiliar gray Venus skin, but with that bronze cast of the people of the\r\nCentral State.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, not an unusual or particularly commanding figure. Yet\r\nthe man's power of personality, the sheer dominant force of him,\r\nradiated like a tower code-beam. No one could be in his presence an\r\ninstant without feeling it. A power that enwrapped you; made you feel\r\nlike a child. Helpless. Anxious to placate a possible wrath that would\r\nbe devastating; anxious--absurdly--for a smile. It was a radiation of\r\ngenius, humbling every mediocre mortal it touched.\r\n\r\nI felt it--felt all this from the moment I came into his presence. Felt\r\nlike a child, sitting there on that bench. Vaguely frightened; sullen,\r\nwith childish resentment at my superior. And over it all, my man's\r\nmentality made me angry at myself for such emotions; angry at the\r\nconsciousness of my own inferiority, forced upon me now more strongly\r\nthan ever anything or any one had made me feel it before.\r\n\r\nTarrano was smiling gently. \"... killed your father. I would not have\r\nhad it so. Yet--perhaps it was necessary. The Lady Elza----\"\r\n\r\nI could feel Elza trembling again. Georg burst out: \"What do you want of\r\nus? Who are you?\"\r\n\r\nTarrano's slim gray-brown hand came up.\r\n\r\n\"The Lady Elza remembers me----\" He seemed waiting with his gentle smile\r\nfor her to speak.\r\n\r\n\"They called you Taro then,\" she said. Her voice was the small, scared,\r\ndiffident voice of a child.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Taro. A mere sub-officer of the Central State. But destined for\r\nbigger things than that, as you see. They did not like what they called\r\nmy ambitious ways--and so they sent me to the Cold Country. That was\r\nsoon after I had met you and your father, Lady Elza. You hardly remarked\r\nme then--I was so insignificant a personage. But you--I remembered\r\nyou----\"\r\n\r\nStill there was in his voice and on his face nothing but kindness and a\r\nqueer whimsical look of reminiscence. He broke off at the buzz of a disc\r\nthat hung from his belt by a golden chain. He jerked it loose from its\r\nsnap, and to his ear clasped a small receiver. Like a mask his\r\ngentleness dropped from him. His voice rasped:\r\n\r\n\"Yes?...\" The receiver murmured into his ear. He said: \"Connect\r\nhim--I'll listen to what he has to say.\"\r\n\r\nA moment; then on the tiny mirror fastened to his wrist with a strap, I\r\nsaw a face appear--a face known throughout our Earth--the face of the\r\nWar-Director of Great London. Tarrano listened impassively. When the\r\nvoice ceased, he said without an instant's hesitation: \"No!\"\r\n\r\nA decision irrevocable; the power almost of a deity seemed behind its\r\nfinality. \"No! I--will--not--do--it!\" Careful, slow enunciation as\r\nthough to make sure an inferior mentality could not mistake his words.\r\nAnd with a click, Tarrano broke connection. The mirror went dark; he\r\nhung his little disc and ear-piece back on his belt. Again he was\r\nsmiling at us gently, the incident forgotten already--dismissed from his\r\nmind until the need to consider it should again arise.\r\n\r\n\"I remember you, Lady Elza, very well.\" A vague wistfulness came into\r\nhis voice. \"I wish to speak with you alone--now--for a moment.\" He\r\ntouched two of the metal buttons of his shirt-front together. A man\r\nappeared in the narrow tunnel-entrance to the garden. A small man, no\r\nmore than four and a half feet tall; a trim, but powerfully made little\r\nfigure, in the black and white linen uniform worn also by Tarrano. Yet\r\nmore pretentiously dressed than his superior. A broad belt of dangling\r\nweapons; under it, a sash of red, encircling his waist and flowing down\r\none side. Over his white ruffled shirt, a short sleeveless vest of black\r\nsilk. A circular hat, with a vivid plume. A smooth-shaven face; black\r\nhair long to the base of the neck; a deep, red-brown complexion. A\r\nnative of the Little People of Mars, here in the service of Tarrano. He\r\nstood stiff and respectful in the tunnel entrance.\r\n\r\nTarrano said crisply: \"Wolfgar, take these two men to the fourth tower.\r\nMake them comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nI met Georg's eyes. Leave Elza here alone with this man? Georg burst\r\nout: \"My sister goes with me!\"\r\n\r\n\"So?\" Tarrano's heavy brows went up inquiringly. A quizzical smile\r\nplucked at his lips. \"You need have no fear. The Lady Elza----\" He swung\r\nto her. \"Not--afraid, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--no,\" she stammered.\r\n\r\n\"She'll come with us,\" I declared; but the stoutness of my words could\r\nnot hide my fear. Tarrano was still smiling; but as I took a protecting\r\nstep toward Elza, his smile died.\r\n\r\n\"You--will go--with Wolfgar--both of you.\" That same slow finality. His\r\nface was impassive; but under his frowning bushy brows, his eyes\r\ntransfixed me. It was as though with his paralyzing ray he had rooted me\r\nto the spot. And Georg beside me. Yet he had not moved from his careless\r\nattitude of ease on the fountain-rim; the little conical golden weapon\r\ndangled untouched at his belt.\r\n\r\nElza was frightened. \"Jac! You must do what he says. I'm--not afraid.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Tarrano was smiling. \"No--of course not.\" His gaze went to Georg.\r\n\"You are her brother--your fear is very natural. So I give you my\r\nword--the honorable word of Tarrano--that she shall come to no harm.\"\r\n\r\nElza murmured: \"Go, Georg.\" Afraid for us, and doubtless she had good\r\nreason to be. It struck me then as queer that Tarrano should waste these\r\nwords with us; but I realized, as did Elza and Georg, that we were\r\ntreading very dangerous ground. Georg said, with a sudden dignity at\r\nwhich I marveled:\r\n\r\n\"Your word is quite enough.\" He gestured to me. With a last glance at\r\nElza, standing there frightened, but for our sakes striving not to show\r\nit, we let this Wolfgar lead us away.\r\n\r\nElza later told us what occurred. With her father, she had been twice to\r\nthe Venus Central State--the visit of two years ago Dr. Brende had\r\nmentioned to me, and a former one. It was upon this first trip Elza had\r\nmet Tarrano. He was an under-officer then, in the Army of the Central\r\nState--his name then was Taro. She--herself no more than a slip of a\r\ngirl at that time--remembered him as a queerly silent young\r\nman--insignificant in physique and manner. He had escorted her once to a\r\nVenus festival; in a strange, brooding, humble, yet dignified fashion,\r\nhe had spoken of love. She had laughed, and soon forgot the incident.\r\nBut Tarrano had not forgotten. The daughter of the great Dr. Brende had\r\nfired his youthful imagination. Who knows what dreams even then--born of\r\nthe genius as yet merely latent--were within him? He had never crossed\r\nElza's mind from that time, until today she saw and recognized him.\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone, still without moving from his seat, he signed her\r\nto come to him, to sit on the carpet of grass at his feet. She was\r\nfrightened, but she would not show it. He made no move to touch her; he\r\ngazed down to meet her upturned, fascinated stare, still with his\r\ngentle, whimsical smile.\r\n\r\n\"Queer that I should meet you again, Lady Elza. Yet, I must admit, it\r\ncomes not by chance, for I contrived it. My prisoner! Dr. Brende's\r\ndaughter, held captive by little Taro!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to amuse him, this whimsical reminiscence of those days when\r\nhe was struggling unknown. \"I want to confess something to you, Lady\r\nElza. You were so far above me then--daughter of the famous Dr. Brende.\r\nYet, as you remember, I aspired to you. And now--I have not changed. I\r\nnever change. I still--aspire to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe said it very softly, slowly. She flushed; but for that moment fear of\r\nhim dropped from her.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"I--I thank you for such a compliment----\"\r\n\r\n\"A compliment? Yes, I suppose it is that now. You wondered, didn't you,\r\nwhy I was so lenient with your brother and that Jac Hallen when they\r\nwould have refused me obedience? That is not my way--to be lenient.\" He\r\nsaid it with a sudden snap of crispness, but his eyes were twinkling.\r\n\"It was because of you, Lady Elza.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me?\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"You--of course. Because I--want you to like me.\" His fingers\r\ninvoluntarily touched a stray lock of her hair as she sat there at his\r\nfeet, but when she moved her head away he withdrew his hand. His slow\r\nvoice went on:\r\n\r\n\"Back in those other days, Lady Elza, the little Taro had strange\r\ndreams. A power within him--he could feel it--here----\" His gaze was far\r\naway; his fist struck his breast. \"He could feel it--the urge to fulfill\r\nhis destiny--feel it within him, and no one else knew it was there.\r\n\r\n\"Then--you came. A shy, rather pretty little girl, he realizes now, is\r\nall you were. But then--you seemed a goddess. A new dream arose--a dream\r\nof you ... I frighten you, child?\" His tone was contrite. \"I do not mean\r\nto do that. I am too hasty. Queer, isn't it, that I can make men,\r\nnations, worlds, obey me--but I have to bide my time with a fragile\r\nlittle woman?\"\r\n\r\nHis mood changed; he stirred. \"I could bend you to my will--break\r\nyou--like that!\" His lean fingers snapped. Then his hand dropped, and\r\nagain he relaxed. \"But of what use?... Your respect? I have it now.\r\nRespect and fear come to me from everyone. It is something more than\r\nthat I want from you.\"\r\n\r\nShe would have spoken, but his gesture stopped her. \"Queer that I should\r\nwant it? Yes, I think perhaps it is. The little Taro was very queer,\r\nperhaps very impressionable. He knew he had nations and worlds to\r\nconquer--a destiny to fulfill. Not alone because of you, little Elza. I\r\nwould not make you think that. But for you to share. The great Tarrano,\r\nmaster of the universe, and his Lady Elza! Worlds for you to toy with,\r\nlike gems on a thread adorning your white throat----\"\r\n\r\nHe must have swayed her, the sheer power of him. Impulsively she touched\r\nhis knee. \"I am not worth----\"\r\n\r\nHis face clouded with a frown. \"I would not try to buy your love----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"No, I did not mean----\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not try to buy you. I want to share with you--these worlds--as\r\nyour due. To make myself master of everything, so that you will look to\r\nme and say, 'He is the greatest of all men--I love him'.... Soon I will\r\nbe the greatest of all men throughout the ages. And very gentle always,\r\nwith you, Lady Elza----\"\r\n\r\nA buzz came from the disc at his belt. He answered the call--listened to\r\na voice.\r\n\r\n\"So? Bring him here.\" He disconnected. \"...very gentle with you, my\r\nElza----\"\r\n\r\nHis voice drifted away. He seemed waiting; and Elza, her head whirling\r\nwith the confusion of it all, sat silent. A moment; then Argo appeared,\r\ndriving a half-nude man before him. A native official of Venia, stripped\r\nof his uniform. Argo flung him down in the garden path, where he\r\ncowered, his face ashen, his eyes wild, lips mumbling with terror.\r\n\r\nTarrano barely moved. \"So? You tell me he was asleep at the mirrors,\r\nArgo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, I could not help it! Since first you made your move in Greater\r\nNew York at Park Sixty, I have sat there. Two nights and a day----\"\r\n\r\n\"And you fell asleep without asking for a relief?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, I----\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I did not realize I was sleeping----\"\r\n\r\nA gesture to Argo, and the man was flung closer to Tarrano's feet. Elza\r\nshrank away.\r\n\r\n\"Left a mirror unattended. So?... The wire, Argo.\" He took the length\r\nof wire, gleaming white-hot, as the leering, gloating Argo turned the\r\ncurrent into it--Tarrano took it, lashed it upon the poor wretch's naked\r\nback and legs. Welts arose, and the stench of burning flesh. A measured\r\nscore of the passionless strokes made him writhe and scream in agony.\r\n\r\nIt turned Elza sick and faint. Shuddering, she crouched there, hiding\r\nher face until the punishment was over and the half-unconscious culprit\r\nwas carried away.\r\n\r\n\"Very gentle with you, my Elza....\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up to find Tarrano smiling at her; looked up and stared, and\r\nwondered what might be her fate with such a man as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_Prisoners_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the garden where Tarrano was talking with Elza, the Mars man\r\nWolfgar led us to the tower in which we were to be imprisoned. Quite\r\nevidently it had been placed in readiness for us. A tower of several\r\nrooms, comfortably equipped. As we crossed the lower bridge and reached\r\nthe main doorway, Wolfgar unsealed a black fuse-box which stood there,\r\nand pulled the relief-switch. The current, barring passage through every\r\ndoor and window of the tower, was thrown off. We entered. My mind was\r\nalert. This man of the Little People could not again turn on that\r\ncurrent without going outside. Once it was on, like an invisible wall it\r\nwould prevent our escape. But now--could not Georg and I with our\r\nsuperior strength overpower this smaller man?\r\n\r\nI caught Georg's glance as our captor led us into the lower room--an\r\napartment cut into the half-segment of a circle. Georg, at my elbow,\r\nwhispered: \"No use! Where could we go? Could not get out of the\r\ncity----\"\r\n\r\nThe hearing of the Little People is sharp. Wolfgar turned his head and\r\nsmiled. \"You will be quite secure here--do not think of escape.\" His\r\nbronzed fingers toyed with a cone at his belt. \"Do not think of it.\"\r\n\r\nSoon he left us, with the parting words: \"You may use the upper circle\r\nof balcony. The current rises only from its rail.\" He smiled and left\r\nus. A pleasant smile; I felt myself liking this jailer of ours.\r\n\r\nWe took a turn of the tower. There were three bedrooms; a cookery, with\r\nfood and equipment wherein evidently it was intended that Elza could\r\nprepare our meals; and two bath-apartments, one of them fairly\r\nluxurious, with a pool almost large enough for a little swimming; tubes\r\nof scent for the water and the usual temperature rods.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I remarked. \"Obviously we are to be comfortable.\" I was trying\r\nto be cheerful, but my heart was heavy with foreboding nevertheless.\r\n\"How long do you suppose they'll keep us here, Georg? And what----\"\r\n\r\nHis impatient gesture stopped me. His mind was on Elza--alone down there\r\nin the garden with Tarrano--as was mine, though I had not wanted to\r\nspeak of her.\r\n\r\nThere was an instrument room, up the circular incline in the peak of the\r\ntower! We heard the hum of it; and when we went up there, the first\r\nthing we saw was a mirror tuned in readiness for us to view the garden\r\nwe had just left. This strange Tarrano, giving Georg the visible proof\r\nthat he would keep his word and not harm Elza. We could see in this\r\nmirror the image of the scene down there--Elza and Tarrano talking. But\r\ncould not hear the words--those were denied us. We saw the culprit\r\nbrought in; the punishment with the white-hot wire-lash, and a few\r\nmoments later Elza was with us.\r\n\r\nDuring the hours which followed, we made no attempt to escape. Such an\r\neffort would have been absurd. The current controls were outside, beyond\r\nour reach. Visibly, we were free, with open, unbarred arches and\r\ncasements. But to pass through one of them, the barring current struck\r\nyou like a wall, with darting sparks when it was touched. As Wolfgar had\r\nsaid, we had access to the upper balcony; the waist-high rail there,\r\nwith its needle-points of electrodes, sent up a visible stream of the\r\nNth Electrons--a dull glow by daylight; at night a riot of colors and\r\nsnapping sparks.\r\n\r\nThrough this barrage an inner vista of the city was visible; towers,\r\narcades, landing-stages and spider bridges a hundred feet or so above\r\nus; the lower levels beneath, and through a canyon of walls we could\r\njust make out a corner of the ground-plaza, with its trees and beds of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nA queerly flat little city--tropical with banana trees and vivid foliage\r\nin every corner plot of the viaducts. At night it was beautiful with its\r\nromantic spreading lights of soft rose and violet tubes, and there was a\r\nfair patch of open sky above us--a deep purple at night, star-strewn.\r\n\r\nUnder other circumstances our imprisonment would not have been irksome.\r\nBut these hours, most critical of any in the history of the nations of\r\nEarth, Venus and Mars, unfolded their momentous events while we were\r\nforced there to helpless idleness. All sending apparatus of our\r\ninstrument room was permanently disconnected. But the news came in to us\r\nfrom a hundred sources--rolled out for us in the announcer's droning\r\nwords; printed for permanent record upon the tapes and visible images of\r\nit all constantly were flashing upon the mirrors.\r\n\r\nWe spent hours in that instrument room--one or the other of us was\r\nalmost always there. Save that we were ourselves isolated from\r\ncommunication, we were in touch with everything. A whim of this Tarrano;\r\nperhaps a strain of vanity that Elza should see and hear of these\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nSo much had occurred already during those hours of our trip over the\r\nPolar ocean and back that we scarce could fathom it. But gradually we\r\npieced it together. Underlying it all, Tarrano's dream of universal\r\nconquest was plain. In the Venus Cold Country he had started his\r\nwide-flung plans. Years of planning, with plans maturing slowly,\r\nsecretly, and bursting now like a spreading ray-bomb upon the three\r\nworlds at once.\r\n\r\nIn Venus, the Cold Country had conquered its governing Central State.\r\nTarrano's army there was in full control. The helio station in the Great\r\nCity was now reinstated. The Tarrano officials had already set up their\r\nnew government. With notification to the Earth and Mars that they\r\ndemanded recognition, they were sending the usual routine helio\r\ndispatches and reports, quite as though nothing had occurred. The mails\r\nwould proceed as before, they announced; the one due to leave this\r\nafternoon for the Earth was off on time.\r\n\r\nIt was all very clever propaganda for our Earth public consumption.\r\nTarrano--who was visiting our Earth at present, they said--had been\r\nchosen Master of Venus. His government desired Earth's official\r\nrecognition, and asked for our proclamation of friendliness in answer to\r\ntheir own. The present Ambassadors of the Venus Central State to the\r\nEarth--there were three of them, one each in Great London, Tokyohama and\r\nMombozo--this new government requested that we send them back to the\r\nGreat City as prisoners of the Tarrano forces. Other Ambassadors,\r\nrepresenting the new government, would be sent to the Earth.\r\n\r\nAll this occurred during the first few hours of our imprisonment in the\r\ntower. And during the day previous, at 7 P.M. this night--70° West\r\nMeridian Time--the governments of our Earth met in Triple Conference in\r\nGreat London. Three rulers pro tem--White, Yellow and Black--to replace\r\nthe three who had been assassinated. The responsibility for the\r\nassassinations was placed by the Council upon Tarrano. But this--from\r\nhis headquarters here in Venia--he blandly refused to accept, denying\r\nall knowledge of the murders. Venia was the principal Venus immigrant\r\ncolony of Earth's Western Hemisphere. It had already been closed by our\r\nEarth Council; its inhabitants interned as possible alien enemies,\r\npending diplomatic developments. This was the meaning of that line of\r\nofficial vessels lying there to the north on guard. No one could leave\r\nVenia, and for a day Venus refugees had been ordered into it from\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nAt 8:40 this evening came from Great London our ultimatum to Tarrano. A\r\nduplicate of it went to the Great City of Venus via the Hawaiian\r\nStation. The Earth would not recognize the Tarrano government of Venus.\r\nWe would hold to our treaty of friendship with the Central State. We\r\nwould remain neutral for a time. But Tarrano himself we declared an\r\noutlaw. His presence was required in Washington to stand trial for the\r\nassassinations, and the delivery in Washington of Dr. Brende's notes and\r\nmodel was demanded.\r\n\r\nThe ultimatum carried a day of grace; the alternate was a declaration of\r\nwar by the Earth, and our immediate attack upon Venia. It was the same\r\nproposition which our War Director had previously made unofficially to\r\nTarrano while he was there in the garden with Elza and which Tarrano so\r\nsummarily had rejected.\r\n\r\nThe ultimatum came to us in the tower as we sat listening to the\r\nannouncer's measured tones. Elza exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"But why do they wait? Father's model must be here. Tarrano, the leader\r\nof all this--is here. Within the hour those vessels of war could sweep\r\nin here--capture Tarrano--recover father's model----\"\r\n\r\nGeorg interrupted quietly: \"No one knows if the model is here. That\r\nother car from the laboratory--we don't know where it went. The\r\nplundered laboratory has been found, of course. No station up there is\r\nnear enough to have eavesdropped upon our capture, but the whole thing\r\nmust have come out by now. But that aero with the model may have met an\r\ninter-planetary vessel--the model may be on the way to Venus by now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Georg,\" I exclaimed, \"do _you_ know the workings of that model? Could\r\nyou build another without the notes?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded solemnly. \"Yes. And they know that, in Washington. I could\r\nbuild another. But they know by now, that I, too, am in Tarrano's\r\nhands----\"\r\n\r\n\"And he will kill you, of course, to destroy that knowledge and keep the\r\nsecret for himself----\" I did not say it aloud, for Elza's sake; but I\r\nthought it, and I realized that Georg was thinking it also.\r\n\r\nDr. Brende's secret of longevity was the crux of all this turmoil--the\r\nlever by which Tarrano was raising himself. Scores of facts amid the\r\ntumultuous news of these hours showed us that. For months, throughout\r\nVenus, Tarrano had spread the insidious propaganda that he alone had the\r\nsecret of immortality--that when he was made ruler, he would use it for\r\nthe benefit of his followers.\r\n\r\nConverts to Tarrano's cause were everywhere. In the Central State many\r\nwelcomed the coming of his army. And now from the Great City his\r\npropaganda was being sent to the Earth. Murmurs from our own Earth\r\npublic were beginning to be heard. The ignorant lower classes seemed\r\nready to swallow anything. A new beneficent ruler who guaranteed\r\neverlasting life! Throughout the ages people have flocked to that same\r\nstandard!\r\n\r\nIn Mars, much the same was transpiring. At almost her closest point to\r\nthe Earth these days, Red Mars sent us constant helios from the midnight\r\nsky. The Little People had appointed a new ruler to take the place of\r\nhim who had been assassinated. The Council there put the assassination\r\nto unknown causes. Tarrano was held blameless. The Little People\r\ndeclared themselves neutral. But they gave prompt official recognition\r\nto the Tarrano government of Venus. And everywhere throughout Mars the\r\npublic was stirred by the thought of everlasting life.\r\n\r\n\"Fools!\" muttered Georg. \"That Little People government--they'll have a\r\nrevolution of their own to fight at this rate. Can't you see what\r\nTarrano is doing? Working everywhere with propaganda--working on the\r\npublic--the gullible public ready always to swallow anything----\"\r\n\r\nOn Earth, lay the crisis. Our own governments only had taken a firm\r\nstand. What could Tarrano do with this ultimatum? Either he must yield\r\nhimself and the Brende secret, or a war in which he would be immediately\r\noverwhelmed here in Venia would follow.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly ten o'clock that first night. Elza had gone to the\r\nbalcony. We heard her call us softly, but with obvious tenseness. Out\r\nthere we found her pointing excitedly. A few hundred feet away and\r\nsomewhat below us was a tower similar to our own. In one of its oblong\r\ncasements a glow of rose-light showed. And within the glow was the\r\nfull-length figure of a girl. We could see her plainly, though a small\r\nimage at that distance with the naked eye, and our personal vision\r\ninstruments had been taken from us. A slender, imperial figure--a young\r\ngirl seemingly about Elza's age. Dressed in a shimmering blue kirtle,\r\nshort after the Venus fashion, with long grey stockings beneath. A girl\r\nwith flowing waves of pure white hair to her waist--a girl of the Venus\r\nCentral State. She seemed, like ourselves, a prisoner. An aura or\r\nbarrage was around her tower. She stood there, back in the tower room,\r\nfull in the rose-light as though surreptitiously trying to attract our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAs we gathered on our balcony, behind the glow of our own barrage, she\r\ngestured to us vehemently. And then, with one white arm, she began to\r\nsemaphore. One arm, and then with both. Georg and I recognized it--the\r\nSecondary Code of the Anglo-Saxon Army. We murmured the letters aloud as\r\nshe gave them:\r\n\r\n\"_I am----_\" Abruptly she stopped. A violent gesture, and she\r\ndisappeared; her rose-glow went out; her tower casement was dark. On a\r\nlower spider bridge Tarrano had appeared. He was crossing it on foot\r\ntoward our tower, his small erect form advancing hastelessly, with the\r\nfigure of Argo behind him.\r\n\r\nHe reached our lower entrance, cut off the barrage there, and entered.\r\nArgo replaced the barrage, lingered an instant, gazing upward at us with\r\nhis habitual leer. Then he retraced his steps across the bridge and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nA moment more, and in our lounging apartment Tarrano faced us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_Unknown Friend_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sit down.\" Tarrano motioned us to feather hassocks and stretched\r\nhimself indolently upon our pillowed divan. With an elbow and hand\r\nsupporting his head he regarded us with his sombre black eyes, his face\r\nimpassive, an inscrutable smile playing about his thin lips.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to speak with you three. The Lady Elza----\" His glance went to\r\nher briefly, then to Georg. \"She has told you, perhaps, what I had to\r\nsay to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Georg shortly.\r\n\r\nElza had indeed told us. And with sinking heart I had listened, for it\r\ndid not seem to me that any maiden could resist so dominant a man as\r\nthis. But I had made no comment, nor had Georg. Elza had seemed\r\nunwilling to discuss it, had flushed when her brother's eyes had keenly\r\nsearched her face.\r\n\r\nAnd she flushed now, but Tarrano dismissed the subject with a gesture.\r\n\"That--is between her and me.... You have been following the general\r\nnews, I assume? I provided you with it.\" He rolled a little cylinder of\r\nthe arrant-leaf, and lighted it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Georg.\r\n\r\nGeorg was waiting for our captor to lay his cards before us. Tarrano\r\nknew it; his smile broadened. \"I shall not mince words, Georg Brende.\r\nBetween men, that is not necessary. And we are isolated here--no one\r\nbeyond Venia can listen. As you know, I am already Master of Venus. In\r\nMars--that will shortly come. They will hand themselves over to me--or I\r\nshall conquer them.\" He shrugged. \"It is quite immaterial.\" He added\r\ncontemptuously: \"People are fools--almost everyone--it is no great feat\r\nto dominate them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll find our Earth leaders are not fools,\" Georg said quietly.\r\n\r\nTarrano's heavy brows went up. \"So?\" He chuckled. \"That remains to be\r\nseen. Well, you heard the ultimatum they sent me? What do you think of\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you'd best obey it,\" I burst out impulsively.\r\n\r\n\"I was not speaking to you.\" He did not change the level intonation of\r\nhis voice, nor even look my way. \"You are to die tomorrow, Jac\r\nHallen----\"\r\n\r\nElza gave a low cry; instantly his gaze swung to her. \"So? That strikes\r\nat _you_, Lady Elza?\"\r\n\r\nShe flushed even deeper than before, and the flush, with her instinctive\r\nlook to me that accompanied it, made my heart leap. Tarrano's face had\r\ndarkened. \"You would not have me put him to death, Lady Elza?\"\r\n\r\nShe was struggling to guard from him her emotions; struggling to match\r\nher woman's wit against him.\r\n\r\n\"I--why no,\" she stammered.\r\n\r\n\"No? Because he is--your friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I--I would not let you do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not let me?\" Incredulous amusement swept over his face.\r\n\r\n\"No. I would not--let you do that.\" Her gaze now held level with his. A\r\nstrength came to her voice. Georg and I watched her--and watched\r\nTarrano--fascinated. She repeated once more: \"No. I would not let you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could you stop me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would--tell you not to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So?\" Admiration leaped into his eyes to mingle with the amusement\r\nthere. \"You would tell me not to do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" She did not flinch before him.\r\n\r\n\"And you think then--I would spare him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I know you would.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because--if you did a thing like that--I should--hate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Hate you--always.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned suddenly away from her, sitting up with a snap of alertness.\r\n\"Enough of this.\" Did he realize he was defeated in this passage with a\r\ngirl? Was he trying to cover from us the knowledge of his defeat? And\r\nthen again the bigness of him made itself manifest. He acknowledged\r\nsoberly:\r\n\r\n\"You have bested me, Lady Elza. And you've made me realize that\r\nI--Tarrano--have almost lowered myself to admit this Jac Hallen my\r\nrival.\" He laughed harshly. \"Not so! A rival? Pah! He shall live if you\r\nwish it--live close by you and me--as an insect might live on a twig by\r\nthe rim of the eagle's nest.... Enough!... I was asking you, Georg\r\nBrende, of this ultimatum. Should I yield to it?\" He had suppressed his\r\nother emotions; he was amusing himself with us again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Georg.\r\n\r\n\"But I have already refused--today in the garden. Would you have me\r\nchange? I am not one lightly to change a decision already reached.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps. Perhaps not. Of one thing I am sure. I cannot let them declare\r\nwar against me just now. I have no defense, here in Venia. Scarce the\r\narmament for my handful of men. Your vessels of war would sweep down\r\nhere and overpower me in a breath--trap me here helpless----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Georg.\r\n\r\n\"And so I must not let them do that. They want me to come to Washington\r\nwith the Brende model--deliver it over to them. Yet--that does not\r\nappeal to me. Tomorrow I shall have to bargain with them further. I\r\ncould not deliver to them the Brende model.\" He was chuckling at his own\r\nphrasing. \"No--no, I could not do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" demanded Georg. \"Isn't the model here?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is--where it is,\" said Tarrano. He became more serious. \"You,\r\nGeorg--you could build one of those models?\"\r\n\r\nGeorg did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"You could, of course,\" Tarrano insisted. \"My spy, Ahla--you remember\r\nher, the Lady Elza's maid for so long? She is here in Venia; she tells\r\nme of your knowledge and skill with your father's apparatus. So you see,\r\nI realize I have two to guard--the model itself, and you, who know its\r\nsecret.\"\r\n\r\nHe now became more openly alert and earnest than I had ever seen him.\r\nThe light from the tube along the side wall edged his lean, serious face\r\nwith its silver glow. \"I've a proposition for you, Georg Brende. Between\r\nmen, such things can be put bruskly. Your sister--her personal decision\r\nwill take time. I would not force it. But meanwhile--I do not like to\r\nhold you and her as captives.\"\r\n\r\nThe shadow of a smile crossed Georg's face. \"We shall be glad to have\r\nyou set us free.\"\r\n\r\nTarrano remained grave. \"You are a humorist. And a clever young fellow,\r\nGeorg Brende. You--as Elza's brother--and as your father's son with your\r\nmedical knowledge--you can be of great use to me. Suppose I offer you a\r\nplace by my side always? To share with me--and with the Lady Elza--these\r\nconquests.... Wait! It is not the part of wisdom to decide until you\r\nhave all the facts. I shall confide in you one of my plans. The publics\r\nof Venus, Mars and the Earth--they think this everlasting life, as they\r\ncall it, is to be shared with them.\"\r\n\r\nHis chuckle was the rasp of a file on a block of adamant. \"Shared\r\nwith them! That is the bait I dangle before their noses. In reality,\r\nI shall share it only with the Lady Elza. And with you--her brother,\r\nand the mate you some day will take for yourself. Indeed, I have\r\na maiden already at hand, picked out for you.... But that can come\r\nlater.... Everlasting life? Nonsense! Your father's discovery cannot\r\nconfer that. But we shall live two centuries or more. Four of us. To\r\nsee the generations come and go--frail mortals, while we live on to\r\nconquer and to rule the worlds.... Come, what do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say no.\"\r\n\r\nTarrano showed no emotion, save perhaps a flicker of admiration. \"You\r\nare decisive. You have many good qualities, Georg Brende. I wonder if\r\nyou have any good reasons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you are an enemy of my world,\" Georg declared, with more heat\r\nthan he had yet displayed.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Patriotism! A good lure for the ignorant masses, that thing they\r\ncall patriotism. For rulers, a good mask with which to hide their\r\nunscrupulous schemes. That's all it is, Georg Brende. Cannot you give me\r\na better reason? You think perhaps I am not sincere? You think I would\r\nnot share longevity with you--that I would play you false?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Georg declared. \"But my father's work was for the people. I'm not\r\ntalking patriotism--only humanitarianism. The strife, suffering in our\r\nworlds--you would avoid it yourself--and gloat while others bore it.\r\nYou----\"\r\n\r\n\"Youth!\" Tarrano interrupted. \"Altruism! It is very pretty in\r\ntheory--but quite nonsensical. Man lifts himself--the individual must\r\nlook out for himself--not for others. Each man to his destiny--and the\r\nweak go down and the strong go up. It is the way of all life--animal and\r\nhuman. It always has been--and it always will be. The way of the\r\nuniverse. You are very young, Georg Brende.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Georg said, and fell silent.\r\n\r\nTarrano abruptly rose to his feet. \"Calm thought is better than\r\nargument. You have imagination--you can picture what I offer. Think it\r\nover. And if youth is your trouble----\" His eyes were twinkling. \"I\r\nshall have to wait until you grow up. We have a long road to\r\ntravel--empires cannot be built in a day.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused before Elza with a grave, dignified bow. \"Goodnight, Lady\r\nElza.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodnight,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe left us. We stood listening to his footsteps as he quietly descended\r\nthe tower incline. At his summons, the barrage was lifted. He went out.\r\nFrom the balcony we saw him cross the spider bridge, with Argo at his\r\nheels. As they vanished into the yawning mouth of an arcade beyond the\r\nbridge, again came that rose-glow in the other tower. We saw again the\r\ngirl with flowing white hair standing there. And now she was waving us\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"She wants us inside, where we can't be seen,\" Georg murmured. We drew\r\nback into the room, standing where we still could see the girl. I\r\nwondered then--and we had discussed it several times these last\r\nhours--if the interior of our tower were under observation by some\r\ndistant guard. We felt that probably it was, visibly and audibly; and we\r\nhad been very careful of what we said aloud.\r\n\r\nBut now, if we were watched, we could not help it; we would have to take\r\nthe chance. The figure of the girl showed plainly down there through the\r\nother casement. And again, with slow-moving white arms she began to\r\nsemaphore. A queer application of the Secondary Code, which always is\r\nused officially with coral-light beams over considerable distances. But\r\nit sufficed in this emergency. Slowly she spelled out the letters,\r\nwords, phrases.\r\n\r\n_\"I am Princess Maida----\"_\r\n\r\nGeorg whispered to us: \"Hereditary ruler of the Central State----\"\r\n\r\nI nodded. \"Watch, Georg----\"\r\n\r\n_\"Prisoner----\"_ came next: _\"Like yourselves, and we must escape.\"_\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, letting her arms drop to her sides, shaking the\r\nglorious waves of her white hair with a toss of her head. Then, at a\r\ngesture from Georg that he understood, she began again:\r\n\r\n_\"Escape tonight----\"_\r\n\r\nI half expected that any moment Tarrano or one of his men would burst in\r\nto stop this. But the signals continued.\r\n\r\n_\"I am sending you a friend--tonight--soon--he will come to you. With\r\nplans for our escape. A good friend----\"_\r\n\r\nHer tower abruptly went dark. Cautiously I gazed down from our balcony.\r\nArgo had appeared on the spider bridge; he was pacing back and forth.\r\nDid he suspect anything? We could not tell, but it seemed not. It was\r\nthe midnight hour; a brilliant white flash swept the city to mark it.\r\n\r\nIn a low corner of the balcony, behind the glow of our barrage, we\r\ncrouched together, whispering excitedly. But cautiously, for we\r\nknew that the microphonic ears of a jailor might be upon us. The\r\nPrincess Maida--here in Tarrano's hands! She was sending us a\r\nfriend--tonight--soon; a friend who would help us all to escape.\r\n\r\n\"By the code!\" Georg exclaimed. \"If we could get to Washington--if I\r\ncould be there now in this crisis--with my knowledge of the Brende\r\nlight----\"\r\n\r\nFar above our personal safety, our lives, lay the importance of Georg's\r\nknowledge. With the Brende secret--through him--in the hands of the\r\nEarth Council, Tarrano's greatest lever to power would be broken. Our\r\nEarth public would sway back to patriotic loyalty. The Little People of\r\nMars unquestionably would remain friendly with us, with the Brende light\r\nto be developed on Earth and shared with them. They would see Tarrano\r\nperhaps, for what he was--a dangerous, unscrupulous enemy.... If only\r\nGeorg could escape....\r\n\r\nAn hour went by with murmured thoughts like these. A friend coming to\r\nhelp us? How could he reach us? And how help us to escape?\r\n\r\nWe crouched there, waiting. Argo--obviously on night guard--still paced\r\nthe bridge. The city was comparatively dark and silent; yet even so,\r\nthere seemed more activity than we felt was normal. Occasional beams\r\nflashed across the narrow segment of our sky. The crescent terraces,\r\nvisible through a shallow canyon of buildings to the left, were a blaze\r\nof colored lights with the dark figures of people thronging them. The\r\nmingled hum of instruments was in the night air; sometimes the snap of\r\nan aerial; and the steady, clicking whir of the night escalators on the\r\ncity street levels and inclines.\r\n\r\nIt seemed hours that we waited. The green flash of the second hour past\r\nmidnight bathed the city in its split-second lurid glare. Elza had\r\nfallen asleep, beside us on the feathered hassock of our balcony corner.\r\nBut Georg and I were fully alert--waiting for this unknown friend. Georg\r\nhad smoked innumerable arrant-leaf cylinders. Through the insulated\r\ntube, from a public cookery occasional hot dishes were passing our\r\ndining room for us to take if we wished. But we had touched none of\r\nthem. From the food stock on hand, Elza had cooked our two simple meals.\r\nBut now, with Elza asleep, Georg left me and returned in a moment with\r\nsteaming cups of taro. We drank it silently, still waiting. Argo still\r\npaced the bridge on guard. Presently we saw the figure of Wolfgar join\r\nhim. The two spoke together a moment; then Argo disappeared; Wolfgar\r\npaced back and forth on guard in his place.\r\n\r\nAt 2:30 the Inter-Allied announcer--for half an hour past quite\r\nsilent--brought us to our feet, his monotone droning from the disc in\r\nour instrument room:\r\n\r\n_\"Greater New York, Inter-Allied Unofficial 2:27 A. M. Tarrano replies\r\nto the Earth Council Ultimatum....\"_\r\n\r\nOur start woke up Elza. Together we rushed into the instrument room.\r\n\r\n_\"With many hours yet before the Earth Council Ultimatum expires, it is\r\nunofficially reported that Tarrano has sent his note in answer. Its\r\ntext, we are reliably informed, is now in the hands of our Governments\r\nat Great London, Greater New York, Tokyohama and Mombozo. Helios of it\r\nalso have been sent to Tarrano's own government of Venus and to the\r\nLittle People of Mars. We have as yet no further details....\"_\r\n\r\nA buzz came as he ended, with only the click of the tape continuing as\r\nit printed his words. A period of silence, then again his voice:\r\n\r\n_\"Official 2:32 A. M. Inter-Allied News: Tarrano rejects Ultimatum. His\r\nnote to Earth Council complete defiance. Official text follows....\"_\r\n\r\nWe listened, dumb with amazement and awe. Tarrano's note was indeed,\r\ncomplete defiance. He would not yield up the Brende light. Nor would he\r\ndeliver himself in Washington for trial. In the suave, courteous\r\nlanguage of diplomacy, he deplored the unreasonable attitude of the\r\nEarth leaders. Ironically, he suggested that they declare war. He would\r\nbe overwhelmed in Venia, of course. He had no means of defending himself\r\nagainst their aggression. But at the first flash of hostile rays, the\r\nBrende model would be destroyed forever. And Georg Brende--the only\r\nliving person who had the knowledge to replace the model--would die\r\ninstantly. The Brende secret would be lost irrevocably. It was\r\nunfortunate that humanity on Earth, Venus and Mars, should be denied\r\ntheir chance for immortality. Unfortunate that the Earth leaders were so\r\nheadstrong. They were enemies, in reality, of their own people--and\r\nenemies of the peoples of Venus and Mars. But if the Earth Council\r\nwished war with Tarrano--then war let it be.\r\n\r\n\"A bluff,\" I exclaimed. \"He would lose everything himself. It's\r\nsuicide--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not suicide,\" Georg said soberly. \"Propaganda. Can't you see it? He\r\nknows the Earth Council will make no move until the ultimatum time has\r\nexpired. Hours yet. And in those hours, he is working upon the publics\r\nof the three worlds.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcer was silent again. Below us, in our tower, we heard a\r\nfootstep. The barrage had been lifted to admit someone, then thrown on\r\nagain. Measured footsteps were coming up our incline. We stood\r\nmotionless, breathless. A moment; then into the room came Wolfgar. He\r\ndid not speak. Advancing close to us as we stood transfixed, he jerked\r\nan instrument from his belt. It whirred and hummed in his hand. The room\r\naround us went black--a barrage of blackness and silence, with ourselves\r\nand Wolfgar in a pale glow standing within it as in a cylinder. The\r\nisolation-barrage. I had never been within one before, though upon\r\ndrastic occasion they were in official use.\r\n\r\nWolfgar said swiftly: \"We cannot be seen or heard. I have been in charge\r\nof the mirror observing you--I have thrown it out of use. The Princess\r\nMaida--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are--the friend?\" Georg whispered tensely. Elza was trembling and I\r\nput my arm about her.\r\n\r\nWolfgar's face lightened with a brief smile; then went intensely\r\nserious. \"Yes. A spy, trusted by Tarrano for years--but my heart is with\r\nthe Princess Maida. We must escape--all of us--now, or it will be too\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, and a look of consternation came to him. The black\r\nsilence enveloping us had without warning begun to crackle. The metal\r\ncone in Wolfgar's hand glowed red with interference-heat--but he clung\r\nto it, though it burned him. Sparks were snapping in the blackness\r\naround us. Our isolation was dissolving. Someone--something--was\r\nbreaking it down, struggling to get at us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_Paralyzed!_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe isolation barrage which Wolfgar had flung around us was dissolving.\r\nSomeone--something--was in the room, breaking down the barrage,\r\nstruggling to get at us. We stood huddled together; Elza clinging to me,\r\nGeorg beside us, and Wolfgar, gripping the small cylinder which was\r\nglowing red in his hand from intense heat.\r\n\r\nGeorg muttered something; the snapping sparks of the barrage blurred his\r\nwords. But I heard Wolfgar say swiftly:\r\n\r\n\"We're trapped! _You_, of all of us--you Georg Brende, must escape.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of his words to Georg I did not catch. He was thrusting a\r\nweapon into Georg's hands; and giving hurried advice and explanations.\r\n\r\n\"Princess Maida ... she ... in that other tower ... you, so much more\r\nimportant than the rest of us....\" Phrases I heard; but only phrases,\r\nfor in those few seconds I stood dumbly confused, fascinated by watching\r\nthe blackness in which we had enveloped ourselves now breaking into\r\nlurid, angry sparks.\r\n\r\nA distant corner of the room became visible; outlines of the wall-beams;\r\nthe growing glare of a wall-light in a tube over there. And through the\r\nbrightening gloom--the figure of a lone man standing. Tarrano!\r\n\r\nI heard Georg mutter: \"Jac! Make a show of fight! Hold him! But\r\ncareful--careful of Elza!\"\r\n\r\nBehind me there came an electrical flash; the pungent smell of burning\r\ncloth. Georg was no longer beside us!\r\n\r\nElza was still clinging to me in fright. I shook her off. Wolfgar flung\r\nhis smoking, useless cylinder to the floor. The blackness at once sprang\r\ninto light; the sparks died. Tarrano was standing in the room, quietly,\r\nbefore us. Standing with a grim, cynical smile, regarding us.\r\n\r\nBut only for an instant did he stand quiet. Across the room, creeping\r\nfor the balcony doorway, I was aware of the figure of Georg. Tarrano saw\r\nhim also; and with a swift gesture snapped back to his belt the\r\ninterference cylinder with which he had uncovered us; then plucked at\r\nanother weapon, gripped it to turn it upon Georg.\r\n\r\nEverything was happening too swiftly for coherent thought. I leaped\r\ntoward Tarrano, with Wolfgar rushing beside me. Elza screamed. Tarrano's\r\nhand was leaving his belt. I reached him; flung out my fist for his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nBut in that instant the weapon in Tarrano's hand was brought upon me. My\r\nparalyzed muscles made my arm and fist go wide. My blow missed him; he\r\nstepped aside; and like a man drunk with baro-wine, I stumbled past him,\r\nhalted, swayed and struggled to keep my footing.\r\n\r\nWolfgar had felt it also; he was reeling near me, holding himself from\r\nfalling with difficulty. I was unarmed; but there were weapons hanging\r\nfrom Wolfgar's belt. His numbed fingers were groping for them. But the\r\neffort was too great. The blood, driven back from his arms, left them\r\npowerless; they fell dangling to his sides.\r\n\r\nA few seconds; but we had occupied Tarrano during them. Georg was\r\nthrough the balcony doorway and beyond our sight. Elza was standing\r\nmotionless, too frightened to move. I felt myself growing numb, weighted\r\nto the floor as though my feet had taken root. My arms were hanging like\r\nwood; fingers tingling, then growing cold, dead to sensation. And a\r\nnumbness creeping up my legs; and spreading inward from my arms and\r\nshoulders. In a few moments more, I knew the numbness would reach my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nTarrano had not moved, save that single step side-wise to avoid my\r\nonslaught. As I stood there now with my face like fire and my brain\r\nwhirling with the blood congested in it, I heard his quiet voice:\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear, Lady Elza. This Jac Hallen--as I promised you--is quite\r\nsafe with me.\"\r\n\r\nHis gesture waved her aside, that she should not come within those\r\ndeadly vibrations he was flinging at us. And I saw his other hand lift a\r\ntiny mouthpiece from his belt; heard his voice say into it: \"Argo? Argo!\r\nThat Georg Brende----\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped; a look of annoyance came over his face. Argo did not answer!\r\nDimly to my fading senses came the triumphant thought, the realization\r\nthat Argo outside, upon whom Tarrano depended to seize Georg--had\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nAction had come to Tarrano. He snapped off his weapon. Released from it,\r\nWolfgar and I wilted to the floor--lay inert. The returning blood in my\r\nlimbs made them prick as with a million needles. To my sight and\r\nhearing, the room was whirling and roaring. I felt Tarrano bending\r\nswiftly over me; felt the forcible insertion of a branched metal tube in\r\nmy nostrils; a hand over my mouth. I struggled to hold my\r\nbreath--failed. Then inhaled with a gasp, a pungent, sickening-sweet\r\ngas. Roaring, clanging gongs sounded in my ears--roaring and clattering\r\nlouder, then fading into silence. A wild, tumbling phantasmagoria of\r\ndreams. Then complete unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_Georg Escapes_\r\n\r\n\r\nI come now to recount events at which I was not present, and the details\r\nof which I did not learn until later. Fronted by Tarrano, in those few\r\nseconds of confusion, Georg made his decision to escape even at the cost\r\nof leaving Elza and me. He murmured his hurried good-bye. The moment had\r\narrived. He could see Tarrano dimly through the sparks. He leaped\r\nbackward, through that wall of electrical disturbance which surrounded\r\nus. The sparks tore at him; burned his clothing and flesh; the shock of\r\nit gripped his heart. But he went through; crept for the balcony. It was\r\ndark out there. He would have rushed for Tarrano instead of the balcony,\r\nbut as he came through the sparks he had seen that the barrier\r\nsurrounding our tower was momentarily lifted. Argo had cut it off to\r\nadmit Tarrano a few moments before. He had not yet replaced\r\nit--absorbed, doubtless, in watching in his finder what Tarrano was\r\ndoing with us. He must have seen Georg reach the balcony; and jumped\r\nthen to replace the barrier. But too late. Georg was over the balcony\r\nrail with a leap. The insulated tubes were there--upright gleaming tubes\r\nof metal extending downward to the platform below. Tubes smooth, and as\r\nthick as a woman's waist.\r\n\r\nGeorg slid down them. The barrage, above him on the balcony, had been\r\nreplaced. He saw below him the figure of Argo come running out. A weapon\r\nin each hand. The burning pencil-ray swung at Georg, but missed him as\r\nhe came down. Had it struck, it would have drilled him clean with its\r\ntiny hole of fire. Then Argo must have realized that Georg should be\r\ntaken alive. He ran forward, swung up at Georg the paralyzing vibrations\r\nwhich Tarrano at that instant was using upon Wolfgar and me.\r\n\r\nGeorg felt them. He was ten feet, perhaps, above the lower platform; and\r\nas he felt the numbness strike him, he lost his hold upon the tube-pipe.\r\nBut he had presence of mind enough to kick himself outward with a last\r\neffort. His body fell upon the onrushing Argo. They went down together.\r\n\r\nArgo lay inert. The impact had knocked him senseless, and had struck his\r\nweapon from his hand. Georg sat up, and for a moment chafed his\r\ntingling, prickling arms and legs. He was bruised and shaken by the\r\nfall, but uninjured.\r\n\r\nWithin our tower, Tarrano was still occupied with us. Georg leaped to\r\nhis feet. He left Argo lying there--ran over the spider-bridge; down a\r\nspiral metal stairway, across another bridge, and came upon the small\r\npark-like platform which stood at the bottom of the other tower. He had\r\npassed within sight of a few pedestrians. One of them shouted at him;\r\nanother had tried mildly to stop him. A crowd on a distant terrace saw\r\nhim. A few of their personal flashes were turned his way. Murmurs arose.\r\nSomeone at the head of one of the escalators, in a panic pulled an\r\nalarm-switch. It flared green into the sky, flashing its warning.\r\n\r\nThe interior-guards--seated at their instrument tables in the lower\r\nrooms of the official buildings--had seen Georg in their finders. The\r\nalarm was spreading. Lights were appearing everywhere.... The murmurs of\r\ngathering people ... excited crowds ... an absurd woman leaning down\r\nover a far-away parapet and screaming ... an ignorant, flustered\r\nstreet-guard on a nearby upper terrace swinging his pencil-ray down at\r\nGeorg.... Fortunately it fell short.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Georg stood there, with the gathering tumult around\r\nhim--stood there gazing up at that small tower. The tower wherein the\r\nPrincess Maida was confined. It was dark and silent. Black rectangles of\r\ndoors and casements, all open--but barred by the glow of the electrical\r\nbarrage surrounding it.\r\n\r\nGeorg jerked from his belt the cylinder Wolfgar had given him. Metallic.\r\nShort, squat and ugly, with a thick, insulated handle. He feared to use\r\nit. Yet Wolfgar had assured him the Princess Maida was prepared. He\r\nhesitated, with his finger upon the switch-button of the weapon. But he\r\nknew that in a moment he would be too late. A searchlight from an aerial\r\nmast high overhead swung down upon him, bathing him in its glare of\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nHis finger pressed the trigger. A soundless flash of purple enveloped\r\nthe tower. Sparks mounted into the air--a cloud of vivid electrical\r\nsparks; but mingled with them in a moment were sparks also of burning\r\nwood and fibre. Smoke began to roll upward; the purple flash was gone,\r\nand dull red took its place. The hum and angry buzz of outraged\r\nelectricity was stilled. Flames appeared at all the tower casements--red\r\nflames, then yellow with their greater heat.\r\n\r\nThe trim and interior of the tower was burning. The protons Georg had\r\nflung at it with his weapon had broken the electrical barrage. The\r\ninterference heat had burned out the connections and fired everything\r\ncombustible within the tower. A terrific heat. It began to melt and burn\r\nthe _blenite_.[10] The upper portion of the tower walls began to\r\ncrumble. Huge blocks of stone were shifting, tottering; and they began\r\nto fall through the glare of mounting flames and the thick black smoke.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: A cement or mortar used in stone constructions--evidently\r\npartially combustible.]\r\n\r\nGeorg had tossed away his now useless weapon--emptied of its charge. He\r\nwas crouching in the shadow of a parapet. The city was now in turmoil.\r\nAlarm lights everywhere. The shrilling of sirens; roaring of megaphoned\r\ncommands ... women screaming hysterically....\r\n\r\nA chaos, out of which, for a few moments, Georg knew no order could\r\ncome. But his heart was in his mouth. The Princess Maida, within that\r\nburning building....\r\n\r\nHe had located the tiny postern gate at the bottom of the tower where\r\nWolfgar had told him she would appear. The barrage was gone; and in a\r\nmoment she came--a white figure appearing there amid the smoke that was\r\nrolling out.\r\n\r\nHe rushed to her. A figure wholly encased in white _itan_[11] fabric\r\nwith head-mask, and tubes from its generator to supply her with air.\r\nWolfgar had smuggled the equipment in to her for just this emergency.\r\nShe stood awkwardly beside Georg--a grotesque figure hampered by the\r\nheavy costume. Its crescent panes of _itanoid_ begoggled her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: A universal insulating fabric, as rubber insulates\r\nelectricity and asbestos bars heat.]\r\n\r\nBehind him, Georg could hear people advancing. A guard picked them out\r\nwith a white flash. The mounting flames of the tower bathed everything\r\nin red. A block of stone fell near at hand, crashing through the\r\nmetallic platform upon which they were standing. Broken, it sagged\r\nbeneath their feet.\r\n\r\nGeorg tore at the girl's head-piece, lifted it off. Her face was pale,\r\nfrightened, yet she seemed calm. Her glorious white hair tumbled down in\r\nwaves over her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Wolfgar--he----\" She choked a little in the smoke that swirled around\r\nthem. Georg cut in: \"He sent me--Georg Brende. Don't talk now--get this\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled the heavy costume from her. She emerged from it--slim and\r\nbeautiful in the shimmering blue kirtle, with long grey stockings\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nA spider incline was nearby. But a dozen guards were coming up it at a\r\nrun. With the girl's hand in his, Georg turned the other way. People\r\nwere closing in all around them--an excited crowd held back by the heat\r\nof the burning tower, the smoke and the falling blocks of stone. Someone\r\nswung a pencil-ray wildly. It seared Georg like a branding-iron on the\r\nflesh of his arm as it swung past. He pulled Maida toward the head of an\r\nescalator a dozen feet away. Its steps were coming upward from the plaza\r\nat the ground level. Half way up, the first of an up-coming throng were\r\nmounting it.\r\n\r\nBut Georg again turned aside. He found Maida quick of wit to catch his\r\nplans; and agile of body to follow him. They climbed down the metal\r\nframe-work of the escalator sides; down under it to where the inverted\r\nsteps were passing downward on the endless belts. Maida slid into one of\r\nthem, with Georg after her, his arms holding her in place.\r\n\r\nThey huddled there. No one had seen them enter. Smoothly the escalator\r\ndrew them downward. Above them in a moment the tramp of feet sounded\r\nclose above their heads as the crowd rushed upward.\r\n\r\nThey approached the bottom, slid out upon a swinging bridge which\r\nchanced at the moment to be empty of people. Down it at a run; into the\r\npalm-lined plaza at the bottom of the city.\r\n\r\nDown here it was comparatively dim and silent. The alarm lights of the\r\nplaza section had not yet come on; the excitement was concentrated upon\r\nthe burning tower above. The crowd, rushing up there, left the plaza\r\nmomentarily deserted. Georg and Maida crossed it at a run, scurried like\r\nfrightened rabbits through a tunnel arcade, down a lower cross-street,\r\nand came at last unmolested to the outskirts of the city.\r\n\r\nThe buildings here were almost all at the ground level. Georg and Maida\r\nran onward, hardly noticed, for everyone was gazing upward at the\r\ndistant, burning tower. Georg was heading for where Wolfgar had an aero\r\nsecreted. A mile or more. They reached the spot--but the aero was not\r\nthere. They were in the open country now--Venia is small.\r\nPlantations--an agricultural region. Most of the houses were deserted,\r\nthe occupants having fled into the city as refugees when threats and\r\norders came from Washington the day before. Georg and Maida came upon a\r\nlittle conical house; it lay silent, heavy-shadowed in the starlight\r\nwith the glow of the city edging its side and circular roof. Beside it\r\nwas an incline with a helicopter standing up there on a private landing\r\nstage.... Georg and Maida rushed up the incline.\r\n\r\nA small helicopter; its dangling basket was barely large enough for\r\ntwo--a basket with a tiny safety 'plane fastened to its outrigger.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Georg and the girl had boarded the helicopter. She was\r\nsilent; she had hardly said a word throughout it all.... The helicopter\r\nmounted straight up; its whirling propellers above sent a rush of air\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\n\"These batteries,\" said Georg. \"The guards in Venia can't stop us. An\r\naero--even if we had it--I doubt if we could get power for it. They've\r\nshut off general power by now, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"Yes--no doubt.\"\r\n\r\nAs they mounted upward, the city dwindled beneath them--dwindled to an\r\narea of red and green and purple lights. It was silent up here in the\r\nstarlight; a calm, windless night--cloudless, save for a gray bank which\r\nobscured the moon.\r\n\r\nTen thousand feet up. Then fifteen. The city was a tiny patch of blended\r\ncolors. Light rockets occasionally mounted now. But their glare fell\r\nshort. Georg's mind was busy with his plans. Had the helicopter been\r\nseen? It seemed not. No rocket-light had reached it; and there was no\r\nsign of pursuit from below.\r\n\r\nMaida crouched beside him. He felt her hand timidly upon his arm; felt\r\nher shy, sidelong glance upon him. And suddenly he was conscious of her\r\nbeauty. His heart leaped, and as he turned to her, she smiled--a smile\r\nof eager trust which lighted her face like a torch of faith in the spire\r\nof a house of worship.\r\n\r\n\"You are planning?\" she said. \"You know what it is we must do?\"\r\n\r\nHe said: \"I think so. The _volan_[12] out there is large enough for two.\r\nYou'll trust yourself to it with me? You're not afraid, are you?\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: A small winged board without power, used for emergency\r\ndescents by volplaning down from disabled aeros.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" she said. \"What you say we must do, we will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must go higher, Maida. Then, you see....\"\r\n\r\nHe told her his plans. And mounting up there into the silent canopy of\r\nstars, his fingers wound themselves into the soft strands of her hair\r\nwhich lay upon him; and his heart beat fast with the nearness of\r\nher.... Told her his plans, and she acquiesced.\r\n\r\nTwenty thousand feet. The cold was upon them. Shivering himself, he\r\nwrapped her in a fur which the basket contained. At 25,000, they took to\r\nthe _vol plan_. It was a padded board a dozen feet long and half as\r\nwide. Released, it shot downward; a hundred feet or more, with the\r\nheavens whirling soundlessly. Then Georg got the wings open; the descent\r\nwas checked; the stars righted themselves above, and once again the\r\nearth was beneath.\r\n\r\nThey had strapped themselves to the board, and now Georg undid the\r\nthongs. Together they lay prone, side by side, with the narrow,\r\ndouble-banked wings beneath the line of their shoulders, and the\r\nrudder-tail behind them. Flexible 'planes and tail, responding to\r\nGeorg's grip on the controls.\r\n\r\nFluttering, uncertain at first, like a huge bird of quivering wings,\r\nthey began their incline descent. A spiral, then Georg opened it to a\r\nstraight glide northward--rushing downward and onward through the\r\nstarlight, in a wind of their own making which fluttered the light\r\nfabric of Maida's robe and tossed her waves of hair about her.\r\n\r\nA long, silent glide, with only the rush of wind. It seemed hours, while\r\nthe girl did not speak and Georg anxiously searched the sky ahead.\r\nUnderneath them, the dark forests were slipping past; but inexorably\r\ncoming upward. They were down to 5,000 feet; then Georg saw at last what\r\nhe had hoped, prayed for, but almost despaired of. A beam of light to\r\nthe northward--the spreading beam of an oncoming patrol. It was high\r\noverhead; but it came forward fast. A sweeping, keenly searching beam,\r\nand finally it struck them. Clung to them.\r\n\r\nAnd presently the big patrol vessel was almost above them. It hung\r\nthere, a dark winged shape dotted with colored lights. A signal flash--a\r\nsharp command to Georg, but, of course, he could not answer. Then the\r\nDirector's finder picked him out. The _volan_ was fluttering, spiralling\r\nslowly as Georg struggled to hold his place.\r\n\r\nAnd then the patrol launched its tender. It came darting down like a\r\nwasp. A moment more, and Georg and Maida were taken aboard it. The\r\n_volan_ fluttered to the forest unguided and was lost in the black\r\ntreetops, now no more than a thousand feet below.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by amazed officials, Maida and Georg entered the patrol\r\nvessel. Georg Brende, escaped safely from Tarrano! The Brende secret\r\nreleased from Tarrano's control! The Director flashed the news to\r\nWashington and to Great London. Orders came back. A score of other\r\nvessels of this Patrol-Division came dashing up--a convoy which soon was\r\nspeeding northward to Washington with its precious messenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_Recaptured_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Washington during those next few days, events of the Earth, Venus and\r\nMars swirled and raged around Georg as though he were engulfed in the\r\nIguazu or Niagara. Passive himself at first--a spectator merely; yet he\r\nwas the keystone of the Earth Council's strength. The Brende secret was\r\ndesired by the publics of all three worlds. Even greater than its real\r\nvalue as a medical discovery, it swayed the popular mind.\r\n\r\nTarrano possessed the Brende secret. The only model, and Dr. Brende's\r\nnotes were in his hands. Washington had ordered him to give them up, and\r\nhe had refused. But now the status was changed. Georg held the secret\r\nalso--and Georg was in Washington. It left the Earth Council free to\r\ndeal with Tarrano.\r\n\r\nDuring those days Georg was housed in official apartments, with Maida\r\nvery often near him. Inactive, they were much together, discussing their\r\nrespective worlds. The Princess Maida was hereditary ruler of the Venus\r\nCentral State--the only living heir to the throne. When Tarrano's forces\r\nthreatened revolution from the Cold Country she had been seized by\r\nspies, brought to Earth, to Tarrano in Venia, and imprisoned in the\r\ntower from which Georg had so lately rescued her. Wolfgar for years had\r\nbeen her friend and loyal retainer, though he had pretended service to\r\nTarrano.\r\n\r\nIn the Central State, Maida, too young to rule, had been represented by\r\na Council. The public loved her--but a majority of it had gone astray\r\nwhen she disappeared--lured by Tarrano's glowing promises.\r\n\r\nMaida told Georg all this with a sweet, gentle sadness that was\r\npathetic. And with an earnest, patriotic fervor--the love of her country\r\nand her people for whom she would give her life.\r\n\r\nShe added: \"If only I could get back there, Georg--I could make them\r\nrealize the right course. I could win them again. Tarrano will play them\r\nfalse--_you_ know it, and so do I.\"\r\n\r\nPathetic earnestness in this girl still no more than seventeen! And\r\nGeorg, sitting beside her, gazing into her solemn, beautiful face, felt\r\nthat indeed she could win them, with those limpid blue eyes and her\r\nwords which rang with sincerity and truth.\r\n\r\nThey sat generally in an unofficial instrument room adjoining the\r\ngovernment offices. A room high in a spire above the upper levels of the\r\ncity. And around them rolled the momentous events of which they were the\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nThe time limit of the Earth Council's ultimatum to Tarrano expired.\r\nAlready Tarrano had answered it with defiance. But on the stroke of its\r\nexpiration, came another note from him. Georg read it from the tape to\r\nMaida:\r\n\r\n_\"To the Earth Council from Tarrano, its loyal subject----\"_\r\n\r\nA grimly ironical note, yet so worded that the ignorant masses would not\r\nsee its irony. It stated that Tarrano could not comply with the demand\r\nthat he deliver himself and the Brende model to Washington because he\r\ndid not have the model. It was on its way to Venus. He now proposed to\r\nrecall it. He had already recalled it, in fact. He assured the Council\r\nthat it was now on its way back, direct to Washington. He had done this\r\nbecause he felt that the Earth leaders were making a mistake--a grave\r\nmistake in the interests of their own people. Georg Brende was in\r\nWashington--that was true. But Georg Brende was a silly, conceited young\r\nman, flattered by his prominence in the public eye, his head turned by\r\nhis own importance. Dr. Brende had been a genius. The son was a mere\r\nupstart, pretending to a scientific knowledge he did not have.\r\n\r\n\"Trickery!\" exclaimed Georg. \"But he knows the people may believe it.\r\nSome of them undoubtedly will.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you cannot thwart your public,\" Maida said. \"Even your Earth\r\nCouncil, secure in its power, cannot do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" Georg rejoined. He was indignant, as well he might have been.\r\n\"Tarrano is trying to avoid being attacked. Time--any delay--is what he\r\nwants.\"\r\n\r\nThe note went on. Tarrano--seeking only the welfare of the people--could\r\nnot stand by and see the Earth Council wreck its public. Tarrano had\r\nreconsidered his former note. The Brende model was vital, and since the\r\nEarth Council demanded the model (for the benefit of its people) the\r\npeople should have it. In a few days it would be in Washington. Tarrano\r\nhimself would not come to Washington. His doing that could not help the\r\npublic welfare, and he was but human. The Earth Council had made itself\r\nhis enemy; he could not be expected to trust his life in enemy hands.\r\n\r\nThe note closed with the suggestion that the Council withdraw its patrol\r\nfrom Venia. This talk of war was childish. Withdraw the patrol, and\r\nTarrano himself might go back to Venus. He would wait a day for answer\r\nto this request; and if it were not granted--if the patrol were not\r\nentirely removed--then the Brende model would be destroyed. And if the\r\npublics of three worlds wished to depend upon a conceited, ignorant\r\nyoung man like Georg Brende for the everlasting life, they were welcome\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nA clever piece of trickery, and it was awkward to deal with. One had\r\nonly to watch its effect upon the public to realize how insidious it\r\nwas. Tarrano had told us--in the tower in Venia: \"I shall have to\r\nbargain with them.\" And chuckled as he said it.\r\n\r\nA series of notes from the Earth Council and back again, followed during\r\nthe next few days. But the patrol was not withdrawn; nor was war\r\ndeclared. The Earth Council knew that Tarrano had not ordered the model\r\nback--nor would he destroy it. Yet if the Earth forces were to overwhelm\r\nTarrano, and the model were lost, a revolution upon Earth could easily\r\ntake place before Georg could convince the people that he was able to\r\nbuild them another model.\r\n\r\nThis delay--while Tarrano was held virtually a prisoner in Venia--was\r\ndecided upon at the instigation of Georg himself. He--Georg--would\r\naddress the publics of the three worlds. With Maida beside him to\r\ninfluence her own public in Venus, they would convince everyone that\r\nGeorg had the secret--and that he alone would use it for the public\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nYouthful plans! Youthful enthusiasm! The belief that they could win\r\nconfidence to their cause by the very truthfulness in their hearts! The\r\nbelief that right makes might--which Tarrano would have told them was\r\nuntrue!\r\n\r\nYet it was a good plan, and the Earth Council approved it, since it\r\ncould do no harm to try. And it perhaps would have been successful but\r\nfor one thing, of which even at that moment I--in Venia--was aware.\r\nTarrano's trickery was not all on the surface. He had written into that\r\nnote--by a code of diabolically ingenious wording--a secret message to\r\nhis own spies in Washington. Commands for them to obey. A dozen of his\r\nspies were in the Earth government's most trusted, highest service--and\r\nsome of them were there in Washington, close around Georg and Maida as\r\nthey made their altruistic plan.\r\n\r\nThe attempt was to be made from the high-power sending station in the\r\nmountains of West North America.[13] Our observatory was there; and the\r\nonly one of its kind on the Earth. It was equipped to send a radio voice\r\naudibly to every part of the Earth; and by helio, also to Mars and\r\nVenus, there to be re-transformed from light to sound and heard\r\nthroughout those other worlds. And moving images of the speakers, seen\r\non the finders all over the Earth, Venus and Mars simultaneously. The\r\npower, the generating equipment was at this station; and no matter where\r\nin the sky Venus or Mars might be, from the Mountain Station the\r\nvibrations of mingled light and sound were relayed elsewhere on Earth to\r\nother stations from which the helios could be flashed direct.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The Rocky Mountains, in the United States or possibly\r\nAlberta.]\r\n\r\nTo Skylan, as the Mountain Station was popularly called, Georg and Maida\r\nwere taken in official aero under heavy convoy. Yet, even then, at their\r\nvery elbows, spies of Tarrano must have been lurking.\r\n\r\nThe official flyer landed them on the broad stage amid deep, soft snow.\r\nIt was night--a brief trip from the late afternoon, through dinner and\r\nthey were there. A night of clear shining stars--brilliant gems in deep\r\npurple. Clear, crisp, rarefied air; a tumbling expanse of white, with\r\nthe stars stretched over it like a close-hung canopy.\r\n\r\nThey were ushered into the low, rambling building. The attempt was to be\r\nmade at once. Mars was mounting the eastern sky; and to the west, Venus\r\nwas setting. Both visible from direct helios at that moment--Red Mars,\r\nfrom this mountain top, glowing like the tip of an arrant-cylinder up\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn the brief time since the party had left Washington, the worlds had\r\nbeen notified. The eyes and ears of the millions of three planets were\r\nwaiting to see and hear this Georg Brende and this Princess Maida.\r\n\r\nThe sending room was small, circular, and crowded with apparatus. And\r\nabove its dome, opened to the sky, wherein the intensified helios shaded\r\nso that no ray of them might blind the operators, were sputtering as\r\nthough eager to be away with their messages.\r\n\r\nWith a dozen officials around him, Georg prepared to enter the sending\r\nroom. He had parted from Maida a few moments before, when she had left\r\nhim to be shown to her apartment by the women attendants.\r\n\r\nAs she moved away, on impulse he had stopped her. \"We shall succeed,\r\nMaida.\"\r\n\r\nHer hand touched his arm. A brave smile, a nod, and she had passed on,\r\nleaving him standing there gazing after her with pounding heart.\r\nPounding, not with excitement at the task before him in that sending\r\nroom; pounding with the sudden knowledge that the welfare of this frail\r\nlittle woman meant more to him than the safety of all these worlds.\r\n\r\nAt last Georg stood in the sending room. The officials sat grouped\r\naround him. Maida had not yet arrived from her apartment. There was a\r\nsmall platform, upon which she and Georg were to stand together. He took\r\nhis place upon it, waiting for her.\r\n\r\nBefore him was the sending disc; it glowed red as they turned the\r\ncurrent into it. Then they illumined the mirrors; a circle of them, each\r\nwith its image of Georg upon the platform. The white lights above him\r\nflashed on, beating down upon him with their hot, dazzling glare. The\r\nreflected beams from the mirrors, struck upward into the dome overhead.\r\nThe helios up there were humming and sputtering loudly.\r\n\r\nBeyond the circle of intense white light in which Georg was standing,\r\nthe spectators sat in gloom behind the mirrors. Maida had not come. The\r\nSkylan Director, impatient ordered a woman to go for her.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, Georg said to this Director:\r\n\r\n\"I--these lights--this heat. It makes me feel faint--standing here.\"\r\n\r\nGeorg had stumbled from the platform. Between two of the mirrors, shaded\r\nfrom the glare, the perturbed Director met him. Moisture beaded Georg's\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\"I'll--be quite all right in a moment. I'm going over there.\" He smiled\r\nweakly. A dozen feet away there was an opened outer casement. It looked\r\ndown twenty feet, perhaps, to the deep snow that covered the station's\r\ngrounds. The Director started with Georg; but Georg pushed him violently\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"No! No! You let me alone!\" His accents were those of a spoiled child.\r\nThe Director hesitated, and Georg, with a hand to his forehead, wavered\r\ntoward the casement. The Director saw him standing there; saw him sway,\r\nthen fall or jump forward, and disappear.\r\n\r\nThey rushed outside. The snow was trampled all about with heavy\r\nfootprints, but Georg had vanished. From the women's apartment, the\r\nattendant came back. The Princess Maida could not be found!\r\n\r\nAnd in those moments of confusion, from outside across the starlit snow,\r\nan aero was rising. Silent, black--and no one saw it as it winged away\r\ninto the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_Tara_\r\n\r\n\r\nI must revert now to those moments in the tower room when Tarrano\r\ndissolved the isolation barrage which Wolfgar had thrown around us.\r\nGeorg escaped, as I have recounted. Tarrano--there in the tower\r\nroom--rendered me unconscious. I came to myself on the broad divan and\r\nfound Elza bending over me.\r\n\r\nI sat up, dizzily, with the room reeling.\r\n\r\n\"Jac! Jac, dear----\" She made me lie back, until I could feel the blood\r\nreturning to my clammy face; and the room steadied, and the clanging of\r\nthe gongs in my ears died away.\r\n\r\n\"I--why, I'm--all right,\" I gasped. And I lay there, clinging to her\r\nhand. Dear little Elza! In that moment of relief that I had come to my\r\nsenses, she could not hide the love which even now was unspoken between\r\nus. Tarrano! I lay there weak and faint; but with the pressure of Elza's\r\nhand, I did not fear that this Tarrano could win her from me.\r\n\r\nWolfgar was standing across the room from us. He came forward.\r\n\r\n\"You did not die,\" he said; and smiled. \"I told her you would not die.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now morning. Wolfgar and Elza told me I had been unconscious some\r\nhours. We were still imprisoned as before in the tower. Georg had\r\nescaped with Maida, they said; or at least, they hoped so. And they\r\ndescribed the burning of the other tower. The city had been in a\r\nturmoil. It still was; I could hear now the shouts of the crowd outside.\r\nAnd turning as I lay there, through the casement I could see the\r\nblackened, still smoking ruins of Maida's tower; the broken iron\r\nterrace; the spider bridge melted away, hanging loose and dangling like\r\nan aimless pendulum.\r\n\r\nThe latest news, Elza and Wolfgar could not give me. The instrument room\r\nof our tower had been disconnected by Tarrano when he left some hours\r\nbefore. As they said it, we heard a familiar buzz; then the drone of an\r\nannouncer's voice. Tarrano's guard had doubtless observed my recovery\r\nand had had orders to throw current into our instruments. Strange man,\r\nthis Tarrano! He wished the news spread before us again. Confident of\r\nhis own dominance over every crisis, he wanted Elza and me to hear it as\r\nit came from the discs.\r\n\r\nWe went to the instrument room. I found myself weak, but quite\r\nuninjured. Elza left us there, and went to prepare food which I needed\r\nto strengthen me.\r\n\r\nThe public events of those hours and days following, I have recounted as\r\nGeorg saw them and took part in them in Washington. We observed them,\r\nhere in the tower, with alternate hopes and fears. Our life of\r\nimprisonment went on much as before. Occasionally, Tarrano visited us,\r\nalways making us sit like children before him, while at his ease he\r\nreclined on our divan.\r\n\r\nBut he would never give us much real information; the man always was an\r\nenigma.\r\n\r\n\"Your friend Georg has a wonderful plan,\" he announced to us ironically\r\nearly one evening. He smiled his caustic smile. \"You have seen the\r\ntape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said. It was Georg's plan to address with Maida, the publics of\r\nEarth, Venus and Mars.\r\n\r\nTarrano nodded. \"He and the Princess are going to convince everyone that\r\nI am an impostor.\"\r\n\r\nI did not answer that; and abruptly he chuckled. \"That would be\r\nunfortunate for me--if they could do that. Do you think they'll be able\r\nto?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe laughed openly. \"Of course. But they will not. That long note of mine\r\nto your government--you read it, naturally. But you didn't read in it my\r\nsecret instructions to my agents in Washington, did you? Well, they were\r\nthere in it--my commands--the letters ending its words made another\r\nmessage.\"\r\n\r\nHe was amused at our discomfiture. \"Simple enough? Yet really an\r\nintricate code in itself. It made the phrasing of the main note a little\r\ndifficult to compose, that was all.\" He sat up with his accustomed snap\r\nof alertness, and his face turned grim. \"Georg will never address his\r\naudience. Nor the Princess--she will never appear before those sending\r\nmirrors. I have seen to that.\" Again he was chuckling. \"No, no, I could\r\nnot let them do a thing like that. They might turn people against me.\"\r\n\r\nElza began indignantly: \"You--you are----\"\r\n\r\nHis gesture checked her. \"Your brother is quite safe, Lady Elza. And the\r\nPrincess Maida also. Indeed, they are on the point of falling in love\r\nwith each other. Natural! And perfectly right. It is as I would have\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHis strong brown fingers were rubbing each other with his satisfaction.\r\n\"Curious, Lady Elza--how fortunate I am in all my plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you are,\" I said. \"Our government has you a prisoner\r\nhere. They didn't withdraw the patrol as you demanded, did they?\"\r\n\r\nHe frowned a trifle. \"No. That was too bad. I rather hoped they would.\r\nIt would have been a stupid thing for them to do--but still, I almost\r\nthought they'd do it.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \"What they will do is sweep down here and overwhelm\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHe shifted himself to a more comfortable position. \"They are playing for\r\ntime--so that when I fail to produce the model as I agreed, then the\r\npublic will realize I am not to be trusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am playing for time, also.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed so willing to discuss the thing that I grew bolder.\r\n\r\n\"What have you to gain by playing for time?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\nHe stared. \"You would question me, Jac Hallen? How absurd!\" He looked at\r\nElza, as though to share with her his amazement at my temerity.\r\n\r\nWolfgar said suddenly to Tarrano: \"You will gain nothing.\"\r\n\r\nTarrano's face went impassive. I understood him better now; that cold,\r\ninscrutable look often concealed his strongest emotions. He said evenly:\r\n\r\n\"I should prefer you not to address me, Wolfgar. A traitor such as\r\nyou--the sound of your voice offends me.\"\r\n\r\nIt struck me then as very strange--as it had for days before--that\r\nTarrano should have failed to punish Wolfgar. I would have expected\r\ndeath; least of all, that Tarrano would have allowed Wolfgar to live\r\nhere in the tower, in comparative ease and comfort. Tarrano's words now\r\nanswered my unspoken questions. He was not looking at Wolfgar, but at\r\nElza.\r\n\r\n\"You, Wolfgar--deserve death. You know why I cannot kill you? Why I let\r\nyou stay here in the tower?\" A faint, almost wistful smile parted his\r\nthin lips; he did not take his eyes from Elza.\r\n\r\n\"I am greatly handicapped, Wolfgar. The Lady Elza here would not like to\r\nhave me put you to death. She would not even care to have me mistreat\r\nyou. She is very tender hearted.\" He raised a deprecating hand. \"Ah,\r\nLady Elza, does that surprise you? You never told me I must be lenient\r\nwith this traitor? Of course not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I----\" Elza began, but he stopped her.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Lady Elza, I have already learned to obey you.\" He was smiling\r\nvery gently. \"Learned to obey even your unspoken commands.\"\r\n\r\nI wondered how much of this attitude might be sincere, and how much\r\ncalculated trickery. Could Elza, indeed, control him?\r\n\r\nShe must have had much the same thought, for she said with a forced\r\nsmile: \"You give me a great deal of power. If you--wish to obey me,\r\nyou'll set us free--send us all to Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThat amused him. \"Ah, but I cannot do that.\"\r\n\r\nShe gained confidence. \"You are willing to be very gracious in things\r\nwhich do not inconvenience you, Tarrano. It is not very impressive.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked hurt. \"You misinterpret. I will do for you anything I can. But\r\nyou must remember, Lady Elza, that my judgment is better than yours. I\r\nwould not let you lead us into disaster. You are a gentle little woman.\r\nYour instincts are toward humane treatment of everyone--toward mercy\r\nrather than justice. In all such things, I shall be guided by you.\r\nJustice--tempered with mercy. A union very, very beautiful, Lady\r\nElza ... But, you see, beyond that--you are wrong. I am a man, and in\r\nthe big things I must dominate. It is I who guide, and you who follow.\r\nYou see that, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nThe sincerity in his voice was unmistakable. And my heart sank as I\r\nwatched Elza. Her gaze fell, and a flush mantled her cheeks. Tarrano\r\nadded quietly: \"We shall have no difficulty, you and I, Lady Elza. Each\r\nof us a place, and a duty. A destiny together....\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off and rose quickly to his feet. \"Enough. I have been weak to\r\nsay so much as this.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to leave us, and I became aware of a woman's figure standing\r\nin the shadows of the archway across the room. She started forward as\r\nTarrano glanced her way. A Venus woman of the Cold Country. Yet,\r\nobviously, one of good birth and breeding. A woman of perhaps 30 years,\r\nbeautiful in the Venus cast; dressed in the conventional bodice\r\nbreast-plates and short skirt, with grey stockings and sandals.\r\n\r\nWithin the room, she regarded Tarrano silently. There was about her a\r\nquiet dignity; she stood with her tall, slim figure drawn to its full\r\nheight. Her pure white hair was coiled upon her head, with a rich metal\r\nornament to fasten it. And from it, a mantle of shimmering blue fabric\r\nhung down her back.\r\n\r\nTarrano said: \"What are you doing up here? I told you to wait below.\"\r\n\r\nHer face showed no emotion. But there was a glitter to her eyes, a glow\r\nin their grey depths like _alumite_ in the hydro-flame of a torch.\r\n\r\nShe said slowly: \"Master, I think it would be very correct if you would\r\nlet me stay here and serve the Lady Elza. I told you that before, but\r\nyou would not listen.\"\r\n\r\nTarrano, with sudden decision, swung toward Elza. \"This is the Elta[14]\r\nTara. She was concerned that I should allow you to dwell here alone with\r\nthis Jac Hallen, and this traitor from Mars.\" His tone conveyed infinite\r\ncontempt for us.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Elta--a term or title denoting rank by birth.]\r\n\r\nThe woman said quickly: \"The Lady Elza would be glad of my\r\ncompanionship.\" She shot a swift glance to Elza. What it was meant to\r\nconvey, I could not have said. Perhaps Elza understood it, or thought\r\nshe did. She spoke up.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to have you very much, indeed.\" She added to Tarrano, and\r\nthere was on her face a look of feminine guile:\r\n\r\n\"You, of course, could not refuse me so small a favor? After all your\r\nprotestations----\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured impatiently. \"Very well.\" And he added to Tara: \"You will\r\nserve the Lady Elza as she directs.\"\r\n\r\nHe stalked away into the darkened passage. In the gloom there, he\r\nstopped and again faced us; the light from a small blue tube in there\r\nillumined him dimly. He was smiling ironically.\r\n\r\n\"I shall maintain the instruments for you. The mirrors will show you\r\nGeorg and Maida. They are just about arriving at the Mountain Station.\r\nWatch them! You will see how far they progress with their wonderful\r\nspeeches.\"\r\n\r\nHe left us. We heard his measured tread as he stalked down the tower\r\nincline. The barrage about the tower was lifted momentarily as he went\r\nout. Then it came on again, with its glow beyond our casements, and its\r\nlow electrical whine.\r\n\r\nI was just turning back to the room when a sound behind me made me face\r\nsharply about. My heart leaped into my throat. The woman Tara had\r\nproduced from about her person a weapon of some kind. She thought she\r\nwas unobserved, but from the angle at which I stood, I saw her. A\r\ngleaming metal object was in her hand. And then she launched it--a small\r\nflat disc of metal, thin, and with its circular edge keen as a\r\nknife-blade.\r\n\r\nWhirling with a very soft hum hardly audible, it left her hand and\r\nfloated upward across the room. Circling the casements up near the\r\nceiling, and then heading downward straight for Elza! And I saw, too,\r\nthat the woman was guiding it by a tiny radio-control.\r\n\r\nThe thing was so unexpected that I stood gaping. But only for an\r\ninstant. I saw the deadly whirling knife-disc sailing for Elza.... It\r\nwould strike her ... shear her white throat....\r\n\r\nWith a shout of horror and anger, I leaped for the woman. But Wolfgar,\r\ntoo, had seen the disc and he went into action quicker than I. The divan\r\nwas beside him. He snatched up a pillow; flung it upward at the disc.\r\nThe soft pillow struck the disc; together, entangled, they fell\r\nharmlessly to the floor.\r\n\r\nI was upon the woman, snatching the handle of the control-wire from her\r\nhand, wrenching its connection loose from her robe. Under my onslaught,\r\nshe fell; and I kneeled beside her, gripping her while she tore at me\r\nand screamed with hysterical, murderous frenzy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_Love--and Hate_\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not harm this Tara, though I was sorely tempted to; and after a\r\nmoment we quieted her. She was crying and laughing by turns; but when we\r\nseated her on the divan she controlled herself and fell into a sullen\r\nsilence. Elza, pale and frightened at her escape, faced the woman, and\r\nwaved Wolfgar and me aside. Strange little Elza! Resolute, she stood\r\nthere, and would brook no interference with her purpose. Wolfgar and I\r\nwithdrew a pace or two and stood watching them.\r\n\r\nTara's breast was heaving with her pent emotion. She sat drooping on the\r\ndivan, her face buried in her hands.\r\n\r\nElza said gently: \"Why did you do that, Tara?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer; only the woman's catching breath as she struggled\r\nwith her sobs. Across the background of my consciousness came the\r\nthought that Tarrano or one of his guards would doubtless momentarily\r\nappear to investigate all this turmoil. And I was vaguely conscious also\r\nthat from our instrument room the sounds of an unusual activity were\r\ncoming. But I did not heed them. Elza was insisting:\r\n\r\n\"Why did you do that, Tara? Why should you want to harm me?\"\r\n\r\nTara looked up. \"You have stolen the man I love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Tarrano----\"\r\n\r\nShe broke off, set her lips firmly together as though to repress further\r\nwords; and her fine grey eyes, filled with unbidden tears, were\r\nsmoldering to their depths with hate.\r\n\r\nImpulsively Elza sank to the floor beside the woman. But Tara drew away.\r\n\r\nElza said: \"Tarrano--he is a wonderful man, Tara. A genius--the greatest\r\nfigure of these three worlds....\"\r\n\r\nMy heart sank to hear her say it!\r\n\r\n\"... a genius, Tara. You should be proud to love him....\"\r\n\r\n\"You----\" The woman's writhing fingers seemed about to reach for Elza. I\r\ntook a sudden step forward, then relaxed. Elza added quickly:\r\n\r\n\"But I would not steal Tarrano from you. Don't you realize that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's true.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! No! You have stolen him! With your queer Earth beauty--that colored\r\nhair of yours--those rounded limbs--you've bewitched him! I can see it.\r\nYou can't lie to me! I made him angry once and he admitted it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I tell you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I say yes. You've stolen him from me. He loves you--and he mocks and\r\nlaughs at me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Tara, wait. I do not love Tarrano, I tell you. I would not have\r\nhim----\" How my heart leaped to hear her say it so convincingly. She\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"He loves me, perhaps--but I can't help that. He has me prisoner here. I\r\nam forced----\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie! You are playing to win him! What girl would refuse? You say\r\nyourself he is the greatest man of the ages. You lie when you tell me\r\nyou do not want him!\"\r\n\r\nElza had taken the woman by the shoulders. \"Tara, listen--you _must_\r\nlisten! Are you mated with Tarrano?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! But years ago he promised me. I took his name then, as we do in the\r\nCold Country. They still call me Tara! Years I have waited, true to my\r\npromise--with even my name of maidenhood relinquished. _His_ name--Tara!\r\nAnd now he tosses me aside--because _you_, only an Earth woman, have\r\nbewitched him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to bewitch him, Tara.\" Elza's voice was very gentle; and\r\na whimsical smile was plucking at her lips. \"You think I want him\r\nbecause he is a genius--the greatest man of our time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that why _you_ want him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I love him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You loved him before he was very great, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Back in the Cold Country. When he was only a boy--and I was no\r\nmore than a girl half grown. I love him for himself, I tell you----\"\r\n\r\nElza interrupted; and her voice risen to greater firmness, held a\r\nquality of earnest pleading.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, Tara! You love Tarrano for himself--because you are a woman\r\ncapable of love. It is the man you love--not his deeds, or his fame or\r\nhis destiny. Isn't that so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I----\"\r\n\r\n\"Then won't you give me credit for being a woman with instincts as fine\r\nas your own? The love of a good woman goes unbidden. You can't win it by\r\nconquering worlds and flinging them at her feet. Tarrano thinks you can.\r\nHe thinks to dazzle me with his feats of prowess. He wants to buy my\r\nlove with thrones for me to grace as queen. He thinks my awe and fear of\r\nhim are love. He thinks a woman's love is born of respect, and\r\nadmiration, and promises of wealth. But you and I, Tara--we know it\r\nisn't. We know it's born of a glance--born in poverty and\r\nsickness--adversity--every ill circumstance--born without reason--for no\r\nreason at all. Just born! And if anything else gives it birth--it is not\r\na true woman's love. You and I know that, Tara. Don't you see?\"\r\n\r\nTara was sobbing unrestrainedly now, and Elza, with arms around her,\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n\"You should be proud to love Tarrano. If I loved him, I would be proud\r\nof him, too. But I do not----\"\r\n\r\nA step sounded near at hand. Tarrano stood in the archway, with arms\r\nfolded, regarding us sardonically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_Defying Worlds_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So?\" Tarrano eyed us, evidently in no hurry to speak further, seemingly\r\namused at our confusion. Had he heard much of what the two women had\r\nsaid? All of it, or most of it, doubtless, with his instruments as he\r\napproached. But, even with the knowledge of Elza's vehement appraisal of\r\nhim, he seemed now quite imperturbable. His gaze touched me and Wolfgar,\r\nthen returned to the women.\r\n\r\n\"So? It would seem, Tara, that your plan to wait upon the Lady Elza was\r\nnot very successful.\" He dropped the irony, adding crisply: \"Tara, come\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\nShe rose to her feet obediently, and stood facing him. Humble, fearful,\r\nyet a trifle defiant. For a moment he frowned upon her thoughtfully;\r\nthen he said to Elza:\r\n\r\n\"Your policy of mercy is very embarrassing, Lady Elza.\" He made a\r\ndeprecating gesture, and again his eyes were twinkling. \"This woman\r\nthreatened your life. My guards were lax--though I must admit they had\r\ngood excuse, with the other tasks which I thrust upon them.... Your life\r\nwas threatened--you escaped by the merest chance of fortune. You know,\r\nof course, what justice would bid me do to this would-be murderess?\"\r\n\r\nElza was on her feet, standing beside Tara. She did not answer.\r\n\r\nTarrano now was smiling. \"I must let her go unpunished? Embarrassing,\r\nthis merciful policy to which you have committed me! Yet--your will is\r\nmy law as you know--though I feel that some day it will involve us in\r\ndisaster.... You, Tara, will not be punished, much as you deserve it.\"\r\nHe paused, then said as an afterthought: \"You, Jac Hallen, I thank you\r\nfor what you tried to do in thwarting the attack. You acted in very\r\nclumsy fashion--but, at least, you doubtless did your best.\" Gravely he\r\nturned to Wolfgar. \"I shall not forget, Wolfgar, that, in an emergency,\r\nyou saved the life of Lady Elza.... Enough! These are busy moments. You\r\nchose an awkward time to raise this turmoil. Come with me--all of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe summoned Argo and two other guards. Unceremoniously, and with more\r\nhaste than I had ever seen in Tarrano, he led us from the building. A\r\nhint of his purpose came to me, as he bade Elza gather up her few\r\npersonal belongings, and gave them to a guard to carry.\r\n\r\nIn a group, he herded us across the spider bridge. It was early evening,\r\nbut night had fully fallen. The city was ablaze with its colored lights.\r\nWe crossed the bridge, passed through a tunnel-arcade, and came out to a\r\nplatform which was at the base of a skeleton tower. Its naked girders\r\nrose some seven hundred feet above us. The highest structure in the\r\ncity. A waiting lifting-car was there. We entered, and it shot us\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nAt the top, the narrowed structure was enclosed into a single room some\r\nthirty feet square. A many-windowed room, with a small metal balcony\r\nsurrounding it outside. Immediately above the room, at the very peak of\r\nthe tower, was a single, powerful light-beam; its silver searching ray\r\nswept the cloudless, starry sky in a slow circle.\r\n\r\nThe room was crowded with instruments. Unlighted, save by the reflected\r\nglow of its many image-mirrors, all of which seemed in full operation. A\r\ndozen intent men sat at the tables; a silent room, but for the hum and\r\nclick of the instruments.\r\n\r\nTarrano said softly: \"We have been very busy while you below were\r\nengaged with your petty hates.\"\r\n\r\nHe seated himself at a table apart, upon which was a single mirror, and\r\nhe gathered us around him. The mirror was dark. He called:\r\n\r\n\"Rax--let me see Mars--you have them by relay? The Hill City?\"\r\n\r\nThe mirror flashed on. From an aperture overhead, a tiny beam of the\r\nblue helio-transformer came down to it. In the mirror I saw an image of\r\nthe familiar Hill City. A terraced slope, dotted with the cubical\r\nbuildings, spires and tunnel mouths. An empty channel[15] curved down\r\nacross the landscape from the north.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Canal, as it now is thought to be.]\r\n\r\nA distant scene, empty and lifeless save for black puffs which rose in\r\nthe air above the city.\r\n\r\nTarrano called impatiently: \"Closer, Rax!\"\r\n\r\nThe image dissolved, blurred; turned red, violet, then white. We seemed\r\nnow upon a height close above the city. It was seething with confusion.\r\nFighting going on in the streets. Animals and men, fighting; a crowd of\r\nthe Little People thronging a public square, with beasts of war charging\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Hairless Men; I had heard of them, with their animals trained to\r\nfight, while they--the humans--lurked behind. A mysterious, almost\r\ngrewsome race, to us who live on Earth--these hairless dwellers of the\r\nunderground Mars. Dead-white of skin; sleek and hairless; heavily\r\nmuscled from the work of their world; and almost blind from living in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nThey were swarming now into the Hill City of the ruling Little People.\r\nThe beasts, at their commands, were running wild through the\r\nstreets ... dripping jaws, tearing at the women ... the children....\r\n\r\nI felt Elza turn away, shuddering.\r\n\r\nTarrano chuckled. \"The revolt. It came, of course, as I planned. This\r\nLittle People government--it was annoying ... Colley!\"\r\n\r\n\"Master?\"\r\n\r\n\"Send the message, Colley. Fling it audibly over Mars! Tell the rulers\r\nof the Little People that if they send up the green bomb of\r\nsurrender--Tarrano will spare them further bloodshed. Tell them that I\r\nam not giving the Brende secret to Earth. In a moment I shall defy the\r\nEarth Council. Promise them that the Brende secret is going to Mars.\r\nAssure them they will have everlasting life for everyone.... Wohl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Master?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me the Cave Station.\"\r\n\r\nThe mirror went dark. Then it turned a dazzling yellow. A cavern in the\r\ninterior of Mars. A dark scene of wavering yellow torches. Around a\r\ntable of instruments sat a score of hairless men. Tarrano snatched up a\r\nmouthpiece--murmured slowly into it. I could see the leader of the\r\nhairless men nod after a time, as the message reached him. And I saw him\r\nturn away to issue swift orders as Tarrano had commanded.\r\n\r\nTarrano said brusquely: \"Enough!... Wohl!\"\r\n\r\nThe mirror went dark. A voice called: \"Master, the green bomb has gone\r\nup from the Hill City! Do you wish to see?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.... Give me Venus. Olgan! Are they quiet on Venus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Congratulate them that we have conquered the Little People. Tell them\r\nMars is ours now! Tell them I am coming to Venus at once--with the\r\nBrende model....\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, you wish to see Venus? I have direct communication----\"\r\n\r\nAnother voice interrupted. \"The Earth Council, Master! They demand an\r\nexplanation of why you say the Brende model is going to Mars. You have\r\npromised it to Earth. They demand----\"\r\n\r\nTarrano rasped: \"Tell them to wait ... I don't want Venus,\r\nOlgan.... Megar! Give me the Earth Mountain Station.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to me, and his voice dropped again to that characteristic\r\nsardonic drawl:\r\n\r\n\"We must see how your friend Georg Brende is faring.\"\r\n\r\nThe mirror showed Georg, standing irresolute on the platform before the\r\nsending discs.\r\n\r\nTarrano called: \"The Princess Maida--can't you locate her?\"\r\n\r\nThe scene blurred momentarily, then showed us the outside of the\r\nStation. A white expanse of snow, with purple starlit sky above. From a\r\nside door of the building, as we watched, the figures of two women\r\nappeared. A woman leading Maida. As they came out, with Maida all\r\nunsuspecting, from the shadows a group of men pounced upon them--dragged\r\nMaida away.\r\n\r\nTarrano laughed. \"Enough!... Show me Georg Brende again.... Hurry!\"\r\n\r\nWe saw Georg waver and leap through the window, fall into the snow,\r\nwhere, from the shadows of the building, other men rushed out upon\r\nhim ... hurried him away after the captive Maida....\r\n\r\nTarrano's laugh was grim and triumphant. \"Ha! We win there, also!\r\nEnough! Nunz? Nunz--now you can give me the Earth Council! Where is it\r\nsitting? Washington, or Great London?\"\r\n\r\n\"Washington, Master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.... No, never mind connecting me. You speak for me. Tell them\r\nI've changed my mind. The Brende model is not coming to Washington. Tell\r\nthem Georg Brende is lost to them, also. Tell them I declare war!\r\n_Tarrano the Conqueror_ declares war on the Earth! Tell them that, with\r\nmy compliments. Tell them to come down here and overwhelm me--it ought\r\nto be very easy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_Escape_\r\n\r\n\r\nThat _Tarrano_ should thus defy the Earth, when by every law of rational\r\ncircumstance the move seemed to spell only his own disaster, was\r\ncharacteristic of the man. He stood there in the instrument room at the\r\npeak of the skeleton tower in Venia and rasped out to the Earth Council\r\nhis defiance. Silence followed--silence unbroken save by the hiss and\r\nclick of the instruments as the message was sent.\r\n\r\nAnd then Tarrano ordered thrown upon himself the lights and sending\r\nmirrors so that his own image might be available to all of the public\r\nand Earth officials who cared to look upon it. Within the circle of\r\nmirrors he stood drawn to his full height; his eyes flashing, heavy\r\nbrows lowered, and a sardonic smile--almost a leer--pulling at his thin\r\nlips. The embodiment of defiance. Yet to those who knew him well--as I\r\nwas beginning to know him--there was in his eyes a gleam of irony, as\r\nthough even in this situation he saw humor. A game, with worlds and\r\nnations as his pawns--a game wherein, though he had apparently lost,\r\nwith the confidence of his genius he knew that the hidden move he was\r\nabout to make would extricate him.\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" he rasped.\r\n\r\nThe mirrors went dark. He turned away; and still without appearance of\r\nhaste he drew Wolfgar, Elza and me to the balcony. Together we stood\r\ngazing over the lights of the city below us.\r\n\r\nA cloudless, starry sky. Empty of air-craft; but to the north just below\r\nthe horizon, we knew that the line of war vessels was hovering. Even\r\nnow, doubtless, they had their orders to descend upon us. Tarrano seemed\r\nwaiting, and I suppose we stood there half an hour. Occasionally he\r\nwould sight an instrument toward the north; and by the orders he gave at\r\nintervals I knew that preparations for action on his part were under\r\nway.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour. Then abruptly from below the northern horizon lights came\r\nup--spreading colored beams. The Earth war vessels! A line of them as\r\nfar as we could see from left to right, mounting up into the sky as they\r\nwinged their way toward us--a line spreading out in a broad arc. And\r\nthen, behind us, I saw others appear. We were surrounded.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent, awe-inspiring sight, that vast ring of approaching\r\ncolored lights. Red, green and purple--slowly moving eyes. Light-rockets\r\nsometimes mounting above them, to burst with a soundless glare of white\r\nlight in the sky; and underneath, the spreading white search-beams,\r\nsweeping down to the dark forest that lay all about us.\r\n\r\nSoon, in the white glare of the bombs, we could distinguish the actual\r\nshapes of the vessels. Still Tarrano did not move from his place by the\r\nbalcony rail. He stood there, with a hand contemplatively under his\r\nchin, as though absorbed by an interest in the scene purely impersonal.\r\nWas he going to give himself up? Stand there inactive while these armed\r\nforces of the most powerful world in the Solar System swept down upon\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nAbruptly he snapped his instrument back to his belt. He had not used it\r\nsince the hostile lights had appeared. Previously, I knew, he had been\r\nwatching those lights, with the curved ray of the instrument when the\r\nlights themselves had been below the horizon.\r\n\r\nHe turned now to me. \"They are here, Jac Hallen. Almost here. And I am\r\nat their mercy.\" His tone was ironic; then it hardened into grimness. He\r\nwas addressing me, but I knew it was for Elza's benefit he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I came here to Earth, Jac Hallen, for certain things. I find them now\r\naccomplished. I belong here no longer.\" He laughed. \"I would not force\r\nmyself into a war prematurely. That would be very unwise. I think--we\r\nshall have to avoid this--engagement. I am--slightly outnumbered.\"\r\n\r\nHe called an order, quite calmly over his shoulder. I suppose, at that\r\nmoment, the Earth war vessels were no more than five miles away. The\r\nwhole sky was a kaleidoscope of darting lights. In answer to his order,\r\nfrom the peak of our tower a light bomb mounted--a vertical ray of green\r\nlight. The bomb of surrender!\r\n\r\nTarrano chuckled. \"That should halt them. Come! We must start.\"\r\n\r\nHe held a brief colloquy with a Venus man who appeared beside him. The\r\nman nodded and hastened back into the instrument room. The green light\r\nof our bomb had died away. The lights in the sky began fading--the whole\r\nsky fading, turning to blackness! I became aware that Tarrano had thrown\r\naround our tower a temporary isolation barrage. For a few moments--while\r\nthe current he had at his command could hold it--we could not be seen on\r\nthe image finders of the advancing vessels.\r\n\r\nTarrano repeated: \"That should hold them--I have surrendered! They\r\nshould be triumphant. And outside our barrage, our men will bargain with\r\nthem. Ten minutes! We should be able to hold them off that long at\r\nleast. Come, Lady Elza. We must start now.\"\r\n\r\nWith a scant ceremony in sharp contrast to his courteous words to Elza,\r\nhe hurried us off. Three of us--Elza, Wolfgar and myself, with one\r\nattendant who still carried Elza's personal belongings. Hurried us into\r\nthe vertical car which had brought us up into the tower. It descended\r\nnow, down the iron skeleton shaft. Outside the girders I could see only\r\nthe blackness of the barrage, with faint snapping sparks.\r\n\r\nSilently we descended. It seemed very far down. And suddenly I realized\r\nthat we were going lower than the ground level. The barrage sparks had\r\nvanished. The blackness now was a normal darkness; and in it I could see\r\nslipping upward the smooth black sides of the vertical shaft into which\r\nwe were dropping. And the sulphuric smell of the barrage was gone. The\r\nair now smelt of earth--the heavy, close air of underground.\r\n\r\nI do not know how far down we went. A thousand feet perhaps. The thing\r\nsurprised me. Yet in those moments my mind encompassed it; and many of\r\nTarrano's motives which I had not reasoned out before now seemed plain.\r\nHe had come from Venus to the Earth, possibly several months ago. Had\r\ncome directly here to Venia and set up his headquarters. His purpose on\r\nEarth--as he had just told me--did not lie with warfare. While he was\r\nhere his forces had conquered the Great City of Venus, and just now, the\r\nHill City of Mars. He controlled Venus and Mars--but he was still far\r\nfrom ready to attack the Earth.\r\n\r\nHe had come to the Earth in person for several important purposes. For\r\none--he desired the Brende model and Dr. Brende's notes. He had them\r\nnow; they were, in reality, at this present moment in the Great City of\r\nVenus. Also, with the Brende secret--to control it absolutely--he had to\r\nhave Georg Brende. Well, as I was soon to realize, Georg was now his\r\ncaptive. And the Princess Maida? His purpose in holding her was\r\ntwo-fold. She had, now as always in the Venus Central State, a\r\ntremendous sentimental sway upon her people. Tarrano had abducted her,\r\nforcibly to remove her from the scene of action, so that during her\r\nunexplained absence his propaganda would have more influence. He had\r\nbrought her here to Earth; and now his plan was to have Georg Brende and\r\nher fall in love with each other. He still hoped to win Georg to his\r\ncause, by giving him the Princess Maida, if for no other reason. And\r\nwith Maida married to Georg--and Georg in Tarrano's service--Maida\r\nherself would turn her influence in Venus to consolidate her people to\r\nTarrano.\r\n\r\nThese, in part, were Tarrano's present plans and motives. They were\r\nworking out well. And--as he had said--the Earth did not concern him now\r\nas a battle-ground. Later ... But even with this sudden insight which\r\nseemed to come to me, I was inadequate to grasp what later he was to\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nWhile thus occupied with my thoughts, we were steadily descending into\r\nthe ground under Venia--dropping out of sight while above us, perhaps by\r\nnow, the eager warcraft of Earth were overwhelming the city. Tarrano had\r\nnot spoken; but when at last our little car bumped gently at the bottom,\r\nhe said smilingly: \"We are here, Lady Elza.\"\r\n\r\nWe left the car, and passed into a dim-lighted cavern. I saw a lateral\r\nblack tunnel-mouth yawning nearby, with a shining rail at its top and\r\nbottom, one above the other. And between the rails was a metal vehicle.\r\nA long, narrow car; yet with its turtle-back and its propelling gas-tube\r\nat the rear, with a rudder on each side of the tube, I realized that it\r\nwas designed also for sub-sea travel. A small affair. Ten feet at its\r\ngreatest width, and fifty or sixty feet long.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing startling in this evidence of underground and sub-sea\r\ntransportation. But that it should be here in primitive Venia surprised\r\nme. Then I realized that Tarrano had been here perhaps many months.\r\nQuietly, secretly he had constructed this underground road. For his\r\nescape, I could not doubt it. Indeed, I did not doubt but that the man\r\nhad anticipated practically every event which had occurred.\r\n\r\nWe found in the car, or boat if you will, a variety of attendants and\r\npersonal belongings. Tara was there; I saw her sitting alone on one of\r\nthe distant rings of seats. And Argo was among us--and others whom I had\r\nlearned to know by sight and name. It was the party and equipment which\r\nTarrano had probably originally brought with him from Venus. We, the\r\nlast arrivals in the car, took our places. The doors slid closed. The\r\ncar vibrated slightly; purred with its forward motors. We were started.\r\n\r\nIt was not a long trip. How far we went I have no means of knowing. But\r\nafter a time, by the changed motion and sounds, I realized that we were\r\ntraversing water. Then above us after another interval, they opened a\r\nhatchway. The pure fresh air of night streamed in upon us. Every light\r\nin the boat had been extinguished. At Tarrano's command I followed him\r\nup the small spider incline and through the hatchway. We stood on a\r\nlittle circular space of the turtle-deck, well aft--an observation space\r\nenclosed by a low metal rail. A few feet below us dark glossy water was\r\nslipping past.\r\n\r\nAt a lazy hasteless pace, we were passing along what I saw to be a broad\r\nriver. The Riola Amazonia[16] I afterward learned it to be. Heavy banks\r\nof luxurious foliage, dark and silent. Inundated in places. And after a\r\nfew moments we slackened, turned sharply into one of the inundated coves\r\nand nosed slowly amid a tangle of the jungle bank.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Evidently the upper Amazon.]\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw, hidden here in the recesses of this pathless forest, a\r\nsmall inter-planetary flyer, painted a hazy grey-blue. Around and over\r\nit the vegetation had been carefully, cunningly trained. A few cautious\r\nlights illumined it now; but without them, and even in daylight, I knew\r\nthat from above it could never be seen.\r\n\r\nOur party entered it--a small but surprisingly luxurious vessel. The\r\nfoliage from above it was cut away by ready workmen; and in half an hour\r\nmore we were rising from the forest. Straight up, into that cloudless\r\nsky. The land dropped away beneath us; visually concave at first as the\r\ncircular horizon seemed to rise with us. The sky overhead fortunately\r\nwas empty--nothing in sight to bar our outward flight. And we carried no\r\nlights.\r\n\r\nIn a moment or two, so swiftly did we gather velocity, the lights of\r\nVenia--a distant patch of them--were visible. Then, further away, I\r\npresently saw the grey expanse of open sea. And as we mounted, the\r\nsimulated concavity of the Earth turned convex. I had never seen it\r\nthus--had never been so far above its surface before. A huge grey ball\r\ndown there which was our Earth. Outlines of sea and land. Then\r\ncontinents and oceans, enveloped by patches of cloud area. A\r\ngrey ball, changing to a glowing, vaguely dull red; then silver.\r\nDwindling--gleaming brighter silver on one side where the sunlight\r\nstruck it.\r\n\r\nWe were in the realms of outer, inter-planetary space!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_Playground of Venus_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a trip uneventful--save that to me, taking it for the first time,\r\nit was an experience never to be forgotten in a lifetime--we landed at\r\nthe Great City of Venus. We had sent no messages during the trip, and\r\nwith our grey-blue color, I think we escaped telescopic and even radio\r\nobservation by the Earth. Into our vessel's small instrument room, where\r\nTarrano spent most of his time, reports of the news occasionally drifted\r\nin. But his connection--small and inadequate--was often broken. Nor did\r\nTarrano this time seem interested in having Wolfgar, Elza and me learn\r\nthe news. Yet it was not unfavorable to him. I gathered that the Earth\r\nformally had accepted his declaration of war. Relations with Venus--and\r\nwith Mars also, had been discontinued. The mails no longer left. The\r\nhelios were stopped. But, so far as I could learn, the Earth was\r\nundertaking no offensive action. For the present, certainly.\r\n\r\nSoon we were beyond reach of all messages save helios, which were not in\r\noperation. And in another day news began reaching us from Venus. But\r\nfrom this Tarrano barred us.\r\n\r\nI saw Venus, as we dropped upon it, first as a tremendous lovely\r\ncrescent of silver beneath us. A crescent first, and, as hours passed,\r\nthe darkened area took shape. A ball hanging there in space. Growing\r\nalmost momentarily larger. Soon we could distinguish cloud areas. Then\r\nthe land--the water. A ball filling half our lower segment of sky. Then\r\nall of it.\r\n\r\nWe reached the Venus atmosphere, passed through cloud masses, and out\r\nagain into the brilliant sunshine. Below us, glowing with the glory of\r\nmid-day, lay the Venus Central State. Rolling hills with distant\r\nmountain peaks, the highest of them far-away, glittering white with the\r\nsunlight on their snow-caps.\r\n\r\nA land of warmth and beauty. Dazzling green, with a luxuriant\r\nvegetation, tropical yet strange.\r\n\r\nAs we dropped lower, I sat alone, gazing downward. We were passing over\r\nthe land now, at an altitude of no more than twenty thousand feet. A\r\nvivid land. Vivid sunlight; inky shadows; a green to everything--a\r\nsolid, brilliant green. Amid it, spots of other colors; splashes of\r\nyellow; patches of scarlet as though some huge field were massed with\r\nscarlet blossoms. And trailing silver threads--rivers and streams. Or\r\nagain glittering silver lakes nestling in the hills.\r\n\r\nA fairyland of beauty. Yet as I gazed, it seemed not the fairyland of a\r\nchild. Not childish, but mature; for I could not miss in its aspect, a\r\nwarmth, a quality of sensuousness. A land of dalliance and pleasure of\r\nthe senses. And I realized then why the Venus people derived all their\r\nadvancement of science and industry from Earthly and Martian sources. A\r\nhand of luxury and physical ease. People, not primitive--but decadent.\r\n\r\nI became aware of Wolfgar at my elbow. \"It is very beautiful, eh, Jac\r\nHallen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful--yes. You've been here before, Wolfgar?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"Oh yes. Soon we will reach the Great City. That too is\r\nstrange and beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nElza saw us together and joined us. The Great City presently came into\r\ndistant view. Wolfgar, with that gentle voice and smile characteristic\r\nof him began to describe to us what we should see. Abruptly Elza said:\r\n\r\n\"I have never really thanked you, Wolfgar. You saved my life--there when\r\nTara attacked me.\"\r\n\r\nHe gestured. \"Your thanks are more than such a service deserves.\"\r\n\r\nAs though the subject had suggested Georg and Maida to him, he added,\r\n\"I am wondering where Georg Brende and the Princess Maida may be.\"\r\n\r\nI fancied then that I saw a quality of wistfulness in his eyes. A gentle\r\nlittle fellow, this Mars man. Queer and brooding, with strange thoughts\r\nnot to be fathomed. He added as though to himself: \"I have often\r\nwondered--\" Then stopped.\r\n\r\nElza and I had discussed it. We felt sure that Georg and Maida had been\r\ntaken to Venus. They could have had only a few hours' start of\r\nourselves. Yet this vessel we were in was unusually slow. We felt\r\nconvinced that they had already arrived on Venus--had been there perhaps\r\nalready for a day.\r\n\r\nWe discussed it now with Wolfgar as the Great City came under us; but\r\nsoon we fell silent, gazing down into this beautiful capital of the\r\nCentral State.\r\n\r\nIt lay in a broad hollow, a large, irregular circular bowl surrounded by\r\ngently sloping hillsides. The bowl was entirely filled by water--a broad\r\nflat lake of silver which from this height showed us its pearly bottom.\r\nOn the water--seen from above--the houses seemed floating--clusters of\r\nlily pads on a placid shining pool. They were, in reality, flat cubical\r\nbuildings solidly built of rectangular blocks of stone, standing just\r\nabove the water level on solid stone foundations. Always green and\r\nwhite--stones like blocks of smooth, polished marble, set in green and\r\nwhite patterns. Balconies and cornices of what might have been gleaming,\r\nbeaten copper. Flat roofs, edged with scarlet flowers.\r\n\r\nSome of the buildings were low and small. Others of several stories,\r\npretentious and ornate. One very large, like a palace, standing alone on\r\nits verdant island.\r\n\r\nThe houses were mostly gathered in clusters of various shapes and sizes.\r\nYet a semblance of order prevailed. Winding streets of open water lay\r\nbetween the groups. There were trellised walks and arching spider\r\nbridges, sometimes over the streets, sometimes joining one house to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nHere and there I saw lagoons of open water, dotted with small green\r\nislands like parks--islands on which the vegetation grew far higher and\r\nmore luxuriant than any even in the tropics of our Earth. Vegetation\r\nalways under careful training and control. Profuse with flowers, vivid\r\nand gigantic. The houses too, were roofed with gardens--sometimes\r\nwith pergolas and trellises of the aerial scarlet blossoms.\r\nOccasionally--these latter details I observed as we descended close upon\r\nthe city--I saw houses with a tiny swimming pool on the roof--a private\r\npool hidden in masses of colored flowers.\r\n\r\nA playground--the playground of Venus. It seemed very\r\nbackward--uncivilized. And then Wolfgar pointed out the surrounding\r\nhillsides. On them, cleared of their vegetation, our modern civilization\r\nstood gaunt and efficient. Towers, aerials, landing stages, aerial\r\ntrams, factories, tall stacks over the dynamo houses belching thick\r\nblack smoke, which artificial wind-generators carefully blew away from\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their hillside ring of necessary modernity, the people\r\nof the Great City had kept their playground inviolate. Work, science,\r\nindustry--all necessary. But the real business of life was pleasure.\r\nArt, music, beauty.... And I am not far from thinking that unless\r\nabused, their formula is better than ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_Violet Beam of Death_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe landed on a stage at the summit of one of the nearer hillsides. Our\r\ncoming--unheralded since we had carried no sending instruments--created\r\na furor. The workers rested to watch us as we disembarked. It was not so\r\ndifferent a scene, here on the hill, than might have occurred on Earth.\r\nWe took a moving platform, down the hill, to the water's edge. A barge\r\nwas awaiting us--a broad flat vessel with gaudy trappings. A score of\r\nattendants lined its sides, each with a pole to thrust it through the\r\nshallow water. And on its high-raised stern, beneath a canopy was a\r\ncouch upon which Tarrano reclined, with us of his party at his feet.\r\n\r\nA royal barge, queerly ancient, barbaric--reminding me of the flat,\r\nmotionless pictures of Earth's early history. Yet it was a symbol here\r\non Venus, not of barbarism, but of decadence.\r\n\r\nWe started off. I may have given a false idea of the size of the Great\r\nCity. Its lake, indeed, was fully fifteen miles or more in diameter.\r\nHalf a million people lived on or close around that placid stretch of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe news of Tarrano's arrival had instantly spread. Graceful boats, all\r\npropelled by hand, thronged our course. From them, and from every\r\nhouse-window, balcony and roof-top, a waving multitude cheered the\r\ncoming of the Master. The new Master, to whom so recently they had given\r\ntheir allegiance--the Master who in return was to endow them with life\r\neverlasting.\r\n\r\nIt was a gay, holiday throng--cheering us, tossing flower-petals down\r\nupon us as we passed majestically beneath the bridges. Yet among these\r\ngaudily dressed women and men with the luster of wealth and ease upon\r\nthem, others mingled. Others of a lower class, poorly dressed, with the\r\nbadge of servitude upon them, enthralled in a social peonage which I did\r\nnot yet understand.\r\n\r\n\"_Slaans_,\" Wolfgar called them. A term half of derision, half contempt.\r\nAnd Wolfgar pointed one out to me. A huge grey, surly-looking fellow\r\npassing in a one-man shell or boat of tree-fibre. He gazed up at us as\r\nhe went by--a furtive glance of cold, sullen fury. Unmistakable. And I\r\nsaw it again on others of his kind--men, women, even children who gazed\r\nat us with big, round eyes. A dumb, sullen resentment, with a\r\nsmouldering fury beneath it.\r\n\r\nDuring the trip, which may have taken an hour, I remarked something\r\nalso, which did not at the time seem significant but very soon I was to\r\nrecall it and understand its import. Argo, of course, was still with us.\r\nAs we embarked upon the barge, a man evidently an official of the Great\r\nCity had paid his humble respects to Tarrano and then withdrawn to a\r\nfurther part of the vessel, drawing Argo with him. I saw the two in\r\nclose conversation. The official evidently was telling Argo something of\r\nimportance. I could see Argo growing indignant and then his eyes\r\ngleaming, a leer upon his cruel lips.\r\n\r\nDuring the trip Tarrano sat calm, half reclining on his couch--sat\r\nwatching with his keen expressionless eyes the applause of the\r\nmultitude. It was, I think, and I believe he felt it also, the height of\r\nhis career up to that time--this triumphant entry into the greatest city\r\nof Venus. He did not speak, just sat watching and listening, with a half\r\nsmile of triumph pulling at his mouth. Yet I know too, that those keen\r\neyes of his did not miss the sullen glances of the _slaans_.\r\n\r\nThe weather, as always in the Venus Central State, was warm--a luxurious\r\ntropic warmth. And now I felt--as I had seen from above--the languorous,\r\nsensuous quality of it all. Music, mingled with the ripple of girlish\r\nlaughter and cheers, came from the houses as we passed. Soft, fragrant\r\nflower-petals deluged us. The very air was laden heavy with exotic\r\nperfumes from the flowers which were everywhere.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at last at what appeared to be a palace--a broad, low\r\nbuilding of polished stone, on an island of its own. It was the building\r\nI had noticed when first we saw the Great City from above. Gardens were\r\nabout the building, and on its roof. Flowers lined its many balconies.\r\n\r\nWe drew up to a stone landing-place.\r\n\r\n\"The palace of the Princess Maida,\" Wolfgar whispered.\r\n\r\nBut I had no time to question him. Attendants appeared. A queer mixture.\r\nIncongruous men of science, armed with belts of instruments. They\r\ngreeted Tarrano humbly; escorted him away.\r\n\r\nOther attendants. Natives of the city, in the flowing, bright-colored\r\nrobes we had seen everywhere. A group of them--laughing young\r\ngirls--descended upon us.\r\n\r\n\"The Princess Maida bids you welcome.\"\r\n\r\nThey hurried us into the building. I was surprised. Tarrano had\r\nseemingly ignored us. It was quite as though we were honored guests,\r\narriving in the Central State when Maida was its ruler.\r\n\r\nLed by the girls, we passed upward into the building past splashing\r\nfountains, cascades of perfumed water with tubes of silver light\r\ngleaming in its midst; and were thrust at last into a room.\r\n\r\nThe girls withdrew. Across the floor-polished stone, with heavy woven\r\nrugs upon it--Georg and the Princess Maida advanced upon us.\r\n\r\nOur greetings were brief. I could have talked to them both for a day,\r\nquestioning them; and they, no doubt, had as much to ask of us. But they\r\nwere solemn, grave and anxious.\r\n\r\n\"Not now, Jac,\" Georg said to check me. \"Elza dear--I have been so\r\nworried over you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But----\" I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Jac--the situation here--our own cause--the safety of our Earth\r\nitself--this Tarrano--\"\r\n\r\nBut Maida stopped him. \"The very air has ears. Not now.\" Her glance\r\nturned to Wolfgar; her slim hands went out to greet him. \"Wolfgar, my\r\nfriend. It is good to see you here.\"\r\n\r\nWolfgar knelt before her, gazed for one instant into her eyes, and then\r\nwith head bowed, brushed the hem of her robe to his face.\r\n\r\nShe laughed gently. \"Stand up, Wolfgar. I would not be the Princess\r\nMaida to you now. Only--your friend. Your grateful friend.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden soundless flash. From across the room a beam of\r\nviolet flame darted at us. It struck just between Maida and Wolfgar, as\r\nhe rose from his knee. Both of them involuntarily stepped backward,\r\napart from each other. And between them, breast high, the flame hung\r\nlevel across the room. Maida was on one side of it; all the rest of us,\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nI turned. At the door, Argo had appeared. From a black object in his\r\nhand, the beam was streaming. He rested the black thing on a wall ledge\r\nso that the beam hung level.\r\n\r\n\"Stand where you are, all of you.\" He started toward Maida, behind the\r\nbeam from the rest of us.\r\n\r\nGeorg made as though to leap forward, but Wolfgar restrained him. \"Wait!\r\nYou don't understand--that's death!\"\r\n\r\nI saw now that the violet light had encircled us. Only Maida and Argo\r\nwere outside it. He was approaching her, with a cylinder in his hand.\r\nThe ray from it struck her without power of movement or speech. Her\r\neyes, terrified, turned to us. Again Georg would have leaped, but\r\nWolfgar shouted, \"Wait! That's death! Don't you understand?\"\r\n\r\nArgo was leering. \"Death? Yes! If you touch that violet light! Death, of\r\ncourse. But you won't touch it! You will stand and watch--stand silently\r\nfor you know that if you shout, the vibrations will bring the beam upon\r\nyou. You won't move--you'll stand and watch me kill your Princess\r\nMaida--not quickly--she is too beautiful for that. You, Georg\r\nBrende--you, Wolfgar, traitor from Mars. You shall see your Princess\r\nMaida die--this would-be traitoress to my Master Tarrano!\"\r\n\r\nWith all the strength of his puny body Wolfgar flung Georg\r\nbackward--safely away from the deadly violet beam. And then, without\r\nwarning, without a cry which would endanger us, the little Mars man\r\nsprang headlong, into and through the violet beam of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n_Passing of a Friend_\r\n\r\n\r\nWolfgar was not dead; but when we picked him up it was obvious that he\r\nwas dying. The violet beam vanished as his body struck it--vanished with\r\na hiss and splutter, and a puff of sulphuric smoke that mingled with the\r\nsmell of burning garments and flesh.\r\n\r\nGeorg and I leaped forward. Argo was standing transfixed by surprise at\r\nwhat Wolfgar had done; and as the beam died, Georg was upon him.\r\n\r\n\"One moment!\"\r\n\r\nThe quiet, commanding voice of Tarrano. He must have come quickly, when\r\ninformed by the finders of Argo's treachery. Yet he stood now at the\r\narcade entrance, drawn to his full height, frowning with lowered brows,\r\nbut wholly without appearance of haste.\r\n\r\n\"One moment--stand aside, all of you.\"\r\n\r\nArgo cowered. The rest of us moved aside. Elza came toward me, and I put\r\nmy arm around her. Poor little Elza! She was shivering with fright.\r\n\r\nTarrano seemed not to need information as to what had transpired. His\r\neyes, roving over us, saw the lifeless, seared body of Wolfgar lying on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\"Too bad,\" he said. Then his gaze swung to Argo.\r\n\r\n\"Master----\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\"\r\n\r\nThere was on Tarrano's face and in his voice an expression, a tone quite\r\nnew to me. A quiet grimness. More than that. A quality of deadliness--of\r\ninexorable deadliness which could well have chilled the stoutest heart\r\nthat fronted it.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Argo.\" Tarrano stood quite motionless. \"Argo!\"\r\n\r\n\"Master! Master, you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Come!\"\r\n\r\nArgo was on the floor. Shaking with terror--for he, probably better than\r\nany of us, understood what was coming--dragged himself to Tarrano's\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"Stand up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, have mercy----\"\r\n\r\n\"Stand up! Are you a man?\"\r\n\r\nArgo's legs would barely support him, but he struggled to get himself\r\nerect. With a wrench, Tarrano tore the robe from Argo's chest.\r\n\r\n\"Master! Master! Have mercy!\"\r\n\r\nIn Tarrano's hand I saw a needle-like piece of steel. A dagger, yet it\r\nwas more like a needle.\r\n\r\n\"Master--Oh----\"\r\n\r\nTarrano had stabbed it gently into the man's chest. A mere prick into\r\nthe flesh, and a tiny drop of blood oozed out.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Argo stood swaying. Eyes white-rimmed with mortal terror as\r\nhe stupidly looked down at the drop of blood. A moment, then the\r\ninjected poison took effect. He tottered, flung his arms above his head\r\nand fell. Lay writhing an instant; then twitching; and then quite still.\r\n\r\nTarrano turned away, his face impassive. \"Unfortunate. He was a good man\r\nin many ways--I shall be sorry to lose his services.\" He saw me with my\r\narm around Elza, and he frowned.\r\n\r\n\"So?\"\r\n\r\nInstinctively, involuntarily--and I hated myself for it--I dropped my\r\narm.\r\n\r\nGeorg exclaimed: \"Wolfgar--he----\"\r\n\r\nTarrano turned from me. \"He is not dead--but he will die. There is\r\nnothing we can do. I'm very sorry--very sorry indeed.\"\r\n\r\nA sincere regret was in his tone. We lifted Wolfgar up, carried him to a\r\ndepression in the floor by the wall--a shallow, couch-like bowl\r\nhalf-filled with down.\r\n\r\nOn the floor we gathered, seated on cushions; and presently Wolfgar\r\nregained consciousness. His face was not burned. It lighted with a dazed\r\nsmile; and his eyes, searching us, picked out Maida.\r\n\r\n\"You are safe--I'm--so glad.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was low and labored; and at once his eyes closed again as\r\nthough the effort of speaking were too great.\r\n\r\nMaida was sitting near me at Wolfgar's head, bending over him. She had\r\nrecovered from her terror of Argo; and as she leaned down, gazing at the\r\ndying Wolfgar, I think I have never seen so gentle, so compassionate an\r\nexpression upon the face of any woman.\r\n\r\nElza whispered: \"There must be something we can do. The men of\r\nmedicine--the lights--the healing lights! Georg! Cannot you use\r\nfather's----\"\r\n\r\nThey were only an overwrought girl's excited ideas, of course. Wolfgar's\r\nlungs were seared; even as Elza spoke, he coughed, and blood welled from\r\nhis mouth--blood which Georg quickly wiped away.\r\n\r\nTarrano was on his feet behind us, with folded arms; and as he looked\r\ndown, I saw on his face also--the face which a few moments before had\r\nbeen grim with deadly menace--a look now of gentle compassion very much\r\nlike Maida's.\r\n\r\n\"No use,\" he said softly. \"We can do nothing. He will die.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Wolfgar's eyes opened. \"Die--of course.\" He tried to raise one of\r\nhis burned hands, but dropped it back. \"Die? Yes--of course. In just a\r\nmoment....\" His eyes, already dulled, swung about. \"Who is that--crying?\r\nThere's no need--to cry.\"\r\n\r\nIt was little Elza beside me, struggling to suppress her sobs.\r\n\r\nWolfgar's slow, labored voice demanded: \"That isn't--my Princess Maida\r\ncrying--is it? I don't want--her to cry----\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Georg gently. \"Maida is here--right here by you. She isn't\r\ncrying.\"\r\n\r\nHis gaze found Maida's face. \"Oh, yes--I can see you--Princess Maida.\r\nYou're not crying--that's good. There's nothing to--cry about.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed for a moment to gather a little strength; he moved his head\r\nand saw Tarrano standing there behind us.\r\n\r\n\"Master?\" He used the old term with a whimsical smile. \"I--called you\r\nthat--for a long time, didn't I? You have a right to consider me a\r\ntraitor----\"\r\n\r\n\"A spy,\" said Tarrano very gently. \"Not a traitor. That you would have\r\nbeen had you served me--a traitor to your Princess.\"\r\n\r\nWolfgar's head tried to nod; relief was on his face. \"I'm--glad you\r\nunderstand. I would not want to die--having you think harshly of me----\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a man--I honor you.\" Abruptly Tarrano turned away and strode\r\nacross the room. And always since I have wondered if he left that scene\r\nof death because of the emotion he could not hide.\r\n\r\nGeorg said: \"You should not talk, Wolfgar.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I--want to talk. I have--only a few minutes. Just these--last few\r\nminutes--I want to talk to my--Princess Maida. You'll--excuse us--the\r\nPrincess Maida and me--won't you? Just for these last--few minutes?\"\r\n\r\nWe withdrew beyond his fading sight.\r\n\r\n\"My--Princess Maida----\"\r\n\r\nHis voice still reached us. She leaned closer over him. Her tears were\r\nfalling now, but as she spoke she strove for calmness.\r\n\r\n\"Wolfgar----\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes were glazing, but they dung to her. \"Princess----\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said. \"Just Maida--your friend. The woman you have given your\r\nlife for.\" Her voice almost broke. \"Oh, Wolfgar! Never shall I forget\r\nthat. To give your life----\"\r\n\r\n\"It is--a great honor.\" The gesture he made to check her words of thanks\r\nexhausted him. His eyes closed; for a moment he seemed not to breathe.\r\nAs Maida leaned down in alarm, her beautiful white hair tumbled forward\r\nover her shoulders. A lock of it brushed Wolfgar. He could not lift his\r\nhands, but they groped for the tresses, found them and clung. Her white\r\nwaves of hair, with his fingers, shriveled, burned black, entwined in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAgain his eyelids came up. \"You won't leave me--Princess Maida. Not for\r\nthese--last few minutes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she half whispered.\r\n\r\n\"You--cannot--if you would.\" His whimsical smile returned. \"You see? I\r\nam--holding you.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was silent. His eyes stayed open, staring dully at her.\r\nHis face and lips were drained now of their blood.\r\n\r\n\"You're--still there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Wolfgar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--of course I know you are. But I--cannot see you very well--now.\r\nYou look--so far away.\"\r\n\r\nShe put her face down quite close to him. Her eyes were brimming with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--yes,\" he said. \"That's better--much better. Now I can--see\r\nyou--very plainly. I was thinking--I wanted to--tell you something.\r\nIt--wouldn't be right to tell you--except that I'll soon--be gone where\r\nit won't make any difference.\"\r\n\r\nHe gathered all his last remaining strength. \"I--love you--Princess\r\nMaida.\"\r\n\r\nShe forced a gentle smile through her tears. \"Yes, Wolfgar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" he persisted, \"not as my Princess--just as--a woman.\r\nThe--woman I've always loved. That's been my secret. You see? It\r\nwould--always have been--my secret--the little Mars man Wolfgar--in love\r\nwith his Princess Maida. You--don't think it too impertinent of me--do\r\nyou? I mean--confessing it now--just at--the end?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she whispered. \"No, Wolfgar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you--very much.\" His breath exhaled with a faint sigh. \"Thank\r\nyou--very much. I wanted to tell you that--before I--go. And--if you\r\nwouldn't mind--I want to--call you--just Maida.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just Maida, Wolfgar. Yes, of course, I want you to call me that.\" Her\r\nvoice was broken. She brushed away her tears that he might not notice\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he agreed. His staring eyes were trying to see her. \"My Maida.\r\nYou're--very beautiful--my Maida. I--wonder--you see, I'm taking\r\nadvantage of you--I wonder if you'd say you--love me? I'd be so\r\nhappy--just to hear you say it.\"\r\n\r\nAs I sat there behind them, I prayed then that she might say it.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Wolfgar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he whispered. \"You _did_ say it! My Maida says that she loves me!\"\r\nHappiness transfigured his livid face. But his smile was whimsical\r\nstill. \"You're--very kind to me. Please--say it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Wolfgar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--that's how I always dreamed it would sound.\r\nI--love--you--Wolfgar.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed away; a film was settling over his staring eyes. Then\r\nagain his lips moved. \"Maida says--'I love you, Wolfgar' ... I'm--so\r\nhappy....\"\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly she realized that he was gone. Her pent-up emotion came\r\nwith a sob.\r\n\r\n\"Wolfgar! My friend--my wonderful, loyal friend--don't die, Wolfgar!\r\nDon't die!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n_Waters of Eternal Peace_\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Wolfgar was gone. It seemed at first very strange, unreal. It lay\r\na shadow of grief upon our spirits, for many hours a deeper shadow than\r\nall those grave events impending upon which hung the fate of three\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\nTarrano ordered for Wolfgar a public burial of ceremony and honor in the\r\nwaters of eternal peace--ordered it for that same evening. Once again\r\nTarrano demonstrated the strangeness of his nature. His arrival to take\r\npossession of Venus had been made the occasion of a great festival. \"The\r\nWater Festival,\" they called it, which was held only at times of\r\nuniversal public rejoicing. It was planned now to do honor to\r\nTarrano--planned for this same evening. But he postponed it a night;\r\ntonight was for Wolfgar.\r\n\r\nWe were still captives in Tarrano's hands, as we had been on Earth in\r\nVenia. Yet here in the Great City of Venus a curious situation arose.\r\nTarrano himself explained it to us that afternoon. An embarrassing\r\nsituation for him, he termed it.\r\n\r\n\"Very embarrassing,\" he said, with eyes that smiled at us quizzically.\r\n\"Just for your ears alone, you understand, I am willing to admit that I\r\nmust handle these Great City people very carefully. You, Princess\r\nMaida--you are greatly beloved of your people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"For that reason they would not like to know you are\r\nvirtually a captive. And you, Georg Brende--really, they are beginning\r\nto look on you as a savior--to save them from disease and death. It is\r\nrather unflattering to me----\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off, then with sudden decision added:\r\n\r\n\"Soon you two will realize that to join me will be your best course. And\r\nbest for all the worlds, for it will bring to them all peace and health\r\nand happiness.... No, I ask no decision from you now. Nor from you, Lady\r\nElza.\" His gaze softened as he regarded her--softened almost to a\r\nquantity of wistfulness. \"_You_ know, Lady Elza, for what I am striving.\r\nI may--indeed I shall--conquer the worlds. But you hold in the palm of\r\nyour little white hand, my real reward.... Enough!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he offered us a sort of pseudo-liberty. We might all come and\r\ngo about the Great City at will. Apparently--to the public eye--allied\r\nto Tarrano. The Princess Maida--as before--hereditary honored ruler;\r\nwith Tarrano guiding the business affairs of State, as on Earth our\r\nPresidents and their Councils rule the legendary Kings and Queens. The\r\none ruling in fact; the other, an affair of pretty sentiment.\r\n\r\nIt was this condition which Tarrano now desired to bring about. With\r\nGeorg already beloved for his medical knowledge; and flying rumors\r\n(started no doubt by Tarrano) that the handsome Earth man would some day\r\nmarry their Princess.\r\n\r\nMyself--the irony of it!--I was appointed a sort of bodyguard to the\r\nLady Elza--the little Earth girl whose presence in the Great City would\r\nhelp conciliate the Earth and bring about universal peace--with Venus in\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nSo ran the popular fancy, guided by Tarrano. We were given our\r\npseudo-liberty, watched always by the unseen eyes of Tarrano's guards.\r\nAnd there was nothing we could do but accept our status. Tarrano was\r\nguiding his destiny cleverly. Yet underneath it all, unseen forces were\r\nat work. We sensed them. The _slaans_--submissive at their menial tasks,\r\nbut everywhere with sullen, resentful glances. Perhaps Tarrano realized\r\nhis danger; but I do not think that he, any more than the rest of us,\r\nrealized what the Water Festival was to bring forth.\r\n\r\nThat night--our first night on Venus--midway between the darkness of\r\nsunset and the dawn--we buried Wolfgar. The air was soft and warm, with\r\na gentle breeze that riffled the placid waters of the lake. Overhead,\r\nthe sky gleamed with a myriad stars--reddish stars, all of them like Red\r\nMars himself as seen through the heavy Venus atmosphere. Largest of\r\nthem, the Earth. My birthplace! Save Elza here with me on Venus, that\r\ntiny red spot in the heavens, red like the tip of a lighted\r\narrant-cylinder, held all that was dear to me!\r\n\r\nThe funeral cortege--a solemn line of panoplied boats, started from the\r\npalace. Boats hung with purple fabric. In single file they wended their\r\nway through the city streets. From every landing, balcony, window and\r\nroof-top, the people stared down at us. The street corners were hung\r\nwith shaded tubes of light, shining down with spots of color to the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAs we passed, the people bowed their heads, hands to their foreheads,\r\npalms outward. The gesture of grief. From one building came a low\r\nmusical chant.\r\n\r\n\"Honor to Wolfgar! The man who gave his life for our Princess. Honor to\r\nWolfgar!\"\r\n\r\nWe came to the edge of the city. The lake here narrowed to a river--a\r\nlength of winding river opening to the pond which was the burial place\r\nof Eternal Peace. On Tarrano's barge, with Elza and Georg, we led the\r\nway. Maida was not with us. I asked Tarrano where she was, but solemnly\r\nhe denied me.\r\n\r\nAt the burial waters--on the sloping banks of which a silent throng had\r\ngathered--we landed. And following us, the other vessels of the cortege\r\ncame along and stopped beside us. The pond was dotted with white markers\r\nfor the graves. The whole scene unlighted, save for the stars, and the\r\nred and purple aural lights of the Venus heavens, which mounted the sky\r\nat this midnight hour. A great, glowing arc--the reflected glow from a\r\nmyriad cluster of tiny moons and moon-dust, encircling Venus. The soft\r\nlight from it flooded the water and the tombs with a flush of red and\r\npurple.\r\n\r\nAs we lay there against the bank, with that silent throng breathlessly\r\nwatching, from down the river came the last vessel of our cortege. It\r\nmade a scene I shall never forget. The bier. Draped in purple. A single,\r\nhalf-naked _slaan_ propelling it with a sweep from its stern. The body\r\nof Wolfgar lying on its raised prow--his dead, white face, with peace\r\nupon it. Beside the body, the lone figure of Maida, kneeling at\r\nWolfgar's head, with her white, braided hair falling down over her\r\nshoulders. Kneeling and staring, almost expressionless; but I knew that\r\nwith her whole heart she was speeding the soul of Wolfgar to its eternal\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n_Unseen Menace_\r\n\r\n\r\nThat day following the burial of Wolfgar, there was nothing of\r\nimportance occurred. No news from the Earth could get in. I felt that\r\nthe Earth might be planning an attack. Probably was, since war had been\r\ndeclared. Yet that of course was months away.\r\n\r\nTarrano apparently was engaged in the pleasurable triumph of the coming\r\nWater Festival. All day he seemed engaged in planning it. But I knew\r\nthat he was engaged secretly with far sterner things concerning the Cold\r\nCountry, which lay a day's journey from us. But what they were, I did\r\nnot know.\r\n\r\nThe Water Festival was all we talked of. That afternoon, Tarrano\r\ndescribing it, said smilingly:\r\n\r\n\"They say it is for me. But, Lady Elza--it is _I_ who plan it--for you.\r\nYou have not seen the Red Woman.\" A gleam of amusement played upon his\r\nlips; but as he regarded Elza, I saw another look--of speculation, as\r\nthough he were gauging her.\r\n\r\n\"The Red Woman, Lady Elza. She will preside tonight. You will find\r\nher--very interesting. We will watch her together, you and I.\"\r\n\r\nI did not know then what he meant; but I remembered the words later, and\r\nunderstood only too well.\r\n\r\nJust after sundown, when I chanced to be in a small boat alone, near the\r\npalace, the first of two significant incidents occurred. From the\r\nshadows beneath a house, the head of a swimming man emerged. A _slaan_,\r\nand he gripped the sides of my boat as I drifted.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, Earth man.\" He spoke in the quaint universal language, which I\r\nunderstood, though imperfectly.\r\n\r\nI gazed at him. A bullet-like head, with sullen, blazing eyes. He added:\r\n\"We do not blame you--or your woman, Elza--or the Princess Maida. Have\r\nno fear, but guard yourself well tonight.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I could speak he had sunk into the water, swimming beneath it. I\r\ncould see the phosphorescence of his moving body as he swam away into\r\nthe shadows beyond my line of vision.\r\n\r\nThe other incident came a moment later. As I was gazing down into the\r\nwater I saw a moving metal shape. A triangular metal head, as of a\r\ndiver's cap. More than that, it turned upward; and behind its pane was a\r\nman's face. Unfamiliar to me--yet the face of an Anglo-Saxon man of\r\nEarth! Unmistakable! It stared at me a moment--no more than three or\r\nfour feet below my boat. And then it moved away and vanished.\r\n\r\nI had no opportunity to speak alone with Elza, or Georg or Maida that\r\nentire evening. Always Tarrano was with us. We sat upon the palace\r\nbalcony, we men smoking our arrant-cylinders. Tarrano talked and joked\r\nlike a care-free youth. He was very courteous to Elza, with a holiday\r\nspirit upon him. But his eyes never relaxed; and often I could see him\r\nmeasuring her.\r\n\r\nThe aural lights mounted the sky. The holiday spirit which was on\r\nTarrano was spreading everywhere throughout the city. Boats gayly\r\nbedecked--in such contrast to the funeral cortege of poor Wolfgar just\r\nthe night before--began passing the palace on their way to the festival\r\nwaters. Men and laughing girls thronged them. All with red masks\r\ncovering their faces. The men in grey tight-fitting garments, with\r\nconical caps and flowing plumes; the girls in bright-colored, flowing\r\nrobes, and tresses dangling with flowers entwined in them.\r\n\r\nThe balcony upon which we sat was close above the water level. The\r\nbarges, of every size and kind, glided past. Sometimes the girls would\r\nshower us with flower petals. One small boat paused before us. A girl\r\nstood up to wave at me. Her hand, held up with the loose robe falling\r\nback from her slim white arm, offered me a huge scarlet blossom. The\r\nlove offering. As I hesitated, her laughter rippled out. She tore the\r\nmask from her face. Her red mouth was smiling; her eyes, provocative,\r\nwere dancing with mischief. She tossed the flower into my face as her\r\nescort, with a shout of mock anger, pulled her back to him.\r\n\r\nTheir boats glided on.\r\n\r\nOther boats passed; some with girls gayly strumming instruments of\r\nmusic. One boat with a man strumming, and a girl on a small dais,\r\ndancing with a whirl of black veils. As they came opposite to us another\r\nman in the boat reached up and pushed the girl overboard. She fell into\r\nthe water with a scream of laughter; came up like a mermaid and they\r\npulled her aboard, the veils and her hair clinging to her.\r\n\r\nAt last Tarrano signified that we must go. It was upon me then to make\r\nan effort to draw back, to keep Elza and Maida at the palace with Georg\r\nand me. My heart was heavy with foreboding. Amid all this laughter and\r\nmusic--pleasure of the senses reigning supreme here in the Great City\r\ntonight--I could not miss a sense of impending evil. The _slaans_\r\npropelling the boats were stolid and grim. Not for them, this dalliance.\r\nNot for their women, this music and laughter, these daring costumes to\r\ndisplay their beauty. The _slaan_ women, drab with work, were slinking\r\nabout unnoticed. Often I would see a boat of them slip by, furtively, in\r\nthe shadows. Drab women, watching these beauties, resentful, sullen--and\r\nwith what purpose smouldering in their hearts I could only guess.\r\n\r\nThe very air--to me at least--seemed pregnant with impending evil. I\r\nknow that Georg felt it too. Often I had caught his eye as he regarded\r\nme. Once he started to whisper to me aside, but like a flash, Tarrano\r\nwith his microphonic ear, turned to interrupt us.\r\n\r\nI wanted to stay with Elza at the palace. Suddenly I was afraid of\r\nTarrano, more afraid for Elza than I had ever been. And who, and what\r\nwas this Red Woman? Maida knew, of course. Maida had been very solemn\r\nfor hours; thoughtful, almost grim.\r\n\r\nAnd the _slaan_ in the water who said he did not blame us. He had warned\r\nus to guard ourselves. But how? There were no weapons. On this night of\r\npleasure nothing would have been more incongruous.\r\n\r\nAnd that metal cap in the water with a man's face behind it? An Earth\r\nman of my own race! What did it mean?\r\n\r\nI was perturbed--frightened. But I did not demur when Tarrano led us to\r\nhis flower-bedecked barge. Of what use?\r\n\r\nWe were paired. Georg with Maida; Elza with Tarrano. And I? Tarrano told\r\nme curtly--and with a smile of ironic amusement--that when we reached\r\nthe festival so handsome a man as I would have no trouble engaging the\r\nattention of some Venus maiden.\r\n\r\nOn cushions in the barge we reclined while our _slaans_ poled us along\r\nthe streets. Tarrano was feeding sweets to Elza as though they were gay\r\nyoung lovers. Poor little Elza! She was frightened. Her face was a\r\ntrifle pale, her lips set. But she, too, knew that we were wholly in\r\nTarrano's power, and she made the best of the situation. Sometimes she\r\nwould laugh gayly; but I could not miss the note of fear in it.\r\n\r\nThe progress of our barge was slow. Boats clustered around us, their\r\noccupants pelting us with flowers. A deluge spray of perfume was turned\r\non us--a heavy, exotic scent, almost cloying. It lay redolent on our\r\ngarments for hours.\r\n\r\nPresently Tarrano gave us masks. And long robes for Maida and Elza to\r\ncover the gay holiday dresses they were wearing.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the city a canal had been dug through the hillside. We\r\npassed slowly through it, under archways of dangling colored lights,\r\naround a sharp bend and came upon the Water Festival. And--with\r\nimpending tragedy for the moment forgotten--I gazed for this first time\r\nat such a scene of pleasure and beauty as I had never even imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_Love, Music--and a Warning_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Water Festival! As our barge rounded a bend in the canal, under the\r\narchways of dangling colored lights, the festival spread before us.\r\nInvoluntarily I stood up to gaze. The canal opened into an artificial\r\nlake--a broad circular sheet of water some 800 _helans_[17] in diameter.\r\nSloping hillsides enclosed the lake--hillsides which I saw were terraced\r\nwith huge banks of seats in tiers one above the other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: About 4,000 feet.]\r\n\r\nThe seats were crowded with people. White ribbons of roads gave access\r\nfrom the neighboring countryside for land-surface vehicles, and there\r\nwere stages for the accommodation of air-craft. The rural populace, and\r\npeople from the nearby smaller cities, had gathered to view this\r\nnational spectacle--a million or more of them probably, with their\r\nindividual electrical telescopes for direct distant vision, and small\r\npocket mirrors for that which otherwise would be hidden. A million\r\npeople at least, seated here on these gigantic spreading tiers.\r\n\r\nThe lake itself was thus the stage as it were, of a tremendous arena.\r\nTiny artificial islands dotted the lake--a hundred of them. Islands,\r\nsome no more than a few feet broad; some larger, and in the center of\r\nthe lake, one quite large. All the islands were covered with luxuriant\r\nvegetation. The tiny ones were no more than shadowed nooks of leaves and\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nBetween the islands, crooked lanes of the placid water wended their way\r\nin and out, broadening into occasional lagoons. Bridges crossed the\r\nlanes; archways of lights spanned them at intervals.\r\n\r\nFrom this distance the whole scene was a riot of color and great red and\r\npurple auroral lights of Venus, which at this midnight hour rode the\r\nupper sky, tinged everything vividly. The archway lights were soft rose,\r\nsilver and gold. Some of the tiny islands, from sources hidden were\r\nbathed in bright silver. Others darker, in deep purple and red; still\r\nothers, quite unlighted, dim and shadowed, touched only by the reflected\r\nglow from those near them.\r\n\r\nFrom the main island lights were flashing into the sky; occasional color\r\nbombs mounted and burst, painting the heavens.\r\n\r\nA riot of color. And then as we approached, I became aware of sound and\r\nmovement as well. Music from scores of unseen sources. Music from single\r\nisolated instruments floating softly over the water--lovers playing\r\naccompaniment to their pleading voices; or again, groups of voices--the\r\ncuriously mellow voices of young girls--and, on an island apart, music\r\nfrom an aerial carrying strains from the public _concelan_.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Orchestra.]\r\n\r\nIt was all music of a type unfamiliar to me of Earth. The\r\nintellectuality of our Earth music was missing. This music of Venus was\r\nbuilt upon queer minor strains; unfinished cadences; a rhythm of the\r\nsort we of Earth could never encompass. I listened, and felt the appeal\r\nof my senses. The lavish, abandoned music of barbarism? I had almost\r\nthought it that. Yet it was not. Rather was it decadent. This whole\r\nscene; the color, the music, the heavy cloying scents with which the\r\nnight air was redolent; the warm, sensuous abandonment, felt rather than\r\nmade obvious--it was not barbarism, but decadence. And I realized then\r\nhow close are the two extremes. A reversion to type, merely. And I knew,\r\nthen, that from the pinnacle of civilization which we of Earth had\r\nreached, naught lay before us but this.\r\n\r\nMusic everywhere throughout the festival. And movement. As we floated\r\nout of the canal, passing slowly along one of the broader waterways,\r\nboats and barges slipped past us. Barges crowded with revelers. And the\r\nsmall boats, generally with but a man and a girl--fugitive couples with\r\nthe holiday spirit upon them, seeking the shadowed nooks of islands for\r\ntheir love-making.\r\n\r\nIn one lagoon we came upon such a boat. The man in it--a gay youth in\r\nred and black motley, with the mask fallen from his laughing, perspiring\r\nface--was in its stern, manipulating it with a long, thin paddle. The\r\ngirl was lying face down on cushions in its prow. She was facing\r\nforward, with her long white hair tumbling about her. Around the boat\r\nwere clustered a number of other boats. Each was small, with only a man\r\nin it. A ring of boats, besieging the girl. Our barge paused to watch. A\r\nboat would dash forward, its occupant standing up to thrust it on. But\r\nthe girl, swung to meet it by the efforts of her escort, would turn her\r\ncylinder of _alcholite_[19] upon the attacker. Befuddled, her adversary\r\nwould retreat; or another, momentarily drunk, would fall into the water\r\nto be sobered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: A scent or perfume, highly intoxicating.]\r\n\r\nAll with gay shouts of laughter; until at last the couple were\r\nvictorious and scurried away to their island.\r\n\r\nWe passed on. There were mimic battles often on the islands. A hidden\r\ncouple found out and dragged back. A lone man attacked and pelted with\r\nflowers by a band of marauding girls. A diving platform at one end of an\r\noval lagoon. Girls mounting it to dive into the red-shimmering water,\r\nwhere waiting youths were swimming, and by their prowess in downing\r\nother contenders would seize upon the girls and carry them off to where\r\na barge was loading its passengers for the main island.\r\n\r\nTo this main island we came at last. It was heavily wooded, and indented\r\nwith shallow, placid waterways. In one of them we landed; and amid a\r\nsudden quiet and awe at the presence of Tarrano, we went ashore. Georg\r\nwalking with Maida; Tarrano forcing Elza to hold his arm; and I, beside\r\nElza until Tarrano sternly bade me walk behind.\r\n\r\nWe were masked, but the revelers knew us. Amid the throng with which the\r\nisland was packed, we moved slowly forward toward a gay pavilion which\r\nwas in the center of the grove. Music came from it--a broad, roofed-over\r\npavilion with a dancing floor in the depression of its center space, and\r\ntiers of balconies above it.\r\n\r\nWithin the pavilion, where the air was heavy with the smell of wine,\r\narrant-smoke, intoxicating whiffs of surreptitiously used\r\nalcholite-cylinders and sensuous perfumes upon the garments of the\r\nwomen--in here, the throng pressed around us; the dancers stopped to\r\ngaze; the music momentarily hushed; the spectators on the\r\nbalconies--girls reclining on cushions with young gallants seated beside\r\nthem with trays of food and drink--all turned to crane down at us.\r\n\r\n\"Honor to the Master Tarrano!\"\r\n\r\nA girl shouted it. A murmur of applause swept about us.\r\n\r\nAbruptly Tarrano removed his mask. His face, which had been concealed,\r\nshowed with the flush of pleasure and his lips were parted with a smile\r\nof gratification and triumph. But, as the red silk mask was doffed,\r\nanother took its place--the mask of imperturbability--that grave,\r\ninscrutable look with which he always masked his real emotions.\r\n\r\n\"Honor to the Master Tarrano!\"\r\n\r\nTarrano raised his hand; his quiet, calm voice carried throughout the\r\nsilent room.\r\n\r\n\"There is no Master here tonight. No Master--only the Mistress of Love.\r\nLet us honor her. Let _her_ rule us all--tonight.\"\r\n\r\nFor just an instant his gaze seemed to linger upon Elza; then he gravely\r\nreplaced his red mask. Applause swept the room; the music started again.\r\nThe lights overhead began whirling their kaleidoscope of colors down\r\nupon the dancers.\r\n\r\nWe took our places in a canopied enclosure upon the first balcony, some\r\ntwenty feet above the dance floor. Tarrano refused the cushions; he\r\nplaced Elza deferentially upon them, and spread food and drink and\r\nsweet-meats before her. Near them sat Georg and Maida. I would have sat\r\nbetween Elza and Georg, but Tarrano pulled me away from them.\r\n\r\n\"You are wanted below.\" He said it very softly, for my ears alone; but\r\nthrough his mask I could see his eyes blazing at me.\r\n\r\n\"They are diving into the pool outside--cannot you hear them, Jac\r\nHallen?\" Impatience came to his voice; in truth, I must have been\r\nstaring at him witless. \"Maidens out there, Jac Hallen, who are seeking\r\nhandsome youths like yourself for escort. Must I speak plainly? You are\r\nnot wanted here. Go!\"\r\n\r\n\"I----\"\r\n\r\n\"Another word will be your last.\" His voice was still almost\r\nemotionless, but I did not miss the gesture of his hand to his belt.\r\n\"You had best obey, Jac Hallen.\"\r\n\r\nI was hardly so witless as not to realize the truth of his admonition. I\r\nturned away; and with all the laughter and movement around us, I think\r\nthat Georg, Maida and Elza did not see me go.\r\n\r\nFor the space of an hour or more, I stood alone on the lower floor of\r\nthe pavilion, watching the balcony where Tarrano and the others sat.\r\nStood there alone, feeling helpless and with my heart heavy with\r\nforeboding. Beneath my grey robe I was dressed in holiday fashion of the\r\nGreat City--beribboned and gartered, with feathers at my scarlet\r\nshoulders for all the world like a male _nada_.[20] My red mask I kept\r\non, and folded my cloak around me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: A popinjay--fop.]\r\n\r\nThe dance floor was crowded. I saw now that it was cut into small\r\ncircles marked with black--circles in diameter about the length of a\r\nman. At intervals--perhaps five minutes apart--a signal in the music\r\ncaused each of the dancing couples to select a circle and to dance\r\nwholly within it. And then one of the circles, by mechanical device, was\r\nraised into the air above all the others. The couple on it, thus\r\nprominent, danced at their best, to be judged by Tarrano for a prize.\r\n\r\nFor an hour I stood there. I could see Elza plainly. She had removed her\r\nmask. Her face was flushed, her lips laughing. Once, in a chance\r\nsilence, her shout of applause rang out. The quality of abandonment in\r\nit turned me cold. Did I see Tarrano's hand move back to his belt? Was\r\nhe intoxicating her? Then I saw Maida make a gesture--wave something\r\nfrom beneath her cloak at Elza. A scent to sober her? It seemed so, for\r\nElza looked confused; and I saw Maida flash her a look of warning.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, from an alcove near me, a group of girls rushed out. Their\r\ncloaks and white veils fell from them as they came my way--laughing as\r\nthey ran for the doorway leading outside to the pool. I was in their way\r\nand they bumped into me; one of them gripped me. I tried to jerk loose,\r\nbut she clung. A slim girl, enveloped in her long, white tresses. Her\r\neyes laughed at me; her red mouth went up alluringly to my face.\r\n\r\n\"I love you--_you_, Jac Hallen.\" Her arms wound about my neck as she\r\nclung. I was trying to cast her off when her fingers lifted a corner of\r\nmy mask.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid you were _not_ Jac Hallen.\" Her whisper was relieved, and\r\nit had suddenly turned swift and vehement. \"I am sister to Maida--my\r\nname, Alda. I am to warn you. When Tarrano dances with the Red\r\nWoman--when they go up on the raised circle--_you drop to the floor_!\r\nYou understand? Keep down, or the rays might strike you! But be here,\r\ninside, and watch. And _afterward_, go quickly to join the Princess and\r\nyour Elza. You understand?\"\r\n\r\nShe clung to me, with her slim, white body pressed against my cloak. To\r\nanyone watching us, she would have seemed merely making love. Her eyes\r\nwere provocative; her lips mocking me. But she was whispering, _\"Drop to\r\nthe floor when Tarrano dances with the Red Woman--drop or the rays might\r\nstrike you!\"_\r\n\r\nAnother girl was plucking at me from behind. Alda shouted: \"You shall\r\nnot have him!\" and cast me off. But I heard her whisper, _\"Come outside\r\nfor a moment--then come back!\"_--and then, aloud, she cried to the other\r\ngirl, \"You shall not have him! He is coming to watch me dive and swim! I\r\nam more beautiful than you--you could not win him from me!\"\r\n\r\nI let them drag me out into the grove by the scented pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n_Revolution!_\r\n\r\n\r\nI realize that I am, by nature, not overly observant; and in those\r\nmoments, when I stood out there beside the pool, I think I came most\r\nforcibly to appreciate how little I habitually observe that which is not\r\nreadily apparent. An incident now occurred to bring it home to me; and,\r\nquite suddenly, a score of things which I had seen during the past two\r\nhours at the festival were made plain.\r\n\r\nMusic, feasting, merry-making, love! In the midst of it all, an\r\nundercurrent of events was flowing. Unseen events--but I had partly seen\r\nsome of them, and now, at last, I began to understand.\r\n\r\nIn the main hall of the pavilion, midway to its roof, a line of mirrors\r\nwas placed along the wall facing Tarrano. A hundred small mirrors, side\r\nby side. On them were moving images of what was taking place in\r\ndifferent parts of the festival--so that Tarrano and the others might\r\nsee the merry-making, not only in the pavilion, but elsewhere, as well.\r\nIt was interesting to watch the mirrors--and sometimes amusing. The\r\nscene of a gay battle of boats in a nearby lagoon; the diving girls in\r\nthe pools; a view from the sky above of the whole scene; another,\r\nlooking upward at the color bombs bursting overhead; a bridge on which a\r\ndozen girls were besieged by as many men, who sought to climb upward\r\nfrom their boats underneath, flowers for missiles, and the alcholite\r\nfumes which held off the attackers, or, perchance, caused a girl to fall\r\ninto the water, to be instantly captured.\r\n\r\nOther mirrors, eavesdropping upon the secluded islands, making public,\r\nfor the amusement of the spectators in the pavilion, the furtive\r\nlove-making of couples who fancied themselves alone.\r\n\r\nAll this I had seen. And now I remembered that, occasionally, a mirror\r\nhad gone dark, and then turned suddenly to a scene somewhere else. I\r\nunderstood now. Quiet incidents against Tarrano were in progress. The\r\nmirrors were being tampered with, that none of these events should be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nThere were, scattered throughout the festival, fully a hundred men of\r\nTarrano's guard. Some of them I knew by their uniforms; others were\r\nconcealed by red masks and robes like myself. When first we entered the\r\npavilion, some twenty or thirty of them had been there with us. But many\r\nof them did not stay; and now I remembered that, one by one, I had seen\r\nthem slip away, lured by the slim, white shapes of girls who came from\r\nthe pool to beguile them.\r\n\r\nI realized now that these girls of the scented pool were very possibly\r\nall working for Maida. Most daring of all at the festival, these fifty\r\ngirls who now disported themselves in the water at my feet. All\r\nbeautiful, none beyond the first flush of earliest maturity. Slight,\r\ngrey-white nymphs, laughing as they discarded their hampering veils,\r\ntossing their white hair as they plunged into the shimmering pool.\r\nSeemingly the most seductive, most abandoned of everyone.\r\n\r\nYet, as I stood there, I saw three of them climb from the water and,\r\nwith gay shouts, rush into the pavilion. Back in a moment; and with them\r\na flushed man--one of Tarrano's guards--flushed and flattered at their\r\nattention. His hat was gone, his robe disheveled, as the girls fought\r\nfor him. They stopped quite close to me; and I saw that one of them was\r\nAlda.\r\n\r\n\"You shall not have him!\" she shouted to her companions. \"He is mine! He\r\nloves me--none of you!\"\r\n\r\nFrom her thick hair I saw her draw a tiny cylinder, wave it in the man's\r\nface. And, with another laugh, she flung her arms around his neck and\r\nfell with him into the water. I watched the splash and the ripples where\r\nthey went down. In a moment, the girl came up--_but the man did not_. In\r\nall the confusion of the crowded pool, it was not very obvious.\r\n\r\nA dozen, perhaps, of such incidents, which now, that I was alert to\r\nunderstand, were apparent. The mirrors might have shown some of\r\nthem--but the mirrors always went dark just in time.\r\n\r\nTarrano's guards were disappearing. And now I saw a _slaan_ skulking in\r\nthe shadows of the shrubbery nearby. And I noticed, too, that this pool\r\nat my feet had a stream flowing outward from it--a waterway connecting\r\nit with the main lake. And I remembered the Earth man in sub-sea garb\r\nwhom I had seen. Were there many Earth men down here in the water?\r\n\r\n_\"When Tarrano dances with the Red Woman, you drop to the floor.\"_\r\n\r\nI remembered Alda's words and her admonition, \"Be inside the pavilion.\"\r\nAnd presently I caught her glance as she was poised for a dive--and it\r\nseemed directing me to leave.\r\n\r\nWrapped in my drab cloak, I went back inside. The merry-making had\r\nincreased; the place was more crowded than ever. I had been there but a\r\nmoment when a gong sounded. The music stopped. In the hush Tarrano, on\r\nthe balcony, rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"The tri-night hour[21] is here.\" He removed his mask; his face was\r\ngrave, but a slight smile curved his thin lips. \"Let us see ourselves\r\nnow as we really are.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Half-way between midnight and dawn.]\r\n\r\nHe slipped his robe from his shoulders and stood in his festive costume.\r\nFor so slight a man, I was surprised at the strength of him. Bands of\r\ngold-metal encircled his naked torso; a broad girdle of purple cloth\r\nhung from his waist. His bare limbs were lean and straight; sandals of\r\nred were on his feet. And a band about his forehead with a single\r\nfeather in it.\r\n\r\nYet, for it all, he was no male _nada_, but every inch a man. Gravely\r\nsmiling, as, with a gesture, he bade them all discard their masks and\r\nrobes. From overhead the colored lights turned white. And in the glare,\r\nthe robes and masks were dropped. Costumes grotesque, some of them;\r\nothers symbolic; others merely beautiful. Vivid colors. Dancers daringly\r\ngarbed, with whom the girls from the pool now mingled.\r\n\r\nA moment of breathless silence; then ripples of applause from the\r\nspectators. And then the music and the dancing went on.\r\n\r\nBarbaric costumes? Some frankly imitated the bygone ages of Venus, Mars\r\nand Earth. But the spirit that prompted them was decadence--nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nPresently, as I stood unmasked in my effeminate garb, holding myself\r\naloof from the girls who would have carried me off to the dancing floor,\r\nI saw the roof of the pavilion roll back. The open sky spread above us.\r\nAnd from it came down an effulgence of silver light, from a source high\r\noverhead. It bathed us all in its soft radiance; and, simultaneously,\r\nthe lights in the pavilion went out. A single golden shaft rested on\r\nTarrano. Elza, Georg and Maida were still there. In the golden light I\r\ncould see them quite plainly--could see that Elza was flushed with\r\nsuppressed excitement. Not the alcholite fumes now. Georg, too, seemed\r\nvery alert. And Maida. There was, indeed, a tenseness about them all--an\r\nair of vague expectancy which made my heart beat faster as I realized\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWas Tarrano totally unaware of what was about to happen? Was he unaware\r\nof this hidden, lurking menace to him, which now, to me, was so obvious?\r\nI could not believe that; yet, he was imperturbable, solemn as ever.\r\n\r\nA shaft of golden light upon Tarrano. The darkened chamber. The silver\r\nradiance coming down upon us in a shaft from the sky. A hush lay upon\r\nthe room. The music had ceased; now it began again, very soft, ethereal.\r\nEveryone in the room was gazing upward. From high overhead in the silver\r\nshaft a shape appeared, slowly floating downward. A woman's figure. It\r\ncame down, supported by what mechanical or scientific device I never\r\nknew. It seemed floating unsupported.\r\n\r\nWithin the pavilion, suspended in mid-air, I saw that it was a woman in\r\nfilmy red veils. Poised on tip-toe in the air. Arms outstretched, with\r\nthe red veils hanging from them like wings. A woman fully matured. White\r\nhair piled in coils on her head, with a huge, scarlet blossom in it. A\r\nface, somewhat heavy of feature, powdered white; with glowing eyes, dark\r\nlidded; and a scarlet mouth. A face, an expression in the smouldering\r\neyes, the full lips half parted--a face and an expression that seemed\r\nthe very incarnation of all that is sensuous in humans. The Red Woman!\r\nThe living symbol of all that lay beneath this festive merry-making.\r\n\r\nThe Red Woman! For a moment she hovered there before us. A shaft of red\r\nlight now came down from above. It caught her, bathed her in its lurid\r\nglow. On her face came a look of triumph, and a leer almost insolent, as\r\nslowly she began fluttering through the air toward Tarrano. He rose to\r\nmeet her. Whispered something aside to Elza.\r\n\r\nClose before him, the Red Woman hovered. And now a circle-dais from the\r\nfloor came up to her. She rested upon it; began a slow, sinuous dance;\r\none by one loosening the veils; the red light deepening until it painted\r\nher body red in lieu of the draperies.\r\n\r\nNo frivolous mockery here. Intense, smouldering eyes as she held her\r\ngaze on Tarrano's face and slowly raised her arms in invitation to him.\r\nAt her gesture, he rose to his feet. Yet I knew he was not under her\r\nspell, for his lips were smiling, bantering.\r\n\r\nBut he rose obediently, and stepped from the balcony to the upraised\r\ndais. Around his neck the Red Woman wound her arms--white arms stained\r\nred by the lurid light.\r\n\r\nA flash! I did not see from whence it came; but within me some\r\nsubconscious impulse made me drop to the floor. The light from overhead\r\nwas out. Momentary darkness. A woman's scream of terror. Then others.\r\nThe sound of running feet; bodies falling. Panic in the crowd. Confusion\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nThen light from somewhere came on. People were tramping me. I fought\r\nthem off, climbed to my feet. On the dais the Red Woman lay dead.\r\nHuddled in a heap, with a brand of black searing her forehead. _Slaans_\r\nwere leaping about the room--huge, half-naked men--brandishing primitive\r\nknives. Flashing steel, buried in the backs of the fleeing merry-makers.\r\nOther figures--Earth men they seemed--gripping the _slaans_, staying\r\ntheir murderous fury.\r\n\r\nTarrano? I did not see him at first. The air above the floor of the\r\npavilion was full of snapping sparks--a battle of some unknown rays. The\r\nmirrors were shattered: glass from them was falling about me. Then, in\r\nthe semi-gloom on the balcony, Tarrano's figure materialized. Invisible\r\nbefore, the hostile rays upon it now made it apparent. But Tarrano\r\nseemed proof against the rays. I could see he was unharmed; and as he\r\nstood there, no doubt using a curved, duplicating beam, the like of\r\nwhich I have seen used in warfare, the image of him seemed to shift.\r\nThen it doubled--two images, one here, one further down the balcony.\r\nThen still others--appearing and disappearing, always in different\r\nplaces, until no one could have said where the man himself really was. A\r\ndozen Tarranos, each enveloped in hostile sparks, each with his face\r\ngrinning at us in mockery.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, I heard Georg's voice shout above the din: \"Elza! Elza is\r\ngone!\"\r\n\r\nThe images of Tarrano faded. He, too, was gone.\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw Maida on the balcony, standing with upraised arms. Her\r\nvoice rang out.\r\n\r\n\"Down with Tarrano! Death to Tarrano!\" And then her pleading command:\r\n\r\n\"_Slaans_, no more bloodshed! Be loyal, _slaans_, to your Princess\r\nMaida!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Georg calling: \"Loyalty, everyone, to your Princess Maida. Loyalty!\r\nLoyalty!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n_First Retreat_\r\n\r\n\r\nI must recount now what Elza later told me, going back to those moments\r\nwhen Elza sat upon the balcony watching Tarrano and the Red Woman. The\r\nsignificance of what had been transpiring at the Water Festival was not\r\nclear to Elza; she did not know what was impending, but as she sat there\r\nwith Tarrano beside her, a sense of danger oppressed her. Danger which\r\nlay like a weight upon her heart. Yet several times she found herself\r\nlaughing--hilarious; and from Maida's warning glance, and the steadying\r\nodor which Maida wafted to her, she knew that Tarrano was using the\r\nalcholite fumes to intoxicate her.\r\n\r\nThe Red Woman and Tarrano were upon the dais. There came a flash; then\r\ndarkness. Elza went cold with terror. She sat stiff and silent, while\r\naround her surged that turmoil of confusion. The smell of chemicals was\r\nin the air; her skin prickled as with a million tiny needles where\r\nsparks now began to snap against it.\r\n\r\nHow long she crouched there, or what was happening, Elza did not know.\r\nBut presently she heard Tarrano's voice in her ear.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Lady Elza, I must get you out of this.\" In the darkness his face\r\nglowed wraith-like. Then she felt his hand upon her arm.\r\n\r\n\"Come, we must leave here. I would not have you endangered.\"\r\n\r\nWith a haste and roughness that belied the calm solicitude of his words,\r\nhe pulled her to her feet. There was light in the pavilion now. Elza saw\r\ndimly the turmoil of struggling figures; and then she saw the scene\r\nduplicated--saw it shift and sway in crazy fashion. Though she did not\r\nknow it, she was looking out along the curved rays which Tarrano was\r\nsending from them. Sparks were snapping everywhere. A second image of\r\nTarrano appeared to the left of her--she saw it in a mirror nearby--yet\r\nhe was at her right, gripping her arm.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry, Lady Elza.\"\r\n\r\nShe found herself being dragged along the balcony; stumbling over a body\r\nlying there; feeling a surge of heat and electric disturbance beat\r\nagainst her face. Then Tarrano had her in his arms, carrying her. She\r\nheard him curse as a sudden wave of fire seemed to strike them--hostile\r\nrays bringing a numbness to muscles and brain. Tarrano was fumbling at\r\nhis belt; and through a shower of sparks he stumbled onward with his\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nElza's senses were fading. Vaguely she was conscious that Tarrano was\r\ncarrying her down an incline to the ground. Grateful, cool air. Stars\r\noverhead. Trees; foliage; shimmering water. The screams and confusion of\r\nthe pavilion growing fainter....\r\n\r\nWhen Elza regained consciousness, she was lying in the bottom of a\r\nlittle boat, Tarrano beside her.\r\n\r\n\"So? You have awakened? We are quite safe, Lady Elza.\"\r\n\r\nShe and Tarrano were alone in the boat. It was long and very narrow,\r\nwith its sides no more than a foot above the water. Tarrano sat at its\r\nchemical mechanism. A boat familiar to us of Earth. A small\r\nchemical-electric generator. The explosion of water in a little tank,\r\nwith the resultant gases ejected through a small pipe projecting under\r\nthe surface at its stern. The boat swept forward smoothly, rapidly and\r\nalmost silently, with a stream of the gas bubbles coming to the surface\r\nin its wake.\r\n\r\n\"Quite safe, Lady Elza.\"\r\n\r\nShe saw that Tarrano's face was blackened with grime. His garments were\r\nburned, and hers were also. He was disheveled, but his manner was as\r\nimperturbable as ever. He made her comfortable on the cushions in the\r\nboat; drew a robe closer around her against the rush of the night air.\r\n\r\nElza was unhurt. She saw now, with clarifying senses, that they were\r\nplying along a narrow river. Banks of foliage on each side; the auroral\r\nlights in the sky; occasionally on the hillsides along the river, the\r\ndim outlines of a house.\r\n\r\nIt was all a trifle unreal--like looking through a sunglass that was\r\ndarkened--for around the boat hung always a vague pall of gloom. Tarrano\r\nspoke of it.\r\n\r\n\"Our isolation barrage. It is very weak, but the best I can\r\ncontrive. From these hills the naked eye, now at night could hardly\r\npenetrate it.... A precaution, for they will be searching for us\r\nperhaps.... Ah!...\"\r\n\r\nA white search-ray sprang from a house at the top of a hill nearby. It\r\nleaped across the dark countryside, swept the water--which at that point\r\nhad broadened into a lagoon--and landed upon the boat. It was a light\r\nstrong enough to penetrate the barrage--the boat was disclosed to\r\nobservers in the house. But Tarrano raised a small metal projector. A\r\ndull-red beam sprang from it and mingled with the other. A surge of\r\nsparks; then Tarrano's red beam conquered. It absorbed the white light.\r\nAnd Tarrano's beam was curved. It lay over the lake in a huge bow,\r\nbending far out to one side. Yet its other end fell upon the hostile\r\nhouse. The white search-ray from the house was submerged, bent outward\r\nwith Tarrano's beam. From the house, the observer could only gaze along\r\nthis curved light. He saw the image of the boat--not where the boat\r\nreally was--but as though the ray were straight.\r\n\r\nElza, staring with her heart in her throat, saw a ball of yellow fire\r\nmount from the house. It swung into the air in a slow, lazy parabola,\r\ncame down and dropped into the lake. But it fell where the marksman saw\r\nthe boat, a safe distance to one side. A ball of fire dropping into the\r\nwater, exploding the water all around it for a distance of a dozen feet.\r\nLike a cascade, the water mounted.\r\n\r\nTarrano chuckled. \"A very bad marksman.\"\r\n\r\nOther bombs came. It turns me cold when I think how orders like this\r\ncould have come from the Great City--these bombs which had they found\r\ntheir mark would have killed Tarrano, but at the expense of the life of\r\nElza. They did not find their mark. Tarrano continually changed the\r\ncurve of his beam. The image of the boat shifted. A few moments only;\r\nand riding the waves of the bomb-tossed water, they rounded a bend, back\r\ninto the narrow river and were beyond range.\r\n\r\nTarrano snapped off his ray. \"Quite safe, Lady Elza. Do not be alarmed.\r\nI doubt if they will locate us again. They should be very busy now in\r\nthe Great City. I'm surprised they could even think to notify this\r\nStation we have just passed.\"\r\n\r\nWe were indeed very busy in the Great City during those hours, as you\r\nshall presently hear.\r\n\r\nTarrano and Elza were not again disturbed. How far they went in the boat\r\nshe does not know, but at last they landed in a sheltered cove. An air\r\nvehicle was there. Tarrano transferred Elza to it, and in a moment more\r\nthey were aloft.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle was little more than an oblong platform, with a low railing.\r\nA platform of a substance resembling _glascite-transparent_; and with a\r\n_glascite_ shield V-shaped in front to break the rush of wind and yet\r\ngive vision. A mechanism, not of radio-power, but of gravity like the\r\nspace-flyers. Such platforms had been, but were no longer in use on\r\nEarth. Elza had never seen one. It was a new experience for her, this\r\nflying with nothing above one, nothing to the side, or underneath save\r\nthat transparent substance. To her it was like floating, and at times\r\nfalling headlong through the air.\r\n\r\nThey rose no more than a thousand feet at first, and then swept parallel\r\nwith the ground. At a tremendous speed; even at this height the forests\r\nseemed moving backward as the ground moves beneath a surface vehicle.\r\n\r\nDark, somber forests of luxuriant tropical vegetation. It was now\r\nnearing dawn; the auroral lights were dropping low in the sky; the great\r\nVenus Cross of Dawn was rising, its first two stars already above the\r\nline of hills to one side.\r\n\r\nThen the sky out there flushed red; a limb of the glorious Sun of Venus\r\ncame up. A new day. And even though the air was warm, within Elza was\r\nashiver.\r\n\r\n\"It is very wonderful to me, my Elza, this being alone with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat beside her, gazing at her with his calm, impenetrable eyes. It\r\nwas near noon of that day following their escape from the Water\r\nFestival. They had flown possibly two thousand miles. The Sun had risen,\r\nbut after a time--since their enormous speed and change of latitude had\r\naffected the angle at which they viewed it--the Sun now was hanging\r\nalmost level, not far above the horizon.\r\n\r\nBeneath the platform--a mile below now--lay a tumbled waste of naked\r\ncrags. The borders of the Cold Country! Tarrano's stronghold! The\r\nbirthplace of his dreams of universal conquest.\r\n\r\nElza was staring downward. A barren waste. Rocks bare of verdure. Grey,\r\nwith red ore staining them. A desolation of empty rock, with grey flat\r\nshadows. And far ahead, the broken, serrated ranks of mountains with\r\nrocky peaks, white-hooded with the snow upon their summits. The Cold\r\nCountry. Bleak; forbidding.\r\n\r\nThis brittle air was cold; yet Elza and Tarrano were warm. Before the\r\nplatform, a ray darted--a low-powered ray of a type that was to be so\r\ngreat a factor in the warfare into which we were all so soon to be\r\nplunged. It heated the air, so that the platform rushed always through a\r\nwind that was balmy.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\" Elza looked up to meet Tarrano's steady gaze.\r\n\r\n\"I said it is wonderful to be thus alone with you, my Elza.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\" She looked away.\r\n\r\nHe persisted; but his voice was gentle and earnest. \"Soon we will be at\r\nmy home, Lady Elza. And now--there are some things I would like to say\r\nwhile I have the opportunity.... You will listen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said; and tried to keep from him the trembling within her.\r\n\"I'll listen, of course.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"Thank you.... My Elza, you have heard me talk of conquering\r\nthe world. My dream--my destiny. It will come to pass, of course. Yet--\"\r\nA smile pulled at his lips. \"Do you know, my Elza, what you and I are\r\ndoing now?\"\r\n\r\nShe stared, and he did not wait for her to answer.\r\n\r\n\"We're making my first retreat. I wonder if you can realize how I feel,\r\nhaving to admit that? Tarrano in retreat!... Our escape from Venia?\r\nPouf! That was a jest. I was there on Earth merely to get you, and the\r\nBrende model. I had no thought of conquering the Earth just then. I\r\naccomplished my two purposes--and left.... It was not a retreat, merely\r\na planned departure.\r\n\r\n\"But this, my Elza, is very different. I did not wish to do what I am\r\ndoing now. I had planned--I had thought, had actually hoped, that I\r\nmight maintain myself in the Great City. You see, I tell you this,\r\nlittle girl, because--well I am a lonely man. I walk alone--and because\r\nI am human--it does me good to have someone to talk to. I had hoped I\r\nmight maintain myself in the Great City. Last night--at the start of the\r\nWater Festival--I began to realize it was impossible. I should have\r\nenlisted the _Rhaals_--the men of science, Elza. But I had no time, and\r\nthey are very aloof. I could have won them to me had I tried.\" He\r\nshrugged. \"I must confess I was over-confident of my strength--the\r\nstrength of my position. The _Rhaals_ stayed out of the affair--stayed\r\nin their own city, which has always been their policy. That was what I\r\nexpected, but now I see I should have had their aid. I did--well what I\r\ndid to guard against the unhappy outcome you witnessed--what I did was\r\nwrongly planned. You see, I take all the blame. I alone am responsible\r\nfor my destiny. There are some who in defeat cry bitterly, 'Luck! That\r\ncursed luck was against me!' Not so! Leadership is not a matter of luck.\r\nDestiny is what you make it. You see?\r\n\r\n\"And so now I am making my first retreat. A set-back, nothing more. I\r\nshall launch my forces from the City of Ice, instead of marshalling them\r\nfrom the Central State as I had planned. And Mars is still mine. I still\r\ncontrol Mars, little Elza.... A set-back just now--and it bothers me. It\r\nhurts my pride--and as you know, my Elza, Tarrano is very proud.\"\r\n\r\nShe had been listening to him, her fingers plucking idly at her robe. He\r\nbent closer to her; his voice turned tender. \"I was thinking that\r\nperhaps--just perhaps you would scorn Tarrano in his triumphs, you might\r\nfeel differently toward him now--in his first retreat. Do you?\"\r\n\r\nShe forced her eyes up to his again. \"I'm--sorry--from your viewpoint, I\r\nmean--that things are going wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled gently. \"You are very conservative, Lady Elza. You want very\r\nmuch to avoid hypocrisy, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said frankly. \"You could hardly expect me to be sorry at your\r\ndefeat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Defeat?\" He rasped out the word, and his laugh was harsh. \"You are too\r\noptimistic. Defeat? Things going wrong? That is not so. A slight\r\nset-back. A strategic retreat--and in a week I will have regained more\r\nthan I have lost.... Oh, Lady Elza! I who would now--and always--be so\r\ngentle with you--why we are almost quarreling! That is not right. For\r\nthe lives of a thousand of my servants, I would not have used that tone\r\nto you just now. Forgive me....\r\n\r\n\"I was saying, my Elza--could not you feel more kindly to me now. A\r\nlittle hope from those gentle eyes of yours--a little word from those\r\nred lips--a word of hope for what some day might be for us--you and\r\nme--\"\r\n\r\nShe dared to try and turn the subject. \"You mentioned the Brende\r\nmodel--where is it? Have you it in the Cold Country?\"\r\n\r\nHe frowned. \"Yes. And I will use it--for you and me alone. You've always\r\nknown that, haven't you? Just for you and me, my Elza.\" He took her\r\nhand. \"Won't you try and love me--just a trifle?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not move. \"I--don't know.\" Then she faced him squarely. \"I do\r\nnot love you, Tarrano.\" Something in his eyes--a quality of pleading; a\r\nwistful smile upon his lips--suddenly struck her as pathetic. Strange\r\nand queerly pathetic that such a man as he should be reduced to\r\nwistfulness. Emotion swept her. Not love. A feeling of sympathy; a\r\nwomanly desire to lighten his sorrow; to sympathize and yet to withhold\r\nfrom him the happiness he sought.\r\n\r\n\"I do not love you, Tarrano. But I do respect you. And I am sorry--\"\r\n\r\n\"Respect! I have told you I can command that from everyone. But\r\nlove--your love--\"\r\n\r\n\"I would give it if I could, Tarrano.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--you're trying to love me--and cannot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean--Oh, I don't know what I mean, save that I do not love you yet.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"I think you speak the truth when you say you do not know\r\nwhat you mean. Your love! If I had it, I should know that I would have\r\nit always. But--having it not--\" He was very sincere, but his smile\r\nbroadened. \"Having it not, my Elza, there is no power in all the heavens\r\nthat can tell me how to get it. It may be born in a moment from now--or\r\nnever. Who can tell?\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent; and after a moment, he added: \"Enough of this. I would\r\nask you just one thing. You are not afraid of me, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said; and at that moment she meant it.\r\n\r\n\"I would not have you ever be afraid, Lady Elza. Love is not conceived\r\nby fear. And you must know I could never force my love upon you. For if\r\nI did--I should withhold forever the birth of this love of yours which\r\nis all I seek--this love I am trying to breathe into life.... Enough!\"\r\n\r\nHe did not mention the subject again. For hours--eating what meager\r\nstock of tabloid food with which their vehicle was provisioned--they\r\nflew onward. Rising now to top the line of jagged mountains. Over them\r\nthe platform swept. In the crisp air the snow down there gleamed\r\nblue-white; the ice with an age-old look filled the valleys between the\r\npeaks.\r\n\r\nThe arctic! It was nothing like the Polar regions of Earth. Stark\r\ndesolation. A naked land seemingly upheaved by some gigantic cataclysm\r\nof nature, lying tumbled and broken where it had fallen in convulsive\r\nagony; and then congealed forever in a grip of ice.\r\n\r\nThe Sun hung level as the vehicle advanced. In these latitudes it would\r\nswing side-wise in a slow, low arc, to dip again below the horizon and\r\nvanish. Here in the Cold Country it was morning of the Long Day. Summer!\r\n\r\nOn over the crags and glaciers Tarrano guided their frail flying\r\nplatform. Houses occasionally showed now--huts of ice, congealed\r\ndwellings, blue-white in the flat sunlight.\r\n\r\nAnd then at last, over the horizon came the ramparts of a city. The City\r\nof Ice! The size of it--the evidences of civilization here in this\r\nbrittle land of deadly cold--made Elza gasp with wonderment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n_Attack on the Palace_\r\n\r\n\r\nI must take you back now to the Water Festival and the events in the\r\nGreat City which followed it. _Slaans_ in murderous frenzy were plunging\r\nthrough the throng of erstwhile revelers. Maida could not quell them.\r\nThe revolt which she had started against Tarrano seemed now a\r\nself-created monster to destroy us all.\r\n\r\nBut there were Earth men among us. A hundred of them, no more. They had\r\ncome from Washington that same day; had landed, I learned later,\r\nsecretly near the Great City, sent with our Earth Council's plans to\r\ncommunicate with Maida. Beneath the water, coming individually, they had\r\nentered the festival; and helping Maida's girls (the diving girls whom I\r\nhad encountered) they had made away with most of Tarrano's guards.\r\n\r\nIn those first moments of frenzy, I got to the balcony--joined Maida and\r\nGeorg. Elza was gone! My heart went cold, but in those hurried, frantic\r\nmoments, grave disaster as it was, I did not dwell upon it.\r\n\r\n\"We must get away--back to the palace!\" Georg exclaimed as I joined\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Earth men on the main floor were holding the _slaans_ partially in\r\ncheck. Bodies were lying in a welter--I shall not describe it. Then\r\nabruptly, upon a table a huge _slaan_ leaped--his garments blood-stained\r\nfrom his victims, a blade of dripping steel in his hands. He shouted\r\nabove the tumult--words not in the universal language, but in the\r\ndialect of the _slaans_. His command carried throughout the building.\r\nOther _slaans_ took it up; we could hear it echoed outside as others\r\nshouted it over the waters.\r\n\r\nThe bloodshed abruptly ceased. The _slaans_ leaped away from the Earth\r\nmen, who were glad enough to let them go--rushed for the archways of the\r\npavilion. Outside, we could hear the water splashing. Swimmers--and\r\nboats scurrying off. Then comparative silence. The scream of a _slaan_\r\nwoman in the grove nearby, still desiring vengeance; the groans of the\r\ndying at our feet; the hiss and splutter of weapons discarded, with\r\ncircuits still connected. And over it all, the great whine of a danger\r\nwhistle, which some distant official had plugged.... A lull. And around\r\nus lay strewn stark tragedy where a few moments before had been festive\r\nmerry-making. A crimson scene, with the body of the Red Woman lying like\r\na symbol in its midst....\r\n\r\nWithin an hour we were back at the palace. The whole city was seething.\r\nBoats and lights were everywhere. Control of everything seemed lost.\r\nWarning signals shrilled in crazy fashion. Public mirrors were dark, or\r\nturned to places and time wholly irrelevant.\r\n\r\nIn the palace itself we soon secured a semblance of order. Maida's girls\r\nwere here, with wet veils and long dank tresses clinging to their sleek\r\nbodies. Lips painted alluring red. But eyes which now were solemn and\r\ngrim. Their demeanor alert and business-like. Unconscious of themselves\r\nthey moved about the palace, executing Maida's orders.\r\n\r\nA dozen or so of Maida's personal retainers were here--and most of the\r\nEarth men. Keen-eyed young men of the Washington Headquarters Staff. One\r\nof them--Tomm Aften by name, a ruddy, blue-eyed fellow--was in command.\r\nHe stayed close by Georg and me.\r\n\r\nThe city was seething. But out of the chaos was coming a comparatively\r\norderly menace. We could sense it at first; and then in a few brief\r\nminutes so swift that we had no time to prepare--the menace became\r\nobvious and was at hand.\r\n\r\nThe _slaans_ had withdrawn from the festival for a greater, more\r\norganized effort. Their revolt against Tarrano in which Maida had\r\njoined, was bigger, more deep-rooted than a mere revolt. It was against\r\nMaida herself. Trickery of the downtrodden _slaans_ against the ruling\r\nclass. Against the old order of government. Even against the _Rhaals_,\r\nwho in their distant city were all-powerful, but who obeyed the laws and\r\ntook no part in anything.\r\n\r\nRevolution! From down the waterways of streets which converged into the\r\nbroad lagoon before the palace, boats began arriving. Boats crowded with\r\n_slaans_. Disheveled, unkempt men and women with primitive weapons of\r\nsteel and wire brandished aloft. They surged into the lagoon. A\r\nmurderous, frenzied mob--thoughtless of itself, suicidal to attack us,\r\nyet daring everything in its frenzy.\r\n\r\nSoon the lagoon was crowded--a chaos of pushing, shoving boats. Then the\r\nboats began landing, disgorging their occupants, wild-eyed _slaans_ each\r\na potential murderer. The gardens of the palace were presently jammed\r\nwith them. They did not at first come within our threshholds; they stood\r\nmilling about under the palms, trampling the tropic flowers, screaming\r\nthreats and epithets at us. But waiting--as a mob always does--for some\r\nleader to advance, that they might follow him upon us.\r\n\r\nWe stood on the palace roof-top. I must confess that we were in a flurry\r\nfor the moment. There were undoubtedly weapons at hand, but I at least\r\ndid not have them, nor did I know where they were. Excusable flurry\r\npossibly for the thing had come so quickly, and most of us were\r\nstrangers here of but a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe roof had a low railing waist-high, but broad. We stood clustered\r\nbehind it. In the garden beneath, the mob was shouting up at us. And,\r\nbefore I could stop her, Maida had leaped to the top of the rail. Georg\r\nand I clutched at her, then steadied her.\r\n\r\n_\"Slaans--\"_\r\n\r\nBut they would not hear her. Shouts went up; a roar of threats. The\r\npress of additions to the mob landing from other boats, forced the front\r\nranks forward. They were now on the palace steps, jammed there waving\r\ntheir weapons yet still hesitating to advance.\r\n\r\n\"_Slaans_--my people--\"\r\n\r\nMaida's frail voice was lost in the uproar. Then a missle was thrown\r\nupward--a portion of a broken generator--a heavy chunk of metal. It\r\nbarely missed Maida, and fell with a thump to the roof behind us. Then\r\ncame others--a rain of them about us. I tried to pull Maida back, but\r\nshe fought me, her voice still calling out its appeal.\r\n\r\nWith a bound, Georg was up on the rail beside her. Aften--the young\r\nEarth man--had quietly handed him a cylinder. Georg waved it at the mob.\r\n\r\n\"_Slaans_--\" His stronger voice caught their attention. A sudden hush\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n\"_Slaans_--it is I, Georg Brende. Your Princess Maida rules you now only\r\nunder me. A new ruler, _slaans_--the man of Earth--Georg Brende who must\r\nbe obeyed--Georg Brende, soon to be husband of your Princess--\"\r\n\r\nBut they would not hear him out. The din from them submerged his voice.\r\nHis lips snapped tight as abruptly he ceased talking; his brows lowered\r\ngrimly and I saw his finger press upon the cylinder.\r\n\r\nMaida's voice screamed: \"Georg! Have mercy! Do not kill them!\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke barely in time. His cylinder swept upward. The rays from it\r\ncaught only the upper portions of the palms and the tree tops. The\r\nfoliage withered, shriveled before that soundless, invisible blast.\r\n\r\nNot a blast of heat. The mob, surprised, then frightened, stared upward.\r\nThe soft tropical foliage in a great wide swath was dead, with naked\r\nsticks of limbs. Black, then turning white. Not with heat--but cold. Ice\r\nwas forming from the moisture in the humid air. And then the sudden\r\ncondensation brought snow--a thick white fall of it sifting down into\r\nthe palm-laden garden; falling gently, then swirling in a sudden wind\r\nwhich had begun.\r\n\r\nAs though itself stiffened by the cold just overhead, the mob stood\r\ntransfixed. Then a murmur of horror came. And I saw through the veil of\r\nwhirling snow, that into some of the trees _slaans_ had climbed. Their\r\nbodies, frozen now, slid and fell--black plummets hurtling downward\r\nthrough the swirling snow-flakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n_Immortal Terror_\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Elza, approaching with Tarrano on the tiny flying platform the City\r\nof Ice, the place seemed truly like a child's dream of Fairyland. The\r\nrude snow huts of the Arctic of our Earth were all that she had ever\r\nconceived could be built of frozen water. Here, in the outskirts of the\r\ncity, she saw indeed, quite similar huts. But further in--ornate\r\nbuildings several stories high. She caught a vague glimpse of them only,\r\nas the platform flew above them and descended in the center of the city.\r\n\r\nThey had passed over great outer encircling ramparts--a huge wall many\r\n_helans_ long--built entirely of ice blocks--fortifications like that\r\nfabled wall which in the dim history of our Earth had once encircled a\r\nportion of the domain of the Yellow Race.\r\n\r\nThe platform came down before a central building--the Palace of Ice.\r\nEven in this dim daylight of the Cold Country summer, the great building\r\ngleamed and glittered resplendent. A building of many levels, storied\r\nand winged, with spider bridges and aerial arcades connecting the wings.\r\nFrescoed everywhere! ornate with carved design chipped in ice blocks\r\nhard as marble. Rolling terraces of snow and ice surrounded it--lawns of\r\nsmooth white, with winding paths of ice. A many balconied building;\r\ntowers, spires and minarets crowning it. All blue-white. Glittering.\r\nSeemingly fragile; from a distance, a toy--a sample of the ultra-skill\r\nof some master confectioner, as though the whole thing were a toy of\r\nsugar for children to admire. But at close range--solid; in the cold of\r\nthis terrible region, as solid as though constructed of blocks of stone.\r\n\r\nWith the flying platform landed, and its warming rays cut off,\r\nattendants rushed forward. Tarrano and Elza were wrapped in furs at\r\nonce--heavy furs which covered them from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"Well! Well, Graten!\" Tarrano greeted his subordinate smilingly. \"Things\r\nare in condition here? You got my message?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master. All is in good fashion here. We welcome you.\"\r\n\r\nIn his furs, with face almost hidden, Elza could not see what manner of\r\nman this was.\r\n\r\nThey entered the palace. Frescoed; carved everywhere, within as without.\r\nThe main doorway led into a palatial hall, carpeted with furs. It was\r\nwarm. Tarrano discarded his fur, and helped Elza out of hers.\r\n\r\n\"You like my home, Lady Elza?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's--beautiful,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nHis smile showed amusement at the wonder and awe which stamped her\r\nexpression. He added very gently:\r\n\r\n\"I had in mind when I built it, the hope that you would be pleased.\"\r\n\r\nA comfortable interior warmth. Elza noticed little blurs of red light\r\nbehind wire cages here and there. The warmth came from them; and a glow\r\nof pale white light from the tubes along the wall.\r\n\r\nA woman hurried to them. Tara! Elza recognized her at once. Tara,\r\nlooking very pretty in a pale blue robe, with her hair done high upon\r\nher head. The woman who loved Tarrano; he had sent her on here to be rid\r\nof her, when he went to the Great City. She came forward. Pleasure was\r\non her face at seeing Tarrano; but her glance as she turned it\r\nmomentarily toward Elza, held again that smouldering jealousy.\r\n\r\nTarrano was evidently in a mood of high good humor.\r\n\r\n\"You welcome me prettily, Tara.\" She had flung her arms about him.\r\n\"Tara, my dear is----\"\r\n\r\n\"Master--you come but in time. They are working the Brende instrument.\r\nAlready they have----\"\r\n\r\n\"They? Who?\" He frowned. His words were hard and cold as the ice-blocks\r\naround him.\r\n\r\n\"Woolff. And the son of Cretar. Many of them--using it now!\"\r\n\r\nTarrano drew Elza with him. Tara led the way. Through glowing white\r\nhallways, an arcade; down steps and an incline--to burst at last through\r\na tunnel-like passage into a room.\r\n\r\n\"So? What is this, Cretar?\"\r\n\r\nA room littered with apparatus. A dozen men were about. Men scantily\r\ndressed in this interior heat. Short, squat men of the Cold Country;\r\nflat-nosed, heavy faces; hair long to the base of the neck. In a corner\r\nstood the Brende instrument, fully erected. A light from it seemed\r\npenetrating the bared chest of a man who was at that moment standing in\r\nits curative rays.\r\n\r\nHe whom Tarrano called Cretar, took a step forward.\r\n\r\n\"Master, we----\"\r\n\r\n\"Making yourselves immortal?\" The anger had left Tarrano's voice; irony\r\nwas there instead.\r\n\r\n\"Master----\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you done that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master--yes! Yes! We did! Forgive us, Master.\"\r\n\r\nThe man before the instrument had retreated from it. Elza saw now that\r\nall the men were shrinking back in terror. All save Cretar, who had\r\nfallen tremblingly to his knees. Yet Tarrano showed no anger. He\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\"I would not hurt you, Cretar! Get up, man! I am not angry--not even\r\nannoyed. Why, your skin is turning orange. See the mottles!\"\r\n\r\nOn the flesh of all the men--save the one who had been checked in the\r\nact of using the instrument--a bright orange mottling was apparent.\r\nCretar exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"The immunity to all diseases, master. It is itself a\r\ndisease--harmless--and it combats every other.\" He laughed a little\r\nwildly. \"We cannot get sick now. We cannot die--we are immortal. Come,\r\nMaster--let us make you so!\"\r\n\r\nTarrano whispered: \"You see, Lady Elza? The orange spots! These men of\r\nmedicine here have used the Brende secret to its full. Immune from\r\ndisease!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us treat _you_, Master. This immortality----\"\r\n\r\nOn Cretar's face was a triumphant smile, but in his eyes lay a terror.\r\nThe man who had not been treated stood against the wall watching with\r\ninterest and curiosity. But the others! They crouched; wary; alert eyes\r\nlike animals at bay.\r\n\r\nTarrano laughed. \"Treat me! Cretar, you know not with what you have been\r\ntrifling. Immortal? You are indeed. Disease cannot touch you! You cannot\r\ndie--save by violence!\"\r\n\r\nHe swung to Elza. \"These men, Lady Elza--they are strong-muscled. In\r\nhealth now more perfect than any other humans. _You_ are frail--a frail\r\nlittle woman. And unarmed. I bid you--strike one of them!\"\r\n\r\nShe stared; but as she suddenly faced about, she caught in part his\r\nmeaning. Before her Cretar shrank back, his face gone white, his teeth\r\nchattering.\r\n\r\n\"What's that behind you?\" Tarrano's voice simulated sudden alarm; he\r\nscuffled his feet on the floor. The men jumped with fright; nerves\r\nunstrung, they cowered.\r\n\r\n\"What manner of men!\" Tarrano's laugh was contemptuous. \"Oh, Lady Elza,\r\nlet this be a lesson to all of us! To cure disease is well. To prevent\r\nit--that too is good. But immortality--Dr. Brende never intended it,\r\n_you_ know he did not, Lady Elza--the belief that we have everlasting\r\nlife here on this plane--the Creator never intended that. With all\r\ndanger of death gone--save violence--these immortals here fear violence\r\nso greatly that they are men no longer!\r\n\r\n\"Immortal terror! God forbid _I_ should ever feel it! Or you, Lady Elza.\r\nA lesson for us all, who would be so un-Godly as to seek and think we\r\nhave found what only the Creator Himself can bestow!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n_Black Cloud of Death_\r\n\r\n\r\nI must revert now to that time in the gardens of Maida's palace at the\r\nGreat City when we stood upon its roof-top, threatened below by that mob\r\nof _slaans_. Georg stood with the cylinder in his hand, waving it. The\r\npalm foliage was freezing. Down through the swirling snow fell the\r\nfrozen bodies of the _slaans_ who had climbed into the gigantic palm\r\nfronds. The thuds as the bodies struck the ground sounded horribly plain\r\nin the stillness. Georg was still waving his cylinder. Snow and ice were\r\ngathering everywhere. Incautiously he lowered the weapon; a brief,\r\nmomentary chill--the congealing breath of the Arctic in this warm\r\npalm-laden garden--swept the horror-stricken crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Georg, have mercy!\"\r\n\r\nMaida's frightened, pleading words brought Georg to his senses. He\r\nsnapped off the cylinder and dropped it behind him to the palace\r\nroof-top. He was trembling and white as he stood with his arm around\r\nMaida. Weapons so drastic as this one were seldom used. Indeed, it was\r\nlaw throughout both Venus and the Earth that no civilian should possess\r\nthem. The power for wholesale death in his hand, and which without\r\nwholly meaning to, he had so nearly used to its full effect, had\r\nunnerved him.\r\n\r\nWithout the ray, the wind soon died. The warmer air mounting, melted the\r\nice; the snow ceased falling. But the swath of shriveled foliage\r\nremained--a hideous scar cut into the luxuriant tropical growth.\r\n\r\nThe mob had forgotten its threats, its evil intent. Silent for a moment,\r\nit now burst into outcries. Motionless: then milling about, struggling\r\naimlessly with itself--struggling to retreat. A panic of terror. The\r\nboats in the lagoon were retreating. The _slaans_ along the fringe of\r\nshore began hurriedly to embark. The groups huddled at the palace steps\r\nwere trying to shove the others back. In a rout they tumbled into their\r\nboats and scurried away. Maida's voice, striving to reassure them, was\r\nunheard.\r\n\r\nAnd presently the scarred, trampled garden was empty and silent.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion, checked thus at its start, was quelled. Throughout the\r\ncity that night--for the _slaans_ to hear whether they would or no--the\r\nbroadcast stations flung their stentorian tones to the people; a speech\r\nby Maida; her promise of better things to come for the _slaans_; the end\r\nof Tarrano's brief rule; a reorganization of past conditions. Maida\r\nherself had never been in control in the Central State. The luxury--the\r\nlicense-of the ruling class had been no fault of hers. She promised fair\r\ntreatment now to the _slaans_. She was to marry Georg Brende, the Earth\r\nman.\r\n\r\nMaida did marry Georg. With the many stirring events--a time when\r\ndisaster and death threatened us all--so soon to follow, I shall not\r\npause to describe the wedding. A quaint, yet magnificent spectacle.\r\nMaida in her regal robe; Georg looking every inch a ruler. Their barge\r\nof white leading the procession--a barge of white flowers, its sides\r\nlined with maidens to fend off the deluge of blossoms with which the\r\nonlookers assailed the bridal couple. The arrival at the marriage\r\nisland, where on an altar the quaintly garbed holy man immersed them;\r\nand the solemn men of law united them as one.\r\n\r\nIt was a night of rejoicing throughout the Great City; and on every\r\nmirror in the Empire it was pictured for those who could not be present.\r\n\r\nA time of rejoicing. Yet then--as always those days--my heart was heavy.\r\nElza was held by Tarrano. We knew he had taken her to the City of Ice.\r\nThere was of course, no radio communication with the Cold Country. We\r\nhad tried eavesdropping upon it, but to no avail. Tarrano's close-flung\r\nbarrage checked every wave we could send against it.\r\n\r\nTime passed--a month or more. We were worried over Elza naturally. Yet\r\nthe saving grace was that we knew Tarrano would treat her kindly; that\r\nfor the present at least, she was in no danger.\r\n\r\nGeorg and Maida took possession of the Central State. Their rule started\r\nauspiciously, for by a series of speeches--a reorganization of money\r\npayments--the _slaans_ seemed well satisfied. Loyal, and with a growing\r\npatriotism, an eagerness to help in the coming war with Tarrano.\r\nGeorg--without actually saying so--made them believe that the only hope\r\nof everlasting life was the recovery from Tarrano of the Brende model.\r\nThe model was in the City of Ice; it must be captured.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, to us of the government, the Brende model was not\r\nindispensable. The greatest factor was that the threat of Tarrano's\r\nuniversal conquest must be forever removed. Like a rocket-bomb, this man\r\nof genius had risen from obscurity--had all but conquered the three\r\ngreatest worlds of the universe.\r\n\r\nI think that the height of Tarrano's power was reached that day on the\r\neve of the Water Festival when he made his triumphant entry into the\r\nGreat City. Venus was his at that moment; all of Venus. Mars was his;\r\nthe Hairless Men--savages who had fallen readily to his wiles, had\r\nconquered the civilized, ruling Little People. And the Earth, over-run\r\nby his spies, deluged by his propaganda which, insidiously as rust will\r\neat away a metal, was eating into the loyalty of our Earth-public--our\r\nown great Earth was in a dangerous position. The Earth Council realized\r\nit. The Almighty only could know how many of our officials, our men in\r\ntrusted positions, were at heart loyal to Tarrano!\r\n\r\nThe thing was obvious. The assassination of our three rulers--leaders of\r\nthe white, yellow and black races--with which Tarrano's campaign in the\r\nopen had begun--those assassinations could never have taken place had\r\nnot our military organization been diseased.\r\n\r\nFacts like these were constantly coming to us now, here in the Great\r\nCity. A brief time of physical inactivity. Yet underneath the calm, we\r\nrealized there was a struggle going on everywhere; a struggle of\r\nsentiment, of propaganda, of public opinion.\r\n\r\nWarfare, with modern weapons by which a man single-handed might destroy\r\na city--is no longer a matter of men. The citizen--unarmed--united in\r\nsentiment and desire with a million of his kind--becomes the real ruler.\r\nYou cannot--because you have a weapon--destroy a million of your\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nWe realized this. And in the ultimate decision--the popular fancy\r\nalmost--of our publics--lay our real success or downfall.\r\n\r\nTarrano in the popular mind had a tremendous hold. Dispatches from Earth\r\nmade it plain that upon every street level the people were discussing\r\nhim. From the Great City daily we sent bulletins of our progress toward\r\nchecking--destroying--the menace of him. But bulletins also were\r\nemanating from the City of Ice. We could not stop them. Cut off at every\r\nofficial Earth station--and with all unofficial stations unable to\r\nreceive them--nevertheless at some secret station which could not be\r\nfound, they were received. And from there, circulated throughout the\r\nEarth. The air was full of them. Mysteriously, scenes showing the great\r\nTarrano appeared upon the official news-mirrors; a speech of Tarrano's\r\nwas once officially broadcasted before its source could be located and\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nLike a smothered fire smouldering, lacking only a breath of vital gas to\r\nexplode it into flame, the sentiment for Tarrano spread about the Earth.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is fickle. It sways instinctively--not always, but\r\noften--to the winning side. Here in Venus we knew we must defeat\r\nTarrano. Destroy him personally and thus put an end to it all forever,\r\nsince his dominion hung wholly upon the genius of his own personality.\r\n\r\nOur spies, some of them, got to the City of Ice, and back. A few flying\r\nmen were able to hover about the city, and with instruments peer down\r\ninto it. We knew that Tarrano was mobilizing for a move upon the Earth,\r\nwhere with a war-like demonstration he hoped to be accepted, yielded to,\r\nwithout a severe struggle. But, within a month now, we learned he had\r\nabandoned that idea. He knew, of course, our own preparations to attack\r\nhim; and he began concentrating everything upon his own defense in the\r\nCity of Ice.\r\n\r\nHis last stand. We officials knew it. And we knew he felt it also. And\r\nthough on Earth our public felt differently, the Little People\r\nrecognized it. A stirring, wonderful time--that day when on our mirrors\r\nwas pictured the revolt of the Little People against the Tarrano rule of\r\nthe Hairless Men. Grim scenes of tragedy; and over the carnage, the\r\nLittle People triumphed. Tarrano's rule--with all the excesses of the\r\nHairless Men who proved themselves mere rapacious plunderers in the name\r\nof warfare--was at an end on Mars.\r\n\r\nThe effect on Earth of this Martian reversal was beneficial to us. A\r\ngood omen. We on Venus, redoubled our efforts to attack successfully the\r\nCity of Ice.\r\n\r\nMars could send us no aid, though now in full sympathy with us. The\r\nplanet was daily at a greater distance from us; and the Little People,\r\nnot recovered from the effects of their own bloody strife, were in no\r\nposition to help us.\r\n\r\nNor did the Earth Council deem it wise to send men additional to those\r\nfew we already had. The Earth was rapidly being left behind by the\r\nswifter flight of Venus through her orbit. The official season for the\r\nmail-flyers was closed. The opposition of the two planets was long since\r\npassed; millions of additional miles were adding to the space separating\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd the Earth Council was not sure of its men! Any one of them might\r\nsecretly be in Tarrano's service--and do us infinitely more harm if\r\nbrought to Venus, than if left at home.\r\n\r\nWe seemed of solid strength in the Central State. For the first time in\r\ngenerations the _Rhaals_--the men of science from whom all the progress\r\nof civilization on Venus came--departed from their attitude of\r\naloofness. Their work--always before industrial--now turned to the\r\nsterner demands of war.\r\n\r\nThe Rhaal City[22] lay a brief flight from us. A grave sort of\r\npeople, these _Rhaals_. Men of square-cut, sober-colored garments; women\r\nof sober grey flowing robes--white hair coiled upon their heads.\r\nIntelligent women, dignified of demeanor; many of them learned as were\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: An awkward, unpronounceable word which for the purposes of\r\nthis narrative may be termed Industriana.]\r\n\r\nTheir city, teeming now with the preparations for war, was intensely\r\ninteresting to me. We spent most of our days in it, flying back at\r\nnightfall to Maida's palace. Yet I shall not describe it, nor our\r\npreparations, our days of activity--but hasten on to the first of the\r\nextraordinary incidents impending.\r\n\r\nIt came--this first incident--through my thoughts of Elza. I was\r\nworried--more than worried, sometimes almost terrified about her. My\r\ninstinct would have been to take a handful of men and dash to her\r\nrescue--which of course would have been absurd. I tried to reassure\r\nmyself. Tarrano would treat her kindly. Soon, in full force, our army\r\nwould descend upon the City of Ice, capture it, destroy Tarrano--rescue\r\nElza.\r\n\r\nRescue Elza! Ah, there lay the difficulty which I never dared\r\ncontemplate in detail. How would we rescue her? Tarrano would treat her\r\nkindly, now during his own security. But if, at the last, he saw his own\r\ndefeat, his death perhaps impending--would he treat her kindly then?\r\n\r\nI loved Elza very deeply. A new torture came from it now. Did she love\r\nme--or Tarrano? I remembered the gentleness of the man with her. His\r\ndignity, his power--his undoubted genius. And who, what was I? A mere\r\nnews-gatherer. A man of no force, and little personality. A nonentity.\r\nSometimes as in my jealousy I contemplated Elza with Tarrano now, I felt\r\nthat he was everything a young girl would fancy. How could she help\r\nloving him?\r\n\r\nAt night, when sleep would not come to me, I would lie tossing, thinking\r\nof it. Did Elza love me--or Tarrano? Once I had thought she loved me.\r\nBut she had never said so.\r\n\r\nIt was out of this constant thinking of Elza that the first of the\r\nincidents I have mentioned, arose. There came to me one night the\r\nfeeling that Elza was near me. I awoke from half sleep to full\r\nwakefulness. In my bedroom, upon the low couch on which I lay, the aural\r\nlights of Venus spread their vivid tints. The palace was silent; I sat\r\nup, pressing my palms to my throbbing temples.\r\n\r\n_Elza was coming nearer to me!_\r\n\r\nI knew it. Not by any of my bodily senses. A knowledge, which suddenly I\r\nrealized that I had. A moment, and then I was conscious of her voice! No\r\nsound; my ears heard nothing. Yet my brain was aware of familiar tones.\r\nI recognized them, as one can remember how a loved voice sounded when\r\nlast it was heard.\r\n\r\nBut this was no memory. A present actuality; it rang soundless in my\r\nbrain. Elza's voice. Anxious! Frightened!\r\n\r\nAt first only the confused _tone_ of it. Then the consciousness of\r\nwords. Two reiterated words:\r\n\r\n_\"Danger! Jac! Danger! Jac!\"_\r\n\r\nI waited no longer, but rushed to Georg and Maida--beautiful Maida in\r\nher robe of sleep with her white hair tumbling about her. Georg half\r\nawake--yet almost at once he could understand me, and explain.\r\n\r\nNatural, instinctive telepathy! It had not occurred to me. I had never\r\nbothered to develop telepathy; and indeed with any degree of fluency--or\r\neven of surety of reception--the phenomenon is difficult to perfect.\r\nYet, as I knew, with a loved one absent upon whom one's thoughts dwell\r\nconstantly--in time of stress telepathy is occasionally automatically\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIt was so in Georg and Maida's case, back there in the Mountain Station\r\non Earth. Telepathy was the explanation of Georg's mysterious actions as\r\nhe stood there before the sending mirrors, crossed the room in\r\nconfusion, and like one in a dream leaped from the window to be seized\r\nby Tarrano's spies. Maida had been abducted a moment before. Georg's\r\nbrain became aware of it. Her danger, the appeal she sent to him.\r\n\r\nSo it now seemed to be from Elza to me. Georg, out of bed now beside me,\r\nurged me to greater efforts of concentration, that I might understand\r\nwhat message Elza was sending.\r\n\r\n_\"Elza! Elza dear! Where are you? What is it?\"_\r\n\r\nI murmured the words to myself as with all my power, I thought them over\r\nand over, flinging out the thoughts like radio waves into the night.\r\nMysterious vibrations! In an instant, from here--everywhere in the\r\nuniverse. Who knows their character? Their speed? The speed of light a\r\nlaggard perhaps beside the flash of a thought! Waves of my thoughts,\r\nspeeding through the night, with only one receiving station in all the\r\nuniverse! Would Elza's brain capture them?\r\n\r\n_\"Elza dear! Where are you? What is it?\"_\r\n\r\n_\"Jac! Danger! Jac! Danger!\"_\r\n\r\nIt was very clear. The words rang in my head. But always only those two.\r\nAnd then at last--it may have been an hour later--other words:\r\n\r\n_\"Death! The black cloud of death! You can see it coming! See it coming!\r\nDeath! To you Jac! To all of you in the city!\"_\r\n\r\nWe rushed to the casement. The broad lagoon before the palace lay like a\r\nmirror tinted red and purple. Beyond it, palms and the outlines of\r\nhouses lay dark against the star-strewn sky.\r\n\r\nBut out there, over the city, in the distance a dark patch obscured the\r\nstars. We watched it breathless. A dark patch which soon took shape. A\r\ncloud! A black cloud--unnatural of aspect somehow--a rolling, low-lying\r\nblack cloud. Growing larger; spreading out side-wise; sweeping toward\r\nthe city on a wind which had not reached us.\r\n\r\n_\"Jac! Jac dear! Danger! Death to all the city!\"_\r\n\r\nElza's words were still beating in my brain. Soundless words of terror\r\nand warning!\r\n\r\n_\"Death, Jac! Death to all the city! The black cloud of death!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n_Tarrano the Man_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wake up, Lady Elza.\"\r\n\r\nA silence. His hand touched her white shoulder. \"Wake up, Lady Elza. It\r\nis I--Tarrano.\"\r\n\r\nElza opened her eyes, struggling to confused wakefulness. The white\r\nwalls of her sleeping room in Tarrano's palace of the City of Ice were\r\nstained with the dim red radiance of her night light. She opened her\r\neyes to meet Tarrano's inscrutable face as he bent over her couch;\r\nbecame conscious of his low, insistent, \"Wake up, Lady Elza;\" and his\r\nfingers half caressing the filmy scarf that covered her shoulders.\r\n\r\nTerror flooded Elza; that time she had always feared, had come. Yet she\r\nhad the presence of mind to smile, drawing away from him and sitting up,\r\nwith the fur bed-covering pulled to her chin.\r\n\r\n\"Tarrano? Why--\"\r\n\r\nHe straightened, and into his expression came apology.\r\n\r\n\"I frightened you, Lady Elza? I'm sorry. I would not do that for all the\r\nworlds.\"\r\n\r\nHer terror receded. The old Tarrano over whom she still held sway. She\r\nsummoned a look of haughty questioning.\r\n\r\n\"You are bold, Tarrano--\"\r\n\r\nHis gesture was deprecating; he seated himself on the edge of her couch.\r\nShe saw now that he was fully dressed and armed with a belt of many\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nAt this time Elza had been in the City of Ice for a considerable period.\r\nIrksome, worried days of semi-imprisonment; and through them, Tarrano's\r\nattitude toward her was unchanged. She saw little of him; he seemed very\r\nbusy, though to what end, and what his activities, she could not learn.\r\n\r\nWithin the palace, half as guard, half as maid-servant, Tara was\r\ngenerally Elza's only companion. And then, one evening when Tara's\r\nsmouldering jealousy broke forth in Tarrano's presence and Elza uttered\r\nan involuntary cry of fear, Tara was summarily removed.\r\n\r\nElza was left practically alone; until at length came this night when\r\ninvading the privacy of her sleeping room, Tarrano awakened her. He sat\r\nnow upon the edge of her couch.\r\n\r\n\"I have a confession to make to you, Lady Elza.\" He smiled slightly. \"As\r\nyou know, there is no one else in our habitable universe to whom I would\r\nspeak thus frankly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am honored, Tarrano. But here, at this hour of sleep--\"\r\n\r\nHe waved away the words. \"I have asked your pardon for that. My\r\nconfession--as once before, Lady Elza, I come to you most humbly,\r\nconfessing that my affairs are not going as I would like. You do not\r\nknow, of course, that Mars--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing,\" she interrupted. \"You have kept me from the\r\nnews-mirrors, if indeed there are any here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mars revolted against me,\" he went on imperturbably. \"The Little People\r\nare again in control. Fools! They do not realize, those governors of\r\nMars, that their public ultimately will demand this _Everlasting Life_\r\nof mine--the Brende secret--\"\r\n\r\nShe frowned. \"No one knows better than you, Tarrano, that my father's\r\nsecret does not bestow immortality. To cure disease, in a measure--\"\r\n\r\nHe checked her; his smile was ironical. \"You and I know that, Lady Elza.\r\nWe know that on this plane we would not want everlasting life if we\r\ncould have it. But the public does not know that--let us not discuss it.\r\nI was telling you--confessing to you--I have lost Mars. Temporarily, of\r\ncourse. Meanwhile, I have been preparing to invade the Earth.\" His\r\ngesture was expansive. \"I have been planning, from here in the Cold\r\nCountry, to send armies to your Earth.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused an instant. \"I think now I shall wait until the next\r\nopposition--we are far from Earth now, but all in good time we shall be\r\ncloser.... Strange is it not, that I should like to tell you my plans?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer; she watched his smile fading into a look of\r\ngrimness. \"In the Great City, here on Venus, they are getting ready to\r\nattack me. Did you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You supposed they were? Your brother, and that Jac Hallen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you hoped they were, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she repeated.\r\n\r\nHe frowned. \"You are disconcertingly frank, Lady Elza. Well, let me tell\r\nyou this--it would come to nothing. The _Rhaals_ are with them--all the\r\nresources of the Central State are to be thrown against me. Yet it will\r\ncome to nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHer heart leaped. Tarrano was making his last stand. Beyond the logical\r\nsense of his words, she could see it in his eyes. He knew he was making\r\nhis last stand. He knew too that she was now aware of it; and that\r\nbehind the confidence of his words--that was the confession he was\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nTarrano's last stand! There seemed to her then something illogically\r\npathetic in it all. This man of genius--so short a time ago all but the\r\nEmperor of three worlds. And now, with them slipping from his grasp,\r\nreduced to this last stronghold in the bleak fastnesses of the Cold\r\nCountry, awaiting the inevitable attack upon him. Something pathetic....\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Tarrano.\"\r\n\r\nAs though mirrored from her own expression, a wistful look had come to\r\nhim. Her words drove it away.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry? There is nothing to be sorry about. Their attack will come to\r\nnothing ... yet--\" He stopped short, and then as though deciding to say\r\nwhat he had begun, he added:\r\n\r\n\"Yet, Lady Elza, I am no fool to discard possibilities. I may be\r\ndefeated.\" He laughed harshly. \"To what depths has Tarrano fallen that\r\nhe can voice such a possibility!\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned toward her and into his tone came a greater earnestness than\r\nshe ever heard in it before.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Elza, if they should be successful, they would not capture me--for\r\nI would die fighting. You understand that, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nShe met his eyes; the gleam in them held her. Forgetful of herself, she\r\nhad allowed the fur to drop from her: she sat bolt upright, the dim red\r\nlight tinting the scarf that lay like gossamer around her white\r\nshoulders. His hand came out and touched her arm, slipped up to her\r\nshoulder and rested there, but she did not feel it.\r\n\r\n\"I will die fighting,\" he repeated. \"You understand that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she breathed.\r\n\r\n\"And you would be sorry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not relax. His eyes burned her: but deep in them she saw that\r\nquality of wistfulness, of pleading.\r\n\r\n\"You, my Elza, they would rescue--unless I killed you.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not move, but within her was a shudder.\r\n\r\n\"You know I would kill you, my Elza, rather than give you up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"I--wonder. Sometimes I think I would.\" Suddenly he cast aside all\r\nrestraint. \"Oh, my Elza--that we should have to plan such things as\r\nthese! You, sitting there--you are so beautiful! Your eyes--limpid pools\r\nwith terror lurking in them when I would have them misty with love! My\r\nElza--\"\r\n\r\nThe woman in her responded. A wave of color flooded her throat and face.\r\nBut she drew away from him.\r\n\r\n\"My Elza! Can you not tell me that even in defeat I may be victorious?\r\nIt is you more than all else that I desire.\"\r\n\r\nWithout warning his arms were around her, holding her fiercely to him,\r\nhis face close to hers.\r\n\r\n\"Elza! With you, defeat would be victory. And with you--now--if you\r\nwould but say the word--together we will surmount every obstacle.--\"\r\n\r\nHe was kissing her, bending back her head, and his grip upon her\r\nshoulder was bruising the flesh. No longer Tarrano, Conqueror of the\r\nuniverse, just Tarrano the man. Terror surged within Elza's heart.\r\n\r\n\"Tarrano!\"\r\n\r\n\"Elza dear--my Elza--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tarrano!\" She fought with him. \"Tarrano, do you dare--I tell you--\"\r\n\r\nThe frightened pleading of a woman at bay. And then abruptly he cast her\r\noff. His laugh was grim.\r\n\r\n\"What a fool I am! Tarrano the weakling!\" He leaped from the couch and\r\nbegan pacing the room. \"Tarrano the weakling! To what depths has Tarrano\r\nfallen!\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped before her. \"I ask your pardon, Lady Elza. This has been\r\nmadness. Forget my words--all madness.\"\r\n\r\nHis tone was crisp. \"Human weakness to which I did not realize I was so\r\nprone made me talk like a fool. Desire you above the conquest of the\r\nuniverse? Absurd! Lies that men whisper into women's ears! All lies!\"\r\n\r\nWas he telling the real truth now? Or was this a mood of recrimination?\r\nBitterness that his love was scorned. Again his gaze held her, but in it\r\nnow she could see nothing but a cruel inflexible purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Tarrano in defeat! That is impossible, Lady Elza. You will very shortly\r\nrealize that, for I am going to show you how, single-handed, I can make\r\nit impossible. Show you with your own eyes. It was my purpose in coming\r\nto waken you--my purpose, when your beauty led me into weakness\r\nincredible.... Get up, Lady Elza.\"\r\n\r\nShe stared. With folded arms he stood emotionless regarding her.\r\n\r\n\"Get up, I tell you. Put on those garments you wore when we arrived. We\r\nare going travelling again.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood waiting; and beneath his gaze she shrank back, drawing the fur\r\nrug over her.\r\n\r\nA smile of contempt parted his lips. \"You hesitate? You think I am still\r\na weakling? You over-rate your beauty, Lady Elza.... Make haste, I\r\ncommand you. We must start very soon.\"\r\n\r\nShe summoned her voice. \"Start? Where? What are you--\"\r\n\r\n\"No questions, Lady Elza. Not now. Make haste--\"\r\n\r\nHe jerked from her the fur covering, flung it across the room, and with\r\nthe same gesture turned away impersonally. Trembling, she rose from the\r\ncouch and donned the garments he had indicated, while he stood brooding\r\nby the window, gazing through its transparent pane at the glistening\r\nfrozen city which was all that remained of his empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n_Thing in the Forest_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All in good time, Lady Elza, you will know where we are.\"\r\n\r\nAlone, unnoticed, they had departed from the City of Ice on a small\r\nflying platform similar to the one they had used before. The night had\r\npassed; day, with a new warmth to the sun, came again. Flying low, with\r\nTarrano in a grim, moody silence, and Elza staring downward.\r\n\r\nThe aural lights were overhead when at the last Tarrano brought the\r\nplatform to rest. A thick, luxuriant forest. Huge trees with rope-like\r\nroots and heavy vines. Others with leaves like the ears of an elephant.\r\nAnd the ground hidden by almost impenetrable underbrush.\r\n\r\nThey had landed in a tiny glade beside a dank marsh of water, where\r\nferns shoulder high were embanked. It was dark, the stars and the tints\r\nof the auroral lights were barely distinguishable through the mass of\r\nfoliage overhead. Elza gazed around her fearsomely. The air was heavy,\r\noppressive. Redolent with the perfume of wild flowers and the smell of\r\nmouldering, steaming soil.\r\n\r\n\"All in good time. Lady Elza,\" Tarrano repeated. \"You will know where we\r\nare presently; we are closer to human habitation than you would think.\"\r\n\r\nElza's heart pounded. As they were descending she had noticed a glow of\r\nlight in the sky ahead. As though by intuition now, she seemed to\r\nrealize that they were not far from the Great City. Her thoughts leaped\r\nto me--Jac Hallen--there in Maida's palace. Tarrano's grim, sinister\r\npurpose was as yet unknown to her. But she guessed that in it, danger\r\nimpended for me--for all of us in the Great City.\r\n\r\n_\"Jac! Danger! Jac! Danger!\"_\r\n\r\nHer thoughts instinctively reiterated the two words uppermost in her\r\nmind. And I think that it was just about then when they awakened me.\r\n\r\nLeaving the vehicle, Tarrano commanded Elza to follow him; and he began\r\npicking his way through the jungle. A light was in his hand; it\r\npenetrated but a short distance. A quivering beam of yellow light; then\r\nElza saw that upon occasion, as Tarrano's finger slid a lever, the beam\r\nnarrowed, intensified to a bright lavender. And now where it struck, the\r\nvegetation withered. Blackened, sometimes burst into tiny flame, and\r\nparted thus before them as they advanced.\r\n\r\nThe jungle was silent; yet, as Elza listened, beneath the crackle of the\r\nburning twigs she could hear the tiny myriad voices of insect life.\r\nStartled voices as the heat of Tarrano's beam struck them. Rustling\r\nleaves; breaking twigs; things scurrying and sliding away, unseen in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice a crashing--some monster disturbed in his rest plunging\r\naway. Again, a slithering bulk of something, undulating its path through\r\nthe thickets. All unseen. Save once. Looking upward, Elza caught a gleam\r\nof green eyes overhead. A triangle of three baleful spots of\r\nphosphorescent green. Her murmur of fright caused Tarrano to glance\r\nupward. His lavender, beam, grown suddenly larger, swung there with a\r\nhiss. Falling from above came a pink body. A bloated body, square, with\r\nsquat, twisted legs; a thing larger than a man. A grotesque naked\r\nmonstrosity almost in human form. A travesty--gruesome mockery of\r\nmankind. A face, three-eyed...\r\n\r\nThe thing lay writhing in the underbrush, mouthing, mumbling and then\r\nscreaming--the shrill scream of death agony. And the horrible smell of\r\nburning flesh as Tarrano's light played upon it...\r\n\r\n\"Come away, Lady Elza. I'm sorry. I had hoped to avoid an affair such as\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nSickened, shuddering, Elza clung close to Tarrano as he led her onward.\r\n\r\nAn hour or more; and now Elza could see in the distance the lights of\r\nthe Great City.\r\n\r\n_\"Jac! Danger! Jac! Danger!\"_\r\n\r\nThe idea of thought-transference had come to her. With all the power of\r\nher mind she was thinking her warning to me, praying that it might reach\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Single-handed, Lady Elza. You shall see now how, single-handed, I make\r\nimpossible any attack upon Tarrano.\"\r\n\r\nIn her abstraction Elza had almost forgotten herself and Tarrano; his\r\nvoice reached her--his voice grim and with a gloating, sinister triumph\r\nin it. He was bending to the ground. Elza saw that they had come to an\r\nopen space--an eminence rising above the forest. Underfoot was a stony\r\nsoil; in places, bare black rock with an outcropping of red, like the\r\ncinnabar from which on Earth we melt the _Heavy-metal_.[23]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Quicksilver.]\r\n\r\nTarrano faced her. \"Nature, my Lady Elza, is fair to my purpose. I knew\r\nI would find some such deposit as this.\" He turned his face to one side\r\nattentively, and darted his light--harmlessly yellow now--to where a\r\nlone tree showed its great leaves beginning to waver in a night breeze.\r\n\r\n\"Nature is with us! See there, my Elza! A wind is coming--a wind from us\r\nto--them!\"\r\n\r\nThe breeze grew--a breeze blowing directly over the forest to where in\r\nthe distance the lights of the Great City showed plainly. Tarrano added:\r\n\r\n\"I had thought to create the wind.\" He tapped his belt. \"Create the wind\r\nto carry our onslaught. But you see, it is unnecessary. Nature is kind,\r\nand far more efficacious than our man-made devices.\"\r\n\r\n_\"Jac! Danger!\"_ She stood there in the breeze, watching Tarrano--his\r\npurpose as yet no more than guessed--praying that I might receive her\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\nTarrano selected his spot--a tiny little cone of rock no bigger than his\r\nthumb. He beckoned Elza.\r\n\r\n\"Stand close, and watch. You shall see how from the merest spark, a\r\nconflagration may ensue.\"\r\n\r\nThe cylinder in his hand darted forth a needle-like shaft--a light of\r\nintense purple. It touched the tiny cone of rock, and he held it there.\r\n\r\n\"A moment. Be patient, my Elza.\"\r\n\r\nThe point of rock seemed presently to melt. Like a tiny volcano, at\r\ntheir feet, lava from it was flowing down. A little stream of melted\r\nrock, viscous, bubbling a trifle; red at the edges, white within, and\r\nwith wisps of smoke curling up from it.\r\n\r\nElza stared with the fascination of horror, for now tiny tongues of\r\nflame were licking about. Blue tongues, licking the air, vanishing into\r\nwisps of black smoke.\r\n\r\nTarrano snapped off his ray. But the tongues of flame stayed alive.\r\nSpreading slowly, soundlessly, their heat now melting the ground.\r\n\r\nA breath of the smoke touched Elza's face. Pungent, acrid. It stopped\r\nher breathing. She choked, coughed heavily to expel it.\r\n\r\n\"Come away, Lady Elza. Let us watch from a safer distance.\"\r\n\r\nHe led her from the hillock, up the wind to where at the edge of the\r\nforest they stood gazing.\r\n\r\nThe blue fire had spread over a distance of several feet. A sluggish,\r\nboiling, bubbling area of flame. Tongues now the height of a man. And\r\nfrom them, rolling upward, a heavy black cloud--deadly fumes thick,\r\nblacker than the night, spreading out, welling forward over the forest\r\ntoward the Great City slumbering in its falsely peaceful security.\r\n\r\nAt last Elza knew. Stood there, cold, shuddering, thinking with all the\r\npower of her mind and being:\r\n\r\n_\"Death, Jac! Death to all the City! The black cloud of death!\"_\r\n\r\nOblivious to Tarrano she stood until at last the rocky eminence was one\r\ngreat mass of the surging blue fire. And the black cloud, compact as a\r\nthunder-head, rolled onward.\r\n\r\n_\"You can see it coming! Death Jac! Death to all the City!\"_\r\n\r\nA sudden madness descended upon Elza. She felt abruptly that her warning\r\nwas futile, felt an overpowering desire to run. Run somewhere--anywhere,\r\naway from the lurid sight she was facing. Or run perhaps, to the Great\r\nCity; to race with that black cloud of death; to run fast and far, and\r\nburst into our palace to warn us.\r\n\r\nTarrano himself lost in triumphant contemplation of what he had done,\r\nfor the moment was heedless of Elza's presence. With white face upon\r\nwhich the blue glare had settled like a mask of death, Elza turned\r\nsilently from him. Forgetful of that horrible thing they had\r\nencountered--others of its kind which might be lurking about--she turned\r\nsilently and plunged into the black depths of the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n_A Woman's Scream_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The black Cloud of Death!\"\r\n\r\nWe stood there at the casement of the palace, gazing with a growing\r\nterror at the visible evidence of the tragedy which threatened. A black\r\ncloud off there in the distance, spreading out, rolling inexorably\r\ntoward us. And then came the wind, and with it a breath of the black\r\nmonster--a choking, horrible suggestion of the death rolling already\r\nover the city.\r\n\r\nWe must have been fascinated at the casement for some considerable time.\r\nElza's thought messages had ceased. Abruptly I came to myself.\r\n\r\n\"The Black Cloud of Death!\" I turned to Georg and Maida. \"Alarm the\r\ncity! Arouse them all! Alarm--\"\r\n\r\nMaida's face was white: she flung off Georg's arm which had been\r\nprotectingly around her. \"The siren--\"\r\n\r\nTerrible moments, those that followed. Confusion; panic; death!\r\n\r\nThe public siren in the tower by the lagoon entrance shrilled its\r\nwarning. The danger lights blazed out. The city came to life. Lights\r\nsprang up everywhere. People--with the daze of sleep still upon\r\nthem--appeared at the casements; on the roof-tops; on the canal steps\r\nthey appeared, fumbling with their boats. Panic!\r\n\r\nA pandemonium. Aircraft, such as could so hastily be mustered, swept\r\noverhead. A glare of lights everywhere. The shrill voice of the siren\r\nstilled, to make audible the broadcast warnings--stentorian tones\r\nscreaming: \"The Black Cloud of Death! Escape from the city! Escape to\r\nIndustriana!\"\r\n\r\nWarning, advice, command! But over it all, the breath of the black cloud\r\nnow lay heavy. The lights were dimmed by it. Everywhere--to every\r\ndeepest recess of the city--to every inner room where to escape it many\r\nhad fled--its deadly choking breath was penetrating.\r\n\r\nWithin the palace was turmoil. We had an air-vehicle on a landing-stage\r\nnearby; but Georg and Maida would not leave at once. Rulers of the\r\nCentral State, as a Director might stick to his crumbling Tower, they\r\nstayed now in the Great City. Encouraging the people. Maida's voice,\r\nfutilely attempting to broadcast over the uproar. Georg commanding the\r\nofficial air-vessels to load with refugees; himself struggling to direct\r\nthe jam of boats toward the embarking stages.\r\n\r\nWe were in the instrument room of the palace. The air was pale-blue,\r\nthough I had closed every casement. Ourselves, choking already; then\r\ngasping; and with no time or thought to procure a mask. The chemical\r\nroom, from whence we might have secured apparatus to purify our air, had\r\nbeen abandoned before we thought to seek it out. I dashed into it, my\r\nbreath held. Its casements were open; its air thick-blue with the fumes;\r\nits staff long since fled. I ran back to Georg and Maida, gasping, my\r\nlungs on fire, my head roaring.\r\n\r\n\"No use! Abandoned!\"\r\n\r\nThe department of weather control where--had we been forewarned--we\r\nmight have found means to divert the wind by another of our own\r\ncreation--was deserted by its staff at the first alarm.\r\n\r\n\"No use! Georg--Maida--let us go!\"\r\n\r\nThe mirrors all about us in the instrument room were going dark; the\r\nhorrible scenes of death throughout the city which they pictured were\r\nvanishing. The public lights were going out; the broadcast voices were\r\nceasing.\r\n\r\nThe city now was out of control. But still the lagoon outside was\r\npacked with boats--overloaded boats.... Screams of terror, choked into\r\nsilence ... boats with frenzied occupants leaping into the water to find\r\na quicker, happier death ... a woman with a babe in her arms on a\r\nhousetop across the lagoon--the infant already dead; the crazed mother\r\nflinging it down into the water, herself following with a long, gasping\r\nscream...\r\n\r\nAt last Georg pulled at me--no longer could we speak--pulled at me, and\r\nwith Maida between us, we fled. The air outside was worse. In the\r\ndimness, our landing stage seemed _belans_ away. The flagged area\r\nbetween us and the stage--a space of square-cut metal flagging,\r\nbordering the lagoon--was littered with bodies. Dead--or dying. People\r\neven now staggering from landed boats--staggering blindly, stumbling\r\nover bodies, falling and lying always where they had fallen.\r\n\r\nWith our own senses fading, we groped our way forward. Soon we were\r\nseparated. I saw Maida fall and Georg pick her up, but I was powerless\r\nto reach them.\r\n\r\nThe landing stage seemed so far away. The dead and dying beneath my feet\r\nobstructed me as I staggered over them. A woman, reeling toward me,\r\nflung her arms about my neck with an iron grip of despair. I stared into\r\nher face, purple almost with its congested blood, her mouth gaping, her\r\nblood-shot eyes bulging; and even with the terror distorting them, I saw\r\nbeneath it their look of despairing appeal...\r\n\r\nHer arms clinging to me desperately; but with a curse I flung her to the\r\nground and reeled onward.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing it, I had come to the brink of the water's edge. The\r\nflagging seemed to drop away. I fell. Dimly I heard the splash as I\r\nstruck the water; and felt a grateful cooling sense as it closed over\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI am a strong, instinctive swimmer. I did not breathe, and when I rose\r\nto the surface, the single swift breath I took was purer than any I had\r\nhad for half an hour past. My head cleared a little; swimming\r\ninstinctively, and with cautious breaths, I found that I was able to go\r\non.\r\n\r\nI know now that by some vagary of chance--of fate if you will--I had\r\nstruck a surface area where breathable air still remained. I swam,\r\nstriving to plan, to think where I might be swimming. Yet it was all a\r\nphantasmagoria, with only the strength of my muscles and the instinct to\r\npreserve my life remaining to direct me. Swimming endlessly ... swimming\r\n... taking a half-gasp of breath ... swimming ... trying to think ... or\r\ndreaming ... was it all a dream?...\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself I was lying upon a bank of ferns in the outskirts\r\nof the city. It was still night; the black cloud of death had passed on;\r\nthe air was pure. Like a man for days bereft of water, I lay and drank\r\nin the air, pure at last, as the Almighty distils it for us.\r\n\r\nBodies were lying around me on the bank. A dark, silent house stood\r\nnearby; and a deserted boat. All darkness and silence--the brooding\r\nsilence of death. I was still dazed. Maida--Georg; they seemed like\r\npeople in a dream long faded. Industriana! They were going to the\r\n_Rhaal_ City of Industriana. _I_ had been trying to get there. I must\r\nget there now--join them. I climbed to my feet; the edge of a forest was\r\nnearby and with wavering steps I started toward it.\r\n\r\nLooking back on it now I realize that I was even then half crazed. In a\r\ndaze I must have stumbled through the forest for hours. Unreasoning,\r\nwith only that one idea--to get to Industriana; and in the background of\r\nmy consciousness the vague belief that Elza would be there to greet me.\r\nInto the depths of the untrammeled forest with unguided steps I\r\nwandered.\r\n\r\nAt last I found myself wondering if the dawn were coming; the tri-night\r\nhour was long since passed; the auroral lights as I could sometimes see\r\nthem through the tangle of vegetation overhead, were low in the sky.\r\nInsects--and sometimes larger beings--leaped and slithered unseen before\r\nmy advance. But I did not heed them. Eyes may have peered at me as I\r\nstumbled through the blackness of the undergrowth; but if they did, I\r\ndid not notice them.\r\n\r\nAnd then at last I was brought abruptly to full rationality and\r\nconsciousness. Stumbling through a tangle of low growth--a black thicket\r\nwhich tore at my garments and scratched my flesh--I was transfixed by a\r\nwoman's scream. It came through the darkness from near at hand. A\r\ncrashing of the underbrush, and a woman's scream of terror. It stopped\r\nmy breath, turned me cold.\r\n\r\nElza!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n_The Monster_\r\n\r\n\r\nI stood frozen with horror; but as my brain cleared--awake at last to\r\nfull rationality and consciousness--beneath the horror came a surging\r\njoy of the knowledge that at last Elza was near me. The scream was\r\nrepeated; inactive no longer, I dashed the thicket branches apart with\r\nmy arms and plunged forward through the darkness.\r\n\r\nAhead of me the thickets opened into a sort of clearing. I saw the sky,\r\nthe stars--paling stars with the first flush of dawn overpowering them.\r\nI stood at the edge of an open space in the dim, flat-grey illumination\r\nof morning twilight.\r\n\r\nElza! She was there, standing near a huge isolated tree; Elza, pale,\r\ntrembling, a hand pressed against her mouth in terror; disheveled, her\r\ngarments dirty and torn with her wanderings through the forest.\r\n\r\nA swift glimpse as momentarily I paused; a second or two only, but the\r\nscene was impressed upon my brain as actinic light upon a photo-screen.\r\nClose by Elza, partially behind her, I saw something small, no taller\r\nthan Elza's waist. A naked thing of sleek, glistening skin. The\r\nmonstrosity of a human child; a bulging head, wavering upon a neck\r\nincapable of supporting it; a thick round body; twisted, misshapen\r\nlimbs. A face ... human? It made my gorge rise with its gruesome\r\nsuggestion of humanity. Nostrils--no nose; a mouth, lipless, but red\r\nlike a curved gash with upturned corners to make the travesty of a grin;\r\na triangle of watery eyes, goggling. Senselessly, it stood watching Elza\r\nwith a dull, vacant curiosity. Not human, this thing! Yet monstrously\r\nrepulsive in its hideous suggestion of an idiot child.\r\n\r\nElza was not facing it; my gaze instinctively followed hers to the tree.\r\nCrowning horror! The adult of this thing upon the ground hung swaying by\r\na thick hand and arm from a low limb; hung, then dropped. Growling,\r\nmouthing as though it would try and form human words of menace, it\r\npicked itself up and shambled toward Elza.\r\n\r\nI leaped for them. Elza seemed too terrified to run. The thing reached\r\nher, towered over her; seized her in its arms. She screamed--the agony\r\nof revolt and terror; but over her voice rose my own shout of rage, and\r\nabruptly the thing dropped her and turned to confront me. Snarling,\r\nglaring with its three hideous blood-shot eyes; waving its thick, bent\r\narms.\r\n\r\nI had no weapons save those with which nature had endowed me. The regret\r\nof that came as a fleeting thought; and then I crashed into the thing;\r\nmy fist, passing its awkward guard, struck it full in the face. I\r\nsickened. Even in the heat of combat a nausea swept me. For no solid\r\nflesh and bone met my blow, like the shell of an egg, my fist crashed\r\ninto and through its face.\r\n\r\nWarm, sticky moisture ... a stench ...\r\n\r\nThe thing had toppled backward, with me sprawling upon its bloated bulk.\r\nIt struggled, writhed ... Its arms gripped me, its huge fingers clutched\r\nmy throat ... I caught a glimpse of its smashed face ... so close, I\r\nturned away ... a face of yellow-white pulp ...\r\n\r\nMy fist cracked and sank into its chest. I pounded, smashed; broke the\r\nshell of its distended body ... noisome ... the revulsion, the nausea of\r\nit all but overcame me.\r\n\r\nAt last the thing lay still; and from the wet, sticky foulness of it I\r\nrose and stood shuddering. Elza lay on the ground; but she had risen\r\nupon one elbow and I saw that she was unharmed save for the shock of\r\nterror through which she had passed--a mitigated shock with the\r\nknowledge now that I was with her, and that I too was uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe infant thing had vanished. I hastened forward.\r\n\r\n\"Elza! Elza, dear--\"\r\n\r\nJoy lighted her face.\r\n\r\n\"Jac!\"\r\n\r\nI would have lifted her up; but the consciousness of my own\r\nfoulness--the yellow-white slime streaked with red which smeared my\r\narms, splattered my clothing--gave me pause. In the growing light,\r\nbeyond the clearing, I caught the silver sheen of water. Without a word\r\nI ran for it; a shimmering pool the existence of which no doubt had\r\ndrawn these grewsome beings of the forest into its vicinity. To the\r\ncleansing water I ran, plunged in, purged myself of that horrible\r\nfoulness which human senses could not endure.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, Elza was upon her feet. Recovered at last she flung\r\nherself into my arms. Impulsive; seeking protection as she clung to me;\r\nfear; the let-down of overwrought nerves as she stood and clung and\r\nsobbed upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was all of that; but oh! it was more than that as well. My Elza,\r\nraising her tear-stained face and kissing me. Murmuring, \"Jac, I love\r\nyou!\" Murmuring her love: \"Jac dear, you're safe! I've wanted so long to\r\nbe with you again--I've been so frightened--so frightened--\"\r\n\r\nGiving me back my kisses unreserved; holding me with eager\r\narms ... Tarrano? The memory of him came to me. How foolish my fears,\r\nmy jealousy! That man of genius ... conqueror of worlds ...\r\n\r\nBut my Elza loved _me_!...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n_Industriana_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must have been two days later when at last we were rescued by the\r\n_Rhaal_ patrol and taken to Industriana. Back there in the forest I had\r\nsuddenly remembered that the mate to the thing I had killed would\r\ndoubtless be lurking in the vicinity. We fled. Subsisting on what food\r\nof the wilds we could find, at last we were picked up and taken to the\r\nCity of Work.\r\n\r\nThe Great City had been destroyed. Wanton capital of the Central State,\r\nwe learned now that it lay dead. To outward aspect, unharmed. Fair,\r\nserene, alluring as ever it lay there on its shimmering waters; but the\r\nlife within it, was dead. Refugees--a quarter perhaps of the\r\ninhabitants--had escaped; hourly the search patrols were picking them\r\nup, bringing them to Industriana. Rescue parties were searching the\r\ncity, to find any who might still be alive.\r\n\r\nAnd out in the forest lay a great pile of ashes, still exhaling a thin\r\nwisp of its deadly breath--where Tarrano had created the Black Cloud;\r\nlost his captive Elza, but doubtless had escaped himself back to his\r\nCity of Ice.\r\n\r\nWe found Georg and Maida safe at Industriana. Marvelous city! Elza had\r\nnever seen it before. She sat gazing breathless as from the air on the\r\npatrol vessel, we approached it.\r\n\r\nThe land of this region was a black, rocky soil upon which vegetation\r\nwould not grow. A rolling land, grimly black, metallic; with\r\noutcroppings of ore, red and white and with occasional patches of thin\r\nwhite sand whereon a prickly blue grass struggled for life.\r\n\r\nRolling hills; and then places where nature had upheaved into a turmoil.\r\nHuge naked black crags; buttes; hills with precipitous black sides of\r\nsleek metal; narrow canyons with tumultuous water flowing through them.\r\n\r\nIn such a place stood Industriana. The City of Work! Set in an area\r\nwhere nature lay scarred, twisted in convulsion, its buildings clung to\r\nevery conceivable slope and in every position. Many-storied\r\nbuildings--residences and factories indiscriminately intermingled. All\r\nbuilt in sober, solid rectangles of the forbidding black stone.\r\n\r\nA long steep slope from an excavated quarry deep in the ground, ran\r\nstraight up to a commanding hilltop--the slope set with an orderly array\r\nof buildings clinging to it in terraces. Buildings huge, or tiny huts;\r\nall anchored in the rear to the ground, and set upon metal girders in\r\nthe front. Bisecting the slope was a vertical street--a broad escalator\r\nof moving steps, one half going upward, the other down. Beside it, a\r\nseries of other escalators for the traffic of moving merchandise.\r\n\r\nCross streets on the hill were spider bridges, clinging with thin, stiff\r\nlegs. And at the summit of the hill stood a tremendous funnel belching\r\nflame and smoke into the sky.\r\n\r\nTo one side of the hill lay a bowl-like depression with a single squat\r\nbuilding in its center--a low building of many funnels; and about it the\r\nblack yawning mouths of shafts down into the ground--mines vomiting ore,\r\nbroken chunks of the metallic rock coming up as though by the invisible\r\nmagic of magnetism, hunting through the air in an arc to fall with a\r\nclatter into great bins above the smelter.\r\n\r\nIn another place, at the bottom of a canyon roared a surging torrent of\r\nriver. A harnessed river; plunging into turbines; emerging to tumble\r\nover a cascade, its every drop caught by turning buckets spilled again\r\nat the bottom. Water pursuing its surging course downward, its power\r\nused again and again. The canyon dry at one place near the lower edge of\r\nthe city, the water all electrified, resolved into piped hydrogen and\r\noxygen. Like a tremendous clock ticking, the water, momentarily dammed\r\nback, was released in a torrent to the electrolysis vats. The hissing\r\ngases, under tremendous pressure, raised up the heavy-weighted tops of\r\ntwo expanding tanks. Another tick of this giant clock--the gases\r\nreleased, were merged again to water. The tops of the tanks lowered,\r\neach in turn, one coming down as the other went up--hundreds of tons of\r\nweight--their slow downward pull geared to scores of whirling\r\nwheels--the power shifted to dynamos scattered throughout the city.\r\n\r\nIt was the twilight of nightfall when we arrived over Industriana. A\r\nthousand funnels and chimneys belched their flame and smoke--the flame\r\ntinting the sky with a lurid yellow-green glare, the smoke hanging like\r\na dim blue gauze through which everything seemed unreal, infernal.\r\n\r\nFrom the city rose a roar--the myriad sounds of industry mingled by the\r\nmagic of distance. And as we got closer, the roar resolved into its\r\ncomponent parts; the grinding of gears; clicking of belts and chains;\r\nwhirring of dynamos and motors; shrill electrical screams; the\r\nclattering of falling ore; clanking of swiftly moving merchandise, bound\r\nin metal, magnetized to monorail cars shifting it to warehouses on the\r\nnearby hills. And over it all flashed the brilliant signal lights of the\r\nmerchandise traffic directors whose stentorian electrical voices\r\nbroadcasting commands sounded above the city's noises.\r\n\r\nAn inferno of activity. A seeming confusion; yet the aspect of confusion\r\nwas a fallacy, for beneath it lay a precision--an orderly precision as\r\ncalm and exact as the mind of the Director of a Signal Tower counting\r\noff the split seconds of his beams.\r\n\r\nAn orderly precision--the brain of one man guiding and dominating\r\neverything; at his desk alone for long hours throughout the days and\r\nnights. A quiet, grey-haired gentleman; unhurried, unharassed, seemingly\r\nalmost inactive; always seated at his empty desk smoking endless\r\narrant-cylinders. The dominating business brain of Industriana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n_Departure_\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorg and Maida were very busy in Industriana; and now Elza and I were\r\nadmitted to their activities--Elza and I, with our new-found love and\r\nhappiness neglected for the greater thing, the welfare of the nation\r\nupon which hinged the very safety of Venus itself; and Mars; and our own\r\nfair Earth.\r\n\r\nIndustriana, greatest commercial and manufacturing center of Venus, had\r\nbeen given over momentarily to the preparations for war. The _Rhaals_\r\nhad at last turned from industry to the conquest of Tarrano.\r\nPreparations were almost completed; our armies were to start within a\r\nvery few times of sleep.\r\n\r\nI had had no experience in warfare; but the history of our Earth had\r\ntold me much of it. The enlisting and training of huge armies of men;\r\narming them; artillery; naval and air forces; commissary and supplies; a\r\ngigantic business organization to equip, move and maintain millions of\r\nfighting men.\r\n\r\nAncient warfare! This--our modern way--was indeed dissimilar. It was,\r\nfrom most aspects, simplicity itself. We had no need of men in great\r\nnumbers. I found something like a single thousand of men being organized\r\nand trained. And equipped with weapons to outward aspects comparatively\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nOn all the three worlds the age of explosives of the sort history\r\nrecords, was long since passed. Electronic weapons--all basically the\r\nsame. And I found now that it was the power for them, developed,\r\ntransformed into its various characteristics and stored for individual\r\ntransportation and use, which was mainly engrossing Industriana.\r\n\r\nI had opportunity, that first night, of meeting Geno-Rhaalton--the\r\npresent head of that famous Rhaalton line, for generations hereditary\r\nleaders of their race.\r\n\r\nWe found him, this Geno-Rhaalton, in a secluded, somber little office of\r\nblack metallic walls, grey hangings and rug, a block of carved stone his\r\ndesk, and a few of the stiff-backed stone chairs, each with its single\r\nprim cushion.\r\n\r\nThe office was beyond sight and sound of the busy city. His desk was\r\nempty, save for the array of apparatus around its edges--the clicking\r\ntabulators which recorded, sorted, analyzed and summarized for him every\r\nminute detail with which the city was engaged.\r\n\r\nMachines of business detail. We had them, of course, in the Inter-Allied\r\noffices of Greater New York. I have seen our Divisional Director voice\r\ninto a mouthpiece the demand for some statistical summary computed up to\r\nfive minutes before, and covering his entire Atlantic Division. He would\r\nhave it, recorded in cold print before him, within a moment.\r\n\r\nYet, compared to the Rhaalton efficiency, our own methods seemed\r\nantiquated indeed. This man was in touch with every transpiring detail\r\nsimultaneously; yet not confused by them, for every detail was also\r\ncombined into a whole--to be examined for itself if he wished. Visually\r\nas well, the entire city lay before his gaze--the walls of the office\r\nwere lined with rows and tiers of small mirrors; receivers and\r\nmouthpieces connected him with everything. Sights, sounds, and even\r\nsmells of the various factories were available to him--smells when his\r\nsense of smell might be necessary for the testing of some elusive gas.\r\n\r\nWithout moving his physical body his presence was in effect transported\r\nwherever throughout the city he wished to be. A man of tremendous\r\nconcentration, to handle but one thing at a time; with all the power of\r\nhis brain to give instant decision, and then to forget it utterly.\r\n\r\nI found him a rather small man; smooth-shaven; grey-haired; a grave face\r\nand demeanor, with dark eyes solemn with thought, yet twinkling often\r\nwhen he spoke. A man of flabby muscles and gentle voice; seemingly\r\nunforceful, and with a personality likable, but hardly dominating.\r\n\r\nInstinctively I found myself comparing him to Tarrano. Tarrano's strong,\r\nwiry body. The flash of his eye; his inscrutability, always suggesting\r\nmenace; the power, the genius of his personality--the force radiating\r\nfrom him which no one could mistake. His intellectual power--his\r\nconcentration--certainly the equal of this little leader of the\r\n_Rhaals_.\r\n\r\nTarrano the Conqueror! Tarrano--man of destiny--risen from nothing and\r\nby the sheer genius of his will throwing three worlds into chaos, at one\r\nstage combining two worlds into his self-created Empire; and menacing\r\nthe third. Surely Tarrano was a greater man than this Rhaalton. I knew\r\nit; much as I hated Tarrano I was forced to admit it.\r\n\r\nYet as I stood there acknowledging the soft-spoken greeting of Rhaalton,\r\nI had the swift premonition that Tarrano was going down into defeat. And\r\nthat this little man, without moving from his desk or raising his voice,\r\nwould be the main factor in bringing it about.\r\n\r\nAnd I wondered why such a thing could be. I know why now. Tarrano, with\r\nall his genius, lacked just one quality which this little man had in\r\nabundance. The milk of human kindness--humanity--a radiating force the\r\nessence of which paradoxically was the unforceful gentleness of him. The\r\nAlmighty--as we each of us in our hearts must envisage our God--is just,\r\nbut gentle, humane in His justness. And with all the genius in the\r\nuniverse--the war-like power--the weapons--the cohorts--all the\r\nwonderful armament of war--you cannot transgress the Will of the\r\nAlmighty. Against all human logic of what should be victory--you will\r\nmeet defeat....\r\n\r\nThe thoughts fled through my mind and vanished into the realities of the\r\npresent. Rhaalton was saying:\r\n\r\n\"We will be ready within another time of sleep. Jac Hallen, you wish, I\r\nsuppose, to go out with our forces?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"The eagerness of youth for danger! And yet is very\r\nnecessary--very laudable--\"\r\n\r\nHe passed a hand across his forehead with a weary gesture--a gesture\r\nwhich seemed to me despondent. Could this be our vaunted leader? My\r\nheart sank.\r\n\r\nHe added abruptly: \"We shall conquer this Tarrano--but at what cost!\"\r\nHis smile was wistful. \"We must choose the lesser evil.\"\r\n\r\nStill gently, almost sorrowfully, but with a directness and clarity of\r\nthought which amazed me, he plunged into a detailed account of what\r\nGeorg was to do in command of our forces. My own part in it, already\r\nplanned by him in detail. Maida's part. Elza's. The division of _Rhaal_\r\nmaidens.\r\n\r\nGirlhood in war! It seemed very strange. Yet the _Rhaal_ maidens were\r\ngoing as a matter of course, since there were some activities for which\r\nthey were more fitted than the men. With all the _Rhaal_ maidens going,\r\nElza and Maida would not stay behind. And though Maida--a wife--was\r\nobjected to by Rhaalton, he had yielded finally to her pleading.\r\n\r\nI will not now detail our plans or our armament. We had, in general, one\r\nthousand unmarried men, in five divisions of two hundred each. They were\r\nlargely _Rhaals_, with the few Earth men previously sent us; fifty\r\nperhaps of the most loyal _slaans_; and a scattering of the other races\r\nof the Venus Central State. A few--thirty perhaps--of the Little People\r\nof Mars. In addition, another hundred men, individually in charge of the\r\nlarger apparatus and the vehicles. And the division of two hundred\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nOur journey to the Cold Country was to be made on flying platforms and\r\nvehicles of various sizes; some large to carry fifty passengers or more;\r\nothers so small that only one person could be carried. These latter, the\r\ngirls were to use. I call them platforms. In this size they were not,\r\nliterally speaking, much more than the transporting mechanism fastened\r\nto the girl's waist.\r\n\r\nThere were also heavier vehicles carrying the larger apparatus; and\r\nseveral of fairly large size with food, clothing, housing\r\nequipment--supplies of all kinds for our maintenance abroad. A dozen\r\nvehicles also carrying huge skeleton towers, encircled at the top with\r\nray projectors. A vehicle with a single room--an instrument room fully\r\nequipped by means of which Geno-Rhaalton at his desk would be in contact\r\nwith our every move. And largest vehicle of all--in aspect a solid,\r\nsquat affair almost of a size for inter-planetary travel--our power\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nWe started at dawn of the second morning after my own arrival in\r\nIndustriana. The girls were to travel to the borders of the Cold Country\r\non the larger vehicles, but they wished to start flying individually for\r\nthe first few helans of the journey for practice. Georg, Maida, Elza and\r\nI were to travel in the instrument room.\r\n\r\nWe massed upon a broad hilltop near the city. In the grey twilight of\r\ndawn with a flush of pink in the sky where the sun in a few moments\r\nwould rise, I stood in the outer doorway of the instrument vehicle.\r\nAround me was the confusion of departure. Eager young men; laughing\r\ngirls, flushed with excitement. The gayety of youth going to war! Young\r\nas I was myself, I was struck with the drama, the pathos of it. What\r\nwould the home-coming be?\r\n\r\nGeorg, Maida and Elza were with me. Geno-Rhaalton stepped up to us.\r\nBare-headed. A solemn little man, heavy-hearted.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by,\" he said simply. \"I know you will do your best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jac! Look there!\"\r\n\r\nI followed Elza's startled gesture to the soft, white clouds which were\r\nmassed in the sky above us. By what magic of science the thing was\r\naccomplished, I know not; but up there in the clouds a gigantic image of\r\nTarrano was materializing! His head and shoulders. Arms folded; his face\r\nwith a sardonic smile leering down at us! Lips moving. And out of the\r\nair about us came his audible, broadcasting words.\r\n\r\n_\"Do your best, my friends!\"_ Ironic mockery! _\"Coming to conquer\r\nTarrano? Hasten! You are keeping Tarrano waiting most impatiently!\"_\r\n\r\nThe giant voice died away into silence; the huge image melted into the\r\nclouds and vanished.\r\n\r\nRhaalton looked at us again, expressionless. \"Good-by,\" he repeated. \"Do\r\nyour best.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned away abruptly. And then as he walked with a despondent droop,\r\nI saw his shoulders suddenly straighten. He flung a hand into the air.\r\nThe signal to start! From a tower in Industriana a puff of violet light\r\nshot up to magnify the signal.\r\n\r\nThe girls, all in their places, rose into the air. Draperies fluttering,\r\nlike graceful birds they rose, circled over us in an arc; and then in a\r\nlong, single line, with officers apart to one side marking them in\r\nsquads of twenty, they sped into the dimness of distance.\r\n\r\nThe tower vehicles now were rising. Then the larger platform; the power\r\nplant, like a floating building sailing majestically up.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Jac.\"\r\n\r\nElza and Maida were inside the instrument room gazing through one of its\r\nwindows; and Georg drew me within, closing the transparent door after\r\nus. Through the windows I could see the line of vehicles following after\r\nthe girls. Then our instrument room rose quietly, soundlessly. The\r\nground dropped slowly away, then faster; and as we swung about I saw the\r\nhilltop beneath us. Its sides were lined with waving spectators;\r\nstricken momentarily with awe at the apparition of Tarrano, they had\r\nalready forgotten it; from every vantage point of Industriana they were\r\nfrantically waving.\r\n\r\nBut the hilltop was empty, save for one lone figure--Geno-Rhaalton\r\nstanding sorrowfully gazing after us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n_First Assault_\r\n\r\n\r\nOur spies had informed us that of recent weeks there had arisen about\r\nthe City of Ice a huge wall behind which Tarrano would make his stand.\r\nIt was our plan to approach within range of this and establish our power\r\nplant as a base from which to direct our offensive. The trip from the\r\nGreat City was not long. After a few helans our girls ceased flying\r\nindividually and boarded their appointed vehicles.\r\n\r\nIn a long single line, armament platforms, the towers, our instrument\r\nroom, with the power plant bringing up the rear, we sailed forward.\r\nThere were in our instrument vehicle, Maida, Georg, Elza and myself, the\r\nvehicle manned by two pilots and two mechanicians--a _slaan_, a Mars\r\nman, and two Earth men. We were in constant communication with\r\nGeno-Rhaalton. And though he enjoined upon us all the necessity for\r\nsleeping or resting during the trip, himself sat alert at his desk,\r\nunrelaxing. The little mirror on our table showed him sitting there,\r\nwatching every move we made.\r\n\r\nWe laid down to rest, but sleep was impossible. Through the panelled\r\ntransparent floor, I watched the country changing as we advanced;\r\nvegetation dwindling; the soil changing to rocky barrenness at the\r\nborder of the Cold Country. And then the snow-plains, the mute frozen\r\nrivers of ice, the mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the twilight of the Cold Country autumn, we sailed up to the\r\nmountains and approached to the City of Ice. Alert, all of us now, as at\r\nan altitude of a few thousand feet we circled about, marking time until\r\nthe power plant had selected its base and landed to make ready for the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThroughout the trip we had expected--had anticipated the possibility--of\r\na surprise attack by Tarrano; an ambush in the open air, perhaps\r\nby some means strange to us. But the vision magnifiers, the\r\nmicrophones--encompassing every known range of sight and sound--showed\r\nus nothing. Especially at the mountains we had thought to meet\r\nopposition. But at first none came. It seemed somehow ominous, this lack\r\nof action from Tarrano; and when the leader of our line--a tower\r\nvehicle--rose sharply to scale the jagged peaks of the Divide, the flare\r\nof a hostile electronic bomb rising came almost as a relief. From the\r\ninstrument room--forewarned an instant by the hiss of our microphones--I\r\nsaw the bomb start upward. Slowly as a rocket it mounted--a blurred ball\r\nof glowing violet light, quite plain in the dim twilight. I knew that\r\nthe tower platform at which it was directed would have time to throw out\r\nits insulation; I knew that the insulation would doubtless be\r\neffective--yet my heart leaped nevertheless. At my hand was a projector;\r\nbut in those few seconds the tower just in advance of us in the line was\r\nquicker. Its ray darted at the violet ball; the soundless explosion\r\nthrew a wave of sparks about the menaced tower, like a puff--a pricked\r\nbubble of soap-film--the violet ball was dissipated. But I saw the\r\nmenaced tower rock a trifle from the shock.\r\n\r\nGeno-Rhaalton's face in the mirror beside me was very solemn. I heard\r\nhim murmuring something to the other towers, saw their light flash\r\ndownward, searching the mountain defiles. And as I watched that little\r\nimage of Rhaalton, I chanced to notice a mirror on Rhaalton's desk.\r\nRhaalton himself was looking at it--a mirror which had been dark, but\r\nwhich now flashed on. An outlaw circuit! The mirror imaged the face of\r\nTarrano. Tarrano grinning ironically!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n_Invisible Assailants_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did not locate the source of the bomb, and no others rose to assail\r\nus. The mountain defiles, so far as our lights could illuminate them,\r\nseemed deserted. We passed over the Divide, and on the plateau beyond,\r\nwe landed. A region of rolling country beneath its snow and ice. The\r\nmountains came down sharply to the inner plain--a crescent of mountain\r\nrange stretching off into the dimness of distance, half encircling this\r\nwhite plateau in the center of which stood the City of Ice. We could\r\njust see it at the horizon, the glittering spires of its Ice Palace.\r\n\r\nAround the city, completely enveloping it, was a thick circular wall of\r\nice twenty times the height of a man. We were too far away to see it\r\nplainly--a turreted wall doubtless armed with projectors throughout its\r\ncircular length. Our finders would not show it, for it was insulated\r\nagainst them. It stood there grey-white, bleak and apparently deserted.\r\n\r\nGeorg said: \"It's the man's accursed inactivity! Is he going to do\r\nnothing?... Our power plant has landed, Jac--there in the foothills--see\r\nit drop?\" A call from Rhaalton took his attention.\r\n\r\nWe landed our entire force in the foothills of the mountains. The power\r\nplant was there; it looked like a squat industrial building set upon a\r\nledge of ice--a shining cliff-face behind it, a precipice in front. At\r\nthe foot of the precipice our other vehicles were clustered.\r\n\r\nWe were there throughout three entire times of sleep, hours strangely\r\nthe same in that unaltered polar twilight. During them, with the tower\r\nplatforms set in a ring about us to make an armed camp, we unloaded our\r\napparatus, erected our power controls, prepared the individual circuits,\r\nmaking ready for our offensive. And still--though we, were alert for\r\nit--no move from Tarrano.\r\n\r\nThey were hours during which, with my lack of technical knowledge, I\r\nfound myself often with nothing to do. Our camp was bustling with\r\nactivity, but among the now idle girls and many of the young men, there\r\nwas an air of gayety. They laughed, shouted, played games amid the rocks\r\nfrom which we had long since melted the snow. Once, in what would have\r\nbeen early evening had not the Sun in these latitudes held level like a\r\nburned-out ball near the horizon, Elza and I wandered from the camp to\r\nclimb the cliffs nearby.\r\n\r\nBeyond the circle of the camp's heat, the deadly cold of the region\r\nassailed us. We had not wished to equip with the individual heating,\r\nwhich for battle would leave us free of heavy garments; instead we\r\nswathed ourselves in furs, with the exercise of climbing to aid us in\r\nkeeping warm.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful to be again alone with Elza. Even with what was\r\nimpending we were young enough to put it momentarily from our minds.\r\nLike young lovers clandestinely stealing away to a tryst, we left the\r\ncamp and hand in hand, climbed up amid the crags. A few hundred feet to\r\none side of the power house, and about the same distance above it, we\r\nsat down at last to rest.\r\n\r\nThe scene from here was picturesque in the extreme. Across the flat,\r\nshadowless snowy plain was the wall of ice with the city behind it. All\r\nin the far distance, this city wherein our enemy was entrenched; and\r\nthere were no lights, no movement that we could see. In that drab\r\ntwilight, it seemed almost unreal.\r\n\r\nThe plain too, was empty. A few palpably deserted huts, nothing else.\r\nBeneath us, snugly anchored there on the ledge, was our power house. No\r\nunreality here. Its aerials were mounted; its external dynamos were\r\nvisibly revolving; from its windows blue shafts of light slanted out;\r\nand from it rose the low hum of active power.\r\n\r\nBelow it, spread over the slightly sloping area of foothill beneath us,\r\nlay our encampment. A ring of our tower vehicles, with their projectors\r\nmounted and ready, their colored search-beams slowly sweeping the white\r\nplain and the dead grey sky. Within their ring, the camp itself. Lighted\r\nby the blue-white tubes set upon quadrupeds at intervals; heated by\r\nstrings of red-glowing wire and the red wire-balls used on Venus. The\r\nsnow and ice on the ground within the camp had melted, exposing the\r\nnaked rock.\r\n\r\nA scene of blue and red lights and shifting shadows; bustling with\r\nactivity--figures, tiny from this height, hurrying about. The sounds\r\nfrom it rose to us; the low hum and snap of the weapons being tested;\r\nthe shouted commands; and sometimes, mingled with it, the laughing shout\r\nof a light-hearted girl.\r\n\r\nElza clung close to me. \"Everything will be ready soon.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded. \"They're going to mount a ray up here on the cliff. Grolier\r\nwas telling me, for permanent protection--to stay here with the power\r\nhouse when we go out to the attack.\"\r\n\r\nSilent with her thoughts she did not answer me. Sidewise, I regarded her\r\nsolemn little face encased in its hood of fur. And then clumsily, for\r\nour furs were heavy and awkward, I put my arm about her.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Elza. It's worth a great deal to be here alone with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jac, what will he do?\" Her gaze was to the far-off City of Ice. \"It\r\nseems so--so sinister, Jac, this silence from him. This inactivity. It\r\nis not like him to be inactive.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's there,\" I said. \"Rolltar the Mars man--boastful fellow,\r\nblow-hard--he was telling some of us that in his opinion Tarrano had\r\nalready run away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" she exclaimed. \"This is his last stand. He'll make it\r\nhere--defeat us here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Elza!\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced momentarily at me, smiled a queer smile, and then gazed once\r\nmore over the distant plain. \"I do not mean I think he'll defeat us,\r\nJac. I mean, that is his reasoning--make his last stand here--\"\r\n\r\n\"He hasn't run away,\" I repeated. \"I told Rolltar so. We got an outlaw\r\nconnection into the Ice Palace today. For a moment only, and then it was\r\ndiscovered and broken off. But we had the image for a moment--it chanced\r\nto show Tarrano himself. But he's isolated now. Bretan said his\r\nisolation power--around the Ice Palace and the wall anyway--is greater\r\nthan any image-ray we can send against it.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart leaped suddenly, for I saw Elza's eyes widen, fear spring to\r\nher face; heard the sharp intake of her breath, and felt her hand grip\r\nmy arm.\r\n\r\n\"Jac! There's something wrong! See there? And you hear it?\"\r\n\r\nFrom the instrument room I heard a vague drumming. A hiss, and then a\r\ndrumming growing louder. It was not a new sound, for now I remembered I\r\nhad been conscious of it for several moments past. Our encampment was\r\nawake to it! A confusion down there; people running about; a figure\r\ndashing wildly into the instrument room. And the aerials on the power\r\nhouse began to snap viciously.\r\n\r\n\"Jac! What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. See there, Elza? The sub-ray lights!\"\r\n\r\nThe search-beams from our towers were inordinately active. Sweeping the\r\nempty snow-plain and the empty sky. Empty? To my fevered imagination\r\nthey were peopled with enemies. And then one of the towers flashed on a\r\nsub-ray--the dull infra-red for envisaging the slow rays below the power\r\nof human sight. And another tower with its faint purple beam was using\r\nthe ultra-violet.\r\n\r\n\"That drumming, Elza! That's a microphone--the big one they just erected\r\nnear the instrument room. There's something coming! That's the magnified\r\nsound of some distant rush of air. Very faint sound, but they must have\r\nheard it on the ear-phones long ago. That microphone must have just been\r\nconnected--\"\r\n\r\nSomething coming? We could see nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go down, Jac! We must get back--\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got infra-red glasses--\" I fumbled beneath my furs. But I did not\r\nhave them.\r\n\r\n\"Jac--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, Elza.\"\r\n\r\nMy glasses would have been useless, for the sub and ultra beams from the\r\ntowers were disclosing nothing. I could tell that by the hasty searching\r\nsweeps they made. And then from the big Wilton tower, the newly\r\nconnected Zed-ray flashed on, I could hear the load of it in the\r\ndeepened, throaty hum from the power house. Its dirty brown beam sprayed\r\nout over the plain; then swung to the sky, caught something, hung\r\nmotionless, narrowed into great intensity. The powerful Zed-ray,\r\ncapturing the visibility of dense solids only.[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Similar doubtless to our present-day X-ray.]\r\n\r\nThere was something up there in the sky! The Zed-ray met resistance; we\r\ncould see the sparks, and hear the snap of them coming like a roar from\r\nthe microphone above the drumming. Met the resistance and conquered it;\r\ngradually the snapping roar died away.\r\n\r\n\"Jac! I see something! Something there--don't you see it?\"\r\n\r\nA luminous blur became visible in the nearer sky--moving blobs of silver\r\nluminosity in the mud-brown light of the Zed-ray. A hundred or more\r\nmoving silver blobs. They were taking form. The silvery phosphorescent\r\nlook faded, became grey-white. Took definite shape. Waving arms and\r\nlegs! Bones bereft of flesh. Human skeletons! Limbs waving rhythmically.\r\nBony arms, with fingers clutching metal weapons. Assailants coming at us\r\nthrough the air, stripped by the Zed-ray of clothing, skin, flesh,\r\norgans, to the naked bone. Skeletons with skulls of empty eye-sockets\r\nand set jaw-bones to make the travesty of human faces grim with menace!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n_Attack on the Power House_\r\n\r\n\r\nStricken with surprise and awe, Elza and I sat there motionless. Our\r\nencampment was in a turmoil of confusion--chaos, out of which very soon\r\norder came. The skeleton figures in the air--I saw now that there were\r\nnearer two hundred than one hundred--were perhaps two thousand feet\r\naway, and at an altitude of about the cliff-ledge where Elza and I were\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nThey swept forward, bathed in the Zed-ray with all our other\r\nsearch-beams darkened to give it full sway. Momentarily I saw them\r\nclearer; metallic cylinders in bony fingers, and a metal mechanism of\r\nflight encasing, yet not touching the ribs.\r\n\r\n\"Jac! Why don't our rays--\"\r\n\r\nAs though to answer Elza's unfinished question, one of our towers turned\r\na disintegrating ray upon them. A narrow pencil-point of light, barely\r\nvisible in this flat daylight. It swung up into our Zed-ray, searched\r\nand clung to one of the skeleton figures. Had it penetrated, the man\r\nwould have been dissipated like a puff of vapor. But it did not; and\r\nthen I knew that for that distance at least, this enemy's isolation\r\npower--individual barrage--was too great.\r\n\r\nYet the assailed figure wavered! Our amplifier gave out his shout--half\r\nfear, half admonition. The line of skeletons swung upward. Came on, but\r\nmounted so that I saw that they were making for the summit of the cliff\r\nabove us--above our power house.\r\n\r\nTheir defense--invisibility, and a mere isolation barrage so that we\r\ncould not harm them with our tower rays while they kept beyond range.\r\nBut what was their means of attack? Why would Tarrano....\r\n\r\n\"The power house,\" Elza answered; and I realized then that she had read\r\nmy thoughts. The power house, if they could demolish it....\r\n\r\nOur thoughts, questions and answers unspoken, flew fast; but the drama\r\nbefore us unfolded faster. With the knowledge that we could see them,\r\nthese invaders cast aside a portion of their equipment to give them\r\ngreater freedom. We could see the metal portions of the trappings\r\nfalling like plummets. The skeleton images faded; and then as our tower\r\nwithdrew the Zed-ray and our search-beams picked them up, we saw our\r\nenemies as they really were. Men clothed in a casing of cylindrical\r\ngarments with the flying mechanisms strapped to their chests; some with\r\nvisors and headpieces, nearly all with small weapons in their hands.\r\n\r\nKeeping well away, they continued to mount. They were striving for the\r\npinnacle of cliff-tops above us; but as our rays darted at them they\r\nhalted, wavered; and now when nearly above the camp, they began mounting\r\nstraight up.\r\n\r\n\"Jac! Look there!\"\r\n\r\nOne of our tower vehicles was preparing to rise. Its ray, following the\r\nsearch-beams upward, was aimed at the invaders, but they were beyond its\r\neffective range. Their weapons of attack? I knew now.\r\n\r\n\"Suicides!\"\r\n\r\nWhether Elza said it, or merely thought it I do not know. One of the\r\nfigures came down as though falling. A few seconds only; but though our\r\nsearch-beam showed it, the smaller rays for those seconds missed it.\r\nDown--until no more than five hundred feet above us it checked its fall.\r\nA giant of a man; and with his hand cylinder--in range now--he shot a\r\nbolt at our power house. It struck; I could see the flash, saw an aerial\r\nshatter before the charge went harmlessly into the body of the building.\r\nThen one of our rays caught the man; his figure crumpled; the shower of\r\nsparks as his barrage was broken, exploded like a tiny bursting bomb;\r\nand as the sparks died, there was nothing where the man had been.\r\n\r\nA suicide; but one of our aerials was shattered. And then others came\r\ndown--not many, for it was grim business and the courage of them must\r\nhave failed at the last. Falling bodies; tiny bolts striking the power\r\nhouse; the sparks--then empty air where living men had been.\r\n\r\nOur tower left the ground. Some of our men, with small flying platforms\r\nstrapped to them, were crowding its top. Its beams preceded it--but I\r\nsaw the beams breaking intermittently as the bolts struck the power\r\nhouse. The invaders wavered with indecision. Some of them came down to\r\nvoluntary death; others strove for the cliff-top; some took flight. Our\r\ntower swept into them; one of them, injured but not annihilated, fell\r\nwith a crash into the encampment.\r\n\r\nAbove Elza and me was a maze of flashing beams; futile bolts; the puffs\r\nof myriad sparks. A bolt seemed to strike quite near where we were\r\nsitting; I drew Elza back and we crouched in the hollow of a rock. A\r\nbody came hurtling down, crashed to the cliff-ledge almost at our feet\r\nwith the sickening thump of mangled flesh and broken bones--hung an\r\ninstant to give me a momentary glimpse of a face contorted in death\r\nagony; then rolled over and fell further down the jagged cliff.\r\n\r\nThen above us presently there was silence and the drab empty sky. Our\r\ntower was back beyond the cliff-top. Soon it appeared; apparently\r\nunharmed, it came dropping down to its former place on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe first attack was over. And off in the distance a few solitary\r\nfigures were winging their way back to the City of Ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n_City of Ice Besieged_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were not greatly harmed by this surprise attack; the power house was\r\nsuperficially damaged, but soon repaired. That night--I call it that\r\nthough the constant weak daylight made the term incongruous--activity\r\nshowed in the City of Ice.\r\n\r\nIt came with a vertical spray of light rising from the ice wall which\r\nencircled the city. Spreading light beams rising from points a hundred\r\nfeet apart along the wall. The beams spread fan-shape, so that within\r\nfifty feet above their source they met and merged into a thin sheet of\r\neffulgence rising into the sky. Tarrano's barrage.\r\n\r\nIt seemed then that beyond suicidal sorties of the kind we had just\r\nrepulsed, Tarrano was planning to stand purely on the defensive. It was\r\nour own plan to surround the city with our towers; even those on the\r\nfurther side would be within range of our power house; and with the city\r\nthus beleaguered, we would attack the wall from every side at once.\r\n\r\nWe tested now this barrage Tarrano had thrown up. Sprays of its\r\ninsulated area came down to protect the wall in front; and protected\r\nalso the triangular spaces between the sources of the main beams.\r\nTentatively one of our towers approached within range; but our rays only\r\nbeat into the barrage with the hiss of molten metal plunged into water,\r\nand with a burst of interference sparks. Even at a horizontal thousand\r\nfeet we could do nothing. Then we tried altitude. Our projectors,\r\nmounted individually on small platforms automatically controlled to fly\r\nwithout human pilot, went up and we strove to get them over the barrage.\r\n\r\nAt five thousand feet one went over safely. But the electronic bomb it\r\ndropped into the city was an easy mark for Tarrano's watchful defense\r\nrays. He exploded it harmlessly when it was still high above him.\r\n\r\nAfter the next time of sleep we invested the city. Our towers were set\r\nin a ring about it, two thousand feet from the wall. They were mobile\r\nunits, ready to sail forward or back or upward at any moment. Georg\r\nstayed in command of the instrument room. It was never placed, but\r\nsailed continuously in slow circular flight around the city above our\r\nline. The power house remained in its place, with our largest projector\r\nmounted on the cliff beside it in order to frustrate any further\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nThey were solemn moments as we broke our encampment. The girls, far more\r\nagile in the air than men, were lightly dressed, with the supporting\r\nmechanism strapped to them. The heating units enveloped them in an\r\ninvisible cloak of warm air. To their left arms a strapped cylinder gave\r\noff a fan-shape area of insulation--an almost invisible shield of\r\nprotective barrage some five feet long. It showed as a faint glow of\r\nlight; and in flight their left arms could swing it like a shield to\r\nprotect their bodies. They had telephonic ear-pieces available; a tiny\r\nmirror fastened to their chests to face them, upon which Georg or\r\nGeno-Rhaalton could project images; a mouthpiece for talking to Georg;\r\nand a belt of offensive weapons, useful within a range of five hundred\r\nfeet but no further.\r\n\r\nVery alert and agile, twisting and turning in the air were these girls.\r\nWe men were similarly equipped, but our movements in the air were\r\nheavier, clumsier. Elza and I had practiced with the others for days;\r\nand with our harmless duelling rays I had found that I could never hope\r\nto hit her while she dealt me mortal blows.\r\n\r\nElza, commanding a squad of twenty girls, was assigned to a portion of\r\nthe line some helans from me. My own place, with a hundred men under me,\r\nwas near a tower almost on the opposite side from the power house.\r\n\r\nIt was a solemn parting from Elza. I wrapped her in my arms, tried to\r\nsmile. \"Be very--careful, Elza.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed me, clung to me; then cast me off and was gone.\r\n\r\nWith the city invested, we rested idly for another time of sleep.\r\nOccasionally we made a tentative tower attack which came to nothing.\r\nTarrano waited; his barrage remained the same. We tried to provoke a\r\nmove from him, but could not.\r\n\r\nThe snow-plain where I was stationed here was similar to the other side,\r\nsave that there were no mountains. From the power house to Tarrano's\r\nwall there was a dip, so that the wall stood upon higher ground. On my\r\nside, however, the reverse was true. The wall lay in a hollow in one\r\nplace, with a steady upward slope back from it to uplands behind us, as\r\nthough in some better day a broad watercourse had flowed down here, now\r\nlong since buried in solid ice and snow.\r\n\r\nI mention this topography because it had a vital bearing upon what so\r\nsoon was to transpire.\r\n\r\nRhaalton desired that Tarrano come out and attack us; but Tarrano would\r\nnot. We thought perhaps that his offense was inadequate and the one move\r\nthat he made strengthened that belief. From the city beside the palace,\r\na rectangle of black metal some fifty feet square, rose slowly up. In\r\naspect it was a square, windowless room--a room without a ceiling, open\r\nat the top. It rose to a height of five hundred feet and hung level. And\r\nfrom it depended dangling power cables connecting it with the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was the presence of these cables that made us feel Tarrano was\r\noffensively weak. He could not aerially transport his power; hence, for\r\noffense he could only rely upon individual batteries which, unless\r\npermanently stationed within the city, we knew would have a short range\r\nat best. We watched this thing in the air for hours. It did not move; it\r\nwas soundless. What was its purpose? We could not guess.\r\n\r\nAnd then at last, Geno-Rhaalton ordered us all to the attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n_Battle_\r\n\r\n\r\nI found myself in the air; with my men around me we hovered. Then\r\nGeorg's command from the instrument room sounded in my ears. I gave the\r\nsignal; and flying wedge-shaped, we hurled ourselves forward. It was\r\nlike lying on the air, diving head foremost. The rush of wind sang past\r\nme; the ground, a hundred feet below, was a white surface flowing\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\nWe were heading for the base of one of Tarrano's barrage projectors. It\r\nwas mounted within the wall; but the wall itself was protected merely by\r\na fan-shaped subsidiary beam--a weaker barrage over that small area,\r\nwhich by concentrated effort we hoped to break.\r\n\r\nFrom a helan away on both sides of me I saw other wedges of our men\r\ncoming slanting in to assail the same point; overhead a corps of girls\r\nwas hovering. Our towers, three of them concentrated here, had risen to\r\na moderate height; their rays were playing upon the threatened area; a\r\nsteady fountain of sparks showed where they were striking the barrage.\r\n\r\nA silent bombardment of flashing beams and sparks. At five hundred feet\r\nwe added our own smaller rays to the turmoil. If the barrage would break\r\nat this point....\r\n\r\nThe instrument room, watchful of everything, sailed over me. On my\r\nmirror I saw Georg's intent face; his voice said:\r\n\r\n\"Careful, Jac! They may come out.\"\r\n\r\nProphetic words! The segment of barrage here suddenly vanished. A ray\r\ndarted out. Beside it, a cloud of flying figures came out of the city\r\nlike insects from a hive.\r\n\r\nAn inferno of almost hand to hand fighting. It was everyone for himself;\r\nand I gave the order for my men to break formation. Ordered them to get\r\nup close to the wall if they could ... to strike, with the closest\r\npossible range at the base of the enemy ray....\r\n\r\nI flung myself forward. Tarrano's men soon were around me. Twisting,\r\ndarting figures ... tiny beams of death to be fended off with my\r\nshield....\r\n\r\nA body fell past me in the air ... others, while I looked at them, in\r\nthe blink of an eyelid, vanished into nothingness ... One of our towers\r\nsailing high, suddenly went dark, turned over, wavered down, dismembered\r\nwith leprous missing parts--and then in a puff was obliterated.\r\n\r\nI found myself nearly up to the wall, and higher than its top. The\r\nsegment of barrage remained broken. I could see into the city--the Ice\r\nPalace, still seemingly deserted. And near it, the base of the powerful\r\nground ray which was assailing our towers ... If I could get past the\r\nwall, unnoticed, get within range of that projector....\r\n\r\nMost of the fighting was now behind me. We seemed to be holding our\r\nown ... the squad of girls was coming down; I prayed that Elza might not\r\nbe among them....\r\n\r\nThe instrument room had vanished beyond my sight; but Georg's voice\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"We're sending reinforcements! Gather your men--hold off for a moment!\"\r\n\r\nFrom every pan of our line other units of men and towers were coming. We\r\nhad broken through the barrage here. If we could now, by a concerted\r\nrush, get our force over the wall, into the city....\r\n\r\nWithin the instrument room, Georg sat watching. The inactivity of his\r\nown part, the comparative lack of personal danger, galled him. But he\r\nwas too occupied with his duties to give it more than passing thought.\r\nWe had broken the barrage at one point ... from every quarter he was\r\nrushing reinforcements there to take advantage of the break....\r\n\r\nAnd then Tarrano's trickery became apparent. We had not broken his\r\nbarrage; he had deliberately withdrawn it, to encourage us, to bring our\r\nother units to the spot.... Our power house, neglected, was momentarily\r\ncomparatively defenseless. The enemy barrage at the point of the wall\r\nnearest it, suddenly lifted. Beams darted from the opening ... men came\r\nout in a cloud....\r\n\r\nI held back momentarily from the wall and gathered my remnant of men\r\nabout me. Only half my former strength; but with sinking heart I tried\r\nto assure myself that the others had not heeded my call. The fighting\r\nhere had slackened; Tarrano's men had risen high, engaged at long range\r\nby our girls, from whom they were slowly, trickily retreating as though\r\nto lure the girls above the city; and my heart was thankful when I heard\r\nthe relayed order from Rhaalton for the girls to withdraw--not to pass\r\nabove the wall, even at high altitude. The order came just in time; the\r\nbarrage here flashed on again, trapping a few of our men behind it.\r\n\r\nI was aware of this new attack on the power house. Our units were\r\nhurriedly being ordered back. Georg, in desperation, had flung his\r\ninstrument vehicle at the enemy ray ... My connection broke; and then\r\nanother connection brought me someone's voice with the report that the\r\ninstrument room had darkened that main enemy ray, but had itself crashed\r\nto the ground ... I wondered if Georg were killed ... later, I heard\r\nsomeone say that he was safe within the power house....\r\n\r\nI disobeyed my final orders; I did not swing back toward the power\r\nhouse; instead, with my men around me, we fled back from this segment of\r\nthe wall to the higher lying white plain behind it.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the down-grade of this land here, culminating in the\r\ndepression which marked this part of the wall. It was that depression\r\nwhich gave me my idea. Our heat-ray cylinders had so far been useless.\r\nThey had a range of only two hundred feet, and no power to attack a\r\nbarrage. Some of them had futilely been used; the snow and ice on the\r\nground above our recent fighting was melted in patches--pools of boiling\r\nwater lay on the naked rock; and the water, flowing down the depression,\r\nhad reached the ice-wall--a tiny stream of it, eating into the wall,\r\nslowly, surely....\r\n\r\nWith my men I flew up the slope. The ice and snow here melted under\r\nthe close-range play of our heat-cylinders. Rivulets of boiling water\r\nbegan creeping toward the city. Other men at my call joined us. Two\r\nhundred of us soon were melting the ice. The rivulets merged into\r\nbrooks, to streams--and soon a river torrent of hissing, boiling water\r\ngathering volume as it went, was surging at the wall. The wall\r\nbegan melting--itself feeding this monster which was eating at its\r\nvitals ... a yawning hole began opening at the base of the wall ... it\r\nbegan sagging at the top ... crumbling....\r\n\r\nThe segment of barrage here went dark. No trickery now; the barrage at\r\nthis point actually was broken. The boiling river went through the wall,\r\nswept down the slope into the city. Through the great clouds of steam I\r\ncould see the Ice Palace with its brittle outlines softening under the\r\nheat ... one of its thin spires broke off and fell....\r\n\r\nFeverishly we added to the river source. The whole area here was grey\r\nwith steam. Girls had joined us ... Elza was not among them ... Elza!\r\nWith my triumph there lay always in the background of my consciousness\r\nthe weight of my fear for Elza....\r\n\r\nThe fighting in the other sector had continued desperately. Our power\r\nhouse was hopelessly damaged; the towers, with their power gone, were\r\nusing their batteries; soon they would be exhausted. But now we\r\nabandoned that sector; our remaining towers--all our flying forces--came\r\nto this melting area where the vanishing city lay defenseless before\r\nus.... We hurled ourselves into it, using only our heat-rays. Everywhere\r\nwe added to the boiling torrent; even the interference heat of the\r\nfighting was to our advantage. This brittle city which owed its very\r\nexistence to the congealing cold, lay enveloped in a cloud of steam.\r\n\r\nThen Tarrano played his last card. The cubical building of metal with\r\nthe cables depending from it, still hung motionless. It now burst into\r\nsound. A low electrical hum; then louder to a whine--a scream. Our men\r\nand girls were in the air around it. I too was there. Tarrano's men--the\r\nremaining few who were desperately fighting--had suddenly withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAnd then we knew the purpose of this hanging room. A strange form of\r\nsome tremendous electro-magnet. I could feel it pulling at me. My power\r\nto guide myself in the air was wavering.\r\n\r\nFrom my height I could see down into this ceilingless rectangle. It was\r\nun-manned by humans. A room of whirling, flashing knives! Above it, even\r\nthen some of our men were struggling in its magnetic grip ... being\r\ndrawn down into it ... a girl's power must suddenly have collapsed; she\r\nwas sucked in with a rush--torn to fragments by the whirling knives....\r\n\r\nThe area of magnetism seemed to spread for a helan or more. Everywhere\r\naround me I saw our men and girls struggling with it, fighting to keep\r\naway, but closing in a ring around it ... faster, continually more\r\nhelpless until at last, their bodies out of control whirling end over\r\nend, they were sucked in like water rushing into a turbine.... One of\r\nour weakened towers attacked it; but some of the remnants of Tarrano's\r\nprojectors caught the tower and darkened it.\r\n\r\nThrough the rising clouds of steam I could see the magnet vaguely now.\r\nBut I could feel it pulling; and soon, in spite of myself, I was fairly\r\nclose above it. I strove to keep my wits. The others who were meeting\r\ntheir death lost control of their bodies at the last and could not use\r\ntheir cylinders. I had some battery power remaining; I snapped on my\r\ndisintegrating ray to test it. It was my last desperate recourse.\r\n\r\nI righted my body, and yielding to the magnetic pull, ceasing to\r\nstruggle, I dove head first at that yawning rectangle. A gleaming blur\r\nof knives ... blood-stained now ... within these rectangular walls\r\nhorrible carnage....\r\n\r\nA second of despair; but my ray struck true ... Around me was chaos; my\r\nsenses reeled, went black for an instant. But I recovered, found myself\r\nwhirling in the empty air....\r\n\r\nThe city was melting into a turmoil of boiling water and surging steam.\r\nThe fighting everywhere had ceased. Wavering figures were\r\nrising--fugitives struggling away. With my senses still confused, I\r\nrighted myself, undecided where to go or what to do. Above me two\r\nfigures were still in combat. One of them--a man--assailed by a\r\nheat-ray, came hurtling down past me. The other wavered--a girl with her\r\nflying mechanism out of control. She was a hundred feet or more above\r\nme, wavering downward. Elza! I shot myself up to her, seized her in my\r\narms, my own supporting mechanism sustaining us both. Elza, spent, but\r\nuninjured, I held her close.\r\n\r\n\"Elza dear! My Elza!\"\r\n\r\nWe hung there in the air. From out the vanishing city, rising through\r\nthe steam came a small metal vehicle. A pointed cylinder, in height no\r\nmore than twice that of a man. It came up slowly. Its rectangular door\r\nwas open. As it reached our level and went past us quite close, I saw a\r\nman's figure standing there. Tarrano! Tarrano alone! From the wreckage\r\nof his city, making his escape alone!\r\n\r\nWithout thought--holding Elza tightly within my arms--I flung us upward.\r\nTarrano saw us, recognized us. He slackened his upward pace. With my\r\nsober reason gone, I strove to overtake him; saw the sardonic leer on\r\nhis face but did not realize that he was waiting for us. We caught up\r\nwith his vehicle; he pulled us through the doorway, to the floor of the\r\nnarrow circular room with its heavy translucent panes.\r\n\r\nHe was bending over me, leering. \"Jac Hallen! And my little Lady Elza!\r\nHow fortunate!\"\r\n\r\nI cast off Elza and gained my feet. For an instant we stood--Tarrano and\r\nI--measuring each other. He seemed calm; his face bore a slow sardonic\r\nsmile; he was unarmed, drawn back against the concavity of the wall,\r\nwatching me with his steady, keen eyes. Behind him through the low\r\nwindow, I saw the white ground now far below us; we were rising swiftly.\r\n\r\n\"So you brought my Lady Elza back to me, Jac Hallen?\"\r\n\r\nHe got no further, for with a leap I was upon him. To use my weapons in\r\nthese narrow quarters would have been suicide. My body pinned him\r\nagainst the wall as I lunged; my fingers strove for his throat.\r\n\r\nHe was no larger than I, but the strength of him was extraordinary. His\r\nbody stiffened to resist my impact; one of his hands gripped my wrist;\r\nhis other hand--the heel of it--came up beneath my chin, forcing my head\r\nback.\r\n\r\nHe fought silently, with movements that seemed almost deliberate. Into\r\nthe center of the room we struggled. I saw that Elza was upon her feet,\r\na hand pressed to her mouth in terror.\r\n\r\n\"Elza!\"\r\n\r\nI had meant to tell her to use the control levers which were on a small\r\ntable nearby--to bring us back to the ground; but with this momentary\r\ndiverting of my attention, Tarrano's fist struck me full in the face. I\r\nstaggered back. Elza screamed--called something to Tarrano. I staggered,\r\nbut I did not fall; and as Tarrano stood there, still with his slow\r\nsmile, I recovered myself and was again upon him. Locked together we\r\nswayed to the control table. My back was to it. Tarrano's slender\r\nfingers with a grip like alemite, had found my throat. Slowly,\r\nirresistibly he forced me backward over the table. I was helpless; my\r\nbreath was stopped; Tarrano's triumphant face bending over me was fading\r\nwith my senses.\r\n\r\n\"In just a moment, Lady Elza....\"\r\n\r\nHe was telling her calmly that in a moment he would be finished with me.\r\nDid the man's egotism, here at the last, delude him into the belief that\r\nElza wanted him to conquer me? With all the weapons of science\r\ndiscarded--this primitive struggle of man against man with the woman as\r\nprize--did the thought of that delude him into the belief that her love\r\nwas his, now that he was killing me?\r\n\r\nI never knew. But beneath the roaring of my head, I heard his gentle\r\nwords to her. And then, behind him, I saw her coming forward. A heavy\r\nmetal object which she had picked up from the floor was in her hand.\r\nTarrano saw her also--in a mirror on the table--saw her raise the jagged\r\nweapon. Raise it to strike; not at me--at himself. His face was close\r\nabove mine. In that second, I saw in his expression the realization that\r\nElza was attacking him.\r\n\r\nWhatever his emotions, like a flash he acted. His grip on my throat\r\nloosened. His arm, swinging backward, warded off Elza's trembling,\r\nhesitant blow. The metal block, intended for his head, was knocked from\r\nher hand; it fell clattering to the floor. And reaching over, Tarrano\r\ngripped the vehicle's control lever, wrenched it bodily from its\r\nfastenings! Control of the vehicle was irrevocably lost! We were\r\nfalling!\r\n\r\nBreathless moments! Tarrano idly stood apart; his face a mask. My breath\r\nrestored, I was recovering. I drew myself erect.\r\n\r\nDeath! But my confused thoughts went to Elza. Her flying mechanism was\r\npartially sustaining; my own probably was still effective. Before\r\nTarrano was aware of my purpose, I had pushed Elza forcibly through the\r\ndoorway. Into the rush of air her figure disappeared. But Tarrano\r\ngripped me as I tried to follow her. Gripped me and clung. A breathless,\r\ndizzy instant. Locked together, our bodies shifted crazily. I\r\ntried to get him out the doorway with me, but he fought against\r\nit.... Smiling--always smiling....\r\n\r\nElza fell safely. But they told me that Tarrano and I hovered for days\r\nunconscious on the borderland between life and death, living finally,\r\nfor our vehicle had plunged into a tremendous snow-bank, to break its\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLast scene of all ... They would not have Tarrano on any of the three\r\nworlds. While still living, the very personality of him was a menace.\r\nWith his woman Tara, who refused to leave him and whom he tolerated,\r\nthey banished him to that tiny asteroid which pursued its solitary way\r\nbetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.\r\n\r\nA lonely, barren little world, with its single, primitive race of\r\nspindly beings--timid, frail beings, half-human, half insect. We took\r\nhim there--Maida and Georg, Elza and I. He anticipated his dislike of\r\nthe asteroid's slight gravity, and demanded weighted shoes so that he\r\nmight walk with the normal feeling of Earth and Venus.\r\n\r\n\"You give me too much freedom,\" he told us solemnly.\r\n\r\nAnd there amid the rocks, with Tara we set him down. As we parted, he\r\nturned to Elza. She and I were joined in marriage by then. He faced her,\r\ntook one of her hands and pressed its palm to his forehead, the gesture\r\nof homage and respect.\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye, Lady Elza. I wish for you all life's happiness.\" He smiled,\r\nbut it was a very wistful smile. And then he swung away abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Tara! Prepare me food. Leave me--I would be alone.\" His imperious\r\ngesture dispersed also the crowd of natives who were curiously regarding\r\nhim. Here, in his last little domain, he would still be master.\r\n\r\nOur vehicle slowly rose. From its windows we watched him. Ignoring us\r\nutterly, weighted down by his heavy shoes, he paced his barren rocks,\r\nhead lowered, alone with those thoughts he never shared with anyone.\r\n\r\nTarrano, the Conqueror!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Tarrano the Conqueror, by Raymond King Cummings",
