Let me call especial attention to the three\r\n“Little Birds” borders, at pp. 365, 371, 377. The way, in which he has\r\nmanaged to introduce the most minute details of the stanzas to be\r\nillustrated, seems to me a triumph of artistic ingenuity.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me here express my sincere gratitude to the many Reviewers who have\r\nnoticed, whether favorably or unfavorably, the previous Volume. Their\r\nunfavorable remarks were, most probably, well-deserved; the favorable\r\nones less probably so. Both kinds have no doubt served to make the book\r\nknown, and have helped the reading Public to form their opinions of it.\r\nLet me also here assure them that it is not from any want of respect for\r\ntheir criticisms, that I have carefully forborne from reading _any_ of\r\nthem. I am strongly of opinion that an author had far better _not_ read\r\nany reviews of his books: the unfavorable ones are almost certain to\r\nmake him cross, and the favorable ones conceited; and _neither_ of these\r\nresults is desirable.\r\n\r\nCriticisms have, however, reached me from private sources, to some of\r\nwhich I propose to offer a reply.\r\n\r\nOne such critic complains that Arthur’s strictures, on sermons and on\r\nchoristers, are too severe. Let me say, in reply, that I do _not_ hold\r\nmyself responsible for _any_ of the opinions expressed by the characters\r\nin my book. They are simply opinions which, it seemed to me, might\r\nprobably be held by the persons into whose mouths I put them, and which\r\nwere worth consideration.\r\n\r\nOther critics have objected to certain innovations in spelling, such as\r\n“ca’n’t,” “wo’n’t,” “traveler.” In reply, I can only plead my firm\r\nconviction that the popular usage is _wrong_. As to “ca’n’t,” it will\r\nnot be disputed that, in all _other_ words ending in “n’t,” these\r\nletters are an abbreviation of “not”; and it is surely absurd to suppose\r\nthat, in this solitary instance, “not” is represented by “’t”! In fact\r\n“can’t” is the _proper_ abbreviation for “can it,” just as “is’t” is for\r\n“is it.” Again, in “wo’n’t,” the first apostrophe is needed, because the\r\nword “would” is here _abridged_ into “wo”: but I hold it proper to spell\r\n“don’t” with only _one_ apostrophe, because the word “do” is here\r\n_complete_. As to such words as “traveler,” I hold the correct principle\r\nto be, to _double_ the consonant when the accent falls on that syllable;\r\notherwise to leave it _single_. This rule is observed in most cases\r\n(e.g. we double the “r” in “preferred,” but leave it single in\r\n“offered”), so that I am only extending, to other cases, an existing\r\nrule. I admit, however, that I do not spell “parallel,” as the rule\r\nwould have it; but here we are constrained, by the etymology, to insert\r\nthe double “l”.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to Vol. I. were two puzzles, on which my readers might\r\nexercise their ingenuity. One was, to detect the 3 lines of “padding,”\r\nwhich I had found it necessary to supply in the passage extending from\r\nthe top of p. 35 to the middle of p. 38. They are the 14th, 15th, and\r\n16th lines of p. 37. The other puzzle was, to determine which (if any)\r\nof the 8 stanzas of the Gardener’s Song (see pp. 65, 78, 83, 90, 106,\r\n116, 164, 168) were adapted to the context, and which (if any) had the\r\ncontext adapted to them. The last of them is the only one that was\r\nadapted to the context, the “Garden-Door that opened with a key” having\r\nbeen substituted for some creature (a Cormorant, I think) “that nestled\r\nin a tree.” At pp. 78, 106, and 164, the context was adapted to the\r\nstanza. At p. 90, neither stanza nor context was altered: the connection\r\nbetween them was simply a piece of good luck.\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to Vol. I., at pp. ix., x., I gave an account of the\r\nmaking-up of the story of “Sylvie and Bruno.” A few more details may\r\nperhaps be acceptable to my Readers.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1873, as I _now_ believe, that the idea first occurred to me\r\nthat a little fairy-tale (written, in 1867, for “Aunt Judy’s Magazine,”\r\nunder the title “Bruno’s Revenge”) might serve as the nucleus of a\r\nlonger story. This I surmise, from having found the original draft of\r\nthe last paragraph of Vol. II., dated 1873. So that this paragraph has\r\nbeen waiting 20 years for its chance of emerging into print—more than\r\ntwice the period so cautiously recommended by Horace for ‘repressing’\r\none’s literary efforts!\r\n\r\nIt was in February, 1885, that I entered into negotiations, with Mr.\r\nHarry Furniss, for illustrating the book. Most of the substance of\r\n_both_ Volumes was then in existence in manuscript: and my original\r\nintention was to publish the _whole_ story at once. In September, 1885,\r\nI received from Mr. Furniss the first set of drawings—the four which\r\nillustrate “Peter and Paul” (see I. pp. 144, 147, 150, 154): in\r\nNovember, 1886, I received the second set—the three which illustrate the\r\nProfessor’s song about the “little man” who had “a little gun” (Vol. II.\r\npp. 265, 266, 267): and in January, 1887, I received the third set—the\r\nfour which illustrate the “Pig-Tale.”\r\n\r\nSo we went on, illustrating first one bit of the story, and then\r\nanother, without any idea of sequence. And it was not till March, 1889,\r\nthat, having calculated the number of pages the story would occupy, I\r\ndecided on dividing it into _two_ portions, and publishing it half at a\r\ntime. This necessitated the writing of a _sort_ of conclusion for the\r\nfirst Volume: and _most_ of my Readers, I fancy, regarded this as the\r\n_actual_ conclusion, when that Volume appeared in December, 1889. At any\r\nrate, among all the letters I received about it, there was only _one_\r\nwhich expressed _any_ suspicion that it was not a _final_ conclusion.\r\nThis letter was from a child. She wrote “we were so glad, when we came\r\nto the end of the book, to find that there was no ending-up, for that\r\nshows us that you are going to write a sequel.”\r\n\r\nIt may interest some of my Readers to know the _theory_ on which this\r\nstory is constructed. It is an attempt to show what might _possibly_\r\nhappen, supposing that Fairies really existed; and that they were\r\nsometimes visible to us, and we to them; and that they were sometimes\r\nable to assume human form: and supposing, also, that human beings might\r\nsometimes become conscious of what goes on in the Fairy-world—by actual\r\ntransference of their immaterial essence, such as we meet with in\r\n‘Esoteric Buddhism.’\r\n\r\nI have supposed a Human being to be capable of various psychical states,\r\nwith varying degrees of consciousness, as follows:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of the presence of\r\nFairies;\r\n\r\n(_b_) the ‘eerie’ state, in which, while conscious of actual\r\nsurroundings, he is _also_ conscious of the presence of Fairies;\r\n\r\n(_c_) a form of trance, in which, while _un_conscious of actual\r\nsurroundings, and apparently asleep, he (i.e. his immaterial essence)\r\nmigrates to other scenes, in the actual world, or in Fairyland, and is\r\nconscious of the presence of Fairies.\r\n\r\nI have also supposed a Fairy to be capable of migrating from Fairyland\r\ninto the actual world, and of assuming, at pleasure, a Human form; and\r\nalso to be capable of various psychical states, viz.\r\n\r\n(_a_) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of the presence of Human\r\nbeings;\r\n\r\n(_b_) a sort of ‘eerie’ state, in which he is conscious, if in the\r\nactual world, of the presence of actual Human beings; if in Fairyland,\r\nof the presence of the immaterial essences of Human beings.\r\n\r\nI will here tabulate the passages, in both Volumes, where abnormal\r\nstates occur.\r\n\r\n  Historian’s Locality and State.

A few more such\r\ndetails may perhaps interest my Readers:—\r\n\r\nI. p. 203. The very peculiar use, here made of a dead mouse, comes from\r\nreal life. I once found two very small boys, in a garden, playing a\r\nmicroscopic game of ‘Single-Wicket.’ The bat was, I think, about the\r\nsize of a table-spoon; and the utmost distance attained by the ball, in\r\nits most daring flights, was some 4 or 5 yards. The _exact_ length was\r\nof course a matter of _supreme_ importance; and it was always carefully\r\nmeasured out (the batsman and the bowler amicably sharing the toil) with\r\na dead mouse!\r\n\r\nI. p. 259. The two quasi-mathematical Axioms, quoted by Arthur at p. 259\r\nof Vol. I., (“Things that are greater than the same are greater than one\r\nanother,” and “All angles are equal”) were actually enunciated, in all\r\nseriousness, by undergraduates at a University situated not 100 miles\r\nfrom Ely.\r\n\r\nII. p. 10. Bruno’s remark (“I can, if I like, &c.”) was actually made by\r\na little boy.\r\n\r\nII. p. 12. So also was his remark (“I know what it _doesn’t_ spell.”)\r\nAnd his remark (“I just twiddled my eyes, &c.”) I heard from the lips of\r\na little girl, who had just solved a puzzle I had set her.\r\n\r\nII. p. 57. Bruno’s soliloquy (“For its father, &c.”) was actually spoken\r\nby a little girl, looking out of the window of a railway-carriage.\r\n\r\nII. p. 138. The remark, made by a guest at the dinner-party, when asking\r\nfor a dish of fruit (“I’ve been wishing for them, &c.”) I heard made by\r\nthe great Poet-Laureate, whose loss the whole reading-world has so\r\nlately had to deplore.\r\n\r\nII. p. 163. Bruno’s speech, on the subject of the age of ‘Mein Herr,’\r\nembodies the reply of a little girl to the question “Is your grandmother\r\nan _old_ lady?” “I don’t know if she’s an _old_ lady,” said this\r\ncautious young person; “she’s _eighty-three_.”\r\n\r\nII. p. 203. The speech about ‘Obstruction’ is no mere creature of my\r\nimagination! It is copied _verbatim_ from the columns of the Standard,\r\nand was spoken by Sir William Harcourt, who was, at the time, a member\r\nof the ‘Opposition,’ at the ‘National Liberal Club,’ on July the 16th,\r\n1890.\r\n\r\nII. p. 329. The Professor’s remark, about a dog’s tail, that “it doesn’t\r\nbite at _that_ end,” was actually made by a child, when warned of the\r\ndanger he was incurring by pulling the dog’s tail.\r\n\r\nII. p. 374. The dialogue between Sylvie and Bruno, which occupies lines\r\n6 to 15, is a _verbatim_ report (merely substituting “cake” for “penny”)\r\nof a dialogue overheard between two children.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne story in this Volume—‘Bruno’s Picnic’—I can vouch for as suitable\r\nfor telling to children, having tested it again and again; and, whether\r\nmy audience has been a dozen little girls in a village-school, or some\r\nthirty or forty in a London drawing-room, or a hundred in a High School,\r\nI have always found them earnestly attentive, and keenly appreciative of\r\nsuch fun as the story supplied.\r\n\r\nMay I take this opportunity of calling attention to what I flatter\r\nmyself was a successful piece of name-coining, at p. 42 of Vol. I. Does\r\nnot the name ‘Sibimet’ fairly embody the character of the Sub-Warden?\r\nThe gentle Reader has no doubt observed what a singularly useless\r\narticle in a house a brazen trumpet is, if you simply leave it lying\r\nabout, and never blow it!\r\n\r\nReaders of the first Volume, who have amused themselves by trying to\r\nsolve the two puzzles propounded at pp. xi., xii. of the Preface, may\r\nperhaps like to exercise their ingenuity in discovering which (if any)\r\nof the following parallelisms were intentional, and which (if any)\r\naccidental.\r\n\r\n  “Little Birds.”  Events, and Persons.\r\n  Stanza       1.  Banquet.\r\n               2.  Chancellor.\r\n               3.  Empress and Spinach (II. 325).\r\n               4.  Warden’s Return.\r\n               5.

Jester and Bear (I. 119). Little Foxes.\r\n              10.  Bruno’s Dinner-Bell; Little Foxes.\r\n\r\nI will publish the answer to this puzzle in the Preface to a little book\r\nof “Original Games and Puzzles,” now in course of preparation.\r\n\r\nI have reserved, for the last, one or two rather more serious topics.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had intended, in this Preface, to discuss more fully, than I had done\r\nin the previous Volume, the ‘Morality of Sport’, with special reference\r\nto letters I have received from lovers of Sport, in which they point out\r\nthe many great advantages which men get from it, and try to prove that\r\nthe suffering, which it inflicts on animals, is too trivial to be\r\nregarded.\r\n\r\nBut, when I came to think the subject out, and to arrange the whole of\r\nthe arguments ‘pro’ and ‘con’, I found it much too large for treatment\r\nhere. Some day, I hope to publish an essay on this subject. At present,\r\nI will content myself with stating the net result I have arrived at.\r\n\r\nIt is, that God has given to Man an absolute right to take the _lives_\r\nof other animals, for _any_ reasonable cause, such as the supply of\r\nfood: but that He has _not_ given to Man the right to inflict _pain_,\r\nunless when _necessary_: that mere pleasure, or advantage, does not\r\nconstitute such a necessity: and, consequently, that pain, inflicted for\r\nthe purposes of _Sport_, is cruel, and therefore wrong. But I find it a\r\nfar more complex question than I had supposed; and that the ‘case’, on\r\nthe side of the Sportsman, is a much stronger one than I had supposed.\r\nSo, for the present, I say no more about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjections have been raised to the severe language I have put into the\r\nmouth of ‘Arthur’, at p. 277, on the subject of ‘Sermons,’ and at pp.\r\n273, 274, on the subjects of Choral Services and ‘Choristers.’\r\n\r\nI have already protested against the assumption that I am ready to\r\nendorse the opinions of characters in my story. But, in these two\r\ninstances, I admit that I am much in sympathy with ‘Arthur.’ In my\r\nopinion, far too many sermons are expected from our preachers; and, as a\r\nconsequence, a great many are preached, which are not worth listening\r\nto; and, as a consequence of _that_, we are very apt _not_ to listen.\r\nThe reader of this paragraph probably heard a sermon last Sunday\r\nmorning? Well, let him, if he can, name the text, and state how the\r\npreacher treated it!\r\n\r\nThen, as to ‘Choristers,’ and all the other accessories—of music,\r\nvestments, processions, &c.,—which have come, along with them, into\r\nfashion—while freely admitting that the ‘Ritual’ movement was sorely\r\nneeded, and that it has effected a vast improvement in our\r\nChurch-Services, which had become dead and dry to the last degree, I\r\nhold that, like many other desirable movements, it has gone too far in\r\nthe opposite direction, and has introduced many new dangers.\r\n\r\nFor the Congregation this new movement involves the danger of learning\r\nto think that the Services are done _for_ them; and that their bodily\r\n_presence_ is all they need contribute. And, for Clergy and Congregation\r\nalike, it involves the danger of regarding these elaborate Services as\r\n_ends in themselves_, and of forgetting that they are simply _means_,\r\nand the very hollowest of mockeries, unless they bear fruit in our\r\n_lives_.\r\n\r\nFor the Choristers it seems to involve the danger of self-conceit, as\r\ndescribed at p. 274, the danger of regarding those parts of the Service,\r\nwhere their help is not required, as not worth attending to, the danger\r\nof coming to regard the Service as a mere outward form—a series of\r\npostures to be assumed, and of words to be said or sung, while the\r\n_thoughts_ are elsewhere—and the danger of ‘familiarity’ breeding\r\n‘contempt’ for sacred things.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate these last two forms of danger, from my own\r\nexperience. Not long ago, I attended a Cathedral-Service, and was placed\r\nimmediately behind a row of men, members of the Choir; and I could not\r\nhelp noticing that they treated the _Lessons_ as a part of the Service\r\nto which they needed not to give _any_ attention, and as affording them\r\na convenient opportunity for arranging music-books, &c., &c. Also I have\r\nfrequently seen a row of little choristers, after marching in procession\r\nto their places, kneel down, as if about to pray, and rise from their\r\nknees after a minute spent in looking about them, it being but too\r\nevident that the attitude was a mere mockery. Surely it is very\r\ndangerous, for these children, to thus accustom them to _pretend_ to\r\npray? As an instance of irreverent treatment of holy things, I will\r\nmention a custom, which no doubt many of my readers have noticed in\r\nChurches where the Clergy and Choir enter in procession, viz. that, at\r\nthe end of the private devotions, which are carried on in the vestry,\r\nand which are of course inaudible to the Congregation, the final “Amen”\r\nis _shouted_, loud enough to be heard all through the Church. This\r\nserves as a signal, to the Congregation, to prepare to rise when the\r\nprocession appears: and it admits of no dispute that it is for this\r\npurpose that it is thus shouted. When we remember to Whom that “Amen” is\r\n_really_ addressed, and consider that it is here _used_ for the same\r\npurpose as one of the Church-bells, we must surely admit that it is a\r\npiece of gross irreverence? To _me_ it is much as if I were to see a\r\nBible used as a footstool.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the dangers, for the Clergy themselves, introduced by\r\nthis new movement, let me mention the fact that, according to _my_\r\nexperience, Clergymen of this school are _specially_ apt to retail comic\r\nanecdotes, in which the most sacred names and words—sometimes actual\r\ntexts from the Bible—are used as themes for jesting. Many such things\r\nare repeated as having been originally said by _children_, whose utter\r\nignorance of evil must no doubt acquit _them_, in the sight of God, of\r\nall blame; but it must be otherwise for those who _consciously_ use such\r\ninnocent utterances as material for their unholy mirth.\r\n\r\nLet me add, however, _most_ earnestly, that I fully believe that this\r\nprofanity is, in many cases, _un_conscious: the ‘environment’ (as I have\r\ntried to explain at p. 123) makes all the difference between man and\r\nman; and I rejoice to think that many of these profane stories—which _I_\r\nfind so painful to listen to, and should feel it a sin to repeat—give to\r\n_their_ ears no pain, and to _their_ consciences no shock; and that\r\n_they_ can utter, not less sincerely than myself, the two prayers,\r\n“_Hallowed be Thy Name_” and “_from hardness of heart, and contempt of\r\nThy Word and Commandment, Good Lord, deliver us!_” To which I would\r\ndesire to add, for their sake and for my own, Keble’s beautiful\r\npetition, “_help us, this and every day, To live more nearly as we\r\npray!_” It is, in fact, for its _consequences_—for the grave dangers,\r\nboth to speaker and to hearer, which it involves—rather than for what it\r\nis _in itself_, that I mourn over this clerical habit of profanity in\r\nsocial talk. To the _believing_ hearer it brings the danger of loss of\r\nreverence for holy things, by the mere act of listening to, and\r\nenjoying, such jests; and also the temptation to retail them for the\r\namusement of others. To the _unbelieving_ hearer it brings a welcome\r\nconfirmation of his theory that religion is a fable, in the spectacle of\r\nits accredited champions thus betraying their trust. And to the speaker\r\nhimself it must surely bring the danger of _loss of faith_. For surely\r\nsuch jests, if uttered with no consciousness of harm, must necessarily\r\nbe also uttered with no consciousness, at the moment, of the _reality_\r\nof God, as a _living being_, who hears all we say. And he, who allows\r\nhimself the habit of thus uttering holy words, with no thought of their\r\nmeaning, is but too likely to find that, for him, God has become a myth,\r\nand heaven a poetic fancy—that, for him, the light of life is gone, and\r\nthat he is at heart an atheist, lost in “_a darkness that may be felt_.”\r\n\r\nThere is, I fear, at the present time, an increasing tendency to\r\nirreverent treatment of the name of God and of subjects connected with\r\nreligion. Some of our theatres are helping this downward movement by the\r\ngross caricatures of clergymen which they put upon the stage: some of\r\nour clergy are themselves helping it, by showing that they can lay aside\r\nthe spirit of reverence, along with their surplices, and can treat as\r\njests, when _outside_ their churches, names and things to which they pay\r\nan almost superstitious veneration when _inside_: the “Salvation Army”\r\nhas, I fear, with the best intentions, done much to help it, by the\r\ncoarse familiarity with which they treat holy things: and surely every\r\none, who desires to _live_ in the spirit of the prayer “_Hallowed be thy\r\nName_,” ought to do what he can, however little that may be, to check\r\nit. So I have gladly taken this unique opportunity, however unfit the\r\ntopic may seem for the Preface to a book of this kind, to express some\r\nthoughts which have weighed on my mind for a long time. I did not\r\nexpect, when I wrote the Preface to Vol. I, that it would be read to any\r\nappreciable extent: but I rejoice to believe, from evidence that has\r\nreached me, that it _has_ been read by many, and to hope that this\r\nPreface will also be so: and I think that, among them, some will be\r\nfound ready to sympathise with the views I have put forwards, and ready\r\nto help, with their prayers and their example, the revival, in Society,\r\nof the waning spirit of reverence.\r\n\r\n                                                      _Christmas_, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                            PAGE\r\n  I.

I missed the pleasant friends I had left\r\nbehind at Elveston—the genial interchange of thought—the sympathy which\r\ngave to one’s ideas a new and vivid reality: but, perhaps more than all,\r\nI missed the companionship of the two Fairies—or Dream-Children, for I\r\nhad not yet solved the problem as to who or what they were—whose sweet\r\nplayfulness had shed a magic radiance over my life.\r\n\r\nIn office-hours—which I suppose reduce most men to the mental condition\r\nof a coffee-mill or a mangle—time sped along much as usual: it was in\r\nthe pauses of life, the desolate hours when books and newspapers palled\r\non the sated appetite, and when, thrown back upon one’s own dreary\r\nmusings, one strove—all in vain—to people the vacant air with the dear\r\nfaces of absent friends, that the real bitterness of solitude made\r\nitself felt.\r\n\r\nOne evening, feeling my life a little more wearisome than usual, I\r\nstrolled down to my Club, not so much with the hope of meeting any\r\nfriend there, for London was now ‘out of town,’ as with the feeling that\r\nhere, at least, I should hear ‘sweet words of human speech,’ and come\r\ninto contact with human thought.\r\n\r\nHowever, almost the first face I saw there _was_ that of a friend. Eric\r\nLindon was lounging, with rather a ‘bored’ expression of face, over a\r\nnewspaper; and we fell into conversation with a mutual satisfaction\r\nwhich neither of us tried to conceal.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I ventured to introduce what was just then the main\r\nsubject of my thoughts. “And so the Doctor” (a name we had adopted by a\r\ntacit agreement, as a convenient compromise between the formality of\r\n‘Doctor Forester’ and the intimacy—to which Eric Lindon hardly seemed\r\nentitled—of ‘Arthur’) “has gone abroad by this time, I suppose? Can you\r\ngive me his present address?”\r\n\r\n“He is still at Elveston—I believe,” was the reply. “But I have not been\r\nthere since I last met you.”\r\n\r\nI did not know which part of this intelligence to wonder at most. “And\r\nmight I ask—if it isn’t taking too much of a liberty—when your\r\nwedding-bells are to—or perhaps they _have_ rung, already?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Eric, in a steady voice, which betrayed scarcely a trace of\r\nemotion: “_that_ engagement is at an end. I am still ‘Benedick the\r\n_un_married man.’”\r\n\r\nAfter this, the thick-coming fancies—all radiant with new possibilities\r\nof happiness for Arthur—were far too bewildering to admit of any further\r\nconversation, and I was only too glad to avail myself of the first\r\ndecent excuse, that offered itself, for retiring into silence.\r\n\r\nThe next day I wrote to Arthur, with as much of a reprimand for his long\r\nsilence as I could bring myself to put into words, begging him to tell\r\nme how the world went with him.\r\n\r\nNeeds must that three or four days—possibly more—should elapse before I\r\ncould receive his reply; and never had I known days drag their slow\r\nlength along with a more tedious indolence.\r\n\r\nTo while away the time, I strolled, one afternoon, into Kensington\r\nGardens, and, wandering aimlessly along any path that presented itself,\r\nI soon became aware that I had somehow strayed into one that was wholly\r\nnew to me. Still, my elfish experiences seemed to have so completely\r\nfaded out of my life that nothing was further from my thoughts than the\r\nidea of again meeting my fairy-friends, when I chanced to notice a small\r\ncreature, moving among the grass that fringed the path, that did not\r\nseem to be an insect, or a frog, or any other living thing that I could\r\nthink of. Cautiously kneeling down, and making an _ex tempore_ cage of\r\nmy two hands, I imprisoned the little wanderer, and felt a sudden thrill\r\nof surprise and delight on discovering that my prisoner was no other\r\nthan _Bruno_ himself!\r\n\r\nBruno took the matter _very_ coolly, and, when I had replaced him on the\r\nground, where he would be within easy conversational distance, he began\r\ntalking, just as if it were only a few minutes since last we had met.\r\n\r\n“Doos oo know what the _Rule_ is,” he enquired, “when oo catches a\r\nFairy, withouten its having tolded oo where it was?” (Bruno’s notions of\r\nEnglish Grammar had certainly _not_ improved since our last meeting.)\r\n\r\n“No,” I said. “I didn’t know there was any Rule about it.”\r\n\r\n“I _think_ oo’ve got a right to _eat_ me,” said the little fellow,\r\nlooking up into my face with a winning smile. “But I’m not pruffickly\r\nsure. Oo’d better not do it wizout asking.”\r\n\r\nIt did indeed seem reasonable not to take so irrevocable a step as\r\n_that_, without due enquiry. “I’ll certainly _ask_ about it, first,” I\r\nsaid. “Besides, I don’t know yet whether you would be _worth_ eating!”\r\n\r\n“I guess I’m _deliciously_ good to eat,” Bruno remarked in a satisfied\r\ntone, as if it were something to be rather proud of.\r\n\r\n“And what are you doing here, Bruno?”\r\n\r\n“_That’s_ not my name!” said my cunning little friend. “Don’t oo know my\r\nname’s ‘Oh Bruno!’? That’s what Sylvie always calls me, when I says mine\r\nlessons.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, what are you doing here, oh Bruno?”\r\n\r\n“Doing mine lessons, a-course!” With that roguish twinkle in his eye,\r\nthat always came when he knew he was talking nonsense.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _that’s_ the way you do your lessons, is it? And do you remember\r\nthem well?”\r\n\r\n“Always can ’member _mine_ lessons,” said Bruno. “It’s _Sylvie’s_\r\nlessons that’s so _dreffully_ hard to ’member!” He frowned, as if in\r\nagonies of thought, and tapped his forehead with his knuckles. “I\r\n_ca’n’t_ think enough to understand them!” he said despairingly. “It\r\nwants _double_ thinking, I believe!”\r\n\r\n“But where’s Sylvie gone?”\r\n\r\n“That’s just what _I_ want to know!” said Bruno disconsolately. “What\r\never’s the good of setting me lessons, when she isn’t here to ’splain\r\nthe hard bits?”\r\n\r\n“_I’ll_ find her for you!” I volunteered; and, getting up, I wandered\r\nround the tree under whose shade I had been reclining, looking on all\r\nsides for Sylvie. In another minute I _again_ noticed some strange thing\r\nmoving among the grass, and, kneeling down, was immediately confronted\r\nwith Sylvie’s innocent face, lighted up with a joyful surprise at seeing\r\nme, and was accosted, in the sweet voice I knew so well, with what\r\nseemed to be the _end_ of a sentence whose beginning I had failed to\r\ncatch.\r\n\r\n“—and I think he ought to have _finished_ them by this time. So I’m\r\ngoing back to him. Will you come too? It’s only just round at the other\r\nside of this tree.”\r\n\r\nIt was but a few steps for _me_; but it was a great many for Sylvie; and\r\nI had to be very careful to walk slowly, in order not to leave the\r\nlittle creature so far behind as to lose sight of her.\r\n\r\nTo find Bruno’s _lessons_ was easy enough: they appeared to be neatly\r\nwritten out on large smooth ivy-leaves, which were scattered in some\r\nconfusion over a little patch of ground where the grass had been worn\r\naway; but the pale student, who ought by rights to have been bending\r\nover them, was nowhere to be seen: we looked in all directions, for some\r\ntime, in vain; but at last Sylvie’s sharp eyes detected him, swinging on\r\na tendril of ivy, and Sylvie’s stern voice commanded his instant return\r\nto _terra firma_ and to the business of Life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SYLVIE’S TRUANT-PUPIL]\r\n\r\n“Pleasure first and business afterwards” seemed to be the motto of these\r\ntiny folk, so many hugs and kisses had to be interchanged before\r\nanything else could be done.\r\n\r\n“Now, Bruno,” Sylvie said reproachfully, “didn’t I tell you you were to\r\ngo on with your lessons, unless you heard to the contrary?”\r\n\r\n“But I _did_ heard to the contrary!” Bruno insisted, with a mischievous\r\ntwinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n“_What_ did you hear, you wicked boy?”\r\n\r\n“It were a sort of noise in the air,” said Bruno: “a sort of a\r\nscrambling noise. Didn’t _oo_ hear it, Mister Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow, you needn’t go to _sleep_ over them, you lazy-lazy!” For\r\nBruno had curled himself up, on the largest ‘lesson,’ and was arranging\r\nanother as a pillow.\r\n\r\n“I _wasn’t_ asleep!” said Bruno, in a deeply-injured tone. “When I shuts\r\nmine eyes, it’s to show that I’m _awake_!”\r\n\r\n“Well, how much have you learned, then?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve learned a little tiny bit,” said Bruno, modestly, being evidently\r\nafraid of overstating his achievement. “_Ca’n’t_ learn no more!”\r\n\r\n“Oh Bruno! You know you _can_, if you like.”\r\n\r\n“Course I can, if I _like_,” the pale student replied; “but I ca’n’t if\r\nI _don’t_ like!”\r\n\r\nSylvie had a way—which I could not too highly admire—of evading Bruno’s\r\nlogical perplexities by suddenly striking into a new line of thought;\r\nand this masterly stratagem she now adopted.\r\n\r\n“Well, I must say _one_ thing——”\r\n\r\n“Did oo know, Mister Sir,” Bruno thoughtfully remarked, “that Sylvie\r\nca’n’t count? Whenever she says ‘I must say _one_ thing,’ I _know_ quite\r\nwell she’ll say _two_ things! And she always doos.”\r\n\r\n“Two heads are better than one, Bruno,” I said, but with no very\r\ndistinct idea as to what I meant by it.\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t mind having two _heads_,” Bruno said softly to himself:\r\n“one head to eat mine dinner, and one head to argue wiz Sylvie—doos oo\r\nthink oo’d look prettier if oo’d got _two_ heads, Mister Sir?”\r\n\r\nThe case did not, I assured him, admit of a doubt.\r\n\r\n“The reason why Sylvie’s so cross——” Bruno went on very seriously,\r\nalmost sadly.\r\n\r\nSylvie’s eyes grew large and round with surprise at this new line of\r\nenquiry—her rosy face being perfectly radiant with good humour. But she\r\nsaid nothing.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t it be better to tell me after the lessons are over?” I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” Bruno said with a resigned air: “only she wo’n’t be cross\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“There’s only three lessons to do,” said Sylvie. “Spelling, and\r\nGeography, and Singing.”\r\n\r\n“Not _Arithmetic_?” I said.\r\n\r\n“No, he hasn’t a head for Arithmetic——”\r\n\r\n“Course I haven’t!” said Bruno. “Mine head’s for _hair_. I haven’t got a\r\n_lot_ of heads!”\r\n\r\n“—and he ca’n’t learn his Multiplication-table——”\r\n\r\n“I like _History_ ever so much better,” Bruno remarked. “Oo has to\r\n_repeat_ that Muddlecome table——”\r\n\r\n“Well, and you have to repeat——”\r\n\r\n“No, oo hasn’t!” Bruno interrupted. “History repeats itself. The\r\nProfessor said so!”\r\n\r\nSylvie was arranging some letters on a board——E—V—I—L. “Now, Bruno,” she\r\nsaid, “what does _that_ spell?”\r\n\r\nBruno looked at it, in solemn silence, for a minute. “I knows what it\r\n_doosn’t_ spell!” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“That’s no good,” said Sylvie. “What _does_ it spell?”\r\n\r\nBruno took another look at the mysterious letters. “Why, it’s ‘LIVE,’\r\nbackwards!” he exclaimed. (I thought it was, indeed.)\r\n\r\n“How _did_ you manage to see that?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“I just twiddled my eyes,” said Bruno, “and then I saw it directly. Now\r\nmay I sing the King-fisher Song?”\r\n\r\n“Geography next,” said Sylvie. “Don’t you know the Rules?”\r\n\r\n“I thinks there oughtn’t to be such a lot of Rules, Sylvie! I thinks——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there _ought_ to be such a lot of Rules, you wicked, wicked boy!\r\nAnd how dare you _think_ at all about it? And shut up that mouth\r\ndirectly!”\r\n\r\nSo, as ‘that mouth’ didn’t seem inclined to shut up of itself, Sylvie\r\nshut it for him—with both hands—and sealed it with a kiss, just as you\r\nwould fasten up a letter.\r\n\r\n“Now that Bruno is fastened up from talking,” she went on, turning to\r\nme, “I’ll show you the Map he does his lessons on.”\r\n\r\nAnd there it was, a large Map of the World, spread out on the ground. It\r\nwas so large that Bruno had to crawl about on it, to point out the\r\nplaces named in the ‘King-fisher Lesson.’\r\n\r\n“When a King-fisher sees a Lady-bird flying away, he says ‘_Ceylon_, if\r\nyou _Candia_!’ And when he catches it, he says ‘Come to _Media_! And if\r\nyou’re _Hungary_ or thirsty, I’ll give you some _Nubia_!’ When he takes\r\nit in his claws, he says ‘_Europe!_’ When he puts it into his beak, he\r\nsays ‘_India!_’ When he’s swallowed it, he says ‘_Eton!_’ That’s all.”\r\n\r\n“That’s _quite_ perfect,” said Sylvie. “Now you may sing the King-fisher\r\nSong.”\r\n\r\n“Will _oo_ sing the chorus?” Bruno said to me.\r\n\r\nI was just beginning to say “I’m afraid I don’t know the _words_,” when\r\nSylvie silently turned the map over, and I found the words were all\r\nwritten on the back. In one respect it was a _very_ peculiar song: the\r\nchorus to each verse came in the _middle_, instead of at the _end_ of\r\nit. However, the tune was so easy that I soon picked it up, and managed\r\nthe chorus as well, perhaps, as it is possible for _one_ person to\r\nmanage such a thing. It was in vain that I signed to Sylvie to help me:\r\nshe only smiled sweetly and shook her head.\r\n\r\n  “King Fisher courted Lady Bird—\r\n  _Sing Beans, sing Bones, sing Butterflies!_\r\n    ‘Find me my match,’ he said,\r\n    ‘With such a noble head—\r\n  With such a beard, as white as curd—\r\n    With such expressive eyes!’\r\n\r\n  “‘Yet pins have heads,’ said Lady Bird—\r\n  _Sing Prunes, sing Prawns, sing Primrose-Hill!_\r\n    ‘And, where you stick them in,\r\n    They stay, and thus a pin\r\n  Is very much to be preferred\r\n    To one that’s never still!’\r\n\r\n  “‘Oysters have beards,’ said Lady Bird—\r\n  _Sing Flies, sing Frogs, sing Fiddle-strings!_\r\n    ‘I love them, for I know\r\n    _They_ never chatter so:\r\n  They would not say one single word—\r\n    Not if you crowned them Kings!’\r\n\r\n  “‘Needles have eyes,’ said Lady Bird—\r\n  _Sing Cats, sing Corks, sing Cowslip-tea!_\r\n      ‘And they are sharp—just what\r\n      Your Majesty is _not:_\r\n  So get you gone—’tis too absurd\r\n      To come a-courting _me_!’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING FISHER’S WOOING]\r\n\r\n“So he went away,” Bruno added as a kind of postscript, when the last\r\nnote of the song had died away. “Just like he always did.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my _dear_ Bruno!” Sylvie exclaimed, with her hands over her ears.\r\n“You shouldn’t say ‘like’: you should say ‘_what_.’”\r\n\r\nTo which Bruno replied, doggedly, “I only says ‘what!’ when oo doosn’t\r\nspeak loud, so as I can hear oo.”\r\n\r\n“Where did he go to?” I asked, hoping to prevent an argument.\r\n\r\n“He went more far than he’d never been before,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“You should never say ‘more far,’” Sylvie corrected him: “you should say\r\n‘_farther_.’”\r\n\r\n“Then _oo_ shouldn’t say ‘more broth,’ when we’re at dinner,” Bruno\r\nretorted: “oo should say ‘_brother_’!”\r\n\r\nThis time Sylvie evaded an argument by turning away, and beginning to\r\nroll up the Map. “Lessons are over!” she proclaimed in her sweetest\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n“And has there been no _crying_ over them?” I enquired. “Little boys\r\n_always_ cry over their lessons, don’t they?”\r\n\r\n“I never cries after twelve o’clock,” said Bruno: “’cause then it’s\r\ngetting so near to dinner-time.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, in the morning,” Sylvie said in a low voice; “when it’s\r\nGeography-day, and when he’s been disobe——”\r\n\r\n“_What_ a fellow you are to talk, Sylvie!” Bruno hastily interposed.\r\n“Doos oo think the world was _made_ for oo to talk in?”\r\n\r\n“Why, where would you _have_ me talk, then?” Sylvie said, evidently\r\nquite ready for an argument.\r\n\r\nBut Bruno answered resolutely. “I’m not going to argue about it, ’cause\r\nit’s getting late, and there wo’n’t be time—but oo’s as ’ong as ever oo\r\ncan be!” And he rubbed the back of his hand across his eyes, in which\r\ntears were beginning to glitter.\r\n\r\n_Sylvie’s_ eyes filled with tears in a moment. “I didn’t mean it, Bruno,\r\n_darling_!” she whispered; and the rest of the argument was lost ‘amid\r\nthe tangles of Neæra’s hair,’ while the two disputants hugged and kissed\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nBut this new form of argument was brought to a sudden end by a flash of\r\nlightning, which was closely followed by a peal of thunder, and by a\r\ntorrent of rain-drops, which came hissing and spitting, almost like live\r\ncreatures, through the leaves of the tree that sheltered us.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s raining cats and dogs!” I said.\r\n\r\n“And all the _dogs_ has come down _first_,” said Bruno: “there’s nothing\r\nbut _cats_ coming down now!”\r\n\r\nIn another minute the pattering ceased, as suddenly as it had begun. I\r\nstepped out from under the tree, and found that the storm was over; but\r\nI looked in vain, on my return, for my tiny companions. They had\r\nvanished with the storm, and there was nothing for it but to make the\r\nbest of my way home.\r\n\r\nOn the table lay, awaiting my return, an envelope of that peculiar\r\nyellow tint which always announces a telegram, and which must be, in the\r\nmemories of so many of us, inseparably linked with some great and sudden\r\nsorrow—something that has cast a shadow, never in this world to be\r\nwholly lifted off, on the brightness of Life. No doubt it has _also_\r\nheralded—for many of us—some sudden news of joy; but this, I think, is\r\nless common: human life seems, on the whole, to contain more of sorrow\r\nthan of joy. And yet the world goes on. Who knows why?\r\n\r\nThis time, however, there was no shock of sorrow to be faced: in fact,\r\nthe few words it contained (“Could not bring myself to write. Come soon.\r\nAlways welcome. A letter follows this. Arthur.”) seemed so like Arthur\r\nhimself speaking, that it gave me quite a thrill of pleasure, and I at\r\nonce began the preparations needed for the journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                             LOVE’S CURFEW.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fayfield Junction! Change for Elveston!”\r\n\r\nWhat subtle memory could there be, linked to these commonplace words,\r\nthat caused such a flood of happy thoughts to fill my brain? I\r\ndismounted from the carriage in a state of joyful excitement for which I\r\ncould not at first account. True, I had taken this very journey, and at\r\nthe same hour of the day, six months ago; but many things had happened\r\nsince then, and an old man’s memory has but a slender hold on recent\r\nevents: I sought ‘the missing link’ in vain. Suddenly I caught sight of\r\na bench—the only one provided on the cheerless platform—with a lady\r\nseated on it, and the whole forgotten scene flashed upon me as vividly\r\nas if it were happening over again.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I thought. “This bare platform is, for me, rich with the memory\r\nof a dear friend! She was sitting on that very bench, and invited me to\r\nshare it, with some quotation from Shakespeare—I forget what. I’ll try\r\nthe Earl’s plan for the Dramatisation of Life, and fancy that figure to\r\nbe Lady Muriel; and I won’t undeceive myself too soon!”\r\n\r\nSo I strolled along the platform, resolutely ‘making-believe’ (as\r\nchildren say) that the casual passenger, seated on that bench, was the\r\nLady Muriel I remembered so well. She was facing away from me, which\r\naided the elaborate cheatery I was practising on myself: but, though I\r\nwas careful, in passing the spot, to look the other way, in order to\r\nprolong the pleasant illusion, it was inevitable that, when I turned to\r\nwalk back again, I should see who it was. It was Lady Muriel herself!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘SPEND IT ALL FOR MINNIE’]\r\n\r\nThe whole scene now returned vividly to my memory; and, to make this\r\nrepetition of it stranger still, there was the same old man, whom I\r\nremembered seeing so roughly ordered off, by the Station-Master, to make\r\nroom for his titled passenger. The same, but ‘with a difference’: no\r\nlonger tottering feebly along the platform, but actually seated at Lady\r\nMuriel’s side, and in conversation with her! “Yes, put it in your\r\npurse,” she was saying, “and remember you’re to spend it all for\r\n_Minnie_. And mind you bring her something nice, that’ll do her real\r\ngood! And give her my love!” So intent was she on saying these words,\r\nthat, although the sound of my footstep had made her lift her head and\r\nlook at me, she did not at first recognise me.\r\n\r\nI raised my hat as I approached, and then there flashed across her face\r\na genuine look of joy, which so exactly recalled the sweet face of\r\nSylvie, when last we met in Kensington Gardens, that I felt quite\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\nRather than disturb the poor old man at her side, she rose from her\r\nseat, and joined me in my walk up and down the platform, and for a\r\nminute or two our conversation was as utterly trivial and commonplace as\r\nif we were merely two casual guests in a London drawing-room. Each of us\r\nseemed to shrink, just at first, from touching on the deeper interests\r\nwhich linked our lives together.\r\n\r\nThe Elveston train had drawn up at the platform, while we talked; and,\r\nin obedience to the Station-Master’s obsequious hint of “This way, my\r\nLady! Time’s up!”, we were making the best of our way towards the end\r\nwhich contained the sole first-class carriage, and were just passing the\r\nnow-empty bench, when Lady Muriel noticed, lying on it, the purse in\r\nwhich her gift had just been so carefully bestowed, the owner of which,\r\nall unconscious of his loss, was being helped into a carriage at the\r\nother end of the train. She pounced on it instantly. “Poor old man!” she\r\ncried. “He mustn’t go off, and think he’s lost it!”\r\n\r\n“Let _me_ run with it! I can go quicker than you!” I said. But she was\r\nalready half-way down the platform, flying (‘running’ is much too\r\nmundane a word for such fairy-like motion) at a pace that left all\r\npossible efforts of _mine_ hopelessly in the rear.\r\n\r\nShe was back again before I had well completed my audacious boast of\r\nspeed in running, and was saying, quite demurely, as we entered our\r\ncarriage, “and you really think _you_ could have done it quicker?”\r\n\r\n“No indeed!” I replied. “I plead ‘Guilty’ of gross exaggeration, and\r\nthrow myself on the mercy of the Court!”\r\n\r\n“The Court will overlook it—for this once!” Then her manner suddenly\r\nchanged from playfulness to an anxious gravity.\r\n\r\n“You are not looking your best!” she said with an anxious glance. “In\r\nfact, I think you look _more_ of an invalid than when you left us. I\r\nvery much doubt if London agrees with you?”\r\n\r\n“It _may_ be the London air,” I said, “or it may be the hard work—or my\r\nrather lonely life: anyhow, I’ve _not_ been feeling very well, lately.\r\nBut Elveston will soon set me up again. Arthur’s prescription—he’s my\r\ndoctor, you know, and I heard from him this morning—is ‘plenty of ozone,\r\nand new milk, and _pleasant society_’!”\r\n\r\n“Pleasant society?” said Lady Muriel, with a pretty make-believe of\r\nconsidering the question. “Well, really I don’t know where we can find\r\n_that_ for you! We have so few neighbours. But new milk we _can_ manage.\r\nDo get it of my old friend Mrs. Hunter, up there, on the hill-side. You\r\nmay rely upon the _quality_. And her little Bessie comes to school every\r\nday, and passes your lodgings. So it would be very easy to send it.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll follow your advice, with pleasure,” I said; “and I’ll go and\r\narrange about it tomorrow. I know Arthur will want a walk.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll find it quite an easy walk—under three miles, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now that we’ve settled that point, let me retort your own remark\r\nupon yourself. I don’t think _you’re_ looking quite your best!”\r\n\r\n“I daresay not,” she replied in a low voice; and a sudden shadow seemed\r\nto overspread her face. “I’ve had some troubles lately. It’s a matter\r\nabout which I’ve been long wishing to consult you, but I couldn’t easily\r\nwrite about it. I’m _so_ glad to have this opportunity!”\r\n\r\n“Do you think,” she began again, after a minute’s silence, and with a\r\nvisible embarrassment of manner most unusual in her, “that a promise,\r\ndeliberately and solemnly given, is _always_ binding—except, of course,\r\nwhere its fulfilment would involve some actual _sin_?”\r\n\r\n“I ca’n’t think of any other exception at this moment,” I said. “That\r\nbranch of casuistry is usually, I believe, treated as a question of\r\ntruth and untruth——”\r\n\r\n“Surely that _is_ the principle?” she eagerly interrupted. “I always\r\nthought the Bible-teaching about it consisted of such texts as ‘_lie not\r\none to another_’?”\r\n\r\n“I have thought about that point,” I replied; “and it seems to me that\r\nthe essence of _lying_ is the intention of _deceiving_. If you give a\r\npromise, fully _intending_ to fulfil it, you are certainly acting\r\ntruthfully _then_; and, if you afterwards break it, that does not\r\ninvolve any _deception_. I cannot call it _untruthful_.”\r\n\r\nAnother pause of silence ensued. Lady Muriel’s face was hard to read:\r\nshe looked pleased, I thought, but also puzzled; and I felt curious to\r\nknow whether her question had, as I began to suspect, some bearing on\r\nthe breaking off of her engagement with Captain (now Major) Lindon.\r\n\r\n“You have relieved me from a great fear,” she said; “but the thing is of\r\ncourse _wrong_, somehow. What texts would _you_ quote, to prove it\r\nwrong?”\r\n\r\n“Any that enforce the payment of _debts_. If _A_ promises something to\r\n_B_, _B_ has a claim upon _A_. And _A_’s sin, if he breaks his promise,\r\nseems to me more analogous to _stealing_ than to _lying_.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a new way of looking at it—to me,” she said; “but it seems a\r\n_true_ way, also. However, I won’t deal in generalities, with an old\r\nfriend like you! For we _are_ old friends, somehow. Do you know, I think\r\nwe _began_ as old friends?” she said with a playfulness of tone that ill\r\naccorded with the tears that glistened in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much for saying so,” I replied. “I like to think of you\r\nas an _old_ friend,” (“—though you don’t look it!” would have been the\r\nalmost necessary sequence, with any other lady; but she and I seemed to\r\nhave long passed out of the time when compliments, or any such\r\ntrivialities, were possible.)\r\n\r\nHere the train paused at a station, where two or three passengers\r\nentered the carriage; so no more was said till we had reached our\r\njourney’s end.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Elveston, she readily adopted my suggestion that we\r\nshould walk up together; so, as soon as our luggage had been duly taken\r\ncharge of—hers by the servant who met her at the station, and mine by\r\none of the porters—we set out together along the familiar lanes, now\r\nlinked in my memory with so many delightful associations. Lady Muriel at\r\nonce recommenced the conversation at the point where it had been\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n“You knew of my engagement to my cousin Eric. Did you also hear——”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I interrupted, anxious to spare her the pain of giving any\r\ndetails. “I heard it had all come to an end.”\r\n\r\n“I would like to tell you how it happened,” she said; “as that is the\r\nvery point I want your advice about. I had long realised that we were\r\nnot in sympathy in religious belief. His ideas of Christianity are very\r\nshadowy; and even as to the existence of a God he lives in a sort of\r\ndreamland. But it has not affected his life! I feel sure, now, that the\r\nmost absolute Atheist _may_ be leading, though walking blindfold, a pure\r\nand noble life. And if you knew half the good deeds——” she broke off\r\nsuddenly, and turned away her head.\r\n\r\n“I entirely agree with you,” I said. “And have we not our Saviour’s own\r\npromise that such a life shall surely lead to the light?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know it,” she said in a broken voice, still keeping her head\r\nturned away. “And so I told him. He said he would believe, for _my_\r\nsake, if he could. And he wished, for _my_ sake, he could see things as\r\nI did. But that is all wrong!” she went on passionately. “God _cannot_\r\napprove such low motives as that! Still it was not _I_ that broke it\r\noff. I knew he loved me; and I had _promised_; and——”\r\n\r\n“Then it was _he_ that broke it off?”\r\n\r\n“He released me unconditionally.” She faced me again now, having quite\r\nrecovered her usual calmness of manner.\r\n\r\n“Then what difficulty remains?”\r\n\r\n“It is _this_, that I don’t believe he did it of his own free will. Now,\r\nsupposing he did it _against_ his will, merely to satisfy my scruples,\r\nwould not his claim on me remain just as strong as ever? And would not\r\nmy promise be as binding as ever? My father says ‘no’; but I ca’n’t help\r\nfearing he is biased by his love for me. And I’ve asked no one else. I\r\nhave many friends—friends for the bright sunny weather; not friends for\r\nthe clouds and storms of life; not _old_ friends like you!”\r\n\r\n“Let me think a little,” I said: and for some minutes we walked on in\r\nsilence, while, pained to the heart at seeing the bitter trial that had\r\ncome upon this pure and gentle soul, I strove in vain to see my way\r\nthrough the tangled skein of conflicting motives.\r\n\r\n“If she loves him truly,” (I seemed at last to grasp the clue to the\r\nproblem) “is not _that_, for her, the voice of God? May she not hope\r\nthat she is sent to him, even as Ananias was sent to Saul in his\r\nblindness, that he may receive his sight?” Once more I seemed to hear\r\nArthur whispering “_What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save\r\nthy husband?_” and I broke the silence with the words “If you still love\r\nhim truly——”\r\n\r\n“I do _not_!” she hastily interrupted. “At least—not in _that_ way. I\r\n_believe_ I loved him when I promised; but I was very young: it is hard\r\nto know. But, whatever the feeling was, it is dead _now_. The motive on\r\n_his_ side is Love: on _mine_ it is—Duty!”\r\n\r\nAgain there was a long silence. The whole skein of thought was tangled\r\nworse than ever. This time _she_ broke the silence. “Don’t misunderstand\r\nme!” she said. “When I said my heart was not _his_, I did not mean it\r\nwas any one else’s! At present I feel bound to _him_; and, till I know I\r\nam absolutely free, in the sight of God, to love any other than him,\r\nI’ll never even _think_ of any one else—in _that_ way, I mean. I would\r\ndie sooner!” I had never imagined my gentle friend capable of such\r\npassionate utterances.\r\n\r\nI ventured on no further remark until we had nearly arrived at the\r\nHall-gate; but, the longer I reflected, the clearer it became to me that\r\nno call of Duty demanded the sacrifice—possibly of the happiness of a\r\nlife—which she seemed ready to make. I tried to make this clear to _her_\r\nalso, adding some warnings on the dangers that surely awaited a union in\r\nwhich mutual love was wanting. “The only argument for it, worth\r\nconsidering,” I said in conclusion, “seems to be his supposed\r\n_reluctance_ in releasing you from your promise. I have tried to give to\r\nthat argument its _full_ weight, and my conclusion is that it does _not_\r\naffect the rights of the case, or invalidate the release he has given\r\nyou. My belief is that you are _entirely_ free to act as _now_ seems\r\nright.”\r\n\r\n“I am _very_ grateful to you,” she said earnestly. “Believe it, please!\r\nI ca’n’t put it into proper words!” and the subject was dropped by\r\nmutual consent: and I only learned, long afterwards, that our discussion\r\nhad really served to dispel the doubts that had harassed her so long.\r\n\r\nWe parted at the Hall-gate, and I found Arthur eagerly awaiting my\r\narrival; and, before we parted for the night, I had heard the whole\r\nstory—how he had put off his journey from day to day, feeling that he\r\n_could_ not go away from the place till his fate had been irrevocably\r\nsettled by the wedding taking place: how the preparations for the\r\nwedding, and the excitement in the neighbourhood, had suddenly come to\r\nan end, and he had learned (from Major Lindon, who called to wish him\r\ngood-bye) that the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent: how\r\nhe had instantly abandoned all his plans for going abroad, and had\r\ndecided to stay on at Elveston, for a year or two at any rate, till his\r\nnewly-awakened hopes should prove true or false; and how, since that\r\nmemorable day, he had avoided all meetings with Lady Muriel, fearing to\r\nbetray his feelings before he had had any sufficient evidence as to how\r\nshe regarded him. “But it is nearly six weeks since all that happened,”\r\nhe said in conclusion, “and we can meet in the ordinary way, now, with\r\nno need for any painful allusions. I would have written to tell you all\r\nthis: only I kept hoping from day to day, that—that there would be\r\n_more_ to tell!”\r\n\r\n“And how should there be _more_, you foolish fellow,” I fondly urged,\r\n“if you never even go near her? Do you expect the offer to come from\r\n_her_?”\r\n\r\nArthur was betrayed into a smile. “No,” he said, “I hardly expect\r\n_that_. But I’m a desperate coward. There’s no doubt about it!”\r\n\r\n“And what _reasons_ have you heard of for breaking off the engagement?”\r\n\r\n“A good many,” Arthur replied, and proceeded to count them on his\r\nfingers. “First, it was found that she was dying of—something; so _he_\r\nbroke it off. Then it was found that _he_ was dying of—some other thing;\r\nso _she_ broke it off. Then the Major turned out to be a confirmed\r\ngamester; so the _Earl_ broke it off. Then the Earl insulted him; so the\r\n_Major_ broke it off. It got a good deal broken off, all things\r\nconsidered!”\r\n\r\n“You have all this on the very best authority, of course?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly! And communicated in the strictest confidence! Whatever\r\ndefects Elveston society suffers from, _want of information_ isn’t one\r\nof them!”\r\n\r\n“Nor _reticence_, either, it seems. But, seriously, do you know the real\r\nreason?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m quite in the dark.”\r\n\r\nI did not feel that I had any right to enlighten him; so I changed the\r\nsubject, to the less engrossing one of “new milk,” and we agreed that I\r\nshould walk over, next day, to Hunter’s farm, Arthur undertaking to set\r\nme part of the way, after which he had to return to keep a\r\nbusiness-engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                            STREAKS OF DAWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day proved warm and sunny, and we started early, to enjoy the\r\nluxury of a good long chat before he would be obliged to leave me.\r\n\r\n“This neighbourhood has more than its due proportion of the _very_\r\npoor,” I remarked, as we passed a group of hovels, too dilapidated to\r\ndeserve the name of “cottages.”\r\n\r\n“But the few rich,” Arthur replied, “give more than their due proportion\r\nof help in charity. So the balance is kept.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose the _Earl_ does a good deal?”\r\n\r\n“He _gives_ liberally; but he has not the health or strength to do more.\r\nLady Muriel does more in the way of school-teaching and cottage-visiting\r\nthan she would like me to reveal.”\r\n\r\n“Then _she_, at least, is not one of the ‘idle mouths’ one so often\r\nmeets with among the upper classes. I have sometimes thought they would\r\nhave a hard time of it, if suddenly called on to give their _raison\r\nd’être_, and to show cause why they should be allowed to live any\r\nlonger!”\r\n\r\n“The whole subject,” said Arthur, “of what we may call ‘idle mouths’ (I\r\nmean persons who absorb some of the material _wealth_ of a community—in\r\nthe form of food, clothes, and so on—without contributing its equivalent\r\nin the form of productive _labour_) is a complicated one, no doubt. I’ve\r\ntried to think it out. And it seemed to me that the simplest form of the\r\nproblem, to start with, is a community without _money_, who buy and sell\r\nby _barter_ only; and it makes it yet simpler to suppose the food and\r\nother things to be capable of _keeping_ for many years without\r\nspoiling.”\r\n\r\n“Yours is an excellent plan,” I said. “What is your solution of the\r\nproblem?”\r\n\r\n“The commonest type of ‘idle mouths,’” said Arthur, “is no doubt due to\r\nmoney being left by parents to their own children. So I imagined a\r\nman—either exceptionally clever, or exceptionally strong and\r\nindustrious—who had contributed so much valuable labour to the needs of\r\nthe community that its equivalent, in clothes, &c., was (say) five times\r\nas much as he needed for himself. We cannot deny his _absolute_ right to\r\ngive the superfluous wealth as he chooses. So, if he leaves _four_\r\nchildren behind him (say two sons and two daughters), with enough of all\r\nthe necessaries of life to last them a life-time, I cannot see that the\r\n_community_ is in any way wronged if they choose to do nothing in life\r\nbut to ‘eat, drink, and be merry.’ Most certainly, the community could\r\nnot fairly say, in reference to _them_, ‘_if a man will not work,\r\nneither let him eat_.’ Their reply would be crushing. ‘The labour has\r\nalready been _done_, which is a fair equivalent for the food we are\r\neating; and you have had the benefit of it. On what principle of justice\r\ncan you demand _two_ quotas of work for _one_ quota of food?’”\r\n\r\n“Yet surely,” I said, “there is something wrong _somewhere_, if these\r\nfour people are well able to do useful work, and if that work is\r\nactually _needed_ by the community, and they elect to sit idle?”\r\n\r\n“I think there _is_,” said Arthur: “but it seems to me to arise from a\r\nLaw of God—that every one shall do as much as he can to help others—and\r\nnot from any _rights_, on the part of the community, to exact labour as\r\nan equivalent for food that has already been fairly earned.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose the _second_ form of the problem is where the ‘idle mouths’\r\npossess _money_ instead of _material_ wealth?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Arthur: “and I think the simplest case is that of\r\n_paper_-money. _Gold_ is itself a form of material wealth; but a\r\nbank-note is merely a _promise_ to hand over so much _material_ wealth\r\nwhen called upon to do so. The father of these four ‘idle mouths,’ had\r\ndone (let us say) five thousand pounds’ worth of useful work for the\r\ncommunity. In return for this, the community had given him what amounted\r\nto a written promise to hand over, whenever called upon to do so, five\r\nthousand pounds’ worth of food, &c. Then, if he only uses _one_ thousand\r\npounds’ worth himself, and leaves the rest of the notes to his children,\r\nsurely they have a full right to _present_ these written promises, and\r\nto say ‘hand over the food, for which the equivalent labour has been\r\nalready done.’ Now I think _this_ case well worth stating, publicly and\r\nclearly. I should like to drive it into the heads of those Socialists\r\nwho are priming our ignorant paupers with such sentiments as ‘Look at\r\nthem bloated haristocrats! Doing not a stroke o’ work for theirselves,\r\nand living on the sweat of _our_ brows!’ I should like to _force_ them\r\nto see that the _money_, which those ‘haristocrats’ are spending,\r\nrepresents so much labour _already done_ for the community, and whose\r\nequivalent, in _material_ wealth, is _due from the community_.”\r\n\r\n“Might not the Socialists reply ‘Much of this money does not represent\r\n_honest_ labour _at all_. If you could trace it back, from owner to\r\nowner, though you might begin with several legitimate steps, such as\r\ngift, or bequeathing by will, or ‘value received,’ you would soon reach\r\nan owner who had no moral right to it, but had got it by fraud or other\r\ncrimes; and of course his successors in the line would have no better\r\nright to it than _he_ had.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt, no doubt,” Arthur replied. “But surely that involves the\r\nlogical fallacy of _proving too much_? It is _quite_ as applicable to\r\n_material_ wealth, as it is to _money_. If we once begin to go back\r\nbeyond the fact that the _present_ owner of certain property came by it\r\nhonestly, and to ask whether any previous owner, in past ages, got it by\r\nfraud, would _any_ property be secure?”\r\n\r\nAfter a minute’s thought, I felt obliged to admit the truth of this.\r\n\r\n“My general conclusion,” Arthur continued, “from the mere standpoint of\r\nhuman _rights_, man against man, was this—that if some wealthy ‘idle\r\nmouth,’ who has come by his money in a lawful way, even though not one\r\natom of the labour it represents has been his own doing, chooses to\r\nspend it on his own needs, without contributing any labour to the\r\ncommunity from whom he buys his food and clothes, that community has no\r\n_right_ to interfere with him. But it’s quite another thing, when we\r\ncome to consider the _divine_ law. Measured by _that_ standard, such a\r\nman is undoubtedly doing wrong, if he fails to use, for the good of\r\nthose in need, the strength or the skill, that God has given him. That\r\nstrength and skill do _not_ belong to the community, to be paid to\r\n_them_ as a _debt_: they do _not_ belong to the man _himself_, to be\r\nused for his _own_ enjoyment: they _do_ belong to God, to be used\r\naccording to _His_ will; and we are not left in doubt as to what that\r\nwill is. ‘_Do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again._’”\r\n\r\n“Anyhow,” I said, “an ‘idle mouth’ very often gives away a great deal in\r\ncharity.”\r\n\r\n“In _so-called_ ‘charity,’” he corrected me. “Excuse me if I seem to\r\nspeak _un_charitably. I would not dream of _applying_ the term to any\r\n_individual_. But I would say, _generally_, that a man who gratifies\r\nevery fancy that occurs to him—denying himself in _nothing_—and merely\r\ngives to the poor some part, or even _all_, of his _superfluous_ wealth,\r\nis only deceiving himself if he calls it _charity_.”\r\n\r\n“But, even in giving away _superfluous_ wealth, he _may_ be denying\r\nhimself the miser’s pleasure in hoarding?”\r\n\r\n“I grant you that, gladly,” said Arthur. “Given that he _has_ that\r\nmorbid craving, he is doing a good deed in restraining it.”\r\n\r\n“But, even in spending on _himself_,” I persisted, “our typical rich man\r\noften does good, by employing people who would otherwise be out of work:\r\nand that is often better than pauperising them by _giving_ the money.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you’ve said that!” said Arthur. “I would not like to quit the\r\nsubject without exposing the _two_ fallacies of that statement—which\r\nhave gone so long uncontradicted that Society now accepts it as an\r\naxiom!”\r\n\r\n“What are they?” I said. “I don’t even see _one_, myself.”\r\n\r\n“One is merely the fallacy of _ambiguity_—the assumption that ‘_doing\r\ngood_’ (that is, benefiting somebody) is necessarily _a good thing to\r\ndo_ (that is, a _right_ thing). The other is the assumption that, if one\r\nof two specified acts is _better_ than another, it is necessarily a\r\n_good_ act in itself. I should like to call this the fallacy of\r\n_comparison_—meaning that it assumes that what is _comparatively_ good\r\nis therefore _positively_ good.”\r\n\r\n“Then what is _your_ test of a good act?”\r\n\r\n“That it shall be _our best_,” Arthur confidently replied. “And even\r\n_then_ ‘_we are unprofitable servants_.’ But let me illustrate the two\r\nfallacies. Nothing illustrates a fallacy so well as an extreme case,\r\nwhich fairly comes under it. Suppose I find two children drowning in a\r\npond. I rush in, and save one of the children, and then walk away,\r\nleaving the other to drown. Clearly I have ‘_done good_,’ in saving a\r\nchild’s life? But——. Again, supposing I meet an inoffensive stranger,\r\nand knock him down, and walk on. Clearly that is ‘_better_’ than if I\r\nhad proceeded to jump upon him and break his ribs? But——”\r\n\r\n“Those ‘buts’ are quite unanswerable,” I said. “But I should like an\r\ninstance from _real_ life.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let us take one of those abominations of modern Society, a\r\nCharity-Bazaar. It’s an interesting question to think out—how much of\r\nthe money, that reaches the object in view, is _genuine_ charity; and\r\nwhether even _that_ is spent in the _best_ way. But the subject needs\r\nregular classification, and analysis, to understand it properly.”\r\n\r\n“I should be glad to _have_ it analysed,” I said: “it has often puzzled\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if I am really not boring you. Let us suppose our Charity-Bazaar\r\nto have been organised to aid the funds of some Hospital: and that A, B,\r\nC _give_ their services in making articles to sell, and in acting as\r\nsalesmen, while X, Y, Z buy the articles, and the money so paid goes to\r\nthe Hospital.\r\n\r\n“There are two distinct species of such Bazaars: one, where the payment\r\nexacted is merely the _market-value_ of the goods supplied, that is,\r\nexactly what you would have to pay at a shop: the other, where\r\n_fancy-prices_ are asked. We must take these separately.\r\n\r\n“First, the ‘market-value’ case. Here A, B, C are exactly in the same\r\nposition as ordinary shopkeepers; the only difference being that they\r\ngive the proceeds to the Hospital. Practically, they are _giving their\r\nskilled labour_ for the benefit of the Hospital. This seems to me to be\r\ngenuine charity. And I don’t see how they could use it better. But X, Y,\r\nZ, are exactly in the same position as any ordinary purchasers of goods.\r\nTo talk of ‘charity’ in connection with _their_ share of the business,\r\nis sheer nonsense. Yet they are very likely to do so.\r\n\r\n“Secondly, the case of ‘fancy-prices.’ Here I think the simplest plan is\r\nto divide the payment into two parts, the ‘market-value’ and the excess\r\nover that. The ‘market-value’ part is on the same footing as in the\r\nfirst case: the _excess_ is all we have to consider. Well, A, B, C do\r\nnot _earn_ it; so we may put _them_ out of the question: it is a _gift_,\r\nfrom X, Y, Z, to the Hospital. And my opinion is that it is not given in\r\nthe best way: far better buy what they choose to _buy_, and give what\r\nthey choose to _give_, as two _separate_ transactions: then there is\r\n_some_ chance that their motive in giving may be real charity, instead\r\nof a mixed motive—half charity, half self-pleasing. ‘The trail of the\r\nserpent is over it all.’ And _therefore_ it is that I hold all such\r\nspurious ‘Charities’ in _utter_ abomination!” He ended with unusual\r\nenergy, and savagely beheaded, with his stick, a tall thistle at the\r\nroad-side, behind which I was startled to see Sylvie and Bruno standing.\r\nI caught at his arm, but too late to stop him. Whether the stick reached\r\nthem, or not, I could not feel sure: at any rate they took not the\r\nsmallest notice of it, but smiled gaily, and nodded to me; and I saw at\r\nonce that they were only visible to _me_: the ‘eerie’ influence had not\r\nreached to _Arthur_.\r\n\r\n“Why did you try to save it?” he said. “_That’s_ not the wheedling\r\nSecretary of a Charity-Bazaar! I only wish it were!” he added grimly.\r\n\r\n“Doos oo know, that stick went right froo my head!” said Bruno. (They\r\nhad run round to me by this time, and each had secured a hand.) “Just\r\nunder my chin! I _are_ glad I aren’t a thistle!”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ve threshed _that_ subject out, anyhow!” Arthur resumed. “I’m\r\nafraid I’ve been talking too much, for _your_ patience and for my\r\nstrength. I must be turning soon. This is about the end of my tether.”\r\n\r\n  “Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee;\r\n  Take, I give it willingly;\r\n  For, invisible to thee,\r\n  Spirits twain have crossed with me!”\r\n\r\nI quoted, involuntarily.\r\n\r\n“For utterly inappropriate and irrelevant quotations,” laughed Arthur,\r\n“you are ‘ekalled by few, and excelled by none’!” And we strolled on.\r\n\r\nAs we passed the head of the lane that led down to the beach, I noticed\r\na single figure, moving slowly along it, seawards. She was a good way\r\noff, and had her back to us: but it was Lady Muriel, unmistakably.\r\nKnowing that Arthur had not seen her, as he had been looking, in the\r\nother direction, at a gathering rain-cloud, I made no remark, but tried\r\nto think of some plausible pretext for sending him back by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity instantly presented itself. “I’m getting tired,” he\r\nsaid. “I don’t think it would be prudent to go further. I had better\r\nturn here.”\r\n\r\nI turned with him, for a few steps, and as we again approached the head\r\nof the lane, I said, as carelessly as I could, “Don’t go back by the\r\nroad. It’s too hot and dusty. Down this lane, and along the beach, is\r\nnearly as short; and you’ll get a breeze off the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think I will,” Arthur began; but at that moment we came into\r\nsight of Lady Muriel, and he checked himself. “No, it’s too far round.\r\nYet it certainly _would_ be cooler——” He stood, hesitating, looking\r\nfirst one way and then the other—a melancholy picture of utter infirmity\r\nof purpose!\r\n\r\nHow long this humiliating scene would have continued, if _I_ had been\r\nthe only external influence, it is impossible to say; for at this moment\r\nSylvie, with a swift decision worthy of Napoleon himself, took the\r\nmatter into her own hands. “You go and drive _her_, up this way,” she\r\nsaid to Bruno. “I’ll get _him_ along!” And she took hold of the stick\r\nthat Arthur was carrying, and gently pulled him down the lane.\r\n\r\nHe was totally unconscious that any will but his own was acting on the\r\nstick, and appeared to think it had taken a horizontal position simply\r\nbecause he was pointing with it. “Are not those _orchises_ under the\r\nhedge there?” he said. “I think that decides me. I’ll gather some as I\r\ngo along.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘ARE NOT THOSE ORCHISES?’]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bruno had run on beyond Lady Muriel, and, with much jumping\r\nabout and shouting (shouts audible to no one but Sylvie and myself),\r\nmuch as if he were driving sheep, he managed to turn her round and make\r\nher walk, with eyes demurely cast upon the ground, in our direction.\r\n\r\nThe victory was ours! And, since it was evident that the lovers, thus\r\nurged together, _must_ meet in another minute, I turned and walked on,\r\nhoping that Sylvie and Bruno would follow my example, as I felt sure\r\nthat the fewer the spectators the better it would be for Arthur and his\r\ngood angel.\r\n\r\n“And what sort of meeting was it?” I wondered, as I paced dreamily on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                             THE DOG-KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n“They shooked hands,” said Bruno, who was trotting at my side, in answer\r\nto the unspoken question.\r\n\r\n“And they looked _ever_ so pleased!” Sylvie added from the other side.\r\n\r\n“Well, we must get on, now, as quick as we can,” I said. “If only I knew\r\nthe best way to Hunter’s farm!”\r\n\r\n“They’ll be sure to know in this cottage,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I suppose they will. Bruno, would you run in and ask?”\r\n\r\nSylvie stopped him, laughingly, as he ran off. “Wait a minute,” she\r\nsaid. “I must make you _visible_ first, you know.”\r\n\r\n“And _audible_ too, I suppose?” I said, as she took the jewel, that hung\r\nround her neck, and waved it over his head, and touched his eyes and\r\nlips with it.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sylvie: “and _once_, do you know, I made him _audible_, and\r\nforgot to make him _visible_! And he went to buy some sweeties in a\r\nshop. And the man _was_ so frightened! A voice seemed to come out of the\r\nair, ‘Please, I want two ounces of barley-sugar drops!’ And a shilling\r\ncame _bang_ down upon the counter! And the man said ‘I ca’n’t _see_\r\nyou!’ And Bruno said ‘It doosn’t sinnify seeing _me_, so long as oo can\r\nsee the _shilling_!’ But the man said he never sold barley-sugar drops\r\nto people he couldn’t _see_. So we had to—_Now_, Bruno, you’re ready!”\r\nAnd away he trotted.\r\n\r\nSylvie spent the time, while we were waiting for him, in making\r\n_herself_ visible also. “It’s rather awkward, you know,” she explained\r\nto me, “when we meet people, and they can see _one_ of us, and ca’n’t\r\nsee the _other_!”\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two Bruno returned, looking rather disconsolate. “He’d\r\ngot friends with him, and he were _cross_!” he said. “He asked me who I\r\nwere. And I said ‘I’m Bruno: who is _these_ peoples?’ And he said ‘One’s\r\nmy half-brother, and t’other’s my half-sister: and I don’t want no more\r\ncompany! Go along with yer!’ And I said ‘I ca’n’t go along _wizout_ mine\r\nself!’ And I said ‘Oo shouldn’t have _bits_ of peoples lying about like\r\nthat! It’s welly untidy!’ And he said ‘Oh, don’t talk to _me_!’ And he\r\npushted me outside! And he shutted the door!”\r\n\r\n“And you never asked where Hunter’s farm was?” queried Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t room for any questions,” said Bruno. “The room were so crowded.”\r\n\r\n“Three people _couldn’t_ crowd a room,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“They _did_, though,” Bruno persisted. “_He_ crowded it most. He’s such\r\na welly _thick_ man—so as oo couldn’t knock him down.”\r\n\r\nI failed to see the drift of Bruno’s argument. “Surely _anybody_ could\r\nbe knocked down,” I said: “thick or thin wouldn’t matter.”\r\n\r\n“Oo couldn’t knock _him_ down,” said Bruno. “He’s more wider than he’s\r\nhigh: so, when he’s lying down, he’s more higher than when he’s\r\nstanding: so a-course oo couldn’t knock him _down_!”\r\n\r\n“Here’s another cottage,” I said: “_I’ll_ ask the way, _this_ time.”\r\n\r\nThere was no need to go in, this time, as the woman was standing in the\r\ndoorway, with a baby in her arms, talking to a respectably dressed man—a\r\nfarmer, as I guessed—who seemed to be on his way to the town.\r\n\r\n“—and when there’s _drink_ to be had,” he was saying, “he’s just the\r\nworst o’ the lot, is your Willie. So they tell me. He gets fairly mad\r\nwi’ it!”\r\n\r\n“I’d have given ’em the lie to their faces, a twelvemonth back!” the\r\nwoman said in a broken voice. “But a’ canna noo! A’ canna noo!” She\r\nchecked herself, on catching sight of us, and hastily retreated into the\r\nhouse, shutting the door after her.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you can tell me where Hunter’s farm is?” I said to the man, as\r\nhe turned away from the house.\r\n\r\n“I can _that_, Sir!” he replied with a smile. “I’m John Hunter hissel,\r\nat your sarvice. It’s nobbut half a mile further—the only house in\r\nsight, when you get round bend o’ the road yonder. You’ll find my good\r\nwoman within, if so be you’ve business wi’ _her_. Or mebbe I’ll do as\r\nwell?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” I said. “I want to order some milk. Perhaps I had better\r\narrange it with your wife?”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” said the man. “_She_ minds all _that_. Good day t’ye, Master—and\r\nto your bonnie childer, as well!” And he trudged on.\r\n\r\n“He should have said ‘_child_,’ not ‘_childer_’,” said Bruno. “Sylvie’s\r\nnot a _childer_!”\r\n\r\n“He meant _both_ of us,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“No, he didn’t!” Bruno persisted. “’cause he said ‘bonnie’, oo know!”\r\n\r\n“Well, at any rate he _looked_ at us both,” Sylvie maintained.\r\n\r\n“Well, then he _must_ have seen we’re not _both_ bonnie!” Bruno\r\nretorted. “A-_course_ I’m much uglier than _oo_! Didn’t he mean\r\n_Sylvie_, Mister Sir?” he shouted over his shoulder, as he ran off.\r\n\r\nBut there was no use in replying, as he had already vanished round the\r\nbend of the road. When we overtook him he was climbing a gate, and was\r\ngazing earnestly into the field, where a horse, a cow, and a kid were\r\nbrowsing amicably together. “For its father, a _Horse_,” he murmured to\r\nhimself. “For its mother, a _Cow_. For their dear little child, a\r\n_little_ Goat, is the most curiousest thing I ever seen in my world!”\r\n\r\n“Bruno’s World!” I pondered. “Yes, I suppose every child has a world of\r\nhis own—and every man, too, for the matter of that. I wonder if _that’s_\r\nthe cause for all the misunderstanding there is in Life?”\r\n\r\n“That _must_ be Hunter’s farm!” said Sylvie, pointing to a house on the\r\nbrow of the hill, led up to by a cart-road. “There’s no other farm in\r\nsight, _this_ way; and you _said_ we must be nearly there by this time.”\r\n\r\nI had _thought_ it, while Bruno was climbing the gate, but I couldn’t\r\nremember having _said_ it. However, Sylvie was evidently in the right.\r\n“Get down, Bruno,” I said, “and open the gate for us.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a good thing we’s with oo, _isn’t_ it, Mister Sir?” said Bruno, as\r\nwe entered the field. “That big dog might have bited oo, if oo’d been\r\nalone! Oo needn’t be _flightened_ of it!” he whispered, clinging tight\r\nto my hand to encourage me. “It aren’t fierce!”\r\n\r\n“Fierce!” Sylvie scornfully echoed, as the dog—a magnificent\r\nNewfoundland—that had come galloping down the field to meet us, began\r\ncurveting round us, in gambols full of graceful beauty, and welcoming us\r\nwith short joyful barks. “Fierce! Why, it’s as gentle as a lamb!\r\nIt’s—why, Bruno, don’t you know it? It’s——”\r\n\r\n“So it _are_!” cried Bruno, rushing forwards and throwing his arms round\r\nits neck. “Oh, you _dear_ dog!” And it seemed as if the two children\r\nwould never have done hugging and stroking it.\r\n\r\n“And how _ever_ did he get _here_?” said Bruno. “Ask him, Sylvie. I\r\ndoosn’t know how.”\r\n\r\nAnd then began an eager talk in Doggee, which of course was lost upon\r\n_me_; and I could only _guess_, when the beautiful creature, with a sly\r\nglance at me, whispered something in Sylvie’s ear, that _I_ was now the\r\nsubject of conversation. Sylvie looked round laughingly.\r\n\r\n“He asked me who you are,” she explained. “And I said ‘He’s our\r\n_friend_.’ And he said ‘What’s his name?’ And I said ‘It’s _Mister\r\nSir_.’ And he said ‘Bosh!’”\r\n\r\n“What is ‘Bosh!’ in Doggee?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“It’s the same as in English,” said Sylvie. “Only, when a _dog_ says it,\r\nit’s a sort of a whisper, that’s half a _cough_ and half a _bark_. Nero,\r\nsay ‘_Bosh!_’”\r\n\r\nAnd Nero, who had now begun gamboling round us again, said “_Bosh!_”\r\nseveral times; and I found that Sylvie’s description of the sound was\r\nperfectly accurate.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what’s behind this long wall?” I said, as we walked on.\r\n\r\n“It’s the _Orchard_,” Sylvie replied, after a consultation with Nero.\r\n“See, there’s a boy getting down off the wall, at that far corner. And\r\nnow he’s running away across the field. I do believe he’s been stealing\r\nthe apples!”\r\n\r\nBruno set off after him, but returned to us in a few moments, as he had\r\nevidently no chance of overtaking the young rascal.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t catch him!” he said. “I wiss I’d started a little sooner.\r\nHis pockets _was_ full of apples!”\r\n\r\nThe Dog-King looked up at Sylvie, and said something in Doggee.\r\n\r\n“Why, of _course_ you can!” Sylvie exclaimed. “How stupid not to think\r\nof it! _Nero_’ll hold him for us, Bruno! But I’d better make him\r\ninvisible, first.” And she hastily got out the Magic Jewel, and began\r\nwaving it over Nero’s head, and down along his back.\r\n\r\n“That’ll do!” cried Bruno, impatiently. “After him, good Doggie!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bruno!” Sylvie exclaimed reproachfully. “You shouldn’t have sent\r\nhim off so quick! I hadn’t done the tail!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Nero was coursing like a greyhound down the field: so at least\r\nI concluded from all _I_ could see of him—the long feathery tail, which\r\nfloated like a meteor through the air—and in a very few seconds he had\r\ncome up with the little thief.\r\n\r\n“He’s got him safe, by one foot!” cried Sylvie, who was eagerly watching\r\nthe chase. “Now there’s no hurry, Bruno!”\r\n\r\nSo we walked, quite leisurely, down the field, to where the frightened\r\nlad stood. A more curious sight I had seldom seen, in all my ‘eerie’\r\nexperiences. Every bit of him was in violent action, except the left\r\nfoot, which was apparently glued to the ground—there being nothing\r\nvisibly holding it: while, at some little distance, the long feathery\r\ntail was waving gracefully from side to side, showing that Nero, at\r\nleast, regarded the whole affair as nothing but a magnificent game of\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with you?” I said, as gravely as I could.\r\n\r\n“Got the crahmp in me ahnkle!” the thief groaned in reply. “An’ me fut’s\r\ngone to sleep!” And he began to blubber aloud.\r\n\r\n“Now, look here!” Bruno said in a commanding tone, getting in front of\r\nhim. “Oo’ve got to give up those apples!”\r\n\r\nThe lad glanced at me, but didn’t seem to reckon _my_ interference as\r\nworth anything. Then he glanced at Sylvie: _she_ clearly didn’t count\r\nfor very much, either. Then he took courage. “It’ll take a better man\r\nthan any of _yer_ to get ’em!” he retorted defiantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A ROYAL THIEF-TAKER]\r\n\r\nSylvie stooped and patted the invisible Nero. “A _little_ tighter!” she\r\nwhispered. And a sharp yell from the ragged boy showed how promptly the\r\nDog-King had taken the hint.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter _now_?” I said. “Is your ankle worse?”\r\n\r\n“And it’ll get worse, and worse, and worse,” Bruno solemnly assured him,\r\n“till oo gives up those apples!”\r\n\r\nApparently the thief was convinced of this at last, and he sulkily began\r\nemptying his pockets of the apples. The children watched from a little\r\ndistance, Bruno dancing with delight at every fresh yell extracted from\r\nNero’s terrified prisoner.\r\n\r\n“That’s all,” the boy said at last.\r\n\r\n“It _isn’t_ all!” cried Bruno. “There’s three more in that pocket!”\r\n\r\nAnother hint from Sylvie to the Dog-King—another sharp yell from the\r\nthief, now convicted of lying also—and the remaining three apples were\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\n“Let him go, please,” Sylvie said in Doggee, and the lad limped away at\r\na great pace, stooping now and then to rub the ailing ankle, in fear,\r\nseemingly, that the ‘crahmp’ might attack it again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘SUMMAT WRONG WI’ MY SPECTACLES!’]\r\n\r\nBruno ran back, with his booty, to the orchard wall, and pitched the\r\napples over it one by one. “I’s welly afraid _some_ of them’s gone under\r\nthe wrong trees!” he panted, on overtaking us again.\r\n\r\n“The _wrong_ trees!” laughed Sylvie. “Trees _ca’n’t_ do wrong! There’s\r\nno such things as _wrong_ trees!”\r\n\r\n“Then there’s no such things as _right_ trees, neither!” cried Bruno.\r\nAnd Sylvie gave up the point.\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, please!” she said to me. “I must make Nero _visible_,\r\nyou know!”\r\n\r\n“No, _please_ don’t!” cried Bruno, who had by this time mounted on the\r\nRoyal back, and was twisting the Royal hair into a bridle. “It’ll be\r\n_such_ fun to have him like this!”\r\n\r\n“Well, it _does_ look funny,” Sylvie admitted, and led the way to the\r\nfarm-house, where the farmer’s wife stood, evidently much perplexed at\r\nthe weird procession now approaching her. “It’s summat gone wrong wi’ my\r\nspectacles, I doubt!” she murmured, as she took them off, and began\r\ndiligently rubbing them with a corner of her apron.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sylvie had hastily pulled Bruno down from his steed, and had\r\njust time to make His Majesty wholly visible before the spectacles were\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nAll was natural, now; but the good woman still looked a little uneasy\r\nabout it. “My eyesight’s getting bad,” she said, “but I see you _now_,\r\nmy darlings! You’ll give me a kiss, wo’n’t you?”\r\n\r\nBruno got behind me, in a moment: however Sylvie put up _her_ face, to\r\nbe kissed, as representative of _both_, and we all went in together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                             MATILDA JANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Come to me, my little gentleman,” said our hostess, lifting Bruno into\r\nher lap, “and tell me everything.”\r\n\r\n“I ca’n’t,” said Bruno. “There wouldn’t be time. Besides, I don’t _know_\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\nThe good woman looked a little puzzled, and turned to Sylvie for help.\r\n“Does he like _riding_?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I _think_ so,” Sylvie gently replied. “He’s just had a ride on\r\n_Nero_.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Nero’s a grand dog, isn’t he? Were you ever outside a _horse_, my\r\nlittle man?”\r\n\r\n“_Always!_” Bruno said with great decision. “Never was _inside_ one. Was\r\n_oo_?”\r\n\r\nHere I thought it well to interpose, and to mention the business on\r\nwhich we had come, and so relieved her, for a few minutes, from Bruno’s\r\nperplexing questions.\r\n\r\n“And those dear children will like a bit of cake, _I’ll_ warrant!” said\r\nthe farmer’s hospitable wife, when the business was concluded, as she\r\nopened her cupboard, and brought out a cake. “And don’t you waste the\r\ncrust, little gentleman!” she added, as she handed a good slice of it to\r\nBruno. “You know what the poetry-book says about wilful waste?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t,” said Bruno. “What doos he say about it?”\r\n\r\n“Tell him, Bessie!” And the mother looked down, proudly and lovingly, on\r\na rosy little maiden, who had just crept shyly into the room, and was\r\nleaning against her knee. “What’s that your poetry-book says about\r\nwilful waste?”\r\n\r\n“_For wilful waste makes woeful want_,” Bessie recited, in an almost\r\ninaudible whisper: “_and you may live to say ‘How much I wish I had the\r\ncrust that then I threw away!’_”\r\n\r\n“Now try if _you_ can say it, my dear! _For wilful_——”\r\n\r\n“_For wifful_—sumfinoruvver—” Bruno began, readily enough; and then\r\nthere came a dead pause. “Ca’n’t remember no more!”\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you _learn_ from it, then? You can tell us _that_, at any\r\nrate?”\r\n\r\nBruno ate a little more cake, and considered: but the moral did not seem\r\nto him to be a very obvious one.\r\n\r\n“Always to——” Sylvie prompted him in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“Always to——” Bruno softly repeated: and then, with sudden inspiration,\r\n“always to look where it goes to!”\r\n\r\n“Where _what_ goes to, darling?”\r\n\r\n“Why the _crust_, a course!” said Bruno. “Then, if I lived to say ‘_How\r\nmuch I wiss I had the crust_—’ (and all that), I’d know where I frew it\r\nto!”\r\n\r\nThis new interpretation quite puzzled the good woman. She returned to\r\nthe subject of ‘Bessie.’ “Wouldn’t you like to see Bessie’s doll, my\r\ndears! Bessie, take the little lady and gentleman to see Matilda Jane!”\r\n\r\nBessie’s shyness thawed away in a moment. “Matilda Jane has just woke\r\nup,” she stated, confidentially, to Sylvie. “Wo’n’t you help me on with\r\nher frock? Them strings _is_ such a bother to tie!”\r\n\r\n“I can tie _strings_,” we heard, in Sylvie’s gentle voice, as the two\r\nlittle girls left the room together. Bruno ignored the whole proceeding,\r\nand strolled to the window, quite with the air of a fashionable\r\ngentleman. Little girls, and dolls, were not at all in his line.\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith the fond mother proceeded to tell me (as what mother is\r\nnot ready to do?) of all Bessie’s virtues (and vices too, for the matter\r\nof that) and of the many fearful maladies which, notwithstanding those\r\nruddy cheeks and that plump little figure, had nearly, time and again,\r\nswept her from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen the full stream of loving memories had nearly run itself out, I\r\nbegan to question her about the working men of that neighbourhood, and\r\nspecially the ‘Willie,’ whom we had heard of at his cottage. “He was a\r\ngood fellow once,” said my kind hostess: “but it’s the drink has ruined\r\nhim! Not that I’d rob them of the drink—it’s good for the most of\r\nthem—but there’s some as is too weak to stand agin’ temptations: it’s a\r\nthousand pities, for _them_, as they ever built the Golden Lion at the\r\ncorner there!”\r\n\r\n“The Golden Lion?” I repeated.\r\n\r\n“It’s the new Public,” my hostess explained. “And it stands right in the\r\nway, and handy for the workmen, as they come back from the brickfields,\r\nas it might be to-day, with their week’s wages. A deal of money gets\r\nwasted that way. And some of ’em gets drunk.”\r\n\r\n“If only they could have it in their own houses—” I mused, hardly\r\nknowing I had said the words out loud.\r\n\r\n“That’s it!” she eagerly exclaimed. It was evidently a solution, of the\r\nproblem, that she had already thought out. “If only you could manage,\r\nso’s each man to have his own little barrel in his own house—there’d\r\nhardly be a drunken man in the length and breadth of the land!”\r\n\r\nAnd then I told her the old story—about a certain cottager who bought\r\nhimself a little barrel of beer, and installed his wife as bar-keeper:\r\nand how, every time he wanted his mug of beer, he regularly paid her\r\nover the counter for it: and how she never would let him go on ‘tick,’\r\nand was a perfectly inflexible bar-keeper in never letting him have more\r\nthan his proper allowance: and how, every time the barrel needed\r\nrefilling, she had plenty to do it with, and something over for her\r\nmoney-box: and how, at the end of the year, he not only found himself in\r\nfirst-rate health and spirits, with that undefinable but quite\r\nunmistakeable air which always distinguishes the sober man from the one\r\nwho takes ‘a drop too much,’ but had quite a box full of money, all\r\nsaved out of his own pence!\r\n\r\n“If only they’d all do like that!” said the good woman, wiping her eyes,\r\nwhich were overflowing with kindly sympathy. “Drink hadn’t need to be\r\nthe curse it is to some——”\r\n\r\n“Only a _curse_,” I said, “when it is used wrongly. Any of God’s gifts\r\nmay be turned into a curse, unless we use it wisely. But we must be\r\ngetting home. Would you call the little girls? Matilda Jane has seen\r\nenough of company, for _one_ day, I’m sure!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll find ’em in a minute,” said my hostess, as she rose to leave the\r\nroom. “Maybe that young gentleman saw which way they went?”\r\n\r\n“Where are they, Bruno?” I said.\r\n\r\n“They ain’t in the field,” was Bruno’s rather evasive reply, “’cause\r\nthere’s nothing but _pigs_ there, and Sylvie isn’t a pig. Now don’t\r\nimperrupt me any more, ’cause I’m telling a story to this fly; and it\r\nwon’t attend!”\r\n\r\n“They’re among the apples, I’ll warrant ’em!” said the Farmer’s wife. So\r\nwe left Bruno to finish his story, and went out into the orchard, where\r\nwe soon came upon the children, walking sedately side by side, Sylvie\r\ncarrying the doll, while little Bess carefully shaded its face, with a\r\nlarge cabbage-leaf for a parasol.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they caught sight of us, little Bess dropped her cabbage-leaf\r\nand came running to meet us, Sylvie following more slowly, as her\r\nprecious charge evidently needed great care and attention.\r\n\r\n“I’m its Mamma, and Sylvie’s the Head-Nurse,” Bessie explained: “and\r\nSylvie’s taught me ever such a pretty song, for me to sing to Matilda\r\nJane!”\r\n\r\n“Let’s hear it once more, Sylvie,” I said, delighted at getting the\r\nchance I had long wished for, of hearing her sing. But Sylvie turned shy\r\nand frightened in a moment. “No, _please_ not!” she said, in an earnest\r\n‘aside’ to me. “Bessie knows it quite perfect now. Bessie can sing it!”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye! Let Bessie sing it!” said the proud mother. “Bessie has a\r\nbonny voice of her own,” (this again was an ‘aside’ to me) “though I say\r\nit as shouldn’t!”\r\n\r\nBessie was only too happy to accept the ‘encore.’ So the plump little\r\nMamma sat down at our feet, with her hideous daughter reclining stiffly\r\nacross her lap (it was one of a kind that wo’n’t sit down, under _any_\r\namount of persuasion), and, with a face simply beaming with delight,\r\nbegan the lullaby, in a shout that _ought_ to have frightened the poor\r\nbaby into fits. The Head-Nurse crouched down behind her, keeping herself\r\nrespectfully in the back-ground, with her hands on the shoulders of her\r\nlittle mistress, so as to be ready to act as Prompter, if required, and\r\nto supply ‘_each gap in faithless memory void_.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BESSIE’S SONG]\r\n\r\nThe shout, with which she began, proved to be only a momentary effort.\r\nAfter a very few notes, Bessie toned down, and sang on in a small but\r\nvery sweet voice. At first her great black eyes were fixed on her\r\nmother, but soon her gaze wandered upwards, among the apples, and she\r\nseemed to have quite forgotten that she had any other audience than her\r\nBaby, and her Head-Nurse, who once or twice supplied, almost inaudibly,\r\nthe right note, when the singer was getting a little ‘flat.’\r\n\r\n  “Matilda Jane, you never look\r\n  At any toy or picture-book:\r\n  I show you pretty things in vain—\r\n  You must be blind, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\n  “I ask you riddles, tell you tales,\r\n  But _all_ our conversation fails:\r\n  You _never_ answer me again—\r\n  I fear you’re dumb, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\n  “Matilda, darling, when I call,\r\n  You never seem to hear at all:\r\n  I shout with all my might and main—\r\n  But you’re _so_ deaf, Matilda Jane!\r\n\r\n  “Matilda Jane, you needn’t mind;\r\n  For, though you’re deaf, and dumb, and blind,\r\n  There’s _some one_ loves you, it is plain—\r\n  And that is _me,_ Matilda Jane!”\r\n\r\nShe sang three of the verses in a rather perfunctory style, but the last\r\nstanza evidently excited the little maiden. Her voice rose, ever clearer\r\nand louder: she had a rapt look on her face, as if suddenly inspired,\r\nand, as she sang the last few words, she clasped to her heart the\r\ninattentive Matilda Jane.\r\n\r\n“Kiss it now!” prompted the Head-Nurse. And in a moment the simpering\r\nmeaningless face of the Baby was covered with a shower of passionate\r\nkisses.\r\n\r\n“What a bonny song!” cried the Farmer’s wife. “Who made the words,\r\ndearie?”\r\n\r\n“I—I think I’ll look for Bruno,” Sylvie said demurely, and left us\r\nhastily. The curious child seemed always afraid of being praised, or\r\neven noticed.\r\n\r\n“Sylvie planned the words,” Bessie informed us, proud of her superior\r\ninformation: “and Bruno planned the music—and _I_ sang it!” (this last\r\ncircumstance, by the way, we did not need to be told).\r\n\r\nSo we followed Sylvie, and all entered the parlour together. Bruno was\r\nstill standing at the window, with his elbows on the sill. He had,\r\napparently, finished the story that he was telling to the fly, and had\r\nfound a new occupation. “Don’t imperrupt!” he said as we came in. “I’m\r\ncounting the Pigs in the field!”\r\n\r\n“How many are there?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“About a thousand and four,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“You mean ‘about a thousand,’” Sylvie corrected him. “There’s no good\r\nsaying ‘_and four_’: you _ca’n’t_ be sure about the four!”\r\n\r\n“And you’re as wrong as ever!” Bruno exclaimed triumphantly. “It’s just\r\nthe _four_ I _can_ be sure about; ’cause they’re here, grubbling under\r\nthe window! It’s the _thousand_ I isn’t pruffickly sure about!”\r\n\r\n“But some of them have gone into the sty,” Sylvie said, leaning over him\r\nto look out of the window.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bruno; “but they went so slowly and so fewly, I didn’t care\r\nto count _them_.”\r\n\r\n“We must be going, children,” I said. “Wish Bessie good-bye.” Sylvie\r\nflung her arms round the little maiden’s neck, and kissed her: but Bruno\r\nstood aloof, looking unusually shy. (“I never kiss _nobody_ but Sylvie!”\r\nhe explained to me afterwards.) The farmer’s wife showed us out: and we\r\nwere soon on our way back to Elveston.\r\n\r\n“And that’s the new public-house that we were talking about, I suppose?”\r\nI said, as we came in sight of a long low building, with the words ‘The\r\nGolden Lion’ over the door.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s it,” said Sylvie. “I wonder if _her_ Willie’s inside? Run\r\nin, Bruno, and see if he’s there.”\r\n\r\nI interposed, feeling that Bruno was, in a sort of way, in _my_ care.\r\n“That’s not a place to send a child into.” For already the revelers were\r\ngetting noisy: and a wild discord of singing, shouting, and meaningless\r\nlaughter came to us through the open windows.\r\n\r\n“They wo’n’t _see_ him, you know,” Sylvie explained. “Wait a minute,\r\nBruno!” She clasped the jewel, that always hung round her neck, between\r\nthe palms of her hands, and muttered a few words to herself. What they\r\nwere I could not at all make out, but some mysterious change seemed\r\ninstantly to pass over us. My feet seemed to me no longer to press the\r\nground, and the dream-like feeling came upon me, that I was suddenly\r\nendowed with the power of floating in the air. I could still just _see_\r\nthe children: but their forms were shadowy and unsubstantial, and their\r\nvoices sounded as if they came from some distant place and time, they\r\nwere so unreal. However, I offered no further opposition to Bruno’s\r\ngoing into the house. He was back again in a few moments. “No, he isn’t\r\ncome yet,” he said. “They’re talking about him inside, and saying how\r\ndrunk he was last week.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, one of the men lounged out through the door, a\r\npipe in one hand and a mug of beer in the other, and crossed to where we\r\nwere standing, so as to get a better view along the road. Two or three\r\nothers leaned out through the open window, each holding his mug of beer,\r\nwith red faces and sleepy eyes. “Canst see him, lad?” one of them asked.\r\n\r\n“I dunnot know,” the man said, taking a step forwards, which brought us\r\nnearly face to face. Sylvie hastily pulled me out of his way. “Thanks,\r\nchild,” I said. “I had forgotten he couldn’t see us. What would have\r\nhappened if I had staid in his way?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” Sylvie said gravely. “It wouldn’t matter to _us_; but\r\n_you_ may be different.” She said this in her usual voice, but the man\r\ntook no sort of notice, though she was standing close in front of him,\r\nand looking up into his face as she spoke.\r\n\r\n“He’s coming now!” cried Bruno, pointing down the road.\r\n\r\n“He be a-coomin noo!” echoed the man, stretching out his arm exactly\r\nover Bruno’s head, and pointing with his pipe.\r\n\r\n“Then _chorus_ agin!” was shouted out by one of the red-faced men in the\r\nwindow: and forthwith a dozen voices yelled, to a harsh discordant\r\nmelody, the refrain:—\r\n\r\n  “There’s him, an’ yo’ an’ me,\r\n            Roarin’ laddies!\r\n  We loves a bit o spree,\r\n  Roarin’ laddies we,\r\n            Roarin’ laddies\r\n            Roarin’ laddies!”\r\n\r\nThe man lounged back again to the house, joining lustily in the chorus\r\nas he went: so that only the children and I were in the road when\r\n‘Willie’ came up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                             WILLIE’S WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe made for the door of the public-house, but the children intercepted\r\nhim. Sylvie clung to one arm; while Bruno, on the opposite side, was\r\npushing him with all his strength, with many inarticulate cries of\r\n“Gee-up! Gee-back! Woah then!” which he had picked up from the\r\nwaggoners.\r\n\r\n‘Willie’ took not the least notice of them: he was simply conscious that\r\n_something_ had checked him: and, for want of any other way of\r\naccounting for it, he seemed to regard it as his own act.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RESCUE OF WILLIE]\r\n\r\n“I wunnut coom in,” he said: “not to-day.”\r\n\r\n“A mug o’ beer wunnut hurt ’ee!” his friends shouted in chorus. “_Two_\r\nmugs wunnut hurt ’ee! Nor a dozen mugs!”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Willie. “I’m agoan whoam.”\r\n\r\n“What, withouten thy drink, Willie man?” shouted the others. But ‘Willie\r\nman’ would have no more discussion, and turned doggedly away, the\r\nchildren keeping one on each side of him, to guard him against any\r\nchange in his sudden resolution.\r\n\r\nFor a while he walked on stoutly enough, keeping his hands in his\r\npockets, and softly whistling a tune, in time to his heavy tread: his\r\nsuccess, in appearing entirely at his ease, was _almost_ complete; but a\r\ncareful observer would have noted that he had forgotten the second part\r\nof the air, and that, when it broke down, he instantly began it again,\r\nbeing too nervous to think of another, and too restless to endure\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nIt was not the old fear that possessed him now—the old fear, that had\r\nbeen his dreary companion every Saturday night he could remember, as he\r\nhad reeled along, steadying himself against gates and garden-palings,\r\nand when the shrill reproaches of his wife had seemed to his dazed brain\r\nonly the echo of a yet more piercing voice within, the intolerable wail\r\nof a hopeless remorse: it was a wholly new fear that had come to him\r\nnow: life had taken on itself a new set of colours, and was lighted up\r\nwith a new and dazzling radiance, and he did not see, as yet, how his\r\nhome-life, and his wife and child, would fit into the new order of\r\nthings: the very novelty of it all was, to his simple mind, a perplexity\r\nand an overwhelming terror.\r\n\r\nAnd now the tune died into sudden silence on the trembling lips, as he\r\nturned a sharp corner, and came in sight of his own cottage, where his\r\nwife stood, leaning with folded arms on the wicket-gate, and looking up\r\nthe road with a pale face, that had in it no glimmer of the light of\r\nhope—only the heavy shadow of a deep stony despair.\r\n\r\n“Fine an’ early, lad! Fine an’ early!” The words might have been words\r\nof welcoming, but oh, the bitterness of the tone in which she said it!\r\n“What brings thee from thy merry mates, and all the fiddling and the\r\njigging? Pockets empty, I doubt? Or thou’st come, mebbe, for to see thy\r\nlittle one die? The bairnie’s clemmed, and I’ve nor bite nor sup to gie\r\nher. But what does _thou_ care?” She flung the gate open, and met him\r\nwith blazing eyes of fury.\r\n\r\nThe man said no word. Slowly, and with downcast eyes, he passed into the\r\nhouse, while she, half terrified at his strange silence, followed him in\r\nwithout another word; and it was not till he had sunk into a chair, with\r\nhis arms crossed on the table and with drooping head, that she found her\r\nvoice again.\r\n\r\nIt seemed entirely natural for us to go in with them: at another time\r\none would have asked leave for this, but I felt, I knew not why, that we\r\nwere in some mysterious way invisible, and as free to come and to go as\r\ndisembodied spirits.\r\n\r\nThe child in the cradle woke up, and raised a piteous cry, which in a\r\nmoment brought the children to its side: Bruno rocked the cradle, while\r\nSylvie tenderly replaced the little head on the pillow from which it had\r\nslipped. But the mother took no heed of the cry, nor yet of the\r\nsatisfied ‘coo’ that it set up when Sylvie had made it happy again: she\r\nonly stood gazing at her husband, and vainly trying, with white\r\nquivering lips (I believe she thought he was mad), to speak in the old\r\ntones of shrill upbraiding that he knew so well.\r\n\r\n“And thou’st spent all thy wages—I’ll swear thou hast—on the devil’s own\r\ndrink—and thou’st been and made thysen a beast again—as thou allus\r\ndost——”\r\n\r\n“Hasna!” the man muttered, his voice hardly rising above a whisper, as\r\nhe slowly emptied his pockets on the table. “There’s th’ wage, Missus,\r\nevery penny on’t.”\r\n\r\nThe woman gasped, and put one hand to her heart, as if under some great\r\nshock of surprise. “Then _how_’s thee gotten th’ drink?”\r\n\r\n“_Hasna_ gotten it,” he answered her, in a tone more sad than sullen. “I\r\nhanna touched a drop this blessed day. No!” he cried aloud, bringing his\r\nclenched fist heavily down upon the table, and looking up at her with\r\ngleaming eyes, “nor I’ll never touch another drop o’ the cursed\r\ndrink—till I die—so help me God my Maker!” His voice, which had suddenly\r\nrisen to a hoarse shout, dropped again as suddenly: and once more he\r\nbowed his head, and buried his face in his folded arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIE’S WIFE]\r\n\r\nThe woman had dropped upon her knees by the cradle, while he was\r\nspeaking. She neither looked at him nor seemed to hear him. With hands\r\nclasped above her head, she rocked herself wildly to and fro. “Oh my\r\nGod! Oh my God!” was all she said, over and over again.\r\n\r\nSylvie and Bruno gently unclasped her hands and drew them down—till she\r\nhad an arm round each of them, though she took no notice of them, but\r\nknelt on with eyes gazing upwards, and lips that moved as if in silent\r\nthanksgiving. The man kept his face hidden, and uttered no sound: but\r\none could _see_ the sobs that shook him from head to foot.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he raised his head—his face all wet with tears. “Polly!”\r\nhe said softly; and then, louder, “Old Poll!”\r\n\r\nThen she rose from her knees and came to him, with a dazed look, as if\r\nshe were walking in her sleep. “Who was it called me old Poll?” she\r\nasked: her voice took on it a tender playfulness: her eyes sparkled; and\r\nthe rosy light of Youth flushed her pale cheeks, till she looked more\r\nlike a happy girl of seventeen than a worn woman of forty. “Was that my\r\nown lad, my Willie, a-waiting for me at the stile?”\r\n\r\nHis face too was transformed, in the same magic light, to the likeness\r\nof a bashful boy: and boy and girl they seemed, as he wound an arm about\r\nher, and drew her to his side, while with the other hand he thrust from\r\nhim the heap of money, as though it were something hateful to the touch.\r\n“Tak it, lass,” he said, “tak it all! An’ fetch us summat to eat: but\r\nget a sup o’ milk, first, for t’ bairn.”\r\n\r\n“My _little_ bairn!” she murmured as she gathered up the coins. “My own\r\nlittle lassie!” Then she moved to the door, and was passing out, but a\r\nsudden thought seemed to arrest her: she hastily returned—first to kneel\r\ndown and kiss the sleeping child, and then to throw herself into her\r\nhusband’s arms and be strained to his heart. The next moment she was on\r\nher way, taking with her a jug that hung on a peg near the door: we\r\nfollowed close behind.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far before we came in sight of a swinging sign-board\r\nbearing the word ‘DAIRY’ on it, and here she went in, welcomed by a\r\nlittle curly white dog, who, not being under the ‘eerie’ influence, saw\r\nthe children, and received them with the most effusive affection. When I\r\ngot inside, the dairyman was in the act of taking the money. “Is’t for\r\nthysen, Missus, or for t’ bairn?” he asked, when he had filled the jug,\r\npausing with it in his hand.\r\n\r\n“For t’ _bairn_!” she said, almost reproachfully. “Think’st tha I’d\r\ntouch a drop _mysen_, while as _she_ hadna got her fill?”\r\n\r\n“All right, Missus,” the man replied, turning away with the jug in his\r\nhand. “Let’s just mak sure it’s good measure.” He went back among his\r\nshelves of milk-bowls, carefully keeping his back towards her while he\r\nemptied a little measure of cream into the jug, muttering to himself\r\n“mebbe it’ll hearten her up a bit, the little lassie!”\r\n\r\nThe woman never noticed the kind deed, but took back the jug with a\r\nsimple “Good evening, Master,” and went her way: but the children had\r\nbeen more observant, and, as we followed her out, Bruno remarked “That\r\nwere _welly_ kind: and I loves that man: and if I was welly rich I’d\r\ngive him a hundred pounds—and a bun. That little grummeling dog doosn’t\r\nknow its business!” He referred to the dairyman’s little dog, who had\r\napparently quite forgotten the affectionate welcome he had given us on\r\nour arrival, and was now following at a respectful distance, doing his\r\nbest to ‘_speed the parting guest_’ with a shower of little shrill\r\nbarks, that seemed to tread on one another’s heels.\r\n\r\n“What _is_ a dog’s business?” laughed Sylvie. “Dogs ca’n’t keep shops\r\nand give change!”\r\n\r\n“Sisters’ businesses _isn’t_ to laugh at their brothers,” Bruno replied\r\nwith perfect gravity. “And dogs’ businesses is to _bark_—not like that:\r\nit should finish one bark before it begins another: and it should—Oh\r\nSylvie, there’s some dindledums!”\r\n\r\nAnd in another moment the happy children were flying across the common,\r\nracing for the patch of dandelions.\r\n\r\nWhile I stood watching them, a strange dreamy feeling came upon me: a\r\nrailway-platform seemed to take the place of the green sward, and,\r\ninstead of the light figure of Sylvie bounding along, I seemed to see\r\nthe flying form of Lady Muriel; but whether Bruno had also undergone a\r\ntransformation, and had become the old man whom she was running to\r\novertake, I was unable to judge, so instantaneously did the feeling come\r\nand go.\r\n\r\nWhen I re-entered the little sitting-room which I shared with Arthur, he\r\nwas standing with his back to me, looking out of the open window, and\r\nevidently had not heard me enter. A cup of tea, apparently just tasted\r\nand pushed aside, stood on the table, on the opposite side of which was\r\na letter, just begun, with the pen lying across it: an open book lay on\r\nthe sofa: the London paper occupied the easy chair; and on the little\r\ntable, which stood by it, I noticed an unlighted cigar and an open box\r\nof cigar-lights: all things betokened that the Doctor, usually so\r\nmethodical and so self-contained, had been trying every form of\r\noccupation, and could settle to none!\r\n\r\n“This is very unlike _you_, Doctor!” I was beginning, but checked\r\nmyself, as he turned at the sound of my voice, in sheer amazement at the\r\nwonderful change that had taken place in his appearance. Never had I\r\nseen a face so radiant with happiness, or eyes that sparkled with such\r\nunearthly light! “Even thus,” I thought, “must the herald-angel have\r\nlooked, who brought to the shepherds, watching over their flocks by\r\nnight, that sweet message of ‘_peace on earth, good-will to men_’!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear friend!” he said, as if in answer to the question that I\r\nsuppose he read in my face. “It is true! It is true!”\r\n\r\nNo need to ask _what_ was true. “God bless you both!” I said, as I felt\r\nthe happy tears brimming to my eyes. “You were made for each other!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, simply, “I believe we were. And _what_ a change it makes\r\nin one’s Life! This isn’t the same world! That isn’t the sky I saw\r\nyesterday! Those clouds—I never saw such clouds in all my life before!\r\nThey look like troops of hovering angels!”\r\n\r\nTo _me_ they looked very ordinary clouds indeed: but then _I_ had not\r\nfed ‘_on honey-dew, And drunk the milk of Paradise_’!\r\n\r\n“She wants to see you—at once,” he continued, descending suddenly to the\r\nthings of earth. “She says _that_ is the _one_ drop yet wanting in her\r\ncup of happiness!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go at once,” I said, as I turned to leave the room. “Wo’n’t you\r\ncome with me?”\r\n\r\n“No, Sir!” said the Doctor, with a sudden effort—which proved an utter\r\nfailure—to resume his professional manner. “Do I _look_ like coming with\r\nyou? Have you never heard that two is company, and——”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “I _have_ heard it: and I’m painfully aware that_ I_ am\r\n_Number Three_! But, _when_ shall we three meet again?”\r\n\r\n“_When the hurly-burly’s done!_” he answered with a happy laugh, such as\r\nI had not heard from him for many a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                               MEIN HERR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I went on my lonely way, and, on reaching the Hall, I found Lady\r\nMuriel standing at the garden-gate waiting for me.\r\n\r\n“No need to _give_ you joy, or to _wish_ you joy?” I began.\r\n\r\n“None _whatever_!” she replied, with the joyous laugh of a child. “We\r\n_give_ people what they haven’t got: we _wish_ for something that is yet\r\nto come. For _me_, it’s all _here_! It’s all _mine_! Dear friend,” she\r\nsuddenly broke off, “do you think Heaven ever begins on _Earth_, for any\r\nof us?”\r\n\r\n“For _some_,” I said. “For some, perhaps, who are simple and childlike.\r\nYou know He said ‘of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.’”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel clasped her hands, and gazed up into the cloudless sky, with\r\na look I had often seen in Sylvie’s eyes. “I feel as if it had begun for\r\n_me_,” she almost whispered. “I feel as if _I_ were one of the happy\r\nchildren, whom He bid them bring near to Him, though the people would\r\nhave kept them back. Yes, He has seen me in the throng. He has read the\r\nwistful longing in my eyes. He has beckoned me to Him. They have _had_\r\nto make way for me. He has taken me up in His arms. He has put His hands\r\nupon me and blessed me!” She paused, breathless in her perfect\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said. “I think He has!”\r\n\r\n“You must come and speak to my father,” she went on, as we stood side by\r\nside at the gate, looking down the shady lane. But, even as she said the\r\nwords, the ‘eerie’ sensation came over me like a flood: I saw the dear\r\nold Professor approaching us, and also saw, what was stranger still,\r\nthat he was visible to _Lady Muriel_!\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? Had the fairy-life been merged in the real life? Or\r\nwas Lady Muriel ‘eerie’ also, and thus able to enter into the\r\nfairy-world along with me? The words were on my lips (“I see an old\r\nfriend of mine in the lane: if you don’t know him, may I introduce him\r\nto you?”) when the strangest thing of all happened: Lady Muriel spoke.\r\n\r\n“I see an old friend of mine in the lane,” she said: “if you don’t know\r\nhim, may I introduce him to you?”\r\n\r\nI seemed to wake out of a dream: for the ‘eerie’ feeling was still\r\nstrong upon me, and the figure outside seemed to be changing at every\r\nmoment, like one of the shapes in a kaleidoscope: now he was the\r\n_Professor_, and now he was somebody else! By the time he had reached\r\nthe gate, he certainly was somebody else: and I felt that the proper\r\ncourse was for _Lady Muriel_, not for _me_, to introduce him. She\r\ngreeted him kindly, and, opening the gate, admitted the venerable old\r\nman—a German, obviously—who looked about him with dazed eyes, as if\r\n_he_, too, had but just awaked from a dream!\r\n\r\nNo, it was certainly _not_ the Professor! My old friend _could_ not have\r\ngrown that magnificent beard since last we met: moreover, he would have\r\nrecognised _me_, for I was certain that _I_ had not changed much in the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he simply looked at me vaguely, and took off his hat in\r\nresponse to Lady Muriel’s words “Let me introduce Mein Herr to you”;\r\nwhile in the words, spoken in a strong German accent, “proud to make\r\nyour acquaintance, Sir!” I could detect no trace of an idea that we had\r\never met before.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel led us to the well-known shady nook, where preparations for\r\nafternoon tea had already been made, and, while she went in to look for\r\nthe Earl, we seated ourselves in two easy-chairs, and ‘Mein Herr’ took\r\nup Lady Muriel’s work, and examined it through his large spectacles (one\r\nof the adjuncts that made him so provokingly like the Professor).\r\n“Hemming pocket-handkerchiefs?” he said, musingly. “So _that_ is what\r\nthe English miladies occupy themselves with, is it?”\r\n\r\n“It is the one accomplishment,” I said, “in which Man has never yet\r\nrivaled Woman!”\r\n\r\nHere Lady Muriel returned with her father; and, after he had exchanged\r\nsome friendly words with ‘Mein Herr,’ and we had all been supplied with\r\nthe needful ‘creature-comforts,’ the newcomer returned to the suggestive\r\nsubject of Pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n“You have heard of Fortunatus’s Purse, Miladi? Ah, so! Would you be\r\nsurprised to hear that, with three of these leetle handkerchiefs, you\r\nshall make the Purse of Fortunatus, quite soon, quite easily?”\r\n\r\n“Shall I indeed?” Lady Muriel eagerly replied, as she took a heap of\r\nthem into her lap, and threaded her needle. “_Please_ tell me how, Mein\r\nHerr! I’ll make one before I touch another drop of tea!”\r\n\r\n“You shall first,” said Mein Herr, possessing himself of two of the\r\nhandkerchiefs, spreading one upon the other, and holding them up by two\r\ncorners, “you shall first join together these upper corners, the right\r\nto the right, the left to the left; and the opening between them shall\r\nbe the _mouth_ of the Purse.”\r\n\r\nA very few stitches sufficed to carry out _this_ direction. “Now, if I\r\nsew the other three edges together,” she suggested, “the bag is\r\ncomplete?”\r\n\r\n“Not so, Miladi: the _lower_ edges shall _first_ be joined—ah, not so!”\r\n(as she was beginning to sew them together). “Turn one of them over, and\r\njoin the _right_ lower corner of the one to the _left_ lower corner of\r\nthe other, and sew the lower edges together in what you would call _the\r\nwrong way_.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ see!” said Lady Muriel, as she deftly executed the order. “And a\r\nvery twisted, uncomfortable, uncanny-looking bag it makes! But the\r\n_moral_ is a lovely one. Unlimited wealth can only be attained by doing\r\nthings _in the wrong way_! And how are we to join up these\r\nmysterious—no, I mean _this_ mysterious opening?” (twisting the thing\r\nround and round with a puzzled air.) “Yes, it _is_ one opening. I\r\nthought it was _two_, at first.”\r\n\r\n“You have seen the puzzle of the Paper Ring?” Mein Herr said, addressing\r\nthe Earl. “Where you take a slip of paper, and join its ends together,\r\nfirst twisting one, so as to join the _upper_ corner of _one_ end to the\r\n_lower_ corner of the _other_?”\r\n\r\n“I saw one made, only yesterday,” the Earl replied. “Muriel, my child,\r\nwere you not making one, to amuse those children you had to tea?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know that Puzzle,” said Lady Muriel. “The Ring has only _one_\r\nsurface, and only _one_ edge. It’s very mysterious!”\r\n\r\n“The _bag_ is just like that, isn’t it?” I suggested. “Is not the\r\n_outer_ surface of one side of it continuous with the _inner_ surface of\r\nthe other side?”\r\n\r\n“So it is!” she exclaimed. “Only it _isn’t_ a bag, just yet. How shall\r\nwe fill up this opening, Mein Herr?”\r\n\r\n“Thus!” said the old man impressively, taking the bag from her, and\r\nrising to his feet in the excitement of the explanation. “The edge of\r\nthe opening consists of _four_ handkerchief-edges, and you can trace it\r\ncontinuously, round and round the opening: down the right edge of _one_\r\nhandkerchief, up the left edge of the _other_, and then down the left\r\nedge of the _one_, and up the right edge of the _other_!”\r\n\r\n“So you can!” Lady Muriel murmured thoughtfully, leaning her head on her\r\nhand, and earnestly watching the old man. “And that _proves_ it to be\r\nonly _one_ opening!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORTUNATUS’ PURSE]\r\n\r\nShe looked so strangely like a child, puzzling over a difficult lesson,\r\nand Mein Herr had become, for the moment, so strangely like the old\r\nProfessor, that I felt utterly bewildered: the ‘eerie’ feeling was on me\r\nin its full force, and I felt almost _impelled_ to say “Do you\r\nunderstand it, Sylvie?” However I checked myself by a great effort, and\r\nlet the dream (if indeed it _was_ a dream) go on to its end.\r\n\r\n“Now, this _third_ handkerchief,” Mein Herr proceeded, “has _also_ four\r\nedges, which you can trace continuously round and round: all you need do\r\nis to join its four edges to the four edges of the opening. The Purse is\r\nthen complete, and its outer surface——”\r\n\r\n“_I_ see!” Lady Muriel eagerly interrupted. “Its _outer_ surface will be\r\ncontinuous with its _inner_ surface! But it will take time. I’ll sew it\r\nup after tea.” She laid aside the bag and resumed her cup of tea. “But\r\nwhy do you call it Fortunatus’s Purse, Mein Herr?”\r\n\r\nThe dear old man beamed upon her, with a jolly smile, looking more\r\nexactly like the Professor than ever. “Don’t you see, my child—I should\r\nsay Miladi? Whatever is _inside_ that Purse, is _outside_ it; and\r\nwhatever is _outside_ it, is _inside_ it. So you have all the wealth of\r\nthe world in that leetle Purse!”\r\n\r\nHis pupil clapped her hands, in unrestrained delight. “I’ll certainly\r\nsew the third handkerchief in—_some_ time,” she said: “but I wo’n’t take\r\nup your time by trying it now. Tell us some more wonderful things,\r\nplease!” And her face and her voice so _exactly_ recalled Sylvie, that I\r\ncould not help glancing round, half-expecting to see _Bruno_ also!\r\n\r\nMein Herr began thoughtfully balancing his spoon on the edge of his\r\nteacup, while he pondered over this request. “Something wonderful—like\r\n Fortunatus’s Purse? _That_ will give you—when it is made—wealth beyond\r\nyour wildest dreams: but it will not give you _Time_!”\r\n\r\nA pause of silence ensued—utilised by Lady Muriel for the very practical\r\npurpose of refilling the teacups.\r\n\r\n“In _your_ country,” Mein Herr began with a startling abruptness, “what\r\nbecomes of all the wasted Time?”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel looked grave. “Who can tell?” she half-whispered to herself.\r\n“All one knows is that it is gone—past recall!”\r\n\r\n“Well, in _my_—I mean in a country _I_ have visited,” said the old man,\r\n“they store it up: and it comes in _very_ useful, years afterwards! For\r\nexample, suppose you have a long tedious evening before you: nobody to\r\ntalk to: nothing you care to do: and yet hours too soon to go to bed.\r\nHow do _you_ behave then?”\r\n\r\n“I get _very_ cross,” she frankly admitted: “and I want to throw things\r\nabout the room!”\r\n\r\n“When that happens to—to the people I have visited, they never act _so_.\r\nBy a short and simple process—which I cannot explain to you—they store\r\nup the useless hours: and, on some _other_ occasion, when they happen to\r\n_need_ extra time, they get them out again!”\r\n\r\nThe Earl was listening with a slightly incredulous smile. “Why cannot\r\nyou _explain_ the process?” he enquired.\r\n\r\nMein Herr was ready with a quite unanswerable reason. “Because you have\r\nno _words_, in _your_ language, to convey the ideas which are needed. I\r\ncould explain it in—in—but you would not understand it!”\r\n\r\n“No indeed!” said Lady Muriel, graciously dispensing with the _name_ of\r\nthe unknown language. “I never learnt it—at least, not to speak it\r\n_fluently_, you know. _Please_ tell us some more wonderful things!”\r\n\r\n“They run their railway-trains without any engines—nothing is needed but\r\nmachinery to _stop_ them with. Is _that_ wonderful enough, Miladi?”\r\n\r\n“But where does the _force_ come from?” I ventured to ask.\r\n\r\nMein Herr turned quickly round, to look at the new speaker. Then he took\r\noff his spectacles, and polished them, and looked at me again, in\r\nevident bewilderment. I could see he was thinking—as indeed _I_ was\r\nalso—that we _must_ have met before.\r\n\r\n“They use the force of _gravity_,” he said. “It is a force known also in\r\n_your_ country, I believe?”\r\n\r\n“But that would need a railway going _down-hill_,” the Earl remarked.\r\n“You ca’n’t have _all_ your railways going down-hill?”\r\n\r\n“They _all_ do,” said Mein Herr.\r\n\r\n“Not from _both_ ends?”\r\n\r\n“From _both_ ends.”\r\n\r\n“Then I give it up!” said the Earl.\r\n\r\n“Can you explain the process?” said Lady Muriel. “Without using that\r\nlanguage, that I ca’n’t speak fluently?”\r\n\r\n“Easily,” said Mein Herr. “Each railway is in a long tunnel, perfectly\r\nstraight: so of course the _middle_ of it is nearer the centre of the\r\nglobe than the two ends: so every train runs half-way _down_-hill, and\r\nthat gives it force enough to run the _other_ half _up_-hill.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. I understand that perfectly,” said Lady Muriel. “But the\r\nvelocity, in the _middle_ of the tunnel, must be something _fearful_!”\r\n\r\n‘Mein Herr’ was evidently much gratified at the intelligent interest\r\nLady Muriel took in his remarks. At every moment the old man seemed to\r\ngrow more chatty and more fluent. “You would like to know our methods of\r\n_driving_?” he smilingly enquired. “To us, a run-away horse is of no\r\nimport at all!”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel slightly shuddered. “To _us_ it is a very real danger,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“That is because your carriage is wholly _behind_ your horse. Your horse\r\nruns. Your carriage follows. Perhaps your horse has the bit in his\r\nteeth. Who shall stop him? You fly, ever faster and faster! Finally\r\ncomes the inevitable upset!”\r\n\r\n“But suppose _your_ horse manages to get the bit in his teeth?”\r\n\r\n“No matter! We would not concern ourselves. Our horse is harnessed in\r\nthe very centre of our carriage. Two wheels are in front of him, and two\r\nbehind. To the roof is attached one end of a broad belt. This goes under\r\nthe horse’s body, and the other end is attached to a leetle—what you\r\ncall a ‘windlass,’ I think. The horse takes the bit in his teeth. He\r\nruns away. We are flying at ten miles an hour! We turn our little\r\nwindlass, five turns, six turns, seven turns, and—poof! Our horse is off\r\nthe ground! _Now_ let him gallop in the air, as much as he pleases: our\r\n_carriage_ stands still. We sit round him, and watch him till he is\r\ntired. Then we let him down. Our horse is glad, very much glad, when his\r\nfeet once more touch the ground!”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” said the Earl, who had been listening attentively. “Are there\r\nany other peculiarities in your carriages?”\r\n\r\n“In the _wheels_, sometimes, my Lord. For your health, _you_ go to sea:\r\nto be pitched, to be rolled, occasionally to be drowned. _We_ do all\r\nthat on land: we are pitched, as you; we are rolled, as you; but\r\n_drowned_, no! There is no water!”\r\n\r\n“What are the wheels like, then?”\r\n\r\n“They are _oval_, my Lord. Therefore the carriages rise and fall.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and pitch the carriage backwards and forwards: but how do they\r\nmake it _roll_?”\r\n\r\n“They do not match, my Lord. The _end_ of one wheel answers to the\r\n_side_ of the opposite wheel. So first one side of the carriage rises,\r\nthen the other. And it pitches all the while. Ah, you must be a good\r\nsailor, to drive in our boat-carriages!”\r\n\r\n“I can easily believe it,” said the Earl.\r\n\r\nMein Herr rose to his feet. “I must leave you now, Miladi,” he said,\r\nconsulting his watch. “I have another engagement.”\r\n\r\n“I only wish we had stored up some extra time!” Lady Muriel said, as she\r\nshook hands with him. “Then we could have kept you a little longer!”\r\n\r\n“In _that_ case I would gladly stay,” replied Mein Herr. “As it is—I\r\nfear I must say good-bye!”\r\n\r\n“Where did you first meet him?” I asked Lady Muriel, when Mein Herr had\r\nleft us. “And where does he live? And what is his real name?”\r\n\r\n“We first—met—him——” she musingly replied, “really, I ca’n’t remember\r\n_where_! And I’ve no idea where he lives! And I never heard any other\r\nname! It’s very curious. It never occurred to me before to consider what\r\na mystery he is!”\r\n\r\n“I hope we shall meet again,” I said: “he interests me very much.”\r\n\r\n“He will be at our farewell-party, this day fortnight,” said the Earl.\r\n“Of course you will come? Muriel is anxious to gather all our friends\r\naround us once more, before we leave the place.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he explained to me—as Lady Muriel had left us together—that he\r\nwas so anxious to get his daughter away from a place full of so many\r\npainful memories connected with the now-canceled engagement with Major\r\nLindon, that they had arranged to have the wedding in a months time,\r\nafter which Arthur and his wife were to go on a foreign tour.\r\n\r\n“Don’t forget Tuesday week!” he said as we shook hands at parting. “I\r\nonly wish you could bring with you those charming children, that you\r\nintroduced to us in the summer. Talk of the mystery of Mein Herr! That’s\r\n_nothing_ to the mystery that seems to attend _them_! I shall never\r\nforget those marvellous flowers!”\r\n\r\n“I will bring them if I possibly can,” I said. But how to _fulfil_ such\r\na promise, I mused to myself on my way back to our lodgings, was a\r\nproblem entirely beyond my skill!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                           IN A SHADY PLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ten days glided swiftly away: and, the day before the great party\r\nwas to take place, Arthur proposed that we should stroll down to the\r\nHall, in time for afternoon-tea.\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t you better go _alone_?” I suggested. “Surely _I_ shall be very\r\nmuch _de trop_?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’ll be a kind of _experiment_,” he said. “_Fiat experimentum in\r\ncorpore vili!_” he added, with a graceful bow of mock politeness towards\r\nthe unfortunate victim. “You see I shall have to bear the sight,\r\nto-morrow night, of my lady-love making herself agreable to everybody\r\n_except_ the right person, and I shall bear the agony all the better if\r\nwe have a dress-rehearsal beforehand!”\r\n\r\n“_My_ part in the play being, apparently, that of the sample _wrong_\r\nperson?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no,” Arthur said musingly, as we set forth: “there’s no such part\r\nin a regular company. ‘Heavy Father’? _That_ won’t do: that’s filled\r\nalready. ‘Singing Chambermaid’? Well, the ‘First Lady’ doubles _that_\r\npart. ‘Comic Old Man’? You’re not comic enough. After all, I’m afraid\r\nthere’s no part for you but the ‘Well-dressed Villain’: only,” with a\r\ncritical side-glance, “I’m a _leetle_ uncertain about the dress!”\r\n\r\nWe found Lady Muriel alone, the Earl having gone out to make a call, and\r\nat once resumed old terms of intimacy, in the shady arbour where the\r\ntea-things seemed to be always waiting. The only novelty in the\r\narrangements (one which Lady Muriel seemed to regard as _entirely_ a\r\nmatter of course), was that two of the chairs were placed _quite_ close\r\ntogether, side by side. Strange to say, _I_ was not invited to occupy\r\n_either_ of them!\r\n\r\n“We have been arranging, as we came along, about letter-writing,” Arthur\r\nbegan. “He will want to know how we’re enjoying our Swiss tour: and of\r\ncourse we must pretend we _are_?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she meekly assented.\r\n\r\n“And the skeleton-in-the-cupboard——” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“—is always a difficulty,” she quickly put in, “when you’re traveling\r\nabout, and when there are no cupboards in the hotels. However, _ours_ is\r\na _very_ portable one; and will be neatly packed, in a nice leather\r\ncase——”\r\n\r\n“But please don’t think about _writing_,” I said, “when you’ve anything\r\nmore attractive on hand. I delight in _reading_ letters, but I know well\r\nhow tiring it is to _write_ them.”\r\n\r\n“It _is_, sometimes,” Arthur assented. “For instance, when you’re very\r\nshy of the person you have to write to.”\r\n\r\n“Does that show itself in the _letter_?” Lady Muriel enquired. “Of\r\ncourse, when I hear any one _talking_—_you_, for instance—I can see how\r\n_desperately_ shy he is! But can you see that in a _letter_?”\r\n\r\n“Well, of course, when you hear any one talk _fluently_—_you_, for\r\ninstance—you can see how desperately _un_-shy she is—not to say saucy!\r\nBut the shyest and most intermittent talker must _seem_ fluent in\r\nletter-writing. He may have taken half-an-hour to _compose_ his second\r\nsentence; but there it is, close after the first!”\r\n\r\n“Then letters don’t express all that they _might_ express?”\r\n\r\n“That’s merely because our system of letter-writing is incomplete. A shy\r\nwriter _ought_ to be able to show that he is so. Why shouldn’t he make\r\n_pauses_ in writing, just as he would do in speaking? He might leave\r\nblank spaces—say half a page at a time. And a _very_ shy girl—if there\r\n_is_ such a thing—might write a sentence on the _first_ sheet of her\r\nletter—then put in a couple of _blank_ sheets—then a sentence on the\r\n_fourth_ sheet: and so on.”\r\n\r\n“I quite foresee that _we_—I mean this clever little boy and myself—”\r\nLady Muriel said to me, evidently with the kind wish to bring me into\r\nthe conversation, “—are going to become famous—of course all our\r\ninventions are common property now—for a new Code of Rules for\r\nLetter-writing! Please invent some more, little boy!”\r\n\r\n“Well, another thing _greatly_ needed, little girl, is some way of\r\nexpressing that we _don’t_ mean anything.”\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself, little boy! Surely _you_ can find no difficulty in\r\nexpressing a _total_ absence of meaning?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that you should be able, when you _don’t_ mean a thing to be\r\ntaken seriously, to express that wish. For human nature is so\r\nconstituted that whatever you write seriously is taken as a joke, and\r\nwhatever you mean as a joke is taken seriously! At any rate, it is so in\r\nwriting to a _lady_!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you’re not used to writing to ladies!” Lady Muriel remarked,\r\nleaning back in her chair, and gazing thoughtfully into the sky. “You\r\nshould try.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said Arthur. “How many ladies may I begin writing to? As\r\nmany as I can count on the fingers of both hands?”\r\n\r\n“As many as you can count on the _thumbs_ of _one_ hand!” his lady-love\r\nreplied with much severity. “What a _very_ naughty little boy he is!\r\n_Isn’t_ he?” (with an appealing glance at me).\r\n\r\n“He’s a little fractious,” I said. “Perhaps he’s cutting a tooth.” While\r\nto myself I said “How _exactly_ like Sylvie talking to Bruno!”\r\n\r\n“He wants his tea.” (The naughty little boy volunteered the\r\ninformation.) “He’s getting very tired, at the mere _prospect_ of the\r\ngreat party to-morrow!”\r\n\r\n“Then he shall have a good rest beforehand!” she soothingly replied.\r\n“The tea isn’t made yet. Come, little boy, lean well back in your chair,\r\nand think about nothing—or about _me_, whichever you prefer!”\r\n\r\n“All the same, all the same!” Arthur sleepily murmured, watching her\r\nwith loving eyes, as she moved her chair away to the tea table, and\r\nbegan to make the tea. “Then he’ll wait for his tea, like a good,\r\npatient little boy!”\r\n\r\n“Shall I bring you the London Papers?” said Lady Muriel. “I saw them\r\nlying on the table as I came out, but my father said there was nothing\r\nin them, except that horrid murder-trial.” (Society was just then\r\nenjoying its daily thrill of excitement in studying the details of a\r\nspecially sensational murder in a thieves’ den in the East of London.)\r\n\r\n“I have no appetite for horrors,” Arthur replied. “But I hope we have\r\nlearned the lesson they should teach us—though we are very apt to read\r\nit backwards!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘I AM SITTING AT YOUR FEET’]\r\n\r\n“You speak in riddles,” said Lady Muriel. “Please explain yourself. See\r\nnow,” suiting the action to the word, “I am sitting at your feet, just\r\nas if you were a second Gamaliel! Thanks, no.” (This was to me, who had\r\nrisen to bring her chair back to its former place.) “Pray don’t disturb\r\nyourself. This tree and the grass make a very nice easy-chair. _What_ is\r\nthe lesson that one always reads wrong?”\r\n\r\nArthur was silent for a minute. “I would like to be clear what it _is_ I\r\nmean,” he said, slowly and thoughtfully, “before I say anything to\r\n_you_—because you _think_ about it.”\r\n\r\nAnything approaching to a compliment was so unusual an utterance for\r\nArthur, that it brought a flush of pleasure to her cheek, as she replied\r\n“It is _you_, that give me the ideas to think about.”\r\n\r\n“One’s first thought,” Arthur proceeded, “in reading of anything\r\nspecially vile or barbarous, as done by a fellow-creature, is apt to be\r\nthat we see a new depth of Sin revealed _beneath_ us: and we seem to\r\ngaze down into that abyss from some higher ground, far apart from it.”\r\n\r\n“I think I understand you now. You mean that one ought to think—not\r\n‘God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are’—but ‘God, be merciful\r\nto me also, who might be, but for Thy grace, a sinner as vile as he!’”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Arthur. “I meant a great deal more than that.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up quickly, but checked herself, and waited in silence.\r\n\r\n“One must begin further back, I think. Think of some other man, the same\r\nage as this poor wretch. Look back to the time when they both began\r\nlife—before they had sense enough to know Right from Wrong. _Then_, at\r\nany rate, they were equal in God’s sight?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded assent.\r\n\r\n“We have, then, two distinct epochs at which we may contemplate the two\r\nmen whose lives we are comparing. At the first epoch they are, so far as\r\nmoral responsibility is concerned, on precisely the same footing: they\r\nare alike incapable of doing right or wrong. At the second epoch the one\r\nman—I am taking an extreme case, for contrast—has won the esteem and\r\nlove of all around him: his character is stainless, and his name will be\r\nheld in honour hereafter: the other man’s history is one unvaried record\r\nof crime, and his life is at last forfeited to the outraged laws of his\r\ncountry. Now what have been the causes, in each case, of each man’s\r\ncondition being what it is at the second epoch? They are of two\r\nkinds—one acting from within, the other from without. These two kinds\r\nneed to be discussed separately—that is, if I have not already tired you\r\nwith my prosing?”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said Lady Muriel, “it is a special delight to me to\r\nhave a question discussed in this way—analysed and arranged, so that one\r\ncan understand it. Some books, that profess to argue out a question, are\r\nto me intolerably wearisome, simply because the ideas are all arranged\r\nhap-hazard—a sort of ‘first come, first served.’”\r\n\r\n“You are very encouraging,” Arthur replied, with a pleased look. “The\r\ncauses, acting from _within_, which make a man’s character what it is at\r\nany given moment, are his successive acts of volition—that is, his acts\r\nof choosing whether he will do this or that.”\r\n\r\n“We are to assume the existence of Free-Will?” I said, in order to have\r\nthat point made quite clear.\r\n\r\n“If not,” was the quiet reply, “_cadit quaestio_: and I have no more to\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“We _will_ assume it!” the rest of the audience—the majority, I may say,\r\nlooking at it from Arthur’s point of view—imperiously proclaimed. The\r\norator proceeded.\r\n\r\n“The causes, acting from _without_, are his surroundings—what Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer calls his ‘environment.’ Now the point I want to make\r\nclear is this, that a man is responsible for his acts of choosing, but\r\n_not_ responsible for his environment. Hence, if these two men make, on\r\nsome given occasion, when they are exposed to equal temptation, equal\r\nefforts to resist and to choose the right, their condition, in the sight\r\nof God, must be the same. If He is pleased in the one case, so will He\r\nbe in the other; if displeased in the one case, so also in the other.”\r\n\r\n“That is so, no doubt: I see it quite clearly,” Lady Muriel put in.\r\n\r\n“And yet, owing to their different environments, the one may win a great\r\nvictory over the temptation, while the other falls into some black abyss\r\nof crime.”\r\n\r\n“But surely you would not say those men were equally guilty in the sight\r\nof God?”\r\n\r\n“Either that,” said Arthur, “or else I must give up my belief in God’s\r\nperfect justice. But let me put one more case, which will show my\r\nmeaning even more forcibly. Let the one man be in a high social\r\nposition—the other, say, a common thief. Let the one be tempted to some\r\ntrivial act of unfair dealing—something which he can do with the\r\nabsolute certainty that it will never be discovered—something which he\r\ncan with perfect ease forbear from doing—and which he distinctly knows\r\nto be a sin. Let the other be tempted to some terrible crime—as men\r\nwould consider it—but under an almost overwhelming pressure of\r\nmotives—of course not _quite_ overwhelming, as that would destroy all\r\nresponsibility. Now, in this case, let the second man make a _greater_\r\neffort at resistance than the first. Also suppose _both_ to fall under\r\nthe temptation—I say that the second man is, in God’s sight, _less_\r\nguilty than the other.”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel drew a long breath. “It upsets all one’s ideas of Right and\r\nWrong—just at first! Why, in that dreadful murder-trial, you would say,\r\nI suppose, that it was possible that the least guilty man in the Court\r\nwas the murderer, and that possibly the judge who tried him, by yielding\r\nto the temptation of making one unfair remark, had committed a crime\r\noutweighing the criminal’s whole career!”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I should,” Arthur firmly replied. “It sounds like a paradox,\r\nI admit. But just think what a grievous sin it must be, in God’s sight,\r\nto yield to some very slight temptation, which we could have resisted\r\nwith perfect ease, and to do it deliberately, and in the full light of\r\nGod’s Law. What penance can atone for a sin like _that_?”\r\n\r\n“I ca’n’t reject your theory,” I said. “But how it seems to widen the\r\npossible area of Sin in the world!”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?” Lady Muriel anxiously enquired.\r\n\r\n“Oh, not so, not so!” was the eager reply. “To me it seems to clear away\r\nmuch of the cloud that hangs over the world’s history. When this view\r\nfirst made itself clear to me, I remember walking out into the fields,\r\nrepeating to myself that line of Tennyson ‘_There seemed no room for\r\nsense of wrong!_’ The thought, that perhaps the real guilt of the human\r\nrace was infinitely less than I fancied it—that the millions, whom I had\r\nthought of as sunk in hopeless depths of sin, were perhaps, in God’s\r\nsight, scarcely sinning at all—was more sweet than words can tell! Life\r\nseemed more bright and beautiful, when once that thought had come! ‘_A\r\nlivelier emerald twinkles in the grass, A purer sapphire melts into the\r\nsea!_’” His voice trembled as he concluded, and the tears stood in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel shaded her face with her hand, and was silent for a minute.\r\n“It is a beautiful thought,” she said, looking up at last. “Thank\r\nyou—Arthur, for putting it into my head!”\r\n\r\nThe Earl returned in time to join us at tea, and to give us the very\r\nunwelcome tidings that a fever had broken out in the little harbour-town\r\nthat lay below us—a fever of so malignant a type that, though it had\r\nonly appeared a day or two ago, there were already more than a dozen\r\ndown in it, two or three of whom were reported to be in imminent danger.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the eager questions of Arthur—who of course took a deep\r\nscientific interest in the matter—he could give very few _technical_\r\ndetails, though he had met the local doctor. It appeared, however, that\r\nit was an almost _new_ disease—at least in _this_ century, though it\r\n_might_ prove to be identical with the ‘Plague’ recorded in\r\nHistory—_very_ infectious, and frightfully rapid in its action. “It will\r\nnot, however, prevent our party to-morrow,” he said in conclusion. “None\r\nof the guests belong to the infected district, which is, as you know,\r\nexclusively peopled by fishermen: so you may come without any fear.”\r\n\r\nArthur was very silent, all the way back, and, on reaching our lodgings,\r\nimmediately plunged into medical studies, connected with the alarming\r\nmalady of whose arrival we had just heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                          THE FAREWELL-PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Arthur and I reached the Hall in good time, as\r\nonly a few of the guests—it was to be a party of eighteen—had as yet\r\narrived; and these were talking with the Earl, leaving us the\r\nopportunity of a few words apart with our hostess.\r\n\r\n“Who is that _very_ learned-looking man with the large spectacles?”\r\nArthur enquired. “I haven’t met him here before, have I?”\r\n\r\n“No, he’s a new friend of ours,” said Lady Muriel: “a German, I believe.\r\nHe _is_ such a dear old thing! And quite the most learned man I ever\r\nmet—with _one_ exception, of course!” she added humbly, as Arthur drew\r\nhimself up with an air of offended dignity.\r\n\r\n“And the young lady in blue, just beyond him, talking to that\r\nforeign-looking man. Is _she_ learned, too?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” said Lady Muriel. “But I’m told she’s a wonderful\r\npiano-forte-player. I hope you’ll hear her to-night. I asked that\r\nforeigner to take her in, because _he’s_ very musical, too. He’s a\r\nFrench Count, I believe; and he sings _splendidly_!”\r\n\r\n“Science—music—singing—you have indeed got a complete party!” said\r\nArthur. “I feel quite a privileged person, meeting all these stars. I\r\n_do_ love music!”\r\n\r\n“But the party isn’t _quite_ complete!” said Lady Muriel. “You haven’t\r\nbrought us those two beautiful children,” she went on, turning to me.\r\n“He brought them here to tea, you know, one day last summer,” again\r\naddressing Arthur; “and they _are_ such darlings!”\r\n\r\n“They are, _indeed_,” I assented.\r\n\r\n“But why haven’t you brought them with you? You promised my father you\r\n_would_.”\r\n\r\n“I’m very sorry,” I said; “but really it was impossible to bring them\r\nwith me.” Here I most certainly _meant_ to conclude the sentence: and it\r\nwas with a feeling of utter amazement, which I cannot adequately\r\ndescribe, that I heard myself _going on speaking_. “—but they are to\r\njoin me here in the course of the evening” were the words, uttered in\r\n_my_ voice, and seeming to come from _my_ lips.\r\n\r\n“I’m _so_ glad!” Lady Muriel joyfully replied. “I _shall_ enjoy\r\nintroducing them to some of my friends here! When do you expect them?”\r\n\r\nI took refuge in silence. The only _honest_ reply would have been “That\r\nwas not _my_ remark. _I_ didn’t say it, and _it isn’t true_!” But I had\r\nnot the moral courage to make such a confession. The character of a\r\n‘lunatic’ is not, I believe, very difficult to _acquire_: but it is\r\namazingly difficult to _get rid of_: and it seemed quite certain that\r\nany such speech as _that_ would _quite_ justify the issue of a writ ‘_de\r\nlunatico inquirendo_.’\r\n\r\nLady Muriel evidently thought I had failed to hear her question, and\r\nturned to Arthur with a remark on some other subject; and I had time to\r\nrecover from my shock of surprise—or to awake out of my momentary\r\n‘eerie’ condition, whichever it was.\r\n\r\nWhen things around me seemed once more to be real, Arthur was saying\r\n“I’m afraid there’s no help for it: they _must_ be finite in number.”\r\n\r\n“I should be sorry to have to believe it,” said Lady Muriel. “Yet, when\r\none comes to think of it, there _are_ no new melodies, now-a-days. What\r\npeople talk of as ‘the last new song’ always recalls to _me_ some tune\r\nI’ve known as a child!”\r\n\r\n“The day must come—if the world lasts long enough——” said Arthur, “when\r\nevery possible tune will have been composed—every possible pun\r\nperpetrated——” (Lady Muriel wrung her hands, like a tragedy-queen) “and,\r\nworse than that, every possible _book_ written! For the number of\r\n_words_ is finite.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll make very little difference to the _authors_,” I suggested.\r\n“Instead of saying ‘_what_ book shall I write?’ an author will ask\r\nhimself ‘_which_ book shall I write?’ A mere verbal distinction!”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel gave me an approving smile. “But _lunatics_ would always\r\nwrite new books, surely?” she went on. “They _couldn’t_ write the sane\r\nbooks over again!”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Arthur. “But _their_ books would come to an end, also. The\r\nnumber of lunatic _books_ is as finite as the number of lunatics.”\r\n\r\n“And _that_ number is becoming greater every year,” said a pompous man,\r\nwhom I recognised as the self-appointed showman on the day of the\r\npicnic.\r\n\r\n“So they say,” replied Arthur. “And, when ninety per cent. of us are\r\nlunatics,” (he seemed to be in a wildly nonsensical mood) “the asylums\r\nwill be put to their proper use.”\r\n\r\n“And that is——?” the pompous man gravely enquired.\r\n\r\n“_To shelter the sane!_” said Arthur. “_We_ shall bar ourselves in. The\r\nlunatics will have it all their own way, _outside_. They’ll do it a\r\nlittle queerly, no doubt. Railway-collisions will be always happening:\r\nsteamers always blowing up: most of the towns will be burnt down: most\r\nof the ships sunk——”\r\n\r\n“And most of the men _killed_!” murmured the pompous man, who was\r\nevidently hopelessly bewildered.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” Arthur assented. “Till at last there will be _fewer_\r\nlunatics than sane men. Then _we_ come out: _they_ go in: and things\r\nreturn to their normal condition!”\r\n\r\nThe pompous man frowned darkly, and bit his lip, and folded his arms,\r\nvainly trying to think it out. “He is _jesting_!” he muttered to himself\r\nat last, in a tone of withering contempt, as he stalked away.\r\n\r\nBy this time the other guests had arrived; and dinner was announced.\r\nArthur of course took down Lady Muriel: and _I_ was pleased to find\r\nmyself seated at her other side, with a severe-looking old lady (whom I\r\nhad not met before, and whose name I had, as is usual in introductions,\r\nentirely failed to catch, merely gathering that it sounded like a\r\ncompound-name) as my partner for the banquet.\r\n\r\nShe appeared, however, to be acquainted with Arthur, and confided to me\r\nin a low voice her opinion that he was “a very argumentative young man.”\r\nArthur, for his part, seemed well inclined to show himself worthy of the\r\ncharacter she had given him, and, hearing her say “I never take wine\r\nwith my soup!” (this was _not_ a confidence to me, but was launched upon\r\nSociety, as a matter of general interest), he at once challenged a\r\ncombat by asking her “_when_ would you say that property _commence_ in a\r\nplate of soup?”\r\n\r\n“This is _my_ soup,” she sternly replied: “and what is before you is\r\n_yours_.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” said Arthur: “but _when_ did I begin to own it? Up to the\r\nmoment of its being put into the plate, it was the property of our host:\r\nwhile being offered round the table, it was, let us say, held in trust\r\nby the waiter: did it become mine when I accepted it? Or when it was\r\nplaced before me? Or when I took the first spoonful?”\r\n\r\n“He is a _very_ argumentative young man!” was all the old lady would\r\nsay: but she said it audibly, this time, feeling that Society had a\r\nright to know it.\r\n\r\nArthur smiled mischievously. “I shouldn’t mind betting you a shilling,”\r\nhe said, “that the Eminent Barrister next you” (It certainly _is_\r\npossible to say words so as to make them begin with capitals!) “ca’n’t\r\nanswer me!”\r\n\r\n“I _never_ bet,” she sternly replied.\r\n\r\n“Not even sixpenny points at _whist_?”\r\n\r\n“_Never!_” she repeated. “_Whist_ is innocent enough: but whist played\r\nfor _money_!” She shuddered.\r\n\r\nArthur became serious again. “I’m afraid I ca’n’t take that view,” he\r\nsaid. “I consider that the introduction of small stakes for card-playing\r\nwas one of the most _moral_ acts Society ever did, _as_ Society.”\r\n\r\n“How was it so?” said Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\n“Because it took Cards, once for all, out of the category of games at\r\nwhich _cheating_ is possible. Look at the way Croquet is demoralising\r\nSociety. Ladies are beginning to cheat at it, terribly: and, if they’re\r\nfound out, they only laugh, and call it fun. But when there’s _money_ at\r\nstake, that is out of the question. The swindler is _not_ accepted as a\r\nwit. When a man sits down to cards, and cheats his friends out of their\r\nmoney, he doesn’t get much _fun_ out of it—unless he thinks it fun to be\r\nkicked down stairs!”\r\n\r\n“If all gentlemen thought as badly of ladies as _you_ do,” my neighbour\r\nremarked with some bitterness, “there would be very few—very few——.” She\r\nseemed doubtful how to end her sentence, but at last took “honeymoons”\r\nas a safe word.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said Arthur, the mischievous smile returning to his\r\nface, “if only people would adopt _my_ theory, the number of\r\nhoneymoons—quite of a new kind—would be greatly increased!”\r\n\r\n“May we hear about this new kind of honeymoon?” said Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\n“Let _X_ be the gentleman,” Arthur began, in a slightly raised voice, as\r\nhe now found himself with an audience of _six_, including ‘Mein Herr,’\r\nwho was seated at the other side of my polynomial partner. “Let _X_ be\r\nthe gentleman, and _Y_ the lady to whom he thinks of proposing. He\r\napplies for an Experimental Honeymoon. It is granted. Forthwith the\r\nyoung couple—accompanied by the great-aunt of _Y_, to act as\r\nchaperone—start for a month’s tour, during which they have many a\r\nmoonlight-walk, and many a _tête-à-tête_ conversation, and each can form\r\na more correct estimate of the other’s character, in four _weeks_, than\r\nwould have been possible in as many _years_, when meeting under the\r\nordinary restrictions of Society. And it is only after their _return_\r\nthat _X_ finally decides whether he will, or will not, put the momentous\r\nquestion to _Y_!”\r\n\r\n“In nine cases out of ten,” the pompous man proclaimed, “he would decide\r\nto break it off!”\r\n\r\n“Then, in nine cases out of ten,” Arthur rejoined, “an unsuitable match\r\nwould be prevented, and _both_ parties saved from misery!”\r\n\r\n“The only really _unsuitable_ matches,” the old lady remarked, “are\r\nthose made without sufficient _Money_. Love may come _afterwards_. Money\r\nis needed _to begin with_!”\r\n\r\nThis remark was cast loose upon Society, as a sort of general challenge;\r\nand, as such, it was at once accepted by several of those within\r\nhearing: _Money_ became the key-note of the conversation for some time;\r\nand a fitful echo of it was again heard, when the dessert had been\r\nplaced upon the table, the servants had left the room, and the Earl had\r\nstarted the wine in its welcome progress round the table.\r\n\r\n“I’m very glad to see you keep up the old customs,” I said to Lady\r\nMuriel as I filled her glass. “It’s really delightful to experience,\r\nonce more, the peaceful feeling that comes over one when the waiters\r\nhave left the room—when one can converse without the feeling of being\r\noverheard, and without having dishes constantly thrust over one’s\r\nshoulder. How much more sociable it is to be able to pour out the wine\r\nfor the ladies, and to hand the dishes to those who wish for them!”\r\n\r\n“In that case, kindly send those peaches down here,” said a fat\r\nred-faced man, who was seated beyond our pompous friend. “I’ve been\r\nwishing for them—diagonally—for some time!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it _is_ a ghastly innovation,” Lady Muriel replied, “letting the\r\nwaiters carry round the wine at dessert. For one thing, they _always_\r\ntake it the wrong way round—which of course brings bad luck to\r\n_everybody_ present!”\r\n\r\n“Better go the _wrong_ way than not go _at all_!” said our host. “Would\r\nyou kindly help yourself?” (This was to the fat red-faced man.) “You are\r\nnot a teetotaler, I think?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed but I _am_!” he replied, as he pushed on the bottles. “Nearly\r\ntwice as much money is spent in England on _Drink_, as on any other\r\narticle of food. Read this card.” (What faddist ever goes about without\r\na pocketful of the appropriate literature?) “The stripes of different\r\ncolours represent the amounts spent on various articles of food. Look at\r\nthe highest three. Money spent on butter and on cheese, thirty-five\r\nmillions: on bread, seventy millions: on _intoxicating liquors_, one\r\nhundred and thirty-six millions! If I had my way, I would close every\r\npublic-house in the land! Look at that card, and read the motto. _That’s\r\nwhere all the money goes to!_”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the _Anti-Teetotal Card_?” Arthur innocently enquired.\r\n\r\n“No, Sir, I have not!” the orator savagely replied. “What is it like?”\r\n\r\n“Almost exactly like this one. The coloured stripes are the same. Only,\r\ninstead of the words ‘Money spent on,’ it has ‘Incomes derived from sale\r\nof’; and, instead of ‘That’s where all the money goes to,’ its motto is\r\n‘_That’s where all the money comes from!_’”\r\n\r\nThe red-faced man scowled, but evidently considered Arthur beneath his\r\nnotice. So Lady Muriel took up the cudgels. “Do you hold the theory,”\r\nshe enquired, “that people can preach teetotalism more effectually by\r\nbeing teetotalers themselves?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I do!” replied the red-faced man. “Now, here is a case in\r\npoint,” unfolding a newspaper-cutting: “let me read you this letter from\r\na teetotaler. _To the Editor. Sir, I was once a moderate drinker, and\r\nknew a man who drank to excess. I went to him. ‘Give up this drink,’ I\r\nsaid. ‘It will ruin your health!’ ‘You drink,’ he said: ‘why shouldn’t\r\nI?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘but I know when to leave off.’ He turned away from\r\nme. ‘You drink in your way,’ he said: ‘let me drink in mine. Be off!’\r\nThen I saw that, to do any good with him, I must forswear drink. From\r\nthat hour I haven’t touched a drop!_”\r\n\r\n“There! What do you say to _that_?” He looked round triumphantly, while\r\nthe cutting was handed round for inspection.\r\n\r\n“How very curious!” exclaimed Arthur, when it had reached him. “Did you\r\nhappen to see a letter, last week, about early rising? It was strangely\r\nlike this one.”\r\n\r\nThe red-faced man’s curiosity was roused. “Where did it appear?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Let me read it to you,” said Arthur. He took some papers from his\r\npocket, opened one of them, and read as follows. “_To the Editor. Sir, I\r\nwas once a moderate sleeper, and knew a man who slept to excess. I\r\npleaded with him. ‘Give up this lying in bed,’ I said, ‘It will ruin\r\nyour health!’ ‘You go to bed,’ he said: ‘why shouldn’t I?’ ‘Yes,’ I\r\nsaid, ‘but I know when to get up in the morning.’ He turned away from\r\nme. ‘You sleep in your way,’ he said: ‘let me sleep in mine. Be off!’\r\nThen I saw that to do any good with him, I must forswear sleep. From\r\nthat hour I haven’t been to bed!_”\r\n\r\nArthur folded and pocketed his paper, and passed on the\r\nnewspaper-cutting. None of us dared to laugh, the red-faced man was\r\nevidently so angry. “Your parallel doesn’t run on all fours!” he\r\nsnarled.\r\n\r\n“_Moderate_ drinkers never do so!” Arthur quietly replied. Even the\r\nstern old lady laughed at this.\r\n\r\n“But it needs many other things to make a _perfect_ dinner!” said Lady\r\nMuriel, evidently anxious to change the subject. “Mein Herr! What is\r\n_your_ idea of a perfect dinner-party?”\r\n\r\nThe old man looked round smilingly, and his gigantic spectacles seemed\r\nmore gigantic than ever. “A _perfect_ dinner-party?” he repeated.\r\n“First, it must be presided over by our present hostess!”\r\n\r\n“That, of _course_!” she gaily interposed. “But what _else_, Mein Herr?”\r\n\r\n“I can but tell you what I have seen,” said Mein Herr, “in mine own—in\r\nthe country I have traveled in.”\r\n\r\nHe paused for a full minute, and gazed steadily at the ceiling—with so\r\ndreamy an expression on his face, that I feared he was going off into a\r\nreverie, which seemed to be his normal state. However, after a minute,\r\nhe suddenly began again.\r\n\r\n“That which chiefly causes the failure of a dinner-party, is the\r\nrunning-short—not of meat, nor yet of drink, but of _conversation_.”\r\n\r\n“In an _English_ dinner-party,” I remarked, “I have never known\r\n_small-talk_ run short!”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” Mein Herr respectfully replied, “I did not say\r\n‘small-talk.’ I said ‘conversation.’ All such topics as the weather, or\r\npolitics, or local gossip, are unknown among us. They are either vapid\r\nor controversial. What we need for _conversation_ is a topic of\r\n_interest_ and of _novelty_. To secure these things we have tried\r\nvarious plans—Moving-Pictures, Wild-Creatures, Moving-Guests, and a\r\nRevolving-Humorist. But this last is only adapted to _small_ parties.”\r\n\r\n“Let us have it in four separate Chapters, please!” said Lady Muriel,\r\nwho was evidently deeply interested—as, indeed, most of the party were,\r\nby this time: and, all down the table, talk had ceased, and heads were\r\nleaning forwards, eager to catch fragments of Mein Herr’s oration.\r\n\r\n“Chapter One! Moving-Pictures!” was proclaimed in the silvery voice of\r\nour hostess.\r\n\r\n“The dining-table is shaped like a circular ring,” Mein Herr began, in\r\nlow dreamy tones, which, however, were perfectly audible in the silence.\r\n“The guests are seated at the inner side as well as the outer, having\r\nascended to their places by a winding-staircase, from the room below.\r\nAlong the middle of the table runs a little railway; and there is an\r\nendless train of trucks, worked round by machinery; and on each truck\r\nthere are two pictures, leaning back to back. The train makes two\r\ncircuits during dinner; and, when it has been _once_ round, the waiters\r\nturn the pictures round in each truck, making them face the other way.\r\nThus _every_ guest sees _every_ picture!”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and the silence seemed deader than ever. Lady Muriel looked\r\naghast. “Really, if this goes on,” she exclaimed, “I shall have to drop\r\na pin! Oh, it’s _my_ fault, is it?” (In answer to an appealing look from\r\nMein Herr.) “I was forgetting my duty. Chapter Two! Wild-Creatures!”\r\n\r\n“We found the Moving-Pictures a _little_ monotonous,” said Mein Herr.\r\n“People didn’t care to talk Art through a whole dinner; so we tried\r\nWild-Creatures. Among the flowers, which we laid (just as _you_ do)\r\nabout the table, were to be seen, here a mouse, there a beetle; here a\r\nspider,” (Lady Muriel shuddered) “there a wasp; here a toad, there a\r\nsnake;” (“Father!” said Lady Muriel, plaintively. “Did you hear\r\n_that_?”) “so we had plenty to talk about!”\r\n\r\n“And when you got stung——” the old lady began.\r\n\r\n“They were all chained-up, dear Madam!”\r\n\r\nAnd the old lady gave a satisfied nod.\r\n\r\nThere was no silence to follow, _this_ time. “Third Chapter!” Lady\r\nMuriel proclaimed at once, “Moving-Guests!”\r\n\r\n“Even the Wild-Creatures proved monotonous,” the orator proceeded. “So\r\nwe left the guests to choose their own subjects; and, to avoid monotony,\r\nwe changed _them_. We made the table of _two_ rings; and the inner ring\r\nmoved slowly round, all the time, along with the floor in the middle and\r\nthe inner row of guests. Thus _every_ inner guest was brought\r\nface-to-face with _every_ outer guest. It was a little confusing,\r\nsometimes, to have to _begin_ a story to one friend and _finish_ it to\r\nanother; but _every_ plan has its faults, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Fourth Chapter!” Lady Muriel hastened to announce. “The\r\nRevolving-Humorist!”\r\n\r\n“For a _small_ party we found it an excellent plan to have a round\r\ntable, with a hole cut in the middle large enough to hold _one_ guest.\r\nHere we placed our _best_ talker. He revolved slowly, facing every other\r\nguest in turn: and he told lively anecdotes the whole time!”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t like it!” murmured the pompous man. “It would make me\r\ngiddy, revolving like that! I should decline to——” here it appeared to\r\ndawn upon him that perhaps the assumption he was making was not\r\nwarranted by the circumstances: he took a hasty gulp of wine, and choked\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut Mein Herr had relapsed into reverie, and made no further remark.\r\nLady Muriel gave the signal, and the ladies left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                           JABBERING AND JAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the last lady had disappeared, and the Earl, taking his place at\r\nthe head of the table, had issued the military order “Gentlemen! Close\r\nup the ranks, if you please!”, and when, in obedience to his command, we\r\nhad gathered ourselves compactly round him, the pompous man gave a deep\r\nsigh of relief, filled his glass to the brim, pushed on the wine, and\r\nbegan one of his favorite orations. “They are charming, no doubt!\r\nCharming, but very frivolous. They drag us down, so to speak, to a lower\r\nlevel. They——”\r\n\r\n“Do not all pronouns require antecedent _nouns_?” the Earl gently\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said the pompous man, with lofty condescension. “I had\r\noverlooked the noun. The ladies. We regret their absence. Yet we console\r\nourselves. _Thought is free._ With them, we are limited to _trivial_\r\ntopics—Art, Literature, Politics, and so forth. One can bear to discuss\r\n_such_ paltry matters with a lady. But no man, in his senses—” (he\r\nlooked sternly round the table, as if defying contradiction) “—ever yet\r\ndiscussed _WINE_ with a lady!” He sipped his glass of port, leaned back\r\nin his chair, and slowly raised it up to his eye, so as to look through\r\nit at the lamp. “The vintage, my Lord?” he enquired, glancing at his\r\nhost.\r\n\r\nThe Earl named the date.\r\n\r\n“So I had supposed. But one likes to be certain. The _tint_ is, perhaps,\r\nslightly pale. But the _body_ is unquestionable. And as for the\r\n_bouquet_——”\r\n\r\nAh, that magic Bouquet! How vividly that single word recalled the scene!\r\nThe little beggar-boy turning his somersault in the road—the sweet\r\nlittle crippled maiden in my arms—the mysterious evanescent\r\nnurse-maid—all rushed tumultuously into my mind, like the creatures of a\r\ndream: and through this mental haze there still boomed on, like the\r\ntolling of a bell, the solemn voice of the great connoisseur of _WINE_!\r\n\r\nEven _his_ utterances had taken on themselves a strange and dream-like\r\nform. “No,” he resumed—and _why_ is it, I pause to ask, that, in taking\r\nup the broken thread of a dialogue, one _always_ begins with this\r\ncheerless monosyllable? After much anxious thought, I have come to the\r\nconclusion that the object in view is the same as that of the schoolboy,\r\nwhen the sum he is working has got into a hopeless muddle, and when in\r\ndespair he takes the sponge, washes it all out, and begins again. Just\r\nin the same way the bewildered orator, by the simple process of denying\r\n_everything_ that has been hitherto asserted, makes a clean sweep of the\r\nwhole discussion, and can ‘start fair’ with a fresh theory. “No,” he\r\nresumed: “there’s nothing like cherry-jam, after all. That’s what _I_\r\nsay!”\r\n\r\n“Not for _all_ qualities!” an eager little man shrilly interposed. “For\r\n_richness_ of general tone I don’t say that it _has_ a rival. But for\r\n_delicacy_ of modulation—for what one may call the ‘_harmonics_’ of\r\nflavour—give _me_ good old _raspberry_-jam!”\r\n\r\n“Allow me one word!” The fat red-faced man, quite hoarse with\r\nexcitement, broke into the dialogue. “It’s too important a question to\r\nbe settled by Amateurs! I can give you the views of a\r\n_Professional_—perhaps the most experienced jam-taster now living. Why,\r\nI’ve known him fix the age of strawberry-jam, to a _day_—and we all know\r\nwhat a difficult jam it is to give a date to—on a single tasting! Well,\r\nI put to him the _very_ question you are discussing. His words were\r\n‘_cherry_-jam is best, for mere _chiaroscuro_ of flavour:\r\n_raspberry_-jam lends itself best to those resolved discords that linger\r\nso lovingly on the tongue: but, for rapturous _utterness_ of saccharine\r\nperfection, it’s _apricot-jam first and the rest nowhere_!’ That was\r\nwell put, _wasn’t_ it?”\r\n\r\n“Consummately put!” shrieked the eager little man.\r\n\r\n“I know your friend well,” said the pompous man. “As a jam-taster, he\r\nhas no rival! Yet I scarcely think——”\r\n\r\nBut here the discussion became general: and his words were lost in a\r\nconfused medley of names, every guest sounding the praises of his own\r\nfavorite jam. At length, through the din, our host’s voice made itself\r\nheard. “Let us join the ladies!” These words seemed to recall me to\r\nwaking life; and I felt sure that, for the last few minutes, I had\r\nrelapsed into the ‘eerie’ state.\r\n\r\n“A strange dream!” I said to myself as we trooped upstairs. “Grown men\r\ndiscussing, as seriously as if they were matters of life and death, the\r\nhopelessly trivial details of mere _delicacies_, that appeal to no\r\nhigher human function than the nerves of the tongue and palate! What a\r\nhumiliating spectacle such a discussion would be in waking life!”\r\n\r\nWhen, on our way to the drawing-room, I received from the housekeeper my\r\nlittle friends, clad in the daintiest of evening costumes, and looking,\r\nin the flush of expectant delight, more radiantly beautiful than I had\r\never seen them before, I felt no shock of surprise, but accepted the\r\nfact with the same unreasoning apathy with which one meets the events of\r\na dream, and was merely conscious of a vague anxiety as to how they\r\nwould acquit themselves in so novel a scene—forgetting that Court-life\r\nin Outland was as good training as they could need for Society in the\r\nmore substantial world.\r\n\r\nIt would be best, I thought, to introduce them as soon as possible to\r\nsome good-natured lady-guest, and I selected the young lady whose\r\npiano-forte-playing had been so much talked of. “I am sure you like\r\nchildren,” I said. “May I introduce two little friends of mine? This is\r\nSylvie—and this is Bruno.”\r\n\r\nThe young lady kissed Sylvie very graciously. She would have done the\r\nsame for _Bruno_, but he hastily drew back out of reach. “Their faces\r\nare new to me,” she said. “Where do you come from, my dear?”\r\n\r\nI had not anticipated so inconvenient a question; and, fearing that it\r\nmight embarrass Sylvie, I answered for her. “They come from some\r\ndistance. They are only here just for this one evening.”\r\n\r\n“How far have you come, dear?” the young lady persisted.\r\n\r\nSylvie looked puzzled. “A mile or two, I _think_,” she said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“A mile or _three_,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t say ‘a mile or _three_,’” Sylvie corrected him.\r\n\r\nThe young lady nodded approval. “Sylvie’s quite right. It isn’t usual to\r\nsay ‘a mile or _three_.’”\r\n\r\n“It would be usual—if we said it often enough,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\nIt was the young lady’s turn to look puzzled now. “He’s very quick, for\r\nhis age!” she murmured. “You’re not more than seven, are you, dear?” she\r\nadded aloud.\r\n\r\n“I’m not so many as _that_,” said Bruno. “I’m _one_. Sylvie’s _one_.\r\nSylvie and me is _two_. _Sylvie_ taught me to count.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I wasn’t _counting_ you, you know!” the young lady laughingly\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“Hasn’t oo _learnt_ to count?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\nThe young lady bit her lip. “Dear! What embarrassing questions he _does_\r\nask!” she said in a half-audible ‘aside.’\r\n\r\n“Bruno, you shouldn’t!” Sylvie said reprovingly.\r\n\r\n“Shouldn’t _what_?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t ask—that sort of questions.”\r\n\r\n“_What_ sort of questions?” Bruno mischievously persisted.\r\n\r\n“What _she_ told you not,” Sylvie replied, with a shy glance at the\r\nyoung lady, and losing all sense of grammar in her confusion.\r\n\r\n“Oo ca’n’t pronounce it!” Bruno triumphantly cried. And he turned to the\r\nyoung lady, for sympathy in his victory. “I _knewed_ she couldn’t\r\npronounce ‘umbrella-sting’!”\r\n\r\nThe young lady thought it best to return to the arithmetical problem.\r\n“When I asked if you were _seven_, you know, I didn’t mean ‘how many\r\n_children_?’ I meant ‘how many _years_——’”\r\n\r\n“Only got _two_ ears,” said Bruno. “Nobody’s got _seven_ ears.”\r\n\r\n“And you belong to this little girl?” the young lady continued,\r\nskilfully evading the anatomical problem.\r\n\r\n“No, I doosn’t belong to _her_!” said Bruno. “Sylvie belongs to _me_!”\r\nAnd he clasped his arms round her as he added “She are my very mine!”\r\n\r\n“And, do you know,” said the young lady, “I’ve a little sister at home,\r\nexactly like _your_ sister? I’m sure they’d love each other.”\r\n\r\n“They’d be very extremely useful to each other,” Bruno said,\r\nthoughtfully. “And they wouldn’t want no looking-glasses to brush their\r\nhair wiz.”\r\n\r\n“Why not, my child?”\r\n\r\n“Why, each one would do for the other one’s looking-glass, a-course!”\r\ncried Bruno.\r\n\r\nBut here Lady Muriel, who had been standing by, listening to this\r\nbewildering dialogue, interrupted it to ask if the young lady would\r\nfavour us with some music; and the children followed their new friend to\r\nthe piano.\r\n\r\nArthur came and sat down by me. “If rumour speaks truly,” he whispered,\r\n“we are to have a real treat!” And then, amid a breathless silence, the\r\nperformance began.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those players whom Society talks of as ‘brilliant,’ and\r\nshe dashed into the loveliest of Haydn’s Symphonies in a style that was\r\nclearly the outcome of years of patient study under the best masters. At\r\nfirst it seemed to be the perfection of piano-forte-playing; but in a\r\nfew minutes I began to ask myself, wearily, “_What_ is it that is\r\nwanting? _Why_ does one get no pleasure from it?”\r\n\r\nThen I set myself to listen intently to every note; and the mystery\r\nexplained itself. There _was_ an almost-perfect mechanical\r\n_correctness_—and there was nothing else! False notes, of course, did\r\nnot occur: she knew the piece too well for _that_; but there was just\r\nenough irregularity of _time_ to betray that the player had no real\r\n‘ear’ for music—just enough inarticulateness in the more elaborate\r\npassages to show that she did not think her audience worth taking real\r\npains for—just enough mechanical monotony of accent to take all _soul_\r\nout of the heavenly modulations she was profaning—in short, it was\r\nsimply irritating; and, when she had rattled off the finale and had\r\nstruck the final chord as if, the instrument being now done with, it\r\ndidn’t matter how many wires she broke, I could not even _affect_ to\r\njoin in the stereotyped “Oh, _thank_ you!” which was chorused around me.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel joined us for a moment. “Isn’t it _beautiful_?” she\r\nwhispered, to Arthur, with a mischievous smile.\r\n\r\n“No, it isn’t!” said Arthur. But the gentle sweetness of his face quite\r\nneutralised the apparent rudeness of the reply.\r\n\r\n“Such execution, you know!” she persisted.\r\n\r\n“That’s what she _deserves_,” Arthur doggedly replied: “but people are\r\nso prejudiced against capital——”\r\n\r\n“Now you’re beginning to talk nonsense!” Lady Muriel cried. “But you\r\n_do_ like Music, don’t you? You said so just now.”\r\n\r\n“Do I like _Music_?” the Doctor repeated softly to himself. “My dear\r\nLady Muriel, there is Music and Music. Your question is painfully vague.\r\nYou might as well ask ‘Do you like _People_?’”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel bit her lip, frowned, and stamped with one tiny foot. As a\r\ndramatic representation of ill-temper, it was distinctly _not_ a\r\nsuccess. However, it took in _one_ of her audience, and Bruno hastened\r\nto interpose, as peacemaker in a rising quarrel, with the remark “_I_\r\nlikes Peoples!”\r\n\r\nArthur laid a loving hand on the little curly head. “What? _All_\r\nPeoples?” he enquired.\r\n\r\n“Not _all_ Peoples,” Bruno explained. “Only but Sylvie—and Lady\r\nMuriel—and him—” (pointing to the Earl) “and oo—and oo!”\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t point at people,” said Sylvie. “It’s very rude.”\r\n\r\n“In Bruno’s World,” I said, “there are only _four_ People—worth\r\nmentioning!”\r\n\r\n“In Bruno’s World!” Lady Muriel repeated thoughtfully. “A bright and\r\nflowery world. Where the grass is always green, where the breezes always\r\nblow softly, and the rain-clouds never gather; where there are no wild\r\nbeasts, and no deserts——”\r\n\r\n“There _must_ be deserts,” Arthur decisively remarked. “At least if it\r\nwas _my_ ideal world.”\r\n\r\n“But what possible use is there in a _desert_?” said Lady Muriel.\r\n“_Surely_ you would have no wilderness in your ideal world?”\r\n\r\nArthur smiled. “But indeed I _would_!” he said. “A wilderness would be\r\nmore necessary than a railway; and _far_ more conducive to general\r\nhappiness than church-bells!”\r\n\r\n“But what would you use it for?”\r\n\r\n“_To practise music in_,” he replied. “All the young ladies, that have\r\nno ear for music, but insist on learning it, should be conveyed, every\r\nmorning, two or three miles into the wilderness. There each would find a\r\ncomfortable room provided for her, and also a cheap second-hand\r\npiano-forte, on which she might play for hours, without adding one\r\nneedless pang to the sum of human misery!”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel glanced round in alarm, lest these barbarous sentiments\r\nshould be overheard. But the fair musician was at a safe distance. “At\r\nany rate you must allow that she’s a sweet girl?” she resumed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly. As sweet as _eau sucrée_, if you choose—and nearly as\r\ninteresting!”\r\n\r\n“You are incorrigible!” said Lady Muriel, and turned to me. “I hope you\r\nfound Mrs. Mills an interesting companion?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _that’s_ her name, is it?” I said. “I fancied there was _more_ of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“So there is: and it will be ‘at your proper peril’ (whatever that may\r\nmean) if you ever presume to address her as ‘Mrs. Mills.’ She is ‘Mrs.\r\nErnest—Atkinson—Mills’!”\r\n\r\n“She is one of those would-be grandees,” said Arthur, “who think that,\r\nby tacking on to their surname all their spare Christian-names, with\r\nhyphens between, they can give it an aristocratic flavour. As if it\r\nwasn’t trouble enough to remember _one_ surname!”\r\n\r\nBy this time the room was getting crowded, as the guests, invited for\r\nthe evening-party, were beginning to arrive, and Lady Muriel had to\r\ndevote herself to the task of welcoming them, which she did with the\r\nsweetest grace imaginable. Sylvie and Bruno stood by her, deeply\r\ninterested in the process.\r\n\r\n“I hope you like my friends?” she said to them. “Specially my dear old\r\nfriend, Mein Herr (What’s become of him, I wonder? Oh, there he is!),\r\nthat old gentleman in spectacles, with a long beard?”\r\n\r\n“He’s a grand old gentleman!” Sylvie said, gazing admiringly at ‘Mein\r\nHerr,’ who had settled down in a corner, from which his mild eyes beamed\r\non us through a gigantic pair of spectacles. “And what a lovely beard!”\r\n\r\n“What does he call his-self?” Bruno whispered.\r\n\r\n“He calls himself ‘Mein Herr,’” Sylvie whispered in reply.\r\n\r\nBruno shook his head impatiently. “That’s what he calls his _hair_, not\r\nhis _self_, oo silly!” He appealed to me. “What doos he call his _self_,\r\nMister Sir?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the only name _I_ know of,” I said. “But he looks very lonely.\r\nDon’t you pity his grey hairs?”\r\n\r\n“I pities his _self_,” said Bruno, still harping on the misnomer; “but I\r\ndoosn’t pity his _hair_, one bit. His _hair_ ca’n’t feel!”\r\n\r\n“We met him this afternoon,” said Sylvie. “We’d been to see Nero, and\r\nwe’d had _such_ fun with him, making him invisible again! And we saw\r\nthat nice old gentleman as we came back.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s go and talk to him, and cheer him up a little,” I said:\r\n“and perhaps we shall find out what he calls himself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                          THE MAN IN THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children came willingly. With one of them on each side of me, I\r\napproached the corner occupied by ‘Mein Herr.’ “You don’t object to\r\n_children_, I hope?” I began.\r\n\r\n“_Crabbed age and youth cannot live together!_” the old man cheerfully\r\nreplied, with a most genial smile. “Now take a good look at me, my\r\nchildren! You would guess me to be an _old_ man, wouldn’t you?”\r\n\r\nAt first sight, though his face had reminded me so mysteriously of “the\r\nProfessor,” he had seemed to be decidedly a _younger_ man: but, when I\r\ncame to look into the wonderful depth of those large dreamy eyes, I\r\nfelt, with a strange sense of awe, that he was incalculably _older_: he\r\nseemed to gaze at us out of some by-gone age, centuries away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEIN HERR’S FAIRY-FRIENDS]\r\n\r\n“I don’t know if oo’re an _old_ man,” Bruno answered, as the children,\r\nwon over by the gentle voice, crept a little closer to him. “I thinks\r\noo’re _eighty-three_.”\r\n\r\n“He is very exact!” said Mein Herr.\r\n\r\n“Is he anything like right?” I said.\r\n\r\n“There are reasons,” Mein Herr gently replied, “reasons which I am not\r\nat liberty to explain, for not mentioning _definitely_ any Persons,\r\nPlaces, or Dates. One remark only I will permit myself to make—that the\r\nperiod of life, between the ages of a hundred-and-sixty-five and a\r\nhundred-and-seventy-five, is a specially _safe_ one.”\r\n\r\n“How do you make that out?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Thus. You would consider swimming to be a very safe amusement, if you\r\nscarcely ever heard of any one dying of it. Am I not right in thinking\r\nthat you never heard of any one dying between those two ages?”\r\n\r\n“I see what you mean,” I said: “but I’m afraid you ca’n’t prove\r\n_swimming_ to be safe, on the same principle. It is no uncommon thing to\r\nhear of some one being _drowned_.”\r\n\r\n“In _my_ country,” said Mein Herr, “no one is _ever_ drowned.”\r\n\r\n“Is there no water deep enough?”\r\n\r\n“Plenty! But we ca’n’t _sink_. We are all _lighter than water_. Let me\r\nexplain,” he added, seeing my look of surprise. “Suppose you desire a\r\nrace of _pigeons_ of a particular shape or colour, do you not select,\r\nfrom year to year, those that are nearest to the shape or colour you\r\nwant, and keep those, and part with the others?”\r\n\r\n“We do,” I replied. “We call it ‘Artificial Selection.’”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so,” said Mein Herr. “Well, _we_ have practised that for some\r\ncenturies—constantly selecting the _lightest_ people: so that, now,\r\n_everybody_ is lighter than water.”\r\n\r\n“Then you never can be drowned at _sea_?”\r\n\r\n“Never! It is only on the _land_—for instance, when attending a play in\r\na theatre—that we are in such a danger.”\r\n\r\n“How can that happen at a _theatre_?”\r\n\r\n“Our theatres are all _underground_. Large tanks of water are placed\r\nabove. If a fire breaks out, the taps are turned, and in one minute the\r\ntheatre is flooded, up to the very roof! Thus the fire is extinguished.”\r\n\r\n“_And_ the audience, I presume?”\r\n\r\n“That is a minor matter,” Mein Herr carelessly replied. “But they have\r\nthe comfort of knowing that, whether drowned or not, they are all\r\n_lighter than water_. We have not yet reached the standard of making\r\npeople lighter than _air_: but we are _aiming_ at it; and, in another\r\nthousand years or so——”\r\n\r\n“What doos oo do wiz the peoples that’s too heavy?” Bruno solemnly\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\n“We have applied the same process,” Mein Herr continued, not noticing\r\nBruno’s question, “to many other purposes. We have gone on selecting\r\n_walking-sticks_—always keeping those that walked _best_—till we have\r\nobtained some, that can walk by themselves! We have gone on selecting\r\n_cotton-wool_, till we have got some lighter than air! You’ve no idea\r\nwhat a useful material it is! We call it ‘Imponderal.’”\r\n\r\n“What do you use it for?”\r\n\r\n“Well, chiefly for _packing_ articles, to go by Parcel-Post. It makes\r\nthem weigh _less than nothing_, you know.”\r\n\r\n“And how do the Post-Office people know what you have to pay?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the beauty of the new system!” Mein Herr cried exultingly. “They\r\npay _us_: we don’t pay _them_! I’ve often got as much as five shillings\r\nfor sending a parcel.”\r\n\r\n“But doesn’t your Government object?”\r\n\r\n“Well, they _do_ object, a little. They say it comes so expensive, in\r\nthe long run. But the thing’s as clear as daylight, by their own rules.\r\nIf I send a parcel, that weighs a pound _more_ than nothing, I _pay_\r\nthree-pence: so, of course, if it weighs a pound _less_ than nothing, I\r\nought to _receive_ three-pence.”\r\n\r\n“It is _indeed_ a useful article!” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yet even ‘Imponderal’ has its disadvantages,” he resumed. “I bought\r\nsome, a few days ago, and put it into my _hat_, to carry it home, and\r\nthe hat simply floated away!”\r\n\r\n“Had oo some of that funny stuff in oor hat _today_?” Bruno enquired.\r\n“Sylvie and me saw oo in the road, and oor hat were ever so high up!\r\nWeren’t it, Sylvie?”\r\n\r\n“No, that was quite another thing.” said Mein Herr. “There was a drop or\r\ntwo of rain falling: so I put my hat on the top of my stick—as an\r\numbrella, you know. As I came along the road,” he continued, turning to\r\nme, “I was overtaken by——”\r\n\r\n“——a shower of rain?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“Well, it _looked_ more like the tail of a dog,” Mein Herr replied. “It\r\nwas the most curious thing! Something rubbed affectionately against my\r\nknee. And I looked down. And I could see _nothing_! Only, about a yard\r\noff, there was a dog’s tail, wagging, all by itself!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _Sylvie_!” Bruno murmured reproachfully. “Oo didn’t finish making\r\nhim visible!”\r\n\r\n“I’m _so_ sorry!” Sylvie said, looking very penitent. “I meant to rub it\r\nalong his back, but we were in such a hurry. We’ll go and finish him\r\ntomorrow. Poor thing! Perhaps he’ll get no supper tonight!”\r\n\r\n“_Course_ he won’t!” said Bruno. “Nobody never gives bones to a dog’s\r\ntail!”\r\n\r\nMein Herr looked from one to the other in blank astonishment. “I do not\r\nunderstand you,” he said. “I had lost my way, and I was consulting a\r\npocket-map, and somehow I had dropped one of my gloves, and this\r\ninvisible _Something_, that had rubbed against my knee, actually brought\r\nit back to me!”\r\n\r\n“Course he did!” said Bruno. “He’s _welly_ fond of fetching things.”\r\n\r\nMein Herr looked so thoroughly bewildered that I thought it best to\r\nchange the subject. “What a useful thing a pocket-map is!” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“That’s another thing we’ve learned from _your_ Nation,” said Mein Herr,\r\n“map-making. But we’ve carried it much further than _you_. What do you\r\nconsider the _largest_ map that would be really useful?”\r\n\r\n“About six inches to the mile.”\r\n\r\n“Only _six inches_!” exclaimed Mein Herr. “We very soon got to six\r\n_yards_ to the mile. Then we tried a _hundred_ yards to the mile. And\r\nthen came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map of the\r\ncountry, on the scale of _a mile to the mile_!”\r\n\r\n“Have you used it much?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“It has never been spread out, yet,” said Mein Herr: “the farmers\r\nobjected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the\r\nsunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure\r\nyou it does nearly as well. Now let me ask you _another_ question. What\r\nis the smallest _world_ you would care to inhabit?”\r\n\r\n“_I_ know!” cried Bruno, who was listening intently. “I’d like a little\r\nteeny-tiny world, just big enough for Sylvie and me!”\r\n\r\n“Then you would have to stand on opposite sides of it,” said Mein Herr.\r\n“And so you would never see your sister _at all_!”\r\n\r\n“And I’d have no _lessons_,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean to say you’ve been trying experiments in _that_\r\ndirection!” I said.\r\n\r\n“Well, not _experiments_ exactly. We do not profess to _construct_\r\nplanets. But a scientific friend of mine, who has made several\r\nballoon-voyages, assures me he has visited a planet so small that he\r\ncould walk right round it in twenty minutes! There had been a great\r\nbattle, just before his visit, which had ended rather oddly: the\r\nvanquished army ran away at full speed, and in a very few minutes found\r\nthemselves face-to-face with the victorious army, who were marching home\r\nagain, and who were so frightened at finding themselves between _two_\r\narmies, that they surrendered at once! Of course that lost them the\r\nbattle, though, as a matter of fact, they had killed _all_ the soldiers\r\non the other side.”\r\n\r\n“Killed soldiers _ca’n’t_ run away,” Bruno thoughtfully remarked.\r\n\r\n“‘Killed’ is a technical word,” replied Mein Herr. “In the little planet\r\nI speak of, the bullets were made of soft black stuff, which marked\r\neverything it touched. So, after a battle, all you had to do was to\r\ncount how many soldiers on each side were ‘killed’—that means ‘marked on\r\nthe _back_,’ for marks in _front_ didn’t count.”\r\n\r\n“Then you couldn’t ‘kill’ any, unless they ran away?” I said.\r\n\r\n“My scientific friend found out a better plan than _that_. He pointed\r\nout that, if only the bullets were sent _the other way round the world_,\r\nthey would hit the enemy in the _back_. After that, the _worst_ marksmen\r\nwere considered the _best_ soldiers; and _the very worst of all_ always\r\ngot First Prize.”\r\n\r\n“And how did you decide which was _the very worst of all_?”\r\n\r\n“Easily. The _best_ possible shooting is, you know, to hit what is\r\nexactly in _front_ of you: so of course the _worst_ possible is to hit\r\nwhat is exactly _behind_ you.”\r\n\r\n“They were strange people in that little planet!” I said.\r\n\r\n“They were indeed! Perhaps their method of _government_ was the\r\nstrangest of all. In _this_ planet, I am told, a Nation consists of a\r\nnumber of Subjects, and one King: but, in the little planet I speak of,\r\nit consisted of a number of _Kings_, and one _Subject_!”\r\n\r\n“You say you are ‘told’ what happens in _this_ planet,” I said. “May I\r\nventure to guess that you yourself are a visitor from some _other_\r\nplanet?”\r\n\r\nBruno clapped his hands in his excitement. “Is oo the Man-in-the-Moon?”\r\nhe cried.\r\n\r\nMein Herr looked uneasy. “I am _not_ in the Moon, my child,” he said\r\nevasively. “To return to what I was saying. I think _that_ method of\r\ngovernment ought to answer _well_. You see, the Kings would be sure to\r\nmake Laws contradicting each other: so the Subject could never be\r\npunished, because, _whatever_ he did, he’d be obeying _some_ Law.”\r\n\r\n“And, whatever he did, he’d be _dis_obeying _some_ Law!” cried Bruno.\r\n“So he’d _always_ be punished!”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel was passing at the moment, and caught the last word.\r\n“Nobody’s going to be punished _here_!” she said, taking Bruno in her\r\narms. “This is Liberty-Hall! Would you lend me the children for a\r\nminute?”\r\n\r\n“The children desert us, you see,” I said to Mein Herr, as she carried\r\nthem off: “so we old folk must keep each other company!”\r\n\r\nThe old man sighed. “Ah, well! We’re old folk _now_; and yet I was a\r\nchild myself, once—at least I fancy so.”\r\n\r\nIt _did_ seem a rather unlikely fancy, I could not help owning to\r\nmyself—looking at the shaggy white hair, and the long beard—that he\r\ncould _ever_ have been a child. “You are fond of young people?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Young _men_,” he replied. “Not of _children_ exactly. I used to teach\r\nyoung men—many a year ago—in my dear old University!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t quite catch its _name_?” I hinted.\r\n\r\n“I did not name it,” the old man replied mildly. “Nor would you know the\r\nname if I did. Strange tales I could tell you of all the changes I have\r\nwitnessed there! But it would weary you, I fear.”\r\n\r\n“No, _indeed_!” I said. “Pray go on. What kind of changes?”\r\n\r\nBut the old man seemed to be more in a humour for questions than for\r\nanswers. “Tell me,” he said, laying his hand impressively on my arm,\r\n“tell me something. For I am a stranger in your land, and I know little\r\nof _your_ modes of education: yet something tells me _we_ are further on\r\nthan _you_ in the eternal cycle of change—and that many a theory _we_\r\nhave tried and found to fail, _you_ also will try, with a wilder\r\nenthusiasm: you also will find to fail, with a bitterer despair!”\r\n\r\nIt was strange to see how, as he talked, and his words flowed more and\r\nmore freely, with a certain rhythmic eloquence, his features seemed to\r\nglow with an inner light, and the whole man seemed to be transformed, as\r\nif he had grown fifty years younger in a moment of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n                              FAIRY-MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silence that ensued was broken by the voice of the musical young\r\nlady, who had seated herself near us, and was conversing with one of the\r\nnewly-arrived guests. “Well!” she said in a tone of scornful surprise.\r\n“We _are_ to have something new in the way of music, it appears!”\r\n\r\nI looked round for an explanation, and was nearly as much astonished as\r\nthe speaker herself: it was _Sylvie_ whom Lady Muriel was leading to the\r\npiano!\r\n\r\n“Do try it, my darling!” she was saying. “I’m sure you can play very\r\nnicely!”\r\n\r\nSylvie looked round at me, with tears in her eyes. I tried to give her\r\nan encouraging smile, but it was evidently a great strain on the nerves\r\nof a child so wholly unused to be made an exhibition of, and she was\r\nfrightened and unhappy. Yet here came out the perfect sweetness of her\r\ndisposition: I could see that she was resolved to forget herself, and do\r\nher best to give pleasure to Lady Muriel and her friends. She seated\r\nherself at the instrument, and began instantly. Time and expression, so\r\nfar as one could judge, were perfect: but her touch was one of such\r\nextraordinary lightness that it was at first scarcely possible, through\r\nthe hum of conversation which still continued, to catch a note of what\r\nshe was playing.\r\n\r\nBut in a minute the hum had died away into absolute silence, and we all\r\nsat, entranced and breathless, to listen to such heavenly music as none\r\nthen present could ever forget.\r\n\r\nHardly touching the notes at first, she played a sort of introduction in\r\na minor key—like an embodied twilight; one felt as though the lights\r\nwere growing dim, and a mist were creeping through the room. Then there\r\nflashed through the gathering gloom the first few notes of a melody so\r\nlovely, so delicate, that one held one’s breath, fearful to lose a\r\nsingle note of it. Ever and again the music dropped into the pathetic\r\nminor key with which it had begun, and, each time that the melody forced\r\nits way, so to speak, through the enshrouding gloom into the light of\r\nday, it was more entrancing, more magically sweet. Under the airy touch\r\nof the child, the instrument actually seemed to _warble_, like a bird.\r\n“_Rise up, my love, my fair one_,” it seemed to sing, “_and come away!\r\nFor lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers\r\nappear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come!_” One\r\ncould fancy one heard the tinkle of the last few drops, shaken from the\r\ntrees by a passing gust—that one saw the first glittering rays of the\r\nsun, breaking through the clouds.\r\n\r\nThe Count hurried across the room in great excitement. “I _cannot_\r\nremember myself,” he exclaimed, “of the name of this so charming an air!\r\nIt is of an opera, most surely. Yet not even will the _opera_ remind his\r\nname to me! What you call him, dear child?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘HOW CALL YOU THE OPERA?’]\r\n\r\nSylvie looked round at him with a rapt expression of face. She had\r\nceased playing, but her fingers still wandered fitfully over the keys.\r\nAll fear and shyness had quite passed away now, and nothing remained but\r\nthe pure joy of the music that had thrilled our hearts.\r\n\r\n“The title of it!” the Count repeated impatiently. “How call you the\r\nopera?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what an opera _is_,” Sylvie half-whispered.\r\n\r\n“How, then, call you the _air_?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know any name for it,” Sylvie replied, as she rose from the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n“But this is marvellous!” exclaimed the Count, following the child, and\r\naddressing himself to me, as if I were the proprietor of this musical\r\nprodigy, and so _must_ know the origin of her music. “You have heard her\r\nplay this, sooner—I would say ‘before this occasion’? How call you the\r\nair?”\r\n\r\nI shook my head; but was saved from more questions by Lady Muriel, who\r\ncame up to petition the Count for a song.\r\n\r\nThe Count spread out his hands apologetically, and ducked his head.\r\n“But, Milady, I have already respected—I would say prospected—all your\r\nsongs; and there shall be none fitted to my voice! They are not for\r\nbasso voices!”\r\n\r\n“Wo’n’t you look at them again?” Lady Muriel implored.\r\n\r\n“Let’s help him!” Bruno whispered to Sylvie. “Let’s get him—_you_ know!”\r\n\r\nSylvie nodded. “Shall _we_ look for a song for you?” she said sweetly to\r\nthe Count.\r\n\r\n“Mais _oui_!” the little man exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Of course we may!” said Bruno, while, each taking a hand of the\r\ndelighted Count, they led him to the music-stand.\r\n\r\n“There is still hope!” said Lady Muriel over her shoulder, as she\r\nfollowed them.\r\n\r\nI turned to ‘Mein Herr,’ hoping to resume our interrupted conversation.\r\n“You were remarking——” I began: but at this moment Sylvie came to call\r\nBruno, who had returned to my side, looking unusually serious. “_Do_\r\ncome, Bruno!” she entreated. “You know we’ve nearly found it!” Then, in\r\na whisper, “The locket’s in my _hand_, now. I couldn’t get it out while\r\nthey were looking!”\r\n\r\nBut Bruno drew back. “The man called me names,” he said with dignity.\r\n\r\n“What names?” I enquired with some curiosity.\r\n\r\n“I asked him,” said Bruno, “which sort of song he liked. And he said\r\n‘_A_ song of _a_ man, not of _a_ lady.’ And I said ‘Shall Sylvie and me\r\nfind you the song of Mister Tottles?’ And he said ‘Wait, eel!’ And I’m\r\n_not_ an eel, oo know!”\r\n\r\n“I’m _sure_ he didn’t mean it!” Sylvie said earnestly. “It’s something\r\nFrench—you know he ca’n’t talk English so well as——”\r\n\r\nBruno relented visibly. “Course he knows no better, if he’s Flench!\r\nFlenchmen _never_ can speak English so goodly as _us_!” And Sylvie led\r\nhim away, a willing captive.\r\n\r\n“Nice children!” said the old man, taking off his spectacles and rubbing\r\nthem carefully. Then he put them on again, and watched with an approving\r\nsmile, while the children tossed over the heap of music, and we just\r\ncaught Sylvie’s reproving words, “We’re _not_ making hay, Bruno!”\r\n\r\n“This has been a long interruption to our conversation,” I said. “Pray\r\nlet us go on!”\r\n\r\n“Willingly!” replied the gentle old man.\r\n\r\n“I was much interested in what you——” He paused a moment, and passed his\r\nhand uneasily across his brow. “One forgets,” he murmured. “What was I\r\nsaying? Oh! Something you were to tell me. Yes. Which of your teachers\r\ndo you value the most highly, those whose words are easily understood,\r\nor those who puzzle you at every turn?”\r\n\r\nI felt obliged to admit that we generally admired most the teachers we\r\ncouldn’t quite understand.\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said Mein Herr. “That’s the way it begins. Well, _we_ were at\r\nthat stage some eighty years ago—or was it ninety? Our favourite teacher\r\ngot more obscure every year; and every year we admired him more—just as\r\n_your_ Art-fanciers call _mist_ the fairest feature in a landscape, and\r\nadmire a view with frantic delight when they can see nothing! Now I’ll\r\ntell you how it ended. It was Moral Philosophy that our idol lectured\r\non. Well, his pupils couldn’t make head or tail of it, but they got it\r\nall by heart; and, when Examination-time came, they wrote it down; and\r\nthe Examiners said ‘Beautiful! What depth!’”\r\n\r\n“But what good was it to the young men _afterwards_?”\r\n\r\n“Why, don’t you see?” replied Mein Herr. “_They_ became teachers in\r\ntheir turn, and _they_ said all these things over again; and _their_\r\npupils wrote it all down; and the Examiners accepted it; and nobody had\r\nthe ghost of an idea what it all meant!”\r\n\r\n“And how did it end?”\r\n\r\n“It ended this way. We woke up one fine day, and found there was no one\r\nin the place that knew _anything_ about Moral Philosophy. So we\r\nabolished it, teachers, classes, examiners, and all. And if any one\r\nwanted to learn anything about it, he had to make it out for himself;\r\nand after another twenty years or so there were several men that really\r\nknew something about it! Now tell me another thing. How long do you\r\nteach a youth before you examine him, in your Universities?”\r\n\r\nI told him, three or four years.\r\n\r\n“Just so, just what _we_ did!” he exclaimed. “We taught ’em a bit, and,\r\njust as they were beginning to take it in, we took it all out again! We\r\npumped our wells dry before they were a quarter full—we stripped our\r\norchards while the apples were still in blossom—we applied the severe\r\nlogic of arithmetic to our chickens, while peacefully slumbering in\r\ntheir shells! Doubtless it’s the early bird that picks up the worm—but\r\nif the bird gets up so outrageously early that the worm is still deep\r\nunderground, what _then_ is its chance of a breakfast?”\r\n\r\nNot much, I admitted.\r\n\r\n“Now see how that works!” he went on eagerly. “If you want to pump your\r\nwells so soon—and I suppose you tell me that is what you _must_ do?”\r\n\r\n“We must,” I said. “In an over-crowded country like this, nothing but\r\nCompetitive Examinations——”\r\n\r\nMein Herr threw up his hands wildly. “What, _again_?” he cried. “I\r\nthought it was dead, fifty years ago! Oh this Upas tree of Competitive\r\nExaminations! Beneath whose deadly shade all the original genius, all\r\nthe exhaustive research, all the untiring life-long diligence by which\r\nour fore-fathers have so advanced human knowledge, must slowly but\r\nsurely wither away, and give place to a system of Cookery, in which the\r\nhuman mind is a sausage, and all we ask is, how much indigestible stuff\r\ncan be crammed into it!”\r\n\r\nAlways, after these bursts of eloquence, he seemed to forget himself for\r\na moment, and only to hold on to the thread of thought by some single\r\nword. “Yes, _crammed_,” he repeated. “We went through all that stage of\r\nthe disease—had it bad, I warrant you! Of course, as the Examination was\r\nall in all, we tried to put in just what was wanted—and the _great_\r\nthing to aim at was, that the Candidate should know absolutely _nothing_\r\nbeyond the needs of the Examination! I don’t say it was ever _quite_\r\nachieved: but one of my own pupils (pardon an old man’s egotism) came\r\nvery near it. After the Examination, he mentioned to me the few facts\r\nwhich he knew but had _not_ been able to bring in, and I can assure you\r\nthey were trivial, Sir, absolutely trivial!”\r\n\r\nI feebly expressed my surprise and delight.\r\n\r\nThe old man bowed, with a gratified smile, and proceeded. “At that time,\r\nno one had hit on the much more rational plan of watching for the\r\nindividual scintillations of genius, and rewarding them as they\r\noccurred. As it was, we made our unfortunate pupil into a Leyden-jar,\r\ncharged him up to the eyelids—then applied the knob of a Competitive\r\nExamination, and drew off one magnificent spark, which very often\r\ncracked the jar! What mattered _that_? We labeled it ‘First Class\r\nSpark,’ and put it away on the shelf.”\r\n\r\n“But the more rational system——?” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes! _that_ came next. Instead of giving the whole reward of\r\nlearning in one lump, we used to pay for every good answer as it\r\noccurred. How well I remember lecturing in those days, with a heap of\r\nsmall coins at my elbow! It was ‘A _very_ good answer, Mr. Jones!’ (that\r\nmeant a shilling, mostly). ‘Bravo, Mr. Robinson!’ (that meant\r\nhalf-a-crown). Now I’ll tell you how _that_ worked. Not one single fact\r\nwould any of them take in, without a fee! And when a clever boy came up\r\nfrom school, he got paid more for learning than we got paid for teaching\r\nhim! Then came the wildest craze of all.”\r\n\r\n“What, _another_ craze?” I said.\r\n\r\n“It’s the last one,” said the old man. “I must have tired you out with\r\nmy long story. Each College wanted to get the clever boys: so we adopted\r\na system which we had heard was very popular in England: the Colleges\r\ncompeted against each other, and the boys let themselves out to the\r\nhighest bidder! What geese we were! Why, they were bound to come to the\r\nUniversity _somehow_. We needn’t have paid ’em! And all our money went\r\nin getting clever boys to come to one College rather than another! The\r\ncompetition was so keen, that at last mere money-payments were not\r\nenough. Any College, that wished to secure some specially clever young\r\nman, had to waylay him at the Station, and hunt him through the streets.\r\nThe first who touched him was allowed to have him.”\r\n\r\n“That hunting-down of the scholars, as they arrived, must have been a\r\ncurious business,” I said. “Could you give me some idea of what it was\r\nlike?”\r\n\r\n“Willingly!” said the old man. “I will describe to you the very last\r\nHunt that took place, before that form of Sport (for it was actually\r\nreckoned among the _Sports_ of the day: we called it ‘Cub-Hunting’) was\r\nfinally abandoned. I witnessed it myself, as I happened to be passing by\r\nat the moment, and was what we called ‘in at the death.’ I can see it\r\nnow!” he went on in an excited tone, gazing into vacancy with those\r\nlarge dreamy eyes of his. “It seems like yesterday; and yet it\r\nhappened——” He checked himself hastily, and the remaining words died\r\naway into a whisper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOLAR-HUNTING: THE PURSUED]\r\n\r\n“_How_ many years ago did you say?” I asked, much interested in the\r\nprospect of at last learning _some_ definite fact in his history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOLAR-HUNTING: THE PURSUERS]\r\n\r\n“_Many_ years ago,” he replied. “The scene at the Railway-Station had\r\nbeen (so they told me) one of wild excitement. Eight or nine Heads of\r\nColleges had assembled at the gates (no one was allowed inside), and the\r\nStation-Master had drawn a line on the pavement, and insisted on their\r\nall standing behind it. The gates were flung open! The young man darted\r\nthrough them, and fled like lightning down the street, while the Heads\r\nof Colleges actually _yelled_ with excitement on catching sight of him!\r\nThe Proctor gave the word, in the old statutory form, ‘_Semel!_ _Bis!_\r\n_Ter!_ _Currite!_’, and the Hunt began! Oh, it was a fine sight, believe\r\nme! At the first corner he dropped his Greek Lexicon: further on, his\r\nrailway-rug: then various small articles: then his umbrella: lastly,\r\nwhat I suppose he prized most, his hand-bag: but the game was up: the\r\nspherical Principal of—of——”\r\n\r\n“Of _which_ College?” I said.\r\n\r\n“—of _one_ of the Colleges,” he resumed, “had put into operation the\r\nTheory—his own discovery—of Accelerated Velocity, and captured him just\r\nopposite to where I stood. I shall never forget that wild breathless\r\nstruggle! But it was soon over. Once in those great bony hands, escape\r\nwas impossible!”\r\n\r\n“May I ask why you speak of him as the ‘_spherical_’ Principal?” I said.\r\n\r\n“The epithet referred to his _shape_, which was a perfect _sphere_. You\r\nare aware that a bullet, another instance of a perfect sphere, when\r\nfalling in a perfectly straight line, moves with Accelerated Velocity?”\r\n\r\nI bowed assent.\r\n\r\n“Well, my spherical friend (as I am proud to call him) set himself to\r\ninvestigate the _causes_ of this. He found them to be _three_. One; that\r\nit is a perfect _sphere_. Two; that it moves in a _straight line_.\r\nThree; that its direction is _not upwards_. When these three conditions\r\nare fulfilled, you get Accelerated Velocity.”\r\n\r\n“Hardly,” I said: “if you will excuse my differing from you. Suppose we\r\napply the theory to _horizontal_ motion. If a bullet is fired\r\n_horizontally_, it——”\r\n\r\n“—it does _not_ move in a _straight line_,” he quietly finished my\r\nsentence for me.\r\n\r\n“I yield the point,” I said. “What did your friend do next?”\r\n\r\n“The next thing was to apply the theory, as you rightly suggest, to\r\n_horizontal_ motion. But the moving body, ever tending to _fall_, needs\r\n_constant support_, if it is to move in a true horizontal line. ‘What,\r\nthen,’ he asked himself, ‘will _give constant support to a moving\r\nbody_?’ And his answer was ‘_Human legs!_’ _That_ was the discovery that\r\nimmortalised his name!”\r\n\r\n“His name being——?” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“I had not mentioned it,” was the gentle reply of my most unsatisfactory\r\ninformant. “His next step was an obvious one. He took to a diet of\r\nsuet-dumplings, until his body had become a perfect sphere. _Then_ he\r\nwent out for his first experimental run—which nearly cost him his life!”\r\n\r\n“How was _that_?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see, he had no idea of the _tremendous_ new Force in Nature\r\nthat he was calling into play. He began too fast. In a very few minutes\r\nhe found himself moving at a hundred miles an hour! And, if he had not\r\nhad the presence of mind to charge into the middle of a haystack (which\r\nhe scattered to the four winds) there can be no doubt that he would have\r\nleft the Planet he belonged to, and gone right away into Space!”\r\n\r\n“And how came that to be the _last_ of the Cub-Hunts?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see, it led to a rather scandalous dispute between two of the\r\nColleges. _Another_ Principal had laid his hand on the young man, so\r\nnearly at the same moment as the _spherical_ one, that there was no\r\nknowing which had touched him first. The dispute got into print, and did\r\nus no credit, and, in short, Cub-Hunts came to an end. Now I’ll tell you\r\nwhat cured us of that wild craze of ours, the bidding against each\r\nother, for the clever scholars, just as if they were articles to be sold\r\nby auction! Just when the craze had reached its highest point, and when\r\none of the Colleges had actually advertised a Scholarship of one\r\nthousand pounds _per annum_, one of our tourists brought us the\r\nmanuscript of an old African legend—I happen to have a copy of it in my\r\npocket. Shall I translate it for you?”\r\n\r\n“Pray go on,” I said, though I felt I was getting _very_ sleepy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                          WHAT TOTTLES MEANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMein Herr unrolled the manuscript, but, to my great surprise, instead of\r\n_reading_ it, he began to _sing_ it, in a rich mellow voice that seemed\r\nto ring through the room.\r\n\r\n  “One thousand pounds per annuum\r\n  Is not so bad a figure, come!”\r\n  Cried Tottles. “And I tell you, flat,\r\n  A man may marry well on that!\r\n  To say ‘the Husband needs the Wife’\r\n  Is not the way to represent it.\r\n  The crowning joy of Woman’s life\r\n  Is _Man_!” said Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  The blissful Honey-moon is past:\r\n  The Pair have settled down at last:\r\n  Mamma-in-law their home will share,\r\n  And make their happiness her care.\r\n  “Your income is an ample one;\r\n  Go it, my children!” (And they went it).\r\n  “I rayther think this kind of fun\r\n  Won’t last!” said Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  They took a little country-box—\r\n  A box at Covent Garden also:\r\n  They lived a life of double-knocks,\r\n  Acquaintances began to call so:\r\n  Their London house was much the same\r\n  (It took three hundred, clear, to rent it):\r\n  “Life is a very jolly game!”\r\n  Cried happy Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  ‘Contented with a frugal lot’\r\n  (He always used that phrase at Gunter’s),\r\n  He bought a handy little yacht—\r\n  A dozen serviceable hunters—\r\n  The fishing of a Highland Loch—\r\n  A sailing-boat to circumvent it—\r\n  “The sounding of that Gaelic ‘och’\r\n  Beats _me_!” said Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\nHere, with one of those convulsive starts that wake one up in the very\r\nact of dropping off to sleep, I became conscious that the deep musical\r\ntones that thrilled me did _not_ belong to Mein Herr, but to the French\r\nCount. The old man was still conning the manuscript.\r\n\r\n“I _beg_ your pardon for keeping you waiting!” he said. “I was just\r\nmaking sure that I knew the English for all the words. I am quite ready\r\nnow.” And he read me the following Legend:—\r\n\r\n“In a city that stands in the very centre of Africa, and is rarely\r\nvisited by the casual tourist, the people had always bought eggs—a daily\r\nnecessary in a climate where egg-flip was the usual diet—from a Merchant\r\nwho came to their gates once a week. And the people always bid wildly\r\nagainst each other: so there was quite a lively auction every time the\r\nMerchant came, and the last egg in his basket used to fetch the value of\r\ntwo or three camels, or thereabouts. And eggs got dearer every week. And\r\nstill they drank their egg-flip, and wondered where all their money went\r\nto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EGG-MERCHANT]\r\n\r\n“And there came a day when they put their heads together. And they\r\nunderstood what donkeys they had been.\r\n\r\n“And next day, when the Merchant came, only _one_ Man went forth. And he\r\nsaid ‘Oh, thou of the hook-nose and the goggle-eyes, thou of the\r\nmeasureless beard, how much for that lot of eggs?’\r\n\r\n“And the Merchant answered him ‘I _could_ let thee have that lot at ten\r\nthousand piastres the dozen.’\r\n\r\n“And the Man chuckled inwardly, and said ‘_Ten_ piastres the dozen I\r\noffer thee, and no more, oh descendant of a distinguished grandfather!’\r\n\r\n“And the Merchant stroked his beard, and said ‘Hum! I will await the\r\ncoming of thy friends,’ So he waited. And the Man waited with him. And\r\nthey waited both together.”\r\n\r\n“The manuscript breaks off here,” said Mein Herr, as he rolled it up\r\nagain; “but it was enough to open our eyes. We saw what simpletons we\r\nhad been—buying our Scholars much as those ignorant savages bought their\r\neggs—and the ruinous system was abandoned. If only we could have\r\nabandoned, along with it, all the _other_ fashions we had borrowed from\r\nyou, instead of carrying them to their logical results! But it was not\r\nto be. What ruined my country, and drove me from my home, was the\r\nintroduction—into the _Army_, of all places—of your theory of Political\r\nDichotomy!”\r\n\r\n“Shall I trouble you too much,” I said, “if I ask you to explain what\r\nyou mean by ‘the Theory of Political Dichotomy’?”\r\n\r\n“No trouble at all!” was Mein Herr’s most courteous reply. “I quite\r\nenjoy talking, when I get so good a listener. What started the thing,\r\nwith us, was the report brought to us, by one of our most eminent\r\nstatesmen, who had stayed some time in England, of the way affairs were\r\nmanaged there. It was a political necessity (so he assured us, and we\r\nbelieved him, though we had never discovered it till that moment) that\r\nthere should be _two_ Parties, in every affair and on every subject. In\r\n_Politics_, the two Parties, which you had found it necessary to\r\ninstitute, were called, he told us, ‘Whigs’ and ‘Tories’.”\r\n\r\n“That must have been some time ago?” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“It _was_ some time ago,” he admitted. “And this was the way the affairs\r\nof the British Nation were managed. (You will correct me if I\r\nmisrepresent it. I do but repeat what our traveler told us.) These two\r\nParties—which were in chronic hostility to each other—took turns in\r\nconducting the Government; and the Party, that happened _not_ to be in\r\npower, was called the ‘Opposition’, I believe?”\r\n\r\n“That is the right name,” I said. “There have always been, so long as we\r\nhave had a Parliament at all, _two_ Parties, one ‘in’, and one ‘out’.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the function of the ‘Ins’ (if I may so call them) was to do the\r\nbest they could for the national welfare—in such things as making war or\r\npeace, commercial treaties, and so forth?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” I said.\r\n\r\n“And the function of the ‘Outs’ was (so our traveller assured us, though\r\nwe were very incredulous at first) to _prevent_ the ‘Ins’ from\r\nsucceeding in any of these things?”\r\n\r\n“To _criticize_ and to _amend_ their proceedings,” I corrected him. “It\r\nwould be _unpatriotic_ to _hinder_ the Government in doing what was for\r\nthe good of the Nation! We have always held a _Patriot_ to be the\r\ngreatest of heroes, and an _unpatriotic_ spirit to be one of the worst\r\nof human ills!”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me for a moment,” the old gentleman courteously replied, taking\r\nout his pocket-book. “I have a few memoranda here, of a correspondence I\r\nhad with our tourist, and, if you will allow me, I’ll just refresh my\r\nmemory—although I quite agree with you—it is, as you say, one of the\r\nworst of human ills—” And, here Mein Herr began singing again:—\r\n\r\n  But oh, the worst of human ills\r\n  (Poor Tottles found) are ‘little bills’!\r\n  And, with no balance in the Bank,\r\n  What wonder that his spirits sank?\r\n  Still, as the money flowed away,\r\n  He wondered how on earth she spent it.\r\n  “You cost me twenty pounds a day,\r\n  _At least_!” cried Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  She sighed. “Those Drawing Rooms, you know!\r\n  I really never thought about it:\r\n  Mamma declared we ought to go—\r\n  We should be Nobodies without it.\r\n  That diamond-circlet for my brow—\r\n  I quite believed that _she_ had sent it,\r\n  Until the Bill came in just now——”\r\n  “_Viper_!” cried Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  Poor Mrs. T. could bear no more,\r\n  But fainted flat upon the floor.\r\n  Mamma-in-law, with anguish wild,\r\n  Seeks, all in vain, to rouse her child.\r\n  “Quick! Take this box of smelling-salts!\r\n  Don’t scold her, James, or you’ll repent it,\r\n  She’s a _dear_ girl, with all her faults——”\r\n  “She _is_!” groaned Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\n  “I was a donkey,” Tottles cried,\r\n  “To choose your daughter for my bride!\r\n  ’Twas _you_ that bid us cut a dash!\r\n  ’Tis _you_ have brought us to this smash!\r\n  You don’t suggest one single thing\r\n  That can in any way prevent it——\r\n  Then what’s the use of arguing?\r\n  _Shut up!_” cried Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\nOnce more I started into wakefulness, and realised that Mein Herr was\r\nnot the singer. He was still consulting his memoranda.\r\n\r\n“It is exactly what my friend told me,” he resumed, after conning over\r\nvarious papers. “‘_Unpatriotic_’ is the very word I had used, in writing\r\nto him, and ‘_hinder_’ is the very word he used in his reply! Allow me\r\nto read you a portion of his letter:——\r\n\r\n  “‘_I can assure you_,’ he writes, ‘_that, unpatriotic as you may think\r\n  it, the recognised function of the ‘Opposition’ is to hinder, in every\r\n  manner not forbidden by the Law, the action of the Government. This\r\n  process is called ‘Legitimate Obstruction’: and the greatest triumph\r\n  the ‘Opposition’ can ever enjoy, is when they are able to point out\r\n  that, owing to their ‘Obstruction’, the Government have failed in\r\n  everything they have tried to do for the good of the Nation!_’”\r\n\r\n“Your friend has not put it _quite_ correctly,” I said. “The Opposition\r\nwould no doubt be glad to point out that the Government had failed\r\n_through their own fault_; but _not_ that they had failed on account of\r\n_Obstruction_!”\r\n\r\n“You think so?” he gently replied. “Allow me now to read to you this\r\nnewspaper-cutting, which my friend enclosed in his letter. It is part of\r\nthe report of a public speech, made by a Statesman who was at the time a\r\nmember of the ‘Opposition’:—\r\n\r\n  “‘_At the close of the Session, he thought they had no reason to be\r\n  discontented with the fortunes of the campaign. They had routed the\r\n  enemy at every point. But the pursuit must be continued. They had only\r\n  to follow up a disordered and dispirited foe._’”\r\n\r\n“Now to what portion of your national history would you guess that the\r\nspeaker was referring?”\r\n\r\n“Really, the number of _successful_ wars we have waged during the last\r\ncentury,” I replied, with a glow of British pride, “is _far_ too great\r\nfor me to guess, with any chance of success, _which_ it was we were then\r\nengaged in. However, I will name ‘_India_’ as the most probable. The\r\nMutiny was no doubt, all but crushed, at the time that speech was made.\r\nWhat a fine, manly, _patriotic_ speech it must have been!” I exclaimed\r\nin an outburst of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“You think so?” he replied, in a tone of gentle pity. “Yet my friend\r\ntells me that the ‘_disordered and dispirited foe_’ simply meant the\r\nStatesmen who happened to be in power at the moment; that the\r\n‘_pursuit_’ simply meant ‘Obstruction’; and that the words ‘_they had\r\nrouted the enemy_’ simply meant that the ‘Opposition’ had succeeded in\r\nhindering the Government from doing any of the work which the Nation had\r\nempowered them to do!”\r\n\r\nI thought it best to say nothing.\r\n\r\n“It seemed queer to _us_, just at first,” he resumed, after courteously\r\nwaiting a minute for me to speak: “but, when once we had mastered the\r\nidea, our respect for your Nation was so great that we carried it into\r\nevery department of life! It was ‘_the beginning of the end_’ with us.\r\nMy country never held up its head again!” And the poor old gentleman\r\nsighed deeply.\r\n\r\n“Let us change the subject,” I said. “Do not distress yourself, I beg!”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” he said, with an effort to recover himself. “I had rather\r\nfinish my story! The next step (after reducing our Government to\r\nimpotence, and putting a stop to all useful legislation, which did not\r\ntake us long to do) was to introduce what we called ‘the glorious\r\nBritish Principle of Dichotomy’ into _Agriculture_. We persuaded many of\r\nthe well-to-do farmers to divide their staff of labourers into two\r\nParties, and to set them one against the other. They were called, like\r\nour political Parties, the ‘Ins’ and the ‘Outs’: the business of the\r\n‘Ins’ was to do as much of ploughing, sowing, or whatever might be\r\nneeded, as they could manage in a day, and at night they were paid\r\naccording to the amount they had _done_: the business of the ‘Outs’ was\r\nto hinder them, and _they_ were paid for the amount they had _hindered_.\r\nThe farmers found they had to pay only _half_ as much wages as they did\r\nbefore, and they didn’t observe that the amount of work done was only a\r\n_quarter_ as much as was done before: so they took it up quite\r\nenthusiastically, _at first_.”\r\n\r\n“And _afterwards_——?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“Well, _afterwards_ they didn’t like it quite so well. In a very short\r\ntime, things settled down into a regular routine. No work _at all_ was\r\ndone. So the ‘Ins’ got no wages, and the ‘Outs’ got full pay. And the\r\nfarmers never discovered, till most of them were ruined, that the\r\nrascals had agreed to manage it so, and had shared the pay between them!\r\nWhile the thing lasted, there were funny sights to be seen! Why, I’ve\r\noften watched a ploughman, with two horses harnessed to the plough,\r\ndoing his best to get it _forwards_; while the opposition-ploughman,\r\nwith three donkeys harnessed at the _other_ end, was doing _his_ best to\r\nget it _backwards_! And the plough never moving an inch, _either_ way!”\r\n\r\n“But _we_ never did anything like _that_!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Simply because you were less _logical_ than we were,” replied Mein\r\nHerr. “There is _sometimes_ an advantage in being a donk—Excuse me! No\r\n_personal_ allusion intended. All this happened _long ago_, you know!”\r\n\r\n“Did the Dichotomy-Principle succeed in _any_ direction?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“In _none_,” Mein Herr candidly confessed. “It had a _very_ short trial\r\nin _Commerce_. The shop-keepers _wouldn’t_ take it up, after once trying\r\nthe plan of having half the attendants busy in folding up and carrying\r\naway the goods which the other half were trying to spread out upon the\r\ncounters. They said the Public didn’t like it!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t wonder at it,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“Well, we tried ‘the British Principle’ for some years. And the end of\r\nit all was—” His voice suddenly dropped, almost to a whisper; and large\r\ntears began to roll down his cheeks. “—the end was that we got involved\r\nin a war; and there was a great battle, in which we far out-numbered the\r\nenemy. But what could one expect, when only _half_ of our soldiers were\r\nfighting, and the other half pulling them back? It ended in a crushing\r\ndefeat—an utter rout. This caused a Revolution; and most of the\r\nGovernment were banished. I myself was accused of Treason, for having so\r\nstrongly advocated ‘the British Principle.’ My property was all\r\nforfeited, and—and—I was driven into exile! ‘Now the mischief’s done,’\r\nthey said, ‘perhaps you’ll kindly leave the country?’ It nearly broke my\r\nheart, but I had to go!”\r\n\r\nThe melancholy tone became a wail: the wail became a chant: the chant\r\nbecame a song—though whether it was _Mein Herr_ that was singing, this\r\ntime, or somebody else, I could not feel certain.\r\n\r\n  “And, now the mischief’s done, perhaps\r\n  You’ll kindly go and pack your traps?\r\n  Since _two_ (your daughter and your son)\r\n  Are Company, but _three_ are none.\r\n  A course of saving we’ll begin:\r\n  When change is needed, _I’ll_ invent it:\r\n  Don’t think to put _your_ finger in\r\n  _This_ pie!” cried Tottles (and he meant it).\r\n\r\nThe music seemed to die away. Mein Herr was again speaking in his\r\nordinary voice. “Now tell me one thing more,” he said. “Am I right in\r\nthinking that in _your_ Universities, though a man may reside some\r\nthirty or forty years, you examine him, once for all, at the end of the\r\nfirst three or four?”\r\n\r\n“That is so, undoubtedly,” I admitted.\r\n\r\n“Practically, then, you examine a man at the _beginning_ of his career!”\r\nthe old man said to himself rather than to me. “And what guarantee have\r\nyou that he _retains_ the knowledge for which you have rewarded\r\nhim—beforehand, as _we_ should say?”\r\n\r\n“None,” I admitted, feeling a little puzzled at the drift of his\r\nremarks. “How do _you_ secure that object?”\r\n\r\n“By examining him at the _end_ of his thirty or forty years—not at the\r\nbeginning,” he gently replied. “On an average, the knowledge then found\r\nis about one-fifth of what it was at first—the process of forgetting\r\ngoing on at a very steady uniform rate—and he, who forgets _least_, gets\r\n_most_ honour, and most rewards.”\r\n\r\n“Then you give him the money when he needs it no longer? And you make\r\nhim live most of his life on _nothing_!”\r\n\r\n“Hardly that. He gives his orders to the tradesmen: they supply him, for\r\nforty, sometimes fifty, years, at their own risk: then he gets his\r\nFellowship—which pays him in _one_ year as much as _your_ Fellowships\r\npay in fifty—and then he can easily pay all his bills, with interest.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose he fails to get his Fellowship? That must occasionally\r\nhappen.”\r\n\r\n“That occasionally happens.” It was Mein Herr’s turn, now, to make\r\nadmissions.\r\n\r\n“And what becomes of the tradesmen?”\r\n\r\n“They calculate accordingly. When a man appears to be getting alarmingly\r\nignorant, or stupid, they will sometimes refuse to supply him any\r\nlonger. You have no idea with what enthusiasm a man will begin to rub up\r\nhis forgotten sciences or languages, when his butcher has cut off the\r\nsupply of beef and mutton!”\r\n\r\n“And who are the Examiners?”\r\n\r\n“The young men who have just come, brimming over with knowledge. You\r\nwould think it a curious sight,” he went on, “to see mere boys examining\r\nsuch old men. I have known a man set to examine his own grandfather. It\r\nwas a little painful for both of them, no doubt. The old gentleman was\r\nas bald as a coot——”\r\n\r\n“How bald would that be?” I’ve no idea why I asked this question. I felt\r\nI was getting foolish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n                            BRUNO’S PICNIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n“As bald as bald,” was the bewildering reply. “Now, Bruno, I’ll tell you\r\na story.”\r\n\r\n“And I’ll tell _oo_ a story,” said Bruno, beginning in a great hurry for\r\nfear of Sylvie getting the start of him: “once there were a Mouse—a\r\nlittle tiny Mouse—such a tiny little Mouse! Oo never saw such a tiny\r\nMouse——”\r\n\r\n“Did nothing ever happen to it, Bruno?” I asked. “Haven’t you anything\r\nmore to tell us, besides its being so tiny?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing never happened to it,” Bruno solemnly replied.\r\n\r\n“Why did nothing never happen to it?” said Sylvie, who was sitting, with\r\nher head on Bruno’s shoulder, patiently waiting for a chance of\r\nbeginning _her_ story.\r\n\r\n“It were too tiny,” Bruno explained.\r\n\r\n“_That’s_ no reason!” I said. “However tiny it was, things might happen\r\nto it.”\r\n\r\nBruno looked pityingly at me, as if he thought me very stupid. “It were\r\ntoo tiny,” he repeated. “If anything happened to it, it would die—it\r\nwere so _very_ tiny!”\r\n\r\n“Really that’s enough about its being tiny!” Sylvie put in. “Haven’t you\r\ninvented any more about it?”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t invented no more yet.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, you shouldn’t begin a story till you’ve invented more! Now\r\nbe quiet, there’s a good boy, and listen to _my_ story.”\r\n\r\nAnd Bruno, having quite exhausted all his inventive faculty, by\r\nbeginning in too great a hurry, quietly resigned himself to listening.\r\n“Tell about the other Bruno, please,” he said coaxingly.\r\n\r\nSylvie put her arms round his neck, and began:——\r\n\r\n“The wind was whispering among the trees,” (“That wasn’t good manners!”\r\nBruno interrupted. “Never mind about manners,” said Sylvie) “and it was\r\nevening—a nice moony evening, and the Owls were hooting——”\r\n\r\n“Pretend they weren’t Owls!” Bruno pleaded, stroking her cheek with his\r\nfat little hand. “I don’t like Owls. Owls have such great big eyes.\r\nPretend they were Chickens!”\r\n\r\n“Are you afraid of their great big eyes, Bruno?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t _’fraid_ of nothing,” Bruno answered in as careless a tone as he\r\ncould manage: “they’re ugly with their great big eyes. I think if they\r\ncried, the tears would be as big—oh, as big as the moon!” And he laughed\r\nmerrily. “Doos Owls cry ever, Mister Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Owls cry never,” I said gravely, trying to copy Bruno’s way of\r\nspeaking: “they’ve got nothing to be sorry for, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but they have!” Bruno exclaimed. “They’re ever so sorry, ’cause\r\nthey killed the poor little Mouses!”\r\n\r\n“But they’re not sorry when they’re _hungry_, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Oo don’t know nothing about Owls!” Bruno scornfully remarked. “When\r\nthey’re hungry, they’re very, _very_ sorry they killed the little\r\nMouses, ’cause if they _hadn’t_ killed them there’d be sumfin for\r\nsupper, oo know!”\r\n\r\nBruno was evidently getting into a dangerously inventive state of mind,\r\nso Sylvie broke in with “Now I’m going on with the story. So the\r\nOwls—the Chickens, I mean—were looking to see if they could find a nice\r\nfat Mouse for their supper——”\r\n\r\n“Pretend it was a nice ’abbit!” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“But it _wasn’t_ a nice habit, to kill Mouses,” Sylvie argued. “I can’t\r\npretend _that_!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say ‘_habit_,’ oo silly fellow!” Bruno replied with a merry\r\ntwinkle in his eye. “’_abbits_—that runs about in the fields!”\r\n\r\n“Rabbit? Well it can be a Rabbit, if you like. But you mustn’t alter my\r\nstory so much, Bruno. A Chicken _couldn’t_ eat a Rabbit!”\r\n\r\n“But it might have wished to see if it could try to eat it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it wished to see if it could try—oh, really, Bruno, that’s\r\nnonsense! I shall go back to the Owls.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, pretend they hadn’t great eyes!”\r\n\r\n“And they saw a little Boy,” Sylvie went on, disdaining to make any\r\nfurther corrections. “And he asked them to tell him a story. And the\r\nOwls hooted and flew away——” (“Oo shouldn’t say ‘_flewed_;’ oo should\r\nsay ‘_flied_,’” Bruno whispered. But Sylvie wouldn’t hear.) “And he met\r\na Lion. And he asked the Lion to tell him a story. And the Lion said\r\n‘yes,’ it would. And, while the Lion was telling him the story, it\r\nnibbled some of his head off——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say ‘nibbled’!” Bruno entreated. “Only little things\r\nnibble—little thin sharp things, with edges——”\r\n\r\n“Well then, it ‘_nubbled_,’” said Sylvie. “And when it had nubbled _all_\r\nhis head off, he went away, and he never said ‘thank you’!”\r\n\r\n“That were very rude,” said Bruno. “If he couldn’t speak, he might have\r\nnodded—no, he couldn’t nod. Well, he might have shaked _hands_ with the\r\nLion!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’d forgotten that part!” said Sylvie. “He _did_ shake hands with\r\nit. He came back again, you know, and he thanked the Lion very much, for\r\ntelling him the story.”\r\n\r\n“Then his head had growed up again?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, it grew up in a minute. And the Lion begged pardon, and said it\r\nwouldn’t nubble off little boys’ heads—not never no more!”\r\n\r\nBruno looked much pleased at this change of events. “Now that are a\r\n_really_ nice story!” he said. “_Aren’t_ it a nice story, Mister Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Very,” I said. “I would like to hear another story about that Boy.”\r\n\r\n“So would _I_,” said Bruno, stroking Sylvie’s cheek again. “_Please_\r\ntell about Bruno’s Picnic; and don’t talk about _nubbly_ Lions!”\r\n\r\n“I won’t, if it frightens you,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“_Flightens_ me!” Bruno exclaimed indignantly. “It isn’t _that_! It’s\r\n’cause ‘nubbly’ ’s such a grumbly word to say—when one person’s got her\r\nhead on another person’s shoulder. When she talks like that,” he\r\nexplained to me, “the talking goes down bofe sides of my face—all the\r\nway to my chin—and it _doos_ tickle so! It’s enough to make a beard\r\ngrow, that it is!”\r\n\r\nHe said this with great severity, but it was evidently meant for a joke:\r\nso Sylvie laughed—a delicious musical little laugh, and laid her soft\r\ncheek on the top of her brother’s curly head, as if it were a pillow,\r\nwhile she went on with the story. “So this Boy——”\r\n\r\n“But it wasn’t _me_, oo know!” Bruno interrupted. “And oo needn’t try to\r\nlook as if it was, Mister Sir!”\r\n\r\nI represented, respectfully, that I was trying to look as if it wasn’t.\r\n\r\n“—he was a middling good Boy——”\r\n\r\n“He were a _welly_ good Boy!” Bruno corrected her. “And he never did\r\nnothing he wasn’t told to do——”\r\n\r\n“_That_ doesn’t make a good Boy!” Sylvie said contemptuously.\r\n\r\n“That _do_ make a good Boy!” Bruno insisted.\r\n\r\nSylvie gave up the point. “Well, he was a _very_ good Boy, and he always\r\nkept his promises, and he had a big cupboard——”\r\n\r\n“—for to keep all his promises in!” cried Bruno.\r\n\r\n“If he kept _all_ his promises,” Sylvie said, with a mischievous look in\r\nher eyes, “he wasn’t like _some_ Boys I know of!”\r\n\r\n“He had to put _salt_ with them, a-course,” Bruno said gravely: “oo\r\nca’n’t keep promises when there isn’t any salt. And he kept his birthday\r\non the second shelf.”\r\n\r\n“How long did he keep his birthday?” I asked. “I never can keep _mine_\r\nmore than twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\n“Why, a birthday _stays_ that long by itself!” cried Bruno. “Oo doosn’t\r\nknow how to keep birthdays! This Boy kept _his_ a whole year!”\r\n\r\n“And then the next birthday would begin,” said Sylvie. “So it would be\r\nhis birthday _always_.”\r\n\r\n“So it were,” said Bruno. “Doos _oo_ have treats on _oor_ birthday,\r\nMister Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” I said.\r\n\r\n“When oo’re _good_, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Why, it _is_ a sort of treat, being good, isn’t it?” I said.\r\n\r\n“A sort of _treat_!” Bruno repeated. “It’s a sort of _punishment_, _I_\r\nthink!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bruno!” Sylvie interrupted, almost sadly. “How _can_ you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, but it _is_,” Bruno persisted. “Why, look here, Mister Sir!\r\n_This_ is being good!” And he sat bolt upright, and put on an absurdly\r\nsolemn face. “First oo must sit up as straight as pokers——”\r\n\r\n“—as _a_ poker,” Sylvie corrected him.\r\n\r\n“—as straight as _pokers_,” Bruno firmly repeated. “Then oo must clasp\r\noor hands—_so_. Then—‘Why hasn’t oo brushed oor hair? Go and brush it\r\n_toreckly_!’ Then—‘Oh, Bruno, oo mustn’t dog’s-ear the daisies!’ Did oo\r\nlearn _oor_ spelling wiz daisies, Mister Sir?”\r\n\r\n“I want to hear about that Boy’s _Birthday_,” I said.\r\n\r\nBruno returned to the story instantly. “Well, so this Boy said ‘Now it’s\r\nmy Birthday!’ And so—I’m tired!” he suddenly broke off, laying his head\r\nin Sylvie’s lap. “Sylvie knows it best. Sylvie’s grown-upper than me. Go\r\non, Sylvie!”\r\n\r\nSylvie patiently took up the thread of the story again. “So he said ‘Now\r\nit’s my Birthday. Whatever shall I do to keep my Birthday? All _good_\r\nlittle Boys——” (Sylvie turned away from Bruno, and made a great pretence\r\nof whispering to _me_) “—all _good_ little Boys—Boys that learn their\r\nlessons quite perfect—they always keep their birthdays, you know. So of\r\ncourse _this_ little Boy kept _his_ Birthday.”\r\n\r\n“Oo may call him Bruno, if oo like,” the little fellow carelessly\r\nremarked. “It weren’t _me_, but it makes it more interesting.”\r\n\r\n“So Bruno said to himself ‘The properest thing to do is to have a\r\nPicnic, all by myself, on the top of the hill. And I’ll take some Milk,\r\nand some Bread, and some Apples: and first and foremost, I want some\r\n_Milk_!’ So, first and foremost, Bruno took a milk-pail——”\r\n\r\n“And he went and milkted the Cow!” Bruno put in.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sylvie, meekly accepting the new verb. “And the Cow said\r\n‘Moo! What are you going to do with all that Milk?’ And Bruno said\r\n‘Please’m, I want it for my Picnic.’ And the Cow said ‘Moo! But I hope\r\nyou wo’n’t _boil_ any of it?’ And Bruno said ‘No, _indeed_ I won’t! New\r\nMilk’s so nice and so warm, it wants no boiling!’”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t want no boiling,” Bruno offered as an amended version.\r\n\r\n“So Bruno put the Milk in a bottle. And then Bruno said ‘Now I want some\r\nBread!’ So he went to the Oven, and he took out a delicious new Loaf.\r\nAnd the Oven——”\r\n\r\n“—ever so light and so puffy!” Bruno impatiently corrected her. “Oo\r\nshouldn’t leave out so many words!”\r\n\r\nSylvie humbly apologised. “—a delicious new Loaf, ever so light and so\r\npuffy. And the Oven said——” Here Sylvie made a long pause. “Really I\r\ndon’t know _what_ an Oven begins with, when it wants to speak!”\r\n\r\nBoth children looked appealingly at me; but I could only say,\r\nhelplessly, “I haven’t the least idea! _I_ never heard an Oven speak!”\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two we all sat silent; and then Bruno said, very softly,\r\n“Oven begins wiz ‘O’.”\r\n\r\n“_Good_ little boy!” Sylvie exclaimed. “He does his spelling _very_\r\nnicely. _He’s cleverer than he knows!_” she added, aside, to _me_. “So\r\nthe Oven said ‘O! What are you going to do with all that Bread?’ And\r\nBruno said ‘Please——’ Is an Oven ‘Sir’ or ‘’m,’ would you say?” She\r\nlooked to me for a reply.\r\n\r\n“_Both_, I think,” seemed to me the safest thing to say.\r\n\r\nSylvie adopted the suggestion instantly. “So Bruno said ‘Please, Sirm, I\r\nwant it for my Picnic.’ And the Oven said ‘O! But I hope you wo’n’t\r\n_toast_ any of it?’ And Bruno said ‘No, _indeed_ I wo’n’t! New Bread’s\r\nso light and so puffy, it wants no toasting!’”\r\n\r\n“It never doesn’t want no toasting,” said Bruno. “I _wiss_ oo wouldn’t\r\nsay it so short!”\r\n\r\n“So Bruno put the Bread in the hamper. Then Bruno said ‘Now I want some\r\nApples!’ So he took the hamper, and he went to the Apple-Tree, and he\r\npicked some lovely ripe Apples. And the Apple-Tree said——” Here followed\r\nanother long pause.\r\n\r\nBruno adopted his favourite expedient of tapping his forehead; while\r\nSylvie gazed earnestly upwards, as if she hoped for some suggestion from\r\nthe birds, who were singing merrily among the branches overhead. But no\r\nresult followed.\r\n\r\n“What _does_ an Apple-tree begin with, when it wants to speak?” Sylvie\r\nmurmured despairingly, to the irresponsive birds.\r\n\r\nAt last, taking a leaf out of Bruno’s book, I ventured on a remark.\r\n“Doesn’t ‘Apple-tree’ always begin with ‘Eh!’?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of _course_ it does! How _clever_ of you!” Sylvie cried\r\ndelightedly.\r\n\r\nBruno jumped up, and patted me on the head. I tried not to feel\r\nconceited.\r\n\r\n“So the Apple Tree said ‘Eh! What are you going to do with all those\r\nApples?’ And Bruno said ‘Please, Sir, I want them for my Picnic,’ And\r\nthe Apple-Tree said ‘Eh! But I hope you wo’n’t _bake_ any of them?’ And\r\nBruno said ‘No, _indeed_ I wo’n’t! Ripe Apples are so nice and so sweet,\r\nthey want no baking!’”\r\n\r\n“They never doesn’t——” Bruno was beginning, but Sylvie corrected herself\r\nbefore he could get the words out.\r\n\r\n“‘They never doesn’t nonow want no baking.’ So Bruno put the Apples in\r\nthe hamper, along with the Bread, and the bottle of Milk. And he set off\r\nto have a Picnic, on the top of the hill, all by himself——”\r\n\r\n“He wasn’t greedy, oo know, to have it all by himself,” Bruno said,\r\npatting me on the cheek to call my attention; “’cause he hadn’t got no\r\nbrothers and sisters.”\r\n\r\n“It was very sad to have no _sisters_, wasn’t it?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know,” Bruno said thoughtfully; “’cause he hadn’t no\r\nlessons to do. So he didn’t mind.”\r\n\r\nSylvie went on. “So, as he was walking along the road, he heard behind\r\nhim such a curious sort of noise—a sort of a Thump! Thump! Thump!\r\n‘Whatever _is_ that?’ said Bruno. ‘Oh, I know!’ said Bruno. ‘Why, it’s\r\nonly my Watch a-ticking!’”\r\n\r\n“_Were_ it his Watch a-ticking?” Bruno asked me, with eyes that fairly\r\nsparkled with mischievous delight.\r\n\r\n“No doubt of it!” I replied. And Bruno laughed exultingly.\r\n\r\n“Then Bruno thought a little harder. And he said ‘No! It _ca’n’t_ be my\r\nWatch a-ticking; because I haven’t _got_ a Watch!’”\r\n\r\nBruno peered up anxiously into my face, to see how I took it. I hung my\r\nhead, and put a thumb into my mouth, to the evident delight of the\r\nlittle fellow.\r\n\r\n“So Bruno went a little further along the road. And then he heard it\r\nagain, that queer noise—Thump! Thump! Thump! ‘What ever _is_ that?’ said\r\nBruno. ‘Oh, I know!’ said Bruno. ‘Why, it’s only the Carpenter a-mending\r\nmy Wheelbarrow!’”\r\n\r\n“_Were_ it the Carterpenter a-mending his Wheelbarrow?” Bruno asked me.\r\n\r\nI brightened up, and said “It _must_ have been!” in a tone of absolute\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nBruno threw his arms round Sylvie’s neck. “Sylvie!” he said, in a\r\nperfectly audible whisper. “He says it _must_ have been!”\r\n\r\n“Then Bruno thought a little harder. And he said ‘No! It _ca’n’t_ be the\r\nCarpenter amending my Wheelbarrow, because I haven’t _got_ a\r\nWheelbarrow!’”\r\n\r\nThis time I hid my face in my hands, quite unable to meet Bruno’s look\r\nof triumph.\r\n\r\n“So Bruno went a little further along the road. And then he heard that\r\nqueer noise again—Thump! Thump! Thump! So he thought he’d look round,\r\n_this_ time, just to _see_ what it was. And what should it be but a\r\ngreat Lion!”\r\n\r\n“A great big Lion,” Bruno corrected her.\r\n\r\n“A great big Lion. And Bruno was ever so frightened, and he ran——”\r\n\r\n“No, he wasn’t _flightened_ a bit!” Bruno interrupted. (He was evidently\r\nanxious for the reputation of his namesake.) “He runned away to get a\r\ngood look at the Lion; ’cause he wanted to see if it were the same Lion\r\nwhat used to nubble little Boys’ heads off; and he wanted to know how\r\nbig it was!”\r\n\r\n“Well, he ran away, to get a good look at the Lion. And the Lion trotted\r\nslowly after him. And the Lion called after him, in a very gentle voice,\r\n‘Little Boy, little Boy! You needn’t be afraid of _me_! I’m a very\r\n_gentle_ old Lion now. I _never_ nubble little Boys’ heads off, as I\r\nused to do.’ And so Bruno said ‘Don’t you _really_, Sir? Then what do\r\nyou live on?’ And the Lion——”\r\n\r\n“Oo _see_ he weren’t a bit flightened!” Bruno said to me, patting my\r\ncheek again. “’cause he remembered to call it ‘Sir,’ oo know.”\r\n\r\nI said that no doubt that was the _real_ test whether a person was\r\nfrightened or not.\r\n\r\n“And the Lion said ‘Oh, I live on bread-and-butter, and cherries, and\r\nmarmalade, and plum-cake———’”\r\n\r\n“—and _apples_!” Bruno put in.\r\n\r\n“Yes, ‘and apples.’ And Bruno said ‘Won’t you come with me to my\r\nPicnic?’ And the Lion said ‘Oh, I should like it _very much indeed_!’\r\nAnd Bruno and the Lion went away together.” Sylvie stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Is that _all_?” I asked, despondingly.\r\n\r\n“Not _quite_ all,” Sylvie slily replied. “There’s a sentence or two\r\nmore. Isn’t there, Bruno?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” with a carelessness that was evidently put on: “just a sentence\r\nor two more.”\r\n\r\n“And, as they were walking along, they looked over a hedge, and who\r\nshould they see but a little black Lamb! And the Lamb was ever so\r\nfrightened. And it ran——”\r\n\r\n“It were _really_ flightened!” Bruno put in.\r\n\r\n“It ran away. And Bruno ran after it. And he called ‘Little Lamb! You\r\nneedn’t be afraid of _this_ Lion! It _never_ kills things! It lives on\r\ncherries, and marmalade——’”\r\n\r\n“—and _apples_!” said Bruno. “Oo _always_ forgets the apples!”\r\n\r\n“And Bruno said ‘Wo’n’t you come with us to my Picnic?’ And the Lamb\r\nsaid ‘Oh, I should like it _very much indeed_, if my Ma will let me!’\r\nAnd Bruno said ‘Let’s go and ask your Ma!’ And they went to the old\r\nSheep. And Bruno said ‘Please, may your little Lamb come to my Picnic?’\r\nAnd the Sheep said ‘Yes, if it’s learnt all its lessons.’ And the Lamb\r\nsaid ‘Oh yes, Ma! I’ve learnt _all_ my lessons!’”\r\n\r\n“Pretend it hadn’t any lessons!” Bruno earnestly pleaded.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that would never do!” said Sylvie. “I ca’n’t leave out all about\r\nthe lessons! And the old Sheep said ‘Do you know your A B C yet? Have\r\nyou learnt A?’ And the Lamb said ‘Oh yes, Ma! I went to the A-field, and\r\nI helped them to make A!’ ‘Very good, my child! And have you learnt B?’\r\n‘Oh yes, Ma! I went to the B-hive, and the B gave me some honey!’ ‘Very\r\ngood, my child! And have you learnt C?’ ‘Oh yes, Ma! I went to the\r\nC-side, and I saw the ships sailing on the C!’ ‘Very good, my child! You\r\nmay go to Bruno’s Picnic.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STARTING FOR BRUNO’S PICNIC]\r\n\r\n“So they set off. And Bruno walked in the middle, so that the Lamb\r\nmightn’t see the Lion——”\r\n\r\n“It were _flightened_,” Bruno explained.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and it trembled so; and it got paler and paler; and, before they’d\r\ngot to the top of the hill, it was a _white_ little Lamb—as white as\r\nsnow!”\r\n\r\n“But _Bruno_ weren’t flightened!” said the owner of that name. “So _he_\r\nstaid black!”\r\n\r\n“No, he _didn’t_ stay black! He staid _pink_!” laughed Sylvie. “I\r\nshouldn’t kiss you like this, you know, if you were _black_!”\r\n\r\n“Oo’d _have_ to!” Bruno said with great decision. “Besides, Bruno wasn’t\r\n_Bruno_, oo know—I mean, Bruno wasn’t _me_—I mean—don’t talk nonsense,\r\nSylvie!”\r\n\r\n“I won’t do it again!” Sylvie said very humbly. “And so, as they went\r\nalong, the Lion said ‘Oh, I’ll tell you what I used to do when I was a\r\nyoung Lion. I used to hide behind trees, to watch for little Boys.’”\r\n(Bruno cuddled a little closer to her.) “‘And, if a little thin scraggy\r\nBoy came by, why, I used to let him go. But, if a little fat juicy——’”\r\n\r\nBruno could bear no more. “Pretend he wasn’t juicy!” he pleaded,\r\nhalf-sobbing.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Bruno!” Sylvie briskly replied. “It’ll be done in a moment!\r\n‘—if a little fat juicy Boy came by, why, I used to spring out and\r\ngobble him up! Oh, you’ve no _idea_ what a delicious thing it is—a\r\nlittle juicy Boy!’ And Bruno said ‘Oh, if you please, Sir, _don’t_ talk\r\nabout eating little boys! It makes me so _shivery_!’”\r\n\r\nThe real Bruno shivered, in sympathy with the hero.\r\n\r\n“And the Lion said ‘Oh, well, we won’t talk about it, then! I’ll tell\r\nyou what happened on my wedding-day——’”\r\n\r\n“I like _this_ part better,” said Bruno, patting my cheek to keep me\r\nawake.\r\n\r\n“‘There was, oh, such a lovely wedding-breakfast! At _one_ end of the\r\ntable there was a large plum-pudding. And at the other end there was a\r\nnice roasted _Lamb_! Oh, you’ve no _idea_ what a delicious thing it is—a\r\nnice roasted Lamb!’ And the Lamb said ‘Oh, if you please, Sir, _don’t_\r\ntalk about eating Lambs! It makes me so _shivery_!’ And the Lion said\r\n‘Oh, well, we won’t talk about it, then!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n                           THE LITTLE FOXES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“So, when they got to the top of the hill, Bruno opened the hamper: and\r\nhe took out the Bread, and the Apples, and the Milk: and they ate, and\r\nthey drank. And when they’d finished the Milk, and eaten half the Bread\r\nand half the Apples, the Lamb said ‘Oh, my paws is so sticky! I want to\r\nwash my paws!’ And the Lion said ‘Well, go down the hill, and wash them\r\nin the brook, yonder. We’ll wait for you!’”\r\n\r\n“It never comed back!” Bruno solemnly whispered to me.\r\n\r\nBut Sylvie overheard him. “You’re not to whisper, Bruno! It spoils the\r\nstory! And when the Lamb had been gone a long time, the Lion said to\r\nBruno ‘Do go and see after that silly little Lamb! It must have lost its\r\nway.’ And Bruno went down the hill. And when he got to the brook, he saw\r\nthe Lamb sitting on the bank: and who should be sitting by it but an old\r\nFox!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t know who _should_ be sitting by it,” Bruno said thoughtfully to\r\nhimself. “A old Fox _were_ sitting by it.”\r\n\r\n“And the old Fox were saying,” Sylvie went on, for once conceding the\r\ngrammatical point, “‘Yes, my dear, you’ll be ever so happy with us, if\r\nyou’ll only come and see us! I’ve got three little Foxes there, and we\r\ndo love little Lambs so dearly!’ And the Lamb said ‘But you never _eat_\r\nthem, do you, Sir?’ And the Fox said ‘Oh, no! What, _eat_ a Lamb? We\r\nnever _dream_ of doing such a thing!’ So the Lamb said ‘Then I’ll come\r\nwith you.’ And off they went, hand in hand.”\r\n\r\n“That Fox were welly extremely wicked, _weren’t_ it?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“No, no!” said Sylvie, rather shocked at such violent language. “It\r\nwasn’t quite so bad as that!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I mean, it wasn’t nice,” the little fellow corrected himself.\r\n\r\n“And so Bruno went back to the Lion. ‘Oh, come quick!’ he said. ‘The Fox\r\nhas taken the Lamb to his house with him! I’m _sure_ he means to eat\r\nit!’ And the Lion said ‘I’ll come as quick as ever I can!’ And they\r\ntrotted down the hill.”\r\n\r\n“Do oo think he caught the Fox, Mister Sir?” said Bruno. I shook my\r\nhead, not liking to speak: and Sylvie went on.\r\n\r\n“And when they got to the house, Bruno looked in at the window. And\r\nthere he saw the three little Foxes sitting round the table, with their\r\nclean pinafores on, and spoons in their hands——”\r\n\r\n“Spoons in their hands!” Bruno repeated in an ecstasy of delight.\r\n\r\n“And the Fox had got a great big knife—all ready to kill the poor little\r\nLamb——” (“Oo needn’t be flightened, Mister Sir!” Bruno put in, in a\r\nhasty whisper.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘ENTER THE LION’]\r\n\r\n“And just as he was going to do it, Bruno heard a great ROAR——” (The\r\nreal Bruno put his hand into mine, and held tight), “and the Lion came\r\n_bang_ through the door, and the next moment it had bitten off the old\r\nFox’s head! And Bruno jumped in at the window, and went leaping round\r\nthe room, and crying out ‘Hooray! Hooray! The old Fox is dead! The old\r\nFox is dead!’”\r\n\r\nBruno got up in some excitement. “May I do it now?” he enquired.\r\n\r\nSylvie was quite decided on this point. “Wait till afterwards,” she\r\nsaid. “The speeches come next, don’t you know? You always love the\r\nspeeches, _don’t_ you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I doos,” said Bruno: and sat down again.\r\n\r\n“The Lion’s speech. ‘Now, you silly little Lamb, go home to your mother,\r\nand never listen to old Foxes again. And be very good and obedient.’\r\n\r\n“The Lamb’s speech. ‘Oh, indeed, Sir, I will, Sir!’ and the Lamb went\r\naway.” (“But _oo_ needn’t go away!” Bruno explained. “It’s quite the\r\nnicest part—what’s coming now!” Sylvie smiled. She liked having an\r\nappreciative audience.)\r\n\r\n“The Lion’s speech to Bruno. ‘Now, Bruno, take those little Foxes home\r\nwith you, and teach them to be good obedient little Foxes! Not like that\r\nwicked old thing there, that’s got no head!’” (“That hasn’t got no\r\nhead,” Bruno repeated.)\r\n\r\n“Bruno’s speech to the Lion. ‘Oh, indeed, Sir, I will, Sir!’ And the\r\nLion went away.” (“It gets betterer and betterer, now,” Bruno whispered\r\nto me, “right away to the end!”)\r\n\r\n“Bruno’s speech to the little Foxes. ‘Now, little Foxes, you’re going to\r\nhave your first lesson in being good. I’m going to put you into the\r\nhamper, along with the Apples and the Bread: and you’re not to eat the\r\nApples: and you’re not to eat the Bread: and you’re not to eat\r\n_anything_——till we get to my house: and then you’ll have your supper.’\r\n\r\n“The little Foxes’ speech to Bruno. The little Foxes said nothing.\r\n\r\n“So Bruno put the Apples into the hamper—and the little Foxes—and the\r\nBread——” (“They had picnicked all the Milk,” Bruno explained in a\r\nwhisper) “—and he set off to go to his house.” (“We’re getting near the\r\nend now,” said Bruno.)\r\n\r\n“And, when he had got a little way, he thought he would look into the\r\nhamper, and see how the little Foxes were getting on.”\r\n\r\n“So he opened the door——” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bruno!” Sylvie exclaimed, “_you’re_ not telling the story! So he\r\nopened the door, and behold, there were no Apples! So Bruno said ‘Eldest\r\nlittle Fox, have _you_ been eating the Apples?’ And the eldest little\r\nFox said ‘No no no!’” (It is impossible to give the tone in which Sylvie\r\nrepeated this rapid little ‘No no no!’ The nearest I can come to it is\r\nto say that it was much as if a young and excited duck had tried to\r\nquack the words. It was too quick for a quack, and yet too harsh to be\r\nanything else.) “Then he said ‘Second little Fox, have _you_ been eating\r\nthe Apples?’ And the second little Fox said ‘No no no!’ Then he said\r\n‘Youngest little Fox, have _you_ been eating the Apples?’ And the\r\nyoungest little Fox _tried_ to say ‘No no no!’ but its mouth was so\r\nfull, it couldn’t, and it only said ‘Wauch! Wauch! Wauch!’ And Bruno\r\nlooked into its mouth. And its mouth was full of Apples! And Bruno shook\r\nhis head, and he said ‘Oh dear, oh dear! What bad creatures these Foxes\r\nare!’”\r\n\r\nBruno was listening intently: and, when Sylvie paused to take breath, he\r\ncould only just gasp out the words “About the Bread?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sylvie, “the Bread comes next. So he shut the door again;\r\nand he went a little further; and then he thought he’d just peep in once\r\nmore. And behold, there was no Bread!” (“What do ‘behold’ _mean_?” said\r\nBruno. “Hush!” said Sylvie.) “And he said ‘Eldest little Fox, have _you_\r\nbeen eating the Bread?’ And the eldest little Fox said ‘No no no!’\r\n‘Second little Fox, have _you_ been eating the Bread?’ And the second\r\nlittle Fox only said ‘Wauch! Wauch! Wauch!’ And Bruno looked into its\r\nmouth, and its mouth was full of Bread!” (“It might have chokeded it,”\r\nsaid Bruno.) “So he said ‘Oh dear, oh dear! What _shall_ I do with these\r\nFoxes?’ And he went a little further.” (“Now comes the most interesting\r\npart,” Bruno whispered.)\r\n\r\n“And when Bruno opened the hamper again, what do you think he saw?”\r\n(“Only _two_ Foxes!” Bruno cried in a great hurry.) “You shouldn’t tell\r\nit so quick. However, he _did_ see only _two_ Foxes. And he said ‘Eldest\r\nlittle Fox, have you been eating the youngest little Fox?’ And the\r\neldest little Fox said ‘No no no!’ ‘Second little Fox, have _you_ been\r\neating the youngest little Fox?’ And the second little Fox did its very\r\nbest to say ‘No no no!’ but it could only say ‘Weuchk! Weuchk! Weuchk!’\r\nAnd when Bruno looked into its mouth, it was half full of Bread, and\r\nhalf full of Fox!” (Bruno said nothing in the pause this time. He was\r\nbeginning to pant a little, as he knew the crisis was coming.)\r\n\r\n“And when he’d got nearly home, he looked once more into the hamper, and\r\nhe saw——”\r\n\r\n“Only——” Bruno began, but a generous thought struck him, and he looked\r\nat me. “_Oo_ may say it, _this_ time, Mister Sir!” he whispered. It was\r\na noble offer, but I wouldn’t rob him of the treat. “Go on, Bruno,” I\r\nsaid, “you say it much the best.” “Only—but—_one_—Fox!” Bruno said with\r\ngreat solemnity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘WHIHUAUCH! WHIHUAUCH!’]\r\n\r\n“‘Eldest little Fox,’” Sylvie said, dropping the narrative-form in her\r\neagerness, “‘you’ve been _so_ good that I can hardly believe _you’ve_\r\nbeen disobedient: but I’m _afraid_ you’ve been eating your little\r\nsister?’ And the eldest little Fox said ‘Whihuauch! Whihuauch!’ and then\r\nit choked. And Bruno looked into its mouth, and it _was_ full!” (Sylvie\r\npaused to take breath, and Bruno lay back among the daisies, and looked\r\nat me triumphantly. “Isn’t it _grand_, Mister Sir?” said he. I tried\r\nhard to assume a critical tone. “It’s grand,” I said: “but it frightens\r\none so!” “Oo may sit a little closer to _me_, if oo like,” said Bruno.)\r\n\r\n“And so Bruno went home: and took the hamper into the kitchen, and\r\nopened it. And he saw——” Sylvie looked at _me_, this time, as if she\r\nthought I had been rather neglected and ought to be allowed _one_ guess,\r\nat any rate.\r\n\r\n“He ca’n’t guess!” Bruno cried eagerly. “I ’fraid I _must_ tell him!\r\nThere weren’t—_nuffin_ in the hamper!” I shivered in terror, and Bruno\r\nclapped his hands with delight. “He _is_ flightened, Sylvie! Tell the\r\nrest!”\r\n\r\n“So Bruno said ‘Eldest little Fox, have you been eating _yourself_, you\r\nwicked little Fox?’ And the eldest little Fox said ‘Whihuauch!’ And then\r\nBruno saw there was only its _mouth_ in the hamper! So he took the\r\nmouth, and he opened it, and shook, and shook! And at last he shook the\r\nlittle Fox out of its own mouth! And then he said ‘Open your mouth\r\nagain, you wicked little thing!’ And he shook, and shook! And he shook\r\nout the second little Fox! And he said ‘Now open _your_ mouth!’ And he\r\nshook, and shook! And he shook out the youngest little Fox, and all the\r\nApples, and all the Bread!\r\n\r\n“And then Bruno stood the little Foxes up against the wall: and he made\r\nthem a little speech. ‘Now, little Foxes, you’ve begun very wickedly—and\r\nyou’ll have to be punished. First you’ll go up to the nursery, and wash\r\nyour faces, and put on clean pinafores. Then you’ll hear the bell ring\r\nfor supper. Then you’ll come down: and _you won’t have any supper_: but\r\nyou’ll have a good _whipping_! Then you’ll go to bed. Then in the\r\nmorning you’ll hear the bell ring for breakfast. _But you won’t have any\r\nbreakfast!_ You’ll have a good _whipping_! Then you’ll have your\r\nlessons. And, perhaps, if you’re _very_ good, when dinner-time comes,\r\nyou’ll have a little dinner, and no more whipping!’” (“How _very_ kind\r\nhe was!” I whispered to Bruno. “_Middling_ kind,” Bruno corrected me\r\ngravely.)\r\n\r\n“So the little Foxes ran up to the nursery. And soon Bruno went into the\r\nhall, and rang the big bell. ‘Tingle, tingle, tingle! Supper, supper,\r\nsupper!’ Down came the little Foxes, in such a hurry for their supper!\r\nClean pinafores! Spoons in their hands! And, when they got into the\r\ndining-room, there was ever such a white table-cloth on the table! But\r\nthere was nothing on it but a big whip. And they had _such_ a whipping!”\r\n(I put my handkerchief to my eyes, and Bruno hastily climbed upon my\r\nknee and stroked my face. “Only _one_ more whipping, Mister Sir!” he\r\nwhispered. “Don’t cry more than oo ca’n’t help!”)\r\n\r\n“And the next morning early, Bruno rang the big bell again. ‘Tingle,\r\ntingle, tingle! Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!’ Down came the little\r\nFoxes! Clean pinafores! Spoons in their hands! No breakfast! Only the\r\nbig whip! Then came lessons,” Sylvie hurried on, for I still had my\r\nhandkerchief to my eyes. “And the little Foxes were ever so good! And\r\nthey learned their lessons backwards, and forwards, and upside-down. And\r\nat last Bruno rang the big bell again. ‘Tingle, tingle, tingle! Dinner,\r\ndinner, dinner!’ And when the little Foxes came down——” (“Had they clean\r\npinafores on?” Bruno enquired. “Of course!” said Sylvie. “And spoons?”\r\n“Why, you _know_ they had!” “Couldn’t be _certain_,” said Bruno.) “—they\r\ncame as slow as slow! And they said ‘Oh! There’ll be no dinner! There’ll\r\nonly be the big whip!’ But, when they got into the room, they saw the\r\nmost _lovely_ dinner!” (“Buns?” cried Bruno, clapping his hands.) “Buns,\r\nand cake, and——” (“—and jam?” said Bruno.) “Yes, jam—and soup—and——”\r\n(“—and _sugar plums_!” Bruno put in once more; and Sylvie seemed\r\nsatisfied.)\r\n\r\n“And ever after that, they _were_ such good little Foxes! They did their\r\nlessons as good as gold—and they never did what Bruno told them not\r\nto—and they never ate each other any more—and _they never ate\r\nthemselves_!”\r\n\r\nThe story came to an end so suddenly, it almost took my breath away;\r\nhowever I did my best to make a pretty speech of thanks. “I’m sure it’s\r\nvery—very—very much so, I’m sure!” I seemed to hear myself say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n                          BEYOND THESE VOICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I didn’t quite catch what you said!” were the next words that reached\r\nmy ear, but certainly _not_ in the voice either of Sylvie or of Bruno,\r\nwhom I could just see, through the crowd of guests, standing by the\r\npiano, and listening to the Count’s song. Mein Herr was the speaker. “I\r\ndidn’t quite catch what you said!” he repeated. “But I’ve no doubt you\r\ntake _my_ view of it. Thank you _very_ much for your kind attention.\r\nThere is only but _one_ verse left to be sung!” These last words were\r\nnot in the gentle voice of Mein Herr, but in the deep bass of the French\r\nCount. And, in the silence that followed, the final stanza of ‘Tottles’\r\nrang through the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘NEVER!’ YELLED TOTTLES]\r\n\r\n  See now this couple settled down\r\n  In quiet lodgings, out of town:\r\n  Submissively the tearful wife\r\n  Accepts a plain and humble life:\r\n  Yet begs one boon on bended knee:\r\n  ‘My ducky-darling, don’t resent it!\r\n  Mamma might come for two or three——’\r\n  ‘NEVER!’ yelled Tottles. And he meant it.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the song was followed by quite a chorus of thanks and\r\ncompliments from all parts of the room, which the gratified singer\r\nresponded to by bowing low in all directions. “It is to me a great\r\nprivilege,” he said to Lady Muriel, “to have met with this so marvellous\r\na song. The accompaniment to him is so strange, so mysterious: it is as\r\nif a new music were to be invented! I will play him once again so as\r\nthat to show you what I mean.” He returned to the piano, but the song\r\nhad vanished.\r\n\r\nThe bewildered singer searched through the heap of music lying on an\r\nadjoining table, but it was not there, either. Lady Muriel helped in the\r\nsearch: others soon joined: the excitement grew. “What _can_ have become\r\nof it?” exclaimed Lady Muriel. Nobody knew: one thing only was certain,\r\nthat no one had been near the piano since the Count had sung the last\r\nverse of the song.\r\n\r\n“Nevare mind him!” he said, most good-naturedly. “I shall give it you\r\nwith memory alone!” He sat down, and began vaguely fingering the notes;\r\nbut nothing resembling the tune came out. Then he, too, grew excited.\r\n“But what oddness! How much of singularity! That I might lose, not the\r\nwords alone, but the tune also—that is quite curious, I suppose?”\r\n\r\nWe all supposed it, heartily.\r\n\r\n“It was that sweet little boy, who found it for me,” the Count\r\nsuggested. “Quite perhaps _he_ is the thief?”\r\n\r\n“Of course he is!” cried Lady Muriel. “Bruno! Where are you, my\r\ndarling?”\r\n\r\nBut no Bruno replied: it seemed that the two children had vanished as\r\nsuddenly, and as mysteriously, as the song.\r\n\r\n“They are playing us a trick!” Lady Muriel gaily exclaimed. “This is\r\nonly an _ex tempore_ game of Hide-and-Seek! That little Bruno is an\r\nembodied Mischief!”\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was a welcome one to most of us, for some of the guests\r\nwere beginning to look decidedly uneasy. A general search was set on\r\nfoot with much enthusiasm: curtains were thrown back and shaken,\r\ncupboards opened, and ottomans turned over; but the number of possible\r\nhiding-places proved to be strictly limited; and the search came to an\r\nend almost as soon as it had begun.\r\n\r\n“They must have run out, while we were wrapped up in the song,” Lady\r\nMuriel said, addressing herself to the Count, who seemed more agitated\r\nthan the others; “and no doubt they’ve found their way back to the\r\nhousekeeper’s room.”\r\n\r\n“Not by _this_ door!” was the earnest protest of a knot of two or three\r\ngentlemen, who had been grouped round the door (one of them actually\r\nleaning against it) for the last half-hour, as they declared. “_This_\r\ndoor has not been opened since the song began!”\r\n\r\nAn uncomfortable silence followed this announcement. Lady Muriel\r\nventured no further conjectures, but quietly examined the fastenings of\r\nthe windows, which opened as doors. They all proved to be well fastened,\r\n_inside_.\r\n\r\nNot yet at the end of her resources, Lady Muriel rang the bell. “Ask the\r\nhousekeeper to step here,” she said, “and to bring the children’s\r\nwalking-things with her.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve brought them, my Lady,” said the obsequious housekeeper, entering\r\nafter another minute of silence. “I thought the young lady would have\r\ncome to my room to put on her boots. Here’s your boots, my love!” she\r\nadded cheerfully, looking in all directions for the children. There was\r\nno answer, and she turned to Lady Muriel with a puzzled smile. “Have the\r\nlittle darlings hid themselves?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see them, just now,” Lady Muriel replied, rather evasively.\r\n“You can leave their things here, Wilson. _I’ll_ dress them, when\r\nthey’re ready to go.”\r\n\r\nThe two little hats, and Sylvie’s walking-jacket, were handed round\r\namong the ladies, with many exclamations of delight. There certainly was\r\na sort of witchery of beauty about them. Even the little boots did not\r\nmiss their share of favorable criticism. “Such natty little things!” the\r\nmusical young lady exclaimed, almost fondling them as she spoke. “And\r\nwhat tiny tiny feet they must have!”\r\n\r\nFinally, the things were piled together on the centre-ottoman, and the\r\nguests, despairing of seeing the children again, began to wish\r\ngood-night and leave the house.\r\n\r\nThere were only some eight or nine left—to whom the Count was\r\nexplaining, for the twentieth time, how he had had his eye on the\r\nchildren during the last verse of the song; how he had then glanced\r\nround the room, to see what effect “de great chest-note” had had upon\r\nhis audience; and how, when he looked back again, they had both\r\ndisappeared—when exclamations of dismay began to be heard on all sides,\r\nthe Count hastily bringing his story to an end to join in the outcry.\r\n\r\nThe walking-things had all disappeared!\r\n\r\nAfter the utter failure of the search for the _children_, there was a\r\nvery half-hearted search made for their _apparel_. The remaining guests\r\nseemed only too glad to get away, leaving only the Count and our four\r\nselves.\r\n\r\nThe Count sank into an easy-chair, and panted a little.\r\n\r\n“Who then _are_ these dear children, I pray you?” he said. “Why come\r\nthey, why go they, in this so little ordinary a fashion? That the music\r\nshould make itself to vanish—that the hats, the boots, should make\r\nthemselves to vanish—how is it, I pray you?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no idea where they are!” was all I could say, on finding myself\r\nappealed to, by general consent, for an explanation.\r\n\r\nThe Count seemed about to ask further questions, but checked himself.\r\n\r\n“The hour makes himself to become late,” he said. “I wish to you a very\r\ngood night, my Lady. I betake myself to my bed—to dream—if that indeed I\r\nbe not dreaming now!” And he hastily left the room.\r\n\r\n“Stay awhile, stay awhile!” said the Earl, as I was about to follow the\r\nCount. “_You_ are not a guest, you know! Arthur’s friend is at _home_\r\nhere!”\r\n\r\n“Thanks!” I said, as, with true English instincts, we drew our chairs\r\ntogether round the fire-place, though no fire was burning—Lady Muriel\r\nhaving taken the heap of music on her knee, to have one more search for\r\nthe strangely-vanished song.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you sometimes feel a wild longing,” she said, addressing herself\r\nto me, “to have something more to do with your hands, while you talk,\r\nthan just holding a cigar, and now and then knocking off the ash? Oh, I\r\nknow all that you’re going to say!” (This was to Arthur, who appeared\r\nabout to interrupt her.) “The Majesty of Thought supersedes the work of\r\nthe fingers. A Man’s severe thinking, _plus_ the shaking-off a\r\ncigar-ash, comes to the same total as a Woman’s trivial fancies, _plus_\r\nthe most elaborate embroidery. _That’s_ your sentiment, isn’t it, only\r\nbetter expressed?”\r\n\r\nArthur looked into the radiant, mischievous face, with a grave and very\r\ntender smile. “Yes,” he said resignedly: “that is my sentiment,\r\nexactly.”\r\n\r\n“Rest of body, and activity of mind,” I put in. “Some writer tells us\r\n_that_ is the acme of human happiness.”\r\n\r\n“Plenty of _bodily_ rest, at any rate!” Lady Muriel replied, glancing at\r\nthe three recumbent figures around her. “But what you call activity of\r\n_mind_——”\r\n\r\n“—is the privilege of young Physicians _only_,” said the Earl. “We old\r\nmen have no claim to be active! _What can an old man do but die?_”\r\n\r\n“A good many other things, I should _hope_,” Arthur said earnestly.\r\n\r\n“Well, maybe. Still you have the advantage of me in many ways, dear boy!\r\nNot only that _your_ day is dawning while _mine_ is setting, but your\r\n_interest_ in Life—somehow I ca’n’t help envying you _that_. It will be\r\nmany a year before you lose your hold of _that_.”\r\n\r\n“Yet surely many human interests _survive_ human Life?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Many do, no doubt. And _some_ forms of Science; but only _some_, I\r\nthink. Mathematics, for instance: _that_ seems to possess an endless\r\ninterest: one ca’n’t imagine _any_ form of Life, or _any_ race of\r\nintelligent beings, where Mathematical truth would lose its meaning. But\r\nI fear _Medicine_ stands on a different footing. Suppose you discover a\r\nremedy for some disease hitherto supposed to be incurable. Well, it is\r\ndelightful for the moment, no doubt—full of interest—perhaps it brings\r\nyou fame and fortune. But what then? Look on, a few years, into a life\r\nwhere disease has no existence. What is your discovery worth, _then_?\r\nMilton makes Jove promise too much. ‘_Of so much fame in heaven expect\r\nthy meed._’ Poor comfort, when one’s ‘fame’ concerns matters that will\r\nhave ceased to have a meaning!”\r\n\r\n“At any rate, one wouldn’t care to make any _fresh_ medical\r\ndiscoveries,” said Arthur. “I see no help for _that_—though I shall be\r\nsorry to give up my favorite studies. Still, medicine, disease, pain,\r\nsorrow, sin—I fear they’re all linked together. Banish sin, and you\r\nbanish them all!”\r\n\r\n“_Military_ science is a yet stronger instance,” said the Earl. “Without\r\nsin, _war_ would surely be impossible. Still any mind, that has had in\r\nthis life any keen interest, not in _itself_ sinful, will surely find\r\nitself _some_ congenial line of work hereafter. Wellington may have no\r\nmore _battles_ to fight—and yet—\r\n\r\n  ‘We doubt not that, for one so true,\r\n  There must be other, nobler work to do,\r\n  Than when he fought at Waterloo,\r\n        And Victor he must ever be!’”\r\n\r\nHe lingered over the beautiful words, as if he loved them: and his\r\nvoice, like distant music, died away into silence.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two he began again. “If I’m not wearying you, I would\r\nlike to tell you an idea of the future Life which has haunted me for\r\nyears, like a sort of waking nightmare—I ca’n’t reason myself out of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Pray do,” Arthur and I replied, almost in a breath. Lady Muriel put\r\naside the heap of music, and folded her hands together.\r\n\r\n“The one idea,” the Earl resumed, “that has seemed to me to overshadow\r\nall the rest, is that of _Eternity_—involving, as it seems to do, the\r\nnecessary _exhaustion_ of all subjects of human interest. Take Pure\r\nMathematics, for instance—a Science independent of our present\r\nsurroundings. I have studied it, myself, a little. Take the subject of\r\ncircles and ellipses—what we call ‘curves of the second degree.’ In a\r\nfuture Life, it would only be a question of so many years (or _hundreds_\r\nof years, if you like), for a man to work out _all_ their properties.\r\nThen he _might_ go to curves of the third degree. Say _that_ took ten\r\ntimes as long (you see we have _unlimited_ time to deal with). I can\r\nhardly imagine his _interest_ in the subject holding out even for those;\r\nand, though there is no limit to the _degree_ of the curves he might\r\nstudy, yet surely the time, needed to exhaust _all_ the novelty and\r\ninterest of the subject, would be absolutely _finite_? And so of all\r\nother branches of Science. And, when I transport myself, in thought,\r\nthrough some thousands or millions of years, and fancy myself possessed\r\nof as much Science as one created reason can carry, I ask myself ‘What\r\nthen? With nothing more to learn, can one rest content on _knowledge_,\r\nfor the eternity yet to be lived through?’ It has been a very wearying\r\nthought to me. I have sometimes fancied one _might_, in that event, say\r\n‘It is better _not_ to be,’ and pray for personal _annihilation_—the\r\nNirvana of the Buddhists.”\r\n\r\n“But that is only half the picture,” I said. “Besides working for\r\n_oneself_, may there not be the helping of _others_?”\r\n\r\n“Surely, surely!” Lady Muriel exclaimed in a tone of relief, looking at\r\nher father with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Earl, “so long as there _were_ any others needing help.\r\nBut, given ages and ages more, surely all created reasons would at\r\nlength reach the same dead level of _satiety_. And _then_ what is there\r\nto look forward to?”\r\n\r\n“I know that weary feeling,” said the young Doctor. “I have gone through\r\nit all, more than once. Now let me tell you how I have put it to myself.\r\nI have imagined a little child, playing with toys on his nursery-floor,\r\nand yet able to _reason_, and to look on, thirty years ahead. Might he\r\nnot say to himself ‘By that time I shall have had enough of bricks and\r\nninepins. How weary Life will be!’ Yet, if we look forward through those\r\nthirty years, we find him a great statesman, full of interests and joys\r\nfar more intense than his baby-life could give—joys wholly inconceivable\r\nto his baby-mind—joys such as no baby-language could in the faintest\r\ndegree describe. Now, may not our life, a million years hence, have the\r\nsame relation, to our life now, that the man’s life has to the child’s?\r\nAnd, just as one might try, all in vain, to express to that child, in\r\nthe language of bricks and ninepins, the meaning of ‘politics,’ so\r\nperhaps all those descriptions of Heaven, with its music, and its\r\nfeasts, and its streets of gold, may be only attempts to describe, in\r\n_our_ words, things for which we _really_ have no words at all. Don’t\r\nyou think that, in _your_ picture of another life, you are in fact\r\ntransplanting that child into political life, without making any\r\nallowance for his growing up?”\r\n\r\n“I think I understand you,” said the Earl. “The music of Heaven _may_ be\r\nsomething beyond our powers of thought. Yet the music of Earth is sweet!\r\nMuriel, my child, sing us something before we go to bed!”\r\n\r\n“Do,” said Arthur, as he rose and lit the candles on the cottage-piano,\r\nlately banished from the drawing-room to make room for a ‘semi-grand.’\r\n“There is a song here, that I have never heard you sing.\r\n\r\n  ‘Hail to thee, blithe spirit!\r\n    Bird thou never wert,\r\n  That from Heaven, or near it,\r\n    Pourest thy full heart!’”\r\n\r\nhe read from the page he had spread open before her.\r\n\r\n“And our little life here,” the Earl went on, “is, to that grand time,\r\nlike a child’s summer-day! One gets tired as night draws on,” he added,\r\nwith a touch of sadness in his voice, “and one gets to long for bed! For\r\nthose welcome words ‘Come, child, ’tis bed-time!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n                             TO THE RESCUE!\r\n\r\n\r\n“It _isn’t_ bed-time!” said a sleepy little voice. “The owls hasn’t gone\r\nto bed, and I s’a’n’t go to seep wizout oo sings to me!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bruno!” cried Sylvie. “Don’t you know the owls have only just got\r\nup? But the _frogs_ have gone to bed, ages ago.”\r\n\r\n“Well, _I_ aren’t a frog,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“What shall I sing?” said Sylvie, skilfully avoiding the argument.\r\n\r\n“Ask Mister Sir,” Bruno lazily replied, clasping his hands behind his\r\ncurly head, and lying back on his fern-leaf, till it almost bent over\r\nwith his weight. “This aren’t a comfable leaf, Sylvie. Find me a\r\ncomfabler—please!” he added, as an after-thought, in obedience to a\r\nwarning finger held up by Sylvie. “I doosn’t like being feet-upwards!”\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty sight to see—the motherly way in which the fairy-child\r\ngathered up her little brother in her arms, and laid him on a stronger\r\nleaf. She gave it just a touch to set it rocking, and it went on\r\nvigorously by itself, as if it contained some hidden machinery. It\r\ncertainly wasn’t the wind, for the evening-breeze had quite died away\r\nagain, and not a leaf was stirring over our heads.\r\n\r\n“Why does that one leaf rock so, without the others?” I asked Sylvie.\r\nShe only smiled sweetly and shook her head. “I don’t know _why_,” she\r\nsaid. “It always does, if it’s got a fairy-child on it. It _has_ to, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“And can people see the leaf rock, who ca’n’t see the Fairy on it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course!” cried Sylvie. “A leaf’s a leaf, and everybody can see\r\nit; but Bruno’s Bruno, and they ca’n’t see _him_, unless they’re eerie,\r\nlike you.”\r\n\r\nThen I understood how it was that one sometimes sees—going through the\r\nwoods in a still evening—one fern-leaf rocking steadily on, all by\r\nitself. Haven’t you ever seen that? Try if you can see the fairy-sleeper\r\non it, next time; but don’t _pick_ the leaf, whatever you do; let the\r\nlittle one sleep on!\r\n\r\nBut all this time Bruno was getting sleepier and sleepier. “Sing, sing!”\r\nhe murmured fretfully. Sylvie looked to me for instructions. “What shall\r\nit be?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Could you sing him the nursery-song you once told me of?” I suggested.\r\n“The one that had been put through the mind-mangle, you know. ‘_The\r\nlittle man that had a little gun_,’ I think it was.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that are one of the _Professor’s_ songs!” cried Bruno. “I likes\r\nthe little man; and I likes the way they spinned him——like a\r\nteetle-totle-tum.” And he turned a loving look on the gentle old man who\r\nwas sitting at the other side of his leaf-bed, and who instantly began\r\nto sing, accompanying himself on his Outlandish guitar, while the snail,\r\non which he sat, waved its horns in time to the music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRUNO’S BED-TIME]\r\n\r\n  In stature the Manlet was dwarfish——\r\n    No burly big Blunderbore he:\r\n  And he wearily gazed on the crawfish\r\n    His Wifelet had dressed for his tea.\r\n  “Now reach me, sweet Atom, my gunlet,\r\n    And hurl the old shoelet for luck:\r\n  Let me hie to the bank of the runlet,\r\n              And shoot thee a Duck!”\r\n\r\n  She has reached him his minikin gunlet:\r\n    She has hurled the old shoelet for luck:\r\n  She is busily baking a bunlet,\r\n    To welcome him home with his Duck.\r\n  On he speeds, never wasting a wordlet,\r\n    Though thoughtlets cling, closely as wax,\r\n  To the spot where the beautiful birdlet\r\n                So quietly quacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘LONG CEREMONIOUS CALLS’]\r\n\r\n  Where the Lobsterlet lurks, and the Crablet\r\n    So slowly and sleepily crawls:\r\n  Where the Dolphin’s at home, and the Dablet\r\n    Pays long ceremonious calls:\r\n  Where the Grublet is sought by the Froglet:\r\n    Where the Frog is pursued by the Duck:\r\n  Where the Ducklet is chased by the Doglet——\r\n              So runs the world’s luck!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VOICES]\r\n\r\n  He has loaded with bullet and powder:\r\n    His footfall is noiseless as air:\r\n  But the Voices grow louder and louder,\r\n    And bellow, and bluster, and blare.\r\n  They bristle before him and after,\r\n    They flutter above and below,\r\n  Shrill shriekings of lubberly laughter,\r\n                Weird wailings of woe!\r\n\r\n  They echo without him, within him:\r\n    They thrill through his whiskers and beard:\r\n  Like a teetotum seeming to spin him,\r\n    With sneers never hitherto sneered.\r\n  “Avengement,” they cry, “on our Foelet!\r\n    Let the Manikin weep for our wrongs!\r\n  Let us drench him, from toplet to toelet,\r\n              With Nursery-Songs!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘HIS SOUL SHALL BE SAD FOR THE SPIDER’]\r\n\r\n  “He shall muse upon ‘Hey!

What was it all about,\r\nnow?” she demanded imperiously.\r\n\r\n“Something about a duck?” I hazarded. “Well, a bird of some kind?” I\r\ncorrected myself, perceiving at once that _that_ guess was wrong, at any\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n“_Something about a bird of some kind!_” Lady Muriel repeated, with as\r\nmuch withering scorn as her sweet face was capable of conveying. “And\r\nthat’s the way he speaks of Shelley’s Sky-Lark, is it? When the Poet\r\nparticularly says ‘_Hail to thee, blithe spirit!_ Bird _thou never\r\nwert_!’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORDS OF THE CREATION]\r\n\r\nShe led the way to the smoking-room, where, ignoring all the usages of\r\nSociety and all the instincts of Chivalry, the three Lords of the\r\nCreation reposed at their ease in low rocking-chairs, and permitted the\r\none lady who was present to glide gracefully about among us, supplying\r\nour wants in the form of cooling drinks, cigarettes, and lights. Nay, it\r\nwas only _one_ of the three who had the chivalry to go beyond the\r\ncommon-place “thank you,” and to quote the Poet’s exquisite description\r\nof how Geraint, when waited on by Enid, was moved\r\n\r\n  “To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb\r\n  That crossed the platter as she laid it down,”\r\n\r\nand to suit the action to the word—an audacious liberty for which, I\r\nfeel bound to report, he was _not_ duly reprimanded.\r\n\r\nAs no topic of conversation seemed to occur to any one, and as we were,\r\nall four, on those delightful terms with one another (the only terms, I\r\nthink, on which any friendship, that deserves the name of _intimacy_,\r\ncan be maintained) which involve no sort of necessity for _speaking_ for\r\nmere speaking’s sake, we sat in silence for some minutes.\r\n\r\nAt length I broke the silence by asking “Is there any fresh news from\r\nthe harbour about the Fever?”\r\n\r\n“None since this morning,” the Earl said, looking very grave. “But that\r\nwas alarming enough. The Fever is spreading fast: the London doctor has\r\ntaken fright and left the place, and the only one now available isn’t a\r\nregular doctor at all: he is apothecary, and doctor, and dentist, and I\r\ndon’t know what other trades, all in one. It’s a bad outlook for those\r\npoor fishermen—and a worse one for all the women and children.”\r\n\r\n“How many are there of them altogether?” Arthur asked.\r\n\r\n“There were nearly one hundred, a week ago.” said the Earl: “but there\r\nhave been twenty or thirty deaths since then.”\r\n\r\n“And what religious ministrations are there to be had?”\r\n\r\n“There are three brave men down there,” the Earl replied, his voice\r\ntrembling with emotion, “gallant heroes as ever won the Victoria Cross!\r\nI am certain that no one of the three will ever leave the place merely\r\nto save his own life. There’s the Curate: his wife is with him: they\r\nhave no children. Then there’s the Roman Catholic Priest. And there’s\r\nthe Wesleyan Minister. They go amongst their own flocks, mostly; but I’m\r\ntold that those who are dying like to have _any_ of the three with them.\r\nHow slight the barriers seem to be that part Christian from Christian,\r\nwhen one has to deal with the great facts of Life and the reality of\r\nDeath!”\r\n\r\n“So it must be, and so it should be——” Arthur was beginning, when the\r\nfront-door bell rang, suddenly and violently.\r\n\r\nWe heard the front-door hastily opened, and voices outside: then a knock\r\nat the door of the smoking-room, and the old house-keeper appeared,\r\nlooking a little scared.\r\n\r\n“Two persons, my Lord, to speak with Dr. Forester.”\r\n\r\nArthur stepped outside at once, and we heard his cheery “Well, my men?”\r\nbut the answer was less audible, the only words I could distinctly catch\r\nbeing “ten since morning, and two more just——”\r\n\r\n“But there _is_ a doctor there?” we heard Arthur say: and a deep voice,\r\nthat we had not heard before, replied “Dead, Sir. Died three hours ago.”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel shuddered, and hid her face in her hands: but at this moment\r\nthe front-door was quietly closed, and we heard no more.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes we sat quite silent: then the Earl left the room, and\r\nsoon returned to tell us that Arthur had gone away with the two\r\nfishermen, leaving word that he would be back in about an hour. And,\r\ntrue enough, at the end of that interval—during which very little was\r\nsaid, none of us seeming to have the heart to talk—the front-door once\r\nmore creaked on its rusty hinges, and a step was heard in the passage,\r\nhardly to be recognised as Arthur’s, so slow and uncertain was it, like\r\na blind man feeling his way.\r\n\r\nHe came in, and stood before Lady Muriel, resting one hand heavily on\r\nthe table, and with a strange look in his eyes, as if he were walking in\r\nhis sleep.\r\n\r\n“Muriel—my love——” he paused, and his lips quivered: but after a minute\r\nhe went on more steadily. “Muriel—my darling—they—_want_ me—down in the\r\nharbour.”\r\n\r\n“_Must_ you go?” she pleaded, rising and laying her hands on his\r\nshoulders, and looking up into his face with her great eyes brimming\r\nover with tears. “Must _you_ go, Arthur? It may mean—death!”\r\n\r\nHe met her gaze without flinching. “It _does_ mean death,” he said, in a\r\nhusky whisper: “but—darling—I am _called_. And even my life itself——”\r\nHis voice failed him, and he said no more.\r\n\r\nFor a minute she stood quite silent, looking upwards with a helpless\r\ngaze, as if even prayer were now useless, while her features worked and\r\nquivered with the great agony she was enduring. Then a sudden\r\ninspiration seemed to come upon her and light up her face with a strange\r\nsweet smile. “_Your_ life?” she repeated. “It is not _yours_ to give!”\r\n\r\nArthur had recovered himself by this time, and could reply quite firmly,\r\n“That is true,” he said. “It is not _mine_ to give. It is _yours_, now,\r\nmy—wife that is to be! And you—do _you_ forbid me to go? Will you not\r\nspare me, my own beloved one?”\r\n\r\nStill clinging to him, she laid her head softly on his breast. She had\r\nnever done such a thing in my presence before, and I knew how deeply she\r\nmust be moved. “I _will_ spare you,” she said, calmly and quietly, “to\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\n“And to God’s poor,” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“And to God’s poor,” she added. “When must it be, sweet love?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘WILL YOU NOT SPARE ME?’]\r\n\r\n“To-morrow morning,” he replied. “And I have much to do before then.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he told us how he had spent his hour of absence. He had been to\r\nthe Vicarage, and had arranged for the wedding to take place at eight\r\nthe next morning (there was no legal obstacle, as he had, some time\r\nbefore this, obtained a Special License) in the little church we knew so\r\nwell. “My old friend here,” indicating me, “will act as ‘Best Man,’ I\r\nknow: your father will be there to give you away: and—and—you will\r\ndispense with bride’s-maids, my darling?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded: no words came.\r\n\r\n“And then I can go with a willing heart—to do God’s work—knowing that we\r\nare _one_—and that we are together in _spirit_, though not in bodily\r\npresence—and are most of all together when we pray! Our _prayers_ will\r\ngo up together——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes!” sobbed Lady Muriel. “But you must not stay longer now, my\r\ndarling! Go home and take some rest. You will need all your strength\r\nto-morrow——”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will go,” said Arthur. “We will be here in good time to-morrow.\r\nGood night, my own own darling!”\r\n\r\nI followed his example, and we two left the house together. As we walked\r\nback to our lodgings, Arthur sighed deeply once or twice, and seemed\r\nabout to speak—but no words came, till we had entered the house, and had\r\nlit our candles, and were at our bedroom-doors. Then Arthur said “Good\r\nnight, old fellow! God bless you!”\r\n\r\n“God bless you!” I echoed, from the very depths of my heart.\r\n\r\nWe were back again at the Hall by eight in the morning, and found Lady\r\nMuriel and the Earl, and the old Vicar, waiting for us. It was a\r\nstrangely sad and silent party that walked up to the little church and\r\nback; and I could not help feeling that it was much more like a funeral\r\nthan a wedding: to Lady Muriel it _was_ in fact, a funeral rather than a\r\nwedding, so heavily did the presentiment weigh upon her (as she told us\r\nafterwards) that her newly-won husband was going forth to his death.\r\n\r\nThen we had breakfast; and, all too soon, the vehicle was at the door,\r\nwhich was to convey Arthur, first to his lodgings, to pick up the things\r\nhe was taking with him, and then as far towards the death-stricken\r\nhamlet as it was considered safe to go. One or two of the fishermen were\r\nto meet him on the road, to carry his things the rest of the way.\r\n\r\n“And are you quite sure you are taking all that you will need?” Lady\r\nMuriel asked.\r\n\r\n“All that I shall need as a _doctor_, certainly. And my own personal\r\nneeds are few: I shall not even take any of my own wardrobe—there is a\r\nfisherman’s suit, ready-made, that is waiting for me at my lodgings. I\r\nshall only take my watch, and a few books, and—stay—there _is_ one book\r\nI should like to add, a pocket-Testament—to use at the bedsides of the\r\nsick and dying——”\r\n\r\n“Take mine!” said Lady Muriel: and she ran upstairs to fetch it. “It has\r\nnothing written in it but ‘Muriel,’” she said as she returned with it:\r\n“shall I inscribe——”\r\n\r\n“No, my own one,” said Arthur, taking it from her. “What _could_ you\r\ninscribe better than that? Could any human name mark it more clearly as\r\nmy own individual property? Are _you_ not mine? Are you not,” (with all\r\nthe old playfulness of manner) “as Bruno would say, ‘my _very mine_’?”\r\n\r\nHe bade a long and loving adieu to the Earl and to me, and left the\r\nroom, accompanied only by his wife, who was bearing up bravely, and\r\nwas—_outwardly_, at least—less overcome than her old father. We waited\r\nin the room a minute or two, till the sound of wheels had told us that\r\nArthur had driven away; and even then we waited still, for the step of\r\nLady Muriel, going upstairs to her room, to die away in the distance.\r\nHer step, usually so light and joyous, now sounded slow and weary, like\r\none who plods on under a load of hopeless misery; and I felt almost as\r\nhopeless, and almost as wretched, as she. “Are we four destined _ever_\r\nto meet again, on this side the grave?” I asked myself, as I walked to\r\nmy home. And the tolling of a distant bell seemed to answer me, “No! No!\r\nNo!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n                          A NEWSPAPER-CUTTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _EXTRACT FROM THE “FAYFIELD CHRONICLE.”_\r\n\r\n_Our readers will have followed with painful interest, the accounts we\r\nhave from time to time published of the terrible epidemic which has,\r\nduring the last two months, carried off most of the inhabitants of the\r\nlittle fishing-harbour adjoining the village of Elveston. The last\r\nsurvivors, numbering twenty-three only, out of a population which, three\r\nshort months ago, exceeded one hundred and twenty, were removed on\r\nWednesday last, under the authority of the Local Board, and safely\r\nlodged in the County Hospital: and the place is now veritably ‘a city of\r\nthe dead,’ without a single human voice to break its silence._\r\n\r\n_The rescuing party consisted of six sturdy fellows—fishermen from the\r\nneighbourhood—directed by the resident Physician of the Hospital, who\r\ncame over for that purpose, heading a train of hospital-ambulances. The\r\nsix men had been selected—from a much larger number who had volunteered\r\nfor this peaceful ‘forlorn hope’—for their strength and robust health,\r\nas the expedition was considered to be, even now, when the malady has\r\nexpended its chief force, not unattended with danger._\r\n\r\n_Every precaution that science could suggest, against the risk of\r\ninfection, was adopted: and the sufferers were tenderly carried on\r\nlitters, one by one, up the steep hill, and placed in the ambulances\r\nwhich, each provided with a hospital nurse, were waiting on the level\r\nroad. The fifteen miles, to the Hospital, were done at a walking-pace,\r\nas some of the patients were in too prostrate a condition to bear\r\njolting, and the journey occupied the whole afternoon._\r\n\r\n_The twenty-three patients consist of nine men, six women, and eight\r\nchildren. It has not been found possible to identify them all, as some\r\nof the children—left with no surviving relatives—are infants; and two\r\nmen and one woman are not yet able to make rational replies, the\r\nbrain-powers being entirely in abeyance. Among a more well-to-do-race,\r\nthere would no doubt have been names marked on the clothes; but here no\r\nsuch evidence is forthcoming._\r\n\r\n_Besides the poor fishermen and their families, there were but five\r\npersons to be accounted for: and it was ascertained, beyond a doubt,\r\nthat all five are numbered with the dead. It is a melancholy pleasure to\r\nplace on record the names of these genuine martyrs—than whom none,\r\nsurely, are more worthy to be entered on the glory-roll of England’s\r\nheroes! They are as follows:—_\r\n\r\n_The Rev. James Burgess, M.A., and Emma his wife. He was the Curate at\r\nthe Harbour, not thirty years old, and had been married only two years.\r\nA written record was found in their house, of the dates of their\r\ndeaths._\r\n\r\n_Next to theirs we will place the honoured name of Dr. Arthur Forester,\r\nwho, on the death of the local physician, nobly faced the imminent peril\r\nof death, rather than leave these poor folk uncared for in their last\r\nextremity. No record of his name, or of the date of his death, was\r\nfound: but the corpse was easily identified, although dressed in the\r\nordinary fisherman’s suit (which he was known to have adopted when he\r\nwent down there), by a copy of the New Testament, the gift of his wife,\r\nwhich was found, placed next his heart, with his hands crossed over it.\r\nIt was not thought prudent to remove the body, for burial elsewhere: and\r\naccordingly it was at once committed to the ground, along with four\r\nothers found in different houses, with all due reverence. His wife,\r\nwhose maiden name was Lady Muriel Orme, had been married to him on the\r\nvery morning on which he undertook his self-sacrificing mission._\r\n\r\n_Next we record the Rev. Walter Saunders, Wesleyan Minister. His death\r\nis believed to have taken place two or three weeks ago, as the words\r\n‘Died October 5’ were found written on the wall of the room which he is\r\nknown to have occupied—the house being shut up, and apparently not\r\nhaving been entered for some time._\r\n\r\n_Last—though not a whit behind the other four in glorious self-denial\r\nand devotion to duty—let us record the name of Father Francis, a young\r\nJesuit Priest who had been only a few months in the place. He had not\r\nbeen dead many hours when the exploring party came upon the body, which\r\nwas identified, beyond the possibility of doubt, by the dress, and by\r\nthe crucifix which was, like the young Doctor’s Testament, clasped\r\nclosely to his heart._\r\n\r\n_Since reaching the hospital, two of the men and one of the children\r\nhave died. Hope is entertained for all the others: though there are two\r\nor three cases where the vital powers seem to be so entirely exhausted\r\nthat it is but ‘hoping against hope’ to regard ultimate recovery as even\r\npossible._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n                             A FAIRY-DUET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year—what an eventful year it had been for me!—was drawing to a\r\nclose, and the brief wintry day hardly gave light enough to recognise\r\nthe old familiar objects, bound up with so many happy memories, as the\r\ntrain glided round the last bend into the station, and the hoarse cry of\r\n“Elveston! Elveston!” resounded along the platform.\r\n\r\nIt was sad to return to the place, and to feel that I should never again\r\nsee the glad smile of welcome, that had awaited me here so few months\r\nago. “And yet, if I were to find him here,” I muttered, as in solitary\r\nstate I followed the porter, who was wheeling my luggage on a barrow,\r\n“and if he _were_ to ‘_strike a sudden hand in mine, And ask a thousand\r\nthings of home_,’ I should not—no, ‘_I should not feel it to be\r\nstrange_’!”\r\n\r\nHaving given directions to have my luggage taken to my old lodgings, I\r\nstrolled off alone, to pay a visit, before settling down in my own\r\nquarters, to my dear old friends—for such I indeed felt them to be,\r\nthough it was barely half a year since first we met—the Earl and his\r\nwidowed daughter.\r\n\r\nThe shortest way, as I well remembered, was to cross through the\r\nchurchyard. I pushed open the little wicket-gate and slowly took my way\r\namong the solemn memorials of the quiet dead, thinking of the many who\r\nhad, during the past year, disappeared from the place, and had gone to\r\n‘join the majority.’ A very few steps brought me in sight of the object\r\nof my search. Lady Muriel, dressed in the deepest mourning, her face\r\nhidden by a long crape veil, was kneeling before a little marble cross,\r\nround which she was fastening a wreath of flowers.\r\n\r\nThe cross stood on a piece of level turf, unbroken by any mound, and I\r\nknew that it was simply a memorial-cross, for one whose dust reposed\r\nelsewhere, even before reading the simple inscription:—\r\n\r\n                         _In loving Memory of_\r\n                         ARTHUR FORESTER, M.D.\r\n              _whose mortal remains lie buried by the sea:\r\n             whose spirit has returned to God who gave it_.\r\n\r\n               _“Greater love hath no man than this, that\r\n               a man lay down his life for his friends.”_\r\n\r\nShe threw back her veil on seeing me approach, and came forwards to meet\r\nme, with a quiet smile, and far more self-possessed than I could have\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n“It is quite like old times, seeing _you_ here again!” she said, in\r\ntones of genuine pleasure. “Have you been to see my father?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said: “I was on my way there, and came through here as the\r\nshortest way. I hope he is well, and you also?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, we are both quite well. And you? Are you any better yet?”\r\n\r\n“Not much better, I fear: but no worse, I am thankful to say.”\r\n\r\n“Let us sit here awhile, and have a quiet chat,” she said. The\r\ncalmness—almost indifference—of her manner quite took me by surprise. I\r\nlittle guessed what a fierce restraint she was putting upon herself.\r\n\r\n“One can be so quiet here,” she resumed. “I come here every—every day.”\r\n\r\n“It is very peaceful,” I said.\r\n\r\n“You got my letter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I delayed writing. It is so hard to say—on _paper_—”\r\n\r\n“I know. It was kind of you. You were with us when we saw the last of——”\r\nShe paused a moment, and went on more hurriedly. “I went down to the\r\nharbour several times, but no one knows which of those vast graves it\r\nis. However, they showed me the house he died in: that was some comfort.\r\nI stood in the very room where—where——.” She struggled in vain to go on.\r\nThe flood-gates had given way at last, and the outburst of grief was the\r\nmost terrible I had ever witnessed. Totally regardless of my presence,\r\nshe flung herself down on the turf, burying her face in the grass, and\r\nwith her hands clasped round the little marble cross, “Oh, my darling,\r\nmy darling!” she sobbed. “And God meant your life to be so beautiful!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE CHURCH-YARD]\r\n\r\nI was startled to hear, thus repeated by Lady Muriel, the very words of\r\nthe darling child whom I had seen weeping so bitterly over the dead\r\nhare. Had some mysterious influence passed, from that sweet\r\nfairy-spirit, ere she went back to Fairyland, into the human spirit that\r\nloved her so dearly? The idea seemed too wild for belief. And yet, are\r\nthere not ‘_more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our\r\nphilosophy_’?\r\n\r\n“God _meant_ it to be beautiful,” I whispered, “and surely it _was_\r\nbeautiful? God’s purpose never fails!” I dared say no more, but rose and\r\nleft her. At the entrance-gate to the Earl’s house I waited, leaning on\r\nthe gate and watching the sun set, revolving many memories—some happy,\r\nsome sorrowful—until Lady Muriel joined me.\r\n\r\nShe was quite calm again now. “Do come in,” she said. “My father will be\r\nso pleased to see you!”\r\n\r\nThe old man rose from his chair, with a smile, to welcome me; but his\r\nself-command was far less than his daughter’s, and the tears coursed\r\ndown his face as he grasped both my hands in his, and pressed them\r\nwarmly.\r\n\r\nMy heart was too full to speak; and we all sat silent for a minute or\r\ntwo. Then Lady Muriel rang the bell for tea. “You _do_ take five o’clock\r\ntea, I know!” she said to me, with the sweet playfulness of manner I\r\nremembered so well, “even though you _ca’n’t_ work your wicked will on\r\nthe Law of Gravity, and make the teacups descend into Infinite Space, a\r\nlittle faster than the tea!”\r\n\r\nThis remark gave the tone to our conversation. By a tacit mutual\r\nconsent, we avoided, during this our first meeting after her great\r\nsorrow, the painful topics that filled our thoughts, and talked like\r\nlight-hearted children who had never known a care.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever ask yourself the question,” Lady Muriel began, _à propos_\r\nof nothing, “what is the _chief_ advantage of being a Man instead of a\r\nDog?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” I said: “but I think there are advantages on the _Dog’s_\r\nside of the question, as well.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” she replied, with that pretty mock-gravity that became her\r\nso well: “but, on _Man’s_ side, the chief advantage seems to me to\r\nconsist in _having pockets_! It was borne in upon me—upon _us_, I should\r\nsay; for my father and I were returning from a walk—only yesterday. We\r\nmet a dog carrying home a bone. What it wanted it for, I’ve no idea:\r\ncertainly there was no _meat_ on it——”\r\n\r\nA strange sensation came over me, that I had heard all this, or\r\nsomething exactly like it, before: and I almost expected her next words\r\nto be “perhaps he meant to make a cloak for the winter?” However what\r\nshe really said was “and my father tried to account for it by some\r\nwretched joke about _pro bono publico_. Well, the dog laid down the\r\nbone—_not_ in disgust with the pun, which would have shown it to be a\r\ndog of taste—but simply to rest its jaws, poor thing! I _did_ pity it\r\nso! Won’t you join my _Charitable Association for supplying dogs with\r\npockets_? How would _you_ like to have to carry your walking-stick in\r\nyour mouth?”\r\n\r\nIgnoring the difficult question as to the _raison d’être_ of a\r\nwalking-stick, supposing one had no _hands_, I mentioned a curious\r\ninstance, I had once witnessed, of reasoning by a dog. A gentleman, with\r\na lady, and child, and a large dog, were down at the end of a pier on\r\nwhich I was walking. To amuse his child, I suppose, the gentleman put\r\ndown on the ground his umbrella and the lady’s parasol, and then led the\r\nway to the other end of the pier, from which he sent the dog back for\r\nthe deserted articles. I was watching with some curiosity. The dog came\r\nracing back to where I stood, but found an unexpected difficulty in\r\npicking up the things it had come for. With the umbrella in its mouth,\r\nits jaws were so far apart that it could get no firm grip on the\r\nparasol. After two or three failures, it paused and considered the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThen it put down the umbrella and began with the parasol. Of course that\r\ndidn’t open its jaws nearly so wide, and it was able to get a good hold\r\nof the umbrella, and galloped off in triumph. One couldn’t doubt that it\r\nhad gone through a real train of logical thought.\r\n\r\n“I entirely agree with you,” said Lady Muriel: “but don’t orthodox\r\nwriters condemn that view, as putting Man on the level of the lower\r\nanimals? Don’t they draw a sharp boundary-line between Reason and\r\nInstinct?”\r\n\r\n“That certainly _was_ the orthodox view, a generation ago,” said the\r\nEarl. “The truth of Religion seemed ready to stand or fall with the\r\nassertion that Man was the only reasoning animal. But that is at an end\r\nnow. Man can still claim _certain_ monopolies—for instance, such a use\r\nof _language_ as enables us to utilise the work of many, by ‘division of\r\nlabour.’ But the belief, that we have a monopoly of _Reason_, has long\r\nbeen swept away. Yet no catastrophe has followed. As some old poet says,\r\n‘_God is where he was_.’”\r\n\r\n“Most religious believers would _now_ agree with Bishop Butler,” said I,\r\n“and not reject a line of argument, even if it led straight to the\r\nconclusion that animals have some kind of _soul_, which survives their\r\nbodily death.”\r\n\r\n“I _would_ like to know _that_ to be true!” Lady Muriel exclaimed. “If\r\nonly for the sake of the poor horses. Sometimes I’ve thought that, if\r\nanything _could_ make me cease to believe in a God of perfect justice,\r\nit would be the sufferings of horses—without guilt to deserve it, and\r\nwithout any compensation!”\r\n\r\n“It is only part of the great Riddle,” said the Earl, “why innocent\r\nbeings _ever_ suffer. It _is_ a great strain on Faith—but not a\r\n_breaking_ strain, I think.”\r\n\r\n“The sufferings of _horses_,” I said, “are chiefly caused by _Man’s_\r\ncruelty. So _that_ is merely one of the many instances of Sin causing\r\nsuffering to others than the Sinner himself. But don’t you find a\r\n_greater_ difficulty in sufferings inflicted by animals upon each other?\r\nFor instance, a cat playing with a mouse. Assuming it to have no _moral_\r\nresponsibility, isn’t that a greater mystery than a man over-driving a\r\nhorse?”\r\n\r\n“I think it _is_,” said Lady Muriel, looking a mute appeal to her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n“What right have we to make that assumption?” said the Earl. “_Many_ of\r\nour religious difficulties are merely deductions from unwarranted\r\nassumptions. The wisest answer to most of them, is, I think, ‘_behold,\r\nwe know not anything_.’”\r\n\r\n“You mentioned ‘division of labour,’ just now,” I said. “Surely it is\r\ncarried to a wonderful perfection in a hive of bees?”\r\n\r\n“So wonderful—so entirely super-human—” said the Earl, “and so entirely\r\ninconsistent with the intelligence they show in other ways—that I feel\r\nno doubt at all that it is _pure_ Instinct, and _not_, as some hold, a\r\nvery high order of Reason. Look at the utter stupidity of a bee, trying\r\nto find its way out of an open window! It _doesn’t_ try, in any\r\nreasonable sense of the word: it simply bangs itself about! We should\r\ncall a puppy _imbecile_, that behaved so. And yet we are asked to\r\nbelieve that its intellectual level is above Sir Isaac Newton!”\r\n\r\n“Then you hold that _pure_ Instinct contains no _Reason_ at all?”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said the Earl, “I hold that the work of a bee-hive\r\ninvolves Reason of the _highest_ order. But none of it is done by the\r\n_Bee_. _God_ has reasoned it all out, and has put into the mind of the\r\nBee the _conclusions_, only, of the reasoning process.”\r\n\r\n“But how do their minds come to work _together_?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“What right have we to assume that they _have_ minds?”\r\n\r\n“Special pleading, special pleading!” Lady Muriel cried, in a most\r\nunfilial tone of triumph. “Why, you yourself said, just now, ‘the mind\r\nof the Bee’!”\r\n\r\n“But I did _not_ say ‘_minds_,’ my child,” the Earl gently replied. “It\r\nhas occurred to me, as the most probable solution of the ‘Bee’-mystery,\r\nthat a swarm of Bees _have only one mind among them_. We often see one\r\nmind animating a most complex collection of limbs and organs, _when\r\njoined together_. How do we know that any material connection is\r\nnecessary? May not mere neighbourhood be enough? If so, a swarm of bees\r\nis simply a single animal whose many limbs are not quite close\r\ntogether!”\r\n\r\n“It is a bewildering thought,” I said, “and needs a night’s rest to\r\ngrasp it properly. Reason and Instinct _both_ tell me I ought to go\r\nhome. So, good-night!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll ‘set’ you part of the way,” said Lady Muriel. “I’ve had no walk\r\nto-day. It will do me good, and I have more to say to you. Shall we go\r\nthrough the wood? It will be pleasanter than over the common, even\r\nthough it _is_ getting a little dark.”\r\n\r\nWe turned aside into the shade of interlacing boughs, which formed an\r\narchitecture of almost perfect symmetry, grouped into lovely groined\r\narches, or running out, far as the eye could follow, into endless\r\naisles, and chancels, and naves, like some ghostly cathedral, fashioned\r\nout of the dream of a moon-struck poet.\r\n\r\n“Always, in this wood,” she began after a pause (silence seemed natural\r\nin this dim solitude), “I begin thinking of Fairies! May I ask you a\r\nquestion?” she added hesitatingly. “Do you believe in Fairies?”\r\n\r\nThe momentary impulse was so strong to tell her of my experiences in\r\nthis very wood, that I had to make a real effort to keep back the words\r\nthat rushed to my lips. “If you mean, by ‘believe,’ ‘believe in their\r\n_possible_ existence,’ I say ‘Yes.’ For their _actual_ existence, of\r\ncourse, one would need _evidence_.”\r\n\r\n“You were saying, the other day,” she went on, “that you would accept\r\n_anything_, on good evidence, that was not _à priori_ impossible. And I\r\nthink you named _Ghosts_ as an instance of a _provable_ phenomenon.\r\nWould _Fairies_ be another instance?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think so.” And again it was hard to check the wish to say more:\r\nbut I was not yet sure of a sympathetic listener.\r\n\r\n“And have you any theory as to what sort of place they would occupy in\r\nCreation? Do tell me what you think about them! Would they, for instance\r\n(supposing such beings to exist), would they have any moral\r\nresponsibility? I mean” (and the light bantering tone suddenly changed\r\nto one of deep seriousness) “would they be capable of _sin_?”\r\n\r\n“They can reason—on a lower level, perhaps, than men and women—never\r\nrising, I think, above the faculties of a child; and they have a moral\r\nsense, most surely. Such a being, without _free will_, would be an\r\nabsurdity. So I am driven to the conclusion that they _are_ capable of\r\nsin.”\r\n\r\n“You believe in them?” she cried delightedly, with a sudden motion as if\r\nabout to clap her hands. “Now tell me, have you any reason for it?”\r\n\r\nAnd still I strove to keep back the revelation I felt sure was coming.\r\n“I believe that there is _life_ everywhere—not _material_ only, not\r\nmerely what is palpable to our senses—but immaterial and invisible as\r\nwell. We believe in our own immaterial essence—call it ‘soul,’ or\r\n‘spirit,’ or what you will. Why should not other similar essences exist\r\naround us, _not_ linked on to a visible and _material_ body? Did not God\r\nmake this swarm of happy insects, to dance in this sunbeam for one hour\r\nof bliss, for no other object, that we can imagine, than to swell the\r\nsum of conscious happiness? And where shall we dare to draw the line,\r\nand say ‘He has made all these and no more’?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes!” she assented, watching me with sparkling eyes. “But these\r\nare only reasons for not _denying_. You have more reasons than this,\r\nhave you not?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes,” I said, feeling I might safely tell all now. “And I could\r\nnot find a fitter time or place to say it. I have _seen_ them—and in\r\nthis very wood!”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel asked no more questions. Silently she paced at my side, with\r\nhead bowed down and hands clasped tightly together. Only, as my tale\r\nwent on, she drew a little short quick breath now and then, like a child\r\npanting with delight. And I told her what I had never yet breathed to\r\nany other listener, of my double life, and, more than that (for _mine_\r\nmight have been but a noonday-dream), of the double life of those two\r\ndear children.\r\n\r\nAnd when I told her of Bruno’s wild gambols, she laughed merrily; and\r\nwhen I spoke of Sylvie’s sweetness and her utter unselfishness and\r\ntrustful love, she drew a deep breath, like one who hears at last some\r\nprecious tidings for which the heart has ached for a long while; and the\r\nhappy tears chased one another down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n“I have often longed to meet an angel,” she whispered, so low that I\r\ncould hardly catch the words. “I’m _so_ glad I’ve seen Sylvie! My heart\r\nwent out to the child the first moment that I saw her—— Listen!” she\r\nbroke off suddenly. “That’s Sylvie singing! I’m sure of it! Don’t you\r\nknow her voice?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard _Bruno_ sing, more than once,” I said: “but I never heard\r\nSylvie.”\r\n\r\n“I have only heard her _once_,” said Lady Muriel. “It was that day when\r\nyou brought us those mysterious flowers. The children had run out into\r\nthe garden; and I saw Eric coming in that way, and went to the window to\r\nmeet him: and Sylvie was singing, under the trees, a song I had never\r\nheard before. The words were something like ‘I think it is Love, I feel\r\nit is Love.’ Her voice sounded far away, like a dream, but it was\r\nbeautiful beyond all words—as sweet as an infant’s first smile, or the\r\nfirst gleam of the white cliffs when one is coming _home_ after weary\r\nyears—a voice that seemed to fill one’s whole being with peace and\r\nheavenly thoughts—— Listen!” she cried, breaking off again in her\r\nexcitement. “That _is_ her voice, and that’s the very song!”\r\n\r\nI could distinguish no words, but there was a dreamy sense of music in\r\nthe air that seemed to grow ever louder and louder, as if coming nearer\r\nto us. We stood quite silent, and in another minute the two children\r\nappeared, coming straight towards us through an arched opening among the\r\ntrees. Each had an arm round the other, and the setting sun shed a\r\ngolden halo round their heads, like what one sees in pictures of saints.\r\nThey were looking in our direction, but evidently did not see us, and I\r\nsoon made out that Lady Muriel had for once passed into a condition\r\nfamiliar to _me_, that we were both of us ‘eerie,’ and that, though we\r\ncould see the children so plainly, we were quite invisible to _them_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FAIRY-DUET]\r\n\r\nThe song ceased just as they came into sight: but, to my delight, Bruno\r\ninstantly said “Let’s sing it all again, Sylvie! It _did_ sound so\r\npretty!” And Sylvie replied “Very well. It’s _you_ to begin, you know.”\r\n\r\nSo Bruno began, in the sweet childish treble I knew so well:—\r\n\r\n  “Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping,\r\n    That lures the bird home to her nest?\r\n  Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping,\r\n    To cuddle and croon it to rest?\r\n  What’s the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms,\r\n    Till it cooes with the voice of the dove?”\r\n\r\nAnd now ensued quite the strangest of all the strange experiences that\r\nmarked the wonderful year whose history I am writing—the experience of\r\n_first_ hearing Sylvie’s voice in song. Her part was a very short\r\none—only a few words—and she sang it timidly, and very low indeed,\r\nscarcely audibly, but the _sweetness_ of her voice was simply\r\nindescribable; I have never heard any earthly music like it.\r\n\r\n  “’Tis a secret, and so let us whisper it low—\r\n    And the name of the secret is Love!”\r\n\r\nOn me the first effect of her voice was a sudden sharp pang that seemed\r\nto pierce through one’s very heart. (I had felt such a pang only once\r\nbefore in my life, and it had been from _seeing_ what, at the moment,\r\nrealised one’s idea of perfect beauty—it was in a London exhibition,\r\nwhere, in making my way through a crowd, I suddenly met, face to face, a\r\nchild of quite unearthly beauty.) Then came a rush of burning tears to\r\nthe eyes, as though one could weep one’s soul away for pure delight. And\r\nlastly there fell on me a sense of awe that was almost terror—some such\r\nfeeling as Moses must have had when he heard the words “_Put off thy\r\nshoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy\r\nground_.” The figures of the children became vague and shadowy, like\r\nglimmering meteors: while their voices rang together in exquisite\r\nharmony as they sang:—\r\n\r\n      “For I think it is Love,\r\n      For I feel it is Love,\r\n  For I’m sure it is nothing but Love!”\r\n\r\nBy this time I could see them clearly once more. Bruno again sang by\r\nhimself:—\r\n\r\n  “Say, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning,\r\n    Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease?\r\n  That stirs the vexed soul with an aching—a yearning\r\n    For the brotherly hand-grip of peace?\r\n  Whence the music that fills all our being—that thrills\r\n    Around us, beneath, and above?”\r\n\r\nSylvie sang more courageously, this time: the words seemed to carry her\r\naway, out of herself:—\r\n\r\n  “’Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes:\r\n    But the name of the secret is Love!”\r\n\r\nAnd clear and strong the chorus rang out:—\r\n\r\n      “For I think it is Love,\r\n      For I feel it is Love,\r\n  For I’m sure it is nothing but Love!”\r\n\r\nOnce more we heard Bruno’s delicate little voice alone:—\r\n\r\n  “Say whose is the skill that paints valley and hill,\r\n    Like a picture so fair to the sight?\r\n  That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow,\r\n    Till the little lambs leap with delight?”\r\n\r\nAnd again uprose that silvery voice, whose angelic sweetness I could\r\nhardly bear:—\r\n\r\n  “’Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold,\r\n    Though ’tis sung, by the angels above,\r\n  In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear—\r\n    And the name of the secret is Love!”\r\n\r\nAnd then Bruno joined in again with\r\n\r\n      “For I think it is Love,\r\n      For I feel it is Love,\r\n  For I’m sure it is nothing but Love!”\r\n\r\n“That _are_ pretty!” the little fellow exclaimed, as the children passed\r\nus—so closely that we drew back a little to make room for them, and it\r\nseemed we had only to reach out a hand to touch them: but this we did\r\nnot attempt.\r\n\r\n“No use to try and stop them!” I said, as they passed away into the\r\nshadows. “Why, they could not even _see_ us!”\r\n\r\n“No use at all,” Lady Muriel echoed with a sigh. “One would _like_ to\r\nmeet them again, in living form! But I feel, somehow, _that_ can never\r\nbe. They have passed out of _our_ lives!” She sighed again; and no more\r\nwas said, till we came out into the main road, at a point near my\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\n“Well, I will leave you here,” she said. “I want to get back before\r\ndark: and I have a cottage-friend to visit, first. Good night, dear\r\nfriend! Let us see you soon—and often!” she added, with an affectionate\r\nwarmth that went to my very heart. “_For those are few we hold as\r\ndear!_”\r\n\r\n“Good night!” I answered. “Tennyson said that of a worthier friend than\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Tennyson didn’t know what he was talking about!” she saucily rejoined,\r\nwith a touch of her old childish gaiety; and we parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n                          GAMMON AND SPINACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy landlady’s welcome had an extra heartiness about it: and though, with\r\na rare delicacy of feeling, she made no direct allusion to the friend\r\nwhose companionship had done so much to brighten life for me, I felt\r\nsure that it was a kindly sympathy with my solitary state that made her\r\nso specially anxious to do all she could think of to ensure my comfort,\r\nand make me feel at home.\r\n\r\nThe lonely evening seemed long and tedious: yet I lingered on, watching\r\nthe dying fire, and letting Fancy mould the red embers into the forms\r\nand faces belonging to bygone scenes. Now it seemed to be Bruno’s\r\nroguish smile that sparkled for a moment, and died away: now it was\r\nSylvie’s rosy cheek: and now the Professor’s jolly round face, beaming\r\nwith delight. “You’re welcome, my little ones!” he seemed to say. And\r\nthen the red coal, which for the moment embodied the dear old Professor,\r\nbegan to wax dim, and with its dying lustre the words seemed to die away\r\ninto silence. I seized the poker, and with an artful touch or two\r\nrevived the waning glow, while Fancy—no coy minstrel she—sang me once\r\nagain the magic strain I loved to hear.\r\n\r\n“You’re welcome, little ones!” the cheery voice repeated. “I told them\r\nyou were coming. Your rooms are all ready for you. And the Emperor and\r\nthe Empress—well, I think they’re rather pleased than otherwise! In\r\nfact, Her Highness said ‘I hope they’ll be in time for the Banquet!’\r\nThose were her very words, I assure you!”\r\n\r\n“Will Uggug be at the Banquet?” Bruno asked. And both children looked\r\nuneasy at the dismal suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course he will!” chuckled the Professor. “Why, it’s his\r\n_birthday_, don’t you know? And his health will be drunk, and all that\r\nsort of thing. What would the Banquet be without _him_?”\r\n\r\n“Ever so much nicer,” said Bruno. But he said it in a _very_ low voice,\r\nand nobody but Sylvie heard him.\r\n\r\nThe Professor chuckled again. “It’ll be a jolly Banquet, now _you’ve_\r\ncome, my little man! I _am_ so glad to see you again!”\r\n\r\n“I ’fraid we’ve been very long in coming,” Bruno politely remarked.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes,” the Professor assented. “However, you’re very short now\r\nyou’re come: that’s _some_ comfort.” And he went on to enumerate the\r\nplans for the day. “The Lecture comes first,” he said. “_That_ the\r\nEmpress _insists_ on. She says people will eat so much at the Banquet,\r\nthey’ll be too sleepy to attend to the Lecture afterwards—and perhaps\r\nshe’s right. There’ll just be a little _refreshment_, when the people\r\nfirst arrive—as a kind of surprise for the Empress, you know. Ever since\r\nshe’s been—well, not _quite_ so clever as she once was—we’ve found it\r\ndesirable to concoct little surprises for her. _Then_ comes the\r\nLecture——”\r\n\r\n“What? The Lecture you were getting ready—ever so long ago?” Sylvie\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\n“Yes—that’s the one,” the Professor rather reluctantly admitted. “It\r\n_has_ taken a goodish time to prepare. I’ve got so many other things to\r\nattend to. For instance, I’m Court-Physician. I have to keep all the\r\nRoyal Servants in good health—and that reminds me!” he cried, ringing\r\nthe bell in a great hurry. “This is Medicine-Day! We only give Medicine\r\nonce a week. If we were to begin giving it every day, the bottles would\r\n_soon_ be empty!”\r\n\r\n“But if they were ill on the _other_ days?” Sylvie suggested.\r\n\r\n“What, ill on the wrong _day_!” exclaimed the Professor. “Oh, that would\r\nnever do! A Servant would be dismissed _at once_, who was ill on the\r\nwrong day! This is the Medicine for _today_,” he went on, taking down a\r\nlarge jug from a shelf. “I mixed it, myself, first thing this morning.\r\nTaste it!” he said, holding out the jug to Bruno. “Dip in your finger,\r\nand taste it!”\r\n\r\nBruno did so, and made such an excruciatingly wry face that Sylvie\r\nexclaimed, in alarm, “Oh, Bruno, you mustn’t!”\r\n\r\n“It’s welly extremely nasty!” Bruno said, as his face resumed its\r\nnatural shape.\r\n\r\n“Nasty?” said the Professor. “Why, of _course_ it is! What would\r\nMedicine be, if it wasn’t _nasty_?”\r\n\r\n“Nice,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“I was going to say—” the Professor faltered, rather taken aback by the\r\npromptness of Bruno’s reply, “—that _that_ would never do! Medicine\r\n_has_ to be nasty, you know. Be good enough to take this jug, down into\r\nthe Servants’ Hall,” he said to the footman who answered the bell: “and\r\ntell them it’s their Medicine for _today_.”\r\n\r\n“Which of them is to drink it?” the footman asked, as he carried off the\r\njug.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ve not settled _that_ yet!” the Professor briskly replied. “I’ll\r\ncome and settle that, soon. Tell them not to begin, on any account, till\r\nI come! It’s really _wonderful_,” he said, turning to the children, “the\r\nsuccess I’ve had in curing Diseases! Here are some of my memoranda.” He\r\ntook down from the shelf a heap of little bits of paper, pinned together\r\nin twos and threes. “Just look at _this_ set, now. ‘_Under-Cook Number\r\nThirteen recovered from Common Fever—Febris Communis_.’ And now see\r\nwhat’s pinned to it. ‘_Gave Under-Cook Number Thirteen a Double Dose of\r\nMedicine_.’ _That’s_ something to be proud of, _isn’t_ it?”\r\n\r\n“But which happened _first_?” said Sylvie, looking very much puzzled.\r\n\r\nThe Professor examined the papers carefully. “They are not _dated_, I\r\nfind,” he said with a slightly dejected air: “so I fear I ca’n’t tell\r\nyou. But they _both_ happened: there’s no doubt of _that_. The\r\n_Medicine’s_ the great thing, you know. The _Diseases_ are much less\r\nimportant. You can keep a _Medicine_, for years and years: but nobody\r\never wants to keep a _Disease_! By the way, come and look at the\r\nplatform. The Gardener asked me to come and see if it would do. We may\r\nas well go before it gets dark.”\r\n\r\n“We’d like to, very much!” Sylvie replied. “Come, Bruno, put on your\r\nhat. Don’t keep the dear Professor waiting!”\r\n\r\n“Ca’n’t find my hat!” the little fellow sadly replied. “I were rolling\r\nit about. And it’s rolled itself away!”\r\n\r\n“Maybe it’s rolled in _there_,” Sylvie suggested, pointing to a dark\r\nrecess, the door of which stood half open: and Bruno ran in to look.\r\nAfter a minute he came slowly out again, looking very grave, and\r\ncarefully shut the cupboard-door after him.\r\n\r\n“It aren’t in there,” he said, with such unusual solemnity, that\r\nSylvie’s curiosity was roused.\r\n\r\n“What _is_ in there, Bruno?”\r\n\r\n“There’s cobwebs—and two spiders—” Bruno thoughtfully replied, checking\r\noff the catalogue on his fingers, “—and the cover of a picture-book—and\r\na tortoise—and a dish of nuts—and an old man.”\r\n\r\n“An old man!” cried the Professor, trotting across the room in great\r\nexcitement. “Why, it must be the Other Professor, that’s been lost for\r\never so long!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OTHER PROFESSOR FOUND]\r\n\r\nHe opened the door of the cupboard wide: and there he was, the Other\r\nProfessor, sitting in a chair, with a book on his knee, and in the act\r\nof helping himself to a nut from a dish, which he had taken down off a\r\nshelf just within his reach. He looked round at us, but said nothing\r\ntill he had cracked and eaten the nut. Then he asked the old question.\r\n“Is the Lecture all ready?”\r\n\r\n“It’ll begin in an hour,” the Professor said, evading the question.\r\n“First, we must have something to surprise the Empress. And then comes\r\nthe Banquet——”\r\n\r\n“The Banquet!” cried the Other Professor, springing up, and filling the\r\nroom with a cloud of dust. “Then I’d better go and—and brush myself a\r\nlittle. What a state I’m in!”\r\n\r\n“He _does_ want brushing!” the Professor said, with a critical air,\r\n“Here’s your hat, little man! I had put it on by mistake. I’d quite\r\nforgotten I had _one_ on, already. Let’s go and look at the platform.”\r\n\r\n“And there’s that nice old Gardener singing still!” Bruno exclaimed in\r\ndelight, as we went out into the garden. “I do believe he’s been singing\r\nthat very song ever since we went away!”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course he has!” replied the Professor. “It wouldn’t be the\r\nthing to leave off, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t be _what_ thing?” said Bruno: but the Professor thought it\r\nbest not to hear the question. “What are you doing with that hedgehog?”\r\nhe shouted at the Gardener, whom they found standing upon one foot,\r\nsinging softly to himself, and rolling a hedgehog up and down with the\r\nother foot.\r\n\r\n“Well, I wanted fur to know what hedgehogs lives on: so I be a-keeping\r\nthis here hedgehog—fur to see if it eats potatoes——”\r\n\r\n“Much better keep a potato,” said the Professor; “and see if hedgehogs\r\neat it!”\r\n\r\n“That be the roight way, sure-ly!” the delighted Gardener exclaimed. “Be\r\nyou come to see the platform?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye!” the Professor cheerily replied. “And the children have come\r\nback, you see!”\r\n\r\nThe Gardener looked round at them with a grin. Then he led the way to\r\nthe Pavilion; and as he went he sang:—\r\n\r\n  “He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Double Rule of Three:\r\n  ‘And all its Mystery,’ he said,\r\n    ‘Is clear as day to me!’”\r\n\r\n“You’ve been _months_ over that song,” said the Professor. “Isn’t it\r\nfinished yet?”\r\n\r\n“There be only one verse more,” the Gardener sadly replied. And, with\r\ntears streaming down his cheeks, he sang the last verse:—\r\n\r\n  “He thought he saw an Argument\r\n    That proved he was the Pope:\r\n  He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Bar of Mottled Soap.\r\n  ‘A fact so dread,’ he faintly said,\r\n    ‘Extinguishes all hope!’”\r\n\r\nChoking with sobs, the Gardener hastily stepped on a few yards ahead of\r\nthe party, to conceal his emotion.\r\n\r\n“Did _he_ see the Bar of Mottled Soap?” Sylvie enquired, as we followed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly!” said the Professor. “That song is his own history, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nTears of an ever-ready sympathy glittered in Bruno’s eyes. “I’s _welly_\r\nsorry he isn’t the Pope!” he said. “Aren’t _you_ sorry, Sylvie?”\r\n\r\n“Well—I hardly know,” Sylvie replied in the vaguest manner. “Would it\r\nmake him any happier?” she asked the Professor.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t make the _Pope_ any happier,” said the Professor. “Isn’t\r\nthe platform _lovely_?” he asked, as we entered the Pavilion.\r\n\r\n“I’ve put an extra beam under it!” said the Gardener, patting it\r\naffectionately as he spoke. “And now it’s that strong, as—as a mad\r\nelephant might dance upon it!”\r\n\r\n“Thank you _very_ much!” the Professor heartily rejoined. “I don’t know\r\nthat we shall exactly require—but it’s convenient to know.” And he led\r\nthe children upon the platform, to explain the arrangements to them.\r\n“Here are three seats, you see, for the Emperor and the Empress and\r\nPrince Uggug. But there must be two more chairs here!” he said, looking\r\ndown at the Gardener. “One for Lady Sylvie, and one for the smaller\r\nanimal!”\r\n\r\n“And may I help in the Lecture?” said Bruno. “I can do some\r\nconjuring-tricks.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s not exactly a _conjuring_ lecture,” the Professor said, as\r\nhe arranged some curious-looking machines on the table. “However, what\r\ncan you do? Did you ever go through a table, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“Often!” said Bruno. “_Haven’t_ I, Sylvie?”\r\n\r\nThe Professor was evidently surprised, though he tried not to show it.\r\n“This must be looked into,” he muttered to himself, taking out a\r\nnote-book. “And first—what kind of table?”\r\n\r\n“Tell him!” Bruno whispered to Sylvie, putting his arms round her neck.\r\n\r\n“Tell him yourself,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Ca’n’t,” said Bruno. “It’s a _bony_ word.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” laughed Sylvie. “You can say it well enough, if you only\r\ntry. Come!”\r\n\r\n“Muddle—” said Bruno. “That’s a bit of it.”\r\n\r\n“_What_ does he say?” cried the bewildered Professor.\r\n\r\n“He means the multiplication-table,” Sylvie explained.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked annoyed, and shut up his note-book again. “Oh,\r\nthat’s _quite_ another thing,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It are ever so many other things,” said Bruno. “_Aren’t_ it, Sylvie?”\r\n\r\nA loud blast of trumpets interrupted this conversation. “Why, the\r\nentertainment has _begun_!” the Professor exclaimed, as he hurried the\r\nchildren into the Reception-Saloon. “I had no idea it was so late!”\r\n\r\nA small table, containing cake and wine, stood in a corner of the\r\nSaloon; and here we found the Emperor and Empress waiting for us. The\r\nrest of the Saloon had been cleared of furniture, to make room for the\r\nguests. I was much struck by the great change a few months had made in\r\nthe faces of the Imperial Pair. A vacant stare was now the _Emperor’s_\r\nusual expression; while over the face of the _Empress_ there flitted,\r\never and anon, a meaningless smile.\r\n\r\n“So you’re come at last!” the Emperor sulkily remarked, as the Professor\r\nand the children took their places. It was evident that he was _very_\r\nmuch out of temper: and we were not long in learning the cause of this.\r\nHe did not consider the preparations, made for the Imperial party, to be\r\nsuch as suited their rank. “A common mahogany table!” he growled,\r\npointing to it contemptuously with his thumb. “Why wasn’t it made of\r\ngold, I should like to know?”\r\n\r\n“It would have taken a very long——” the Professor began, but the Emperor\r\ncut the sentence short.\r\n\r\n“Then the cake! Ordinary plum! Why wasn’t it made of—of——” He broke off\r\nagain. “Then the wine! Merely old Madeira! Why wasn’t it——? Then this\r\nchair! That’s worst of all. Why wasn’t it a throne? One _might_ excuse\r\nthe other omissions, but I _ca’n’t_ get over the chair!”\r\n\r\n“What _I_ ca’n’t get over,” said the Empress, in eager sympathy with her\r\nangry husband, “is the _table_!”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“It is much to be regretted!” the Professor mildly replied, as soon as\r\nhe had a chance of speaking. After a moment’s thought he strengthened\r\nthe remark. “_Everything_,” he said, addressing Society in general, “is\r\n_very much_ to be regretted!”\r\n\r\nA murmur of “Hear, hear!” rose from the crowded Saloon.\r\n\r\nThere was a rather awkward pause: the Professor evidently didn’t know\r\nhow to begin. The Empress leant forwards, and whispered to him. “A few\r\njokes, you know, Professor—just to put people at their ease!”\r\n\r\n“True, true, Madam!” the Professor meekly replied. “This little boy——”\r\n\r\n“_Please_ don’t make any jokes about _me_!” Bruno exclaimed, his eyes\r\nfilling with tears.\r\n\r\n“I won’t if you’d rather I didn’t,” said the kind-hearted Professor. “It\r\nwas only something about a Ship’s Buoy: a harmless pun—but it doesn’t\r\nmatter.” Here he turned to the crowd and addressed them in a loud voice.\r\n“Learn your A’s!” he shouted. “Your B’s! Your C’s! And your D’s! _Then_\r\nyou’ll be at your ease!”\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter from all the assembly, and then a great\r\ndeal of confused whispering. “_What_ was it he said? Something about\r\nbees, I fancy——.”\r\n\r\nThe Empress smiled in her meaningless way, and fanned herself. The poor\r\nProfessor looked at her timidly: he was clearly at his wits’ end again,\r\nand hoping for another hint. The Empress whispered again.\r\n\r\n“Some spinach, you know, Professor, as a surprise.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor beckoned to the Head-Cook, and said something to him in a\r\nlow voice. Then the Head-Cook left the room, followed by all the other\r\ncooks.\r\n\r\n“It’s difficult to get things started,” the Professor remarked to Bruno.\r\n“When once we get started, it’ll go on all right, you’ll see.”\r\n\r\n“If oo want to startle people,” said Bruno, “oo should put live frogs on\r\ntheir backs.”\r\n\r\nHere the cooks all came in again, in a procession, the Head-Cook coming\r\nlast and carrying something, which the others tried to hide by waving\r\nflags all round it. “Nothing but flags, Your Imperial Highness! Nothing\r\nbut flags!” he kept repeating, as he set it before her. Then all the\r\nflags were dropped in a moment, as the Head-Cook raised the cover from\r\nan enormous dish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS IS SURPRISED!’]\r\n\r\n“What is it?” the Empress said faintly, as she put her spy-glass to her\r\neye. “Why, it’s _Spinach_, I declare!”\r\n\r\n“Her Imperial Highness is surprised,” the Professor explained to the\r\nattendants: and some of them clapped their hands. The Head-Cook made a\r\nlow bow, and in doing so dropped a spoon on the table, as if by\r\naccident, just within reach of the Empress, who looked the other way and\r\npretended not to see it.\r\n\r\n“I _am_ surprised!” the Empress said to Bruno. “Aren’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” said Bruno. “I heard——” but Sylvie put her hand over his\r\nmouth, and spoke for him. “He’s rather tired, I think. He wants the\r\nLecture to begin.”\r\n\r\n“I want the _supper_ to begin,” Bruno corrected her.\r\n\r\nThe Empress took up the spoon in an absent manner, and tried to balance\r\nit across the back of her hand, and in doing this she dropped it into\r\nthe dish: and, when she took it out again, it was full of spinach. “How\r\ncurious!” she said, and put it into her mouth. “It tastes just like\r\n_real_ spinach! I thought it was an imitation—but I do believe it’s\r\nreal!” And she took another spoonful.\r\n\r\n“It wo’n’t be real much longer,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\nBut the Empress had had enough spinach by this time, and somehow—I\r\nfailed to notice the exact process—we all found ourselves in the\r\nPavilion, and the Professor in the act of beginning the long-expected\r\nLecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n                        THE PROFESSOR’S LECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“In Science—in fact, in most things—it is usually best _to begin at the\r\nbeginning_. In _some_ things, of course, it’s better to begin at the\r\n_other_ end. For instance, if you wanted to paint a dog green, it\r\n_might_ be best to begin with the _tail_, as it doesn’t bite at _that_\r\nend. And so——”\r\n\r\n“May _I_ help oo?” Bruno interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Help me to do _what_?” said the puzzled Professor, looking up for a\r\nmoment, but keeping his finger on the book he was reading from, so as\r\nnot to lose his place.\r\n\r\n“To paint a dog green!” cried Bruno. “_Oo_ can begin wiz its _mouf_, and\r\nI’ll——”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” said the Professor. “We haven’t got to the _Experiments_ yet.\r\nAnd so,” returning to his note-book, “I’ll give you the Axioms of\r\nScience. After that I shall exhibit some Specimens. Then I shall explain\r\na Process or two. And I shall conclude with a few Experiments. An\r\n_Axiom_, you know, is a thing that you accept without contradiction. For\r\ninstance, if I were to say ‘Here we are!’, that would be accepted\r\nwithout any contradiction, and it’s a nice sort of remark to _begin_ a\r\nconversation with. So it would be an _Axiom_. Or again, supposing I were\r\nto say ‘Here we are not!’ _that_ would be——”\r\n\r\n“—a fib!” cried Bruno.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _Bruno_!” said Sylvie in a warning whisper. “Of course it would be\r\nan _Axiom_, if the Professor said it!”\r\n\r\n“—that would be accepted, if people were civil,” continued the\r\nProfessor; “so it would be _another_ Axiom.”\r\n\r\n“It _might_ be an Axledum,” Bruno said: “but it wouldn’t be _true_!”\r\n\r\n“Ignorance of Axioms,” the Lecturer continued, “is a great drawback in\r\nlife. It wastes so much time to have to say them over and over again.\r\nFor instance, take the Axiom ‘_Nothing is greater than itself_’; that\r\nis, ‘_Nothing can contain itself_.’ How often you hear people say ‘He\r\nwas so excited, he was quite unable to contain himself,’ Why, _of\r\ncourse_ he was unable! The _excitement_ had nothing to do with it!”\r\n\r\n“I say, look here, you know!” said the Emperor, who was getting a little\r\nrestless. “How many Axioms are you going to give us? At _this_ rate, we\r\nsha’n’t get to the _Experiments_ till to-morrow-week!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sooner than _that_, I assure you!” the Professor replied, looking\r\nup in alarm. “There are only,” (he referred to his notes again) “only\r\n_two_ more, that are really _necessary_.”\r\n\r\n“Read ’em out, and get on to the _Specimens_,” grumbled the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“The _First_ Axiom,” the Professor read out in a great hurry, “consists\r\nof these words, ‘_Whatever is, is_.’ And the Second consists of _these_\r\nwords, ‘_Whatever isn’t, isn’t_.’ We will now go on to the _Specimens_.\r\nThe first tray contains Crystals and other Things.” He drew it towards\r\nhim, and again referred to his note-book. “Some of the labels—owing to\r\ninsufficient adhesion——” Here he stopped again, and carefully examined\r\nthe page with his eyeglass. “I ca’n’t quite read the rest of the\r\nsentence,” he said at last, “but it _means_ that the labels have come\r\nloose, and the Things have got mixed——”\r\n\r\n“Let _me_ stick ’em on again!” cried Bruno eagerly, and began licking\r\nthem, like postage-stamps, and dabbing them down upon the Crystals and\r\nthe other Things. But the Professor hastily moved the tray out of his\r\nreach. “They _might_ get fixed to the _wrong_ Specimens, you know!” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Oo shouldn’t have any _wrong_ peppermints in the tray!” Bruno boldly\r\nreplied. “_Should_ he, Sylvie?”\r\n\r\nBut Sylvie only shook her head.\r\n\r\nThe Professor heard him not. He had taken up one of the bottles, and was\r\ncarefully reading the label through his eye-glass. “Our first\r\nSpecimen——” he announced, as he placed the bottle in front of the other\r\nThings, “is—that is, it is called——” here he took it up, and examined\r\nthe label again, as if he thought it might have changed since he last\r\nsaw it, “is called Aqua Pura—common water—the fluid that cheers——”\r\n\r\n“Hip! Hip! Hip!” the Head-Cook began enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“—but _not_ inebriates!” the Professor went on quickly, but only just in\r\ntime to check the “Hooroar!” which was beginning.\r\n\r\n“Our second Specimen,” he went on, carefully opening a small jar, “is——”\r\nhere he removed the lid, and a large beetle instantly darted out, and\r\nwith an angry buzz went straight out of the Pavilion, “—is—or rather, I\r\nshould say,” looking sadly into the empty jar, “it _was_—a curious kind\r\nof Blue Beetle. Did any one happen to remark—as it went past—three blue\r\nspots under each wing?”\r\n\r\nNobody had remarked them.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well!” the Professor said with a sigh. “It’s a pity. Unless you\r\nremark that kind of thing _at the moment_, it’s very apt to get\r\noverlooked! The _next_ Specimen, at any rate, will not fly away! It\r\nis—in short, or perhaps, more correctly, at _length_—an _Elephant_. You\r\nwill observe——.” Here he beckoned to the Gardener to come up on the\r\nplatform, and with his help began putting together what looked like an\r\nenormous dog-kennel, with short tubes projecting out of it on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n“But we’ve seen _Elephants_ before,” the Emperor grumbled.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but not through a _Megaloscope_!” the Professor eagerly replied.\r\n“You know you can’t see a _Flea_, properly, without a\r\n_magnifying_-glass—what we call a _Microscope_. Well, just in the same\r\nway, you ca’n’t see an _Elephant_, properly, without a\r\n_minimifying_-glass. There’s one in each of these little tubes. And\r\n_this_ is a _Megaloscope_! The Gardener will now bring in the next\r\nSpecimen. Please open _both_ curtains, down at the end there, and make\r\nway for the Elephant!”\r\n\r\nThere was a general rush to the sides of the Pavilion, and all eyes were\r\nturned to the open end, watching for the return of the Gardener, who had\r\ngone away singing “_He thought he saw an Elephant That practised on a\r\nFife!_” There was silence for a minute: and then his harsh voice was\r\nheard again in the distance. “_He looked again_—come up, then! _He\r\nlooked again, and found it was_—woa back! _and, found it was A letter\r\nfrom his_—make way there! He’s a-coming!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ELEPHANT’]\r\n\r\nAnd in marched, or waddled—it is hard to say which is the right word—an\r\nElephant, on its hind-legs, and playing on an enormous fife which it\r\nheld with its fore-feet.\r\n\r\nThe Professor hastily threw open a large door at the end of the\r\nMegaloscope, and the huge animal, at a signal from the Gardener, dropped\r\nthe fife, and obediently trotted into the machine, the door of which was\r\nat once shut by the Professor. “The Specimen is now ready for\r\nobservation!” he proclaimed. “It is exactly the size of the Common\r\nMouse—_Mus Communis_!”\r\n\r\nThere was a general rush to the tubes, and the spectators watched with\r\ndelight the minikin creature, as it playfully coiled its trunk round the\r\nProfessor’s extended finger, finally taking its stand upon the palm of\r\nhis hand, while he carefully lifted it out, and carried it off to\r\nexhibit to the Imperial party.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it a _darling_?” cried Bruno. “May I stroke it, please? I’ll\r\ntouch it _welly_ gently!”\r\n\r\nThe Empress inspected it solemnly with her eye-glass. “It is very\r\nsmall,” she said in a deep voice. “Smaller than elephants usually are, I\r\nbelieve?”\r\n\r\nThe Professor gave a start of delighted surprise. “Why, that’s _true_!”\r\nhe murmured to himself. Then louder, turning to the audience, “Her\r\nImperial Highness has made a remark which is perfectly sensible!” And a\r\nwild cheer arose from that vast multitude.\r\n\r\n“The next Specimen,” the Professor proclaimed, after carefully placing\r\nthe little Elephant in the tray, among the Crystals and other Things,\r\n“is a _Flea_, which we will enlarge for the purposes of observation.”\r\nTaking a small pill-box from the tray, he advanced to the Megaloscope,\r\nand reversed all the tubes. “The Specimen is ready!” he cried, with his\r\neye at one of the tubes, while he carefully emptied the pill-box through\r\na little hole at the side. “It is now the size of the Common\r\nHorse—_Equus Communis_!”\r\n\r\nThere was another general rush, to look through the tubes, and the\r\nPavilion rang with shouts of delight, through which the Professor’s\r\nanxious tones could scarcely be heard. “Keep the door of the Microscope\r\n_shut_!” he cried. “If the creature were to escape, _this size_, it\r\nwould——” But the mischief was done. The door had swung open, and in\r\nanother moment the Monster had got out, and was trampling down the\r\nterrified, shrieking spectators.\r\n\r\nBut the Professor’s presence of mind did not desert him. “Undraw those\r\ncurtains!” he shouted. It was done. The Monster gathered its legs\r\ntogether, and in one tremendous bound vanished into the sky.\r\n\r\n“Where _is_ it?” said the Emperor, rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n“In the next Province, I fancy,” the Professor replied. “That jump would\r\ntake it at _least_ five miles! The next thing is to explain a Process or\r\ntwo. But I find there is hardly room enough to operate—the smaller\r\nanimal is rather in my way——”\r\n\r\n“Who does he mean?” Bruno whispered to Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“He means _you_!” Sylvie whispered back. “Hush!”\r\n\r\n“Be kind enough to move—angularly—to _this_ corner,” the Professor said,\r\naddressing himself to Bruno.\r\n\r\nBruno hastily moved his chair in the direction indicated. “Did I move\r\nangrily enough?” he inquired. But the Professor was once more absorbed\r\nin his Lecture, which he was reading from his note-book.\r\n\r\n“I will now explain the Process of—the name is blotted, I’m sorry to\r\nsay. It will be illustrated by a number of—of——” here he examined the\r\npage for some time, and at last said “It seems to be either\r\n‘Experiments’ or ‘Specimens’——”\r\n\r\n“Let it be _Experiments_,” said the Emperor. “We’ve seen plenty of\r\n_Specimens_.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, certainly!” the Professor assented. “We will have some\r\nExperiments.”\r\n\r\n“May _I_ do them?” Bruno eagerly asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh dear no!” The Professor looked dismayed. “I really don’t know what\r\nwould happen if _you_ did them!”\r\n\r\n“Nor nobody doosn’t know what’ll happen if _oo_ doos them!” Bruno\r\nretorted.\r\n\r\n“Our First Experiment requires a Machine. It has two knobs—only\r\n_two_—you can count them, if you like.”\r\n\r\nThe Head-Cook stepped forwards, counted them, and retired satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Now you _might_ press those two knobs together—but that’s not the way\r\nto do it. Or you _might_ turn the Machine upside-down—but _that’s_ not\r\nthe way to do it!”\r\n\r\n“What _are_ the way to do it?” said Bruno, who was listening very\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\nThe Professor smiled benignantly. “Ah, yes!” he said, in a voice like\r\nthe heading of a chapter. “The Way To Do It! Permit me!” and in a moment\r\nhe had whisked Bruno upon the table. “I divide my subject,” he began,\r\n“into three parts——”\r\n\r\n“I think I’ll get down!” Bruno whispered to Sylvie. “It aren’t nice to\r\nbe divided!”\r\n\r\n“He hasn’t got a knife, silly boy!” Sylvie whispered in reply. “Stand\r\nstill! You’ll break all the bottles!”\r\n\r\n“The first part is to take hold of the knobs,” putting them into Bruno’s\r\nhands. “The second part is——” Here he turned the handle, and, with a\r\nloud “Oh!”, Bruno dropped both the knobs, and began rubbing his elbows.\r\n\r\nThe Professor chuckled in delight. “It had a sensible effect. _Hadn’t_\r\nit?” he enquired.\r\n\r\n“No, it hadn’t a _sensible_ effect!” Bruno said indignantly. “It were\r\nvery silly indeed. It jingled my elbows, and it banged my back, and it\r\ncrinkled my hair, and it buzzed among my bones!”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure it _didn’t_!” said Sylvie. “You’re only inventing!”\r\n\r\n“Oo doosn’t know nuffin about it!” Bruno replied. “Oo wasn’t there to\r\nsee. Nobody ca’n’t go among my bones. There isn’t room!”\r\n\r\n“Our Second Experiment,” the Professor announced, as Bruno returned to\r\nhis place, still thoughtfully rubbing his elbows, “is the production of\r\nthat seldom-seen-but-greatly-to-be-admired phenomenon, Black Light! You\r\nhave seen White Light, Red Light, Green Light, and so on: but never,\r\ntill this wonderful day, have any eyes but mine seen _Black Light_! This\r\nbox,” carefully lifting it upon the table, and covering it with a heap\r\nof blankets, “is quite full of it. The way I made it was this—I took a\r\nlighted candle into a dark cupboard and shut the door. Of course the\r\ncupboard was then full of _Yellow_ Light. Then I took a bottle of Black\r\nink, and poured it over the candle: and, to my delight, every atom of\r\nthe Yellow Light turned _Black_! That was indeed the proudest moment of\r\nmy life! Then I filled a box with it. And now—would any one like to get\r\nunder the blankets and see it?”\r\n\r\nDead silence followed this appeal: but at last Bruno said “_I’ll_ get\r\nunder, if it won’t jingle my elbows.”\r\n\r\nSatisfied on this point, Bruno crawled under the blankets, and, after a\r\nminute or two, crawled out again, very hot and dusty, and with his hair\r\nin the wildest confusion.\r\n\r\n“What did you see in the box?” Sylvie eagerly enquired.\r\n\r\n“I saw _nuffin_!” Bruno sadly replied. “It were too dark!”\r\n\r\n“He has described the appearance of the thing exactly!” the Professor\r\nexclaimed with enthusiasm. “Black Light, and Nothing, look so extremely\r\nalike, at first sight, that I don’t wonder he failed to distinguish\r\nthem! We will now proceed to the Third Experiment.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor came down, and led the way to where a post had been driven\r\nfirmly into the ground. To one side of the post was fastened a chain,\r\nwith an iron weight hooked on to the end of it, and from the other side\r\nprojected a piece of whalebone, with a ring at the end of it. “This is a\r\n_most_ interesting Experiment!” the Professor announced. “It will need\r\n_time_, I’m afraid: but that is a trifling disadvantage. Now observe. If\r\nI were to unhook this weight, and let go, it would fall to the ground.\r\nYou do not deny _that_?”\r\n\r\nNobody denied it.\r\n\r\n“And in the same way, if I were to bend this piece of whalebone round\r\nthe post—thus—and put the ring over this hook—thus—it stays bent: but,\r\nif I unhook it, it straightens itself again. You do not deny _that_?”\r\n\r\nAgain, nobody denied it.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, suppose we left things just as they are, for a long time.\r\nThe force of the _whalebone_ would get exhausted, you know, and it would\r\nstay bent, even when you unhooked it. Now, _why_ shouldn’t the same\r\nthing happen with the _weight_? The _whalebone_ gets so used to being\r\nbent, that it ca’n’t _straighten_ itself any more. Why shouldn’t the\r\n_weight_ get so used to being held up, that it ca’n’t _fall_ any more?\r\nThat’s what _I_ want to know!”\r\n\r\n“That’s what _we_ want to know!” echoed the crowd.\r\n\r\n“How long must we wait?” grumbled the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked at his watch. “Well, I _think_ a thousand years\r\nwill do to _begin_ with,” he said. “Then we will cautiously unhook the\r\nweight: and, if it _still_ shows (as perhaps it will) a _slight_\r\ntendency to fall, we will hook it on to the chain again, and leave it\r\nfor _another_ thousand years.”\r\n\r\nHere the Empress experienced one of those flashes of Common Sense which\r\nwere the surprise of all around her. “Meanwhile there’ll be time for\r\nanother Experiment,” she said.\r\n\r\n“There will _indeed_!” cried the delighted Professor. “Let us return to\r\nthe platform, and proceed to the _Fourth_ Experiment!”\r\n\r\n“For this concluding Experiment, I will take a certain Alkali, or Acid—I\r\nforget which. Now you’ll see what will happen when I mix it with Some——”\r\nhere he took up a bottle, and looked at it doubtfully, “—when I mix it\r\nwith—with Something——”\r\n\r\nHere the Emperor interrupted. “What’s the _name_ of the stuff?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember the _name_,” said the Professor: “and the label has\r\ncome off.” He emptied it quickly into the other bottle, and, with a\r\ntremendous bang, both bottles flew to pieces, upsetting all the\r\nmachines, and filling the Pavilion with thick black smoke. I sprang to\r\nmy feet in terror, and—and found myself standing before my solitary\r\nhearth, where the poker, dropping at last from the hand of the sleeper,\r\nhad knocked over the tongs and the shovel, and had upset the kettle,\r\nfilling the air with clouds of steam. With a weary sigh, I betook myself\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EXPLOSION]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n                              THE BANQUET.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Heaviness may endure for a night: but joy cometh in the morning._” The\r\nnext day found me quite another being. Even the memories of my lost\r\nfriend and companion were sunny as the genial weather that smiled around\r\nme. I did not venture to trouble Lady Muriel, or her father, with\r\nanother call so soon: but took a walk into the country, and only turned\r\nhomewards when the low sunbeams warned me that day would soon be over.\r\n\r\nOn my way home, I passed the cottage where the old man lived, whose face\r\nalways recalled to me the day when I first met Lady Muriel; and I\r\nglanced in as I passed, half-curious to see if he were still living\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nYes: the old man was still alive. He was sitting out in the porch,\r\nlooking just as he did when I first saw him at Fayfield Junction—it\r\nseemed only a few days ago!\r\n\r\n“Good evening!” I said, pausing.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, Maister!” he cheerfully responded. “Wo’n’t ee step in?”\r\n\r\nI stepped in, and took a seat on the bench in the porch. “I’m glad to\r\nsee you looking so hearty,” I began. “Last time, I remember, I chanced\r\nto pass just as Lady Muriel was coming away from the house. Does she\r\nstill come to see you?”\r\n\r\n“Ees,” he answered slowly. “She has na forgotten me. I don’t lose her\r\nbonny face for many days together. Well I mind the very first time she\r\ncome, after we’d met at Railway Station. She told me as she come to mak’\r\namends. Dear child! Only think o’ that! To mak’ amends!”\r\n\r\n“To make amends for what?” I enquired. “What could _she_ have done to\r\nneed it?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it were loike this, you see? We were both on us a-waiting fur t’\r\ntrain at t’ Junction. And I had setten mysen down upat t’ bench. And\r\nStation-Maister, _he_ comes and he orders me off—fur t’ mak’ room for\r\nher Ladyship, you understand?”\r\n\r\n“I remember it all,” I said. “I was there myself, that day.”\r\n\r\n“_Was_ you, now? Well, an’ she axes my pardon fur’t. Think o’ that, now!\r\n_My_ pardon! An owd ne’er-do-weel like me! Ah! She’s been here many a\r\ntime, sin’ then. Why, she were in here only yestere’en, as it were,\r\nasittin’, as it might be, where you’re a-sitting now, an’ lookin’\r\nsweeter and kinder nor an angel! An’ she says ‘You’ve not got your\r\nMinnie, now,’ she says, ‘to fettle for ye.’ Minnie was my\r\ngrand-daughter, Sir, as lived wi’ me. She died, a matter of two months\r\nago—or it may be three. She was a bonny lass—and a good lass, too. Eh,\r\nbut life has been rare an’ lonely without her!”\r\n\r\nHe covered his face in his hands: and I waited a minute or two, in\r\nsilence, for him to recover himself.\r\n\r\n“So she says ‘Just tak’ _me_ fur your Minnie!’ she says. ‘Didna Minnie\r\nmak’ your tea fur you?’ says she. ‘Ay,’ says I. An she mak’s the tea.\r\n‘An’ didna Minnie light your pipe?’ says she. ‘Ay,’ says I. An’ she\r\nlights the pipe for me. ‘An’ didna Minnie set out your tea in t’ porch?’\r\nAn’ I says ‘My dear,’ I says, ‘I’m thinking you’re Minnie hersen!’ An’\r\nshe cries a bit. We both on us cries a bit——.”\r\n\r\nAgain I kept silence for a while.\r\n\r\n“An’ while I smokes my pipe, she sits an’ talks to me—as loving an’ as\r\npleasant! I’ll be bound I thowt it were Minnie come again! An’ when she\r\ngets up to go, I says ‘Winnot ye shak’ hands wi’ me?’ says I. An’ she\r\nsays ‘Na,’ she says: ‘a cannot _shak’ hands_ wi’ thee!’ she says.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry she said _that_,” I put in, thinking it was the only instance\r\nI had ever known of pride of rank showing itself in Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\n“Bless you, it werena _pride_!” said the old man, reading my thoughts.\r\n“She says ‘_Your_ Minnie never _shook hands_ wi’ you!’ she says. ‘An’\r\n_I’m_ your Minnie now,’ she says. An’ she just puts her dear arms about\r\nmy neck—and she kisses me on t’ cheek—an’ may God in Heaven bless her!”\r\nAnd here the poor old man broke down entirely, and could say no more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘A CANNOT SHAK’ HANDS WI’ THEE!’]\r\n\r\n“God bless her!” I echoed. “And good night to you!” I pressed his hand,\r\nand left him. “Lady Muriel,” I said softly to myself as I went\r\nhomewards, “truly you know how to ‘mak’ amends’!”\r\n\r\nSeated once more by my lonely fireside, I tried to recall the strange\r\nvision of the night before, and to conjure up the face of the dear old\r\nProfessor among the blazing coals. “That black one—with just a touch of\r\nred—would suit him well,” I thought. “After such a catastrophe, it would\r\nbe sure to be covered with black stains—and he would say:—\r\n\r\n“The result of _that_ combination—you may have noticed?—was an\r\n_Explosion_! Shall I repeat the Experiment?”\r\n\r\n“No, no! Don’t trouble yourself!” was the general cry. And we all\r\ntrooped off, in hot haste, to the Banqueting-Hall, where the feast had\r\nalready begun.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in helping the dishes, and very speedily every guest\r\nfound his plate filled with good things.\r\n\r\n“I have always maintained the principle,” the Professor began, “that it\r\nis a good rule to take some food—occasionally. The great advantage of\r\ndinner-parties——” he broke off suddenly. “Why, actually here’s the Other\r\nProfessor!” he cried. “And there’s no place left for him!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OTHER PROFESSOR’S FALL]\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor came in reading a large book, which he held close to\r\nhis eyes. One result of his not looking where he was going was that he\r\ntripped up, as he crossed the Saloon, flew up into the air, and fell\r\nheavily on his face in the middle of the table.\r\n\r\n“_What_ a pity!” cried the kind-hearted Professor, as he helped him up.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t be _me_, if I didn’t trip,” said the Other Professor.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked much shocked. “Almost _anything_ would be better\r\nthan _that_!” he exclaimed. “It never does,” he added, aside to Bruno,\r\n“to be anybody else, does it?”\r\n\r\nTo which Bruno gravely replied “I’s got nuffin on my plate.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor hastily put on his spectacles, to make sure that the\r\n_facts_ were all right, to begin with: then he turned his jolly round\r\nface upon the unfortunate owner of the empty plate. “And what would you\r\nlike next, my little man?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” Bruno said, a little doubtfully, “I think I’ll take some\r\nplum-pudding, please—while I think of it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bruno!” (This was a whisper from Sylvie.) “It isn’t good manners to\r\nask for a dish before it comes!”\r\n\r\nAnd Bruno whispered back “But I might forget to ask for some, when it\r\ncomes, oo know—I _do_ forget things, sometimes,” he added, seeing Sylvie\r\nabout to whisper more.\r\n\r\nAnd _this_ assertion Sylvie did not venture to contradict.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a chair had been placed for the Other Professor, between the\r\nEmpress and Sylvie. Sylvie found him a rather uninteresting neighbour:\r\nin fact, she couldn’t afterwards remember that he had made more than\r\n_one_ remark to her during the whole banquet, and that was “What a\r\ncomfort a Dictionary is!” (She told Bruno, afterwards, that she had been\r\ntoo much afraid of him to say more than “Yes, Sir,” in reply; and that\r\nhad been the end of their conversation. On which Bruno expressed a very\r\ndecided opinion that _that_ wasn’t worth calling a ‘conversation’ at\r\nall. “Oo should have asked him a riddle!” he added triumphantly. “Why,\r\n_I_ asked the Professor _three_ riddles! One was that one you asked me\r\nin the morning, ‘How many pennies is there in two shillings?’ And\r\nanother was——” “Oh, Bruno!” Sylvie interrupted. “_That_ wasn’t a\r\nriddle!” “It _were_!” Bruno fiercely replied.)\r\n\r\nBy this time a waiter had supplied Bruno with a plateful of _something_,\r\nwhich drove the plum-pudding out of his head.\r\n\r\n“Another advantage of dinner-parties,” the Professor cheerfully\r\nexplained, for the benefit of any one that would listen, “is that it\r\nhelps you to _see_ your friends. If you want to _see_ a man, offer him\r\nsomething to eat. It’s the same rule with a mouse.”\r\n\r\n“This Cat’s very kind to the Mouses,” Bruno said, stooping to stroke a\r\nremarkably fat specimen of the race, that had just waddled into the\r\nroom, and was rubbing itself affectionately against the leg of his\r\nchair. “Please, Sylvie, pour some milk in your saucer. Pussie’s ever so\r\nthirsty!”\r\n\r\n“Why do you want _my_ saucer?” said Sylvie. “You’ve got one yourself!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” said Bruno: “but I wanted _mine_ for to give it some\r\n_more_ milk in.”\r\n\r\nSylvie looked unconvinced: however it seemed quite impossible for her\r\n_ever_ to refuse what her brother asked: so she quietly filled her\r\nsaucer with milk, and handed it to Bruno, who got down off his chair to\r\nadminister it to the cat.\r\n\r\n“The room’s very hot, with all this crowd,” the Professor said to\r\nSylvie. “I wonder why they don’t put some lumps of ice in the grate? You\r\nfill it with lumps of coal in the winter, you know, and you sit round it\r\nand enjoy the warmth. How jolly it would be to fill it now with lumps of\r\nice, and sit round it and enjoy the coolth!”\r\n\r\nHot as it was, Sylvie shivered a little at the idea. “It’s very cold\r\n_outside_,” she said. “My feet got almost frozen to-day.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the _shoemaker’s_ fault!” the Professor cheerfully replied. “How\r\noften I’ve explained to him that he _ought_ to make boots with little\r\niron frames under the soles, to hold lamps! But he never _thinks_. No\r\none would suffer from cold, if only they would _think_ of those little\r\nthings. I always use hot ink, myself, in the winter. Very few people\r\never think of _that_! Yet how simple it is!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s very simple,” Sylvie said politely. “Has the cat had enough?”\r\nThis was to Bruno, who had brought back the saucer only half-emptied.\r\n\r\nBut Bruno did not hear the question. “There’s somebody scratching at the\r\ndoor and wanting to come in,” he said. And he scrambled down off his\r\nchair, and went and cautiously peeped out through the door-way.\r\n\r\n“Who was it wanted to come in?” Sylvie asked, as he returned to his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n“It were a Mouse,” said Bruno. “And it peepted in. And it saw the Cat.\r\nAnd it said ‘I’ll come in another day.’ And I said ‘Oo needn’t be\r\nflightened. The Cat’s _welly_ kind to Mouses.’ And it said ‘But I’s got\r\nsome imporkant business, what I _must_ attend to.’ And it said ‘I’ll\r\ncall again to-morrow.’ And it said ‘Give my love to the Cat.’”\r\n\r\n“What a fat cat it is!” said the Lord Chancellor, leaning across the\r\nProfessor to address his small neighbour. “It’s quite a wonder!”\r\n\r\n“It was awfully fat when it camed in,” said Bruno: “so it would be more\r\nwonderfuller if it got thin all in a minute.”\r\n\r\n“And that was the reason, I suppose,” the Lord Chancellor suggested,\r\n“why you didn’t give it the rest of the milk?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bruno. “It were a betterer reason. I tooked the saucer up\r\n’cause it were so discontented!”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t look so to _me_,” said the Lord Chancellor. “What made you\r\nthink it was discontented?”\r\n\r\n“’Cause it grumbled in its throat.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bruno!” cried Sylvie. “Why, that’s the way cats show they’re\r\n_pleased_!”\r\n\r\nBruno looked doubtful. “It’s not a good way,” he objected. “Oo wouldn’t\r\nsay _I_ were pleased, if I made that noise in my throat!”\r\n\r\n“What a singular boy!” the Lord Chancellor whispered to himself: but\r\nBruno had caught the words.\r\n\r\n“What do it mean to say ‘a _singular_ boy’?” he whispered to Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“It means _one_ boy,” Sylvie whispered in return. “And _plural_ means\r\ntwo or three.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’s welly glad I _is_ a singular boy!” Bruno said with great\r\nemphasis. “It would be _horrid_ to be two or three boys! P’raps they\r\nwouldn’t play with me!”\r\n\r\n“Why _should_ they?” said the Other Professor, suddenly waking up out of\r\na deep reverie. “They might be asleep, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t, if _I_ was awake,” Bruno said cunningly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but they might indeed!” the Other Professor protested. “Boys don’t\r\nall go to sleep at once, you know. So these boys—but who are you talking\r\nabout?”\r\n\r\n“He _never_ remembers to ask that first!” the Professor whispered to the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n“Why, the rest of _me_, a-course!” Bruno exclaimed triumphantly.\r\n“Supposing I was two or three boys!”\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor sighed, and seemed to be sinking back into his\r\nreverie; but suddenly brightened up again, and addressed the Professor.\r\n“There’s nothing more to be done _now_, is there?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s the dinner to finish,” the Professor said with a\r\nbewildered smile: “and the heat to bear. I hope you’ll enjoy the\r\ndinner—such as it is; and that you won’t mind the heat—such as it\r\nisn’t.”\r\n\r\nThe sentence _sounded_ well, but somehow I couldn’t quite understand it;\r\nand the Other Professor seemed to be no better off. “Such as it isn’t\r\n_what_?” he peevishly enquired.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t as hot as it might be,” the Professor replied, catching at the\r\nfirst idea that came to hand.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see what you mean _now_!” the Other Professor graciously\r\nremarked. “It’s very badly expressed, but I quite see it _now_! Thirteen\r\nminutes and a half ago,” he went on, looking first at Bruno and then at\r\nhis watch as he spoke, “you said ‘this Cat’s very kind to the Mouses.’\r\nIt must be a singular animal!”\r\n\r\n“So it _are_,” said Bruno, after carefully examining the Cat, to make\r\nsure how many there were of it.\r\n\r\n“But how do you know it’s kind to the Mouses—or, more correctly\r\nspeaking, the _Mice_?”\r\n\r\n“’Cause it _plays_ with the Mouses,” said Bruno; “for to amuse them, oo\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“But that is just what I _don’t_ know,” the Other Professor rejoined.\r\n“My belief is, it plays with them to _kill_ them!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s quite a _accident_!” Bruno began, so eagerly, that it was\r\nevident he had already propounded this very difficulty to the Cat. “It\r\n’splained all that to me, while it were drinking the milk. It said ‘I\r\nteaches the Mouses new games: the Mouses likes it ever so much.’ It said\r\n‘Sometimes little accidents happens: sometimes the Mouses kills\r\ntheirselves.’ It said ‘I’s always _welly_ sorry, when the Mouses kills\r\ntheirselves.’ It said——”\r\n\r\n“If it was so _very_ sorry,” Sylvie said, rather disdainfully, “it\r\nwouldn’t _eat_ the Mouses after they’d killed themselves!”\r\n\r\nBut this difficulty, also, had evidently not been lost sight of in the\r\nexhaustive ethical discussion just concluded. “It said——” (the orator\r\nconstantly omitted, as superfluous, his own share in the dialogue, and\r\nmerely gave us the replies of the Cat) “It said ‘Dead Mouses _never_\r\nobjecks to be eaten.’ It said ‘There’s no use wasting good Mouses.’ It\r\nsaid ‘Wifful—’ sumfinoruvver. It said ‘And oo may live to say ‘How much\r\nI wiss I had the Mouse that then I frew away!’ It said——.”\r\n\r\n“It hadn’t _time_ to say such a lot of things!” Sylvie interrupted\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n“Oo doosn’t know how Cats speaks!” Bruno rejoined contemptuously. “Cats\r\nspeaks _welly_ quick!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n                             THE PIG-TALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time the appetites of the guests seemed to be nearly satisfied,\r\nand even _Bruno_ had the resolution to say, when the Professor offered\r\nhim a fourth slice of plum-pudding, “I thinks three helpings is enough!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Professor started as if he had been electrified. “Why, I\r\nhad nearly forgotten the most important part of the entertainment! The\r\nOther Professor is to recite a Tale of a Pig—I mean a Pig-Tale,” he\r\ncorrected himself. “It has Introductory Verses at the beginning, and at\r\nthe end.”\r\n\r\n“It ca’n’t have Introductory Verses at the _end_, can it?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Wait till you hear it,” said the Professor: “then you’ll see. I’m not\r\nsure it hasn’t some in the _middle_, as well.” Here he rose to his feet,\r\nand there was an instant silence through the Banqueting-Hall: they\r\nevidently expected a speech.\r\n\r\n“Ladies, and gentlemen,” the Professor began, “the Other Professor is so\r\nkind as to recite a Poem. The title of it is ‘The Pig-Tale.’ He never\r\nrecited it before!” (General cheering among the guests.) “He will never\r\nrecite it again!” (Frantic excitement, and wild cheering all down the\r\nhall, the Professor himself mounting the table in hot haste, to lead the\r\ncheering, and waving his spectacles in one hand and a spoon in the\r\nother.)\r\n\r\nThen the Other Professor got up, and began:—\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are dining\r\n      Warily and well,\r\n      Hid in mossy cell:\r\n  Hid, I say, by waiters\r\n  Gorgeous in their gaiters—\r\n      I’ve a Tale to tell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘TEACHING TIGRESSES TO SMILE’]\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are feeding\r\n      Justices with jam,\r\n      Rich in frizzled ham:\r\n  Rich, I say, in oysters\r\n  Haunting shady cloisters—\r\n      That is what I am.\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are teaching\r\n      Tigresses to smile,\r\n      Innocent of guile:\r\n  Smile, I say, not smirkle—\r\n  Mouth a semicircle,\r\n      That’s the proper style.\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are sleeping\r\n      All among the pins,\r\n      Where the loser wins:\r\n  Where, I say, he sneezes\r\n  When and how he pleases—\r\n      So the Tale begins.\r\n\r\n  There was a Pig that sat alone\r\n    Beside a ruined Pump:\r\n  By day and night he made his moan—\r\n  It would have stirred a heart of stone\r\n  To see him wring his hoofs and groan,\r\n    Because he could not jump.\r\n\r\n  A certain Camel heard him shout—\r\n    A Camel with a hump.\r\n  “Oh, is it Grief, or is it Gout?\r\n  What is this bellowing about?”\r\n  That Pig replied, with quivering snout,\r\n    “Because I cannot jump!”\r\n\r\n  That Camel scanned him, dreamy-eyed.\r\n    “Methinks you are too plump.\r\n  I never knew a Pig so wide—\r\n  That wobbled so from side to side—\r\n  Who could, however much he tried,\r\n    Do such a thing as _jump_!\r\n\r\n  “Yet mark those trees, two miles away,\r\n    All clustered in a clump:\r\n  If you could trot there twice a day,\r\n  Nor ever pause for rest or play,\r\n  In the far future—Who can say?—\r\n    You may be fit to jump.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘HORRID WAS THAT PIG’S DESPAIR!’]\r\n\r\n  That Camel passed, and left him there,\r\n    Beside the ruined Pump.\r\n  Oh, horrid was that Pig’s despair!\r\n  His shrieks of anguish filled the air.\r\n  He wrung his hoofs, he rent his hair,\r\n    Because he could not jump.\r\n\r\n  There was a Frog that wandered by—\r\n    A sleek and shining lump:\r\n  Inspected him with fishy eye,\r\n  And said “O Pig, what makes you cry?”\r\n  And bitter was that Pig’s reply,\r\n    “Because I cannot jump!”\r\n\r\n  That Frog he grinned a grin of glee,\r\n    And hit his chest a thump\r\n  “O Pig,” said, “be ruled by me,\r\n  And you shall see what you shall see.\r\n  This minute, for a trifling fee,\r\n    I’ll teach you how to jump!\r\n\r\n  “You may be faint from many a fall,\r\n    And bruised by many a bump:\r\n  But, if you persevere through all,\r\n  And practise first on something small,\r\n  Concluding with a ten-foot wall,\r\n    You’ll find that you can jump!”\r\n\r\n  That Pig looked up with joyful start:\r\n    “Oh Frog, you _are_ a trump!\r\n  Your words have healed my inward smart—\r\n  Come, name your fee and do your part:\r\n  Bring comfort to a broken heart,\r\n    By teaching me to jump!”\r\n\r\n  “My fee shall be a mutton-chop,\r\n    My goal this ruined Pump.\r\n  Observe with what an airy flop\r\n  I plant myself upon the top!\r\n  Now bend your knees and take a hop,\r\n    For that’s the way to jump!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FATAL JUMP]\r\n\r\n  Uprose that Pig, and rushed, full whack,\r\n    Against the ruined Pump:\r\n  Rolled over like an empty sack,\r\n  And settled down upon his back,\r\n  While all his bones at once went ‘Crack!’\r\n    It was a fatal jump.\r\n\r\nWhen the Other Professor had recited this Verse, he went across to the\r\nfire-place, and put his head up the chimney. In doing this, he lost his\r\nbalance, and fell head-first into the empty grate, and got so firmly\r\nfixed there that it was some time before he could be dragged out again.\r\n\r\nBruno had had time to say “I thought he wanted to see how many peoples\r\nwas up the chimbley.”\r\n\r\nAnd Sylvie had said “_Chimney_—not chimbley.”\r\n\r\nAnd Bruno had said “Don’t talk ’ubbish!”\r\n\r\nAll this, while the Other Professor was being extracted.\r\n\r\n“You must have blacked your face!” the Empress said anxiously. “Let me\r\nsend for some soap?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, no,” said the Other Professor, keeping his face turned away.\r\n“Black’s quite a respectable colour. Besides, soap would be no use\r\nwithout water.”\r\n\r\nKeeping his back well turned away from the audience, he went on with the\r\nIntroductory Verses:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘BATHING CROCODILES IN CREAM’]\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are writing\r\n      Interesting books,\r\n      To be read by cooks:\r\n  Read, I say, not roasted—\r\n  Letterpress, when toasted,\r\n      Loses its good looks.\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are playing\r\n      Bagpipes on the shore,\r\n      Where the tourists snore:\r\n  “Thanks!” they cry. “’Tis thrilling!\r\n  Take, oh take this shilling!\r\n      Let us have no more!”\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are bathing\r\n      Crocodiles in cream,\r\n      Like a happy dream:\r\n  Like, but not so lasting—\r\n  Crocodiles, when fasting,\r\n      Are not all they seem!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘THAT PIG LAY STILL AS ANY STONE’]\r\n\r\n  That Camel passed, as Day grew dim\r\n    Around the ruined Pump.\r\n  “O broken heart! O broken limb!\r\n  It needs,” that Camel said to him,\r\n  “Something more fairy-like and slim,\r\n    To execute a jump!”\r\n\r\n  That Pig lay still as any stone,\r\n    And could not stir a stump:\r\n  Nor ever, if the truth were known,\r\n  Was he again observed to moan,\r\n  Nor ever wring his hoofs and groan,\r\n    Because he could not jump.\r\n\r\n  That Frog made no remark, for he\r\n    Was dismal as a dump:\r\n  He knew the consequence must be\r\n  That he would never get his fee—\r\n  And still he sits, in miserie,\r\n    Upon that ruined Pump!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘STILL HE SITS IN MISERIE’]\r\n\r\n“It’s a miserable story!” said Bruno. “It begins miserably, and it ends\r\nmiserablier. I think I shall cry. Sylvie, please lend me your\r\nhandkerchief.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t got it with me,” Sylvie whispered.\r\n\r\n“Then I won’t cry,” said Bruno manfully.\r\n\r\n“There are more Introductory Verses to come,” said the Other Professor,\r\n“but I’m hungry.” He sat down, cut a large slice of cake, put it on\r\nBruno’s plate, and gazed at his own empty plate in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Where did you get that cake?” Sylvie whispered to Bruno.\r\n\r\n“He gived it me,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“But you shouldn’t ask for things! You _know_ you shouldn’t!”\r\n\r\n“I _didn’t_ ask,” said Bruno, taking a fresh mouthful: “he _gived_ it\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nSylvie considered this for a moment: then she saw her way out of it.\r\n“Well, then, ask him to give _me_ some!”\r\n\r\n“You seem to enjoy that cake?” the Professor remarked.\r\n\r\n“Doos that mean ‘munch’?” Bruno whispered to Sylvie.\r\n\r\nSylvie nodded. “It means ‘to munch’ and ‘to _like_ to munch.’”\r\n\r\nBruno smiled at the Professor. “I _doos_ enjoy it,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor caught the word. “And I hope you’re enjoying\r\n_yourself_, little Man?” he enquired.\r\n\r\nBruno’s look of horror quite startled him. “No, _indeed_ I aren’t!” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor looked thoroughly puzzled. “Well, well!” he said.\r\n“Try some cowslip wine!” And he filled a glass and handed it to Bruno.\r\n“Drink this, my dear, and you’ll be quite another man!”\r\n\r\n“Who shall I be?” said Bruno, pausing in the act of putting it to his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n“Don’t ask so many questions!” Sylvie interposed, anxious to save the\r\npoor old man from further bewilderment. “Suppose we get the Professor to\r\ntell us a story.”\r\n\r\nBruno adopted the idea with enthusiasm. “_Please_ do!” he cried eagerly.\r\n“Sumfin about tigers—and bumble-bees—and robin-redbreasts, oo knows!”\r\n\r\n“Why should you always have _live_ things in stories?” said the\r\nProfessor. “Why don’t you have events, or circumstances?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _please_ invent a story like that!” cried Bruno.\r\n\r\nThe Professor began fluently enough. “Once a coincidence was taking a\r\nwalk with a little accident, and they met an explanation—a _very_ old\r\nexplanation—so old that it was quite doubled up, and looked more like a\r\nconundrum——” he broke off suddenly.\r\n\r\n“_Please_ go on!” both children exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe Professor made a candid confession. “It’s a very difficult sort to\r\ninvent, I find. Suppose Bruno tells one, first.”\r\n\r\nBruno was only too happy to adopt the suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Once there were a Pig, and a Accordion, and two Jars of\r\nOrange-marmalade——”\r\n\r\n“The _dramatis personæ_,” murmured the Professor. “Well, what then?”\r\n\r\n“So, when the Pig played on the Accordion,” Bruno went on, “one of the\r\nJars of Orange-marmalade didn’t like the tune, and the other Jar of\r\nOrange-marmalade did like the tune—I _know_ I shall get confused among\r\nthose Jars of Orange-marmalade, Sylvie!” he whispered anxiously.\r\n\r\n“I will now recite the other Introductory Verses,” said the Other\r\nProfessor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘BLESSED BY HAPPY STAGS’]\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are choking\r\n      Baronets with bun,\r\n      Taught to fire a gun:\r\n  Taught, I say, to splinter\r\n  Salmon in the winter—\r\n      Merely for the fun.\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are hiding\r\n      Crimes in carpet-bags,\r\n      Blessed by happy stags:\r\n  Blessed, I say, though beaten—\r\n  Since our friends are eaten\r\n      When the memory flags.\r\n\r\n  Little Birds are tasting\r\n      Gratitude and gold,\r\n      Pale with sudden cold\r\n  Pale, I say, and wrinkled—\r\n  When the bells have tinkled\r\n      And the Tale is told.\r\n\r\n“The next thing to be done,” the Professor cheerfully remarked to the\r\nLord Chancellor, as soon as the applause, caused by the recital of the\r\nPig-Tale, had come to an end, “is to drink the Emperor’s health, is it\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly!” the Lord Chancellor replied with much solemnity, as he\r\nrose to his feet to give the necessary directions for the ceremony.\r\n“Fill your glasses!” he thundered. All did so, instantly. “Drink the\r\nEmperor’s health!” A general gurgling resounded all through the Hall.\r\n“Three cheers for the Emperor!” The faintest possible sound followed\r\n_this_ announcement: and the Chancellor, with admirable presence of\r\nmind, instantly proclaimed “A speech from the Emperor!”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had begun his speech almost before the words were uttered.\r\n“However unwilling to be Emperor—since you all wish me to be Emperor—you\r\nknow how badly the late Warden managed things—with such enthusiasm as\r\nyou have shown—he persecuted you—he taxed you too heavily—you know who\r\nis fittest man to be Emperor—my brother had no sense——.”\r\n\r\nHow long this curious speech might have lasted it is impossible to say,\r\nfor just at this moment a hurricane shook the palace to its foundations,\r\nbursting open the windows, extinguishing some of the lamps, and filling\r\nthe air with clouds of dust, which took strange shapes in the air, and\r\nseemed to form words.\r\n\r\nBut the storm subsided as suddenly as it had risen—the casements swung\r\ninto their places again: the dust vanished: all was as it had been a\r\nminute ago—with the exception of the Emperor and Empress, over whom had\r\ncome a wondrous change. The vacant stare, the meaningless smile, had\r\npassed away: all could see that these two strange beings had returned to\r\ntheir senses.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor continued his speech as if there had been no interruption.\r\n“And we have behaved—my wife and I—like two arrant Knaves. We deserve no\r\nbetter name. When my brother went away, you lost the best Warden you\r\never had. And I’ve been doing my best, wretched hypocrite that I am, to\r\ncheat you into making me an Emperor. Me! One that has hardly got the\r\nwits to be a shoe-black!”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor wrung his hands in despair. “He is mad, good\r\npeople!” he was beginning. But both speeches stopped suddenly—and, in\r\nthe dead silence that followed, a knocking was heard at the outer door.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” was the general cry. People began running in and out. The\r\nexcitement increased every moment. The Lord Chancellor, forgetting all\r\nthe rules of Court-ceremony, ran full speed down the hall, and in a\r\nminute returned, pale and gasping for breath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n                          THE BEGGAR’S RETURN.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Your Imperial Highnesses!” he began. “It’s the old Beggar again! Shall\r\nwe set the dogs at him?”\r\n\r\n“Bring him here!” said the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor could scarcely believe his ears. “_Here_, your Imperial\r\nHighness? Did I rightly understand——.”\r\n\r\n“Bring him here!” the Emperor thundered once more. The Chancellor\r\ntottered down the hall—and in another minute the crowd divided, and the\r\npoor old Beggar was seen entering the Banqueting-Hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD BEGGAR’S RETURN]\r\n\r\nHe was indeed a pitiable object: the rags, that hung about him, were all\r\nsplashed with mud: his white hair and his long beard were tossed about\r\nin wild disorder. Yet he walked upright, with a stately tread, as if\r\nused to command: and—strangest sight of all—Sylvie and Bruno came with\r\nhim, clinging to his hands, and gazing at him with looks of silent love.\r\n\r\nMen looked eagerly to see how the Emperor would receive the bold\r\nintruder. Would he hurl him from the steps of the daïs? But no. To their\r\nutter astonishment, the Emperor knelt as the beggar approached, and with\r\nbowed head murmured “Forgive us!”\r\n\r\n“Forgive us!” the Empress, kneeling at her husband’s side, meekly\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nThe Outcast smiled. “Rise up!” he said. “I forgive you!” And men saw\r\nwith wonder that a change had passed over the old beggar, even as he\r\nspoke. What had seemed, but now, to be vile rags and splashes of mud,\r\nwere seen to be in truth kingly trappings, broidered with gold, and\r\nsparkling with gems. All knew him now, and bent low before the Elder\r\nBrother, the true Warden.\r\n\r\n“Brother mine, and Sister mine!” the Warden began, in a clear voice that\r\nwas heard all through that vast hall. “I come not to disturb you. Rule\r\non, as Emperor, and rule wisely. For I am chosen King of Elfland.\r\nTo-morrow I return there, taking nought from hence, save only—save\r\nonly——” his voice trembled, and with a look of ineffable tenderness, he\r\nlaid his hands in silence on the heads of the two little ones who clung\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nBut he recovered himself in a moment, and beckoned to the Emperor to\r\nresume his place at the table. The company seated themselves again—room\r\nbeing found for the Elfin-King between his two children—and the Lord\r\nChancellor rose once more, to propose the next toast.\r\n\r\n“The next toast—the hero of the day—why, he isn’t here!” he broke off in\r\nwild confusion.\r\n\r\nGood gracious! Everybody had forgotten Prince Uggug!\r\n\r\n“He was told of the Banquet, of course?” said the Emperor.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly!” replied the Chancellor. “_That_ would be the duty of the\r\nGold Stick in Waiting.”\r\n\r\n“Let the Gold Stick come forwards!” the Emperor gravely said.\r\n\r\nThe Gold Stick came forwards. “I attended on His Imperial Fatness,” was\r\nthe statement made by the trembling official. “I told him of the Lecture\r\nand the Banquet——.”\r\n\r\n“What followed?” said the Emperor: for the unhappy man seemed almost too\r\nfrightened to go on.\r\n\r\n“His Imperial Fatness was graciously pleased to be sulky. His Imperial\r\nFatness was graciously pleased to box my ears. His Imperial Fatness was\r\ngraciously pleased to say ‘I don’t care!’”\r\n\r\n“‘Don’t-care’ came to a bad end,” Sylvie whispered to Bruno. “I’m not\r\nsure, but I _believe_ he was hanged.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor overheard her. “_That_ result,” he blandly remarked, “was\r\nmerely a case of mistaken identity.”\r\n\r\nBoth children looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Permit me to explain. ‘Don’t-care’ and ‘Care’ were twin-brothers.\r\n‘Care,’ you know, killed the Cat. And they caught ‘Don’t-care’ by\r\nmistake, and hanged him instead. And so ‘Care’ is alive still. But he’s\r\nvery unhappy without his brother. That’s why they say ‘Begone, dull\r\nCare!’”\r\n\r\n“Thank you!” Sylvie said, heartily. “It’s very extremely interesting.\r\nWhy, it seems to explain _everything_!”\r\n\r\n“Well, not quite _everything_,” the Professor modestly rejoined. “There\r\nare two or three scientific difficulties——”\r\n\r\n“What was your general impression as to His Imperial Fatness?” the\r\nEmperor asked the Gold Stick.\r\n\r\n“My impression was that His Imperial Fatness was getting more——”\r\n\r\n“More _what_?”\r\n\r\nAll listened breathlessly for the next word.\r\n\r\n“More PRICKLY!”\r\n\r\n“He must be sent for _at once_!” the Emperor exclaimed. And the Gold\r\nStick went off like a shot. The Elfin-King sadly shook his head. “No\r\nuse, no use!” he murmured to himself. “Loveless, loveless!”\r\n\r\nPale, trembling, speechless, the Gold Stick came slowly back again.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said the Emperor. “Why does not the Prince appear?”\r\n\r\n“One can easily guess,” said the Professor. “His Imperial Fatness is,\r\nwithout doubt, a little preoccupied.”\r\n\r\nBruno turned a look of solemn enquiry on his old friend. “What do that\r\nword mean?”\r\n\r\nBut the Professor took no notice of the question. He was eagerly\r\nlistening to the Gold Stick’s reply.\r\n\r\n“Please your Highness! His Imperial Fatness is——” Not a word more could\r\nhe utter.\r\n\r\nThe Empress rose in an agony of alarm. “Let us go to him!” she cried.\r\nAnd there was a general rush for the door.\r\n\r\nBruno slipped off his chair in a moment. “May we go too?” he eagerly\r\nasked. But the King did not hear the question, as the Professor was\r\nspeaking to him. “_Preoccupied_, your Majesty!” he was saying. “That is\r\nwhat he is, no doubt!”\r\n\r\n“May we go and see him?” Bruno repeated. The King nodded assent, and the\r\nchildren ran off. In a minute or two they returned, slowly and gravely.\r\n“Well?” said the King. “What’s the matter with the Prince?”\r\n\r\n“He’s—what _you_ said,” Bruno replied, looking at the Professor. “That\r\nhard word.” And he looked to Sylvie for assistance.\r\n\r\n“Porcupine,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“No, no!” the Professor corrected her. “‘_Pre-occupied_,’ you mean.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘PORCUPINE!’]\r\n\r\n“No, it’s _porcupine_,” persisted Sylvie. “Not that other word at all.\r\nAnd please will you come? The house is all in an uproar.” (“And oo’d\r\nbetter bring an uproar-glass wiz oo!” added Bruno.)\r\n\r\nWe got up in great haste, and followed the children upstairs. No one\r\ntook the least notice of _me_, but I wasn’t at all surprised at this, as\r\nI had long realised that I was quite invisible to them all—even to\r\nSylvie and Bruno.\r\n\r\nAll along the gallery, that led to the Prince’s apartment, an excited\r\ncrowd was surging to and fro, and the Babel of voices was deafening:\r\nagainst the door of the room three strong men were leaning, vainly\r\ntrying to shut it—for some great animal inside was constantly bursting\r\nit half open, and we had a glimpse, before the men could push it back\r\nagain, of the head of a furious wild beast, with great fiery eyes and\r\ngnashing teeth. Its voice was a sort of mixture—there was the roaring of\r\na lion, and the bellowing of a bull, and now and then a scream like a\r\ngigantic parrot. “There is no judging by the voice!” the Professor cried\r\nin great excitement. “What is it?” he shouted to the men at the door.\r\nAnd a general chorus of voices answered him “Porcupine! Prince Uggug has\r\nturned into a Porcupine!”\r\n\r\n“A new Specimen!” exclaimed the delighted Professor. “Pray let me go in.\r\nIt should be labeled at once!”\r\n\r\nBut the strong men only pushed him back. “Label it, indeed! Do you want\r\nto be eaten up?” they cried.\r\n\r\n“Never mind about Specimens, Professor!” said the Emperor, pushing his\r\nway through the crowd. “Tell us how to keep him safe!”\r\n\r\n“A large cage!” the Professor promptly replied. “Bring a large cage,” he\r\nsaid to the people generally, “with strong bars of steel, and a\r\nportcullis made to go up and down like a mouse-trap! Does any one happen\r\nto have such a thing about him?”\r\n\r\nIt didn’t sound a likely sort of thing for any one to have about him;\r\nhowever, they brought him one directly: curiously enough, there happened\r\nto be one standing in the gallery.\r\n\r\n“Put it facing the opening of the door, and draw up the portcullis!”\r\nThis was done in a moment.\r\n\r\n“Blankets now!” cried the Professor. “This is a most interesting\r\nExperiment!”\r\n\r\nThere happened to be a pile of blankets close by: and the Professor had\r\nhardly said the word, when they were all unfolded and held up like\r\ncurtains all around. The Professor rapidly arranged them in two rows, so\r\nas to make a dark passage, leading straight from the door to the mouth\r\nof the cage.\r\n\r\n“Now fling the door open!” This did not need to be done: the three men\r\nhad only to leap out of the way, and the fearful monster flung the door\r\nopen for itself, and, with a yell like the whistle of a steam-engine,\r\nrushed into the cage.\r\n\r\n“Down with the portcullis!” No sooner said than done: and all breathed\r\nfreely once more, on seeing the Porcupine safely caged.\r\n\r\nThe Professor rubbed his hands in childish delight. “The Experiment has\r\nsucceeded!” he proclaimed. “All that is needed now is to feed it three\r\ntimes a day, on chopped carrots and——.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind about its food, just now!” the Emperor interrupted. “Let us\r\nreturn to the Banquet. Brother, will you lead the way?” And the old man,\r\nattended by his children, headed the procession down stairs. “See the\r\nfate of a loveless life!” he said to Bruno, as they returned to their\r\nplaces. To which Bruno made reply, “I always loved Sylvie, so I’ll never\r\nget prickly like that!”\r\n\r\n“He _is_ prickly, certainly,” said the Professor, who had caught the\r\nlast words, “but we must remember that, however porcupiny, he is royal\r\nstill! After this feast is over, I’m going to take a little present to\r\nPrince Uggug—just to soothe him, you know: it isn’t pleasant living in a\r\ncage.”\r\n\r\n“What’ll you give him for a birthday-present?” Bruno enquired.\r\n\r\n“A small saucer of chopped carrots,” replied the Professor. “In giving\r\nbirthday-presents, _my_ motto is—cheapness! I should think I save forty\r\npounds a year by giving—oh, _what_ a twinge of pain!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” said Sylvie anxiously.\r\n\r\n“My old enemy!” groaned the Professor. “Lumbago—rheumatism—that sort of\r\nthing. I think I’ll go and lie down a bit.” And he hobbled out of the\r\nSaloon, watched by the pitying eyes of the two children.\r\n\r\n“He’ll be better soon!” the Elfin-King said cheerily. “Brother!” turning\r\nto the Emperor, “I have some business to arrange with you to-night. The\r\nEmpress will take care of the children.” And the two Brothers went away\r\ntogether, arm-in-arm.\r\n\r\nThe Empress found the children rather sad company. They could talk of\r\nnothing but “the dear Professor,” and “what a pity he’s so ill!”, till\r\nat last she made the welcome proposal “Let’s go and see him!”\r\n\r\nThe children eagerly grasped the hands she offered them: and we went off\r\nto the Professor’s study, and found him lying on the sofa, covered up\r\nwith blankets, and reading a little manuscript-book. “Notes on Vol.\r\nThree!” he murmured, looking up at us. And there, on a table near him,\r\nlay the book he was seeking when first I saw him.\r\n\r\n“And how are you now, Professor?” the Empress asked, bending over the\r\ninvalid.\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked up, and smiled feebly. “As devoted to your Imperial\r\nHighness as ever!” he said in a weak voice. “All of me, that is not\r\nLumbago, is Loyalty!”\r\n\r\n“A sweet sentiment!” the Empress exclaimed with tears in her eyes. “You\r\nseldom hear anything so beautiful as that—even in a Valentine!”\r\n\r\n“We must take you to stay at the seaside,” Sylvie said, tenderly. “It’ll\r\ndo you ever so much good! And the Sea’s so grand!”\r\n\r\n“But a Mountain’s grander!” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“What is there grand about the Sea?” said the Professor. “Why, you could\r\nput it all into a teacup!”\r\n\r\n“_Some_ of it,” Sylvie corrected him.\r\n\r\n“Well, you’d only want a certain number of tea-cups to hold it _all_.\r\nAnd _then_ where’s the grandeur? Then as to a Mountain—why, you could\r\ncarry it all away in a wheel-barrow, in a certain number of years!”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t look grand—the bits of it in the wheel-barrow,” Sylvie\r\ncandidly admitted.\r\n\r\n“But when oo put it together again——” Bruno began.\r\n\r\n“When you’re older,” said the Professor, “you’ll know that you _ca’n’t_\r\nput Mountains together again so easily! One lives and one learns, you\r\nknow!”\r\n\r\n“But it needn’t be the _same_ one, need it?” said Bruno. “Won’t it do,\r\nif _I_ live, and if _Sylvie_ learns?”\r\n\r\n“I _ca’n’t_ learn without living!” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“But I _can_ live without learning!” Bruno retorted. “Oo just try me!”\r\n\r\n“What I meant, was—” the Professor began, looking much puzzled,\r\n“—was—that you don’t know _everything_, you know.”\r\n\r\n“But I _do_ know everything I know!” persisted the little fellow. “I\r\nknow ever so many things! Everything, ’cept the things I _don’t_ know.\r\nAnd Sylvie knows all the rest.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor sighed, and gave it up. “Do you know what a Boojum is?”\r\n\r\n“_I_ know!” cried Bruno. “It’s the thing what wrenches people out of\r\ntheir boots!”\r\n\r\n“He means ‘bootjack,’” Sylvie explained in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“You ca’n’t wrench people out of _boots_,” the Professor mildly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nBruno laughed saucily. “Oo _can_, though! Unless they’re _welly_ tight\r\nin.”\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time there was a Boojum——” the Professor began, but stopped\r\nsuddenly. “I forget the rest of the Fable,” he said. “And there was a\r\nlesson to be learned from it. I’m afraid I forget _that_, too.”\r\n\r\n“_I’ll_ tell oo a Fable!” Bruno began in a great hurry. “Once there were\r\na Locust, and a Magpie, and a Engine-driver. And the Lesson is, to learn\r\nto get up early——”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a bit interesting!” Sylvie said contemptuously. “You shouldn’t\r\nput the Lesson so soon.”\r\n\r\n“When did you invent that Fable?” said the Professor. “Last week?”\r\n\r\n“No!” said Bruno. “A deal shorter ago than that. Guess again!”\r\n\r\n“I ca’n’t guess,” said the Professor. “How long ago?”\r\n\r\n“Why, it isn’t invented yet!” Bruno exclaimed triumphantly. “But I\r\n_have_ invented a lovely one! Shall I say it?”\r\n\r\n“If you’ve _finished_ inventing it,” said Sylvie. “And let the Lesson be\r\n‘to try again’!”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bruno with great decision. “The Lesson are ‘_not_ to try\r\nagain’!” “Once there were a lovely china man, what stood on the\r\nchimbley-piece. And he stood, and he stood. And one day he tumbleded\r\noff, and he didn’t hurt his self one bit. Only he _would_ try again. And\r\nthe next time he tumbleded off, he hurted his self welly much, and\r\nbreaked off ever so much varnish.”\r\n\r\n“But how did he come back on the chimney-piece after his first tumble?”\r\nsaid the Empress. (It was the first sensible question she had asked in\r\nall her life.)\r\n\r\n“_I_ put him there!” cried Bruno.\r\n\r\n“Then I’m afraid you know something about his tumbling,” said the\r\nProfessor. “Perhaps you pushed him?”\r\n\r\nTo which Bruno replied, very seriously, “Didn’t pushed him _much_—he\r\nwere a _lovely_ china man,” he added hastily, evidently very anxious to\r\nchange the subject.\r\n\r\n“Come, my children!” said the Elfin-King, who had just entered the room.\r\n“We must have a little chat together, before you go to bed.” And he was\r\nleading them away, but at the door they let go his hands, and ran back\r\nagain to wish the Professor good night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘GOOD-NIGHT, PROFESSOR!’]\r\n\r\n“Good night, Professor, good night!” And Bruno solemnly shook hands with\r\nthe old man, who gazed at him with a loving smile, while Sylvie bent\r\ndown to press her sweet lips upon his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Good night, little ones!” said the Professor. “You may leave me now—to\r\nruminate. I’m as jolly as the day is long, except when it’s necessary to\r\nruminate on some very difficult subject. All of me,” he murmured\r\nsleepily as we left the room, “all of me, that isn’t _Bonhommie_, is\r\nRumination!”\r\n\r\n“_What_ did he say, Bruno?” Sylvie enquired, as soon as we were safely\r\nout of hearing.\r\n\r\n“I _think_ he said ‘All of me that isn’t Bone-disease is Rheumatism.’\r\nWhatever _are_ that knocking, Sylvie?”\r\n\r\nSylvie stopped, and listened anxiously. It sounded like some one kicking\r\nat a door. “I _hope_ it isn’t that Porcupine breaking loose!” she\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go on!” Bruno said hastily. “There’s nuffin to wait for, oo\r\nknow!“\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n                           LIFE OUT OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sound of kicking, or knocking, grew louder every moment: and at last\r\na door opened somewhere near us. “Did you say ‘come in!’ Sir?” my\r\nlandlady asked timidly.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, come in!” I replied. “What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“A note has just been left for you, Sir, by the baker’s boy. He said he\r\nwas passing the Hall, and they asked him to come round and leave it\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nThe note contained five words only. “Please come at once. Muriel.”\r\n\r\nA sudden terror seemed to chill my very heart. “The Earl is ill!” I said\r\nto myself. “Dying, perhaps!” And I hastily prepared to leave the house.\r\n\r\n“No bad news, Sir, I hope?” my landlady said, as she saw me out. “The\r\nboy said as some one had arrived unexpectedly——.”\r\n\r\n“I hope that is it!” I said. But my feelings were those of fear rather\r\nthan of hope: though, on entering the house, I was somewhat reassured by\r\nfinding luggage lying in the entrance, bearing the initials “E. L.”\r\n\r\n“It’s only Eric Lindon after all!” I thought, half relieved and half\r\nannoyed. “Surely she need not have sent for me for _that_!”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel met me in the passage. Her eyes were gleaming—but it was the\r\nexcitement of joy, rather than of grief. “I have a surprise for you!”\r\nshe whispered.\r\n\r\n“You mean that Eric Lindon is here?” I said, vainly trying to disguise\r\nthe involuntary bitterness of my tone. “‘_The funeral baked meats did\r\ncoldly furnish forth the marriage-tables_,’” I could not help repeating\r\nto myself. How cruelly I was misjudging her!\r\n\r\n“No, no!” she eagerly replied. “At least—Eric _is_ here. But——,” her\r\nvoice quivered, “but there is _another_!”\r\n\r\nNo need for further question. I eagerly followed her in. There on the\r\nbed, he lay—pale and worn—the mere shadow of his old self—my old friend\r\ncome back again from the dead!\r\n\r\n“Arthur!” I exclaimed. I could not say another word.\r\n\r\n“Yes, back again, old boy!” he murmured, smiling as I grasped his hand.\r\n“_He_,” indicating Eric, who stood near, “saved my life—_He_ brought me\r\nback. Next to God, we must thank _him_, Muriel, my wife!”\r\n\r\nSilently I shook hands with Eric and with the Earl: and with one consent\r\nwe moved into the shaded side of the room, where we could talk without\r\ndisturbing the invalid, who lay, silent and happy, holding his wife’s\r\nhand in his, and watching her with eyes that shone with the deep steady\r\nlight of Love.\r\n\r\n“He has been delirious till to-day,” Eric explained in a low voice: “and\r\neven to-day he has been wandering more than once. But the sight of _her_\r\nhas been new life to him.” And then he went on to tell us, in would-be\r\ncareless tones—I knew how he hated any display of feeling—how he had\r\ninsisted on going back to the plague-stricken town, to bring away a man\r\nwhom the doctor had abandoned as dying, but who _might_, he fancied,\r\nrecover if brought to the hospital: how he had seen nothing in the\r\nwasted features to remind him of Arthur, and only recognised him when he\r\nvisited the hospital a month after: how the doctor had forbidden him to\r\nannounce the discovery, saying that any shock to the over taxed brain\r\nmight kill him at once: how he had staid on at the hospital, and nursed\r\nthe sick man by night and day—all this with the studied indifference of\r\none who is relating the commonplace acts of some chance acquaintance!\r\n\r\n“And this was his _rival_!” I thought. “The man who had won from him the\r\nheart of the woman he loved!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘HIS WIFE KNELT DOWN AT HIS SIDE’]\r\n\r\n“The sun is setting,” said Lady Muriel, rising and leading the way to\r\nthe open window. “Just look at the western sky! What lovely crimson\r\ntints! We shall have a glorious day to-morrow——” We had followed her\r\nacross the room, and were standing in a little group, talking in low\r\ntones in the gathering gloom, when we were startled by the voice of the\r\nsick man, murmuring words too indistinct for the ear to catch.\r\n\r\n“He is wandering again,” Lady Muriel whispered, and returned to the\r\nbedside. We drew a little nearer also: but no, this had none of the\r\nincoherence of delirium. “_What reward shall I give unto the Lord_,” the\r\ntremulous lips were saying, “_for all the benefits that He hath done\r\nunto me? I will receive the cup of salvation, and call—and call_——” but\r\nhere the poor weakened memory failed, and the feeble voice died into\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nHis wife knelt down at the bedside, raised one of his arms, and drew it\r\nacross her own, fondly kissing the thin white hand that lay so\r\nlistlessly in her loving grasp. It seemed to me a good opportunity for\r\nstealing away without making her go through any form of parting: so,\r\nnodding to the Earl and Eric, I silently left the room. Eric followed me\r\ndown the stairs, and out into the night.\r\n\r\n“Is it Life or Death?” I asked him, as soon as we were far enough from\r\nthe house for me to speak in ordinary tones.\r\n\r\n“It is _Life_!” he replied with eager emphasis. “The doctors are quite\r\nagreed as to _that_. All he needs now, they say, is rest, and perfect\r\nquiet, and good nursing. He’s quite sure to get rest and quiet, here:\r\nand, as for the nursing why, I think it’s just _possible_——” (he tried\r\nhard to make his trembling voice assume a playful tone) “he may even get\r\nfairly well nursed, in his present quarters!”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure of it!” I said. “Thank you so much for coming out to tell me!”\r\nAnd, thinking he had now said all he had come to say, I held out my hand\r\nto bid him good night. He grasped it warmly, and added, turning his face\r\naway as he spoke, “By the way, there is one other thing I wanted to say.\r\nI thought you’d like to know that—that I’m not—not in the mind I was in\r\nwhen last we met. It isn’t—that I can accept Christian belief—at least,\r\nnot yet. But all this came about so strangely. And she had prayed, you\r\nknow. And I had prayed. And—and—” his voice broke, and I could only just\r\ncatch the concluding words, “_there is a God that answers prayer!_ I\r\nknow it for certain now.” He wrung my hand once more, and left me\r\nsuddenly. Never before had I seen him so deeply moved.\r\n\r\nSo, in the gathering twilight, I paced slowly homewards, in a tumultuous\r\nwhirl of happy thoughts: my heart seemed full, and running over, with\r\njoy and thankfulness: all that I had so fervently longed for, and prayed\r\nfor, seemed now to have come to pass. And, though I reproached myself,\r\nbitterly, for the unworthy suspicion I had for one moment harboured\r\nagainst the true-hearted Lady Muriel, I took comfort in knowing it had\r\nbeen but a passing thought.\r\n\r\nNot Bruno himself could have mounted the stairs with so buoyant a step,\r\nas I felt my way up in the dark, not pausing to strike a light in the\r\nentry, as I knew I had left the lamp burning in my sitting-room.\r\n\r\nBut it was no common _lamplight_ into which I now stepped, with a\r\nstrange, new, dreamy sensation of some subtle witchery that had come\r\nover the place. Light, richer and more golden than any lamp could give,\r\nflooded the room, streaming in from a window I had somehow never noticed\r\nbefore, and lighting up a group of three shadowy figures, that grew\r\nmomently more distinct—a grave old man in royal robes, leaning back in\r\nan easy chair, and two children, a girl and a boy, standing at his side.\r\n\r\n“Have you the Jewel still, my child?” the old man was saying.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _yes_!” Sylvie exclaimed with unusual eagerness. “Do you think I’d\r\n_ever_ lose it or forget it?” She undid the ribbon round her neck, as\r\nshe spoke, and laid the Jewel in her father’s hand.\r\n\r\nBruno looked at it admiringly. “What a lovely brightness!” he said.\r\n“It’s just like a little red star! May I take it in my hand?”\r\n\r\nSylvie nodded: and Bruno carried it off to the window, and held it aloft\r\nagainst the sky, whose deepening blue was already spangled with stars.\r\nSoon he came running back in some excitement. “Sylvie! Look here!” he\r\ncried. “I can see right through it when I hold it up to the sky. And it\r\nisn’t red a bit: it’s, oh such a lovely blue! And the words are all\r\ndifferent! Do look at it!”\r\n\r\nSylvie was quite excited, too, by this time; and the two children\r\neagerly held up the Jewel to the light, and spelled out the legend\r\nbetween them, “ALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLUE LOCKET]\r\n\r\n“Why, this is the _other_ Jewel!” cried Bruno. “Don’t you remember,\r\nSylvie? The one you _didn’t_ choose!”\r\n\r\nSylvie took it from him, with a puzzled look, and held it, now up to the\r\nlight, now down. “It’s blue, _one_ way,” she said softly to herself,\r\n“and it’s red, the _other_ way! Why, I thought there were _two_ of\r\nthem—Father!” she suddenly exclaimed, laying the Jewel once more in his\r\nhand, “I do believe it was the _same_ Jewel all the time!”\r\n\r\n“Then you choosed it from _itself_,” Bruno thoughtfully remarked.\r\n“Father, _could_ Sylvie choose a thing from itself?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my own one,” the old man replied to Sylvie, not noticing Bruno’s\r\nembarrassing question, “it _was_ the same Jewel—but you chose quite\r\nright.” And he fastened the ribbon round her neck again.\r\n\r\n“SYLVIE WILL LOVE ALL—ALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE,” Bruno murmured, raising\r\nhimself on tiptoe to kiss the ‘little red star.’ “And, when you look\r\n_at_ it, it’s red and fierce like the sun—and, when you look _through_\r\nit, it’s gentle and blue like the sky!”\r\n\r\n“God’s own sky,” Sylvie said, dreamily.\r\n\r\n“God’s own sky,” the little fellow repeated, as they stood, lovingly\r\nclinging together, and looking out into the night. “But oh, Sylvie, what\r\nmakes the sky such a _darling_ blue?”\r\n\r\nSylvie’s sweet lips shaped themselves to reply, but her voice sounded\r\nfaint and very far away. The vision was fast slipping from my eager\r\ngaze: but it seemed to me, in that last bewildering moment, that not\r\nSylvie but an angel was looking out through those trustful brown eyes,\r\nand that not Sylvie’s but an angel’s voice was whispering\r\n\r\n                             “It is love.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ‘IT IS LOVE!’]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GENERAL INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n[N.B. ‘I’ refers to “Sylvie and Bruno,” ‘II’ to “Sylvie and Bruno\r\nConcluded.”]\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n  Accelerated Velocity, causes of; II. 190\r\n  Air, Cotton-wool lighter than, how to obtain; II. 166\r\n  Animal-Suffering, mystery of; II. 296\r\n  Anti-Teetotal Card; II. 139\r\n  Artistic effect said to require Indistinctness; I. 241\r\n  Asylums, Lunatic-, future use for; II. 132\r\n  Axioms of Science; II. 330\r\n\r\n                                   B\r\n  Badgers, the Three (Poem); I. 247\r\n  Barometer, sideways motion of; I. 13\r\n  Baron Doppelgeist; I. 85\r\n  Bath, Portable, for Tourists; I. 25\r\n  Bazaars, Charity-; II. 44\r\n  Beauty, Pain of realising; II. 337\r\n  Bed, reason for never going to; II. 141\r\n  Bees, Mind of; II. 29\r\n  Bessie’s Song; II. 76\r\n  Bible-Selections for Children; I. xiii\r\n      ”    ”    learning by heart; I. xiv\r\n  Black Light, how to produce; II. 341\r\n  Boat, motion of, how to imitate on land; II. 108\r\n  Books, or Minds.

Our own age is\r\nmore fortunate, on this single score at least, having a larger and far\r\nnobler proportion of female writers; among whom, since the death of\r\nGeorge Eliot, there is none left whose touch is so exquisite and\r\nmasterly, whose love is so thoroughly according to knowledge, whose\r\nbright and sweet invention is so fruitful, so truthful, or so delightful\r\nas Mrs. Molesworth’s. Any chapter of _The Cuckoo Clock_ or the\r\nenchanting _Adventures of Herr Baby_ is worth a shoal of the very best\r\nnovels dealing with the characters and fortunes of mere adults.”—Mrs. A.\r\nC. Swinburne, in _The Nineteenth Century_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MRS. MOLESWORTH’S\r\n                         Stories for Children.\r\n\r\n“There is hardly a better author to put into the hands of children than\r\nMrs. Molesworth. I cannot easily speak too highly of her work. It is a\r\ncurious art she has, not wholly English in its spirit, but a cross of\r\nthe old English with the Italian. Indeed, I should say Mrs. Molesworth\r\nhad also been a close student of the German and Russian, and had some\r\nway, catching and holding the spirit of all, created a method and tone\r\nquite her own.... Her characters are admirable and real.”—_St. Louis\r\nGlobe-Democrat._\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth has a rare gift for composing stories for children.\r\nWith a light yet forcible touch, she paints sweet and artless, yet\r\nnatural and strong, characters.”—_Congregationalist._\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth always has in her books those charming touches of\r\nnature that are sure to charm small people. Her stories are so likely to\r\nhave been true that men ‘grown up’ do not disdain them.”—_Home Journal._\r\n\r\n“No English writer of childish stories has a better reputation than Mrs.\r\nMolesworth, and none with whose stories we are familiar deserves it\r\nbetter. She has a motherly knowledge of the child nature, a clear sense\r\nof character, the power of inventing simple incidents that interest, and\r\nthe ease which comes of continuous practice.”—_Mail and Express._\r\n\r\n“Christmas would hardly be Christmas without one of Mrs. Molesworth’s\r\nstories. No one has quite the same power of throwing a charm and an\r\ninterest about the most commonplace every-day doings as she has, and no\r\none has ever blended fairy-land and reality with the same\r\nskill.”—_Educational Times._\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth is justly a great favorite with children; her stories\r\nfor them are always charmingly interesting and healthful in\r\ntone.”—_Boston Home Journal._\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth’s books are cheery, wholesome, and particularly well\r\nadapted to refined life. It is safe to add that Mrs. Molesworth is the\r\nbest English prose writer for children.... A new volume from Mrs.\r\nMolesworth is always a treat.”—_The Beacon._\r\n\r\n“No holiday season would be complete for a host of young readers without\r\na volume from the hand of Mrs. Molesworth.... It is one of the\r\npeculiarities of Mrs. Molesworth’s stories that older readers can no\r\nmore escape their charm than younger ones.”—_Christian Union._\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth ranks with George Macdonald and Mrs. Ewing as a writer\r\nof children’s stories that possess real literary merit.”—_Milwaukee\r\nSentinel._\r\n\r\n                 THE SET, TEN VOLUMES, IN BOX, $10.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TELL ME A STORY, and HERR BABY.\r\n\r\n“So delightful that we are inclined to join in the petition, and we hope\r\nshe may soon tell us more stories.”—_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n\r\n                     “CARROTS”; Just a Little Boy.\r\n\r\n“One of the cleverest and most pleasing stories it has been our good\r\nfortune to meet with for some time. Carrots and his sister are\r\ndelightful little beings, whom to read about is at once to become very\r\nfond of.”—_Examiner._\r\n\r\n\r\n              A CHRISTMAS CHILD; A Sketch of a Boy’s Life.\r\n\r\n“A very sweet and tenderly drawn sketch, with life and reality manifest\r\nthroughout.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._\r\n\r\n“This is a capital story, well illustrated. Mrs. Molesworth is one of\r\nthose sunny, genial writers who has genius for writing acceptably for\r\nthe young. She has the happy faculty of blending enough real with\r\nromance to make her stories very practical for good without robbing them\r\nof any of their exciting interest.”—_Chicago Inter-Ocean._\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth is one of the few writers of tales for children whose\r\nsentiment though of the sweetest kind is never sickly; whose religious\r\nfeeling is never concealed yet never obtruded; whose books are always\r\ngood but never ‘goody.’ Little Ted with his soft heart, clever head, and\r\nbrave spirit is no morbid presentment of the angelic child ‘too good to\r\nlive,’ and who is certainly a nuisance on earth, but a charming\r\ncreature, if not a portrait, whom it is a privilege to meet even in\r\nfiction.”—_The Academy._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CUCKOO CLOCK.\r\n\r\n“A beautiful little story.... It will be read with delight by every\r\nchild into whose hands it is placed.”—_Pall Mall Gazette._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GRANDMOTHER DEAR.\r\n\r\n“The author’s concern is with the development of character, and seldom\r\ndoes one meet with the wisdom, tact, and good breeding which pervade\r\nthis little book.”—_Nation._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TWO LITTLE WAIFS.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth’s delightful story of _Two Little Waifs_ will charm all\r\nthe small people who find it in their stockings. It relates the\r\nadventures of two lovable English children lost in Paris, and is just\r\nwonderful enough to pleasantly wring the youthful heart.”—_New York\r\nTribune._\r\n\r\n“It is, in its way, indeed, a little classic, of which the real beauty\r\nand pathos can hardly be appreciated by young people.... It is not too\r\nmuch to say of the story that it is perfect of its kind.”—_Critic and\r\nGood Literature._\r\n\r\n“This is a charming little juvenile story from the pen of Mrs.\r\nMolesworth, detailing the various adventures of a couple of motherless\r\nchildren in searching for their father, whom they had missed in Paris,\r\nwhere they had gone to meet him.”—_Montreal Star._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE TAPESTRY ROOM.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth is the queen of children’s fairy-land. She knows how to\r\nmake use of the vague, fresh, wondering instincts of childhood, and to\r\ninvest familiar things with fairy glamour.”—_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n“The story told is a charming one of what may be called the neo-fairy\r\nsort.... There has been nothing better of its kind done anywhere for\r\nchildren, whether we consider its capacity to awaken interest or its\r\nwholesomeness.”—_Evening Post._\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHRISTMAS-TREE LAND.\r\n\r\n“It is conceived after a happy fancy, as it relates the supposititious\r\njourney of a party of little ones through that part of fairy-land where\r\nChristmas-trees are supposed to most abound. There is just enough of the\r\nold-fashioned fancy about fairies mingled with the ‘modern improvements’\r\nto incite and stimulate the youthful imagination to healthful action.\r\nThe pictures by Walter Crane are, of course, not only well executed in\r\nthemselves, but in charming consonance with the spirit of the\r\ntale.”—_Troy Times._\r\n\r\n“_Christmas-Tree Land_, by Mrs. Molesworth, is a book to make younger\r\nreaders open their eyes wide with delight. A little boy and a little\r\ngirl, domiciled in a great white castle, wander on their holidays\r\nthrough the surrounding fir-forests, and meet with the most delightful\r\npleasures. There is a fascinating, mysterious character in their\r\nadventures and enough of the fairylike and wonderful to puzzle and\r\nenchant all the little ones.”—_Boston Home Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A CHRISTMAS POSY.\r\n\r\n“This is a collection of eight of those inimitable stories for children\r\nwhich none could write better than Mrs. Molesworth. Her books are prime\r\nfavorites with children of all ages, and they are as good and wholesome\r\nas they are interesting and popular. This makes a very handsome book,\r\nand its illustrations are excellent.”—_Christian at Work._\r\n\r\n“_A Christmas Posy_, by Mrs. Molesworth, is lovely and fragrant. Mrs.\r\nMolesworth succeeds by right to the place occupied with so much honor by\r\nthe late Mrs. Ewing, as a writer of charming stories for children. The\r\npresent volume is a cluster of delightful short stories. Mr. Crane’s\r\nillustrations are in harmony with the text.”—_Christian Intelligencer._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE CHILDREN OF THE CASTLE.\r\n\r\n“_The Children of the Castle_, by Mrs. Molesworth, is another of those\r\ndelightful juvenile stories of which this author has written so many. It\r\nis a fascinating little book, with a charming plot, a sweet, pure\r\natmosphere, and teaches a wholesome moral in the most winning\r\nmanner.”—_B. S. E. Gazette._\r\n\r\n“_The Children of the Castle_ are delightful creations, actual little\r\ngirls, living in an actual castle, but often led by their fancies into a\r\nshadowy fairy-land. There is a charming refinement of style and spirit\r\nabout the story from beginning to end; an imaginative child will find\r\nendless pleasure in it, and the lesson of gentleness and unselfishness\r\nis so artistically managed that it does not seem like a lesson, but only\r\na part of the story.”—_Milwaukee Sentinel._\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FOUR WINDS FARM.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth’s books are always delightful, but of all none is more\r\ncharming than the volume with which she greets the holidays this season.\r\n_Four Winds Farm_ is one of the most delicate and pleasing books for a\r\nchild that has seen the light this many a day. It is full of fancy and\r\nof that instinctive sympathy with childhood which makes this author’s\r\nbooks so attractive and so individual.”—_Boston Courier._\r\n\r\n“Still more delicately fanciful is Mrs. Molesworth’s lovely little tale\r\nof the _Four Winds Farm_. It is neither a dream nor a fairy story, but\r\nconcerns the fortune of a real little boy, named Gratian; yet the dream\r\nand the fairy tale seem to enter into his life, and make part of it. The\r\nfarmhouse in which the child lives is set exactly at the meeting-place\r\nof the four winds, and they, from the moment of his birth, have acted as\r\nhis self-elected godmothers.... All the winds love the boy, and, held in\r\nthe balance of their influence, he grows up as a boy should, simply and\r\ntruly, with a tender heart and firm mind. The idea of this little book\r\nis essentially poetical.”—_Literary World._\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NURSE HEATHERDALE’S STORY.\r\n\r\n“_Nurse Heatherdale’s Story_ is all about a small boy, who was good\r\nenough, yet was always getting into some trouble through complications\r\nin which he was not to blame. The same sort of things happens to men and\r\nwomen. He is an orphan, though he is cared for in a way by relations,\r\nwho are not so very rich, yet are looked on as well fixed. After many\r\nyouthful trials and disappointments he falls into a big stroke of good\r\nluck, which lifts him and goes to make others happy. Those who want a\r\nchild’s book will find nothing to harm and something to interest in this\r\nsimple story.”—_Commercial Advertiser._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 “US.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth’s _Us, an Old-Fashioned Story_, is very charming. A\r\ndear little six-year-old ‘bruvver’ and sister constitute the ‘us,’ whose\r\nadventures with gypsies form the theme of the story. Mrs. Molesworth’s\r\nstyle is graceful, and she pictures the little ones with brightness and\r\ntenderness.”—_Evening Post._\r\n\r\n“A pretty and wholesome story.”—_Literary World._\r\n\r\n“_Us, an Old-Fashioned Story_, is a sweet and quaint story of two little\r\nchildren who lived long ago, in an old-fashioned way, with their\r\ngrandparents. The story is delightfully told.”—_Philadelphia News._\r\n\r\n“_Us_ is one of Mrs. Molesworth’s charming little stories for young\r\nchildren. The narrative ... is full of interest for its real grace and\r\ndelicacy, and the exquisiteness and purity of the English in which it is\r\nwritten.”—_Boston Advertiser._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE RECTORY CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n“In _The Rectory Children_ Mrs. Molesworth has written one of those\r\ndelightful volumes which we always look for at Christmas\r\ntime.”—_Athenæum._\r\n\r\n“Quiet, sunny, interesting, and thoroughly winning and\r\nwholesome.”—_Boston Journal._\r\n\r\n_The Rectory Children_—“There is no writer of children’s books more\r\nworthy of their admiration and love than Mrs. Molesworth. Her bright and\r\nsweet invention is so truthful, her characters so faithfully drawn, and\r\nthe teaching of her stories so tender and noble, that while they please\r\nand charm they insensibly distil into the youthful mind the most\r\nvaluable lessons. In _The Rectory Children_ we have a fresh, bright\r\nstory that will be sure to please all her young admirers.”—_Christian at\r\nWork._\r\n\r\n“_The Rectory Children_, by Mrs. Molesworth, is a very pretty story of\r\nEnglish life. Mrs. Molesworth is one of the most popular and charming of\r\nEnglish story-writers for children. Her child characters are true to\r\nlife, always natural and attractive, and her stories are wholesome and\r\ninteresting.”—_Indianapolis Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ROSY.\r\n\r\n“_Rosy_, like all the rest of her stories, is bright and pure and\r\nutterly free from cant,—a book that children will read with pleasure and\r\nlasting profit.”—_Boston Traveller._\r\n\r\n“There is no one who has a genius better adapted for entertaining\r\nchildren than Mrs. Molesworth, and her latest story, _Rosy_, is one of\r\nher best. It is illustrated with eight woodcuts from designs by Walter\r\nCrane.”—_Philadelphia Press._\r\n\r\n“... Mrs. Molesworth’s clever _Rosy_, a story showing in a charming way\r\nhow one little girl’s jealousy and bad temper were conquered; one of the\r\nbest, most suggestive and improving of the Christmas juveniles.”—_New\r\nYork Tribune._\r\n\r\n“_Rosy_ is an exceedingly graceful and interesting story by Mrs.\r\nMolesworth, one of the best and most popular writers of juvenile\r\nfiction. This little story is full of tenderness, is fragrant in\r\nsentiment, and points with great delicacy and genuine feeling a charming\r\nmoral.”—_Boston Gazette._\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE GIRLS AND I.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the most striking feature of this pleasant story is the natural\r\nmanner in which it is written. It is just like the conversation of a\r\nbright boy—consistently like it from beginning to end. It is a boy who\r\nis the hero of the tale, and he tells the adventures of himself and\r\nthose nearest him. He is, by the way, in many respects an example for\r\nmost young persons. It is a story characterized by sweetness and\r\npurity—a desirable one to put into the hands of youthful\r\nreaders.”—_Gettysburg Monthly._\r\n\r\n“... A delightful and purposeful story which no one can read without\r\nbeing benefited.”—_New York Observer._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 MARY.\r\n\r\n              Mrs. Molesworth’s last story. _Just Ready._\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Molesworth’s reputation as a writer of story-books is so well\r\nestablished that any new book of hers scarce needs a word of\r\nintroduction.”—_Home Journal._\r\n\r\n                            MACMILLAN & CO.,\r\n                       66 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Book back cover.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n--Copyright notice provided as in the original—this e-text is public\r\n  domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n--Silently corrected palpable typos; left non-standard spellings and\r\n  dialect unchanged.\r\n\r\n--Moved the frontispiece illustration to the corresponding place in the\r\n  text, and adjusted the table of illustration accordingly.\r\n\r\n--Collated table of illustrations, checked page numbers, and added its\r\n  captions to the illustrations.\r\n\r\n--Only in the text versions, delimited italicized text (or\r\n  non-italicized text within poetry) in _underscores_ (the HTML version\r\n  reproduces the font form of the printed book.)\r\n\r\n--The HTML version contains relative links to pages and illustrations in\r\n  the companion volume: Gutenberg #48630: Sylvie and Bruno, Illustrated\r\n\r\n--Removed the note (N.B. “stagy-entrances” is a misprint for\r\n  “stage-entrances”) because the typo was corrected in the companion\r\n  volume",
