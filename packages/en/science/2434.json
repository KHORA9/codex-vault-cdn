It seems to have been written\r\nabout 1623, during that period of literary activity which followed\r\nBacon's political fall.  None of Bacon's writings gives in short apace\r\nso vivid a picture of his tastes and aspirations as this fragment of\r\nthe plan of an ideal commonwealth.  The generosity and enlightenment,\r\nthe dignity and splendor, the piety and public spirit, of the\r\ninhabitants of Bensalem represent the ideal qualities which Bacon the\r\nstatesman desired rather than hoped to see characteristic of his own\r\ncountry; and in Solomon's House we have Bacon the scientist indulging\r\nwithout restriction his prophetic vision of the future of human\r\nknowledge.  No reader acquainted in any degree with the processes and\r\nresults of modern scientific inquiry can fail to be struck by the\r\nnumerous approximations made by Bacon's imagination to the actual\r\nachievements of modern times.  The plan and organization of his great\r\ncollege lay down the main lines of the modern research university; and\r\nboth in pure and applied science he anticipates a strikingly large\r\nnumber of recent inventions and discoveries.  In still another way is\r\n\"The New Atlantis\" typical of Bacon's attitude. In spite of the\r\nenthusiastic and broad-minded schemes he laid down for the pursuit of\r\ntruth, Bacon always had an eye to utility.  The advancement of science\r\nwhich he sought was conceived by him as a means to a practical end the\r\nincrease of man's control over nature, and the comfort and convenience\r\nof humanity.  For pure metaphysics, or any form of abstract thinking\r\nthat yielded no \"fruit,\" he had little interest; and this leaning to\r\nthe useful is shown in the practical applications of the discoveries\r\nmade by the scholars of Solomon's House.  Nor does the interest of the\r\nwork stop here.  It contains much, both in its political and in its\r\nscientific ideals, that we have as yet by no means achieved, but which\r\ncontain valuable elements of suggestion and stimulus for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ATLANTIS\r\n\r\nWe sailed from Peru, (where we had continued for the space of one whole\r\nyear) for China and Japan, by the South Sea; taking with us victuals\r\nfor twelve months; and had good winds from the east, though soft and\r\nweak, for five months space, and more.  But the wind came about, and\r\nsettled in the west for many days, so as we could make little or no\r\nway, and were sometime in purpose to turn back.  But then again there\r\narose strong and great winds from the south, with a point east, which\r\ncarried us up (for all that we could do) towards the north; by which\r\ntime our victuals failed us, though we had made good spare of them.  So\r\nthat finding ourselves, in the midst of the greatest wilderness of\r\nwaters in the world, without victuals, we gave ourselves for lost men\r\nand prepared for death.  Yet we did lift up our hearts and voices to\r\nGod above, who showeth his wonders in the deep, beseeching him of his\r\nmercy, that as in the beginning he discovered the face of the deep, and\r\nbrought forth dry land, so he would now discover land to us, that we\r\nmight not perish.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass that the next day about evening we saw within a\r\nkenning before us, towards the north, as it were thick clouds, which\r\ndid put us in some hope of land; knowing how that part of the South Sea\r\nwas utterly unknown; and might have islands, or continents, that\r\nhitherto were not come to light.  Wherefore we bent our course thither,\r\nwhere we saw the appearance of land, all that night; and in the dawning\r\nof the next day, we might plainly discern that it was a land; flat to\r\nour sight, and full of boscage; which made it show the more dark.  And\r\nafter an hour and a half's sailing, we entered into a good haven, being\r\nthe port of a fair city; not great indeed, but well built, and that\r\ngave a pleasant view from the sea: and we thinking every minute long,\r\ntill we were on land, came close to the shore, and offered to land.\r\nBut straightways we saw divers of the people, with bastons in their\r\nhands (as it were) forbidding us to land; yet without any cries of\r\nfierceness, but only as warning us off, by signs that they made.\r\nWhereupon being not a little discomforted, we were advising with\r\nourselves, what we should do.\r\n\r\nDuring which time, there made forth to us a small boat, with about\r\neight persons in it; whereof one of them had in his hand a tipstaff of\r\na yellow cane, tipped at both ends with blue, who came aboard our ship,\r\nwithout any show of distrust at all.  And when he saw one of our\r\nnumber, present himself somewhat before the rest, he drew forth a\r\nlittle scroll of parchment (somewhat yellower than our parchment, and\r\nshining like the leaves of writing tables, but otherwise soft and\r\nflexible,) and delivered it to our foremost man.  In which scroll were\r\nwritten in ancient Hebrew, and in ancient Greek, and in good Latin of\r\nthe school, and in Spanish, these words: Land ye not, none of you; and\r\nprovide to be gone from this coast, within sixteen days, except you\r\nhave further time given you.  Meanwhile, if you want fresh water or\r\nvictuals, or help for your sick, or that your ship needeth repairs,\r\nwrite down your wants, and you shall have that, which belongeth to\r\nmercy.  This scroll was signed with a stamp of cherubim: wings, not\r\nspread, but hanging downwards; and by them a cross.  This being\r\ndelivered, the officer returned, and left only a servant with us to\r\nreceive our answer.\r\n\r\nConsulting hereupon amongst ourselves, we were much perplexed.  The\r\ndenial of landing and hasty warning us away troubled us much; on the\r\nother side, to find that the people had languages, and were so full of\r\nhumanity, did comfort us not a little.  And above all, the sign of the\r\ncross to that instrument was to us a great rejoicing, and as it were a\r\ncertain presage of good.  Our answer was in the Spanish tongue; that\r\nfor our ship, it was well; for we had rather met with calms and\r\ncontrary winds than any tempests.  For our sick, they were many, and in\r\nvery ill case; so that if they were not permitted to land, they ran\r\ndanger of their lives.  Our other wants we set down in particular;\r\nadding, That we had some little store of merchandise, which if it\r\npleased them to deal for, it might supply our wants, without being\r\nchargeable unto them.  We offered some reward in pistolets unto the\r\nservant, and a piece of crimson velvet to be presented to the officer;\r\nbut the servant took them not, nor would scarce look upon them; and so\r\nleft us, and went back in another little boat, which was sent for him.\r\n\r\nAbout three hours after we had dispatched our answer, there came\r\ntowards us a person (as it seemed) of place.  He had on him a gown with\r\nwide sleeves, of a kind of water chamolet, of an excellent azure\r\ncolour, fair more glossy than ours; his under apparel was green; and so\r\nwas his hat, being in the form of a turban, daintily made, and not so\r\nhuge as the Turkish turbans; and the locks of his hair came down below\r\nthe brims of it.  A reverend man was he to behold.  He came in a boat,\r\ngilt in some part of it, with four persons more only in that boat; and\r\nwas followed by another boat, wherein were some twenty. When he was\r\ncome within a flightshot of our ship, signs were made to us, that we\r\nshould send forth some to meet him upon the water; which we presently\r\ndid in our ship-boat, sending the principal man amongst us save one,\r\nand four of our number with him.\r\n\r\nWhen we were come within six yards of their boat, they called to us to\r\nstay, and not to approach farther; which we did.  And thereupon the\r\nman, whom I before described, stood up, and with a loud voice, in\r\nSpanish, asked, \"Are ye Christians?\"  We answered, \"We were;\" fearing\r\nthe less, because of the cross we had seen in the subscription.  At\r\nwhich answer the said person lifted up his right hand towards Heaven,\r\nand drew it softly to his mouth (which is the gesture they use, when\r\nthey thank God;) and then said: \"If ye will swear (all of you) by the\r\nmerits of the Saviour, that ye are no pirates, nor have shed blood,\r\nlawfully, nor unlawfully within forty days past, you may have licence\r\nto come on land.\"  We said, \"We were all ready to take that oath.\"\r\nWhereupon one of those that were with him, being (as it seemed) a\r\nnotary, made an entry of this act.  Which done, another of the\r\nattendants of the great person which was with him in the same boat,\r\nafter his Lord had spoken a little to him, said aloud: \"My Lord would\r\nhave you know, that it is not of pride, or greatness, that he cometh\r\nnot aboard your ship; but for that in your answer you declare that you\r\nhave many sick amongst you, he was warned by the Conservator of Health\r\nof the city that he should keep a distance.\"  We bowed ourselves\r\ntowards him, and answered, \"We were his humble servants; and accounted\r\nfor great honour, and singular humanity towards us, that which was\r\nalready done; but hoped well, that the nature of the sickness of our\r\nmen was not infectious.\"  So he returned; and a while after came the\r\nNotary to us aboard our ship; holding in his hand a fruit of that\r\ncountry, like an orange, but of color between orange-tawney and\r\nscarlet; which cast a most excellent odour.  He used it (as it seemeth)\r\nfor a preservative against infection.  He gave us our oath; \"By the\r\nname of Jesus, and his merits:\" and after told us, that the next day,\r\nby six of the Clock, in the Morning, we should be sent to, and brought\r\nto the Strangers' House, (so he called it,) where we should be\r\naccommodated of things, both for our whole, and for our sick. So he\r\nleft us; and when we offered him some pistolets, he smiling said, \"He\r\nmust not be twice paid for one labour:\" meaning (as I take it) that he\r\nhad salary sufficient of the State for his service.  For (as I after\r\nlearned) they call an officer that taketh rewards, \"twice paid.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning early, there came to us the same officer that came to\r\nus at first with his cane, and told us, He came to conduct us to the\r\nStrangers' House; and that he had prevented the hour, because we might\r\nhave the whole day before us, for our business.  \"For,\" said he, \"if\r\nyou will follow my advice, there shall first go with me some few of\r\nyou, and see the place, and how it may be made convenient for you; and\r\nthen you may send for your sick, and the rest of your number, which ye\r\nwill bring on land.\"  We thanked him, and said, \"That this care, which\r\nhe took of desolate strangers, God would reward.\"  And so six of us\r\nwent on land with him: and when we were on land, he went before us, and\r\nturned to us, and said, \"He was but our servant, and our guide.\" He led\r\nus through three fair streets; and all the way we went, there were\r\ngathered some people on both sides, standing in a row; but in so civil\r\na fashion, as if it had been, not to wonder at us, but to welcome us:\r\nand divers of them, as we passed by them, put their arms a little\r\nabroad; which is their gesture, when they did bid any welcome.\r\n\r\nThe Strangers' House is a fair and spacious house, built of brick, of\r\nsomewhat a bluer colour than our brick; and with handsome windows, some\r\nof glass, some of a kind of cambric oiled.  He brought us first into a\r\nfair parlour above stairs, and then asked us, \"What number of persons\r\nwe were?  And how many sick?\"  We answered, \"We were in all, (sick and\r\nwhole,) one and fifty persons, whereof our sick were seventeen.\"  He\r\ndesired us to have patience a little, and to stay till he came back to\r\nus; which was about an hour after; and then he led us to see the\r\nchambers which were provided for us, being in number nineteen: they\r\nhaving cast it (as it seemeth) that four of those chambers, which were\r\nbetter than the rest, might receive four of the principal men of our\r\ncompany; and lodge them alone by themselves; and the other fifteen\r\nchambers were to lodge us two and two together.  The chambers were\r\nhandsome and cheerful chambers, and furnished civilly. Then he led us\r\nto a long gallery, like a dorture, where he showed us all along the one\r\nside (for the other side was but wall and window), seventeen cells,\r\nvery neat ones, having partitions of cedar wood. Which gallery and\r\ncells, being in all forty, many more than we needed, were instituted as\r\nan infirmary for sick persons.  And he told us withal, that as any of\r\nour sick waxed well, he might be removed from his cell, to a chamber;\r\nfor which purpose there were set forth ten spare chambers, besides the\r\nnumber we spake of before.  This done, he brought us back to the\r\nparlour, and lifting up his cane a little, (as they do when they give\r\nany charge or command) said to us, \"Ye are to know, that the custom of\r\nthe land requireth, that after this day and to-morrow, (which we give\r\nyou for removing of your people from your ship,) you are to keep within\r\ndoors for three days.  But let it not trouble you, nor do not think\r\nyourselves restrained, but rather left to your rest and ease.  You\r\nshall want nothing, and there are six of our people appointed to attend\r\nyou, for any business you may have abroad.\"  We gave him thanks, with\r\nall affection and respect, and said, \"God surely is manifested in this\r\nland.\"  We offered him also twenty pistolets; but he smiled, and only\r\nsaid; \"What? twice paid!\"  And so he left us.\r\n\r\nSoon after our dinner was served in; which was right good viands, both\r\nfor bread and treat: better than any collegiate diet, that I have known\r\nin Europe.  We had also drink of three sorts, all wholesome and good;\r\nwine of the grape; a drink of grain, such as is with us our ale, but\r\nmore clear: And a kind of cider made of a fruit of that country; a\r\nwonderful pleasing and refreshing drink.  Besides, there were brought\r\nin to us, great store of those scarlet oranges, for our sick; which\r\n(they said) were an assured remedy for sickness taken at sea.  There\r\nwas given us also, a box of small gray, or whitish pills, which they\r\nwished our sick should take, one of the pills, every night before\r\nsleep; which (they said) would hasten their recovery.\r\n\r\nThe next day, after that our trouble of carriage and removing of our\r\nmen and goods out of our ship, was somewhat settled and quiet, I\r\nthought good to call our company together; and when they were\r\nassembled, said unto them; \"My dear friends, let us know ourselves, and\r\nhow it standeth with us.  We are men cast on land, as Jonas was, out of\r\nthe whale's belly, when we were as buried in the deep: and now we are\r\non land, we are but between death and life; for we are beyond, both the\r\nold world, and the new; and whether ever we shall see Europe, God only\r\nknoweth.  It is a kind of miracle bath brought us hither: and it must\r\nbe little less, that shall bring us hence.  Therefore in regard of our\r\ndeliverance past, and our danger present, and to come, let us look up\r\nto God, and every man reform his own ways.  Besides we are come here\r\namongst a Christian people, full of piety and humanity: let us not\r\nbring that confusion of face upon ourselves, as to show our vices, or\r\nunworthiness before them.  Yet there is more.  For they have by\r\ncommandment, (though in form of courtesy) cloistered us within these\r\nwall, for three days: who knoweth, whether it be not, to take some\r\ntaste of our manners and conditions?  And if they find them bad, to\r\nbanish us straightways; if good, to give us further time.  For these\r\nmen that they have given us for attendance, may withal have an eye upon\r\nus.  Therefore for God's love, and as we love the weal of our souls and\r\nbodies, let us so behave ourselves, as we may be at peace with God, and\r\nmay find grace in the eyes of this people.\"  Our company with one voice\r\nthanked me for my good admonition, and promised me to live soberly and\r\ncivilly, and without giving any the least occasion of offence.  So we\r\nspent our three days joyfully, and without care, in expectation what\r\nwould be done with us, when they were expired. During which time, we\r\nhad every hour joy of the amendment of our sick; who thought themselves\r\ncast into some divine pool of healing; they mended so kindly, and so\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nThe morrow after our three days were past, there came to us a new man,\r\nthat we had not seen before, clothed in blue as the former was, save\r\nthat his turban was white, with a small red cross on the top.  He had\r\nalso a tippet of fine linen.  At his coming in, he did bend to us a\r\nlittle, and put his arms abroad.  We of our parts saluted him in a very\r\nlowly and submissive manner; as looking that from him, we should\r\nreceive sentence of life, or death: he desired to speak with some few\r\nof us: whereupon six of us only staid, and the rest avoided the room.\r\nHe said, \"I am by office governor of this House of Strangers, and by\r\nvocation I am a Christian priest: and therefore am come to you to offer\r\nyou my service, both as strangers and chiefly as Christians. Some\r\nthings I may tell you, which I think you will not be unwilling to hear.\r\nThe State hath given you license to stay on land, for the space of six\r\nweeks; and let it not trouble you, if your occasions ask further time,\r\nfor the law in this point is not precise; and I do not doubt, but my\r\nself shall be able, to obtain for you such further time, as may be\r\nconvenient.  Ye shall also understand, that the Strangers' House is at\r\nthis time rich, and much aforehand; for it hath laid up revenue these\r\nthirty-seven years; for so long it is since any stranger arrived in\r\nthis part: and therefore take ye no care; the State will defray you all\r\nthe time you stay; neither shall you stay one day the less for that.\r\nAs for any merchandise ye have brought, ye shall be well used, and have\r\nyour return, either in merchandise, or in gold and silver: for to us it\r\nis all one.  And if you have any other request to make, hide it not.\r\nFor ye shall find we will not make your countenance to fall by the\r\nanswer ye shall receive.  Only this I must tell you, that none of you\r\nmust go above a karan,\" (that is with them a mile and an half) \"from\r\nthe walls of the city, without especial leave.\"\r\n\r\nWe answered, after we had looked awhile one upon another, admiring this\r\ngracious and parent-like usage; \"That we could not tell what to say:\r\nfor we wanted words to express our thanks; and his noble free offers\r\nleft us nothing to ask.  It seemed to us, that we had before us a\r\npicture of our salvation in Heaven; for we that were a while since in\r\nthe jaws of death, were now brought into a place, where we found\r\nnothing but consolations.  For the commandment laid upon us, we would\r\nnot fail to obey it, though it was impossible but our hearts should be\r\nenflamed to tread further upon this happy and holy ground.\"  We added,\r\n\"That our tongues should first cleave to the roofs of our mouths, ere\r\nwe should forget, either his reverend person, or this whole nation, in\r\nour prayers.\"  We also most humbly besought him, to accept of us as his\r\ntrue servants; by as just a right as ever men on earth were bounden;\r\nlaying and presenting, both our persons, and all we had, at his feet.\r\nHe said; \"He was a priest, and looked for a priest's reward; which was\r\nour brotherly love, and the good of our souls and bodies.\" So he went\r\nfrom us, not without tears of tenderness in his eyes; and left us also\r\nconfused with joy and kindness, saying amongst ourselves; \"That we were\r\ncome into a land of angels, which did appear to us daily, and prevent\r\nus with comforts, which we thought not of, much less expected.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day about ten of the clock, the Governor came to us again, and\r\nafter salutations, said familiarly; \"That he was come to visit us;\" and\r\ncalled for a chair, and sat him down: and we, being some ten of us,\r\n(the rest were of the meaner sort, or else gone abroad,) sat down with\r\nhim, And when we were set, he began thus: \"We of this island of\r\nBensalem,\" (for so they call it in their language,) \"have this; that by\r\nmeans of our solitary situation; and of the laws of secrecy, which we\r\nhave for our travellers, and our rare admission of strangers; we know\r\nwell most part of the habitable world, and are ourselves unknown.\r\nTherefore because he that knoweth least is fittest to ask questions, it\r\nis more reason, for the entertainment of the time, that ye ask me\r\nquestions, than that I ask you.\"\r\n\r\nWe answered; \"That we humbly thanked him that he would give us leave so\r\nto do: and that we conceived by the taste we had already, that there\r\nwas no worldly thing on earth, more worthy to be known than the state\r\nof that happy land.  But above all,\" (we said,) \"since that we were met\r\nfrom the several ends of the world, and hoped assuredly that we should\r\nmeet one day in the kingdom of Heaven, (for that we were both parts\r\nChristians,) we desired to know, (in respect that land was so remote,\r\nand so divided by vast and unknown seas, from the land where our\r\nSaviour walked on earth,) who was the apostle of that nation, and how\r\nit was converted to the faith?\"  It appeared in his face that he took\r\ngreat contentment in this our question: he said; \"Ye knit my heart to\r\nyou, by asking this question in the first place; for it sheweth that\r\nyou first seek the kingdom of heaven; and I shall gladly, and briefly,\r\nsatisfy your demand.\r\n\r\n\"About twenty years after the ascension of our Saviour, it came to\r\npass, that there was seen by the people of Renfusa, (a city upon the\r\neastern coast of our island,) within night, (the night was cloudy, and\r\ncalm,) as it might be some mile into the sea, a great pillar of light;\r\nnot sharp, but in form of a column, or cylinder, rising from the sea a\r\ngreat way up towards heaven; and on the top of it was seen a large\r\ncross of light, more bright and resplendent than the body of the\r\npillar.  Upon which so strange a spectacle, the people of the city\r\ngathered apace together upon the sands, to wonder; and so after put\r\nthemselves into a number of small boats, to go nearer to this\r\nmarvellous sight.  But when the boats were come within (about) sixty\r\nyards of the pillar, they found themselves all bound, and could go no\r\nfurther; yet so as they might move to go about, but might not approach\r\nnearer: so as the boats stood all as in a theatre, beholding this light\r\nas an heavenly sign.  It so fell out, that there was in one of the\r\nboats one of the wise men, of the society of Salomon's House; which\r\nhouse, or college (my good brethren) is the very eye of this kingdom;\r\nwho having awhile attentively and devoutly viewed and contemplated this\r\npillar and cross, fell down upon his face; and then raised himself upon\r\nhis knees, and lifting up his hands to heaven, made his prayers in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\"'LORD God of heaven and earth, thou hast vouchsafed of thy grace to\r\nthose of our order, to know thy works of Creation, and the secrets of\r\nthem: and to discern (as far as appertaineth to the generations of men)\r\nbetween divine miracles, works of nature, works of art, and impostures\r\nand illusions of all sorts.  I do here acknowledge and testify before\r\nthis people, that the thing which we now see before our eyes is thy\r\nFinger and a true Miracle.  And forasmuch as we learn in our books that\r\nthou never workest miracles, but to divine and excellent end, (for the\r\nlaws of nature are thine own laws, and thou exceedest them not but upon\r\ngreat cause,) we most humbly beseech thee to prosper this great sign,\r\nand to give us the interpretation and use of it in mercy; which thou\r\ndost in some part secretly promise by sending it unto us.'\r\n\r\n\"When he had made his prayer, he presently found the boat he was in,\r\nmoveable and unbound; whereas all the rest remained still fast; and\r\ntaking that for an assurance of leave to approach, he caused the boat\r\nto be softly and with silence rowed towards the pillar.  But ere he\r\ncame near it, the pillar and cross of light brake up, and cast itself\r\nabroad, as it were, into a firmament of many stars; which also vanished\r\nsoon after, and there was nothing left to be seen, but a small ark, or\r\nchest of cedar, dry, and not wet at all with water, though it swam.\r\nAnd in the fore-end of it, which was towards him, grew a small green\r\nbranch of palm; and when the wise man had taken it, with all reverence,\r\ninto his boat, it opened of itself, and there were found in it a Book\r\nand a Letter; both written in fine parchment, and wrapped in sindons of\r\nlinen.  The Book contained all the canonical books of the Old and New\r\nTestament, according as you have them; (for we know well what the\r\nchurches with you receive); and the Apocalypse itself, and some other\r\nbooks of the New Testament, which were not at that time written, were\r\nnevertheless in the Book.  And for the Letter, it was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"'I, Bartholomew, a servant of the Highest, and Apostle of Jesus\r\nChrist, was warned by an angel that appeareth to me, in a vision of\r\nglory, that I should commit this ark to the floods of the sea.\r\nTherefore I do testify and declare unto that people where God shall\r\nordain this ark to come to land, that in the same day is come unto them\r\nsalvation and peace and good-will, from the Father, and from the Lord\r\nJesus.'\r\n\r\n\"There was also in both these writings, as well the Book, as the\r\nLetter, wrought a great miracle, conform to that of the Apostles, in\r\nthe original Gift of Tongues.  For there being at that time in this\r\nland Hebrews, Persians, and Indians, besides the natives, every one\r\nread upon the Book, and Letter, as if they had been written in his own\r\nlanguage.  And thus was this land saved from infidelity (as the\r\nremainder of the old world was from water) by an ark, through the\r\napostolical and miraculous evangelism of Saint Bartholomew.\"  And here\r\nhe paused, and a messenger came, and called him from us.  So this was\r\nall that passed in that conference.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the same governor came again to us, immediately after\r\ndinner, and excused himself, saying; \"That the day before he was called\r\nfrom us, somewhat abruptly, but now he would make us amends, and spend\r\ntime with us if we held his company and conference agreeable.\" We\r\nanswered, \"That we held it so agreeable and pleasing to us, as we\r\nforgot both dangers past and fears to come, for the time we hear him\r\nspeak; and that we thought an hour spent with him, was worth years of\r\nour former life.\"  He bowed himself a little to us, and after we were\r\nset again, he said; \"Well, the questions are on your part.\"\r\n\r\nOne of our number said, after a little pause; that there was a matter,\r\nwe were no less desirous to know, than fearful to ask, lest we might\r\npresume too far.  But encouraged by his rare humanity towards us, (that\r\ncould scarce think ourselves strangers, being his vowed and professed\r\nservants,) we would take the hardiness to propound it: humbly\r\nbeseeching him, if he thought it not fit to be answered, that he would\r\npardon it, though he rejected it.  We said; \"We well observed those his\r\nwords, which he formerly spake, that this happy island, where we now\r\nstood, was known to few, and yet knew most of the nations of the world;\r\nwhich we found to be true, considering they had the languages of\r\nEurope, and knew much of our state and business; and yet we in Europe,\r\n(notwithstanding all the remote discoveries and navigations of this\r\nlast age), never heard of the least inkling or glimpse of this island.\r\nThis we found wonderful strange; for that all nations have\r\ninter-knowledge one of another, either by voyage into foreign parts, or\r\nby strangers that come to them: and though the traveller into a foreign\r\ncountry, doth commonly know more by the eye, than he that stayeth at\r\nhome can by relation of the traveller; yet both ways suffice to make a\r\nmutual knowledge, in some degree, on both parts.  But for this island,\r\nwe never heard tell of any ship of theirs that had been seen to arrive\r\nupon any shore of Europe; nor of either the East or West Indies; nor\r\nyet of any ship of any other part of the world, that had made return\r\nfrom them.  And yet the marvel rested not in this.  For the situation\r\nof it (as his lordship said) in the secret conclave' of such a vast sea\r\nmight cause it.  But then, that they should have knowledge of the\r\nlanguages, books, affairs, of those that lie such a distance from them,\r\nit was a thing we could not tell what to make of; for that it seemed to\r\nus a conditioner and propriety of divine powers and beings, to be\r\nhidden and unseen to others, and yet to have others open and as in a\r\nlight to them.\"\r\n\r\nAt this speech the Governor gave a gracious smile, and said; \"That we\r\ndid well to ask pardon for this question we now asked: for that it\r\nimported, as if we thought this land, a land of magicians, that sent\r\nforth spirits of the air into all parts, to bring them news and\r\nintelligence of other countries.\"  It was answered by us all, in all\r\npossible humbleness, but yet with a countenance taking knowledge, that\r\nwe knew that he spake it but merrily, \"That we were apt enough to think\r\nthere was somewhat supernatural in this island; but yet rather as\r\nangelical than magical.  But to let his lordship know truly what it was\r\nthat made us tender and doubtful to ask this question, it was not any\r\nsuch conceit, but because we remembered, he had given a touch in his\r\nformer speech, that this land had laws of secrecy touching strangers.\"\r\nTo this he said; \"You remember it aright and therefore in that I shall\r\nsay to you, I must reserve some particulars, which it is not lawful for\r\nme to reveal; but there will be enough left, to give you satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall understand (that which perhaps you will scarce think\r\ncredible) that about three thousand years ago, or somewhat more, the\r\nnavigation of the world, (especially for remote voyages,) was greater\r\nthan at this day.  Do not think with yourselves, that I know not how\r\nmuch it is increased with you, within these six-score years: I know it\r\nwell: and yet I say greater then than now; whether it was, that the\r\nexample of the ark, that saved the remnant of men from the universal\r\ndeluge, gave men confidence to adventure upon the waters; or what it\r\nwas; but such is the truth.  The Phoenicians, and especially the\r\nTyrians, had great fleets.  So had the Carthaginians their colony,\r\nwhich is yet further west.  Toward the east the shipping of Egypt and\r\nof Palestine was likewise great.  China also, and the great Atlantis,\r\n(that you call America,) which have now but junks and canoes, abounded\r\nthen in tall ships.  This island, (as appeareth by faithful registers\r\nof those times,) had then fifteen hundred strong ships, of great\r\ncontent.  Of all this, there is with you sparing memory, or none; but\r\nwe have large knowledge thereof.\r\n\r\n\"At that time, this land was known and frequented by the ships and\r\nvessels of all the nations before named.  And (as it cometh to pass)\r\nthey had many times men of other countries, that were no sailors, that\r\ncame with them; as Persians, Chaldeans, Arabians; so as almost all\r\nnations of might and fame resorted hither; of whom we have some stirps,\r\nand little tribes with us at this day.  And for our own ships, they\r\nwent sundry voyages, as well to your straits, which you call the\r\nPillars of Hercules, as to other parts in the Atlantic and Mediterrane\r\nSeas; as to Paguin, (which is the same with Cambaline,) and Quinzy,\r\nupon the Oriental Seas, as far as to the borders of the East Tartary.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time, and an age after, or more, the inhabitants of the\r\ngreat Atlantis did flourish.  For though the narration and description,\r\nwhich is made by a great man with you; that the descendants of Neptune\r\nplanted there; and of the magnificent temple, palace, city, and hill;\r\nand the manifold streams of goodly navigable rivers, (which as so many\r\nchains environed the same site and temple); and the several degrees of\r\nascent, whereby men did climb up to the same, as if it had been a scala\r\ncoeli, be all poetical and fabulous: yet so much is true, that the said\r\ncountry of Atlantis, as well that of Peru, then called Coya, as that of\r\nMexico, then named Tyrambel, were mighty and proud kingdoms in arms,\r\nshipping and riches: so mighty, as at one time (or at least within the\r\nspace of ten years) they both made two great expeditions; they of\r\nTyrambel through the Atlantic to the Mediterrane Sea; and they of Coya\r\nthrough the South Sea upon this our island: and for the former of\r\nthese, which was into Europe, the same author amongst you (as it\r\nseemeth) had some relation from the Egyptian priest whom he cited.  For\r\nassuredly such a thing there was.  But whether it were the ancient\r\nAthenians that had the glory of the repulse and resistance of those\r\nforces, I can say nothing: but certain it is, there never came back\r\neither ship or man from that voyage.  Neither had the other voyage of\r\nthose of Coya upon us had better fortune, if they had not met with\r\nenemies of greater clemency.  For the king of this island, (by name\r\nAltabin,) a wise man and a great warrior, knowing well both his own\r\nstrength and that of his enemies, handled the matter so, as he cut off\r\ntheir land-forces from their ships; and entoiled both their navy and\r\ntheir tamp with a greater power than theirs, both by sea and land: arid\r\ncompelled them to render themselves without striking stroke and after\r\nthey were at his mercy, contenting himself only with their oath that\r\nthey should no more bear arms against him, dismissed them all in safety.\r\n\r\n\"But the divine revenge overtook not long after those proud\r\nenterprises.  For within less than the space of one hundred years, the\r\ngreat Atlantis was utterly lost and destroyed: not by a great\r\nearthquake, as your man saith; (for that whole tract is little subject\r\nto earthquakes;) but by a particular' deluge or inundation; those\r\ncountries having, at this day, far greater rivers and far higher\r\nmountains to pour down waters, than any part of the old world.  But it\r\nis true that the same inundation was not deep; not past forty foot, in\r\nmost places, from the ground; so that although it destroyed man and\r\nbeast generally, yet some few wild inhabitants of the wood escaped.\r\nBirds also were saved by flying to the high trees and woods.  For as\r\nfor men, although they had buildings in many places, higher than the\r\ndepth of the water, yet that inundation, though it were shallow, had a\r\nlong continuance; whereby they of the vale that were not drowned,\r\nperished for want of food and other things necessary.\r\n\r\n\"So as marvel you not at the thin population of America, nor at the\r\nrudeness and ignorance of the people; for you must account your\r\ninhabitants of America as a young people; younger a thousand years, at\r\nthe least, than the rest of the world: for that there was so much time\r\nbetween the universal flood and their particular inundation.  For the\r\npoor remnant of human seed, which remained in their mountains, peopled\r\nthe country again slowly, by little and little; and being simple and\r\nsavage people, (not like Noah and his sons, which was the chief family\r\nof the earth;) they were not able to leave letters, arts, and civility\r\nto their posterity; and having likewise in their mountainous\r\nhabitations been used (in respect of the extreme cold of those regions)\r\nto clothe themselves with the skins of tigers, bears, and great hairy\r\ngoats, that they have in those parts; when after they came down into\r\nthe valley, and found the intolerable heats which are there, and knew\r\nno means of lighter apparel, they were forced to begin the custom of\r\ngoing naked, which continueth at this day.  Only they take great pride\r\nand delight in the feathers of birds; and this also they took from\r\nthose their ancestors of the mountains, who were invited unto it by the\r\ninfinite flights of birds that came up to the high grounds, while the\r\nwaters stood below.  So you see, by this main accident of time, we lost\r\nour traffic with the Americans, with whom of, all others, in regard\r\nthey lay nearest to us, we had most commerce.\r\n\r\n\"As for the other parts of the world, it is most manifest that in the\r\nages following (whether it were in respect of wars, or by a natural\r\nrevolution of time,) navigation did every where greatly decay; and\r\nspecially far voyages (the rather by the use of galleys, and such\r\nvessels as could hardly brook the ocean,) were altogether left and\r\nomitted.  So then, that part of intercourse which could be from other\r\nnations to sail to us, you see how it hath long since ceased; except it\r\nwere by some rare accident, as this of yours.  But now of the cessation\r\nof that other part of intercourse, which might be by our sailing to\r\nother nations, I must yield you some other cause.  For I cannot say (if\r\nI shall say truly,) but our shipping, for number, strength, mariners,\r\npilots, and all things that appertain to navigation, is as great as\r\never; and therefore why we should sit at home, I shall now give you an\r\naccount by itself: and it will draw nearer to give you satisfaction to\r\nyour principal question.\r\n\r\n\"There reigned in this land, about nineteen hundred years ago, a king,\r\nwhose memory of all others we most adore; not superstitiously, but as a\r\ndivine instrument, though a mortal man; his name was Solamona: and we\r\nesteem him as the lawgiver of our nation.  This king had a large heart,\r\ninscrutable for good; and was wholly bent to make his kingdom and\r\npeople happy.  He therefore, taking into consideration how sufficient\r\nand substantive this land was to maintain itself without any aid (at\r\nall) of the foreigner; being five thousand six hundred miles in\r\ncircuit, and of rare fertility of soil in the greatest part thereof;\r\nand finding also the shipping of this country might be plentifully set\r\non work, both by fishing and by transportations from port to port, and\r\nlikewise by sailing unto some small islands that are not far from us,\r\nand are under the crown and laws of this state; and, recalling into his\r\nmemory the happy and flourishing estate wherein this land then was; so\r\nas it might be a thousand ways altered to the worse, but scarce any one\r\nway to the better; thought nothing wanted to his noble and heroical\r\nintentions, but only (as far as human foresight might reach) to give\r\nperpetuity to that which was in his time so happily established.\r\nTherefore amongst his other fundamental laws of this kingdom, he did\r\nordain the interdicts and prohibitions which we have touching entrance\r\nof strangers; which at that time (though it was after the calamity of\r\nAmerica) was frequent; doubting novelties, and commixture of manners.\r\nIt is true, the like law against the admission of strangers without\r\nlicence is an ancient law in the kingdom of China, and yet continued in\r\nuse.  But there it is a poor thing; and hath made them a curious,\r\nignorant, fearful, foolish nation.  But our lawgiver made his law of\r\nanother temper.  For first, he hath preserved all points of humanity,\r\nin taking order and making provision for the relief of strangers\r\ndistressed; whereof you have tasted.\"\r\n\r\nAt which speech (as reason was) we all rose up and bowed ourselves. He\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\"That king also, still desiring to join humanity and policy together;\r\nand thinking it against humanity, to detain strangers here against\r\ntheir wills, and against policy that they should return and discover\r\ntheir knowledge of this estate, he took this course: he did ordain that\r\nof the strangers that should be permitted to land, as many (at all\r\ntimes) might depart as would; but as many as would stay should have\r\nvery good conditions and means to live from the state.  Wherein he saw\r\nso far, that now in so many ages since the prohibition, we have memory\r\nnot of one ship that ever returned, and but of thirteen persons only,\r\nat several times, that chose to return in our bottoms.  What those few\r\nthat returned may have reported abroad I know not.  But you must think,\r\nwhatsoever they have said could be taken where they came but for a\r\ndream.  Now for our travelling from henna into parts abroad, our\r\nLawgiver thought fit altogether to restrain it.  So is it not in China.\r\nFor the Chinese sail where they will or can; which sheweth that their\r\nlaw of keeping out strangers is a law of pusillanimity and fear.  But\r\nthis restraint of ours hath one only exception, which is admirable;\r\npreserving the good which cometh by communicating with strangers, and\r\navoiding the hurt; and I will now open it to you.  And here I shall\r\nseem a little to digress, but you will by and by find it pertinent.\r\n\r\n\"Ye shall understand (my dear friends) that amongst the excellent acts\r\nof that king, one above all hath the pre-eminence.  It was the erection\r\nand institution of an Order or Society, which we call Salomon's House;\r\nthe noblest foundation (as we think) that ever was upon the earth; and\r\nthe lanthorn of this kingdom.  It is dedicated to the study of the\r\nworks and creatures of God.  Some think it beareth the founder's name a\r\nlittle corrupted, as if it should be Solamona's House.  But the records\r\nwrite it as it is spoken.  So as I take it to be denominate of the king\r\nof the Hebrews, which is famous with you, and no stranger to us.  For\r\nwe have some parts of his works, which with you are lost; namely, that\r\nnatural history, which he wrote, of all plants, from the cedar of\r\nLibanus to the moss that groweth out of the wall, and of all things\r\nthat have life and motion.  This maketh me think that our king, finding\r\nhimself to symbolize in many things with that king of the Hebrews\r\n(which lived many years before him), honored him with the title of this\r\nfoundation.  And I am rather induced to be of this opinion, for that I\r\nfind in ancient records this Order or Society is sometimes called\r\nSalomon's House, and sometimes the College of the Six Days Works;\r\nwhereby I am satisfied that our excellent king had learned from the\r\nHebrews that God had created the world and all that therein is within\r\nsix days: and therefore he instituting that House for the finding out\r\nof the true nature of all things, (whereby God might have the more\r\nglory in the workmanship of them, and insert the more fruit in the use\r\nof them), did give it also that second name.\r\n\r\n\"But now to come to our present purpose.  When the king had forbidden\r\nto all his people navigation into any part that was not under his\r\ncrown, he made nevertheless this ordinance; that every twelve years\r\nthere should be set forth, out of this kingdom two ships, appointed to\r\nseveral voyages; That in either of these ships there should be a\r\nmission of three of the Fellows or Brethren of Salomon's House; whose\r\nerrand was only to give us knowledge of the affairs and state of those\r\ncountries to which they were designed, and especially of the sciences,\r\narts, manufactures, and inventions of all the world; and withal to\r\nbring unto us books, instruments, and patterns in every kind: That the\r\nships, after they had landed the brethren, should return; and that the\r\nbrethren should stay abroad till the new mission.  These ships are not\r\notherwise fraught, than with store of victuals, and good quantity of\r\ntreasure to remain with the brethren, for the buying of such things and\r\nrewarding of such persons as they should think fit.  Now for me to tell\r\nyou how the vulgar sort of mariners are contained from being discovered\r\nat land; and how they that must be put on shore for any time, color\r\nthemselves under the names of other nations; and to what places these\r\nvoyages have been designed; and what places of rendezvous are appointed\r\nfor the new missions; and the like circumstances of the practique; I\r\nmay not do it: neither is it much to your desire.  But thus you see we\r\nmaintain a trade not for gold, silver, or jewels; nor for silks; nor\r\nfor spices; nor any other commodity of matter; but only for God's first\r\ncreature, which was Light: to have light (I say) of the growth of all\r\nparts of the world.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when he had said this, he was silent; and so were we all.  For\r\nindeed we were all astonished to hear so strange things so probably\r\ntold.  And he, perceiving that we were willing to say somewhat but had\r\nit not ready in great courtesy took us off, and descended to ask us\r\nquestions of our voyage and fortunes and in the end concluded, that we\r\nmight do well to think with ourselves what time of stay we would demand\r\nof the state; and bade us not to scant ourselves; for he would procure\r\nsuch time as we desired: Whereupon we all rose up, and presented\r\nourselves to kiss the skirt of his tippet; but he would not suffer us;\r\nand so took his leave.  But when it came once amongst our people that\r\nthe state used to offer conditions to strangers that would stay, we had\r\nwork enough to get any of our men to look to our ship; and to keep them\r\nfrom going presently to the governor to crave conditions.  But with\r\nmuch ado we refrained them, till we might agree what course to take.\r\n\r\nWe took ourselves now for free men, seeing there was no danger of our\r\nutter perdition; and lived most joyfully, going abroad and seeing what\r\nwas to be seen in the city and places adjacent within our tedder; and\r\nobtaining acquaintance with many of the city, not of the meanest\r\nquality; at whose hands we found such humanity, and such a freedom and\r\ndesire to take strangers as it were into their bosom, as was enough to\r\nmake us forget all that was dear to us in our own countries: and\r\ncontinually we met with many things right worthy of observation and\r\nrelation: as indeed, if there be a mirror in the world worthy to hold\r\nmen's eyes, it is that country.\r\n\r\nOne day there were two of our company bidden to a Feast of the Family,\r\nas they call it.  A most natural, pious, and reverend custom it is,\r\nshewing that nation to be compounded of all goodness.  This is the\r\nmanner of it.  It is granted to any man that shall live to see thirty\r\npersons descended of his body alive together, and all above three years\r\nold, to make this feast which is done at the cost of the state. The\r\nFather of the Family, whom they call the Tirsan, two days before the\r\nfeast, taketh to him three of such friends as he liketh to choose; and\r\nis assisted also by the governor of the city or place where the feast\r\nis celebrated; and all the persons of the family, of both sexes, are\r\nsummoned to attend him.  These two days the Tirsan sitteth in\r\nconsultation concerning the good estate of the family.  There, if there\r\nbe any discord or suits between any of the family, they are compounded\r\nand appeased.  There, if any of the family be distressed or decayed,\r\norder is taken for their relief and competent means to live. There, if\r\nany be subject to vice, or take ill courses, they are reproved and\r\ncensured.  So likewise direction is given touching marriages, and the\r\ncourses of life, which any of them should take, with divers other the\r\nlike orders and advices.  The governor assisteth, to the end to put in\r\nexecution by his public authority the decrees and orders of the Tirsan,\r\nif they should be disobeyed; though that seldom needeth; such reverence\r\nand obedience they give to the order of nature.  The Tirsan doth also\r\nthen ever choose one man from among his sons, to live in house with\r\nhim; who is called ever after the Son of the Vine.  The reason will\r\nhereafter appear.\r\n\r\nOn the feast day, the father or Tirsan cometh forth after divine\r\nservice into a large room where the feast is celebrated; which room\r\nhath an half-pace at the upper end.  Against the wall, in the middle of\r\nthe half-pace, is a chair placed for him, with a table and carpet\r\nbefore it.  Over the chair is a state, made round or oval, and it is of\r\nivy; an ivy somewhat whiter than ours, like the leaf of a silver asp;\r\nbut more shining; for it is green all winter.  And the state is\r\ncuriously wrought with silver and silk of divers colors, broiding or\r\nbinding in the ivy; and is ever of the work of some of the daughters of\r\nthe family; and veiled over at the top with a fine net of silk and\r\nsilver.  But the substance of it is true ivy; whereof, after it is\r\ntaken down, the friends of the family are desirous to have some leaf or\r\nsprig to keep.\r\n\r\nThe Tirsan cometh forth with all his generation or linage, the males\r\nbefore him, and the females following him; and if there be a mother\r\nfrom whose body the whole linage is descended, there is a traverse\r\nplaced in a loft above on the right hand of the chair, with a privy\r\ndoor, and a carved window of glass, leaded with gold and blue; where\r\nshe sitteth, but is not seen.  When the Tirsan is come forth, he\r\nsitteth down in the chair; and all the linage place themselves against\r\nthe wall, both at his back and upon the return of the half-pace, in\r\norder of their years without difference of sex; and stand upon their\r\nfeet.  When he is set; the room being always full of company, but well\r\nkept and without disorder; after some pause, there cometh in from the\r\nlower end of the room, a taratan (which is as much as an herald) and on\r\neither side of him two young lads; whereof one carrieth a scroll of\r\ntheir shining yellow parchment; and the other a cluster of grapes of\r\ngold, with a long foot or stalk.  The herald and children are clothed\r\nwith mantles of sea-water green satin; but the herald's mantle is\r\nstreamed with gold, and hath a train.\r\n\r\nThen the herald with three curtesies, or rather inclinations, cometh up\r\nas far as the half-pace; and there first taketh into his hand the\r\nscroll.  This scroll is the king's charter, containing gifts of\r\nrevenew, and many privileges, exemptions, and points of honour, granted\r\nto the Father of the Family; and is ever styled and directed, To such\r\ndo one our well beloved friend and creditor: which is a title proper\r\nonly to this case.  For they say the king is debtor to no man, but for\r\npropagation of his subjects.  The seal set to the king's charter is the\r\nking's image, imbossed or moulded in gold; and though such charters be\r\nexpedited of course, and as of right, yet they are varied by\r\ndiscretion, according to the number and dignity of the family.  This\r\ncharter the herald readeth aloud; and while it is read, the father or\r\nTirsan standeth up supported by two of his sons, such as he chooseth.\r\nThen the herald mounteth the half-pace and delivereth the charter into\r\nhis hand: and with that there is an acclamation by all that are present\r\nin their language, which is thus much: Happy are the people of Bensalem.\r\n\r\nThen the herald taketh into his hand from the other child the cluster\r\nof grapes, which is of gold, both the stalk and the grapes.  But the\r\ngrapes are daintily enamelled; and if the males of the family be the\r\ngreater number, the grapes are enamelled purple, with a little sun set\r\non the top; if the females, then they are enamelled into a greenish\r\nyellow, with a crescent on the top.  The grapes are in number as many\r\nas there are descendants of the family.  This golden cluster the herald\r\ndelivereth also to the Tirsan; who presently delivereth it over to that\r\nson that he had formerly chosen to be in house with him: who beareth it\r\nbefore his father as an ensign of honour when he goeth in public, ever\r\nafter; and is thereupon called the Son of the Vine.\r\n\r\nAfter the ceremony endeth the father or Tirsan retireth; and after some\r\ntime cometh forth again to dinner, where he sitteth alone under the\r\nstate, as before; and none of his descendants sit with him, of what\r\ndegree or dignity soever, except he hap to be of Salomon's House. He is\r\nserved only by his own children, such as are male; who perform unto him\r\nall service of the table upon the knee; and the women only stand about\r\nhim, leaning against the wall.  The room below the half-pace hath\r\ntables on the sides for the guests that are bidden; who are served with\r\ngreat and comely order; and towards the end of dinner (which in the\r\ngreatest feasts with them lasteth never above an hour and an half)\r\nthere is an hymn sung, varied according to the invention of him that\r\ncomposeth it (for they have excellent posy) but the subject of it is\r\n(always) the praises of Adam and Noah and Abraham; whereof the former\r\ntwo peopled the world, and the last was the Father of the Faithful:\r\nconcluding ever with a thanksgiving for the nativity of our Saviour, in\r\nwhose birth the births of all are only blessed.\r\n\r\nDinner being done, the Tirsan retireth again; and having withdrawn\r\nhimself alone into a place, where he makes some private prayers, he\r\ncometh forth the third time, to give the blessing with all his\r\ndescendants, who stand about him as at the first.  Then he calleth them\r\nforth by one and by one, by name, as he pleaseth, though seldom the\r\norder of age be inverted.  The person that is called (the table being\r\nbefore removed) kneeleth down before the chair, and the father layeth\r\nhis hand upon his head, or her head, and giveth the blessing in these\r\nwords: Son of Bensalem, (or daughter of Bensalem,) thy father with it:\r\nthe man by whom thou hast breath and life speaketh the word: the\r\nblessing of the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, and the Holy\r\nDove, be upon thee, and make the days of thy pilgrimage good and many.\r\nThis he saith to every of them; and that done, if there be any of his\r\nsons of eminent merit and virtue, (so they be not above two,) he\r\ncalleth for them again; and saith, laying his arm over their shoulders,\r\nthey standing; Sons, it is well ye are born, give God the praise, and\r\npersevere to the end.  And withall delivereth to either of them a\r\njewel, made in the figure of an ear of wheat, which they ever after\r\nwear in the front of their turban or hat.  This done, they fall to\r\nmusic and dances, and other recreations, after their manner, for the\r\nrest of the day.  This is the full order of that feast.\r\n\r\nBy that time six or seven days were spent, I was fallen into straight\r\nacquaintance with a merchant of that city, whose name was Joabin.  He\r\nwas a Jew and circumcised: for they have some few stirps of Jews yet\r\nremaining among them, whom they leave to their own religion.  Which\r\nthey may the better do, because they are of a far differing disposition\r\nfrom the Jews in other parts.  For whereas they hate the name of\r\nChrist; and have a secret inbred rancour against the people among whom\r\nthey live: these (contrariwise) give unto our Saviour many high\r\nattributes, and love the nation of Bensalem extremely.  Surely this man\r\nof whom I speak would ever acknowledge that Christ was born of a virgin\r\nand that he was more than a man; and he would tell how God made him\r\nruler of the seraphims which guard his throne; and they call him also\r\nthe Milken Way, and the Eliah of the Messiah; and many other high\r\nnames; which though they be inferior to his divine majesty, yet they\r\nare far from the language of other Jews.\r\n\r\nAnd for the country of Bensalem, this man would make no end of\r\ncommending it; being desirous, by tradition among the Jews there, to\r\nhave it believed that the people thereof were of the generations of\r\nAbraham, by another son, whom they call Nachoran; and that Moses by a\r\nsecret Cabala ordained the Laws of Bensalem which they now use; and\r\nthat when the Messiah should come, and sit in his throne at Hierusalem,\r\nthe king of Bensalem should sit at his feet, whereas other kings should\r\nkeep a great distance.  But yet setting aside these Jewish dreams, the\r\nman was a wise man, and learned, and of great policy, and excellently\r\nseen in the laws and customs of that nation.\r\n\r\nAmongst other discourses, one day I told him I was much affected with\r\nthe relation I had, from some of the company, of their custom, in\r\nholding the Feast of the Family; for that (methought) I had never heard\r\nof a solemnity wherein nature did so much preside.  And because\r\npropagation of families proceedeth from the nuptial copulation, I\r\ndesired to know of him what laws and customs they had concerning\r\nmarriage; and whether they kept marriage well and whether they were\r\ntied to one wife; for that where population is so much affected,' and\r\nsuch as with them it seemed to be, there is commonly permission of\r\nplurality of wives.\r\n\r\nTo this he said, \"You have reason for to commend that excellent\r\ninstitution of the Feast of the Family.  And indeed we have experience\r\nthat those families that are partakers of the blessing of that feast do\r\nflourish and prosper ever after in an extraordinary manner.  But hear\r\nme now, and I will tell you what I know.  You shall understand that\r\nthere is not under the heavens so chaste a nation as this of Bensalem;\r\nnor so free from all pollution or foulness.  It is the virgin of the\r\nworld.  I remember I have read in one of your European books, of an\r\nholy hermit amongst you that desired to see the Spirit of Fornication;\r\nand there appeared to him a little foul ugly Aethiop. But if he had\r\ndesired to see the Spirit of Chastity of Bensalem, it would have\r\nappeared to him in the likeness of a fair beautiful Cherubim.  For\r\nthere is nothing amongst mortal men more fair and admirable, than the\r\nchaste minds of this people.  Know therefore, that with them there are\r\nno stews, no dissolute houses, no courtesans, nor anything of that\r\nkind.  Nay they wonder (with detestation) at you in Europe, which\r\npermit such things.  They say ye have put marriage out of office: for\r\nmarriage is ordained a remedy for unlawful concupiscence; and natural\r\nconcupiscence seemeth as a spar to marriage. But when men have at hand\r\na remedy more agreeable to their corrupt will, marriage is almost\r\nexpulsed.  And therefore there are with you seen infinite men that\r\nmarry not, but chose rather a libertine and impure single life, than to\r\nbe yoked in marriage; and many that do marry, marry late, when the\r\nprime and strength of their years is past. And when they do marry, what\r\nis marriage to them but a very bargain; wherein is sought alliance, or\r\nportion, or reputation, with some desire (almost indifferent) of issue;\r\nand not the faithful nuptial union of man and wife, that was first\r\ninstituted.  Neither is it possible that those that have cast away so\r\nbasely so much of their strength, should greatly esteem children,\r\n(being of the same matter,) as chaste men do.  So likewise during\r\nmarriage, is the case much amended, as it ought to be if those things\r\nwere tolerated only for necessity?  No, but they remain still as a very\r\naffront to marriage. The haunting of those dissolute places, or resort\r\nto courtesans, are no more punished in married men than in bachelors.\r\nAnd the depraved custom of change, and the delight in meretricious\r\nembracements, (where sin is turned into art,) maketh marriage a dull\r\nthing, and a kind of imposition or tax.  They hear you defend these\r\nthings, as done to avoid greater evils; as advoutries, deflowering of\r\nvirgins, unnatural lust, and the like.  But they say this is a\r\npreposterous wisdom; and they call it Lot's offer, who to save his\r\nguests from abusing, offered his daughters: nay they say farther that\r\nthere is little gained in this; for that the same vices and appetites\r\ndo still remain and abound; unlawful lust being like a furnace, that if\r\nyou stop the flames altogether, it will quench; but if you give it any\r\nvent, it will rage. As for masculine love, they have no touch of it;\r\nand yet there are not so faithful and inviolate friendships in the\r\nworld again as are there; and to speak generally, (as I said before,) I\r\nhave not read of any such chastity, in any people as theirs.  And their\r\nusual saying is, That whosoever is unchaste cannot reverence himself;\r\nand they say, That the reverence of a man's self, is, next to religion,\r\nthe chiefest bridle of all vices.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when he had said this, the good Jew paused a little; whereupon I,\r\nfar more willing to hear him speak on than to speak myself, yet\r\nthinking it decent that upon his pause of speech I should not be\r\naltogether silent, said only this; \"That I would say to him, as the\r\nwidow of Sarepta said to Elias; that he was come to bring to memory our\r\nsins; and that I confess the righteousness of Bensalem was greater than\r\nthe righteousness of Europe.\"  At which speech he bowed his head, and\r\nwent on in this manner:\r\n\r\n\"They have also many wise and excellent laws touching marriage.  They\r\nallow no polygamy.  They have ordained that none do intermarry or\r\ncontract, until a month be past from their first interview.  Marriage\r\nwithout consent of parents they do not make void, but they mulct it in\r\nthe inheritors: for the children of such marriages are not admitted to\r\ninherit above a third part of their parents' inheritance.  I have read\r\nin a book of one of your men, of a Feigned Commonwealth, where the\r\nmarried couple are permitted, before they contract, to see one another\r\nnaked.  This they dislike; for they think it a scorn to give a refusal\r\nafter so familiar knowledge: but because of many hidden defects in men\r\nand women's bodies, they have a more civil way; for they have near\r\nevery town a couple of pools, (which they call Adam and Eve's pools,)\r\nwhere it is permitted to one of the friends of the men, and another of\r\nthe friends of the woman, to see them severally bathe naked.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as we were thus in conference, there came one that seemed to be a\r\nmessenger, in a rich huke, that spake with the Jew: whereupon he turned\r\nto me and said; \"You will pardon me, for I am commanded away in haste.\"\r\nThe next morning he came to me again, joyful as it seemed, and said;\r\n\"There is word come to the Governor of the city, that one of the\r\nFathers of Salomon's House will be here this day seven-night: we have\r\nseen none of them this dozen years.  His coming is in state; but the\r\ncause of his coming is secret.  I will provide you and your fellows of\r\na good standing to see his entry.\"  I thanked him, and told him, I was\r\nmost glad of the news.\r\n\r\nThe day being come, he made his entry.  He was a man of middle stature\r\nand age, comely of person, and had an aspect as if he pitied men.  He\r\nwas clothed in a robe of fine black cloth, with wide sleeves and a\r\ncape.  His under garment was of excellent white linen down to the foot,\r\ngirt with a girdle of the same; and a sindon or tippet of the same\r\nabout his neck.  He had gloves, that were curious,'' and set with\r\nstone; and shoes of peach-coloured velvet.  His neck was bare to the\r\nshoulders.  His hat was like a helmet, or Spanish montera; and his\r\nlocks curled below it decently: they were of colour brown.  His beard\r\nwas cut round, and of the same colour with his hair, somewhat lighter.\r\nHe was carried in a rich chariot without wheels, litter-wise; with two\r\nhorses at either end, richly trapped in blue velvet embroidered; and\r\ntwo footmen on each side in the like attire.  The chariot was all of\r\ncedar, gilt, and adorned with crystal; save that the fore-end had\r\npanels of sapphires, set in borders of gold; and the hinder-end the\r\nlike of emeralds of the Peru colour.  There was also a sun of gold,\r\nradiant, upon the top, in the midst; and on the top before, a small\r\ncherub of gold, with wings displayed.  The chariot was covered with\r\ncloth of gold tissued upon blue.  He had before him fifty attendants,\r\nyoung men all, in white satin loose coats to the mid leg; and stockings\r\nof white silk; and shoes of blue velvet; and hats of blue velvet; with\r\nfine plumes of diverse colours, set round like hat-bands. Next before\r\nthe chariot, went two men, bare-headed, in linen garments down the\r\nfoot, girt, and shoes of blue velvet; who carried, the one a crosier,\r\nthe other a pastoral staff like a sheep-hook; neither of them of metal,\r\nbut the crosier of balm-wood, the pastoral staff of cedar. Horsemen he\r\nhad none, neither before nor behind his chariot: as it seemeth, to\r\navoid all tumult and trouble.  Behind his chariot went all the officers\r\nand principals of the companies of the city.  He sat alone, upon\r\ncushions of a kind of excellent plush, blue; and under his foot curious\r\ncarpets of silk of diverse colours, like the Persian, but far finer.\r\nHe held up his bare hand as he went, as blessing the people, but in\r\nsilence.  The street was wonderfully well kept: so that there was never\r\nany army had their men stand in better battle-array than the people\r\nstood.  The windows likewise were not crowded, but every one stood in\r\nthem as if they had been placed.\r\n\r\nWhen the shew was past, the Jew said to me; \"I shall not be able to\r\nattend you as I would, in regard of some charge the city hath laid upon\r\nme, for the entertaining of this great person.\"  Three days after the\r\nJew came to me again, and said; \"Ye are happy men; for the Father of\r\nSalomon's House taketh knowledge of your being here, and commanded me\r\nto tell you that he will admit all your company to his presence, and\r\nhave private conference with one of you, that ye shall choose: and for\r\nthis hath appointed the next day after to-morrow.  And because he\r\nmeaneth to give you his blessing, he hath appointed it in the forenoon.\"\r\n\r\nWe came at our day and hour, and I was chosen by my fellows for the\r\nprivate access.  We found him in a fair chamber, richly hanged, and\r\ncarpeted under foot without any degrees to the state.  He was set upon\r\na low Throne richly adorned, and a rich cloth of state over his head,\r\nof blue satin embroidered.  He was alone, save that he had two pages of\r\nhonour, on either hand one, finely attired in white.  His under\r\ngarments were the like that we saw him wear in the chariot; but instead\r\nof his gown, he had on him a mantle with a cape, of the same fine\r\nblack, fastened about him.  When we came in, as we were taught, we\r\nbowed low at our first entrance; and when we were come near his chair,\r\nhe stood up, holding forth his hand ungloved, and in posture of\r\nblessing; and we every one of us stooped down, and kissed the hem of\r\nhis tippet.  That done, the rest departed, and I remained.  Then he\r\nwarned the pages forth of the room, and caused me to sit down beside\r\nhim, and spake to me thus in the Spanish tongue.\r\n\r\n\"God bless thee, my son; I will give thee the greatest jewel I have.\r\nFor I will impart unto thee, for the love of God and men, a relation of\r\nthe true state of Salomon's House.  Son, to make you know the true\r\nstate of Salomon's House, I will keep this order.  First, I will set\r\nforth unto you the end of our foundation.  Secondly, the preparations\r\nand instruments we have for our works.  Thirdly, the several\r\nemployments and functions whereto our fellows are assigned.  And\r\nfourthly, the ordinances and rites which we observe.\r\n\r\n\"The end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes, and secret\r\nmotions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to\r\nthe effecting of all things possible.\r\n\r\n\"The Preparations and Instruments are these.  We have large and deep\r\ncaves of several depths: the deepest are sunk six hundred fathom: and\r\nsome of them are digged and made under great hills and mountains: so\r\nthat if you reckon together the depth of the hill and the depth of the\r\ncave, they are (some of them) above three miles deep.  For we find,\r\nthat the depth of a hill, and the depth of a cave from the flat, is the\r\nsame thing; both remote alike, from the sun and heaven's beams, and\r\nfrom the open air.  These caves we call the Lower Region; and we use\r\nthem for all coagulations, indurations, refrigerations, and\r\nconservations of bodies.  We use them likewise for the imitation of\r\nnatural mines; and the producing also of new artificial metals, by\r\ncompositions and materials which we use, and lay there for many years.\r\nWe use them also sometimes, (which may seem strange,) for curing of\r\nsome diseases, and for prolongation of life in some hermits that choose\r\nto live there, well accommodated of all things necessary, and indeed\r\nlive very long; by whom also we learn many things.\r\n\r\n\"We have burials in several earths, where we put diverse cements, as\r\nthe Chineses do their porcellain.  But we have them in greater variety,\r\nand some of them more fine.  We have also great variety of composts and\r\nsoils, for the making of the earth fruitful.\r\n\r\n\"We have high towers; the highest about half a mile in height; and some\r\nof them likewise set upon high mountains; so that the vantage of the\r\nhill with the tower is in the highest of them three miles at least. And\r\nthese places we call the Upper Region; accounting the air between the\r\nhigh places and the low, as a Middle Region.  We use these towers,\r\naccording to their several heights, and situations, for insolation,\r\nrefrigeration, conservation; and for the view of divers meteors; as\r\nwinds, rain, snow, hail; and some of the fiery meteors also.  And upon\r\nthem, in some places, are dwellings of hermits, whom we visit\r\nsometimes, and instruct what to observe.\r\n\r\n\"We have great lakes, both salt, and fresh; whereof we have use for the\r\nfish and fowl.  We use them also for burials of some natural bodies:\r\nfor we find a difference in things buried in earth or in air below the\r\nearth, and things buried in water.  We have also pools, of which some\r\ndo strain fresh water out of salt; and others by art do turn fresh\r\nwater into salt.  We have also some rocks in the midst of the sea, and\r\nsome bays upon the shore for some works, wherein is required the air\r\nand vapor of the sea.  We have likewise violent streams and cataracts,\r\nwhich serve us for many motions: and likewise engines for multiplying\r\nand enforcing of winds, to set also on going diverse motions.\r\n\r\n\"We have also a number of artificial wells and fountains, made in\r\nimitation of the natural sources and baths; as tincted upon vitriol,\r\nsulphur, steel, brass, lead, nitre, and other minerals.  And again we\r\nhave little wells for infusions of many things, where the waters take\r\nthe virtue quicker and better, than in vessels or basins.  And amongst\r\nthem we have a water which we call Water of Paradise, being, by that we\r\ndo to it made very sovereign for health, and prolongation of life.\r\n\r\n\"We have also great and spacious houses where we imitate and\r\ndemonstrate meteors; as snow, hail, rain, some artificial rains of\r\nbodies and not of water, thunders, lightnings; also generations of\r\nbodies in air; as frogs, flies, and divers others.\r\n\r\n\"We have also certain chambers, which we call Chambers of Health, where\r\nwe qualify the air as we think good and proper for the cure of divers\r\ndiseases, and preservation of health.\r\n\r\n\"We have also fair and large baths, of several mixtures, for the cure\r\nof diseases, and the restoring of man's body from arefaction: and\r\nothers for the confirming of it in strength of sinewes, vital parts,\r\nand the very juice and substance of the body.\r\n\r\n\"We have also large and various orchards and gardens; wherein we do not\r\nso much respect beauty, as variety of ground and soil, proper for\r\ndivers trees and herbs: and some very spacious, where trees and berries\r\nare set whereof we make divers kinds of drinks, besides the vineyards.\r\nIn these we practise likewise all conclusions of grafting, and\r\ninoculating as well of wild-trees as fruit-trees, which produceth many\r\neffects.  And we make (by art) in the same orchards and gardens, trees\r\nand flowers to come earlier or later than their seasons; and to come up\r\nand bear more speedily than by their natural course they do. We make\r\nthem also by art greater much than their nature; and their fruit\r\ngreater and sweeter and of differing taste, smell, colour, and figure,\r\nfrom their nature.  And many of them we so order, as they become of\r\nmedicinal use.\r\n\r\n\"We have also means to make divers plants rise by mixtures of earths\r\nwithout seeds; and likewise to make divers new plants, differing from\r\nthe vulgar; and to make one tree or plant turn into another.\r\n\r\n\"We have also parks and enclosures of all sorts of beasts and birds\r\nwhich we use not only for view or rareness, but likewise for\r\ndissections and trials; that thereby we may take light what may be\r\nwrought upon the body of man.  Wherein we find many strange effects; as\r\ncontinuing life in them, though divers parts, which you account vital,\r\nbe perished and taken forth; resuscitating of some that seem dead in\r\nappearance; and the like.  We try also all poisons and other medicines\r\nupon them, as well of chirurgery, as physic.  By art likewise, we make\r\nthem greater or taller than their kind is; and contrariwise dwarf them,\r\nand stay their growth: we make them more fruitful and bearing than\r\ntheir kind is; and contrariwise barren and not generative.  Also we\r\nmake them differ in colour, shape, activity, many ways.  We find means\r\nto make commixtures and copulations of different kinds; which have\r\nproduced many new kinds, and them not barren, as the general opinion\r\nis.  We make a number of kinds of serpents, worms, flies, fishes, of\r\nputrefaction; whereof some are advanced (in effect) to be perfect\r\ncreatures, like bests or birds; and have sexes, and do propagate.\r\nNeither do we this by chance, but we know beforehand, of what matter\r\nand commixture what kind of those creatures will arise.\r\n\r\n\"We have also particular pools, where we make trials upon fishes, as we\r\nhave said before of beasts and birds.\r\n\r\n\"We have also places for breed and generation of those kinds of worms\r\nand flies which are of special use; such as are with you your\r\nsilk-worms and bees.\r\n\r\n\"I will not hold you long with recounting of our brewhouses,\r\nbake-houses, and kitchens, where are made divers drinks, breads, and\r\nmeats, rare and of special effects.  Wines we have of grapes; and\r\ndrinks of other juice of fruits, of grains, and of roots; and of\r\nmixtures with honey, sugar, manna, and fruits dried, and decocted; Also\r\nof the tears or woundings of trees; and of the pulp of canes. And these\r\ndrinks are of several ages, some to the age or last of forty years.  We\r\nhave drinks also brewed with several herbs, and roots, and spices; yea\r\nwith several fleshes, and white-meats; whereof some of the drinks are\r\nsuch, as they are in effect meat and drink both: so that divers,\r\nespecially in age, do desire to live with them, with little or no meat\r\nor bread.  And above all, we strive to have drink of extreme thin\r\nparts, to insinuate into the body, and yet without all biting,\r\nsharpness, or fretting; insomuch as some of them put upon the back of\r\nyour hand will, with a little stay, pass through to the palm, and yet\r\ntaste mild to the mouth.  We have also waters which we ripen in that\r\nfashion, as they become nourishing; so that they are indeed excellent\r\ndrink; and many will use no other.  Breads we have of several grains,\r\nroots, and kernels; yea and some of flesh and fish dried; with divers\r\nkinds of leavenings and seasonings: so that some do extremely move\r\nappetites; some do nourish so, as divers do live of them, without any\r\nother meat; who live very long.  So for meats, we have some of them so\r\nbeaten and made tender and mortified,' yet without all corrupting, as a\r\nweak heat of the stomach will turn them into good chylus; as well as a\r\nstrong heat would meat otherwise prepared.  We have some meats also and\r\nbreads and drinks, which taken by men enable them to fast long after;\r\nand some other, that used make the very flesh of men's bodies sensibly'\r\nmore hard and tough and their strength far greater than otherwise it\r\nwould be.\r\n\r\n\"We have dispensatories, or shops of medicines.  Wherein you may easily\r\nthink, if we have such variety of plants and living creatures more than\r\nyou have in Europe, (for we know what you have,) the simples, drugs,\r\nand ingredients of medicines, must likewise be in so much the greater\r\nvariety.  We have them likewise of divers ages, and long fermentations.\r\nAnd for their preparations, we have not only all manner of exquisite\r\ndistillations and separations, and especially by gentle heats and\r\npercolations through divers strainers, yea and substances; but also\r\nexact forms of composition, whereby they incorporate almost, as they\r\nwere natural simples.\r\n\r\n\"We have also divers mechanical arts, which you have not; and stuffs\r\nmade by them; as papers, linen, silks, tissues; dainty works of\r\nfeathers of wonderful lustre; excellent dies, and, many others; and\r\nshops likewise, as well for such as are not brought into vulgar use\r\namongst us as for those that are.  For you must know that of the things\r\nbefore recited, many of them are grown into use throughout the kingdom;\r\nbut yet, if they did flow from our invention, we have of them also for\r\npatterns and principals.\r\n\r\n\"We have also furnaces of great diversities, and that keep great\r\ndiversity of heats; fierce and quick; strong and constant; soft and\r\nmild; blown, quiet; dry, moist; and the like.  But above all, we have\r\nheats, in imitation of the Sun's and heavenly bodies' heats, that pass\r\ndivers inequalities, and (as it were) orbs, progresses, and returns,\r\nwhereby we produce admirable effects.  Besides, we have heats of dungs;\r\nand of bellies and maws of living creatures, and of their bloods and\r\nbodies; and of hays and herbs laid up moist; of lime unquenched; and\r\nsuch like.  Instruments also which generate heat only by motion.  And\r\nfarther, places for strong insulations; and again, places under the\r\nearth, which by nature, or art, yield heat.  These divers heats we use,\r\nas the nature of the operation, which we intend, requireth.\r\n\r\n\"We have also perspective-houses, where we make demonstrations of all\r\nlights and radiations; and of all colours: and out of things uncoloured\r\nand transparent, we can represent unto you all several colours; not in\r\nrain-bows, (as it is in gems, and prisms,) but of themselves single.\r\nWe represent also all multiplications of light, which we carry to great\r\ndistance, and make so sharp as to discern small points and lines.  Also\r\nall colourations of light; all delusions and deceits of the sight, in\r\nfigures, magnitudes, motions, colours all demonstrations of shadows.\r\nWe find also divers means, yet unknown to you, of producing of light\r\noriginally from divers bodies.  We procure means of seeing objects afar\r\noff; as in the heaven and remote places; and represent things near as\r\nafar off; and things afar off as near; making feigned distances.  We\r\nhave also helps for the sight, far above spectacles and glasses in use.\r\nWe have also glasses and means to see small and minute bodies perfectly\r\nand distinctly; as the shapes and colours of small flies and worms,\r\ngrains and flaws in gems, which cannot otherwise be seen, observations\r\nin urine and blood not otherwise to be seen.  We make artificial\r\nrain-bows, halo's, and circles about light.  We represent also all\r\nmanner of reflexions, refractions, and multiplications of visual beams\r\nof objects.\r\n\r\n\"We have also precious stones of all kinds, many of them of great\r\nbeauty, and to you unknown; crystals likewise; and glasses of divers\r\nkinds; and amongst them some of metals vitrificated, and other\r\nmaterials besides those of which you make glass.  Also a number of\r\nfossils, and imperfect minerals, which you have not.  Likewise\r\nloadstones of prodigious virtue; and other rare stones, both natural\r\nand artificial.\r\n\r\n\"We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all\r\nsounds, and their generation.  We have harmonies which you have not, of\r\nquarter-sounds, and lesser slides of sounds.  Divers instruments of\r\nmusic likewise to you unknown, some sweeter than any you have, together\r\nwith bells and rings that are dainty and sweet.  We represent small\r\nsounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds extenuate and sharp; we\r\nmake divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in their original\r\nare entire.  We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and\r\nletters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds.  We have certain\r\nhelps which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also\r\ndivers strange and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times,\r\nand as it were tossing it: and some that give back the voice louder\r\nthan it came, some shriller, and some deeper; yea, some rendering the\r\nvoice differing in the letters or articulate sound from that they\r\nreceive.  We have also means to convey sounds in trunks and pipes, in\r\nstrange lines and distances.\r\n\r\n\"We have also perfume-houses; wherewith we join also practices of\r\ntaste.  We multiply smells, which may seem strange.  We imitate smells,\r\nmaking all smells to breathe outs of other mixtures than those that\r\ngive them.  We make divers imitations of taste likewise, so that they\r\nwill deceive any man's taste.  And in this house we contain also a\r\nconfiture-house; where we make all sweet-meats, dry and moist; and\r\ndivers pleasant wines, milks, broths, and sallets; in far greater\r\nvariety than you have.\r\n\r\n\"We have also engine-houses, where are prepared engines and instruments\r\nfor all sorts of motions.  There we imitate and practise to make\r\nswifter motions than any you have, either out of your muskets or any\r\nengine that you have: and to make them and multiply them more easily,\r\nand with small force, by wheels and other means: and to make them\r\nstronger and more violent than yours are; exceeding your greatest\r\ncannons and basilisks.  We represent also ordnance and instruments of\r\nwar, and engines of all kinds: and likewise new mixtures and\r\ncompositions of gun-powder, wild-fires burning in water, and\r\nunquenchable.  Also fireworks of all variety both for pleasure and use.\r\nWe imitate also flights of birds; we have some degrees of flying in the\r\nair.  We have ships and boats for going under water, and brooking of\r\nseas; also swimming-girdles and supporters.  We have divers curious\r\nclocks, and other like motions of return: and some perpetual motions.\r\nWe imitate also motions of living creatures, by images, of men, beasts,\r\nbirds, fishes, and serpents.  We have also a great number of other\r\nvarious motions, strange for equality, fineness, and subtilty.\r\n\r\n\"We have also a mathematical house, where are represented all\r\ninstruments, as well of geometry as astronomy, exquisitely made.\r\n\r\n\"We have also houses of deceits of the senses; where we represent all\r\nmanner of feats of juggling, false apparitions, impostures, and\r\nillusions; and their fallacies.  And surely you will easily believe\r\nthat we that have so many things truly natural which induce admiration,\r\ncould in a world of particulars deceive the senses, if we would\r\ndisguise those things and labour to make them seem more miraculous. But\r\nwe do hate all impostures, and lies; insomuch as we have severely\r\nforbidden it to all our fellows, under pain of ignominy and fines, that\r\nthey do not show any natural work or thing, adorned or swelling; but\r\nonly pure as it is, and without all affectation of strangeness.\r\n\r\n\"These are (my son) the riches of Salomon's House.\r\n\r\n\"For the several employments and offices of our fellows; we have twelve\r\nthat sail into foreign countries, under the names of other nations,\r\n(for our own we conceal); who bring us the books, and abstracts, and\r\npatterns of experiments of all other parts.  These we call Merchants of\r\nLight.\r\n\r\n\"We have three that collect the experiments which are in all books.\r\nThese we call Depredators.\r\n\r\n\"We have three that collect the experiments of all mechanical arts; and\r\nalso of liberal sciences; and also of practices which are not brought\r\ninto arts.  These we call Mystery-men.\r\n\r\n\"We have three that try new experiments, such as themselves think good.\r\nThese we call Pioneers or Miners.\r\n\r\n\"We have three that draw the experiments of the former four into titles\r\nand tables, to give the better light for the drawing of observations\r\nand axioms out of them.  These we call Compilers.\r\n\r\n\"We have three that bend themselves, looking into the experiments of\r\ntheir fellows, and cast about how to draw out of them things of use and\r\npractise for man's life, and knowledge, as well for works as for plain\r\ndemonstration of causes, means of natural divinations, and the easy and\r\nclear discovery of the virtues and parts of bodies.  These we call\r\nDowry-men or Benefactors.\r\n\r\n\"Then after divers meetings and consults of our whole number, to\r\nconsider of the former labours and collections, we have three that take\r\ncare, out of them, to direct new experiments, of a higher light, more\r\npenetrating into nature than the former.  These we call Lamps.\r\n\r\n\"We have three others that do execute the experiments so directed, and\r\nreport them.  These we call Inoculators.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, we have three that raise the former discoveries by experiments\r\ninto greater observations, axioms, and aphorisms.  These we call\r\nInterpreters of Nature.\r\n\r\n\"We have also, as you must think, novices and apprentices, that the\r\nsuccession of the former employed men do not fail; besides, a great\r\nnumber of servants and attendants, men and women.  And this we do also:\r\nwe have consultations, which of the inventions and experiences which we\r\nhave discovered shall be published, and which not: and take all an oath\r\nof secrecy, for the concealing of those which we think fit to keep\r\nsecret: though some of those we do reveal sometimes to the state and\r\nsome not.\r\n\r\n\"For our ordinances and rites: we have two very long and fair\r\ngalleries: in one of these we place patterns and samples of all manner\r\nof the more rare and excellent inventions in the other we place the\r\nstatues of all principal inventors.  There we have the statue of your\r\nColumbus, that discovered the West Indies: also the inventor of ships:\r\nyour monk that was the inventor of ordnance and of gunpowder: the\r\ninventor of music: the inventor of letters: the inventor of printing:\r\nthe inventor of observations of astronomy: the inventor of works in\r\nmetal: the inventor of glass: the inventor of silk of the worm: the\r\ninventor of wine: the inventor of corn and bread: the inventor of\r\nsugars: and all these, by more certain tradition than you have.  Then\r\nhave we divers inventors of our own, of excellent works; which since\r\nyou have not seen, it were too long to make descriptions of them; and\r\nbesides, in the right understanding of those descriptions you might\r\neasily err.  For upon every invention of value, we erect a statue to\r\nthe inventor, and give him a liberal and honourable reward.  These\r\nstatues are some of brass; some of marble and touch-stone; some of\r\ncedar and other special woods gilt and adorned; some of iron; some of\r\nsilver; some of gold.\r\n\r\n\"We have certain hymns and services, which we say daily, of Lord and\r\nthanks to God for his marvellous works: and forms of prayers, imploring\r\nhis aid and blessing for the illumination of our labours, and the\r\nturning of them into good and holy uses.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, we have circuits or visits of divers principal cities of the\r\nkingdom; where, as it cometh to pass, we do publish such new profitable\r\ninventions as we think good.  And we do also declare natural\r\ndivinations of diseases, plagues, swarms-of hurtful creatures,\r\nscarcity, tempests, earthquakes, great inundations, comets, temperature\r\nof the year, and divers other things; and we give counsel thereupon,\r\nwhat the people shall do for the prevention and remedy of them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when he had said this, he stood up; and I, as I had been taught,\r\nkneeled down, and he laid his right hand upon my head, and said; \"God\r\nbless thee, my son; and God bless this relation, which I have made.  I\r\ngive thee leave to publish it for the good of other nations; for we\r\nhere are in God's bosom, a land unknown.\"  And so he left me; having\r\nassigned a value of about two thousand ducats, for a bounty to me and\r\nmy fellows.  For they give great largesses where they come upon all\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\n[The rest was not perfected.]",
