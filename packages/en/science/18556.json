MIGUEL SADERRA MASÓ, S. J.\r\n\r\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE WEATHER BUREAU\r\n\r\nMANILA\r\nBUREAU OF PRINTING\r\n1910\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALOGUE OF VIOLENT AND DESTRUCTIVE EARTHQUAKES IN THE PHILIPPINES\r\n(1599-1909).\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction.--The occasion for publishing this catalogue of\r\nPhilippine earthquakes which were of violent and destructive character\r\nhas been furnished by a request from Prof. John Milne for a list of\r\nsuch phenomena, to be included in the General Earthquake Catalogue\r\nwhich this eminent seismologist is preparing under the auspices of the\r\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science. The said general\r\ncatalogue has been undertaken with a view toward reducing to\r\nuniformity and completing those published years ago by Robert Mallet\r\n(1859) and Perrey (1844-1871). The form adopted for Professor Milne's\r\nnew catalogue is very concise, comprising only the date, intensity,\r\nand region together with principal localities affected. It will\r\ncontain only the earthquakes of intensities VII to X according to the\r\nscale of De Rossi-Forel, and these will be divided into three classes:\r\nClass I will be formed by the earthquakes of sufficient force to\r\nproduce cracks in buildings and to throw down chimneys; they\r\ncorrespond to force VII of De Rossi-Forel. Class II consists of the\r\nearthquakes which not only threw down chimneys but also walls and some\r\nweak structures; force VIII of De Rossi-Forel. Class III comprises the\r\nearthquakes which caused general destruction; force IX and X of De\r\nRossi-Forel. As this classification is as purely conventional as every\r\nother and adopted only in the catalogue mentioned, we do not employ it\r\nin the present catalogue of Philippine earthquakes, but retain the\r\nalmost universally adopted scale of De Rossi-Forel. We shall also\r\npresent more details as to the towns and buildings damaged, the number\r\nof victims and other disastrous effects than enter into the catalogue\r\nof Professor Milne.\r\n\r\nHence, the differences between the list prepared for Professor Milne\r\nas well as the partial catalogue published in our Monthly Bulletin for\r\nFebruary of the present year consist in the following: (1) This\r\ncatalogue contains also several earthquakes whose intensities were\r\nbetween VI and VII, while in the former only such figure as according\r\nto their effects were decidedly of force VII. (2) The new catalogue is\r\nmore complete as to details concerning the towns, etc., which have\r\nbeen destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that we are unable to present here a complete\r\nhistorical catalogue of all the destruction wrought in the Archipelago\r\nby earthquakes since the time when Legaspi and Urdaneta first set foot\r\non these shores. But the old chroniclers, who dwell upon the political\r\nhappenings with an attention to detail which is occasionally overdone,\r\nwere invariably laconic when there was question of earthquakes and\r\nsimilar natural phenomena; as a rule they were satisfied with\r\nmentioning the occurrence in a general and therefore vague way,\r\nwithout any attempt at precision as to dates and places. Still the\r\nwriters in the Philippines did nothing worse than imitate their\r\ncolleagues throughout the rest of the world. This fact is responsible\r\nfor the great contrast exhibited by our catalogue as regards the\r\nnumber and details of earthquakes which occurred prior to 1800,\r\nrecords of which have been preserved, and the same data for the period\r\nfrom 1800 to the present time. This same difference is observable in\r\nall catalogues of a similar nature, even in those which cover\r\nphenomena which occurred in Europe. As to the Philippine writers, an\r\nadditional excuse is found in the peculiar conditions of life in these\r\nIslands. As far as we know, only two earthquakes which took place\r\nduring the period which alone can come under consideration--that is,\r\nsince the discovery of the Archipelago--have claimed a considerable\r\nnumber of victims, and these in the capital, because outside of\r\nManila--if we except two or three of the principal cities--the\r\nbuildings which could become dangerous during an earthquake have\r\nalways been few.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in a country in which fires consume every year thousands of\r\ndwellings and where the terrible typhoons frequently destroy whole\r\ntowns with heavy loss of lives, the damage done by earthquakes has\r\nrarely been so great as to impress those occurrences indelibly upon\r\nthe memory. This is beyond doubt one of the reasons why prior to the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century hardly any data can be found\r\nconcerning the numerous earthquakes which during the preceding two\r\ncenturies must have occurred in the Visayas and above all on the large\r\nIsland of Mindanao.\r\n\r\nThe first earthquake of which the chronicles contain a mention is that\r\nof 1599. There is no reasonable doubt that during the twenty-eight\r\nyears which had then elapsed since the founding of Manila by Legaspi,\r\nseveral strong and possibly even destructive earthquakes occurred in\r\nthis part of Luzon Island, but, as the author of the \"Verdadera\r\nrelación de la grande destrucción * * * del año 1645\" tells us, \"when\r\nfirst founded, Manila consisted of wooden houses roofed with a certain\r\nkind of palm leaves, the same which the natives use in their\r\nbuildings.\" Hence the damage done by these earthquakes must have been\r\ninsignificant. Much more terrible were the losses caused by\r\nconflagrations which within a few years twice wiped out the entire\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe first Bishop of Manila, Domingo de Salazar, seeing the city\r\nexposed to such general destructions by fire like the one of February\r\n14, 1583, gave the first impulse to the construction of stone\r\nbuildings and worked indefatigably in this direction. In person he\r\nexplored the surroundings of Manila in quest of stone quarries and by\r\nthe middle of the year 1591 he had nearly finished his palace and the\r\ncathedral, when financial difficulties caused a temporary suspension\r\nof the work. At the same time a great number of public and private\r\nbuildings were under construction. The enthusiasm for structures of\r\nstone or brick with tile roofs did not diminish during the next fifty\r\nyears. The chroniclers tell us that \"the Spaniards began to build\r\ntheir houses of stone and tiles without the so necessary precautions\r\nagainst earthquakes. * * * Beautiful structures and dwelling houses\r\nwere reared, so high and spacious that they resembled palaces;\r\nmagnificent churches with lofty and graceful towers, within the walls\r\nof Manila as well as outside of them: all of which made the city very\r\nbeautiful and gay and contributed equally to health and pleasure.\" The\r\ndisaster of 1645, commonly called the earthquake of St. Andrew, as it\r\noccurred on the feast of this apostle, November 30, razed nearly every\r\none of these buildings to the ground, and since then the style and\r\nappearance of buildings has changed greatly throughout the\r\nArchipelago, with a correspondingly great saving of lives in the\r\nsubsequent earthquakes.\r\n\r\nMasonry arches were henceforth banished from the churches; the heavy\r\nwalls of the latter were further strengthened by massive buttresses;\r\nand the towers were given truly enormous substructures. But even with\r\nthese precautions there is at present hardly one out of the hundreds\r\nof churches built during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\r\nwhich did not some time or other require important repairs of its\r\nmasonry work or even partial reconstruction owing to earthquake\r\ndamages. The only structure of this class which thus far has withstood\r\nall convulsions, is the church of St. Agustin, Manila. Nevertheless,\r\nas we have stated before, the chroniclers hardly mention all this\r\ndestruction, except in a very general and cursory manner. I do not\r\nhesitate to say: they were accustomed to see similar havoc created\r\nnearly every year in one part of the Archipelago or the other by some\r\nsevere typhoon, accompanied by far greater loss of lives and property,\r\nand consequently much more felt by the people than the destruction of\r\na church, _convento_, municipal building (\"tribunal\"), one or two\r\nbridges, or other masonry structure.\r\n\r\nIn the present catalogue our aim has been to present all that is known\r\nof the various violent and destructive earthquakes on record. The\r\nfirst column of each page contains the ordinal number of the\r\ndisturbance for purposes of reference. In the second, the date is\r\ngiven as accurately as it could be ascertained, Roman numerals being\r\nused to designate the months. Unfortunately, of some earthquakes only\r\nthe year is known; of others, the year and month. Of one (No. 32) the\r\napproximate hour has been recorded, but not the day of the month;\r\nwhile of another (No. 38) the hour has been preserved for posterity,\r\nbut whether the phenomenon occurred during February or March, the\r\nrecords leave undecided. In the third column will be found, in the\r\nfirst place, the intensity of the disturbance, Roman numerals\r\nrepresenting the degrees of the scale of De Rossi-Forel (I-X); then\r\nthe region affected most, and finally the damages caused, if known,\r\nand other information, if available.\r\n\r\nIn describing the epicentral regions, the present distribution of the\r\nArchipelago into provinces has been used throughout the catalogue.\r\nThis division is shown on the first of the two maps of the Philippines\r\nwhich accompany this catalogue (Plate I). As to the designation\r\n\"Benguet\" occasionally occurring in the text where provinces are\r\nenumerated, but not found on the map, we beg to offer the excuse that\r\nthe region thus named is exceedingly well known in the Philippines as\r\nit contains Baguio, _the_ health resort of the Islands. For the\r\nreaders outside of the Archipelago we remark that Benguet is at\r\npresent a subprovince of the Mountain Province, of which it forms the\r\nsouthernmost part. The location of Baguio is shown on the map on Plate\r\nII. A similar remark applies to Lepanto and Bontoc, likewise divisions\r\nof the Mountain Province, whose capitals, Cervantes and Bontoc, are\r\nindicated on the same map.\r\n\r\nAs we would hardly be justified in assuming that every reader is in\r\npossession of a detailed map of the Philippines, and a knowledge of\r\nthe general distribution and the main directions of the principal\r\nmountain systems of an earthquake country is important, we add a\r\nsecond map on which these data are shown by means of dashes, together\r\nwith the most important seismic regions, and the positions of the\r\nprincipal towns, bays, etc., mentioned in the text. (Plate II.)\r\n\r\nNear the left margin of this second map will be found an index of the\r\nseismic regions just mentioned, each of them being represented by its\r\nordinal number (large Roman figures). Near each of these ordinals is\r\nplaced the corresponding number of earthquakes since 1862 contained in\r\nthe catalogue (Arabic figures), which is followed, in brackets, by an\r\nanalysis of the said number, in which Roman figures designate the\r\ndegrees of the earthquake, scale of De Rossi-Forel, while small Arabic\r\nfigures, written like exponents, give the number of earthquakes of\r\neach degree of intensity.\r\n\r\nIn drawing the map on Plate II it was not intended to represent the\r\nepicentric area of every individual earthquake center (which would\r\nhave crowded the map beyond reasonable limits), but rather to show the\r\nprincipal seismic regions. Hence most of these curves contain more\r\nthan one focus. The approximate position of each of the latter has,\r\nhowever, been indicated by a star, while the figure placed close to\r\nthe star gives the number of earthquakes which proceeded from the said\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nA word must be said in apology for the constant use in the following\r\nlist of the Spanish word \"_convento_.\" This word which means\r\nmonastery, cloister, or convent, is universally used in the\r\nPhilippines to designate also the habitation of the clergy attached to\r\na parish church. Although these are, as a rule, spacious buildings and\r\nwere formerly inhabited well-nigh exclusively by friars, they can not\r\nproperly be called monasteries. Wherefore, in order to avoid lengthy\r\ncircumlocutions, the Spanish word \"_convento_\" has been retained.\r\n\r\nThe reader who is not familiar with this country may find it strange\r\nthat in reporting earthquake damages so much emphasis appears to be\r\nlaid on the harm done to churches and _conventos_. This is easily\r\nexplained by the fact that these buildings were often the only\r\nstructures within the meizoseismal area, and built nearly everywhere\r\nin the most substantial manner.\r\n\r\nIn the present catalogue we have also included, by way of an appendix,\r\nthe earthquakes which are known to have occurred in the Marianas or\r\nLadrones group of islands. While their number is too small to warrant\r\nseparate publication, we believe that the data concerning them will be\r\nwelcome to the earthquake investigator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALOGUE OF VIOLENT AND DESTRUCTIVE EARTHQUAKES IN THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\n----+--------------------+-----+------------------------------------------\r\nNo. |       Date.        |Intensity.\r\n    |                    |     |        Epicenter and effects.\r\n----+--------------------+-----+------------------------------------------\r\n    | _Y.
