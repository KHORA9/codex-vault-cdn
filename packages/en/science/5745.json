ALLAN QUATERMAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friend, into whose hands I hope that all these manuscripts of mine\r\nwill pass one day, of this one I have something to say to you.\r\n\r\nA long while ago I jotted down in it the history of the events that it\r\ndetails with more or less completeness. This I did for my own\r\nsatisfaction. You will have noted how memory fails us as we advance in\r\nyears; we recollect, with an almost painful exactitude, what we\r\nexperienced and saw in our youth, but the happenings of our middle life\r\nslip away from us or become blurred, like a stretch of low-lying\r\nlandscape overflowed by grey and nebulous mist. Far off the sun still\r\nseems to shine upon the plains and hills of adolescence and early\r\nmanhood, as yet it shines about us in the fleeting hours of our age,\r\nthat ground on which we stand to-day, but the valley between is filled\r\nwith fog. Yes, even its prominences, which symbolise the more startling\r\nevents of that past, often are lost in this confusing fog.\r\n\r\nIt was an appreciation of these truths which led me to set down the\r\nfollowing details (though of course much is omitted) of my brief\r\nintercourse with the strange and splendid creature whom I knew under\r\nthe names of _Ayesha_, or _Híya_, or _She-who-commands_; not indeed\r\nwith any view to their publication, but before I forgot them that, if I\r\nwished to do so, I might re-peruse them in the evening of old age to\r\nwhich I hope to attain.\r\n\r\nIndeed, at the time the last thing I intended was that they should be\r\ngiven to the world even after my own death, because they, or many of\r\nthem, are so unusual that I feared lest they should cause smiles and in\r\na way cast a slur upon my memory and truthfulness. Also, as you will\r\nread, as to this matter I made a promise and I have always tried to\r\nkeep my promises and to guard the secrets of others. For these reasons\r\nI proposed, in case I neglected or forgot to destroy them myself, to\r\nleave a direction that this should be done by my executors. Further, I\r\nhave been careful to make no allusion _whatever_ to them either in\r\ncasual conversation or in anything else that I may have written, my\r\ndesire being that this page of my life should be kept quite private,\r\nsomething known only to myself. Therefore, too, I never so much as\r\nhinted of them to anyone, not even to yourself to whom I have told so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nWell, I recorded the main facts concerning this expedition and its\r\nissues, simply and with as much exactness as I could, and laid them\r\naside. I do not say that I never thought of them again, since amongst\r\nthem were some which, together with the problems they suggested, proved\r\nto be of an unforgettable nature.\r\n\r\nAlso, whenever any of Ayesha’s sayings or stories which are not\r\npreserved in these pages came back to me, as has happened from time to\r\ntime, I jotted them down and put them away with this manuscript. Thus\r\namong these notes you will find a history of the city of Kôr as she\r\ntold it to me, which I have omitted here. Still, many of these\r\nremarkable events did more or less fade from my mind, as the image does\r\nfrom an unfixed photograph, till only their outlines remained, faint if\r\ndistinguishable.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I was rather ashamed of the whole story in which I\r\ncut so poor a figure. On reflection it was obvious to me, although\r\nhonesty had compelled me to set out all that is essential exactly as it\r\noccurred, adding nothing and taking nothing away, that I had been the\r\nvictim of very gross deceit. This strange woman, whom I had met in the\r\nruins of a place called Kôr, without any doubt had thrown a glamour\r\nover my senses and at the moment almost caused me to believe much that\r\nis quite unbelievable.\r\n\r\nFor instance, she had told me ridiculous stories as to interviews\r\nbetween herself and certain heathen goddesses, though it is true that,\r\nalmost with her next breath, these she qualified or contradicted. Also,\r\nshe had suggested that her life had been prolonged far beyond our\r\nmortal span, for hundreds and hundreds of years, indeed; which, as\r\nEuclid says, is absurd, and had pretended to supernatural powers, which\r\nis still more absurd. Moreover, by a clever use of some hypnotic or\r\nmesmeric power, she had feigned to transport me to some place beyond\r\nthe earth and in the Halls of Hades to show me what is veiled from the\r\neyes of man, and not only me, but the savage warrior Umhlopekazi,\r\ncommonly called Umslopogaas of the Axe, who, with Hans, a Hottentot,\r\nwas my companion upon that adventure. There were like things equally\r\nincredible, such as her appearance, when all seemed lost, in the battle\r\nwith the troll-like Rezu. To omit these, the sum of it was that I had\r\nbeen shamefully duped, and if anyone finds himself in that position, as\r\nmost people have at one time or another in their lives, Wisdom suggests\r\nthat he had better keep the circumstances to himself.\r\n\r\nWell, so the matter stood, or rather lay in the recesses of my mind—and\r\nin the cupboard where I hide my papers—when one evening someone, as a\r\nmatter of fact it was Captain Good, an individual of romantic\r\ntendencies who is fond, sometimes I think too fond, of fiction, brought\r\na book to this house which he insisted over and over again really I\r\nmust peruse.\r\n\r\nAscertaining that it was a novel I declined, for to tell the truth I am\r\nnot fond of romance in any shape, being a person who has found the hard\r\nfacts of life of sufficient interest as they stand.\r\n\r\nReading I admit I like, but in this matter, as in everything else, my\r\nrange is limited. I study the Bible, especially the Old Testament, both\r\nbecause of its sacred lessons and of the majesty of the language of its\r\ninspired translators; whereof that of Ayesha, which I render so poorly\r\nfrom her flowing and melodious Arabic, reminded me. For poetry I turn\r\nto Shakespeare, and, at the other end of the scale, to the Ingoldsby\r\nLegends, many of which I know almost by heart, while for current\r\naffairs I content myself with the newspapers.\r\n\r\nFor the rest I peruse anything to do with ancient Egypt that I happen\r\nto come across, because this land and its history have a queer\r\nfascination for me, that perhaps has its roots in occurrences or dreams\r\nof which this is not the place to speak. Lastly now and again I read\r\none of the Latin or Greek authors in a translation, since I regret to\r\nsay that my lack of education does not enable me to do so in the\r\noriginal. But for modern fiction I have no taste, although from time to\r\ntime I sample it in a railway train and occasionally am amused by such\r\nexcursions into the poetic and unreal.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that the more Good bothered me to read this particular\r\nromance, the more I determined that I would do nothing of the sort.\r\nBeing a persistent person, however, when he went away about ten o’clock\r\nat night, he deposited it by my side, under my nose indeed, so that it\r\nmight not be overlooked. Thus it came about that I could not help\r\nseeing some Egyptian hieroglyphics in an oval on the cover, also the\r\ntitle, and underneath it your own name, my friend, all of which excited\r\nmy curiosity, especially the title, which was brief and enigmatic,\r\nconsisting indeed of one word, “_She_.”\r\n\r\nI took up the work and on opening it the first thing my eye fell upon\r\nwas a picture of a veiled woman, the sight of which made my heart stand\r\nstill, so painfully did it remind me of a certain veiled woman whom\r\nonce it had been my fortune to meet. Glancing from it to the printed\r\npage one word seemed to leap at me. It was _Kôr_! Now of veiled women\r\nthere are plenty in the world, but were there also two Kôrs?\r\n\r\nThen I turned to the beginning and began to read. This happened in the\r\nautumn when the sun does not rise till about six, but it was broad\r\ndaylight before I ceased from reading, or rather rushing through that\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nOh! what was I to make of it? For here in its pages (to say nothing of\r\nold Billali, who, by the way lied, probably to order, when he told Mr.\r\nHolly that no white man had visited his country for many generations,\r\nand those gloomy, man-eating Amahagger scoundrels) once again I found\r\nmyself face to face with _She-who-commands_, now rendered as\r\n_She-who-must-be-obeyed_, which means much the same thing—in her case\r\nat least; yes, with Ayesha the lovely, the mystic, the changeful and\r\nthe imperious.\r\n\r\nMoreover the history filled up many gaps in my own limited experiences\r\nof that enigmatical being who was half divine (though, I think, rather\r\nwicked or at any rate unmoral in her way) and yet all woman. It is true\r\nthat it showed her in lights very different from and higher than those\r\nin which she had presented herself to me. Yet the substratum of her\r\ncharacter was the same, or rather of her characters, for of these she\r\nseemed to have several in a single body, being, as she said of herself\r\nto me, “not One but Many and not Here but Everywhere.”\r\n\r\nFurther, I found the story of Kallikrates, which I had set down as a\r\nmere falsehood invented for my bewilderment, expanded and explained. Or\r\nrather not explained, since, perhaps that she might deceive, to me she\r\nhad spoken of this murdered Kallikrates without enthusiasm, as a\r\nhandsome person to whom, because of an indiscretion of her youth, she\r\nwas bound by destiny and whose return—somewhat to her sorrow—she must\r\nwait. At least she did so at first, though in the end when she bared\r\nher heart at the moment of our farewell, she vowed she loved him only\r\nand was “appointed” to him “by a divine decree.”\r\n\r\nAlso I found other things of which I knew nothing, such as the Fire of\r\nLife with its fatal gift of indefinite existence, although I remember\r\nthat like the giant Rezu whom Umslopogaas defeated, she did talk of a\r\n“Cup of Life” of which she had drunk, that might have been offered to\r\nmy lips, had I been politic, bowed the knee and shown more faith in her\r\nand her supernatural pretensions.\r\n\r\nLastly I saw the story of her end, and as I read it I wept, yes, I\r\nconfess I wept, although I feel sure that she will return again. Now I\r\nunderstood why she had quailed and even seemed to shrivel when, in my\r\nlast interview with her, stung beyond endurance by her witcheries and\r\nsarcasms, I had suggested that even for her with all her powers, Fate\r\nmight reserve one of its shrewdest blows. Some prescience had told her\r\nthat if the words seemed random, Truth spoke through my lips, although,\r\nand this was the worst of it, she did not know what weapon would deal\r\nthe stroke or when and where it was doomed to fall.\r\n\r\nI was amazed, I was overcome, but as I closed that book I made up my\r\nmind, first that I would continue to preserve absolute silence as to\r\nAyesha and my dealings with her, as, during my life, I was bound by\r\noath to do, and secondly that I would _not_ cause my manuscript to be\r\ndestroyed. I did not feel that I had any right to do so in view of what\r\nalready had been published to the world. There let it lie to appear one\r\nday, or not to appear, as might be fated. Meanwhile my lips were\r\nsealed. I would give Good back his book without comment and—buy another\r\ncopy!\r\n\r\nOne more word. It is clear that I did not touch more than the fringe of\r\nthe real Ayesha. In a thousand ways she bewitched and deceived me so\r\nthat I never plumbed her nature’s depths. Perhaps this was my own fault\r\nbecause from the first I shewed a lack of faith in her and she wished\r\nto pay me back in her own fashion, or perhaps she had other private\r\nreasons for her secrecy. Certainly the character she discovered to me\r\ndiffered in many ways from that which she revealed to Mr. Holly and to\r\nLeo Vincey, or Kallikrates, whom, it seems, once she slew in her\r\njealousy and rage.\r\n\r\nShe told me as much as she thought it fit that I should know, and no\r\nmore!\r\n\r\nAllan Quatermain.\r\n\r\nThe Grange, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHE AND ALLAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nTHE TALISMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe it was the old Egyptians, a very wise people, probably indeed\r\nmuch wiser than we know, for in the leisure of their ample centuries\r\nthey had time to think out things, who declared that each individual\r\npersonality is made up of six or seven different elements, although the\r\nBible only allows us three, namely, body, soul, and spirit. The body\r\nthat the man or woman wore, if I understand their theory aright which\r\nperhaps I, an ignorant person, do not, was but a kind of sack or\r\nfleshly covering containing these different principles. Or mayhap it\r\ndid not contain them all, but was simply a house as it were, in which\r\nthey lived from time to time and seldom all together, although one or\r\nmore of them was present continually, as though to keep the place\r\nwarmed and aired.\r\n\r\nThis is but a casual illustrative suggestion, for what right have I,\r\nAllan Quatermain, out of my little reading and probably erroneous\r\ndeductions, to form any judgment as to the theories of the old\r\nEgyptians? Still these, as I understand them, suffice to furnish me\r\nwith the text that man is not one, but many, in which connection it may\r\nbe remembered that often in Scripture he is spoken of as being the home\r\nof many demons, seven, I think. Also, to come to another far-off\r\nexample, the Zulus talk of their witch-doctors as being inhabited by “a\r\nmultitude of spirits.”\r\n\r\nAnyhow of one thing I am quite sure, we are not always the same.\r\nDifferent personalities actuate us at different times. In one hour\r\npassion of this sort or the other is our lord; in another we are reason\r\nitself. In one hour we follow the basest appetites; in another we hate\r\nthem and the spirit arising through our mortal murk shines within or\r\nabove us like a star. In one hour our desire is to kill and spare not;\r\nin another we are filled with the holiest compassion even towards an\r\ninsect or a snake, and are ready to forgive like a god. Everything\r\nrules us in turn, to such an extent indeed, that sometimes one begins\r\nto wonder whether we really rule anything.\r\n\r\nNow the reason of all this homily is that I, Allan, the most practical\r\nand unimaginative of persons, just a homely, half-educated hunter and\r\ntrader who chances to have seen a good deal of the particular little\r\nworld in which his lot was cast, at one period of my life became the\r\nvictim of spiritual longings.\r\n\r\nI am a man who has suffered great bereavements in my time such as have\r\nseared my soul, since, perhaps because of my rather primitive and\r\nsimple nature, my affections are very strong. By day or night I can\r\nnever forget those whom I have loved and whom I believe to have loved\r\nme.\r\n\r\nFor you know, in our vanity some of us are apt to hold that certain\r\npeople with whom we have been intimate upon the earth, really did care\r\nfor us and, in our still greater vanity—or should it be called\r\nmadness?—to imagine that they still care for us after they have left\r\nthe earth and entered on some new state of society and surroundings\r\nwhich, if they exist, inferentially are much more congenial than any\r\nthey can have experienced here. At times, however, cold doubts strike\r\nus as to this matter, of which we long to know the truth. Also behind\r\nlooms a still blacker doubt, namely whether they live at all.\r\n\r\nFor some years of my lonely existence these problems haunted me day by\r\nday, till at length I desired above everything on earth to lay them at\r\nrest in one way or another. Once, at Durban, I met a man who was a\r\nspiritualist to whom I confided a little of my perplexities. He laughed\r\nat me and said that they could be settled with the greatest ease. All I\r\nhad to do was to visit a certain local medium who for a fee of one\r\nguinea would tell me everything I wanted to know. Although I rather\r\ngrudged the guinea, being more than usually hard up at the time, I\r\ncalled upon this person, but over the results of that visit, or rather\r\nthe lack of them, I draw a veil.\r\n\r\nMy queer and perhaps unwholesome longing, however, remained with me and\r\nwould not be abated. I consulted a clergyman of my acquaintance, a good\r\nand spiritually-minded man, but he could only shrug his shoulders and\r\nrefer me to the Bible, saying, quite rightly I doubt not, that with\r\nwhat it reveals I ought to be contented. Then I read certain mystical\r\nbooks which were recommended to me. These were full of fine words,\r\nundiscoverable in a pocket dictionary, but really took me no forwarder,\r\nsince in them I found nothing that I could not have invented myself,\r\nalthough while I was actually studying them, they seemed to convince\r\nme. I even tackled Swedenborg, or rather samples of him, for he is very\r\ncopious, but without satisfactory results. [Ha!—JB]\r\n\r\nThen I gave up the business.\r\n\r\nSome months later I was in Zululand and being near the Black Kloof\r\nwhere he dwelt, I paid a visit to my acquaintance of whom I have\r\nwritten elsewhere, the wonderful and ancient dwarf, Zikali, known as\r\n“The-Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born,” also more universally\r\namong the Zulus as “Opener-of-Roads.” When we had talked of many things\r\nconnected with the state of Zululand and its politics, I rose to leave\r\nfor my waggon, since I never cared for sleeping in the Black Kloof if\r\nit could be avoided.\r\n\r\n“Is there nothing else that you want to ask me, Macumazahn?” asked the\r\nold dwarf, tossing back his long hair and looking at—I had almost\r\nwritten through—me.\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n“That is strange, Macumazahn, for I seem to see something written on\r\nyour mind—something to do with spirits.”\r\n\r\nThen I remembered all the problems that had been troubling me, although\r\nin truth I had never thought of propounding them to Zikali.\r\n\r\n“Ah! it comes back, does it?” he exclaimed, reading my thought. “Out\r\nwith it, then, Macumazahn, while I am in a mood to answer, and before I\r\ngrow tired, for you are an old friend of mine and will so remain till\r\nthe end, many years hence, and if I can serve you, I will.”\r\n\r\nI filled my pipe and sat down again upon the stool of carved red-wood\r\nwhich had been brought for me.\r\n\r\n“You are named ‘Opener-of-Roads,’ are you not, Zikali?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the Zulus have always called me that, since before the days of\r\nChaka. But what of names, which often enough mean nothing at all?”\r\n\r\n“Only that _I_ want to open a road, Zikali, that which runs across the\r\nRiver of Death.”\r\n\r\n“Oho!” he laughed, “it is very easy,” and snatching up a little assegai\r\nthat lay beside him, he proffered it to me, adding, “Be brave now and\r\nfall on that. Then before I have counted sixty the road will be wide\r\nopen, but whether you will see anything on it I cannot tell you.”\r\n\r\nAgain I shook my head and answered,\r\n\r\n“It is against our law. Also while I still live I desire to know\r\nwhether I shall meet certain others on that road after my time has come\r\nto cross the River. Perhaps you who deal with spirits, can prove the\r\nmatter to me, which no one else seems able to do.”\r\n\r\n“Oho!” laughed Zikali again. “What do my ears hear? Am I, the poor Zulu\r\ncheat, as you will remember once you called me, Macumazahn, asked to\r\nshow that which is hidden from all the wisdom of the great White\r\nPeople?”\r\n\r\n“The question is,” I answered with irritation, “not what you are asked\r\nto do, but what you can do.”\r\n\r\n“That I do not know yet, Macumazahn. Whose spirits do you desire to\r\nsee? If that of a woman called Mameena is one of them, I think that\r\nperhaps I whom she loved——“[1]\r\n\r\n [1] For the history of Mameena see the book called “Child of\r\n Storm.”—Editor.\r\n\r\n“She is _not_ one of them, Zikali. Moreover, if she loved you, you paid\r\nback her love with death.”\r\n\r\n“Which perhaps was the kindest thing I could do, Macumazahn, for\r\nreasons that you may be able to guess, and others with which I will not\r\ntrouble you. But if not hers, whose? Let me look, let me look! Why,\r\nthere seems to be two of them, head-wives, I mean, and I thought that\r\nwhite men only took one wife. Also a multitude of others; their faces\r\nfloat up in the water of your mind. An old man with grey hair, little\r\nchildren, perhaps they were brothers and sisters, and some who may be\r\nfriends. Also very clear indeed that Mameena whom you do not wish to\r\nsee. Well, Macumazahn, this is unfortunate, since she is the only one\r\nwhom I can show you, or rather put you in the way of finding. Unless\r\nindeed there are other Kaffir women——”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I mean, Macumazahn, that only black feet travel on the road which I\r\ncan open; over those in which ran white blood I have no power.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is finished,” I said, rising again and taking a step or two\r\ntowards the gate.\r\n\r\n“Come back and sit down, Macumazahn. I did not say so. Am I the only\r\nruler of magic in Africa, which I am told is a big country?”\r\n\r\nI came back and sat down, for my curiosity, a great failing with me,\r\nwas excited.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Zikali,” I said, “but I will have no dealings with more of\r\nyour witch-doctors.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, because you are afraid of them; quite without reason,\r\nMacumazahn, seeing that they are all cheats except myself. I am the\r\nlast child of wisdom, the rest are stuffed with lies, as Chaka found\r\nout when he killed every one of them whom he could catch. But perhaps\r\nthere might be a white doctor who would have rule over white spirits.”\r\n\r\n“If you mean missionaries——” I began hastily.\r\n\r\n“No, Macumazahn, I do not mean your praying men who are cast in one\r\nmould and measured with one rule, and say what they are taught to say,\r\nnot thinking for themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Some of them think, Zikali.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and then the others fall on them with big sticks. The real priest\r\nis he to whom the Spirit comes, not he who feeds upon its wrappings,\r\nand speaks through a mask carved by his father’s fathers. I am a priest\r\nlike that, which is why all my fellowship have hated me.”\r\n\r\n“If so, you have paid back their hate, Zikali, but cease to cast round\r\nthe lion, like a timid hound, and tell me what you mean. Of whom do you\r\nspeak?”\r\n\r\n“That is the trouble, Macumazahn. I do not know. This lion, or rather\r\nlioness, lies hid in the caves of a very distant mountain and I have\r\nnever seen her—in the flesh.”\r\n\r\n“Then how can you talk of what you have never seen?”\r\n\r\n“In the same way, Macumazahn, that your priests talk of what they have\r\nnever seen, because they, or a few of them, have knowledge of it. I\r\nwill tell you a secret. All seers who live at the same time, if they\r\nare great, commune with each other because they are akin and their\r\nspirits meet in sleep or dreams. Therefore I know of a mistress of our\r\ncraft, a very lioness among jackals, who for thousands of years has\r\nlain sleeping in the northern caves and, humble though I am, she knows\r\nof me.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” I said, yawning, “but perhaps, Zikali, you will come to the\r\npoint of the spear. What of her? How is she named, and if she exists\r\nwill she help me?”\r\n\r\n“I will answer your question backwards, Macumazahn. I think that she\r\nwill help you if you help her, in what way I do not know, because\r\nalthough witch-doctors sometimes work without pay, as I am doing now,\r\nMacumazahn, witch-doctoresses never do. As for her name, the only one\r\nthat she has among our company is ‘Queen,’ because she is the first of\r\nall of them and the most beauteous among women. For the rest I can tell\r\nyou nothing, except that she has always been and I suppose, in this\r\nshape or in that, will always be while the world lasts, because she has\r\nfound the secret of life unending.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that she is immortal, Zikali,” I answered with a smile.\r\n\r\n“I do not say that, Macumazahn, because my little mind cannot shape the\r\nthought of immortality. But when I was a babe, which is far ago, she\r\nhad lived so long that scarce would she know the difference between\r\nthen and now, and already in her breast was all wisdom gathered. I know\r\nit, because although, as I have said, we have never seen each other, at\r\ntimes we walk together in our sleep, for thus she shares her\r\nloneliness, and I think, though this may be but a dream, that last\r\nnight she told me to send you on to her to seek an answer to certain\r\nquestions which you would put to me to-day. Also to me she seemed to\r\ndesire that you should do her a service; I know not what service.”\r\n\r\nNow I grew angry and asked,\r\n\r\n“Why does it please you to fool me, Zikali, with such talk as this? If\r\nthere is any truth in it, show me where the woman called _Queen_ lives\r\nand how I am to come to her.”\r\n\r\nThe old wizard took up the little assegai which he had offered to me\r\nand with its blade raked out ashes from the fire that always burnt in\r\nfront of him. While he did so, he talked to me, as I thought in a\r\nrandom fashion, perhaps to distract my attention, of a certain white\r\nman whom he said I should meet upon my journey and of his affairs, also\r\nof other matters, none of which interested me much at the time. These\r\nashes he patted down flat and then on them drew a map with the point of\r\nhis spear, making grooves for streams, certain marks for bush and\r\nforest, wavy lines for water and swamps and little heaps for hills.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished it all he bade me come round the fire and study\r\nthe picture across which by an after-thought he drew a wandering furrow\r\nwith the edge of the assegai to represent a river, and gathered the\r\nashes in a lump at the northern end to signify a large mountain.\r\n\r\n“Look at it well, Macumazahn,” he said, “and forget nothing, since if\r\nyou make this journey and forget, you die. Nay, no need to copy it in\r\nthat book of yours, for see, I will stamp it on your mind.”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he gathered up the warm ashes in a double handful and\r\nthrew them into my face, muttering something as he did so and adding\r\naloud,\r\n\r\n“There, now you will remember.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I shall,” I answered, coughing, “and I beg that you will not\r\nplay such a joke upon me again.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, whatever may have been the reason, I never forgot\r\nany detail of that extremely intricate map.\r\n\r\n“That big river must be the Zambesi,” I stuttered, “and even then the\r\nmountain of your Queen, if it be her mountain, is far away, and how can\r\nI come there alone?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Macumazahn, though perhaps you might do so in company.\r\nAt least I believe that in the old days people used to travel to the\r\nplace, since I have heard a great city stood there once which was the\r\nheart of a mighty empire.”\r\n\r\nNow I pricked up my ears, for though I believed nothing of Zikali’s\r\nstory of a wonderful Queen, I was always intensely interested in past\r\ncivilisations and their relics. Also I knew that the old wizard’s\r\nknowledge was extensive and peculiar, however he came by it, and I did\r\nnot think that he would lie to me in this matter. Indeed to tell the\r\ntruth, then and there I made up my mind that if it were in any way\r\npossible, I would attempt this journey.\r\n\r\n“How did people travel to the city, Zikali?”\r\n\r\n“By sea, I suppose, Macumazahn, but I think that you will be wise not\r\nto try that road, since I believe that on the sea side the marshes are\r\nnow impassable and you will be safer on your feet.”\r\n\r\n“You want me to go on this adventure, Zikali. Why? I know you never do\r\nanything without motive.”\r\n\r\n“Oho! Macumazahn, you are clever and see deeper into the trunk of a\r\ntree than most. Yes, I want you to go for three reasons. First, that\r\nyou may satisfy your soul on certain matters and I would help you to do\r\nso. Secondly, because I want to satisfy mine, and thirdly, because I\r\nknow that you will come back safe to be a prop to me in things that\r\nwill happen in days unborn. Otherwise I would have told you nothing of\r\nthis story, since it is necessary to me that you should remain living\r\nbeneath the sun.”\r\n\r\n“Have done, Zikali. What is it that you desire?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! a great deal that I shall get, but chiefly two things, so with the\r\nrest I will not trouble you. First I desire to know whether these\r\ndreams of mine of a wonderful white witch-doctoress, or witch, and of\r\nmy converse with her are indeed more than dreams. Next I would learn\r\nwhether certain plots of mine at which I have worked for years, will\r\nsucceed.”\r\n\r\n“What plots, Zikali, and how can my taking a distant journey tell you\r\nanything about them?”\r\n\r\n“You know them well enough, Macumazahn; they have to do with the\r\noverthrow of a Royal House that has worked me bitter wrong. As to how\r\nyour journey can help me, why, thus. You shall promise to me to ask of\r\nthis Queen whether Zikali, Opener-of-Roads, shall triumph or be\r\noverthrown in that on which he has set his heart.”\r\n\r\n“As you seem to know this witch so well, why do you not ask her\r\nyourself, Zikali?”\r\n\r\n“To ask is one thing, Macumazahn. To get an answer is another. I have\r\nasked in the watches of the night, and the reply was, ‘Come hither and\r\nperchance I will tell you.’ ‘Queen,’ I said, ‘how can I come save in\r\nthe spirit, who am an ancient and a crippled dwarf scarcely able to\r\nstand upon my feet?’\r\n\r\n“‘Then send a messenger, Wizard, and be sure that he is white, for of\r\nblack savages I have seen more than enough. Let him bear a token also\r\nthat he comes from you and tell me of it in your sleep. Moreover let\r\nthat token be something of power which will protect him on the\r\njourney.’\r\n\r\n“Such is the answer that comes to me in my dreams, Macumazahn.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what token will you give me, Zikali?”\r\n\r\nHe groped about in his robe and produced a piece of ivory of the size\r\nof a large chessman, that had a hole in it, through which ran a plaited\r\ncord of the stiff hairs from an elephant’s tail. On this article, which\r\nwas of a rusty brown colour, he breathed, then having whispered to it\r\nfor a while, handed it to me.\r\n\r\nI took the talisman, for such I guessed it to be, idly enough, held it\r\nto the light to examine it, and started back so violently that almost I\r\nlet it fall. I do not quite know why I started, but I think it was\r\nbecause some influence seemed to leap from it to me. Zikali started\r\nalso and cried out,\r\n\r\n“Have a care, Macumazahn. Am I young that I can bear being dashed to\r\nthe ground?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked, still staring at the thing which I\r\nperceived to be a most wonderfully fashioned likeness of the old dwarf\r\nhimself as he appeared before me crouched upon the ground. There were\r\nthe deepset eyes, the great head, the toad-like shape, the long hair,\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“It is a clever carving, is it not, Macumazahn? I am skilled in that\r\nart, you know, and therefore can judge of carving.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” I answered, bethinking me of another statuette of his\r\nwhich he had given to me on the morrow of the death of her from whom it\r\nwas modelled. “But what of the thing?”\r\n\r\n“Macumazahn, it has come down to me through the ages. As you may have\r\nheard, all great doctors when they die pass on their wisdom and\r\nsomething of their knowledge to another doctor of spirits who is still\r\nliving on the earth, that nothing may be lost, or as little as\r\npossible. Also I have learned that to such likenesses as these may be\r\ngiven the strength of him or her from whom they were shaped.”\r\n\r\nNow I bethought me of the old Egyptians and their _Ka_ statues of which\r\nI had read, and that these statues, magically charmed and set in the\r\ntombs of the departed, were supposed to be inhabited everlastingly by\r\nthe Doubles of the dead endued with more power even than ever these\r\npossessed in life. But of this I said nothing to Zikali, thinking that\r\nit would take too much explanation, though I wondered very much how he\r\nhad come by the same idea.\r\n\r\n“When that ivory is hung over your heart, Macumazahn, where you must\r\nalways wear it, learn that with it goes the strength of Zikali; the\r\nthought that would have been his thought and the wisdom that is his\r\nwisdom, will be your companions, as much as though he walked at your\r\nside and could instruct you in every peril. Moreover north and south\r\nand east and west this image is known to men who, when they see it,\r\nwill bow down and obey, opening a road to him who wears the medicine of\r\nthe Opener-of-Roads.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” I said, smiling, “and what is this colour on the ivory?”\r\n\r\n“I forget, Macumazahn, who have had it a great number of years, ever\r\nsince it descended to me from a forefather of mine, who was fashioned\r\nin the same mould as I am. It looks like blood, does it not? It is a\r\npity that Mameena is not still alive, since she whose memory was so\r\nexcellent might have been able to tell you,” and as he spoke, with a\r\nmotion that was at once sure and swift, he threw the loop of elephant\r\nhair over my head.\r\n\r\nHastily I changed the subject, feeling that after his wont this old\r\nwizard, the most terrible man whom ever I knew, who had been so much\r\nconcerned with the tragic death of Mameena, was stabbing at me in some\r\nhidden fashion.\r\n\r\n“You tell me to go on this journey,” I said, “and not alone. Yet for\r\ncompanion you give me only an ugly piece of ivory shaped as no man ever\r\nwas,” here I got one back at Zikali, “and from the look of it, steeped\r\nin blood, which ivory, if I had my way, I would throw into the camp\r\nfire. Who, then, am I to take with me?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t do that, Macumazahn—I mean throw the ivory into the fire—since I\r\nhave no wish to burn before my time, and if you do, you who have worn\r\nit might burn with me. At least certainly you would die with the magic\r\nthing and go to acquire knowledge more quickly than you desire. No, no,\r\nand do not try to take it off your neck, or rather try if you will.”\r\n\r\nI did try, but something seemed to prevent me from accomplishing my\r\npurpose of giving the carving back to Zikali as I wished to do. First\r\nmy pipe got in the way of my hand, then the elephant hairs caught in\r\nthe collar of my coat; then a pang of rheumatism to which I was\r\naccustomed from an old lion-bite, developed of a sudden in my arm, and\r\nlastly I grew tired of bothering about the thing.\r\n\r\nZikali, who had been watching my movements, burst out into one of his\r\nterrible laughs that seemed to fill the whole kloof and to re-echo from\r\nits rocky walls. It died away and he went on, without further reference\r\nto the talisman or image.\r\n\r\n“You asked whom you were to take with you, Macumazahn. Well, as to this\r\nI must make inquiry of those who know. Man, my medicines!”\r\n\r\nFrom the shadows in the hut behind darted out a tall figure carrying a\r\ngreat spear in one hand and in the other a catskin bag which with a\r\nsalute he laid down at the feet of his master. This salute, by the way,\r\nwas that of a Zulu word which means “Lord” or “Home” of Ghosts.\r\n\r\nZikali groped in the bag and produced from it certain knuckle-bones.\r\n\r\n“A common method,” he muttered, “such as every vulgar wizard uses, but\r\none that is quick and, as the matter concerned is small, will serve my\r\nturn. Let us see now, whom you shall take with you, Macumazahn.”\r\n\r\nThen he breathed upon the bones, shook them up in his thin hands and\r\nwith a quick turn of the wrist, threw them into the air. After this he\r\nstudied them carefully, where they lay among the ashes which he had\r\nraked out of the fire, those that he had used for the making of his\r\nmap.\r\n\r\n“Do you know a man named Umslopogaas, Macumazahn, the chief of a tribe\r\nthat is called The People of the Axe, whose titles of praise are\r\nBulalio or the Slaughterer, and Woodpecker, the latter from the way he\r\nhandles his ancient axe? He is a savage fellow, but one of high blood\r\nand higher courage, a great captain in his way, though he will never\r\ncome to anything, save a glorious death—in your company, I think,\r\nMacumazahn.” (Here he studied the bones again for a while.) “Yes, I am\r\nsure, in your company, though not upon this journey.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard of him,” I answered cautiously. “It is said in the land\r\nthat he is a son of Chaka, the great king of the Zulus.”\r\n\r\n“Is it, Macumazahn? And is it said also that he was the slayer of\r\nChaka’s brother, Dingaan, also the lover of the fairest woman that the\r\nZulus have ever seen, who was called Nada the Lily? Unless indeed a\r\ncertain Mameena, who, I seem to remember, was a friend of yours, may\r\nhave been even more beautiful?”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing of Nada the Lily,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“No, no, Mameena, ‘the Waiting Wind,’ has blown over her fame, so why\r\nshould you know of one who has been dead a long while? Why also,\r\nMacumazahn, do you always bring women into every business? I begin to\r\nbelieve that although you are so strict in a white man’s fashion, you\r\nmust be too fond of them, a weakness which makes for ruin to any man.\r\nWell, now, I think that this wolf-man, this axe-man, this warrior,\r\nUmslopogaas should be a good fellow to you on your journey to visit the\r\nwhite witch, Queen—another woman by the way, Macumazahn, and therefore\r\none of whom you should be careful. Oh! yes, he will come with\r\nyou—because of a man called Lousta and a woman named Monazi, a wife of\r\nhis who hates him and does—not hate Lousta. I am almost sure that he\r\nwill come with you, so do not stop to ask questions about him.”\r\n\r\n“Is there anyone else?” I inquired.\r\n\r\nZikali glanced at the bones again, poking them about in the ashes with\r\nhis toe, then replied with a yawn,\r\n\r\n“You seem to have a little yellow man in your service, a clever snake\r\nwho knows how to creep through grass, and when to strike and when to\r\nlie hidden. I should take him too, if I were you.”\r\n\r\n“You know well that I have such a man, Zikali, a Hottentot named Hans,\r\nclever in his way but drunken, very faithful too, since he loved my\r\nfather before me. He is cooking my supper in the waggon now. Are there\r\nto be any others?”\r\n\r\n“No, I think you three will be enough, with a guard of soldiers from\r\nthe People of the Axe, for you will meet with fighting and a ghost or\r\ntwo. Umslopogaas has always one at his elbow named Nada, and perhaps\r\nyou have several. For instance, there was a certain Mameena whom I\r\nalways seem to feel about me when you are near, Macumazahn.\r\n\r\n“Why, the wind is rising again, which is odd on so still an evening.\r\nListen to how it wails, yes, and stirs your hair, though mine hangs\r\nstraight enough. But why do I talk of ghosts, seeing that you travel to\r\nseek other ghosts, white ghosts, beyond my ken, who can only deal with\r\nthose who were black?\r\n\r\n“Good-night, Macumazahn, good-night. When you return from visiting the\r\nwhite Queen, that Great One beneath whose feet I, Zikali, who am also\r\ngreat in my way, am but a grain of dust, come and tell me her answer to\r\nmy question.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, be careful always to wear that pretty little image which I\r\nhave given you, as a young lover sometimes wears a lock of hair cut\r\nfrom the head of some fool-girl that he thinks is fond of him. It will\r\nbring you safety and luck, Macumazahn, which, for the most part, is\r\nmore than the lock of hair does to the lover. Oh! it is a strange\r\nworld, full of jest to those who can see the strings that work it. I am\r\none of them, and perhaps, Macumazahn, you are another, or will be\r\nbefore all is done—or begun.\r\n\r\n“Good-night, and good fortune to you on your journeyings, and,\r\nMacumazahn, although you are so fond of women, be careful not to fall\r\nin love with that white Queen, because it would make others jealous; I\r\nmean some whom you have lost sight of for a while, also I think that\r\nbeing under a curse of her own, she is not one whom you can put into\r\nyour sack. _Oho! Oho-ho!_ Slave, bring me my blanket, it grows cold,\r\nand my medicine also, that which protects me from the ghosts, who are\r\nthick to-night. Macumazahn brings them, I think. _Oho-ho!_”\r\n\r\nI turned to depart but when I had gone a little way Zikali called me\r\nback again and said, speaking very low,\r\n\r\n“When you meet this Umslopogaas, as you will meet him, he who is called\r\nthe Woodpecker and the Slaughterer, say these words to him,\r\n\r\n“‘A bat has been twittering round the hut of the Opener-of-Roads, and\r\nto his ears it squeaked the name of a certain Lousta and the name of a\r\nwoman called Monazi. Also it twittered another greater name that may\r\nnot be uttered, that of an elephant who shakes the earth, and said that\r\nthis elephant sniffs the air with his trunk and grows angry, and\r\nsharpens his tusks to dig a certain Woodpecker out of his hole in a\r\ntree that grows near the Witch Mountain. Say, too, that the\r\nOpener-of-Roads thinks that this Woodpecker would be wise to fly north\r\nfor a while in the company of one who watches by night, lest harm\r\nshould come to a bird that pecks at the feet of the great and chatters\r\nof it in his nest.’”\r\n\r\nThen Zikali waved his hand and I went, wondering into what plot I had\r\nstumbled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE MESSENGERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not rest as I should that night who somehow was never able to\r\nsleep well in the neighbourhood of the Black Kloof. I suppose that\r\nZikali’s constant talk about ghosts, with his hints and innuendoes\r\nconcerning those who were dead, always affected my nerves till, in a\r\nsubconscious way, I began to believe that such things existed and were\r\nhanging about me. Many people are open to the power of suggestion, and\r\nI am afraid that I am one of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sun which has such strength to kill noxious things, puts\r\nan end to ghosts more quickly even than it does to other evil vapours\r\nand emanations, and when I woke up to find it shining brilliantly in a\r\npure heaven, I laughed with much heartiness over the whole affair.\r\n\r\nGoing to the spring near which we were outspanned, I took off my shirt\r\nto have a good wash, still chuckling at the memory of all the\r\nhocus-pocus of my old friend, the Opener-of-Roads.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this matutinal operation I struck my hand against\r\nsomething and looking, observed that it was the hideous little ivory\r\nimage of Zikali, which he had set about my neck. The sight of the thing\r\nand the memory of his ridiculous talk about it, especially of its\r\nassertion that it had come down to him through the ages, which it could\r\nnot have done, seeing that it was a likeness of himself, irritated me\r\nso much that I proceeded to take it off with the full intention of\r\nthrowing it into the spring.\r\n\r\nAs I was in the act of doing this, from a clump of reeds mixed with\r\nbushes, quite close to me, there came a sound of hissing, and suddenly\r\nabove them appeared the head of a great black _immamba_, perhaps the\r\ndeadliest of all our African snakes, and the only one I know which will\r\nattack man without provocation.\r\n\r\nLeaving go of the image, I sprang back in a great hurry towards where\r\nmy gun lay. Then the snake vanished and making sure that it had\r\ndeparted to its hole, which was probably at a distance, I returned to\r\nthe pool, and once more began to take off the talisman in order to\r\nconsign it to the bottom of the pool.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I reflected, it was a hideous and probably a blood-stained\r\nthing which I did not in the least wish to wear about my neck like a\r\nlady’s love-token.\r\n\r\nJust as it was coming over my head, suddenly from the other side of the\r\nbush that infernal snake popped up again, this time, it was clear,\r\nreally intent on business. It began to move towards me in the\r\nlightning-like way _immambas_ have, hissing and flicking its tongue.\r\n\r\nI was too quick for my friend, however, for snatching up the gun that I\r\nhad lain down beside me, I let it have a charge of buckshot in the neck\r\nwhich nearly cut it in two, so that it fell down and expired with\r\nhideous convulsive writhings.\r\n\r\nHearing the shot Hans came running from the waggon to see what was the\r\nmatter. Hans, I should say, was that same Hottentot who had been the\r\ncompanion of most of my journeyings since my father’s day. He was with\r\nme when as a young fellow I accompanied Retief to Dingaan’s kraal, and\r\nlike myself, escaped the massacre.[1] Also we shared many other\r\nadventures, including the great one in the Land of the Ivory Child\r\nwhere he slew the huge elephant-god, Jana, and himself was slain. But\r\nof this journey we did not dream in those days.\r\n\r\n [1] See the book called “Marie.”—Editor.\r\n\r\nFor the rest Hans was a most entirely unprincipled person, but as the\r\nBoers say, “as clever as a waggonload of monkeys.” Also he drank when\r\nhe got the chance. One good quality he had, however; no man was ever\r\nmore faithful, and perhaps it would be true to say that neither man nor\r\nwoman ever loved me, unworthy, quite so well.\r\n\r\nIn appearance he rather resembled an antique and dilapidated baboon;\r\nhis face was wrinkled like a dried nut and his quick little eyes were\r\nbloodshot. I never knew what his age was, any more than he did himself,\r\nbut the years had left him tough as whipcord and absolutely untiring.\r\nLastly he was perhaps the best hand at following a spoor that ever I\r\nknew and up to a hundred and fifty yards or so, a very deadly shot with\r\na rifle especially when he used a little single-barrelled,\r\nmuzzle-loading gun of mine made by Purdey which he named _Intombi_ or\r\nMaiden. Of that gun, however, I have written in “The Holy Flower” and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Baas?” he asked. “Here there are no lions, nor any game.”\r\n\r\n“Look the other side of the bush, Hans.”\r\n\r\nHe slipped round it, making a wide circle with his usual caution, then,\r\nseeing the snake which was, by the way, I think, the biggest _immamba_\r\nI ever killed, suddenly froze, as it were, in a stiff attitude that\r\nreminded me of a pointer when it scents game. Having made sure that it\r\nwas dead, he nodded and said,\r\n\r\n“Black _‘mamba_, or so you would call it, though I know it for\r\nsomething else.”\r\n\r\n“What else, Hans?”\r\n\r\n“One of the old witch-doctor Zikali’s spirits which he sets at the\r\nmouth of this kloof to warn him of who comes or goes. I know it well,\r\nand so do others. I saw it listening behind a stone when you were up\r\nthe kloof last evening talking with the Opener-of-Roads.”\r\n\r\n“Then Zikali will lack a spirit,” I answered, laughing, “which perhaps\r\nhe will not miss amongst so many. It serves him right for setting the\r\nbrute on me.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so, Baas. He will be angry. I wonder why he did it?” he added\r\nsuspiciously, “seeing that he is such a friend of yours.”\r\n\r\n“He didn’t do it, Hans. These snakes are very fierce and give battle,\r\nthat is all.”\r\n\r\nHans paid no attention to my remark, which probably he thought only\r\nworthy of a white man who does not understand, but rolled his yellow,\r\nbloodshot eyes about, as though in search of explanations. Presently\r\nthey fell upon the ivory that hung about my neck, and he started.\r\n\r\n“Why do you wear that pretty likeness of the Great One yonder over your\r\nheart, as I have known you do with things that belonged to women in\r\npast days, Baas? Do you know that it is Zikali’s Great Medicine,\r\nnothing less, as everyone does throughout the land? When Zikali sends\r\nan order far away, he always sends that image with it, for then he who\r\nreceives the order knows that he must obey or die. Also the messenger\r\nknows that he will come to no harm if he does not take it off, because,\r\nBaas, the image is Zikali himself, and Zikali is the image. They are\r\none and the same. Also it is the image of his father’s father’s\r\nfather—or so he says.”\r\n\r\n“That is an odd story,” I said.\r\n\r\nThen I told Hans as much as I thought advisable of how this horrid\r\nlittle talisman came into my possession.\r\n\r\nHans nodded without showing any surprise.\r\n\r\n“So we are going on a long journey,” he said. “Well, I thought it was\r\ntime that we did something more than wander about these tame countries\r\nselling blankets to stinking old women and so forth, Baas. Moreover,\r\nZikali does not wish that you should come to harm, doubtless because he\r\ndoes wish to make use of you afterwards—oh! it’s safe to talk now when\r\nthat spirit is away looking for another snake. What were you doing with\r\nthe Great Medicine, Baas, when the _‘mamba_ attacked you?”\r\n\r\n“Taking it off to throw it into the pool, Hans, as I do not like the\r\nthing. I tried twice and each time the _immamba_ appeared.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it appeared, Baas, and what is more, if you had taken that\r\nMedicine off and thrown it away _you_ would have disappeared, since the\r\n_‘mamba_ would have killed you. Zikali wanted to show you that, Baas,\r\nand that is why he set the snake at you.”\r\n\r\n“You are a superstitious old fool, Hans.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, but my father knew all about that Great Medicine before me,\r\nfor he was a bit of a doctor, and so does every wizard and witch for a\r\nthousand miles or more. I tell you, Baas, it is known by all though no\r\none ever talks about it, no, not even the king himself. Baas, speaking\r\nto you, not with the voice of Hans the old drunkard, but with that of\r\nthe Predikant, your reverend father, who made so good a Christian of me\r\nand who tells me to do so from up in Heaven where the hot fires are\r\nwhich the wood feeds of itself, I beg you not to try to throw away the\r\nMedicine again, or if you wish to do so, to leave me behind on this\r\njourney. For you see, Baas, although I am now so good, almost like one\r\nof those angels with the pretty goose’s wings in the pictures, I feel\r\nthat I should like to grow a little better before I go to the Place of\r\nFires to make report to your reverend father, the Predikant.”\r\n\r\nThinking of how horrified my dear father would be if he could hear all\r\nthis string of ridiculous nonsense and learn the result of his moral\r\nand religious lessons on raw Hottentot material, I burst out laughing.\r\nBut Hans went on as gravely as a judge,\r\n\r\n“Wear the Great Medicine, Baas, wear it; part with the liver inside you\r\nbefore you part with that, Baas. It may not be as pretty or smell as\r\nsweet as a woman’s hair in a little gold bottle, but it is much more\r\nuseful. The sight of the woman’s hair will only make you sick in your\r\nstomach and cause you to remember a lot of things which you had much\r\nbetter forget, but the Great Medicine, or rather Zikali who is in it,\r\nwill keep the assegais and sickness out of you and turn back bad magic\r\non to the heads of those who sent it, and always bring us plenty to eat\r\nand perhaps, if we are lucky, a little to drink too sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“Go away,” I said, “I want to wash.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, but with the Baas’s leave I will sit on the other side of\r\nthat bush with the gun—not to look at the Baas without his clothes,\r\nbecause white people are always so ugly that it makes me feel ill to\r\nsee them undressed, also because—the Baas will forgive me—but because\r\nthey smell. No, not for that, but just to see that no other snake\r\ncomes.”\r\n\r\n“Get out of the road, you dirty little scoundrel, and stop your\r\nimpudence,” I said, lifting my foot suggestively.\r\n\r\nThereon he scooted with a subdued grin round the other side of the\r\nbush, whence as I knew well he kept his eye fixed on me to be sure that\r\nI made no further attempt to take off the Great Medicine.\r\n\r\nNow of this talisman I may as well say at once that I am no believer in\r\nit or its precious influences. Therefore, although it was useful\r\nsometimes, notably twice when Umslopogaas was concerned, I do not know\r\nwhether personally I should have done better or worse upon that journey\r\nif I had thrown it into the pool.\r\n\r\nIt is true, however, that until quite the end of this history when it\r\nbecame needful to do so to save another, I never made any further\r\nattempt to remove it from my neck, not even when it rubbed a sore in my\r\nskin, because I did not wish to offend the prejudices of Hans.\r\n\r\nIt is true, moreover, that this hideous ivory had a reputation which\r\nstretched very far from the place where it was made and was regarded\r\nwith great reverence by all kinds of queer people, even by the\r\nAmahagger themselves, of whom presently, as they say in pedigrees, a\r\nfact of which I found sundry proofs. Indeed, I saw a first example of\r\nit when a little while later I met that great warrior, Umslopogaas,\r\nChief of the People of the Axe.\r\n\r\nFor, after determining firmly, for reasons which I will set out, that I\r\nwould not visit this man, in the end I did so, although by then I had\r\ngiven up any idea of journeying across the Zambesi to look for a\r\nmysterious and non-existent witch-woman, as Zikali had suggested that I\r\nshould do. To begin with I knew that his talk was all rubbish and, even\r\nif it were not, that at the bottom of it was some desire of the\r\nOpener-of-Roads that I should make a path for him to travel towards an\r\nindefinite but doubtless evil object of his own. Further, by this time\r\nI had worn through that mood of mine which had caused me to yearn for\r\ncorrespondence with the departed and a certain knowledge of their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether many people understand, as I do, how entirely distinct\r\nand how variable are these moods which sway us, or at any rate some of\r\nus, at sundry periods of our lives. As I think I have already\r\nsuggested, at one time we are all spiritual; at another all physical;\r\nat one time we are sure that our lives here are as a dream and a shadow\r\nand that the real existence lies elsewhere; at another that these brief\r\ndays of ours are the only business with which we have to do and that of\r\nit we must make the best. At one time we think our loves much more\r\nimmortal than the stars; at another that they are mere shadows cast by\r\nthe baleful sun of desire upon the shallow and fleeting water we call\r\nLife which seems to flow out of nowhere into nowhere. At one time we\r\nare full of faith, at another all such hopes are blotted out by a black\r\nwall of Nothingness, and so on _ad infinitum_. Only very stupid people,\r\nor humbugs, are or pretend to be, always consistent and unchanging.\r\n\r\nTo return, I determined not only that I would not travel north to seek\r\nthat which no living man will ever find, certainty as to the future,\r\nbut also, to show my independence of Zikali, that I would not visit\r\nthis chief, Umslopogaas. So, having traded all my goods and made a fair\r\nprofit (on paper), I set myself to return to Natal, proposing to rest\r\nawhile in my little house at Durban, and told Hans my mind.\r\n\r\n“Very good, Baas,” he said. “I, too, should like to go to Durban. There\r\nare lots of things there that we cannot get here,” and he fixed his\r\nroving eye upon a square-faced gin bottle, which as it happened was\r\nfilled with nothing stronger than water, because all the gin was drunk.\r\n“Yet, Baas, we shall not see the Berea for a long while.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you say that?” I asked sharply.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Baas, I don’t know, but you went to visit the Opener-of-Roads, did\r\nyou not, and he told you to go north and lent you a certain Great\r\nMedicine, did he not?”\r\n\r\nHere Hans proceeded to light his corncob pipe with an ash from the\r\nfire, all the time keeping his beady eyes fixed upon that part of me\r\nwhere he knew the talisman was hung.\r\n\r\n“Quite true, Hans, but now I mean to show Zikali that I am not his\r\nmessenger, for south or north or east or west. So to-morrow morning we\r\ncross the river and trek for Natal.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, but then why not cross it this evening? There is still\r\nlight.”\r\n\r\n“I have said that we will cross it to-morrow morning,” I answered with\r\nthat firmness which I have read always indicates a man of character,\r\n“and I do not change my word.”\r\n\r\n“No, Baas, but sometimes other things change besides words. Will the\r\nBaas have that buck’s leg for supper, or the stuff out of a tin with a\r\ndint in it, which we bought at a store two years ago? The flies have\r\ngot at the buck’s leg, but I cut out the bits with the maggots on it\r\nand ate them myself.”\r\n\r\nHans was right, things do change, especially the weather. That night,\r\nunexpectedly, for when I turned in the sky seemed quite serene, there\r\ncame a terrible rain long before it was due, which lasted off and on\r\nfor three whole days and continued intermittently for an indefinite\r\nperiod. Needless to say the river, which it would have been so easy to\r\ncross on this particular evening, by the morning was a raging torrent,\r\nand so remained for several weeks.\r\n\r\nIn despair at length I trekked south to where a ford was reported,\r\nwhich, when reached, proved impracticable.\r\n\r\nI tried another, a dozen miles further on, which was very hard to come\r\nto over boggy land. It looked all right and we were getting across\r\nfinely, when suddenly one of the wheels sank in an unsuspected hole and\r\nthere we stuck. Indeed, I believe the waggon, or bits of it, would have\r\nremained in the neighbourhood of that ford to this day, had I not\r\nmanaged to borrow some extra oxen belonging to a Christian Kaffir, and\r\nwith their help to drag it back to the bank whence we had started.\r\n\r\nAs it happened I was only just in time, since a new storm which had\r\nburst further up the river, brought it down in flood again, a very\r\nheavy flood.\r\n\r\nIn this country, England, where I write, there are bridges everywhere\r\nand no one seems to appreciate them. If they think of them at all it is\r\nto grumble about the cost of their upkeep. I wish they could have\r\nexperienced what a lack of them means in a wild country during times of\r\nexcessive rain, and the same remark applied to roads. You should think\r\nmore of your blessings, my friends, as the old woman said to her\r\ncomplaining daughter who had twins two years running, adding that they\r\nmight have been triplets.\r\n\r\nTo return—after this I confessed myself beaten and gave up until such\r\ntime as it should please Providence to turn off the water-tap. Trekking\r\nout of sight of that infernal river which annoyed me with its constant\r\ngurgling, I camped on a comparatively dry spot that overlooked a\r\nbeautiful stretch of rolling veld. Towards sunset the clouds lifted and\r\nI saw a mile or two away a most extraordinary mountain on the lower\r\nslopes of which grew a dense forest. Its upper part, which was of bare\r\nrock, looked exactly like the seated figure of a grotesque person with\r\nthe chin resting on the breast. There was the head, there were the\r\narms, there were the knees. Indeed, the whole mass of it reminded me\r\nstrongly of the effigy of Zikali which was tied about my neck, or\r\nrather of Zikali himself.\r\n\r\n“What is that called?” I said to Hans, pointing to this strange hill,\r\nnow blazing in the angry fire of the setting sun that had burst out\r\nbetween the storm clouds, which made it appear more ominous even than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n“That is the Witch Mountain, Baas, where the Chief Umslopogaas and a\r\nblood brother of his who carried a great club used to hunt with the\r\nwolves. It is haunted and in a cave at the top of it lie the bones of\r\nNada the Lily, the fair woman whose name is a song, she who was the\r\nlove of Umslopogaas.”[2]\r\n\r\n [2] For the story of Umslopogaas and Nada see the book called “Nada\r\n the Lily.”—Editor.\r\n\r\n“Rubbish,” I said, though I had heard something of all that story and\r\nremembered that Zikali had mentioned this Nada, comparing her beauty to\r\nthat of another whom once I knew.\r\n\r\n“Where then lives the Chief Umslopogaas?”\r\n\r\n“They say that his town is yonder on the plain, Baas. It is called the\r\nPlace of the Axe and is strongly fortified with a river round most of\r\nit, and his people are the People of the Axe. They are a fierce people,\r\nand all the country round here is uninhabited because Umslopogaas has\r\ncleaned out the tribes who used to live in it, first with his wolves\r\nand afterwards in war. He is so strong a chief and so terrible in\r\nbattle that even Chaka himself was afraid of him, and they say that he\r\nbrought Dingaan the King to his end because of a quarrel about this\r\nNada. Cetywayo, the present king, too leaves him alone and to him he\r\npays no tribute.”\r\n\r\nWhilst I was about to ask Hans from whom he had collected all this\r\ninformation, suddenly I heard sounds, and looking up, saw three tall\r\nmen clad in full herald’s dress rushing towards us at great speed.\r\n\r\n“Here come some chips from the Axe,” said Hans, and promptly bolted\r\ninto the waggon.\r\n\r\nI did not bolt because there was no time to do so without loss of\r\ndignity, but, although I wished I had my rifle with me, just sat still\r\nupon my stool and with great deliberation lighted my pipe, taking not\r\nthe slightest notice of the three savage-looking fellows.\r\n\r\nThese, who I noted carried axes instead of assegais, rushed straight at\r\nme with the axes raised in such a fashion that anyone unacquainted with\r\nthe habits of Zulu warriors of the old school, might have thought that\r\nthey intended nothing short of murder.\r\n\r\nAs I expected, however, within about six feet of me they halted\r\nsuddenly and stood there still as statues. For my part I went on\r\nlighting my pipe as though I did not see them and when at length I was\r\nobliged to lift my head, surveyed them with an air of mild interest.\r\n\r\nThen I took a little book out of my pocket, it was my favourite copy of\r\nthe Ingoldsby Legends—and began to read.\r\n\r\nThe passage which caught my eye, if “axe” be substituted for “knife”\r\nwas not inappropriate. It was from “The Nurse’s Story,” and runs,\r\n\r\n“But, oh! what a thing ‘tis to see and to know\r\nThat the bare knife is raised in the hand of the foe,\r\nWithout hope to repel or to ward off the blow!”\r\n\r\nThis proceeding of mine astonished them a good deal who felt that they\r\nhad, so to speak, missed fire. At last the soldier in the middle said,\r\n\r\n“Are you blind, White Man?”\r\n\r\n“No, Black Fellow,” I answered, “but I am short-sighted. Would you be\r\nso good as to stand out of my light?” a remark which puzzled them so\r\nmuch that all three drew back a few paces.\r\n\r\nWhen I had read a little further I came to the following lines,\r\n\r\n“‘Tis plain,\r\nAs anatomists tell us, that never again,\r\nShall life revisit the foully slain\r\nWhen once they’ve been cut through the jugular vein.”\r\n\r\nIn my circumstances at that moment this statement seemed altogether too\r\nsuggestive, so I shut up the book and remarked,\r\n\r\n“If you are wanderers who want food, as I judge by your being so thin,\r\nI am sorry that I have little meat, but my servants will give you what\r\nthey can.”\r\n\r\n“_Ow!_” said the spokesman, “he calls us wanderers! Either he must be a\r\nvery great man or he is mad.”\r\n\r\n“You are right. I _am_ a great man,” I answered, yawning, “and if you\r\ntrouble me too much you will see that I can be mad also. Now what do\r\nyou want?”\r\n\r\n“We are messengers from the great Chief Umslopogaas, Captain of the\r\nPeople of the Axe, and we want tribute,” answered the man in a somewhat\r\nchanged tone.\r\n\r\n“Do you? Then you won’t get it. I thought that only the King of\r\nZululand had a right to tribute, and your Captain’s name is not\r\nCetywayo, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Our Captain is King here,” said the man still more uncertainly.\r\n\r\n“Is he indeed? Then away with you back to him and tell this King of\r\nwhom I have never heard, though I have a message for a certain\r\nUmslopogaas, that Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night, intends to visit him\r\nto-morrow, if he will send a guide at the first light to show the best\r\npath for the waggon.”\r\n\r\n“Hearken,” said the man to his companions, “this is Macumazahn himself\r\nand no other. Well, we thought it, for who else would have dared——”\r\n\r\nThen they saluted with their axes, calling me “Chief” and other fine\r\nnames, and departed as they had come, at a run, calling out that my\r\nmessage should be delivered and that doubtless Umslopogaas would send\r\nthe guide.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that, quite contrary to my intention, after all\r\ncircumstances brought me to the Town of the Axe. Even to the last\r\nmoment I had not meant to go there, but when the tribute was demanded I\r\nsaw that it was best to do so, and having once passed my word it could\r\nnot be altered. Indeed, I felt sure that in this event there would be\r\ntrouble and that my oxen would be stolen, or worse.\r\n\r\nSo Fate having issued its decree, of which Hans’s version was that\r\nZikali, or his Great Medicine, had so arranged things, I shrugged my\r\nshoulders and waited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nUMSLOPOGAAS OF THE AXE\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning at the dawn guides arrived from the Town of the Axe,\r\nbringing with them a yoke of spare oxen, which showed that its Chief\r\nwas really anxious to see me. So, in due course we inspanned and\r\nstarted, the guides leading us by a rough but practicable road down the\r\nsteep hillside to the saucer-like plain beneath, where I saw many\r\ncattle grazing. Travelling some miles across this plain, we came at\r\nlast to a river of no great breadth that encircled a considerable\r\nKaffir town on three sides, the fourth being protected by a little line\r\nof koppies which were joined together with walls. Also the place was\r\nstrongly fortified with fences and in every other way known to the\r\nnative mind.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the spare oxen we crossed the river safely at the\r\nford, although it was very full, and on the further side were received\r\nby a guard of men, tall, soldierlike fellows, all of them armed with\r\naxes as the messengers had been. They led us up to the cattle enclosure\r\nin the centre of the town, which although it could be used to protect\r\nbeasts in case of emergency, also served the practical purpose of a\r\npublic square.\r\n\r\nHere some ceremony was in progress, for soldiers stood round the kraal\r\nwhile heralds pranced and shouted. At the head of the place in front of\r\nthe chief’s big hut was a little group of people, among whom a big,\r\ngaunt man sat upon a stool clad in a warrior’s dress with a great and\r\nvery long axe hafted with wire-lashed rhinoceros horn, laid across his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nOur guides led me, with Hans sneaking after me like a dejected and\r\nlow-bred dog (for the waggon had stopped outside the gate), across the\r\nkraal to where the heralds shouted and the big man sat yawning. At once\r\nI noted that he was a very remarkable person, broad and tall and spare\r\nof frame, with long, tough-looking arms and a fierce face which\r\nreminded me of that of the late King Dingaan. Also he had a great hole\r\nin his head above the temple where the skull had been driven in by some\r\nblow, and keen, royal-looking eyes.\r\n\r\nHe looked up and seeing me, cried out,\r\n\r\n“What! Has a white man come to fight me for the chieftainship of the\r\nPeople of the Axe? Well, he is a small one.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered quietly, “but Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night, has come\r\nto visit you in answer to your request, O Umslopogaas; Macumazahn whose\r\nname was known in this land before yours was told of, O Umslopogaas.”\r\n\r\nThe Chief heard and rising from his seat, lifted the big axe in salute.\r\n\r\n“I greet you, O Macumazahn,” he said, “who although you are small in\r\nstature, are very great indeed in fame. Have I not heard how you\r\nconquered Bangu, although Saduko slew him, and of how you gave up the\r\nsix hundred head of cattle to Tshoza and the men of the Amangwane who\r\nfought with you, the cattle that were your own? Have I not heard how\r\nyou led the Tulwana against the Usutu and stamped flat three of\r\nCetywayo’s regiments in the days of Panda, although, alas! because of\r\nan oath of mine I lifted no steel in that battle, I who will have\r\nnothing to do with those that spring from the blood of\r\nSenzangacona—perhaps because I smell too strongly of it, Macumazahn.\r\nOh! yes, I have heard these and many other things concerning you,\r\nthough until now it has never been my fortune to look upon your face, O\r\nWatcher-by-Night, and therefore I greet you well, Bold one, Cunning\r\none, Upright one, Friend of us Black People.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” I answered, “but you said something about fighting. If\r\nthere is to be anything of the sort, let us get it over. If you want to\r\nfight, I am quite ready,” and I tapped the rifle which I carried.\r\n\r\nThe grim Chief broke into a laugh and said,\r\n\r\n“Listen. By an ancient law any man on this day in each year may fight\r\nme for this Chieftainship, as I fought and conquered him who held it\r\nbefore me, and take it from me with my life and the axe, though of late\r\nnone seems to like the business. But that law was made before there\r\nwere guns, or men like Macumazahn who, it is said, can hit a lizard on\r\na wall at fifty paces. Therefore I tell you that if you wish to fight\r\nme with a rifle, O Macumazahn, I give in and you may have the\r\nchieftainship,” and he laughed again in his fierce fashion.\r\n\r\n“I think it is too hot for fighting either with guns or axes, and\r\nChieftainships are honey that is full of stinging bees,” I answered.\r\n\r\nThen I took my seat on a stool that had been brought for me and placed\r\nby the side of Umslopogaas, after which the ceremony went on.\r\n\r\nThe heralds cried out the challenge to all and sundry to come and fight\r\nthe Holder of the Axe for the chieftainship of the Axe without the\r\nslightest result, since nobody seemed to desire to do anything of the\r\nsort. Then, after a pause, Umslopogaas rose, swinging his formidable\r\nweapon round his head and declared that by right of conquest he was\r\nChief of the Tribe for the ensuing year, an announcement that everybody\r\naccepted without surprise.\r\n\r\nAgain the heralds summoned all and sundry who had grievances, to come\r\nforward and to state them and receive redress.\r\n\r\nAfter a little pause there appeared a very handsome woman with large\r\neyes, particularly brilliant eyes that rolled as though they were in\r\nsearch of someone. She was finely dressed and I saw by the ornaments\r\nshe wore that she held the rank of a chief’s wife.\r\n\r\n“I, Monazi, have a complaint to make,” she said, “as it is the right of\r\nthe humblest to do on this day. In succession to Zinita whom Dingaan\r\nslew with her children, I am your _Inkosikaas_, your head-wife, O\r\nUmslopogaas.”\r\n\r\n“That I know well enough,” said Umslopogaas, “what of it?”\r\n\r\n“This, that you neglect me for other women, as you neglected Zinita for\r\nNada the Beautiful, Nada the witch. I am childless, as are all your\r\nwives because of the curse that this Nada left behind her. I demand\r\nthat this curse should be lifted from me. For your sake I abandoned\r\nLousta the Chief, to whom I was betrothed, and this is the end of it,\r\nthat I am neglected and childless.”\r\n\r\n“Am I the Heavens Above that I can cause you to bear children, woman?”\r\nasked Umslopogaas angrily. “Would that you had clung to Lousta, my\r\nblood-brother and my friend, whom you lament, and left me alone.”\r\n\r\n“That still may chance, if I am not better treated,” answered Monazi\r\nwith a flash of her eyes. “Will you dismiss yonder new wife of yours\r\nand give me back my place, and will you lift the curse of Nada off me,\r\nor will you not?”\r\n\r\n“As to the first,” answered Umslopogaas, “learn, Monazi, that I will\r\nnot dismiss my new wife, who at least is gentler-tongued and\r\ntruer-hearted than you are. As to the second, you ask that which it is\r\nnot in my power to give, since children are the gift of Heaven, and\r\nbarrenness is its bane. Moreover, you have done ill to bring into this\r\nmatter the name of one who is dead, who of all women was the sweetest\r\nand most innocent. Lastly, I warn you before the people to cease from\r\nyour plottings or traffic with Lousta, lest ill come of them to you, or\r\nhim, even though he be my blood-brother, or to both.”\r\n\r\n“Plottings!” cried Monazi in a shrill and furious voice. “Does\r\nUmslopogaas talk of plottings? Well, I have heard that Chaka the Lion\r\nleft a son, and that this son has set a trap for the feet of him who\r\nsits on Chaka’s throne. Perchance that king has heard it also;\r\nperchance the People of the Axe will soon have another Chief.”\r\n\r\n“Is it thus?” said Umslopogaas quietly. “And if so, will he be named\r\nLousta?”\r\n\r\nThen his smouldering wrath broke out and in a kind of roaring voice he\r\nwent on,\r\n\r\n“What have I done that the wives of my bosom should be my betrayers,\r\nthose who would give me to death? Zinita betrayed me to Dingaan and in\r\nreward was slain, and my children with her. Now would you, Monazi,\r\nbetray me to Cetywayo—though in truth there is naught to betray? Well,\r\nif so, bethink you and let Lousta bethink him of what chanced to\r\nZinita, and of what chances to those who stand before the axe of\r\nUmslopogaas. What have I done, I say, that women should thus strive to\r\nwork me ill?”\r\n\r\n“This,” answered Monazi with a mocking laugh, “that you have loved one\r\nof them too well. If he would live in peace, he who has wives should\r\nfavour all alike. Least of anything should he moan continually over one\r\nwho is dead, a witch who has left a curse behind her and thus insulted\r\nand do wrong to the living. Also he would be wise to attend to the\r\nmatters of his own tribe and household and to cease from ambitions that\r\nmay bring him to the assegai, and them with him.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard your counsel, Wife, so now begone!” said Umslopogaas,\r\nlooking at her very strangely, and it seemed to me not without fear.\r\n\r\n“Have you wives, Macumazahn?” he asked of me in a low voice when she\r\nwas out of hearing.\r\n\r\n“Only among the spirits,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Well for you then; moreover, it is a bond between us, for I too have\r\nbut one true wife and she also is among the spirits. But go rest a\r\nwhile, and later we will talk.”\r\n\r\nSo I went, leaving the Chief to his business, thinking as I walked away\r\nof a certain message with which I was charged for him and of how into\r\nthat message came names that I had just heard, namely that of a man\r\ncalled Lousta and of a woman called Monazi. Also I thought of the hints\r\nwhich in her jealous anger and disappointment at her lack of children,\r\nthis woman had dropped about a plot against him who sat on the throne\r\nof Chaka, which of course must mean King Cetywayo himself.\r\n\r\nI came to the guest-hut, which proved to be a very good place and\r\nclean; also in it I found plenty of food made ready for me and for my\r\nservants. After eating I slept for a time as it is always my fashion to\r\ndo when I have nothing else on hand, since who knows for how long he\r\nmay be kept awake at night? Indeed, it was not until the sun had begun\r\nto sink that a messenger came, saying that the Chief desired to see me\r\nif I had rested. So I went to his big hut which stood alone with a\r\nstrong fence set round it at a distance, so that none could come within\r\nhearing of what was said, even at the door of the hut. I observed also\r\nthat a man armed with an axe kept guard at the gateway in this fence\r\nround which he walked from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Umslopogaas was seated on a stool by the door of his hut with\r\nhis rhinoceros-horn-handled axe which was fastened to his right wrist\r\nby a thong, leaning against his thigh, and a wolfskin hanging from his\r\nbroad shoulders. Very grim and fierce he looked thus, with the red\r\nlight of the sunset playing on him. He greeted me and pointed to\r\nanother stool on which I sat myself down. Apparently he had been\r\nwatching my eyes, for he said,\r\n\r\n“I see that like other creatures which move at night, such as leopards\r\nand hyenas, you take note of all, O Watcher-by-Night, even of the\r\nsoldier who guards this place and of where the fence is set and of how\r\nits gate is fashioned.”\r\n\r\n“Had I not done so I should have been dead long ago, O Chief.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and because it is not my nature to do so as I should, perchance I\r\nshall soon be dead. It is not enough to be fierce and foremost in the\r\nbattle, Macumazahn. He who would sleep safe and of whom, when he dies,\r\nfolk will say ‘He has eaten’ (i.e., he has lived out his life), must do\r\nmore than this. He must guard his tongue and even his thoughts! he must\r\nlisten to the stirring of rats in the thatch and look for snakes in the\r\ngrass; he must trust few, and least of all those who sleep upon his\r\nbosom. But those who have the Lion’s blood in them or who are prone to\r\ncharge like a buffalo, often neglect these matters and therefore in the\r\nend they fall into a pit.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “especially those who have the lion’s blood in them,\r\nwhether that lion be man or beast.”\r\n\r\nThis I said because of the rumours I had heard that this Slaughterer\r\nwas in truth the son of Chaka. Therefore not knowing whether or no he\r\nwere playing on the word “lion,” which was Chaka’s title, I wished to\r\ndraw him, especially as I saw in his face a great likeness to Chaka’s\r\nbrother Dingaan, whom, it was whispered, this same Umslopogaas had\r\nslain. As it happened I failed, for after a pause he said,\r\n\r\n“Why do you come to visit me, Macumazahn, who have never done so\r\nbefore?”\r\n\r\n“I do not come to visit you, Umslopogaas. That was not my intention.\r\nYou brought me, or rather the flooded rivers and you together brought\r\nme, for I was on my way to Natal and could not cross the drifts.”\r\n\r\n“Yet I think you have a message for me, White Man, for not long ago a\r\ncertain wandering witch-doctor who came here told me to expect you and\r\nthat you had words to say to me.”\r\n\r\n“Did he, Umslopogaas? Well, it is true that I have a message, though it\r\nis one that I did not mean to deliver.”\r\n\r\n“Yet being here, perchance you will deliver it, Macumazahn, for those\r\nwho have messages and will not speak them, sometimes come to trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, being here, I will deliver it, seeing that so it seems to be\r\nfated. Tell me, do you chance to know a certain Small One who is great,\r\na certain Old One whose brain is young, a doctor who is called\r\nOpener-of-Roads?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard of him, as have my forefathers for generations.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, and if it pleases you to tell me, Umslopogaas, what might be\r\nthe names of those forefathers of yours, who have heard of this doctor\r\nfor generations? They must have been short-lived men and as such I\r\nshould like to know of them.”\r\n\r\n“That you cannot,” replied Umslopogaas shortly, “since they are\r\n_hlonipa_ (i.e. not to be spoken) in this land.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” I said again. “I thought that rule applied only to the names\r\nof kings, but of course I am but an ignorant white man who may well be\r\nmistaken on such matters of your Zulu customs.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, O Macumazahn, you may be mistaken or—you may not. It matters\r\nnothing. But what of this message of yours?”\r\n\r\n“It came at the end of a long story, O Bulalio. But since you seek to\r\nknow, these were the words of it, so nearly as I can remember them.”\r\n\r\nThen sentence by sentence I repeated to him all that Zikali had said to\r\nme when he called me back after bidding me farewell, which doubtless he\r\ndid because he wished to cut his message more deeply into the tablets\r\nof my mind.\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas listened to every syllable with a curious intentness, and\r\nthen asked me to repeat it all again, which I did.\r\n\r\n“Lousta! Monazi!” he said slowly. “Well, you heard those names to-day,\r\ndid you not, White Man? And you heard certain things from the lips of\r\nthis Monazi who was angry, that give colour to that talk of the\r\nOpener-of-Roads. It seems to me,” he added, glancing about him and\r\nspeaking in a low voice, “that what I suspected is true and that\r\nwithout doubt I am betrayed.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand,” I replied indifferently. “All this talk is dark\r\nto me, as is the message of the Opener-of-Roads, or rather its meaning.\r\nBy whom and about what are you betrayed?”\r\n\r\n“Let that snake sleep. Do not kick it with your foot. Suffice it you to\r\nknow that my head hangs upon this matter; that I am a rat in a forked\r\nstick, and if the stick is pressed on by a heavy hand, then where is\r\nthe rat?”\r\n\r\n“Where all rats go, I suppose, that is, unless they are wise rats that\r\nbite the hand which holds the stick before it is pressed down.”\r\n\r\n“What is the rest of this story of yours, Macumazahn, which was told\r\nbefore the Opener-of-Roads gave you that message? Does it please you to\r\nrepeat it to me that I may judge of it with my ears?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” I answered, “on one condition, that what the ears hear,\r\nthe heart shall keep to itself alone.”\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas stooped and laid his hand upon the broad blade of the\r\nweapon beside him, saying,\r\n\r\n“By the Axe I swear it. If I break the oath be the Axe my doom.”\r\n\r\nThen I told him the tale, as I have set it down already, thinking to\r\nmyself that of it he would understand little, being but a wild\r\nwarrior-man. As it chanced, however, I was mistaken, for he seemed to\r\nunderstand a great deal, perchance because such primitive natures are\r\nin closer touch with high and secret things than we imagine; perchance\r\nfor other reasons with which I became acquainted later.\r\n\r\n“It stands thus,” he said when I had finished, “or so I think. You,\r\nMacumazahn, seek certain women who are dead to learn whether they still\r\nlive, or are really dead, but so far have failed to find them. Still\r\nseeking, you asked the counsel of Zikali, Opener-of-Roads, he who among\r\nother titles is also called ‘Home of Spirits.’ He answered that he\r\ncould not satisfy your heart because this tree was too tall for him to\r\nclimb, but that far to the north there lives a certain white witch who\r\nhas powers greater than his, being able to fly to the top of any tree,\r\nand to this white witch he bade you go. Have I the story right thus\r\nfar?”\r\n\r\nI answered that he had.\r\n\r\n“Good! Then Zikali went on to choose you companions for your journey,\r\nbut two, leaving out the guards or servants. I, Umhlopekazi, called\r\nBulalio the Slaughterer, called the Woodpecker also, was one of these,\r\nand that little yellow monkey of a man whom I saw with you to-day,\r\ncalled Hansi, was the other. Then you made a mock of Zikali by\r\ndetermining not to visit me, Umhlopekazi, and not to go north to find\r\nthe great white Queen of whom he had told you, but to return to Natal.\r\nIs that so?”\r\n\r\nI said it was.\r\n\r\n“Then the rain fell and the winds blew and the rivers rose in wrath so\r\nthat you could not return to Natal, and after all by chance, or by\r\nfate, or by the will of Zikali, the wizard of wizards, you drifted here\r\nto the kraal of me, Umhlopekazi, and told me this story.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Well, White Man, how am I to know that all this is not but a trap for\r\nmy feet which already seem to feel cords between the toes of both of\r\nthem? What token do you bring, O Watcher-by-Night? How am I to know\r\nthat the Opener-of-Roads really sent me this message which has been\r\ndelivered so strangely by one who wished to travel on another path? The\r\nwandering witch-doctor told me that he who came would bear some sign.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say,” I answered, “at least in words. But,” I added after\r\nreflection, “as you ask for a token, perhaps I might be able to show\r\nyou something that would bring proof to your heart, if there were any\r\nsecret place——”\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas walked to the gateway of the fence and saw that the sentry\r\nwas at his post. Then he walked round the hut casting an eye upon its\r\nroof, and muttered to me as he returned.\r\n\r\n“Once I was caught thus. There lived a certain wife of mine who set her\r\near to the smoke-hole and so brought about the death of many, and among\r\nthem of herself and of our children. Enter. All is safe. Yet if you\r\ntalk, speak low.”\r\n\r\nSo we went into the hut taking the stools with us, and seated ourselves\r\nby the fire that burned there on to which Umslopogaas threw chips of\r\nresinous wood.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said.\r\n\r\nI opened my shirt and by the clear light of the flame showed him the\r\nimage of Zikali which hung about my neck. He stared at it, though touch\r\nit he would not. Then he stood up and lifting his great axe, he saluted\r\nthe image with the word “_Makosi!_” the salute that is given to great\r\nwizards because they are supposed to be the home of many spirits.\r\n\r\n“It is the big Medicine, the Medicine itself,” he said, “that which has\r\nbeen known in the land since the time of Senzangacona, the father of\r\nthe Zulu Royal House, and as it is said, before him.”\r\n\r\n“How can that be?” I asked, “seeing that this image represents Zikali,\r\nOpener-of-Roads, as an old man, and Senzangacona died many years ago?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” he answered, “but it is so. Listen. There was a\r\ncertain Mopo, or as some called him, Umbopo, who was Chaka’s\r\nbody-servant and my foster-father, and he told me that twice this\r\nMedicine,” and he pointed to the image, “was sent to Chaka, and that\r\neach time the Lion obeyed the message that came with it. A third time\r\nit was sent, but he did not obey the message and then—where was Chaka?”\r\n\r\nHere Umslopogaas passed his hand across his mouth, a significant\r\ngesture amongst the Zulus.\r\n\r\n“Mopo,” I said, “yes, I have heard the story of Mopo, also that Chaka’s\r\nbody became _his_ servant in the end, since Mopo killed him with the\r\nhelp of the princes Dingaan and Umhlangana. Also I have heard that this\r\nMopo still lives, though not in Zululand.”\r\n\r\n“Does he, Macumazahn?” said Umslopogaas, taking snuff from a spoon and\r\nlooking at me keenly over the spoon. “You seem to know a great deal,\r\nMacumazahn; too much as some might think.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “perhaps I do know too much, or at any rate more\r\nthan I want to know. For instance, O fosterling of Mopo and son of—was\r\nthe lady named Baleka?—I know a good deal about _you_.”\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas stared at me and laying his hand upon the great axe, half\r\nrose. Then he sat down again.\r\n\r\n“I think that this,” and I touched the image of Zikali upon my breast,\r\n“would turn even the blade of the axe named Groan-maker,” I said and\r\npaused. As nothing happened, I went on, “For instance, again I think I\r\nknow—or have I dreamed it?—that a certain chief, whose mother’s name I\r\nbelieve was Baleka—by the way, was she not one of Chaka’s\r\n‘sisters’?—has been plotting against that son of Panda who sits upon\r\nthe throne, and that his plots have been betrayed, so that he is in\r\nsome danger of his life.”\r\n\r\n“Macumazahn,” said Umslopogaas hoarsely, “I tell you that did you not\r\nwear the Great Medicine on your breast, I would kill you where you sit\r\nand bury you beneath the floor of the hut, as one who knows—too much.”\r\n\r\n“It would be a mistake, Umslopogaas, one of the many that you have\r\nmade. But as I _do_ wear the Medicine, the question does not arise,\r\ndoes it?”\r\n\r\nAgain he made no answer and I went on, “And now, what about this\r\njourney to the north? If indeed I must make it, would you wish to\r\naccompany me?”\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas rose from the stool and crawled out of the hut, apparently\r\nto make some inspection. Presently he returned and remarked that the\r\nnight was clear although there were heavy storm clouds on the horizon,\r\nby which I understood him to convey in Zulu metaphor that it was safe\r\nfor us to talk, but that danger threatened from afar.\r\n\r\n“Macumazahn,” he said, “we speak under the blanket of the\r\nOpener-of-Roads who sits upon your heart, and whose sign you bring to\r\nme, as he sent me word that you would, do we not?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” I answered. “At any rate we speak as man to man, and\r\nhitherto the honour of Macumazahn has not been doubted in Zululand. So\r\nif you have anything to say, Chief Bulalio, say it at once, for I am\r\ntired and should like to eat and rest.”\r\n\r\n“Good, Macumazahn. I have this to say. I who am the son of one who was\r\ngreater than he, have plotted to seize the throne of Zululand from him\r\nwho sits upon that throne. It is true, for I grew weary of my idleness\r\nas a petty chief. Moreover, I should have succeeded with the help of\r\nZikali, who hates the House of Senzangacona, though me, who am of its\r\nblood, he does not hate, because ever I have striven against that\r\nHouse. But it seems from his message and those words spoken by an angry\r\nwoman, that I have been betrayed, and that to-night or to-morrow night,\r\nor by the next moon, the slayers will be upon me, smiting me before I\r\ncan smite, at which I cannot grumble.”\r\n\r\n“By whom have you been betrayed, Umslopogaas?”\r\n\r\n“By that wife of mine, as I think, Macumazahn. Also by Lousta, my\r\nblood-brother, over whom she has cast her net and made false to me, so\r\nthat he hopes to win her whom he has always loved and with her the\r\nChieftainship of the Axe. Now what shall I do?—Tell me, you whose eyes\r\ncan see in the dark.”\r\n\r\nI thought a moment and answered, “I think that if I were you, I would\r\nleave this Lousta to sit in my place for a while as Chief of the People\r\nof the Axe, and take a journey north, Umslopogaas. Then if trouble\r\ncomes from the Great House where a king sits, it will come to Lousta\r\nwho can show that the People of the Axe are innocent and that you are\r\nfar away.”\r\n\r\n“That is cunning, Macumazahn. There speaks the Great Medicine. If I go\r\nnorth, who can say that I have plotted, and if I leave my betrayer in\r\nmy place, who can say that I was a traitor, who have set him where I\r\nused to sit and left the land upon a private matter? And now tell me of\r\nthis journey of yours.”\r\n\r\nSo I told him everything, although until that moment I had not made up\r\nmy mind to go upon this journey, I who had come here to his kraal by\r\naccident, or so it seemed, and by accident had delivered to him a\r\ncertain message.\r\n\r\n“You wish to consult a white witch-doctoress, Macumazahn, who according\r\nto Zikali lives far to the north, as to the dead. Now I too, though\r\nperchance you will not think it of a black man, desire to learn of the\r\ndead; yes, of a certain wife of my youth who was sister and friend as\r\nwell as wife, whom too I loved better than all the world. Also I desire\r\nto learn of a brother of mine whose name I never speak, who ruled the\r\nwolves with me and who died at my side on yonder Witch-Mountain, having\r\nmade him a mat of men to lie on in a great and glorious fight. For of\r\nhim as of the woman I think all day and dream all night, and I would\r\nknow if they still live anywhere and I may look to see them again when\r\nI have died as a warrior should and as I hope to do. Do you understand,\r\nWatcher-by-Night?”\r\n\r\nI answered that I understood very well, as his case seemed to be like\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\n“It may happen,” went on Umslopogaas, “that all this talk of the dead\r\nwho are supposed to live after they are dead, is but as the sound of\r\nwind whispering in the reeds at night, that comes from nowhere and goes\r\nnowhere and means nothing. But at least ours will be a great journey in\r\nwhich we shall find adventure and fighting, since it is well known in\r\nthe land that wherever Macumazahn goes there is plenty of both. Also it\r\nseems well for reasons that have been spoken of between us, as Zikali\r\nsays, that I should leave the country of the Zulus for a while, who\r\ndesire to die a man’s death at the last and not to be trapped like a\r\njackal in a pit. Lastly I think that we shall agree well together\r\nthough my temper is rough at times, and that neither of us will desert\r\nthe other in trouble, though of that little yellow dog of yours I am\r\nnot so sure.”\r\n\r\n“I answer for him,” I replied. “Hans is a true man, cunning also when\r\nonce he is away from drink.”\r\n\r\nThen we spoke of plans for our journey, and of when and where we should\r\nmeet to make it, talking till it was late, after which I went to sleep\r\nin the guest-hut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nTHE LION AND THE AXE\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day early I left the town of the People of the Axe, having bid a\r\nformal farewell to Umslopogaas, saying in a voice that all could hear\r\nthat as the rivers were still flooded, I proposed to trek to the\r\nnorthern parts of Zululand and trade there until the weather was\r\nbetter. Our private arrangement, however, was that on the night of the\r\nnext full moon, which happened about four weeks later, we should meet\r\nat the eastern foot of a certain great, flat-topped mountain known to\r\nboth of us, which stands to the north of Zululand but well beyond its\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nSo northward I trekked, slowly to spare my oxen, trading as I went. The\r\ndetails do not matter, but as it happened I met with more luck upon\r\nthat journey than had come my way for many a long year. Although I\r\nworked on credit since nearly all my goods were sold, as owing to my\r\nrepute I could always do in Zululand, I made some excellent bargains in\r\ncattle, and to top up with, bought a large lot of ivory so cheap that\r\nreally I think it must have been stolen.\r\n\r\nAll of this, cattle and ivory together, I sent to Natal in charge of a\r\nwhite friend of mine whom I could trust, where the stuff was sold very\r\nwell indeed, and the proceeds paid to my account, the “trade”\r\nequivalents being duly remitted to the native vendors.\r\n\r\nIn fact, my good fortune was such that if I had been superstitious like\r\nHans, I should have been inclined to attribute it to the influence of\r\nZikali’s “Great Medicine.” As it was I knew it to be one of the chances\r\nof a trader’s life and accepted it with a shrug as often as I had been\r\naccustomed to do in the alternative of losses.\r\n\r\nOnly one untoward incident happened to me. Of a sudden a party of the\r\nKing’s soldiers under the command of a well-known _Induna_ or\r\nCouncillor, arrived and insisted upon searching my waggon, as I thought\r\nat first in connection with that cheap lot of ivory which had already\r\ndeparted to Natal. However, never a word did they say of ivory, nor\r\nindeed was a single thing belonging to me taken by them.\r\n\r\nI was very indignant and expressed my feelings to the _Induna_ in no\r\nmeasured terms. He on his part was most apologetic, and explained that\r\nwhat he did he was obliged to do “by the King’s orders.” Also he let it\r\nslip that he was seeking for a certain “evil-doer” who, it was thought,\r\nmight be with me without my knowing his real character, and as this\r\n“evil-doer,” whose name he would not mention, was a very fierce man, it\r\nhad been necessary to bring a strong guard with him.\r\n\r\nNow I bethought me of Umslopogaas, but merely looked blank and shrugged\r\nmy shoulders, saying that I was not in the habit of consorting with\r\nevil-doers.\r\n\r\nStill unsatisfied, the _Induna_ questioned me as to the places where I\r\nhad been during this journey of mine in the Zulu country. I told him\r\nwith the utmost frankness, mentioning among others—because I was sure\r\nthat already he knew all my movements well—the town of the People of\r\nthe Axe.\r\n\r\nThen he asked me if I had seen its Chief, a certain Umslopogaas or\r\nBulalio. I answered, Yes, that I had met him there for the first time\r\nand thought him a very remarkable man.\r\n\r\nWith this the _Induna_ agreed emphatically, saying that perhaps I did\r\nnot know _how_ remarkable. Next he asked me where he was now, to which\r\nI replied that I had not the faintest idea, but I presumed in his kraal\r\nwhere I had left him. The _Induna_ explained that he was _not_ in his\r\nkraal; that he had gone away leaving one Lousta and his own head wife\r\nMonazi to administer the chieftainship for a while, because, as he\r\nstated, he wished to make a journey.\r\n\r\nI yawned as if weary of the subject of this chief, and indeed of the\r\nwhole business. Then the _Induna_ said that I must come to the King and\r\nrepeat to him all the words that I had spoken. I replied that I could\r\nnot possibly do so as, having finished my trading, I had arranged to go\r\nnorth to shoot elephants. He answered that elephants lived a long while\r\nand would not die while I was visiting the King.\r\n\r\nThen followed an argument which grew heated and ended in his declaring\r\nthat to the King I must come, even if he had to take me there by force.\r\n\r\nI sat silent, wondering what to say or do and leant forward to pick a\r\npiece of wood out of the fire wherewith to light my pipe. Now my shirt\r\nwas not buttoned and as it chanced this action caused the ivory image\r\nof Zikali that hung about my neck to appear between its edges. The\r\n_Induna_ saw it and his eyes grew big with fear.\r\n\r\n“Hide that!” he whispered, “hide that, lest it should bewitch me.\r\nIndeed, already I feel as though I were being bewitched. It is the\r\nGreat Medicine itself.”\r\n\r\n“That will certainly happen to you,” I said, yawning again, “if you\r\ninsist upon my taking a week’s trek to visit the Black One, or\r\ninterfere with me in any way now or afterwards,” and I lifted my hand\r\ntowards the talisman, looking him steadily in the face.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps after all, Macumazahn, it is not necessary for you to visit\r\nthe King,” he said in an uncertain voice. “I will go and make report to\r\nhim that you know nothing of this evil-doer.”\r\n\r\nAnd he went in such a hurry that he never waited to say good-bye. Next\r\nmorning before the dawn I went also and trekked steadily until I was\r\nclear of Zululand.\r\n\r\nIn due course and without accident, for the weather, which had been so\r\nwet, had now turned beautifully fine and dry, we came to the great,\r\nflat-topped hill that I have mentioned, trekking thither over high,\r\nsparsely-timbered veld that offered few difficulties to the waggon.\r\nThis peculiar hill, known to such natives as lived in those parts by a\r\nlong word that means “Hut-with-a-flat-roof,” is surrounded by forest,\r\nfor here trees grow wonderfully well, perhaps because of the water that\r\nflows from its slopes. Forcing our way through this forest, which was\r\nfull of game, I reached its eastern foot and there camped, five days\r\nbefore that night of full moon on which I had arranged to meet\r\nUmslopogaas.\r\n\r\nThat I should meet him I did not in the least believe, firstly because\r\nI thought it very probable that he would have changed his mind about\r\ncoming, and secondly for the excellent reason that I expected he had\r\ngone to call upon the King against his will, as I had been asked to do.\r\nIt was evident to me that he was up to his eyes in some serious plot\r\nagainst Cetywayo, in which he was the old dwarf Zikali’s partner, or\r\nrather, tool; also that his plot had been betrayed, with the result\r\nthat he was “wanted” and would have little chance of passing safely\r\nthrough Zululand. So taking one thing with another I imagined that I\r\nhad seen his grim face and his peculiar, ancient-looking axe for the\r\nlast time.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth I was glad. Although at first the idea had appealed\r\nto me a little, I did not want to make this wild-goose, or wild-witch\r\nchase through unknown lands to seek for a totally fabulous person who\r\ndwelt far across the Zambesi. I had, as it were, been forced into the\r\nthing, but if Umslopogaas did not appear, my obligations would be at an\r\nend and I should return to Natal at my leisure. First, however, I would\r\ndo a little shooting since I found that a large herd of elephants\r\nhaunted this forest. Indeed I was tempted to attack them at once, but\r\ndid not do so since, as Hans pointed out, if we were going north it\r\nwould be difficult to carry the ivory, especially if we had to leave\r\nthe waggon, and I was too old a hunter to desire to kill the great\r\nbeasts for the fun of the thing.\r\n\r\nSo I just sat down and rested, letting the oxen feed throughout the\r\nhours of light on the rich grasses which grew upon the bottom-most\r\nslopes of the big mountain where we were camped by a stream, not more\r\nthan a hundred yards above the timber line.\r\n\r\nAt some time or other there had been a native village at this spot;\r\nprobably the Zulus had cleaned it out in long past years, for I found\r\nhuman bones black with age lying in the long grass. Indeed, the\r\ncattle-kraal still remained and in such good condition that by piling\r\nup a few stones here and there on the walls and closing the narrow\r\nentrances with thorn bushes, we could still use it to enclose our oxen\r\nat night. This I did for fear lest there should be lions about, though\r\nI had neither seen nor heard them.\r\n\r\nSo the days went by pleasantly enough with lots to eat, since whenever\r\nwe wanted meat I had only to go a few yards to shoot a fat buck at a\r\nspot whither they trekked to drink in the evening, till at last came\r\nthe time of full moon. Of this I was also glad, since, to tell the\r\ntruth, I had begun to be bored. Rest is good, but for a man who has\r\nalways led an active life too much of it is very bad, for then he\r\nbegins to think and thought in large doses is depressing.\r\n\r\nOf the fire-eating Umslopogaas there was no sign, so I made up my mind\r\nthat on the morrow I would start after those elephants and when I had\r\nshot—or failed to shoot—some of them, return to Natal. I felt unable to\r\nremain idle any more; it never was my gift to do so, which is perhaps\r\nwhy I employ my ample leisure here in England in jotting down such\r\nreminiscences as these.\r\n\r\nWell, the full moon came up in silver glory and after I had taken a\r\ngood look at her for luck, also at all the veld within sight, I turned\r\nin. An hour or two later some noise from the direction of the\r\ncattle-kraal woke me up. As it did not recur, I thought that I would go\r\nto sleep again. Then an uneasy thought came to me that I could not\r\nremember having looked to see whether the entrance was properly closed,\r\nas it was my habit to do. It was the same sort of troublesome doubt\r\nwhich in a civilised house makes a man get out of bed and go along the\r\ncold passages to the sitting-room to see whether he has put out the\r\nlamp. It always proves that he _has_ put it out, but that does not\r\nprevent a repetition of the performance next time the perplexity\r\narises.\r\n\r\nI reflected that perhaps the noise was caused by the oxen pushing their\r\nway through the carelessly-closed entrance, and at any rate that I had\r\nbetter go to see. So I slipped on my boots and a coat and went without\r\nwaking Hans or the boys, only taking with me a loaded, single-barrelled\r\nrifle which I used for shooting small buck, but no spare cartridges.\r\n\r\nNow in front of the gateway of the cattle-kraal, shading it, grew a\r\nsingle big tree of the wild fig order. Passing under this tree I looked\r\nand saw that the gateway was quite securely closed, as now I remembered\r\nI had noted at sunset. Then I started to go back but had not stepped\r\nmore than two or three paces when, in the bright moonlight, I saw the\r\nhead of my smallest ox, a beast of the Zulu breed, suddenly appear over\r\nthe top of the wall. About this there would have been nothing\r\nparticularly astonishing, had it not been for the fact that this head\r\nbelonged to a dead animal, as I could tell from the closed eyes and the\r\nhanging tongue.\r\n\r\n“What in the name of goodness——” I began to myself, when my reflections\r\nwere cut short by the appearance of another head, that of one of the\r\nbiggest lions I ever saw, which had the ox by the throat, and with the\r\nenormous strength that is given to these creatures, by getting its back\r\nbeneath the body, was deliberately hoisting it over the wall, to drag\r\nit away to devour at its leisure.\r\n\r\nThere was the brute within twelve feet of me, and what is more, it saw\r\nme as I saw it, and stopped, still holding the ox by the throat.\r\n\r\n“What a chance for Allan Quatermain! Of course he shot it dead,” one\r\ncan fancy anyone saying who knows me by repute, also that by the gift\r\nof God I am handy with a rifle. Well, indeed, it should have been, for\r\neven with the small-bore piece that I carried, a bullet ought to have\r\npierced through the soft parts of its throat to the brain and to have\r\nkilled that lion as dead as Julius Cæsar. Theoretically the thing was\r\neasy enough; indeed, although I was startled for a moment, by the time\r\nthat I had the rifle to my shoulder I had little fear of the issue,\r\nunless there was a miss-fire, especially as the beast seemed so\r\nastonished that it remained quite still.\r\n\r\nThen the unexpected happened as generally it does in life, particularly\r\nin hunting, which, in my case, is a part of life. I fired, but by\r\nmisfortune the bullet struck the tip of the horn of that confounded ox,\r\nwhich tip either was or at that moment fell in front of the spot on the\r\nlion’s throat whereat half-unconsciously I had aimed. Result: the ball\r\nwas turned and, departing at an angle, just cut the skin of the lion’s\r\nneck deeply enough to hurt it very much and to make it madder than all\r\nthe hatters in the world.\r\n\r\nDropping the ox, with a most terrific roar it came over the wall at\r\nme—I remember that there seemed to be yards of it—I mean of the lion—in\r\nfront of which appeared a cavernous mouth full of gleaming teeth.\r\n\r\nI skipped back with much agility, also a little to one side, because\r\nthere was nothing else to do, reflecting in a kind of inconsequent way,\r\nthat after all Zikali’s Great Medicine was not worth a curse. The lion\r\nlanded on my side of the wall and reared itself upon its hind legs\r\nbefore getting to business, towering high above me but slightly to my\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThen I saw a strange thing. A shadow thrown by the moon flitted past\r\nme—all I noted of it was the distorted shape of a great, lifted axe,\r\nprobably because the axe came first. The shadow fell and with it\r\nanother shadow, that of a lion’s paw dropping to the ground. Next there\r\nwas a most awful noise of roaring, and wheeling round I saw such a fray\r\nas never I shall see again. A tall, grim, black man was fighting the\r\ngreat lion, that now lacked one paw, but still stood upon its hind\r\nlegs, striking at him with the other.\r\n\r\nThe man, who was absolutely silent, dodged the blow and hit back with\r\nthe axe, catching the beast upon the breast with such weight that it\r\ncame to the ground in a lopsided fashion, since now it had only one\r\nfore-foot on which to light.\r\n\r\nThe axe flashed up again and before the lion could recover itself, or\r\ndo anything else, fell with a crash upon its skull, sinking deep into\r\nthe head. After this all was over, for the beast’s brain was cut in\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n“I am here at the appointed time, Macumazahn,” said Umslopogaas, for it\r\nwas he, as with difficulty he dragged his axe from the lion’s severed\r\nskull, “to find you watching by night as it is reported that you always\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I retorted, for his tone irritated me, “you are late, Bulalio,\r\nthe moon has been up some hours.”\r\n\r\n“I said, O Macumazahn, that I would meet you on the _night_ of the full\r\nmoon, not at the rising of the moon.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” I replied, mollified, “and at any rate you came at a\r\ngood moment.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, “though as it happens in this clear light the thing\r\nwas easy to anyone who can handle an axe. Had it been darker the end\r\nmight have been different. But, Macumazahn, you are not so clever as I\r\nthought, since otherwise you would not have come out against a lion\r\nwith a toy like that,” and he pointed to the little rifle in my hand.\r\n\r\n“I did not know that there was a lion, Umslopogaas.”\r\n\r\n“That is why you are not so clever as I thought, since of one sort or\r\nanother there is always a lion which wise men should be prepared to\r\nmeet, Macumazahn.”\r\n\r\n“You are right again,” I replied.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Hans arrived upon the scene, followed at a discreet\r\ndistance by the waggon boys, and took in the situation at a glance.\r\n\r\n“The Great Medicine of the Opener-of-Roads has worked well,” was all he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“The great medicine of the Opener-of-Heads has worked better,” remarked\r\nUmslopogaas with a little laugh and pointing to his red axe. “Never\r\nbefore since she came into my keeping has _Inkosikaas_ (i.e.\r\n‘Chieftainess,’ for so was this famous weapon named) sunk so low as to\r\ndrink the blood of beasts. Still, the stroke was a good one so she need\r\nnot be ashamed. But, Yellow Man, how comes it that you who, I have been\r\ntold, are cunning, watch your master so ill?”\r\n\r\n“I was asleep,” stuttered Hans indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Those who serve should never sleep,” replied Umslopogaas sternly. Then\r\nhe turned and whistled, and behold! out of the long grass that grew at\r\na little distance, emerged twelve great men, all of them bearing axes\r\nand wearing cloaks of hyena skins, who saluted me by raising their\r\naxes.\r\n\r\n“Set a watch and skin me this beast by dawn. It will make us a mat,”\r\nsaid Umslopogaas, whereon again they saluted silently and melted away.\r\n\r\n“Who are these?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“A few picked warriors whom I brought with me, Macumazahn. There were\r\none or two more, but they got lost on the way.”\r\n\r\nThen we went to the waggon and spoke no more that night.\r\n\r\nNext morning I told Umslopogaas of the visit I had received from the\r\n_Induna_ of the King who wished me to come to the royal kraal. He\r\nnodded and said,\r\n\r\n“As it chances certain thieves attacked me on my journey, which is why\r\none or two of my people remain behind who will never travel again. We\r\nmade good play with those thieves; not one of them escaped,” he added\r\ngrimly, “and their bodies we threw into a river where are many\r\ncrocodiles. But their spears I brought away and I think that they are\r\nsuch as the King’s guard use. If so, his search for them will be long,\r\nsince the fight took place where no man lives and we burned the shields\r\nand trappings. Oho! he will think that the ghosts have taken them.”\r\n\r\nThat morning we trekked on fast, fearing lest a regiment searching for\r\nthese “thieves” should strike and follow our spoor. Luckily the ox that\r\nthe lion had killed was one of some spare cattle which I was driving\r\nwith me, so its loss did not inconvenience us. As we went Umslopogaas\r\ntold me that he had duly appointed Lousta and his wife Monazi to rule\r\nthe tribe during his absence, an office which they accepted doubtfully,\r\nMonazi acting as Chieftainess and Lousta as her head _Induna_ or\r\nCouncillor.\r\n\r\nI asked him whether he thought this wise under all the circumstances,\r\nseeing that it had occurred to me since I made the suggestion, that\r\nthey might be unwilling to surrender power on his return, also that\r\nother domestic complications might ensue.\r\n\r\n“It matters little, Macumazahn,” he said with a shrug of his great\r\nshoulders, “for of this I am sure, that I have played my part with the\r\nPeople of the Axe and to stop among them would have meant my death, who\r\nam a man betrayed. What do I care who love none and now have no\r\nchildren? Still, it is true that I might have fled to Natal with the\r\ncattle and there have led a fat and easy life. But ease and plenty I do\r\nnot desire who would live and fall as a warrior should.\r\n\r\n“Never again, mayhap, shall I see the Ghost-Mountain where the wolves\r\nravened and the old Witch sits in stone waiting for the world to die,\r\nor sleep in the town of the People of the Axe. What do I want with\r\nwives and oxen while I have _Inkosikaas_ the Groan-maker and she is\r\ntrue to me?” he added, shaking the ancient axe above his head so that\r\nthe sun gleamed upon the curved blade and the hollow gouge or point at\r\nthe back beyond the shaft socket. “Where the Axe goes, there go the\r\nstrength and virtue of the Axe, O Macumazahn.”\r\n\r\n“It is a strange weapon,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Aye, a strange and an old, forged far away, says Zikali, by a\r\nwarrior-wizard hundreds of years ago, a great fighter who was also the\r\nfirst of smiths and who sits in the Under-world waiting for it to\r\nreturn to his hand when its work is finished beneath the sun. That will\r\nbe soon, Macumazahn, since Zikali told me that I am the last Holder of\r\nthe Axe.”\r\n\r\n“Did you then see the Opener-of-Roads?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Aye, I saw him. He it was who told me which way to go to escape from\r\nZululand. Also he laughed when he heard how the flooded rivers brought\r\nyou to my kraal, and sent you a message in which he said that the\r\nspirit of a snake had told him that you tried to throw the Great\r\nMedicine into a pool, but were stopped by that snake, whilst it was\r\nstill alive. This, he said, you must do no more, lest he should send\r\nanother snake to stop _you_.”\r\n\r\n“Did he?” I replied indignantly, for Zikali’s power of seeing or\r\nlearning about things that happened at a distance puzzled and annoyed\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOnly Hans grinned and said,\r\n\r\n“I told you so, Baas.”\r\n\r\nOn we travelled from day to day, meeting with such difficulties and\r\ndangers as are common on roadless veld in Africa, but no more, for the\r\ngrass was good and there was plenty of game, of which we shot what we\r\nwanted for meat. Indeed, here in the back regions of what is known as\r\nPortuguese South East Africa, every sort of wild animal was so numerous\r\nthat personally I wished we could turn our journey into a shooting\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nBut of this Umslopogaas, whom hunting bored, would not hear. In fact,\r\nhe was much more anxious than myself to carry out our original purpose.\r\nWhen I asked him why, he answered because of something Zikali had told\r\nhim. What this was he would not say, except that in the country whither\r\nwe wandered he would fight a great fight and win much honour.\r\n\r\nNow Umslopogaas was by nature a fighting man, one who took a positive\r\njoy in battle, and like an old Norseman, seemed to think that thus only\r\ncould a man decorously die. This amazed me, a peaceful person who loves\r\nquiet and a home. Still, I gave way, partly to please him, partly\r\nbecause I hoped that we might discover something of interest, and still\r\nmore because, having once undertaken an enterprise, my pride prompted\r\nme to see it through.\r\n\r\nNow while he was preparing to draw his map in the ashes, or afterwards,\r\nI forget which, Zikali had told me that when we drew near to the great\r\nriver we should come to a place on the edge of bush-veld that ran down\r\nto the river, where a white man lived, adding, after casting his bones\r\nand reading from them, that he thought this white man was a\r\n“trek-Boer.” This, I should explain, means a Dutchman who has travelled\r\naway from wherever he lived and made a home for himself in the\r\nwilderness, as some wandering spirit and the desire to be free of\r\nauthority often prompt these people to do. Also, after another\r\ninspection of his enchanted knuckle-bones, he had declared that\r\nsomething remarkable would happen to this man or his family, while I\r\nwas visiting him. Lastly in that map he drew in the ashes, the details\r\nof which were impressed so indelibly upon my memory, he had shown me\r\nwhere I should find the dwelling of this white man, of whom and of\r\nwhose habitation doubtless he knew through the many spies who seemed to\r\nbe at the service of all witch-doctors, and more especially of Zikali,\r\nthe greatest among them.\r\n\r\nTravelling by the sun and the compass I had trekked steadily in the\r\nexact direction which he indicated, to find that in this useful\r\nparticular he was well named the “Opener-of-Roads,” since always before\r\nme I found a practicable path, although to the right or to the left\r\nthere would have been none. Thus when we came to mountains, it was at a\r\nspot where we discovered a pass; when we came to swamps it was where a\r\nridge of high ground ran between, and so forth. Also such tribes as we\r\nmet upon our journey always proved of a friendly character, although\r\nperhaps the aspect of Umslopogaas and his fierce band whom, rather\r\nirreverently, I named his twelve Apostles, had a share in inducing this\r\npeaceful attitude.\r\n\r\nSo smooth was our progress and so well marked by water at certain\r\nintervals, that at last I came to the conclusion that we must be\r\nfollowing some ancient road which at a forgotten period of history, had\r\nrun from south to north, or _vice versâ_. Or rather, to be honest, it\r\nwas the observant Hans who made this discovery from various indications\r\nwhich had escaped my notice. I need not stop to detail them, but one of\r\nthese was that at certain places the water-holes on a high, rather\r\nbarren land had been dug out, and in one or more instances, lined with\r\nstones after the fashion of an ancient well. Evidently we were\r\nfollowing an old trade route made, perhaps, in forgotten ages when\r\nAfrica was more civilised than it is now.\r\n\r\nPassing over certain high, misty lands during the third week of our\r\ntrek, where frequently at this season of the year the sun never showed\r\nitself before ten o’clock and disappeared at three or four in the\r\nafternoon, and where twice we were held up for two whole days by dense\r\nfog, we came across a queer nomadic people who seemed to live in\r\nmovable grass huts and to keep great herds of goats and long-tailed\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nThese folk ran away from us at first, but when they found that we did\r\nthem no harm, became friendly and brought us offerings of milk, also of\r\na kind of slug or caterpillar which they seemed to eat. Hans, who was a\r\ngreat master of different native dialects, discovered a tongue, or a\r\nmixture of tongues, in which he could make himself understood to some\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThey told him that in their day they had never seen a white man,\r\nalthough their fathers’ fathers (an expression by which they meant\r\ntheir remote ancestors) had known many of them. They added, however,\r\nthat if we went on steadily towards the north for another seven days’\r\njourney, we should come to a place where a white man lived, one, they\r\nhad heard, who had a long beard and killed animals with guns, as we\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this intelligence we pushed forward, now travelling down\r\nhill out of the mists into a more genial country. Indeed, the veld here\r\nwas beautiful, high, rolling plains like those of the East African\r\nplateau, covered with a deep and fertile chocolate-coloured soil, as we\r\ncould see where the rains had washed out dongas. The climate, too,\r\nseemed to be cool and very healthful. Altogether it was a pity to see\r\nsuch lands lying idle and tenanted only by countless herds of game, for\r\nthere were not any native inhabitants, or at least we met none.\r\n\r\nOn we trekked, our road still sloping slightly down hill, till at\r\nlength we saw far away a vast sea of bush-veld which, as I guessed\r\ncorrectly, must fringe the great Zambesi River. Moreover we, or rather\r\nHans, whose eyes were those of a hawk, saw something else, namely\r\nbuildings of a more or less civilised kind, which stood among trees by\r\nthe side of a stream several miles on this side of the great belt of\r\nbush.\r\n\r\n“Look, Baas,” said Hans, “those wanderers did not lie; there is the\r\nhouse of the white man. I wonder if he drinks anything stronger than\r\nwater,” he added with a sigh and a kind of reminiscent contraction of\r\nhis yellow throat.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nINEZ\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had sighted the house from far away shortly after sunrise and by\r\nmidday we were there. As we approached I saw that it stood almost\r\nimmediately beneath two great baobab trees, babyan trees we call them\r\nin South Africa, perhaps because monkeys eat their fruit. It was a\r\nthatched house with whitewashed walls and a stoep or veranda round it,\r\napparently of the ordinary Dutch type. Moreover, beyond it, at a little\r\ndistance were other houses or rather shanties with waggon sheds, etc.,\r\nand beyond and mixed up with these a number of native huts. Further on\r\nwere considerable fields green with springing corn; also we saw herds\r\nof cattle grazing on the slopes. Evidently our white man was rich.\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas surveyed the place with a soldier’s eye and said to me,\r\n\r\n“This must be a peaceful country, Macumazahn, where no attack is\r\nfeared, since of defences I see none.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “why not, with a wilderness behind it and bush-veld\r\nand a great river in front?”\r\n\r\n“Men can cross rivers and travel through bush-veld,” he answered, and\r\nwas silent.\r\n\r\nUp to this time we had seen no one, although it might have been\r\npresumed that a waggon trekking towards the house was a sufficiently\r\nunusual sight to have attracted attention.\r\n\r\n“Where can they be?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Asleep, Baas, I think,” said Hans, and as a matter of fact he was\r\nright. The whole population of the place was indulging in a noonday\r\nsiesta.\r\n\r\nAt last we came so near to the house that I halted the waggon and\r\ndescended from the driving-box in order to investigate. At this moment\r\nsomeone did appear, the sight of whom astonished me not a little,\r\nnamely, a very striking-looking young woman. She was tall, handsome,\r\nwith large dark eyes, good features, a rather pale complexion, and I\r\nthink the saddest face that I ever saw. Evidently she had heard the\r\nnoise of the waggon and had come out to see what caused it, for she had\r\nnothing on her head, which was covered with thick hair of a raven\r\nblackness. Catching sight of the great Umslopogaas with his gleaming\r\naxe and of his savage-looking bodyguard, she uttered an exclamation and\r\nnot unnaturally turned to fly.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” I sang out, emerging from behind the oxen, and in\r\nEnglish, though before the words had left my lips I reflected that\r\nthere was not the slightest reason to suppose that she would understand\r\nthem. Probably she was Dutch, or Portuguese, although by some instinct\r\nI had addressed her in English.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise she answered me in the same tongue, spoken, it is true,\r\nwith a peculiar accent which I could not place, as it was neither\r\nScotch nor Irish.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she said. “I, sir, was frightened. Your friends look——”\r\nHere she stumbled for a word, then added, “terrocious.”\r\n\r\nI laughed at this composite adjective and answered,\r\n\r\n“Well, so they are in a way, though they will not harm you or me. But,\r\nyoung lady, tell me, can we outspan here? Perhaps your husband——”\r\n\r\n“I have no husband, I have only a father, sir,” and she sighed.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, could I speak to your father? My name is Allan Quatermain\r\nand I am making a journey of exploration, to find out about the country\r\nbeyond, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will go to wake him. He is asleep. Everyone sleeps here at\r\nmidday—except me,” she said with another sigh.\r\n\r\n“Why do you not follow their example?” I asked jocosely, for this young\r\nwoman puzzled me and I wanted to find out about her.\r\n\r\n“Because I sleep little, sir, who think too much. There will be plenty\r\nof time to sleep soon for all of us, will there not?”\r\n\r\nI stared at her and inquired her name, because I did not know what else\r\nto say.\r\n\r\n“My name is Inez Robertson,” she answered. “I will go to wake my\r\nfather. Meanwhile please unyoke your oxen. They can feed with the\r\nothers; they look as though they wanted rest, poor things.” Then she\r\nturned and went into the house.\r\n\r\n“Inez Robertson,” I said to myself, “that’s a queer combination.\r\nEnglish father and Portuguese mother, I suppose. But what can an\r\nEnglishman be doing in a place like this? If it had been a trek-Boer I\r\nshould not have been surprised.” Then I began to give directions about\r\nout-spanning.\r\n\r\nWe had just got the oxen out of the yokes, when a big, raw-boned,\r\nred-bearded, blue-eyed, roughly-clad man of about fifty years of age\r\nappeared from the house, yawning. I threw my eye over him as he\r\nadvanced with a peculiar rolling gait, and formed certain conclusions.\r\nA drunkard who has once been a gentleman, I reflected to myself, for\r\nthere was something peculiarly dissolute in his appearance, also one\r\nwho has had to do with the sea, a diagnosis which proved very accurate.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Allan Quatermain, which I think my daughter said is\r\nyour name, unless I dreamed it, for it is one that I seem to have heard\r\nbefore,” he exclaimed with a broad Scotch accent which I do not attempt\r\nto reproduce. “What in the name of blazes brings you here where no real\r\nwhite man has been for years? Well, I am glad enough to see you any\r\nway, for I am sick of half-breed Portuguese and niggers, and\r\nsnuff-and-butter girls, and gin and bad whisky. Leave your people to\r\nattend to those oxen and come in and have a drink.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mr. Robertson——”\r\n\r\n“Captain Robertson,” he interrupted. “Man, don’t look astonished. You\r\nmightn’t guess it, but I commanded a mail-steamer once and should like\r\nto hear myself called rightly again before I die.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon—Captain Robertson, but myself, I don’t drink\r\nanything before sundown. However, if you have something to eat——?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, Inez—she’s my daughter—will find you a bite. Those men of\r\nyours,” and he also looked doubtfully at Umslopogaas and his savage\r\ncompany, “will want food as well. I’ll have a beast killed for them;\r\nthey look as if they could eat it, horns and all. Where are my people?\r\nAll asleep, I suppose, the lazy lubbers. Wait a bit, I’ll wake them\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nGoing to the house he snatched a great sjambok cut from hippopotamus\r\nhide, from where it hung on a nail in the wall, and ran towards the\r\ngroup of huts which I have mentioned, roaring out the name Thomaso,\r\nalso a string of oaths such as seamen use, mixed with others of a\r\nPortuguese variety. What happened there I could not see because boughs\r\nwere in the way, but presently I heard blows and screams, and caught\r\nsight of people, all dark-skinned, flying from the huts.\r\n\r\nA little later a fat, half-breed man—I should say from his curling hair\r\nthat his mother was a negress and his father a Portuguese—appeared with\r\nsome other nondescript fellows and began to give directions in a\r\ncompetent fashion about our oxen, also as to the killing of a calf. He\r\nspoke in bastard Portuguese, which I could understand, and I heard him\r\ntalk of Umslopogaas to whom he pointed, as “that nigger,” after the\r\nfashion of such cross-bred people who choose to consider themselves\r\nwhite men. Also he made uncomplimentary remarks about Hans, who of\r\ncourse understood every word he said. Evidently Thomaso’s temper had\r\nbeen ruffled by this sudden and violent disturbance of his nap.\r\n\r\nJust then our host appeared puffing with his exertions and declaring\r\nthat he had stirred up the swine with a vengeance, in proof of which he\r\npointed to the sjambok that was reddened with blood.\r\n\r\n“Captain Robertson,” I said, “I wish to give you a hint to be passed on\r\nto Mr. Thomaso, if that is he. He spoke of the Zulu soldier there as a\r\nnigger, etc. Well, he is a chief of a high rank and rather a terrible\r\nfellow if roused. Therefore I recommend Mr. Thomaso not to let him\r\nunderstand that he is insulting him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! that’s the way of these ‘snuff-and-butters’ one of whose\r\ngrandmothers once met a white man,” replied the Captain, laughing, “but\r\nI’ll tell him,” and he did in Portuguese.\r\n\r\nHis retainer listened in silence, looking at Umslopogaas rather\r\nsulkily. Then we walked into the house. As we went the Captain said,\r\n\r\n“Señor Thomaso—he calls himself Señor—is my manager here and a clever\r\nman, honest too in his way and attached to me, perhaps because I saved\r\nhis life once. But he has a nasty temper, as have all these\r\ncross-breeds, so I hope he won’t get wrong with that native who carries\r\na big axe.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so too, for his own sake,” I replied emphatically.\r\n\r\nThe Captain led the way into the sitting-room; there was but one in the\r\nhouse. It proved a queer kind of place with rude furniture seated with\r\nstrips of hide after the Boer fashion, and yet bearing a certain air of\r\nrefinement which was doubtless due to Inez, who, with the assistance of\r\na stout native girl, was already engaged in setting the table. Thus\r\nthere was a shelf with books, Shakespeare was one of these, I\r\nnoticed—over which hung an ivory crucifix, which suggested that Inez\r\nwas a Catholic. On the walls, too, were some good portraits, and on the\r\nwindow-ledge a jar full of flowers. Also the forks and spoons were of\r\nsilver, as were the mugs, and engraved with a tremendous coat-of-arms\r\nand a Portuguese motto.\r\n\r\nPresently the food appeared, which was excellent and plentiful, and the\r\nCaptain, his daughter and I sat down and ate. I noted that he drank gin\r\nand water, an innocent-looking beverage but strong as he took it. It\r\nwas offered to me, but like Miss Inez, I preferred coffee.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal and afterwards while we smoked upon the veranda, I told\r\nthem as much as I thought desirable of my plans. I said that I was\r\nengaged upon a journey of exploration of the country beyond the\r\nZambesi, and that having heard of this settlement, which, by the way,\r\nwas called Strathmuir, as I gathered after a place in far away Scotland\r\nwhere the Captain had been born and passed his childhood, I had come\r\nhere to inquire as to how to cross the great river, and about other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was interested, especially when I informed him that I was\r\nthat same “Hunter Quatermain” of whom he had heard in past years, but\r\nhe told me that it would be impossible to take the waggon down into the\r\nlow bush-veld which we could see beneath us, as there all the oxen\r\nwould die of the bite of the tsetse fly. I answered that I was aware of\r\nthis and proposed to try to make an arrangement to leave it in his\r\ncharge till I returned.\r\n\r\n“That might be managed, Mr. Quatermain,” he answered. “But, man, will\r\nyou ever return? They say there are queer folk living on the other side\r\nof the Zambesi, savage men who are cannibals, Amahagger I think they\r\ncall them. It was they who in past years cleaned out all this country,\r\nexcept a few river tribes who live in floating huts or on islands among\r\nthe reeds, and that’s why it is so empty. But this happened long ago,\r\nmuch before my time, and I don’t suppose they will ever cross the river\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“If I might ask, what brought you here, Captain?” I said, for the point\r\nwas one on which I felt curious.\r\n\r\n“That which brings most men to wild places, Mr. Quatermain—trouble. If\r\nyou want to know, I had a misfortune and piled up my ship. There were\r\nsome lives lost and, rightly or wrongly, I got the sack. Then I started\r\nas a trader in a God-forsaken hole named Chinde, one of the Zambesi\r\nmouths, you know, and did very well, as we Scotchmen have a way of\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n“There I married a Portuguese lady, a real lady of high blood, one of\r\nthe old sort. When my girl, Inez, was about twelve years old I got into\r\nmore trouble, for my wife died and it pleased a certain relative of\r\nhers to say that it was because I had neglected her. This ended in a\r\nrow and the truth is that I killed him—in fair fight, mind you. Still,\r\nkill him I did though I scarcely knew that I had done it at the time,\r\nafter which the place grew too hot to hold me. So I sold up and swore\r\nthat I would have no more to do with what they are pleased to call\r\ncivilisation on the East Coast.\r\n\r\n“During my trading I had heard that there was fine country up this way,\r\nand here I came and settled years ago, bringing my girl and Thomaso,\r\nwho was one of my managers, also a few other people with me. And here I\r\nhave been ever since, doing very well as before, for I trade a lot of\r\nivory and other things and grow stuff and cattle, which I sell to the\r\nRiver natives. Yes, I am a rich man now and could go to live on my\r\nmeans in Scotland, or anywhere.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh! for many reasons. I have lost touch with all that and become half\r\nwild and I like this life and the sunshine and being my own master.\r\nAlso, if I did, things might be raked up against me, about that man’s\r\ndeath. Also, though I daresay it will make you think badly of me for\r\nit, Mr. Quatermain, I have ties down there,” and he waved his hand\r\ntowards the village, if so it could be called, “which it wouldn’t be\r\neasy for me to break. A man may be fond of his children, Mr.\r\nQuatermain, even if their skins ain’t so white as they ought to be.\r\nLastly I have habits—you see, I am speaking out to you as man to\r\nman—which might get me into trouble again if I went back to the world,”\r\nand he nodded his fine, capable-looking head in the direction of the\r\nbottle on the table.\r\n\r\n“I see,” I said hastily, for this kind of confession bursting out of\r\nthe man’s lonely heart when what he had drunk took a hold of him, was\r\npainful to hear. “But how about your daughter, Miss Inez?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he said, with a quiver in his voice, “there you touch it. She\r\nought to go away. There is no one for her to marry here, where we\r\nhaven’t seen a white man for years, and she’s a lady right enough, like\r\nher mother. But who is she to go to, being a Roman Catholic whom my own\r\ndour Presbyterian folk in Scotland, if any of them are left, would turn\r\ntheir backs on? Moreover, she loves me in her own fashion, as I love\r\nher, and she wouldn’t leave me because she thinks it her duty to stay\r\nand knows that if she did, I should go to the devil altogether.\r\nStill—perhaps you might help me about her, Mr. Quatermain, that is if\r\nyou live to come back from your journey,” he added doubtfully.\r\n\r\nI felt inclined to ask how I could possibly help in such a matter, but\r\nthought it wisest to say nothing. This, however, he did not notice, for\r\nhe went on,\r\n\r\n“Now I think I will have a nap, as I do my work in the early morning,\r\nand sometimes late at night when my brain seems to clear up again, for\r\nyou see I was a sailor for many years and accustomed to keeping\r\nwatches. You’ll look after yourself, won’t you, and treat the place as\r\nyour own?” Then he vanished into the house to lie down.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished my pipe I went for a walk. First I visited the\r\nwaggon where I found Umslopogaas and his company engaged in cooking the\r\nbeast that had been given them, Zulu fashion; Hans with his usual\r\ncunning had already secured a meal, probably from the servants, or from\r\nInez herself; at least he left them and followed me. First we went down\r\nto the huts, where we saw a number of good-looking young women of mixed\r\nblood, all decently dressed and engaged about their household duties.\r\nAlso we saw four or five boys and girls, to say nothing of a baby in\r\narms, fine young people, one or two of whom were more white than\r\ncoloured.\r\n\r\n“Those children are very like the Baas with the red beard,” remarked\r\nHans reflectively.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, and shivered, for now I understood the awfulness of this\r\npoor man’s case. He was the father of a number of half-breeds who tied\r\nhim to this spot as anchors tie a ship. I went on rather hastily past\r\nsome sheds to a long, low building which proved to be a store. Here the\r\nquarter-blood called Thomaso, and some assistants were engaged in\r\ntrading with natives from the Zambesi swamps, men of a kind that I had\r\nnever seen, but in a way more civilised than many further south. What\r\nthey were selling or buying, I did not stop to see, but I noticed that\r\nthe store was full of goods of one sort or another, including a great\r\ndeal of ivory, which, as I supposed, had come down the river from\r\ninland.\r\n\r\nThen we walked on to the cultivated fields where we saw corn growing\r\nvery well, also tobacco and other crops. Beyond this were cattle kraals\r\nand in the distance we perceived a great number of cattle and goats\r\nfeeding on the slopes.\r\n\r\n“This red-bearded Baas must be very rich in all things,” remarked the\r\nobservant Hans when we had completed our investigations.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “rich and yet poor.”\r\n\r\n“How can a man be both rich and yet poor, Baas?” asked Hans.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment some of the half-breed children whom I have\r\nmentioned, ran past us more naked than dressed and whooping like little\r\nsavages. Hans contemplated them gravely, then said,\r\n\r\n“I think I understand now, Baas. A man may be rich in things he loves\r\nand yet does not want, which makes him poor in other ways.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “as _you_ are, Hans, when you take too much to\r\ndrink.”\r\n\r\nJust then we met the stately Miss Inez returning from the store,\r\ncarrying some articles in a basket, soap, I think, and tea in a packet,\r\namongst them. I told Hans to take the basket and bear it to the house\r\nfor her. He went off with it and, walking slowly, we fell into\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Your father must do very well here,” I said, nodding at the store with\r\nthe crowd of natives round it.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered, “he makes much money which he puts in a bank at\r\nthe coast, for living costs us nothing and there is great profit in\r\nwhat he buys and sells, also in the crops he grows and in the cattle.\r\nBut,” she added pathetically, “what is the use of money in a place like\r\nthis?”\r\n\r\n“You can get things with it,” I answered vaguely.\r\n\r\n“That is what my father says, but what does he get? Strong stuff to\r\ndrink; dresses for those women down there, and sometimes pearls, jewels\r\nand other things for me which I do not want. I have a box full of them\r\nset in ugly gold, or loose which I cannot use, and if I put them on,\r\nwho is there to see them? That clever half-breed, Thomaso—for he is\r\nclever in his way, faithful too—or the women down there—no one else.”\r\n\r\n“You do not seem to be happy, Miss Inez.”\r\n\r\n“No. I cannot tell how unhappy others are, who have met none, but\r\nsometimes I think that I must be the most miserable woman in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no,” I replied cheerfully, “plenty are worse off.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Mr. Quatermain, it must be because they cannot feel. Did you\r\never have a father whom you loved?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Miss Inez. He is dead, but he was a very good man, a kind of\r\nsaint. Ask my servant, the little Hottentot Hans; he will tell you\r\nabout him.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! a very good man. Well, as you may have guessed, mine is not,\r\nthough there is much good in him, for he has a kind heart, and a big\r\nbrain. But the drink and those women down there, they ruin him,” and\r\nshe wrung her hands.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you go away?” I blurted out.\r\n\r\n“Because it is my duty to stop. That is what my religion teaches me,\r\nalthough of it I know little except through books, who have seen no\r\npriest for years except one who was a missionary, a Baptist, I think,\r\nwho told me that my faith was false and would lead me to hell. Yes, not\r\nunderstanding how I lived, he said that, who did not know that hell is\r\nhere. No, I cannot go, who hopes always that still God and the Saints\r\nwill show me how to save my father, even though it be with my blood.\r\nAnd now I have said too much to you who are quite a stranger. Yet, I do\r\nnot know why, I feel that you will not betray me, and what is more,\r\nthat you will help me if you can, since you are not one of those who\r\ndrink, or——” and she waved her hand towards the huts.\r\n\r\n“I have my faults, Miss Inez,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Yes, no doubt, else you would be a saint, not a man, and even the\r\nsaints had their faults, or so I seem to remember, and became saints by\r\nrepentance and conquering them. Still, I am sure that you will help me\r\nif you can.”\r\n\r\nThen with a sudden flash of her dark eyes that said more than all her\r\nwords, she turned and left me.\r\n\r\nHere’s a pretty kettle of fish, thought I to myself as I strolled back\r\nto the waggon to see how things were going on there, and how to get the\r\nlive fish out of the kettle before they boil or spoil is more than I\r\nknow. I wonder why fate is always finding me such jobs to do.\r\n\r\nEven as I thought thus a voice in my heart seemed to echo that poor\r\ngirl’s words—because it is your duty—and to add others to them—woe\r\nbetide him who neglects his duty. I was appointed to try to hook a few\r\nfish out of the vast kettle of human woe, and therefore I must go on\r\nhooking. Meanwhile this particular problem seemed beyond me. Perhaps\r\nFate would help, I reflected. As a matter of fact, in the end Fate did,\r\nif Fate is the right word to use in this connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE SEA-COW HUNT\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it had been my intention to push forward across the river at once,\r\nbut here luck, or our old friend, Fate, was against me. To begin with\r\nseveral of Umslopogaas’ men fell sick with a kind of stomach trouble,\r\narising no doubt from something they had eaten. This, however, was not\r\ntheir view, or that of Umslopogaas himself. It happened that one of\r\nthese men, Goroko by name, who practised as a witch-doctor in his\r\nlighter moments, naturally suspected that a spell had been cast upon\r\nthem, for such people see magic in everything.\r\n\r\nTherefore he organised a “smelling-out” at which Umslopogaas, who was\r\nas superstitious as the rest, assisted. So did Hans, although he called\r\nhimself a Christian, partly out of curiosity, for he was as curious as\r\na magpie, and partly from fear lest some implication should be brought\r\nagainst him in his absence. I saw the business going on from a little\r\ndistance, and, unseen myself, thought it well to keep an eye upon the\r\nproceedings in case anything untoward should occur. This I did with\r\nMiss Inez, who had never witnessed anything of the sort, as a\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThe circle, a small one, was formed in the usual fashion; Goroko rigged\r\nup in the best witch-doctor’s costume that he could improvise, duly\r\ncame under the influence of his “Spirit” and skipped about, waving a\r\nwildebeeste’s tail, and so forth.\r\n\r\nFinally to my horror he broke out of the ring, and running to a group\r\nof spectators from the village, switched Thomaso, who was standing\r\namong them with a lordly and contemptuous air, across the face with the\r\ngnu’s tail, shouting out that he was the wizard who had poisoned the\r\nbowels of the sick men. Thereon Thomaso, who although he could be\r\ninsolent, like most crossbreeds was not remarkable for courage, seeing\r\nthe stir that this announcement created amongst the fierce-faced Zulus\r\nand fearing developments, promptly bolted, none attempting to follow\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAfter this, just as I thought that everything was over and that the\r\ntime had come for me to speak a few earnest words to Umslopogaas,\r\npointing out that matters must go no further as regards Thomaso, whom I\r\nknew that he and his people hated, Goroko went back to the circle and\r\nwas seized with a new burst of inspiration.\r\n\r\nThrowing down his whisk, he lifted his arms above his head and stared\r\nat the heavens. Then he began to shout out something in a loud voice\r\nwhich I was too far off to catch. Whatever it may have been, evidently\r\nit frightened his hearers, as I could see from the expressions on their\r\nfaces. Even Umslopogaas was alarmed, for he let his axe fall for a\r\nmoment, rose as though to speak, then sat down again and covered his\r\neyes with his hands.\r\n\r\nIn a minute it was over; Goroko seemed to become normal, took some\r\nsnuff and as I guessed, after the usual fashion of these doctors, began\r\nto ask what he had been saying while the “Spirit” possessed him, which\r\nhe either had, or affected to have, forgotten. The circle, too, broke\r\nup and its members began to talk to each other in a subdued way, while\r\nUmslopogaas remained seated on the ground, brooding, and Hans slipped\r\naway in his snake-like fashion, doubtless in search of me.\r\n\r\n“What was it all about, Mr. Quatermain?” asked Inez.\r\n\r\n“Oh! a lot of nonsense,” I said. “I fancy that witch-doctor declared\r\nthat your friend Thomaso put something into those men’s food to make\r\nthem sick.”\r\n\r\n“I daresay that he did; it would be just like him, Mr. Quatermain, as I\r\nknow that he hates them, especially Umslopogaas, of whom I am very\r\nfond. He brought me some beautiful flowers this morning which he had\r\nfound somewhere, and made a long speech which I could not understand.”\r\n\r\nThe idea of Umslopogaas, that man of blood and iron, bringing flowers\r\nto a young lady, was so absurd that I broke out laughing and even the\r\nsad-faced Inez smiled. Then she left me to see about something and I\r\nwent to speak to Hans and asked him what had happened.\r\n\r\n“Something rather queer, I think, Baas,” he answered vacuously, “though\r\nI did not quite understand the last part. The doctor, Goroko, smelt out\r\nThomaso as the man who had made them sick, and though they will not\r\nkill him because we are guests here, those Zulus are very angry with\r\nThomaso and I think will beat him if they get a chance. But that is\r\nonly the small half of the stick,” and he paused.\r\n\r\n“What is the big half, then?” I asked with irritation.\r\n\r\n“Baas, the Spirit in Goroko——”\r\n\r\n“The jackass in Goroko, you mean,” I interrupted. “How can you, who are\r\na Christian, talk such rubbish about spirits? I only wish that my\r\nfather could hear you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Baas, your reverend father, the Predikant, is now wise enough to\r\nknow all about Spirits and that there are some who come into black\r\nwitch-doctors though they turn up their noses at white men and leave\r\nthem alone. However, whatever it is that makes Goroko speak, got hold\r\nof him so that his lips said, though he remembered nothing of it\r\nafterwards, that soon this place would be red with blood—that there\r\nwould be a great killing here, Baas. That is all.”\r\n\r\n“Red with blood! Whose blood? What did the fool mean?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Baas, but what you call the jackass in Goroko, declared\r\nthat those who are ‘with the Great Medicine’—meaning what you wear,\r\nBaas—will be quite safe. So I hope that it will not be our blood; also\r\nthat you will get out of this place as soon as you can.”\r\n\r\nWell, I scolded Hans because he believed in what this doctor said, for\r\nI could see that he did believe it, then went to question Umslopogaas,\r\nwhom I found looking quite pleased, which annoyed me still more.\r\n\r\n“What is it that Goroko has been saying and why do you smile, Bulalio?”\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing much, Macumazahn, except that the man who looks like tallow\r\nthat has gone bad, put something in our food which made us sick, for\r\nwhich I would kill him were he not Red-beard’s servant and that it\r\nwould frighten the lady his daughter. Also he said that soon there will\r\nbe fighting, which is why I smiled, who grow weary of peace. We came\r\nout to fight, did we not?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” I answered. “We came out to make a quiet journey in\r\nstrange lands, which is what I mean to do.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! well, Macumazahn, in strange lands one meets strange men with whom\r\none does not always agree, and then _Inkosikaas_ begins to talk,” and\r\nhe whirled the great axe round his head, making the air whistle as it\r\nwas forced through the gouge at its back.\r\n\r\nI could get no more out of him, so having extracted a promise from him\r\nthat nothing should happen to Thomaso who, I pointed out, was probably\r\nquite unjustly accused, I went away.\r\n\r\nStill, the whole incident left a disagreeable impression on my mind,\r\nand I began to wish that we were safe across the Zambesi without more\r\ntrouble. But we could not start at once because two of the Zulus were\r\nstill not well enough to travel and there were many preparations to be\r\nmade about the loads, and so forth, since the waggon must be left\r\nbehind. Also, and this was another complication—Hans had a sore upon\r\nhis foot, resulting from the prick of a poisonous thorn, and it was\r\ndesirable that this should be quite healed before we marched.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that I was really glad when Captain Robertson\r\nsuggested that we should go down to a certain swamp formed, I gathered,\r\nby some small tributary of the Zambesi to take part in a kind of\r\nhippopotamus battue. It seemed that at this season of the year these\r\ngreat animals always frequented the place in numbers, also that by\r\nbarring a neck of deep water through which they gained it, they, or a\r\nproportion of them, could be cut off and killed.\r\n\r\nThis had been done once or twice in the past, though not of late,\r\nperhaps because Captain Robertson had lacked the energy to organise\r\nsuch a hunt. Now he wished to do so again, taking advantage of my\r\npresence, both because of the value of the hides of the sea-cows which\r\nwere cut up to be sent to the coast and sold as _sjamboks_ or whips,\r\nand because of the sport of the thing. Also I think he desired to show\r\nme that he was not altogether sunk in sloth and drink.\r\n\r\nI fell in with the idea readily enough, since in all my hunting life I\r\nhad never seen anything of the sort, especially as I was told that the\r\nexpedition would not take more than a week and I reckoned that the sick\r\nmen and Hans would not be fit to travel sooner. So great preparations\r\nwere made. The riverside natives, whose share of the spoil was to be\r\nthe carcases of the slain sea-cows, were summoned by hundreds and sent\r\noff to their appointed stations to beat the swamps at a signal given by\r\nthe firing of a great pile of reeds. Also many other things were done\r\nupon which I need not enter.\r\n\r\nThen came the time for us to depart to the appointed spot over twenty\r\nmiles away, most of which distance it seemed we could trek in the\r\nwaggon. Captain Robertson, who for the time had cut off his gin, was as\r\nactive about the affair as though he were once more in command of a\r\nmail-steamer. Nothing escaped his attention; indeed, in the care which\r\nhe gave to details he reminded me of the captain of a great ship that\r\nis leaving port, and from it I learned how able a man he must once have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\n“Does your daughter accompany us?” I asked on the night before we\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n“Oh! no,” he answered, “she would only be in the way. She will be quite\r\nsafe here, especially as Thomaso, who is no hunter, remains in charge\r\nof the place with some of the older natives to look after the women and\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\nLater I saw Inez herself, who said that she would have liked to come,\r\nalthough she hated to see great beasts killed, but that her father was\r\nagainst it because he thought she might catch fever. So she supposed\r\nthat she had better remain where she was.\r\n\r\nI agreed, though in my heart I was doubtful, and said that I would\r\nleave Hans, whose foot was not as yet quite well, and with whom she had\r\nmade friends as she had done with Umslopogaas, to look after her. Also\r\nthere would be with him the two great Zulus who were now recovering\r\nfrom their attack of stomach sickness, so that she would have nothing\r\nto fear. She answered with her slow smile that she feared nothing,\r\nstill, she would have liked to come with us. Then we parted, as it\r\nproved for a long time.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a ceremony. Umslopogaas, “in the name of the Axe” solemnly\r\ngave over Inez to the charge of his two followers, bidding them guard\r\nher with so much earnestness that I began to suspect he feared\r\nsomething which he did not choose to mention. My mind went back indeed\r\nto the prophecy of the witch-doctor Goroko, of which it was possible\r\nthat he might be thinking, but as while he spoke he kept his fierce\r\neyes fixed upon the fat and pompous quarter-breed, Thomaso, I concluded\r\nthat here was the object of his doubts.\r\n\r\nIt might have occurred to him that this Thomaso would take the\r\nopportunity of her father’s absence to annoy Inez. If so I was sure\r\nthat he was mistaken for various reasons, of which I need only quote\r\none, namely, that even if such an idea had ever entered his head,\r\nThomaso was far too great a coward to translate it into action. Still,\r\nsuspecting something, I also gave Hans instructions to keep a sharp eye\r\non Inez and generally to watch the place, and if he saw anything\r\nsuspicious, to communicate with us at once.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas,” said Hans, “I will look after ‘Sad-Eyes’”—for so with\r\ntheir usual quickness of observation our Zulus had named Inez—“as\r\nthough she were my grandmother, though what there is to fear for her, I\r\ndo not know. But, Baas, I would much rather come and look after you, as\r\nyour reverend father, the Predikant, told me to do always, which is my\r\nduty, not girl-herding, Baas. Also my foot is now quite well and—I want\r\nto shoot sea-cows, and——” Here he paused.\r\n\r\n“And what, Hans?”\r\n\r\n“And Goroko said that there was going to be much fighting and if there\r\nshould be fighting and you should come to harm because I was not there\r\nto protect you, what would your reverend father think of me then?”\r\n\r\nAll of which meant two things: that Hans never liked being separated\r\nfrom me if he could help it, and that he much preferred a shooting trip\r\nto stopping alone in this strange place with nothing to do except eat\r\nand sleep. So I concluded, though indeed I did not get quite to the\r\nbottom of the business. In reality Hans was putting up a most gallant\r\nstruggle against temptation.\r\n\r\nAs I found out afterwards, Captain Robertson had been giving him strong\r\ndrink on the sly, moved thereto by sympathy with a fellow toper. Also\r\nhe had shown him where, if he wanted it, he could get more, and Hans\r\nalways wanted gin very badly indeed. To leave it within his reach was\r\nlike leaving a handful of diamonds lying about in the room of a thief.\r\nThis he knew, but was ashamed to tell me the truth, and thence came\r\nmuch trouble.\r\n\r\n“You will stop here, Hans, look after the young lady and nurse your\r\nfoot,” I said sternly, whereon he collapsed with a sigh and asked for\r\nsome tobacco.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Captain Robertson, who I think had been taking a stirrup cup\r\nto cheer him on the road, was making his farewells down in what was\r\nknown as “the village,” for I saw him there kissing a collection of\r\nhalf-breed children, and giving Thomaso instructions to look after them\r\nand their mothers. Returning at length, he called to Inez, who remained\r\nupon the veranda, for she always seemed to shrink from her father after\r\nhis visits to the village, to “keep a stiff upper lip” and not feel\r\nlonely, and commanded the cavalcade to start.\r\n\r\nSo off we went, about twenty of the village natives, a motley crew\r\narmed with every kind of gun, marching ahead and singing songs. Then\r\ncame the waggon with Captain Robertson and myself seated on the\r\ndriving-box, and lastly Umslopogaas and his Zulus, except the two who\r\nhad been left behind.\r\n\r\nWe trekked along a kind of native road over fine veld of the same\r\ncharacter as that on which Strathmuir stood, having the lower-lying\r\nbush-veld which ran down to the Zambesi on our right. Before nightfall\r\nwe came to a ridge whereon this bush-veld turned south, fringing that\r\ntributary of the great river in the swamps of which we were to hunt for\r\nsea-cows. Here we camped and next morning, leaving the waggon in charge\r\nof my _voorlooper_ and a couple of the Strathmuir natives, for the\r\ndriver was to act as my gun-bearer—we marched down into the sea of\r\nbush-veld. It proved to be full of game, but at this we dared not fire\r\nfor fearing of disturbing the hippopotami in the swamps beneath, whence\r\nin that event they might escape us back to the river.\r\n\r\nAbout midday we passed out of the bush-veld and reached the place where\r\nthe drive was to be. Here, bordered by steep banks covered with bush,\r\nwas swampy ground not more than two hundred yards wide, down the centre\r\nof which ran a narrow channel of rather deep water, draining a vast\r\nexpanse of morass above. It was up this channel that the sea-cows\r\ntravelled to the feeding ground where they loved to collect at that\r\nseason of the year.\r\n\r\nThere with the assistance of some of the riverside natives we made our\r\npreparations under the direction of Captain Robertson. The rest of\r\nthese men, to the number of several hundreds, had made a wide détour to\r\nthe head of the swamps, miles away, whence they were to advance at a\r\ncertain signal. These preparations were simple. A quantity of thorn\r\ntrees were cut down and by means of heavy stones fastened to their\r\ntrunks, anchored in the narrow channel of deep water. To their tops,\r\nwhich floated on the placid surface, were tied a variety of rags which\r\nwe had brought with us, such as old red flannel shirts, gay-coloured\r\nbut worn-out blankets, and I know not what besides. Some of these\r\nfragments also were attached to the anchored ropes under water.\r\n\r\nAlso we selected places for the guns upon the steep banks that I have\r\nmentioned, between which this channel ran. Foreseeing what would\r\nhappen, I chose one for myself behind a particularly stout rock and\r\nwhat is more, built a stone wall to the height of several feet on the\r\nlandward side of it, as I guessed that the natives posted near to me\r\nwould prove wild in their shooting.\r\n\r\nThese labours occupied the rest of that day, and at night we retired to\r\nhigher ground to sleep. Before dawn on the following morning we\r\nreturned and took up our stations, some on one side of the channel and\r\nsome on the other which we had to reach in a canoe brought for the\r\npurpose by the river natives.\r\n\r\nThen, before the sun rose, Captain Robertson fired a huge pile of dried\r\nreeds and bushes, which was to give the signal to the river natives far\r\naway to begin their beat. This done, we sat down and waited, after\r\nmaking sure that every gun had plenty of ammunition ready.\r\n\r\nAs the dawn broke, by climbing a tree near my _schanze_ or shelter, I\r\nsaw a good many miles away to the south a wide circle of little fires,\r\nand guessed that the natives were beginning to burn the dry reeds of\r\nthe swamp. Presently these fires drew together into a thin wall of\r\nflame. Then I knew that it was time to return to the _schanze_ and\r\nprepare. It was full daylight, however, before anything happened.\r\n\r\nWatching the still channel of water, I saw ripples on it and bubbles of\r\nair rising. Suddenly there appeared the head of a great\r\nbull-hippopotamus which, having caught sight of our rag barricade,\r\neither above or below water, had risen to the surface to see what it\r\nmight be. I put a bullet from an eight-bore rifle through its brain,\r\nwhereon it sank, as I guessed, stone dead to the bottom of the channel,\r\nthus helping to increase the barricade by the bulk of its great body.\r\nAlso it had another effect. I have observed that sea-cows cannot bear\r\nthe smell and taint of blood, which frightens them horribly, so that\r\nthey will expose themselves to almost any risk, rather than get it into\r\ntheir nostrils.\r\n\r\nNow, in this still water where there was no perceptible current, the\r\nblood from the dead bull soon spread all about so that when the herd,\r\nfollowing their leader, began to arrive they were much alarmed. Indeed,\r\nthe first of them on winding or tasting it, turned and tried to get\r\nback up the channel where, however, they met others following, and\r\nthere ensued a tremendous confusion. They rose to the surface, blowing,\r\nsnorting, bellowing and scrambling over each other in the water, while\r\ncontinually more and more arrived behind them, till there was a perfect\r\npandemonium in that narrow place.\r\n\r\nAll our guns opened fire wildly upon the mass; it was like a battle and\r\nthrough the smoke I caught sight of the riverside natives who were\r\nacting as beaters, advancing far away, fantastically dressed, screaming\r\nwith excitement and waving spears, or sometimes torches of flaming\r\nreeds. Most of these were scrambling along the banks, but some of the\r\nbolder spirits advanced over the lagoon in canoes, driving the\r\nhippopotami towards the mouth of the channel by which alone they could\r\nescape into the great swamps below and so on to the river. In all my\r\nhunting experience I do not think I ever saw a more remarkable scene.\r\nStill, in a way, to me it was unpleasant, for I flatter myself that I\r\nam a sportsman and a battle of this sort is not sport as I understand\r\nthe term.\r\n\r\nAt length it came to this; the channel for quite a long way was\r\nliterally full of hippopotami—I should think there must have been a\r\nhundred of them or more of all sorts and sizes, from great bulls down\r\nto little calves. Some of these were killed, not many, for the shooting\r\nof our gallant company was execrable and almost at hazard. Also for\r\nevery sea-cow that died, of which number I think that Captain Robertson\r\nand myself accounted for most—many were only wounded.\r\n\r\nStill, the unhappy beasts, crazed with noise and fire and blood, did\r\nnot seem to dare to face our frail barricade, probably for the reason\r\nthat I have given. For a while they remained massed together in the\r\nwater, or under it, making a most horrible noise. Then of a sudden they\r\nseemed to take a resolution. A few of them broke back towards the\r\nburning reeds, the screaming beaters and the advancing canoes. One of\r\nthese, indeed, a wounded bull, charged a canoe, crushed it in its huge\r\njaws and killed the rower, how exactly I do not know, for his body was\r\nnever found. The majority of them, however, took another counsel, for\r\nemerging from the water on either side, they began to scramble towards\r\nus along the steep banks, or even to climb up them with surprising\r\nagility. It was at this point in the proceedings that I congratulated\r\nmyself earnestly upon the solid character of the water-worn rock which\r\nI had selected as a shelter.\r\n\r\nBehind this rock together with my gun-bearer and Umslopogaas, who, as\r\nhe did not shoot, had elected to be my companion, I crouched and banged\r\naway at the unwieldy creatures as they advanced. But fire fast as I\r\nmight with two rifles, I could not stop the half of them—they were\r\ndrawing unpleasantly near. I glanced at Umslopogaas and even then was\r\namused to see that probably for the first time in his life that\r\nredoubtable warrior was in a genuine fright.\r\n\r\n“This is madness, Macumazahn,” he shouted above the din. “Are we to\r\nstop here and be stamped flat by a horde of water-pigs?”\r\n\r\n“It seems so,” I answered, “unless you prefer to be stamped flat\r\noutside—or eaten,” I added, pointing to a great crocodile that had also\r\nemerged from the channel and was coming along towards us with open\r\njaws.\r\n\r\n“By the Axe!” shouted Umslopogaas again, “I—a warrior—will not die\r\nthus, trodden on like a slug by an ox.”\r\n\r\nNow I have mentioned a tree which I climbed. In his extremity\r\nUmslopogaas rushed for that tree and went up it like a lamplighter,\r\njust as the crocodile wriggled past its trunk, snapping at his\r\nretreating legs.\r\n\r\nAfter this I took no more note of him, partly because of the advancing\r\nsea-cows, and more for the reason that one of the village natives\r\nposted above me, firing wildly, put a large round bullet through the\r\nsleeve of my coat. Indeed, had it not been for the wall which I built\r\nthat protected us, I am certain that both my bearer and I would have\r\nbeen killed, for afterwards I found it splashed over with lead from\r\nbullets which had struck the stones.\r\n\r\nWell, thanks to the strength of my rock and to the wall, or as Hans\r\nsaid afterwards, to Zikali’s Great Medicine, we escaped unhurt. The\r\nrush went by me; indeed, I killed one sea-cow so close that the powder\r\nfrom the rifle actually burned its hide. But it did go by, leaving us\r\nuntouched. All, however, were not so fortunate, since of the village\r\nnatives two were trampled to death, while a third had his leg broken.\r\n\r\nAlso, and this was really amusing—a bewildered bull charging at full\r\nspeed, crashed into the trunk of Umslopogaas’ tree, and as it was not\r\nvery thick, snapped it in two. Down came the top in which the dignified\r\nchief was ensconced like a bird in a nest, though at that moment there\r\nwas precious little dignity about him. However, except for scratches he\r\nwas not hurt, as the hippopotamus had other business in urgent need of\r\nattention and did not stop to settle with him.\r\n\r\n“Such are the things which happen to a man who mixes himself up with\r\nmatters of which he knows nothing,” said Umslopogaas sententiously to\r\nme afterwards. But all the same he could never bear any allusion to\r\nthis tree-climbing episode in his martial career, which, as it\r\nhappened, had taken place in full view of his retainers, among whom it\r\nremained the greatest of jokes. Indeed, he wanted to kill a man, the\r\nwag of the party, who gave him a slang name which, being translated,\r\nmeans\r\n“_He-who-is-so-brave-that-he-dares-to-ride-a-water-horse-up-a-tree._ ”\r\n\r\nIt was all over at last, for which I thanked Providence devoutly. A\r\ngood many of the sea-cows were dead, I think twenty-one was our exact\r\nbag, but the majority of them had escaped in one way or another, many\r\nas I fear, wounded. I imagine that at the last the bulk of the herd\r\novercame its fears and swimming through our screen, passed away down\r\nthe channel. At any rate they were gone, and having ascertained that\r\nthere was nothing to be done for the man who had been trampled on my\r\nside of the channel, I crossed it in the canoe with the object of\r\nreturning quietly to our camp to rest.\r\n\r\nBut as yet there was to be no quiet for me, for there I found Captain\r\nRobertson, who I think had been refreshing himself out of a bottle and\r\nwas in a great state of excitement about a native who had been killed\r\nnear him who was a favourite of his, and another whose leg was broken.\r\nHe declared vehemently that the hippopotamus which had done this had\r\nbeen wounded and rushed into some bushes a few hundred yards away, and\r\nthat he meant to take vengeance upon it. Indeed, he was just setting\r\noff to do so.\r\n\r\nSeeing his agitated state I thought it wisest to follow him. What\r\nhappened need not be set out in detail. It is sufficient to say that he\r\nfound that hippopotamus and blazed both barrels at it in the bushes,\r\nhitting it, but not seriously. Out lumbered the creature with its mouth\r\nopen, wishing to escape. Robertson turned to fly as he was in its path,\r\nbut from one cause or another, tripped and fell down. Certainly he\r\nwould have been crushed beneath its huge feet had I not stepped in\r\nfront of him and sent two solid eight-bore bullets down that yawning\r\nthroat, killing it dead within three feet of where Robertson was trying\r\nto rise, and I may add, of myself.\r\n\r\nThis narrow escape sobered him, and I am bound to say that his\r\ngratitude was profuse.\r\n\r\n“You are a brave man,” he said, “and had it not been for you by now I\r\nshould be wherever bad people go. I’ll not forget it, Mr. Quatermain,\r\nand if ever you want anything that John Robertson can give, why, it’s\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I answered, being seized by an inspiration, “I do want\r\nsomething that you can give easily enough.”\r\n\r\n“Give it a name and it’s yours, half my place, if you like.”\r\n\r\n“I want,” I went on as I slipped new cartridges into the rifle, “I want\r\nyou to promise to give up drink for your daughter’s sake. That’s what\r\nnearly did for you just now, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Man, you ask a hard thing,” he said slowly. “But by God I’ll try for\r\nher sake and for yours too.”\r\n\r\nThen I went to help to set the leg of the injured man, which was all\r\nthe rest I got that morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE OATH\r\n\r\n\r\nWe spent three more days at that place. First it was necessary to allow\r\ntime to elapse before the gases which generated in their great bodies\r\ncaused those of the sea-cows which had been killed in the water, to\r\nfloat. Then they must be skinned and their thick hides cut into strips\r\nand pieces to be traded for _sjamboks_ or to make small native shields\r\nfor which some of the East Coast tribes will pay heavily.\r\n\r\nAll this took a long while, during which I amused, or disgusted myself\r\nin watching those river natives devouring the flesh of the beasts. The\r\nlean, what there was of it, they dried and smoked into a kind of\r\n“biltong,” but a great deal of the fat they ate at once. I had the\r\ncuriosity to weigh a lump which was given to one thin, hungry-looking\r\nfellow. It scaled quite twenty pounds. Within four hours he had eaten\r\nit to the last ounce and lay there, a distended and torpid log. What\r\nwould not we white people give for such a digestion!\r\n\r\nAt last all was over and we started homewards, the man with a broken\r\nleg being carried in a kind of litter. On the edge of the bush-veld we\r\nfound the waggon quite safe, also one of Captain Robertson’s that had\r\nfollowed us from Strathmuir in order to carry the expected load of\r\nhippopotamus’ hides and ivory. I asked my _voorlooper_ if anything had\r\nhappened during our absence. He answered nothing, but on the previous\r\nevening after dark, he had seen a glow in the direction of Strathmuir\r\nwhich lay on somewhat lower ground about twenty miles away, as though\r\nnumerous fires had been lighted there. It struck him so much, he added,\r\nthat he climbed a tree to observe it better. He did not think, however,\r\nthat any building had been burned there, as the glow was not strong\r\nenough for that.\r\n\r\nI suggested that it was caused by some grass fire or reed-burning, to\r\nwhich he replied indifferently that he did not think so as the line of\r\nthe glow was not sufficiently continuous.\r\n\r\nThere the matter ended, though I confess that the story made me\r\nanxious, for what exact reason I could not say. Umslopogaas also, who\r\nhad listened to it, for our talk was in Zulu, looked grave, but made no\r\nremark. But as since his tree-climbing experience he had been\r\nsingularly silent, of this I thought little.\r\n\r\nWe had trekked at a time which we calculated would bring us to\r\nStrathmuir about an hour before sundown, allowing for a short halt half\r\nway. As my oxen were got in more quickly than those of the other waggon\r\nafter this outspan, I was the first away, followed at a little distance\r\nby Umslopogaas, who preferred to walk with his Zulus. The truth was\r\nthat I could not get that story about the glow of fires out of my mind\r\nand was anxious to push on, which had caused me to hurry up the\r\ninspanning.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we had covered a couple of miles of the ten or twelve which\r\nstill lay between us and Strathmuir, when far off on the crest of one\r\nof the waves of the veld which much resembled those of the swelling sea\r\nfrozen while in motion, I saw a small figure approaching us at a rapid\r\ntrot. Somehow that figure suggested Hans to my mind, so much so that I\r\nfetched my glasses to examine it more closely. A short scrutiny through\r\nthem convinced me that Hans it was, Hans and no other, advancing at a\r\ngreat pace.\r\n\r\nFilled with uneasiness, I ordered the driver to flog up the oxen, with\r\nthe result that in a little over five minutes we met. Halting the\r\nwaggon, I leapt from the waggon-box and calling to Umslopogaas who had\r\nkept up with us at a slow, swinging trot, went to Hans, who, when he\r\nsaw me, stood still at a little distance, swinging his apology for a\r\nhat in his hand, as was his fashion when ashamed or perplexed.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Hans?” I asked when we were within speaking\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Baas, everything,” he answered, and I noticed that he kept his\r\neyes fixed upon the ground and that his lips twitched.\r\n\r\n“Speak, you fool, and in Zulu,” I said, for by now Umslopogaas had\r\njoined me.\r\n\r\n“Baas,” he answered in that tongue, “a terrible thing has come about at\r\nthe farm of Red-Beard yonder. Yesterday afternoon at the time when\r\npeople are in the habit of sleeping there till the sun grows less hot,\r\na body of great men with fierce faces who carried big spears—perhaps\r\nthere were fifty of them, Baas—crept up to the place through the long\r\ngrass and growing crops, and attacked it.”\r\n\r\n“Did you see them come?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, Baas. I was watching at a little distance as you bade me do and\r\nthe sun being hot, I shut my eyes to keep out the glare of it, so that\r\nI did not see them until they had passed me and heard the noise.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that you were asleep or drunk, Hans, but go on.”\r\n\r\n“Baas, I do not know,” he answered shamefacedly, “but after that I\r\nclimbed a tall tree with a kind of bush at the top of it” (I\r\nascertained afterwards that this was a sort of leafy-crowned palm),\r\n“and from it I saw everything without being seen.”\r\n\r\n“What did you see, Hans?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“I saw the big men run up and make a kind of circle round the village.\r\nThen they shouted, and the people in the village came out to see what\r\nwas the matter. Thomaso and some of the men caught sight of them first\r\nand ran away fast into the hillside at the back where the trees grow,\r\nbefore the circle was complete. Then the women and the children came\r\nout and the big men killed them with their spears—all, all!”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” I exclaimed. “And what happened at the house and to the\r\nlady?”\r\n\r\n“Baas, some of the men had surrounded that also and when she heard the\r\nnoise the lady Sad-Eyes came out on to the stoep and with her came the\r\ntwo Zulus of the Axe who had been left sick but were now quite\r\nrecovered. A number of the big men ran as though to take her, but the\r\ntwo Zulus made a great fight in front of the little steps to the stoep,\r\nhaving their backs protected by the stoep, and killed six of them\r\nbefore they themselves were killed. Also Sad-Eyes shot one with a\r\npistol she carried, and wounded another so that the spear fell out of\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n“Then the rest fell on her and tied her up, setting her in a chair on\r\nthe stoep where two remained to watch her. They did her no hurt, Baas;\r\nindeed, they seemed to treat her as gently as they could. Also they\r\nwent into the house and there they caught that tall fat yellow girl who\r\nalways smiles and is called Janee, she who waits upon the Lady\r\nSad-Eyes, and brought her out to her. I think they told her, Baas, that\r\nshe must look after her mistress and that if she tried to run away she\r\nwould be killed, for afterwards I saw Janee bring her food and other\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“And then, Hans?”\r\n\r\n“Then, Baas, most of the great men rested a while, though some of them\r\nwent through the store gathering such things as they liked, blankets,\r\nknives and iron cooking-pots, but they set fire to nothing, nor did\r\nthey try to catch the cattle. Also they took dry wood from the pile and\r\nlit big fires, eight or nine of them, and when the sun set they began\r\nto feast.”\r\n\r\n“What did they feast on, Hans, if they took no cattle?” I asked with a\r\nshiver, for I was afraid of I knew not what.\r\n\r\n“Baas,” answered Hans, turning his head away and looking at the ground,\r\n“they feasted on the children whom they had killed, also on some of the\r\nyoung women. These tall soldiers are men-eaters, Baas.”\r\n\r\nAt this horrible intelligence I turned faint and felt as though I was\r\ngoing to fall, but recovering myself, signed to him to go on with his\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n“They feasted quite nicely, Baas,” he continued, “making no noise. Then\r\nsome of them slept while others watched, and that went on all night. As\r\nsoon as it was dark, but before the moon rose, I slid down the tree and\r\ncrept round to the back of the house without being seen or heard, as I\r\ncan, Baas. I got into the house by the back door and crawled to the\r\nwindow of the sitting-room. It was open and peeping through I saw\r\nSad-Eyes still tied to the seat on the stoep not more than a pace away,\r\nwhile the girl Janee crouched on the floor at her feet—I think she was\r\nasleep or fainting.\r\n\r\n“I made a little noise, like a night-adder hissing, and kept on making\r\nit, till at last Sad-Eyes turned her head. Then I spoke in a very low\r\nwhisper, for fear lest I should wake the two guards who were dozing on\r\neither side of her wrapped in their blankets, saying, ‘It is I, Hans,\r\ncome to help you.’ ‘You cannot,’ she answered, also speaking very low.\r\n‘Get to your master and tell him and my father to follow. These men are\r\ncalled Amahagger and live far away across the river. They are going to\r\ntake me to their home, as I understand, to rule them, because they want\r\na white woman to be a queen over them who have always been ruled by a\r\ncertain white queen, against whom they have rebelled. I do not think\r\nthey mean to do me any harm, unless perhaps they want to marry me to\r\ntheir chief, but of this I am not sure from their talk which I\r\nunderstand badly. Now go, before they catch you.’\r\n\r\n“‘I think you might get away,’ I whispered back. ‘I will cut your\r\nbonds. When you are free, slip through the window and I will guide\r\nyou.’\r\n\r\n“‘Very well, try it,’ she said.\r\n\r\n“So I drew my knife and stretched out my arm. But then, Baas, I showed\r\nmyself a fool—if the Great Medicine had still been there I might have\r\nknown better. I forgot the starlight which shone upon the blade of the\r\nknife. That girl Janee came out of her sleep or swoon, lifted her head\r\nand saw the knife. She screamed once, then at a word from her mistress\r\nwas silent. But it was enough, for it woke up the guards who glared\r\nabout them and threatened Janee with their great spears, also they went\r\nto sleep no more, but began to talk together, though what they said I\r\ncould not hear, for I was hiding on the floor of the room. After this,\r\nknowing that I could do no good and might do harm and get myself\r\nkilled, I crept out of the house as I had crept in, and crawled back to\r\nmy tree.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you not come to me?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Because I still hoped I might be able to help Sad-Eyes, Baas. Also I\r\nwanted to see what happened, and I knew that I could not bring you here\r\nin time to be any good. Yet it is true I thought of coming though I did\r\nnot know the road.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you were right.”\r\n\r\n“At the first dawn,” continued Hans, “the great men who are called\r\nAmahagger rose and ate what was left over from the night before. Then\r\nthey gathered themselves together and went to the house. Here they\r\nfound a large chair, that seated with _rimpis_ in which the Baas\r\nRed-Beard sits, and lashed two poles to the chair. Beneath the chair\r\nthey tied the garments and other things of the Lady Sad-Eyes which they\r\nmade Janee gather as Sad-Eyes directed her. This done, very gently they\r\nsat Sad-Eyes herself in the chair, bowing while they made her fast.\r\nAfter this eight of them set the poles upon their shoulders, and they\r\nall went away at a trot, heading for the bush-veld, driving with them a\r\nherd of goats which they had stolen from the farm, and making Janee run\r\nby the chair. I saw everything, Baas, for they passed just beneath my\r\ntree. Then I came to seek you, following the outward spoor of the\r\nwaggons which I could not have done well at night. That is all, Baas.”\r\n\r\n“Hans,” I said, “you have been drinking and because of it the lady\r\nSad-Eyes is taken a prisoner by cannibals; for had you been awake and\r\nwatching, you might have seen them coming and saved her and the rest.\r\nStill, afterwards you did well, and for the rest you must answer to\r\nHeaven.”\r\n\r\n“I must tell your reverend father, the Predikant, Baas, that the white\r\nmaster, Red-Beard, gave me the liquor and it is rude not to do as a\r\ngreat white master does, and drink it up. I am sure he will understand,\r\nBaas,” said Hans abjectly.\r\n\r\nI thought to myself that it was true and that the spear which Robertson\r\ncast had fallen upon his own head, as the Zulus say, but I made no\r\nanswer, lacking time for argument.\r\n\r\n“Did you say,” asked Umslopogaas, speaking for the first time, “that my\r\nservants killed only six of these men-eaters?”\r\n\r\nHans nodded and answered, “Yes, six. I counted the bodies.”\r\n\r\n“It was ill done, they should have killed six each,” said Umslopogaas\r\nmoodily. “Well, they have left the more for us to finish,” and he\r\nfingered the great axe.\r\n\r\nJust then Captain Robertson arrived in his waggon, calling out\r\nanxiously to know what was the matter, for some premonition of evil\r\nseemed to have struck him. My heart sank at the sight of him, for how\r\nwas I to tell such a story to the father of the murdered children and\r\nof the abducted girl?\r\n\r\nIn the end I felt that I could not. Yes, I turned coward and saying\r\nthat I must fetch something out of the waggon, bolted into it, bidding\r\nHans go forward and repeat his tale. He obeyed unwillingly enough and\r\nlooking out between the curtains of the waggon tent I saw all that\r\nhappened, though I could not hear the words that passed.\r\n\r\nRobertson had halted the oxen and jumping from the waggon-box strode\r\nforward and met Hans, who began to speak with him, twitching his hat in\r\nhis hands. Gradually as the tale progressed, I saw the Captain’s face\r\nfreeze into a mask of horror. Then he began to argue and deny, then to\r\nweep—oh! it was a terrible sight to see that great man weeping over\r\nthose whom he had lost, and in such a fashion.\r\n\r\nAfter this a kind of blind rage seized him and I thought he was going\r\nto kill Hans, who was of the same opinion, for he ran away. Next he\r\nstaggered about, shaking his fists, cursing and shouting, till\r\npresently he fell of a heap and lay face downwards, beating his head\r\nagainst the ground and groaning.\r\n\r\nNow I went to him because I must.\r\n\r\nHe saw me coming and sat up.\r\n\r\n“That’s a pretty story, Quatermain, which this little yellow monkey has\r\nbeen gibbering at me. Man, do you understand what he says? He says that\r\nall those half-blood children of mine are dead, murdered by savages\r\nfrom over the Zambesi, yes, and eaten, too, with their mothers. Do you\r\ntake the point? Eaten like lambs. Those fires your man saw last night\r\nwere the fires on which they were cooked, my little _so-and-so_ and\r\n_so-and-so_,” and he mentioned half a dozen different names. “Yes,\r\ncooked, Quatermain. And that isn’t all of it, they have taken Inez too.\r\nThey didn’t eat her, but they have dragged her off a captive for God\r\nknows what reason. I couldn’t understand. The whole ship’s crew is\r\ngone, except the captain absent on leave and the first officer,\r\nThomaso, who deserted with some Lascar stokers, and left the women and\r\nchildren to their fate. My God, I’m going mad. I’m going mad! If you\r\nhave any mercy in you, give me something to drink.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” I said, “I will. Sit here and wait a minute.”\r\n\r\nThen I went to the waggon and poured out a stiff tot of spirits into\r\nwhich I put an amazing dose of bromide from a little medicine chest I\r\nalways carry with me, and thirty drops of chlorodyne on the top of it.\r\nAll this compound I mixed up with a little water and took it to him in\r\na tin cup so that he could not see the colour.\r\n\r\nHe drank it at a gulp and throwing the pannikin aside, sat down on the\r\nveld, groaning while the company watched him at a respectful distance,\r\nfor Hans had joined the others and his tale had spread like fire in\r\ndrought-parched grass.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the drugs began to take effect upon Robertson’s\r\ntortured nerves, for he rose and said quietly,\r\n\r\n“What now?”\r\n\r\n“Vengeance, or rather justice,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he exclaimed, “vengeance. I swear that I will be avenged, or\r\ndie—or both.”\r\n\r\nAgain I saw my opportunity and said, “You must swear more than that,\r\nRobertson. Only sober men can accomplish great things, for drink\r\ndestroys the judgment. If you wish to be avenged for the dead and to\r\nrescue the living, you must be sober, or I for one will not help you.”\r\n\r\n“Will you help me if I do, to the end, good or ill, Quatermain?” he\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“That’s as much as another’s oath,” he muttered. “Still, I will put my\r\nthought in words. I swear by God, by my mother—like these natives—and\r\nby my daughter born in honest marriage, that I will never touch another\r\ndrop of strong drink, until I have avenged those poor women and their\r\nlittle children, and rescued Inez from their murderers. If I do you may\r\nput a bullet through me.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” I said in an offhand fashion, though inwardly I\r\nglowed with pride at the success of my great idea, for at the time I\r\nthought it great, and went on,\r\n\r\n“Now let us get to business. The first thing to do is to trek to\r\nStrathmuir and make preparations; the next to start upon the trail.\r\nCome to sit on the waggon with me and tell me what guns and ammunition\r\nyou have got, for according to Hans those savages don’t seem to have\r\ntouched anything, except a few blankets and a herd of goats.”\r\n\r\nHe did as I asked, telling me all he could remember. Then he said,\r\n\r\n“It is a strange thing, but now I recall that about two years ago a\r\ngreat savage with a high nose, who talked a sort of Arabic which, like\r\nInez, I understand, having lived on the coast, turned up one day and\r\nsaid he wanted to trade. I asked him what in, and he answered that he\r\nwould like to buy some children. I told him that I was not a\r\nslave-dealer. Then he looked at Inez, who was moving about, and said\r\nthat he would like to buy her to be a wife for his Chief, and offered\r\nsome fabulous sum in ivory and in gold, which he said should be paid\r\nbefore she was taken away. I snatched his big spear from his hand,\r\nbroke it over his head and gave him the best hiding with its shaft that\r\nhe had ever heard of. Then I kicked him off the place. He limped away\r\nbut when he was out of reach, turned and called out that one day he\r\nwould come again with others and take her, meaning Inez, without\r\nleaving the price in ivory and gold. I ran for my gun, but when I got\r\nback he had gone and I never thought of the matter again from that day\r\nto this.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he kept his promise,” I said, but Robertson made no answer, for\r\nby this time that thundering dose of bromide and laudanum had taken\r\neffect on him and he had fallen asleep, of which I was glad, for I\r\nthought that this sleep would save his sanity, as I believe it did for\r\na while.\r\n\r\nWe reached Strathmuir towards sunset, too late to think of attempting\r\nthe pursuit that day. Indeed, during our trek, I had thought the matter\r\nout carefully and come to the conclusion that to try to do so would be\r\nuseless. We must rest and make preparations; also there was no hope of\r\nour overtaking these brutes who already had a clear twelve hours’\r\nstart, by a sudden spurt. They must be run down patiently by following\r\ntheir spoor, if indeed they could be run down at all before they\r\nvanished into the vast recesses of unknown Africa. The most we could do\r\nthis night was to get ready.\r\n\r\nCaptain Robertson was still sleeping when we passed the village and of\r\nthis I was heartily glad, since the remains of a cannibal feast are not\r\npleasant to behold, especially when they are——! Indeed, of these I\r\ndetermined to be rid at once, so slipping off the waggon with Hans and\r\nsome of the farm boys, for none of the Zulus would defile themselves by\r\ntouching such human remnants—I made up two of the smouldering fires,\r\nthe light of which the _voorlooper_ had seen upon the sky, and on to\r\nthem cast, or caused to be cast, those poor fragments. Also I told the\r\nfarm natives to dig a big grave and in it to place the other bodies and\r\ngenerally to remove the traces of murder.\r\n\r\nThen I went on to the house, and not too soon. Seeing the waggons\r\narrive and having made sure that the Amahagger were gone, Thomaso and\r\nthe other cowards emerged from their hiding-places and returned.\r\nUnfortunately for the former the first person he met was Umslopogaas,\r\nwho began to revile the fat half-breed in no measured terms, calling\r\nhim dog, coward, and other opprobrious names, such as deserter of women\r\nand children, and so forth—all of which someone translated.\r\n\r\nThomaso, an insolent person, tried to swagger the matter out, saying\r\nthat he had gone to get assistance. Infuriated at this lie, Umslopogaas\r\nleapt upon him with a roar and though he was a strong man, dealt with\r\nhim as a lion does with a buck. Lifting him from his feet, he hurled\r\nhim to the ground, then as he strove to rise and run, caught him again\r\nand as it seemed to me, was about to break his back across his knee.\r\nJust at this juncture I arrived.\r\n\r\n“Let the man go,” I shouted to him. “Is there not enough death here\r\nalready?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Umslopogaas, “I think there is. Best that this jackal\r\nshould live to eat his own shame,” and he cast Thomaso to the ground,\r\nwhere he lay groaning.\r\n\r\nRobertson, who was still asleep in the waggon, woke up at the noise,\r\nand descended from it, looking dazed. I got him to the house and in\r\ndoing so made my way past, or rather between the bodies of the two\r\nZulus and of the six men whom they had killed, also of him whom Inez\r\nhad shot. Those Zulus had made a splendid fight for they were covered\r\nwith wounds, all of them in front, as I found upon examination.\r\n\r\nHaving made Robertson lie down upon his bed, I took a good look at the\r\nslain Amahagger. They were magnificent men, all of them; tall, spare\r\nand shapely with very clear-cut features and rather frizzled hair. From\r\nthese characteristics, as well as the lightness of their colour, I\r\nconcluded that they were of a Semitic or Arab type, and that the\r\nadmixture of their blood with that of the Bantus was but slight, if\r\nindeed there were any at all. Their spears, of which one had been cut\r\nthrough by a blow of a Zulu’s axe, were long and broad, not unlike to\r\nthose used by the Masai, but of finer workmanship.\r\n\r\nBy this time the sun was setting and thoroughly tired by all that I had\r\ngone through, I went into the house to get something to eat, having\r\ntold Hans to find food and prepare a meal. As I sat down Robertson\r\njoined me and I made him also eat. His first impulse was to go to the\r\ncupboard and fetch the spirit bottle; indeed, he rose to do so.\r\n\r\n“Hans is making coffee,” I said warningly.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” he answered, “I forgot. Force of habit, you know.”\r\n\r\nHere I may state that never from that moment did I see him touch\r\nanother drop of liquor, not even when I drank my modest tot in front of\r\nhim. His triumph over temptation was splendid and complete, especially\r\nas the absence of his accustomed potations made him ill for some time\r\nand of course depressed his spirits, with painful results that were\r\napparent in due course.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the man became totally changed. He grew gloomy but\r\nresourceful, also full of patience. Only one idea obsessed him—to\r\nrescue his daughter and avenge the murder of his people; indeed, except\r\nhis sins, he thought of and found interest in nothing else. Moreover,\r\nhis iron constitution cast off all the effects of his past debauchery\r\nand he grew so strong that although I was pretty tough in those days,\r\nhe could out-tire me.\r\n\r\nTo return; I engaged him in conversation and with his help made a list\r\nof what we should require on our vendetta journey, all of which served\r\nto occupy his mind. Then I sent him to bed, saying that I would call\r\nhim before dawn, having first put a little more bromide into his third\r\ncup of coffee. After this I turned in and notwithstanding the sight of\r\nthose remains of the cannibal feast and the knowledge of the dead men\r\nwho lay outside my window, I slept like a top.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was the Captain who awakened me, not I the Captain, saying\r\nthat daylight was on the break and we had better be stirring. So we\r\nwent down to the Store, where I was thankful to find that everything\r\nhad been tidied up in accordance with my directions.\r\n\r\nOn our way Robertson asked me what had become of the remains, whereon I\r\npointed to the smouldering ashes of one of the great fires. He went to\r\nit and kneeling down, said a prayer in broad Scotch, doubtless one that\r\nhe had learned at his mother’s knee. Then he took some of the ashes\r\nfrom the edge of the pyre—for such it was—and threw them into the\r\nglowing embers where, as he knew, lay all that was left of those who\r\nhad sprung from him. Also he tossed others of them into the air, though\r\nwhat he meant by this I did not understand and never asked. Probably it\r\nwas some rite indicative of expiation or of revenge, or both, which he\r\nhad learned from the savages among whom he had lived so long.\r\n\r\nAfter this we went into the Store and with the help of some of the\r\nnatives, or half-breeds, who had accompanied us on the sea-cow\r\nexpedition, selected all the goods we wanted, which we sent to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAs we returned thither I saw Umslopogaas and his men engaged, with the\r\nusual Zulu ceremonies, in burying their two companions in a hole they\r\nhad made in the hillside. I noted, however, that they did not inter\r\ntheir war-axes or their throwing-spears with them as usual, probably\r\nbecause they thought that these might be needed. In place of them they\r\nput with the dead little models roughly shaped of bits of wood, which\r\nmodels they “killed” by first breaking them across.\r\n\r\nI lingered to watch the funeral and heard Goroko, the witch-doctor,\r\nmake a little speech.\r\n\r\n“O Father and Chief of the Axe,” he said, addressing Umslopogaas, who\r\nstood silent leaning on his weapon and watching all, a portentous\r\nfigure in the morning mist, “O Father, O Son of the Heavens” (this was\r\nan allusion to the royal blood of Umslopogaas of which the secret was\r\nwell known, although it would never have been spoken aloud in\r\nZululand), “O Slaughterer (Bulalio), O Woodpecker who picks at the\r\nhearts of men; O King-Slayer; O Conqueror of the Halakazi; O Victor in\r\na hundred fights; O Gatherer of the Lily-bloom that faded in the hand;\r\nO Wolf-man, Captain of the Wolves that ravened; O Slayer of Faku; O\r\nGreat One whom it pleases to seem small, because he must follow his\r\nblood to the end appointed——”\r\n\r\nThis was the opening of the speech, the “_bonga_-ing” or giving of\r\nTitles of Praise to the person addressed, of which I have quoted but a\r\nsample, for there were many more of them that I have forgotten. Then\r\nthe speaker went on,\r\n\r\n“It was told to me, though of it I remember nothing, that when my\r\nSpirit was in me a while ago I prophesied that this place would flow\r\nwith blood, and lo! the blood has flowed, and with it that of these our\r\nbrothers,” and he gave the names of the two dead Zulus, also those of\r\ntheir forefathers for several generations.\r\n\r\n“It seems, Father, that they died well, as you would have wished them\r\nto die, and as doubtless they desired to die themselves, leaving a tale\r\nbehind them, though it is true that they might have died better,\r\nkilling more of the men-eaters, as it is certain they would have done,\r\nhad they not been sick inside. They are finished; they have gone beyond\r\nto await us in the Under-world among the ghosts. Their story is told\r\nand soon to their children they will be but names whispered in honour\r\nafter the sun has set. Enough of them who have showed us how to die as\r\nour fathers did before them.”\r\n\r\nGoroko paused a while, then added with a waving of his hands,\r\n\r\n“My Spirit comes to me again and I know that these our brothers shall\r\nnot pass unavenged. Chief of the Axe, great glory awaits the Axe, for\r\nit shall feed full. I have spoken.”\r\n\r\n“Good words!” grunted Umslopogaas. Then he saluted the dead by raising\r\n_Inkosikaas_ and came to me to consult about our journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nPURSUIT\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all we did not get away much before noon, because first there was\r\na great deal to be done. To begin with the loads had to be arranged.\r\nThese consisted largely of ammunition, everything else being cut down\r\nto an irreducible minimum. To carry them we took two donkeys there were\r\non the place, also half a dozen pack oxen, all of which animals were\r\nsupposed to be “salted”—that is, to have suffered and recovered from\r\nevery kind of sickness, including the bite of the deadly tsetse fly. I\r\nsuspected, it is true, that they would not be proof against further\r\nattacks, still, I hoped that they would last for some time, as indeed\r\nproved to be the case.\r\n\r\nIn the event of the beasts failing us, we took also ten of the best of\r\nthose Strathmuir men who had accompanied us on the sea-cow trip, to\r\nserve as bearers when it became necessary. It cannot be said that these\r\nsnuff-and-butter fellows—for most, if not all of them had some dash of\r\nwhite blood in their veins—were exactly willing volunteers. Indeed, if\r\na choice had been left to them, they would, I think, have declined this\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nBut there was no choice. Their master, Robertson, ordered them to come\r\nand after a glance at the Zulus they concluded that the command was one\r\nwhich would be enforced and that if they stopped behind, it would not\r\nbe as living men. Also some of them had lost wives or children in the\r\nslaughter, which, if they were not very brave, filled them with a\r\ndesire for revenge. Lastly, they could all shoot after a fashion and\r\nhad good rifles; moreover if I may say so, I think that they put\r\nconfidence in my leadership. So they made the best of a bad business\r\nand got themselves ready.\r\n\r\nThen arrangements must be made about the carrying on of the farm and\r\nstore during our absence. These, together with my waggon and oxen, were\r\nput in the charge of Thomaso, since there was no one else who could be\r\ntrusted at all—a very battered and crestfallen Thomaso, by the way.\r\nWhen he heard of it he was much relieved, since I think he feared lest\r\nhe also should be expected to take part in the hunt of the Amahagger\r\nman-eaters. Also it may have occurred to him that in all probability\r\nnone of us would ever come back at all, in which case by a process of\r\nnatural devolution, he might find himself the owner of the business and\r\nmuch valuable property. However, he swore by sundry saints—for Thomaso\r\nwas nominally a Catholic—that he would look after everything as though\r\nit were his own, as no doubt he hoped it might become.\r\n\r\n“Hearken, fat pig,” said Umslopogaas, Hans obligingly translating so\r\nthat there might be no mistake, “if I come back, and come back I shall\r\nwho travel with the Great Medicine—and find even one of the cattle of\r\nthe white lord, Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night, missing, or one article\r\nstolen from his waggon, or the fields of your master not cultivated or\r\nhis goods wasted, I swear by the Axe that I will hew you into pieces\r\nwith the axe; yes, if to do it I have to hunt you from where the sun\r\nrises to where it sets and down the length of the night between. Do you\r\nunderstand, fat pig, deserter of women and children, who to save\r\nyourself could run faster than a buck?”\r\n\r\nThomaso replied that he understood very clearly indeed, and that,\r\nHeaven helping him, all should be kept safe and sound. Still, I was\r\nsure that in his manly heart he was promising great gifts to the saints\r\nif they would so arrange matters that Umslopogaas and his axe were\r\nnever seen at Strathmuir again, and reflecting that after all the\r\nAmahagger had their uses. However, as I did not trust him in the least,\r\nmuch against their will, I left my driver and _voorlooper_ to guard my\r\nbelongings.\r\n\r\nAt last we did get off, pursued by the fervent blessings of Thomaso and\r\nthe prayers of the others that we would avenge their murdered\r\nrelatives. We were a curious and motley procession. First went Hans,\r\nbecause at following a spoor he was, I believe, almost unequalled in\r\nAfrica, and with him, Umslopogaas, and three of his Zulus to guard\r\nagainst surprise. These were followed by Captain Robertson, who seemed\r\nto prefer to walk alone and whom I thought it best to leave\r\nundisturbed. Then I came and after me straggled the Strathmuir boys\r\nwith the pack animals, the cavalcade being closed by the remaining\r\nZulus under the command of Goroko. These walked last in case any of the\r\nmixed-bloods should attempt to desert, as we thought it quite probable\r\nthat they would.\r\n\r\nLess than an hour’s tramp brought us to the bush-veld where I feared\r\nthat our troubles might begin, since if the Amahagger were cunning,\r\nthey would take advantage of it to confuse or hide their spoor. As it\r\nchanced, however, they had done nothing of the sort and a child could\r\nhave followed their march. Just before nightfall we came to their first\r\nhalting-place where they had made a fire and eaten one of the herd of\r\nfarm goats which they had driven away with them, although they left the\r\ncattle, I suppose, because goats are docile and travel well.\r\n\r\nHans showed us everything that had happened; where the chair in which\r\nInez was carried was set down, where she and Janee had been allowed to\r\nwalk that she might stretch her stiff limbs, the dregs of some coffee\r\nthat evidently Janee had made in a saucepan, and so forth.\r\n\r\nHe even told us the exact number of the Amahagger, which he said\r\ntotalled forty-one, including the man whom Inez had wounded. His spoor\r\nhe distinguished from that of the others both by an occasional drop of\r\nblood and because he walked lightly on his right foot, doubtless for\r\nthe reason that he wished to avoid jarring his wound, which was on that\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAt this spot we were obliged to stay till daybreak, since it was\r\nimpossible to follow the spoor by night, a circumstance that gave the\r\ncannibals a great advantage over us.\r\n\r\nThe next two days were repetitions of the first, but on the fourth we\r\npassed out of the bush-veld into the swamp country that bordered the\r\ngreat river. Here our task was still easy since the Amahagger had\r\nfollowed one of the paths made by the river-dwellers who had their\r\nhabitations on mounds, though whether these were natural or artificial\r\nI am not sure, and sometimes on floating islands.\r\n\r\nOn our second day in the reeds we came upon a sad sight. To our left\r\nstood one of these mound villages, if a village it could be called,\r\nsince it consisted only of four or five huts inhabited perhaps by\r\ntwenty people. We went up to it to obtain information and stumbled\r\nacross the body of an old man lying in the pathway. A few yards further\r\non we found the ashes of a big fire and by it such remains as we had\r\nseen at Strathmuir. Here there had been another cannibal feast. The\r\nmiserable huts were empty, but as at Strathmuir, had not been burnt.\r\n\r\nWe were going away when the acute ears of Hans caught the sound of\r\ngroans. We searched about and in a clump of reeds near the foot of the\r\nmound, found an old woman with a great spear wound just above her\r\nskinny thigh piercing deep into the vitals, but of a nature which is\r\nnot immediately mortal. One of Robertson’s people who understood the\r\nlanguage of these swamp-dwellers well, spoke to her. She told him that\r\nshe wanted water. It was brought and she drank copiously. Then in\r\nanswer to his questions she began to talk.\r\n\r\nShe said that the Amahagger had attacked the village and killed all who\r\ncould not escape. They had eaten a young woman and three children. She\r\nhad been wounded by a spear and fled away into the place where we found\r\nher, where none of them took the trouble to follow her as she “was not\r\nworth eating.”\r\n\r\nBy my direction the man asked her whether she knew anything of these\r\nAmahagger. She replied that her grandfathers had, though she had heard\r\nnothing of them since she was a child, which must have been seventy\r\nyears before. They were a fierce people who lived far up north across\r\nthe Great River, the remnants of a race that had once “ruled the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nHer grandfathers used to say that they were not always cannibals, but\r\nhad become so long before because of a lack of food and now had\r\nacquired the taste. It was for this purpose that they still raided to\r\nget other people to eat, since their ruler would not allow them to eat\r\none another. The flesh of cattle they did not care for, although they\r\nhad plenty of them, but sometimes they ate goats and pigs because they\r\nsaid they tasted like man. According to her grandfathers they were a\r\nvery evil people and full of magic.\r\n\r\nAll of this the old woman told us quite briskly after she had drunk the\r\nwater, I think because her wound had mortified and she felt no pain.\r\nHer information, however, as is common with the aged, dealt entirely\r\nwith the far past; of the history of the Amahagger since the days of\r\nher forebears she knew nothing, nor had she seen anything of Inez. All\r\nshe could tell us was that some of them had attacked her village at\r\ndawn and that when she ran out of the hut she was speared.\r\n\r\nWhile Robertson and I were wondering what we should do with the poor\r\nold creature whom it seemed cruel to leave here to perish, she cleared\r\nup the question by suddenly expiring before our eyes. Uttering the name\r\nof someone with whom, doubtless, she had been familiar in her youth,\r\nthree or four times over, she just sank down and seemed to go to sleep\r\nand on examination we found that she was dead. So we left her and went\r\non.\r\n\r\nNext day we came to the edge of the Great River, here a sheet of placid\r\nrunning water about a mile across, for at this time of the year it was\r\nlow. Perceiving quite a big village on our left, we went to it and made\r\nenquiries, to find that it had not been attacked by the cannibals,\r\nprobably because it was too powerful, but that three nights before some\r\nof their canoes had been stolen, in which no doubt these had crossed\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nAs the people of this village had traded with Robertson at Strathmuir,\r\nwe had no difficulty in obtaining other canoes from them in which to\r\ncross the Zambesi in return for one of our oxen that I could see was\r\nalready sickening from tsetse bite. These canoes were large enough to\r\ntake the donkeys that were patient creatures and stood still, but the\r\ncattle we could not get into them for fear of an upset. So we killed\r\nthe two driven beasts that were left to us and took them with us as\r\ndead meat for food, while the three remaining pack oxen we tried to\r\nswim across, dragging them after the canoes with hide _reims_ round\r\ntheir horns. As a result two were drowned, but one, a bold-hearted and\r\nenterprising animal, gained the other bank.\r\n\r\nHere again we struck a sea of reeds in which, after casting about, Hans\r\nonce more found the spoor of the Amahagger. That it was theirs beyond\r\ndoubt was proved by the circumstance that on a thorny kind of weed we\r\nfound a fragment of a cotton dress which, because of the pattern\r\nstamped on it, we all recognised as one that Inez had been wearing. At\r\nfirst I thought that this had been torn off by the thorns, but on\r\nexamination we became certain that it had been placed there purposely,\r\nprobably by Janee, to give us a clue. This conclusion was confirmed\r\nwhen at subsequent periods of the hunt we found other fragments of the\r\nsame garment.\r\n\r\nNow it would be useless for me to set out the details of this prolonged\r\nand arduous chase which in all endured for something over three weeks.\r\nAgain and again we lost the trail and were only able to recover it by\r\nlong and elaborate search, which occupied much time. Then, after we\r\nescaped from the reeds and swamps, we found ourselves upon stony\r\nuplands where the spoor was almost impossible to follow, indeed, we\r\nonly rediscovered it by stumbling across the dead body of that cannibal\r\nwhom Inez had wounded. Evidently he had perished from his hurt, which I\r\ncould see had mortified. From the state of his remains we gathered that\r\nthe raiders must be about two days’ march ahead of us.\r\n\r\nStriking their spoor again on softer ground where the impress of their\r\nfeet remained—at any rate to the cunning sight of Hans—we followed them\r\ndown across great valleys wherein trees grew sparsely, which valleys\r\nwere separated from each other by ridges of high and barren land. On\r\nthese belts of rocky soil our difficulties were great, but here twice\r\nwe were put on the right track by more fragments torn from the dress of\r\nInez.\r\n\r\nAt length we lost the spoor altogether; not a sign of it was to be\r\nfound. We had no idea which way to go. All about us appeared these\r\nvalleys covered with scattered bush running this way and that, so that\r\nwe could not tell which of them to follow or to cross. The thing seemed\r\nhopeless, for how could we expect to find a little body of men in that\r\nimmensity? Hans shook his head and even the fierce and steadfast\r\nRobertson was discouraged.\r\n\r\n“I fear my poor lassie is gone,” he said, and relapsed into brooding as\r\nhad become his wont.\r\n\r\n“Never say die! It’s dogged as does it!” I replied cheerfully in the\r\nwords of Nelson, who also had learned what it meant to hunt an enemy\r\nover trackless wastes, although his were of water.\r\n\r\nI walked to the top of the rise where we were encamped, and sat down\r\nalone to think matters over. Our condition was somewhat parlous; all\r\nour beasts were now dead, even the second donkey, which was the last of\r\nthem, having perished that morning, and been eaten, for food was scanty\r\nsince of late we had met with little game. The Strathmuir men, who now\r\nmust carry the loads, were almost worn out and doubtless would have\r\ndeserted, except for the fact that there was no place to which they\r\ncould go. Even the Zulus were discouraged, and said they had come away\r\nfrom home across the Great River to fight, not to run about in\r\nwildernesses and starve, though Umslopogaas made no complaint, being\r\nbuoyed up by the promise of his soothsayer, Goroko, that battle was\r\nahead of him in which he would win great glory.\r\n\r\nHans, however, remained cheerful, for the reason, as he remarked\r\nvacuously, that the Great Medicine was with us and that therefore,\r\nhowever bad things seemed to be, all in fact was well; an argument that\r\ncarried no conviction to my soul.\r\n\r\nIt was on a certain evening towards sunset that I went away thus alone.\r\nI looked about me, east and west and north. Everywhere appeared the\r\nsame bush-clad valleys and barren rises, miles upon miles of them. I\r\nbethought me of the map that old Zikali had drawn in the ashes, and\r\nremembered that it showed these valleys and rises and that beyond them\r\nthere should be a great swamp, and beyond the swamp a mountain. So it\r\nseemed that we were on the right road to the home of his white Queen,\r\nif such a person existed, or at any rate we were passing over country\r\nsimilar to that which he had pictured or imagined.\r\n\r\nBut at this time I was not troubling my head about white queens. I was\r\nthinking of poor Inez. That she was alive a few days before we knew\r\nfrom the fragments of her dress. But where was she now? The spoor was\r\nutterly lost on that stony ground, or if any traces of it remained a\r\nheavy deluge of rain had washed them away. Even Hans had confessed\r\nhimself beaten.\r\n\r\nI stared about me helplessly, and as I did so a flying ray of light\r\nfrom the setting sun reflected downwards from a storm-cloud, fell upon\r\na white patch on the crest of one of the distant land-waves. It struck\r\nme that probably limestone outcropped at this spot, as indeed proved to\r\nbe the case; also that such a patch of white would be a convenient\r\nguide for any who were travelling across that sea of bush. Further,\r\nsome instinct within seemed to impel me to steer for it, although I had\r\nall but made up my mind to go in a totally different direction many\r\nmore points to the east. It was almost as though a voice were calling\r\nto me to take this path and no other. Doubtless this was an effect\r\nproduced by weariness and mental overstrain. Still, there it was, very\r\nreal and tangible, one that I did not attempt to combat.\r\n\r\nSo next morning at the dawn I headed north by west, laying my course\r\nfor that white patch and for the first time breaking the straight line\r\nof our advance. Captain Robertson, whose temper had not been bettered\r\nby prolonged and frightful anxiety, or I may add, by his unaccustomed\r\nabstinence, asked me rather roughly why I was altering the course.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Captain,” I answered, “if we were at sea and you did\r\nsomething of the sort, I should not put such a question to you, and if\r\nby any chance I did, I should not expect you to answer. Well, by your\r\nown wish I am in command here and I think that the same argument\r\nholds.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he replied. “I suppose you have studied your chart, if there is\r\nany of this God-forsaken country, and at any rate discipline is\r\ndiscipline. So steam ahead and don’t mind me.”\r\n\r\nThe others accepted my decision without comment; most of them were so\r\nmiserable that they did not care which way we went, also they were good\r\nenough to repose confidence in my judgment.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless the Baas has reasons,” said Hans dubiously, “although the\r\nspoor, when last we saw it, headed towards the rising sun and as the\r\ncountry is all the same, I do not see why those man-eaters should have\r\nreturned.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “I have reasons,” although in fact I had none at all.\r\n\r\nHans surveyed me with a watery eye as though waiting for me to explain\r\nthem, but I looked haughty and declined to oblige.\r\n\r\n“The Baas has reasons,” continued Hans, “for taking us on what I think\r\nto be the wrong side of that great ridge, there to hunt for the spoor\r\nof the men-eaters, and they are so deep down in his mind that he cannot\r\ndig them up for poor old Hans to look at. Well, the Baas wears the\r\nGreat Medicine and perhaps it is there that the reasons sit. Those\r\nStrathmuir fellows say that they can go no further and wish to die.\r\nUmslopogaas has just gone to them with his axe to tell them that he is\r\nready to help them to their wish. Look, he has got there, for they are\r\ncoming quickly, who after all prefer to live.”\r\n\r\nWell, we started for my white patch of stones which no one else had\r\nnoticed and of which I said nothing to anyone, and reached it by the\r\nfollowing evening, to find, as I expected, that it was a lime outcrop.\r\n\r\nBy now we were in a poor way, for we had practically nothing left to\r\neat, which did not tend to raise the spirits of the party. Also that\r\nlime outcrop proved to be an uninteresting spot overlooking a wide\r\nvalley which seemed to suggest that there were other valleys of a\r\nsimilar sort beyond it, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nCaptain Robertson sat stern-faced and despondent at a distance\r\nmuttering into his beard, as had become a habit with him. Umslopogaas\r\nleaned upon his axe and contemplated the heavens, also occasionally the\r\nStrathmuir men who cowered beneath his eye. The Zulus squatted about\r\nsharing such snuff as remained to them in economic pinches. Goroko, the\r\nwitch-doctor, engaged himself in consulting his “Spirit,” by means of\r\nbone-throwing, upon the humble subject of whether or no we should\r\nsucceed in killing any game for food to-morrow, a point on which I\r\ngathered that his “Spirit” was quite uncertain. In short, the gloom was\r\ndeep and universal and the sky looked as though it were going to rain.\r\n\r\nHans became sarcastic. Sneaking up to me in his most aggravating way,\r\nlike a dog that means to steal something and cover up the theft with\r\nsimulated affection, he pointed out one by one all the disadvantages of\r\nour present position. He indicated _per contra_, that if _his_ advice\r\nhad been followed, his conviction was that even if we had not found the\r\nman-eaters and rescued the lady called Sad-Eyes, our state would have\r\nbeen quite different. He was sure, he added, that the valley which he\r\nhad suggested we should follow, was one full of game, inasmuch as he\r\nhad seen their spoor at its entrance.\r\n\r\n“Then why did you not say so?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHans sucked at his empty corn-cob pipe, which was his way of indicating\r\nthat he would like me to give him some tobacco, much as a dog groans\r\nheavily under the table when he wants a bit to eat, and answered that\r\nit was not for him to point out things to one who knew everything, like\r\nthe great Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night, his honoured master. Still, the\r\nluck did seem to have gone a bit wrong. The privations could have been\r\nput up with (here he sucked very loudly at the empty pipe and looked at\r\nmine, which was alight), everything could have been put up with, if\r\nonly there had been a chance of coming even with those men-eaters and\r\nrescuing the Lady Sad-Eyes, whose face haunted his sleep. As it was,\r\nhowever, he was convinced that by following the course I had mapped out\r\nwe had lost their spoor finally and that probably they were now three\r\ndays’ march away in another direction. Still, the Baas had said that he\r\nhad his reasons, and that of course was enough for him, Hans, only if\r\nthe Baas would condescend to tell him, he would as a matter of\r\ncuriosity like to know what the reasons were.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I confess that, much as I was attached to him, I should\r\nhave liked to murder Hans, who, I felt, believing that he had me “on\r\ntoast,” to use a vulgar phrase, was taking advantage of my position to\r\nmake a mock of me in his sly, Hottentot way.\r\n\r\nI tried to continue to look grand, but felt that the attitude did not\r\nimpress. Then I stared about me as though taking counsel with the\r\nHeavens, devoutly hoping that the Heavens would respond to my mute\r\nappeal. As a matter of fact they did.\r\n\r\n“There is my reason, Hans,” I said in my most icy voice, and I pointed\r\nto a faint line of smoke rising against the twilight sky on the further\r\nside of the intervening valley.\r\n\r\n“You will perceive, Hans,” I added, “that those Amahagger cannibals\r\nhave forgotten their caution and lit a fire yonder, which they have not\r\ndone for a long time. Perhaps you would like to know why this has\r\nhappened. If so I will tell you. It is because for some days past I\r\nhave purposely lost their spoor, which they knew we were following, and\r\nlit fires to puzzle them. Now, thinking that they have done with us,\r\nthey have become incautious and shown us where they are. That is my\r\nreason, Hans.”\r\n\r\nHe heard and, although of course he did not believe that I had lost the\r\nspoor on purpose, stared at me till I thought his little eyes were\r\ngoing to drop out of his head. But even in his admiration he contrived\r\nto convey an insult as only a native can.\r\n\r\n“How wonderful is the Great Medicine of the Opener-of-Roads, that it\r\nshould have been able thus to instruct the Baas,” he said. “Without\r\ndoubt the Great Medicine is right and yonder those men-eaters are\r\nencamped, who might just as well as have been anywhere else within a\r\nhundred miles.”\r\n\r\n“Drat the Great Medicine,” I replied, but beneath my breath, then added\r\naloud,\r\n\r\n“Be so good, Hans, as to go to Umslopogaas and to tell him that\r\nMacumazahn, or the Great Medicine, proposes to march at once to attack\r\nthe camp of the Amahagger, and—here is some tobacco.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas,” answered Hans humbly, as he snatched the tobacco and\r\nwriggled away like a worm.\r\n\r\nThen I went to talk with Robertson.\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that within an hour we were creeping across that\r\nvalley towards the spot where I had seen the line of smoke rising\r\nagainst the twilight sky.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about midnight we reached the neighbourhood of this place.\r\nHow near or how far we were from it, we could not tell since the moon\r\nwas invisible, as of course the smoke was in the dark. Now the question\r\nwas, what should we do?\r\n\r\nObviously there would be enormous advantages in a night attack, or at\r\nleast in locating the enemy, so that it might be carried out at dawn\r\nbefore he marched. Especially was this so, since we were scarcely in a\r\ncondition even if we could come face to face with them, to fight these\r\nsavages when they were prepared and in the light of day. Only we two\r\nwhite men, with Hans, Umslopogaas and his Zulus, could be relied upon\r\nin such a case, since the Strathmuir mixed-bloods had become entirely\r\ndemoralised and were not to be trusted at a pinch. Indeed, tired and\r\nhalf starving as we were, none of us was at his best. Therefore a\r\nsurprise seemed our only chance. But first we must find those whom we\r\nwished to surprise.\r\n\r\nUltimately, after a hurried consultation, it was agreed that Hans and I\r\nshould go forward and see if we could locate the Amahagger. Robertson\r\nwished to come too, but I pointed out that he must remain to look after\r\nhis people, who, if he left them, might take the opportunity to melt\r\naway in the darkness, especially as they knew that heavy fighting was\r\nat hand. Also if anything happened to me it was desirable that one\r\nwhite man should remain to lead the party. Umslopogaas, too,\r\nvolunteered, but knowing his character, I declined his help. To tell\r\nthe truth, I was almost certain that if we came upon the men-eaters, he\r\nwould charge the whole lot of them and accomplish a fine but futile end\r\nafter hacking down a number of cannibal barbarians, whose extinction or\r\nescape remained absolutely immaterial to our purpose, namely, the\r\nrescue of Inez.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that Hans and I started alone, I not at all enjoying\r\nthe job. I suppose that there lurks in my nature some of that primeval\r\nterror of the dark, which must continually have haunted our remote\r\nforefathers of a hundred or a thousand generations gone and still\r\nlingers in the blood of most of us. At any rate even if I am named the\r\nWatcher-by-Night, greatly do I prefer to fight or to face peril in the\r\nsunlight, though it is true that I would rather avoid both at any time.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I wished heartily that the Amahagger were at the other side of\r\nAfrica, or in heaven, and that I, completely ignorant of the person\r\ncalled Inez Robertson, were seated smoking the pipe of peace on my own\r\nstoep in Durban. I think that Hans guessed my state of mind, since he\r\nsuggested that he should go alone, adding with his usual unveiled\r\nrudeness, that he was quite certain that he would do much better\r\nwithout me, since white men always made a noise.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, determined to give him a Roland for his Oliver, “I\r\nhave no doubt you would—under the first bush you came across, where you\r\nwould sleep till dawn, and then return and say that you could not find\r\nthe Amahagger.”\r\n\r\nHans chuckled, quite appreciating the joke, and having thus mutually\r\naffronted each other, we started on our quest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE SWAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither Hans nor I carried rifles that we knew would be in the way on\r\nour business, which was just to scout. Moreover, one is always tempted\r\nto shoot if a gun is at hand, and this I did not want to do at present.\r\nSo, although I had my revolver in case of urgent necessity, my only\r\nother weapon was a Zulu axe, that formerly had belonged to one of those\r\ntwo men who died defending Inez on the veranda at Strathmuir, while\r\nHans had nothing but his long knife. Thus armed, or unarmed, we crept\r\nforward towards that spot whence, as we conjectured, we had seen the\r\nline of smoke rising some hours before.\r\n\r\nFor about a quarter of a mile we went on thus without seeing or hearing\r\nanything, and a difficult job it was in that gloom among the scattered\r\ntrees with no light save such as the stars gave us. Indeed, I was about\r\nto suggest that we had better abandon the enterprise until daybreak\r\nwhen Hans nudged me, whispering,\r\n\r\n“Look to the right between those twin thorns.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed and following the line of sight which he had indicated,\r\nperceived, at a distance of about two hundred yards a faint glow, so\r\nfaint indeed that I think only Hans would have noticed it. Really it\r\nmight have been nothing more than the phosphorescence rising from a\r\nheap of fungus, or even from a decaying animal.\r\n\r\n“The fire of which we saw the smoke that has burnt to ashes,” whispered\r\nHans again. “I think that they have gone, but let us look.”\r\n\r\nSo we crawled forward very cautiously to avoid making the slightest\r\nnoise; so cautiously, indeed, that it must have taken us nearly half an\r\nhour to cover those two hundred yards.\r\n\r\nAt length we were within about forty yards of that dying fire and,\r\nafraid to go further, came to a stand—or rather, a lie-still—behind\r\nsome bushes until we knew more. Hans lifted his head and sniffed with\r\nhis broad nostrils; then he whispered into my ear, but so low that I\r\ncould scarcely hear him.\r\n\r\n“Amahagger there all right, Baas, I smell them.”\r\n\r\nThis of course was possible, since what wind there was blew from the\r\ndirection of the fire, although I whose nose is fairly keen could smell\r\nnothing at all. So I determined to wait and watch a while, and\r\nindicated my decision to Hans, who, considering our purpose\r\naccomplished, showed signs of wishing to retreat.\r\n\r\nSome minutes we lay thus, till of a sudden this happened. A branch of\r\nresinous wood of which the stem had been eaten through by the flames,\r\nfell upon the ashes of the fire and burnt up with a brilliant light. In\r\nit we saw that the Amahagger were sleeping in a circle round the fire\r\nwrapped in their blankets.\r\n\r\nAlso we saw another thing, namely that nearer to us, not more than a\r\ndozen yards away, indeed, was a kind of little tent, also made of fur\r\nrugs or blankets, which doubtless sheltered Inez. Indeed, this was\r\nevident from the fact that at the mouth of it, wrapped up in something,\r\nlay none other than her maid, Janee, for her face being towards us, was\r\nrecognised by us both in the flare of the flaming branch. One more\r\nthing we noted, namely, that two of the cannibals, evidently a guard,\r\nwere sleeping between us and the little tent. Of course they ought to\r\nhave been awake, but fatigue had overcome them and there they\r\nslumbered, seated on the ground, their heads hanging forward almost\r\nupon their knees.\r\n\r\nAn idea came to me. If we could kill those men without waking the\r\nothers in that gloom, it might be possible to rescue Inez at once.\r\nRapidly I weighed the _pros_ and _cons_ of such an attempt. Its\r\nadvantages, if successful, were that the object of our pursuit would be\r\ncarried through without further trouble and that it was most doubtful\r\nwhether we should ever get such a chance again. If we returned to fetch\r\nthe others and attacked in force, the probability was that those\r\nAmahagger, or one of them, would hear some sound made by the advance of\r\na number of men, and fly into the darkness; or, rather than lose Inez,\r\nthey might kill her. Or if they stood and fought, she might be slain in\r\nthe scrimmage. Or, as after all we had only about a dozen effectives,\r\nfor the Strathmuir bearers could not be relied upon, they might defeat\r\nand kill us whom they outnumbered by two or three to one.\r\n\r\nThese were the arguments for the attempt. Those for not making it were\r\nequally obvious. To begin with it was one of extraordinary risk; the\r\ntwo guards or someone else behind them might wake up—for such people,\r\nlike dogs, mostly sleep with one eye open, especially when they know\r\nthat they are being pursued. Or if they did not we might bungle the\r\nbusiness so that they raised an outcry before they grew silent for\r\never, in which case both of us and perhaps Inez also would probably pay\r\nthe penalty before we could get away.\r\n\r\nSuch was the horned dilemma upon one point or other of which we ran the\r\nrisk of being impaled. For a full minute or more I considered the\r\nmatter with an earnestness almost amounting to mental agony, and at\r\nlast all but came to the conclusion that the danger was too enormous.\r\nIt would be better, notwithstanding the many disadvantages of that\r\nplan, to go back and fetch the others.\r\n\r\nBut then it was that I made one of my many mistakes in life. Most of us\r\ndo more foolish things than wise ones and sometimes I think that in\r\nspite of a certain reputation for caution and far-sightedness, I am\r\nexceptionally cursed in this respect. Indeed, when I look back upon my\r\npast, I can scarcely see the scanty flowers of wisdom that decorate its\r\npath because of the fat, ugly trees of error by which it is\r\novershadowed.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion, forgetting past experiences where Hans was concerned,\r\nmy natural tendency to blunder took the form of relying upon another’s\r\njudgment instead of on my own. Although I had formed a certain view as\r\nto what should be done, the _pros_ and _cons_ seemed so evenly balanced\r\nthat I determined to consult the little Hottentot and accept his\r\nverdict. This, after all, was but a form of gambling like pitch and\r\ntoss, since, although it is true Hans was a clever, or at any rate a\r\ncunning man according to his lights, and experienced, it meant that I\r\nwas placing my own judgment in abeyance, which no one considering a\r\nlife-and-death enterprise should do, taking the chance of that of\r\nanother, whatever it might be. However, not for the first time, I did\r\nso—to my grief.\r\n\r\nIn the tiniest of whispers with my lips right against his smelly head,\r\nI submitted the problem to Hans, asking him what we should do, go on or\r\ngo back. He considered a while, then answered in a voice which he\r\ncontrived to make like the drone of a night beetle.\r\n\r\n“Those men are fast asleep, I know it by their breathing. Also the Baas\r\nhas the Great Medicine. Therefore I say go on, kill them and rescue\r\nSad-Eyes.”\r\n\r\nNow I saw that the Fates to which I had appealed had decided against me\r\nand that I must accept their decree. With a sick and sinking heart—for\r\nI did not at all like the business—I wondered for a moment what had led\r\nHans to take this view, which was directly opposite to any I had\r\nexpected from him. Of course his superstition about the Great Medicine\r\nhad something to do with it, but I felt convinced that this was not\r\nall.\r\n\r\nEven then I guessed that two arguments appealed to him, of which the\r\nfirst was that he desired, if possible, to put an end to this\r\nintolerable and unceasing hunt which had worn us all out, no matter\r\nwhat that end might be. The second and more powerful, however, was, I\r\nbelieved, and rightly, that the idea of this stealthy, midnight blow\r\nappealed irresistibly to the craft of his half-wild nature in which the\r\nstrains of the leopard and the snake seemed to mingle with that of the\r\nhuman being. For be it remembered that notwithstanding his veneer of\r\ncivilisation, Hans was a savage whose forefathers for countless ages\r\nhad preserved themselves alive by means of such attacks and stratagems.\r\n\r\nThe die having been cast, in the same infinitesimal whispers we made\r\nour arrangements, which were few and simple. They amounted to this—that\r\nwe were to creep on to the men and each of us to kill that one who was\r\nopposite to him, I with the axe and Hans with his knife, remembering\r\nthat it must be done with a single stroke—that is, if they did not wake\r\nup and kill us—after which we were to get Inez out of her shelter,\r\ndressed or undressed, and make off with her into the darkness where we\r\nwere pretty sure of being able to baffle pursuit until we reached our\r\nown camp.\r\n\r\nProvided that we could kill the two guards in the proper fashion—rather\r\na large proviso, I admit—the thing was simple as shelling peas which,\r\nnotwithstanding the proverb, in my experience is not simple at all,\r\nsince generally the shells crack the wrong way and at least one of the\r\npeas remained in the pod. So it happened in this case, for Janee, whom\r\nwe had both forgotten, remained in the pod.\r\n\r\nI am sure I don’t know why we overlooked her; indeed, the error was\r\ninexcusable, especially as Hans had already experienced her foolishness\r\nand she was lying there before our eyes. I suppose that our minds were\r\nso concentrated upon the guard-killing and the tragic and impressive\r\nInez that there was no room in them for the stolid and matter-of-fact\r\nJanee. At any rate she proved to be the pea that would not come out of\r\nthe pod.\r\n\r\nOften in my life I have felt terrified, not being by nature one of\r\nthose who rejoices in dangers and wild adventures for their own sake,\r\nwhich only the stupid do, but who has, on the contrary, been forced to\r\nundertake them by the pressure of circumstances, a kind of hydraulic\r\nforce that no one can resist, and who, having undertaken, has been\r\ncarried through them, triumphing over the shrinkings of his flesh by\r\nsome secret reserve of nerve power. Almost am I tempted to call it\r\nspirit-power, something that lives beyond and yet inspires our frail\r\nand fallible bodies.\r\n\r\nWell, rarely have I been more frightened than I was at this moment.\r\nActually I hung back until I saw that Hans slithering through the grass\r\nlike a thick yellow snake with the great knife in his right hand, was\r\nquite a foot ahead of me. Then my pride came to the rescue and I\r\nspurted, if one can spurt upon one’s stomach, and drew level with him.\r\nAfter this we went at a pace so slow that any able-bodied snail would\r\nhave left us standing still. Inch by inch we crept forward, lying\r\nmotionless a while after each convulsive movement, once for quite a\r\nlong time, since the left-hand cannibal seemed about to wake up, for he\r\nopened his mouth and yawned. If so, he changed his mind and rolling\r\nfrom a sitting posture on to his side, went to sleep much more soundly\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nA minute or so later the right-hand ruffian, my man, also stirred, so\r\nsharply that I thought he had heard something. Apparently, however, he\r\nwas only haunted by dreams resulting from an evil life, or perhaps by\r\nthe prescience of its end, for after waving his arm and muttering\r\nsomething in a frightened voice, he too, wearied out, poor devil, sank\r\nback into sleep.\r\n\r\nAt last we were on them, but paused because we could not see exactly\r\nwhere to strike and knew, each of us, that our first blow must be the\r\nlast and fatal. A cloud had come up and dimmed what light there was,\r\nand we must wait for it to pass. It was a long wait, or so it seemed.\r\n\r\nAt length that cloud did pass and in faint outline I saw the classical\r\nhead of my Amahagger bowed in deep sleep. With a heart beating as it\r\ndoes only in the fierce extremities of love or war, I hissed like a\r\nsnake, which was our agreed signal. Then rising to my knees, I lifted\r\nthe Zulu axe and struck with all my strength.\r\n\r\nThe blow was straight and true; Umslopogaas himself could not have\r\ndealt a better. The victim in front of me uttered no sound and made no\r\nmovement; only sank gently on to his side, and there lay as dead as\r\nthough he had never been born.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Hans had done equally well, since the other man kicked\r\nout his long legs, which struck me on the knees. Then he also became\r\nstrangely still. In short, both of them were stone dead and would tell\r\nno stories this side of Judgment Day.\r\n\r\nRecovering my axe, which had been wrenched from my hand, I crept\r\nforward and opened the curtain-like rugs or blankets, I do not know\r\nwhich they were, that covered Inez. I heard her stir at once. The\r\nmovement had wakened her, since captives sleep lightly.\r\n\r\n“Make no noise, Inez,” I whispered. “It is I, Allan Quatermain, come to\r\nrescue you. Slip out and follow me; do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, quite,” she whispered back and began to rise.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a blood-curdling yell seemed to fill earth and heaven, a\r\nyell at the memory of which even now I feel faint, although I am\r\nwriting years after its echoes died away.\r\n\r\nI may as well say at once that it came from Janee who, awaking\r\nsuddenly, had perceived against the background of the sky, Hans\r\nstanding over her, looking like a yellow devil with a long knife in his\r\nhand, which she thought was about to be used to murder her.\r\n\r\nSo, lacking self-restraint, she screamed in the most lusty fashion, for\r\nher lungs were excellent, and—the game was up.\r\n\r\nInstantly every man sleeping round the fire leapt to his feet and\r\nrushed in the direction of the echoes of Janee’s yell. It was\r\nimpossible to get Inez free of her tent arrangement or to do anything,\r\nexcept whisper to her,\r\n\r\n“Feign sleep and know nothing. We will follow you. Your father is with\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nThen I bolted back into the bushes, which Hans had reached already.\r\n\r\nA minute or two later when we were clear of the hubbub and nearing our\r\nown camp, Hans remarked to me sententiously,\r\n\r\n“The Great Medicine worked well, Baas, but not quite well enough, for\r\nwhat medicine can avail against a woman’s folly?”\r\n\r\n“It was our own folly we should blame,” I answered. “We ought to have\r\nknown that fool-girl would shriek, and taken precautions.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, we ought to have killed her too, for nothing else would\r\nhave kept her quiet,” replied Hans in cheerful assent. “Now we shall\r\nhave to pay for our mistake, for the hunt must go on.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment we stumbled across Robertson and Umslopogaas who, with\r\nthe others, and every living thing within a mile or two had also heard\r\nJanee’s yell, and briefly told our story. When he learned how near we\r\nhad been to rescuing his daughter, Robertson groaned, but Umslopogaas\r\nonly said,\r\n\r\n“Well, there are two less of the men-eaters left to deal with. Still,\r\nfor once your wisdom failed you, Macumazahn. When you had found the\r\ncamp you should have returned, so that we might all attack it together.\r\nHad we done so, before the dawn there would not have been one of them\r\nleft.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “I think that my wisdom did fail me, if I have any\r\nto fail. But come; perhaps we may catch them yet.”\r\n\r\nSo we advanced, Hans and I showing the road. But when we reached the\r\nplace it was too late, for all that remained of the Amahagger, or of\r\nInez and Janee, were the two dead men whom we had killed, and in that\r\ndarkness pursuit was impossible. So we went back to our own camp to\r\nrest and await the dawn before taking up the trail, only to find\r\nourselves confronted with a new trouble. All the Strathmuir half-breeds\r\nwhom we had left behind as useless, had taken advantage of our absence\r\nand that of the Zulus, to desert. They had just bolted back upon our\r\ntracks and vanished into the sea of bush. What became of them I do not\r\nknow, as we never saw them again, but my belief is that these cowardly\r\nfellows all perished, for certainly not one of them reached Strathmuir.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us, however, they departed in such a hurry that they\r\nleft all their loads behind them, and even some of the guns they\r\ncarried. Evidently Janee’s yell was the last straw which broke the back\r\nof such nerve as remained to them. Doubtless they believed it to be the\r\nsignal of attack by hordes of cannibals.\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing to be said or done, since any pursuit of these\r\ncurs was out of the question, we made the best of things as they were.\r\nIt proved a simple business. From the loads we selected such articles\r\nas were essential, ammunition for the most part, to carry ourselves—and\r\nthe rest we abandoned, hiding it under a pile of stones in case we\r\nshould ever come that way again.\r\n\r\nThe guns they had thrown aside we distributed among the Zulus who had\r\nnone, though the thought that they possessed them, so far as I was\r\nconcerned, added another terror to life. The prospect of going into\r\nbattle with those wild axemen letting off bullets in every direction\r\nwas not pleasant, but fortunately when that crisis came, they cast them\r\naway and reverted to the weapons to which they were accustomed.\r\n\r\nNow all this sounds much like a tale of disaster, or at any rate of\r\nfailure. It is, however, wonderful by what strange ways good results\r\nare brought about, so much so that at times I think that these seeming\r\naccidents must be arranged by an Intelligence superior to our own, to\r\nfulfil through us purposes of which we know nothing, and frequently, be\r\nit admitted, of a nature sufficiently obscure. Of course this is a\r\nfatalistic doctrine, but then, as I have said before, within certain\r\nlimits I am a fatalist.\r\n\r\nTo take the present case, for instance, the whole Inez episode at first\r\nsight might appear to be an excrescence on my narrative, of which the\r\nobject is to describe how I met a certain very wonderful woman and what\r\nI heard and experienced in her company. Yet it is not really so, since\r\nhad it not been for the Inez adventure, it is quite clear that I should\r\nnever have reached the home of this woman, if woman she were, or have\r\nseen her at all. Before long this became very obvious to me, as shall\r\nbe told.\r\n\r\nFrom the night upon which Hans and I failed to rescue Inez we had no\r\nmore difficulty in following the trail of the cannibals, who\r\nthenceforward were never more than a few hours ahead of us and had no\r\ntime to be careful or to attempt to hide their spoor. Yet so fast did\r\nthey travel that do what we would, burdened and wearied as we were, it\r\nproved impossible to overtake them.\r\n\r\nFor the first three days the track ran on through scattered, rolling\r\nbush-veld of the character that I have described, but tending\r\ncontinually down hill. When we broke camp on the morning of the fourth\r\nday, eating a hasty meal at dawn (for now game had become astonishingly\r\nplentiful, so that we did not lack food) the rising sun showed beneath\r\nus an endless sea of billowy mist stretching in every direction far as\r\nthe sight could carry.\r\n\r\nTo the north, however, it did come to an end, for there, as I judged\r\nfifty or sixty miles away, rose the grim outline of what looked like a\r\nhuge fortress, which I knew must be one of those extraordinary mountain\r\nformations, probably owing their origin to volcanic action, that are to\r\nbe met with here and there in the vast expanses of Central and Eastern\r\nAfrica. Being so distant it was impossible to estimate its size, which\r\nI guessed must be enormous, but in looking at it I bethought me of that\r\ngreat mountain in which Zikali said the marvellous white Queen lived,\r\nand wondered whether it could be the same, as from my memory of his map\r\nupon the ashes, it well might be, that is, if such a place existed at\r\nall. If so the map had shown it as surrounded by swamps and—well,\r\nsurely that mist hid the face of a mighty swamp?\r\n\r\nIt did indeed, since before nightfall, following the spoor of those\r\nAmahagger, we had plunged into a morass so vast that in all my\r\nexperience I have never seen or heard of its like. It was a veritable\r\nocean of papyrus and other reeds, some of them a dozen or more feet\r\nhigh, so that it was impossible to see a yard in any direction.\r\n\r\nHere it was that the Amahagger ahead of us proved our salvation, since\r\nwithout them to guide us we must soon have perished. For through that\r\ngigantic swamp there ran a road, as I think an ancient road, since in\r\none or two places I saw stone work which must have been laid by man.\r\nYet it was not a road which it would have been possible to follow\r\nwithout a guide, seeing that it also was overgrown with reeds. Indeed,\r\nthe only difference between it and the surrounding swamp was that on\r\nthe road the soil was comparatively firm, that is to say, one seldom\r\nsank into it above the knee, whereas on either side of it quagmires\r\nwere often apparently bottomless, and what is more, partook of the\r\nnature of quicksand.\r\n\r\nThis we found out soon after we entered the swamp, since Robertson,\r\npushing forward with the fierce eagerness which seemed to consume him,\r\nneglected to keep his eye upon the spoor and stepped off the edge on to\r\nland that appeared to be exactly similar to its surface. Instantly he\r\nbegan to sink in greasy and tenacious mud. Umslopogaas and I were only\r\ntwenty yards behind, yet by the time we reached him in answer to his\r\nshouts, already he was engulfed up to his middle and going down so\r\nrapidly that in another minute he would have vanished altogether. Well,\r\nwe got him out but not with ease, for that mud clung to him like the\r\ntentacles of an octopus. After this we were more careful.\r\n\r\nNor did this road run straight; on the contrary, it curved about and\r\nsometimes turned at right angles, doubtless to avoid a piece of swamp\r\nover which it had proved impossible for the ancients to construct a\r\ncauseway, or to follow some out-crop of harder soil beneath.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of that horrible place are beyond description, and\r\nindeed can scarcely be imagined. First there was that of a kind of\r\ngrass which grew among the roots of the reeds and had edges like to\r\nthose of knives. As Robertson and I wore gaiters we did not suffer so\r\nmuch from it, but the poor Zulus with their bare legs were terribly cut\r\nabout and in some cases lame.\r\n\r\nThen there were the mosquitoes which lived here by the million and all\r\nseemed anxious for a bite; also snakes of a peculiarly deadly kind were\r\nnumerous. A Zulu was bitten by one of them of so poisonous a nature\r\nthat he died within three minutes, for the venom seemed to go straight\r\nto his heart. We threw his body into the swamp, where it vanished at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nLastly there was the all-pervading stench and the intolerable heat of\r\nthe place, since no breath of air could penetrate that forest of reeds,\r\nwhile a minor trouble was that of the multitude of leeches which\r\nfastened on to our bodies. By looking one could see the creatures\r\nsitting on the under side of leaves with their heads stretched out\r\nwaiting to attack anything that went by. As wayfarers there could not\r\nhave been numerous, I wondered what they had lived on for the last few\r\nthousand years. By the way, I found that paraffin, of which we had a\r\nsmall supply for our hand-lamps, rubbed over all exposed surfaces, was\r\nto some extent a protection against these blood-sucking worms and the\r\ngnats, although it did make one go about smelling like a dirty oil tin.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, except for the occasional rush of some great iguana or\r\nother reptile, and the sound of the wings of the flocks of wildfowl\r\npassing over us from time to time, the march was deathly silent. But at\r\nnight it was different, for then the bull-frogs boomed incessantly, as\r\ndid the bitterns, while great swamp owls and other night-flying birds\r\nuttered their weird cries. Also there were mysterious sucking noises\r\ncaused, no doubt, by the sinking of areas of swamp, with those of\r\nbursting bubbles of foul, up-rushing gas.\r\n\r\nStrange lights, too, played about, will-o’-the-wisps or St. Elmo fires,\r\nas I believe they are called, that frightened the Zulus very much,\r\nsince they believed them to be spirits of the dead. Perhaps this\r\nsuperstition had something to do with their native legend that mankind\r\nwas “torn out of the reeds.” If so, they may have imagined that the\r\nghosts of men went back to the reeds, of which there were enough here\r\nto accommodate those of the entire Zulu nation. Any way they were much\r\nscared; even the bold witch-doctor, Goroko, was scared and went through\r\nincantations with the little bag of medicines he carried to secure\r\nprotection for himself and his companions. Indeed, I think even the\r\niron Umslopogaas himself was not as comfortable as he might have been,\r\nalthough he did inform me that he had come out to fight and did not\r\ncare whether it were with man, or wizard, or spirit.\r\n\r\nIn short, of all the journeys that I have made, with the exception of\r\nthe passage of the desert on our way to King Solomon’s Mines, I think\r\nthat through this enormous swamp was the most miserable. Heartily did I\r\ncurse myself for ever having undertaken such a quest in a wild attempt\r\nto allay that sickness, or rather to quench that thirst of the soul\r\nwhich, I imagine, at times assails most of those who have hearts and\r\nthink or dream.\r\n\r\nFor this was at the bottom of the business: this it was which had\r\ndelivered me into the hands of Zikali, Opener-of-Roads, who, as now I\r\nam sure, was merely making use of me for his private occult purposes.\r\nHe desired to consult the distant Oracle, if such a person existed, as\r\nto great schemes of his own, and therefore, to attain his end, made use\r\nof my secret longings which I had been so foolish as to reveal to him,\r\nquite careless of what happened to me in the process. [A bit narrow and\r\nuncharitable, this view. It seems to me that Zikali is taking a big\r\nrisk in giving him the Great Medicine.—JB]\r\n\r\nWell, I was in for the business and must follow it to the finish\r\nwhatever that might be. After all it was very interesting and if there\r\nwere anything in what Zikali said (if there were not I could not\r\nconceive what object he had in sending me on such a wild-goose chase\r\nthrough this home of geese and ducks), it might become more interesting\r\nstill. For being pretty well fever-proof I did not think I should die\r\nin that morass, as of course nine white men out of ten would have done,\r\nand, beyond it lay the huge mountain which day by day grew larger and\r\nclearer.\r\n\r\nNor did Hans, who, with a childlike trust, pinned his faith to the\r\nGreat Medicine. This, he remarked, was the worst veld through which he\r\nhad ever travelled, but as the Great Medicine would never consent to be\r\nburied in that stinking mud, he had no doubt that we should come safely\r\nthrough it some time. I replied that this wonderful medicine of his had\r\nnot saved one of our companions who had now made a grave in the same\r\nmud.\r\n\r\n“No, Baas,” he said, “but those Zulus have nothing to do with the\r\nMedicine which was given to you, and to me who accompanied you when we\r\nsaw the Opener-of-Roads. Therefore perhaps they will all die, except\r\nUmslopogaas, whom you were told to take with you. If so, what does it\r\nmatter, since there are plenty of Zulus, although there be but one\r\nMacumazahn or one Hans? Also the Baas may remember that he began by\r\noffending a snake and therefore it is quite natural that this snake’s\r\nbrother should have bitten the Zulu.”\r\n\r\n“If you are right, he should have bitten me, Hans.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, and so no doubt he would have done had you not been\r\nprotected by the Great Medicine, and me too had not my grandfather been\r\na snake-charmer, to say nothing of the smell of the Medicine being on\r\nme as well. The snakes know those that they should bite, Baas.”\r\n\r\n“So do the mosquitoes,” I answered, grabbing a handful of them. “The\r\nGreat Medicine has no effect upon them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, Baas, it has, since though it pleases them to bite, the bites\r\ndo us no harm, or at least not much, and all are made happy. Still, I\r\nwish we could get out of these reeds of which I never want to see\r\nanother, and Baas, please keep your rifle ready for I think I hear a\r\ncrocodile stirring there.”\r\n\r\n“No need, Hans,” I remarked sarcastically. “Go and tell him that I have\r\nthe Great Medicine.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, I will; also that if he is very hungry, there are some\r\nZulus camped a few yards further down the road,” and he went solemnly\r\nto the reeds a little way off and began to talk to them.\r\n\r\n“You infernal donkey!” I murmured, and drew my blanket over my head in\r\na vain attempt to keep out the mosquitoes and smoking furiously with\r\nthe same object, tried to get to sleep.\r\n\r\nAt last the swamp bottom began to slope upwards a little, with the\r\nresult that as the land dried through natural drainage, the reeds grew\r\nthinner by degrees, until finally they ceased and we found ourselves on\r\nfirmer ground; indeed, upon the lowest slopes of the great mountain\r\nthat I have mentioned, that now towered above us, forbidden and\r\nmajestic.\r\n\r\nI had made a little map in my pocket-book of the various twists and\r\nturns of the road through that vast Slough of Despond, marking them\r\nfrom hour to hour as we followed its devious wanderings. On studying\r\nthis at the end of that part of our journey I realised afresh how\r\nutterly impossible it would have been for us to thread that misty maze\r\nwhere a few false steps would always have meant death by suffocation,\r\nhad it not been for the spoor of those Amahagger travelling immediately\r\nahead of us who were acquainted with its secrets. Had they been\r\nfriendly guides they could not have done us a better turn.\r\n\r\nWhat I wondered was why they had not tried to ambush us in the reeds,\r\nsince our fires must have shown them that we were close upon their\r\nheels. That they did try to burn us out was clear from certain\r\nevidences that I found, but fortunately at this season of the year in\r\nthe absence of a strong wind the rank reeds were too green to catch\r\nfire. For the rest I was soon to learn the reason of their neglect to\r\nattack us in that dense cover.\r\n\r\nThey were waiting for a better opportunity!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE ATTACK\r\n\r\n\r\nWe won out of the reeds at last, for which I fervently thanked God,\r\nsince to have crossed that endless marsh unguided, with the loss of\r\nonly one man, seemed little less than miraculous. We emerged from them\r\nlate in the afternoon and being wearied out, stopped for a while to\r\nrest and eat of the flesh of a buck that I had been fortunate enough to\r\nshoot upon their fringe. Then we pushed forward up the slope, proposing\r\nto camp for the night on the crest of it a mile or so away where I\r\nthought we should escape from the deadly mist in which we had been\r\nenveloped for so long, and obtain a clear view of the country ahead.\r\n\r\nFollowing the bank of a stream which here ran down into the marsh, we\r\ncame at length to this crest just as the sun was sinking. Below us lay\r\na deep valley, a fold, as it were, in the skin of the mountain, well\r\nbut not densely bushed. The woods of this valley climbed up the\r\nmountain flank for some distance above it and then gave way to grassy\r\nslopes that ended in steep sides of rock, which were crowned by a black\r\nand frowning precipice of unknown height.\r\n\r\nThere was, I remember, something very impressive about this towering\r\nnatural wall, which seemed to shut off whatever lay beyond the gaze of\r\nman, as though it veiled an ancient mystery. Indeed, the aspect of it\r\nthrilled me, I knew not why. I observed, however, that at one point in\r\nthe mighty cliff there seemed to be a narrow cleft down which, no\r\ndoubt, lava had flowed in a remote age, and it occurred to me that up\r\nthis cleft ran a roadway, probably a continuation of that by which we\r\nhad threaded the swamp. The fact that through my glasses I could see\r\nherds of cattle grazing on the slopes of the mountain went to confirm\r\nthis view, since cattle imply owners and herdsmen, and search as I\r\nwould, I could find no native villages on the slopes. The inference\r\nseemed to be that those owners dwelt beyond or within the mountain.\r\n\r\nAll of these things I saw and pointed out to Robertson in the light of\r\nthe setting sun.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Umslopogaas had been engaged in selecting the spot where we\r\nwere to camp for the night. Some soldierlike instinct, or perchance\r\nsome prescience of danger, caused him to choose a place particularly\r\nsuitable to defence. It was on a steep-sided mound that more or less\r\nresembled a gigantic ant-heap. Upon one side this mound was protected\r\nby the stream which because of a pool was here rather deep, while at\r\nthe back of it stood a collection of those curious and piled-up\r\nwater-worn rocks that are often to be found in Africa. These rocks,\r\nlying one upon another like the stones of a Cyclopean wall, curved\r\nround the western side of the mound, so that practically it was only\r\nopen for a narrow space, say thirty or forty feet, upon that face of it\r\nwhich looked on to the mountain.\r\n\r\n“Umslopogaas expects battle,” remarked Hans to me with a grin,\r\n“otherwise with all this nice plain round us he would not have chosen\r\nto camp in a place which a few men could hold against many. Yes, Baas,\r\nhe thinks that those cannibals are going to attack us.”\r\n\r\n“Stranger things have happened,” I answered indifferently, and having\r\nseen to the rifles, went to lie down, observing as I did so that the\r\ntired Zulus seemed already to be asleep. Only Umslopogaas did not\r\nsleep. On the contrary, he stood leaning on his axe staring at the dim\r\noutlines of the opposing precipice.\r\n\r\n“A strange mountain, Macumazahn,” he said, “compared to it that of the\r\nWitch, beneath which my kraal lies, is but a little baby. I wonder what\r\nwe shall find within it. I have always loved mountains, Macumazahn,\r\never since a dead brother of mine and I lived with the wolves in the\r\nWitch’s lap, for on them I have had the best of my fighting.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it is not done with yet,” I answered wearily.\r\n\r\n“I hope not, Macumazahn, since some is due for us, after all these days\r\nof mud and stench. Sleep a while now, Macumazahn, for that head of\r\nyours which you use so much, must need rest. Fear not, I and the little\r\nyellow man who do not think as much as you do, will keep watch and wake\r\nyou if there is need, as mayhap there will be before the dawn. Here\r\nnone can come at us except in front, and the place is narrow.”\r\n\r\nSo I lay down and slept as soundly as ever I had done in my life, for a\r\nspace of four or five hours I suppose. Then, by some instinct perhaps,\r\nI awoke suddenly, feeling much refreshed in that sweet mountain air, a\r\nnew man indeed, and in the moonlight saw Umslopogaas striding towards\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Arise, Macumazahn,” he said, “I hear men stirring below us.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Hans slipped past him, whispering,\r\n\r\n“The cannibals are coming, Baas, a good number of them. I think they\r\nmean to attack before dawn.”\r\n\r\nThen he passed behind me to warn the Zulus. As he went by, I said to\r\nhim,\r\n\r\n“If so, Hans, now is the time for your Great Medicine to show what it\r\ncan do.”\r\n\r\n“The Great Medicine will look after you and me all right, Baas,” he\r\nreplied, pausing and speaking in Dutch, which Umslopogaas did not\r\nunderstand, “but I expect there will be fewer of those Zulus to cook\r\nfor before the sun grows hot. Their spirits will be turned into snakes\r\nand go back into the reeds from which they say they were ‘torn out,’”\r\nhe added over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nI should explain that Hans acted as cook to our party and it was a\r\ngrievance with him that the Zulus ate so much of the meat which he was\r\ncalled upon to prepare. Indeed, there is never much sympathy between\r\nHottentots and Zulus.\r\n\r\n“What is the little yellow man saying about us?” asked Umslopogaas\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n“He is saying that if it comes to battle, you and your men will make a\r\ngreat fight,” I replied diplomatically.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we will do that, Macumazahn, but I thought he said that we should\r\nbe killed and that this pleased him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh dear no!” I answered hastily. “How could he be pleased if that\r\nhappened, since then he would be left defenceless, if he were not\r\nkilled too. Now, Umslopogaas, let us make a plan for this fight.”\r\n\r\nSo, together with Robertson, rapidly we discussed the thing. As a\r\nresult, with the help of the Zulus, we dragged together some loose\r\nstones and the tops of three small thorn trees which we had cut down,\r\nand with them made a low breastwork, sufficient to give us some\r\nprotection if we lay down to shoot. It was the work of a few minutes\r\nsince we had prepared the material when we camped in case an emergency\r\nshould arise.\r\n\r\nBehind this breastwork we gathered and waited, Robertson and I being\r\ncareful to get a little to the rear of the Zulus, who it will be\r\nremembered had the rifles which the Strathmuir bastards had left behind\r\nthem when they bolted, in addition to their axes and throwing assegais.\r\nThe question was how these cannibals would fight. I knew that they were\r\narmed with long spears and knives but I did not know if they used those\r\nspears for thrusting or for throwing. In the former case it would be\r\ndifficult to get at them with the axes because they must have the\r\nlonger reach. Fortunately as it turned out, they did both.\r\n\r\nAt length all was ready and there came that long and trying wait, the\r\nmost disagreeable part of a fight in which one grows nervous and begins\r\nto reflect earnestly upon one’s sins. Clearly the Amahagger, if they\r\nreally intended business, did not mean to attack till just before dawn,\r\nafter the common native fashion, thinking to rush us in the low and\r\npuzzling light. What perplexed me was that they should wish to attack\r\nus at all after having let so many opportunities of doing so go by.\r\nApparently these men were now in sight of their own home, where no\r\ndoubt they had many friends, and by pushing on could reach its shelter\r\nbefore us, especially as they knew the roads and we did not.\r\n\r\nThey had come out for a secret purpose that seemed to have to do with\r\nthe abduction of a certain young white woman for reasons connected with\r\ntheir tribal statecraft or ritual, which is the kind of thing that\r\nhappens not infrequently among obscure and ancient African tribes.\r\nWell, they had abducted their young woman and were in sight of safety\r\nand success in their objects, whatever these might be. For what\r\npossible reason, then, could they desire to risk a fight with the\r\noutraged friends and relatives of that young woman?\r\n\r\nIt was true that they outnumbered us and therefore had a good chance of\r\nvictory, but on the other hand, they must know that it would be very\r\ndearly won, and if it were not won, that we should retake their\r\ncaptive, so that all their trouble would have been for nothing. Further\r\nthey must be as exhausted and travel-worn as we were ourselves and in\r\nno condition to face a desperate battle.\r\n\r\nThe problem was beyond me and I gave it up with the reflection that\r\neither this threatened attack was a mere feint to delay us, or that\r\nbehind it was something mysterious, such as a determination to prevent\r\nus at all hazards from discovering the secrets of that mountain\r\nstronghold.\r\n\r\nWhen I put the riddle to Hans, who was lying next to me, he was ready\r\nwith another solution.\r\n\r\n“They are men-eaters, Baas,” he said, “and being hungry, wish to eat us\r\nbefore they get to their own land where doubtless they are not allowed\r\nto eat each other.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so,” I answered, “when we are so thin?” and I surveyed\r\nHans’ scraggy form in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, Baas, we should be quite good boiled—like old hens, Baas.\r\nAlso it is the nature of cannibals to prefer thin man to fat beef. The\r\ndevil that is in them gives them that taste, Baas, just as he makes me\r\nlike gin, or you turn your head to look at pretty women, as those Zulus\r\nsay you always did in their country, especially at a certain witch who\r\nwas named Mameena and whom you kissed before everybody——”\r\n\r\nHere I turned my head to look at Hans, proposing to smite him with\r\nwords, or physically, since to have this Mameena myth, of which I have\r\ndetailed the origin in the book called _Child of Storm_, re-arise out\r\nof his hideous little mouth was too much. But before I could get out a\r\nsyllable he held up his finger and whispered,\r\n\r\n“Hush! the dawn breaks and they come. I hear them.”\r\n\r\nI listened intently but could distinguish nothing. Only straining my\r\neyes, presently I thought that about a hundred yards down the slope\r\nbeneath us in the dim light I caught sight of ghostlike figures\r\nflitting from tree to tree; also that these figures were drawing\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\n“Look out!” I said to Robertson on my right, “I believe they are\r\ncoming.”\r\n\r\n“Man,” he answered sternly, “I hope so, for whom else have I wanted to\r\nmeet all these days?”\r\n\r\nNow the figures vanished into a little fold of the ground. A minute or\r\nso later they re-appeared upon its hither side where such light as\r\nthere was from the fading stars and the gathering dawn fell full upon\r\nthem, for here were no trees. I looked and a thrill of horror went\r\nthrough me, for with one glance I recognised that these were _not the\r\nmen whom we had been following_. To begin with, there were many more of\r\nthem, quite a hundred, I should think, also they had painted shields,\r\nwore feathers in their hair, and generally so far as I could judge,\r\nseemed to be fat and fresh.\r\n\r\n“We have been led into an ambush,” I said first in Zulu to Umslopogaas\r\nimmediately in front, and then in English to Robertson.\r\n\r\n“If so, man, we must just do the best we can,” answered the latter,\r\n“but God help my poor daughter, for those other devils will have taken\r\nher away, leaving their brethren to make an end of us.”\r\n\r\n“It is so, Macumazahn,” broke in Umslopogaas. “Well, whatever the end\r\nof it, we shall have a better fight. Now do you give the word and we\r\nwill obey.”\r\n\r\nThe savages, for so I call them, although I admit that cannibals or\r\nnot, they looked more like high-class Arabs than savages, came on in\r\nperfect silence, hoping, I suppose, to catch us asleep. When they were\r\nabout fifty yards away, running in a treble line with spears advanced,\r\nI called out “Fire!” in Zulu, and set the example by loosing off both\r\nbarrels of my express rifle at men whom I had picked out as leaders,\r\nwith results that must have been more satisfactory to me than to the\r\ntwo Amahagger whose troubles in this world came to an end.\r\n\r\nThere followed a tremendous fusillade, the Zulus banging off their guns\r\nwildly, but even at that distance managing for the most part to shoot\r\nover the enemy’s heads. Captain Robertson and Hans, however, did better\r\nand the general result was that the Amahagger, who appeared to be\r\nunaccustomed to firearms, retreated in a hurry to a fold of the ground\r\nwhence they had emerged. Before the last of them got there I loaded\r\nagain, so that two more stopped behind. Altogether we had put nine or\r\nten of them out of action.\r\n\r\nNow I hoped that they would give the business up. But this was not so,\r\nfor being brave fellows, after a pause of perhaps five minutes, once\r\nmore they charged in a body, hoping to overwhelm us. Again we greeted\r\nthem with bullets and knocked out several, whereon the rest threw a\r\nvolley of their long spears at us. I was glad to see them do this\r\nalthough one of the Zulus got his death from it, while two more were\r\nwounded. I myself had a very narrow escape, for a spear passed between\r\nmy neck and shoulder. Each of them carried but one of these weapons and\r\nI knew that if they used them up in throwing, only their big knives\r\nwould remain to them with which to attack us.\r\n\r\nAfter this discharge of spears which was kept up for some time, they\r\nrushed at us and there followed a great fight. The Zulus, throwing down\r\ntheir guns, rose to their feet and holding their little fighting\r\nshields which had been carried in their mats, in the left hand, wielded\r\ntheir axes with the right. Umslopogaas, who stood in the centre of\r\nthem, however, had no shield and swung his great axe with both arms.\r\nThis was the first time that I had seen him fight and the spectacle was\r\nin a way magnificent. Again and again the axe crashed down and every\r\ntime it fell it left one dead beneath the stroke, till at length those\r\nAmahagger shrank back out of his reach.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Robertson, Hans and I, standing on some stones at the back,\r\nkept up a continual fire upon them, shooting over the heads of the\r\nZulus, who were playing their part like men. Yes, they shrank back,\r\nleaving many dead behind them. Then a captain tried to gather them for\r\nanother rush, and once more they moved forward. I killed that captain\r\nwith a revolver shot, for my rifle had become too hot to hold, and at\r\nthe sight of his fall, they broke and ran back into the little hollow\r\nwhere our bullets could not reach them.\r\n\r\nSo far we had held our own, but at a price, for three of the Zulus were\r\nnow dead and three more wounded, one of them severely, the other two\r\nbut enough to cripple them. In fact, now there were left of them but\r\nthree untouched men, and Umslopogaas, so that in all for fighting\r\npurposes we were but seven. What availed it that we had killed a great\r\nnumber of these Amahagger, when we were but seven? How could seven men\r\nwithstand such another onslaught?\r\n\r\nThere in the pale light of the dawn we looked at each other dismayed.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Umslopogaas, leaning on his red axe, “there remains but one\r\nthing to do, make a good end, though I would that it were in a greater\r\ncause. At least we must either fight or fly,” and he looked down at the\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\n“Think not of us, Father,” murmured one of them, the man who had a\r\nmortal hurt. “If it is best, kill us and begone that you may live to\r\nbear the Axe in years to come.”\r\n\r\n“Well spoken!” said Umslopogaas, and again stood still a while, then\r\nadded, “The word is with you, Macumazahn, who are our captain.”\r\n\r\nI set out the situation to Robertson and Hans as briefly as I could,\r\nshowing that there was a chance of life if we ran, but so far as I\r\ncould see, none if we stayed.\r\n\r\n“Go if you like, Quatermain,” answered the Captain, “but I shall stop\r\nand die here, for since my girl is gone I think I’m better dead.”\r\n\r\nI motioned to Hans to speak.\r\n\r\n“Baas,” he answered, “the Great Medicine is here with us upon the earth\r\nand your reverend father, the Predikant, is with us in the sky, so I\r\nthink we had better stop here and do what we can, especially as I do\r\nnot want to see those reeds any more at present.”\r\n\r\n“So do I,” I said briefly, giving no reasons.\r\n\r\nSo we made ready for the next attack which we knew would be the last,\r\nstrengthening our little wall and dragging the dead Amahagger up\r\nagainst it as an added protection. As we were thus engaged the sun rose\r\nand in its first beams, some miles away on the opposing slopes of the\r\nmountain looking tiny against the black background of the precipice, we\r\nsaw a party of men creeping forward. Lifting my glasses I studied it\r\nand perceived that in its midst was a litter.\r\n\r\n“There goes your daughter,” I said, and handed the glasses to\r\nRobertson.\r\n\r\n“Oh! my God,” he answered, “those villains have outwitted us after\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nAnother minute and the litter, or rather the chair with its escort, had\r\nvanished into the shadow of the great cliffs, probably up some pass\r\nwhich we could not see.\r\n\r\nNext moment our thoughts were otherwise engaged, since from various\r\nsymptoms we gathered that the attack was about to be renewed. Spears\r\nupon which shone the light of the rising sun, appeared above the edge\r\nof the ground-fold that I have mentioned, which to the east increased\r\nto a deep, bush-clad ravine. Also there were voices as of leaders\r\nencouraging their men to a desperate effort.\r\n\r\n“They are coming,” I said to Robertson.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, “they are coming and we are going. It’s a queer end\r\nto the thing we call life, isn’t it, Quatermain, and hang it all! I\r\nwonder what’s beyond? Not much for me, I expect, but whatever it is\r\ncould scarcely be worse than what I’ve gone through here below in one\r\nway and another.”\r\n\r\n“There’s hope for all of us,” I replied as cheerfully as I could, for\r\nthe man’s deep depression disturbed me.\r\n\r\n“Mayhap, Quatermain, for who knows the infinite mercy of whatever made\r\nus as we are? My old mother used to preach of it and I remember her\r\nwords now. But in my case I expect it will stop at hope, or sleep, and\r\nif it wasn’t for Inez, I’d not mind so much, for I tell you I’ve had\r\nenough of the world and life. Look, there’s one of them. Take that, you\r\nblack devil!” and lifting his rifle he aimed and fired at an Amahagger\r\nwho appeared upon the edge of the fold of ground. What is more he hit\r\nhim, for I saw the man double up and fall backwards.\r\n\r\nThen the game began afresh, for the cannibals (I suppose they were\r\ncannibals like their brethren) crept out of shelter, advancing on their\r\nstomachs or their hands and knees, so as to offer a smaller mark, and\r\ndragging between them a long and slender tree-trunk with which clearly\r\nthey intended to batter down our wall.\r\n\r\nOf course I blazed away at them, pretty carefully too, for I was\r\ndetermined that what I believed to be the last exercise of the gift of\r\nshooting that has been given to me, should prove a record. Therefore I\r\nselected my men and even where I would hit them, and as subsequent\r\nexamination showed, I made no mistakes in the seven or eight shots that\r\nI fired. But all the while, like poor Captain Robertson, I was thinking\r\nof other things; namely, where I was bound for presently and if I\r\nshould meet certain folk there and what was the meaning of this show\r\ncalled Life, which unless it leads somewhere, according to my judgment\r\nhas none at all. Until these questions were solved, however, my duty\r\nwas to kill as many of those ruffians as I could, and this I did with\r\nfinish and despatch.\r\n\r\nRobertson and Hans were firing also, with more or less success, but\r\nthere were too many to be stopped by our three rifles. Still they came\r\non till at length their fierce faces were within a few yards of our\r\nlittle parapet and Umslopogaas had lifted his great axe to give them\r\ngreeting. They paused a moment before making their final rush, and so\r\ndid we to slip in fresh cartridges.\r\n\r\n“Die well, Hans,” I said, “and if you get there first, wait for me on\r\nthe other side.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, I always meant to do that, though not yet. We are not going\r\nto die this time, Baas. Those who have the Great Medicine don’t die; it\r\nis the others who die, like that fellow,” and he pointed to an\r\nAmahagger who went reeling round and round with a bullet from his\r\nWinchester through the middle, for he had fired in the midst of his\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n“Curse—I mean bless—the Great Medicine,” I said as I lifted my rifle to\r\nmy shoulder.\r\n\r\nAt that moment all those Amahagger—there were about sixty of them\r\nleft—became seized with a certain perturbation. They stood still, they\r\nstared towards the fold of ground out of which they had emerged; they\r\ncalled to each other words which I did not catch, and then—they turned\r\nto run.\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas saw, and with a leader’s instinct, acted. Springing over\r\nthe parapet, followed by his remaining Zulus of the Axe, he leapt upon\r\nthem with a roar. Down they went before _Inkosikaas_, like corn before\r\na sickle. The thing was marvellous to see, it was like the charge of a\r\nleopard, so swift was the rush and so lightning-like were the strokes\r\nor rather the pecks of that flashing axe, for now he was tapping at\r\ntheir heads or spines with the gouge-like point upon its back. Nor were\r\nthese the only victims, for those brave followers of his also did their\r\npart. In a minute all who remained upon their feet of the Amahagger\r\nwere in full flight, vanishing this way and that among the trees. Hans\r\nfired a parting shot after the last of them, then sat down upon a stone\r\nand finding his corn-cob pipe, proceeded to fill it.\r\n\r\n“The Great Medicine, Baas,” he began sententiously, “or perhaps your\r\nreverend father, the Predikant——” Here he paused and pointed doubtfully\r\nwith the bowl of the pipe towards the fold in the ground, adding, “Here\r\nit is, but I think it must be your reverend father, not the Great\r\nMedicine, yes, the Predikant himself, returned from Heaven, the Place\r\nof Fires!”\r\n\r\nLooking vaguely in the direction indicated, for I could not conceive\r\nwhat he meant and thought that the excitement must have made him mad, I\r\nperceived a venerable old man with a long white beard and clothed in a\r\nflowing garment, also white, who reminded me of Father Christmas at a\r\nchild’s party, walking towards us and radiating benignancy. Also behind\r\nhim I perceived a whole forest of spear points emerging from the gully.\r\nHe seemed to take it for granted that we should not shoot at him, for\r\nhe came on quite unconcerned, carefully picking his way among the\r\ncorpses. When he was near enough he stopped and said in a kind of\r\nArabic which I could understand,\r\n\r\n“I greet you, Strangers, in the name of her I serve. I see that I am\r\njust in time, but this does not surprise me, since she said that it\r\nwould be so. You seem to have done very well with these dogs,” and he\r\nprodded a dead Amahagger with his sandalled foot. “Yes, very well\r\nindeed. You must be great warriors.”\r\n\r\nThen he paused and we stared at each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHROUGH THE MOUNTAIN WALL\r\n\r\n\r\n“These do not seem to be friends of yours,” I said, pointing to the\r\nfallen. “And yet,” I added, nodding towards the spearmen who were now\r\nemerging from the gully, “they are very like your friends.”\r\n\r\n“Puppies from the same litter are often alike, yet when they grow up\r\nsometimes they fight each other,” replied Father Christmas blandly. “At\r\nleast these come to save and not to kill you. Look! they kill the\r\nothers!” and he pointed to them making an end of some of the wounded\r\nmen. “But who are these?” and he glanced with evident astonishment,\r\nfirst at the fearsome-looking Umslopogaas and then at the grotesque\r\nHans. “Nay, answer not, you must be weary and need rest. Afterwards we\r\ncan talk.”\r\n\r\n“Well, as a matter of fact we have not yet breakfasted,” I replied.\r\n“Also I have business to attend to here,” and I glanced at our wounded.\r\n\r\nThe old fellow nodded and went to speak to the captains of his force,\r\ndoubtless as to the pursuit of the enemy, for presently I saw a company\r\nspring forward on their tracks. Then, assisted by Hans and the\r\nremaining Zulus, of whom one was Goroko, I turned to attend to our own\r\npeople. The task proved lighter than I expected, since the badly\r\ninjured man was dead or dying and the hurts of the two others were in\r\ntheir legs and comparatively slight, such as Goroko could doctor in his\r\nown native fashion.\r\n\r\nAfter this, taking Hans to guard my back, I went down to the stream and\r\nwashed myself. Then I returned and ate, wondering the while that I\r\ncould do so with appetite after the terrible dangers which we had\r\npassed. Still, we had passed them, and Robertson, Umslopogaas with\r\nthree of his men, I and Hans were quite unharmed, a fact for which I\r\nreturned thanks in silence but sincerely enough to Providence.\r\n\r\nHans also returned thanks in his own fashion, after he had filled\r\nhimself, not before, and lit his corn-cob pipe. But Robertson made no\r\nremark; indeed, when he had satisfied his natural cravings, he rose and\r\nwalking a few paces forward, stood staring at the cleft in the mountain\r\ncliff into which he had seen the litter vanish that bore his daughter\r\nto some fate unknown.\r\n\r\nEven the great fight that we had fought and the victory we had won\r\nagainst overpowering odds did not appear to impress him. He only glared\r\nat the mountain into the heart of which Inez had been raped away, and\r\nshook his fist. Since she was gone all else went for nothing, so much\r\nso that he did not offer to assist with the wounded Zulus or show\r\ncuriosity about the strange old man by whom we had been rescued.\r\n\r\n“The Great Medicine, Baas,” said Hans in a bewildered way, “is even\r\nmore powerful than I thought. Not only has it brought us safely through\r\nthe fighting and without a scratch, for those Zulus there do not matter\r\nand there will be less cooking for me to do now that they are gone; it\r\nhas also brought down your reverend father the Predikant from the Place\r\nof Fires in Heaven, somewhat changed from what I remember him, it is\r\ntrue, but still without doubt the same. When I make my report to him\r\npresently, if he can understand my talk, I shall——”\r\n\r\n“Stop your infernal nonsense, you son of a donkey,” I broke in, for at\r\nthis moment old Father Christmas, smiling more benignly than before,\r\nre-appeared from the kloof into which he had vanished and advanced\r\ntowards us bowing with much politeness.\r\n\r\nHaving seated himself upon the little wall that we had built up, he\r\ncontemplated us, stroking his beautiful white beard, then said,\r\naddressing me,\r\n\r\n“Of a certainty you should be proud who with a few have defeated so\r\nmany. Still, had I not been ordered to come at speed, I think that by\r\nnow you would have been as those are,” and he looked towards the dead\r\nZulus who were laid out at a distance like men asleep, while their\r\ncompanions sought for a place to bury them.\r\n\r\n“Ordered by whom?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“There is only one who can order,” he answered with mild astonishment.\r\n“‘She-who-commands, She-who-is-everlasting’!”\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that this must be some Arabic idiom for the Eternal\r\nFeminine, but I only looked vague and said,\r\n\r\n“It would appear that there are some whom this exalted everlasting She\r\ncannot command; those who attacked us; also those who have fled away\r\nyonder,” and I waved my hand towards the mountain.\r\n\r\n“No command is absolute; in every country there are rebels, even, as I\r\nhave heard, in Heaven above us. But, Wanderer, what is your name?”\r\n\r\n“Watcher-by-Night,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Ah! a good name for one who must have watched well by night, and by\r\nday too, to reach this country living where She-who-commands says that\r\nno man of your colour has set foot for many generations. Indeed, I\r\nthink she told me once that two thousand years had gone by since she\r\nspoke to a white man in the City of Kôr.”\r\n\r\n“Did she indeed?” I exclaimed, stifling a cough.\r\n\r\n“You do not believe me,” he went on, smiling. “Well, She-who-commands\r\ncan explain matters for herself better than I who was not alive two\r\nthousand years ago, so far as I remember. But what must I call him with\r\nthe Axe?”\r\n\r\n“Warrior is his name.”\r\n\r\n“Again a good name, as to judge by the wounds on them, certain of those\r\nrebels I think are now telling each other in Hell. And this man, if\r\nindeed he be a man——” he added, looking doubtfully at Hans.\r\n\r\n“Light-in-Darkness is his name.”\r\n\r\n“I see, doubtless because his colour is that of the winter sun in thick\r\nfog, or a bad egg broken into milk. And the other white man who mutters\r\nand whose brow is like a storm?”\r\n\r\n“He is called Avenger; you will learn why later on,” I answered\r\nimpatiently, for I grew tired of this catechism, adding, “And what are\r\nyou called and, if you are pleased to tell it to us, upon what errand\r\ndo you visit us in so fortunate an hour?”\r\n\r\n“I am named Billali,” he answered, “the servant and messenger of\r\nShe-who-commands, and I was sent to save you and to bring you safely to\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“How can this be, Billali, seeing that none knew of our coming?”\r\n\r\n“Yet She-who-commands knew,” he said with his benignant smile. “Indeed,\r\nI think that she learned of it some moons ago through a message that\r\nwas sent to her and so arranged all things that you should be guided\r\nsafely to her secret home; since otherwise how would you have passed a\r\ngreat pathless swamp with the loss, I think she said, of but one man\r\nwhom a snake bit?”\r\n\r\nNow I stared at the old fellow, for how could he know of the death of\r\nthis man, but thought it useless to pursue the conversation further.\r\n\r\n“When you are rested and ready,” he went on, “we will start. Meanwhile\r\nI leave you that I may prepare litters to carry those wounded men, and\r\nyou also, Watcher-by-Night, if you wish.” Then with a dignified bow,\r\nfor everything about this old fellow was stately, he turned and\r\nvanished into the kloof.\r\n\r\nThe next hour or so was occupied in the burial of the dead Zulus, a\r\nceremony in which I took no part beyond standing up and raising my hat\r\nas they were borne away, for as I have said somewhere, it is best to\r\nleave natives alone on these occasions. Indeed, I lay down, reflecting\r\nthat strangely enough there seemed to be something in old Zikali’s tale\r\nof a wonderful white Queen who lived in a mountain fastness, since\r\nthere was the mountain as he had drawn it on the ashes, and the\r\nservants of that Queen who, apparently, had knowledge of our coming,\r\nappeared in the nick of time to rescue us from one of the tightest\r\nfixes in which ever I found myself.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the antique and courteous individual called Billali, spoke of\r\nher as “She-who-is-everlasting.” What the deuce could he mean by that,\r\nI wondered? Probably that she was very old and therefore disagreeable\r\nto look on, which I confessed to myself would be a disappointment.\r\n\r\nAnd how did she know that we were coming? I could not guess and when I\r\nasked Robertson, he merely shrugged his shoulders and intimated that he\r\ntook no interest in the matter. The truth is that nothing moved the\r\nman, whose whole soul was wrapped in one desire, namely to rescue, or\r\navenge, the daughter against whom he knew he had so sorely sinned.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this loose-living but reformed seaman was becoming a\r\nmonomaniac, and what is more, one of the religious type. He had a Bible\r\nwith him that had been given to him by his mother when he was a boy,\r\nand in this he read constantly; also he was always on his knees and at\r\nnight I could hear him groaning and praying aloud. Doubtless now that\r\nthe chains of drink had fallen off him, the instincts and the blood of\r\nthe dour old Covenanters from whom he was descended, were asserting\r\nthemselves. In a way this was a good thing though for some time past I\r\nhad feared lest it should end in his going mad, and certainly as a\r\ncompanion he was more cheerful in his unregenerate days.\r\n\r\nAbandoning speculation as useless and taking my chance of being\r\nmurdered where I lay, for after all Billali’s followers were singularly\r\nlike the men with whom we had been fighting and for aught I knew might\r\nbe animated by identical objects—I just went to sleep, as I can do at\r\nany time, to wake up an hour or so later feeling wonderfully refreshed.\r\nHans, who when I closed my eyes was already asleep slumbering at my\r\nfeet curled up like a dog on a spot where the sun struck hotly, roused\r\nme by saying:\r\n\r\n“Awake, Baas, they are here!”\r\n\r\nI sprang up, snatching at my rifle, for I thought that he meant that we\r\nwere being attacked again, to see Billali advancing at the head of a\r\ntrain of four litters made of bamboo with grass mats for curtains and\r\ncoverings, each of which was carried by stalwart Amahagger, as I\r\nsupposed that they must be. Two of these, the finest, Billali indicated\r\nwere for Robertson and myself, and the two others for the wounded.\r\nUmslopogaas and the remaining Zulus evidently were expected to walk, as\r\nwas Hans.\r\n\r\n“How did you make these so quickly,” I asked, surveying their elegant\r\nand indeed artistic workmanship.\r\n\r\n“We did not make them, Watcher-by-Night, we brought them with us folded\r\nup. She-who-commands looked in her glass and said that four would be\r\nneeded, besides my own which is yonder, two for white lords and two for\r\nwounded black men, which you see is the number required.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered vaguely, marvelling what kind of a glass it was that\r\ngave the lady this information.\r\n\r\nBefore I could inquire upon the point Billali added,\r\n\r\n“You will be glad to learn that my men caught some of those rebels who\r\ndared to attack you, eight or ten of them who had been hurt by your\r\nmissiles or axe-cuts, and put them to death in the proper fashion—yes,\r\nquite the proper fashion,” and he smiled a little. “The rest had gone\r\ntoo far where it would have been dangerous to follow them among the\r\nrocks. Enter now, my lord Watcher-by-Night, for the road is steep and\r\nwe must travel fast if we would reach the place where She-who-commands\r\nis camped in the ancient holy city, before the moon sinks behind the\r\ncliffs to-night.”\r\n\r\nSo having explained matters to Robertson and Umslopogaas, who announced\r\nthat nothing would induce _him_ to be carried like an old woman, or a\r\ncorpse upon a shield, and seen that the hurt Zulus were comfortably\r\naccommodated, Robertson and I got into our litters, which proved to be\r\ndelightfully easy and restful.\r\n\r\nThen when our gear was collected by the hook-nosed bearers to whom we\r\nwere obliged to trust, though we kept with us our rifles and a certain\r\namount of ammunition, we started. First went a number of Billali’s\r\nspearmen, then came the litters with the wounded alongside of which\r\nUmslopogaas and his three uninjured Zulus stalked or trotted, then\r\nanother litter containing Billali, then my own by which ran Hans, and\r\nRobertson’s, and lastly the rest of the Amahagger and the relief\r\nbearers.\r\n\r\n“I see now, Baas,” said Hans, thrusting his head between my curtains,\r\n“that yonder Whitebeard cannot be your reverend father, the Predikant,\r\nafter all.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I asked, though the fact was fairly obvious.\r\n\r\n“Because, Baas, if he were, he would not have left Hans, of whom he\r\nalways thought so well, to run in the sun like a dog, while he and\r\nothers travel in carriages like great white ladies.”\r\n\r\n“You had better save your breath instead of talking nonsense, Hans,” I\r\nsaid, “since I believe that you have a long way to go.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, it proved to be a very long way indeed, especially as after we\r\nbegan to breast the mountain, we must travel slowly. We started about\r\nten o’clock in the morning, for the fight which after all did not take\r\nlong—had, it will be remembered, begun shortly after dawn, and it was\r\nthree in the afternoon before we reached the base of the towering cliff\r\nwhich I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nHere, at the foot of a remarkable, isolated column of rock, on which I\r\nwas destined to see a strange sight in the after days, we halted and\r\nate of the remaining food which we had brought with us, while the\r\nAmahagger consumed their own, that seemed to consist largely of curdled\r\nmilk, such as the Zulus call _maas_, and lumps of a kind of bread.\r\n\r\nI noted that they were a very curious people who fed in silence and on\r\nwhose handsome, solemn faces one never saw a smile. Somehow it gave me\r\nthe creeps to look at them. Robertson was affected in the same way, for\r\nin one of the rare intervals of his abstraction he remarked that they\r\nwere “no canny.” Then he added,\r\n\r\n“Ask yon old wizard who might be one of the Bible prophets come to\r\nlife—what those man-eating devils have done with my daughter.”\r\n\r\nI did so, and Billali answered,\r\n\r\n“Say that they have taken her away to make a queen of her, since having\r\nrebelled against their own queen, they must have another who is white.\r\nSay too that She-who-commands will wage war on them and perhaps win her\r\nback, unless they kill her first.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Robertson repeated when I had translated, “unless they kill her\r\nfirst—or worse.” Then he relapsed into his usual silence.\r\n\r\nPresently we started on again, heading straight for what looked like a\r\nsheer wall of black rock a thousand feet or more in height, up a path\r\nso steep that Robertson and I got out and walked, or rather scrambled,\r\nin order to ease the bearers. Billali, I noticed, remained in his\r\nlitter. The convenience of the bearers did not trouble him; he only\r\nordered an extra gang to the poles. I could not imagine how we were to\r\nnegotiate this precipice. Nor could Umslopogaas, who looked at it and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n“If we are to climb that, Macumazahn, I think that the only one who\r\nwill live to get to the top will be that little yellow monkey of\r\nyours,” and he pointed with his axe at Hans.\r\n\r\n“If I do,” replied that worthy, much nettled, for he hated to be called\r\na “yellow monkey” by the Zulus, “be sure that I will roll down stones\r\nupon any black butcher whom I see sprawling upon the cliff below.”\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas smiled grimly, for he had a sense of humour and could\r\nappreciate a repartee even when it hit him hard. Then we stopped\r\ntalking for the climb took all our breath.\r\n\r\nAt length we came to the cliff face where, to all appearance, our\r\njourney must end. Suddenly, however, out of the blind black wall in\r\nfront of us started the apparition of a tall man armed with a great\r\nspear and wearing a white robe, who challenged us hoarsely.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stood before us, as a ghost might do, though whence he came\r\nwe could not see. Presently the mystery was explained. Here in the\r\ncliff face there was a cleft, though one invisible even from a few\r\npaces away, since its outer edge projected over the inner wall of rock.\r\nMoreover, this opening was not above four feet in width, a mere split\r\nin the huge mountain mass caused by some titanic convulsion in past\r\nages. For it was a definite split since, once entered, far, far above\r\ncould be traced a faint line of light coming from the sky, although the\r\ngloom of the passage was such that torches, which were stored at hand,\r\nmust be used by those who threaded it. One man could have held the\r\nplace against a hundred—until he was killed. Still, it was guarded, not\r\nonly at the mouth where the warrior had appeared, but further along at\r\nevery turn in the jagged chasm, and these were many.\r\n\r\nInto this grim place we went. The Zulus did not like it at all, for\r\nthey are a light-loving people and I noted that even Umslopogaas seemed\r\nscared and hung back a little. Nor did Hans, who with his usual\r\nsuspicion, feared some trap; nor, for the matter of that, did I, though\r\nI thought it well to appear much interested. Only Robertson seemed\r\nquite indifferent and trudged along stolidly after a man carrying a\r\ntorch.\r\n\r\nOld Billali put his head out of the litter and shouted back to me to\r\nfear nothing, since there were no pitfalls in the path, his voice\r\nechoing strangely between those narrow walls of measureless height.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour or more we pursued this dreary, winding path round the\r\ncorners of which the draught tore in gusts so fierce that more than\r\nonce the litters with the wounded men and those who bore them were\r\nnearly blown over. It was safe enough, however, since on either side of\r\nus, smooth and without break, rose the sheer walls of rock over which\r\nlay the tiny ribbon of blue sky. At length the cleft widened somewhat\r\nand the light grew stronger, making the torches unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThen of a sudden we came to its end and found ourselves upon a little\r\nplateau in the mountainside. Behind us for a thousand feet or so rose\r\nthe sheer rock wall as it did upon the outer face, while in front and\r\nbeneath, far beneath, was a beautiful plain circular in shape and of\r\ngreat extent, which plain was everywhere surrounded, so far as I could\r\nsee, by the same wall of rock. In short, notwithstanding its enormous\r\nsize, without doubt it was neither more nor less than the crater of a\r\nvast extinct volcano. Lastly, not far from the centre of this plain was\r\nwhat appeared to be a city, since through my glasses I could see great\r\nwalls built of stone, and what I thought were houses, all of them of a\r\ncharacter more substantial than any that I had discovered in the wilds\r\nof Africa.\r\n\r\nI went to Billali’s litter and asked him who lived in the city.\r\n\r\n“No one,” he answered, “it has been dead for thousands of years, but\r\nShe-who-commands is camped there at present with an army, and thither\r\nwe go at once. Forward, bearers.”\r\n\r\nSo, Robertson and I having re-entered our litters, we started on down\r\nhill at a rapid pace, for the road, though steep, was safe and kept in\r\ngood order. All the rest of that afternoon we travelled and by sunset\r\nreached the edge of the plain, where we halted a while to rest and eat,\r\ntill the light of the growing moon grew strong enough to enable us to\r\nproceed. Umslopogaas came up and spoke to me.\r\n\r\n“Here is a fortress indeed, Macumazahn,” he said, “since none can climb\r\nthat fence of rock in which the holes seem to be few and small.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “but it is one out of which those who are in, would\r\nfind it difficult to get out. We are buffaloes in a pit, Umslopogaas.”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” he answered, “I have thought it already. But if any would\r\nmeddle with us we still have our horns and can toss for a while.”\r\n\r\nThen he went back to his men.\r\n\r\nThe sunset in that great solemn place was a wonderful thing to see.\r\nFirst of all the measureless crater was filled with light like a bowl\r\nwith fire. Then as the great orb sank behind the western cliff, half of\r\nthe plain became quite dark while shadows seemed to rush forward over\r\nthe eastern part of its surface, till that too was swallowed up in\r\ngloom and for a little while there remained only a glow reflected from\r\nthe cliff face and from the sky above, while on the crest of the\r\nparapet of rock played strange and glorious fires. Presently these too\r\nvanished and the world was dark.\r\n\r\nThen the half moon broke from behind a bank of clouds and by its\r\nsilver, uncertain light we struggled forward across the flat plain,\r\nrather slowly now, for even the iron muscles of those bearers grew\r\ntired. I could not see much of it, but I gathered that we were passing\r\nthrough crops, very fine crops to judge by their height, as doubtless\r\nthey would be upon this lava soil; also once or twice we splashed\r\nthrough streams.\r\n\r\nAt length, being tired and lulled by the swaying of the litter and by\r\nthe sound of a weird, low chant that the bearers had set up now that\r\nthey neared home and were afraid of no attack, I sank into a doze. When\r\nI awoke again it was to find that the litter had halted and to hear the\r\nvoice of Billali say,\r\n\r\n“Descend, White Lords, and come with your companions, the black Warrior\r\nand the yellow man who is named Light-in-Darkness. She-who-commands\r\ndesires to see you at once before you eat and sleep, and must not be\r\nkept waiting. Fear not for the others, they will be cared for till you\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE WHITE WITCH\r\n\r\n\r\nI descended from the litter and told the others what the old fellow had\r\nsaid. Robertson did not want to come, and indeed refused to do so until\r\nI suggested to him that such conduct might prejudice a powerful person\r\nagainst us. Umslopogaas was indifferent, putting, as he remarked, no\r\nfaith in a ruler who was a woman.\r\n\r\nOnly Hans, although he was so tired, acquiesced with some eagerness,\r\nthe fact being that his brain was more alert and that he had all the\r\ncuriosity of the monkey tribe which he so much resembled in appearance,\r\nand wanted to see this queen whom Zikali revered.\r\n\r\nIn the end we started, conducted by Billali and by men who carried\r\ntorches whereof the light showed me that we were passing between\r\nhouses, or at any rate walls that had been those of houses, and along\r\nwhat seemed to be a paved street.\r\n\r\nWalking under what I took to be a great arch or portico, we came into a\r\ncourt that was full of towering pillars but unroofed, for I could see\r\nthe stars above. At its end we entered a building of which the doorway\r\nwas hung with mats, to find that it was lighted with lamps and that all\r\ndown its length on either side guards with long spears stood at\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Baas,” said Hans hesitatingly, “this is the mouth of a trap,”\r\nwhile Umslopogaas glared about him suspiciously, fingering the handle\r\nof his great axe.\r\n\r\n“Be silent,” I answered. “All this mountain is a trap, therefore\r\nanother does not matter, and we have our pistols.”\r\n\r\nWalking forward between the double line of guards who stood immovable\r\nas statues, we came to some curtains hung at the end of a long, narrow\r\nhall which, although I know little of such things, were, I noted, made\r\nof rich stuff embroidered in colours and with golden threads. Before\r\nthese curtains Billali motioned us to halt.\r\n\r\nAfter a whispered colloquy with someone beyond carried on through the\r\njoin of the curtains, he vanished between them, leaving us alone for\r\nfive minutes or more. At length they opened and a tall and elegant\r\nwoman with an Arab cast of countenance and clad in white robes,\r\nappeared and beckoned to us to enter. She did not speak or answer when\r\nI spoke to her, which was not wonderful as afterwards I discovered that\r\nshe was a mute. We went in, I wondering very much what we were going to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nOn the further side of the curtains was a room of no great size\r\nillumined with lamps of which the light fell upon sculptured walls. It\r\nlooked to me as though it might once have been the inmost court or a\r\nsanctuary of some temple, for at its head was a dais upon which once\r\nperhaps had stood the shrine or statue of a god. On this dais there was\r\nnow a couch and on the couch—a goddess!\r\n\r\nThere she sat, straight and still, clothed in shining white and veiled,\r\nbut with her draperies so arranged that they emphasised rather than\r\nconcealed the wonderful elegance of her tall form. From beneath the\r\nveil, which was such as a bride wears, appeared two plaits of glossy,\r\nraven hair of great length, to the end of each of which was suspended a\r\nsingle large pearl. On either side of her stood a tall woman like to\r\nher who had led us through the curtains, and on his knees in front, but\r\nto the right, knelt Billali.\r\n\r\nAbout this seated personage there was an air of singular majesty, such\r\nas might pervade a queen as fancy paints her, though she had a nobler\r\nfigure than any queen I ever saw depicted. Mystery seemed to flow from\r\nher; it clothed her like the veil she wore, which of course heightened\r\nthe effect. Beauty flowed from her also; although it was shrouded I\r\nknew that it was there, no veil or coverings could obscure it—at least,\r\nto my imagination. Moreover she breathed out power also; one felt it in\r\nthe air as one feels a thunderstorm before it breaks, and it seemed to\r\nme that this power was not quite human, that it drew its strength from\r\nafar and dwelt a stranger to the earth.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, although my curiosity, always strong, was enormously\r\nexcited and though now I felt glad that I had attempted this journey\r\nwith all its perils, I was horribly afraid, so much afraid that I\r\nshould have liked to turn and run away. From the beginning I knew\r\nmyself to be in the presence of an unearthly being clothed in soft and\r\nperfect woman’s flesh, something alien, too, and different from our\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\nWhat a picture it all made! There she sat, quiet and stately as a\r\nperfect marble statue; only her breast, rising and falling beneath the\r\nwhite robe, showed that she was alive and breathed as others do.\r\nAnother thing showed it also—her eyes. At first I could not see them\r\nthrough the veil, but presently either because I grew accustomed to the\r\nlight, or because they brightened as those of certain animals have\r\npower to do when they watch intently, it ceased to be a covering to\r\nthem. Distinctly I saw them now, large and dark and splendid with a\r\ntinge of deep blue in the iris; alluring and yet awful in their\r\nmajestic aloofness which seemed to look through and beyond, to embrace\r\nall without seeking and without effort. Those eyes were like windows\r\nthrough which light flows from within, a light of the spirit.\r\n\r\nI glanced round to see the effect of this vision upon my companions. It\r\nwas most peculiar. Hans had sunk to his knees; his hands were joined in\r\nthe attitude of prayer and his ugly little face reminded me of that of\r\na big fish out of water and dying from excess of air. Robertson,\r\nstartled out of his abstraction, stared at the royal-looking woman on\r\nthe couch with his mouth open.\r\n\r\n“Man,” he whispered, “I’ve got them back although I have touched\r\nnothing for weeks, only this time they are lovely. For yon’s no human\r\nlady, I feel it in my bones.”\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas stood great and grim, his hands resting on the handle of\r\nhis tall axe; and he stared also, the blood pulsing against the skin\r\nthat covered the hole in his head.\r\n\r\n“Watcher-by-Night,” he said to me in his deep voice, but also speaking\r\nin a whisper, “this chieftainess is not one woman, but all women.\r\nBeneath those robes of hers I seem to see the beauty of one who has\r\n‘gone Beyond,’ of the Lily who is lost to me. Do you not feel it thus,\r\nMacumazahn?”\r\n\r\nNow that he mentioned it, certainly I did; indeed, I had felt it all\r\nalong although amid the rush of sensations this one had scarcely\r\ndisentangled itself in my mind. I looked at the draped shape and\r\nsaw—well, never mind whom I saw; it was not one only but several in\r\nsequence; also a woman who at that time I did not know although I came\r\nto know her afterwards, too well, perhaps, or at any rate quite enough\r\nto puzzle me. The odd thing was that in this hallucination the\r\npersonalities of these individuals seemed to overlap and merge, till at\r\nlast I began to wonder whether they were not parts of the same entity\r\nor being, manifesting itself in sundry shapes, yet springing from one\r\ncentre, as different coloured rays flow from the same crystal, while\r\nthe beams from their source of light shift and change. But the fancy is\r\ntoo metaphysical for my poor powers to express as clearly as I would.\r\nAlso no doubt it was but a hallucination that had its origin, perhaps,\r\nin the mischievous brain of her who sat before us.\r\n\r\nAt length she spoke and her voice sounded like silver bells heard over\r\nwater in a great calm. It was low and sweet, oh! so sweet that at its\r\nfirst notes for a moment my senses seemed to swoon and my pulse to\r\nstop. It was to me that she addressed herself.\r\n\r\n“My servant here,” and ever so slightly she turned her head towards the\r\nkneeling Billali, “tells me that you who are named\r\nWatcher-in-the-Night, understand the tongue in which I speak to you. Is\r\nit so?”\r\n\r\n“I understand Arabic of a kind well enough, having learned it on the\r\nEast Coast and from Arabs in past years, but not such Arabic as you\r\nuse, O——” and I paused.\r\n\r\n“Call me _Hiya_,” she broke in, “which is my title here, meaning, as\r\nyou know, She, or Woman. Or if that does not please you, call me\r\nAyesha. It would rejoice me after so long to hear the name I bore\r\nspoken by the lips of one of my colour and of gentle blood.”\r\n\r\nI blushed at the compliment so artfully conveyed, and repeated stupidly\r\nenough,\r\n\r\n“—Not such Arabic as you use, O—Ayesha.”\r\n\r\n“I thought that you would like the sound of the word better than that\r\nof _Hiya_, though afterwards I will teach you to pronounce it as you\r\nshould, O—have you any other name save Watcher-by-Night, which seems\r\nalso to be a title?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered. “Allan.”\r\n\r\n“—O—Allan. Tell me of these,” she went on quickly, indicating my\r\ncompanions with a sweep of her slender hand, “for they do not speak\r\nArabic, I think. Or stay, I will tell you of them and you shall say if\r\nI do so rightly. This one,” and she nodded towards Robertson, “is a man\r\nbemused. There comes from him a colour which I see if you cannot, and\r\nthat colour betokens a desire for revenge, though I think that in his\r\ntime he has desired other things also, as I remember men always did\r\nfrom the beginning, to their ruin. Human nature does not change, Allan,\r\nand wine and women are ancient snares. Enough of him for this time. The\r\nlittle yellow one there is afraid of me, as are all of you. That is\r\nwoman’s greatest power, although she is so weak and gentle, men are\r\nstill afraid of her just because they are so foolish that they cannot\r\nunderstand her. To them after a million years she still remains the\r\nUnknown and to us all the Unknown is also the awful. Do you remember\r\nthe proverb of the Romans that says it well and briefly?”\r\n\r\nI nodded, for it was one of the Latin tags that my father had taught\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Good. Well, he is a little wild man, is he not, nearer to the apes\r\nfrom whose race our bodies come? But do you know that, Allan?”\r\n\r\nI nodded again, and said,\r\n\r\n“There are disputes upon the point, Ayesha.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they had begun in my day and we will discuss them later. Still, I\r\nsay—nearer to the ape than you or I, and therefore of interest, as the\r\ngerm of things is always. Yet he has qualities, I think; cunning, and\r\nfidelity and love which in its round is all in all. Do you understand,\r\nAllan, that love is all in all?”\r\n\r\nI answered warily that it depended upon what she meant by love, to\r\nwhich she replied that she would explain afterwards when we had leisure\r\nto talk, adding,\r\n\r\n“What this little yellow monkey understands by it at least has served\r\nyou well, or so I believe. You shall tell me the tale of it some day.\r\nNow of the last, this Black One. Here I think is a man indeed, a\r\nwarrior of warriors such as there used to be in the early world, if a\r\nsavage. Well, believe me, Allan, savages are often the best. Moreover,\r\nall are still savage at heart, even you and I. For what is termed\r\nculture is but coat upon coat of paint laid on to hide our native\r\ncolour, and often there is poison in the paint. That axe of his has\r\ndrunk deep, I think, though always in fair fight, and I say that it\r\nshall drink deeper yet. Have I read these men aright, Allan?”\r\n\r\n“Not so ill,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“I thought it,” she said with a musical laugh, “although at this place\r\nI rust and grow dull like an unused sword. Now you would rest. Go—all\r\nof you. To-morrow you and I will talk alone. Fear nothing for your\r\nsafety; you are watched by my slaves and I watch my slaves. Until\r\nto-morrow, then, farewell. Go now, eat and sleep, as alas we all must\r\ndo who linger on this ball of earth and cling to a life we should do\r\nwell to lose. Billali, lead them hence,” and she waved her hand to\r\nsignify that the audience was ended.\r\n\r\nAt this sign Hans, who apparently was still much afraid, rose from his\r\nknees and literally bolted through the curtains. Robertson followed\r\nhim. Umslopogaas stood a moment, drew himself up and lifting the great\r\naxe, cried _Bayéte_, after which he too turned and went.\r\n\r\n“What does that word mean, Allan?” she asked.\r\n\r\nI explained that it was the salutation which the Zulu people only give\r\nto kings.\r\n\r\n“Did I not say that savages are often the best?” she exclaimed in a\r\ngratified voice. “The white man, your companion, gave me no salute, but\r\nthe Black One knows when he stands before a woman who is royal.”\r\n\r\n“He too is of royal blood in his own land,” I said.\r\n\r\n“If so, we are akin, Allan.”\r\n\r\nThen I bowed deeply to her in my best manner and rising from her couch\r\nfor the first time she stood up, looking very tall and commanding, and\r\nbowed back.\r\n\r\nAfter this I went to find the others on the further side of the\r\ncurtains, except Hans, who had run down the long narrow hall and\r\nthrough the mats at its end. We followed, marching with dignity behind\r\nBillali and between the double line of guards, who raised their spears\r\nas we passed them, and on the further side of the mats discovered Hans,\r\nstill looking terrified.\r\n\r\n“Baas,” he said to me as we threaded our way through the court of\r\ncolumns, “in my life I have seen all kinds of dreadful things and faced\r\nthem, but never have I been so much afraid as I am of that white witch.\r\nBaas, I think that she is the devil of whom your reverend father, the\r\nPredikant, used to talk so much, or perhaps his wife.”\r\n\r\n“If so, Hans,” I answered, “the devil is not so black as he is painted.\r\nBut I advise you to be careful of what you say as she may have long\r\nears.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter at all what one says, Baas, because she reads\r\nthoughts before they pass the lips. I felt her doing it there in that\r\nroom. And do you be careful, Baas, or she will eat up your spirit and\r\nmake you fall in love with her, who, I expect, is very ugly indeed,\r\nsince otherwise she would not wear a veil. Whoever saw a pretty woman\r\ntie up her head in a sack, Baas?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she does this because she is so beautiful, Hans, that she\r\nfears the hearts of men who look upon her would melt.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, Baas, all women want to melt men’s hearts; the more the\r\nbetter. They seem to have other things in their minds, but really they\r\nthink of nothing else until they are too old and ugly, and it takes\r\nthem a long while to be sure of that.”\r\n\r\nSo Hans went on talking his shrewd nonsense till, following so far as I\r\ncould see, the same road as that by which we had come, we reached our\r\nquarters, where we found food prepared for us, broiled goat’s flesh\r\nwith corncakes and milk, I think it was; also beds for us two white men\r\ncovered with skin rugs and blankets woven of wool.\r\n\r\nThese quarters, I should explain, consisted of rooms in a house built\r\nof stone of which the walls had once been painted. The roof of the\r\nhouse was gone now, for we could see the stars shining above us, but as\r\nthe air was very soft in this sheltered plain, this was an advantage\r\nrather than otherwise. The largest room was reserved for Robertson and\r\nmyself, while another at the back was given to Umslopogaas and his\r\nZulus, and a third to the two wounded men.\r\n\r\nBillali showed us these arrangements by the light of lamps and\r\napologised that they were not better because, as he explained, the\r\nplace was a ruin and there had been no time to build us a house. He\r\nadded that we might sleep without fear as we were guarded and none\r\nwould dare to harm the guests of She-who-commands, on whom he was sure\r\nwe, or at any rate I and the black Warrior, had produced an excellent\r\nimpression. Then he bowed himself out, saying that he would return in\r\nthe morning, and left us to our own devices.\r\n\r\nRobertson and I sat down on stools that had been set for us, and ate,\r\nbut he seemed so overcome by his experiences, or by his sombre\r\nthoughts, that I could not draw him into conversation. All he remarked\r\nwas that we had fallen into queer company and that those who supped\r\nwith Satan needed a long spoon. Having delivered himself of this\r\nsentiment he threw himself upon the bed, prayed aloud for a while as\r\nhad become his fashion, to be “protected from warlocks and witches,”\r\namongst other things, and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nBefore I turned in I visited Umslopogaas’s room to see that all was\r\nwell with him and his people, and found him standing in the doorway\r\nstaring at the star-spangled sky.\r\n\r\n“Greeting, Macumazahn,” he said, “you who are white and wise and I who\r\nam black and a fighter have seen many strange things beneath the sun,\r\nbut never such a one as we have looked upon to-night. Who and what is\r\nthat chieftainess, Macumazahn?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” I said, “but it is worth while to have lived to see\r\nher, even though she be veiled.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I, Macumazahn. Nay, I do know, for my heart tells me that she\r\nis the greatest of all witches and that you will do well to guard your\r\nspirit lest she should steal it away. If she were not a witch, should I\r\nhave seemed to behold the shape of Nada the Lily who was the wife of my\r\nyouth, beneath those white robes of hers, and though the tongue in\r\nwhich she spoke was strange to me, to hear the murmur of Nada’s voice\r\nbetween her lips, of Nada who has gone further from me than those\r\nstars. It is good that you wear the Great Medicine of Zikali upon your\r\nbreast, Macumazahn, for perhaps it will shield you from harm at those\r\nhands that are shaped of ivory.”\r\n\r\n“Zikali is another of the tribe,” I answered, laughing, “although less\r\nbeautiful to see. Also I am not afraid of any of them, and from this\r\none, if she be more than some white woman whom it pleases to veil\r\nherself, I shall hope to gather wisdom.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Macumazahn, such wisdom as Spirits and the dead have to give.”\r\n\r\n“Mayhap, Umslopogaas, but we came here to seek Spirits and the dead,\r\ndid we not?”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” answered Umslopogaas, “these and war, and I think that we shall\r\nfind enough of all three. Only I hope that war will come the first,\r\nlest the Spirits and the dead should bewitch me and take away my skill\r\nand courage.”\r\n\r\nThen we parted, and too tired even to wonder any more, I threw myself\r\ndown on my bed and slept.\r\n\r\nI was awakened when the sun was already high, by the sound of\r\nRobertson, who was on his knees, praying aloud as usual, a habit of his\r\nwhich I confess got on my nerves. Prayer, in my opinion, is a private\r\nmatter between man and his Creator, that is, except in church; further,\r\nI did not in the least wish to hear all about Robertson’s sins, which\r\nseemed to have been many and peculiar. It is bad enough to have to bear\r\nthe burden of one’s own transgressions without learning of those of\r\nother people, that is, unless one is a priest and must do so\r\nprofessionally. So I jumped up to escape and make arrangements for a\r\nwash, only to butt into old Billali, who was standing in the doorway\r\ncontemplating Robertson with much interest and stroking his white\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nHe greeted me with his courteous bow and said,\r\n\r\n“Tell your companion, O Watcher, that it is not necessary for him to go\r\nupon his knees to She-who-commands—and must be obeyed,” he added with\r\nemphasis, “when he is not in her presence, and that even then he would\r\ndo well to keep silent, since so much talking in a strange tongue might\r\ntrouble her.”\r\n\r\nI burst out laughing and answered,\r\n\r\n“He does not go upon his knees and pray to She-who-commands, but to the\r\nGreat One who is in the sky.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Watcher. Well, here we only know a Great One who is upon the\r\nearth, though it is true that perhaps she visits the skies sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“Is it so, Billali?” I answered incredulously. “And now, I would ask\r\nyou to take me to some place where I can bathe.”\r\n\r\n“It is ready,” he replied. “Come.”\r\n\r\nSo I called to Hans, who was hanging about with a rifle on his arm, to\r\nfollow with a cloth and soap, of which fortunately we had a couple of\r\npieces left, and we started along what had once been a paved roadway\r\nrunning between stone houses, whereof the time-eaten ruins still\r\nremained on either side.\r\n\r\n“Who and what is this Queen of yours, Billali?” I asked as we went.\r\n“Surely she is not of the Amahagger blood.”\r\n\r\n“Ask it of herself, O Watcher, for I cannot tell you. All I know is\r\nthat I can trace my own family for ten generations and that my tenth\r\nforefather told his son on his deathbed, for the saying has come down\r\nthrough his descendants—that when he was young She-who-commands had\r\nruled the land for more scores of years than he could count months of\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nI stopped and stared at him, since the lie was so amazing that it\r\nseemed to deprive me of the power of motion. Noting my very obvious\r\ndisbelief he continued blandly,\r\n\r\n“If you doubt, ask. And now here is where you may bathe.”\r\n\r\nThen he led me through an arched doorway and down a wrecked passage to\r\nwhat very obviously once had been a splendid bath-house such as some I\r\nhave seen pictures of that were built by the Romans. Its size was that\r\nof a large room; it was constructed of a kind of marble with a sloping\r\nbottom that varied from three to seven feet in depth, and water still\r\nran in and out of it through large glazed pipes. Moreover round it was\r\na footway about five feet across, from which opened chambers, unroofed\r\nnow, that the bathers used as dressing-rooms, while between these\r\nchambers stood the remains of statues. One at the end indeed, where an\r\nalcove had protected it from sun and weather, was still quite perfect,\r\nexcept for the outstretched arms which were gone (the right hand I\r\nnoticed lying at the bottom of the bath). It was that of a nude young\r\nwoman in the attitude of diving, a very beautiful bit of work, I\r\nthought, though of course I am no judge of sculpture. Even the smile\r\nmingled with trepidation upon the girl’s face was most naturally\r\nportrayed.\r\n\r\nThis statue showed two things, that the bath was used by females and\r\nthat the people who built it were highly civilised, also that they\r\nbelonged to an advanced if somewhat Eastern race, since the girl’s nose\r\nwas, if anything, Semitic in character, and her lips, though prettily\r\nshaped, were full. For the rest, the basin was so clean that I presume\r\nit must have been made ready for me or other recent bathers, and at its\r\nbottom I discovered gratings and broken pipes of earthenware which\r\nsuggested that in the old days the water could be warmed by means of a\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nThis relic of a long-past civilisation excited Hans even more than it\r\ndid myself, since having never seen anything of the sort, he thought it\r\nso strange that, as he informed me, he imagined that it must have been\r\nbuilt by witchcraft. In it I had a most delightful and much-needed\r\nbath. Even Hans was persuaded to follow my example—a thing I had rarely\r\nknown him to do before—and seated in its shallowest part, splashed some\r\nwater over his yellow, wrinkled anatomy. Then we returned to our house,\r\nwhere I found an excellent breakfast had been provided which was\r\nbrought to us by tall, silent, handsome women who surveyed us out of\r\nthe corners of their eyes, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nShortly after I had finished my meal, Billali, who had disappeared,\r\ncame back again and said that She-who-commands desired my presence as\r\nshe would speak with me; also that I must come alone. So, after\r\nattending to the wounded, who both seemed to be getting on well, I\r\nwent, followed by Hans armed with his rifle, though I only carried my\r\nrevolver. Robertson wished to accompany me, as he did not seem to care\r\nabout being left alone with the Zulus in that strange place, but this\r\nBillali would not allow. Indeed, when he persisted, two great men\r\nstepped forward and crossed their spears before him in a somewhat\r\nthreatening fashion. Then at my entreaty, for I feared lest trouble\r\nshould arise, he gave in and returned to the house.\r\n\r\nFollowing our path of the night before, we walked up a ruined street\r\nwhich I could see was only one of scores in what had once been a very\r\ngreat city, until we came to the archway that I have mentioned, a large\r\none now overgrown with plants that from their yellow, sweet-scented\r\nbloom I judged to be a species of wallflower, also with a kind of\r\nhouseleek or saxifrage.\r\n\r\nHere Hans was stopped by guards, Billali explaining to me that he must\r\nawait my return, an order which he obeyed unwillingly enough. Then I\r\nwent on down the narrow passage, lined as before by guards who stood\r\nsilent as statues, and came to the curtains at the end. Before these at\r\na motion from Billali, who did not seem to dare to speak in this place,\r\nI stood still and waited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nALLAN HEARS A STRANGE TALE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some minutes I remained before those curtains until, had it not\r\nbeen for something electric in the air which got into my bones, a kind\r\nof force that, perhaps in my fancy only, seemed to pervade the place, I\r\nshould certainly have grown bored. Indeed I was about to ask my\r\ncompanion why he did not announce our arrival instead of standing there\r\nlike a stuck pig with his eyes shut as though in prayer or meditation,\r\nwhen the curtains parted and from between them appeared one of those\r\ntall waiting women whom we had seen on the previous night. She\r\ncontemplated us gravely for a few moments, then moved her hand twice,\r\nonce forward, towards Billali as a signal to him to retire, which he\r\ndid with great rapidity, and next in a beckoning fashion towards myself\r\nto invite me to follow her.\r\n\r\nI obeyed, passing between the thick curtains which she fastened in some\r\nway behind me, and found myself in the same roofed and sculptured room\r\nthat I have already described. Only now there were no lamps, such light\r\nas penetrated it coming from an opening above that I could not see, and\r\nfalling upon the dais at its head, also on her who sat upon the dais.\r\n\r\nYes, there she was in her white robes and veil, the point and centre of\r\na little lake of light, a wondrous and in a sense a spiritual vision,\r\nfor in truth there was something about her which was not of the world,\r\nsomething that drew and yet frightened me. Still as a statue she sat,\r\nlike one to whom time is of no account and who has grown weary of\r\nmotion, and on either side of her yet more still, like caryatides\r\nsupporting a shrine, stood two of the stately women who were her\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nFor the rest a sweet and subtle odour pervaded the chamber which took\r\nhold of my senses as _hasheesh_ might do, which I was sure proceeded\r\nfrom her, or from her garments, for I could see no perfumes burning.\r\nShe spoke no word, yet I knew she was inviting me to come nearer and\r\nmoved forward till I reached a curious carved chair that was placed\r\njust beneath the dais, and there halted, not liking to sit down without\r\npermission.\r\n\r\nFor a long while she contemplated me, for as before I could feel her\r\neyes searching me from head to foot and as it were looking through me\r\nas though she would discover my very soul. Then at length she moved,\r\nwaving those two ivory arms of hers outwards with a kind of swimming\r\nstroke, whereon the women to right and left of her turned and glided\r\naway, I know not whither.\r\n\r\n“Sit, Allan,” she said, “and let us talk, for I think we have much to\r\nsay to each other. Have you slept well? And eaten?—though I fear that\r\nthe food is but rough. Also was the bath made ready for you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ayesha,” I answered to all three questions, adding, for I knew\r\nnot what to say, “It seems to be a very ancient bath.”\r\n\r\n“When I last saw it,” she replied, “it was well enough with statues\r\nstanding round it worked by a sculptor who had seen beauty in his\r\ndreams. But in two thousand years—or is it more?—the tooth of Time\r\nbites deep, and doubtless like all else in this dead place it is now a\r\nruin.”\r\n\r\nI coughed to cover up the exclamation of disbelief that rose to my lips\r\nand remarked blandly that two thousand years was certainly a long time.\r\n\r\n“When you say one thing, Allan, and mean another, your Arabic is even\r\nmore vile than usual and does not serve to cloak your thought.”\r\n\r\n“It may be so, Ayesha, for I only know that tongue as I do many other\r\nof the dialects of Africa by learning it from common men. My own speech\r\nis English, in which, if you are acquainted with it, I should prefer to\r\ntalk.”\r\n\r\n“I know not English, which doubtless is some language that has arisen\r\nsince I left the world. Perhaps later you shall teach it to me. I tell\r\nyou, you anger me whom it is not well to anger, because you believe\r\nnothing that passes my lips and yet do not dare to say so.”\r\n\r\n“How can I believe one, Ayesha, who if I understand aright, speaks of\r\nhaving seen a certain bath two thousand years ago, whereas one hundred\r\nyears are the full days of man? Forgive me therefore if I cannot\r\nbelieve what I know to be untrue.”\r\n\r\nNow I thought that she would be very angry and was sorry that I had\r\nspoken. But as it happened she was not.\r\n\r\n“You must have courage to give me the lie so boldly—and I like\r\ncourage,” she said, “who have been cringed to for so long. Indeed, I\r\nknow that you are brave, who have heard how you bore yourself in the\r\nfight yesterday, and much else about you. I think that we shall be\r\nfriends, but—seek no more.”\r\n\r\n“What else should I seek, Ayesha?” I asked innocently.\r\n\r\n“Now you are lying again,” she said, “who know well that no man who is\r\na man sees a woman who is beautiful and pleases him, without wondering\r\nwhether, should he desire it, she could come to love him, that is, if\r\nshe be young.”\r\n\r\n“Which at least is not possible if she has lived two thousand years.\r\nThen naturally she would prefer to wear a veil,” I said boldly, seeking\r\nto avoid the argument into which I saw she wished to drag me.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she answered, “the little yellow man who is named\r\nLight-in-Darkness put that thought into your heart, I think. Oh, do not\r\ntrouble as to how I know it, who have many spies here, as he guessed\r\nwell enough. So a woman who has lived two thousand years must be\r\nhideous and wrinkled, must she? The stamp of youth and loveliness must\r\nlong have fled from her; of that you, the wise man, are sure. Very\r\nwell. Now you tempt me to do what I had determined I would not do and\r\nyou shall pluck the fruit of that tree of curiosity which grows so fast\r\nwithin you. Look, Allan, and say whether I am old and hideous, even\r\nthough I have lived two thousand years upon the earth and mayhap many\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nThen she lifted her hands and did something to her veil, so that for a\r\nmoment—only one moment—her face was revealed, after which the veil fell\r\ninto its place.\r\n\r\nI looked, I saw, and if that chair had lacked a back I believe that I\r\nshould have fallen out of it to the ground. As for what I saw—well, it\r\ncannot be described, at any rate by me, except perhaps as a flash of\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nEvery man has dreamed of perfect beauty, basing his ideas of it perhaps\r\non that of some woman he has met who chanced to take his fancy, with a\r\nfew accessories from splendid pictures or Greek statues thrown in,\r\n_plus_ a garnishment of the imagination. At any rate I have, and here\r\nwas that perfect beauty multiplied by ten, such beauty, that at the\r\nsight of it the senses reeled. And yet I repeat that it is not to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nI do not know what the nose or the lips were like; in fact, all that I\r\ncan remember with distinctness is the splendour of the eyes, of which I\r\nhad caught some hint through her veil on the previous night. Oh, they\r\nwere wondrous, those eyes, but I cannot tell their colour save that the\r\ngroundwork of them was black. Moreover they seemed to be more than eyes\r\nas we understand them. They were indeed windows of the soul, out of\r\nwhich looked thought and majesty and infinite wisdom, mixed with all\r\nthe allurements and the mystery that we are accustomed to see or to\r\nimagine in woman.\r\n\r\nHere let me say something at once. If this marvellous creature expected\r\nthat the revelation of her splendour was going to make me her slave; to\r\ncause me to fall in love with her, as it is called, well, she must have\r\nbeen disappointed, for it had no such effect. It frightened and in a\r\nsense humbled me, that is all, for I felt myself to be in the presence\r\nof something that was not human, something alien to me as a man, which\r\nI could fear and even adore as humanity would adore that which is\r\nDivine, but with which I had no desire to mix. Moreover, was it divine,\r\nor was it something very different? I did not know, I only knew that it\r\nwas not for me; as soon should I have thought of asking for a star to\r\nset within my lantern.\r\n\r\nI think that she felt this, felt that her stroke had missed, as the\r\nFrench say, that is if she meant to strike at all at this moment. Of\r\nthis I am not certain, for it was in a changed voice, one with a\r\nsuspicion of chill in it that she said with a little laugh,\r\n\r\n“Do you admit now, Allan, that a woman may be old and still remain fair\r\nand unwrinkled?”\r\n\r\n“I admit,” I answered, although I was trembling so much that I could\r\nhardly speak with steadiness, “that a woman may be splendid and lovely\r\nbeyond anything that the mind of man can conceive, whatever her age, of\r\nwhich I know nothing. I would add this, Ayesha, that I thank you very\r\nmuch for having revealed to me the glory that is hid beneath your\r\nveil.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” she asked, and I thought that I detected curiosity in her\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“For this reason, Ayesha. Now there is no fear of my troubling you in\r\nsuch a fashion as you seemed to dread a little while ago. As soon would\r\na man desire to court the moon sailing in her silver loveliness through\r\nheaven.”\r\n\r\n“The moon! It is strange that you should compare me to the moon,” she\r\nsaid musingly. “Do you know that the moon was a great goddess in Old\r\nEgypt and that her name was Isis and—well, once I had to do with Isis?\r\nPerhaps you were there and knew it, since more lives than one are given\r\nto most of us. I must search and learn. For the rest, all have not\r\nthought as you do, Allan. Many, on the contrary, love and seek to win\r\nthe Divine.”\r\n\r\n“So do I at a distance, Ayesha, but to come too near to it I do not\r\naspire. If I did perhaps I might be consumed.”\r\n\r\n“You have wisdom,” she replied, not without a note of admiration in her\r\nvoice. “The moths are few that fear the flame, but those are the moths\r\nwhich live. Also I think that you have scorched your wings before and\r\nlearned that fire hurts. Indeed, now I remember that I have heard of\r\nthree such fires of love through which you have flown, Allan, though\r\nall of them are dead ashes now, or shine elsewhere. Two burned in your\r\nyouth when a certain lady died to save you, a great woman that, is it\r\nnot so? And the third, ah! she was fire indeed, though of a copper hue.\r\nWhat was her name? I cannot remember, but I think it had something to\r\ndo with the wind, yes, with the wind when it wails.”\r\n\r\nI stared at her. Was this Mameena myth to be dug up again in a secret\r\nplace in the heart of Africa? And how the deuce did she know anything\r\nabout Mameena? Could she have been questioning Hans or Umslopogaas? No,\r\nit was not possible, for she had never seen them out of my presence.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” she went on in a mocking voice, “perhaps once again you\r\ndisbelieve, Allan, whose cynic mind is so hard to open to new truths.\r\nWell, shall I show you the faces of these three? I can,” and she waved\r\nher hand towards some object that stood on a tripod to the right of her\r\nin the shadow—it looked like a crystal basin. “But what would it serve\r\nwhen you who know them so well, believed that I drew their pictures out\r\nof your own soul? Also perchance but one face would appear and that one\r\nstrange to you. [Lady Ragnall perhaps?—JB]\r\n\r\n“Have you heard, Allan, that among the wise some hold that not all of\r\nus is visible at once here on earth within the same house of flesh;\r\nthat the whole self in its home above, separates itself into sundry\r\nparts, each of which walks the earth in different form, a segment of\r\nlife’s circle that can never be dissolved and must unite again at\r\nlast?”\r\n\r\nI shook my head blankly, for I had never heard anything of the sort.\r\n\r\n“You have still much to learn, Allan, although doubtless there are some\r\nwho think you wise,” she went on in the same mocking voice. “Well, I\r\nhold that this doctrine is built upon a rock of truth; also,” she added\r\nafter studying me for a minute, “that in your case these three women do\r\nnot complete that circle. I think there is a fourth who as yet is\r\nstrange to you in this life, though you have known her well enough in\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\nI groaned, imagining that she alluded to herself, which was foolish of\r\nme, for at once she read my mind and went on with a rather acid little\r\nlaugh,\r\n\r\n“No, no, not the humble slave who sits before you, whom, as you have\r\ntold me, it would please you to reject as unworthy were she brought to\r\nyou in offering, as in the old days was done at the courts of the great\r\nkings of the East. O fool, fool! who hold yourself so strong and do not\r\nknow that if I chose, before yon shadow had moved a finger’s breadth, I\r\ncould bring you to my feet, praying that you might be suffered to kiss\r\nmy robe, yes, just the border of my robe.”\r\n\r\n“Then I beg of you not to choose, Ayesha, since I think that when there\r\nis work to be done by both of us, we shall find more comfort side by\r\nside than if I were on the ground seeking to kiss a garment that\r\ndoubtless then it would delight you to snatch away.”\r\n\r\nAt these words her whole attitude seemed to change. I could see her\r\nlovely shape brace itself up, as it were, beneath her robes and felt in\r\nsome way that her mind had also changed; that it had rid itself of\r\nmockery and woman’s pique and like a shifting searchlight, was directed\r\nupon some new objective.\r\n\r\n“Work to be done,” she repeated after me in a new voice. “Yes, I thank\r\nyou who bring it to my mind, since the hours pass and that work\r\npresses. Also I think there is a bargain to be made between us who are\r\nboth of the blood that keeps bargains, even if they be not written on a\r\nroll and signed and sealed. Why do you come to me and what do you seek\r\nof me, Allan, Watcher-in-the-Night? Say it and truthfully, for though I\r\nmay laugh at lies and pass them by when they have to do with the\r\neternal sword-play which Nature decrees between man and woman, until\r\nthese break apart or, casting down the swords, seek arms in which they\r\nagree too well, when they have to do with policy and high purpose and\r\nambition’s ends, why then I avenge them upon the liar.”\r\n\r\nNow I hesitated, as what I had to tell her seemed so foolish, indeed so\r\ninsane, while she waited patiently as though to give me time to shape\r\nmy thoughts. Speaking at last because I must, I said,\r\n\r\n“I come to ask you, Ayesha, to show me the dead, if the dead still live\r\nelsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“And who told you, Allan, that I could show you the dead, if they are\r\nnot truly dead? There is but one, I think, and if you are his\r\nmessenger, show me his token. Without it we do not speak together of\r\nthis business.”\r\n\r\n“What token?” I asked innocently, though I guessed her meaning well\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nShe searched me with her great eyes, for I felt, and indeed saw them on\r\nme through the veil, then answered,\r\n\r\n“I think—nay, let me be sure,” and half rising from the couch, she bent\r\nher head over the tripod that I have described, and stared into what\r\nseemed to be a crystal bowl. “If I read aright,” she said,\r\nstraightening herself presently, “it is a hideous thing enough, the\r\ncarving of an abortion of a man such as no woman would care to look on\r\nlest her babe should bear its stamp. It is a charmed thing also that\r\nhas virtues for him who wears it, especially for you, Allan, since\r\nsomething tells me that it is dyed with the blood of one who loved you.\r\nIf you have it, let it be revealed, since without it I do not talk with\r\nyou of these dead you seek.”\r\n\r\nNow I drew Zikali’s talisman from its hiding-place and held it towards\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“Give it to me,” she said.\r\n\r\nI was about to obey when something seemed to warn me not to do so.\r\n\r\n“Nay,” I answered, “he who lent me this carving for a while, charged me\r\nthat except in emergency and to save others, I must wear it night and\r\nday till I returned it to his hand, saying that if I parted from it\r\nfortune would desert me. I believe none of this talk and tried to be\r\nrid of it, whereon death drew near to me from a snake, such a snake as\r\nI see you wear about you, which doubtless also has poison in its fangs,\r\nif of another sort, Ayesha.”\r\n\r\n“Draw near,” she said, “and let me look. Man, be not afraid.”\r\n\r\nSo I rose from my chair and knelt before her, hoping secretly that no\r\none would see me in that ridiculous position, which the most\r\nunsuspicious might misinterpret. I admit, however, that it proved to\r\nhave compensations, since even through the veil I saw her marvellous\r\neyes better than I had done before, and something of the pure outline\r\nof her classic face; also the fragrance of her hair was wonderful.\r\n\r\nShe took the talisman in her hand and examined it closely.\r\n\r\n“I have heard of this charm and it is true that the thing has power,”\r\nshe said, “for I can feel it running through my veins, also that it is\r\na shield of defence to him who wears it. Yes, and now I understand what\r\nperplexed me somewhat, namely, how it came about that when you vexed me\r\ninto unveiling—but let that matter be. The wisdom was not your own, but\r\nanother’s, that is all. Yes, the wisdom of one whose years have borne\r\nhim beyond the shafts that fly from woman’s eyes, the ruinous shafts\r\nwhich bring men down to doom and nothingness. Tell me, Allan, is this\r\nthe likeness of him who gave it to you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Ayesha, the very picture, as I think, carved by himself, though\r\nhe said that it is ancient, and others tell that it has been known in\r\nthe land for centuries.”\r\n\r\n“So perchance has he,” she answered drily, “since some of our company\r\nlive long. Now tell me this wizard’s names. Nay, wait awhile for I\r\nwould prove that indeed you are his messenger with whom I may talk\r\nabout the dead, and other things, Allan. You can read Arabic, can you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“A little,” I answered.\r\n\r\nThen from a stool at her side she took paper, or rather papyrus and a\r\nreed pen, and on her knee wrote something on the sheet which she gave\r\nto me folded up.\r\n\r\n“Now tell me the names,” she said, “and then let us see if they tally\r\nwith what I have written, for if so you are a true man, not a mere\r\nwanderer or a spy.”\r\n\r\n“The principal names of this doctor are Zikali, the Opener-of-Roads,\r\nthe ‘_Thing-that-should-never-have-been-born_,’” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Read the writing, Allan,” she said.\r\n\r\nI unfolded the sheet and read Arabic words which meant, “Weapons,\r\nCleaver-of-Rocks, One-at-whom-dogs-bark-and-children-wail.”\r\n\r\n“The last two are near enough,” she said, “but the first is wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Ayesha, since in this man’s tongue the word ‘Zikali’ means\r\n‘Weapons’”; intelligence at which she clapped her hands as a merry girl\r\nmight do. “The man,” I went on, “is without doubt a great doctor, one\r\nwho sees and knows things that others do not, but I do not understand\r\nwhy this token carved in his likeness should have power, as you say it\r\nhas.”\r\n\r\n“Because with it goes his spirit, Allan. Have you never heard of the\r\nEgyptians, a very wise people who, as I remember, declared that man has\r\na _Ka_ or Double, a second self, that can either dwell in his statue or\r\nbe sent afar?”\r\n\r\nI answered that I had heard this.\r\n\r\n“Well the _Ka_ of this Zikali goes with that hideous image of him,\r\nwhich is perhaps why you have come safe through many dangers and why\r\nalso I seemed to dream so much of him last night. Tell me now, what\r\ndoes Zikali want of me whose power he knows very well?”\r\n\r\n“An oracle, the answer to a riddle, Ayesha.”\r\n\r\n“Then set it out another time. So you desire to see the dead, and this\r\nold dwarf, who is a home of wisdom, desires an oracle from one who is\r\ngreater than he. Good. And what are you, or both of you, prepared to\r\npay for these boons? Know, Allan, that I am a merchant who sells my\r\nfavours dear. Tell me then, will you pay?”\r\n\r\n“I think that it depends upon the price,” I answered cautiously. “Set\r\nout the price, Ayesha.”\r\n\r\n“Be not afraid, O cunning dealer,” she mocked. “I do not ask your soul\r\nor even that love of yours which you guard so jealously, since these\r\nthings I could take without the asking. Nay, I ask only what a brave\r\nand honest man may give without shame: your help in war, and perhaps,”\r\nshe added with a softer tone, “your friendship. I think, Allan, that I\r\nlike you well, perhaps because you remind me of another whom I knew\r\nlong ago.”\r\n\r\nI bowed at the compliment, feeling proud and pleased at the prospect of\r\na friendship with this wonderful and splendid creature, although I was\r\naware that it had many dangers. Then I sat still and waited. She also\r\nwaited, brooding.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” she said after a while, “I will tell you a story and when you\r\nhave heard it you shall answer, even if you do not believe it, but not\r\nbefore. Does it please you to listen to something of the tale of my\r\nlife which I am moved to tell you, that you may know with whom you have\r\nto deal?”\r\n\r\nAgain I bowed, thinking to myself that I knew nothing that would please\r\nme more, who was eaten up with a devouring curiosity about this woman.\r\n\r\nNow she rose from her couch and descending off the dais, began to walk\r\nup and down the chamber. I say, to walk, but her movements were more\r\nlike the gliding of an eagle through the air or the motion of a swan\r\nupon still water, so smooth were they and gracious. As she walked she\r\nspoke in a low and thrilling voice.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” she said again, “and even if my story seems marvellous to\r\nyou, interrupt, and above all, mock me not, lest I should grow angry,\r\nwhich might be ill for you. I am not as other women are, O Allan, who\r\nhaving conquered the secrets of Nature,” here I felt an intense desire\r\nto ask what secrets, but remembered and held my tongue, “to my sorrow\r\nhave preserved my youth and beauty through many ages. Moreover in the\r\npast, perhaps in payment for my sins, I have lived other lives of which\r\nsome memory remains with me.\r\n\r\n“By my last birth I am an Arab lady of royal blood, a descendant of the\r\nKings of the East. There I dwelt in the wilderness and ruled a people,\r\nand at night I gathered wisdom from the stars and the spirits of the\r\nearth and air. At length I wearied of it all and my people too wearied\r\nof me and besought me to depart, for, Allan, I would have naught to do\r\nwith men, yet men went mad because of my beauty and slew each other out\r\nof jealousy. Moreover other peoples made war upon my people, hoping to\r\ntake me captive that I might be a wife to their kings. So I left them,\r\nand being furnished with great wealth in hoarded gold and jewels,\r\ntogether with a certain holy man, my master, I wandered through the\r\nworld, studying the nations and their worships. At Jerusalem I tarried\r\nand learned of Jehovah who is, or was, its God.\r\n\r\n“At Paphos in the Isle of Chitim I dwelt a while till the folk of that\r\ncity thought that I was Aphrodite returned to earth and sought to\r\nworship me. For this reason and because I made a mock of Aphrodite, I,\r\nwho, as I have said, would have naught to do with men, she through her\r\npriests cursed me, saying that her yoke should lie more heavily upon my\r\nneck from age to age than on that of any woman who had breathed beneath\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n“It was a wondrous scene,” she added reflectively, “that of the\r\ncursing, since for every word I gave back two. Moreover I told the\r\nhoary villain of a high-priest to make report to his goddess that long\r\nafter she was dead in the world, I would live on, for the spirit of\r\nprophecy was on me in that hour. Yet the curse fell in its season,\r\nsince in her day, doubt it or not, Aphrodite had strength, as indeed\r\nunder other names she has and will have while the world endures, and\r\nfor aught I know, beyond it. Do they worship her now in any land,\r\nAllan?”\r\n\r\n“No, only her statues because of their beauty, though Love is always\r\nworshipped.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, who can testify to that better than you yourself, Allan, if he\r\nwho is called Zikali tells me the truth concerning you in the dreams he\r\nsends? As for the statues, I saw some of them as they left the master’s\r\nhand in Greece, and when I told him that he might have found a better\r\nmodel, once I was that model. If this marble still endures, it must be\r\nthe most famous of them all, though perchance Aphrodite has shattered\r\nit in her jealous rage. You shall tell me of these statues afterwards;\r\nmine had a mark on the left shoulder like to a mole, but the stone was\r\nimperfect, not my flesh, as I can prove if you should wish.”\r\n\r\nThinking it better not to enter on a discussion as to Ayesha’s\r\nshoulder, I remained silent and she went on.\r\n\r\n“I dwelt in Egypt also, and there, to be rid of men who wearied me with\r\ntheir sighs and importunities, also to acquire more wisdom of which she\r\nwas the mistress, I entered the service of the goddess Isis, Queen of\r\nHeaven, vowing to remain virgin for ever. Soon I became her\r\nhigh-priestess and in her most sacred shrines upon the Nile, I communed\r\nwith the goddess and shared her power, since from me her daughter, she\r\nwithheld none of her secrets. So it came about that though Pharaohs\r\nheld the sceptre, it was I who ruled Egypt and brought it and Sidon to\r\ntheir fall, it matters not how or why, as it was fated that I must do.\r\nYes, kings would come to seek counsel from me where I sat throned,\r\ndressed in the garb of Isis and breathing out her power. Yet, my task\r\naccomplished, of it all I grew weary, as men will surely do of the\r\nheavens that they preach, should they chance to find them.”\r\n\r\nI wondered what this “task” might be, but only asked, “Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because in their pictured heaven all things lie to their hands and\r\nman, being man, cannot be happy without struggle, and woman, being\r\nwoman, without victory over others. What is cheaply bought, or given,\r\nhas no value, Allan; to be enjoyed, it must first be won. But I bade\r\nyou not to break my thought.”\r\n\r\nI asked pardon and she went on,\r\n\r\n“Then it was that the shadow of the curse of Aphrodite fell upon me,\r\nyes, and of the curse of Isis also, so that these twin maledictions\r\nhave made me what I am, a lost soul dwelling in the wilderness waiting\r\nthe fulfilment of a fate whereof I know not the end. For though I have\r\nall wisdom, all knowledge of the Past and much power together with the\r\ngift of life and beauty, the future is as dark to me as night without\r\nits moon and stars.\r\n\r\n“Hearken, this chanced to me. Though it be to my shame I tell it you\r\nthat all may be clear. At a temple of Isis on the Nile where I ruled,\r\nthere was a certain priest, a Greek by birth, vowed like myself to the\r\nservice of the goddess and therefore to wed none but her, the goddess\r\nherself—that is, in the spirit. He was named Kallikrates, a man of\r\ncourage and of beauty, such an one as those Greeks carved in the\r\nstatues of their god Apollo. Never, I think, was a man more beautiful\r\nin face and form, though in soul he was not great, as often happens to\r\nmen who have all else, and well-nigh always happens to women, save\r\nmyself and perhaps one or two others that history tells of, doubtless\r\nmagnifying their fabled charms.\r\n\r\n“The Pharaoh of that day, the last of the native blood, him whom the\r\nPersians drove to doom, had a daughter, the Princess of Egypt,\r\nAmenartas by name, a fair woman in her fashion, though somewhat\r\nswarthy. In her youth this Amenartas became enamoured of Kallikrates\r\nand he of her, when he was a captain of the Grecian Mercenaries at\r\nPharaoh’s Court. Indeed, she brought blood upon his hands because of\r\nher, wherefore he fled to Isis for forgiveness and for peace. Thither\r\nin after time she followed him and again urged her love.\r\n\r\n“Learning of the thing and knowing it for sacrilege, I summoned this\r\npriest and warned him of his danger and of the doom which awaited him\r\nshould he continue in that path. He grew affrighted. He flung himself\r\nupon the ground before me with groans and supplications, and kissing my\r\nfeet, vowed most falsely to me that his dealings with the royal\r\nAmenartas were but a veil and that it was I whom he worshipped. His\r\nunhallowed words filled me with horror and sternly I bade him begone\r\nand do penance for his crime, saying that I would pray the goddess on\r\nbehalf of him.\r\n\r\n“He went, leaving me alone lost in thought in the darkening shrine.\r\nThen sleep fell on me and in my sleep I dreamed a dream, or saw a\r\nvision. For suddenly there stood before me a woman beauteous as myself\r\nclad in nothing save a golden girdle and a veil of gossamer.\r\n\r\n“‘O Ayesha,’ she said in a honeyed voice, ‘priestess of Isis of the\r\nEgyptians, sworn to the barren worship of Isis and fed on the ashes of\r\nher unprofitable wisdom, know that I am Aphrodite of the Greeks whom\r\nmany times thou hast mocked and defied, and Queen of the breathing\r\nworld, as Isis is Queen of the world that is dead. Now because thou\r\ndidst despise me and pour contempt upon my name, I smite thee with my\r\nstrength and lay a curse upon thee. It is that thou shalt love and\r\ndesire this man who but now hath kissed thy feet, ever longing till the\r\nworld’s end to kiss his lips in payment, although thou art as far above\r\nhim as the moon thou servest is above the Nile. Think not that thou\r\nshalt escape my doom, for know that however strong the spirit, here\r\nupon the earth the flesh is stronger still and of all flesh I am the\r\nqueen.’\r\n\r\n“Then she laughed softly and smiting me across the eyes with a lock of\r\nher scented hair, was gone.\r\n\r\n“Allan, I awoke from my sleep and a great trouble fell upon me, for I\r\nwho had never loved before now was rent with a rage of love and for\r\nthis man who till that moment had been naught to me but as some\r\nbeauteous image of gold and ivory. I longed for him, my heart was\r\nracked with jealousy because of the Egyptian who favoured him, an\r\neating flame possessed my breast. I grew mad. There in the shrine of\r\nIsis the divine I cast myself upon my knees and cried to Aphrodite to\r\nreturn and give me him I sought, for whose sake I would renounce all\r\nelse, even if I must pour my wisdom into a beauteous, empty cup. Yes,\r\nthus I prayed and lay upon the ground and wept until, outworn, once\r\nmore sleep fell upon me.\r\n\r\n“Now in the darkness of the holy place once more there came a dream or\r\nvision, since before me in her glory stood the goddess Isis crowned\r\nwith the crescent of the young moon and holding in her hand the\r\njewelled _sistrum_ that is her symbol, from which came music like to\r\nthe melody of distant bells. She gazed at me and in her great eyes were\r\nscorn and anger.\r\n\r\n“‘O Ayesha, Daughter of Wisdom,’ she said in a solemn voice, ‘whom I,\r\nIsis, had come to look upon rather as a child than a servant, since in\r\nnone other of my priestesses was such greatness to be found, and whom\r\nin a day to be I had purposed to raise to the very steps of my heavenly\r\nthrone, thou hast broken thine oath and, forsaking me, hast worshipped\r\nfalse Aphrodite of the Greeks who is mine enemy. Yea, in the eternal\r\nwar between the spirit and the flesh, thou hast chosen the part of\r\nflesh. Therefore I hate thee and add my doom to that which Aphrodite\r\nlaid upon thee, which, hadst thou prayed to me and not to her, I would\r\nhave lifted from thy heart.\r\n\r\n“‘Hearken! The Grecian whom thou hast chosen, by Aphrodite’s will, thou\r\nshalt love as the Pathian said. More, thy love shall bring his blood\r\nupon thy hands, nor mayest thou follow him to the grave. For I will\r\nshow thee the Source of Life and thou shalt drink of it to make thyself\r\nmore fair even than thou art and thus outpace thy rival, and when thy\r\nlover is dead, in a desolate place thou shalt wait in grief and\r\nsolitude till he is born again and find thee there.\r\n\r\n“‘Yet shall this be but the beginning of thy sorrows, since through all\r\ntime thou shalt pursue thy fate till at length thou canst draw up this\r\nman to the height on which thine own soul stands by the ropes of love\r\nand loss and suffering. Moreover through it all thou shalt despise\r\nthyself, which is man’s and woman’s hardest lot, thou who having the\r\nrare feast of spirit spread out before thee, hast chosen to fill\r\nthyself from the troughs of flesh.’\r\n\r\n“Then, Allan, in my dream I made a proud answer to the goddess, saying,\r\n‘Hear me, mighty mistress of many Forms who dost appear in all that\r\nlives! An evil fate has fallen upon me, but was it I who chose that\r\nfate? Can the leaf contend against the driving gale? Can the falling\r\nstone turn upwards to the sky, or when Nature draws it, can the tide\r\ncease to flow? A goddess whom I have offended, that goddess whose\r\nstrength causes the whole world to be, has laid her curse upon me and\r\nbecause I have bent before the storm, as bend I must, or break, another\r\ngoddess whom I serve, thou thyself, Mother Isis, hast added to the\r\ncurse. Where then is Justice, O Lady of the Moon?’\r\n\r\n“‘Not here, Woman,’ she answered. ‘Yet far away Justice lives and shall\r\nbe won at last and mayhap because thou art so proud and high-stomached,\r\nit is laid upon thee to seek her blinded eyes through many an age. Yet\r\nat last I think thou shalt set thy sins against her weights and find\r\nthe balance even. Therefore cease from questioning the high decrees of\r\ndestiny which thou canst not understand and be content to suffer,\r\nremembering that all joy grows from the root of pain. Moreover, know\r\nthis for thy comfort, that the wisdom which thou hast shall grow and\r\ngather on thee and with it thy beauty and thy power; also that at the\r\nlast thou shalt look upon my face again, in token whereof I leave to\r\nthee my symbol, the _sistrum_ that I bear, and with it this command.\r\nFollow that false priest of mine wherever he may go and avenge me upon\r\nhim, and if thou lose him there, wait while the generations pass till\r\nhe return again. Such and no other is thy destiny.’\r\n\r\n“Allan, the vision faded and when I awoke the lights of dawn played\r\nupon the image of the goddess in the sanctuary. They played, moreover,\r\nupon the holy jewelled thing that in my dream her hand had held, the\r\n_sistrum_ of her worship, shaped like the loop of life, the magic\r\nsymbol that she had vowed to me, wherewith goes her power, which\r\nhenceforth was mine.\r\n\r\n“I took it and followed after the priest Kallikrates, to whom\r\nthenceforward I was bound by passion’s ties that are stronger than all\r\nthe goddesses in this wide universe.”\r\n\r\nHere I, Allan, could contain myself no longer and asked, “What for?”\r\nthen, fearing her wrath, wished that I had been silent.\r\n\r\nBut she was not angry, perhaps because this tale of her interviews with\r\ngoddesses, doubtless fabled, had made her humble, for she answered\r\nquietly,\r\n\r\n“By Aphrodite, or by Isis, or both of them I did not know. All I knew\r\nwas that I _must_ seek him, then and evermore, as seek I do to-day and\r\nshall perchance through æons yet unborn. So I followed, as I was taught\r\nand commanded, the _sistrum_ being my guide, how it matters not, and\r\ngiving me the means, and so at last I came to this ancient land whereof\r\nthe ruin in which you sit was once known as Kôr.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nALLAN MISSES OPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the while that she was talking thus the Lady or the Queen or the\r\nWitch-woman, Ayesha, had been walking up and down the place from the\r\ncurtains to the foot of the dais, sweeping me with her scented robes as\r\nshe passed to and fro, and as she walked she waved her arms as an\r\norator might do to emphasise the more moving passages of her tale. Now\r\nat the end of it, or what I took to be the end, she stepped on to the\r\ndais and sank upon the couch as if exhausted, though I think her spirit\r\nwas weary rather than her body.\r\n\r\nHere she sat awhile, brooding, her chin resting on her hand, then\r\nsuddenly looked up and fixing her glance upon me—for I could see the\r\nflash of it through her thin veil—said,\r\n\r\n“What think you of this story, Allan? Do you believe it and have you\r\never heard its like?”\r\n\r\n“_Never_,” I answered with emphasis, “and of course I believe every\r\nword. Only there are one or two questions that with your leave I would\r\nwish to ask, Ayesha.”\r\n\r\n“By which you mean, Allan, that you believe nothing, being by nature\r\nwithout faith and doubtful of all that you cannot see and touch and\r\nhandle. Well, perhaps you are wise, since what I have told you is not\r\nall the truth. For example, it comes back to me now that it was not in\r\nthe temple on the Nile, or indeed upon the Earth, that I saw the vision\r\nof Aphrodite and of Isis, but elsewhere; also that it was here in Kôr\r\nthat I was first consumed by passion for Kallikrates whom hitherto I\r\nhad scorned. In two thousand years one forgets much, Allan. Out with\r\nyour questions and I will answer them, unless they be too long.”\r\n\r\n“Ayesha,” I said humbly, reflecting to myself that my questions would,\r\nat any rate, be shorter than her varying tale, “even I who am not\r\nlearned have heard of these goddesses of whom you speak, of the Grecian\r\nAphrodite who rose from the sea upon the shores of Cyprus and dwelt at\r\nPaphos and elsewhere——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, doubtless like most men you have heard of her and perchance also\r\nhave been struck across the eyes with her hair, like your betters\r\nbefore you,” she interrupted with sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“——Also,” I went on, avoiding argument, “I have heard of Isis of the\r\nEgyptians, Lady of the Moon, Mother of Mysteries, Spouse of Osiris\r\nwhose child was Horus the Avenger.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, and I think will hear more of her before you have done, Allan,\r\nfor now something comes back to me concerning you and her and another.\r\nI am not the only one who has broken the oaths of Isis and received her\r\ncurse, Allan, as _you_ may find out in the days to come. But what of\r\nthese heavenly queens?”\r\n\r\n“Only this, Ayesha; I have been taught that they were but phantasms\r\nfabled by men with many another false divinity, and could have sworn\r\nthat this was true. And yet you talk of them as real and living, which\r\nperplexes me.”\r\n\r\n“Being dull of understanding doubtless it perplexes you, Allan. Yet if\r\nyou had imagination you might understand that these goddesses are great\r\nPrinciples of Nature; Isis, of throned Wisdom and strait virtue, and\r\nAphrodite, of Love, as it is known to men and women who, being human,\r\nhave it laid upon them that they must hand on the torch of Life in\r\ntheir little hour. Also you would know that such Principles can seem to\r\ntake shape and form and at certain ages of the world appear to their\r\nservants visible in majesty, though perchance to-day others with\r\nchanged names wield their sceptres and work their will. Now you are\r\nanswered on this matter. So to the next.”\r\n\r\nPrivately I did not feel as though I were answered at all and I was\r\nsure that I know nothing of the kind she indicated, but thinking it\r\nbest to leave the subject, I went on,\r\n\r\n“If I understood rightly, Ayesha, the events which you have been\r\npleased first to describe to me, and then to qualify or contradict,\r\ntook place when the Pharaohs reigned. Now no Pharaoh has sat upon the\r\nthrone of Egypt for near two thousand years, for the last was a Grecian\r\nwoman whom the Romans conquered and drove to death. And yet, Ayesha,\r\nyou speak as though you have lived all through that gulf of time, and\r\nin this there must be error, because it is impossible. Therefore I\r\nsuppose you to mean that this history has come down to you in writing,\r\nor perhaps in dreams. I believe that even in such far-off times there\r\nwere writers of romance, and we all know of what stuff dreams are made.\r\nAt least this thought comes to me,” I added hurriedly, fearing lest I\r\nhad said too much, “and one so wise as you are, I repeat, knows well\r\nthat a woman who says she has lived two thousand years must be mad\r\nor—suffer from delusions, because I repeat, it is impossible.”\r\n\r\nAt these quite innocent remarks she sprang to her feet in a rage that\r\nmight truly be called royal in every sense.\r\n\r\n“Impossible! Romance! Dreams! Delusions! Mad!” she cried in a ringing\r\nvoice. “Oh! of a truth you weary me, and I have a mind to send you\r\nwhither you will learn what is impossible and what is not. Indeed, I\r\nwould do it, and now, only I need your services, and if I did there\r\nwould be none left for me to talk with, since your companion is\r\nmoonstruck and the others are but savages of whom I have seen enough.\r\n\r\n“Hearken, fool! _Nothing_ is impossible. Why do you seek, you who talk\r\nof the impossible, to girdle the great world in the span of your two\r\nhands and to weigh the secrets of the Universe in the balance of your\r\npetty mind and, of that which you cannot understand, to say that it is\r\nnot? Life you admit because you see it all about you. But that it\r\nshould endure for two thousand years, which after all is but a second’s\r\nbeat in the story of the earth, that to you is ‘impossible,’ although\r\nin truth the buried seed or the sealed-up toad can live as long.\r\nDoubtless, also, you have some faith which promises you this same boon\r\nto all eternity, after the little change called Death.\r\n\r\n“Nay, Allan, it is possible enough, like to many other things of which\r\nyou do not dream to-day that will be common to the eyes of those who\r\nfollow after you. Mayhap you think it impossible that I should speak\r\nwith and learn of you from yonder old black wizard who dwells in the\r\ncountry whence you came. And yet whenever I will I do so in the night\r\nbecause he is in tune with me, and what I do shall be done by all men\r\nin the years unborn. Yes, they shall talk together across the wide\r\nspaces of the earth, and the lover shall hear her lover’s voice\r\nalthough great seas roll between them. Nor perchance will it stop at\r\nthis; perchance in future time men shall hold converse with the\r\ndenizens of the stars, and even with the dead who have passed into\r\nsilence and the darkness. Do you hear and understand me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” I answered feebly.\r\n\r\n“You lie, as you are too prone to do. You hear but you do not\r\nunderstand nor believe, and oh! you vex me sorely. Now I had it in my\r\nmind to tell you the secret of this long life of mine; long, mark you,\r\nbut not endless, for doubtless I must die and change and return again,\r\nlike others, and even to show you how it may be won. But you are not\r\nworthy in your faithlessness.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, I am not worthy,” I answered, who at that moment did not feel\r\nthe least desire to live two thousand years, perhaps with this woman as\r\na neighbour, rating me from generation to generation. Yet it is true,\r\nthat now when I am older and a certain event cannot be postponed much\r\nlonger, I do often regret that I neglected to take this unique chance,\r\nif in truth there was one, of prolonging an existence which after all\r\nhas its consolations—especially when one has made one’s pile. Certainly\r\nit is a case, a flagrant case, of neglected opportunities, and my only\r\nconsolation for having lost them is that this was due to the\r\nuprightness of my nature which made it so hard for me to acquiesce in\r\nalternative statements that I had every cause to disbelieve and thus to\r\ngive offence to a very powerful and petulant if attractive lady.\r\n\r\n“So that is done with,” she went on with a little stamp of indignation,\r\n“as soon you will be also, who, had you not crossed and doubted me,\r\nmight have lived on for untold time and become one of the masters of\r\nthe world, as I am.”\r\n\r\nHere she paused, choked, I think, with her almost childish anger, and\r\nbecause I could not help it, I said,\r\n\r\n“Such place and power, if they be yours, Ayesha, do not seem to bring\r\nyou much reward. If I were a master of the world I do not think that I\r\nshould choose to dwell unchangingly among savages who eat men and in a\r\npile of ruins. But perhaps the curses of Aphrodite and of Isis are\r\nstronger masters still?” and I paused inquiringly.\r\n\r\nThis bold argument—for now I see that it was bold—seemed to astonish\r\nand even bewilder my wonderful companion.\r\n\r\n“You have more wisdom than I thought,” she said reflectively, “who have\r\ncome to understand that no one is really lord of anything, since above\r\nthere is always a more powerful lord who withers all his pomp and pride\r\nto nothingness, even as the great kings learned in olden days, and I,\r\nwho am higher than they are, am learning now. Hearken. Troubles beset\r\nme wherein I would have your help and that of your companions, for\r\nwhich I will pay each of you the fee that he desires. The brooding\r\nwhite man who is with you shall free his daughter and unharmed; though\r\nthat _he_ will be unharmed I do not promise. The black savage captain\r\nshall fight his fill and gain the glory that he seeks, also something\r\nthat he seeks still more. The little yellow man asks nothing save to be\r\nwith his master like a dog and to satisfy at once his stomach and his\r\napish curiosity. You, Allan, shall see those dead over whom you brood\r\nat night, though the other guerdon that you might have won is now\r\npassed from your reach because you mock me in your heart.”\r\n\r\n“What must we do to gain these things?” I asked. “How can we humble\r\ncreatures help one who is all powerful and who has gathered in her\r\nbreast the infinite knowledge of two thousand years?”\r\n\r\n“You must make war under my banner and rid me of my foes. As for the\r\nreason, listen to the end of my tale and you shall learn.”\r\n\r\nI reflected that it was a marvellous thing that this queen who claimed\r\nsupernatural powers should need our help in a war, but thinking it\r\nwiser to keep my meditations to myself, said nothing. As a matter of\r\nfact I might just as well have spoken, since as usual she read my\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n“You are thinking that it is strange, Allan, that I, the Mighty and\r\nUndying, should seek your aid in some petty tribal battle, and so it\r\nwould be were my foes but common savages. But they are more; they are\r\nmen protected by the ancient god of this immemorial city of Kôr, a\r\ngreat god in his day whose spirit still haunts these ruins and whose\r\nstrength still protects the worshippers who cling to him and practise\r\nhis unholy rites of human sacrifice.”\r\n\r\n“How was this god named?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“_Rezu_ was his name, and from him came the Egyptian Re or Ra, since in\r\nthe beginning Kôr was the mother of Egypt and the conquering people of\r\nKôr took their god with them when they burst into the valley of the\r\nNile and subdued its peoples long before the first Pharaoh, Menes, wore\r\nEgypt’s crown.”\r\n\r\n“Ra was the sun, was he not?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Aye, and Rezu also was a sun-god whom from his throne in the fires of\r\nthe Lord of Day, gave life to men, or slew them if he willed with his\r\nthunderbolts of drought and pestilence and storm. He was no gentle king\r\nof heaven, but one who demanded blood-sacrifice from his worshippers,\r\nyes, even that of maids and children. So it came about that the people\r\nof Kôr, who saw their virgins slain and eaten by the priests of Rezu,\r\nand their infants burned to ashes in the fires that his rays lit,\r\nturned themselves to the worship of the gentle moon, the goddess whom\r\nthey named _Lulala_, while some of them chose Truth for their queen,\r\nsince Truth, they said, was greater and more to be desired than the\r\nfierce Sun-King or even the sweet Moon-Lady, Truth, who sat above them\r\nboth throned in the furthest stars of Heaven. Then the demon, Rezu,\r\ngrew wroth and sent a pestilence upon Kôr and its subject lands and\r\nslew their people, save those who clung to him in the great apostasy,\r\nand with them some others who served Lulala and Truth the Divine, that\r\nescaped I know not how.”\r\n\r\n“Did you see this great pestilence?” I asked, much interested.\r\n\r\n“Nay, it befell generations before I came to Kôr. One Junis, a priest,\r\nwrote a record of it in the caves yonder where I have my home and where\r\nis the burying-place of the countless thousands that it slew. In my day\r\nKôr, of which, should you desire to hear it, I will tell you the\r\nhistory, was a ruin as it is now, though scattered in the lands amidst\r\nthe tumbled stones which once built up her subject cities, a people\r\nnamed the Amahagger dwelt in Households, or Tribes and there sacrificed\r\nmen by fire and devoured them, following the rites of the demon Rezu.\r\nFor these were the descendants of those who escaped the pestilence.\r\nAlso there were certain others, children of the worshippers of Lulala\r\nwhose kingdom is the moon, and of Truth the Queen, who clung to the\r\ngentle worship of their forefathers and were ever at war with the\r\nfollowers of Rezu.”\r\n\r\n“What brought _you_ to Kôr, Ayesha?” I asked irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n“Have I not said that I was led hither by the command and the symbol of\r\ngreat Isis whom I serve? Also,” she added after a pause, “that I might\r\nfind a certain pair, one of whom had broken his oaths to her, tempted\r\nthereto by the other.”\r\n\r\n“And did you find them, Ayesha?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Aye, I found them, or rather they found me, and in my presence the\r\ngoddess executed her decree upon her false priest and drove his\r\ntemptress back to the world.”\r\n\r\n“That must have been dreadful for you, Ayesha, since I understood that\r\nyou also—liked this priest.”\r\n\r\nShe sprang from her couch and in a low, hissing voice which resembled\r\nthe sound made by an angry snake and turned my blood cold to hear,\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n“Man, do you dare to mock me? Nay, you are but a blundering, curious\r\nfool, and it is well for you that this is so, since otherwise like\r\nKallikrates, never should you leave Kôr living. Cease from seeking that\r\nwhich you may not learn. Suffice it for you to know that the doom of\r\nIsis fell upon the lost Kallikrates, her priest forsworn, and that on\r\nme also fell her doom, who must dwell here, dead yet living, till he\r\nreturn again and the play begins afresh.\r\n\r\n“Stranger,” she went on in a softer voice, “perchance your faith,\r\nwhate’er it be, parades a hell to terrify its worshippers and give\r\nstrength to the arms of its prophesying priests, who swear they hold\r\nthe keys of doom or of the eternal joys. I see you sign assent” (I had\r\nnodded at her extremely accurate guess) “and therefore can understand\r\nthat in such a hell as this, here upon the earth I have dwelt for some\r\ntwo thousand years, expiating the crime of Powers above me whereof I am\r\nbut the hand and instrument, since those Powers which decreed that I\r\nshould love, decree also that I must avenge that love.”\r\n\r\nShe sank down upon the couch as though exhausted by emotion, of which I\r\ncould only guess the reasons, hiding her face in her hands. Presently\r\nshe let them fall again and continued,\r\n\r\n“Of these woes ask me no more. They sleep till the hour of their\r\nresurrection, which I think draws nigh; indeed, I thought that you\r\nperchance——But let that be. ‘Twas near the mark; nearer, Allan, than\r\nyou know, not in it! Therefore leave them to their sleep as I would if\r\nI might—ah! if I might, whose companions they are throughout the weary\r\nages. Alas! that through the secret which was revealed to me I remain\r\nundying on the earth who in death might perhaps have found a rest, and\r\nbeing human although half divine, must still busy myself with the\r\naffairs of earth.\r\n\r\n“Look you, Wanderer, after that which was fated had happened and I\r\nremained in my agony of solitude and sorrow, after, too, I had drunk of\r\nthe cup of enduring life and like the Prometheus of old fable, found\r\nmyself bound to this changeless rock, whereon day by day the vultures\r\nof remorse tear out my living heart which in the watches of the night\r\nis ever doomed to grow again within my woman’s breast, I was plunged\r\ninto petty troubles of the flesh, aye and welcomed them because their\r\nirk at times gave me forgetfulness. When the savage dwellers in this\r\nland came to know that a mighty one had arisen among them who was the\r\nservant of the Lady of the Moon, those of them who still worshipped\r\ntheir goddess Lulala, gathered themselves about me, while those of them\r\nwho worshipped Rezu sought to overthrow me.\r\n\r\n“‘Here,’ they said, ‘is the goddess Lulala come to earth. In the name\r\nof Rezu let us slay her and make an end,’ for these fools thought that\r\nI could be killed. Allan, I conquered them, but their captain, who also\r\nis named Rezu and whom they held and hold to be an emanation of the god\r\nhimself walking the earth, I could not conquer.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“For this reason, Allan. In some past age his god showed him the same\r\nsecret that was shown to me. He too had drunk of the Cup of Life and\r\nlives on unharmed by Time, so that being in strength my equal, no spear\r\nof mine can reach his heart clad in the armour of his evil god.”\r\n\r\n“Then what spear can?” I inquired helplessly, who was bewildered.\r\n\r\n“None at all, Allan, yet an _axe_ may, as you shall hear, or so I\r\nthink. For many generations there has been peace of a sort between the\r\nworshippers of Lulala who dwell with me in the Plain of Kôr, or rather\r\nof myself, since to these people _I_ am Lulala, and the worshippers of\r\nRezu, who dwell in the strongholds beyond the mountain crest. But of\r\nlate years their chief Rezu, having devastated the lands about, has\r\ngrown restless and threatened attack on Kôr, which is not strong enough\r\nto stand against him. Moreover he has sought for a white queen to rule\r\nunder him, purposing to set her up to mock my majesty.”\r\n\r\n“Is that why those cannibals carried away the daughter of my companion,\r\nthe Sea-Captain who is named Avenger?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It is, Allan, since presently he will give it out that I am dead or\r\nfled, if he has not done so already, and that this new queen has arisen\r\nin my place. Thereby he hopes to draw away many who cling to me ere he\r\nadvances upon Kôr, carrying with him this girl veiled as I am, so that\r\nnone may know the difference between us, since not a man of them has\r\never looked upon my face, Allan. Therefore this Rezu must die, if die\r\nhe can; otherwise, although it is impossible that he should harm me, he\r\nmay slay or draw away my people and leave me with none to rule in this\r\nplace where by the decree of Fate I must dwell on until he whom I seek\r\nreturns. You are thinking in your heart that such savages would be\r\nlittle loss and this is so, but still they serve as slaves to me in my\r\nloneliness. Moreover I have sworn to protect them from the demon Rezu\r\nand they have trusted in me and therefore my honour is at stake, for\r\nnever shall it be said that those who trusted in She-who-commands, were\r\noverthrown because they put faith in one who was powerless.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean about an axe, Ayesha?” I asked. “Why can an axe alone\r\nkill Rezu?”\r\n\r\n“The thing is a mystery, O Allan, of which I may not tell you all,\r\nsince to do so I must reveal secrets which I have determined you shall\r\nnot learn. Suffice it to you to know that when this Rezu drank of the\r\nCup of Life he took with him his axe. Now this axe was an ancient\r\nweapon rumoured to have been fashioned by the gods and, as it chanced,\r\nthat axe drew to itself more and stronger life than did Rezu, how, it\r\ndoes not matter, if indeed the tale be more than a fable. At least this\r\nI know is true, for he who guarded the Gate of Life, a certain Noot, a\r\nmaster of mysteries, and mine also in my day of youth, who being a\r\nphilosopher and very wise, chose never to pass that portal which was\r\nopen to him, said it to me himself ere he went the way of flesh. He\r\ntold this Rezu also that now he had naught to fear save his own axe and\r\ntherefore he counselled him to guard it well, since if it was lifted\r\nagainst him in another’s hands it would bring him down to death, which\r\nnothing else could do. Like to the heel of Achilles whereof the great\r\nHomer sings—have you read Homer, Allan?”\r\n\r\n“In a translation,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Good, then you will remember the story. Like to the heel of Achilles,\r\nI say, that axe would be the only gate by which death could enter his\r\ninvulnerable flesh, or rather it alone could make the gate.”\r\n\r\n“How did Noot know that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I cannot say,” she answered with irritation. “Perchance he did not\r\nknow it. Perchance it is all an idle tale, but at least it is true that\r\nRezu believed and believes it, and what a man believes is true for him\r\nand will certainly befall. If it were otherwise, what is the use of\r\nfaith which in a thousand forms supports our race and holds it from the\r\nhorrors of the Pit? Only those who believe nothing inherit what they\r\nbelieve—nothing, Allan.”\r\n\r\n“It may be so,” I replied prosaically, “but what happened about the\r\naxe?”\r\n\r\n“In the end it was lost, or as some say stolen by a woman whom Rezu had\r\ndeserted, and therefore he walks the world in fear from day to day.\r\nNay, ask no more empty questions” (I had opened my mouth to speak) “but\r\nhear the end of the tale. In my trouble concerning Rezu I remembered\r\nthis wild legend of the axe and since, when lost in a forest every path\r\nthat may lead to safety should be explored, I sent my wisdom forth to\r\nmake inquiry concerning it, as I who am great, have the power to do, of\r\ncertain who are in tune with me throughout this wide land of Africa.\r\nAmongst others, I inquired of that old wizard whom you named Zikali,\r\nOpener of Roads, and he gave me an answer that there lived in his land\r\na certain warrior who ruled a tribe called the People of the Axe by\r\nright of the Axe, of which axe none, not even he, knew the beginning or\r\nthe legend. On the chance, though it was a small one, I bade the wizard\r\nsend that warrior here with his axe. Last night he stood before me and\r\nI looked upon him and the axe, which at least is ancient and has a\r\nstory. Whether it be the same that Rezu bore I do not know who never\r\nsaw it, yet perchance he who bears it now is prepared to hold it aloft\r\nin battle even against Rezu, though he be terrible to see, and then we\r\nshall learn.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes,” I answered, “he is quite prepared, for that is his nature.\r\nAlso among this man’s people, the holder of the Axe is thought to be\r\nunconquerable.”\r\n\r\n“Yet some must have been conquered who held it,” she replied musingly.\r\n“Well, you shall tell me that tale later. Now we have talked long and\r\nyou are weary and astonished. Go, eat and rest yourself. To-night when\r\nthe moon rises I will come to where you are, not before, for I have\r\nmuch that must be done, and show you those with whom you must fight\r\nagainst Rezu, and make a plan of battle.”\r\n\r\n“But I do not want to fight,” I answered, “who have fought enough and\r\ncame here to seek wisdom, not bloodshed.”\r\n\r\n“First the sacrifice, then the reward,” she answered, “that is if any\r\nare left to be rewarded. Farewell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nROBERTSON IS LOST\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I went and was conducted by Billali, the old chamberlain, for such\r\nseemed to be his office, who had been waiting patiently without all\r\nthis while, back to our rest-house. On my way I picked up Hans, whom I\r\nfound sitting outside the arch, and found that as usual that worthy had\r\nbeen keeping his eyes and ears open.\r\n\r\n“Baas,” he said, “did the White Witch tell you that there is a big\r\n_impi_ encamped over yonder outside the houses, in what looks like a\r\ngreat dry ditch, and on the edge of the plain beyond?”\r\n\r\n“No, Hans, but she said that this evening she would show us those in\r\nwhose company we must fight.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Baas, they are there, some thousands of them, for I crept\r\nthrough the broken walls like a snake and saw them. And, Baas, I do not\r\nthink they are men, I think that they are evil spirits who walk at\r\nnight only.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Hans?”\r\n\r\n“Because when the sun is high, Baas, as it is now, they are all\r\nsleeping. Yes, there they lie abed, fast asleep, as other people do at\r\nnight, with only a few sentries out on guard, and these are yawning and\r\nrubbing their eyes.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard that there are folk like that in the middle of Africa\r\nwhere the sun is very hot, Hans,” I answered, “which perhaps is why\r\nShe-who-commands is going to take us to see them at night. Also these\r\npeople, it seems, are worshippers of the moon.”\r\n\r\n“No, Baas, they are worshippers of the devil and that White Witch is\r\nhis wife.”\r\n\r\n“You had better keep your thoughts to yourself, Hans, for whatever she\r\nis I think that she can read thoughts from far away, as you guessed\r\nlast night. Therefore I would not have any if I were you.”\r\n\r\n“No, Baas, or if I must think, henceforth, it shall be only of gin\r\nwhich in this place is also far away,” he replied, grinning.\r\n\r\nThen we came to the rest-house where I found that Robertson had already\r\neaten his midday meal and like the Amahagger gone to sleep, while\r\napparently Umslopogaas had done the same; at least I saw nothing of\r\nhim. Of this I was glad, since that wondrous Ayesha seemed to draw\r\nvitality out of me and after my long talk with her I felt very tired.\r\nSo I too ate and then went to lie down under an old wall in the shade\r\nat a little distance, and to reflect upon the marvellous things that I\r\nhad heard.\r\n\r\nHere be it said at once that I believed nothing of them, or at least\r\nvery little indeed. All the involved tale of Ayesha’s long life I\r\ndismissed at once as incredible. Clearly she was some beautiful woman\r\nwho was more or less mad and suffered from megalomania; probably an\r\nArab, who had wandered to this place for reasons of her own, and become\r\nthe chieftainess of a savage tribe whose traditions she had absorbed\r\nand reproduced as personal experiences, again for reasons of her own.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, she was now threatened by another tribe and knowing that\r\nwe had guns and could fight from what happened on the yesterday, wished\r\nnaturally enough for our assistance in the coming battle. As for the\r\nmarvellous chief Rezu, or rather for his supernatural attributes and\r\nall the cock-and-bull story about an axe—well, it was humbug like the\r\nrest, and if she believed in it she must be more foolish than I took\r\nher to be—even if she were unhinged on certain points. For the rest,\r\nher information about myself and Umslopogaas doubtless had reached her\r\nfrom Zikali in some obscure fashion, as she herself acknowledged.\r\n\r\nBut heavens! how beautiful she was! That flash of loveliness when out\r\nof pique or coquetry she lifted her veil, blinded like the lightning.\r\nBut thank goodness, also like the lightning it frightened;\r\ninstinctively one felt that it was very dangerous, even to death, and\r\nwith it I for one wished no closer acquaintance. Fire may be lovely and\r\nattractive, also comforting at a proper distance, but he who sits on\r\nthe top of it is cremated, as many a moth has found.\r\n\r\nSo I argued, knowing well enough all the while that if this particular\r\nhuman—or inhuman—fire desired to make an holocaust of me, it could do\r\nso easily enough, and that in reality I owed my safety so far to a lack\r\nof that desire on its part. The glorious Ayesha saw nothing to attract\r\nher in an insignificant and withered hunter, or at any rate in his\r\nexterior, though with his mind she might find some small affinity.\r\nMoreover to make a fool of him just for the fun of it would not serve\r\nher purpose, since she needed his assistance in a business that\r\nnecessitated clear wits and unprejudiced judgment.\r\n\r\nLastly she had declared herself to be absorbed in some tiresome\r\ncomplication with another man, of which it was rather difficult to\r\nfollow the details. It is true that she described him as a handsome but\r\nsomewhat empty-headed person whom she had last seen two thousand years\r\nago, but probably this only meant that she thought poorly of him\r\nbecause he had preferred some other woman to herself, while the two\r\nthousand years were added to the tale to give it atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe worst of scandals becomes romantic and even respectable in two\r\nthousand years; witness that of Cleopatra with Cæsar, Mark Antony and\r\nother gentlemen. The most virtuous read of Cleopatra with sympathy,\r\neven in boarding-schools, and it is felt that were she by some miracle\r\nto be blotted out of the book of history, the loss would be enormous.\r\nThe same applied to Helen, Phryne, and other bad lots. In fact now that\r\none comes to think of it, most of the attractive personages in history,\r\nmale or female, especially the latter, were bad lots. When we find\r\nsomeone to whose name is added “the good” we skip. No doubt Ayesha,\r\nbeing very clever, appreciated this regrettable truth, and therefore\r\nmoved her murky entanglements of the past decade or so back for a\r\ncouple of thousand years, as many of us would like to do.\r\n\r\nThere remained the very curious circumstance of her apparent\r\ncorrespondence with old Zikali who lived far away. This, however, after\r\nall was not inexplicable. In the course of a great deal of experience I\r\nhave observed that all the witch-doctor family, to which doubtless she\r\nbelonged, have strange means of communication.\r\n\r\nIn most instances these are no doubt physical, carried on by help of\r\nmessengers, or messages passed from one to the other. But sometimes it\r\nis reasonable to assume what is known as telepathy, as their link of\r\nintercourse. Between two such highly developed experts as Ayesha and\r\nZikali, it might for the sake of argument safely be supposed that it\r\nwas thus they learned each other’s mind and co-operated in each other’s\r\nprojects, though perhaps this end was effected by commoner methods.\r\n\r\nWhatever its interpretations, the issue of the business seemed to be\r\nthat I was to be let in for more fighting. Well, in any case this could\r\nnot be avoided, since Robertson’s daughter, Inez, had to be saved at\r\nall costs, if it could possibly be done, even if we lost our lives in\r\nthe attempt. Therefore fight we must, so there was nothing more to be\r\nsaid. Also without doubt this adventure was particularly interesting\r\nand I could only hope that good luck, or Zikali’s Great Medicine, or\r\nrather Providence, would see me through it safely.\r\n\r\nFor the rest the fact that our help was necessary to her in this\r\nwar-like venture showed me clearly enough that all this wonderful\r\nwoman’s pretensions to supernatural powers were the sheerest nonsense.\r\nHad they been otherwise she would not have needed our help in her\r\ntribal fights, notwithstanding the rubbish she talked about the chief,\r\nRezu, who according to her account of him, must resemble one of the\r\nfabulous “trolls,” half-human and half-ghostly evil creatures, of whom\r\nI have read in the Norse Sagas, who could only be slain by some\r\nparticular hero armed with a particular weapon.\r\n\r\nReflecting thus I went to sleep and did not wake until the sun was\r\nsetting. Finding that Hans was also sleeping at my feet just like a\r\nfaithful dog, I woke him up and we went back together to the\r\nrest-house, which we reached as the darkness fell with extraordinary\r\nswiftness, as it does in those latitudes, especially in a place\r\nsurrounded by cliffs.\r\n\r\nNot finding Robertson in the house, I concluded that he was somewhere\r\noutside, possibly making a reconnaissance on his own account, and told\r\nHans to get supper ready for both of us. While he was doing so, by aid\r\nof the Amahagger lamps, Umslopogaas suddenly appeared in the circle of\r\nlight, and looking about him, said,\r\n\r\n“Where is Red-Beard, Macumazahn?”\r\n\r\nI answered that I did not know and waited, for I felt sure that he had\r\nsomething to say.\r\n\r\n“I think that you had better keep Red-Beard close to you, Macumazahn,”\r\nhe went on. “This afternoon, when you had returned from visiting the\r\nwhite doctoress and having eaten, had gone to sleep under the wall\r\nyonder, I saw Red-Beard come out of the house carrying a gun and a bag\r\nof cartridges. His eyes rolled wildly and he turned first this way and\r\nthen that, sniffing at the air, like a buck that scents danger. Then he\r\nbegan to talk aloud in his own tongue and as I saw that he was speaking\r\nwith his Spirit, as those do who are mad, I went away and left him.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Because, as you know, Macumazahn, it is a law among us Zulus never to\r\ndisturb one who is mad and engaged in talking with his Spirit.\r\nMoreover, had I done so, probably he would have shot me, nor should I\r\nhave complained who would have thrust myself in where I had no right to\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you not come to call me, Umslopogaas?”\r\n\r\n“Because then he might have shot you, for, as I have seen for some time\r\nhe is inspired of heaven and knows not what he does upon the earth,\r\nthinking only of the Lady Sad-Eyes who has been stolen away from him,\r\nas is but natural. So I left him walking up and down, and when I\r\nreturned later to look, saw that he was gone, as I thought into this\r\nwalled hut. Now when Hansi tells me that he is not here, I have come to\r\nspeak to you about him.”\r\n\r\n“No, certainly he is not here,” I said, and I went to look at the bed\r\nwhere Robertson slept to see if it had been used that evening.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time I saw lying on it a piece of paper torn from a\r\npocketbook and addressed to myself. I seized and read it. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n“The merciful Lord has sent me a vision of Inez and shown me where she\r\nis over the cliff-edge away to the west, also the road to her. In my\r\nsleep I heard her talking to me. She told me that she is in great\r\ndanger—that they are going to marry her to some brute—and called to me\r\nto come at once and save her; yes, and to come alone without saying\r\nanything to anyone. So I am going at once. Don’t be frightened or\r\ntrouble about me. All will be well, all will be quite well. I will tell\r\nyou the rest when we meet.”\r\n\r\nHorrorstruck I translated this insane screed to Umslopogaas and Hans.\r\nThe former nodded gravely.\r\n\r\n“Did I not tell you that he was talking with his Spirit, Macumazahn?”\r\n(I had rendered “the merciful Lord” as the Good Spirit.) “Well, he has\r\ngone and doubtless his Spirit will take care of him. It is finished.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate we cannot, Baas,” broke in Hans, who I think feared that I\r\nmight send him out to look for Robertson. “I can follow most spoors,\r\nbut not on such a night as this when one could cut the blackness into\r\nlumps and build a wall of it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “he has gone and nothing can be done at present,”\r\nthough to myself I reflected that probably he had not gone far and\r\nwould be found when the moon rose, or at any rate on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nStill I was most uneasy about the man who, as I had noted for a long\r\nwhile, was losing his balance more and more. The shock of the barbarous\r\nand dreadful slaughter of his half-breed children and of the abduction\r\nof Inez by these grim, man-eating savages began the business, and I\r\nthink that it was increased and accentuated by his sudden conversion to\r\ncomplete temperance after years of heavy drinking.\r\n\r\nWhen I persuaded him to this course I was very proud of myself,\r\nthinking that I had done a clever thing, but now I was not so sure.\r\nPerhaps it would have been better if he had continued to drink\r\nsomething, at any rate for a while, but the trouble is that in such\r\ncases there is generally no half-way house. A man, or still more a\r\nwoman, given to this frailty either turns aggressively sober or remains\r\nvery drunken. At any rate, even if I had made a mess of it, I had acted\r\nfor the best and could not blame myself.\r\n\r\nFor the rest it was clear that in his new phase the religious\r\nassociations of his youth had re-asserted themselves with remarkable\r\nvigour, for I gathered that he had been brought up almost as a\r\nCalvinist, and in the rush of their return, had overset his\r\nequilibrium. As I have said, he prayed night and day without any of\r\nthose reserves which most people prefer in their religious exercises,\r\nand when he talked of matters outside our quest, his conversation\r\ngenerally revolved round the devil, or hell and its torments, which, to\r\nsay the truth, did not make him a cheerful companion. Indeed in this\r\nrespect I liked him much better in his old, unregenerate days, being, I\r\nfear, myself a somewhat worldly soul.\r\n\r\nWell, the sum of it was that the poor fellow had gone mad and given us\r\nthe slip, and as Hans said, to search for him at once in that darkness\r\nwas impossible. Indeed, even if it had been lighter, I do not think\r\nthat it would have been safe among these Amahagger nightbirds whom I\r\ndid not trust. Certainly I could not have asked Hans to undertake the\r\ntask, and if I had, I do not think he would have gone since he was\r\nafraid of the Amahagger. Therefore there was nothing to be done except\r\nwait and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nSo I waited till at last the moon came and with it Ayesha, as she had\r\npromised. Clad in a rich, dark cloak she arrived in some pomp, heralded\r\nby Billali, followed by women, also cloaked, and surrounded by a guard\r\nof tall spearmen. I was seated outside the house, smoking, when\r\nsuddenly she arrived from the shadows and stood before me.\r\n\r\nI rose respectfully and bowed, while Umslopogaas, Goroko and the other\r\nZulus who were with me, gave her the royal salute, and Hans cringed\r\nlike a dog that is afraid of being kicked.\r\n\r\nAfter a swift glance at them, as I guessed by the motion of her veiled\r\nhead, she seemed to fix her gaze upon my pipe that evidently excited\r\nher curiosity, and asked me what it was. I explained as well as I\r\ncould, expatiating on the charms of smoking.\r\n\r\n“So men have learned another useless vice since I left the world, and\r\none that is filthy also,” she said, sniffing at the smoke and waving\r\nher hand before her face, whereon I dropped the pipe into my pocket,\r\nwhere, being alight, it burnt a hole in my best remaining coat.\r\n\r\nI remember the remark because it showed me what a clever actress she\r\nwas who, to keep up her character of antiquity, pretended to be\r\nastonished at a habit with which she must have been well acquainted,\r\nalthough I believe that it was unknown in the ancient world.\r\n\r\n“You are troubled,” she went on, swiftly changing the subject, “I read\r\nit in your face. One of your company is missing. Who is it? Ah! I see,\r\nthe white man you name Avenger. Where is he gone?”\r\n\r\n“That is what I wish to ask you, Ayesha,” I said.\r\n\r\n“How can I tell you, Allan, who in this place lack any glass into which\r\nto look for things that pass afar. Still, let me try,” and pressing her\r\nhands to her forehead, she remained silent for perhaps a minute, then\r\nspoke slowly.\r\n\r\n“I think that he has gone over the mountain lip towards the worshippers\r\nof Rezu. I think that he is mad; sorrow and something else which I do\r\nnot understand have turned his brain; something that has to do with the\r\nHeavens. I think also that we shall recover him living, if only for a\r\nlittle while, though of this I cannot be sure since it is not given to\r\nme to read the future, but only the past, and sometimes the things that\r\nhappen in the present though they be far away.”\r\n\r\n“Will you send to search for him, O Ayesha?” I asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Nay, it is useless, for he is already distant. Moreover those who went\r\nmight be taken by the outposts of Rezu, as perchance has happened to\r\nyour companion wandering in his madness. Do you know what he went to\r\nseek?”\r\n\r\n“More or less,” I answered and translated to her the letter that\r\nRobertson had left for me.\r\n\r\n“It may be as the man writes,” she commented, “since the mad often see\r\nwell in their dreams, though these are not sent by a god as he\r\nimagines. The mind in its secret places knows all things, O Allan,\r\nalthough it seems to know little or nothing, and when the breath of\r\nvision or the fury of a soul distraught blows away the veils or burns\r\nthrough the gates of distance, then for a while it sees and learns,\r\nsince, whatever fools may think, often madness is true wisdom. Now\r\nfollow me with the little yellow man and the Warrior of the Axe. Stay,\r\nlet me look upon that axe.”\r\n\r\nI interpreted her wish to Umslopogaas who held it out to her but\r\nrefused to loose it from his wrist to which it was attached by the\r\nleathern thong.\r\n\r\n“Does the Black One think that I shall cut him down with his own\r\nweapon, I who am so weak and gentle?” she asked, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Nay, Ayesha, but it is his law not to part with this Drinker of Lives,\r\nwhich he names ‘Chieftainess and Groan-maker,’ and clings to closer by\r\nday and night than a man does to his wife.”\r\n\r\n“There he is wise, Allan, since a savage captain may get more wives but\r\nnever such another axe. The thing is ancient,” she added musingly after\r\nexamining its every detail, “and who knows? It may be that whereof the\r\nlegend tells which is fated to bring Rezu to the dust. Now ask this\r\nfierce-eyed Slayer whether, armed with his axe he can find courage to\r\nface the most terrible of all men and the strongest, one who is a\r\nwizard also, of whom it is prophesied that only by such an axe as this\r\ncan he be made to bite the dust.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed. Umslopogaas laughed grimly and answered,\r\n\r\n“Say to the White Witch that there is no man living upon the earth whom\r\nI would not face in war, I who have never been conquered in fair fight,\r\nthough once a chance blow brought me to the doors of death,” and he\r\ntouched the great hole in his forehead. “Say to her also that I have no\r\nfear of defeat, I from whom doom is, as I think, still far away, though\r\nthe Opener-of-Roads has told me that among a strange people I shall die\r\nin war at last, as I desire to do, who from my boyhood have lived in\r\nwar.”\r\n\r\n“He speaks well,” she answered with a note of admiration in her voice.\r\n“By Isis, were he but white I would set him to rule these Amahagger\r\nunder me. Tell him, Allan, that if he lays Rezu low he shall have a\r\ngreat reward.”\r\n\r\n“And tell the White Witch, Macumazahn,” Umslopogaas replied when I had\r\ntranslated, “that I seek no reward, save glory only, and with it the\r\nsight of one who is lost to me but with whom my heart still dwells, if\r\nindeed this Witch has strength to break the wall of blackness that is\r\nbuilt between me and her who is ‘gone down.’”\r\n\r\n“Strange,” reflected Ayesha when she understood, “that this grim\r\nDestroyer should yet be bound by the silken bonds of love and yearn for\r\none whom the grave has taken. Learn from it, Allan, that all humanity\r\nis cast in the same mould, since my longings and your longings are his\r\nalso, though the three of us be far apart as are the sun and the moon\r\nand the earth, and as different in every other quality. Yet it is true\r\nthat sun and moon and earth are born of the same black womb of chaos.\r\nTherefore in the beginning they were identical, as doubtless they will\r\nbe in the end when, their journeyings done, they rush together to light\r\nspace with a flame at which the mocking gods that made them may warm\r\ntheir hands. Well, so it is with men, Allan, whose soul-stuff is drawn\r\nfrom the gulf of Spirit by Nature’s hand, and, cast upon the cold air\r\nof this death-driven world, freezes into a million shapes each\r\ndifferent to the other and yet, be sure, the same. Now talk no more,\r\nbut follow me. Slave” (this was addressed to Billali), “bid the guards\r\nlead on to the camp of the servants of Lulala.”\r\n\r\nSo we went through the silent ruins. Ayesha walked, or rather glided a\r\npace or two ahead, then came Umslopogaas and I side by side, while at\r\nour heels followed Hans, very close at our heels since he did not wish\r\nto be out of reach of the virtue of the Great Medicine and incidentally\r\nof the protection of axe and rifle.\r\n\r\nThus we marched surrounded by the solemn guard for something between a\r\nquarter and half a mile, till at length we climbed the debris of a\r\nmighty wall that once had encompassed the city, and by the moonlight\r\nsaw beneath us a vast hollow which clearly at some unknown time had\r\nbeen the bed of an enormous moat and filled with water.\r\n\r\nNow, however, it was dry and all about its surface were dotted numerous\r\ncamp-fires round which men were moving, also some women who appeared to\r\nbe engaged in cooking food. At a little distance too, upon the further\r\nedge of the moat-like depression were a number of white-robed\r\nindividuals gathered in a circle about a large stone upon which\r\nsomething was stretched that resembled the carcase of a sheep or goat,\r\nand round these a great number of spectators.\r\n\r\n“The priests of Lulala who make sacrifice to the moon, as they do night\r\nby night, save when she is dead,” said Ayesha, turning back towards me\r\nas though in answer to the query which I had conceived but left\r\nunuttered.\r\n\r\nWhat struck me about the whole scene was its extraordinary animation\r\nand briskness. All the folk round the fires and outside of them moved\r\nabout quickly and with the same kind of liveliness which might animate\r\na camp of more natural people at the rising of the sun. It was as\r\nthough they had just got up full of vigour to commence their daily, or\r\nrather their nightly round, which in truth was the case, since as Hans\r\ndiscovered, by habitude these Amahagger preferred to sleep during the\r\nday unless something prevented them, and to carry on the activities of\r\nlife at night. It only remains to add that there seemed to be a great\r\nnumber of them, for their fires following the round of the dry moat,\r\nstretched further than I could see.\r\n\r\nScrambling down the crumpled wall by a zig-zag pathway, we came upon\r\nthe outposts of the army beneath us who challenged, then seeing with\r\nwhom they had to do, fell flat upon their faces, leaving their great\r\nspears, which had iron spikes on their shafts like to those of the\r\nMasai, sticking in the ground beside them.\r\n\r\nWe passed on between some of the fires and I noted how solemn and\r\ngloomy, although handsome, were the countenances of the folk by whom\r\nthese were surrounded. Indeed, they looked like denizens of a different\r\nworld to ours, one alien to the kindly race of men. There was nothing\r\nsocial about these Amahagger, who seemed to be a people labouring under\r\nsome ancient ancestral curse of which they could never shake off the\r\nmemory. Even the women rarely smiled; their clear-cut, stately\r\ncountenances remained stern and set, except when they glowered at us\r\nincuriously. Only when Ayesha passed they prostrated themselves like\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nWe went on through them and across the moat, climbing its further slope\r\nand here suddenly came upon a host of men gathered in a hollow square,\r\napparently in order to receive us. They stood in ranks of five or six\r\ndeep and their spear-points glimmering in the moonlight looked like\r\nlong bands of level steel. As we entered the open side of the square\r\nall these spears were lifted. Thrice they were lifted and at each\r\nuplifting there rose a deep-throated cry of _Hiya_, which is the Arabic\r\nfor She, and I suppose was a salutation to Ayesha.\r\n\r\nShe swept on taking no heed, till we came to the centre of the square\r\nwhere a number of men were gathered who prostrated themselves in the\r\nusual fashion. Motioning to them to rise she said,\r\n\r\n“Captains, this very night within two hours we march against Rezu and\r\nthe sun-worshippers, since otherwise as my arts tell me, they march\r\nagainst us. She-who-commands is immortal, as your fathers have known\r\nfrom generation to generation, and cannot be destroyed; but you, her\r\nservants, can be destroyed, and Rezu, who also has drunk of the Cup of\r\nLife, out-numbers you by three to one and prepares a queen to set up in\r\nmy place over his own people and such of you as remain. As though,” she\r\nadded with a contemptuous laugh, “any woman of a day could take my\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\nShe paused and the spokesman of the captains said,\r\n\r\n“We hear, O Hiya, and we understand. What wouldst thou have us do, O\r\nLulala-come-to-earth? The armies of Rezu are great and from the\r\nbeginning he has hated thee and us, also his magic is as thy magic and\r\nhis length of days as thy length of days. How then can we who are few,\r\nthree thousand men at the most, match ourselves against Rezu, Son of\r\nthe Sun? Would it not be better that we should accept the terms of\r\nRezu, which are light, and acknowledge him as our king?”\r\n\r\nAs she heard these words I saw the tall shape of Ayesha quiver beneath\r\nher robes, as I think, not with fear but with rage, because the meaning\r\nof them was clear enough, namely that rather than risk a battle with\r\nRezu, these people were contemplating surrender and her own deposition,\r\nif indeed she could be deposed. Still she answered in a quiet voice,\r\n\r\n“It seems that I have dealt too gently with you and with your fathers,\r\nChildren of Lulala, whose shadow I am here upon the earth, so that\r\nbecause you only see the scabbard, you have forgotten the sword within\r\nand that it can shine forth and smite. Well, why should I be wrath\r\nbecause the brutish will follow the law of brutes, though it be true\r\nthat I am minded to slay you where you stand? Hearken! Were I less\r\nmerciful I would leave you to the clutching hands of Rezu, who would\r\ndrag you one by one to the stone of sacrifice and there offer up your\r\nhearts to his god of fire and devour your bodies with his heat. But I\r\nbethink me of your wives and children and of your forefathers whom I\r\nknew in the dead days, and therefore, if I may, I still would save you\r\nfrom yourselves and your heads from the glowing pot.\r\n\r\n“Take counsel together now and say—Will you fight against Rezu, or will\r\nyou yield? If that is your desire, speak it, and by to-morrow’s sun I\r\nwill begone, taking these with me,” and she pointed to us, “whom I have\r\nsummoned to help us in the war. Aye, I will begone, and when you are\r\nstretched upon the stone of sacrifice, and your women and children are\r\nthe slaves of the men of Rezu, then shall you cry,\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, where is Hiya whom our fathers knew? Oh, will she not return and\r\nsave us from this hell?’\r\n\r\n“Yes, so shall you cry but there shall come no answer, since then she\r\nwill have departed to her own habitations in the moon and thence appear\r\nno more. Now consult together and answer swiftly, since I weary of you\r\nand your ways.”\r\n\r\nThe captains drew apart and began to talk in low voices, while Ayesha\r\nstood still, apparently quite unconcerned, and I considered the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to me that these people were almost in rebellion against\r\ntheir strange ruler, whose power over them was of a purely moral\r\nnature, one that emanated from her personality alone. What I wondered\r\nwas, being what she seemed to be, why she thought it worth while to\r\nexercise it at all. Then I remembered her statement that here and\r\nnowhere else she must abide for some secret reason, until a certain\r\nmystical gentleman with a Greek name came to fetch her away from this\r\nappointed _rendezvous_. Therefore I supposed she had no choice, or\r\nrather, suffering as she did from hallucinations, believed herself to\r\nhave no choice and was obliged to put up with a crowd of disagreeable\r\nsavages in quarters which were sadly out of repair.\r\n\r\nPresently the spokesman returned, saluted with his spear, and asked,\r\n\r\n“If we go up to fight against Rezu, who will lead us in the battle, O\r\nHiya?”\r\n\r\n“My wisdom shall be your guide,” she answered, “this white man shall be\r\nyour General and there stands the warrior who shall meet Rezu face to\r\nface and bring him to the dust,” and she pointed to Umslopogaas leaning\r\nupon his axe and watching them with a contemptuous smile.\r\n\r\nThis reply did not seem to please the man for he withdrew to consult\r\nagain with his companions. After a debate which I suppose was animated\r\nfor the Amahagger, men of few words who did not indulge in oratory, all\r\nof them advanced on us and the spokesman said,\r\n\r\n“The choice of a General does not please us, Hiya. We know that the\r\nwhite man is brave because of the fight he made against the men of Rezu\r\nover the mountain yonder; also that he and his followers have weapons\r\nthat deal death from afar. But there is a prophecy among us of which\r\nnone know the beginning, that he who commands in the last great battle\r\nbetween Lulala and Rezu must produce before the eyes of the People of\r\nLulala a certain holy thing, a charm of power, without which defeat\r\nwill be the portion of Lulala. Of this holy thing, this spirit-haunted\r\nshape of power, we know the likeness and the fashion, for these have\r\ncome down among our priests, though who told it to them we cannot tell,\r\nbut of it I will say this only, that it speaks both of the spirit and\r\nthe body, of man and yet of more than man.”\r\n\r\n“And if this wondrous charm, this talisman of might, cannot be shown by\r\nthe white lord here, what then?” asked Ayesha coldly.\r\n\r\n“Then, Hiya, this is the word of the People of Lulala, that we will not\r\nserve under him in the battle, and this also is their word that we will\r\nnot go up against Rezu. That thou art mighty we know well, Hiya, also\r\nthat thou canst slay if thou wilt, but we know also that Rezu is\r\nmightier and that against him thou hast no power. Therefore kill us if\r\nthou dost so desire, until thy heart is satisfied with death. For it is\r\nbetter that we should perish thus than upon the altar of sacrifice\r\nwearing the red-hot crowns of Rezu.”\r\n\r\n“So say we all,” exclaimed the rest of the company when he had\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n“The thought comes to me to begin to satisfy my heart with thy coward\r\nblood and that of thy companions,” said Ayesha contemptuously. Then she\r\npaused and turning to me, added, “O Watcher-by-Night, what counsel? Is\r\nthere aught that will convince these chicken-hearted ones over whom I\r\nhave spread my feathers for so long?”\r\n\r\nI shook my head blankly, whereat they murmured together and made as\r\nthough they would go.\r\n\r\nThen it was that Hans, who understood something of Arabic as he did of\r\nmost African tongues, pulled my sleeve and whispered in my ear.\r\n\r\n“The Great Medicine, Baas! Show them Zikali’s Great Medicine.”\r\n\r\nHere was an idea. The description of the article required, a\r\n“spirit-haunted shape of power” that spoke “both of the spirit and the\r\nbody of man and yet of more than man,” was so vague that it might mean\r\nanything or nothing. And yet——\r\n\r\nI turned to Ayesha and prayed her to ask them if what they wanted\r\nshould be produced, whether they would follow me bravely and fight Rezu\r\nto the death. She did so and with one voice they replied,\r\n\r\n“Aye, bravely and to the death, him and the Bearer of the Axe of whom\r\nalso our legend tells.”\r\n\r\nThen with deliberation I opened my shirt and holding out the image of\r\nZikali as far as the chain of elephant hair would allow, I asked,\r\n\r\n“Is this the holy thing, the charm of power, of which your legend\r\ntells, O People of the Amahagger and worshippers of Lulala?”\r\n\r\nThe spokesman glanced at it, then snatching a brand from a watch-fire\r\nthat burnt near by held it over the carving and stared, and stared\r\nagain; and as he did, so did the others bending over him.\r\n\r\n“Dog! would you singe my beard?” I cried in affected rage, and seizing\r\nthe brand from his hand I smote him with it over the head.\r\n\r\nBut he took no heed of the affront which I had offered to him merely to\r\nassert my authority. Still for a few moments he stared although the\r\nsparks from the wood were frizzling in his greasy hair, then of a\r\nsudden went down on his face before me, as did all the others and cried\r\nout,\r\n\r\n“It is the Holy Thing! It is the spirit-haunted Shape of Power itself,\r\nand we the Worshippers of Lulala will follow thee to the death, O white\r\nlord, Watcher-by-Night. Yes, where thou goest and he goes who bears the\r\nAxe, thither will we follow till not one of us is left upon his feet.”\r\n\r\n“Then that’s settled,” I said, yawning, since it is never wise to show\r\nconcern about anything before savages. Indeed personally I had no wish\r\nto be the leader of this very peculiar tribe in an adventure of which I\r\nknew nothing, and therefore had hoped that they would leave that honour\r\nto someone else. Then I turned and told Umslopogaas what had passed, a\r\ntale at which he only shrugged his great shoulders, handling his axe as\r\nthough he were minded to try its edge upon some of these “Dark-lovers,”\r\nas he named the Amahagger people because of their nocturnal habits.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ayesha gave certain orders. Then she came to me and said,\r\n\r\n“These men march at once, three thousand strong, and by dawn will camp\r\non the northern mountain crest. At sunrise litters will come to bear\r\nyou and those with you if they will, to join them, which you should do\r\nby midday. In the afternoon marshall them as you think wise, for the\r\nbattle will take place in the small hours of the following morning,\r\nsince the People of Lulala only fight at night. I have said.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not come with us?” I asked, dismayed.\r\n\r\n“Nay, not in a war against Rezu, why it matters not. Yet my Spirit will\r\ngo with you, for I shall watch all that passes, how it matters not and\r\nperchance you may see it there—I know not. On the third day from\r\nto-morrow we shall meet again in the flesh or beyond it, but as I think\r\nin the flesh, and you can claim the reward which you journeyed here to\r\nseek. A place shall be prepared for the white lady whom Rezu would have\r\nset up as a rival queen to me. Farewell, and farewell also to yonder\r\nBearer of the Axe that shall drink the blood of Rezu, also to the\r\nlittle yellow man who is rightly named Light-in-Darkness, as you shall\r\nlearn ere all is done.”\r\n\r\nThen before I could speak she turned and glided away, swiftly\r\nsurrounded by her guards, leaving me astonished and very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nALLAN’S VISION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old chamberlain, Billali, conducted us back to our camp. As we went\r\nhe discoursed to me of these Amahagger, of whom it seemed he was\r\nhimself a developed specimen, one who threw back, perhaps tens of\r\ngenerations, to some superior ancestor who lived before they became\r\ndebased. In substance he told me that they were a wild and lawless lot\r\nwho lived amongst ruins or in caves, or some of them in swamp\r\ndwellings, in small separate communities, each governed by its petty\r\nheadman who was generally a priest of their goddess Lulala.\r\n\r\nOriginally they and the people of Rezu were the same, in times when\r\nthey worshipped the sun and the moon jointly, but “thousands of years”\r\nago, as he expressed it, they had separated, the Rezuites having gone\r\nto dwell to the north of the Great Mountain, whence they continually\r\nthreatened the Lulalaites whom, had it not been for She-who-commands,\r\nthey would have destroyed long before. The Rezuites, it seemed, were\r\nhabitual cannibals, whereas the Lulalaite branch of the Amahagger only\r\npractised cannibalism occasionally when by a lucky chance they got hold\r\nof strangers. “Such as yourself, Watcher-by-Night, and your\r\ncompanions,” he added with meaning. If their crime were discovered,\r\nhowever, Hiya, She-who-commands, punished it by death.\r\n\r\nI asked if she exercised an active rule over these people. He answered\r\nthat she did not, as she lacked sufficient interest in them; only when\r\nshe was angry with individuals she would destroy some of them by “her\r\narts,” as she had power to do if she chose. Most of them indeed had\r\nnever seen her and only knew of her existence by rumour. To them she\r\nwas a spirit or a goddess who inhabited the ancient tombs that lay to\r\nthe south of the old city whither she had come because of the\r\nthreatened war with Rezu, whom alone she feared, he did not know why.\r\nHe told me again, moreover, that she was the greatest magician who had\r\never been, and that it was certain she did not die, since their\r\nforefathers knew her generations ago. Still she seemed to be under some\r\ncurse, like the Amahagger themselves, who were the descendants of those\r\nwho had once inhabited Kôr and the country round it, as far as the\r\nsea-coast and for hundreds of miles inland, having been a mighty people\r\nin their day before a great plague destroyed them.\r\n\r\nFor the rest he thought that she was a very unhappy woman who “lived\r\nwith her own soul mourning the dead” and consorting with none upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nI asked him why she stayed here, whereat he shook his head and replied,\r\nhe supposed because of the “curse,” since he could conceive of no other\r\nreason. He informed me also that her moods varied very much. Sometimes\r\nshe was fierce and active and at others by comparison mild and\r\nlow-spirited. Just now she was passing through one of the latter\r\nstages, perhaps because of the Rezu trouble, for she did not wish her\r\npeople to be destroyed by this terrible person; or perhaps for some\r\nother reason with which he was not acquainted.\r\n\r\nWhen she chose, she knew all things, except the distant future. Thus\r\nshe knew that we were coming, also the details of our march and that we\r\nshould be attacked by the Rezuites who were going out to meet their\r\nreturning company that had been sent afar to find a white queen.\r\nTherefore she had ordered him to go with soldiers to our assistance. I\r\nasked why she went veiled, and he replied, because of her beauty which\r\ndrove even savage men mad, so that in old days she had been obliged to\r\nkill a number of them.\r\n\r\nThat was all he seemed to know about her, except that she was kind to\r\nthose who served her well, like himself, and protected them from evil\r\nof every sort.\r\n\r\nThen I asked him about Rezu. He answered that he was a dreadful person,\r\nundying, it was said, like She-who-commands, though he had never seen\r\nthe man himself and never wanted to do so. His followers being\r\ncannibals and having literally eaten up all those that they could\r\nreach, were now desirous of conquering the people of Lulala that they\r\nmight eat them also at their leisure. Each other they did not eat,\r\nbecause dog does not eat dog, and therefore they were beginning to grow\r\nhungry, although they had plenty of grain and cattle of which they used\r\nthe milk and hides.\r\n\r\nAs for the coming battle, he knew nothing about it or what would\r\nhappen, save that She-who-commands said that it would go well for the\r\nLulalaites under my direction. She was so sure that it would go well,\r\nthat she did not think it worth while to accompany the army, for she\r\nhated noise and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that perhaps she was afraid that she too would be\r\ntaken captive and eaten, but I kept my reflection to myself.\r\n\r\nJust then we arrived at our camp-house, where Billali bade me farewell,\r\nsaying that he wished to rest as he must be back at dawn with litters,\r\nwhen he hoped to find us ready to start. Then he departed. Umslopogaas\r\nand Hans also went away to sleep, leaving me alone who, having taken my\r\nrepose in the afternoon, did not feel drowsy at the moment. So lovely\r\nwas the night indeed that I made up my mind to take a little walk\r\nduring the midnight hours, after the manner of the Amahagger\r\nthemselves, for having now been recognised as Generalissimo of their\r\nforces, I had little fear of being attacked, especially as I carried a\r\npistol in my pocket. So off I set strolling slowly down what seemed to\r\nhave been a main street of the ancient city, which in its general\r\nappearance resembled excavated Pompeii, only on an infinitely larger\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nAs I went I meditated on the strange circumstances in which I found\r\nmyself. Really they tempted me to believe that I was suffering from\r\ndelusions and perhaps all the while in fact lay stretched upon a bed in\r\nthe delirium of fever. That marvellous woman, for instance—even\r\nrejecting her tale of miraculously extended life, which I did—what was\r\nI to make of her? I did not know, except that wondrous as she was, it\r\nremained clear that she claimed a great deal more power than she\r\npossessed. This was evident from her tone in the interview with the\r\ncaptains, and from the fact that she had shuffled off the command of\r\nher tribe on to my shoulders. If she were so mighty, why did she not\r\ncommand it herself and bring her celestial, or infernal, powers to bear\r\nupon the enemy? Again, I could not say, but one fact emerged, namely\r\nthat she was as interesting as she was beautiful, and uncommonly clever\r\ninto the bargain.\r\n\r\nBut what a task was this that she had laid upon me, to lead into\r\nbattle, with a foe of unascertained strength, a mob of savages probably\r\nquite undisciplined, of whose fighting qualities I knew nothing and\r\nwhom I had no opportunity of organising. The affair seemed madness and\r\nI could only hope that luck or destiny would take me through somehow.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I believed it would, for I had grown almost as\r\nsuperstitious about Zikali and his Great Medicine as was Hans himself.\r\nCertainly the effect of it upon those captains was very odd, or would\r\nhave been had not the explanation come to me in a flash. On the first\r\nnight of our meeting, as I have described, I showed this talisman to\r\nAyesha, as a kind of letter of credentials, and now I could see that it\r\nwas she who had arranged all the scene with the captains, or their\r\ntribal magician, in order to get her way about my appointment to the\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nEverything about her conduct bore this out, even her feigning ignorance\r\nof the existence of the charm and the leaving of it to Hans to suggest\r\nits production, which perhaps she did by influencing his mind\r\nsubconsciously. No doubt more or less it fitted in with one of those\r\nnebulous traditions which are so common amongst ancient savage races,\r\nand therefore once shown to her confederate, or confederates, would be\r\naccepted by the common people as a holy sign, after which the rest was\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nSuch an obvious explanation involved the death of any illusions I might\r\nstill cherish about this Arab lady, Ayesha, and it is true that I\r\nparted with them with regret, as we all do when we think we have\r\ndiscovered something wonderful in the female line. But there it was,\r\nand to bother any more about her, her history and aims, seemed useless.\r\n\r\nSo dismissing her and all present anxieties from my mind, I began to\r\nlook about me and to wonder at the marvellous scene which unfolded\r\nitself before me in the moonlight. That I might see it better, although\r\nI was rather afraid of snakes which might hide among the stones, by an\r\neasy ascent I climbed a mount of ruins and up the broad slope of a\r\ntumbled massive wall, which from its thickness I judged must have been\r\nthat of some fort or temple. On the crest of this wall, some seventy or\r\neighty feet above the level of the streets, I sat down and looked about\r\nme.\r\n\r\nEverywhere around me stretched the ruins of the great city, now as\r\nfallen and as deserted as Babylon herself. The majestic loneliness of\r\nthe place was something awful. Even the vision of companies and\r\nbattalions of men crossing the plain towards the north with the\r\nmoonlight glistening on their spear-points, did little to lessen this\r\nsense of loneliness. I knew that these were the regiments which I was\r\ndestined to command, travelling to the camp where I must meet them. But\r\nin such silence did they move that no sound came from them even in the\r\ndeathly stillness of the perfect night, so that almost I was tempted to\r\nbelieve them to be the shadow-ghosts of some army of old Kôr.\r\n\r\nThey vanished, and musing thus I think I must have dozed. At any rate\r\nit seemed to me that of a sudden the city was as it had been in the\r\ndays of its glory. I saw it brilliant with a hundred colours;\r\neverywhere was colour, on the painted walls and roofs, the flowering\r\ntrees that lined the streets and the bright dresses of the men and\r\nwomen who by thousands crowded them and the marts and squares. Even the\r\nchariots that moved to and fro were coloured as were the countless\r\nbanners which floated from palace walls and temple tops.\r\n\r\nThe enormous place teemed with every activity of life; brides being\r\nborne to marriage and dead men to burial; squadrons marching, clad in\r\nglittering armour; merchants chaffering; white-robed priests and\r\npriestesses passing in procession (who or what did they worship? I\r\nwondered); children breaking out of school; grave philosophers debating\r\nin the shadow of a cool arcade; a royal person making a progress\r\npreceded by runners and surrounded by slaves, and lastly the multitudes\r\nof citizens going about the daily business of life.\r\n\r\nEven details were visible, such as those of officers of the law chasing\r\nan escaped prisoner who had a broken rope tied to his arm, and a\r\ncollision between two chariots in a narrow street, about the wrecks of\r\nwhich an idle mob gathered as it does to-day if two vehicles collide,\r\nwhile the owners argued, gesticulating angrily, and the police and\r\ngrooms tried to lift a fallen horse on to its feet. Only no sound of\r\nthe argument or of anything else reached me. I saw, and that was all.\r\nThe silence remained intense, as well it might do, since those chariots\r\nmust have come to grief thousands upon thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nA cloud seemed to pass before my eyes, a thin, gauzy cloud which\r\nsomehow reminded me of the veil that Ayesha wore. Indeed at the moment,\r\nalthough I could not see her, I would have sworn that she was present\r\nat my side, and what is more, that she was mocking me who had set her\r\ndown as so impotent a trickstress, which doubtless was part of the\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nAt any rate I returned to my normal state, and there about me were the\r\nmiles of desolate streets and the thousands of broken walls, and the\r\nblack blots of roofless houses and the wide, untenanted plain bounded\r\nby the battlemented line of encircling mountain crests, and above all,\r\nthe great moon shining softly in a tender sky.\r\n\r\nI looked and thrilled, though oppressed by the drear and desolate\r\nbeauty of the scene around me, descended the wall and the ruined slope\r\nand made my way homewards, afraid even of my own shadow. For I seemed\r\nto be the only living thing among the dead habitations of immemorial\r\nKôr.\r\n\r\nReaching our camp I found Hans awake and watching for me.\r\n\r\n“I was just coming to look for you, Baas,” he said. “Indeed I should\r\nhave done so before, only I knew that you had gone to pay a visit to\r\nthat tall white ‘Missis’ who ties up her head in a blanket, and thought\r\nthat neither of you would like to be disturbed.”\r\n\r\n“Then you thought wrong,” I answered, “and what is more, if you had\r\nmade that visit I think it might have been one from which you would\r\nnever have come back.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, Baas,” sniggered Hans. “The tall white lady would not have\r\nminded. It is you who are so particular, after the fashion of men whom\r\nHeaven made very shy.”\r\n\r\nWithout deigning to reply to the gibes of Hans I went to lie down,\r\nwondering what kind of a bed poor Robertson occupied that night, and\r\nsoon fell asleep, as fortunately for myself I have the power to do,\r\nwhatever my circumstances at the moment. Men who can sleep are those\r\nwho do the work of the world and succeed, though personally I have had\r\nmore of the work than of the success.\r\n\r\nI was awakened at the first grey dawn by Hans, who informed me that\r\nBillali was waiting outside with litters, also that Goroko had already\r\nmade his incantations and doctored Umslopogaas and his two men for war\r\nafter the Zulu fashion when battle was expected. He added that these\r\nZulus had refused to be left behind to guard and nurse their wounded\r\ncompanions, and said that rather than do so, they would kill them.\r\n\r\nSomehow, he informed me, in what way he could not guess, this had come\r\nto the ears of the White Lady who “hid her face from men because it was\r\nso ugly,” and she had sent women to attend to the sick ones, with word\r\nthat they should be well cared for. All of this proved to be true\r\nenough, but I need not enter into the details.\r\n\r\nIn the end off we went, I in my litter following Billali’s, with an\r\nexpress and a repeating rifle and plenty of ammunition for both, and\r\nHans, also well armed, in that which had been sent for Umslopogaas, who\r\npreferred to walk with Goroko and the two other Zulus.\r\n\r\nFor a little while Hans enjoyed the sensation of being carried by\r\nsomebody else, and lay upon the cushions smoking with a seraphic smile\r\nand addressing sarcastic remarks to the bearers, who fortunately did\r\nnot understand them. Soon, however, he wearied of these novel delights\r\nand as he was still determined not to walk until he was obliged,\r\nclimbed on to the roof of the litter, astride of which he sat as though\r\nit were a horse, looking for all the world like a toy monkey on a\r\nhorizontal stick.\r\n\r\nOur road ran across the level, fertile plain but a small portion of\r\nwhich was cultivated, though I could see that at some time or other,\r\nwhen its population was greater, every inch of it had been under crop.\r\nNow it was largely covered by trees, many of them fruit-bearing,\r\nbetween which meandered streams of water which once, I think, had been\r\nirrigation channels.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o’clock we reached the foot of the encircling cliffs and\r\nbegan the climb of the escarpment, which was steep, tortuous and\r\ndifficult. By noon we reached its crest and here found all our little\r\narmy encamped and, except for the sentries, sleeping, as seemed to be\r\nthe invariable custom of these people in the daytime.\r\n\r\nI caused the chief captains to be awakened and with them made a circuit\r\nof the camp, reckoning the numbers of the men which came to about 3,250\r\nand learning what I could concerning them and their way of fighting.\r\nThen, accompanied by Umslopogaas and Hans with the Zulus as a guard,\r\nalso by three of the head-captains of the Amahagger, I walked forward\r\nto study the lie of the land.\r\n\r\nComing to the further edge of the escarpment, I found that at this\r\nplace two broad-based ridges, shaped like those that spring from the\r\nboles of certain tropical forest trees, ran from its crest to the plain\r\nbeneath at a gentle slope. Moreover I saw that on this plain between\r\nthe ends of the ridges an army was encamped which, by the aid of my\r\nglasses, I examined and estimated to number at least ten thousand men.\r\n\r\nThis army, the Amahagger captains informed me, was that of Rezu, who,\r\nthey said, intended to commence his attack at dawn on the following\r\nmorning, since the People of Rezu, being sun-worshippers, would never\r\nfight until their god appeared above the horizon. Having studied all\r\nthere was to see I asked the captains to set out their plan of battle,\r\nif they had a plan.\r\n\r\nThe chief of them answered that it was to advance halfway down the\r\nright-hand ridge to a spot where there was a narrow flat piece of\r\nground, and there await attack, since at this place their smaller\r\nnumbers would not so much matter, whereas these made it impossible for\r\nthem to assail the enemy.\r\n\r\n“But suppose that Rezu should choose to come up to the other ridge and\r\nget behind you. What would happen then?” I inquired.\r\n\r\nHe replied that he did not know, his ideas of strategy being, it was\r\nclear, of a primitive order.\r\n\r\n“Do your people fight best at night or in the day?” I went on.\r\n\r\nHe said undoubtedly at night, indeed in all their history there was no\r\nrecord of their having done so in the daytime.\r\n\r\n“And yet you propose to let Rezu join battle with you when the sun is\r\nhigh, or in other words to court defeat,” I remarked.\r\n\r\nThen I went aside and discussed things for a while with Umslopogaas and\r\nHans, after which I returned and gave my orders, declining all\r\nargument. Briefly these were that in the dusk before the rising of the\r\nmoon, our Amahagger must advance down the right-hand ridge in complete\r\nsilence, and hide themselves among the scrub which I saw grew thickly\r\nnear its root. A small party, however, under the leadership of Goroko,\r\nwhom I knew to be a brave and clever captain, was to pass halfway down\r\nthe left-hand ridge and there light fires over a wide area, so as to\r\nmake the enemy think that our whole force had encamped there. Then at\r\nthe proper moment which I had not yet decided upon, we would attack the\r\narmy of Rezu.\r\n\r\nThe Amahagger captains did not seem pleased with this plan which I\r\nthink was too bold for their fancy, and began to murmur together.\r\nSeeing that I must assert my authority at once, I walked up to them and\r\nsaid to their chief man,\r\n\r\n“Hearken, my friend. By your own wish, not mine, I have been appointed\r\nyour general and I expect to be obeyed without question. From the\r\nmoment that the advance begins you will keep close to me and to the\r\nBlack One, and if so much as one of your men hesitates or turns back,\r\nyou will die,” and I nodded towards the axe of Umslopogaas. “Moreover,\r\nafterwards She-who-commands will see that others of you die, should you\r\nescape in the fight.”\r\n\r\nStill they hesitated. Thereon without another word, I produced Zikali’s\r\nGreat Medicine and held it before their eyes, with the result that the\r\nsight of this ugly thing did what even the threat of death could not\r\ndo. They went flat on the ground, every one of them, and swore by\r\nLulala and by She-who-commands, her priestess, that they would do all I\r\nsaid, however mad it seemed to them.\r\n\r\n“Good,” I answered. “Now go back and make ready, and for the rest, by\r\nthis time to-morrow we shall know who is or is not mad.”\r\n\r\nFrom that moment till the end I had no more trouble with these\r\nAmahagger.\r\n\r\nI will get on quickly with the story of this fight whereof the\r\npreliminary details do not matter. At the proper time Goroko went off\r\nwith two hundred and fifty men and one of the two Zulus to light the\r\nfires and, at an agreed signal, namely the firing of two shots in rapid\r\nsuccession by myself, to begin shouting and generally make as much\r\nnoise as they could.\r\n\r\nWe also went off with the remaining three thousand, and before the moon\r\nrose, crept as quietly as ghosts down the right-hand ridge. Being such\r\na silent folk who were accustomed to move at night and could see in the\r\ndark almost as well as cats, the Amahagger executed this manoeuvre\r\nsplendidly, wrapping their spear-blades in bands of dry grass lest\r\nlight should glint on them and betray our movements. So in due course\r\nwe came to the patch of bush where the ridge widened out about five\r\nhundred yards from the plain beneath, and there lay down in four\r\ncompanies or regiments, each of them about seven hundred and fifty\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nNow the moon had risen, but because of the mist which covered the\r\nsurface of the plain, we could see nothing of the camp of Rezu which we\r\nknew must be within a thousand yards of us, unless indeed it had been\r\nmoved, as the silence seemed to suggest.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance gave me much anxiety, since I feared lest abandoning\r\ntheir reputed habits, these Rezuites were also contemplating a night\r\nattack. Umslopogaas, too, was disturbed on the subject, though because\r\nof Goroko and his men whose fires began to twinkle on the opposing\r\nridge something over a mile away, they could not pass up there without\r\nour knowledge.\r\n\r\nStill, for aught I knew there might be other ways of scaling this\r\nmountain. I did not trust the Amahagger, who declared that none\r\nexisted, since their local knowledge was slight as they never visited\r\nthese northern slopes because of their fear of Rezu. Supposing that the\r\nenemy gained the crest and suddenly assaulted us in the rear! The\r\nthought of it made me feel cold down the back.\r\n\r\nWhile I was wondering how I could find out the truth, Hans, who was\r\nsquatted behind a bush, suddenly rose and gave the rifle he was\r\ncarrying to the remaining Zulu.\r\n\r\n“Baas,” he said, “I am going to look and find out what those people are\r\ndoing, if they are still there, and then you will know how and when to\r\nattack them. Don’t be afraid for me, Baas, it will be easy in that mist\r\nand you know I can move like a snake. Also if I should not come back,\r\nit does not matter and it will tell you that they _are_ there.”\r\n\r\nI hesitated who did not wish to expose the brave little Hottentot to\r\nsuch risks. But when he understood, Umslopogaas said,\r\n\r\n“Let the man go. It is his gift and duty to spy, as it is mine to smite\r\nwith the axe, and yours to lead, Macumazahn. Let him go, I say.”\r\n\r\nI nodded my head, and having kissed my hand in his silly fashion in\r\ntoken of much that he did not wish to say, Hans slipped out of sight,\r\nsaying that he hoped to be back within an hour. Except for his great\r\nknife, he went unarmed, who feared that if he took a pistol he might be\r\ntempted to fire it and make a noise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nTHE MIDNIGHT BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat hour went by very slowly. Again and again I consulted my watch by\r\nthe light of the moon, which was now rising high in the heavens, and\r\nthought that it would never come to an end. Listen as I would, there\r\nwas nothing to be heard, and as the mist still prevailed the only thing\r\nI could see except the heavens, was the twinkling of the fires lit by\r\nGoroko and his party.\r\n\r\nAt length it was done and there was no sign of Hans. Another half hour\r\npassed and still no sign of Hans.\r\n\r\n“I think that Light-in-Darkness is dead or taken prisoner,” said\r\nUmslopogaas.\r\n\r\nI answered that I feared so, but that I would give him another fifteen\r\nminutes and then, if he did not appear, I proposed to order an advance,\r\nhoping to find the enemy where we had last seen them from the top of\r\nthe mountain.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen minutes went by also, and as I could see that the Amahagger\r\ncaptains who sat at a little distance were getting very nervous, I\r\npicked up my double-barrelled rifle and turned round so that I faced up\r\nhill with a view of firing it as had been agreed with Goroko, but in\r\nsuch a fashion that the flashes perhaps would not be seen from the\r\nplain below. For this purpose I moved a few yards to the left to get\r\nbehind the trunk of a tree that grew there, and was already lifting the\r\nrifle to my shoulder, when a yellow hand clasped the barrel and a husky\r\nvoice said,\r\n\r\n“Don’t fire yet, Baas, as I want to tell you my story first.”\r\n\r\nI looked down and there was the ugly face of Hans wearing a grin that\r\nmight have frightened the man in the moon.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said with cold indifference, assumed I admit to hide my\r\nexcessive joy at his safe return, “tell on, and be quick about it. I\r\nsuppose you lost your way and never found them.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, I lost my way for the fog was very thick down there. But in\r\nthe end I found them all right, by my nose, Baas, for those man-eating\r\npeople smell strong and I got the wind of one of their sentries. It was\r\neasy to pass him in the mist, Baas, so easy that I was tempted to cut\r\nhis throat as I went, but I didn’t for fear lest he should make a\r\nnoise. No, I walked on right into the middle of them, which was easy\r\ntoo, for they were all asleep, wrapped up in blankets. They hadn’t any\r\nfires perhaps because they didn’t want them to be seen, or perhaps\r\nbecause it is so hot down in that low land, I don’t know which.\r\n\r\n“So I crept on taking note of all I saw, till at last I came to a\r\nlittle hill of which the top rose above the level of the mist, so that\r\nI could see on it a long hut built of green boughs with the leaves\r\nstill fresh upon them. Now I thought that I would crawl up to the hut\r\nsince it came into my mind that Rezu himself must be sleeping there and\r\nthat I might kill him. But while I stood hesitating I heard a noise\r\nlike to that made by an old woman whose husband had thrown a blanket\r\nover her head to keep her quiet, or to that of a bee in a bottle, a\r\nsort of droning noise that reminded me of something.\r\n\r\n“I thought a while and remembered that when Red Beard was on his knees\r\npraying to Heaven, as is his habit when he has nothing else to do,\r\nBaas, he makes a noise just like that. I crept towards the sound and\r\npresently there I found Red Beard himself tied upon a stone and looking\r\nas mad as a buffalo bull stuck in a swamp, for he shook his head and\r\nrolled his eyes about, just as though he had had two bottles of bad\r\ngin, Baas, and all the while he kept saying prayers. Now I thought that\r\nI would cut him loose, and bent over him to do so, when by ill-luck he\r\nsaw my face and began to shout, saying,\r\n\r\n“‘Go away, you yellow devil. I know you have come to take me to hell,\r\nbut you are too soon, and if my hands were loose I would twist your\r\nhead off your shoulders.’\r\n\r\n“He said this in English, Baas, which as you know I can understand\r\nquite well, after which I was sure that I had better leave him alone.\r\nWhilst I was thinking, there came out of the hut above two old men\r\ndressed in night-shirts, such as you white people wear, with yellow\r\nthings upon their heads that had a metal picture of the sun in front of\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Medicine-men,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, or Predikants of some sort, for they were rather like your\r\nreverend father when he dressed himself up and went into a box to\r\npreach. Seeing them I slipped back a little way to where the mist\r\nbegan, lay down and listened. They looked at Red Beard, for his shouts\r\nat me had brought them out, but he took no notice of them, only went on\r\nmaking a noise like a beetle in a tin can.\r\n\r\n“‘It is nothing,’ said one of the Predikants to the other in the same\r\ntongue that these Amahagger use. ‘But when is he to be sacrificed?\r\nSoon, I hope, for I cannot sleep because of the noise he makes.’\r\n\r\n“‘When the edge of the sun appears, not before,’ answered the other\r\nPredikant. ‘Then the new queen will be brought out of the hut and this\r\nwhite man will be sacrificed to her.’\r\n\r\n“‘I think it is a pity to wait so long,’ said the first Predikant, ‘for\r\nnever shall we sleep in peace until the red-hot pot is on his head.’\r\n\r\n“‘First the victory, then the feast,’ answered the second Predikant,\r\n‘though he will not be so good to eat as that fat young woman who was\r\nwith the new queen.’\r\n\r\n“Then, Baas, they both smacked their lips and one of them went back\r\ntowards the hut. But the other did not go back. No, he sat down on the\r\nground and glowered at Baas Red-Beard upon the stone. More, he struck\r\nhim on the face to make him quiet.\r\n\r\n“Now, Baas, when I saw this and remembered that they had said that they\r\nhad eaten Janee whom I liked although she was such a fool, the spirit\r\nin me grew so very angry and I thought that I would give this old\r\n_skellum_ (i.e. rascal) of a Predikant a taste of sacrifice himself,\r\nafter which I purposed to creep to the hut and see if I could get\r\nspeech with the Lady Sad-Eyes, if she was there.\r\n\r\n“So I wriggled up behind the Predikant as he sat glowering over\r\nRed-Beard, and stuck my knife into his back where I thought it would\r\nkill him at once. But it didn’t, Baas, for he fell on to his face and\r\nbegan to make a noise like a wounded hyena before I could finish him.\r\nThen I heard a sound of shouts, and to save my life was obliged to run\r\naway into the mist, without loosing Red-Beard or seeing Lady Sad-Eyes.\r\nI ran very hard, Baas, making a wide circle to the left, and so at last\r\ngot back here. That’s all, Baas.”\r\n\r\n“And quite enough, too,” I answered, “though if they did not see you,\r\nthe death of the Medicine-man may frighten them. Poor Janee! Well, I\r\nhope to come even with those devils before they are three hours older.”\r\n\r\nThen I called up Umslopogaas and the Amahagger captains and told them\r\nthe substance of the story, also that Hans had located the army, or\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that we made up our minds to attack at once; indeed I\r\ninsisted on this, as I was determined if I could to save that\r\nunfortunate man, Robertson, who, from Hans’ account, evidently was now\r\nquite mad and raving. So I fired the two shots as had been arranged and\r\npresently heard the sound of distant shoutings on the slope of the\r\nopposing ridge. A few minutes later we started, Umslopogaas and I\r\nleading the vanguard and the Amahagger captains following with the\r\nthree remaining companies.\r\n\r\nNow the reader, presuming the existence of such a person, will think\r\nthat everything is sure to go right; that this cunning old fellow,\r\nAllan Quatermain, is going to surprise and wipe the floor with those\r\nRezuites, who were already beguiled by the trick he had instructed\r\nGoroko to play. That after this he will rescue Robertson who doubtless\r\nshortly recovers his mind, also Inez with the greatest ease, in fact\r\nthat everything will happen as it ought to do if this were a romance\r\ninstead of a mere record of remarkable facts. But being the latter, as\r\nit happened, matters did not work out quite in this convenient way.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, when those Amahagger told me that the Rezuites never\r\nfought in the dark or before the sun was well up, either they lied or\r\nthey were much mistaken, for at any rate on this occasion they did the\r\nexact contrary. All the while that we thought we were stalking them,\r\nthey were stalking us. The Goroko manoeuvre had not deceived them in\r\nthe least, since from their spies they knew its exact significance.\r\n\r\nHere, I may add that those spies were in our own ranks, traitors, in\r\nshort, who were really in the pay of Rezu and possibly belonged to his\r\nabominable faith, some of whom slipped away from time to time to the\r\nenemy to report our progress and plans, so far as they knew them.\r\n\r\nFurther, what Hans had stumbled on was a mere rear guard left around\r\nthe place of sacrifice and the hut where Inez was confined. The real\r\narmy he never found at all. That was divided into two bodies and hidden\r\nin bush to the right and left of the ridge which we were descending\r\njust at the spot where it joined the plain beneath, and into the jaws\r\nof these two armies we marched gaily.\r\n\r\nNow that hypothetical reader will say, “Why didn’t that silly old fool,\r\nAllan, think of all these things? Why didn’t he remember that he was\r\ncommanding a pack of savages with whom he had no real acquaintance,\r\namong whom there were sure to be traitors, especially as they were of\r\nthe same blood as the Rezuites, and take precautions?”\r\n\r\nAh! my dear reader, I will only answer that I wish you had handled the\r\njob yourself, and enjoyed the opportunity of seeing what _you_ could do\r\nin the circumstances. Do you suppose I didn’t think of all these\r\npoints? Of course I did. But have you ever heard of the difficulty of\r\nmaking silk purses out of sows’ ears, or of turning a lot of gloomy and\r\ndisagreeable barbarians whom you had never even drilled, into\r\ntrustworthy and efficient soldiers ready to fight three times their own\r\nnumber and beat them?\r\n\r\nAlso I beg to observe that I did get through somehow, as you shall\r\nlearn, which is more than you might have done, Mr. Wisdom, though I\r\nadmit, not without help from another quarter. It is all very well for\r\nyou to sit in your armchair and be sapient and turn up your learned\r\nnose, like the gentlemen who criticise plays and poems, an easy job\r\ncompared to the writing of them. From all of which, however, you will\r\nunderstand that I am, to tell the truth, rather ashamed of what\r\nfollowed, since _qui s’excuse, s’accuse_.\r\n\r\nAs we slunk down that hill in the moonlight, a queer-looking crowd, I\r\nadmit also that I felt very uncomfortable. To begin with I did not like\r\nthat remark of the Medicine-man which Hans reported, to the effect that\r\nthe feast must come after the victory, especially as he had said just\r\nbefore that Robertson was to be sacrificed as the sun rose, which would\r\nseem to suggest that the “victory” was planned to take place before\r\nthat event.\r\n\r\nWhile I was ruminating upon this subject, I looked round for Hans to\r\ncross-examine him as to the priest’s exact words, only to find that he\r\nhad slunk off somewhere. A few minutes later he reappeared running back\r\ntowards us swiftly and, I noticed, taking shelter behind tree trunks\r\nand rocks as he came.\r\n\r\n“Baas,” he gasped, for he was out of breath, “be careful, those Rezu\r\nmen are on either side ahead. I went forward and ran into them. They\r\nthrew many spears at me. Look!” and he showed a slight cut on his arm\r\nfrom which blood was flowing.\r\n\r\nInstantly I understood that we were ambushed and began to think very\r\nhard indeed. As it chanced we were passing across a large flat space\r\nupon the ridge, say seven or eight acres in extent, where the bush grew\r\nlightly, though owing to the soil being better, the trees were tall.\r\n\r\nOn the steep slope below this little plain it seemed to be denser and\r\nthere it was, according to Hans, that the ambush was set. I halted my\r\nregiment and sent back messengers to the others that they were to halt\r\nalso as they came up, on the pretext of giving them a rest before they\r\nwere marshalled and we advanced to the battle.\r\n\r\nThen I told Umslopogaas what Hans said and asked him to send out his\r\nZulu soldier whom he could trust, to see if he could obtain\r\nconfirmation of the report. This he did at once. Also I asked him what\r\nhe thought should be done, supposing that it was true.\r\n\r\n“Form the Amahagger into a ring or a square and await attack,” he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nI nodded, for that was my own opinion, but replied,\r\n\r\n“If they were Zulus, the plan would be good. But how do we know that\r\nthese men will stand?”\r\n\r\n“We know nothing, Macumazahn, and therefore can only try. If they run\r\nit must be up-hill.”\r\n\r\nThen I called the captains and told them what was toward, which seemed\r\nto alarm them very much. Indeed one or two of them wanted to retreat at\r\nonce, but I said I would shoot the first man who tried to do so. In the\r\nend they agreed to my plan and said that they would post their best\r\nsoldiers above, at the top of the square, with the orders to stop any\r\nattempt at a flight up the mountain.\r\n\r\nAfter this we formed up the square as best we could, arranging it in a\r\nrather rough, four-fold line. While we were doing this we heard some\r\nshouts below and presently the Zulu returned, who reported that all was\r\nas Hans had said and that Rezu’s men were moving round us, having\r\ndiscovered, as he thought, that we had halted and escaped their ambush.\r\n\r\nStill the attack did not develop at once, for the reason that the Rezu\r\narmy was crawling up the steep flanks of the spur on either side of the\r\nlevel piece of ground, with a view of encircling us altogether, so as\r\nto make a clean sweep of our force. As a matter of fact, considered\r\nfrom our point of view, this was a most fortunate move, since thereby\r\nthey stopped any attempt at a retreat on the part of our Amahagger,\r\nwhose bolt-hole was now blocked.\r\n\r\nWhen we had done all we could, we sat down, or at least I did, and\r\nwaited. The night, I remember, was strangely still, only from the\r\nslopes on either side of our plateau came a kind of rustling sound\r\nwhich in fact was caused by the feet of Rezu’s people, as they marched\r\nto surround us.\r\n\r\nIt ceased at last and the silence grew complete, so much so that I\r\ncould hear the teeth of some of our tall Amahagger chattering with\r\nfear, a sound that gave me little confidence and caused Umslopogaas to\r\nremark that the hearts of these big men had never grown; they remained\r\n“as those of babies.” I told the captains to pass the word down the\r\nranks that those who stood might live, but those who fled would\r\ncertainly die. Therefore if they wished to see their homes again they\r\nhad better stand and fight like men. Otherwise most of them would be\r\nkilled and the rest eaten by Rezu. This was done, and I observed that\r\nthe message seemed to produce a steadying effect upon our ranks.\r\n\r\nSuddenly all around us, from below, from above and on either side there\r\nbroke a most awful roar which seemed to shape itself into the word,\r\n_Rezu_, and next minute also from above, below and either side, some\r\nten thousand men poured forth upon our square.\r\n\r\nIn the moonlight they looked very terrible with their flowing white\r\nrobes and great gleaming spears. Hans and I fired some shots, though\r\nfor all the effect they produced, we might as well have pelted a\r\nbreaker with pebbles. Then, as I thought that I should be more useful\r\nalive than dead, I retreated within the square, Umslopogaas, his Zulu,\r\nand Hans coming with me.\r\n\r\nOn the whole our Amahagger stood the attack better than I expected.\r\nThey beat back the first rush with considerable loss to the enemy, also\r\nthe second after a longer struggle. Then there was a pause during which\r\nwe re-formed our ranks, dragging the wounded men into the square.\r\n\r\nScarcely had we done this when with another mighty shout of “Rezu!” the\r\nenemy attacked again—that was about an hour after the battle had begun.\r\nBut now they had changed their tactics, for instead of trying to rush\r\nall sides of the square at once, they concentrated their efforts on the\r\nwestern front, that which faced towards the plain below.\r\n\r\nOn they came, and among them in the forefront of the battle, now and\r\nagain I caught sight of a gigantic man, a huge creature who seemed to\r\nme to be seven feet high and big in proportion. I could not see him\r\nclearly because of the uncertain moonlight, but I noted his fierce\r\naspect, also that he had an enormous beard, black streaked with grey,\r\nthat flowed down to his middle, and that his hair hung in masses upon\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Rezu himself!” I shouted to Umslopogaas.\r\n\r\n“Aye, Macumazahn, Rezu himself without doubt, and I rejoice to see him\r\nfor he will be a worthy foe to fight. Look! he carries an axe as I do.\r\nNow I must save my strength for when we come face to face I shall need\r\nit all.”\r\n\r\nI thought that I would spare Umslopogaas this exertion and watched my\r\nopportunity to put a bullet through this giant. But I could never get\r\none. Once when I had covered him an Amahagger rushed in front of my gun\r\nso that I could not shoot, and when a second chance came a little cloud\r\nfloated over the face of the moon and made him invisible. After that I\r\nhad other things to which to attend, since, as I expected would happen,\r\nthe western face of our square gave, and yelling like devils, the enemy\r\nbegan to pour in through the gap.\r\n\r\nA cold thrill went through me for I saw that the game was up. To\r\nre-form these undisciplined Amahagger was impossible; nothing was to be\r\nexpected except panic, rout and slaughter. I cursed my folly for ever\r\nhaving had anything to do with the business, while Hans screamed to me\r\nin a thin voice that the only chance was for us three and the Zulu to\r\nbolt and hide in the bush.\r\n\r\nI did not answer him because, apart from any nasty pride, the thing was\r\nimpossible, for how could we get through those struggling masses of men\r\nwhich surrounded us on every side? No, my clock had struck, so I went\r\non making a kind of mental sandwich of prayers and curses; prayers for\r\nmy soul and forgiveness for my sins, and curses on the Amahagger and\r\neverything to do with them, especially Zikali and the woman called\r\nAyesha, who, between them, had led me into this affair.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the Great Medicine of Zikali,” piped Hans again as he fired a\r\nrifle at the advancing foe.\r\n\r\n“Hang the Great Medicine,” I shouted back, “and Ayesha with it. No\r\nwonder she declined to take a hand in this business.”\r\n\r\nAs I spoke the words I saw old Billali, who not being a man of war was\r\nkeeping as close to us as he could, go flat onto his venerable face,\r\nand reflected that he must have got a thrown spear through him. Casting\r\na hurried glance at him to see if he were done for or only wounded, out\r\nof the corner of my eye I caught sight of something diaphanous which\r\ngleamed in the moonlight and reminded me of I knew not what at the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nI looked round quickly to see what it might be and lo! there, almost at\r\nmy side was the veiled Ayesha herself, holding in her hand a little rod\r\nmade of black wood inlaid with ivory not unlike a field marshal’s\r\nbaton, or a sceptre.\r\n\r\nI never saw her come and to this day I do not know how she did so; she\r\nwas just there and what is more she must have put luminous paint or\r\nsomething else on her robes, for they gleamed with a sort of faint,\r\nphosphorescent fire, which in the moonlight made her conspicuous all\r\nover the field of battle. Nor did she speak a single word, she only\r\nwaved the rod, pointed with it towards the fierce hordes who were\r\ndrawing near to us, killing as they came, and began to move forward\r\nwith a gliding motion.\r\n\r\nNow from every side there went up a roar of “_She-who-commands!\r\nShe-who-commands!_” while the people of Rezu in front shouted “_Lulala!\r\nLulala!_ Fly, Lulala is upon us with the witchcrafts of the moon!”\r\n\r\nShe moved forward and by some strange impulse, for no order was given,\r\nwe all began to move after her. Yes, the ranks that a minute before\r\nwere beginning to give way to wild panic, became filled with a\r\nmarvellous courage and moved after her.\r\n\r\nThe men of Rezu also, and I suppose with them Rezu himself, for I saw\r\nno more of him at that time, began to move uncommonly fast over the\r\nedge of the plateau towards the plain beneath. In fact they broke into\r\nflight and leaping over dead and dying, we rushed after them, always\r\nfollowing the gleaming robe of Ayesha, who must have been an extremely\r\nagile person, since without any apparent exertion she held her place a\r\nfew steps ahead of us.\r\n\r\nThere was another curious circumstance about this affair, namely, that\r\nterrified though they were, those Rezuites, after the first break, soon\r\nseemed to find it impossible to depart with speed. They kept turning\r\nround to look behind them at that following vision, as though they were\r\nso many of Lot’s wives. Moreover, the same fate overtook many of them\r\nwhich fell upon that scriptural lady, since they appeared to become\r\npetrified and stood there quite still, like rabbits fascinated by a\r\nsnake, until our people came up and killed them.\r\n\r\nThis slaying went on all down the last steep slope of the ridge, on\r\nwhich I suppose at least two-thirds of the army of Rezu must have\r\nperished, since our Amahagger showed themselves very handy men when it\r\ncame to exterminating foes who were too terror-struck to fight, and,\r\nexhilarated by the occupation, gained courage every moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nTHE SLAYING OF REZU\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last we were on the plain, the bemused remnant of Rezu’s army still\r\ndoubling before us like a mob of game pursued by wild dogs. Here we\r\nhalted to re-form our ranks; it seemed to me, although still she spoke\r\nno word, that some order reached me from the gleaming Ayesha that I\r\nshould do this. The business took twenty minutes or so, and then,\r\nnumbering about two thousand five hundred strong, for the rest had\r\nfallen in the fight of the square, we advanced again.\r\n\r\nNow there came that dusk which often precedes the rising of the sun,\r\nand through it I could see that the battle was not yet over, since\r\ngathered in front of us was still a force about equal to our own.\r\nAyesha pointed towards it with her wand and we leapt forward to the\r\nattack. Here the men of Rezu stood awaiting us, for they seemed to\r\novercome their terror with the approach of day.\r\n\r\nThe battle was fierce, a very strange battle in that dim, uncertain\r\nlight, which scarcely showed us friend from foe. Indeed I am not sure\r\nthat we should have won it, since Ayesha was no longer visible to give\r\nour Amahagger confidence, and as the courage of the Rezuites increased,\r\nso theirs seemed to lessen with the passing of the night.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, just as the issue hung doubtful, there was a\r\nshout to our left and looking, I made out the tall shape of Goroko, the\r\nwitch-doctor, with the other Zulu, followed by his two hundred and\r\nfifty men, and leaping on to the flank of the line of Rezu.\r\n\r\nThat settled the business. The enemy crumpled up and melted, and just\r\nthen the first lights of dawn appeared in the sky. I looked about me\r\nfor Ayesha, but she had gone, where to I knew not, though at the moment\r\nI feared that she must have been killed in the mêlée.\r\n\r\nThen I gave up looking and thinking, since now or never was the time\r\nfor action. Signalling and shouting to those hatchet-faced Amahagger to\r\nadvance, accompanied by Umslopogaas with Goroko who had joined us, and\r\nHans, I sprang forward to give them an example, which, to be just to\r\nthem, they took.\r\n\r\n“This is the mound on which Red-Beard should be,” cried Hans as we\r\nfaced a little slope.\r\n\r\nI ran up it and through the gloom which precedes the actual dawn, saw a\r\ngroup of men gathered round something, as people collect about a street\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n“Red-Beard on the stone. They are killing him,” screeched Hans again.\r\n\r\nIt was so; at least several white-robed priests were bending over a\r\nprostrate figure with knives in their hands, while behind stood the\r\nhuge fellow whom I took to be Rezu, staring towards the east as though\r\nhe were waiting for the rim of the sun to appear before he gave some\r\norder. At that very moment it did appear, just a thin edge of bright\r\nlight on the horizon, and he turned, shouting the order.\r\n\r\nToo late! For we were on them. Umslopogaas cut down one of the priests\r\nwith his axe, and the men about me dealt with the others, while Hans\r\nwith a couple of sweeps of his long knife, severed the cords with which\r\nRobertson was tied.\r\n\r\nThe poor man who in the growing light I could see was raving mad,\r\nsprang up, calling out something in Scotch about “the deil.” Seizing a\r\ngreat spear which had fallen from the hand of one of the priests, he\r\nrushed furiously at the giant who had given the order, and with a yell\r\ndrove it at his heart. I saw the spear snap, from which I concluded\r\nthat this man, whom rightly I took to be Rezu, wore some kind of\r\narmour.\r\n\r\nNext instant the axe he held, a great weapon, flashed aloft and down\r\nwent Robertson before its awful stroke, stone dead, for as we found out\r\nafterwards, he was cloven almost in two. At the sight of the death of\r\nmy poor friend rage took hold of me. In my hand was a double-barrelled\r\nrifle, an Express loaded with hollow-pointed bullets. I covered the\r\ngiant and let drive, first with one barrel and then with the other, and\r\nwhat is more, distinctly I heard both bullets strike upon him.\r\n\r\nYet he did not fall. He rocked a little, that is all, then turned and\r\nmarched off towards a hut, that whereof Hans had told me, which stood\r\nabout fifty yards away.\r\n\r\n“Leave him to me,” shouted Umslopogaas. “Steel cuts where bullets\r\ncannot pierce,” and with a bound like to that of a buck, the great Zulu\r\nleapt away after him.\r\n\r\nI think that Rezu meant to enter the hut for some purpose of his own,\r\nbut Umslopogaas was too hard upon his tracks. At any rate he ran past\r\nit and down the other slope of the little hill on to the plain behind\r\nwhere the remnants of his army were trying to re-form. There in front\r\nof them the giant turned and stood at bay.\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas halted also, waiting for us to come up, since, cunning old\r\nwarrior as he was, he feared lest should he begin the fight before that\r\nhappened, the horde of them would fall on him. Thirty seconds later we\r\narrived and found him standing still with bent body, small shield\r\nadvanced and the great axe raised as though in the act of striking, a\r\nwondrous picture outlined as it was against the swiftly rising-sun.\r\n\r\nSome ten paces away stood the giant leaning on the axe he bore, which\r\nwas not unlike to that with which woodmen fell big trees. He was an\r\nevil man to see and at this, my first full sight of him, I likened him\r\nin my mind to Goliath whom David overthrew. Huge he was and hairy, with\r\ndeep-set, piercing eyes and a great hooked nose. His face seemed thin\r\nand ancient also, when with a motion of the great head, he tossed his\r\nlong locks back from about it, but his limbs were those of a Hercules\r\nand his movements full of a youthful vigour. Moreover his aspect as a\r\nwhole was that of a devil rather than of a man; indeed the sight of it\r\nsickened me.\r\n\r\n“Let me shoot him,” I cried to Umslopogaas, for I had reloaded the\r\nrifle as I ran.\r\n\r\n“Nay, Watcher-by-Night,” answered the Zulu without moving his head,\r\n“rifle has had its chance and failed. Now let us see what axe can do.\r\nIf I cannot kill this man, I will be borne hence feet first who shall\r\nhave made a long journey for nothing.”\r\n\r\nThen the giant began to talk in a low, rumbling voice that reverberated\r\nfrom the slope of the little hill behind us.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked, speaking in the same tongue that the Amahagger\r\nuse, “who dare to come face to face with Rezu? Black hound, do you not\r\nknow that I cannot be slain who have lived a year for every week of\r\nyour life’s days, and set my foot upon the necks of men by thousands.\r\nHave you not seen the spear shatter and the iron balls melt upon my\r\nbreast like rain-drops, and would you try to bring me down with that\r\ntoy you carry? My army is defeated—I know it. But what matters that\r\nwhen I can get me more? Because the sacrifice was not completed and the\r\nwhite queen was not wed, therefore my army was defeated by the magic of\r\nLulala, the White Witch who dwells in the tombs. But _I_ am not\r\ndefeated who cannot be slain until I show my back, and then only by a\r\ncertain axe which long ago has rusted into dust.”\r\n\r\nNow of this long speech Umslopogaas understood nothing, so I answered\r\nfor him, briefly enough, but to the point, for there flashed into my\r\nmind all Ayesha’s tale about an axe.\r\n\r\n“A certain axe!” I cried. “Aye, a certain axe! Well, look at that which\r\nis held by the Black One, the captain who is named Slaughterer, the\r\nancient axe whose title is Chieftainess, because if so she wills, she\r\ntakes the lives of all. Look at it well, Rezu, Giant and Wizard, and\r\nsay whether it is not that which your forefather lost, that which is\r\ndestined to bring you to your doom?”\r\n\r\nThus I spoke, very loudly that all might hear, slowly also, pausing\r\nbetween each word because I wished to give time for the light to\r\nstrengthen, seeing as I did that the rays of the rising sun struck upon\r\nthe face of the giant, whereas the eyes of Umslopogaas were less\r\ndazzled by it.\r\n\r\nRezu heard, and stared at the axe which Umslopogaas held aloft, causing\r\nit to quiver slightly by an imperceptible motion of his arm. As he\r\nstared I saw his hideous face change, and that on it for the first time\r\ngathered a look of something resembling fear. Also his followers behind\r\nhim who were also studying the axe, began to murmur together.\r\n\r\nFor here I should say that as though by common consent the battle had\r\nbeen stayed; we no longer attacked and the enemy no longer ran. They,\r\nor whose who were left of them, stood still as though they felt that\r\nthe real and ultimate issue of the fight depended upon the forthcoming\r\nduel between these two champions, though of that issue they had little\r\ndoubt since, as I learned afterwards, they believed their king to be\r\ninvulnerable.\r\n\r\nFor quite a while Rezu went on staring. Then he said aloud as if he\r\nwere thinking to himself.\r\n\r\n“It is like, very like. The horn haft is the same; the pointed gouge is\r\nthe same; the blade shaped like the young moon is the same. Almost\r\ncould I think that before me shook the ancient holy axe. Nay, the gods\r\nhave taken that back long ago and this is but a trick of the witch,\r\nLulala of the Caves.”\r\n\r\nThus he spoke, but still for a moment hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Umslopogaas,” I said in the deep silence that followed, “hear me.”\r\n\r\n“I hear you,” he answered without turning his head or moving his arms.\r\n“What counsel, Watcher-by-Night?”\r\n\r\n“This, Slaughterer. Strike not at that man’s face and breast, for there\r\nI think he is protected by witchcraft or by armour. Get behind him and\r\nstrike at his back. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Macumazahn, I understand not. Yet I will do your bidding because\r\nyou are wiser than I and utter no empty words. Now be still.”\r\n\r\nThen Umslopogaas threw the axe into the air and caught it as it fell,\r\nand as he did so began to chant his own praises Zulu fashion.\r\n\r\n“Oho!” he said, “I am the child of the Lion, the Black-maned Lion,\r\nwhose claws never loosened of their prey. I am the Wolf-king, he who\r\nhunted with the wolves upon the Witch-mountain with my brother, Bearer\r\nof the Club named Watcher-of-the-Fords, I am he who slew him called the\r\nUnconquered, Chief of the People of the Axe, he who bore the ancient\r\nAxe before me; I am he who smote the Halakazi tribe in their caves and\r\nwon me Nada the Lily to wife. I am he who took to the King Dingaan a\r\ngift that he loved little, and afterward with Mopo, my foster-sire,\r\nhurled this Dingaan down to death. I am the Royal One, named Bulalio\r\nthe Slaughterer, named Woodpecker, named Umhlopekazi the Captain,\r\nbefore whom never yet man has stood in fair and open fight. Now, thou\r\nWizard Rezu, now thou Giant, now thou Ghost-man, come on against me and\r\nbefore the sun has risen by a hand’s breadth, all those who watch shall\r\nsee which of us is better at the game of war. Come on, then! Come on,\r\nfor I say that my blood boils over and my feet grow cold. Come on, thou\r\ngrinning dog, thou monster grown fat with eating the flesh of men, thou\r\nhook-beaked vulture, thou old, grey-whiskered wolf!”\r\n\r\nThus he chanted in his fierce, boastful way, while his two remaining\r\nZulus clapped their hands and sentence by sentence echoed his words,\r\nand Goroko, the witch-doctor, muttered incantations behind him.\r\n\r\nWhile he sang thus Umslopogaas began to stir. First only his head and\r\nshoulders moved gently, swaying from side to side like a reed shaken in\r\nthe wind or a snake about to strike. Then slowly he put out first one\r\nfoot and next the other and drew them back again, as a dancer might do,\r\ntempting Rezu to attack.\r\n\r\nBut the giant would not, his shield held before him, he stood still and\r\nwaited to see what this black warrior would do.\r\n\r\nThe snake struck. Umslopogaas darted in and let drive with the long\r\naxe. Rezu raised his shield above his head and caught the blow. From\r\nthe clank it made I knew that this shield which seemed to be of hide,\r\nwas lined with iron. Rezu smote back, but before the blow could fall\r\nthe Zulu was out of his reach. This taught me how great was the giant’s\r\nstrength, for though the stroke was heavy, like the steel-hatted axe he\r\nbore, still when he saw that it had missed he checked the weapon in mid\r\nair, which only a mighty man could have done.\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas saw these things also and changed his tactics. His axe was\r\nsix or eight inches longer in the haft than that of Rezu, and therefore\r\nhe could reach where Rezu could not, for the giant was short-armed. He\r\ntwisted it round in his hand so that the moon-shaped blade was\r\nuppermost, and keeping it almost at full length, began to peck with the\r\ngouge-shaped point on the back at the head and arms of Rezu, that as I\r\nknew was a favourite trick of his in fight from which he won his name\r\nof “Woodpecker.” Rezu defended his head with his shield as best he\r\ncould against the sharp points of steel which flashed all about him.\r\n\r\nTwice it seemed to me that the Zulu’s pecks went home upon the giant’s\r\nbreast, but if so they did no harm. Either Rezu’s thick beard, or\r\narmour beneath it stopped them from penetrating his body. Still he\r\nroared out as though with pain, or fury, or both, and growing mad,\r\ncharged at Umslopogaas and smote with all his strength.\r\n\r\nThe Zulu caught the blow upon his shield, through which it shore as\r\nthough the tough hide were paper. Stay the stroke it could not, yet it\r\nturned its direction, so that the falling axe slid past Umslopogaas’s\r\nshoulder, doing him no hurt. Next instant, before Rezu could strike\r\nagain, the Zulu threw the severed shield into his face and seizing the\r\naxe with both hands, leapt in and struck. It was a mighty blow, for I\r\nsaw the rhinoceros-horn handle of the famous axe bend like a drawn bow,\r\nand it went home with a dull thud full upon Rezu’s breast. He shook,\r\nbut no more. Evidently the razor edge of _Inkosikaas_ had failed to\r\npierce. There was a sound as though a hollow tree had been smitten and\r\nsome strands of the long beard, shorn off, fell to the ground, but that\r\nwas all.\r\n\r\n“_Tagati!_ (bewitched),” cried the watching Zulus. “That stroke should\r\nhave cut him in two!” while I thought to myself that this man knew how\r\nto make good armour.\r\n\r\nRezu laughed aloud, a bellowing kind of laugh, while Umslopogaas sprang\r\nback astonished.\r\n\r\n“Is it thus!” he cried in Zulu. “Well, all wizards have some door by\r\nwhich their Spirit enters and departs. I must find the door, I must\r\nfind the door!”\r\n\r\nSo he spoke and with springing movements tried to get past Rezu, first\r\nto the right and then to the left, all the while keeping out of reach.\r\nBut Rezu ever turned and faced him, as he did so retreating step by\r\nstep down the slope of the little hill and striking whenever he found a\r\nchance, but without avail, for always Umslopogaas was beyond his reach.\r\nAlso the sunlight which now grew strong, dazzled him, or so I thought.\r\nMoreover he seemed to tire somewhat—or so I thought also.\r\n\r\nAt any rate he determined to make an end of the play, for with a swift\r\nmotion, as Umslopogaas had done, he threw away his shield and grasping\r\nthe iron handle of his axe with both hands, charged the Zulu like a\r\nbull. Umslopogaas leapt back out of reach. Then suddenly he turned and\r\nran up the rise. Yes, Bulalio the Slaughterer ran!\r\n\r\nA roar of mockery went up from the sun-worshippers behind, while our\r\nAmahagger laughed and Goroko and the two Zulus stared astonished and\r\nashamed. Only I read his mind aright and wondered what guile he had\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nHe ran, and Rezu ran after him, but never could he catch the\r\nswiftest-footed man in Zululand. To and fro he followed him, for\r\nUmslopogaas was taking a zig-zag path towards the crest of the slope,\r\ntill at length Rezu stopped breathless. But Umslopogaas still ran\r\nanother twenty yards or so until he reached the top of the slope and\r\nthere halted and wheeled round.\r\n\r\nFor ten seconds or more he stood drawing his breath in great gasps,\r\nand, looking at his face, I saw that it had become as the face of a\r\nwolf. His lips were drawn up into a terrible grin, showing the white\r\nteeth between; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in and his eyes glared,\r\nwhile the skin over the hole in his forehead beat up and down.\r\n\r\nThere he stood, gathering himself together for some mighty effort.\r\n\r\n“Run on!” shouted the spectators. “Run back to Kôr, black dog!”\r\n\r\nUmslopogaas knew that they were mocking him, but he took no heed, only\r\nbent down and rubbed his sweating hand in the grit of the dry earth.\r\nThen he straightened himself and charged down on Rezu.\r\n\r\nI, Allan Quatermain, have seen many things in battle, but never before\r\nor since did I see aught like to this charge. It was swift as that of a\r\nlioness, so swift that the Zulu’s feet scarcely seemed to touch the\r\nground. On he sped like a thrown spear, till, when within about a dozen\r\nfeet of Rezu who stood staring at him, he bent his frame almost double\r\nand leapt into the air.\r\n\r\nOh! what a leap was that. Surely he must have learnt it from the lion,\r\nor the spring-buck. High he rose and now I saw his purpose; it was to\r\nclear the tall shape of Rezu. Aye, and he cleared him with half a foot\r\nto spare, and as he passed above, smote downwards with the axe so that\r\nthe blow fell upon the back of Rezu’s head. Moreover it went home this\r\ntime, for I saw the red blood stream and Rezu fell forward on his face.\r\nUmslopogaas landed far beyond him, ran a little way because he must,\r\nthen wheeled round and charged again.\r\n\r\nRezu was rising, but before he gained his feet, the axe _Inkosikaas_\r\nthundered down where the neck joins the shoulder and sank in. Still, so\r\ngreat was his strength that Rezu found his feet and smote out wildly.\r\nBut now his movements were slow and again Umslopogaas got behind him,\r\nsmiting at his back. Once, twice, thrice, he smote, and at the third\r\nblow it seemed as though the massive spine were severed, for his weapon\r\nfell from Rezu’s hand and slowly he sank down to the ground, and lay\r\nthere, a huddled heap.\r\n\r\nBelieving that all was over I ran to where he lay with Umslopogaas\r\nstanding over him, as it seemed to me, utterly exhausted, for he\r\nsupported himself by the axe and tottered upon his feet. But Rezu was\r\nnot yet dead. He opened his cavernous eyes and glared at the Zulu with\r\na look of hellish hate.\r\n\r\n“_Thou_ hast not conquered me, Black One,” he gasped. “It is thine axe\r\nwhich gave thee victory; the ancient, holy axe that once was mine until\r\nthe woman stole it, yes, that and the craft of the Witch of the Caves\r\nwho told thee to smite where the Spirit of Life which I feared to enter\r\nwholly, had not kissed my flesh, and there only left me mortal. Wolf of\r\na black man, may we meet elsewhere and fight this fray again. Ah! would\r\nthat I could get these hands about thy throat and take thee with me\r\ndown into the Darkness. But Lulala wins if only for a while, since her\r\nfate, I think, shall be worse than mine. Ah! I see the magic beauty\r\nthat she boasts turn to shameful——”\r\n\r\nHere of a sudden life left him and throwing his great arms wide, a last\r\nbreath passed bubbling from his lips.\r\n\r\nAs I stooped to examine the man’s huge and hairy carcase that to me\r\nlooked only half human, with a thunder of feet our Amahagger rushed\r\ndown upon us and thrusting me aside, fell upon the body of their\r\nancient foe like hounds upon a helpless fox, and with hands and spears\r\nand knives literally tore and hacked it limb from limb, till no\r\nsemblance of humanity remained.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to stop them; indeed I was too outworn with labours\r\nand emotions to make any such attempt. This I regret the more since I\r\nlost the opportunity of making an examination of the body of this\r\ntroll-like man, and of ascertaining what kind of armour it was he wore\r\nbeneath that great beard of his, which was strong enough to stop my\r\nbullets, and even the razor edge of the axe _Inkosikaas_ driven with\r\nall the might of the arms of the Zulu, Bulalio. For when I looked again\r\nat the sickening sight the giant was but scattered fragments and the\r\narmour, whatever it might have been, was gone, rent to little pieces\r\nand carried off, doubtless, by the Amahagger, perhaps to be divided\r\nbetween them to serve as charms.\r\n\r\nSo of Rezu I know only that he was the hugest, most terrible-looking\r\nman I have ever seen, one too who carried his vast strength very late\r\nin life, since from the aspect of his countenance I imagine that he\r\nmust have been nigh upon seventy years of age, though his supposed\r\nunnatural antiquity of course was nothing but a fable put about by the\r\nnatives for their own purposes.\r\n\r\nPresently Umslopogaas seemed to recover from the kind of faint into\r\nwhich he had fallen and opening his eyes, looked about him. The first\r\nperson they fell on was old Billali who stood stroking his white beard\r\nand contemplating the scene with an air which was at once philosophic\r\nand satisfied. This seemed to anger Umslopogaas, for he cried,\r\n\r\n“I think it was you, ancient bag of words and sweeper of paths for the\r\nfeet of the great, who made a mock of me but now, when you thought that\r\nI fled before the horns of yonder man-eating bull—” and he nodded\r\ntowards the fragments of what once had been Rezu. “Find now his axe and\r\nthough I am weak and weary, I will wash away the insult with your\r\nblood.”\r\n\r\n“What does this glorious black hero say, Watcher-by-Night?” asked\r\nBillali in his most courteous tones.\r\n\r\nI told him word by word, whereon Billali lifted his hands in horror,\r\nturned and fled. Nor did I see him again until we arrived at Kôr.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the fall of their giant chief Rezu whom they believed\r\nto be invulnerable, his followers, who were watching the fray, set up a\r\ngreat wailing, a most mournful and uncanny noise to hear. Then, as I\r\nthink did the hosts of the Philistines when David brought down Goliath\r\nby his admirable shot with a stone, they set out for their homes\r\nwherever these may have been, at an absolutely record pace and in the\r\ncompletest disarray.\r\n\r\nOur Amahagger followed them for a while, but soon were left standing\r\nstill. So they contented themselves with killing any wounded they could\r\nfind and returned. I did not accompany them; indeed the battle being\r\nwon, metaphorically I washed my hands of them, and in my thoughts\r\nconsigned them to a certain locality as a people of whom it might well\r\nbe said that manners they had none and their customs were simply\r\nbeastly. Also, although fierce and cruel, these night-bats were not\r\ngood fighting men and in short never did I wish to have to do with such\r\nanother company.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a very different matter pressed. The object of this business\r\nso far as I was concerned, had been to rescue poor Inez, since had it\r\nnot been for her sake, never would I have consented to lead those\r\nAmahagger against their fellow blackguards, the Rezuites.\r\n\r\nBut where was Inez? If Hans had understood the medicine-man aright, she\r\nwas, or had been, in the hut, where it was my earnest hope that she\r\nstill remained, since otherwise the hunt must be continued. This at any\r\nrate was easy to discover. Calling Hans, who was amusing himself by\r\ntaking long shots at the flying enemy, so that they might not forget\r\nhim, as he said, and the Zulus, I walked up the slope to the hut, or\r\nrather booth of boughs, for it was quite twenty feet long by twelve or\r\nfifteen broad.\r\n\r\nAt its eastern end was a doorway or opening closed with a heavy\r\ncurtain. Here I paused full of tremors, and listened, for to tell the\r\ntruth I dreaded to draw that curtain, fearing what I might see within.\r\nGathering up my courage at length I tore it aside and, a revolver in my\r\nhand, looked in. At first after the strong light without, for the sun\r\nwas now well up, I could see nothing, since those green boughs and palm\r\nleaves were very closely woven. As my eyes grew accustomed to the\r\ngloom, however, I perceived a glittering object seated on a kind of\r\nthrone at the end of the booth, while in a double row in front knelt\r\nsix white-robed women who seemed to wear chains about their necks and\r\ncarried large knives slung round their middles. On the floor between\r\nthese women and the throne lay a dead man, a priest of some sort as I\r\ngathered from his garb, who still held a huge spear in his hand. So\r\nsilent were the figure on the throne and those that knelt before it,\r\nthat at first I thought that all of them must be dead.\r\n\r\n“Lady Sad-Eyes,” whispered Hans, “and her bride-women. Doubtless that\r\nold Predikant came to kill her when he saw that the battle was lost,\r\nbut the bride-women killed him with their knives.”\r\n\r\nHere I may state that Hans’ suppositions proved to be quite correct,\r\nwhich shows how quick and deductive was his mind. The figure on the\r\nthrone was Inez; the priest in his disappointed rage _had_ come to kill\r\nher, and the bride-women had killed _him_ with their knives before he\r\ncould do so.\r\n\r\nI bade the Zulus tear down the curtain and pull away some of the end\r\nboughs, so as to let in more light. Then we advanced up the place,\r\nholding our pistols and spears in readiness. The kneeling women turned\r\ntheir heads to look at us and I saw that they were all young and\r\nhandsome in their fashion, although fierce-faced. Also I saw their\r\nhands go to the knives they wore. I called to them to let these be and\r\ncome out, and that if they did so they had nothing to fear. But if they\r\nunderstood, they did not heed my words.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary while Hans and I covered them with our pistols, fearing\r\nlest they should stab the person on the throne whom we took to be Inez,\r\nat some word from one of them, they bowed simultaneously towards her,\r\nthen at another word, suddenly they drew the knives and plunged them to\r\ntheir own hearts!\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadful sight and one of which I never saw the like. Nor to\r\nthis day do I know why the deed was done, unless perhaps the women were\r\nsworn to the service of the new queen and feared that if they failed to\r\nprotect her, they would be doomed to some awful end. At any rate we got\r\nthem out dead or dying, for their blows had been strong and true, and\r\nnot one of them lived for more than a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThen I advanced to the figure on the throne, or rather foot-stooled\r\nchair of black wood inlaid with ivory, which sat so silent and\r\nmotionless that I was certain it was that of a dead woman, especially\r\nwhen I perceived that she was fastened to the chair with leather\r\nstraps, which were sewn over with gold wire. Also she was veiled and,\r\nwith one exception, made up, if I may use the term, exactly to resemble\r\nthe lady Ayesha, even down to the two long plaits of black hair, each\r\nfinished with some kind of pearl and to the sandalled feet.\r\n\r\nThe exception was that about her hung a great necklace of gold\r\nornaments from which were suspended pendants also of gold representing\r\nthe rayed disc of the sun in rude but bold and striking workmanship.\r\n\r\nI went to her and having cut the straps, since I could not stop to\r\nuntie their knots, lifted the veil.\r\n\r\nBeneath it was Inez sure enough, and Inez living, for her breast rose\r\nand fell as she breathed, but Inez senseless. Her eyes were wide open,\r\nyet she was quite senseless. Probably she had been drugged, or perhaps\r\nsome of the sights of horror which she saw, had taken away her mind. I\r\nconfess that I was glad that this was so, who otherwise must have told\r\nher the dreadful story of her father’s end.\r\n\r\nWe bore her out and away from that horrible place, apparently quite\r\nunhurt, and laid her under the shadow of a tree till a litter could be\r\nprocured. I could do no more who knew not how to treat her state, and\r\nhad no spirits with me to pour down her throat.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of our long pursuit, and thus we rescued Inez, whom\r\nthe Zulus called the Lady Sad-Eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTHE SPELL\r\n\r\n\r\nOf our return to Kôr I need say nothing, except that in due course we\r\nreached that interesting ruin. The journey was chiefly remarkable for\r\none thing, that on this occasion, I imagine for the first and last time\r\nin his life, Umslopogaas consented to be carried in a litter, at least\r\nfor part of the way. He was, as I have said, unwounded, for the axe of\r\nhis mighty foe had never once so much as touched his skin. What he\r\nsuffered from was shock, a kind of collapse, since, although few would\r\nhave thought it, this great and utterly fearless warrior was at bottom\r\na nervous, highly-strung man.\r\n\r\nIt is only the nervous that climb the highest points of anything, and\r\nthis is true of fights as of all others. That fearful fray with Rezu\r\nhad been a great strain on the Zulu. As he put it himself, “the wizard\r\nhad sucked the strength” out of him, especially when he found that\r\nowing to his armour he could not harm him in front, and owing to his\r\ncunning could not get at him behind. Then it was that he conceived the\r\ndesperate expedient of leaping over his head and smiting backwards as\r\nhe leapt, a trick, he told me, that he had once played years before\r\nwhen he was young, in order to break a shield ring and reach one who\r\nstood in its centre.\r\n\r\nIn this great leap over Rezu’s head Umslopogaas knew that he must\r\nsucceed, or be slain, which in turn would mean my death and that of the\r\nothers. For this reason he faced the shame of seeming to fly in order\r\nto gain the higher ground, whence alone he could gather the speed\r\nnecessary to such a terrific spring.\r\n\r\nWell, he made it and thereby conquered, and this was the end, but as he\r\nsaid, it had left him, “weak as a snake when it crawls out of its hole\r\ninto the sun after the long winter sleep.”\r\n\r\nOf one thing, Umslopogaas added, he was thankful, namely that Rezu had\r\nnever succeeded in getting his arms round him, since he was quite\r\ncertain that if he had he would have broken him “as a baboon breaks a\r\nmealie-stalk.” No strength, not even his, could have resisted the iron\r\nmight of that huge, gorilla-like man.\r\n\r\nI agreed with him who had noted Rezu’s vast chest and swelling muscles,\r\nalso the weight of the blows that he struck with the steel-hafted axe\r\n(which, by the way, when I sought for it, was missing, stolen, I\r\nsuppose, by one of the Amahagger).\r\n\r\nWhence did that strength come, I wondered, in one who from his face\r\nappeared to be old? Was there perchance, after all, some truth in the\r\nlegend of Samson and did it dwell in that gigantic beard and those long\r\nlocks of his? It was impossible to say and probably the man was but a\r\nHerculean freak, for that he was as strong as Hercules all the stories\r\nthat I heard afterwards of his feats, left little room for doubt.\r\n\r\nAbout one thing only was I certain in connection with him, namely, that\r\nthe tales of his supernatural abilities were the merest humbug. He was\r\nsimply one of the representatives of the family of “strong men,” of\r\nwhom examples are still to be seen doing marvellous feats all over the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, he was dead and broken up by those Amahagger blood-hounds\r\nbefore I could examine him, or his body-armour either, and there was an\r\nend of him and his story. But when I looked at the corpse of poor\r\nRobertson, which I did as we buried it where he fell, and saw that\r\nthough so large and thick-set, it was cleft almost in two by a single\r\nblow of Rezu’s axe, I came to understand what the might of this savage\r\nmust have been.\r\n\r\nI say savage, but I am not sure that this is a right description of\r\nRezu. Evidently he had a religion of a sort, also imagination, as was\r\nshown by the theft of the white woman to be his queen; by his veiling\r\nof her to resemble Ayesha whom he dreaded; by the intended propitiatory\r\nsacrifice; by the guard of women sworn to her service who slew the\r\npriest that tried to kill her, and afterwards committed suicide when\r\nthey had failed in their office, and by other things. All this\r\nindicated something more than savagery, perhaps survivals from a\r\nforgotten civilisation, or perhaps native ability on the part of an\r\nindividual ruler. I do not know and it matters nothing.\r\n\r\nRezu is dead and the world is well rid of him, and those who want to\r\nlearn more of his people can go to study such as remain of them in\r\ntheir own habitat, which for my part I never wish to visit any more.\r\n\r\nDuring our journey to Kôr poor Inez never stirred. Whenever I went to\r\nlook at her in the litter, I found her lying there with her eyes open\r\nand a fixed stare upon her face which frightened me very much, since I\r\nbegan to fear lest she should die. However I could do nothing to help\r\nher, except urge the bearers to top speed. So swiftly did we travel\r\ndown the hill and across the plain that we reached Kôr just as the sun\r\nwas setting. As we crossed the moat I perceived old Billali coming to\r\nmeet us. This he did with many bows, keeping an anxious eye upon the\r\nlitter which he had learned contained Umslopogaas. Indeed his attitude\r\nand that of the Amahagger towards the two of us, and even Hans,\r\nthenceforward became almost abject, since after our victory over Rezu\r\nand his death beneath the axe, they looked upon us as half divine and\r\ntreated us accordingly.\r\n\r\n“O mighty General,” he said, “She-who-commands bids me conduct the lady\r\nwho is sick to the place that has been made ready for her, which is\r\nnear your own so that you may watch over her if you will.”\r\n\r\nI wondered how Ayesha knew that Inez was sick, but being too tired to\r\nask questions, merely bade him lead on. This he did, taking us to\r\nanother ruined house next to our own quarters which had been swept,\r\ncleaned and furnished after a fashion, and moreover cleverly roofed in\r\nwith mats, so that it was really quite comfortable. Here we found two\r\nmiddle-aged women of a very superior type, who, Billali informed me,\r\nwere by trade nurses of the sick. Having seen her laid upon her bed, I\r\ncommitted Inez to their charge, since the case was not one that I dared\r\nto try to doctor myself, not knowing what drug of the few I possessed\r\nshould be administered to her. Moreover Billali comforted me with the\r\ninformation that soon She-who-commands would visit her and “make her\r\nwell again,” as she could do.\r\n\r\nI answered that I hoped so and went to our quarters where I found an\r\nexcellent meal ready cooked and with it a stone flagon, of the contents\r\nof which Billali said we were all three to drink by the command of\r\nAyesha, who declared that it would take away our weariness.\r\n\r\nI tried the stuff, which was pale yellow in colour like sherry and, for\r\naught I knew, might be poison, to find it most comforting, though it\r\ndid not seem to be very strong to the taste. Certainly, too, its\r\neffects were wonderful, since presently all my great weariness fell\r\nfrom me like a discarded cloak, and I found myself with a splendid\r\nappetite and feeling better and stronger than I had done for years. In\r\nshort that drink was a “cocktail” of the best, one of which I only wish\r\nI possessed the recipe, though Ayesha told me afterwards that it was\r\ndistilled from quite harmless herbs and not in any sense a spirit.\r\n\r\nHaving discovered this, I gave some of it to Hans, also to Umslopogaas,\r\nwho was with the wounded Zulus, who, we found, were progressing well\r\ntowards complete recovery, and lastly to Goroko who also was worn out.\r\nOn all of these the effect of that magical brew proved most\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThen, having washed, I ate a splendid dinner, though in this respect\r\nHans, who was seated on the ground nearby, far outpassed my finest\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n“Baas,” he said, “things have gone very well with us when they might\r\nhave gone very ill. The Baas Red-Beard is dead, which is a good thing,\r\nsince a madman would have been difficult to look after, and a brain\r\nfull of moonshine is a bad companion for any one. Oh! without doubt he\r\nis better dead, though your reverend father the Predikant will have a\r\nhard job looking after him there in the Place of Fires.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” I said with a sigh, “since it is better to be dead than to\r\nlive a lunatic. But what I fear is that the lady his daughter will\r\nfollow him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! Baas,” replied Hans cheerfully, “though I daresay that she\r\nwill always be a little mad also, because you see it is in her blood\r\nand doubtless she has looked on dreadful things. But the Great Medicine\r\nwill see to it that she does not die after we have taken so much\r\ntrouble and gone into such big dangers to save her. That Great Medicine\r\nis very wonderful, Baas. First of all it makes you General over those\r\nAmahagger who without you would never have fought, as the Witch who\r\nties up her head in a cloth knew well enough. Then it brings us safe\r\nthrough the battle and gives strength to Umslopogaas to kill the old\r\nman-eating giant.”\r\n\r\n“Why did it not give _me_ strength to kill him, Hans? I let him have\r\ntwo Express bullets on his chest, which hurt him no more than a tap\r\nupon the horns with a dancing stick would hurt a bull-buffalo.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Baas, perhaps you missed him, who because you hit things\r\nsometimes, think that you do so always.”\r\n\r\nHaving waited to see if I would rise to this piece of insolence, which\r\nof course I did not, he went on by way of letting me down easily, “Or\r\nperhaps he wore very good armour under his beard, for I saw some of\r\nthose Amahagger who pulled his hair off and cut him to pieces, go away\r\nwith what looked like little bits of brass. Also the Great Medicine\r\nmeant that he should be killed by Umslopogaas and not by you, since\r\notherwise Umslopogaas would have been sad for the rest of his life,\r\nwhereas now he will walk about the world as proud as a cock with two\r\ntails and crow all night as well as all day. Then, Baas, when Rezu\r\nbroke the square and the Amahagger began to run, without doubt it was\r\nthe Great Medicine which changed their hearts and made them brave\r\nagain, so that they charged at the right moment when they saw it going\r\nforward on your breast, and instead of being eaten up, ate up the\r\ncannibals.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! I thought that the Lady who dwells yonder had something to do\r\nwith that business. Did you see her, Hans?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! I saw her, Baas, and I think that without doubt she lifted\r\nthe cloth from over her head and when the people of Rezu saw how ugly\r\nwas the face beneath, it did frighten them a little. But doubtless the\r\nGreat Medicine put that thought into her also, for, Baas, what could a\r\nsilly woman do in such a case? Did you ever know of a woman who was of\r\nany use in a battle, or for anything else except to nurse babies, and\r\nthis one does not even do that, no doubt because being so hideous under\r\nthat sheet, no man can be found to marry her.”\r\n\r\nNow I looked up by chance and in the light of the lamps saw Ayesha\r\nstanding in the room, which she had entered through the open doorway,\r\nwithin six feet of Hans’ back indeed.\r\n\r\n“Be sure Baas,” he went on, “that this bundle of rags is nothing but a\r\ncommon old cheat who frightens people by pretending to be a spook, as,\r\nif she dared to say that it was she who made those stinking Amahagger\r\ncharge, and not the Great Medicine of the Opener-of-Roads, I would tell\r\nher to her face.”\r\n\r\nNow I was too paralysed to speak, and while I was reflecting that it\r\nwas fortunate Ayesha did not understand Dutch, she moved a little so\r\nthat one of the lamps behind her caused her shadow to fall on to the\r\nback of the squatting Hans and over it on to the floor beyond. He saw\r\nit and stared at the distorted shape of the hooded head, then slowly\r\nscrewed his neck round and looked upwards behind him.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he went on staring as though he were frozen, then uttering\r\na wild yell, he scrambled to his feet, bolted out of the house and\r\nvanished into the night.\r\n\r\n“It seems, Allan,” said Ayesha slowly, “that yonder yellow ape of yours\r\nis very bold at throwing sticks when the leopardess is not beneath the\r\ntree. But when she comes it is otherwise with him. Oh! make no excuse,\r\nfor I know well that he was speaking ill things of me, because being\r\ncurious, as apes are, he burns to learn what is behind my veil, and\r\nbeing simple, believes that no woman would hide her face unless its\r\nfashion were not pleasing to the nice taste of men.”\r\n\r\nThen, to my relief, she laughed a little, softly, which showed me that\r\nshe had a sense of humour, and went on, “Well, let him be, for he is a\r\ngood ape and courageous in his fashion, as he showed when he went out\r\nto spy upon the host of Rezu, and stabbed the murderer-priest by the\r\nstone of sacrifice.”\r\n\r\n“How can you know the words of Hans, Ayesha,” I asked, “seeing that he\r\nspoke in a tongue which you have never learned?”\r\n\r\n“Perchance I read faces, Allan.”\r\n\r\n“Or backs,” I suggested, remembering that his was turned to her.\r\n\r\n“Or backs, or voices, or hearts. It matters little which, since read I\r\ndo. But have done with such childish talk and lead me to this maiden\r\nwho has been snatched from the claws of Rezu and a fate that is worse\r\nthan death. Do you understand, Allan, that ere the demon Rezu took her\r\nto wife, the plan was to sacrifice her own father to her and then eat\r\nhim as the woman with her was eaten, and before her eyes? Now the\r\nfather is dead, which is well, as I think the little yellow man said to\r\nyou—nay, start not, I read it from his back [Ha!—JB]—since had he lived\r\nwhose brain was rotted, he would have raved till his death’s day.\r\nBetter, therefore, that he should die like a man fighting against a foe\r\nunconquerable by all save one. But she still lives.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, but mindless, Ayesha.”\r\n\r\n“Which, in great trouble such as she has passed, is a blessed state, O\r\nAllan. Bethink you, have there not been days, aye and months, in your\r\nown life when you would have rejoiced to sleep in mindlessness? And\r\nshould we not, perchance, be happier, all of us, if like the beasts we\r\ncould not remember, foreknow and understand? Oh! men talk of Heaven,\r\nbut believe me, the real Heaven is one of dreamless sleep, since life\r\nand wakefulness, however high their scale and on whatever star, mean\r\nstruggle, which being so oft mistaken, must breed sorrow—or remorse\r\nthat spoils all. Come now.”\r\n\r\nSo I preceded her to the next ruined house where we found Inez lying on\r\nthe bed still clothed in her barbaric trappings, although the veil had\r\nbeen drawn off her face. There she lay, wide-eyed and still, while the\r\nwomen watched her. Ayesha looked at her a while, then said to me,\r\n\r\n“So they tricked her out to be Ayesha’s mock and image, and in time\r\naccepted by those barbarians as my very self, and even set the seals of\r\nroyalty on her,” and she pointed to the gold discs stamped with the\r\nlikeness of the sun. “Well, she is a fair maiden, white and gently\r\nbred, the first such that I have seen for many an age. Nor did she wish\r\nthis trickery. Moreover she has taken no hurt; her soul has sunk deep\r\ninto a sea of horror and that is all, whence doubtless it can be drawn\r\nagain. Yet I think it best that for a while she should remember naught,\r\nlest her brain break, as did her father’s, and therefore no net of mine\r\nshall drag her back to memory. Let that return gently in future days,\r\nand then of it not too much, for so shall all this terror become to her\r\na void in which sad shapes move like shadows, and as shadows are soon\r\nforgot and gone, no more to be held than dreams by the awakening sense.\r\nStand aside, Allan, and you women, leave us for a while.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and the women bowed and went. Then Ayesha drew up her veil,\r\nand knelt down by the bed of Inez, but in such a fashion that I could\r\nnot see her face although I admit that I tried to do so. I could see,\r\nhowever, that she set her lips against those of Inez and as I gathered\r\nby her motions, seemed to breathe into her lips. Also she lifted her\r\nhands and placing one of them upon the heart of Inez, for a minute or\r\nmore swayed the other from side to side above her eyes, pausing at\r\ntimes to touch her upon the forehead with her finger-tips.\r\n\r\nPresently Inez stirred and sat up, whereon Ayesha took a vessel of milk\r\nwhich stood upon the floor and held it to her lips. Inez drank to the\r\nlast drop, then sank on to the bed again. For a while longer Ayesha\r\ncontinued the motions of her hands, then let fall her veil and rose.\r\n\r\n“Look, I have laid a spell upon her,” she said, beckoning to me to draw\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nI did so and perceived that now the eyes of Inez were shut and that she\r\nseemed to be plunged in a deep and natural sleep.\r\n\r\n“So she will remain for this night and that day which follows,” said\r\nAyesha, “and when she wakes it will be, I think, to believe herself\r\nonce more a happy child. Not until she sees her home again will she\r\nfind her womanhood, and then all this story will be forgotten by her.\r\nOf her father you must tell her that he died when you went out to hunt\r\nthe river-beasts together, and if she seeks for certain others, that\r\nthey have gone away. But I think that she will ask little more when she\r\nlearns that he is dead, since I have laid that command upon her soul.”\r\n\r\n“Hypnotic suggestion,” thought I to myself, “and I only hope to heaven\r\nthat it will work.”\r\n\r\nAyesha seemed to guess what was passing through my mind, for she nodded\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n“Have no fear, Allan, for I am what the black axe-bearer and the little\r\nyellow man called a ‘witch’ which means, as you who are instructed\r\nknow, one who has knowledge of medicine and other things and who holds\r\na key to some of the mysteries that lie hid in Nature.”\r\n\r\n“For instance,” I suggested, “of how to transport yourself into a\r\nbattle at the right moment, and out of it again—also at the right\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Allan, since watching from afar, I saw that those Amahagger curs\r\nwere about to flee and that I was needed there to hearten them and to\r\nput fear into the army of Rezu. So I came.”\r\n\r\n“But how did you come, Ayesha?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed as she answered,\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I did not come at all. Perhaps you only thought I came; since\r\nI seemed to be there the rest matters nothing.”\r\n\r\nAs I still looked unconvinced she went on,\r\n\r\n“Oh! foolish man, seek not to learn of that which is too high for you.\r\nYet listen. You in your ignorance suppose that the soul dwells within\r\nthe body, do you not?”\r\n\r\nI answered that I had always been under this impression.\r\n\r\n“Yet, Allan, it is otherwise, for the body dwells within the soul.”\r\n\r\n“Like the pearl in an oyster,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“Aye, in a sense, since the pearl which to you is beautiful, is to the\r\noyster a sickness and a poison, and so is the body to the soul whose\r\ntemple it troubles and defiles. Yet round it is the white and holy soul\r\nthat ever seeks to bring the vile body to its own purity and colour,\r\nyet oft-times fails. Learn, Allan, that flesh and spirit are the\r\ndeadliest foes joined together by a high decree that they may forget\r\ntheir hate and perfect each other, or failing, be separate to all\r\neternity, the spirit going to its own place and the flesh to its\r\ncorruption.”\r\n\r\n“A strange theory,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Aye, Allan, and one which is so new to you that never will you\r\nunderstand it. Yet it is true and I set it out for this reason. The\r\nsoul of man, being at liberty and not cooped within his narrow breast,\r\nis in touch with that soul of the Universe, which men know as God Whom\r\nthey call by many names. Therefore it has all knowledge and perhaps all\r\npower, and at times the body within it, if it be a wise body, can draw\r\nfrom this well of knowledge and abounding power. So at least can I. And\r\nnow you will understand why I am so good a doctoress and how I came to\r\nappear in the battle, as you said, at the right time, and to leave it\r\nwhen my work was done.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes,” I answered, “I quite understand. I thank you much for\r\nputting it so plainly.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed a little, appreciating my jest, looked at the sleeping\r\nInez, and said,\r\n\r\n“The fair body of this lady dwells in a large soul, I think, though one\r\nof a somewhat sombre hue, for souls have their colours, Allan, and\r\nstain that which is within them. She will never be a happy woman.”\r\n\r\n“The black people named her Sad-Eyes,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Is it so? Well, I name her Sad-Heart, though for such often there is\r\njoy at last. Meanwhile she will forget; yes, she will forget the worst\r\nand how narrow was the edge between her and the arms of Rezu.”\r\n\r\n“Just the width of the blade of the axe, _Inkosikaas_,” I answered.\r\n“But tell me, Ayesha, why could not that axe cut and why did my bullets\r\nflatten or turn aside when these smote the breast of Rezu?”\r\n\r\n“Because his front-armour was good, Allan, I suppose,” she replied\r\nindifferently, “and on his back he wore none.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you fill my ears with such a different tale about that\r\nhorrible giant having drunk of a Cup of Life, and all the rest?” I\r\nasked with irritation.\r\n\r\n“I have forgotten, Allan. Perhaps because the curious, such as you are,\r\nlike to hear tales even stranger than their own, which in the days to\r\nbe may become their own. Therefore you will be wise to believe only\r\nwhat I do, and of what I tell you, nothing.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” I exclaimed exasperated.\r\n\r\nShe laughed again and replied,\r\n\r\n“What need to say to me that which I know already? Yet perhaps in the\r\nfuture it may be different, since often by the alchemy of the mind the\r\nfables of our youth are changed into the facts of our age, and we come\r\nto believe in anything, as your little yellow man believes in some\r\nsavage named Zikali, and those Amahagger believe in the talisman round\r\nyour neck, and I who am the maddest of you all, believe in Love and\r\nWisdom, and the black warrior, Umslopogaas, believes in the virtue of\r\nthat great axe of his, rather than in those of his own courage and of\r\nthe strength that wields it. Fools, every one of us, though perchance I\r\nam the greatest fool among them. Now take me to the warrior,\r\nUmslopogaas, whom I would thank, as I thank you, Allan, and the little\r\nyellow man, although he jeers at me with his sharp tongue, not knowing\r\nthat if I were angered, with a breath I could cause him to cease to\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you not choose Rezu to cease to be, and his army also,\r\nAyesha?”\r\n\r\n“It seems that I have done these things through the axe of Umslopogaas\r\nand by the help of your generalship, Allan. Why then, waste my own\r\nstrength when yours lay to my hand?”\r\n\r\n“Because you had no power over Rezu, Ayesha, or so you told me.”\r\n\r\n“Have I not said that my words are snowflakes, meant to melt and leave\r\nno trace, hiding my thoughts as this veil hides my beauty? Yet as the\r\nbeauty is beneath the veil, perchance there is truth beneath the words,\r\nthough not that truth you think. So you are well answered, and for the\r\nrest, I wonder whether Rezu thought I had no power over him when yonder\r\non the mountain spur he saw me float down upon his companies like a\r\nspirit of the night. Well, perchance some day I shall learn this and\r\nmany other things.”\r\n\r\nI made no answer, since what was the use of arguing with a woman who\r\ntold me frankly that all she said was false. So, although I longed to\r\nask her why these Amahagger had such reverence for the talisman that\r\nHans called the Great Medicine, since now I guessed that her first\r\nexplanations concerning it were quite untrue, I held my tongue.\r\n\r\nYet as we went out of the house, by some coincidence she alluded to\r\nthis very matter.\r\n\r\n“I wish to tell you, Allan,” she said, “why it was those Amahagger\r\nwould not accept you as a General till their eyes had seen that which\r\nyou wear upon your breast. Their tale of a legend of this very thing\r\nseemed that of savages or of their cunning priests, not to be believed\r\nby a wise man such as you are, like some others that you have heard in\r\nKôr. Yet it has in it a grain of truth, for as it chanced a little\r\nwhile ago, about a hundred years ago, I think, the old wizard whose\r\npicture is cut upon the wood, came to visit her who held my place\r\nbefore me as ruler of this tribe—she was very like me and as I believe,\r\nmy mother, Allan—because of her repute for wisdom.\r\n\r\n“At that time I have heard there was a question of war between the\r\nworshippers of Lulala and the grandfather of Rezu. But this Zikali told\r\nthe People of Lulala that they must not fight the People of Rezu until\r\nin a day to come a white man should visit Kôr and bring with him a\r\npiece of wood on which was cut the image of a dwarf like to that of\r\nZikali himself. Then and not before they must fight and conquer the\r\nPeople of Rezu. Now this story came down among them and you who may\r\nhave thought the first tale magical, will understand it in its\r\nsimplicity: is it not so, you wise Allan?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes,” I answered, “except that I do not see how Zikali can have\r\ncome here a hundred years ago, since men do not live as long, although\r\nhe pretends to have done so.”\r\n\r\n“No, Allan, nor do I, but perhaps it was his father, or his grandfather\r\nwho came, since being observant, you will have noted that if the parent\r\nis mis-formed, so often are the descendants; also that the pretence of\r\nwizardry at times comes down with the blood.”\r\n\r\nAgain I made no answer for I saw that Ayesha was fooling me, and before\r\nshe could exhaust that amusement we reached the place where Umslopogaas\r\nand his men were gathered round a camp fire. He sat silent, but Goroko\r\nwith much animation was telling the story of the fight in picturesque\r\nand colourful language, or that part of it which he had seen, for the\r\nbenefit of the two wounded men who took no share in it and who, lying\r\non their blankets with heads thrust forward, were listening with\r\neagerness to the entrancing tale. Suddenly they caught sight of Ayesha,\r\nand those of the party who could stand sprang to their feet, while one\r\nand all they gave her the royal salute of _Bayéte_.\r\n\r\nShe waited till the sound had died away. Then she said,\r\n\r\n“I come to thank you and your men, O Wielder of the Axe, who have shown\r\nyourself very great in battle, and to say to you that my Spirit tells\r\nme that every one of you, yes, even those who are still sick, will come\r\nsafe to your own land again and live out your years with honour.”\r\n\r\nAgain they saluted at this pleasing intelligence, when I had translated\r\nit to them, for of course they knew no Arabic. Then she went on,\r\n\r\n“I am told, Umslopogaas, Son of the Lion, as a certain king was named\r\nin your land, that the fight you made against Rezu was a very great\r\nfight, and that such a leap as yours above his head when you smote him\r\nwith the axe on the hinder parts where he wore no armour, and brought\r\nhim to his death, has not been seen before, nor will be again.”\r\n\r\nI rendered the words, and Umslopogaas, preferring truth to modesty,\r\nreplied emphatically that this was the case.\r\n\r\n“Because of that fight and that leap,” Ayesha went on, “as for other\r\ndeeds that you have done and will do, my Spirit tells me that your name\r\nwill live in story for many generations. Yet of what use is fame to the\r\ndead? Therefore I make you an offer. Bide here with me and you shall\r\nrule these Amahagger, and with them the remnant of the People of Rezu.\r\nYour cattle shall be countless and your wives the fairest in the land,\r\nand your children many, for I will lift a certain curse from off you so\r\nthat no more shall you be childless. Do you accept, O Holder of the\r\nAxe?”\r\n\r\nWhen he understood, Umslopogaas, after pondering a moment, asked if I\r\nmeant to stay in this land and marry the white chieftainess who spoke\r\nsuch wise words and could appear and disappear in the battle at her\r\nwill, and like a mountain-top hid her head in a cloud, which was his\r\nway of alluding to her veil.\r\n\r\nI answered at once and with decision that I intended to do nothing of\r\nthe sort and immediately regretted my words, since, although I spoke in\r\nZulu, I suppose she read their meaning from my face. At any rate she\r\nunderstood the drift of them.\r\n\r\n“Tell him, Allan,” she said with a kind of icy politeness, “that you\r\nwill not stop here and marry me, because if ever I chose a husband he\r\nwould not be a little man at the doors of whose heart so many women’s\r\nhands have knocked—yes, even those that are black—and not, I think, in\r\nvain. One, moreover, who holds himself so clever that he believes he\r\nhas nothing left to learn, and in every flower of truth that is shown\r\nto him, however fair, smells only poison, and beneath, nurturing it,\r\nsees only the gross root of falsehood planted in corruption. Tell him\r\nthese things, Allan, if it pleases you.”\r\n\r\n“It does not please me,” I answered in a rage at her insults.\r\n\r\n“Nor is it needful, Allan, since if I caught the meaning of that\r\nbarbarous tongue you use aright, you have told him already. Well, let\r\nthe jest pass, O man who least of all things desires to be Ayesha’s\r\nhusband, and whom Ayesha least of all things desires as her spouse, and\r\nask the Axe-bearer nothing since I perceive that without you he will\r\nnot stay at Kôr. Nor indeed is it fated that he should do so, for now\r\nmy Spirit tells me what it hid from me when I spoke a moment gone, that\r\nthis warrior shall die in a great fight far away and that between then\r\nand now much sorrow waits him who save that of one, knows not how to\r\nwin the love of women. Let him say moreover what reward he desires\r\nsince if I can give it to him, it shall be his.”\r\n\r\nAgain I translated. Umslopogaas received her prophecies in stoical\r\nsilence, and as I thought with indifference, and only said in reply,\r\n\r\n“The glory that I have won is my reward and the only boon I seek at\r\nthis queen’s hands is that if she can she should give me sight of a\r\nwoman for whom my heart is hungry, and with it knowledge that this\r\nwoman lives in that land whither I travel like all men.”\r\n\r\nWhen she heard these words Ayesha said,\r\n\r\n“True, I had forgotten. Your heart also is hungry, I think, Allan, for\r\nthe vision of sundry faces that you see no more. Well, I will do my\r\nbest, but since only faith fulfils itself, how can I who must strive to\r\npierce the gates of darkness for one so unbelieving, know that they\r\nwill open at my word? Come to me, both of you, at the sunset\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThen as though to change the subject, she talked to me for a long while\r\nabout Kôr, of which she told me a most interesting history, true or\r\nfalse, that I omit here.\r\n\r\nAt length, as though suddenly she had grown tired, waving her hand to\r\nshow that the conversation was ended, Ayesha went to the wounded men\r\nand touched them each in turn.\r\n\r\n“Now they will recover swiftly,” she said, and leaving the place was\r\ngone into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE GATE OF DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore turning in I examined these wounded men for myself. The truth is\r\nthat I was anxious to learn their exact condition in order that I might\r\nmake an estimate as to when it would be possible for us to leave this\r\nvalley or crater bottom of Kôr, of which I was heartily tired. Who\r\ncould desire to stay in a place where he had not only been involved in\r\na deal of hard, doubtful, and very dangerous fighting from which all\r\npersonal interest was absent, but where also he was meshed in a perfect\r\nspider’s web of bewilderment, and exposed to continual insult into the\r\nbargain?\r\n\r\nFor that is what it came to; this Ayesha took every opportunity to jeer\r\nat and affront me. And why? Just because I had conceived doubts, which\r\nsomehow she discovered, of the amazing tales with which it had amused\r\nher to stuff me, as a farmer’s wife does a turkey poult with meal\r\npellets. How could she expect me, a man, after all, of some experience,\r\nto believe such lies, which, not half an hour before, in the coolest\r\npossible fashion she had herself admitted to be lies and nothing else,\r\ntold for the mere pleasure of romancing?\r\n\r\nThe immortal Rezu, for instance, who had drunk of the Cup of Life or\r\nsome such rubbish, now turned out to be nothing but a brawny savage\r\ndescended from generations of chiefs also called Rezu. Moreover the\r\nimmemorial Ayesha, who also had drunk of Cups of Life, and according to\r\nher first story, had lived in this place for thousands of years, had\r\ncome here with a mother, who filled the same mystic rôle before her for\r\nthe benefit of an extremely gloomy and disagreeable tribe of Semitic\r\nsavages. Yet she was cross with me because I had not swallowed her\r\ncrude and indigestible mixture of fable and philosophy without a\r\nmoment’s question.\r\n\r\nAt least I supposed that this was the reason, though another possible\r\nexplanation did come into my mind. I had refused to be duly overcome by\r\nher charms, not because I was unimpressed, for who could be, having\r\nlooked upon that blinding beauty even for a moment? but rather because,\r\nafter sundry experiences, I had at last attained to some power of\r\njudgment and learned what it is best to leave alone. Perhaps this had\r\nannoyed her, especially as no white man seemed to have come her way for\r\na long while and the fabulous Kallikrates had not put in his promised\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nAlso it was unfortunate that in one way or another—how did she do it, I\r\nwondered—she had interpreted Umslopogaas’ question to me about marrying\r\nher, and my compromising reply. Not that for one moment, as I saw very\r\nclearly, did she wish to marry me. But that fact, intuition suggested\r\nto my mind, did not the least prevent her from being angry because I\r\nshared her views upon this important subject.\r\n\r\nOh! the whole thing was a bore and the sooner I saw the last of that\r\nveiled lady and the interesting but wearisome ruins in which she dwelt,\r\nthe better I should be pleased, although apparently I must trek\r\nhomewards with a poor young woman who was out of her mind, leaving the\r\nbones of her unfortunate father behind me. I admitted to myself,\r\nhowever, that there were consolations in the fact that Providence had\r\nthus decreed, for Robertson since he gave up drink had not been a\r\ncheerful companion, and two mad people would really have been more than\r\nI could manage.\r\n\r\nTo return, for these reasons I examined the two wounded Zulus with\r\nconsiderable anxiety, only to discover another instance of the\r\nchicanery which it amused this Ayesha to play off upon me. For what did\r\nI find? That they were practically well. Their hurts, which had never\r\nbeen serious, had healed wonderfully in that pure air, as those of\r\nsavages have a way of doing, and they told me themselves that they felt\r\nquite strong again. Yet with colossal impudence Ayesha had managed to\r\nsuggest to my mind that she was going to work some remarkable cure upon\r\nthem, who were already cured.\r\n\r\nWell, it was of a piece with the rest of her conduct and there was\r\nnothing to do except go to bed, which I did with much gratitude that my\r\nresting place that night was not of another sort. The last thing I\r\nremember was wondering how on earth Ayesha appeared and disappeared in\r\nthe course of that battle, a problem as to which I could find no\r\nsolution, though, as in the case of the others, I was sure that one\r\nwould occur to me in course of time.\r\n\r\nI slept like a top, so soundly indeed that I think there was some kind\r\nof soporific in the pick-me-up which looked like sherry, especially as\r\nthe others who had drunk of it also passed an excellent night.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o’clock on the following morning I awoke feeling particularly\r\nwell and quite as though I had been enjoying a week at the seaside\r\ninstead of my recent adventures, which included an abominable battle\r\nand some agonising moments during which I thought that my number was up\r\nupon the board of Destiny.\r\n\r\nI spent the most of that day lounging about, eating, talking over the\r\ndetails of the battle with Umslopogaas and the Zulus and smoking more\r\nthan usual. (I forgot to say that these Amahagger grew some capital\r\ntobacco of which I had obtained a supply, although like most Africans,\r\nthey only used it in the shape of snuff.) The truth was that after all\r\nmy marvellings and acute anxieties, also mental and physical exertions,\r\nI felt like the housemaid who caused to be cut upon her tombstone that\r\nshe had gone to a better land where her ambition was to do nothing “for\r\never and ever.” I just wanted to be completely idle and vacuous-minded\r\nfor at least a month, but as I knew that all I could expect in that\r\nline was a single bank holiday, like a City clerk on the spree, of it I\r\ndetermined to make the most.\r\n\r\nThe result was that before the evening I felt very bored indeed. I had\r\ngone to look at Inez, who was still fast asleep, as Ayesha said would\r\nbe the case, but whose features seemed to have plumped up considerably.\r\nThe reason of this I gathered from her Amahagger nurses, was that at\r\ncertain intervals she had awakened sufficiently to swallow considerable\r\nquantities of milk, or rather cream, which I hoped would not make her\r\nill. I had chatted with the wounded Zulus, who were now walking about,\r\nmore bored even than I was myself, and heaping maledictions on their\r\nancestral spirits because they had not been well enough to take part in\r\nthe battle against Rezu.\r\n\r\nI even took a little stroll to look for Hans, who had vanished in his\r\nmysterious fashion, but the afternoon was so hot and oppressive with\r\ncoming thunder, that soon I came back again and fell into a variety of\r\nreflections that I need not detail.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus engaged and meditating, not without uneasiness, upon\r\nthe ordeal that lay before me after sunset, for I felt sure that it\r\nwould be an ordeal, Hans appeared and said that the Amahagger _impi_ or\r\narmy was gathered on that spot where I had been elected to the proud\r\nposition of their General. He added that he believed—how he got this\r\ninformation I do not know—that the White Lady was going to hold a\r\nreview of them and give them the rewards that they had earned in the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nHearing this, Umslopogaas and the other Zulus said that they would like\r\nto see this review if I would accompany them. Although I did not want\r\nto go nor indeed desired ever to look at another Amahagger, I consented\r\nto save the trouble of argument, on condition that we should do so from\r\na distance.\r\n\r\nSo, including the wounded men, we strolled off and presently came to\r\nthe crumbled wall of the old city, beyond which lay the great moat now\r\ndry, that once had encircled it with water.\r\n\r\nHere on the top of this wall we sat down where we could see without\r\nbeing seen, and observed the Amahagger companies, considerably reduced\r\nduring the battle, being marshalled by their captains beneath us and\r\nabout a couple of hundred yards away. Also we observed several groups\r\nof men under guard. These we took to be prisoners captured in the fight\r\nwith Rezu, who, as Hans remarked with a smack of his lips, were\r\nprobably awaiting sacrifice.\r\n\r\nI said I hoped not and yawned, for really the afternoon was intensely\r\nhot and the weather most peculiar. The sun had vanished behind clouds,\r\nand vapours filled the still air, so dense that at times it grew almost\r\ndark; also when these cleared for brief intervals, the landscape in the\r\ngrey, unholy light looked distorted and unnatural, as it does during an\r\neclipse of the sun.\r\n\r\nGoroko, the witch-doctor, stared round him, sniffed the air and then\r\nremarked ocularly that it was “wizard’s weather” and that there were\r\nmany spirits about. Upon my word I felt inclined to agree with him, for\r\nmy feelings were very uncomfortable, but I only replied that if so, I\r\nshould be obliged if he, as a professional, would be good enough to\r\nkeep them off me. Of course I knew that electrical charges were about,\r\nwhich accounted for my sensations, and wished that I had never left the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nIt was during one of these periods of dense gloom that Ayesha must have\r\narrived upon the review ground. At least, when it lifted, there she was\r\nin her white garments, surrounded by women and guards, engaged\r\napparently in making an oration, for although I could not hear a word,\r\nI could see by the motions of her arms that she was speaking.\r\n\r\nHad she been the central figure in some stage scene, no limelights\r\ncould have set her off to better advantage, than did those of the\r\nheavens above her. Suddenly, through the blanket of cloud, flowing from\r\na hole in it that looked like an eye, came a blood-red ray which fell\r\nfull upon her, so that she alone was fiercely visible whilst all around\r\nwas gloom in which shapes moved dimly. Certainly she looked strange and\r\neven terrifying in that red ray which stained her robe till I who had\r\nbut just come out of battle with its “confused noise,” began to think\r\nof “the garments rolled in blood” of which I often read in my favourite\r\nOld Testament. For crimson was she from head to foot; a tall shape of\r\nterror and of wrath.\r\n\r\nThe eye in heaven shut and the ray went out. Then came one of the\r\nspaces of grey light and in it I saw men being brought up, apparently\r\nfrom the groups of prisoners, under guard, and, to the number of a\r\ndozen or more, stood in a line before Ayesha.\r\n\r\nThen I saw nothing more for a long while, because blackness seemed to\r\nflow in from every quarter of the heavens and to block out the scene\r\nbeneath. At least after a pause of perhaps five minutes, during which\r\nthe stillness was intense, the storm broke.\r\n\r\nIt was a very curious storm; in all my experience of African tempests I\r\ncannot recall one which it resembled. It began with the usual cold and\r\nwailing wind. This died away, and suddenly the whole arch of heaven was\r\nalive with little lightnings that seemed to strike horizontally, not\r\ndownwards to the earth, weaving a web of fire upon the surface of the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nBy the illumination of these lightnings which, but for the swiftness of\r\ntheir flashing and greater intensity, somewhat resembled a dense shower\r\nof shooting stars, I perceived that Ayesha was addressing the men that\r\nhad been brought before her, who stood dejectedly in a long line with\r\ntheir heads bent, quite unattended, since their guards had fallen back.\r\n\r\n“If I were going to receive a reward of cattle or wives, I should look\r\nhappier than those moon-worshippers, Baas,” remarked Hans reflectively.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it would depend,” I answered, “upon what the cattle and wives\r\nwere like. If the cattle had red-water and would bring disease into\r\nyour herd, or wild bulls that would gore you, and the wives were skinny\r\nold widows with evil tongues, then I think you would look as do those\r\nmen, Hans.”\r\n\r\nI don’t quite know what made me speak thus, but I believe it was some\r\nsense of pending death or disaster, suggested, probably, by the ominous\r\ncharacter of the setting provided by Nature to the curious drama of\r\nwhich we were witnesses.\r\n\r\n“I never thought of that, Baas,” commented Hans, “but it is true that\r\nall gifts are not good, especially witches’ gifts.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the little net-like lightnings died away, leaving behind\r\nthem a gross darkness through which, far above us, the wind wailed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly all the heaven was turned into one blaze of light, and by\r\nit I saw Ayesha standing tall and rigid with her hand pointed towards\r\nthe line of men in front of her. The blaze went out, to be followed by\r\nblackness, and to return almost instantly in a yet fiercer blaze which\r\nseemed to fall earthwards in a torrent of fire that concentrated itself\r\nin a kind of flame-spout upon the spot where Ayesha stood.\r\n\r\nThrough that flame or rather in the heart of it, I saw Ayesha and the\r\nfile of men in front of her, as the great King saw the prophets in the\r\nmidst of the furnace that had been heated sevenfold. Only these men did\r\nnot walk about in the fire; no, they fell backwards, while Ayesha alone\r\nremained upon her feet with outstretched hand.\r\n\r\nNext came more blackness and crash upon crash of such thunder that the\r\nearth shook as it reverberated from the mountain cliffs. Never in my\r\nlife did I hear such fearful thunder. It frightened the Zulus so much,\r\nthat they fell upon their faces, except Goroko and Umslopogaas, whose\r\npride kept them upon their feet, the former because he had a reputation\r\nto preserve as a “Heaven-herd,” or Master of tempests.\r\n\r\nI confess that I should have liked to follow their example, and lie\r\ndown, being dreadfully afraid lest the lightning should strike me. But\r\nthere—I did not.\r\n\r\nAt last the thunder died away and in the most mysterious fashion that\r\nviolent tempest came to a sudden end, as does a storm upon the stage.\r\nNo rain fell, which in itself was surprising enough and most unusual,\r\nbut in place of it a garment of the completest calm descended upon the\r\nearth. By degrees, too, the darkness passed and the westering sun\r\nreappeared. Its rays fell upon the place where the Amahagger companies\r\nhad stood, but now not one of them was to be seen.\r\n\r\nThey were all gone and Ayesha with them. So completely had they\r\nvanished away that I should have thought that we suffered from\r\nillusions, were it not for the line of dead men which lay there looking\r\nvery small and lonesome on the veld; mere dots indeed at that distance.\r\n\r\nWe stared at each other and at them, and then Goroko said that he would\r\nlike to inspect the bodies to learn whether lightning killed at Kôr as\r\nit did elsewhere, also whether it had smitten them altogether or leapt\r\nfrom man to man. This, as a professional “Heaven-herd,” he declared he\r\ncould tell from the marks upon these unfortunates.\r\n\r\nAs I was curious also and wanted to make a few observations, I\r\nconsented. So with the exception of the wounded men, who I thought\r\nshould avoid the exertion, we scrambled down the débris of the tumbled\r\nwall and across the open space beyond, reaching the scene of the\r\ntragedy without meeting or seeing anyone.\r\n\r\nThere lay the dead, eleven of them, in an exact line as they had stood.\r\nThey were all upon their backs with widely-opened eyes and an\r\nexpression of great fear frozen upon their faces. Some of these I\r\nrecognised, as did Umslopogaas and Hans. They were soldiers or captains\r\nwho had marched under me to attack Rezu, although until this moment I\r\nhad not seen any of them after we began to descend the ridge where the\r\nbattle took place.\r\n\r\n“Baas,” said Hans, “I believe that these were the traitors who slipped\r\naway and told Rezu of our plans so that he attacked us on the ridge,\r\ninstead of our attacking him on the plain as we had arranged so nicely.\r\nAt least they were none of them in the battle and afterwards I heard\r\nthe Amahagger talking of some of them.”\r\n\r\nI remarked that if so the lightning had discriminated very well in this\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Goroko was examining the bodies one by one, and presently\r\ncalled out,\r\n\r\n“These doomed ones died not by lightning but by witchcraft. There is\r\nnot a burn upon one of them, nor are their garments scorched.”\r\n\r\nI went to look and found that it was perfectly true; to all outward\r\nappearance the eleven were quite unmarked and unharmed. Except for\r\ntheir frightened air, they might have died a natural death in their\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n“Does lightning always scorch?” I asked Goroko.\r\n\r\n“Always, Macumazahn,” he answered, “that is, if he who has been struck\r\nis killed, as these are, and not only stunned. Moreover, most of yonder\r\ndead wear knives which should have melted or shattered with the sheaths\r\nburnt off them. Yet those knives are as though they had just left the\r\nsmith’s hammer and the whet-stone,” and he drew some of them to show\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAgain it was quite true and here I may remark that my experience\r\ntallied with that of Goroko, since I have never seen anyone killed by\r\nlightning on whom or on whose clothing there was not some trace of its\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n“_Ow!_” said Umslopogaas, “this is witchcraft, not Heaven-wrath. The\r\nplace is enchanted. Let us get away lest we be smitten also who have\r\nnot earned doom like those traitors.”\r\n\r\n“No need to fear,” said Hans, “since with us is the Great Medicine of\r\nZikali which can tie up the lightning as an old woman does a bundle of\r\nsticks.”\r\n\r\nStill I observed that for all his confidence, Hans himself was the\r\nfirst to depart and with considerable speed. So we went back to our\r\ncamp without more conversation, since the Zulus were scared and I\r\nconfess that myself I could not understand the matter, though no doubt\r\nit admitted of some quite simple explanation.\r\n\r\nHowever that might be, this Kôr was a queer place with its legends, its\r\nsullen Amahagger and its mysterious queen, to whom at times, in spite\r\nof my inner conviction to the contrary, I was still inclined to\r\nattribute powers beyond those that are common even among very beautiful\r\nand able women.\r\n\r\nThis reflection reminded me that she had promised us a further\r\nexhibition of those powers and within an hour or two. Remembering this\r\nI began to regret that I had ever asked for any such manifestations,\r\nfor who knew what these might or might not involve?\r\n\r\nSo much did I regret it that I determined, unless Ayesha sent for us,\r\nas she had said she would do, I would conveniently forget the\r\nappointment. Luckily Umslopogaas seemed to be of the same way of\r\nthinking; at any rate he went off to eat his evening meal without\r\nalluding to it at all. So I made up my mind that I would not bring the\r\nmatter to his notice and having ascertained that Inez was still asleep,\r\nI followed his example and dined myself, though without any particular\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nAs I finished the sun was setting in a perfectly clear sky, so as there\r\nwas no sign of any messenger, I thought that I would go to bed early,\r\nleaving orders that I was not to be disturbed. But on this point my\r\nluck was lacking, for just as I had taken off my coat, Hans arrived and\r\nsaid that old Billali was without and had come to take me somewhere.\r\n\r\nWell, there was nothing to do but to put it on again. Before I had\r\nfinished this operation Billali himself arrived with undignified and\r\nunusual haste. I asked him what was the matter, and he answered\r\ninconsequently that the Black One, the slayer of Rezu, was at the door\r\n“with his axe.”\r\n\r\n“That generally accompanies him,” I replied. Then, remembering the\r\ncause of Billali’s alarm, I explained to him that he must not take too\r\nmuch notice of a few hasty words spoken by an essentially\r\ngentle-natured person whose nerve had given way beneath provocation and\r\nbodily effort. The old fellow bowed in assent and stroked his beard,\r\nbut I noticed that while Umslopogaas was near, he clung to me like a\r\nshadow. Perhaps he thought that nervous attacks might be recurrent,\r\nlike those of fever.\r\n\r\nOutside the house I found Umslopogaas leaning on his axe and looking at\r\nthe sky in which the last red rays of evening lingered.\r\n\r\n“The sun has set, Macumazahn,” he said, “and it is time to visit this\r\nwhite queen as she bade us, and to learn whether she can indeed lead us\r\n‘down below’ where the dead are said to dwell.”\r\n\r\nSo he had not forgotten, which was disconcerting. To cover up my own\r\ndoubts I asked him with affected confidence and cheerfulness whether he\r\nwas not afraid to risk this journey “down below,” that is, to the Realm\r\nof Death.\r\n\r\n“Why should I fear to tread a road that awaits the feet of all of us\r\nand at the gate of which we knock day by day, especially if we chance\r\nto live by war, as do you and I, Macumazahn?” he inquired with a quiet\r\ndignity, which made me feel ashamed.\r\n\r\n“Why indeed?” I answered, adding to myself, “though I should much\r\nprefer any other highway.”\r\n\r\nAfter this we started without more words, I keeping up my spirits by\r\nreflecting that the whole business was nonsense and that there could be\r\nnothing to dread.\r\n\r\nAll too soon we passed the ruined archway and were admitted into\r\nAyesha’s presence in the usual fashion. As Billali, who remained\r\noutside of them, drew the curtains behind us, I observed, to my\r\nastonishment, that Hans had sneaked in after me, and squatted down\r\nquite close to them, apparently in the hope of being overlooked.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, as I gathered later, that somehow or other he had guessed,\r\nor become aware of the object of our visit, and that his burning\r\ncuriosity had overcome his terror of the “White Witch.” Or possibly he\r\nhoped to discover whether or not she were so ugly as he supposed her\r\nveil-hidden face to be. At any rate there he was, and if Ayesha noticed\r\nhim, as I think she did, for I saw by the motion of her head, that she\r\nwas looking in his direction, she made no remark.\r\n\r\nFor a while she sat still in her chair contemplating us both. Then she\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n“How comes it that you are late? Those that seek their lost loves\r\nshould run with eager feet, but yours have tarried.”\r\n\r\nI muttered some excuse to which she did not trouble to listen, for she\r\nwent on,\r\n\r\n“I think, Allan, that your sandals, which should be winged like to\r\nthose of the Roman Mercury, are weighted with the grey lead of fear.\r\nWell, it is not strange, since you have come to travel through the\r\nGates of Death that are feared by all, even by Ayesha’s self, for who\r\nknows what he may find beyond them? Ask the Axe-Bearer if he also is\r\nafraid.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed, rendering all that she had said into the Zulu idiom as best I\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n“Say to the Queen,” answered Umslopogaas, when he understood, “that I\r\nfear nothing, except women’s tongues. I am ready to pass the Gates of\r\nDeath and, if need be, to come back no more. With the white people I\r\nknow it is otherwise because of some dark teachings to which they\r\nlisten, that tell of terrors to be, such as we who are black do not\r\ndread. Still, we believe that there are ghosts and that the spirits of\r\nour fathers live on and as it chances I would learn whether this is so,\r\nwho above all things desire to met a certain ghost, for which reason I\r\njourneyed to this far land.\r\n\r\n“Say these things to the white Queen, Macumazahn, and tell her that if\r\nshe should send me to a place whence there is no return, I who do not\r\nlove the world, shall not blame her overmuch, though it is true that I\r\nshould have chosen to die in war. Now I have spoken.”\r\n\r\nWhen I had passed on all this speech to Ayesha, her comment on it was,\r\n\r\n“This black Captain has a spirit as brave as his body, but how is it\r\nwith your spirit, Allan? Are you also prepared to risk so much? Learn\r\nthat I can promise you nothing, save that when I loose the bonds of\r\nyour mortality and send out your soul to wander in the depths of Death,\r\nas I believe that I can do, though even of this I am not certain—you\r\nmust pass through a gate of terrors that may be closed behind you by a\r\nstronger arm than mine. Moreover, what you will find beyond it I do not\r\nknow, since be sure of this, each of us has his own heaven or his own\r\nhell, or both, that soon or late he is doomed to travel. Now will you\r\ngo forward, or go back? Make choice while there is still time.”\r\n\r\nAt all this ominous talk I felt my heart shrivel like a fire-withered\r\nleaf, if I may use that figure, and my blood assume the temperature and\r\nconsistency of ice-cream. Earnestly did I curse myself for having\r\nallowed my curiosity about matters which we are not meant to understand\r\nto bring me to the edge of such a choice. Swiftly I determined to\r\ntemporise, which I did by asking Ayesha whether she would accompany me\r\nupon this eerie expedition.\r\n\r\nShe laughed a little as she answered,\r\n\r\n“Bethink you, Allan. Am I, whose face you have seen, a meet companion\r\nfor a man who desires to visit the loves that once were his? What would\r\nthey say or think, if they should see you hand in hand with such a\r\none?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and don’t care,” I replied desperately, “but this is the\r\nkind of journey on which one requires a guide who knows the road.\r\nCannot Umslopogaas go first and come back to tell me how it has fared\r\nwith him?”\r\n\r\n“If the brave and instructed white lord, panoplied in the world’s last\r\nFaith, is not ashamed to throw the savage in his ignorance out like a\r\nfeather to test the winds of hell and watch the while to learn whether\r\nthese blow him back unscorched, or waft him into fires whence there is\r\nno return, perchance it might so be ordered, Allan. Ask him yourself,\r\nAllan, if he is willing to run this errand for your sake. Or perhaps\r\nthe little yellow man——” and she paused.\r\n\r\nAt this point Hans, who having a smattering of Arabic understood\r\nsomething of our talk, could contain himself no longer.\r\n\r\n“No, Baas,” he broke in from his corner by the curtain, “not _me_. I\r\ndon’t care for hunting spooks, Baas, which leave no spoor that you can\r\nfollow and are always behind when you think they are in front. Also\r\nthere are too many of them waiting for me down there and how can I\r\nstand up to them until I am a spook myself and know their ways of\r\nfighting? Also if you should die when your spirit is away, I want to be\r\nleft that I may bury you nicely.”\r\n\r\n“Be silent,” I said in my sternest manner. Then, unable to bear more of\r\nAyesha’s mockery, for I felt that as usual she was mocking me, I added\r\nwith all the dignity that I could command,\r\n\r\n“I am ready to make this journey through the gate of Death, Ayesha, if\r\nindeed you can show me the road. For one purpose and no other I came to\r\nKôr, namely to learn, if so I might, whether those who have died upon\r\nthe world, live on elsewhere. Now, what must I do?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nTHE LESSON\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Ayesha, laughing very softly, “for that purpose alone,\r\nO truth-seeking Allan, whose curiosity is so fierce that the wide world\r\ncannot hold it, did you come to Kôr and not to seek wealth or new\r\nlands, or to fight more savages. No, not even to look upon a certain\r\nAyesha, of whom the old wizard told you, though I think you have always\r\nloved to try to lift the veil that hides women’s hearts, if not their\r\nfaces. Yet it was I who brought you to Kôr for my own purposes, not\r\nyour desire, nor Zikali’s map and talisman, since had not the white\r\nlady who lies sick been stolen by Rezu, never would you have pursued\r\nthe journey nor found the way hither.”\r\n\r\n“How could you have had anything to do with that business?” I asked\r\ntestily, for my nerves were on edge and I said the first thing that\r\ncame into my mind.\r\n\r\n“That, Allan, is a question over which you will wonder for a long while\r\neither beneath or beyond the sun, as you will wonder concerning much\r\nthat has to do with me, which your little mind, shut in its iron box of\r\nignorance and pride, cannot understand to-day.\r\n\r\n“For example, you have been wondering, I am sure, how the lightning\r\nkilled those eleven men whose bodies you went to look on an hour or two\r\nago, and left the rest untouched. Well, I will tell you at once that it\r\nwas not lightning that killed them, although the strength within me was\r\nmanifest to you in storm, but rather what that witch-doctor of your\r\nfollowing called wizardry. Because they were traitors who betrayed your\r\narmy to Rezu, I killed them with my wrath and by the wand of my power.\r\nOh! you do not believe, yet perhaps ere long you will, since thus to\r\nfulfil your prayer I must also kill you—almost. That is the trouble,\r\nAllan. To kill you outright would be easy, but to kill you just enough\r\nto set your spirit free and yet leave one crevice of mortal life\r\nthrough which it can creep back again, that is most difficult; a thing\r\nthat only I can do and even of myself I am not sure.”\r\n\r\n“Pray do not try the experiment——” I began thoroughly alarmed, but she\r\ncut me short.\r\n\r\n“Disturb me no more, Allan, with the tremors and changes of your\r\nuncertain mind, lest you should work more evil than you think, and\r\nmaking mine uncertain also, spoil my skill. Nay, do not try to fly, for\r\nalready the net has thrown itself about you and you cannot stir, who\r\nare bound like a little gilded wasp in the spider’s web, or like birds\r\nbeneath the eyes of basilisks.”\r\n\r\nThis was true, for I found that, strive as I would, I could not move a\r\nlimb or even an eyelid. I was frozen to that spot and there was nothing\r\nfor it except to curse my folly and say my prayers.\r\n\r\nAll this while she went on talking, but of what she said I have not the\r\nfaintest idea, because my remaining wits were absorbed in these\r\nmuch-needed implorations.\r\n\r\nPresently, of a sudden, I appeared to see Ayesha seated in a temple,\r\nfor there were columns about her, and behind her was an altar on which\r\na fire burned. All round her, too, were hooded snakes like to that\r\nwhich she wore about her middle, fashioned in gold. To these snakes she\r\nsang and they danced to her singing; yes, with flickering tongues they\r\ndanced upon their tails! What the scene signified I cannot conceive,\r\nunless it meant that this mistress of magic was consulting her\r\nfamiliars.\r\n\r\nThen that vision vanished and Ayesha’s voice began to seem very far\r\naway and dreamy, also her wondrous beauty became visible to me through\r\nher veil, as though I had acquired a new sense that overcame the\r\nlimitations of mortal sight. Even in this extremity I reflected it was\r\nwell that the last thing I looked on should be something so glorious.\r\nNo, not quite the last thing, for out of the corners of my eyes I saw\r\nthat Umslopogaas from a sitting position had sunk on to his back and\r\nlay, apparently dead, with his axe still gripped tightly and held above\r\nhis head, as though his arm had been turned to ice.\r\n\r\nAfter this terrible things began to happen to me and I became aware\r\nthat I was dying. A great wind seemed to catch me up and blow me to and\r\nfro, as a leaf is blown in the eddies of a winter gale. Enormous rushes\r\nof darkness flowed over me, to be succeeded by vivid bursts of\r\nbrightness that dazzled like lightning. I fell off precipices and at\r\nthe foot of them was caught by some fearful strength and tossed to the\r\nvery skies.\r\n\r\nFrom those skies I was hurled down again into a kind of whirlpool of\r\ninky night, round which I spun perpetually, as it seemed for hours and\r\nhours. But worst of all was the awful loneliness from which I suffered.\r\nIt seemed to me as though there were no other living thing in all the\r\nUniverse and never had been and never would be any other living thing.\r\nI felt as though _I_ were the Universe rushing solitary through space\r\nfor ages upon ages in a frantic search for fellowship, and finding\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nThen something seemed to grip my throat and I knew that I had died—for\r\nthe world floated away from beneath me.\r\n\r\nNow fear and every mortal sensation left me, to be replaced by a new\r\nand spiritual terror. I, or rather my disembodied consciousness, seemed\r\nto come up for judgment, and the horror of it was that I appeared to be\r\nmy own judge. There, a very embodiment of cold justice, my Spirit,\r\ngrown luminous, sat upon a throne and to it, with dread and merciless\r\nparticularity I set out all my misdeeds. It was as if some part of me\r\nremained mortal, for I could see my two eyes, my mouth and my hands,\r\nbut nothing else—and strange enough they looked. From the eyes came\r\ntears, from the mouth flowed words and the hands were joined, as though\r\nin prayer to that throned and adamantine Spirit which was ME.\r\n\r\nIt was as though this Spirit were asking how my body had served its\r\npurposes and advanced its mighty ends, and in reply—oh! what a\r\nmiserable tale I had to tell. Fault upon fault, weakness upon weakness,\r\nsin upon sin; never before did I understand how black was my record. I\r\ntried to relieve the picture with some incidents of attempted good, but\r\nthat Spirit would not hearken. It seemed to say that it had gathered up\r\nthe good and knew it all. It was of the evil that it would learn, not\r\nof the good that had bettered it, but of the evil by which it had been\r\nharmed.\r\n\r\nHearing this there rose up in my consciousness some memory of what\r\nAyesha had said; namely, that the body lived within the temple of the\r\nspirit which is oft defied, and not the spirit in the body.\r\n\r\nThe story was told and I hearkened for the judgment, my own judgment on\r\nmyself, which I knew would be accepted without question and registered\r\nfor good or ill. But none came, since ere the balance sank this way or\r\nthat, ere it could be uttered, I was swept afar.\r\n\r\nThrough Infinity I was swept, and as I fled faster than the light, the\r\nmeaning of what I had seen came home to me. I knew, or seemed to know\r\nfor the first time, that at the last _man must answer to himself_, or\r\nperhaps to a divine principle within himself, that out of his own\r\nfree-will, through long æons and by a million steps, he climbs or sinks\r\nto the heights or depths dormant in his nature; that from what he was,\r\nsprings what he is, and what he is, engenders what he shall be for ever\r\nand aye.\r\n\r\nNow I envisaged Immortality and splendid and awful was its face. It\r\nclasped me to its breast and in the vast circle of its arms I was\r\nup-borne, I who knew myself to be without beginning and without end,\r\nand yet of the past and of the future knew nothing, save that these\r\nwere full of mysteries.\r\n\r\nAs I went I encountered others, or overtook them, making the same\r\njourney. Robertson swept past me, and spoke, but in a tongue I could\r\nnot understand. I noted that the madness had left his eyes and that his\r\nfine-cut features were calm and spiritual. The other wanderers I did\r\nnot know.\r\n\r\nI came to a region of blinding light; the thought rose in me that I\r\nmust have reached the sun, or a sun, though I felt no heat. I stood in\r\na lovely, shining valley about which burned mountains of fire. There\r\nwere huge trees in that valley, but they glowed like gold and their\r\nflowers and fruit were as though they had been fashioned of\r\nmany-coloured flames.\r\n\r\nThe place was glorious beyond compare, but very strange to me and not\r\nto be described. I sat me down upon a boulder which burned like a ruby,\r\nwhether with heat or colour I do not know, by the edge of a stream that\r\nflowed with what looked like fire and made a lovely music. I stooped\r\ndown and drank of this water of flames and the scent and the taste of\r\nit were as those of the costliest wine.\r\n\r\nThere, beneath the spreading limbs of a fire-tree I sat, and examined\r\nthe strange flowers that grew around, coloured like rich jewels and\r\nperfumed above imagining. There were birds also which might have been\r\nfeathered with sapphires, rubies and amethysts, and their song was so\r\nsweet that I could have wept to hear it. The scene was wonderful and\r\nfilled me with exaltation, for I thought of the land where it is\r\npromised that there shall be no more night.\r\n\r\nPeople began to appear; men, women, and even children, though whence\r\nthey came I could not see. They did not fly and they did not walk; they\r\nseemed to drift towards me, as unguided boats drift upon the tide. One\r\nand all they were very beautiful, but their beauty was not human\r\nalthough their shapes and faces resembled those of men and women made\r\nglorious. None were old, and except the children, none seemed very\r\nyoung; it was as though they had grown backwards or forwards to middle\r\nlife and rested there at their very best.\r\n\r\nNow came the marvel; all these uncounted people were known to me,\r\nthough so far as my knowledge went I had never set eyes on most of them\r\nbefore. Yet I was aware that in some forgotten life or epoch I had been\r\nintimate with every one of them; also that it was the fact of my\r\npresence and the call of my sub-conscious mind which drew them to this\r\nspot. Yet that presence and that call were not visible or audible to\r\nthem, who, I suppose, flowed down some stream of sympathy, why or\r\nwhither they did not know. Had I been as they were perchance they would\r\nhave seen me, as it was they saw nothing and I could not speak and tell\r\nthem of my presence.\r\n\r\nSome of this multitude, however, I knew well enough even when they had\r\ndeparted years and years ago. But about these I noted this, that every\r\none of them was a man or a woman or a child for whom I had felt love or\r\nsympathy or friendship. Not one was a person whom I had disliked or\r\nwhom I had no wish to see again. If they spoke at all I could not\r\nhear—or read—their speech, yet to a certain extent I could hear their\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nMany of these were beyond the power of my appreciation on subjects of\r\nwhich I had no knowledge, or that were too high for me, but some were\r\nof quite simple things such as concern us upon the earth, such as of\r\nfriendship, or learning, or journeys made or to be made, or art, or\r\nliterature, or the wonders of Nature, or of the fruits of the earth, as\r\nthey knew them in this region.\r\n\r\nThis I noted too, that each separate thought seemed to be hallowed and\r\nenclosed in an atmosphere of prayer or heavenly aspiration, as a seed\r\nis enclosed in the heart of a flower, or a fruit in its odorous rind,\r\nand that this prayer or aspiration presently appeared to bear the\r\nthought away, whither I knew not. Moreover, all these thoughts, even of\r\nthe humblest things, were beauteous and spiritual, nothing cruel or\r\nimpure or even coarse was to be found among them: they radiated\r\ncharity, purity and goodness.\r\n\r\nAmong them I perceived were none that had to do with our earth; this\r\nand its affairs seemed to be left far behind these thinkers, a truth\r\nthat chilled my soul was alien to their company. Worse still, so far as\r\nI could discover, although I knew that all these bright ones had been\r\nnear to me at some hour in the measurements of time and space, not one\r\nof their musings dwelt upon me or on aught with which I had to do.\r\n\r\nBetween me and them there was a great gulf fixed and a high wall built.\r\n\r\nOh, look! One came shining like a star, and from far away came another\r\nwith dove-like eyes and beautiful exceedingly, and with this last a\r\nmaiden, whose eyes were as hers who my own heart told me was her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nWell, I knew them both; they were those whom I had come to seek, the\r\nwomen who had been mine upon the earth, and at the sight of them my\r\nspirit thrilled. Surely they would discover me. Surely at least they\r\nwould speak of me and feel my presence.\r\n\r\nBut, although they stayed within a pace or two of where I rested, alas!\r\nit was not so. They seemed to kiss and to exchange swift thoughts about\r\nmany things, high things of which I will not write, and common things;\r\nyes, even of the shining robes they wore, but never a one of _me!_ I\r\nstrove to rise and go to them, but could not; I strove to speak and\r\ncould not; I strove to throw out my thought to them and could not; it\r\nfell back upon my head like a stone hurled heavenward.\r\n\r\nThey were remote from me, utterly apart. I wept tears of bitterness\r\nthat I should be so near and yet so far; a dull and jealous rage burned\r\nin my heart, and this they did seem to feel, or so I fancied; at any\r\nrate, apparently by mutual consent, they moved further from me as\r\nthough something pained them. Yes, my love could not reach their\r\nperfected natures, but my anger hurt them.\r\n\r\nAs I sat chewing this root of bitterness, a man appeared, a very noble\r\nman, in whom I recognised my father grown younger and happier-looking,\r\nbut still my father, with whom came others, men and women whom I knew\r\nto be my brothers and sisters who had died in youth far away in\r\nOxfordshire. Joy leapt up in me, for I thought—these will surely know\r\nme and give me welcome, since, though here sex has lost its power,\r\nblood must still call to blood.\r\n\r\nBut it was not so. They spoke, or interchanged their thoughts, but not\r\none of me. I read something that passed from my father to them. It was\r\na speculation as to what had brought them all together there, and read\r\nalso the answer hazarded, that perhaps it might be to give welcome to\r\nsome unknown who was drawing near from below and would feel lonely and\r\nunfriended. Thereon my father replied that he did not see or feel this\r\nwanderer, and thought that it could not be so, since it was his mission\r\nto greet such on their coming.\r\n\r\nThen in an instant all were gone and that lovely, glowing plain was\r\nempty, save for myself seated on the ruby-like stone, weeping tears of\r\nblood and shame and loss within my soul.\r\n\r\nSo I sat a long while, till presently I was aware of a new presence, a\r\npresence dusky and splendid and arrayed in rich barbaric robes.\r\nStraight she came towards me, like a thrown spear, and I knew her for a\r\ncertain royal and savage woman who on earth was named Mameena, or\r\n“Wind-that-wailed.” Moreover she divined me, though see me she could\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n“Art there, Watcher-in-the-Night, watching in the light?” she said or\r\nthought, I know not which, but the words came to me in the Zulu tongue.\r\n\r\n“Aye,” she went on, “I know that thou art there; from ten thousand\r\nleagues away I felt thy presence and broke from my own place to welcome\r\nthee, though I must pay for it with burning chains and bondage. How did\r\nthose welcome thee whom thou camest out to seek? Did they clasp thee in\r\ntheir arms and press their kisses on thy brow? Or did they shrink away\r\nfrom thee because the smell of earth was on thy hands and lips?”\r\n\r\nI seemed to answer that they did not appear to know that I was there.\r\n\r\n“Aye, they did not know because their love is not enough, because they\r\nhave grown too fine for love. But I, the sinner, I knew well, and here\r\nam I ready to suffer all for thee and to give thee place within this\r\nstormy heart of mine. Forget them, then, and come to rule with me who\r\nstill am queen in my own house that thou shalt share. There we will\r\nlive royally and when our hour comes, at least we shall have had our\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nNow before I could reply, some power seemed to seize this splendid\r\ncreature and whirl her thence so that she departed, flashing these\r\nwords from her mind to mine,\r\n\r\n“For a little while farewell, but remember always that Mameena, the\r\nWailing Wind, being still as a sinful woman in a woman’s love and of\r\nthe earth, earthy, found thee, whom all the rest forgot. O\r\nWatcher-in-the-Night, watch in the night for me, for there thou shalt\r\nfind me, the Child of Storm, again, and yet again.”\r\n\r\nShe was gone and once more I sat in utter solitude upon that ruby\r\nstone, staring at the jewelled flowers and the glorious flaming trees\r\nand the lambent waters of the brook. What was the meaning of it all, I\r\nwondered, and why was I deserted by everyone save a single savage\r\nwoman, and why had she a power to find me which was denied to all the\r\nrest? Well, she had given me an answer, because she was “as a sinful\r\nwoman with a woman’s love and of the earth, earthy,” while with the\r\nrest it was otherwise. Oh! this was clear, that in the heavens man has\r\nno friend among the heavenly, save perhaps the greatest Friend of all\r\nWho understands both flesh and spirit.\r\n\r\nThus I mused in this burning world which was still so beautiful, this\r\nalien world into which I had thrust myself unwanted and unsought. And\r\nwhile I mused this happened. The fiery waters of the stream were\r\ndisturbed by something and looking up I saw the cause.\r\n\r\nA dog had plunged into them and was swimming towards me. At a glance I\r\nknew that dog on which my eyes had not fallen for decades. It was a\r\nmongrel, half spaniel and half bull-terrier, which for years had been\r\nthe dear friend of my youth and died at last on the horns of a wounded\r\nwildebeeste that attacked me when I had fallen from my horse upon the\r\nveld. Boldly it tackled the maddened buck, thus giving me time to\r\nscramble to my rifle and shoot it, but not before the poor hound had\r\nyielded its life for mine, since presently it died disembowelled, but\r\nlicking my hand and forgetful of its agonies. This dog, Smut by name,\r\nit was that swam or seemed to swim the brook of fire. It scrambled to\r\nthe hither shore, it nosed the earth and ran to the ruby stone and\r\nstared about it whining and sniffing.\r\n\r\nAt last it seemed to see or feel me, for it stood upon its hind legs\r\nand licked my face, yelping with mad joy, as I could see though I heard\r\nnothing. Now I wept in earnest and bent down to hug and kiss the\r\nfaithful beast, but this I could not do, since like myself it was only\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly all dissolved in a cataract of many-coloured flames and I\r\nfell down into an infinite gulf of blackness.\r\n\r\nSurely Ayesha was talking to me! What did she say? What did she say? I\r\ncould not catch her words, but I caught her laughter and knew that\r\nafter her fashion she was making a mock of me. My eyelids were dragged\r\ndown as though with heavy sleep; it was difficult to lift them. At last\r\nthey were open and I saw Ayesha seated on her couch before me and—this\r\nI noted at once—with her lovely face unveiled. I looked about me,\r\nseeking Umslopogaas and Hans. But they were gone as I guessed they must\r\nbe, since otherwise Ayesha would not have been unveiled. We were quite\r\nalone. She was addressing me and in a new fashion, since now she had\r\nabandoned the formal “you” and was using the more impressive and\r\nintimate “thou,” much as is the manner of the French.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast made thy journey, Allan,” she said, “and what thou hast seen\r\nthere thou shalt tell me presently. Yet from thy mien I gather\r\nthis—that thou art glad to look upon flesh and blood again and, after\r\nthe company of spirits, to find that of mortal woman. Come then and sit\r\nbeside me and tell thy tale.”\r\n\r\n“Where are the others?” I asked as I rose slowly to obey, for my head\r\nswam and my feet seemed feeble.\r\n\r\n“Gone, Allan, who as I think have had enough of ghosts, which is\r\nperhaps thy case also. Come, drink this and be a man once more. Drink\r\nit to me whose skill and power have brought thee safe from lands that\r\nhuman feet were never meant to tread,” and taking a strange-shaped cup\r\nfrom a stool that stood beside her, she offered it to me.\r\n\r\nI drank to the last drop, neither knowing nor caring whether it were\r\nwine or poison, since my heart seemed desperate at its failure and my\r\nspirit crushed beneath the weight of its great betrayal. I suppose it\r\nwas the former, for the contents of that cup ran through my veins like\r\nfire and gave me back my courage and the joy of life.\r\n\r\nI stepped to the dais and sat me down upon the couch, leaning against\r\nits rounded end so that I was almost face to face with Ayesha who had\r\nturned towards me, and thence could study her unveiled loveliness. For\r\na while she said nothing, only eyed me up and down and smiled and\r\nsmiled, as though she were waiting for that wine to do its work with\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Now that thou art a man again, Allan, tell me what thou didst see when\r\nthou wast more—or less—than man.”\r\n\r\nSo I told her all, for some power within her seemed to draw the truth\r\nout of me. Nor did the tale appear to cause her much surprise.\r\n\r\n“There is truth in thy dream,” she said when I had finished; “a lesson\r\nalso.”\r\n\r\n“Then it was all a dream?” I interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Is not everything a dream, even life itself, Allan? If so, what can\r\nthis be that thou hast seen, but a dream within a dream, and itself\r\ncontaining other dreams, as in the old days the ball fashioned by the\r\neastern workers of ivory would oft be found to contain another ball,\r\nand this yet another and another and another, till at the inmost might\r\nbe found a bead of gold, or perchance a jewel, which was the prize of\r\nhim who could draw out ball from ball and leave them all unbroken. That\r\nsearch was difficult and rarely was the jewel come by, if at all, so\r\nthat some said there was none, save in the maker’s mind. Yes, I have\r\nseen a man go crazed with seeking and die with the mystery unsolved.\r\nHow much harder, then, is it to come at the diamond of Truth which lies\r\nat the core of all our nest of dreams and without which to rest upon\r\nthey could not be fashioned to seem realities?”\r\n\r\n“But was it really a dream, and if so, what were the truth and the\r\nlesson?” I asked, determined not to allow her to bemuse or escape me\r\nwith her metaphysical talk and illustrations.\r\n\r\n“The first question has been answered, Allan, as well as I can answer,\r\nwho am not the architect of this great globe of dreams, and as yet\r\ncannot clearly see the ineffable gem within, whose prisoned rays\r\nilluminate their substance, though so dimly that only those with the\r\ninsight of a god can catch their glamour in the night of thought, since\r\nto most they are dark as glow-flies in the glare of noon.”\r\n\r\n“Then what are the truth and the lesson?” I persisted, perceiving that\r\nit was hopeless to extract from her an opinion as to the real nature of\r\nmy experiences and that I must content myself with her deductions from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Thou tellest me, Allan, that in thy dream or vision thou didst seem to\r\nappear before thyself seated on a throne and in that self to find thy\r\njudge. That is the Truth whereof I spoke, though how it found its way\r\nthrough the black and ignorant shell of one whose wit is so small, is\r\nmore than I can guess, since I believed that it was revealed to me\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n(Now I, Allan, thought to myself that I began to see the origin of all\r\nthese fantasies and that for once Ayesha had made a slip. If she had a\r\ntheory and I developed that same theory in a hypnotic condition, it was\r\nnot difficult to guess its fount. However, I kept my mouth shut, and\r\nluckily for once she did not seem to read my mind, perhaps because she\r\nwas too much occupied in spinning her smooth web of entangling words.)\r\n\r\n“All men worship their own god,” she went on, “and yet seem not to know\r\nthat this god dwells within them and that of him they are a part. There\r\nhe dwells and there they mould him to their own fashion, as the potter\r\nmoulds his clay, though whatever the shape he seems to take beneath\r\ntheir fingers, still he remains the god infinite and unalterable. Still\r\nhe is the Seeker and the Sought, the Prayer and its Fulfilment, the\r\nLove and the Hate, the Virtue and the Vice, since all these qualities\r\nthe alchemy of his spirit turns into an ultimate and eternal Good. For\r\nthe god is in all things and all things are in the god, whom men clothe\r\nwith such diverse garments and whose countenance they hide beneath so\r\nmany masks.\r\n\r\n“In the tree flows the sap, yet what knows the great tree it nurtures\r\nof the sap? In the world’s womb burns the fire that gives life, yet\r\nwhat of the fire knows the glorious earth it conceived and will\r\ndestroy; in the heavens the great globes swing through space and rest\r\nnot, yet what know they of the Strength that sent them spinning and in\r\na time to come will stay their mighty motions, or turn them to another\r\ncourse? Therefore of everything this all-present god is judge, or\r\nrather, not one but many judges, since of each living creature he makes\r\nits own magistrate to deal out justice according to that creature’s law\r\nwhich in the beginning the god established for it and decreed. Thus in\r\nthe breast of everyone there is a rule and by that rule, at work\r\nthrough a countless chain of lives, in the end he shall be lifted up to\r\nHeaven, or bound about and cast down to Hell and death.”\r\n\r\n“You mean a conscience,” I suggested rather feebly, for her thoughts\r\nand images overpowered me.\r\n\r\n“Aye, a conscience, if thou wilt, and canst only understand that term,\r\nthough it fits my theme but ill. This is my meaning, that consciences,\r\nas thou namest them, are many. I have one; thou, Allan, hast another;\r\nthat black Axe-bearer has a third; the little yellow man a fourth, and\r\nso on through the tale of living things. For even a dog such as thou\r\nsawest has a conscience and—like thyself or I—must in the end be its\r\nown judge, because of the spark that comes to it from above, the same\r\nspark which in me burns as a great fire, and in thee as a smouldering\r\nember of green wood.”\r\n\r\n“When _you_ sit in judgment on yourself in a day to come, Ayesha,” I\r\ncould not help interpolating, “I trust that you will remember that\r\nhumility did not shine among your virtues.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled in her vivid way—only twice or thrice did I see her smile\r\nthus and then it was like a flash of summer lightning illumining a\r\nclouded sky, since for the most part her face was grave and even\r\nsombre.\r\n\r\n“Well answered,” she said. “Goad the patient ox enough and even it will\r\ngrow fierce and paw the ground.\r\n\r\n“Humility! What have I to do with it, O Allan? Let humility be the part\r\nof the humble-souled and lowly, but for those who reign as I do, and\r\nthey are few indeed, let there be pride and the glory they have earned.\r\nNow I have told thee of the Truth thou sawest in thy vision and wouldst\r\nthou hear the Lesson?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “since I may as well be done with it at once, and\r\ndoubtless it will be good for me.”\r\n\r\n“The Lesson, Allan, is one which thou preachest—humility. Vain man and\r\nfoolish as thou art, thou didst desire to travel the Underworld in\r\nsearch of certain ones who once were all in all to thee—nay, not all in\r\nall since of them there were two or more—but at least much. Thus thou\r\nwouldst do because, as thou saidest, thou didst seek to know whether\r\nthey still lived on beyond the gates of Blackness. Yes, thou saidest\r\nthis, but what thou didst hope to learn in truth was whether they lived\r\non in _thee_ and for _thee_ only. For thou, thou in thy vanity, didst\r\npicture these departed souls as doing naught in that Heaven they had\r\nwon, save think of thee still burrowing on the earth, and, at times\r\nlightening thy labours with kisses from other lips than theirs.”\r\n\r\n“Never!” I exclaimed indignantly. “Never! it is not true.”\r\n\r\n“Then I pray pardon, Allan, who only judged of thee by others that were\r\nas men are made, and being such, not to be blamed if perchance from\r\ntime to time, they turned to look on women, who alas! were as they are\r\nmade. So at least it was when I knew the world, but mayhap since then\r\nits richest wine has turned to water, whereby I hope it has been\r\nbettered. At the least this was thy thought, that those women who had\r\nbeen thine for an hour, through all eternity could dream of naught else\r\nsave thy perfections, and hope for naught else than to see thee at\r\ntheir sides through that eternity, or such part of thee as thou couldst\r\nspare to each of them. For thou didst forget that where they have gone\r\nthere may be others even more peerless than thou art and more fit to\r\nhold a woman’s love, which as we know on earth was ever changeful, and\r\nperhaps may so remain where it is certain that new lights must shine\r\nand new desires beckon. Dost understand me, Allan?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” I answered with a groan. “I understand you to mean that\r\nworldly impressions soon wear out and that people who have departed to\r\nother spheres may there form new ties and forget the old.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Allan, as do those who remain upon this earth, whence these\r\nothers have departed. Do men and women still re-marry in the world,\r\nAllan, as in my day they were wont to do?”\r\n\r\n“Of course—it is allowed.”\r\n\r\n“As many other things, or perchance this same thing, may be allowed\r\nelsewhere, for when there are so many habitations from which to choose,\r\nwhy should we always dwell in one of them, however strait the house or\r\npoor the prospect?”\r\n\r\nNow understanding that I was symbolised by the “strait house” and the\r\n“poor prospect” I should have grown angry, had not a certain sense of\r\nhumour come to my rescue, who remembered that after all Ayesha’s satire\r\nwas profoundly true. Why, beyond the earth, should anyone desire to\r\nremain unalterably tied to and inextricably wrapped up in such a\r\npersonality as my own, especially if others of superior texture\r\nabounded about them? Now that I came to think of it, the thing was\r\nabsurd and not to be the least expected in the midst of a thousand new\r\nand vivid interests. I had met with one more disillusionment, that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“Dost understand, Allan,” went on Ayesha, who evidently was determined\r\nthat I should drink this cup to the last drop, “that these dwellers in\r\nthe sun, or the far planet where thou hast been according to thy tale,\r\nsaw thee not and knew naught of thee? It may chance therefore that at\r\nthis time thou wast not in their minds which at others dream of thee\r\ncontinually. Or it may chance that they never dream of thee at all,\r\nhaving quite forgotten thee, as the weaned cub forgets its mother.”\r\n\r\n“At least there was one who seemed to remember,” I exclaimed, for her\r\npoisoned mocking stung the words out of me, “one woman and—a dog.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, the savage, who being Nature’s child, a sinner that departed\r\nhence by her own act” (how Ayesha knew this I cannot say, I never told\r\nher), “has not yet put on perfection and therefore still remembers him\r\nwhose kiss was last upon her lips. But surely, Allan, it is not thy\r\ndesire to pass from the gentle, ordered claspings of those white souls\r\nfor the tumultuous arms of such a one as this. Still, let that be, for\r\nwho knows what men will or will not do in jealousy and disappointed\r\nlove? And the dog, it remembered also and even sought thee out, since\r\ndogs are more faithful and single-hearted than is mankind. There at\r\nleast thou hast thy lesson, namely to grow more humble and never to\r\nthink again that thou holdest all a woman’s soul for aye, because once\r\nshe was kind to thee for a little while on earth.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, jumping up in a rage, “as you say, I have my lesson,\r\nand more of it than I want. So by your leave, I will now bid you\r\nfarewell, hoping that when it comes to be _your_ turn to learn this\r\nlesson, or a worse, Ayesha, as I am sure it will one day, for something\r\ntells me so, you may enjoy it more than I have done.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nAYESHA’S FAREWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nThus I spoke whose nerves were on edge after all that I had seen or, as\r\neven then I suspected, seemed to see. For how could I believe that\r\nthese visions of mine had any higher origin than Ayesha’s rather\r\nmalicious imagination? Already I had formed my theory.\r\n\r\nIt was that she must be a hypnotist of power, who, after she had put a\r\nspell upon her subject, could project into his mind such fancies as she\r\nchose together with a selection of her own theories. Only two points\r\nremained obscure. The first was—how did she get the necessary\r\ninformation about the private affairs of a humble individual like\r\nmyself, for these were not known even to Zikali with whom she seemed to\r\nbe in some kind of correspondence, or to Hans, at any rate in such\r\ncompleteness?\r\n\r\nI could but presume that in some mysterious way she drew them from, or\r\nrather excited them in my own mind and memory, so that I seemed to see\r\nthose with whom once I had been intimate, with modifications and in\r\nsurroundings that her intelligence had carefully prepared. It would not\r\nbe difficult for a mind like hers familiar, as I gathered it was, with\r\nthe ancient lore of the Greeks and the Egyptians, to create a kind of\r\nHades and, by way of difference, to change it from one of shadow to one\r\nof intense illumination, and into it to plunge the consciousness of him\r\nupon whom she had laid her charm of sleep. I had seen nothing and heard\r\nnothing that she might not thus have moulded, always given that she had\r\naccess to the needful clay of facts which I alone could furnish.\r\n\r\nGranting this hypothesis, the second point was—what might be the object\r\nof her elaborate and most bitter jest? Well, I thought that I could\r\nguess. First, she wished to show her power, or rather to make me\r\nbelieve that she had power of a very unusual sort. Secondly, she owed\r\nUmslopogaas and myself a debt for our services in the war with Rezu\r\nwhich we had been told would be repaid in this way. Thirdly, I had\r\noffended her in some fashion and she took her opportunity of settling\r\nthe score. Also there was a fourth possibility—that really she\r\nconsidered herself a moral instructress and desired, as she said, to\r\nteach me a lesson by showing how futile were human hopes and vanities\r\nin respect to the departed and their affections.\r\n\r\nNow I do not pretend that all this analysis of Ayesha’s motives\r\noccurred to me at the moment of my interview with her; indeed, I only\r\ncompleted it later after much careful thought, when I found it sound\r\nand good. At that time, although I had inklings, I was too bewildered\r\nto form a just judgment.\r\n\r\nFurther, I was too angry and it was from this bow of my anger that I\r\nloosed a shaft at a venture as to some lesson which awaited _her_.\r\nPerhaps certain words spoken by the dying Rezu had shaped that shaft.\r\nOr perhaps some shadow of her advancing fate fell upon me.\r\n\r\nThe success of the shot, however, was remarkable. Evidently it pierced\r\nthe joints of her harness, and indeed went home to Ayesha’s heart. She\r\nturned pale; all the peach-bloom hues faded from her lovely face, her\r\ngreat eyes seemed to lessen and grow dull and her cheeks to fall in.\r\nIndeed, for a moment she looked old, very old, quite an aged woman.\r\nMoreover she wept, for I saw two big tears drop upon her white raiment\r\nand I was horrified.\r\n\r\n“What has happened to you?” I said, or rather gasped.\r\n\r\n“Naught,” she answered, “save that thou hast hurt me sore. Dost thou\r\nnot know, Allan, that it is cruel to prophesy ill to any, since such\r\nwords feathered from Fate’s own wing and barbed with venom, fester in\r\nthe breast and mayhap bring about their own accomplishment. Most cruel\r\nof all is it when with them are repaid friendship and gentleness.”\r\n\r\nI reflected to myself—yes, friendship of the order that is called\r\ncandid, and gentleness such as is hid in a cat’s velvet paw, but\r\ncontented myself with asking how it was that she who said she was so\r\npowerful, came to fear anything at all.\r\n\r\n“Because as I have told thee, Allan, there is no armour that can turn\r\nthe spear of Destiny which, when I heard those words of thine, it\r\nseemed to me, I know not why, was directed by thy hand. Look now on\r\nRezu who thought himself unconquerable and yet was slain by the black\r\nAxe-bearer and whose bones to-night stay the famine of the jackals.\r\nMoreover I am accursed who sought to steal its servant from Heaven to\r\nbe my love, and how know I when and where vengeance will fall at last?\r\nIndeed, it has fallen already on me, who through the long ages amid\r\nsavages must mourn widowed and alone, but not all of it—oh! I think,\r\nnot all.”\r\n\r\nThen she began to weep in good earnest, and watching her, for the first\r\ntime I understood that this glorious creature who seemed to be so\r\npowerful, was after all one of the most miserable of women and as much\r\na prey to loneliness, every sort of passion and apprehensive fear, as\r\ncan be any common mortal. If, as she said, she had found the secret of\r\nlife, which of course I did not believe, at least it was obvious that\r\nshe had lost that of happiness.\r\n\r\nShe sobbed softly and wept and while she did so the loveliness, which\r\nhad left her for a little while, returned to her like light to a grey\r\nand darkened sky. Oh, how beautiful she seemed with the abundant locks\r\nin disorder over her tear-stained face, how beautiful beyond imagining!\r\nMy heart melted as I studied her; I could think of nothing else except\r\nher surpassing charm and glory.\r\n\r\n“I pray you, do not weep,” I said; “it hurts me and indeed I am sorry\r\nif I said anything to give you pain.”\r\n\r\nBut she only shook that glorious hair further about her face and behind\r\nits veil wept on.\r\n\r\n“You know, Ayesha,” I continued, “you have said many hard things to me,\r\nmaking me the target of your bitter wit, therefore it is not strange\r\nthat at last I answered you.”\r\n\r\n“And hast thou not deserved them, Allan?” she murmured in soft and\r\nbroken tones from behind that veil of scented locks.\r\n\r\n“Why?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Because from the beginning thou didst defy me, showing in thine every\r\naccent that thou heldest me a liar and one of no account in body or in\r\nspirit, one not worthy of thy kind look, or of those gentle words which\r\nonce were my portion among men. Oh! thou hast dealt hardly with me and\r\ntherefore perchance—I know not—I paid thee back with such poor weapons\r\nas a woman holds, though all the while I liked thee well.”\r\n\r\nThen again she fell to sobbing, swaying herself gently to and fro in\r\nher sweet sorrow.\r\n\r\nIt was too much. Not knowing what else to do to comfort her, I patted\r\nher ivory hand which lay upon the couch beside me, and as this appeared\r\nto have no effect, I kissed it, which she did not seem to resent. Then\r\nsuddenly I remembered and let it fall.\r\n\r\nShe tossed back her hair from her face and fixing her big eyes on me,\r\nsaid gently enough, looking down at her hand,\r\n\r\n“What ails thee, Allan?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing,” I answered; “only I remembered the story you told me\r\nabout some man called Kallikrates.”\r\n\r\nShe frowned.\r\n\r\n“And what of Kallikrates, Allan? Is it not enough that for my sins,\r\nwith tears, empty longings and repentance, I must wait for him through\r\nall the weary centuries? Must I also wear the chains of this\r\nKallikrates, to whom I owe many a debt, when he is far away? Say, didst\r\nthou see him in that Heaven of thine, Allan, for there perchance he\r\ndwells?”\r\n\r\nI shook my head and tried to think the thing out while all the time\r\nthose wonderful eyes of hers seemed to draw the soul from me. It seemed\r\nto me that she bent forward and held up her face to me. Then I lost my\r\nreason and also bent forward. Yes, she made me mad, and, save her, I\r\nforgot all.\r\n\r\nSwiftly she placed her hand upon my heart, saying,\r\n\r\n“Stay! What meanest thou? Dost love me, Allan?”\r\n\r\n“I think so—that is—yes,” I answered.\r\n\r\nShe sank back upon the couch away from me and began to laugh very\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n“What words are these,” she said, “that they pass thy lips so easily\r\nand so unmeant, perchance from long practice? Oh! Allan, I am\r\nastonished. Art thou the same man who some few days ago told me, and\r\nthis unasked, that as soon wouldst thou think of courting the moon as\r\nof courting me? Art thou he who not a minute gone swore proudly that\r\nnever had his heart and his lips wandered from certain angels whither\r\nthey should not? And now, and now——?”\r\n\r\nI coloured to my eyes and rose, muttering,\r\n\r\n“Let me be gone!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Allan, why? I see no mark here,” and she held up her hand,\r\nscanning it carefully. “Thou art too much what thou wert before, except\r\nperhaps in thy soul, which is invisible,” she added with a touch of\r\nmalice. “Nor am I angry with thee; indeed, hadst thou not tried to\r\ncharm away my woe, I should have thought but poorly of thee as a man.\r\nThere let it rest and be forgotten—or remembered as thou wilt. Still,\r\nin answer to thy words concerning my Kallikrates, what of those adored\r\nones that, according to thy tale, but now thou didst find again in a\r\nplace of light? Because they seemed faithless, shouldst thou be\r\nfaithless also? Shame on thee, thou fickle Allan!”\r\n\r\nShe paused, waiting for me to speak.\r\n\r\nWell, I could not. I had nothing to say who was utterly disgraced and\r\noverwhelmed.\r\n\r\n“Thou thinkest, Allan,” she went on, “that I have cast my net about\r\nthee, and this is true. Learn wisdom from it, Allan, and never again\r\ndefy a woman—that is, if she be fair, for then she is stronger than\r\nthou art, since Nature for its own purpose made her so. Whatever I have\r\ndone by tears, that ancient artifice of my sex, as in other ways, is\r\nfor thy instruction, Allan, that thou mayest benefit thereby.”\r\n\r\nAgain I sprang up, uttering an English exclamation which I trust Ayesha\r\ndid not understand, and again she motioned to me to be seated, saying,\r\n\r\n“Nay, leave me not yet since, even if the light fancy of a man that\r\ncomes and goes like the evening wind and for a breath made me dear to\r\nthee, has passed away, there remains certain work which we must do\r\ntogether. Although, thinking of thyself alone, thou hast forgotten it,\r\nhaving been paid thine own fee, one is yet due to that old wizard in a\r\nfar land who sent thee to visit Kôr and me, as indeed he has reminded\r\nme and within an hour.”\r\n\r\nThis amazing statement aroused me from my personal and painful\r\npre-occupation and caused me to stare at her blankly.\r\n\r\n“Again thou disbelievest me,” she said, with a little stamp. “Do so\r\nonce more, Allan, and I swear I’ll bring thee to grovel on the ground\r\nand kiss my foot and babble nonsense to a woman sworn to another man,\r\nsuch as never for all thy days thou shalt think of without a blush of\r\nshame.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no,” I broke in hurriedly, “I assure you that you are mistaken. I\r\nbelieve every word you have said, or say or will say; I do in truth.”\r\n\r\n“Now thou liest. Well, what is one more falsehood among so many? Let it\r\npass.”\r\n\r\n“What, indeed?” I echoed in eager affirmation, “and as for Zikali’s\r\nmessage——” and I paused.\r\n\r\n“It was to recall to my mind that he desired to learn whether a certain\r\ngreat enterprise of his will succeed, the details of which he says thou\r\ncanst tell me. Repeat them to me.”\r\n\r\nSo, glad enough to get away from more dangerous topics, I narrated to\r\nher as briefly and clearly as I could, the history of the old\r\nwitch-doctor’s feud with the Royal House of Zululand. She listened,\r\ntaking in every word, and said,\r\n\r\n“So now he yearns to know whether he will conquer or be conquered; and\r\nthat is why he sent, or thinks that he sent thee on this journey, not\r\nfor thy sake, Allan, but for his own. I cannot tell thee, for what have\r\nI do to with the finish of this petty business, which to him seems so\r\nlarge? Still, as I owe him a debt for luring the Axe-Bearer here to rid\r\nme of mine enemy, and thee to lighten my solitude for an hour by the\r\nburnishing of thy mind, I will try. Set that bowl before me, Allan,”\r\nand she pointed to a marble tripod on which stood a basin half full of\r\nwater, “and come, sit close by me and look into it, telling me what\r\nthou seest.”\r\n\r\nI obeyed her instructions and presently found myself with my head over\r\nthe basin, staring into the water in the exact attitude of a person who\r\nis about to be shampooed.\r\n\r\n“This seems rather foolish,” I said abjectly, for at that moment I\r\nresembled the Queen of Sheba in one particular, if in no other, namely,\r\nthat there was no more spirit in me. “What am I supposed to do? I see\r\nnothing at all.”\r\n\r\n“Look again,” she said, and as she spoke the water grew clouded. Then\r\non it appeared a picture. I saw the interior of a Kaffir hut dimly\r\nlighted by a single candle set in the neck of a bottle. To the left of\r\nthe door of the hut was a bedstead and on it lay stretched a wasted and\r\ndying man, in whom, to my astonishment, I recognised Cetywayo, King of\r\nthe Zulus. At the foot of the bed stood another man—myself grown older\r\nby many years, and leaning over the bed, apparently whispering into the\r\ndying man’s ear, was a grotesque and malevolent figure which I knew to\r\nbe that of Zikali, Opener-of-Roads, whose glowing eyes were fixed upon\r\nthe terrified and tortured face of Cetywayo. All was as it happened\r\nafterwards, as I have written down in the book called “Finished.”\r\n\r\nI described what I saw to Ayesha, and while I was doing so the picture\r\nvanished away, so that nothing remained save the clear water in the\r\nmarble bowl. The story did not seem to interest her; indeed, she leaned\r\nback and yawned a little.\r\n\r\n“Thy vision is good, Allan,” she said indifferently, “and wide also,\r\nsince thou canst see what passes in the sun or distant stars, and\r\npictures of things to be in the water, to say nothing of other pictures\r\nin a woman’s eyes, all within an hour. Well, this savage business\r\nconcerns me not and of it I want to know no more. Yet it would appear\r\nthat here the old wizard who is thy friend, has the answer that he\r\ndesires. For there in the picture the king he hates lies dying while he\r\nhisses in his ear and thou dost watch the end. What more can he seek?\r\nTell him it when ye meet, and tell him also it is my will that in\r\nfuture he should trouble me less, since I love not to be wakened from\r\nmy sleep to listen to his half-instructed talk and savage vapourings.\r\nIndeed, he presumes too much. And now enough of him and his dark plots.\r\nYe have your desires, all of you, and are paid in full.”\r\n\r\n“Over-paid, perhaps,” I said with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Allan, I think that Lesson thou hast learned pleases thee but\r\nlittle. Well, be comforted for the thing is common. Hast never heard\r\nthat there is but one morsel more bitter to the taste than desire\r\ndenied, namely, desire fulfilled? Believe me that there can be no\r\nhappiness for man until he attains a land where all desire is dead.”\r\n\r\n“That is what the Buddha preaches, Ayesha.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, I remember the doctrines of that wise man well, who without doubt\r\nhad found a key to the gate of Truth, one key only, for, mark thou,\r\nAllan, there are many. Yet, man being man must know desires, since\r\nwithout them, robbed of ambitions, strivings, hopes, fears, aye and of\r\nlife itself, the race must die, which is not the will of the Lord of\r\nLife who needs a nursery for his servant’s souls, wherein his swords of\r\nGood and Ill shall shape them to his pattern. So it comes about, Allan,\r\nthat what we think the worst is oft the best for us, and with that\r\nknowledge, if we are wise, let us assuage our bitterness and wipe away\r\nour tears.”\r\n\r\n“I have often thought that,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I doubt it not, Allan, since though it has pleased me to make a jest\r\nof thee, I know that thou hast thy share of wisdom, such little share\r\nas thou canst gather in thy few short years. I know, too, that thy\r\nheart is good and aspires high, and Friend—well, I find in thee a\r\nfriend indeed, as I think not for the first time, nor certainly for the\r\nlast. Mark, Allan, what I say, not a lover, but a _friend_, which is\r\nhigher far. For when passion dies with the passing of the flesh, if\r\nthere be no friendship what will remain save certain memories that,\r\nmayhap, are well forgot? Aye, how would those lovers meet elsewhere who\r\nwere never more than lovers? With weariness, I hold, as they stared\r\ninto each other’s empty soul, or even with disgust.\r\n\r\n“Therefore the wise will seek to turn those with whom Fate mates them\r\ninto friends, since otherwise soon they will be lost for aye. More, if\r\nthey are wiser still, having made them friends, they will suffer them\r\nto find lovers where they will. Good maxims, are they not? Yet hard to\r\nfollow, or so, perchance, thou thinkest them—as I do.”\r\n\r\nShe grew silent and brooded a while, resting her chin upon her hand and\r\nstaring down the hall. Thus the aspect of her face was different from\r\nany that I had seen it wear. No longer had it the allure of Aphrodite\r\nor the majesty of Hera; rather might it have been that of Athene\r\nherself. So wise it seemed, so calm, so full of experience and of\r\nforesight, that almost it frightened me.\r\n\r\nWhat was this woman’s true story, I wondered, what her real self, and\r\nwhat the sum of her gathered knowledge? Perhaps it was accident, or\r\nperhaps, again, she guessed my mind. At any rate her next words seemed\r\nin some sense an answer to these speculations. Lifting her eyes she\r\ncontemplated me a while, then said,\r\n\r\n“My friend, we part to meet no more in thy life’s day. Often thou wilt\r\nwonder concerning me, as to what in truth I am, and mayhap in the end\r\nthy judgment will be to write me down some false and beauteous wanderer\r\nwho, rejected of the world or driven from it by her crimes, made choice\r\nto rule among savages, playing the part of Oracle to that little\r\naudience and telling strange tales to such few travellers as come her\r\nway. Perhaps, indeed, I do play this part among many others, and if so,\r\nthou wilt not judge me wrongly.\r\n\r\n“Allan, in the old days, mariners who had sailed the northern seas,\r\ntold me that therein amidst mist and storm float mountains of ice, shed\r\nfrom dizzy cliffs which are hid in darkness where no sun shines. They\r\ntold me also that whereas above the ocean’s breast appears but a blue\r\nand dazzling point, sunk beneath it is oft a whole frozen isle,\r\ninvisible to man.\r\n\r\n“Such am I, Allan. Of my being thou seest but one little peak\r\nglittering in light or crowned with storm, as heaven’s moods sweep over\r\nit. But in the depths beneath are hid its white and broad foundations,\r\nhollowed by the seas of time to caverns and to palaces which my spirit\r\ndoth inhabit. So picture me, therefore, as wise and fair, but with a\r\nsoul unknown, and pray that in time to come thou mayest see it in its\r\nsplendour.\r\n\r\n“Hadst thou been other than thou art, I might have shown thee secrets,\r\nmaking clear to thee the parable of much that I have told thee in\r\nmetaphor and varying fable, aye, and given thee great gifts of power\r\nand enduring days of which thou knowest nothing. But of those who visit\r\nshrines, O Allan, two things are required, worship and faith, since\r\nwithout these the oracles are dumb and the healing waters will not\r\nflow.\r\n\r\n“Now I, Ayesha, am a shrine; yet to me thou broughtest no worship until\r\nI won it by a woman’s trick, and in me thou hast no faith. Therefore\r\nfor thee the oracle will not speak and the waters of deliverance will\r\nnot flow. Yet I blame thee not, who art as thou wast made and the hard\r\nworld has shaped thee.\r\n\r\n“And so we part: Think not I am far from thee because thou seest me not\r\nin the days to come, since like that Isis whose majesty alone I still\r\nexercise on earth, I, whom men name Ayesha, am in all things. I tell\r\nthee that I am not One but Many and, being many, am both Here and\r\nEverywhere. When thou standest beneath the sky at night and lookest on\r\nthe stars, remember that in them mine eyes behold thee; when the soft\r\nwinds of evening blow, that my breath is on thy brow and when the\r\nthunder rolls, that there am I riding on the lightnings and rushing\r\nwith the gale.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that you are the goddess Isis?” I asked, bewildered.\r\n“Because if so why did you tell me that you were but her priestess?”\r\n\r\n“Have it as thou wilt, Allan. All sounds do not reach thine ears; all\r\nsights are not open to thy eyes and therefore thou art both half deaf\r\nand blind. Perchance now that her shrines are dust and her worship is\r\nforgot, some spark of the spirit of that immortal Lady whose chariot\r\nwas the moon, lingers on the earth in this woman’s shape of mine,\r\nthough her essence dwells afar, and perchance her other name is Nature,\r\nmy mother and thine, O Allan. At the least hath not the World a\r\nsoul—and of that soul am I not mayhap a part, aye, and thou also? For\r\nthe rest are not the priest and the Divine he bows to, oft the same?”\r\n\r\nIt was on my lips to answer, Yes, if the priest is a knave or a\r\nself-deceiver, but I did not.\r\n\r\n“Farewell, Allan, and let Ayesha’s benison go with thee. Safe shalt\r\nthou reach thy home, for all is prepared to take thee hence, and thy\r\ncompanions with thee. Safe shalt thou live for many a year, till thy\r\ntime comes, and then, perchance, thou wilt find those whom thou hast\r\nlost more kind than they seemed to be to-night.”\r\n\r\nShe paused awhile, then added,\r\n\r\n“Hearken unto my last word! As I have said, much that I have told thee\r\nmay bear a double meaning, as is the way of parables, to be interpreted\r\nas thou wilt. Yet one thing is true. I love a certain man, in the old\r\ndays named Kallikrates, to whom alone I am appointed by a divine\r\ndecree, and I await him here. Oh, shouldest thou find him in the world\r\nwithout, tell him that Ayesha awaits him and grows weary in the\r\nwaiting. Nay, thou wilt never find him, since even if he be born again,\r\nby what token would he be known to thee? Therefore I charge thee, keep\r\nmy secrets well, lest Ayesha’s curse should fall on thee. While thou\r\nlivest tell naught of me to the world thou knowest. Dost thou swear to\r\nkeep my secrets, Allan?”\r\n\r\n“I swear, Ayesha.”\r\n\r\n“I thank thee, Allan,” she answered, and grew silent for a while.\r\n\r\nAt length Ayesha rose and drawing herself up to the full of her height,\r\nstood there majestic. Next she beckoned to me to come near, for I too\r\nhad risen and left the dais.\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and bending down she held her hands over me as though in\r\nblessing, then pointed towards the curtains which at this moment were\r\ndrawn asunder, by whom I do not know.\r\n\r\nI went and when I reached them, turned to look my last on her.\r\n\r\nThere she stood as I had left her, but now her eyes were fixed upon the\r\nground and her face once more was brooding absently as though no such a\r\nman as I had ever been. It came into my mind that already she had\r\nforgotten me, the plaything of an hour, who had served her turn and\r\nbeen cast aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nWHAT UMSLOPOGAAS SAW\r\n\r\n\r\nLike one who dreams I passed down the outer hall where stood the silent\r\nguards as statues might, and out through the archway. Here I paused for\r\na moment, partly to calm my mind in the familiar surroundings of the\r\nnight, and partly because I thought that I heard someone approaching me\r\nthrough the gloom, and in such a place where I might have many enemies,\r\nit was well to be prepared.\r\n\r\nAs it chanced, however, my imaginary assailant was only Hans, who\r\nemerged from some place where he had been hiding; a very disturbed and\r\nfrightened Hans.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Baas,” he said in a low and shaky whisper, “I am glad to see you\r\nagain, and standing on your feet, not being carried with them sticking\r\nstraight in front of you as I expected.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Baas, because of the things that happened in that place where the\r\ntall _vrouw_ with her head tied up as though she had tooth-ache, sits\r\nlike a spider in a web.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what happened, Hans?” I asked as we walked forward.\r\n\r\n“This, Baas. The Doctoress talked and talked at you and Umslopogaas,\r\nand as she talked, your faces began to look as though you had drunk\r\nhalf a flask too much of the best gin, such as I wish I had some of\r\nhere to-night, at once wise and foolish, and full and empty, Baas. Then\r\nyou both rolled over and lay there quite dead, and whilst I was\r\nwondering what I should do and how I should get out your bodies to bury\r\nthem, the Doctoress came down off her platform and bent, first over you\r\nand next over Umslopogaas, whispering into the ears of both of you.\r\nThen she took off a snake that looked as though it were made of gold\r\nwith green eyes, which she wears about her middle beneath the long\r\ndish-cloth, Baas, and held it to your lips and next to those of\r\nUmslopogaas.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and what then, Hans?”\r\n\r\n“After that all sorts of things came about, Baas, and I felt as though\r\nthe whole house were travelling through the air, Baas, twice as fast as\r\na bullet does from a rifle. Suddenly, too, the room became filled with\r\nfire so hot that it scorched me, and so bright that it made my eyes\r\nwater, although they can look at the sun without winking. And, Baas,\r\nthe fire was full of spooks which walked around; yes, I saw some of\r\nthem standing on your head and stomach, Baas, also on that of\r\nUmslopogaas, whilst others went and talked to the white Doctoress as\r\nquietly as though they had met her in the market-place and wanted to\r\nsell her eggs or butter. Then, Baas, suddenly I saw your reverend\r\nfather, the Predikant, who looked as though he were red-hot, as\r\ndoubtless he is in the Place of Fires. I thought he came up to me,\r\nBaas, and said, ‘Get out of this, Hans. This is no place for a good\r\nHottentot like you, Hans, for here only the very best Christians can\r\nbear the heat for long.’\r\n\r\n“That finished me, Baas. I just answered that I handed you, the Baas\r\nAllan his son, over to his care, hoping that he would see that you did\r\nnot burn in that oven, whatever happened to Umslopogaas. Then I shut my\r\neyes and mouth and held my nose, and wriggled beneath those curtains as\r\na snake does, Baas, and ran down the hall and across the kraal-yard and\r\nthrough the archway out into the night, where I have been sitting\r\ncooling myself ever since, waiting for you to be carried away, Baas.\r\nAnd now you have come alive and with not even your hair burnt off,\r\nwhich shows how wonderful must be the Great Medicine of Zikali, Baas,\r\nsince nothing else could have saved you in that fire, no, not even your\r\nreverend father, the Predikant.”\r\n\r\n“Hans,” I said when he had finished, “you are a very wonderful fellow,\r\nfor you can get drunk on nothing at all. Please remember, Hans, that\r\nyou have been drunk to-night, yes, very drunk indeed, and never dare to\r\nrepeat anything that you thought you saw while you were drunk.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, I understand that I was drunk and already have forgotten\r\neverything. But, Baas, there is still a bottle full of brandy and if I\r\ncould have just one more tot I should forget _so_ much better!”\r\n\r\nBy now we had reached our camp and here I found Umslopogaas sitting in\r\nthe doorway and staring at the sky.\r\n\r\n“Good-evening to you, Umslopogaas,” I said in my most unconcerned\r\nmanner, and waited.\r\n\r\n“Good-evening, Watcher-by-Night, who I thought was lost in the night,\r\nsince in the end the night is stronger than any of its watchers.”\r\n\r\nAt this cryptic remark I looked bewildered but said nothing. At length\r\nUmslopogaas, whose nature, for a Zulu, was impulsive and lacking in the\r\nordinary native patience, asked,\r\n\r\n“Did you make a journey this evening, Macumazahn, and if so, what did\r\nyou see?”\r\n\r\n“Did you have a dream this evening, Umslopogaas?” I inquired by way of\r\nanswer, “and if so, what was it about? I thought that I saw you shut\r\nyour eyes in the House of the White One yonder, doubtless because you\r\nwere weary of talk which you did not understand.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, Macumazahn, as you suppose I grew weary of that talk which flowed\r\nfrom the lips of the White Witch like the music that comes from a\r\nlittle stream babbling over stones when the sun is hot, and being\r\nweary, I fell asleep and dreamed. What I dreamed does not much matter.\r\nIt is enough to say that I felt as though I were thrown through the air\r\nlike a stone cast from his sling by a boy who is set upon a stage to\r\nscare the birds out of a mealie garden. Further than any stone I went,\r\naye, further than a shooting star, till I reached a wonderful place. It\r\ndoes not much matter what it was like either, and indeed I am already\r\nbeginning to forget, but there I met everyone I have ever known. I met\r\nthe Lion of the Zulus, the Black One, the Earth-Shaker, he who had a\r\n‘sister’ named Baleka, which sister,” here he dropped his voice and\r\nlooked about him suspiciously, “bore a child, which child was fostered\r\nby one Mopo, that Mopo who afterwards slew the Black one with the\r\nPrinces. Now, Macumazahn, I had a score to settle with this Black One,\r\naye, even though our blood be much of the same colour, I had a score to\r\nsettle with him, because of the slaying of this sister of his, Baleka,\r\ntogether with the Langeni tribe.[1] So I walked up to him and took him\r\nby the head-ring and spat in his face and bade him find a spear and\r\nshield, and meet me as man to man. Yes, I did this.”\r\n\r\n [1] For the history of Baleka, the mother of Umslopogaas, and Mopo,\r\n see the book called “Nada the Lily.”—Editor.\r\n\r\n“And what happened then, Umslopogaas?” I said, when he paused in his\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n“Macumazahn, nothing happened at all. My hand seemed to go through his\r\nhead-ring and the skull beneath, and to shut upon itself while he went\r\non talking to someone else, a captain whom I recognised, yes, one Faku,\r\nwhom in the days of Dingaan, the Black One’s brother, I myself slew\r\nupon the Ghost-Mountain.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Macumazahn, and Faku was telling him the tale of how I killed him\r\nand of the fight that I and my blood-brother and the wolves made, there\r\non the knees of the old witch who sits aloft on the Ghost Mountain\r\nwaiting for the world to die, for I could understand their talk, though\r\nmine went by them like the wind.\r\n\r\n“Macumazahn, they passed away and there came others, Dingaan among\r\nthem, aye, Dingaan who also knows something of the Witch-Mountain,\r\nseeing that there Mopo and I hurled him to his death. With him also I\r\nwould have had words, but it was the same story, only presently he\r\ncaught sight of the Black One, yes, of Chaka whom he slew, stabbing him\r\nwith the little red assegai, and turned and fled, because in that land\r\nI think he still fears Chaka, Macumazahn, or so the dream told.\r\n\r\n“I went on and met others, men I had fought in my day, most of them,\r\namong them was Jikiza, he who ruled the People of the Axe before me\r\nwhom I slew with his own axe. I lifted the axe and made me ready to\r\nfight again, but not one of them took any note of me. There they walked\r\nabout, or sat drinking beer or taking snuff, but never a sup of the\r\nbeer or a pinch of the snuff did they offer me, no, not even those\r\namong them whom I chanced not to have killed. So I left them and walked\r\non, seeking for Mopo, my foster-father, and a certain man, my\r\nblood-brother, by whose side I hunted with the wolves, yes, for them,\r\nand for another.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and did you find them?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Mopo I found not, which makes me think, Macumazahn, that, as once you\r\nhinted to me, he whom I thought long dead, perchance still lingers on\r\nthe earth. But the others I did find . . .” and he ceased, brooding.\r\n\r\nNow I knew enough of Umslopogaas’s history to be aware that he had\r\nloved this man and woman of whom he spoke more than any others on the\r\nearth. The “blood-brother,” whose name he would not utter, by which he\r\ndid not mean that he was his brother in blood but one with whom he had\r\nmade a pact of eternal friendship by the interchange of blood or some\r\nsuch ceremony, according to report, had dwelt with him on the\r\nWitch-Mountain where legend told, though this I could scarcely believe,\r\nthat they had hunted with a pack of hyenas. There, it said also, they\r\nfought a great fight with a band send out by Dingaan the king under the\r\ncommand of that Faku whom Umslopogaas had mentioned, in which fight the\r\n“Blood-Brother,” wielder of a famous club known as\r\nWatcher-of-the-Fords, got his death after doing mighty deeds. There\r\nalso, as I had heard, Nada the Lily, whose beauty was still famous in\r\nthe land, died under circumstances strange as they were sad.\r\n\r\nNaturally, remembering my own experiences, or rather what seemed to be\r\nmy experiences, for already I had made up my mind that they were but a\r\ndream, I was most anxious to learn whether these two who had been so\r\ndear to this fierce Zulu, had recognised him.\r\n\r\n“Well, and what did they say to you, Umslopogaas?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Macumazahn, they said nothing at all. Hearken! There stood this pair,\r\nor sometimes they moved to and fro; my brother, an even greater man\r\nthan he used to be, with the wolfskin girt about him and the club,\r\nWatcher-of-the-Fords, which he alone could wield, upon his shoulder,\r\nand Nada, grown lovelier even than she was of old, so lovely,\r\nMacumazahn, that my heart rose into my throat when I saw her and\r\nstopped my breath. Yes, Macumazahn, there they stood, or walked about\r\narm in arm as lovers might, and looked into each other’s eyes and\r\ntalked of how they had known each other on the earth, for I could\r\nunderstand their words or thoughts, and how it was good to be at rest\r\ntogether where they were.”\r\n\r\n“You see, they were old friends, Umslopogaas,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Macumazahn, very old friends as I thought. So much so that they\r\nhad never had a word to say of me who also was the old friend of both\r\nof them. Aye, my brother, whose name I am sworn not to speak, the\r\nwoman-hater who vowed he loved nothing save me and the wolves, could\r\nsmile into the face of Nada the Lily, Nada the bride of my youth, yet\r\nnever a word of me, while she could smile back and tell him how great a\r\nwarrior he had been and never a word of me whose deeds she was wont to\r\npraise, who saved her in the Halakazi caves and from Dingaan; no, never\r\na word of me although I stood there staring at them.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose that they did not see you, Umslopogaas.”\r\n\r\n“That is so, Macumazahn; I am sure that they did not see me, for if\r\nthey had they would not have been so much at ease. But I saw them and\r\nas they would not take heed when I shouted, I ran up calling to my\r\nbrother to defend himself with his club. Then, as he still took no\r\nnote, I lifted the axe _Inkosikaas_, making it circle in the light, and\r\nsmote with all my strength.”\r\n\r\n“And what happened, Umslopogaas?”\r\n\r\n“Only this, Macumazahn, that the axe went straight through my brother\r\nfrom the crown of his head to the groin, cutting him in two, and he\r\njust went on talking! Indeed, he did more, for stooping down he\r\ngathered a white lily-bloom which grew there and gave it to Nada, who\r\nsmelt at it, smiled and thanked him, and then thrust it into her\r\ngirdle, still thanking him all the while. Yes, she did this for I saw\r\nit with my eyes, Macumazahn.”\r\n\r\nHere the Zulu’s voice broke and I think that he wept, for in the faint\r\nlight I saw him draw his long hand across his eyes, whereon I took the\r\nopportunity to turn my back and light a pipe.\r\n\r\n“Macumazahn,” he went on presently, “it seems that madness took hold of\r\nme for a long while, for I shouted and raved at them, thinking that\r\nwords and rage might hurt where good steel could not, and as I did so\r\nthey faded away and disappeared, still smiling and talking, Nada\r\nsmelling at the lily which, having a long stalk, rose up above her\r\nbreast. After this I rushed away and suddenly met that savage king,\r\nRezu, whom I slew a few days gone. At him I went with the axe,\r\nwondering whether he would put up a better fight this second time.”\r\n\r\n“And did he, Umslopogaas?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, but I think he felt me for he turned and fled and when I tried to\r\nfollow I could not see him. So I ran on and presently who should I find\r\nbut Baleka, Baleka, Chaka’s ‘sister’ who—repeat it not, Macumazahn—was\r\nmy mother; and, Macumazahn, _she_ saw me. Yes, though I was but little\r\nwhen last she looked on me who now am great and grim, she saw and knew\r\nme, for she floated up to me and smiled at me and seemed to press her\r\nlips upon my forehead, though I could feel no kiss, and to draw the\r\nsoreness out of my heart. Then she, too, was gone and of a sudden I\r\nfell down through space, having, I suppose, stepped into some deep\r\nhole, or perchance a well.\r\n\r\n“The next thing I knew was that I awoke in the house of the White Witch\r\nand saw you sleeping at my side and the Witch leaning back upon her bed\r\nand smiling at me through the thin blanket with which she covers\r\nherself up, for I could see the laughter in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Now I grew mad with her because of the things that I had seen in the\r\nPlace of Dreams, and it came into my heart that it would be well to\r\nkill her that the world might be rid of her and her evil magic which\r\ncan show lies to men. So, being distraught, I sprang up and lifted the\r\naxe and stepped towards her, whereon she rose and stood before me,\r\nlaughing out loud. Then she said something in the tongue I cannot\r\nunderstand, and pointed with her finger, and lo! next moment it was as\r\nif giants had seized me and were whirling me away, till presently I\r\nfound myself breathless but unharmed beyond the arch and—what does it\r\nall mean, Macumazahn?”\r\n\r\n“Very little, as I think, Umslopogaas, except that this queen has\r\npowers to which those of Zikali are as nothing, and can cause visions\r\nto float before the eyes of men. For know that such things as you saw,\r\nI saw, and in them those whom I have loved also seemed to take no\r\nthought of me but only to be concerned with each other. Moreover when I\r\nawoke and told this to the queen who is called She-who-commands, she\r\nlaughed at me as she did at you, and said that it was a good lesson for\r\nmy pride who in that pride had believed that the dead only thought of\r\nthe living. But I think that the lesson came from her who wished to\r\nhumble us, Umslopogaas, and that it was her mind that shaped these\r\nvisions which we saw.”\r\n\r\n“I think so too, Macumazahn, but how she knew of all the matters of\r\nyour life and mine, I do not know, unless perchance Zikali told them to\r\nher, speaking in the night-watches as wizards can.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Umslopogaas, I believe that by her magic she drew our stories out\r\nof our own hearts and then set them forth to us afresh, putting her own\r\ncolour on them. Also it may be that she drew something from Hans, and\r\nfrom Goroko and the other Zulus with you, and thus paid us the fee that\r\nshe had promised for our service, but in lung-sick oxen and barren\r\ncows, not in good cattle, Umslopogaas.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded and said,\r\n\r\n“Though at the time I seemed to go mad and though I know that women are\r\nfalse and men must follow where they lead them, never will I believe\r\nthat my brother, the woman-hater, and Nada are lovers in the land below\r\nand have there forgotten me, the comrade of one of them and the husband\r\nof the other. Moreover I hold, Macumazahn, that you and I have met with\r\na just reward for our folly.\r\n\r\n“We have sought to look through the bottom of the grave at things which\r\nthe Great-Great in Heaven above did not mean that men should see, and\r\nnow that we have seen we are unhappier than we were, since such dreams\r\nburn themselves upon the heart as a red-hot iron burns the hide of an\r\nox, so that the hair will never grow again where it has been and the\r\nhide is marred.\r\n\r\n“To you, Watcher-by-Night, I say, ‘Content yourself with your watching\r\nand whatever it may bring to you in fame and wealth.’ And to myself I\r\nsay, ‘Holder of the Axe, content yourself with the axe and what it may\r\nbring to you in fair fight and glory’; and to both of us I say, ‘Let\r\nthe Dead sleep unawakened until we go to join them, which surely will\r\nbe soon enough.’”\r\n\r\n“Good words, Umslopogaas, but they should have been spoken ere ever we\r\nset out on this journey.”\r\n\r\n“Not so, Macumazahn, since that journey we were fated to make to save\r\none who lies yonder, the Lady Sad-Eyes, and, as they tell me, is well\r\nagain. Also Zikali willed it, and who can resist the will of the\r\nOpener-of-Roads? So it is made and we have seen many strange things and\r\nwon some glory and come to know how deep is the pool of our own\r\nfoolishness, who thought that we could search out the secrets of Death,\r\nand there have only found those of a witch’s mind and venom, reflected\r\nas in water. And now having discovered all these things I wish to be\r\ngone from this haunted land. When do we march, Macumazahn?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow morning, I believe, if the Lady Sad-Eyes and the others are\r\nwell enough, as She-who-commands says they will be.”\r\n\r\n“Good. Then I would sleep who am more weary than I was after I had\r\nkilled Rezu in the battle on the mountain.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “since it is harder to fight ghosts than men, and\r\ndreams, if they be bad, are more dreadful than deeds. Good-night,\r\nUmslopogaas.”\r\n\r\nHe went, and I too went to see how it fared with Inez. I found that she\r\nwas fast asleep but in a quite different sleep to that into which\r\nAyesha seemed to have plunged her. Now it was absolutely natural and\r\nlooking at her lying there upon the bed, I thought how young and\r\nhealthy was her appearance. The women in charge of her also told me\r\nthat she had awakened at the hour appointed by She-who-commands, as it\r\nseemed, quite well and very hungry, although she appeared to be puzzled\r\nby her surroundings. After she had eaten, they added that she had “sung\r\na song,” which was probably a hymn, and prayed upon her knees, “making\r\nsigns upon her breast” and then gone quietly to bed.\r\n\r\nMy anxiety relieved as regards Inez, I returned to my own quarters. Not\r\nfeeling inclined for slumber, however, instead of turning in I sat at\r\nthe doorway contemplating the beauty of the night while I watched the\r\ncountless fireflies that seemed to dust the air with sparks of burning\r\ngold; also the great owls and other fowl that haunt the dark. These had\r\ncome out in numbers from their hiding-places among the ruins and sailed\r\nto and fro like white-winged spirits, now seen and now lost in the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nWhile I sat thus many reflections came to me as to the extraordinary\r\nnature of my experiences during the past few days. Had any man ever\r\nknown the like, I wondered? What could they mean and what could this\r\nmarvellous woman Ayesha be? Was she perhaps a personification of Nature\r\nitself, as indeed to some extent all women are? Was she human at all,\r\nor was she some spirit symbolising a departed people, faith and\r\ncivilisation, and haunting the ruins where once she reigned as queen?\r\nNo, the idea was ridiculous, since such beings do not exist, though it\r\nwas impossible to doubt that she possessed powers beyond those of\r\ncommon humanity, as she possessed beauty and fascination greater than\r\nare given to any other woman.\r\n\r\nOf one thing I was certain, however, that the Shades I had seemed to\r\nvisit had their being in the circle of her own imagination and\r\nintelligence. There Umslopogaas was right; we had seen no dead, we had\r\nonly seen pictures and images that she drew and fashioned.\r\n\r\nWhy did she do this, I wondered. Perhaps to pretend to powers which she\r\ndid not possess, perhaps out of sheer elfish mischief, or perhaps, as\r\nshe asserted, just to teach us a lesson and to humble us in our own\r\nsight. Well, if so she had succeeded, for never did I feel so crushed\r\nand humiliated as at that moment.\r\n\r\nI had seemed to descend, or ascend, into Hades, and there had only seen\r\nthings that gave me little joy and did but serve to reopen old wounds.\r\nThen, on awaking, I had been bewitched; yes, fresh from those visions\r\nof the most dear dead, I had been bewitched by the overpowering magic\r\nof this woman’s loveliness and charm, and made a fool of myself, only\r\nto be brought back to my senses by her triumphant mockery. Oh, I was\r\nhumbled indeed, and yet the odd thing is that I could not feel angry\r\nwith her, and what is more that, perhaps from vanity, I believed in her\r\nprofession of friendship towards myself.\r\n\r\nWell, the upshot of it was that, like Umslopogaas, more than anything\r\nelse in the world did I desire to depart from this haunted Kôr and to\r\nbury all its recollections in such activities as fortune might bring to\r\nme. And yet, and yet it was well to have seen it and to have plucked\r\nthe flower of such marvellous experience, nor, as I knew even then,\r\ncould I ever inter the memory of Ayesha the wise, the perfect in all\r\nloveliness, and the half-divine in power.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke the next morning the sun was well up and after I had taken\r\na swim in the old bath and dressed myself, I went to see how it fared\r\nwith Inez. I found her sitting at the door of her house looking\r\nextremely well and with a radiant face. She was engaged in making a\r\nchain of some small and beautiful blue flowers of the iris tribe, of\r\nwhich quantities grew about, that she threaded together upon stalks of\r\ndry grass.\r\n\r\nThis chain, which was just finished, she threw over her head so that it\r\nhung down upon her white robe, for now she was dressed like an Arab\r\nwoman though without the veil. I watched her unseen for a little while\r\nthen came forward and spoke to her. She started at the sight of me and\r\nrose as though to run away; then, apparently reassured by my\r\nappearance, selected a particularly fine flower and offered it to me.\r\n\r\nI saw at once that she did not know me in the least and thought that\r\nshe had never seen me before, in short, that her mind had gone, exactly\r\nas Ayesha had said that it would do. By way of making conversation I\r\nasked her if she felt well. She replied, Oh, yes, she had never felt\r\nbetter, then added,\r\n\r\n“Daddy has gone on a long journey and will not be back for weeks and\r\nweeks.”\r\n\r\nAn idea came to me and I answered,\r\n\r\n“Yes, Inez, but I am a friend of his and he has sent me to take you to\r\na place where I hope that we shall find him. Only it is far away, so\r\nyou also must make a long journey.”\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands and answered,\r\n\r\n“Oh, that will be nice, I do so love travelling, especially to find\r\nDaddy, who I expect will have my proper clothes with him, not these\r\nwhich, although they are very comfortable and pretty, seem different to\r\nwhat I used to wear. You look very nice too and I am sure that we shall\r\nbe great friends, which I am glad of, for I have been rather lonely\r\nsince my mother went to live with the saints in Heaven, because, you\r\nsee, Daddy is so busy and so often away, that I do not see much of\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nUpon my word I could have wept when I heard her prattle on thus. It is\r\nso terribly unnatural, almost dreadful indeed, to listen to a full\r\ngrown woman who talks in the accents and expresses the thoughts of a\r\nchild. However, under all the circumstances I recognised that her\r\ncalamity was merciful, and remembering that Ayesha had prophesied the\r\nrecovery of her mind as well as its loss and how great seemed to be her\r\npowers in these directions, I took such comfort as I could.\r\n\r\nLeaving her I went to see the two Zulus who had been wounded and found\r\nto my joy that they were now quite well and fit to travel, for here,\r\ntoo, Ayesha’s prophecy had proved good. The other men also were\r\ncompletely rested and anxious to be gone like Umslopogaas and myself.\r\n\r\nWhile I was eating my breakfast Hans announced the venerable Billali,\r\nwho with a sweeping bow informed me that he had come to inquire when we\r\nshould be ready to start, as he had received orders to see to all the\r\nnecessary arrangements. I replied—within an hour, and he departed in a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nBut little after the appointed time he reappeared with a number of\r\nlitters and their bearers, also with a bodyguard of twenty-five picked\r\nmen, all of whom we recognised as brave fellows who had fought well in\r\nthe battle. These men and the bearers old Billali harangued, telling\r\nthem that they were to guide, carry and escort us to the other side of\r\nthe great swamp, or further if we needed it, and that it was the word\r\nof She-who-commands that if so much as the smallest harm came to any\r\none of us, even by accident, they should die every man of them “by the\r\nhot-pot,” whatever that might be, for I was not sure of the\r\nsignificance of this horror.[2] Then he asked them if they understood.\r\nThey replied with fervour that they understood perfectly and would lead\r\nand guard us as though we were their own mothers.\r\n\r\n [2] For this see the book called “She.”—Editor.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact they did, and I think would have done so\r\nindependently of Ayesha’s command, since they looked upon Umslopogaas\r\nand myself almost as gods and thought that we could destroy them all if\r\nwe wished, as we had destroyed Rezu and his host.\r\n\r\nI asked Billali if he were not coming with us, to which he replied, No,\r\nas She-who-commands had returned to her own place and he must follow\r\nher at once. I asked him again where her own place might be, to which\r\nhe answered vaguely that it was everywhere and he stared first at the\r\nheavens and then at the earth as though she inhabited most of them,\r\nadding that generally it was “in the Caves,” though what he meant by\r\nthat I did not know. Then he said that he was very glad to have met us\r\nand that the sight of Umslopogaas killing Rezu was a spectacle that he\r\nwould remember with pleasure all his life. Also he asked me for a\r\npresent. I gave him a spare pencil that I possessed in a little German\r\nsilver case, with which he was delighted. Thus I parted with old\r\nBillali, of whom I shall always think with a certain affection.\r\n\r\nI noticed even then that he kept very clear indeed of Umslopogaas,\r\nthinking, I suppose, that he might take a last opportunity to fulfil\r\nhis threats and introduce him to his terrible Axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nUMSLOPOGAAS WEARS THE GREAT MEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\nA little while later we started, some of us in litters, including the\r\nwounded Zulus, who I insisted should be carried for a day or two, and\r\nsome on foot. Inez I caused to be borne immediately in front of myself\r\nso that I could keep an eye upon her. Moreover I put her in the\r\nespecial charge of Hans, to whom fortunately she took a great fancy at\r\nonce, perhaps because she remembered subconsciously that she knew him\r\nand that he had been kind to her, although when they met after her long\r\nsleep, as in my own case, she did not recognise him in the least.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, they were again the fastest of friends, so much so that\r\nwithin a day or two the little Hottentot practically filled the place\r\nof a maid to her, attending to her every want and looking after her\r\nexactly as a nurse does after a child, with the result that it was\r\nquite touching to see how she came to depend upon him, “her monkey,” as\r\nshe called him, and how fond he grew of her.\r\n\r\nOnce, indeed, there was trouble, since hearing a noise, I came up to\r\nfind Hans bristling with fury and threatening to shoot one of the\r\nZulus, who stupidly, or perhaps rudely, had knocked against the litter\r\nof Inez and nearly turned it over. For the rest, the Lady Sad-Eyes, as\r\nthey called her, had for the time became the Lady Glad-Eyes, since she\r\nwas merry as the day was long, laughing and singing and playing just as\r\na healthy happy child should do.\r\n\r\nOnly once did I see her wretched and weep. It was when a kitten which\r\nshe had insisted on bringing with her, sprang out of the litter and\r\nvanished into some bush where it could not be found. Even when she was\r\nsoon consoled and dried her tears, when Hans explained to her in a\r\nmixture of bad English and worse Portuguese, that it had only run away\r\nbecause it wished to get back to its mother which it loved, and that it\r\nwas cruel to separate it from its mother.\r\n\r\nWe made good progress and by the evening of the first day were over the\r\ncrest of the cliff or volcano lip that encircles the great plain of\r\nKôr, and descending rapidly to a sheltered spot on the outer slope\r\nwhere our camp was to be set for the night.\r\n\r\nNot very far from this place, as I think I have mentioned, stood, and I\r\nsuppose still stands, a very curious pinnacle of rock, which, doubtless\r\nbeing of some harder sort, had remained when, hundreds of thousands or\r\nmillions of years before, the surrounding lava had been washed or had\r\ncorroded away. This rock pillar was perhaps fifty feet high and as\r\nsmooth as though it had been worked by man; indeed, I remembered having\r\nremarked to Hans, or Umslopogaas—I forget which—when we passed it on\r\nour inward journey, that there was a column which no monkey could\r\nclimb.\r\n\r\nAs we went by it for the second time, the sun had already disappeared\r\nbehind the western cliff, but a fierce ray from its sinking orb, struck\r\nupon a storm-cloud that hung over us, and thence was reflected in a\r\nglow of angry light of which the focus or centre seemed to fall upon\r\nthe summit of this strange and obelisk-like pinnacle of rock.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I was out of my litter and walking with Umslopogaas at\r\nthe end of the line, to make sure that no one straggled in the oncoming\r\ndarkness. When we had passed the column by some forty or fifty yards,\r\nsomething caused Umslopogaas to turn and look back. He uttered an\r\nexclamation which made me follow his example, with the result that I\r\nsaw a very wonderful thing. For there on the point of the pillar, like\r\nSt. Simeon Stylites on his famous column, glowing in the sunset rays as\r\nthough she were on fire, stood Ayesha herself!\r\n\r\nIt was a strange and in a way a glorious sight, for poised thus between\r\nearth and heaven, she looked like some glowing angel rather than a\r\nwoman, standing as she seemed to do upon the darkness; since the\r\nshadows, save for the faintest outline, had swallowed up the column\r\nthat supported her. Moreover, in the intense, rich light that was\r\nfocussed on her, we could see every detail of her form and face, for\r\nshe was unveiled, and even her large and tender eyes which gazed\r\nupwards emptily (at this moment they seemed very tender), yes, and the\r\nlittle gold studs that glittered on her sandals and the shine of the\r\nsnake girdle she wore about her waist.\r\n\r\nWe stared and stared till I said inconsequently,\r\n\r\n“Learn, Umslopogaas, what a liar is that old Billali, who told me that\r\nShe-who-commands had departed from Kôr to her own place.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps this rock edge is her own place, if she be there at all,\r\nMacumazahn.”\r\n\r\n“If she be there,” I answered angrily, for my nerves were at once\r\nthrilled and torn. “Speak not empty words, Umslopogaas, for where else\r\ncan she be when we see her with our eyes?”\r\n\r\n“Who am I that I should know the ways of witches who, like the winds,\r\nare able to go and come as they will? Can a woman run up a wall of rock\r\nlike a lizard, Macumazahn?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless——” and I began some explanation which I have forgotten, when\r\na passing cloud, or I know not what, cut off the light so that both the\r\npinnacle and she who stood on it became invisible. A minute later it\r\nreturned for a little while, and there was the point of the\r\nneedle-shaped rock, but it was empty, as, save for the birds that\r\nrested on it, it had been since the beginning of the world.\r\n\r\nThen Umslopogaas and I shook our heads and pursued our way in silence.\r\n\r\nThis was the last that I saw of the glorious Ayesha, if indeed I did\r\nsee her and not her ghost. Yet it is true that for all the first part\r\nof the journey, till we were through the great swamp in fact, from time\r\nto time I was conscious, or imagined that I was conscious of her\r\npresence. Moreover, once others saw her, or someone who might have been\r\nher. It happened thus.\r\n\r\nWe were in the centre of the great swamp and the trained guides who\r\nwere leading came to a place where the path forked and were uncertain\r\nwhich road to take. Finally they fixed on the right-hand path and were\r\npreparing to follow it together with those who bore the litter of Inez,\r\nby the side of which Hans was walking as usual.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, as Hans told me, the guides went down upon their faces\r\nand he saw standing in front of them a white-veiled form who pointed to\r\nthe left-hand path, and then seemed to be lost in the mist. Without a\r\nword the guides rose and followed this left-hand path. Hans stopped the\r\nlitter till I came up when he told me what had happened, while Inez\r\nalso began to chatter in her childish fashion about a “White Lady.”\r\n\r\nI had the curiosity to walk a little way along the right-hand path\r\nwhich they were about to take. Only a few yards further on I found\r\nmyself sinking in a floating quagmire, from which I extricated myself\r\nwith much difficulty but just in time for as I discovered afterwards by\r\nprobing with a pole, the water beneath the matted reeds was deep. That\r\nnight I questioned the guides upon the subject, but without result, for\r\nthey pretended to have seen nothing and not to understand what I meant.\r\nOf neither of these incidents have I any explanation to offer, except\r\nthat once contracted, it is as difficult to be rid of the habit of\r\nhallucinations as of any other.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that I should give all the details of our long\r\nhomeward journey. So I will only say that having dismissed our bearers\r\nand escorts when we reached higher ground beyond the horrible swamp,\r\nkeeping one litter for Inez in which the Zulus carried her when she was\r\ntired, we accomplished it in complete safety and having crossed the\r\nZambesi, at last one evening reached the house called Strathmuir.\r\n\r\nHere we found the waggon and oxen quite safe and were welcomed\r\nrapturously by my Zulu driver and the _voorlooper_, who had made up\r\ntheir minds that we were dead and were thinking of trekking homewards.\r\nHere also Thomaso greeted us, though I think that, like the Zulus, he\r\nwas astonished at our safe return and indeed not over-pleased to see\r\nus. I told him that Captain Robertson had been killed in a fight in\r\nwhich we had rescued his daughter from the cannibals who had carried\r\nher off (information which I cautioned him to keep to himself) but\r\nnothing else that I could help.\r\n\r\nAlso I warned the Zulus through Umslopogaas and Goroko, that no mention\r\nwas to be made of our adventures, either then or afterwards, since if\r\nthis were done the curse of the White Queen would fall on them and\r\nbring them to disaster and death. I added that the name of this queen\r\nand everything that was connected with her, or her doings, must be\r\nlocked up in their own hearts. It must be like the name of dead kings,\r\nnot to be spoken. Nor indeed did they ever speak it or tell the story\r\nof our search, because they were too much afraid both of Ayesha whom\r\nthey believed to be the greatest of all witches, and of the axe of\r\ntheir captain, Umslopogaas.\r\n\r\nInez went to bed that night without seeming to recognise her old home,\r\nto all appearance just a mindless child as she had been ever since she\r\nawoke from her trance at Kôr. Next morning, however, Hans came to tell\r\nme that she was changed and that she wished to speak with me. I went,\r\nwondering, to find her in the sitting-room, dressed in European clothes\r\nwhich she had taken from where she kept them, and once more a reasoning\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Quatermain,” she said, “I suppose that I must have been ill, for\r\nthe last thing I remember is going to sleep on the night after you\r\nstarted for the hippopotamus hunt. Where is my father? Did any harm\r\ncome to him while he was hunting?”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” I answered, lying boldly, for I feared lest the truth should\r\ntake away her mind again, “it did. He was trampled upon by a\r\nhippopotamus bull, which charged him, and killed, and we were obliged\r\nto bury him where he died.”\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head for a while and muttered some prayer for his soul,\r\nthen looked at me keenly and said,\r\n\r\n“I do not think you are telling me everything, Mr. Quatermain, but\r\nsomething seems to say that this is because it is not well that I\r\nshould learn everything.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered, “you have been ill and out of your mind for quite a\r\nlong while; something gave you a shock. I think that you learned of\r\nyour father’s death, which you have now forgotten, and were overcome\r\nwith the news. Please trust to me and believe that if I keep anything\r\nback from you, it is because I think it best to do so for the present.”\r\n\r\n“I trust and I believe,” she answered. “Now please leave me, but tell\r\nme first where are those women and their children?”\r\n\r\n“After your father died they went away,” I replied, lying once more.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me again but made no comment.\r\n\r\nThen I left her.\r\n\r\nHow much Inez ever learned of the true story of her adventures I do not\r\nknow to this hour, though my opinion is that it was but little. To\r\nbegin with, everyone, including Thomaso, was threatened with the direst\r\nconsequences if he said a word to her on the subject; moreover in her\r\nway she was a wise woman, one who knew when it was best not to ask\r\nquestions. She was aware that she had suffered from a fit of aberration\r\nor madness and that during this time her father had died and certain\r\npeculiar things had happened. There she was content to leave the\r\nbusiness and she never again spoke to me upon the subject. Of this I\r\nwas very glad, as how on earth could I have explained to her about\r\nAyesha’s prophecies as to her lapse into childishness and subsequent\r\nreturn to a normal state when she reached her home seeing that I did\r\nnot understand them myself?\r\n\r\nOnce indeed she did inquire what had become of Janee to which I\r\nanswered that she had died during her sickness. It was another lie, at\r\nany rate by implication, but I hold that there are occasions when it is\r\nrighteous to lie. At least these particular falsehoods have never\r\ntroubled my conscience.\r\n\r\nHere I may as well finish the story of Inez, that is, as far as I can.\r\nAs I have shown she was always a woman of melancholy and religious\r\ntemperament, qualities that seemed to grow upon her after her return to\r\nhealth. Certainly the religion did, for continually she was engaged in\r\nprayer, a development with which heredity may have had something to do,\r\nsince after he became a reformed character and grew unsettled in his\r\nmind, her father followed the same road.\r\n\r\nOn our return to civilisation, as it chanced, one of the first persons\r\nwith whom she came in contact was a very earnest and excellent old\r\npriest of her own faith. The end of this intimacy was much what might\r\nhave been expected. Very soon Inez determined to renounce the world,\r\nwhich I think never had any great attractions for her, and entered a\r\nsisterhood of an extremely strict Order in Natal, where, added to her\r\nmany merits, her considerable possessions made her very welcome indeed.\r\n\r\nOnce in after years I saw her again when she expected before long to\r\nbecome the Mother-Superior of her convent. I found her very cheerful\r\nand she told me that her happiness was complete. Even then she did not\r\nask me the true story of what had happened to her during that period\r\nwhen her mind was a blank. She said that she knew something had\r\nhappened but that as she no longer felt any curiosity about earthly\r\nthings, she did not wish to know the details. Again I rejoiced, for how\r\ncould I tell the true tale and expect to be believed, even by the most\r\nconfiding and simple-minded nun?\r\n\r\nTo return to more immediate events. When we had been at Strathmuir for\r\na day or two and I thought that her mind was clear enough to judge of\r\naffairs, I told Inez that I must journey on to Natal, and asked her\r\nwhat she wished to do. Without a moment’s hesitation she replied that\r\nshe desired to come with me, as now that her father was dead nothing\r\nwould induce her to continue to live at Strathmuir without friends, or\r\nindeed the consolations of religion.\r\n\r\nThen she showed me a secret hiding-place cunningly devised in a sort of\r\ncellar under the sitting-room floor, where her father was accustomed to\r\nkeep the spirits of which he consumed so great a quantity. In this hole\r\nbeneath some bricks, we discovered a large sum in gold stored away,\r\nwhich Robertson had always told his daughter she would find there, in\r\nthe event of anything happening to him. With the money were his will\r\nand securities, also certain mementos of his youth and some\r\nlove-letters together with a prayer-book that his mother had given him.\r\n\r\nThese valuables, of which no one knew the existence except herself, we\r\nremoved and then made our preparations for departure. They were simple;\r\nsuch articles of value as we could carry were packed into the waggon\r\nand the best of the cattle we drove with us. The place with the store\r\nand the rest of the stock were handed over to Thomaso on a half-profit\r\nagreement under arrangement that he should remit the share of Inez\r\ntwice a year to a bank on the coast, where her father had an account.\r\nWhether or not he ever did this I am unable to say, but as no one\r\nwished to stop at Strathmuir, I could conceive no better plan because\r\npurchasers of property in that district did not exist.\r\n\r\nAs we trekked away one fine morning I asked Inez whether she was sorry\r\nto leave the place.\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied with energy, “my life there has been a hell and I\r\nnever wish to see it again.”\r\n\r\nNow it was after this, on the northern borders of Zululand, that\r\nZikali’s Great Medicine, as Hans called it, really played its chief\r\npart, for without it I think that we should have been killed, every one\r\nof us. I do not propose to set out the business in detail; it is too\r\nlong and intricate. Suffice it to say, therefore, that it had to do\r\nwith the plots of Umslopogaas against Cetywayo, which had been betrayed\r\nby his wife Monazi and her lover Lousta, both of whom I have mentioned\r\nearlier in this record. The result was that a watch for him was kept on\r\nall the frontiers, because it was guessed that sooner or later he would\r\nreturn to Zululand; also it had become known that he was travelling in\r\nmy company.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that when my approach was reported by spies, a company\r\nwas gathered under the command of a man connected with the Royal House,\r\nand by it we were surrounded. Before attacking, however, this captain\r\nsent men to me with the message that with me the King had no quarrel,\r\nalthough I was travelling in doubtful company, and that if I would\r\ndeliver over to him Umslopogaas, Chief of the People of the Axe, and\r\nhis followers, I might go whither I wished unharmed, taking my goods\r\nwith me. Otherwise we should be attacked at once and killed every one\r\nof us, since it was not desired that any witnesses should be left of\r\nwhat happened to Umslopogaas. Having delivered this ultimatum and\r\ndeclined any argument as to its terms, the messengers retired, saying\r\nthat they would return for my answer within half an hour.\r\n\r\nWhen they were out of hearing Umslopogaas, who had listened to their\r\nwords in grim silence, turned and spoke in such fashion as might have\r\nbeen expected of him.\r\n\r\n“Macumazahn,” he said, “now I come to the end of an unlucky journey,\r\nthough mayhap it is not so evil as it seems, since I who went out to\r\nseek the dead but to be filled by yonder White Witch with the meat of\r\nmocking shadows, am about to find the dead in the only way in which\r\nthey can be found, namely by becoming of their number.”\r\n\r\n“It seems that this is the case with all of us, Umslopogaas.”\r\n\r\n“Not so, Macumazahn. That child of the King will give you safe-conduct.\r\nIt is I and mine whose blood he seeks, as he has the right to do, since\r\nit is true that I would have raised rebellion against the King, I who\r\nwearied of my petty lot and knew that by blood his place was mine. In\r\nthis quarrel you have no share, though you, whose heart is as white as\r\nyour skin, are not minded to desert me. Moreover, even if you wished to\r\nfight, there is one in the waggon yonder whose life is not yours to\r\ngive. The Lady Sad-Eyes is as a child in your arms and her you must\r\nbear to safety.”\r\n\r\nNow this argument was so unanswerable that I did not know what to say.\r\nSo I only asked what he meant to do, as escape was impossible, seeing\r\nthat we were surrounded on every side.\r\n\r\n“Make a glorious end, Macumazahn,” he said with a smile. “I will go out\r\nwith those who cling to me, that is with all who remain of my men,\r\nsince my fate must be theirs, and stand back to back on yonder mound\r\nand there wait till these dogs of the King come up against us. Watch a\r\nwhile, Macumazahn, and see how Umslopogaas, Bearer of the Axe, and the\r\nwarriors of the Axe can fight and die.”\r\n\r\nNow I was silent for I knew not what to say. There we all stood silent,\r\nwhile minute by minute I watched the shadow creeping forward towards a\r\nmark that the head messenger had made with his spear upon the ground,\r\nfor he had said that when it touched that mark he would return for his\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nIn this rather dreadful silence I heard a dry little cough, which I\r\nknew came from the throat of Hans, and to be his method of indicating\r\nthat he had a remark to make.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” I asked with irritation, for it was annoying to see him\r\nseated there on the ground fanning himself with the remains of a hat\r\nand staring vacantly at the sky.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, Baas, or rather, only this, Baas: Those hyenas of Zulus are\r\neven more afraid of the Great Medicine than were the cannibals up\r\nnorth, since the maker of it is nearer to them, Baas. You remember,\r\nBaas, they knelt to it, as it were, when we were going out of\r\nZululand.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what of it, now that we are going into Zululand?” I inquired\r\nsharply. “Do you want me to show it to them?”\r\n\r\n“No, Baas. What is the use, seeing that they are ready to let you pass,\r\nalso the Lady Sad-Eyes, and me and the cattle with the driver and\r\n_voorlooper_, which is better still, and all the other goods. So what\r\nhave you to gain by showing them the medicine? But perchance if it were\r\non the neck of Umslopogaas and _he_ showed it to them and brought it to\r\ntheir minds that those who touch him who is in the shadow of Zikali’s\r\nGreat Medicine, or aught that is his, die within three moons in this\r\nway or in that—well, Baas, who knows?” and again he coughed drily and\r\nstared up at the sky.\r\n\r\nI translated what Hans had said in Dutch to Umslopogaas, who remarked\r\nindifferently,\r\n\r\n“This little yellow man is well named Light-in-Darkness; at least the\r\nplan can be tried—if it fails there is always time to die.”\r\n\r\nSo thinking that this was an occasion on which I might properly do so,\r\nfor the first time I took off the talisman which I had worn for so\r\nlong, and Umslopogaas put it over his head and hid it beneath his\r\nblanket.\r\n\r\nA little while later the messengers returned and this time the captain\r\nhimself came with them, as he said to greet me, for I knew him slightly\r\nand once we had dealt together about some cattle. After a friendly chat\r\nhe turned to the matter of Umslopogaas, explaining the case at some\r\nlength. I said that I quite understood his position but that it was a\r\n_very_ awkward thing to interfere with a man who was the actual wearer\r\nof the Great Medicine of Zikali itself. When the captain heard this his\r\neyes almost started out of his head.\r\n\r\n“The Great Medicine of the Opener-of-Roads!” he exclaimed. “Oh, now I\r\nunderstand why this Chief of the People of the Axe is\r\nunconquerable—such a wizard that no one is able to kill him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied, “and you remember, do you not, that he who offends\r\nthe Great Medicine, or offers violence to him who wears it, dies\r\nhorribly within three moons, he and his household and all those with\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“I have heard it,” he said with a sickly smile.\r\n\r\n“And now you are about to learn whether the tale is true,” I added\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\nThen he asked to see Umslopogaas alone.\r\n\r\nI did not overhear their conversation, but the end of it was that\r\nUmslopogaas came and said in a loud voice so that no one could miss a\r\nsingle word, that as resistance was useless and he did not wish me, his\r\nfriend, to be involved in any trouble, together with his men he had\r\nagreed to accompany this King’s captain to the royal kraal where he had\r\nbeen guaranteed a fair trial as to certain false charges which had been\r\nbrought against him. He added that the King’s captain had sworn upon\r\nthe Great Medicine of the Opener-of-Roads to give him safe conduct and\r\nattempt no mischief against him which, as was well known throughout the\r\nland, was an oath that could not be broken by anyone who wished to\r\ncontinue to look upon the sun.\r\n\r\nI asked the captain if these things were so, also speaking in a loud\r\nvoice. He replied, Yes, since his orders were to take Umslopogaas alive\r\nif he might. He was only to kill him if he would not come.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, while pretending to give him certain articles out of the\r\nwaggon, I had a few private words with Umslopogaas, who told me that\r\nthe arrangement was that he should be allowed to escape at night with\r\nhis people.\r\n\r\n“Be sure of this, Macumazahn,” he said, “that if I do not escape,\r\nneither will that captain, since I walk at his side and keep my axe,\r\nand at the first sign of treachery the axe will enter the house of that\r\nthick head of his and make friends with the brain inside.\r\n\r\n“Macumazahn,” he added, “we have made a strange journey together and\r\nseen such things as I did not think the world had to show. Also I have\r\nfought and killed Rezu in a mad battle of ghosts and men which alone\r\nwas worth all the trouble of the journey. Now it has come to an end as\r\neverything must, and we part, but as I believe, not for always. I do\r\nnot think that I shall die on this journey with the captain, though I\r\ndo think that others will die at the end of it,” he added grimly, a\r\nsaying which at the time I did not understand.\r\n\r\n“It comes into my heart, Macumazahn, that in yonder land of witches and\r\nwizards, the spirit of prophecy got caught in my moocha and crept into\r\nmy bowels. Now that spirit tells me that we shall meet again in the\r\nafter-years and stand together in a great fray which will be our last,\r\nas I believe that the White Witch said. Or perhaps the spirit lives in\r\nZikali’s Medicine which has gone down my throat and comes out of it in\r\nwords. I cannot say, but I pray that it is a true spirit, since\r\nalthough you are white and I am black and you are small and I am big,\r\nand you are gentle and cunning, whereas I am fierce and as open as the\r\nblade of my own axe, yet I love you as well, Macumazahn, as though we\r\nwere born of the same mother and had been brought up in the same kraal.\r\nNow that captain waits and grows doubtful of our talk, so farewell. I\r\nwill return the Great Medicine to Zikali, if I live, and if I die he\r\nmust send one of the ghosts that serve him, to fetch it from among my\r\nbones.\r\n\r\n“Farewell to you also, Yellow Man,” he went on to Hans, who had\r\nappeared, hovering about like a dog that is doubtful of its welcome;\r\n“well are you named Light-in-Darkness, and glad am I to have met you,\r\nwho have learned from you how a snake moves and strikes, and how a\r\njackal thinks and avoids the snare. Yes, farewell, for the spirit\r\nwithin me does not tell me that you and I shall meet again.”\r\n\r\nThen he lifted the great axe, and gave me a formal salute, naming me\r\n“Chief and Father, Great Chief and Father, from of old” (_Baba! Koos y\r\numcool! Koos y pagate!_), thereby acknowledging my superiority over\r\nhim, a thing that he had never done before, and as he did, so did\r\nGoroko and the other Zulus, adding to their salute many titles of\r\npraise. In another minute he had gone with the King’s captain, to whose\r\nside I noted he clung lovingly, his long, thin fingers playing about\r\nthe horn handle of the axe that was named _Inkosikaas_ and Groan-maker.\r\n\r\n“I am glad we have seen the last of him and his axe, Baas,” remarked\r\nHans, spitting reflectively. “It is very well to sleep in the same hut\r\nwith a tame lion sometimes, but after you have done so for many moons,\r\nyou begin to wonder when you will wake up at night to find him pulling\r\nthe blankets off you and combing your hair with his claws. Yes, I am\r\nvery glad that this half-tame lion is gone, since sometimes I have\r\nthought that I should be obliged to poison it that we might sleep in\r\npeace. You know he called me a snake, Baas, and poison is a snake’s\r\nonly spear. Shall I tell the boys to inspan the oxen, Baas? I think the\r\nfurther we get from that King’s captain and his men, the more\r\ncomfortably shall we travel, especially now when we no longer have the\r\nGreat Medicine to protect us.”\r\n\r\n“You suggested giving it to him, Hans,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Baas, I had rather that Umslopogaas went away with the Great\r\nMedicine, than that you kept the Great Medicine and he stopped with us\r\nhere. Never travel with a traitor, Baas, at any rate in the land of the\r\nking whom he wishes to kill. Kings are very selfish people, Baas, and\r\ndo not like being killed, especially by someone who wants to sit upon\r\ntheir stool and to take the royal salute. No one gives the royal salute\r\nto a dead king, Baas, however great he was before he died, and no one\r\nthinks the worse of a king who was a traitor before he became a king.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nALLAN DELIVERS THE MESSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more I sat in the Black Kloof face to face with old Zikali.\r\n\r\n“So you have got back safely, Macumazahn,” he said. “Well, I told you\r\nyou would, did I not? As for what happened to you upon the journey, let\r\nit be, for now that I am old long stories tire me and I daresay that\r\nthere is nothing wonderful about this one. Where is the charm I lent\r\nyou? Give it back now that it has served its turn.”\r\n\r\n“I have not got it, Zikali. I passed it on to Umslopogaas of the Axe to\r\nsave his life from the King’s men.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, so you did. I had forgotten. Here it is,” and opening his\r\nrobe of fur, he showed me the hideous little talisman hanging about his\r\nneck, then added, “Would you like a copy of it, Macumazahn, to keep as\r\na memory? If so, I will carve one for you.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered, “I should not. Has Umslopogaas been here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he has been and gone again, which is one of the reasons why I do\r\nnot wish to hear your tale a second time.”\r\n\r\n“Where to? The Town of the People of the Axe?”\r\n\r\n“No, Macumazahn, he came thence, or so I understood, but thither he\r\nwill return no more.”\r\n\r\n“Why not, Zikali?”\r\n\r\n“Because after his fashion he made trouble there and left some dead\r\nbehind him; one Lousta, I believe, whom he had appointed to sit on his\r\nstool as chief while he was away, and a woman called Monazi, who was\r\nhis wife, or Lousta’s wife, or the wife of both of them, I forget\r\nwhich. It is said that having heard stories of her—and the ears of\r\njealousy are long, Macumazahn—he cut off this woman’s head with a sweep\r\nof the axe and made Lousta fight him till he fell, which the fool did\r\nalmost before he had lifted his shield. It served him right who should\r\nhave made sure that Umslopogaas was dead before he wrapped himself in\r\nhis blanket and took the woman to cook his porridge.”\r\n\r\n“Where has the Axe-bearer gone?” I asked without surprise, for this\r\nnews did not astonish me.\r\n\r\n“I neither know nor care, Macumazahn. To become a wanderer, I suppose.\r\nHe will tell you the tale when you meet again in the after-days, as I\r\nunderstand he thinks that you will do.[1] Hearken! I have done with\r\nthis lion’s whelp, who is Chaka over again, but without Chaka’s wit.\r\nYes, he is just a fighting man with a long reach, a sure eye and the\r\ntrick of handling an axe, and such are of little use to me who know too\r\nmany of them. Thrice have I tried to make him till my garden, but each\r\ntime he has broken the hoe, although the wage I promised him was a\r\nroyal _kaross_ and nothing less. So enough of Umslopogaas, the\r\nWoodpecker. Almost I wish that you had not lent him the charm, for then\r\nthe King’s men would have made an end of him, who knows too much and\r\nlike some silly boaster, may shout out the truth when his axe is aloft\r\nand he is full of the beer of battle. For in battle he will live and in\r\nbattle he will die, Macumazahn, as perhaps you may see one day.”\r\n\r\n [1] For the tale of this meeting see the book called “Allan\r\n Quatermain.”—Editor.\r\n\r\n“The fate of your friends does not trouble you over much,\r\nOpener-of-Roads,” I said with sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“Not at all, Macumazahn, because I have none. The only friends of the\r\nold are those whom they can turn to their own ends, and if these fail\r\nthem they find others.”\r\n\r\n“I understand, Zikali, and know now what to expect from you.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed in his strange way and answered,\r\n\r\n“Aye, and it is good that you must expect, good in the future as in the\r\npast, for _you_, Macumazahn, who are brave in your own fashion, without\r\nbeing a fool like Umslopogaas, and, although you know it not, like some\r\nmaster-smith, forge my assegais out of the red ore I give you,\r\ntempering them in the blood of men, and yet keep your mind innocent and\r\nyour hands clean. Friends like you are useful to such as I, Macumazahn,\r\nand must be well paid in those wares that please them.”\r\n\r\nThe old wizard brooded for a space, while I reflected upon his amazing\r\ncynicism, which interested me in a way, for the extreme of unmorality\r\nis as fascinating to study as the extreme of virtue and often more so.\r\nThen jerking up his great head, he asked suddenly,\r\n\r\n“What message had the White Queen for me?”\r\n\r\n“She said that you troubled her too much at night in dreams, Zikali.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, but if I cease to do so, ever she desires to know the reason why,\r\nfor I hear her asking me in the voices of the wind, or in the\r\ntwittering of bats. After all, she is a woman, Macumazahn, and it must\r\nbe dull sitting alone from year to year with naught to stay her\r\nappetite save the ashes of the past and dreams of the future, so dull\r\nthat I wonder, having once meshed you in her web, how she found the\r\nheart to let you go before she had sucked out your life and spirit. I\r\nsuppose that having made a mock of you and drained you dry, she was\r\ncontent to throw you aside like an empty gourd. Perchance, had she kept\r\nyou at her side, you would have been a stone in her path in days to\r\ncome. Perchance, Macumazahn, she waits for other travellers and would\r\nwelcome them, or one of them alone, saying nothing of a certain\r\nWatcher-by-Night who has served her turn and vanished into the night.\r\n\r\n“But what other message had the White Queen for the poor old savage\r\nwitch-doctor whose talk wearies her so much in her haunted sleep?”\r\n\r\nThen I told him of the picture that Ayesha had shown me in the water;\r\nthe picture of a king dying in a hut and of two who watched his end.\r\n\r\nZikali listened intently to every word, then broke into a peal of his\r\nunholy laughter.\r\n\r\n“_Oho-ho!_” he laughed, “so all goes well, though the road be long,\r\nsince whatever this White One may have shown you in the fire of the\r\nheavens above, she could show you nothing but truth in the water of the\r\nearth below, for that is the law of our company of seers. You have\r\nworked well for me, Macumazahn, and you have had your fee, the fee of\r\nthe vision of the dead which you desired above all mortal things.”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” I answered indignantly, “a fee of bitter fruits whereof the\r\njuice burns and twists the mouth and the stones still stick fast within\r\nthe gizzard. I tell you, Zikali, that she stuffed my heart with lies.”\r\n\r\n“I daresay, Macumazahn, I daresay, but they were very pretty lies, were\r\nthey not? And after all I am sure that there was wisdom in them, as you\r\nwill discover when you have thought them over for a score of years.\r\n\r\n“Lies, lies, all is lies! But beyond the lie stands Truth, as the White\r\nWitch stands behind her veil. You drew the veil, Macumazahn, and saw\r\nthat beneath which brought you to your knees. Why, it is a parable.\r\nWander on through the Valley of Lies till at last it takes a turn, and,\r\nglittering in the sunshine, glittering like gold, you perceive the\r\nMountain of everlasting Truth, sought of all men but found by few.\r\n\r\n“Lies, lies, all is lies! Yet beyond I tell you, beauteous and eternal\r\nstands the Truth, Macumazahn. _Oho-ho! Oho-ho!_ Fare you well,\r\nWatcher-by-Night, fare you well, Seeker after Truth. After the Night\r\ncomes Dawn and after Death comes what—Macumazahn? Well, you will learn\r\none day, for always the veil is lifted, at last, as the White Witch\r\nshewed you yonder, Macumazahn.”",
