However,\r\nthe attempt has been made, in the belief that there are many who,\r\nthough they cannot follow the mathematical analysis of Maxwell’s work,\r\nhave sufficient general knowledge of physical ideas and principles to\r\nmake an account of Maxwell and of the development of the truths that he\r\ndiscovered, subjects of intelligent interest.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s life was written in 1882 by two of those who were most\r\nintimately connected with him, Professor Lewis Campbell and Dr.\r\nGarnett. Many of the biographical details of the earlier part of this\r\nbook are taken from their work. My thanks are due to them and to their\r\npublishers, Messrs. Macmillan, for permission to use any of the letters\r\nwhich appear in their biography. I trust that my brief account may\r\nbe sufficient to induce many to read Professor Campbell’s “Life and\r\nLetters,” with a view of learning more of the inner thoughts of one who\r\nhas left so strong an imprint on all he undertook, and was so deeply\r\nloved by all who knew him.\r\n\r\n                                                  R. T. G.\r\n\r\n  _Cambridge,\r\n        December, 1895._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n     I.

The\r\nyears which have passed, since that date, have all tended to strengthen\r\nthe belief in the greatness of Maxwell’s work and in the fertility\r\nof his genius, which has inspired the labours of those who, not in\r\nCambridge only, but throughout the world, have aided in developing the\r\nseeds sown by him. My object in the following pages will be to give\r\nsome very brief account of his life and writings, in a form which may,\r\nI hope, enable many to realise what Physical Science owes to one who\r\nwas to me a most kind friend as well as a revered master.\r\n\r\nThe Clerks of Penicuik, from whom Clerk Maxwell was descended, were\r\na distinguished family. Sir John Clerk, the great-great-grandfather\r\nof Clerk Maxwell, was a Baron of the Exchequer in Scotland from\r\n1707 to 1755; he was also one of the Commissioners of the Union,\r\nand was in many ways an accomplished scholar. His second son George\r\nmarried a first cousin, Dorothea Maxwell, the heiress of Middlebie in\r\nDumfriesshire, and took the name of Maxwell. By the death of his elder\r\nbrother James in 1782 George Clerk Maxwell succeeded to the baronetcy\r\nand the property of Penicuik. Before this time he had become involved\r\nin mining and manufacturing speculations, and most of the Middlebie\r\nproperty had been sold to pay his debts.\r\n\r\nThe property of Sir George Clerk Maxwell descended in 1798 to his two\r\ngrandsons, Sir George Clerk and Mr. John Clerk Maxwell. It had been\r\narranged that the younger of the two was to take the remains of the\r\nMiddlebie property and to assume with it the name of Maxwell. Sir\r\nGeorge Clerk was member for Midlothian, and held office under Sir\r\nRobert Peel. John Clerk Maxwell was the father of James Clerk Maxwell,\r\nthe subject of this sketch.[1]\r\n\r\nJohn Clerk Maxwell lived with his widowed mother in Edinburgh until her\r\ndeath in 1824. He was a lawyer, and from time to time did some little\r\nbusiness in the courts. At the same time he maintained an interest in\r\nscientific pursuits, especially those of a practical nature. Professor\r\nCampbell tells us of an endeavour to devise a bellows which would give\r\na continuous draught of air. In 1831 he contributed to the _Edinburgh\r\nMedical and Philosophical Journal_ a paper entitled “Outlines of a Plan\r\nfor combining Machinery with the Manual Printing Press.”\r\n\r\nIn 1826 John Clerk Maxwell married Miss Frances Cay, of North Charlton,\r\nNorthumberland. For the first few years of their married life their\r\nhome was in Edinburgh. The old estate of Middlebie had been greatly\r\nreduced in extent, and there was not a house on it in which the laird\r\ncould live. However, soon after his marriage, John Clerk Maxwell\r\npurchased the adjoining property of Glenlair and built a mansion-house\r\nfor himself and his wife. Mr. Maxwell superintended the building work.\r\nThe actual working plans for some further additions made in 1843\r\nwere his handiwork. A garden was laid out and planted, and a dreary\r\nstony waste was converted into a pleasant home. For some years after\r\nhe settled at Glenlair the house in Edinburgh was retained by Mr.\r\nMaxwell, and here, on June 13, 1831, was born his only son, James Clerk\r\nMaxwell. A daughter, born earlier, died in infancy. Glenlair, however,\r\nwas his parents’ home, and nearly all the reminiscences we have of\r\nhis childhood are connected with it. The laird devoted himself to his\r\nestates and to the education of his son, taking, however, from time to\r\ntime his full share in such county business as fell to him. Glenlair in\r\n1830 was very much in the wilds; the journey from Edinburgh occupied\r\ntwo days. “Carriages in the modern sense were hardly known to the Vale\r\nof Urr. A sort of double gig with a hood was the best apology for a\r\ntravelling coach, and the most active mode of locomotion was in a kind\r\nof rough dog-cart known in the family speech as a hurly.”[2]\r\n\r\nMrs. Maxwell writes thus[3], when the boy was nearly three years old,\r\nto her sister, Miss Jane Cay:--\r\n\r\n    “He is a very happy man, and has improved much since the\r\n    weather got moderate. He has great work with doors, locks,\r\n    keys, etc., and ‘Show me how it doos’ is never out of his\r\n    mouth. He also investigates the hidden course of streams and\r\n    bell-wires--the way the water gets from the pond through the\r\n    wall and a pend or small bridge and down a drain into Water\r\n    Orr, then past the smiddy and down to the sea, where Maggy’s\r\n    ships sail. As to the bells, they will not rust; he stands\r\n    sentry in the kitchen and Mag runs through the house ringing\r\n    them all by turns, or he rings and sends Bessy to see and shout\r\n    to let him know; and he drags papa all over to show him the\r\n    holes where the wires go through.”\r\n\r\nTo discover “how it doos” was thus early his aim. His cousin, Mrs.\r\nBlackburn, tells us that throughout his childhood his constant question\r\nwas, “What’s the go of that? What does it do?” And if the answer were\r\ntoo vague or inconclusive, he would add, “But what’s the _particular_\r\ngo of that?”\r\n\r\nProfessor Campbell’s most interesting account of these early years is\r\nillustrated by a number of sketches of episodes in his life. In one\r\nMaxwell is absorbed in watching the fiddler at a country dance; in\r\nanother he is teaching his dog some tricks; in a third he is helping a\r\nsmaller boy in his efforts to build a castle. Together with his cousin,\r\nMiss Wedderburn, he devised a number of figures for a toy known as a\r\nmagic disc, which afterwards developed into the zoetrope or wheel of\r\nlife, and in which, by means of an ingenious contrivance of mirrors,\r\nthe impression of a continuous movement was produced.\r\n\r\nThis happy life went on until his mother’s death in December, 1839; she\r\ndied, at the age of forty-eight, of the painful disease to which her\r\nson afterwards succumbed. When James, being then eight years old, was\r\ntold that she was now in heaven, he said: “Oh, I’m so glad! Now she’ll\r\nhave no more pain.”\r\n\r\nAfter this his aunt, Miss Jane Cay, took a mother’s place. The problem\r\nof his education had to be faced, and the first attempts were not\r\nsuccessful. A tutor had been engaged during Mrs. Maxwell’s last\r\nillness, and he, it seems, tried to coerce Clerk Maxwell into learning;\r\nbut such treatment failed, and in 1841, when ten years old, he began\r\nhis school-life at the Edinburgh Academy.\r\n\r\nSchool-life at first had its hardships. Maxwell’s appearance, his\r\nfirst day at school, in Galloway home-spun and square-toed shoes with\r\nbuckles, was more than his fellows could stand. “Who made those shoes?”\r\nthey asked[4]; and the reply they received was--\r\n\r\n      “Div ye ken ’twas a man,\r\n      And he lived in a house,\r\n      In whilk was a mouse.”\r\n\r\nHe returned to Heriot Row that afternoon, says Professor Campbell,\r\n“with his tunic in rags and wanting the skirt, his neat frill rumpled\r\nand torn--himself excessively amused by his experiences and showing not\r\nthe slightest sign of irritation.”\r\n\r\nNo. 31, Heriot Row, was the house of his widowed aunt, Mrs. Wedderburn,\r\nMr. Maxwell’s sister; and this, with occasional intervals when he\r\nwas with Miss Cay, was his home for the next eight or nine years.\r\nMr. Maxwell himself, during this period, spent much of his time in\r\nEdinburgh, living with his sister during most of the winter and\r\nreturning to Glenlair for the spring and summer.\r\n\r\nMuch of what we know of Clerk Maxwell’s life during this period comes\r\nfrom the letters which passed between him and his father. They tell\r\nus of the close intimacy and affection which existed between the two,\r\nof the boy’s eager desire to please and amuse his father in the dull\r\nsolitude of Glenlair, and his father’s anxiety for his welfare and\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nProfessor Campbell was his schoolfellow, and records events of those\r\nyears in which he shared, which bring clearly before us what Clerk\r\nMaxwell was like. Thus he writes[5]:--\r\n\r\n    “He came to know Swift and Dryden, and after a while Hobbes,\r\n    and Butler’s ‘Hudibras.’ Then, if his father was in Edinburgh,\r\n    they walked together, especially on the Saturday half-holiday,\r\n    and ‘viewed’ Leith Fort, or the preparations for the Granton\r\n    railway, or the stratification of Salisbury Crags--always\r\n    learning something new, and winning ideas for imagination to\r\n    feed upon. One Saturday, February 12, 1842, he had a special\r\n    treat, being taken ‘to see electro-magnetic machines.’”\r\n\r\nAnd again, speaking of his school-life:--\r\n\r\n    “But at school also he gradually made his way. He soon\r\n    discovered that Latin was worth learning, and the Greek\r\n    Delectus interested him when we got so far. And there were two\r\n    subjects in which he at once took the foremost place, when he\r\n    had a fair chance of doing so; these were Scripture Biography\r\n    and English. In arithmetic as well as in Latin his comparative\r\n    want of readiness kept him down.\r\n\r\n    “On the whole he attained a measure of success which helped\r\n    to secure for him a certain respect; and, however strange he\r\n    sometimes seemed to his companions, he had three qualities\r\n    which they could not fail to understand--agile strength\r\n    of limb, imperturbable courage, and profound good-nature.\r\n    Professor James Muirhead remembers him as ‘a friendly boy,\r\n    though never quite amalgamating with the rest.’ And another old\r\n    class-fellow, the Rev. W. Macfarlane of Lenzie, records the\r\n    following as his impression:--‘Clerk Maxwell, when he entered\r\n    the Academy, was somewhat rustic and somewhat eccentric. Boys\r\n    called him “Dafty,” and used to try to make fun of him. On one\r\n    occasion I remember he turned with tremendous vigour, with a\r\n    kind of demonic force, on his tormentors. I think he was let\r\n    alone after that, and gradually won the respect even of the\r\n    most thoughtless of his schoolfellows.’”\r\n\r\nThe first reference to mathematical studies occurs, says Professor\r\nCampbell, in a letter to his father written soon after his thirteenth\r\nbirthday.[6]\r\n\r\n    “After describing the Virginian Minstrels, and betwixt\r\n    inquiries after various pets at Glenlair, he remarks, as if it\r\n    were an ordinary piece of news, ‘I have made a tetrahedron, a\r\n    dodecahedron, and two other hedrons, whose names I don’t know.’\r\n    We had not yet begun geometry, and he had certainly not at this\r\n    time learnt the definitions in Euclid; yet he had not merely\r\n    realised the nature of the five regular solids sufficiently to\r\n    construct them out of pasteboard with approximate accuracy, but\r\n    had further contrived other symmetrical polyhedra derived from\r\n    them, specimens of which (as improved in 1848) may be still\r\n    seen at the Cavendish Laboratory.\r\n\r\n    “Who first called his attention to the pyramid, cube, etc., I\r\n    do not know. He may have seen an account of them by chance in a\r\n    book. But the fact remains that at this early time his fancy,\r\n    like that of the old Greek geometers, was arrested by these\r\n    types of complete symmetry; and his imagination so thoroughly\r\n    mastered them that he proceeded to make them with his own\r\n    hand. That he himself attached more importance to this moment\r\n    than the letter indicates is proved by the care with which he\r\n    has preserved these perishable things, so that they (or those\r\n    which replaced them in 1848) are still in existence after\r\n    thirty-seven years.”\r\n\r\nThe summer holidays were spent at Glenlair. His cousin, Miss Jemima\r\nWedderburn, was with him, and shared his play. Her skilled pencil\r\nhas left us many amusing pictures of the time, some of which are\r\nreproduced by Professor Campbell. There were expeditions and picnics of\r\nall sorts, and a new toy known as “the devil on two sticks” afforded\r\ninfinite amusement. The winter holidays usually found him at Penicuik,\r\nor occasionally at Glasgow, with Professor Blackburne or Professor\r\nW. Thomson (now Lord Kelvin). In October, 1844, Maxwell was promoted\r\nto the rector’s class-room. John Williams, afterwards Archdeacon of\r\nCardigan, a distinguished Baliol man, was rector, and the change was\r\nin many ways an important one for Maxwell. He writes to his father: “I\r\nlike P---- better than B----. We have lots of jokes, and he speaks a\r\ngreat deal, and we have not so much monotonous parsing. In the English\r\nMilton is better than the History of Greece....”\r\n\r\nP---- was the boys’ nickname for the rector; B---- for Mr. Carmichael,\r\nthe second master. This[7] is the account of Maxwell’s first interview\r\nwith the rector:--\r\n\r\n_Rector_: “What part of Galloway do you come from?”\r\n\r\n_J. C. M._: “From the Vale of Urr. Ye spell it o, err, err, or oo, err,\r\nerr.”\r\n\r\nThe study of geometry was begun, and in the mathematical master, Mr.\r\nGloag, Maxwell found a teacher with a real gift for his task. It was\r\nhere that Maxwell’s vast superiority to many who were his companions\r\nat once showed itself. “He seemed,” says Professor Campbell, “to be in\r\nthe heart of the subject when they were only at the boundary; but the\r\nboyish game of contesting point by point with such a mind was a most\r\nwholesome stimulus, so that the mere exercise of faculty was a pure\r\njoy. With Maxwell the first lessons of geometry branched out at once\r\ninto inquiries which became fruitful.”\r\n\r\nIn July, 1845, he writes:--\r\n\r\n    “I have got the 11th prize for Scholarship, the 1st for\r\n    English, the prize for English verses, and the Mathematical\r\n    Medal. I tried for Scripture knowledge, and Hamilton in the 7th\r\n    has got it. We tried for the Medal on Thursday. I had done them\r\n    all, and got home at half-past two; but Campbell stayed till\r\n    four. I was rather tired with writing exercises from nine till\r\n    half-past two.\r\n\r\n    “Campbell and I went ‘once more unto the b(r)each’ to-day at\r\n    Portobello. I can swim a little now. Campbell has got 6 prizes.\r\n    He got a letter written too soon, congratulating him upon _my_\r\n    medal; but there is no rivalry betwixt us, as B---- Carmichael\r\n    says.”\r\n\r\nAfter a summer spent chiefly at Glenlair, he returned with his father\r\nto Edinburgh for the winter, and began, at the age of fourteen, to go\r\nto the meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. At the Society of\r\nArts he met Mr. R. D. Hay, the decorative painter, who had interested\r\nhimself in the attempt to reduce beauty in form and colour to\r\nmathematical principles. Clerk Maxwell was interested in the question\r\nhow to draw a perfect oval, and devised a method of drawing oval curves\r\nwhich was referred by his father to Professor Forbes for his criticism\r\nand suggestions. After discussing the matter with Professor Kelland,\r\nProfessor Forbes wrote as follows[8]:--\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR SIR,--I am glad to find to-day, from Professor\r\n    Kelland, that his opinion of your son’s paper agrees with\r\n    mine, namely, that it is most ingenious, most creditable to\r\n    him, and, we believe, a new way of considering higher curves\r\n    with reference to foci. Unfortunately, these ovals appear\r\n    to be curves of a very high and intractable order, so that\r\n    possibly the elegant method of description may not lead to a\r\n    corresponding simplicity in investigating their properties. But\r\n    that is not the present point. If you wish it, I think that\r\n    the simplicity and elegance of the method would entitle it to\r\n    be brought before the Royal Society.--Believe me, my dear sir,\r\n    yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                        “JAMES D. FORBES.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, Clerk Maxwell’s first published paper was\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on April 6th, 1846,\r\nwhen its author was barely fifteen. Its title is as follows: “On the\r\nDescription of Oval Curves and those having a Plurality of Foci. By Mr.\r\nClerk Maxwell, Junior. With Remarks by Professor Forbes. Communicated\r\nby Professor Forbes.”\r\n\r\nThe notice in his father’s diary runs: “M. 6 [Ap., 1846.] Royal Society\r\nwith Jas. Professor Forbes gave acct. of James’s Ovals. Met with very\r\ngreat attention and approbation generally.”\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Maxwell and\r\nForbes.\r\n\r\nThe curves investigated by Maxwell have the property that the sum found\r\nby adding to the distance of any point on the curve from one focus a\r\nconstant multiple of the distance of the same point from a second focus\r\nis always constant.\r\n\r\nThe curves are of great importance in the theory of light, for if this\r\nconstant factor expresses the refractive index of any medium, then\r\nlight diverging from one focus without the medium and refracted at a\r\nsurface bounding the medium, and having the form of one of Maxwell’s\r\novals, will be refracted so as to converge to the second focus.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time he was busy with some investigations on the\r\nproperties of jelly and gutta-percha, which seem to have been suggested\r\nby Forbes’ “Theory of Glaciers.”\r\n\r\nHe failed to obtain the Mathematical Medal in 1846--possibly on account\r\nof these researches--but he continued at school till 1847, when he\r\nleft, being then first in mathematics and in English, and nearly first\r\nin Latin.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 he was working at magnetism and the polarisation of light.\r\nSome time in that year he was taken by his uncle, Mr. John Cay, to see\r\nWilliam Nicol, the inventor of the polarising prism, who showed him the\r\ncolours exhibited by polarised light after passing through unannealed\r\nglass. On his return, he made a polariscope with a glass reflector.\r\nThe framework of the first instrument was of cardboard, but a superior\r\narticle was afterwards constructed of wood. Small lenses mounted on\r\ncardboard were employed when a conical pencil was needed. By means\r\nof this instrument he examined the figures exhibited by pieces of\r\nunannealed glass, which he prepared himself; and, with a camera lucida\r\nand box of colours, he reproduced these figures on paper, taking care\r\nto sketch no outlines, but to shade each coloured band imperceptibly\r\ninto the next. Some of these coloured drawings he forwarded to Nicol,\r\nand was more than repaid by the receipt shortly afterwards of a pair of\r\nprisms prepared by Nicol himself. These prisms were always very highly\r\nprized by Maxwell. Once, when at Trinity, the little box containing\r\nthem was carried off by his bed-maker during a vacation, and destined\r\nfor destruction. The bed-maker died before term commenced, and it\r\nwas only by diligent search among her effects that the prisms were\r\nrecovered.[9] After this they were more carefully guarded, and they\r\nare now, together with the wooden polariscope, the bits of unannealed\r\nglass, and the water-colour drawings, in one of the showcases at the\r\nCavendish Laboratory.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Professor P. G. Tait and he were schoolfellows at the\r\nAcademy, acknowledged as the two best mathematicians in the school. It\r\nwas thought desirable, says Professor Campbell, that “we should have\r\nlessons in physical science, so one of the classical masters gave them\r\nout of a text-book.... The only thing I distinctly remember about these\r\nhours is that Maxwell and P. G. Tait seemed to know much more about the\r\nsubject than our teacher did.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of these days is given by Professor Tait in an\r\nobituary notice on Maxwell printed in the “Proceedings of the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh, 1879–80,” from which the following is taken:--\r\n\r\n    “When I first made Clerk Maxwell’s acquaintance, about\r\n    thirty-five years ago, at the Edinburgh Academy, he was a year\r\n    before me, being in the fifth class, while I was in the fourth.\r\n\r\n    “At school he was at first regarded as shy and rather dull.\r\n    He made no friendships, and he spent his occasional holidays\r\n    in reading old ballads, drawing curious diagrams, and making\r\n    rude mechanical models. This absorption in such pursuits,\r\n    totally unintelligible to his schoolfellows (who were then\r\n    quite innocent of mathematics), of course procured him a not\r\n    very complimentary nickname, which I know is still remembered\r\n    by many Fellows of this Society. About the middle of his school\r\n    career, however, he surprised his companions by suddenly\r\n    becoming one of the most brilliant among them, gaining\r\n    high, and sometimes the highest, prizes for scholarships,\r\n    mathematics, and English verse composition. From this time\r\n    forward I became very intimate with him, and we discussed\r\n    together, with schoolboy enthusiasm, numerous curious\r\n    problems, among which I remember particularly the various plane\r\n    sections of a ring or tore, and the form of a cylindrical\r\n    mirror which should show one his own image unperverted. I\r\n    still possess some of the MSS. we exchanged in 1846 and early\r\n    in 1847. Those by Maxwell are on ‘The Conical Pendulum,’\r\n    ‘Descartes’ Ovals,’ ‘Meloid and Apioid,’ and ‘Trifocal Curves.’\r\n    All are drawn up in strict geometrical form and divided into\r\n    consecutive propositions. The three latter are connected with\r\n    his first published paper, communicated by Forbes to this\r\n    society and printed in our ‘Proceedings,’ vol. ii., under the\r\n    title, ‘On the Description of Oval Curves and those having a\r\n    Plurality of Foci’ (1846). At the time when these papers were\r\n    written he had received no instruction in mathematics beyond a\r\n    few books of Euclid and the merest elements of algebra.”\r\n\r\nIn November, 1847, Clerk Maxwell entered the University of Edinburgh,\r\nlearning mathematics from Kelland, natural philosophy from J. D.\r\nForbes, and logic from Sir W. R. Hamilton. At this time, according to\r\nProfessor Campbell[10]--\r\n\r\n    “he still occasioned some concern to the more conventional\r\n    amongst his friends by the originality and simplicity of his\r\n    ways. His replies in ordinary conversation were indirect and\r\n    enigmatical, often uttered with hesitation and in a monotonous\r\n    key. While extremely neat in his person, he had a rooted\r\n    objection to the vanities of starch and gloves. He had a pious\r\n    horror of destroying anything, even a scrap of writing-paper.\r\n    He preferred travelling by the third class in railway journeys,\r\n    saying he liked a hard seat. When at table he often seemed\r\n    abstracted from what was going on, being absorbed in observing\r\n    the effects of refracted light in the finger-glasses, or in\r\n    trying some experiment with his eyes--seeing round a corner,\r\n    making invisible stereoscopes, and the like. Miss Cay used\r\n    to call his attention by crying, ‘Jamsie, you’re in a prop.’\r\n    He never tasted wine; and he spoke to gentle and simple in\r\n    exactly the same tone. On the other hand, his teachers--Forbes\r\n    above all--had formed the highest opinion of his intellectual\r\n    originality and force; and a few experienced observers, in\r\n    watching his devotion to his father, began to have some inkling\r\n    of his heroic singleness of heart. To his college companions,\r\n    whom he could now select at will, his quaint humour was an\r\n    endless delight. His chief associates, after I went to the\r\n    University of Glasgow, were my brother, Robert Campbell (still\r\n    at the Academy), P. G. Tait, and Allan Stewart. Tait went\r\n    to Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1848, after one session of the\r\n    University of Edinburgh; Stewart to the same college in 1849;\r\n    Maxwell did not go up until 1850.”\r\n\r\nDuring this period he wrote two important papers. The one, on “Rolling\r\nCurves,” was read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh by Professor\r\nKelland--(“it was not thought proper for a boy in a round jacket to\r\nmount the rostrum”)--in February, 1849; the other, on “The Equilibrium\r\nof Elastic Solids,” appeared in the spring of 1850.\r\n\r\nThe vacations were spent at Glenlair, and we learn from letters to\r\nProfessor Campbell and others how the time was passed.\r\n\r\n“On Saturday,” he writes[11]--April 26th, 1848, just after his\r\narrival home--“the natural philosophers ran up Arthur’s Seat with the\r\nbarometer. The Professor set it down at the top.... He did not set it\r\nstraight, and made the hill grow fifty feet; but we got it down again.”\r\n\r\nIn a letter of July in the same year he describes his laboratory:--\r\n\r\n    “I have regularly set up shop now above the wash-house at the\r\n    gate, in a garret. I have an old door set on two barrels, and\r\n    two chairs, of which one is safe, and a skylight above which\r\n    will slide up and down.\r\n\r\n    “On the door (or table) there is a lot of bowls, jugs, plates,\r\n    jam pigs, etc., containing water, salt, soda, sulphuric acid,\r\n    blue vitriol, plumbago ore; also broken glass, iron, and copper\r\n    wire, copper and zinc plate, bees’ wax, sealing wax, clay,\r\n    rosin, charcoal, a lens, a Smee’s galvanic apparatus, and a\r\n    countless variety of little beetles, spiders, and wood lice,\r\n    which fall into the different liquids and poison themselves. I\r\n    intend to get up some more galvanism in jam pigs; but I must\r\n    first copper the interiors of the pigs, so I am experimenting\r\n    on the best methods of electrotyping. So I am making copper\r\n    seals with the device of a beetle. First, I thought a beetle\r\n    was a good conductor, so I embedded one in wax (not at all\r\n    cruel, because I slew him in boiling water, in which he never\r\n    kicked), leaving his back out; but he would not do. Then I took\r\n    a cast of him in sealing wax, and pressed wax into the hollow,\r\n    and blackleaded it with a brush; but neither would that do. So\r\n    at last I took my fingers and rubbed it, which I find the best\r\n    way to use the blacklead. Then it coppered famously. I melt out\r\n    the wax with the lens, that being the cleanest way of getting a\r\n    strong heat, so I do most things with it that need heat. To-day\r\n    I astonished the natives as follows. I took a crystal of blue\r\n    vitriol and put the lens to it, and so drove off the water,\r\n    leaving a white powder. Then I did the same to some washing\r\n    soda, and mixed the two white powders together, and made a\r\n    small native spit on them, which turned them green by a mutual\r\n    exchange, thus:--1. Sulphate of copper and carbonate of soda.\r\n    2. Sulphate of soda and carbonate of copper (blue or green).”\r\n\r\nOf his reading he says:--“I am reading Herodotus’ ‘Euterpe,’ having\r\ntaken the turn--that is to say that sometimes I can do props., read\r\nDiff. and Int. Calc., Poisson, Hamilton’s dissertation, etc.”\r\n\r\nIn September he was busy with polarised light. “We were at Castle\r\nDouglas yesterday, and got crystals of saltpetre, which I have been\r\ncutting up into plates to-day in hopes to see rings.”\r\n\r\nIn July, 1849, he writes[12]:--\r\n\r\n    “I have set up the machine for showing the rings in crystals,\r\n    which I planned during your visit last year. It answers very\r\n    well. I also made some experiments on compressed jellies in\r\n    illustration of my props. on that subject. The principal one\r\n    was this:--The jelly is poured while hot into the annular space\r\n    contained between a paper cylinder and a cork; then, when cold,\r\n    the cork is twisted round and the jelly exposed to polarised\r\n    light, when a transverse cross, X, not +, appears, with rings\r\n    as the inverse square of the radius, all which is fully\r\n    verified. Hip! etc. _Q.E.D._”\r\n\r\nAnd again on March 22nd, 1850:--\r\n\r\n    “At Practical Mechanics I have been turning Devils of sorts.\r\n    For private studies I have been reading Young’s ‘Lectures,’\r\n    Willis’s ‘Principles of Mechanism,’ Moseley’s ‘Engineering\r\n    and Mechanics,’ Dixon on ‘Heat,’ and Moigno’s ‘Répertoire\r\n    d’Optique.’ This last is a very complete analysis of all that\r\n    has been done in the optical way from Fresnel to the end of\r\n    1849, and there is another volume a-coming which will complete\r\n    the work. There is in it, besides common optics, all about the\r\n    other things which accompany light, as heat, chemical action,\r\n    photographic rays, action on vegetables, etc.\r\n\r\n    “My notions are rather few, as I do not _entertain_ them just\r\n    now. I have a notion for the torsion of wires and rods, not\r\n    to be made till the vacation; of experiments on the action of\r\n    compression on glass, jelly, etc., numerically done up; of\r\n    papers for the Physico-Mathematical Society (which is to revive\r\n    in earnest next session!); on the relations of optical and\r\n    mechanical constants, their desirableness, etc.; and suspension\r\n    bridges, and catenaries, and elastic curves. Alex. Campbell,\r\n    Agnew, and I are appointed to read up the subject of periodical\r\n    shooting stars, and to prepare a list of the phenomena to be\r\n    observed on the 9th August and 13th November. The society’s\r\n    barometer is to be taken up Arthur’s Seat at the end of the\r\n    session, when Forbes goes up, and All students are invited to\r\n    attend, so that the existence of the society may be recognised.”\r\n\r\nIt was at last settled that he was to go up to Cambridge. Tait had been\r\nat Peterhouse for two years, while Allan Stewart had joined him there\r\nin 1849, and after much discussion it was arranged that Maxwell should\r\nenter at the same college.\r\n\r\nOf this period of his life Tait writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n    “The winter of 1847 found us together in the classes of Forbes\r\n    and Kelland, where he highly distinguished himself. With the\r\n    former he was a particular favourite, being admitted to the\r\n    free use of the class apparatus for original experiments. He\r\n    lingered here behind most of his former associates, having\r\n    spent three years at the University of Edinburgh, working\r\n    (without any assistance or supervision) with physical and\r\n    chemical apparatus, and devouring all sorts of scientific\r\n    works in the library. During this period he wrote two valuable\r\n    papers, which are published in our ‘Transactions,’ on ‘The\r\n    Theory of Rolling Curves’ and on ‘The Equilibrium of Elastic\r\n    Solids.’ Thus he brought to Cambridge, in the autumn of 1850, a\r\n    mass of knowledge which was really immense for so young a man,\r\n    but in a state of disorder appalling to his methodical private\r\n    tutor. Though that tutor was William Hopkins, the pupil to a\r\n    great extent took his own way, and it may safely be said that\r\n    no high wrangler of recent years ever entered the Senate House\r\n    more imperfectly trained to produce ‘paying’ work than did\r\n    Clerk Maxwell. But by sheer strength of intellect, though with\r\n    the very minimum of knowledge how to use it to advantage under\r\n    the conditions of the examination, he obtained the position\r\n    of Second Wrangler, and was bracketed equal with the Senior\r\n    Wrangler in the higher ordeal of the Smith’s Prizes. His name\r\n    appears in the Cambridge ‘Calendar’ as Maxwell of Trinity,\r\n    but he was originally entered at Peterhouse, and kept his\r\n    first term there, in that small but most ancient foundation\r\n    which has of late furnished Scotland with the majority of the\r\n    professors of mathematics and natural philosophy in her four\r\n    universities.”\r\n\r\nWhile W. D. Niven, in his preface to Maxwell’s collected works (p.\r\nxii.), says:--\r\n\r\n    “It may readily be supposed that his preparatory training for\r\n    the Cambridge course was far removed from the ordinary type.\r\n    There had indeed for some time been practically no restraint\r\n    upon his plan of study, and his mind had been allowed to follow\r\n    its natural bent towards science, though not to an extent\r\n    so absorbing as to withdraw him from other pursuits. Though\r\n    he was not a sportsman--indeed, sport so-called was always\r\n    repugnant to him--he was yet exceedingly fond of a country\r\n    life. He was a good horseman and a good swimmer. Whence,\r\n    however, he derived his chief enjoyment may be gathered from\r\n    the account which Mr. Campbell gives of the zest with which he\r\n    quoted on one occasion the lines of Burns which describe the\r\n    poet finding inspiration while wandering along the banks of a\r\n    stream in the free indulgence of his fancies. Maxwell was not\r\n    only a lover of poetry, but himself a poet, as the fine pieces\r\n    gathered together by Mr. Campbell abundantly testify. He saw,\r\n    however, that his true calling was science, and never regarded\r\n    these poetical efforts as other than mere pastime. Devotion\r\n    to science, already stimulated by successful endeavour;\r\n    a tendency to ponder over philosophical problems; and an\r\n    attachment to English literature, particularly to English\r\n    poetry--these tastes, implanted in a mind of singular strength\r\n    and purity, may be said to have been the endowments with which\r\n    young Maxwell began his Cambridge career. Besides this, his\r\n    scientific reading, as we may gather from his papers to the\r\n    Royal Society of Edinburgh referred to above, was already\r\n    extensive and varied. He brought with him, says Professor Tait,\r\n    a mass of knowledge which was really immense for so young a\r\n    man, but in a state of disorder appalling to his methodical\r\n    private tutor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nUNDERGRADUATE LIFE AT CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaxwell did not remain long at Peterhouse; before the end of his\r\nfirst term he migrated to Trinity, and was entered under Dr. Thompson\r\nDecember 14th, 1850. He appeared to the tutor a shy and diffident\r\nyouth, but presently surprised Dr. Thompson by producing a bundle\r\nof papers--copies, probably, of those he had already published--and\r\nremarking, “Perhaps these may show that I am not unfit to enter at your\r\nCollege.”\r\n\r\nThe change was pressed upon him by many friends, the grounds of the\r\nadvice being that, from the large number of high wranglers recently\r\nat Peterhouse and the smallness of the foundation, the chances of a\r\nFellowship there for a mathematical man were less than at Trinity. It\r\nwas a step he never regretted; the prospect of a Fellowship had but\r\nlittle influence on his mind. He found, however, at the larger college\r\nampler opportunities for self-improvement, and it was possible for him\r\nto select his friends from among men whom he otherwise would never have\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe record of his undergraduate life is not very full; his letters to\r\nhis father have, unfortunately, been lost, but we have enough in the\r\nrecollections of friends still living to picture what it was like. At\r\nfirst he lodged in King’s Parade with an old Edinburgh schoolfellow,\r\nC. H. Robertson. He attended the College lectures on mathematics,\r\nthough they were somewhat elementary, and worked as a private pupil\r\nwith Porter, of Peterhouse. His father writes to him, November, 1850:\r\n“Have you called on Professors Sedgwick, at Trin., and Stokes, at\r\nPembroke? If not, you should do both. Stokes will be most in your line,\r\nif he takes you in hand at all. Sedgwick is also a great Don in his\r\nline, and, if you were entered in geology, would be a most valuable\r\nacquaintance.”\r\n\r\nIn his second year he became a pupil of Hopkins, the great coach; he\r\nalso attended Stokes’ lectures, and the friendship which lasted till\r\nhis death was thus begun. In April, 1852, he was elected a scholar,\r\nand obtained rooms in College (G, Old Court). In June, 1852, he came\r\nof age. “I trust you will be as discreet when major as you have been\r\nwhile minor,” writes his father the day before. The next academic\r\nyear, October, 1852, to June, 1853, was a very busy one; hard grind\r\nfor the Tripos occupied his time, and he seems to have been thoroughly\r\noverstrained. He was taken ill while staying near Lowestoft with the\r\nRev. C. B. Tayler, the uncle of a College friend. His own account of\r\nthe illness is given in a letter to Professor Campbell[13], dated July\r\n14th, 1853.\r\n\r\n    “You wrote just in time for your letter to reach me as I\r\n    reached Cambridge. After examination, I went to visit the\r\n    Rev. C. B. Tayler (uncle to a Tayler whom I think you have\r\n    seen under the name of _Freshman_, etc., and author of many\r\n    tracts and other didactic works). We had little expedites and\r\n    walks, and things parochial and educational, and domesticity.\r\n    I intended to return on the 18th June, but on the 17th I felt\r\n    unwell, and took measures accordingly to be well again--_i.e._\r\n    went to bed, and made up my mind to recover. But it lasted more\r\n    than a fortnight, during which time I was taken care of beyond\r\n    expectation (not that I did not expect much before). When I\r\n    was perfectly useless and could not sit up without fainting,\r\n    Mr. Tayler did everything for me in such a way that I had no\r\n    fear of giving trouble. So did Mrs. Tayler; and the two nephews\r\n    did all they could. So they kept me in great happiness all the\r\n    time, and detained me till I was able to walk about and got\r\n    back strength. I returned on the 4th July.\r\n\r\n    “The consequence of all this is that I correspond with Mr.\r\n    Tayler, and have entered into bonds with the nephews, of all of\r\n    whom more hereafter. Since I came here I have been attending\r\n    Hop., but, with his approval, did not begin full swing. I\r\n    am getting on, though, and the work is not grinding on the\r\n    prepared brain.”\r\n\r\nDuring this period he wrote some papers for the _Cambridge and Dublin\r\nMathematical Journal_ which will be referred to again later. He was\r\nalso a member of a discussion society known as the “Apostles,” and some\r\nof the essays contributed by him are preserved by Professor Campbell.\r\nMr. Niven, in his preface to the collected edition of Maxwell’s works,\r\nsuggests that the composition of these essays laid the foundation of\r\nthat literary finish which is one of the characteristics of Maxwell’s\r\nscientific writings.\r\n\r\nAmong his friends at the time were Tait, Charles Mackenzie of Caius,\r\nthe missionary bishop of Central Africa, Henry and Frank Mackenzie of\r\nTrinity, Droop, third Wrangler in 1854; Gedge, Isaac Taylor, Blakiston,\r\nF. W. Farrar,[14] H. M. Butler,[15] Hort, V. Lushington, Cecil Munro,\r\nG. W. H. Tayler, and W. N. Lawson. Some of these who survived him have\r\ngiven to Professor Campbell their recollections of these undergraduate\r\ndays, which are full of interest.\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Lawson writes[16]:--\r\n\r\n    “There must be many of his quaint verses about, if one could\r\n    lay hands on them, for Maxwell was constantly producing\r\n    something of the sort and bringing it round to his friends,\r\n    with a sly chuckle at the humour, which, though his own, no one\r\n    enjoyed more than himself.\r\n\r\n    “I remember Maxwell coming to me one morning with a copy of\r\n    verses beginning, ‘Gin a body meet a body going through the\r\n    air,’ in which he had twisted the well-known song into a\r\n    description of the laws of impact of solid bodies.\r\n\r\n    “There was also a description which Maxwell wrote of some\r\n    University ceremony--I forget what--in which somebody ‘went\r\n    before’ and somebody ‘followed after,’ and ‘in the midst were\r\n    the wranglers, playing with the symbols.’\r\n\r\n    “These last words, however meant, were, in fact, a description\r\n    of his own wonderful power. I remember, one day in lecture,\r\n    our lecturer had filled the black-board three times with\r\n    the investigation of some hard problem in Geometry of Three\r\n    Dimensions, and was not at the end of it, when Maxwell came up\r\n    with a question whether it would not come out geometrically,\r\n    and showed how, with a figure, and in a few lines, there was\r\n    the solution at once.\r\n\r\n    “Maxwell was, I daresay you remember, very fond of a talk upon\r\n    almost anything. He and I were pupils (at an enormous distance\r\n    apart) of Hopkins, and I well recollect how, when I had been\r\n    working the night before and all the morning at Hopkins’s\r\n    problems, with little or no result, Maxwell would come in for a\r\n    gossip, and talk on while I was wishing him far away, till at\r\n    last, about half an hour or so before our meeting at Hopkins’s,\r\n    he would say, ‘Well, I must go to old Hop.’s problems’; and, by\r\n    the time we met there, they were all done.\r\n\r\n    “I remember Hopkins telling me, when speaking of Maxwell,\r\n    either just before or just after his degree, ‘It is not\r\n    possible for that man to think incorrectly on physical\r\n    subjects’; and Hopkins, as you know, had had, perhaps, more\r\n    experience of mathematical minds than any man of his time.”\r\n\r\nThe last clause is part of a quotation from a diary kept by Mr. Lawson\r\nat Cambridge, in which, under the date July 15th, 1853, he writes:--\r\n\r\n    “He (Hopkins) was talking to me this evening about Maxwell.\r\n    He says he is unquestionably the most extraordinary man he\r\n    has met with in the whole range of his experience; he says\r\n    it appears impossible for Maxwell to think incorrectly on\r\n    physical subjects; that in his analysis, however, he is far\r\n    more deficient. He looks upon him as a great genius with all\r\n    its eccentricities, and prophesies that one day he will shine\r\n    as a light in physical science--a prophecy in which all his\r\n    fellow-students strenuously unite.”\r\n\r\nHow many who have struggled through the “Electricity and Magnetism”\r\nhave realised the truth of the remark about the correctness of his\r\nphysical intuitions and the deficiency at times of his analysis!\r\n\r\nDr. Butler, a friend of these early days, preached the University\r\nsermon on November 16th, 1879, ten days after Maxwell’s death, and\r\nspoke thus:--\r\n\r\n    “It is a solemn thing--even the least thoughtful is touched\r\n    by it--when a great intellect passes away into the silence\r\n    and we see it no more. Such a loss, such a void, is present,\r\n    I feel certain, to many here to-day. It is not often, even\r\n    in this great home of thought and knowledge, that so bright\r\n    a light is extinguished as that which is now mourned by many\r\n    illustrious mourners, here chiefly, but also far beyond this\r\n    place. I shall be believed when I say in all simplicity that I\r\n    wish it had fallen to some more competent tongue to put into\r\n    words those feelings of reverent affection which are, I am\r\n    persuaded, uppermost in many hearts on this Sunday. My poor\r\n    words shall be few, but believe me they come from the heart.\r\n    You know, brethren, with what an eager pride we follow the\r\n    fortunes of those whom we have loved and reverenced in our\r\n    undergraduate days. We may see them but seldom, few letters may\r\n    pass between us, but their names are never common names. They\r\n    never become to us only what other men are. When I came up to\r\n    Trinity twenty-eight years ago, James Clerk Maxwell was just\r\n    beginning his second year. His position among us--I speak in\r\n    the presence of many who remember that time--was unique. He was\r\n    the one acknowledged man of genius among the undergraduates. We\r\n    understood even then that, though barely of age, he was in his\r\n    own line of inquiry not a beginner but a master. His name was\r\n    already a familiar name to men of science. If he lived, it was\r\n    certain that he was one of that small but sacred band to whom\r\n    it would be given to enlarge the bounds of human knowledge.\r\n    It was a position which might have turned the head of a\r\n    smaller man; but the friend of whom we were all so proud, and\r\n    who seemed, as it were, to link us thus early with the great\r\n    outside world of the pioneers of knowledge, had one of those\r\n    rich and lavish natures which no prosperity can impoverish,\r\n    and which make faith in goodness easy for others. I have often\r\n    thought that those who never knew the grand old Adam Sedgwick\r\n    and the then young and ever-youthful Clerk Maxwell had yet to\r\n    learn the largeness and fulness of the moulds in which some\r\n    choice natures are framed. Of the scientific greatness of our\r\n    friend we were most of us unable to judge; but anyone could\r\n    see and admire the boy-like glee, the joyous invention, the\r\n    wide reading, the eager thirst for truth, the subtle thought,\r\n    the perfect temper, the unfailing reverence, the singular\r\n    absence of any taint of the breath of worldliness in any of its\r\n    thousand forms.\r\n\r\n    “Brethren, you may know such men now among your college\r\n    friends, though there can be but few in any year, or indeed in\r\n    any century, that possess the rare genius of the man whom we\r\n    deplore. If it be so, then, if you will accept the counsel of\r\n    a stranger, thank God for His gift. Believe me when I tell you\r\n    that few such blessings will come to you in later life. There\r\n    are blessings that come once in a lifetime. One of these is the\r\n    reverence with which we look up to greatness and goodness in\r\n    a college friend--above us, beyond us, far out of our mental\r\n    or moral grasp, but still one of us, near to us, our own. You\r\n    know, in part at least, how in this case the promise of youth\r\n    was more than fulfilled, and how the man who, but a fortnight\r\n    ago, was the ornament of the University, and--shall I be\r\n    wrong in saying it?--almost the discoverer of a new world of\r\n    knowledge, was even more loved than he was admired, retaining\r\n    after twenty years of fame that mirth, that simplicity, that\r\n    child-like delight in all that is fresh and wonderful which we\r\n    rejoice to think of as some of the surest accompaniment of true\r\n    scientific genius.\r\n\r\n    “You know, also, that he was a devout as well as thoughtful\r\n    Christian. I do not note this in the triumphant spirit of a\r\n    controversialist. I will not for a moment assume that there is\r\n    any natural opposition between scientific genius and simple\r\n    Christian faith. I will not compare him with others who have\r\n    had the genius without the faith. Christianity, though she\r\n    thankfully welcomes and deeply prizes them, does not need\r\n    now, any more than when St. Paul first preached the Cross at\r\n    Corinth, the speculations of the subtle or the wisdom of the\r\n    wise. If I wished to show men, especially young men, the living\r\n    force of the Gospel, I would take them not so much to a learned\r\n    and devout Christian man to whom all stores of knowledge were\r\n    familiar, but to some country village where for fifty years\r\n    there had been devout traditions and devout practice. There\r\n    they would see the Gospel lived out; truths, which other men\r\n    spoke of, seen and known; a spirit not of this world, visibly,\r\n    hourly present; citizenship in heaven daily assumed and daily\r\n    realised. Such characters I believe to be the most convincing\r\n    preachers to those who ask whether Revelation is a fable\r\n    and God an unknowable. Yes, in most cases--not, I admit, in\r\n    all--simple faith, even peradventure more than devout genius,\r\n    is mighty for removing doubts and implanting fresh conviction.\r\n    But having said this, we may well give thanks to God that our\r\n    friend was what he was, a firm Christian believer, and that his\r\n    powerful mind, after ranging at will through the illimitable\r\n    spaces of Creation and almost handling what he called ‘the\r\n    foundation-stones of the material universe,’ found its true\r\n    rest and happiness in the love and the mercy of Him whom the\r\n    humblest Christian calls his Father. Of such a man it may be\r\n    truly said that he had his citizenship in heaven, and that he\r\n    looked for, as a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, through whom\r\n    the unnumbered worlds were made, and in the likeness of whose\r\n    image our new and spiritual body will be fashioned.”\r\n\r\nThe Tripos came in January, 1854. “You will need to get muffetees for\r\nthe Senate Room. Take your plaid or rug to wrap round your feet and\r\nlegs,” was his father’s advice--advice which will appeal to many who\r\ncan remember the Senate House as it felt on a cold January morning.\r\n\r\nMaxwell had been preparing carefully for this examination. Thus to\r\nhis aunt, Miss Cay, in June, 1853, he writes:--“If anyone asks how I\r\nam getting on in mathematics, say that I am busy arranging everything\r\nso as to be able to express all distinctly, so that examiner may be\r\nsatisfied now and pupils edified hereafter. It is pleasant work and\r\nvery strengthening, but not nearly finished.”\r\n\r\nStill, the illness of July, 1853, had left some effect. Professor\r\nBaynes states that he said that on entering the Senate House for the\r\nfirst paper he felt his mind almost a blank, but by-and-by his mental\r\nvision became preternaturally clear.\r\n\r\nThe moderators were Mackenzie of Caius, whose advice had been mainly\r\ninstrumental in leading him to migrate to Trinity, Wm. Walton of\r\nTrinity, Wolstenholme of Christ’s, and Percival Frost of St. John’s.\r\n\r\nWhen the lists were published, Routh of Peterhouse was senior, Maxwell\r\nsecond. The examination for the Smith’s Prizes followed in a few days,\r\nand then Routh and Maxwell were declared equal.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Miss Cay[17] of January 13th, while waiting for the\r\nthree days’ list, he writes:--\r\n\r\n    “All my correspondents have been writing to me, which is kind,\r\n    and have not been writing questions, which is kinder. So I\r\n    answer you now, while I am slacking speed to get up steam,\r\n    leaving Lewis and Stewart, etc., till next week, when I will\r\n    give an account of the _five days_. There are a good many up\r\n    here at present, and we get on very jolly on the whole; but\r\n    some are not well, and some are going to be plucked or gulphed,\r\n    as the case may be, and others are reading so hard that they\r\n    are invisible. I go to-morrow to breakfast with shaky men, and\r\n    after food I am to go and hear the list read out, and whether\r\n    they are through, and bring them word. When the honour list\r\n    comes out the poll men act as messengers. Bob Campbell comes\r\n    in occasionally of an evening now, to discuss matters and vary\r\n    sports. During examination I have had men at night working with\r\n    gutta-percha, magnets, etc. It is much better than reading\r\n    novels or talking after 5½ hours’ hard writing.”\r\n\r\nHis father, on hearing the news, wrote from Edinburgh:--\r\n\r\n    “I heartily congratulate you on your place in the list. I\r\n    suppose it is higher than the speculators would have guessed,\r\n    and quite as high as Hopkins reckoned on. I wish you success\r\n    in the Smith’s Prizes; be sure to write me the result. I will\r\n    see Mrs. Morrieson, and I think I will call on Dr. Gloag to\r\n    congratulate him. He has at least three pupils gaining honours.”\r\n\r\nHis friends in Edinburgh were greatly pleased. “I get congratulations\r\non all hands,” his father writes,[18] “including Professor Kelland\r\nand Sandy Fraser and all others competent.... To-night or on Monday\r\nI shall expect to hear of the Smith’s Prizes.” And again, February\r\n6th, 1854:--“George Wedderburn came into my room at 2 a.m. yesterday\r\nmorning, having seen the Saturday _Times_, received by the express\r\ntrain.... As you are equal to the Senior in the champion trial, you are\r\nvery little behind him.”\r\n\r\nOr again, March 5th, 1854:--\r\n\r\n    “Aunt Jane stirred me up to sit for my picture, as she said you\r\n    wished for it and were entitled to ask for it _qua_ Wrangler. I\r\n    have had four sittings to Sir John Watson Gordon, and it is now\r\n    far advanced; I think it is very like. It is kitcat size, to be\r\n    a companion to Dyce’s picture of your mother and self, which\r\n    Aunt Jane says she is to leave to you.”\r\n\r\nAnd now the long years of preparation were nearly over. The cunning\r\ncraftsman was fitted with his tools; he could set to work to unlock the\r\nsecrets of Nature; he was free to employ his genius and his knowledge\r\non those tasks for which he felt most fitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEARLY RESEARCHES.--PROFESSOR AT ABERDEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this time on Maxwell’s life becomes a record of his writings\r\nand discoveries. It will, however, probably be clearest to separate\r\nas far as possible biographical details from a detailed account of\r\nhis scientific work, leaving this for consecutive treatment in later\r\nchapters, and only alluding to it so far as may prove necessary to\r\nexplain references in his letters.\r\n\r\nHe continued in Cambridge till the Long Vacation of 1854, reading\r\nMill’s “Logic.” “I am experiencing the effects of Mill,” he writes,\r\nMarch 25th, 1854, “but I take him slowly. I do not think him the last\r\nof his kind. I think more is wanted to bring the connexion of sensation\r\nwith science to light, and to show what it is not.” He also read\r\nBerkeley on “The Theory of Vision” and “greatly admired it.”\r\n\r\nAbout the same time he devised an ophthalmoscope.[19]\r\n\r\n    “I have made an instrument for seeing into the eye through\r\n    the pupil. The difficulty is to throw the light in at that\r\n    small hole and look in at the same time; but that difficulty\r\n    is overcome, and I can see a large part of the back of the eye\r\n    quite distinctly with the image of the candle on it. People\r\n    find no inconvenience in being examined, and I have got dogs\r\n    to sit quite still and keep their eyes steady. Dogs’ eyes are\r\n    very beautiful behind--a copper-coloured ground, with glorious\r\n    bright patches and networks of blue, yellow, and green, with\r\n    blood-vessels great and small.”\r\n\r\nAfter the vacation he returned to Cambridge, and the letters refer to\r\nthe colour-top. Thus to Miss Cay, November 24th, 1854, p. 208:--\r\n\r\n    “I have been very busy of late with various things, and am just\r\n    beginning to make papers for the examination at Cheltenham,\r\n    which I have to conduct about the 11th of December. I have\r\n    also to make papers to polish off my pups. with. I have been\r\n    spinning colours a great deal, and have got most accurate\r\n    results, proving that ordinary people’s eyes are all made\r\n    alike, though some are better than others, and that other\r\n    people see two colours instead of three; but all those who do\r\n    so agree amongst themselves. I have made a triangle of colours\r\n    by which you may make out everything.\r\n\r\n    “If you can find out any people in Edinburgh who do not see\r\n    colours (I know the Dicksons don’t), pray drop a hint that\r\n    I would like to see them. I have put one here up to a dodge\r\n    by which he distinguishes colours without fail. I have also\r\n    constructed a pair of squinting spectacles, and am beginning\r\n    operations on a squinting man.”\r\n\r\nA paper written for his own use originally some time in 1854, but\r\ncommunicated as a parting gift to his friend Farrar, who was about to\r\nbecome a master at Marlborough, gives us some insight into his view of\r\nlife at the age of twenty-three.\r\n\r\n    “He that would enjoy life and act with freedom must have the\r\n    work of the day continually before his eyes. Not yesterday’s\r\n    work, lest he fall into despair; nor to-morrow’s, lest he\r\n    become a visionary--not that which ends with the day, which is\r\n    a worldly work; nor yet that only which remains to eternity,\r\n    for by it he cannot shape his actions.\r\n\r\n    “Happy is the man who can recognise in the work of to-day a\r\n    connected portion of the work of life and an embodiment of\r\n    the work of Eternity. The foundations of his confidence are\r\n    unchangeable, for he has been made a partaker of Infinity. He\r\n    strenuously works out his daily enterprises because the present\r\n    is given him for a possession.\r\n\r\n    “Thus ought Man to be an impersonation of the divine process\r\n    of nature, and to show forth the union of the infinite with\r\n    the finite, not slighting his temporal existence, remembering\r\n    that in it only is individual action possible; nor yet shutting\r\n    out from his view that which is eternal, knowing that Time is\r\n    a mystery which man cannot endure to contemplate until eternal\r\n    Truth enlighten it.”\r\n\r\nHis father was unwell in the Christmas vacation of that year, and he\r\ncould not return to Cambridge at the beginning of the Lent term. “My\r\nsteps,” he writes[20] to C. J. Munro from Edinburgh, February 19th,\r\n1855, “will be no more by the reedy and crooked till Easter term.... I\r\nshould like to know how many kept bacalaurean weeks go to each of these\r\nterms, and when they begin and end. Overhaul the Calendar, and when\r\nfound make note of.”\r\n\r\nHe was back in Cambridge for the May term, working at the motion\r\nof fluids and at his colour-top. A paper on “Experiments on Colour\r\nas Perceived by the Eye” was communicated to the Royal Society of\r\nEdinburgh on March 19th, 1855. The experiments were shown to the\r\nCambridge Philosophical Society in May following, and the results are\r\nthus described in two letters[21] to his father, Saturday, May 5th,\r\n1855:\r\n\r\n    “The Royal Society have been very considerate in sending me my\r\n    paper on ‘Colours’ just when I wanted it for the Philosophical\r\n    here. I am to let them see the tricks on Monday evening,\r\n    and I have been there preparing their experiments in the\r\n    gaslight. There is to be a meeting in my rooms to-night to\r\n    discuss Adam Smith’s ‘Theory of Moral Sentiments,’ so I must\r\n    clear up my litter presently. I am working away at electricity\r\n    again, and have been working my way into the views of heavy\r\n    German writers. It takes a long time to reduce to order all\r\n    the notions one gets from these men, but I hope to see my way\r\n    through the subject and arrive at something intelligible in the\r\n    way of a theory....\r\n\r\n    “The colour trick came off on Monday, 7th. I had the\r\n    proof-sheets of my paper, and was going to read; but I changed\r\n    my mind and talked instead, which was more to the purpose.\r\n    There were sundry men who thought that blue and yellow make\r\n    green, so I had to undeceive them. I have got Hay’s book of\r\n    colours out of the Univ. Library, and am working through the\r\n    specimens, matching them with the top. I have a new trick of\r\n    stretching the string horizontally above the top, so as to\r\n    touch the upper part of the axis. The motion of the axis sets\r\n    the string a-vibrating in the same time with the revolutions of\r\n    the top, and the colours are seen in the haze produced by the\r\n    vibration. Thomson has been spinning the top, and he finds my\r\n    diagram of colours agrees with his experiments, but he doubts\r\n    about browns, what is their composition. I have got colcothar\r\n    brown, and can make white with it, and blue and green; also,\r\n    by mixing red with a little blue and green and a great deal of\r\n    black, I can match colcothar exactly.\r\n\r\n    “I have been perfecting my instrument for looking into the eye.\r\n    Ware has a little beast like old Ask, which sits quite steady\r\n    and seems to like being looked at, and I have got several men\r\n    who have large pupils and do not wish to let me look in. I\r\n    have seen the image of the candle distinctly in all the eyes I\r\n    have tried, and the veins of the retina were visible in some;\r\n    but the dogs’ eyes showed all the ramifications of veins, with\r\n    glorious blue and green network, so that you might copy down\r\n    everything. I have shown lots of men the image in my own eye by\r\n    shutting off the light till the pupil dilated and then letting\r\n    it on.\r\n\r\n    “I am reading Electricity and working at Fluid Motion, and have\r\n    got out the condition of a fluid being able to flow the same\r\n    way for a length of time and not wriggle about.”\r\n\r\nThe British Association met at Glasgow in September, 1855, and Maxwell\r\nwas present, and showed his colour-top at Professor Ramsay’s house to\r\nsome of those interested. Letters[22] to his father about this time\r\ndescribe some of the events of the meeting and his own plans for the\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n    “We had a paper from Brewster on ‘The theory of three colours\r\n    in the spectrum,’ in which he treated Whewell with philosophic\r\n    pity, commending him to the care of Prof. Wartman of Geneva,\r\n    who was considered the greatest authority in cases of his\r\n    kind--cases, in fact, of colour-blindness. Whewell was in the\r\n    room, but went out and avoided the quarrel; and Stokes made a\r\n    few remarks, stating the case not only clearly but courteously.\r\n    However, Brewster did not seem to see that Stokes admitted\r\n    his experiments to be correct, and the newspapers represented\r\n    Stokes as calling in question the accuracy of the experiments.\r\n\r\n    “I am getting my electrical mathematics into shape, and I see\r\n    through some parts which were rather hazy before; but I do not\r\n    find very much time for it at present, because I am reading\r\n    about heat and fluids, so as not to tell lies in my lectures.\r\n    I got a note from the Society of Arts about the platometer,\r\n    awarding thanks and offering to defray the expenses to the\r\n    extent of £10, on the machine being produced in working order.\r\n    When I have arranged it in my head, I intend to write to James\r\n    Bryson about it.\r\n\r\n    “I got a long letter from Thomson about colours and\r\n    electricity. He is beginning to believe in my theory about all\r\n    colours being capable of reference to three standard ones, and\r\n    he is very glad that I should poach on his electrical preserves.\r\n\r\n    “... It is difficult to keep up one’s interest in intellectual\r\n    matters when friends of the intellectual kind are scarce.\r\n    However, there are plenty friends not intellectual who serve\r\n    to bring out the active and practical habits of mind, which\r\n    overly-intellectual people seldom do. Wherefore, if I am to be\r\n    up this term, I intend to addict myself rather to the working\r\n    men who are getting up classes than to pups., who are in\r\n    the main a vexation. Meanwhile, there is the examination to\r\n    consider.\r\n\r\n    “You say Dr. Wilson has sent his book. I will write and thank\r\n    him. I suppose it is about colour-blindness. I intend to begin\r\n    Poisson’s papers on electricity and magnetism to-morrow. I have\r\n    got them out of the library. My reading hitherto has been of\r\n    novels--‘Shirley’ and ‘The Newcomes,’ and now ‘Westward Ho.’\r\n\r\n    “Macmillan proposes to get up a book of optics with my\r\n    assistance, and I feel inclined for the job. There is great\r\n    bother in making a mathematical book, especially on a subject\r\n    with which you are familiar, for in correcting it you do as\r\n    you would to pups.--look if the principle and result is right,\r\n    and forget to look out for small errors in the course of the\r\n    work. However, I expect the work will be salutary, as involving\r\n    hard work, and in the end much abuse from coaches and students,\r\n    and certainly no vain fame, except in Macmillan’s puffs. But,\r\n    if I have rightly conceived the plan of an educational book\r\n    on optics, it will be very different in manner, though not in\r\n    matter, from those now used.”\r\n\r\nThe examination referred to was that for a Fellowship at Trinity, and\r\nMaxwell was elected on October 10th, 1855.\r\n\r\nHe was immediately asked to lecture for the College, on hydrostatics\r\nand optics, to the upper division of the third year, and to set papers\r\nfor the questionists. In consequence, he declined to take pupils, in\r\norder to have time for reading and doing private mathematics, and for\r\nseeing the men who attended his lectures.\r\n\r\nIn November he writes: “I have been lecturing two weeks now, and the\r\nclass seems improving; and they come and ask questions, which is a good\r\nsign. I have been making curves to show the relations of pressure and\r\nvolume in gases, and they make the subject easier.”\r\n\r\nStill, he found time to attend Professor Willis’s lectures on mechanism\r\nand to continue his reading. “I have been reading,” he writes, “old\r\nbooks on optics, and find many things in them far better than what is\r\nnew. The foreign mathematicians are discovering for themselves methods\r\nwhich were well known at Cambridge in 1720, but are now forgotten.”\r\n\r\nThe “Poisson” was read to help him with his own views on electricity,\r\nwhich were rapidly maturing, and the first of that great series of\r\nworks which has revolutionised the science was published on December\r\n10th, 1855, when his paper on “Faraday’s Lines of Force” was read to\r\nthe Cambridge Philosophical Society.\r\n\r\nThe next term found him back in Cambridge at work on his lectures, full\r\nof plans for a new colour top and other matters. Early in February\r\nhe received a letter from Professor Forbes, telling him that the\r\nProfessorship of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, Aberdeen, was\r\nvacant, and suggesting that he should apply.\r\n\r\nHe decided to be a candidate if his father approved. “For my own part,”\r\nhe writes, “I think the sooner I get into regular work the better,\r\nand that the best way of getting into such work is to profess one’s\r\nreadiness by applying for it.” On the 20th of February he writes:\r\n“However, wisdom is of many kinds, and I do not know which dwells\r\nwith wise counsellors most, whether scientific, practical, political,\r\nor ecclesiastical. I hear there are candidates of all kinds relying\r\non the predominance of one or other of these kinds of wisdom in the\r\nconstitution of the Government.”\r\n\r\nThe second part of the paper on “Faraday’s Lines of Force” was read\r\nduring the term. Writing on the 4th of March, he expresses the hope\r\nsoon to be able to write out fully the paper. “I have done nothing\r\nin that way this term,” he says, “but am just beginning to feel the\r\nelectrical state come on again.”\r\n\r\nHis father was working at Edinburgh in support of his candidature for\r\nAberdeen, and when, in the middle of March, he returned North, he\r\nfound everything well prepared. The two returned to Glenlair together\r\nafter a few days in Edinburgh, and Maxwell was preparing to go back to\r\nCambridge, when, on the 2nd of April, his father died suddenly.\r\n\r\nWriting to Mrs. Blackburn, he says: “My father died suddenly to-day at\r\ntwelve o’clock. He had been giving directions about the garden, and he\r\nsaid he would sit down and rest a little, as usual. After a few minutes\r\nI asked him to lie down on the sofa, and he did not seem inclined to do\r\nso; and then I got him some ether, which had helped him before. Before\r\nhe could take any he had a slight struggle, and all was over. He hardly\r\nbreathed afterwards.”\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after this, Maxwell was appointed to Aberdeen. His\r\nfather’s death had frustrated some at least of the intentions with\r\nwhich he had applied for the post. He knew the old man would be glad\r\nto see him the occupant of a Scotch chair. He hoped, too, to be able to\r\nlive with his father at Glenlair for one half the year; but this was\r\nnot to be. No doubt the laboratory and the freedom of the post, when\r\ncompared with the routine work of preparing men for the Tripos, had\r\ntheir inducements; still, it may be doubted if the choice was a wise\r\none for him. The work of drilling classes, composed, for the most part,\r\nof raw untrained lads, in the elements of physics and mechanics was, as\r\nNiven says in his preface to the collected works, not that for which\r\nhe was best fitted; while at Cambridge, had he stayed, he must always\r\nhave had among his pupils some of the best mathematicians of the time;\r\nand he might have founded some ten or fifteen years before he did that\r\nCambridge School of Physicists which looks back with so much pride to\r\nhim as their master.\r\n\r\nLeave-taking at Trinity was a sad task. He writes[23] thus, June 4th,\r\nto Mr. R. B. Litchfield:--\r\n\r\n    “On Thursday evening I take the North-Western route to the\r\n    North. I am busy looking over immense rubbish of papers, etc.,\r\n    for some things not to be burnt lie among much combustible\r\n    matter, and some is soft and good for packing.\r\n\r\n    “It is not pleasant to go down to live solitary, but it would\r\n    not be pleasant to stay up either, when all one had to do lay\r\n    elsewhere. The transition state from a man into a Don must come\r\n    at last, and it must be painful, like gradual outrooting of\r\n    nerves. When it is done there is no more pain, but occasional\r\n    reminders from some suckers, tap-roots, or other remnants of\r\n    the old nerves, just to show what was there and what might have\r\n    been.”\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1856 was spent at Glenlair, where various friends were\r\nhis guests--Lushington, MacLennan, the two cousins Cay, and others.\r\nHe continued to work at optics, electricity, and magnetism, and in\r\nOctober was busy with “a solemn address or manifesto to the Natural\r\nPhilosophers of the North, which needed coffee and anchovies and a\r\nroaring hot fire and spread coat-tails to make it natural.” This was\r\nhis inaugural lecture.\r\n\r\nIn November he was at Aberdeen. Letters[24] to Miss Cay, Professor\r\nCampbell, and C. J. Munro tell of the work of the session. The last is\r\nfrom Glenlair, dated May 20th, 1857, after work was over.\r\n\r\n    “The session went off smoothly enough. I had Sun, all the\r\n    beginning of optics, and worked off all the experimental part\r\n    up to Fraunhofer’s lines, which were glorious to see with a\r\n    water-prism I have set up in the form of a cubical box, five\r\n    inch side....\r\n\r\n    “I succeeded very well with heat. The experiments on latent\r\n    heat came out very accurate. That was my part, and the class\r\n    could explain and work out the results better than I expected.\r\n    Next year I intend to mix experimental physics with mechanics,\r\n    devoting Tuesday and THURSDAY (what would Stokes say?) to the\r\n    science of experimenting accurately....\r\n\r\n    “Last week I brewed chlorophyll (as the chemists word it), a\r\n    green liquor, which turns the invisible light red....\r\n\r\n    “My last grind was the reduction of equations of colour which I\r\n    made last year. The result was eminently satisfactory.”\r\n\r\nAnother letter,[25] June 5th, 1857, also to Munro, refers to the work\r\nof the University Commission and the new statutes.\r\n\r\n    “I have not seen Article 7, but I agree with your dissent from\r\n    it entirely. On the vested interest principle, I think the\r\n    men who intended to keep their fellowships by celibacy and\r\n    ordination, and got them on that footing, should not be allowed\r\n    to desert the virgin choir or neglect the priestly office,\r\n    but on those principles should be allowed to live out their\r\n    days, provided the whole amount of souls cured annually does\r\n    not amount to £20 in the King’s Book. But my doctrine is that\r\n    the various grades of College officers should be set on such a\r\n    basis that, although chance lecturers might be sometimes chosen\r\n    from among fresh fellows who are going away soon, the reliable\r\n    assistant tutors, and those that have a plain calling that\r\n    way, should, after a few years, be elected permanent officers\r\n    of the College, and be tutors and deans in their time, and\r\n    seniors also, with leave to marry, or, rather, never prohibited\r\n    or asked any questions on that head, and with leave to retire\r\n    after so many years’ service as seniors. As for the men of the\r\n    world, we should have a limited term of existence, and that\r\n    independent of marriage or ‘parsonage.’”\r\n\r\nIt was more than twenty years before the scheme outlined in the above\r\nletter came to anything; but, at the time of Maxwell’s death in 1879,\r\nanother Commission was sitting, and the plan suggested by Maxwell\r\nbecame the basis of the statutes of nearly all the colleges.\r\n\r\nFor the winter session of 1857–58 he was again at Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nThe Adams Prize had been established in 1848 by some members of\r\nSt. John’s College, and connected by them with the name of Adams\r\n“in testimony of their sense of the honour he had conferred upon\r\nhis College and the University by having been the first among the\r\nmathematicians of Europe to determine from perturbations the unknown\r\nplace of a disturbing planet exterior to Uranus.” Professor Challis,\r\nDr. Parkinson, and Sir William Thomson, the examiners, had selected\r\nas the subject for the prize to be awarded in 1857 the “Motions of\r\nSaturn’s Rings.” For this Maxwell had decided to compete, and his\r\nletters at the end of 1857 tell of the progress of the task. Thus,\r\nwriting[26] to Lewis Campbell from Glenlair on August 28th, he says:--\r\n\r\n    “I have been battering away at Saturn, returning to the charge\r\n    every now and then. I have effected several breaches in the\r\n    solid ring, and now I am splash into the fluid one, amid a\r\n    clash of symbols truly astounding. When I reappear it will be\r\n    in the dusky ring, which is something like the state of the\r\n    air supposing the siege of Sebastopol conducted from a forest\r\n    of guns 100 miles one way, and 30,000 miles the other, and the\r\n    shot never to stop, but go spinning away round a circle, radius\r\n    170,000 miles.”\r\n\r\nAnd again[27] to Miss Cay on the 28th of November:--\r\n\r\n    “I have been pretty steady at work since I came. The class\r\n    is small and not bright, but I am going to give them plenty\r\n    to do from the first, and I find it a good plan. I have a\r\n    large attendance of my old pupils, who go on with the higher\r\n    subjects. This is not part of the College course, so they\r\n    come merely from choice, and I have begun with the least\r\n    amusing part of what I intend to give them. Many had been\r\n    reading in summer, for they did very good papers for me on\r\n    the old subjects at the beginning of the month. Most of my\r\n    spare time I have been doing Saturn’s rings, which is getting\r\n    on now, but lately I have had a great many long letters to\r\n    write--some to Glenlair, some to private friends, and some all\r\n    about science.... I have had letters from Thomson and Challis\r\n    about Saturn--from Hayward, of Durham University, about the\r\n    brass top, of which he wants one. He says that the earth has\r\n    been really found to change its axis regularly in the way I\r\n    supposed. Faraday has also been writing about his own subjects.\r\n    I have had also to write Forbes a long report on colours; so\r\n    that for every note I have got I have had to write a couple of\r\n    sheets in reply, and reporting progress takes a deal of writing\r\n    and spelling.”\r\n\r\nHe devised a model (now at the Cavendish Laboratory) to exhibit the\r\nmotions of the satellites in a disturbed ring, “for the edification of\r\nsensible image-worshippers.”\r\n\r\nThe essay was awarded the prize, and secured for its author great\r\ncredit among scientific men.\r\n\r\nIn another letter, written during the same session, he says: “I find my\r\nprincipal work here is teaching my men to avoid vague expressions, as\r\n‘a certain force,’ meaning uncertain; _may_ instead of _must_; _will\r\nbe_ instead of _is_; _proportional_ instead of _equal_.”\r\n\r\nThe death, during the autumn, of his College friend Pomeroy, from fever\r\nin India, was a great blow to him; his letters at the time show the\r\ndepth of his feelings and his beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe question of the fusion of the two Colleges at Aberdeen, King’s\r\nCollege and the Marischal College, was coming to the fore. “Know\r\nall men,” he says, in a letter to Professor Campbell, “that I am a\r\nFusionist.”\r\n\r\nIn February, 1858, he was still engaged on Saturn’s rings, while hard\r\nat work during the same time with his classes. He had established a\r\nvoluntary class for his students of the previous year, and was reading\r\nwith them Newton’s “Lunar Theory and Astronomy.” This was followed by\r\n“Electricity and Magnetism,” Faraday’s book being the backbone of\r\neverything, “as he himself is the nucleus of everything electric since\r\n1830.”\r\n\r\nIn February, 1858, he announced his engagement to Katherine Mary Dewar,\r\nthe daughter of the Principal of Marischal College.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Aunt” (he says,[28] February 18th, 1858), “this comes to\r\n    tell you that I am going to have a wife....\r\n\r\n    “Don’t be afraid; she is not mathematical, but there are other\r\n    things besides that, and she certainly won’t stop mathematics.\r\n    The only one that can speak as an eye-witness is Johnnie,\r\n    and he only saw her when we were both trying to act the\r\n    indifferent. We have been trying it since, but it would not do,\r\n    and it was not good for either.”\r\n\r\nThe wedding took place early in June. Professor Campbell has preserved\r\nsome of the letters written by Maxwell to Miss Dewar, and these\r\ncontain “the record of feelings which in the years that followed were\r\ntransfused in action and embodied in a married life which can only be\r\nspoken of as one of unexampled devotion.”\r\n\r\nThe project for the fusion of the two Colleges, to which reference has\r\nbeen made, went on, and the scheme was completed in 1860.\r\n\r\nThe two Colleges were united to form the University of Aberdeen, and\r\nthe new chair of Natural Philosophy thus created was filled by the\r\nappointment of David Thomson, Professor of Natural Philosophy in King’s\r\nCollege, and Maxwell’s senior. Mr. W. D. Niven, in his preface to\r\nMaxwell’s works, when dealing with this appointment, writes:--\r\n\r\n    “Professor Thomson, though not comparable to Maxwell as\r\n    a physicist, was nevertheless a remarkable man. He was\r\n    distinguished by singular force of character and great\r\n    administrative faculty, and he had been prominent in bringing\r\n    about the fusion of the Colleges. He was also an admirable\r\n    lecturer and teacher, and had done much to raise the standard\r\n    of scientific education in the north of Scotland. Thus the\r\n    choice made by the Commissioners, though almost inevitable,\r\n    had the effect of making it appear that Maxwell failed as a\r\n    teacher. There seems, however, to be no evidence to support\r\n    such an inference. On the contrary, if we may judge from the\r\n    number of voluntary students attending his classes in his last\r\n    College session, he would seem to have been as popular as a\r\n    professor as he was personally estimable.”\r\n\r\nThe question whether Maxwell was a great teacher has sometimes been\r\ndiscussed. I trust that the following pages will give an answer to\r\nit. He was not a prominent lecturer. As Professor Campbell says,[29]\r\n“Between his students’ ignorance and his vast knowledge it was\r\ndifficult to find a common measure. The advice which he once gave\r\nto a friend whose duty it was to preach to a country congregation,\r\n‘Why don’t you give it them thinner?’ must often have been applicable\r\nto himself.... Illustrations of _ignotum per ignotius_, or of the\r\nabstruse by some unobserved property of the familiar, were multiplied\r\nwith dazzling rapidity. Then the spirit of indirectness and paradox,\r\nthough he was aware of its dangers, would often take possession of him\r\nagainst his will, and, either from shyness or momentary excitement, or\r\nthe despair of making himself understood, would land him in ‘chaotic\r\nstatements,’ breaking off with some quirk of ironical humour.”\r\n\r\nBut teaching is not all done by lecturing. His books and papers are\r\nvast storehouses of suggestions and ideas which the ablest minds of the\r\npast twenty years have been since developing. To talk with him for an\r\nhour was to gain inspiration for a year’s work; to see his enthusiasm\r\nand to win his praise or commendation were enough to compensate for\r\nmany weary struggles over some stubborn piece of apparatus which would\r\nnot go right, or some small source of error which threatened to prove\r\nintractable and declined to submit itself to calculation. The sure\r\njudgment of posterity will confirm the verdict that Clerk Maxwell was a\r\ngreat teacher, though lecturing to a crowd of untrained undergraduates\r\nwas a task for which others were better fitted than he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR AT KING’S COLLEGE, LONDON.--LIFE AT GLENLAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1860 Forbes resigned the chair of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh.\r\nMaxwell and Tait were candidates, and Tait was appointed. In the\r\nsummer of the same year Maxwell obtained the vacant Professorship of\r\nNatural Philosophy at King’s College, London. This he held to 1865,\r\nand this period of his life is distinguished by the appearance of\r\nsome of his most important papers. The work was arduous; the College\r\ncourse extended over nine months of the year; there were as well\r\nevening lectures to artisans as part of his regular duties. His life in\r\nLondon was useful to him in the opportunities it gave him for becoming\r\npersonally acquainted with Faraday and others. He also renewed his\r\nintimacy with various Cambridge friends.\r\n\r\nHe was at the celebrated Oxford meeting of the British Association in\r\n1860, where he exhibited his colour-box for mixing the colours of the\r\nspectrum. In 1859, at the meeting at Aberdeen, he had read to Section\r\nA his first paper on the “Dynamical Theory of Gases,” published in the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_ for January, 1860. The second part of the\r\npaper, dealing with the conduction of heat and other phenomena in a\r\ngas, was published in July, 1860, after the Oxford meeting.\r\n\r\nA paper on the “Theory of Compound Colours” was communicated to\r\nthe Royal Society by Professor Stokes in January, 1860. It contains\r\nthe account of his colour-box in the form finally adopted (most of\r\nthe important parts of the apparatus are still at the Cavendish\r\nLaboratory), and a number of observations by Mrs. Maxwell and himself,\r\nwhich will be more fully described later.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1860, he received for this work the Rumford medal of the\r\nRoyal Society.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1861, is of great importance in the history of\r\nelectrical science. The British Association met at Manchester, and a\r\nCommittee was appointed on Standards of Electrical Resistance. Maxwell\r\nwas not a member. The committee reported at the Cambridge meeting in\r\n1862, and were reappointed with extended duties. Maxwell’s name, among\r\nothers, was added, and he took a prominent part in the deliberations\r\nof the committee, which, as their Report[30] presented in 1863 states,\r\ncame to the opinion, “after mature consideration, that the system\r\nof so-called absolute electrical units, based on purely mechanical\r\nmeasurements, is not only the best system yet proposed, but is the\r\nonly one consistent with our present knowledge both of the relations\r\nexisting between the various electrical phenomena and of the connection\r\nbetween these and the fundamental measurements of time, space, and\r\nmass.”\r\n\r\nAppendix C of this Report, “On the Elementary Relations between\r\nElectrical Measurements,” bears the names of Clerk Maxwell and Fleeming\r\nJenkin, and is the foundation of everything that has been done in the\r\nway of absolute electrical measurement since that date; while Appendix\r\nD gives an account by the same two workers of the experiments on the\r\nabsolute unit of electrical resistance made in the laboratory of King’s\r\nCollege by Maxwell, Fleeming Jenkin, and Balfour Stewart. Further\r\nexperiments are described in the report for 1864. The work thus begun\r\nwas consummated during the year 1894 by the legalisation throughout\r\nthe civilised world of a system of electrical units based on those\r\ndescribed in these reports.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Maxwell’s views on electro-magnetic theory were quietly\r\ndeveloping. Papers on “Physical Lines of Force,” which appeared in the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_ during 1861 and 1862, contain the germs of\r\nhis theory--expressed at that time, it is true, in a somewhat material\r\nform. In the paper published January, 1862, the now well-known relation\r\nbetween the ratio of the electric units and the velocity of light was\r\nestablished, and his correspondence with Fleeming Jenkin and C. J.\r\nMunro about this time relates in part to the experimental verification\r\nof this relation. His experiments on this matter were published in the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions” for 1868.\r\n\r\nThis electrical theory occupied his mind mainly during 1863 and 1864.\r\nIn September of the latter year he writes[31] from Glenlair to C.\r\nHockin, who had taken Balfour Stewart’s place during the second series\r\nof experiments on the measurement of resistance.\r\n\r\n    “I have been doing several electrical problems. I have got a\r\n    theory of ‘electric absorption,’ _i.e._, residual charge, etc.,\r\n    and I very much want determinations of the specific induction,\r\n    electric resistance, and absorption of good dielectrics, such\r\n    as glass, shell-lac, gutta-percha, ebonite, sulphur, etc.\r\n\r\n    “I have also cleared the electromagnetic theory of light from\r\n    all unwarrantable assumption, so that we may safely determine\r\n    the velocity of light by measuring the attraction between\r\n    bodies kept at a given difference of potential, the value of\r\n    which is known in electromagnetic measure.\r\n\r\n    “I hope there will be resistance coils at the British\r\n    Association.”\r\n\r\nThis work resulted in his greatest electrical paper, “A Dynamical\r\nTheory of the Electromagnetic Field,” read to the Royal Society\r\nDecember 8th, 1864.\r\n\r\nBut the molecular theory of gases was still prominently before his mind.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, writing[32] to H. R. Droop, he says:--\r\n\r\n    “Some time ago, when investigating Bernoulli’s theory of gases,\r\n    I was surprised to find that the internal friction of a gas (if\r\n    it depends on the collision of particles) should be independent\r\n    of the density.\r\n\r\n    “Stokes has been examining Graham’s experiments on the rate\r\n    of flow of gases through fine tubes, and he finds that the\r\n    friction, if independent of density, accounts for Graham’s\r\n    results; but, if taken proportional to density, differs from\r\n    those results very much. This seems rather a curious result,\r\n    and an additional phenomenon, explained by the ‘collision of\r\n    particles’ theory of gases. Still one phenomenon goes against\r\n    that theory--the relation between specific heat at constant\r\n    pressure and at constant volume, which is in air = 1·408, while\r\n    it ought to be 1·333.”\r\n\r\nAnd again[33] in the same year, 21st April, 1862, to Lewis Campbell:--\r\n\r\n    “Herr Clausius of Zürich, one of the heat philosophers, has\r\n    been working at the theory of gases being little bodies flying\r\n    about, and has found some cases in which he and I don’t tally.\r\n    So I am working it out again. Several experimental results have\r\n    turned up lately rather confirmatory than otherwise of that\r\n    theory.\r\n\r\n    “I hope you enjoy the absence of pupils. I find the division of\r\n    them into smaller classes is a great help to me and to them;\r\n    but the total oblivion of them for definite intervals is a\r\n    necessary condition for doing them justice at the proper time.”\r\n\r\nThe experiments on the viscosity of gases, which formed the Bakerian\r\nLecture to the Royal Society read on February 8th, 1866, were the\r\noutcome of this work. His house in 8, Palace Gardens, Kensington,\r\ncontained a large garret running the complete length.\r\n\r\n“To maintain the proper temperature a large fire was for some days kept\r\nup in the room in the midst of very hot weather. Kettles were kept on\r\nthe fire and large quantities of steam allowed to flow into the room.\r\nMrs. Maxwell acted as stoker, which was very exhausting work when\r\nmaintained for several consecutive hours. After this the room was kept\r\ncool for subsequent experiments by the employment of a considerable\r\namount of ice.”\r\n\r\nNext year, May, 1866, was read his paper on the “Dynamical Theory of\r\nGases,” in which errors in his former papers, which had been pointed\r\nout by Clausius, were corrected.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he had resigned his London Professorship at the end of the\r\nSession of 1865, and had been succeeded by Professor W. G. Adams.\r\n\r\nFor the next four years he lived chiefly at Glenlair, working at his\r\ntheory of electricity, occasionally, as we shall see, visiting London\r\nand Cambridge, and taking an active interest in the affairs of his\r\nown neighbourhood. In 1865 he had a serious illness, through which he\r\nwas nursed with great care by Mrs. Maxwell. His correspondence was\r\nconsiderable, and absorbed much of his time. Much also was given to the\r\nstudy of English literature; he was fond of reading Chaucer, Milton, or\r\nShakespeare aloud to Mrs. Maxwell.\r\n\r\nHe also read much theological and philosophical literature, and all he\r\nread helped only to strengthen that firm faith in the fundamentals of\r\nChristianity in which he lived and died.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 he and Mrs. Maxwell paid a visit to Italy, which was a source\r\nof great pleasure to both.\r\n\r\nHis chief scientific work was the preparation of his “Electricity and\r\nMagnetism,” which did not appear till 1873; the time was in the main\r\none of quiet thought and preparation for his next great task, the\r\nfoundation of the School of Physics in Cambridge.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the principalship of the United College in the University of\r\nSt. Andrews was vacant by the resignation of Forbes, and Maxwell was\r\ninvited by several of the professors to stand. He, however, declined to\r\nsubmit his name to the Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE.--PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his retirement at Glenlair from 1865 to 1870 Maxwell was\r\nfrequently at Cambridge. He examined in the Mathematical Tripos in 1866\r\nand 1867, and again in 1869 and 1870.\r\n\r\nThe regulations for the Tripos had been in force practically unchanged\r\nsince 1848, and it was felt by many that the range of subjects included\r\nwas not sufficiently extensive, and that changes were urgently needed\r\nif Cambridge were to retain its position as the centre of mathematical\r\nteaching. Natural Philosophy was mentioned in the Schedule, but Natural\r\nPhilosophy included only Dynamics and Astronomy, Hydrostatics and\r\nPhysical Optics, with some simple Hydrodynamics and Sound.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of Heat, Electricity and Magnetism, the Theory of Elastic\r\nSolids and Vibrations, Vortex-Motion in Hydrodynamics, and much else,\r\nwere practically new since 1848. Stokes, Thomson, and Maxwell in\r\nEngland, and Helmholtz in Germany, had created them.\r\n\r\nAccordingly in June, 1868, a new plan of examinations was sanctioned\r\nby the Senate to come into force in January, 1873, and these various\r\nsubjects were explicitly included.\r\n\r\nMr. Niven, who was one of those examined by Maxwell in 1866, writes in\r\nthe preface to the collected works:--\r\n\r\n    “For some years previous to 1866, when Maxwell returned to\r\n    Cambridge as Moderator in the Mathematical Tripos, the studies\r\n    in the University had lost touch with the great scientific\r\n    movements going on outside her walls. It was said that some\r\n    of the subjects most in vogue had but little interest for the\r\n    present generation, and loud complaints began to be heard\r\n    that while such branches of knowledge as Heat, Electricity,\r\n    and Magnetism were left out of the Tripos examination, the\r\n    candidates were wasting their time and energy upon mathematical\r\n    trifles barren of scientific interest and of practical results.\r\n    Into the movement for reform Maxwell entered warmly. By his\r\n    questions in 1866, and subsequent years, he infused new life\r\n    into the examination; he took an active part in drafting the\r\n    new scheme introduced in 1873; but most of all by his writings\r\n    he exerted a powerful influence on the younger members of the\r\n    University, and was largely instrumental in bringing about the\r\n    change which has been now effected.”\r\n\r\nBut the University possessed no means of teaching these subjects, and a\r\nSyndicate or Committee was appointed, November 25th, 1868, “to consider\r\nthe best means of giving instruction to students in Physics, especially\r\nin Heat, Electricity and Magnetism, and the methods of providing\r\napparatus for this purpose.”\r\n\r\nDr. Cookson, Master of St. Peter’s College, took an active part in the\r\nwork of the Syndicate. Professor Stokes, Professor Liveing, Professor\r\nHumphry, Dr. Phear, and Dr. Routh were among the members. Maxwell\r\nhimself was in Cambridge that winter, as Examiner for the Tripos, and\r\nhis work as Moderator and Examiner in the two previous years had done\r\nmuch to show the necessity of alterations and to indicate the direction\r\nwhich changes should take.\r\n\r\nThe Syndicate reported February 27th, 1869. They called attention to\r\nthe Report of the Royal Commission of 1850. The Commissioners had\r\n“prominently urged the importance of cultivating a knowledge of the\r\ngreat branches of Experimental Physics in the University”; and in\r\npage 118 of their Report, after commending the manner in which the\r\nsubject of Physical Optics is studied in the University, and pointing\r\nout that “there is, perhaps, no public institution where it is better\r\nrepresented or prosecuted with more zeal and success in the way of\r\noriginal research,” they had stated that “no reason can be assigned\r\nwhy other great branches of Natural Science should not become equally\r\nobjects of attention, or why Cambridge should not become a great school\r\nof physical and experimental, as it is already of mathematical and\r\nclassical, instruction.”\r\n\r\nAnd again the Commissioners remark: “In a University so thoroughly\r\nimbued with the mathematical spirit, physical study might be expected\r\nto assume within its precincts its highest and severest tone, be\r\nstudied under more abstract forms, with more continual reference to\r\nmathematical laws, and therefore with better hope of bringing them one\r\nby one under the domain of mathematical investigation than elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nAfter calling attention to these statements the Report of the Syndicate\r\nthen continues:--\r\n\r\n“In the scheme of Examination for Honours in the Mathematical Tripos\r\napproved by Grace of the Senate on the 2nd of June, 1868, Heat,\r\nElectricity and Magnetism, if not introduced for the first time, had a\r\nmuch greater degree of importance assigned to them than at any previous\r\nperiod, and these subjects will henceforth demand a corresponding\r\namount of attention from the candidates for Mathematical Honours. The\r\nSyndicate have limited their attention almost entirely to the question\r\nof providing public instruction in Heat, Electricity and Magnetism.\r\nThey recognise the importance and advantage of tutorial instruction in\r\nthese subjects in the several colleges, but they are also alive to the\r\ngreat impulse given to studies of this kind, and to the large amount of\r\nadditional training which students may receive through the instruction\r\nof a public Professor, and by knowledge gained in a well-appointed\r\nlaboratory.”\r\n\r\n“In accordance with these views, and at an early period in their\r\ndeliberations, they requested the Professors[34] of the University, who\r\nare engaged in teaching Mathematical and Physical Science, to confer\r\ntogether upon the present means of teaching Experimental Physics,\r\nespecially Heat, Electricity and Magnetism, and to inform them how the\r\nincreased requirements of the University in this respect could be met\r\nby them.”\r\n\r\n“The Professors, so consulted, favoured the Syndicate with a report\r\non the subject, which the Syndicate now beg leave to lay before the\r\nSenate. It points out how the requirements of the University might\r\nbe “partially met,” but the Professors state distinctly that they\r\n“do not think that they are able to meet the want of an extensive\r\ncourse of lectures on Physics treated as such, and in great measure\r\nexperimentally. As Experimental Physics may fairly be considered\r\nto come within the province of one or more of the above-mentioned\r\nProfessors, the Syndicate have considered whether now or at some\r\nfuture time some arrangement might not be made to secure the effective\r\nteaching of this branch of science, without having resort to the\r\nservices of an additional Professor. They are, however, of opinion that\r\nsuch an arrangement cannot be made at the present time, and that the\r\nexigencies of the case may be best met by founding a new professorship\r\nwhich shall terminate with the tenure of office of the Professor first\r\nelected. The services of a man of the highest attainments in science,\r\ndevoting his life to public teaching as such Professor, and engaged in\r\noriginal research, would be of incalculable benefit to the University.”\r\n\r\nThe Report goes on to point out that a laboratory would be necessary,\r\nand also apparatus. It is estimated that £5,000 would cover the cost\r\nof the laboratory, and £1,300 the necessary apparatus. Provision is\r\nalso made for a demonstrator and a laboratory assistant, and the Report\r\ncloses with a recommendation that a special Syndicate of Finance should\r\nbe appointed to consider the means of raising the funds.\r\n\r\nThe Professors in their Report to the Syndicate point out that teaching\r\nin Experimental Physics is needed for the Mathematical Tripos, the\r\nNatural Sciences Tripos, certain Special examinations, and the first\r\nexamination for the degree of M.B. It appeared to them clear that there\r\nwas work for a new Professor.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1869, the Financial Syndicate recommended by the above Report\r\nwas appointed “to consider the means of raising the necessary funds for\r\nestablishing a professor and demonstrator of Experimental Physics, and\r\nfor providing buildings and apparatus required for that department of\r\nscience, and further to consider other wants of the University, and the\r\nsources from which those wants may be supplied.”\r\n\r\nThe Syndicate endeavoured to meet the expenditure by inquiry from the\r\nseveral Colleges whether they would be willing to make contributions\r\nfrom their corporate funds, but without success.\r\n\r\n“The answers of the Colleges indicated such a want of concurrence\r\nin any proposal to raise contributions from the corporate funds of\r\nColleges by any kind of direct taxation that the Syndicate felt\r\nobliged to abandon the notion of obtaining the necessary funds from\r\nthis source, and accordingly to limit the number of objects which they\r\nshould recommend the Senate to accomplish.”\r\n\r\nExternal authority was necessary before the colleges would submit\r\nto taxation for University purposes, and it was left to the Royal\r\nCommission of 1877 to carry into effect many of the suggestions\r\nmade by the Syndicate. Meanwhile they contented themselves with\r\nrecommending means for raising an annual stipend of £660 for the\r\nprofessor, demonstrator, and assistant, and a capital sum of £5,000, or\r\nthereabouts, for the expenses of a building.\r\n\r\nThe Syndicate’s Report was issued in an amended form in the May term of\r\n1870, and before any decision was taken on it the Vice-Chancellor, Dr.\r\nAtkinson, on October 13th, 1870, published “the following munificent\r\noffer of his grace the Duke of Devonshire, the Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity,” who had been chairman of the Commission on Scientific\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n                                 “Holker Hall, Grange, Lancashire.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR MR. VICE-CHANCELLOR,--I have the honour to address you\r\n    for the purpose of making an offer to the University, which, if\r\n    you see no objection, I shall be much obliged to you to submit\r\n    in such manner as you may think fit for the consideration of\r\n    the Council and the University.\r\n\r\n    “I find in the report dated February 29th, 1869, of the\r\n    Physical Science Syndicate, recommending the establishment of\r\n    a Professor and Demonstrator of Experimental Physics, that the\r\n    buildings and apparatus required for this department of science\r\n    are estimated to cost £6,300.\r\n\r\n    “I am desirous to assist the University in carrying this\r\n    recommendation into effect, and shall accordingly be prepared\r\n    to provide the funds required for the building and apparatus as\r\n    soon as the University shall have in other respects completed\r\n    its arrangements for teaching Experimental Physics, and shall\r\n    have approved the plan of the building.\r\n\r\n                         “I remain, my dear Mr. Vice-Chancellor,\r\n                                     “Yours very faithfully,\r\n                                                   “DEVONSHIRE.”\r\n\r\nBy his generous action the University was relieved from all expense\r\nconnected with the building. A Grace establishing a Professorship of\r\nExperimental Physics was confirmed by the Senate February 9th, 1871,\r\nand March 8th was fixed for the election.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile who was to be Professor? Sir W. Thomson’s name had been\r\nmentioned, but he, it was known, would not accept the post. Maxwell\r\nwas then applied to, and at first he was unwilling to leave Glenlair.\r\nProfessor Stokes, the Hon. J. W. Strutt (Lord Rayleigh), Mr. Blore\r\nof Trinity, and others wrote to him. Lord Rayleigh’s letter[35] is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                              “Cambridge, 14th February, 1871.\r\n\r\n    “When I came here last Friday I found everyone talking about\r\n    the new professorship, and hoping that you would come. Thomson,\r\n    it seems, has definitely declined.... There is no one here in\r\n    the least fit for the post. What is wanted by most who know\r\n    anything about it is not so much a lecturer as a mathematician\r\n    who has actual experience in experimenting, and who might\r\n    direct the energies of the younger Fellows and bachelors into\r\n    a proper channel. There must be many who would be willing to\r\n    work under a competent man, and who, while learning themselves,\r\n    would materially assist him.... I hope you may be induced to\r\n    come; if not, I don’t know who it is to be. Do not trouble to\r\n    answer me about this, as I believe others have written to you\r\n    about it.”\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of February, Maxwell wrote to Mr. Blore:--\r\n\r\n    “I had no intention of applying for the post when I got your\r\n    letter, and I have none now, unless I come to see that I can do\r\n    some good by it.” The letter continues:--“The class of Physical\r\n    Investigations, which might be undertaken with the help of men\r\n    of Cambridge education, and which would be creditable to the\r\n    University, demand in general a considerable amount of dull\r\n    labour, which may or may not be attractive to the pupils.”\r\n\r\nHowever, on the 24th of February, Mr. Blore wrote to the Electoral\r\nRoll:--\r\n\r\n“I am authorised to give notice that Mr. John (_sic_) Clerk Maxwell,\r\nF.R.S., formerly Professor of Natural Philosophy at Aberdeen, and\r\nat King’s College, London, is a candidate for the professorship of\r\nExperimental Physics.”\r\n\r\nMaxwell was elected without opposition. Writing[36] to his wife from\r\nCambridge, 20th March, 1871, he says:--\r\n\r\n    “There are two parties about the professorship. One wants\r\n    popular lectures, and the other cares more for experimental\r\n    work. I think there should be a gradation--popular lectures and\r\n    rough experiments for the masses; real experiments for real\r\n    students; and laborious experiments for first-rate men like\r\n    Trotter and Stuart and Strutt.”\r\n\r\nWhile in a letter[37] from Glenlair to C. J. Munro, dated March 15th,\r\n1871, he writes:--“The Experimental Physics at Cambridge is not built\r\nyet, but we are going to try. The desideratum is to set a Don and a\r\nFreshman to observe and register (say) the vibrations of a magnet\r\ntogether, or the Don to turn a watch and the Freshman to observe and\r\ngovern him.”\r\n\r\nIn October he delivered his Introductory Lecture. A few quotations will\r\nshow the spirit in which he approached his task.\r\n\r\n    “In a course of Experimental Physics we may consider either\r\n    the Physics or the Experiments as the leading feature. We may\r\n    either employ the experiments to illustrate the phenomena of\r\n    a particular branch of Physics, or we may make some physical\r\n    research in order to exemplify a particular experimental\r\n    method. In the order of time, we should begin, in the Lecture\r\n    Room, with a course of lectures on some branch of Physics\r\n    aided by experiments of illustration, and conclude, in the\r\n    Laboratory, with a course of experiments of research.\r\n\r\n    “Let me say a few words on these two classes of\r\n    experiments--Experiments of Illustration and Experiments of\r\n    Research. The aim of an experiment of illustration is to throw\r\n    light upon some scientific idea so that the student may be\r\n    enabled to grasp it. The circumstances of the experiment are\r\n    so arranged that the phenomenon which we wish to observe or to\r\n    exhibit is brought into prominence, instead of being obscured\r\n    and entangled among other phenomena, as it is when it occurs\r\n    in the ordinary course of nature. To exhibit illustrative\r\n    experiments, to encourage others to make them, and to cultivate\r\n    in every way the ideas on which they throw light, forms an\r\n    important part of our duty. The simpler the materials of an\r\n    illustrative experiment, and the more familiar they are to the\r\n    student, the more thoroughly is he likely to acquire the idea\r\n    which it is meant to illustrate. The educational value of such\r\n    experiments is often inversely proportional to the complexity\r\n    of the apparatus. The student who uses home-made apparatus,\r\n    which is always going wrong, often learns more than one who has\r\n    the use of carefully adjusted instruments, to which he is apt\r\n    to trust, and which he dares not take to pieces.\r\n\r\n    “It is very necessary that those who are trying to learn from\r\n    books the facts of physical science should be enabled by the\r\n    help of a few illustrative experiments to recognise these facts\r\n    when they meet with them out of doors. Science appears to us\r\n    with a very different aspect after we have found out that it is\r\n    not in lecture-rooms only, and by means of the electric light\r\n    projected on a screen, that we may witness physical phenomena,\r\n    but that we may find illustrations of the highest doctrines of\r\n    science in games and gymnastics, in travelling by land and by\r\n    water, in storms of the air and of the sea, and wherever there\r\n    is matter in motion.\r\n\r\n    “If, therefore, we desire, for our own advantage and for the\r\n    honour of our University, that the Devonshire Laboratory should\r\n    be successful, we must endeavour to maintain it in living union\r\n    with the other organs and faculties of our learned body. We\r\n    shall therefore first consider the relation in which we stand\r\n    to those mathematical studies which have so long flourished\r\n    among us, which deal with our own subjects, and which differ\r\n    from our experimental studies only in the mode in which they\r\n    are presented to the mind.\r\n\r\n    “There is no more powerful method for introducing knowledge\r\n    into the mind than that of presenting it in as many different\r\n    ways as we can. When the ideas, after entering through\r\n    different gateways, effect a junction in the citadel of the\r\n    mind, the position they occupy becomes impregnable. Opticians\r\n    tell us that the mental combination of the views of an object\r\n    which we obtain from stations no further apart than our two\r\n    eyes is sufficient to produce in our minds an impression of the\r\n    solidity of the object seen; and we find that this impression\r\n    is produced even when we are aware that we are really looking\r\n    at two flat pictures placed in a stereoscope. It is therefore\r\n    natural to expect that the knowledge of physical science\r\n    obtained by the combined use of mathematical analysis and\r\n    experimental research will be of a more solid, available, and\r\n    enduring kind than that possessed by the mere mathematician or\r\n    the mere experimenter.\r\n\r\n    “But what will be the effect on the University if men pursuing\r\n    that course of reading which has produced so many distinguished\r\n    Wranglers turn aside to work experiments? Will not their\r\n    attendance at the Laboratory count not merely as time withdrawn\r\n    from their more legitimate studies, but as the introduction of\r\n    a disturbing element, tainting their mathematical conceptions\r\n    with material imagery, and sapping their faith in the formulæ\r\n    of the text-books? Besides this, we have already heard\r\n    complaints of the undue extension of our studies, and of the\r\n    strain put upon our questionists by the weight of learning\r\n    which they try to carry with them into the Senate-House. If we\r\n    now ask them to get up their subjects not only by books and\r\n    writing, but at the same time by observation and manipulation,\r\n    will they not break down altogether? The Physical Laboratory,\r\n    we are told, may perhaps be useful to those who are going out\r\n    in Natural Science, and who do not take in Mathematics, but\r\n    to attempt to combine both kinds of study during the time of\r\n    residence at the University is more than one mind can bear.\r\n\r\n    “No doubt there is some reason for this feeling. Many of us\r\n    have already overcome the initial difficulties of mathematical\r\n    training. When we now go on with our study, we feel that it\r\n    requires exertion and involves fatigue, but we are confident\r\n    that if we only work hard our progress will be certain.\r\n\r\n    “Some of us, on the other hand, may have had some experience\r\n    of the routine of experimental work. As soon as we can read\r\n    scales, observe times, focus telescopes, and so on, this kind\r\n    of work ceases to require any great mental effort. We may,\r\n    perhaps, tire our eyes and weary our backs, but we do not\r\n    greatly fatigue our minds.\r\n\r\n    “It is not till we attempt to bring the theoretical part of\r\n    our training into contact with the practical that we begin to\r\n    experience the full effect of what Faraday has called ‘mental\r\n    inertia’--not only the difficulty of recognising, among the\r\n    concrete objects before us, the abstract relation which we have\r\n    learned from books, but the distracting pain of wrenching the\r\n    mind away from the symbols to the objects, and from the objects\r\n    back to the symbols. This, however, is the price we have to pay\r\n    for new ideas.\r\n\r\n    “But when we have overcome these difficulties, and successfully\r\n    bridged over the gulph between the abstract and the concrete,\r\n    it is not a mere piece of knowledge that we have obtained; we\r\n    have acquired the rudiment of a permanent mental endowment.\r\n    When, by a repetition of efforts of this kind, we have more\r\n    fully developed the scientific faculty, the exercise of this\r\n    faculty in detecting scientific principles in nature, and in\r\n    directing practice by theory, is no longer irksome, but becomes\r\n    an unfailing source of enjoyment, to which we return so often\r\n    that at last even our careless thoughts begin to run in a\r\n    scientific channel.\r\n\r\n    “Our principal work, however, in the Laboratory must be to\r\n    acquaint ourselves with all kinds of scientific methods, to\r\n    compare them and to estimate their value. It will, I think,\r\n    be a result worthy of our University, and more likely to be\r\n    accomplished here than in any private laboratory, if, by the\r\n    free and full discussion of the relative value of different\r\n    scientific procedures, we succeed in forming a school of\r\n    scientific criticism and in assisting the development of the\r\n    doctrine of method.\r\n\r\n    “But admitting that a practical acquaintance with the methods\r\n    of Physical Science is an essential part of a mathematical\r\n    and scientific education, we may be asked whether we are not\r\n    attributing too much importance to science altogether as part\r\n    of a liberal education.\r\n\r\n    “Fortunately, there is no question here whether the University\r\n    should continue to be a place of liberal education, or\r\n    should devote itself to preparing young men for particular\r\n    professions. Hence, though some of us may, I hope, see reason\r\n    to make the pursuit of science the main business of our lives,\r\n    it must be one of our most constant aims to maintain a living\r\n    connexion between our work and the other liberal studies of\r\n    Cambridge, whether literary, philological, historical, or\r\n    philosophical.\r\n\r\n    “There is a narrow professional spirit which may grow up among\r\n    men of science just as it does among men who practise any other\r\n    special business. But surely a University is the very place\r\n    where we should be able to overcome this tendency of men to\r\n    become, as it were, granulated into small worlds, which are\r\n    all the more worldly for their very smallness? We lose the\r\n    advantage of having men of varied pursuits collected into one\r\n    body if we do not endeavour to imbibe some of the spirit even\r\n    of those whose special branch of learning is different from our\r\n    own.”\r\n\r\nAnother expression of his views on the position of Physics at the time\r\nwill be found in his address to Section A of the British Association,\r\nwhen President at the Liverpool meeting of 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE--THE CAVENDISH LABORATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the laboratory was not yet built. A Syndicate, of which Maxwell\r\nwas a member, was appointed to consider the question of a site, to\r\ntake professional advice, and to obtain plans and estimates. Professor\r\nMaxwell and Mr. Trotter visited various laboratories at home and\r\nabroad for the purpose of ascertaining the best arrangements. Mr. W.\r\nM. Fawcett was appointed architect; the tender of Mr. John Loveday,\r\nof Kebworth, for the building at a cost of £8,450, exclusive of gas,\r\nwater, and heating, was accepted in March, 1872, and the building[38]\r\nwas begun during the summer.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Maxwell began to lecture, finding a home where he could.\r\n\r\n    “Lectures begin 24th,” he writes from Glenlair, October 19th,\r\n    1872. “Laboratory rising, I hear, but I have no place to erect\r\n    my chair, but move about like the cuckoo, depositing my notions\r\n    in the Chemical Lecture-room 1st term; in the Botanical in\r\n    Lent, and in Comparative Anatomy in Easter.”\r\n\r\nIt was not till June, 1874, that the building was complete, and on\r\nthe 16th the Chancellor formally presented his gift of the Cavendish\r\nLaboratory to the University. In the correspondence previous to this\r\ntime it was spoken of as the Devonshire Laboratory. The name Cavendish\r\ncommemorated the work of the great physicist of a century earlier,\r\nwhose writings Maxwell was shortly to edit, as well as the generosity\r\nof the Chancellor.\r\n\r\nIn their letter of thanks to the Duke of Devonshire the University\r\nwrite:--\r\n\r\n“Unde vero conventius poterat illis artibus succurri quam e tua domo\r\nquæ in ipsis jam pridem inclaruerat. Notum est Henricum Cavendish quem\r\nsecutus est Coulombius primum ita docuisse, quæ sit vis electrica ut\r\neam numerorum modulis illustraret; adhibitis rationibus quas hodie\r\nveras esse constat.” And they suggest the name as suitable for the\r\nbuilding. To this the Chancellor replied, after referring to the work\r\nof Henry Cavendish: “Quod pono in officinâ ipsâ nuncupandâ nomen ejus\r\ncommemorare dignati sitis, id grato animo accepi.”\r\n\r\nThe building had cost far more than the original estimate, but the\r\nChancellor’s generosity was not limited, and on July 21st, 1874, he\r\nwrote to the Vice-Chancellor:--\r\n\r\n“It is my wish to provide all instruments for the Cavendish Laboratory\r\nwhich Professor Maxwell may consider to be immediately required, either\r\nin his lectures or otherwise.”\r\n\r\nMaxwell prepared a list, but explained while doing it that time and\r\nthought were necessary to secure the best form of instruments; and he\r\ncontinues, writing to the Vice-Chancellor: “I think the Duke fully\r\nunderstood from what I said to him that to furnish the Laboratory\r\nwill be a matter of several years’ duration. I shall consider myself,\r\nhowever,” he says, “at liberty to contribute to the Laboratory any\r\ninstruments which I have had constructed in former years, and which\r\nmay be found still useful, and also from time to time to procure others\r\nfor special researches.”\r\n\r\nIn 1877 in his annual report Professor Maxwell announced that the\r\nChancellor[39] had now “completed his gift to the University by\r\nfurnishing the Cavendish Laboratory with apparatus suited to the\r\npresent state of science.”\r\n\r\nThe stock of apparatus, however, was still small, although Maxwell in\r\nthe most generous manner himself spent large sums in adding to it;\r\nfor the Professor was most particular in procuring only expensive\r\ninstruments by the best makers, with such additional improvements as he\r\ncould himself suggest.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1874, a Demonstratorship of Physics had been established, and\r\nMr. Garnett of St. John’s College was appointed.\r\n\r\nWork began in the laboratory in October, 1874. At first the number of\r\nstudents was small. Only seventeen names appear in the Natural Sciences\r\nTripos[40] list for 1874, and few of those did Physics.\r\n\r\nThe fear alluded to by the Professor in his introductory lecture,\r\nthat men reading for the Mathematical Tripos would not find\r\ntime for attendance at the laboratory, was justified. One of the\r\nweaknesses of our Cambridge plan has been the divorce between\r\nMathematics and experimental work, encouraged by our system of\r\nexaminations. Experimental knowledge is supposed not to be needed for\r\nthe Mathematical Tripos; the Mathematics permitted in the Natural\r\nSciences Tripos are very simple; thus it came about that few men while\r\nreading for the Mathematical Tripos attended the laboratory, and this\r\nunfortunate result was intensified by the action of the University in\r\n1877–78, when the regulations for the Mathematical Tripos were again\r\naltered.[41]\r\n\r\nStill there were pupils eager and willing to work, though they were\r\nchiefly men who had already taken their B.A. degree, and who wished\r\nto continue Physical reading and research, even though it involved “a\r\nconsiderable amount of dull labour not altogether attractive.” My own\r\nwork there began in 1876, and it may be interesting if I recall my\r\nreminiscences of that time.\r\n\r\nThe first experiments I can recollect related to the measurement\r\nof electrical resistance. I well remember Maxwell explaining the\r\nprinciple of Wheatstone’s bridge, and my own wish at the time that I\r\nhad come to the laboratory before the Tripos, instead of afterwards.\r\nLord Rayleigh had, during the examination, set an easy question which\r\nI failed to do for want of some slight experimental knowledge, and the\r\nfirst few words of Maxwell’s talk showed me the solution.\r\n\r\nI did not attend his lectures regularly--they were given, I think, at\r\nan hour which I was obliged to devote to teaching; besides, there was\r\nhis book, the “Electricity and Magnetism,” into which I had just dipped\r\nbefore the Tripos, to work at.\r\n\r\nChrystal and Saunder were then busy at their verification of Ohm’s law.\r\nThey were using a number of the Thomson form of tray Daniell’s cells,\r\nand Maxwell was anxious for tests of various kinds to be made on these\r\ncells; these I undertook, and spent some time over various simple\r\nmeasurements on them. He then set me to work at some of the properties\r\nof a stratified dielectric, consisting, if I remember rightly, of\r\nsheets of paraffin paper and mica. By this means I became acquainted\r\nwith various pieces of apparatus. There were no regular classes and no\r\nset drill of demonstrations arranged for examination purposes; these\r\ncame later. In Maxwell’s time those who wished to work had the use of\r\nthe laboratory and assistance and help from him, but they were left\r\npretty much to themselves to find out about the apparatus and the best\r\nmethods of using it.\r\n\r\nRather later than this Schuster came and did some of his spectroscope\r\nwork. J. E. H. Gordon was busy with the preliminary observations\r\nfor his determination of Verdet’s constant, and Niven had various\r\nelectrical experiments on hand; while Fleming was at work on the B. A.\r\nresistance coils.\r\n\r\nMy own tastes lay in the direction of optics. Maxwell was anxious that\r\nI should investigate the properties of certain crystals. I think they\r\nwere the chlorate of potash crystals, about which Stokes and Rayleigh\r\nhave since written; but these crystals were to be grown, a slow process\r\nwhich would, he supposed, take years; and as I wished to produce a\r\ndissertation for the Trinity Fellowship examination in 1877, that work\r\nhad to be laid aside.\r\n\r\nEventually I selected as a subject the form of the wave surface in\r\na biaxial crystal, and set to work in a room assigned to me. The\r\nProfessor used to come in on most days to see how I was getting on.\r\nGenerally he brought his dog, which sometimes was shut up in the next\r\nroom while he went to college. Dogs were not allowed in college, and\r\nMaxwell had an amusing way of describing how Toby once wandered into\r\nTrinity, and by some doggish instinct discovered immediately, to his\r\nintense amazement, that he was in a place where no dogs had been since\r\nthe college was. Toby was not always quiet in his master’s absence, and\r\nhis presence in the next room was somewhat disturbing.\r\n\r\nWhen difficulties occurred Maxwell was always ready to listen. Often\r\nthe answer did not come at once, but it always did come after a little\r\ntime. I remember one day, when I was in a serious dilemma, I told him\r\nmy long tale, and he said:--\r\n\r\n“Well, Chrystal has been talking to me, and Garnett and Schuster have\r\nbeen asking questions, and all this has formed a good thick crust round\r\nmy brain. What you have said will take some time to soak through, but\r\nwe will see about it.” In a few days he came back with--“I have been\r\nthinking over what you said the other day, and if you do so-and-so it\r\nwill be all right.”\r\n\r\nMy dissertation was referred to him, and on the day of the election,\r\nwhen returning to Cambridge for the admission, I met him at Bletchley\r\nstation, and well remember his kind congratulations and words of warm\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nFor the next year and a half I was working regularly at the laboratory\r\nand saw him almost daily during term time.\r\n\r\nOf these last years there really is but little to tell. His own\r\nscientific work went on. The “Electricity and Magnetism” was written\r\nmostly at Glenlair. About the time of his return to Cambridge, in\r\nOctober, 1872, he writes[42] to Lewis Campbell:--\r\n\r\n    “I am continually engaged in stirring up the Clarendon Press,\r\n    but they have been tolerably regular for two months. I find\r\n    nine sheets in thirteen weeks is their average. Tait gives me\r\n    great help in detecting absurdities. I am getting converted to\r\n    quaternions, and have put some in my book.”\r\n\r\nThe book was published in 1873. The Text-book of Heat was written\r\nduring the same period, while “Matter and Motion,” “a small book on a\r\ngreat subject,” was published in 1876.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 and 1874 he was one of the examiners for the Natural Sciences\r\nTripos, and in 1873 he was the first additional examiner for the\r\nMathematical Tripos, in accordance with the scheme which he had done so\r\nmuch to promote in 1868.\r\n\r\nMany of his shorter papers were written about the same time. The\r\nninth edition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ was being published,\r\nand Professor Baynes had enlisted his aid in the work. The articles\r\n“Atom,” “Attraction,” “Capillary Action,” “Constitution of Bodies,”\r\n“Diffusion,” “Ether,” “Faraday,” and others are by him.\r\n\r\nHe also wrote a number of papers for _Nature_. Some of these are\r\nreviews of books or accounts of scientific men, such as the notices\r\nof Faraday and Helmholtz, which appeared with their portraits; others\r\nagain are original contributions to science. Among the latter many have\r\nreference to the molecular constitution of bodies. Two lectures--the\r\nfirst on “Molecules,” delivered before the British Association at\r\nBradford in 1873; the second on the “Dynamical Evidence of the\r\nMolecular Constitution of Bodies,” delivered before the Chemical\r\nSociety in 1875--were of special importance. The closing sentences of\r\nthe first lecture have been often quoted. They run as follow:--\r\n\r\n    “In the heavens we discover by their light, and by their light\r\n    alone, stars so distant from each other that no material thing\r\n    can ever have passed from one to another; and yet this light,\r\n    which is to us the sole evidence of the existence of these\r\n    distant worlds, tells us also that each of them is built up of\r\n    molecules of the same kinds as those which we find on earth.\r\n    A molecule of hydrogen, for example, whether in Sirius or in\r\n    Arcturus, executes its vibrations in precisely the same time.\r\n\r\n    “Each molecule therefore throughout the universe bears\r\n    impressed upon it the stamp of a metric system, as distinctly\r\n    as does the metre of the Archives at Paris, or the double royal\r\n    cubit of the temple of Karnac.\r\n\r\n    “No theory of evolution can be formed to account for the\r\n    similarity of molecules, for evolution necessarily implies\r\n    continuous change, and the molecule is incapable of growth or\r\n    decay, of generation or destruction.\r\n\r\n    “None of the processes of Nature, since the time when Nature\r\n    began, have produced the slightest difference in the properties\r\n    of any molecule. We are therefore unable to ascribe either the\r\n    existence of the molecules or the identity of their properties\r\n    to any of the causes which we call natural.\r\n\r\n    “On the other hand, the exact equality of each molecule to all\r\n    others of the same kind gives it, as Sir John Herschel has well\r\n    said, the essential character of a manufactured article, and\r\n    precludes the idea of its being eternal and self-existent.\r\n\r\n    “Thus we have been led along a strictly scientific path,\r\n    very near to the point at which Science must stop--not that\r\n    Science is debarred from studying the internal mechanism of a\r\n    molecule which she cannot take to pieces any more than from\r\n    investigating an organism which she cannot put together. But in\r\n    tracing back the history of matter, Science is arrested when\r\n    she assures herself, on the one hand, that the molecule has\r\n    been made, and, on the other, that it has not been made by any\r\n    of the processes we call natural.\r\n\r\n    “Science is incompetent to reason upon the creation of matter\r\n    itself out of nothing. We have reached the utmost limits of our\r\n    thinking faculties when we have admitted that because matter\r\n    cannot be eternal and self-existent, it must have been created.\r\n\r\n    “It is only when we contemplate, not matter in itself, but the\r\n    form in which it actually exists, that our mind finds something\r\n    on which it can lay hold.\r\n\r\n    “That matter, as such, should have certain fundamental\r\n    properties, that it should exist in space and be capable of\r\n    motion, that its motion should be persistent, and so on, are\r\n    truths which may, for anything we know, be of the kind which\r\n    metaphysicians call necessary. We may use our knowledge of\r\n    such truths for purposes of deduction, but we have no data for\r\n    speculating as to their origin.\r\n\r\n    “But that there should be exactly so much matter and no more\r\n    in every molecule of hydrogen is a fact of a very different\r\n    order. We have here a particular distribution of matter--a\r\n    _collocation_, to use the expression of Dr. Chalmers, of things\r\n    which we have no difficulty in imagining to have been arranged\r\n    otherwise.\r\n\r\n    “The form and dimensions of the orbits of the planets, for\r\n    instance, are not determined by any law of nature, but depend\r\n    upon a particular collocation of matter. The same is the case\r\n    with respect to the size of the earth, from which the standard\r\n    of what is called the metrical system has been derived. But\r\n    these astronomical and terrestrial magnitudes are far inferior\r\n    in scientific importance to that most fundamental of all\r\n    standards which forms the base of the molecular system. Natural\r\n    causes, as we know, are at work which tend to modify, if they\r\n    do not at length destroy, all the arrangements and dimensions\r\n    of the earth and the whole solar system. But though in the\r\n    course of ages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur in\r\n    the heavens, though ancient systems may be dissolved and new\r\n    systems evolved out of their ruins, the molecules out of which\r\n    these systems are built--the foundation stones of the material\r\n    universe--remain unbroken and unworn. They continue this day as\r\n    they were created--perfect in number and measure and weight;\r\n    and from the ineffaceable characters impressed on them we may\r\n    learn that those aspirations after accuracy in measurement, and\r\n    justice in action, which we reckon among our noblest attributes\r\n    as men, are ours because they are essential constituents of the\r\n    image of Him who in the beginning created, not only the heaven\r\n    and the earth, but the materials of which heaven and earth\r\n    consist.”\r\n\r\nThis was criticised in _Nature_ by Mr. C. J. Munro, and at a later time\r\nby Clifford in one of his essays.\r\n\r\nSome correspondence with the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol on the\r\nauthority for the comparison of molecules to manufactured articles is\r\ngiven by Professor Campbell, and in it Maxwell points out that the\r\nlatter part of the article “Atom” in the _Encyclopædia_ is intended to\r\nmeet Mr. Munro’s criticism.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the British Association met at Belfast, under the presidency of\r\nTyndall. Maxwell was present, and published afterwards in _Blackwood’s\r\nMagazine_ an amusing paraphrase of the president’s address. This, with\r\nsome other verses written at about the same time, may be quoted here.\r\nProfessor Campbell has collected a number of verses written by Maxwell\r\nat various times, which illustrate in an admirable manner both the\r\ngrave and the gay side of his character.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH ASSOCIATION, 1874.\r\n\r\n_Notes of the President’s Address._\r\n\r\n      In the very beginnings of science, the parsons, who managed\r\n          things then,\r\n      Being handy with hammer and chisel, made gods in the likeness\r\n          of men;\r\n      Till commerce arose, and at length some men of exceptional power\r\n      Supplanted both demons and gods by the atoms, which last\r\n          to this hour.\r\n      Yet they did not abolish the gods, but they sent them well\r\n          out of the way,\r\n      With the rarest of nectar to drink, and blue fields of\r\n          nothing to sway.\r\n      From nothing comes nothing, they told us--naught happens by\r\n          chance, but by fate;\r\n      There is nothing but atoms and void, all else is mere whims\r\n          out of date!\r\n      Then why should a man curry favour with beings who cannot exist,\r\n      To compass some petty promotion in nebulous kingdoms of mist?\r\n      But not by the rays of the sun, nor the glittering shafts of the\r\n          day,\r\n      Must the fear of the gods be dispelled, but by words, and their\r\n          wonderful play.\r\n      So treading a path all untrod, the poet-philosopher sings\r\n      Of the seeds of the mighty world--the first-beginnings of things;\r\n      How freely he scatters his atoms before the beginning of years;\r\n      How he clothes them with force as a garment, those small\r\n          incompressible spheres!\r\n      Nor yet does he leave them hard-hearted--he dowers them with love\r\n          and with hate,\r\n      Like spherical small British Asses in infinitesimal state;\r\n      Till just as that living Plato, whom foreigners nickname\r\n          Plateau,[43]\r\n      Drops oil in his whisky-and-water (for foreigners sweeten it so);\r\n      Each drop keeps apart from the other, enclosed in a flexible skin,\r\n      Till touched by the gentle emotion evolved by the prick of a pin:\r\n      Thus in atoms a simple collision excites a sensational thrill,\r\n      Evolved through all sorts of emotion, as sense, understanding,\r\n          and will\r\n      (For by laying their heads all together, the atoms, as\r\n          councillors do,\r\n      May combine to express an opinion to every one of them new).\r\n      There is nobody here, I should say, has felt true indignation at\r\n          all,\r\n      Till an indignation meeting is held in the Ulster Hall;\r\n      Then gathers the wave of emotion, then noble feelings arise,\r\n      Till you all pass a resolution which takes every man by surprise.\r\n      Thus the pure elementary atom, the unit of mass and of thought,\r\n      By force of mere juxtaposition to life and sensation is brought;\r\n      So, down through untold generations, transmission of structureless\r\n          gorms\r\n      Enables our race to inherit the thoughts of beasts, fishes, and\r\n          worms.\r\n      We honour our fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers\r\n          too;\r\n      But how shall we honour the vista of ancestors now in our view?\r\n      First, then, let us honour the atom, so lively, so wise,\r\n          and so small;\r\n      The atomists next let us praise, Epicurus, Lucretius, and all.\r\n      Let us damn with faint praise Bishop Butler, in whom many\r\n          atoms combined\r\n      To form that remarkable structure it pleased him to call--his mind.\r\n      Last, praise we the noble body to which, for the time, we belong,\r\n      Ere yet the swift whirl of the atoms has hurried us, ruthless,\r\n          along,\r\n      The British Association--like Leviathan worshipped by Hobbes,\r\n      The incarnation of wisdom, built up of our witless nobs,\r\n      Which will carry on endless discussions when I, and probably you,\r\n      Have melted in infinite azure--in English, till all is blue.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLECULAR EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n_Belfast, 1874._\r\n\r\n      At quite uncertain times and places,\r\n        The atoms left their heavenly path,\r\n      And by fortuitous embraces\r\n        Engendered all that being hath.\r\n      And though they seem to cling together,\r\n        And form “associations” here,\r\n      Yet, soon or late, they burst their tether,\r\n        And through the depths of space career.\r\n\r\n      So we who sat, oppressed with science,\r\n        As British Asses, wise and grave,\r\n      Are now transformed to wild Red Lions,[44]\r\n        As round our prey we ramp and rave.\r\n      Thus, by a swift metamorphōsis,\r\n        Wisdom turns wit, and science joke,\r\n      Nonsense is incense to our noses,\r\n        For when Red Lions speak they smoke.\r\n\r\n      Hail, Nonsense! dry nurse of Red Lions,[45]\r\n        From thee the wise their wisdom learn;\r\n      From thee they cull those truths of science,\r\n        Which into thee again they turn.\r\n      What combinations of ideas\r\n        Nonsense alone can wisely form!\r\n      What sage has half the power that she has,\r\n        To take the towers of Truth by storm?\r\n\r\n      Yield, then, ye rules of rigid reason!\r\n        Dissolve, thou too, too solid sense!\r\n      Melt into nonsense for a season,\r\n        Then in some nobler form condense.\r\n      Soon, all too soon, the chilly morning\r\n        This flow of soul will crystallise;\r\n      Then those who Nonsense now are scorning\r\n        May learn, too late, where wisdom lies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE COMMITTEE OF THE CAYLEY PORTRAIT FUND.\r\n\r\n1874.\r\n\r\n      O wretched race of men, to space confined!\r\n      What honour can ye pay to him, whose mind\r\n        To that which lies beyond hath penetrated?\r\n      The symbols he hath formed shall sound his praise,\r\n      And lead him on through unimagined ways\r\n        To conquests new, in worlds not yet created.\r\n\r\n      First, ye Determinants!

Cavendish, who was great-uncle\r\nto the Chancellor, had published only two electrical papers, but he had\r\nleft some twenty packets of manuscript on Mathematical and Experimental\r\nElectricity. These were placed in Maxwell’s hands in 1874 by the Duke\r\nof Devonshire.\r\n\r\nNiven, in his preface to the collected papers dealing with this book,\r\nwrites thus:--\r\n\r\n    “This work, published in 1879, has had the effect of increasing\r\n    the reputation of Cavendish, disclosing as it does the\r\n    unsuspected advances which that acute physicist had made in\r\n    the Theory of Electricity, especially in the measurement of\r\n    electrical quantities. The work is enriched by a variety of\r\n    valuable notes, in which Cavendish’s views and results are\r\n    examined by the light of modern theory and methods. Especially\r\n    valuable are the methods applied to the determination of the\r\n    electrical capacities of conductors and condensers, a subject\r\n    in which Cavendish himself showed considerable skill both of a\r\n    mathematical and experimental character.\r\n\r\n    “The importance of the task undertaken by Maxwell in connection\r\n    with Cavendish’s papers will be understood from the following\r\n    extract from his introduction to them:--\r\n\r\n    “‘It is somewhat difficult to account for the fact that\r\n    though Cavendish had prepared a complete description of his\r\n    experiments on the charges of bodies, and had even taken the\r\n    trouble to write out a fair copy, and though all this seems\r\n    to have been done before 1774, and he continued to make\r\n    experiments in electricity till 1781, and lived on till 1810,\r\n    he kept his manuscript by him and never published it.\r\n\r\n    “‘Cavendish cared more for investigation than for publication.\r\n    He would undertake the most laborious researches in order to\r\n    clear up a difficulty which no one but himself could appreciate\r\n    or was even aware of, and we cannot doubt that the result of\r\n    his enquiries, when successful, gave him a certain degree of\r\n    satisfaction. But it did not excite in him that desire to\r\n    communicate the discovery to others, which in the case of\r\n    ordinary men of science generally ensures the publication of\r\n    their results. How completely these researches of Cavendish\r\n    remained unknown to other men of science is shown by the\r\n    external history of electricity.’\r\n\r\n    “It will probably be thought a matter of some difficulty to\r\n    place oneself in the position of a physicist of a century\r\n    ago, and to ascertain the exact bearing of his experiments.\r\n    But Maxwell entered upon this undertaking with the utmost\r\n    enthusiasm, and succeeded in identifying himself with\r\n    Cavendish’s methods. He showed that Cavendish had really\r\n    anticipated several of the discoveries in electrical science\r\n    which have been made since his time. Cavendish was the first to\r\n    form the conception of and to measure Electrostatic Capacity\r\n    and Specific Inductive Capacity; he also anticipated Ohm’s law.”\r\n\r\nDuring the last years of his life Mrs. Maxwell had a serious and\r\nprolonged illness, and Maxwell’s work was much increased by his duties\r\nas sick nurse. On one occasion he did not sleep in a bed for three\r\nweeks, but conducted his lectures and experiments at the laboratory as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nAbout this time some of those who had been “Apostles” in 1853–57\r\nrevived the habit of meeting together for discussion. The club, which\r\nincluded Professors Lightfoot, Hort and Westcott, was christened\r\nthe “Eranus,” and three of Maxwell’s contributions to it have been\r\npreserved and are printed by Professor Campbell.\r\n\r\nAfter the Cavendish papers were finished, Maxwell had more time for his\r\nown original researches, and two important papers were published in\r\n1879. The one on “Stresses in Rarefied Gases arising from Inequalities\r\nof Temperature” was printed in the Royal Society’s Transactions, and\r\ndeals with the Theory of the Radiometer; the other on “Boltzmann’s\r\nTheorem” appears in the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical\r\nSociety. In the previous year he had delivered the Rede lecture on “The\r\nTelephone.” He also began to prepare a second edition of “Electricity\r\nand Magnetism.”\r\n\r\nHis health gave way during the Easter term of 1879; indeed for two\r\nyears previously he had been troubled with dyspeptic symptoms, but had\r\nconsulted no one on the subject. He left Cambridge as usual in June,\r\nhoping that he would quickly recover at Glenlair, but he grew worse\r\ninstead. In October he was told by Dr. Sanders of Edinburgh that he had\r\nnot a month to live. He returned to Cambridge in order to be under the\r\ncare of Dr. Paget, who was able in some measure to relieve his most\r\nsevere suffering but the disease, of which his mother had died at the\r\nsame age, continued its progress, and he died on November 5th. His one\r\ncare during his last illness was for those whom he left behind. Mrs.\r\nMaxwell was an invalid dependent on him for everything, and the thought\r\nof her helplessness was the one thing which in these last days troubled\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA funeral service took place in the chapel at Trinity College, and\r\nafterwards his remains were conveyed to Scotland and interred in the\r\nfamily burying-place at Corsock, Kirkcudbright.\r\n\r\nA memorial edition of his works was issued by the Cambridge University\r\nPress in 1890. A portrait by Lowes Dickinson hangs in the hall of\r\nTrinity College, and there is a bust by Boehm in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nAfter his death Mrs. Maxwell gave his scientific library to the\r\nCavendish Laboratory, and on her death she left a sum of about £6,000\r\nto found a scholarship in Physics, to be held at the laboratory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preceding pages contain some account of Clerk Maxwell’s life as\r\na man of science. His character had other sides, and any life of him\r\nwould be incomplete without some brief reference to these. His letters\r\nto his wife and to other intimate friends show throughout his life\r\nthe depth of his religious convictions. The high purpose evidenced\r\nin the paper given to the present Dean of Canterbury when leaving\r\nCambridge, animated him continually, and appears from time to time in\r\nhis writings. The student’s evening hymn, composed in 1853 when still\r\nan undergraduate, expresses the same feelings--\r\n\r\n      Through the creatures Thou hast made\r\n        Show the brightness of Thy glory,\r\n      Be eternal truth displayed\r\n        In their substance transitory,\r\n      Till green earth and ocean hoary,\r\n        Massy rock and tender blade,\r\n      Tell the same unending story,\r\n        “We are Truth in form arrayed.”\r\n\r\n      Teach me so Thy works to read\r\n        That my faith, new strength accruing,\r\n      May from world to world proceed,\r\n        Wisdom’s fruitful search pursuing,\r\n      Till Thy breath my mind imbuing,\r\n        I proclaim the eternal creed,\r\n      Oft the glorious theme renewing,\r\n        God our Lord is God indeed.\r\n\r\nHis views on the relation of Science to Faith are given in his\r\nletter[47] to Bishop Ellicott already referred to--\r\n\r\n    “But I should be very sorry if an interpretation founded\r\n    on a most conjectural scientific hypothesis were to get\r\n    fastened to the text in Genesis, even if by so doing it got\r\n    rid of the old statement of the commentators which has long\r\n    ceased to be intelligible. The rate of change of scientific\r\n    hypothesis is naturally much more rapid than that of Biblical\r\n    interpretations, so that if an interpretation is founded on\r\n    such an hypothesis, it may help to keep the hypothesis above\r\n    ground long after it ought to be buried and forgotten.\r\n\r\n    “At the same time I think that each individual man should do\r\n    all he can to impress his own mind with the extent, the order,\r\n    and the unity of the universe, and should carry these ideas\r\n    with him as he reads such passages as the 1st chapter of the\r\n    Epistle to Colossians (_see_ ‘Lightfoot on Colossians,’ p.\r\n    182), just as enlarged conceptions of the extent and unity of\r\n    the world of life may be of service to us in reading Psalm\r\n    viii., Heb. ii. 6, etc.”\r\n\r\nAnd again in his letter[48] to the secretary of the Victoria Institute\r\ngiving his reasons for declining to become a member--\r\n\r\n    “I think men of science as well as other men need to learn from\r\n    Christ, and I think Christians whose minds are scientific are\r\n    bound to study science, that their view of the glory of God\r\n    may be as extensive as their being is capable of. But I think\r\n    that the results which each man arrives at in his attempts to\r\n    harmonise his science with his Christianity ought not to be\r\n    regarded as having any significance except to the man himself,\r\n    and to him only for a time, and should not receive the stamp of\r\n    a society.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Campbell and Mr. Garnett have given us the evidence of those\r\nwho were with him in his last days, as to the strength of his own\r\nfaith. On his death bed he said that he had been occupied in trying to\r\ngain truth; that it is but little of truth that man can acquire, but it\r\nis something to know in whom we have believed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC WORK--COLOUR VISION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen years only have passed since the death of Clerk Maxwell, and it\r\nis almost too soon to hope to form a correct estimate of the value of\r\nhis work and its relation to that of others who have laboured in the\r\nsame field.\r\n\r\nThus Niven, at the close of his obituary notice in the Proceedings of\r\nthe Royal Society, says: “It is seldom that the faculties of invention\r\nand exposition, the attachment to physical science and capability of\r\ndeveloping it mathematically, have been found existing in one mind\r\nto the same degree. It would, however, require powers somewhat akin\r\nto Maxwell’s own to describe the more delicate features of the works\r\nresulting from this combination, every one of which is stamped with the\r\nsubtle but unmistakable impress of genius.” And again in the preface\r\nto Maxwell’s works, issued in 1890, he wrote: “Nor does it appear to\r\nthe present editor that the time has yet arrived when the quickening\r\ninfluence of Maxwell’s mind on modern scientific thought can be duly\r\nestimated.”\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the object of the present series to attempt to give\r\nsome account of the work of men of science of the last hundred years,\r\nand to show how each has contributed his share to our present stock\r\nof knowledge. This task, then, remains to be done. While attempting\r\nit I wish to express my indebtedness to others who have already\r\nwritten about Maxwell’s scientific work, especially to Mr. W. D.\r\nNiven, whose preface to the Maxwell papers has been so often referred\r\nto; to Mr. Garnett, the author of Part II. of the “Life of Maxwell,”\r\nwhich deals with his contributions to science; and to Professor Tait,\r\nwho in _Nature_ for February 5th, 1880, gave an account of Clerk\r\nMaxwell’s work, “necessarily brief, but sufficient to let even the\r\nnon-mathematical reader see how very great were his contributions to\r\nmodern science”--an account all the more interesting because, again to\r\nquote from Professor Tait, “I have been intimately acquainted with him\r\nsince we were schoolboys together.”\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s main contributions to science may be classified under three\r\nheads--“Colour Perception,” “Molecular Physics,” and “Electrical\r\nTheories.” In addition to these there were other papers of the highest\r\ninterest and importance, such as the essay on “Saturn’s Rings,” the\r\npaper on the “Equilibrium of Elastic Solids,” and various memoirs on\r\npure geometry and questions of mechanics, which would, if they stood\r\nalone, have secured for their author a distinguished position as a\r\nphysicist and mathematician, but which are not the works by which his\r\nname will be mostly remembered.\r\n\r\nThe work on “Colour Perception” was begun at an early date. We have\r\nseen Maxwell while still at Edinburgh interested in the discussions\r\nabout Hay’s theories.\r\n\r\nHis first published paper on the subject was a letter to Dr. G.\r\nWilson, printed in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Arts for\r\n1855; but he had been mixing colours by means of his top for some\r\nlittle time previously, and the results of these experiments are given\r\nin a paper entitled “Experiments on Colour,” communicated to the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh by Dr. Gregory, and printed in their Transactions,\r\nvol. xxi.\r\n\r\nIn the paper on “The Theory of Compound Colours,” printed in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for 1860, Maxwell gives a history of the\r\ntheory as it was known to him.\r\n\r\nHe points out first the distinction between the _optical_ properties\r\nand the _chromatic_ properties of a beam of light. “The optical\r\nproperties are those which have reference to its origin and propagation\r\nthrough media until it falls on the sensitive organ of vision;”\r\nthey depend on the periods and amplitudes of the ether vibrations\r\nwhich compose the beam. “The chromatic properties are those which\r\nhave reference to its power of exciting certain sensations of colour\r\nperceived through the organ of vision.” It is possible for two beams to\r\nbe optically very different and chromatically alike. The converse is\r\nnot true; two beams which are optically alike are also chromatically\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the theory of compound colours was laid by Newton.\r\nHe first shewed that “by the mixture of homogeneal light colours may\r\nbe produced which are like to the colours of homogeneal light as to\r\nthe appearance of colour, but not as to the immutability of colour and\r\nconstitution of light.” Two beams which differ optically may yet be\r\nalike chromatically; it is possible by mixing red and yellow to obtain\r\nan orange colour chromatically similar to the orange of the spectrum,\r\nbut optically different to that orange, for the compound orange can be\r\nanalysed by a prism into its component red and yellow; the spectrum\r\norange is incapable of further resolution.\r\n\r\nNewton also solves the following problem:--\r\n\r\n_In a mixture of primary colours, the quantity and quality of each\r\nbeing given to know the colour of the compound_ (Optics, Book 1, Part\r\n2, Prop. 6), and his solution is the following:--He arranges the seven\r\ncolours of the spectrum round the circumference of a circle, the length\r\noccupied by each colour being proportional to the musical interval to\r\nwhich, in Newton’s views, the colour corresponded. At the centre of\r\ngravity of each of these arcs he supposes a weight placed proportional\r\nto the number of rays of the corresponding colour which enter into the\r\nmixture under consideration. The position of the centre of gravity of\r\nthese weights indicates the nature of the resultant colour. A radius\r\ndrawn through this centre of gravity points out the colour of the\r\nspectrum which it most resembles; the distance of the centre of gravity\r\nfrom the centre gives the fulness of the colour. The centre itself is\r\nwhite. Newton gives no proof of this rule; he merely says, “This rule I\r\nconceive to be accurate enough for practice, though not mathematically\r\naccurate.”\r\n\r\nMaxwell proved that Newton’s method of finding the centre of gravity of\r\nthe component colours was confirmed by his observations, and that it\r\ninvolves mathematically the theory of three elements of colour; but\r\nthe disposition of the colours on the circle was only a provisional\r\narrangement; the true relations of the colours could only be determined\r\nby direct experiment.\r\n\r\nThomas Young appears to have been the next, after Newton, to work\r\nat the theory of colour sensation. He made observations by spinning\r\ncoloured discs much in the same way as that which was afterwards\r\nadopted by Maxwell, and he developed the theory that three different\r\nprimary sensations may be excited in the eye by light, while the colour\r\nof any beam depends on the proportions in which these three sensations\r\nare excited. He supposes the three primary sensations to correspond\r\nto red, green, and violet. A blue ray is capable of exciting both the\r\ngreen and the violet; a yellow ray excites the red and the green. Any\r\ncolour, according to Young’s theory, may be matched by a mixture of\r\nthese three primary colours taken in proper proportion; the quality\r\nof the colour depends on the proportion of the intensities of the\r\ncomponents; its brightness depends on the sum of these intensities.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s experiments were undertaken with the object of proving or\r\ndisproving the physical part of Young’s theory. He does not consider\r\nthe question whether there are three distinct sensations corresponding\r\nto the three primary colours; that is a physiological inquiry, and one\r\nto which no completely satisfactory answer has yet been given. He does\r\nshow that by a proper mixture of any three arbitrarily chosen standard\r\ncolours it is possible to match any other colour; the words “proper\r\nmixture,” however, need, as will appear shortly, some development.\r\n\r\nWe may with advantage compare the problem with one in acoustics.\r\n\r\nWhen a compound musical note consisting of a pure tone and its\r\novertones is sounded, the trained ear can distinguish the various\r\novertones and analyse the sound into its simple components. The same\r\nsensation cannot be excited in two different ways. The eye has no such\r\ncorresponding power. A given yellow may be a pure spectral yellow,\r\ncorresponding to a pure tone in music, or it may be a mixture of a\r\nnumber of other pure tones; in either case it can be matched by a\r\nproper combination of three standard colours--this Maxwell proved.\r\nIt may be, as Young supposed, that if the three standard colours be\r\nproperly selected they correspond exactly to three primary sensations\r\nof the brain. Maxwell’s experiments do not afford any light on this\r\npoint, which still remains more than doubtful.\r\n\r\nWhen Maxwell began his work the theory of colours was exciting\r\nconsiderable interest. Sir David Brewster had recently developed a\r\nnew theory of colour sensation which had formed the basis of some\r\ndiscussions, and in 1852 von Helmholtz published his first paper\r\non the subject. According to Brewster, the three primitive colours\r\nwere red, yellow and blue, and he supposed that they corresponded to\r\nthree different kinds of objective light. Helmholtz pointed out that\r\nexperiments up to that date had been conducted by mixing pigments, with\r\nthe exception of those in which the rotating disc was used, and that\r\nit is necessary to make them on the rays of the spectrum itself. He\r\nthen describes a method of mixing the light from two spectra so as to\r\nobtain the combination of every two of the simple prismatic rays in all\r\ndegrees of relative strength.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments results, which at the time were unexpected, but\r\nsome of which must have been known to Young, were obtained. Among them\r\nit was shown that a mixture of red and green made yellow, while one of\r\ngreen and violet produced blue.\r\n\r\nIn a later paper (_Philosophical Magazine_, 1854) Helmholtz described\r\na method for ascertaining the various pairs of complementary\r\ncolours--colours, that is, which when mixed will give white--which had\r\nbeen shown by Grassman to exist if Newton’s theory were true. He also\r\ngave a provisional diagram of the curve formed by the spectrum, which\r\nought to take the place of the circle in Newton’s diagram; for this,\r\nhowever, his experiments did not give the complete data.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the question when Maxwell began. His first\r\ncolour-box was made in 1852. Others were designed in 1855 and 1856,\r\nand the final paper appeared in 1860. But before that time he had\r\nestablished important results by means of his rotatory discs and colour\r\ntop. In his own description of this he says: “The coloured paper is\r\ncut into the form of disc, each with a hole in the centre and divided\r\nalong a radius so as to admit of several of them being placed on the\r\nsame axis, so that part of each is exposed. By slipping one disc over\r\nanother we can expose any given portion of each colour. These discs\r\nare placed on a top or teetotum, which is spun rapidly. The axis of the\r\ntop passes through the centre of the discs, and the quantity of each\r\ncolour exposed is measured by graduations on the rim of the top, which\r\nis divided into 100 parts. When the top is spun sufficiently rapidly,\r\nthe impressions due to each colour separately follow each other in\r\nquick succession at each point of the retina, and are blended together;\r\nthe strength of the impression due to each colour is, as can be shown\r\nexperimentally, the same as when the three kinds of light in the same\r\nrelative proportions enter the eye simultaneously. These relative\r\nproportions are measured by the areas of the various discs which are\r\nexposed. Two sets of discs of different radius are used; the largest\r\ndiscs are put on first, then the smaller, so that the centre portion\r\nof the top shows the colour arising from the mixture of those of the\r\nsmaller discs; the outer portion, that of the larger discs.”\r\n\r\nIn experimenting, six discs of each size are used, black, white, red,\r\ngreen, yellow and blue. It is found by experiment that a match can be\r\narranged between any five of these. Thus three of the larger discs are\r\nplaced on the top--say black, yellow and blue--and two of the smaller\r\ndiscs, red and green, are placed above these. Then it is found that it\r\nis possible so to adjust the amount exposed of each disc that the two\r\nparts of the top appear when it is spun to be of the same tint. In one\r\nseries of experiments the chromatic effect of 46·8 parts of black, 29·1\r\nof yellow, and 24·1 of blue was found to be the same as that of 66·6\r\nof red and 33·4 of green; each set of discs has a dirty yellow tinge.\r\n\r\nNow, in this experiment, black is not a colour; practically no light\r\nreaches the eye from a dead black. We have, however, to fill up\r\nthe circumference of the top in some way which will not affect the\r\nimpression on the retina arising from the mixture of the blue and\r\nyellow; this we can do by using the black disc.\r\n\r\nThus we have shown that 66·6 parts of red and 33·4 parts of green\r\nproduce the same chromatic effect as 29·1 of yellow and 24·1 of\r\nblue. Similarly in this manner a match can be arranged between any\r\nfour colours and black, the black being necessary to complete the\r\ncircumference of the discs.\r\n\r\nThus using A, B, C, D to denote the various colours, _a_, _b_, _c_,\r\n_d_ the amounts of each colour taken, we can get a series of results\r\nexpressed as follows: _a_ parts of A together with _b_ parts of B match\r\n_c_ parts of C together with _d_ parts of D; or we may write this as an\r\nequation thus:--\r\n\r\n  _a_ A + _b_ B = _c_ C + _d_ D,\r\n\r\nwhere the + stands for “combined with,” and the = for “matches in tint.”\r\n\r\nWe may also write the above--\r\n\r\n  _d_ D = _a_ A + _b_ B - _c_ C,\r\n\r\nor _d_ parts of D can be matched by a _proper_ combination of colours\r\nA, B, C. The sign - shows that in order to make the match we have to\r\ncombine the colour C with D; the combination then matches a mixture of\r\nA and B.\r\n\r\nIn this way we can form a number of equations for all possible colours,\r\nand if we like to take any three colours A, B, C as standards, we\r\nobtain a result which may be written generally--\r\n\r\n  _x_ X = _a_ A + _b_ B + _c_ C,\r\n\r\nor _x_ parts of X can be matched by _a_ parts of A, combined with _b_\r\nparts of B and _c_ parts of C. If the sign of one of the quantities\r\n_a_, _b_, or _c_ is negative, it indicates that that colour must be\r\ncombined with X to match the other two.\r\n\r\nNow Maxwell was able to show that, if A, B, C be properly selected,\r\nnearly every other colour can be matched by positive combinations of\r\nthese three. These three colours, then, are primary colours, and nearly\r\nevery other colour can be matched by a combination of the three primary\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nExperiments, however, with coloured discs, such as were undertaken by\r\nYoung, Forbes and Maxwell, were not capable of giving satisfactory\r\nresults. The colours of the discs were not pure spectrum colours, and\r\nvaried to some extent with the nature of the incident light. It was for\r\nthis reason that Helmholtz in 1852 experimented with the spectrum, and\r\nthat Maxwell about the same time invented his colour box.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the latter was very simple. Suppose we have a slit\r\nS, and some arrangement for forming a pure spectrum on a screen. Let\r\nthere now be a slit R placed in the red part of the spectrum on the\r\nscreen. When light falls on the slit S, only the red rays can reach\r\nR, and hence conversely, if the white source be placed at the other\r\nend of the apparatus, so that R is illuminated with white light, only\r\nred rays will reach S. Similarly, if another slit be placed in the\r\ngreen at G, and this be illuminated by white light, only the green\r\nrays will reach S, while from a third slit V in the violet, violet\r\nlight only can arrive at S. Thus by opening the three slits at V, G\r\nand R simultaneously, and looking through S, the retina receives the\r\nimpression of the three different colours. The amount of light of each\r\ncolour will depend on the breadth to which the corresponding slit is\r\nopened, and the relative intensities of the three different components\r\ncan be compared by comparing the breadths of the three slits. Any other\r\ncolour which is allowed by some suitable contrivance to enter the eye\r\nsimultaneously can now be matched, provided the red, green and violet\r\nare primary colours.\r\n\r\nBy means of experiments with the colour box Maxwell showed conclusively\r\nthat a match could be obtained between any four colours; the\r\nexperiments could not be carried out in quite the simple manner\r\nsuggested by the above description of the principle of the box.\r\nAn account of the method will be found in Maxwell’s own paper. It\r\nconsisted in matching a standard white by various combinations of other\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nThe main object of his research, however, was to examine the chromatic\r\nproperties of the different parts of the spectrum, and to determine the\r\nform of the curve which ought to replace the circle in Newton’s diagram\r\nof colour.\r\n\r\nMaxwell adopted as his three standard colours: red, of about wave\r\nlength 6,302; green, wave length 5,281; and violet, 4,569 tenth metres.\r\nOn the scale of Maxwell’s instrument these are represented by the\r\nnumbers 24, 44 and 68.\r\n\r\nLet us take three points A, B, C at the corners of an equilateral\r\ntriangle to represent on a diagram these three colours. The position\r\nof any other colour on the diagram will be found by taking weights\r\nproportional to the amounts of the colours A, B, C required to make the\r\nmatch between A, B, C and the given colour; these weights are placed at\r\nA, B, C respectively; the position of their centre of gravity is the\r\npoint required. Thus the position of white is given by the equation--\r\n\r\n  W = 18·6 (24) + 31·4 (44) + 30·5 (68)\r\n\r\nwhich means that weights proportional to 18·6, 31·4 and 30·5 are to be\r\nplaced at A, B, C respectively, and their centre of gravity is to be\r\nfound. The point so found is the position of white. Any other colour is\r\ngiven by the equation--\r\n\r\n  X = _a_ (24) + _b_ (44) + _c_ (68).\r\n\r\nAgain, the position on the diagram for all colours for which _a_,\r\n_b_, _c_ are all positive lies within the triangle A B C. If one of\r\nthe coefficients, say _c_, is negative the same construction applies,\r\nbut the weight applied at C must be treated as acting in the opposite\r\ndirection to those at A and B. A mixture of the given colour and C\r\nmatches a mixture of A and B. It is clear that the point corresponding\r\nto X will then lie outside the triangle A B C. Maxwell showed that,\r\nwith his standards, nearly all colours could be represented by points\r\ninside the triangle. The colours he had selected as standards were very\r\nclose to primary colours.\r\n\r\nAgain, he proved that any spectrum colour between red and green, when\r\ncombined with a very slight admixture of violet, could be matched, in\r\nthe case of either Mrs. Maxwell or himself, by a proper mixture of\r\nthe red and green. The positions, therefore, of the spectrum colours\r\nbetween red and green lie just outside the triangle A B C, being very\r\nclose to the line A B, while for the colours between green and violet\r\nMaxwell obtained a curve lying rather further outside the side B C.\r\nAny spectrum colour between green and violet, together with a slight\r\nadmixture of red, can be matched by a proper mixture of green and\r\nviolet.\r\n\r\nThus the circle of Newton’s diagram should be replaced by a curve,\r\nwhich coincides very nearly with the two sides A B and B C of Maxwell’s\r\nfigure. Strictly, according to his observations, the curve lies just\r\noutside these two sides. The purples of the spectrum lie nearly along\r\nthe third side, C A, of the triangle, being obtained approximately by\r\nmixing the violet and the red.\r\n\r\nTo find the point on the diagram corresponding to the colour obtained\r\nby mixing any two or more spectrum colours we must, in accordance\r\nwith Newton’s rule, place weights at the points corresponding to the\r\nselected colours, and find the centre of gravity of these weights.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the outcome of Maxwell’s work on colour. It verified\r\nthe essential part of Newton’s construction, and obtained for the first\r\ntime the true form of the spectrum curve on the diagram.\r\n\r\nThe form of this curve will of course depend on the eye of the\r\nindividual observer. Thus Maxwell and Mrs. Maxwell both made\r\nobservations, and distinct differences were found in their eyes. It\r\nappears, however, that a large majority of persons have normal vision,\r\nand that matches made by one such person are accepted by most others\r\nas satisfactory. Some people, however, are colour blind, and Maxwell\r\nexamined a few such. In the case of those whom he examined it appeared\r\nas though vision was dichromatic, the red sensation seemed to be\r\nabsent; nearly all colours could be matched by combinations of green\r\nand violet. The colour diagram was reduced to the straight line B C.\r\nOther forms of colour blindness have since been investigated.\r\n\r\nIn awarding to Maxwell the Rumford medal in 1860, Major-General\r\nSabine, vice-president of the Royal Society, after explaining the\r\ntheory of colour vision and the possible method of verifying it, said:\r\n“Professor Maxwell has subjected the theory to this verification, and\r\nthereby raised the composition of colours to the rank of a branch of\r\nmathematical physics,” and he continues: “The researches for which\r\nthe Rumford medal is awarded lead to the remarkable result that to a\r\nvery near degree of approximation all the colours of the spectrum, and\r\ntherefore all colours in nature which are only mixtures of these, can\r\nbe perfectly imitated by mixtures of three actually attainable colours,\r\nwhich are the red, green and blue belonging respectively to three\r\nparticular parts of the spectrum.”\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed in concluding our remarks on this part of\r\nMaxwell’s work that his results are purely physical. They are not\r\ninconsistent with the physiological part of Young’s theory, viz., that\r\nthere are three primary sensations of colour which can be transmitted\r\nto the brain, and that the colour of any object depends on the relative\r\nproportions in which these sensations are excited, but they do not\r\nprove that theory. Any physiological theory which can be accepted as\r\ntrue must explain Maxwell’s observations, and Young’s theory does this;\r\nbut it is, of course, possible that other theories may explain them\r\nequally well, and be more in accordance with physiological observations\r\nthan Young’s. Maxwell has given us the physical facts which have to be\r\nexplained; it is for the physiologists to do the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC WORK--MOLECULAR THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaxwell in his article “Atom,” in the ninth edition of the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_, has given some account of Modern Molecular\r\nScience, and in particular of the molecular theory of gases. Of this\r\nscience, Clausius and Maxwell are the founders, though to their names\r\nit has recently been shown that a third, that of Waterston, must be\r\nadded. In the present chapter it is intended to give an outline of\r\nMaxwell’s contributions to molecular science, and to explain the\r\nadvances due to him.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that bodies are composed of small particles in rapid\r\nmotion is very ancient. Democritus was its founder, Lucretius--de Rerum\r\nNaturâ--explained its principles. The atoms do not fill space; there is\r\nvoid between.\r\n\r\n      “Quapropter locus est intactus inane vacansque,\r\n      Quod si non esset, nullâ ratione moveri\r\n      Res possent; namque officium quod corporis extat\r\n      Officere atque obstare, id in omni tempore adesset\r\n      Omnibus. Haud igitur quicquam procedere posset\r\n      Principium quoniam cedendi nulla daret res.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Boscovitch an atom is an indivisible point, having\r\nposition in space, capable of motion, and possessing mass. It is also\r\nendowed with the power of exerting force, so that two atoms attract\r\nor repel each other with a force depending on their distance apart.\r\nIt has no parts or dimensions: it is a mere geometrical point without\r\nextension in space; it has not the property of impenetrability, for two\r\natoms can, it is supposed, exist at the same point.\r\n\r\nIn modern molecular science according to Maxwell, “we begin by assuming\r\nthat bodies are made up of parts each of which is capable of motion,\r\nand that these parts act on each other in a manner consistent with the\r\nprinciple of the conservation of energy. In making these assumptions\r\nwe are justified by the facts that bodies may be divided into\r\nsmaller parts, and that all bodies with which we are acquainted are\r\nconservative systems, which would not be the case unless their parts\r\nwere also conservative systems.\r\n\r\n“We may also assume that these small parts are in motion. This is the\r\nmost general assumption we can make, for it includes as a particular\r\ncase the theory that the small parts are at rest. The phenomena of the\r\ndiffusion of gases and liquids through each other show that there may\r\nbe a motion of the small parts of a body which is not perceptible to us.\r\n\r\n“We make no assumption with respect to the nature of the small\r\nparts--whether they are all of one magnitude. We do not even assume\r\nthem to have extension and figure. Each of them must be measured by its\r\nmass, and any two of them must, like visible bodies, have the power\r\nof acting on one another when they come near enough to do so. The\r\nproperties of the body or medium are determined by the configuration of\r\nits parts.”\r\n\r\nThese small particles are called molecules, and a molecule in its\r\nphysical aspect was defined by Maxwell in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n    “A molecule of a substance is a small body, such that if, on\r\n    the one hand, a number of similar molecules were assembled\r\n    together, they would form a mass of that substance; while on\r\n    the other hand, if any portion of this molecule were removed,\r\n    it would no longer be able, along with an assemblage of other\r\n    molecules similarly treated, to make up a mass of the original\r\n    substance.”\r\n\r\nWe are to look upon a gas as an assemblage of molecules flying about\r\nin all directions. The path of any molecule is a straight line, except\r\nduring the time when it is under the action of a neighbouring molecule;\r\nthis time is usually small compared with that during which it is free.\r\n\r\nThe simplest theory we could formulate would be that the molecules\r\nbehaved like elastic spheres, and that the action between any two was\r\na collision following the laws which we know apply to the collision of\r\nelastic bodies. If the average distance between two molecules be great\r\ncompared with their dimensions, the time during which any molecule\r\nis in collision will be small compared with the interval between the\r\ncollisions, and this is in accordance with the fundamental assumption\r\njust mentioned. It is not, however, necessary to suppose an encounter\r\nbetween two molecules to be a collision. One molecule may act on\r\nanother with a force, which depends on the distance between them, of\r\nsuch a character that the force is insensible except when the molecules\r\nare extremely close together.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to see how the pressure exerted by a gas on the\r\nsides of a vessel which contains it may be accounted for on this\r\nassumption. Each molecule as it strikes the side has its momentum\r\nreversed--the molecules are here assumed to be perfectly elastic.\r\n\r\nThus each molecule of the gas is continually gaining momentum from\r\nthe sides of the vessel, while it gives up to the vessel the momentum\r\nwhich it possessed before the impact. The rate at which this change of\r\nmomentum proceeds across a given area measures the force exerted on\r\nthat area; the pressure of the gas is the rate of change of momentum\r\nper unit of area of the surface.\r\n\r\nAgain, it can be shown that this pressure is proportional to the\r\nproduct of the mass of each molecule, the number of molecules in a unit\r\nof volume, and the square of the velocity of the molecules.\r\n\r\nLet us consider in the first instance the case of a jet of sand or\r\nwater of unit cross section which is playing against a surface. Suppose\r\nfor the present that all the molecules which strike the surface have\r\nthe same velocity.\r\n\r\nThen the number of molecules which strike the surface per second, will\r\nbe proportional to this velocity. If the particles are moving quickly\r\nthey can reach the surface in one second from a greater distance than\r\nis possible if they be moving slowly. Again, the number reaching the\r\nsurface will be proportional to the number of molecules per unit of\r\nvolume. Hence, if we call _v_ the velocity of each particle, and N\r\nthe number of particles per unit of volume, the number which strike\r\nthe surface in one second will be N _v_; if _m_ be the mass of each\r\nmolecule, the mass which strikes the surface per second is N _m_ _v_;\r\nthe velocity of each particle of this mass is _v_, therefore the\r\nmomentum destroyed per second by the impact is N _m_ _v_ × _v_, or N\r\n_m_ _v_², and this measures the pressure.\r\n\r\nHence in this case if _p_ be the pressure\r\n\r\n  _p_ = N _m_ _v_².\r\n\r\nIn the above we assume that _all_ the molecules in the jet are moving\r\nwith velocity _v_ perpendicular to the surface. In the case of a crowd\r\nof molecules flying about in a closed space this is clearly not true.\r\nThe molecules may strike the surface in any direction; they will not\r\nall be moving normal to the surface. To simplify the case, consider a\r\ncubical box filled with gas. The box has three pairs of equal faces at\r\nright angles. We may suppose one-third of the particles to be moving at\r\nright angles to each face, and in this case the number per unit volume\r\nwhich we have to consider is not N, but ⅓ N. Hence the formula becomes\r\n_p_ = ⅓ N _m_ _v_².\r\n\r\nMoreover, if _ρ_ be the density of the gas--that is, the mass of\r\nunit volume--then N_m_ is equal to _ρ_, for _m_ is the mass of each\r\nparticle, and there are N particles in a unit of volume.\r\n\r\nHence, finally, _p_ = ⅓ _ρ_ _v_².\r\n\r\nOr, again, if V be the volume of unit mass of the gas, then _ρ_ V is\r\nunity, or ρ is equal to 1/V.\r\n\r\nHence _p_V = ⅓_v_².\r\n\r\nFormulæ equivalent to these appear first to have been obtained by\r\nHerapath about the year 1816 (Thomson’s “Annals of Philosophy,” 1816).\r\nThe results only, however, were stated in that year. A paper which\r\nattempted to establish them was presented to the Royal Society in 1820.\r\nIt gave rise to very considerable correspondence, and was withdrawn\r\nby the author before being read. It is printed in full in Thomson’s\r\n“Annals of Philosophy” for 1821, vol. i., pp. 273, 340, 401. The\r\narguments of the author are no doubt open to criticism, and are in many\r\npoints far from sound. Still, by considering the problem of the impact\r\nof a large number of hard bodies, he arrived at a formula connecting\r\nthe pressure and volume of a given mass of gas equivalent to that just\r\ngiven. These results are contained in Propositions viii. and ix. of\r\nHerapath’s paper.\r\n\r\nIn his next step, however, Herapath, as we know now, was wrong. One\r\nof his fundamental assumptions is that the temperature of a gas is\r\nmeasured by the momentum of each of its particles. Hence, assuming\r\nthis, we have T = _m_ _v_, if T represents the temperature: and\r\n\r\n  _p_ = ⅓ N _m_ _v_² = ⅓ (N/_m_) (_m_ _v_)².\r\n\r\nOr, again--\r\n\r\n  _p_ = ⅓ N·T·_v_ = ⅓·(N/_m_)·T².\r\n\r\nThese results are practically given in Proposition viii., Corr. (1)\r\nand (2), and Proposition ix.[49] The temperature as thus defined by\r\nHerapath is an absolute temperature, and he calculates the absolute\r\nzero of temperature at which the gas would have no volume from the\r\nabove results. The actual calculation is of course wrong, for, as\r\nwe know now by experiment, the pressure is proportional to the\r\ntemperature, and not to its square, as Herapath supposed. It will be\r\nseen, however, that Herapath’s formula gives Boyle’s law; for if the\r\ntemperature is constant, the formula is equivalent to\r\n\r\n  _p_ V = a constant.\r\n\r\nHerapath somewhat extended his work in his “Mathematical Physics”\r\npublished in 1847, and applied his principles to explain diffusion, the\r\nrelation between specific heat and atomic weight, and other properties\r\nof bodies. He still, however, retained his erroneous supposition\r\nthat temperature is to be measured by the momentum of the individual\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the theory was made by Waterston. His paper was read\r\nto the Royal Society on March 5th, 1846. It was most unfortunately\r\ncommitted to the Archives of the Society, and was only disinterred by\r\nLord Rayleigh in 1892 and printed in the Transactions for that year.\r\n\r\nIn the account just given of the theory, it has been supposed that all\r\nthe particles move with the same velocity. This is clearly not the\r\ncase in a gas. If at starting all the particles had the same velocity,\r\nthe collisions would change this state of affairs. Some particles will\r\nbe moving quickly, some slowly. We may, however, still apply the\r\ntheory by splitting up the particles into groups, and, supposing that\r\neach group has a constant velocity, the particles in this group will\r\ncontribute to the pressure an amount--_p_₁--equal to ⅓ N₁ _m_ _v_₁²,\r\nwhere _v_₁ is the velocity of the group and N₁ the number of particles\r\nhaving that velocity. The whole pressure will be found by adding that\r\ndue to the various groups, and will be given as before by _p_ = ⅓ N _m_\r\n_v_², where _v_ is not now the actual velocity of the particles, but a\r\nmean velocity given by the equation\r\n\r\n  N _v_² = N₁ _v_₁² + N₂ _v_₂² + .....,\r\n\r\nwhich will produce the same pressure as arises from the actual impacts.\r\nThis quantity v² is known as the _mean square_ of the molecular\r\nvelocity, and is so used by Waterston.\r\n\r\nIn a paper in the _Philosophical Magazine_ for 1858 Waterston gives an\r\naccount of his own paper of 1846 in the following terms:--“Mr. Herapath\r\nunfortunately assumed heat or temperature to be represented by the\r\nsimple ratio of the velocity instead of the square of the velocity,\r\nbeing in this apparently led astray by the definition of motion\r\ngenerally received, and thus was baffled in his attempts to reconcile\r\nhis theory with observation. If we make this change in Mr. Herapath’s\r\ndefinition of heat or temperature--viz., that it is proportional\r\nto the vis-viva or square velocity of the moving particle, not to\r\nthe momentum or simple ratio of the velocity--we can without much\r\ndifficulty deduce not only the primary laws of elastic fluids, but also\r\nthe other physical properties of gases enumerated above in the third\r\nobjection to Newton’s hypothesis. [The paper from which the quotation\r\nis taken is on ‘The Theory of Sound.’] In the Archives of the Royal\r\nSociety for 1845–46 there is a paper on ‘The Physics of Media that\r\nconsist of perfectly “Elastic Molecules in a State of Motion,”’ which\r\ncontains the synthetical reasoning on which the demonstration of these\r\nmatters rests.... This theory does not take account of the size of the\r\nmolecules. It assumes that no time is lost at the impact, and that if\r\nthe impacts produce rotatory motion, the vis viva thus invested bears\r\na constant ratio to the rectilineal vis viva, so as not to require\r\nseparate consideration. It does, also, not take account of the probable\r\ninternal motion of composite molecules; yet the results so closely\r\naccord with observation in every part of the subject as to leave no\r\ndoubt that Mr. Herapath’s idea of the physical constitution of gases\r\napproximates closely to the truth.”\r\n\r\nIn his introduction to Waterston’s paper (Phil. Trans., 1892) Lord\r\nRayleigh writes:--“Impressed with the above passage, and with the\r\ngeneral ingenuity and soundness of Waterston’s views, I took the first\r\nopportunity of consulting the Archives, and saw at once that the memoir\r\njustified the large claims made for it, and that it marks an immense\r\nadvance in the direction of the now generally received theory.”\r\n\r\nIn the first section of the paper Waterston’s great advance consisted\r\nin the statement that the mean square of the kinetic energy of each\r\nmolecule measures the temperature.\r\n\r\nAccording to this we are thus to put in the pressure equation--½ _m_\r\n_v_² = T, the temperature, and we have at once--_p_ V = ⅔ N · T.\r\n\r\nNow this equation expresses, as we know, the laws of Boyle and Gay\r\nLussac.\r\n\r\nThe second section discusses the properties of media, consisting of\r\ntwo or more gases, and arrives at the result that “in mixed media\r\nthe mean square molecular velocity is inversely proportional to the\r\nspecific weights of the molecules.” This was the great law rediscovered\r\nby Maxwell fifteen years later. With modern notation it may be put\r\nthus:--If _m_₁, _m_₂ be the masses of each molecule of two different\r\nsets of molecules mixed together, then, when a steady state has been\r\nreached, since the temperature is the same throughout, _m_₁ _v_₁² is\r\nequal to _m_₂ _v_₂². The average kinetic energy of each molecule is the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nFrom this Avogadros’ law follows at once--for if _p_₁, _p_₂ be the\r\npressures, N₁, N₂ the numbers of molecules per unit volume--\r\n\r\n  _p_₁ = ⅓ N₁ _m_₁ _v_₁²,\r\n  _p_₂ = ⅓ N₂ _m_₂ _v_₂².\r\n\r\nHence, if _p_₁, is equal to _p_₂, since _m_₁ _v_₁² is equal to _m_₂\r\n_v_₂², we must have N₁ equal to N₂, or the number of molecules in equal\r\nvolumes of two gases at the same pressure and temperature is the same.\r\nThe proof of this proposition given by Waterston is not satisfactory.\r\nOn this point, however, we shall have more to say. The third section of\r\nthe paper deals with adiabatic expansion, and in it there is an error\r\nin calculation which prevented correct results from being attained.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the British Association at Ipswich, in 1851, a paper\r\nby J. J. Waterston of Bombay, on “The General Theory of Gases,” was\r\nread. The following is an extract from the Proceedings:--\r\n\r\nThe author “conceives that the atoms of a gas, being perfectly elastic,\r\nare in continual motion in all directions, being constrained within\r\na limited space by their collisions with each other, and with the\r\nparticles of surrounding bodies.\r\n\r\n“The vis viva of these motions in a given portion of a gas constitutes\r\nthe quantity of heat contained in it.\r\n\r\n“He shows that the result of this state of motion must be to give the\r\ngas an elasticity proportional to the mean square of the velocity of\r\nthe molecular motions, and to the total mass of the atoms contained in\r\nunity of bulk” (unit of volume)--that is to say, to the density of the\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\n“The elasticity in a given gas is the measure of temperature.\r\nEquilibrium of pressure and heat between two gases takes place when the\r\nnumber of atoms in unit of volume is equal and the vis viva of each\r\natom equal. Temperature, therefore, in all gases is proportional to the\r\nmass of one atom multiplied by the mean square of the velocity of the\r\nmolecular motions, being measured from an absolute zero 491° below the\r\nzero of Fahrenheit’s thermometer.”\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, from these extracts that the discovery of the\r\nlaws that temperature is measured by the mean kinetic energy of a\r\nsingle molecule, and that in a mixture of gases the mean kinetic energy\r\nof each molecule is the same for each gas, is due to Waterston. They\r\nwere contained in his paper of 1846, and published by him in 1851. Both\r\nthese papers, however, appear to have been unnoticed by all subsequent\r\nwriters until 1892.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1848, Joule’s attention was called by his experiments\r\nto the question, and he saw that Herapath’s result gave a means of\r\ncalculating the mean velocity of the molecules of a gas. For according\r\nto the result given above, _p_ = ⅓ _ρ v_²; thus _v_² = 3 _p/ρ_, and _p_\r\nand _ρ_ being known, we find _v_². Thus for hydrogen at freezing-point\r\nand atmospheric pressure Joule obtains for _v_ the value 6,055 feet per\r\nsecond, or, roughly, six times the velocity of sound in air.\r\n\r\nClausius was the next writer of importance on the subject. His first\r\npaper is in “Poggendorff’s Annalen,” vol. c., 1857, “On the Kind\r\nof Motion we call Heat.” It gives an exposition of the theory, and\r\nestablishes the fact that the kinetic energy of the translatory motion\r\nof a molecule does not represent the whole of the heat it contains. If\r\nwe look upon a molecule as a small solid we must consider the energy it\r\npossesses in consequence of its rotation about its centre of gravity,\r\nas well as the energy due to the motion of translation of the whole.\r\n\r\nClausius’ second paper appeared in 1859. In it he considers the average\r\nlength of the path of a molecule during the interval between two\r\ncollisions. He determines this path in terms of the average distance\r\nbetween the molecules and the distance between the centres of two\r\nmolecules at the time when a collision is taking place.\r\n\r\nThese two papers appear to have attracted Maxwell’s attention to the\r\nmatter, and his first paper, entitled “Illustrations of the Dynamical\r\nTheory of Gases,” was read to the British Association at Aberdeen and\r\nOxford in 1859 and 1860, and appeared in the _Philosophical Magazine_,\r\nJanuary and July, 1860.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to this paper Maxwell points out, while there was\r\nthen no means of measuring the quantities which occurred in Clausius’\r\nexpression for the mean free path, “the phenomena of the internal\r\nfriction of gases, the conduction of heat through a gas, and the\r\ndiffusion of one gas through another, seem to indicate the possibility\r\nof determining accurately the mean length of path which a particle\r\ndescribes between two collisions. In order, therefore, to lay the\r\nfoundation of such investigations on strict mechanical principles,” he\r\ncontinues, “I shall demonstrate the laws of motion of an indefinite\r\nnumber of small, hard and perfectly elastic spheres acting on one\r\nanother only during impact.”\r\n\r\nMaxwell then proceeds to consider in the first case the impact of two\r\nspheres.\r\n\r\nBut a gas consists of an indefinite number of molecules. Now it is\r\nimpossible to deal with each molecule individually, to trace its\r\nhistory and follow its path. In order, therefore, to avoid this\r\ndifficulty Maxwell introduced the statistical method of dealing with\r\nsuch problems, and this introduction is the first great step in\r\nmolecular theory with which his name is connected.\r\n\r\nHe was led to this method by his investigation into the theory of\r\nSaturn’s rings, which had been completed in 1856, and in which he\r\nhad shown that the conditions of stability required the supposition\r\nthat the rings are composed of an indefinite number of free particles\r\nrevolving round the planet, with velocities depending on their\r\ndistances from the centre. These particles may either be arranged in\r\nseparate rings, or their motion may be such that they are continually\r\ncoming into collision with each other.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the statistical method, let us consider a crowd\r\nof people moving along a street. Taken as a whole the crowd moves\r\nsteadily forwards. Any individual in the crowd, however, is jostled\r\nbackwards and forwards and from side to side; if a line were drawn\r\nacross the street we should find people crossing it in both directions.\r\nIn a considerable interval more people would cross it, going in the\r\ndirection in which the crowd is moving, than in the other, and the\r\nvelocity of the crowd might be estimated by counting the number which\r\ncrossed the line in a given interval. This velocity so found would\r\ndiffer greatly from the velocity of any individual, which might have\r\nany value within limits, and which is continually changing. If we knew\r\nthe velocity of each individual and the number of individuals we could\r\ncalculate the average velocity, and this would agree with the value\r\nfound by counting the resultant number of people who cross the line in\r\na given interval.\r\n\r\nAgain, the people in the crowd will naturally fall into groups\r\naccording to their velocities. At any moment there will be a certain\r\nnumber of people whose velocities are all practically equal, or, to be\r\nmore accurate, do not differ among themselves by more than some small\r\nquantity. The number of people at any moment in each of these groups\r\nwill be very different. The number in any group, which has a velocity\r\nnot differing greatly from the mean velocity of the whole, will be\r\nlarge; comparatively few will have either a very large or a very small\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\nAgain, at any moment, individuals are changing from one group to\r\nanother; a man is brought to a stop by some obstruction, and his\r\nvelocity is considerably altered--he passes from one group to a\r\ndifferent one; but while this is so, if the mean velocity remains\r\nconstant, and the size of the crowd be very great, the number of people\r\nat any moment in a given group remains unchanged. People pass from that\r\ngroup into others, but during any interval the same number pass back\r\nagain into that group.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that if this condition is satisfied the distribution is\r\na steady one, and the crowd will continue to move on with the same\r\nuniform mean velocity.\r\n\r\nNow, Maxwell applies these considerations to a crowd of perfectly\r\nelastic spheres, moving anyhow in a closed space, acting upon each\r\nother only when in contact. He shows that they may be divided into\r\ngroups according to their velocities, and that, when the steady state\r\nis reached, the number in each group will remain the same, although the\r\nindividuals change. Moreover, it is shown that, if A and B represent\r\nany two groups, the state will only be steady when the numbers which\r\npass from the group A to the group B are equal to the numbers which\r\npass back from the group B to the group A. This condition, combined\r\nwith the fact that the total kinetic energy of the motion remains\r\nunchanged, enables him to calculate the number of particles in any\r\ngroup in terms of the whole number of particles, the mean velocity, and\r\nthe actual velocity of the group.\r\n\r\nFrom this an accurate expression can be found for the pressure of the\r\ngas, and it is proved that the value found by others, on the assumption\r\nthat all the particles were moving with a common velocity, is correct.\r\nPrevious to this paper of Maxwell’s it had been realised that the\r\nvelocities could not be uniform throughout. There had been no attempt\r\nto determine the distribution of velocity, or to submit the problem to\r\ncalculation, making allowance for the variations in velocity.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s mathematical methods are, in their generality and elegance,\r\nfar in advance of anything previously attempted in the subject.\r\n\r\nSo far it has been assumed that the particles in the vessel are all\r\nalike. Maxwell next takes the case of a mixture of two kinds of\r\nparticles, and inquires what relation must exist between the average\r\nvelocities of these different particles, in order that the state may be\r\nsteady.\r\n\r\nNow, it can be shown that when two elastic spheres impinge the effect\r\nof the impact is always such as to reduce the difference between their\r\nkinetic energies.\r\n\r\nHence, after a very large number of impacts the kinetic energies of the\r\ntwo balls must be the same; the steady state, then, will be reached\r\nwhen each ball has the same kinetic energy.\r\n\r\nThus if _m_₁, _m_₂ be the masses of the particles in the two sets\r\nrespectively, _v_₁, _v_₂ their mean velocities we must have finally--\r\n\r\n  ½ _m_₁ _v_₁² = ½ _m_₂ _v_₂²\r\n\r\nThis is the second of the two great laws enunciated by Waterston in\r\n1845 and 1851, but which, as we have seen, had remained unknown until\r\n1859, when it was again given by Maxwell.\r\n\r\nNow, when gases are mixed their temperatures become equal. Hence we\r\nconclude, in Maxwell’s words, “that the physical condition which\r\ndetermines that the temperature of two gases shall be the same, is that\r\nthe mean kinetic energy of agitation of the individual molecules of the\r\ntwo gases are equal.”\r\n\r\nThus, as the result of Maxwell’s more exact researches on the motion of\r\na system of spherical particles, we find that we again can obtain the\r\nequations--\r\n\r\n  T = ½ _mv_²\r\n  _p_ = ⅓ N _mv_² = ⅔ NT = ⅔ _ρ_ T/_m_\r\n\r\nFrom these results we obtain as before the laws of Boyle, Charles and\r\nAvrogadro.\r\n\r\nAgain if _σ_ be the specific heat of the gas at constant volume, the\r\nquantity of heat required to raise a single molecule of mass _m_ one\r\ndegree will be _σ_ _m_.\r\n\r\nThus, when a molecule is heated, the kinetic energy must increase by\r\nthis amount. But the increase of temperature, which in this case is 1°,\r\nis measured by the increase of kinetic energy of the single molecule.\r\nHence the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a single\r\nmolecule of all gases 1° is the same. Thus the quantity _σ_ _m_ is the\r\nsame for all gases; or, in other words, the specific heat of a gas is\r\ninversely proportional to the mass of its individual molecules. The\r\ndensity of a gas--since the number of molecules per unit volume at\r\na given pressure and temperature is the same for all gases--is also\r\nproportional to the mass of each individual molecule. Thus the specific\r\nheats of all gases are inversely proportional to their densities.\r\nThis is the law discovered experimentally by Dulong and Petit to be\r\napproximately true for a large number of substances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the next part of the paper Maxwell proceeded to determine the\r\naverage number of collisions in a given time, and hence, knowing the\r\nvelocities, to determine, in terms of the size of the particles and\r\ntheir numbers, the mean free path of a particle; the result so found\r\ndiffered somewhat from that already obtained by Clausius.\r\n\r\nHaving done this he showed how, by means of experiments on the\r\nviscosity of gases, the length of the mean free path could be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nAn illustration due to Professor Balfour Stewart will perhaps make this\r\nclear. Let us suppose we have two trains running with uniform speed in\r\nopposite directions on parallel lines, and, further, that the engines\r\ncontinue to work at the same rate, developing just sufficient energy to\r\novercome the resistance of the line, etc., and to maintain the speed\r\nconstant. Now suppose passengers commence to jump across from one train\r\nto the other. Each man carries with him his own momentum, which is in\r\nthe opposite direction to that of the train into which he jumps; the\r\nresult is that the momentum of each train is reduced by the process;\r\nthe velocities of the two decrease; it appears as though a frictional\r\nforce were acting between the two. Maxwell suggests that a similar\r\nprocess will account for the apparent viscosity of gases.\r\n\r\nConsider two streams of gas, moving in opposite directions one over\r\nthe other; it is found that in each case the layers of gas near the\r\nseparating surface move more slowly than those in the interior of\r\nthe streams; there is apparently a frictional force between the two\r\nstreams along this surface, tending to reduce their relative velocity.\r\nMaxwell’s explanation of this is that at the common surface particles\r\nfrom the one stream enter the other, and carry with them their own\r\nmomentum; thus near this surface the momentum of each stream is\r\nreduced, just as the momentum of the trains is reduced by the people\r\njumping across. Internal friction or viscosity is due to the diffusion\r\nof momentum across this common surface. The effect does not penetrate\r\nfar into the gas, for the particles soon acquire the velocity of the\r\nstream to which they have come.\r\n\r\nNow, the rate at which the momentum is diffused will measure the\r\nfrictional force, and will depend on the mean free path of the\r\nparticles. If this is considerable, so that on the average a particle\r\ncan penetrate a considerable distance into the second gas before a\r\ncollision takes place and its motion is changed, the viscosity will be\r\nconsiderable; if, on the other hand, the mean free path is small, the\r\nreverse will be true. Thus it is possible to obtain a relation between\r\nthe mean free path and the coefficient of viscosity, and from this, if\r\nthe coefficient of viscosity be known, a value for the mean free path\r\ncan be found.\r\n\r\nMaxwell, in the paper under discussion, was the first to do this,\r\nand, using a value found by Professor Stokes for the coefficient of\r\nviscosity, obtained as the length of the mean free path of molecules\r\nof air 1/447000 of an inch, while the number of collisions per second\r\nexperienced by each molecule is found to be about 8,077,200,000.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it appeared from his theory that the coefficient of viscosity\r\nshould be independent of the number of molecules of gas present, so\r\nthat it is not altered by varying the density. This result Maxwell\r\ncharacterises as startling, and he instituted an elaborate series of\r\nexperiments a few years later with a view of testing it. The reason\r\nfor this result will appear if we remember that, when the density is\r\ndecreased, the mean free path is increased; relatively, then, to the\r\ntotal number of molecules present, the number which cross the surface\r\nin a given time is increased. And it appears from Maxwell’s result that\r\nthis relative increase is such that the total number crossing remains\r\nunchanged. Hence the momentum conveyed across each unit area per second\r\nremains the same, in spite of the decrease in density.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of the same investigation is that the coefficient\r\nof viscosity is proportional to the mean velocity of the molecules.\r\nSince the absolute temperature is proportional to the square of the\r\nvelocity, it follows that the coefficient of viscosity is proportional\r\nto the square root of the absolute temperature.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the paper deals with the process of diffusion of two\r\nor more kinds of moving particles among one another.\r\n\r\nIf two different gases are placed in two vessels separated by a porous\r\ndiaphragm such as a piece of unglazed earthenware, or connected by\r\nmeans of a narrow tube, Graham had shewn that, after sufficient time\r\nhas elapsed, the two are mixed together. The same process takes place\r\nwhen two gases of different density are placed together in the same\r\nvessel. At first the denser gas may be at the bottom, the less dense\r\nabove, but after a time the two are found to be uniformly distributed\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nMaxwell attempted to calculate from his theory the rate at which\r\nthe diffusion takes place in these cases. The conditions of most of\r\nGraham’s experiments were too complicated to admit of direct comparison\r\nwith the theory, from which it appeared that there is a relation\r\nbetween the mean free path and the rate of diffusion. One experiment,\r\nhowever, was found, the conditions of which could be made the subject\r\nof calculation, and from it Maxwell obtained as the value of the mean\r\nfree path in air 1/389000 of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe number was close enough to that found from the viscosity to afford\r\nsome confirmation of his theory.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few years later Clausius criticised the details of this\r\npart of the paper, and Maxwell, in his memoir of 1866, admits the\r\ncalculation to have been erroneous. The main principles remained\r\nunaffected, the molecules pass from one gas to the other, and this\r\nconstitutes diffusion.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose we have two sets of particles in contact of such a nature\r\nthat the mean kinetic energy of the one set is different from that of\r\nthe other; the temperatures of the two will then be different. These\r\ntwo sets will diffuse into each other, and the diffusing particles will\r\ncarry with them their kinetic energy, which will gradually pass from\r\nthose which have the greater energy to those which have the less, until\r\nthe average kinetic energy is equalised throughout. But the kinetic\r\nenergy of translation is the heat of the particles. This diffusion of\r\nkinetic energy is a diffusion of heat by conduction, and we have here\r\nthe mechanical theory of the conduction of heat in a gas.\r\n\r\nMaxwell obtained an expression, which, however, he afterwards modified,\r\nfor the conductivity of a gas in terms of the mean free path. It\r\nfollowed from this that the conductivity of air was only about 1/7000\r\nof that of copper.\r\n\r\nThus the diffusion of gases, the viscosity of gases, and the conduction\r\nof heat in gases, are all connected with the diffusion of the particles\r\ncarrying with them their momenta and their energy; while values of the\r\nmean free path can be obtained from observations on any one of these\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nIn the third part of his paper Maxwell considers the consequences\r\nof supposing the particles not to be spherical. In this case the\r\nimpacts would tend to set up a motion of rotation in the particles.\r\nThe direction of the force acting on any particle at impact would not\r\nnecessarily pass through its centre; thus by impact the velocity of its\r\ncentre would be changed, and in addition the particles would be made to\r\nspin. Some part, therefore, of the energy of the particles will appear\r\nin the form of the translational energy of their centres, while the\r\nrest will take the form of rotational energy of each particle about its\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nIt follows from Maxwell’s work that for each particle the average value\r\nof these two portions of energy would be equal. The total energy will\r\nbe half translational and half rotational.\r\n\r\nThis theorem, in a more general form which was afterwards given to\r\nit, has led to much discussion, and will be again considered later.\r\nFor the present we will assume it to be true. Clausius had already\r\ncalled attention to the fact that some of the energy must be rotational\r\nunless the molecules be smooth spheres, and had given some reasons\r\nfor supposing that the ratio of the whole energy to the energy of\r\ntranslation is in a steady state a constant. Maxwell shows that for\r\nrigid bodies this constant is 2. Let us denote it for the present by\r\nthe symbol β. Thus, if the translational energy of a molecule is ½ _m_\r\n_v_², its whole energy is ½ β _m_ _v_².\r\n\r\nThe temperature is still measured by the translational energy, or ½ _m_\r\n_v_²; the heat depends on the whole energy. Hence if H represent the\r\namount of heat--measured as energy--contained by a single molecule,\r\nand T its temperature, we have--\r\n\r\n  H = βT\r\n\r\nFrom this it can be shewn[50] that if γ represent the ratio of the\r\nspecific heat of a gas at constant pressure to the specific heat at\r\nconstant volume, then--\r\n\r\n  β = ⅔ 1/(γ-1)\r\n\r\nFor air and some other gases the value of γ has been shown to be 1·408.\r\nFrom this it follows that β = 1·634. Now, Maxwell’s theory required\r\nthat for smooth hard particles, approximately spherical in shape, β\r\nshould be 2, and hence he concludes “we have shown that a system of\r\nsuch particles could not possibly satisfy the known relation between\r\nthe two specific heats of all gases.”\r\n\r\nSince this statement was made many more experiments on the value of γ\r\nhave been undertaken; it is not equal to 1·408 for _all_ gases. Hence\r\nthe value of β is different for various gases.\r\n\r\nIt is of some importance to notice that the value of β just found for\r\nair is very approximately 1·66 or 5/3.\r\n\r\nFor mercury vapour the value of γ has been shown by Kundt to be 1·33\r\nor 1⅓, and hence β is equal to 1. Thus all the energy of a particle of\r\nmercury vapour is translational, and its behaviour in this respect is\r\nconsistent with the assumption that a particle of mercury vapour is a\r\nsmooth sphere.\r\n\r\nThe two results of this theory which seemed to lend themselves most\r\nreadily to experimental verification were (1) that the viscosity of\r\na gas is independent of its density, and (2) that it is proportional\r\nto the square root of the absolute temperature. The next piece\r\nof work connected with the theory was an attempt to test these\r\nconsequences, and a description of the experiments was published in the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions” for 1865, in a paper on the “Viscosity\r\nor Internal Friction of Air and other Gases,” and forms the Bakerian\r\nlecture for that year.\r\n\r\nThe first result was completely proved. It is shewn that the value of\r\nthe coefficient[51] of viscosity “is the same for air at 0·5 inch and\r\nat 30 inches pressure, provided that the temperature remains the same.”\r\n\r\nIt was clear also that the viscosity depended on the temperature,\r\nand the results of the experiments seemed to show that it was nearly\r\nproportional to the absolute temperature. Thus for two temperatures,\r\n185° Fah. and 51° Fah., the ratio of the two coefficients found was\r\n1·2624; the ratio of the two temperatures, each measured from absolute\r\nzero, is 1·2605.\r\n\r\nThis result, then, does not agree with the hypothesis that a gas\r\nconsists of spherical molecules acting only on each other by a kind of\r\nimpact, for, if this were so, the coefficient would, as we have seen,\r\ndepend on the square root of the absolute temperature. But Maxwell’s\r\nresult, connecting viscosity with the first power of the absolute\r\ntemperature, has not been confirmed by other investigators. According\r\nto it we should have as the relation between μ, the coefficient of\r\nviscosity at t° and μ₀, that at zero the equation--\r\n\r\n  μ = μ₀ (1 + .00365 t).\r\n\r\nThe most recent results of Professor Holman (_Philosophical Magazine_,\r\nVol. xxi., p. 212) give--\r\n\r\n  μ = μ₀ (1 + .00275 t - .00000034 t²).\r\n\r\nAnd results similar to this are given by O. E. Meyer, Puluj, and\r\nObermeyer. Maxwell’s coefficient ·00365 is too large, but ·00182, the\r\ncoefficient obtained by supposing the viscosity proportional to the\r\nsquare root of the temperature, would be too small.\r\n\r\nIt still remains true, therefore, that the laws of the viscosity of\r\ngases cannot be explained by the hypothesis of the impact of hard\r\nspheres; but some deductions drawn by Maxwell in his next paper from\r\nhis supposed law of proportionality to the first power of the absolute\r\ntemperature require modification.\r\n\r\nIt was clear from his experiments just described that the simple\r\nhypothesis of the impact of elastic bodies would not account for all\r\nthe phenomena observed. Accordingly, in 1866, Maxwell took up the\r\nproblem in a more general form in his paper on the “Dynamical Theory of\r\nGases,” Phil. Trans., 1866.\r\n\r\nIn it he considered the molecules of the gas not as elastic spheres\r\nof definite radius, but as small bodies, or groups of smaller\r\nmolecules, repelling one another with a force whose direction always\r\npasses very nearly through the centre of gravity of the molecules,\r\nand whose magnitude is represented very nearly by some function of\r\nthe distance of the centres of gravity. “I have made,” he continues,\r\n“this modification of the theory in consequence of the results of my\r\nexperiments on the viscosity of air at different temperatures, and I\r\nhave deduced from these experiments that the repulsion is inversely as\r\nthe fifth power of the distance.”\r\n\r\nSince more recent observation has shown that the numerical results of\r\nMaxwell’s work connecting viscosity and temperature are erroneous, this\r\nlast deduction does not hold; the inverse fifth power law of force\r\nwill not give the correct relation between viscosity and temperature.\r\nMaxwell himself at a later date, “On the Stresses in Rarefied Gases,”\r\nPhil. Trans., 1879, realised this; but even in this last paper he\r\nadhered to the fifth power law because it leads to an important\r\nsimplification in the equations to be dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe paper of 1866 is chiefly important because it contains for the\r\nfirst time the application of general dynamical methods to molecular\r\nproblems. The law of the distribution of velocities among the molecules\r\nis again investigated, and a result practically identical with that\r\nfound for the elastic spheres is arrived at. In obtaining this\r\nconclusion, however, it is assumed that the distribution of velocities\r\nis uniform in all directions about any point, whatever actions may be\r\ntaking place in the gas. If, for example, the temperature is different\r\nat different points, then, for a given velocity, all directions are not\r\nequally probable. Maxwell’s expression, therefore, for the number of\r\nmolecules which at any moment have a given velocity only applies to the\r\npermanent state in which the distribution of temperature is uniform.\r\nWhen dealing, for example, with the conduction of heat, a modification\r\nof the expression is necessary. This was pointed out by Boltzmann.[52]\r\n\r\nIn the paper of 1866, Maxwell applies his generalised results to the\r\nfinal distribution of two gases under the action of gravity, the\r\nequilibrium of temperature between two gases, and the distribution of\r\ntemperature in a vertical column. These results are, as he states,\r\nindependent of the law of force between the molecules. The dynamical\r\ncauses of diffusion viscosity and conduction of heat are dealt with,\r\nand these involve the law of force.\r\n\r\nIt follows also from the investigation that, on the hypotheses assumed\r\nas its basis, if two kinds of gases be mixed, the difference between\r\nthe average kinetic energies of translation of the gases of each kind\r\ndiminishes rapidly in consequence of the action between the two. The\r\naverage kinetic energy of translation, therefore, tends to become the\r\nsame for each kind of gas, and as before, it is this average energy of\r\ntranslation which measures the temperature.\r\n\r\nA molecule in the theory is a portion of a gas which moves about as a\r\nsingle body. It may be a mere point, a centre of force having inertia,\r\ncapable of doing work while losing velocity. There may be also in each\r\nmolecule systems of several such centres of force bound together by\r\ntheir mutual actions. Again, a molecule may be a small solid body of\r\ndeterminate form; but in this case we must, as Maxwell points out,\r\nintroduce a new set of forces binding together the parts of each\r\nmolecule: we must have a molecular theory of the second order. In any\r\ncase, the most general supposition made is that a molecule consists of\r\na series of parts which stick together, but are capable of relative\r\nmotion among each other.\r\n\r\nIn this case the kinetic energy of the molecule consists of the energy\r\nof its centre of gravity, together with the energy of its component\r\nparts, relative to its centre of gravity.[53]\r\n\r\nNow Clausius had, as we have seen, given reasons for believing that the\r\nratio of the whole energy of a molecule to the energy of translation of\r\nits centre of gravity tends to become constant. We have already used β\r\nto denote this constant. Thus, while the temperature is measured by the\r\naverage kinetic energy of translation of the centre of gravity of each\r\nmolecule, the heat contained in a molecule is its whole energy, and is\r\nβ times this quantity. Thus the conclusions as to specific heat, etc.,\r\nalready given on page 130, apply in this case, and in particular we\r\nhave the result that if γ be the ratio of the specific heat at constant\r\npressure to that at constant volume, then--\r\n\r\n  β = ⅔ 1/(γ-1)\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s theorem of the distribution of kinetic energy among a system\r\nof molecules applied, as he gave it in 1866, to the kinetic energy of\r\ntranslation of the centre of gravity of each molecule. Two years later\r\nDr. Boltzmann, in the paper we have already referred to, extended\r\nit (under certain limitations) to the parts of which a molecule is\r\ncomposed. According to Maxwell the average kinetic energy of the centre\r\nof gravity of each molecule tends to become the same. According to\r\nBoltzmann the average kinetic energy of each part of the molecule tends\r\nto become the same.\r\n\r\nMaxwell, in the last paper he wrote on the subject (“On Boltzmann’s\r\nTheorem on the Average Distribution of Energy in a System of\r\nMaterial Points,” Camb. Phil. Trans., XII.), took up this problem.\r\nWatson had given a proof of it in 1876 differing from Boltzmann’s,\r\nbut still limited by the stipulation that the time, during which a\r\nparticle is encountering other particles, is very small compared with\r\nthe time during which there is no sensible action between it and\r\nother particles, and also that the time during which a particle is\r\nsimultaneously within the distance of more than one other particle may\r\nbe neglected.\r\n\r\nMaxwell claims that his proof is free from any such limitation. The\r\nmaterial points may act on each other at all distances, and according\r\nto any law which is consistent with the conservation of energy; they\r\nmay also be acted on by forces external to the system, provided these\r\nare consistent with that law.\r\n\r\nThe only assumption which is necessary for the direct proof is that\r\nthe system, if left to itself in its actual state of motion, will\r\nsooner or later pass through every phase which is consistent with the\r\nconservation of energy.\r\n\r\nIn this paper Maxwell finds in a very general manner an expression for\r\nthe number of molecules which at any time have a given velocity, and\r\nthis, when simplified by the assumptions of the former papers, reduces\r\nto the form already found. He also shows that the average kinetic\r\nenergy corresponding to any one of the variables which define his\r\nsystem is the same for every one of the variables of his system.\r\n\r\nThus, according to this theorem, if each molecule be a single small\r\nsolid body, six variables will be required to determine the position\r\nof each, three variables will give us the position of the centre of\r\ngravity of the molecule, while three others will determine the position\r\nof the body relative to its centre of gravity. If the six variables\r\nbe properly chosen, the kinetic energy can be expressed as a sum of\r\nsix squares, one square corresponding to each variable. According to\r\nthe theorem the part of the kinetic energy depending on each square is\r\nthe same. Thus, the whole energy is six times as great as that which\r\narises from any one of the variables. The kinetic energy of translation\r\nis three times as great as that arising from each variable, for it\r\ninvolves the three variables which determine the position of the centre\r\nof gravity. Hence, if we denote by K the kinetic energy due to one\r\nvariable, the whole energy is 6 K, and the translational energy is 3 K;\r\nthus, for this case--\r\n\r\n  β = 6K/3K = 2\r\n\r\nOr, again, if we suppose that the molecule is such that _m_ variables\r\nare required to determine its position relatively to its centre of\r\ngravity, since 3 are needed to fix the centre of gravity, the total\r\nnumber of variables defining the position of the molecule is _m_ + 3,\r\nand it is said to have _m_ + 3 degrees of freedom. Hence, in this case,\r\nits total energy is (_m_ + 3) K and its energy of translation is 3 K,\r\nthus we find--\r\n\r\n  β = (_m_ + 3)/3\r\n\r\n  Hence γ = 1 + 2/(_m_ + 3) = 1 + 2/_n_\r\n\r\nif _n_ be the number of degrees of freedom of the molecule.\r\n\r\nThus, if this Boltzmann-Maxwell theorem be true, the specific heat of a\r\ngas will depend solely on the number of degrees of freedom of each of\r\nits molecules. For hard rigid bodies we should have _n_ equal to 6, and\r\nhence γ = 1·333. Now the fact that this is not the value of γ for any\r\nof the known gases is a fundamental difficulty in the way of accepting\r\nthe complete theory.\r\n\r\nBoltzmann has called attention to the fact that if _n_ be equal to\r\nfive, then γ has the value 1·40. And this agrees fairly with the value\r\nfound by experiment for air, oxygen, nitrogen, and various other gases.\r\nWe will, however, return to this point shortly.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no result in the domain of physical science in\r\nrecent years which has been more discussed than the two fundamental\r\ntheorems of the molecular theory which we owe to Maxwell and to\r\nBoltzmann.\r\n\r\nThe two results in question are (1) the expression for the number of\r\nmolecules which at any moment will have a given velocity, and (2) the\r\nproposition that the kinetic energy is ultimately equally divided\r\namong all the variables which determine the system.\r\n\r\nWith regard to (1) Maxwell showed that his error law was one possible\r\ncondition of permanence. If at any moment the velocities are\r\ndistributed according to the error law, that distribution will be a\r\npermanent one. He did not prove that such a distribution is the only\r\none which can satisfy all the conditions of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe proof that this law is a necessary, as well as a sufficient,\r\ncondition of permanence was first given by Boltzmann, for a single\r\nmonatomic gas in 1872, for a mixture of such gases in 1886, and for a\r\npolyatomic gas in 1887. Other proofs have been given since by Watson\r\nand Burbury. It would be quite beyond the limits of this book to go\r\ninto the question of the completeness or sufficiency of the proofs. The\r\ndiscussion of the question is still in progress.\r\n\r\nThe British Association Report for 1894 contains an important\r\ncontribution to the question, in the shape of a report by Mr. G. H.\r\nBryan, and the discussion he started at Oxford by reading this report\r\nhas been continued in the pages of _Nature_ and elsewhere since that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan shows in the first place what may be the nature of the\r\nsystems of molecules to which the results will apply, and discusses\r\nvarious points of difficulty in the proof.\r\n\r\nThe theorem in question, from which the result (1) follows as a simple\r\ndeduction, has been thus stated by Dr. Larmor.[54]\r\n\r\n“There exists a positive function belonging to a group of molecules\r\nwhich, as they settle themselves into a steady state--on the average\r\nderived from a great number of configurations--maintains a steady\r\ndownward trend. The Maxwell-Boltzmann steady state is the one in which\r\nthis function has finally attained its minimum value, and is thus a\r\nunique steady state, it still being borne in mind that this is only a\r\nproposition of averages derived from a great number of instances in\r\nwhich nothing is conserved in encounters, except the energy, and that\r\nexceptional circumstances may exist, comparatively very few in number,\r\nin which the trend is, at any rate, temporarily the other way.”\r\n\r\nThis theorem, when applied to cases of motion, such as that of a gas at\r\nconstant temperature enclosed in a rigid envelope impermeable to heat,\r\nappears to be proved. For such a case, therefore, the Maxwell-Boltzmann\r\nlaw is the only one possible.\r\n\r\nBut whether this be so or not, the law first introduced by Maxwell is\r\none of those possible, and the advance in molecular science due to its\r\nintroduction is enormous.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the second result, the equal partition of the energy\r\namong all the degrees of freedom of each molecule. Lord Kelvin\r\nhas pointed out a flaw in Maxwell’s proof, but Boltzmann showed\r\n(_Philosophical Magazine_, March, 1893) how this flaw can easily\r\nbe corrected, and it may be said that in all cases in which the\r\nBoltzmann-Maxwell law of the distribution of velocities holds,\r\nMaxwell’s law of the equal partition of energy holds also.\r\n\r\nThree cases are considered by Mr. Bryan, in which the law of\r\ndistribution fails for rigid molecules: the first is when the molecules\r\nhave all, in addition to their velocities of agitation, a common\r\nvelocity of translation in a fixed direction; the second is when the\r\ngas has a motion of uniform rotation about a fixed axis; while the\r\nthird is when each molecule has an axis of symmetry. In this last case\r\nthe forces acting during a collision necessarily pass through the\r\naxis of symmetry, the angular velocity, therefore, of any molecule\r\nabout this axis remains constant, the number of molecules having a\r\ngiven angular velocity will remain the same throughout the motion,\r\nand the part of the kinetic energy which depends on this component of\r\nthe motion will remain fixed, and will not come into consideration\r\nwhen dealing with the equal partition of the energy among the various\r\ndegrees of freedom.\r\n\r\nSuch a molecule has five, and not six, degrees of freedom; three\r\nquantities are needed to determine the position of its centre of\r\ngravity, and two to fix the position of the axis of symmetry.\r\n\r\nIn this case, then, as Boltzmann points out, in the expression for the\r\nratio of the specific heats, we must have _n_ equal to 5, and hence\r\n\r\n  γ = 1 + 2/_n_ = 1 + 2/5 = 1·4\r\n\r\nagreeing fairly with the value found for air and various other\r\npermanent gases.\r\n\r\nFor cases, then, in which we consider each atom as a single rigid body,\r\nthe Boltzmann-Maxwell theorem appears to give a unique solution,\r\nand the Maxwell law of the distribution of the energy to be in fair\r\naccordance with the results of observation.[55]\r\n\r\nIf we can never go further--and it must be admitted that the\r\ndifficulties in the way of further advance are enormous--it may,\r\nI think, be claimed for Maxwell that the progress already made is\r\ngreatly due to him. Both these laws, for the case of elastic spheres,\r\nare contained in his first paper of 1860; and while it is to the\r\ngenius of Boltzmann that we owe their earliest generalisation, and in\r\nparticular the proof of the uniqueness of the solution under proper\r\nrestrictions, Maxwell’s last paper contributed in no small degree to\r\nthe security of the position. Not merely the foundations, but much of\r\nthe superstructure of molecular science is his work.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of advance are, as we have said, enormous.\r\nBoltzmann, in one of his papers, has considered the properties of a\r\ncomplex molecule of a gas, consisting maybe of a number of atoms and\r\npossibly of ether atoms bound with them, and he concludes that such a\r\nmolecule will behave in its progressive motion, and in its collisions\r\nwith other molecules, nearly like a rigid body. But to quote from Mr.\r\nBryan: “The case of a polyatomic molecule, whose atoms are capable of\r\nvibrating relative to one another, affords an interesting field for\r\ninvestigation and speculation. Is the Boltzmann distribution still\r\nunique, or do other permanent distributions exist in which the kinetic\r\nenergy is unequally divided?”\r\n\r\nAgain, the spectroscope reveals to us vibrations of the ether, which\r\nare connected in some way with the vibrations of the molecules of\r\ngas, whose spectrum we are observing. It seems clear that the law of\r\nequal partition does not apply to these, and yet, if we are to suppose\r\nthat the ether vibrations are due to actual vibrations of the atoms\r\nwhich constitute a molecule, why does it not apply? Where does the\r\ncondition come in which leads to failure in the proof? Or, again,\r\nis it, as has been suggested, the fact that the complex spectrum\r\nof a gas represents the terms of a Fourier Series, into which some\r\nelaborate vibration of the atoms is resolved by the ether? or is the\r\nspectrum due simply to electro-magnetic vibrations on the surface of\r\nthe molecules--vibrations whose period is determined chiefly by the\r\nsize and shape of the molecule, but in which the atoms of which it is\r\ncomposed take part? There are grave difficulties in the way of either\r\nof these explanations, but we must not let our dread of the task which\r\nremains to be done blind our eyes to the greatness of Maxwell’s work.\r\n\r\nOne other important paper, and a number of shorter articles, remain to\r\nbe mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Boltzmann-Maxwell law applies only to cases in which the\r\ntemperature is uniform throughout. In a paper published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for 1879, on “Stresses in Rarefied Gases\r\nArising from Inequalities of Temperature,” Maxwell deals, among other\r\nmatters, with the theory of the radiometer. He shows that the observed\r\nmotions will not take place unless gas, in contact with a solid, can\r\nslide along the surface of the solid with a finite velocity between\r\nplaces where the temperature is different; and in an appendix he proves\r\nthat, on certain assumptions regarding the nature of the contact of the\r\nsolid and the gas, there will be, even when the pressure is constant, a\r\nflow of gas along the surface from the colder to the hotter parts.\r\n\r\nAmong his less important papers bearing on molecular theory must be\r\nmentioned a lecture on “Molecules” to the British Association at its\r\nBradford meeting; “Scientific Papers of Clerk Maxwell,” vol. ii., p.\r\n361; and another on “The Molecular Constitution of Bodies,” Scientific\r\nPapers, vol. ii., p. 418.\r\n\r\nIn this latter, and also in a review in _Nature_ of Van der Waals’\r\nbook on “The Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States,”[56] he\r\nexplains and discusses Clausius’ virial equation, by means of which the\r\nvariations of the permanent gases from Boyle’s law are explained. The\r\nlecture gives a clear account, in Maxwell’s own inimitable style, of\r\nthe advances made in the kinetic theory up to the date at which it was\r\ndelivered, and puts clearly the difficulties it has to meet. Maxwell\r\nthought that those arising from the known values of the ratio of the\r\nspecific heats were the most serious.\r\n\r\nIn the articles, “Atomic Constitution of Bodies” and “Diffusion,” in\r\nthe ninth edition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, we have Maxwell’s\r\nlater views on the fundamental assumptions of the molecular theory.\r\n\r\nThe text-book on “Heat” contains some further developments of the\r\ntheory. In particular he shows how the conclusions of the second law\r\nof thermo-dynamics are connected with the fact that the coarseness of\r\nour faculties will not allow us to grapple with individual molecules.\r\n\r\nThe work described in the foregoing chapters would have been sufficient\r\nto secure to Maxwell a distinguished place among those who have\r\nadvanced our knowledge; it remains still to describe his greatest work,\r\nhis theory of Electricity and Magnetism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC WORK.--ELECTRICAL THEORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nClerk Maxwell’s first electrical paper--that on Faraday’s “Lines of\r\nForce”--was read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society on December\r\n10th, 1855, and Part II. on February 11th, 1856. The author was then a\r\nBachelor of Arts, only twenty-three years in age, and of less than one\r\nyear’s standing from the time of taking his degree.\r\n\r\nThe opening words of the paper are as follows (Scientific Papers, vol.\r\ni., p. 155):--\r\n\r\n    “The present state of electrical science seems peculiarly\r\n    unfavourable to speculation. The laws of the distribution of\r\n    electricity on the surface of conductors have been analytically\r\n    deduced from experiment; some parts of the mathematical\r\n    theory of magnetism are established, while in other parts the\r\n    experimental data are wanting; the theory of the conduction of\r\n    galvanism, and that of the mutual attraction of conductors,\r\n    have been reduced to mathematical formulæ, but have not\r\n    fallen into relation with the other parts of the science. No\r\n    electrical theory can now be put forth, unless it shows the\r\n    connection, not only between electricity at rest and current\r\n    electricity, but between the attractions and inductive effects\r\n    of electricity in both states. Such a theory must accurately\r\n    satisfy those laws, the mathematical form of which is known,\r\n    and must afford the means of calculating the effects in the\r\n    limiting cases where the known formulæ are inapplicable.\r\n    In order, therefore, to appreciate the requirements of the\r\n    science, the student must make himself familiar with a\r\n    considerable body of most intricate mathematics, the mere\r\n    retention of which in the memory materially interferes with\r\n    further progress. The first process, therefore, in the\r\n    effectual study of the science, must be one of simplification\r\n    and reduction of the results of previous investigation to a\r\n    form in which the mind can grasp them. The results of this\r\n    simplification may take the form of a purely mathematical\r\n    formula or of a physical hypothesis. In the first case we\r\n    entirely lose sight of the phenomena to be explained; and\r\n    though we may trace out the consequences of given laws, we can\r\n    never obtain more extended views of the connections of the\r\n    subject. If, on the other hand, we adopt a physical hypothesis,\r\n    we see the phenomena only through a medium, and are liable\r\n    to that blindness to facts and rashness in assumption which\r\n    a partial explanation encourages. We must therefore discover\r\n    some method of investigation which allows the mind at every\r\n    step to lay hold of a clear physical conception, without being\r\n    committed to any theory founded on the physical science from\r\n    which that conception is borrowed, so that it is neither drawn\r\n    aside from the subject in pursuit of analytical subtleties, nor\r\n    carried beyond the truth by a favourite hypothesis.\r\n\r\n    “In order to obtain physical ideas without adopting a physical\r\n    theory we must make ourselves familiar with the existence of\r\n    physical analogies. By a physical analogy I mean that partial\r\n    similarity between the laws of one science and those of another\r\n    which makes each of them illustrate the other. Thus all the\r\n    mathematical sciences are founded on relations between physical\r\n    laws and laws of numbers, so that the aim of exact science\r\n    is to reduce the problems of Nature to the determination of\r\n    quantities by operations with members. Passing from the most\r\n    universal of all analogies to a very partial one, we find the\r\n    same resemblance in mathematical form between two different\r\n    phenomena giving rise to a physical theory of light.\r\n\r\n    “The changes of direction which light undergoes in passing from\r\n    one medium to another are identical with the deviations of the\r\n    path of a particle in moving through a narrow space in which\r\n    intense forces act. This analogy, which extends only to the\r\n    direction, and not to the velocity of motion, was long believed\r\n    to be the true explanation of the refraction of light; and we\r\n    still find it useful in the solution of certain problems, in\r\n    which we employ it without danger as an artificial method. The\r\n    other analogy, between light and the vibrations of an elastic\r\n    medium, extends much farther, but, though its importance and\r\n    fruitfulness cannot be over-estimated, we must recollect that\r\n    it is founded only on a resemblance _in form_ between the\r\n    laws of light and those of vibrations. By stripping it of its\r\n    physical dress and reducing it to a theory of ‘transverse\r\n    alternations,’ we might obtain a system of truth strictly\r\n    founded on observation, but probably deficient both in the\r\n    vividness of its conceptions and the fertility of its method.\r\n    I have said thus much on the disputed questions of optics, as\r\n    a preparation for the discussion of the almost universally\r\n    admitted theory of attraction at a distance.\r\n\r\n    “We have all acquired the mathematical conception of these\r\n    attractions. We can reason about them and determine their\r\n    appropriate forms or formulæ. These formulæ have a distinct\r\n    mathematical significance, and their results are found to be\r\n    in accordance with natural phenomena. There is no formula\r\n    in applied mathematics more consistent with Nature than the\r\n    formula of attractions, and no theory better established in\r\n    the minds of men than that of the action of bodies on one\r\n    another at a distance. The laws of the conduction of heat in\r\n    uniform media appear at first sight among the most different in\r\n    their physical relations from those relating to attractions.\r\n    The quantities which enter into them are _temperature_, _flow\r\n    of heat_, _conductivity_. The word _force_ is foreign to the\r\n    subject. Yet we find that the mathematical laws of the uniform\r\n    motion of heat in homogeneous media are identical in form\r\n    with those of attractions varying inversely as the square of\r\n    the distance. We have only to substitute _source of heat_ for\r\n    _centre of attraction_, _flow of heat_ for _accelerating effect\r\n    of attraction_ at any point, and _temperature_ for _potential_,\r\n    and the solution of a problem in attractions is transformed\r\n    into that of a problem in heat.\r\n\r\n    “This analogy between the formulæ of heat and attraction was, I\r\n    believe, first pointed out by Professor William Thomson in the\r\n    _Cambridge Mathematical Journal_, Vol. III.\r\n\r\n    “Now the conduction of heat is supposed to proceed by an\r\n    action between contiguous parts of a medium, while the force\r\n    of attraction is a relation between distant bodies, and yet,\r\n    if we knew nothing more than is expressed in the mathematical\r\n    formulæ, there would be nothing to distinguish between the one\r\n    set of phenomena and the other.\r\n\r\n    “It is true that, if we introduce other considerations and\r\n    observe additional facts, the two subjects will assume very\r\n    different aspects, but the mathematical resemblance of some\r\n    of their laws will remain, and may still be made useful in\r\n    exciting appropriate mathematical ideas.\r\n\r\n    “It is by the use of analogies of this kind that I have\r\n    attempted to bring before the mind, in a convenient and\r\n    manageable form, those mathematical ideas which are necessary\r\n    to the study of the phenomena of electricity. The methods are\r\n    generally those suggested by the processes of reasoning which\r\n    are found in the researches of Faraday, and which, though they\r\n    have been interpreted mathematically by Professor Thomson and\r\n    others, are very generally supposed to be of an indefinite and\r\n    unmathematical character, when compared with those employed by\r\n    the professed mathematicians. By the method which I adopt, I\r\n    hope to render it evident that I am not attempting to establish\r\n    any physical theory of a science in which I have hardly made\r\n    a single experiment, and that the limit of my design is to\r\n    show how, by a strict application of the ideas and methods\r\n    of Faraday, the connection of the very different orders of\r\n    phenomena which he has discovered may be clearly placed before\r\n    the mathematical mind. I shall therefore avoid as much as I can\r\n    the introduction of anything which does not serve as a direct\r\n    illustration of Faraday’s methods, or of the mathematical\r\n    deductions which may be made from them. In treating the simpler\r\n    parts of the subject I shall use Faraday’s mathematical methods\r\n    as well as his ideas. When the complexity of the subject\r\n    requires it, I shall use analytical notation, still confining\r\n    myself to the development of ideas originated by the same\r\n    philosopher.\r\n\r\n    “I have in the first place to explain and illustrate the idea\r\n    of ‘lines of force.’\r\n\r\n    “When a body is electrified in any manner, a small body\r\n    charged with positive electricity, and placed in any given\r\n    position, will experience a force urging it in a certain\r\n    direction. If the small body be now negatively electrified, it\r\n    will be urged by an equal force in a direction exactly opposite.\r\n\r\n    “The same relations hold between a magnetic body and the north\r\n    or south poles of a small magnet. If the north pole is urged\r\n    in one direction, the south pole is urged in the opposite\r\n    direction.\r\n\r\n    “In this way we might find a line passing through any point\r\n    of space, such that it represents the direction of the\r\n    force acting on a positively electrified particle, or on an\r\n    elementary north pole, and the reverse direction of the force\r\n    on a negatively electrified particle or an elementary south\r\n    pole. Since at every point of space such a direction may be\r\n    found, if we commence at any point and draw a line so that,\r\n    as we go along it, its direction at any point shall always\r\n    coincide with that of the resultant force at that point, this\r\n    curve will indicate the direction of that force for every point\r\n    through which it passes, and might be called on that account a\r\n    _line of force_. We might in the same way draw other lines of\r\n    force, till we had filled all space with curves indicating by\r\n    their direction that of the force at any assigned point.\r\n\r\n    “We should thus obtain a geometrical model of the physical\r\n    phenomena, which would tell us the _direction_ of the force,\r\n    but we should still require some method of indicating the\r\n    _intensity_ of the force at any point. If we consider these\r\n    curves not as mere lines, but as fine tubes of variable section\r\n    carrying an incompressible fluid, then, since the velocity of\r\n    the fluid is inversely as the section of the tube, we may make\r\n    the velocity vary according to any given law, by regulating the\r\n    section of the tube, and in this way we might represent the\r\n    intensity of the force as well as its direction by the motion\r\n    of the fluid in these tubes. This method of representing the\r\n    intensity of a force by the velocity of an imaginary fluid in\r\n    a tube is applicable to any conceivable system of forces, but\r\n    it is capable of great simplification in the case in which\r\n    the forces are such as can be explained by the hypothesis of\r\n    attractions varying inversely as the square of the distance,\r\n    such as those observed in electrical and magnetic phenomena.\r\n    In the case of a perfectly arbitrary system of forces, there\r\n    will generally be interstices between the tubes; but in the\r\n    case of electric and magnetic forces it is possible to arrange\r\n    the tubes so as to leave no interstices. The tubes will then be\r\n    mere surfaces, directing the motion of a fluid filling up the\r\n    whole space. It has been usual to commence the investigation of\r\n    the laws of these forces by at once assuming that the phenomena\r\n    are due to attractive or repulsive forces acting between\r\n    certain points. We may, however, obtain a different view of the\r\n    subject, and one more suited to our more difficult inquiries,\r\n    by adopting for the definition of the forces of which we treat,\r\n    that they may be represented in magnitude and direction by the\r\n    uniform motion of an incompressible fluid.\r\n\r\n    “I propose, then, first to describe a method by which the\r\n    motion of such a fluid can be clearly conceived; secondly\r\n    to trace the consequences of assuming certain conditions of\r\n    motion, and to point out the application of the method to some\r\n    of the less complicated phenomena of electricity, magnetism,\r\n    and galvanism; and lastly, to show how by an extension of these\r\n    methods, and the introduction of another idea due to Faraday,\r\n    the laws of the attractions and inductive actions of magnets\r\n    and currents may be clearly conceived, without making any\r\n    assumptions as to the physical nature of electricity, or adding\r\n    anything to that which has been already proved by experiment.\r\n\r\n    “By referring everything to the purely geometrical idea of the\r\n    motion of an imaginary fluid, I hope to attain generality and\r\n    precision, and to avoid the dangers arising from a premature\r\n    theory professing to explain the cause of the phenomena.\r\n    If the results of mere speculation which I have collected\r\n    are found to be of any use to experimental philosophers, in\r\n    arranging and interpreting their results, they will have served\r\n    their purpose, and a mature theory, in which physical facts\r\n    will be physically explained, will be formed by those who by\r\n    interrogating Nature herself can obtain the only true solution\r\n    of the questions which the mathematical theory suggests.”\r\n\r\nThe idea was a bold one: for a youth of twenty-three to explain, by\r\nmeans of the motions of an incompressible fluid, some of the less\r\ncomplicated phenomena of electricity and magnetism, to show how\r\nthe laws of the attractions of magnets and currents may be clearly\r\nconceived without making any assumption as to the physical nature of\r\nelectricity, or adding anything to that which has already been proved\r\nby experiment.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to review in a very few words the position of\r\nelectrical theory[57] in 1855.\r\n\r\nCoulomb’s experiments had established the fundamental facts of\r\nelectrostatic attraction and repulsion, and Coulomb himself, about\r\n1785, had stated a theory based on these experiments which could “only\r\nbe attacked by proving his experimental results to be inaccurate.”[58]\r\n\r\nCoulomb supposes the existence of two electric fluids, the theory\r\ndeveloped previously by Franklin, but says--\r\n\r\n    “Je préviens pour mettre la théorie qui va suivre à l’abri de\r\n    toute dispute systématique, que dans la supposition de deux\r\n    fluides électriques, je n’ai autre intention que de présenter\r\n    avec le moins d’éléments possible les résultats du calcul et\r\n    de l’expérience, et non d’indiquer les véritables causes de\r\n    l’électricité.”\r\n\r\nCavendish was working in England about the same time as Coulomb, but\r\nhe published very little, and the value and importance of his work\r\nwas not recognised until the appearance in 1879 of the “Electrical\r\nResearches of Henry Cavendish,” edited by Clerk Maxwell.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present century the application of mathematical analysis\r\nto electrical problems was begun by Laplace, who investigated the\r\ndistribution of electricity on spheroids, and about 1811 Poisson’s\r\ngreat work on the distribution of electricity on two spheres placed\r\nat any given distance apart was published. Meanwhile the properties\r\nof the electric current were being investigated. Galvani’s discovery\r\nof the muscular contraction in a frog’s leg, caused by the contact of\r\ndissimilar metals, was made in 1790. Volta invented the voltaic pile in\r\n1800, and Oersted in 1820 discovered that an electric current produced\r\nmagnetic force in its neighbourhood. On this Ampère laid the foundation\r\nof his theory of electro-dynamics, in which he showed how to calculate\r\nthe forces between circuits carrying currents from an assumed law of\r\nforce between each pair of elements of the circuits. His experiments\r\nproved that the consequences which follow from this law are consistent\r\nwith all the observed facts. They do not prove that Ampère’s law alone\r\ncan explain the facts.\r\n\r\nMaxwell, writing on this subject in the “Electricity an Magnetism,”\r\nvol. ii., p. 162, says--\r\n\r\n    “The experimental investigation by which Ampère established the\r\n    laws of the mechanical action between electric currents is one\r\n    of the most brilliant achievements in science.\r\n\r\n    “The whole, theory and experiment, seems as if it had leaped\r\n    full grown and full armed from the brain of the ‘Newton\r\n    of Electricity.’ It is perfect in form and unassailable in\r\n    accuracy, and it is summed up in a formula from which all the\r\n    phenomena may be deduced, and which must always remain the\r\n    cardinal formula of electro-dynamics.\r\n\r\n    “The method of Ampère, however, though cast into an inductive\r\n    form, does not allow us to trace the formation of the ideas\r\n    which guided it. We can scarcely believe that Ampère really\r\n    discovered the law of action by means of the experiments which\r\n    he describes. We are led to suspect, what, indeed, he tells us\r\n    himself, that he discovered the law by some process which he\r\n    has not shown us, and that when he had afterwards built up a\r\n    perfect demonstration, he removed all traces of the scaffolding\r\n    by which he had built it.”\r\n\r\nThe experimental evidence for Ampère’s theory, so far, at least, as\r\nit was possible to obtain it from experiments on closed circuits, was\r\nrendered unimpeachable by W. Weber about 1846, while in the previous\r\nyear Grassman and F. E. Neumann both published laws for the attraction\r\nbetween two elements of current which differ from that of Ampère, but\r\nlead to the same result for closed circuits. In a paper published in\r\n1846 Weber announced his hypothesis connecting together electrostatic\r\nand electro-dynamic action. In this paper he supposed that the force\r\nbetween two particles of electricity depends on the motion of the\r\nparticles as well as on their distance apart. A somewhat similar\r\ntheory was proposed by Gauss and published after his death in his\r\ncollected works. It has been shown, however, that Gauss’ theory is\r\ninconsistent with the conservation of energy. Weber’s theory avoids\r\nthis inconsistency and leads, for closed circuits, to the same results\r\nas Ampère. It has been proved, however, by Von Helmholtz, that, under\r\ncertain circumstances, according to it, a body would behave as though\r\nits mass were negative--it would move in a direction opposite to that\r\nof the force.[59]\r\n\r\nSince 1846 many other theories have been proposed to explain Ampère’s\r\nlaws. Meanwhile, in 1821, Faraday observed that under certain\r\ncircumstances a wire carrying a current could be kept in continuous\r\nrotation in a magnetic field by the action between the magnets and\r\nthe current. In 1824 Arago observed the motion of a magnet caused by\r\nrotating a copper disc in its neighbourhood, while in 1831 Faraday\r\nbegan his experimental researches into electro-magnetic induction.\r\nAbout the same period Joseph Henry, of Washington, was making,\r\nindependently of Faraday, experiments of fundamental importance on\r\nelectro-magnetic induction, but sufficient attention was not called to\r\nhis work until comparatively recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Lenz made some important researches, which led him to discover\r\nthe connection between the direction of the induced currents and\r\nAmpère’s laws, summed up in his rule that the direction of the induced\r\ncurrent is always such as to oppose by its electro-magnetic action the\r\nmotion which induces it.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 F. E. Neumann developed from this law the mathematical theory\r\nof electro-magnetic induction, and about the same time W. Weber showed\r\nhow it might be deduced from his elementary law of electrical action.\r\n\r\nThe great name of Von Helmholtz first appears in connection with this\r\nsubject in 1851, but of his writings we shall have more to say at a\r\nlater stage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, during the same period, various writers, Murphy, Plana,\r\nCharles, Sturm, and Gauss, extended Poisson’s work on electrostatics,\r\ntreating the questions which arose as problems in the distribution of\r\nan attracting fluid, attracting or repelling according to Newton’s law,\r\nthough here again the greatest advances were made by a self-taught\r\nNottingham shoemaker, George Green by name, in his paper “On the\r\nApplication of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and\r\nMagnetism,” 1828.\r\n\r\nGreen’s researches, Lord Kelvin writes, “have led to the elementary\r\nproposition which must constitute the legitimate foundation of every\r\nperfect mathematical structure that is to be made from the materials\r\nfurnished by the experimental laws of Coulomb.”\r\n\r\nGreen, it may be remarked, was the inventor of the term Potential.\r\nHis essay, however, lay neglected from 1828, until Lord Kelvin called\r\nattention to it in 1845. Meanwhile, some of its most important results\r\nhad been re-discovered by Gauss and Charles and Thomson himself.\r\n\r\nUntil about 1845, the experimental work on which these mathematical\r\nresearches in electrostatics were based was that of Coulomb. An\r\nelectrified body is supposed to have a charge of some imponderable\r\nfluid “electricity.” Particles of electricity repel each other\r\naccording to a certain law, and the fluid distributes itself in\r\nequilibrium over the surface of any charged conductor in accordance\r\nwith this law. There are on this theory two opposite kinds of electric\r\nfluid, positive and negative, two charges of the same kind repel, two\r\ncharges of opposite kinds attract; the repulsion or attraction is\r\nproportional to the product of the charges, and inversely proportional\r\nto the square of the distance between them.\r\n\r\nThe action between two charges is action at a distance taking place\r\nacross the space which separates the two.\r\n\r\nFaraday, in 1837, in the eleventh series of his “Experimental\r\nResearches,” published his first paper on “Electrostatic Induction.”\r\nHe showed--as indeed Cavendish had proved long previously, though the\r\nresult remained unpublished--that the force between two charged bodies\r\nwill depend on the insulating medium which surrounds them, not merely\r\non their shape and position. Induction, as he expresses it, takes place\r\nalong curved lines, and is an action of contiguous particles; these\r\ncurved lines he calls the “lines of force.”\r\n\r\nDiscussing these researches in 1845, Lord Kelvin writes[60]:--\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Faraday’s researches ... were undertaken with a view to\r\n    test an idea which he had long possessed that the forces of\r\n    attraction and repulsion exercised by free electricity are not\r\n    the resultants of actions exercised at a distance, but are\r\n    propagated by means of molecular action among the contiguous\r\n    particles of the insulating medium surrounding the electrified\r\n    bodies, which he therefore calls the dielectric. By this idea\r\n    he has been led to some very remarkable views upon induction,\r\n    or, in fact, upon electrical action in general. As it is\r\n    impossible that the phenomena observed by Faraday can be\r\n    incompatible with the results of experiment which constitute\r\n    Coulomb’s theory, it is to be expected that the difference\r\n    of his ideas from those of Coulomb must arise solely from a\r\n    different method of stating and interpreting physically the\r\n    same laws; and further, it may, I think, be shown that either\r\n    method of viewing this subject, when carried sufficiently\r\n    far, may be made the foundation of a mathematical theory\r\n    which would lead to the elementary principles of the other as\r\n    consequences. This theory would, accordingly, be the expression\r\n    of the ultimate law of the phenomena, independently of any\r\n    physical hypothesis we might from other circumstances be led\r\n    to adopt. That there are necessarily two distinct elementary\r\n    ways of viewing the theory of electricity may be seen from the\r\n    following considerations....”\r\n\r\nIn the pages which follow, Lord Kelvin develops the consequences of an\r\nanalogy between the conduction of heat and electrostatic action, which\r\nhe had pointed out three years earlier (1842), in his paper on “The\r\nUniform Motion of Heat in Homogeneous Solid Bodies,” and discusses its\r\nconnection with the mathematical theory of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe problem of distributing sources of heat in a given homogeneous\r\nconductor of heat, so as to produce a definite steady temperature at\r\neach point on the conductor is shewn to be _mathematically_ identical\r\nwith that of distributing electricity in equilibrium, so as to produce\r\nat each point an electrical potential having the same value as the\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThus the fundamental laws of the conduction of heat may be made the\r\nbasis of the mathematical theory of electricity, but the physical\r\nidea which they suggest is that of the propagation of some effect by\r\nmeans of the mutual action of contiguous particles, rather than that\r\nof material particles attracting or repelling at a distance, which\r\nnaturally follows from the statement of Coulomb’s law.\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin continues:--\r\n\r\n    “All the views which Faraday has brought forward and\r\n    illustrated, as demonstrated by experiment, lead to this method\r\n    of establishing the mathematical theory, and, as far as the\r\n    analysis is concerned, it would in most _general_ propositions\r\n    be more simple, if possible, than that of Coulomb. Of course\r\n    the analysis of _particular_ problems would be identical in the\r\n    two methods. It is thus that Faraday arrives at a knowledge of\r\n    some of the most important of the mathematical theorems which\r\n    from their nature seemed destined never to be perceived except\r\n    as mathematical truths.”\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin’s papers on “The Mathematical Theory of Electricity,”\r\npublished from 1848 to 1850, his “Propositions on the Theory of\r\nAttraction” (1842), his “Theory of Electrical Images” (1847), and his\r\npaper on “The Mathematical Theory of Magnetism” (1849), contain a\r\nstatement of the most important results achieved in the mathematical\r\nsciences of Electrostatics and Magnetism up to the time of Maxwell’s\r\nfirst paper.\r\n\r\nThe opening sentences of that paper have already been quoted. In the\r\npreface to the “Electricity and Magnetism” Maxwell writes thus:--\r\n\r\n    “Before I began the study of electricity I resolved to read\r\n    no mathematics on the subject till I had first read through\r\n    ‘Experimental Researches on Electricity.’ I was aware that\r\n    there was supposed to be a difference between Faraday’s way of\r\n    conceiving phenomena and that of the mathematicians, so that\r\n    neither he nor they were satisfied with each other’s language.\r\n    I had also the conviction that this discrepancy did not arise\r\n    from either party being wrong. I was first convinced of this by\r\n    Sir William Thomson, to whose advice and assistance, as well as\r\n    to his published papers, I owe most of what I have learned on\r\n    the subject.\r\n\r\n    “As I proceeded with the study of Faraday, I perceived that his\r\n    method of conceiving the phenomena was also a mathematical\r\n    one, though not exhibited in the conventional form of\r\n    mathematical symbols. I also found that these methods were\r\n    capable of being expressed in the ordinary mathematical forms,\r\n    and thus compared with those of the professed mathematicians.\r\n\r\n    “For instance, Faraday, in his mind’s eye, saw lines of force\r\n    traversing all space where the mathematicians saw centres of\r\n    force attracting at a distance. Faraday saw a medium where\r\n    they saw nothing but distance. Faraday sought the seat of the\r\n    phenomena in real actions going on in the medium. They were\r\n    satisfied that they had found it in a power of action at a\r\n    distance impressed on the electric fluids.”\r\n\r\nNow, Maxwell saw an analogy between electrostatics and the steady\r\nmotion of an incompressible fluid like water, and it is this analogy\r\nwhich he develops in the first part of his paper. The water flows along\r\ndefinite lines; a surface which consists wholly of such lines of flow\r\nwill have the property that no water ever crosses it. In any stream\r\nof water we can imagine a number of such surfaces drawn, dividing it\r\nup into a series of tubes; each of these will be a tube of flow, each\r\nof these tubes remain always filled with water. Hence, the quantity\r\nof water which crosses per second any section of a tube of flow\r\nperpendicular to its length is always the same. Thus, from the form of\r\nthe tube, we can obtain information as to the direction and strength of\r\nthe flow, for where the tube is wide the flow will be proportionately\r\nsmall, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nAgain, we can draw in the fluid a number of surfaces, over each of\r\nwhich the pressure is the same; these surfaces will cut the tubes\r\nof flow at right angles. Let us suppose they are drawn so that the\r\ndifference of pressure between any two consecutive surfaces is unity,\r\nthen the surfaces will be close together at points at which the\r\npressure changes rapidly; where the variation of pressure is slow, the\r\ndistance between two consecutive surfaces will be considerable.\r\n\r\nIf, then, in any case of motion, we can draw the pressure surfaces,\r\nand the tubes of flow, we can determine the motion of the fluid\r\ncompletely. Now, the same mathematical expressions which appear in\r\nthe hydro-dynamical theory occur also in the theory of electricity,\r\nthe meaning only of the symbols is changed. For velocity of fluid we\r\nhave to write electrical force. For difference of fluid pressure we\r\nsubstitute work done, or difference of electrical potential or pressure.\r\n\r\nThe surfaces and tubes, drawn as the solution of any hydro-dynamical\r\nproblem, give us also the solution of an electrical problem; the\r\ntubes of flow are Faraday’s tubes of force, or tubes of induction,\r\nthe surfaces of constant pressure are surfaces of equal electrical\r\npotential. Induction may take place in curved lines just as the tubes\r\nof flow may be bent and curved; the analogy between the two is a\r\ncomplete one.\r\n\r\nBut, as Maxwell shows, the analogy reaches further still. An electric\r\ncurrent flowing along a wire had been recognised as having many\r\nproperties similar to those of a current of liquid in a tube. When a\r\nsteady current is passing through any solid conductor, there are formed\r\nin the conductor tubes of electrical flow and surfaces of constant\r\npressure. These tubes and surfaces are the same as those formed by the\r\nflow of liquid through a solid whose boundary surface is the same\r\nas that of the conductor, provided the flow of liquid is properly\r\nproportioned to the flow of electricity.\r\n\r\nThese analogies refer to steady currents in which, therefore, the flow\r\nat any point of the conductor does not depend on the time. In Part\r\nII. of his paper Maxwell deals with Faraday’s electro-tonic state.\r\nFaraday had found that when _changes_ are produced in the magnetic\r\nphenomena surrounding a conductor, an electric current is set up in\r\nthe conductor, which continues so long as the magnetic changes are in\r\nprogress, but which ceases when the magnetic state becomes steady.\r\n\r\n    “Considerations of this kind led Professor Faraday to connect\r\n    with his discovery of the induction of electric currents the\r\n    conception of a state into which all bodies are thrown by the\r\n    presence of magnets and currents. This state does not manifest\r\n    itself by any known phenomena as long as it is undisturbed,\r\n    but any change in this state is indicated by a current or\r\n    tendency towards a current. To this state he gave the name of\r\n    the ‘Electro-tonic State,’ and although he afterwards succeeded\r\n    in explaining the phenomena which suggested it by means of less\r\n    hypothetical conceptions, he has on several occasions hinted at\r\n    the probability that some phenomena might be discovered which\r\n    would render the electro-tonic state an object of legitimate\r\n    induction. These speculations, into which Faraday had been\r\n    led by the study of laws which he has well established, and\r\n    which he abandoned only for want of experimental data for the\r\n    direct proof of the unknown state, have not, I think, been\r\n    made the subject of mathematical investigation. Perhaps it\r\n    may be thought that the quantitative determinations of the\r\n    various phenomena are not sufficiently rigorous to be made\r\n    the basis of a mathematical theory. Faraday, however, has not\r\n    contented himself with simply stating the numerical results\r\n    of his experiments and leaving the law to be discovered by\r\n    calculation. Where he has perceived a law he has at once stated\r\n    it, in terms as unambiguous as those of pure mathematics,\r\n    and if the mathematician, receiving this as a physical\r\n    truth, deduces from it other laws capable of being tested by\r\n    experiment, he has merely assisted the physicist in arranging\r\n    his own ideas, which is confessedly a necessary step in\r\n    scientific induction.\r\n\r\n    “In the following investigation, therefore, the laws\r\n    established by Faraday will be assumed as true, and it will\r\n    be shown that by following out his speculations other and\r\n    more general laws can be deduced from them. If it should,\r\n    then, appear that these laws, originally devised to include\r\n    one set of phenomena, may be generalised so as to extend to\r\n    phenomena of a different class, these mathematical connections\r\n    may suggest to physicists the means of establishing physical\r\n    connections, and thus mere speculation may be turned to account\r\n    in experimental science.”\r\n\r\nMaxwell shows how to obtain a mathematical expression for Faraday’s\r\nelectro-tonic state. In his “Electricity and Magnetism,” this\r\nelectro-tonic state receives a new name. It is known as the Vector\r\nPotential,[61] and the paper under consideration contains, though\r\nin an incomplete form, his first statement of those equations of the\r\nelectric field which are so indissolubly bound up with Maxwell’s name.\r\n\r\nThe great advance in theory made in the paper is the distinct\r\nrecognition of certain mathematical functions as representing Faraday’s\r\nelectrotonic-state, and their use in solving electro-magnetic problems.\r\n\r\nThe paper contains no new physical theory of electricity, but in a\r\nfew years one appeared. In his later writings Maxwell adopted a more\r\ngeneral view of the electro-magnetic field than that contained in his\r\nearly papers on “Physical Lines of Force.” It must, therefore, not be\r\nsupposed that the somewhat gross conception of cog-wheels and pulleys,\r\nwhich we are about to describe, were anything more to their author than\r\na model, which enabled him to realise how the changes, which occur when\r\na current of electricity passes through a wire, might be represented by\r\nthe motion of actual material particles.\r\n\r\nThe problem before him was to devise a physical theory of electricity,\r\nwhich would explain the forces exerted on electrified bodies by means\r\nof action between the contiguous parts of the medium in the space\r\nsurrounding these bodies, rather than by direct action across the\r\ndistance which separates them. A similar question, still unanswered,\r\nhad arisen in the case of gravitation. Astronomers have determined the\r\nforces between attracting bodies; they do not know how those forces\r\narise.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s fondness for models has already been alluded to; it had led\r\nhim to construct his top to illustrate the dynamics of a rigid body\r\nrotating about a fixed point, and his model of Saturn’s rings (now in\r\nthe Cavendish Laboratory) to illustrate the motion of the satellites\r\nin the rings. He had explained many of the gaseous laws by means of\r\nthe impact of molecules, and now his fertile ingenuity was to imagine\r\na mechanical model of the state of the electro-magnetic field near a\r\nsystem of conductors carrying currents.\r\n\r\nFaraday, as we have seen, looked upon electrostatic and magnetic\r\ninduction as taking place along curved lines of force. He pictures\r\nthese lines as ropes of molecules starting from a charged conductor, or\r\na magnet, as the case may be, and acting on other bodies near. These\r\nropes of molecules tend to shorten, and at the same time to swell\r\noutwards laterally. Thus the charged conductor tends to draw other\r\nbodies to itself, there is a tension along the lines of force, while\r\nat the same time each tube of molecules pushes its neighbours aside; a\r\npressure at right angles to the lines of force is combined with this\r\ntension. Assuming for a moment this pressure and tension to exist, can\r\nwe devise a mechanism to account for it? Maxwell himself has likened\r\nthe lines of force to the fibres of a muscle. As the fibres contract,\r\ncausing the limb to which they are attached to move, they swell\r\noutwards, and the muscle thickens.\r\n\r\nAgain, from another point of view, we might consider a line of force\r\nas consisting of a string of small cells of some flexible material\r\neach filled with fluid. If we then suppose this series of cells caused\r\nto rotate rapidly about the direction of the line of force, the cells\r\nwill expand laterally and contract longitudinally; there will again be\r\ntension along the lines of force and pressure at right angles to them.\r\nIt was this last idea, as we shall see shortly, of which Maxwell made\r\nuse--\r\n\r\n    “I propose now” [he writes (“On Physical Lines of Force,”\r\n    _Phil. Mag._, vol. xxi.)] “to examine magnetic phenomena from\r\n    a mechanical point of view, and to determine what tensions in,\r\n    or motions of, a medium are capable of producing the mechanical\r\n    phenomena observed. If by the same hypothesis we can connect\r\n    the phenomena of magnetic attraction with electro-magnetic\r\n    phenomena, and with those of induced currents, we shall have\r\n    found a theory which, if not true, can only be proved to be\r\n    erroneous by experiments, which will greatly enlarge our\r\n    knowledge of this part of physics.”\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin had in 1847 given a mechanical representation of electric,\r\nmagnetic and galvanic forces by means of the displacements of an\r\nelastic solid in a state of strain. The angular displacement at each\r\npoint of the solid was taken as proportional to the magnetic force, and\r\nfrom this the relation between the various other electric quantities\r\nand the motion of the solid was developed. But Lord Kelvin did not\r\nattempt to explain the origin of the observed forces by the effects due\r\nto these strains, but merely made use of the mathematical analogy to\r\nassist the imagination in the study of both.\r\n\r\nMaxwell considered magnetic action as existing in the form of pressure\r\nor tension, or more generally, of some stress in some medium. The\r\nexistence of a medium capable of exerting force on material bodies and\r\nof withstanding considerable stress, both pressure and tension, is\r\nthus a fundamental hypothesis with him; this medium is to be capable\r\nof motion, and electro-magnetic forces arise from its motion and its\r\nstresses.\r\n\r\nNow, Maxwell’s fundamental supposition is that, in a magnetic field,\r\nthere is a rotation of the molecules continually in progress about the\r\nlines of magnetic force. Consider now the case of a uniform magnetic\r\nfield, whose direction is perpendicular to the paper; we are to look\r\nupon the lines of force as parallel strings of molecules, the axes of\r\nthese strings being perpendicular to the paper. Each string is supposed\r\nto be rotating in the same direction about its axis, and the angular\r\nvelocity of rotation is a measure of the magnetic force. In consequence\r\nof this rotation there will be differences of pressure in different\r\ndirections in the medium; the pressure along the axes of the strings\r\nwill be less than it would be if the medium were at rest, that in the\r\ndirections at right angles to the axes will be greater, the medium will\r\nbehave as though it were under tension along the axes of the molecules\r\nunder pressure at right angles to them. Moreover, it can be shown that\r\nthe pressure and the tension are both proportional to the square of the\r\nangular velocity--the square, that is, of the magnetic force--and this\r\nresult is in accordance with the consequences of experiment.\r\n\r\nMore elaborate calculation shows that this statement is true generally.\r\nIf we draw the lines of force in any magnetic field, and then suppose\r\nthe molecules of the medium set in rotation about these lines of force\r\nas axes, with velocities which at each point are proportional to the\r\nmagnetic force, the distribution of pressure throughout is that which\r\nwe know actually to exist in the magnetic field.\r\n\r\nAccording to this hypothesis, then, a permanent bar magnet has the\r\npower of setting the medium round it into continuous molecular rotation\r\nabout the lines of force as axes. The molecules which are set in\r\nrotation we may consider as spherical, or nearly spherical, cells\r\nfilled with a fluid, or an elastic solid substance, and surrounded by a\r\nkind of membrane, or sack, holding the contents together.\r\n\r\nSo far the model does not give any account of electrical actions which\r\ngo on in the magnetic field.\r\n\r\nThe energy is wholly rotational, and the forces wholly magnetic.\r\n\r\nConsider, however, any two contiguous strings of molecules. Let them\r\ncut the paper as shown in the two circles in Fig. 1:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThen these cells are both rotating in the same direction, hence at C,\r\nwhere they touch, their points of contact will be moving in opposite\r\ndirections, as shown by the arrow heads, and it is difficult to imagine\r\nhow such motion can continue; it would require the surfaces of the\r\ncells to be perfectly smooth, and if this were so they would lose the\r\npower of transmitting action from one cell to the next.\r\n\r\nThe cells A and B may be compared to two cog-wheels placed close\r\ntogether, which we wish to turn in the same direction. If the cogs can\r\ninterlock, as in Fig. 2, this is impossible: consecutive wheels in the\r\ntrain must move in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nBut in many machines the desired end is attained by inserting between\r\nthe two wheels A and B a third idle wheel C, as shewn in Fig. 3. This\r\nmay be very small, its only function is to transmit the motion of A to\r\nB in such a way that A and B may both turn in the same direction. It is\r\nnot necessary that there should be cogs on the wheels; if the surfaces\r\nbe perfectly rough, so that no slipping can take place, the same result\r\nfollows without the cogs.\r\n\r\nGuided by this analogy Maxwell extended his model by supposing each\r\ncell coated with a number of small particles which roll on its surface.\r\nThese particles play the part of the idle wheels in the machine, and by\r\ntheir rolling merely enable the adjacent parts of two cells to move in\r\nopposite directions.\r\n\r\nConsider now a number of such cells and their idle wheels lying in a\r\nplane, that of the paper, and suppose each cell is rotating with the\r\nsame uniform angular velocity about an axis at right angles to that\r\nplane, each idle wheel will be acted on by two equal and opposite\r\nforces at the ends of the diameter in which it is touched by the\r\nadjacent cells; it will therefore be set in rotation, but there will be\r\nno force tending to drive it onwards; it does not matter whether the\r\naxis on which it rotates is free to move or fixed, in either case the\r\nidle wheel simply rotates. But suppose now the adjacent cells are not\r\nrotating at the same rate. In addition to its rotation the idle wheel\r\nwill be urged onward with a velocity which depends on the difference\r\nbetween the rotations, and, if it can move freely, it will move on from\r\nbetween the two cells. Imagine now that the interstices between the\r\ncells are fitted with a string of idle wheels. So long as the adjacent\r\ncells move with different velocity there will be a continual stream of\r\nrolling particles or idle wheels between them. Maxwell in the paper\r\nconsidered these rolling particles to be particles of electricity.\r\nTheir motion constitutes an electric current. In a uniform magnetic\r\nfield there is no electric current; if the strength of the field\r\nvaries, the idle wheels are set in motion and there may be a current.\r\n\r\nThese particles are very small compared with the magnetic vortices.\r\nThe mass of all the particles is inappreciable compared with the mass\r\nof the vortices, and a great many vortices with their surrounding\r\nparticles are contained in a molecule of the medium; the particles\r\nroll on the vortices without touching each other, so that so long as\r\nthey remain within the same molecule there is no loss of energy by\r\nresistance. When, however, there is a current or general transference\r\nof particles in one direction they must pass from one molecule to\r\nanother, and in doing so may experience resistance and generate heat.\r\n\r\nMaxwell states that the conception of a particle, having its motion\r\nconnected with that of a vortex by perfect rolling contact, may appear\r\nsomewhat awkward. “I do not bring it forward,” he writes, “as a mode of\r\nconnection existing in Nature, or even as that which I would willingly\r\nassent to as an electrical hypothesis. It is, however, a mode of\r\nconnection which is mechanically conceivable and easily investigated,\r\nand it serves to bring out the actual mechanical connections between\r\nthe known electro-magnetic phenomena, so that I venture to say that\r\nanyone who understands the provisional and temporary character of this\r\nhypothesis will find himself rather helped than hindered by it in his\r\nsearch after the true interpretation of the phenomena.”\r\n\r\nThe first part of the paper deals with the theory of magnetism; in the\r\nsecond part the hypothesis is applied to the phenomena of electric\r\ncurrents, and it is shown how the known laws of steady currents and\r\nof electro-magnetic induction can be deduced from it. In Part III.,\r\npublished January and February, 1862, the theory of molecular vortices\r\nis applied to statical electricity.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between a conductor and an insulator or dielectric\r\nis supposed to be that in the former the particles of electricity\r\ncan pass with more or less freedom from molecule to molecule. In the\r\nlatter such transference is impossible, the particles can only be\r\ndisplaced within the molecule with which they are connected; the cells\r\nor vortices of the medium are supposed to be elastic, and to resist by\r\ntheir elasticity the displacement of the particles within them. When\r\nelectrical force acts on the medium this displacement of the particles\r\nwithin each molecule takes place until the stresses due to the elastic\r\nreaction of the vortices balance the electrical force; the medium\r\nbehaves like an elastic body yielding to pressure until the pressure is\r\nbalanced by the elastic stress. When the electric force is removed the\r\ncells or vortices recover their form, the electricity returns to its\r\nformer position.\r\n\r\nIn a medium such as this waves of periodic displacement could be\r\nset up, and would travel with a velocity depending on its electric\r\nproperties. The value for this velocity can be obtained from electrical\r\nobservations, and Maxwell showed that this velocity, so found, was,\r\nwithin the limits of experimental error, the same as that of light.\r\nMoreover, the electrical oscillations take place, like those of light,\r\nin the front of the wave. Hence, he concludes, “the elasticity of the\r\nmagnetic medium in air is the same as that of the luminiferous medium,\r\nif these two coexistent, coextensive, and equally elastic media are not\r\nrather one medium.”\r\n\r\nThe paper thus contains the first germs of the electro-magnetic theory\r\nof light. Moreover, it is shown that the attraction between two small\r\nbodies charged with given quantities of electricity depends on the\r\nmedium in which they are placed, while the specific inductive capacity\r\nis found to be proportional to the square of the refractive index.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and final part of the paper investigates the propagation of\r\nlight in a magnetic field.\r\n\r\nFaraday had shown that the direction of vibration in a wave of\r\npolarised light travelling parallel to the lines of force in a magnetic\r\nfield is rotated by its passage through the field. The numerical laws\r\nof this relation had been investigated by Verdet, and Maxwell showed\r\nhow his hypothesis of molecular vortices led to laws which agree in the\r\nmain with those found by Verdet.\r\n\r\nHe points out that the connection between magnetism and electricity\r\nhas the same mathematical form as that between certain other pairs\r\nof phenomena, one of which has a _linear_ and the other a _rotatory_\r\ncharacter; and, further, that an analogy may be worked out assuming\r\neither the linear character for magnetism and the rotatory character\r\nfor electricity, or the reverse. He alludes to Prof. Challis’ theory,\r\naccording to which magnetism is to consist in currents in a fluid\r\nwhose directions correspond with the lines of magnetic force, while\r\nelectric currents are supposed to be accompanied by, if not dependent\r\nupon, a rotatory motion of the fluid about the axis of the current;\r\nand to Von Helmholtz’s theory of a somewhat similar character. He then\r\ngives his own reasons--agreeing with those of Sir W. Thomson (Lord\r\nKelvin)--for supposing that there must be a real rotation going on in\r\na magnetic field in order to account for the rotation of the plane of\r\npolarisation, and, accepting these reasons as valid, he develops the\r\nconsequences of his theory with the results stated above.\r\n\r\nHis own verdict on the theory is given in the “Electricity and\r\nMagnetism” (vol. ii., § 831, first edition, p. 416):--\r\n\r\n    “A theory of molecular vortices, which I worked out at\r\n    considerable length, was published in the _Phil. Mag._ for\r\n    March, April, and May, 1861; Jan. and Feb., 1862.\r\n\r\n    “I think we have good evidence for the opinion that some\r\n    phenomenon of rotation is going on in the magnetic field, that\r\n    this rotation is performed by a great number of very small\r\n    portions of matter, each rotating on its own axis, this axis\r\n    being parallel to the direction of the magnetic force, and that\r\n    the rotations of these different vortices are made to depend on\r\n    one another by means of some kind of mechanism connecting them.\r\n\r\n    “The attempt which I then made to imagine a working model of\r\n    this mechanism must be taken for no more than it really is,\r\n    a demonstration that mechanism may be imagined capable of\r\n    producing a connection mechanically equivalent to the actual\r\n    connection of the parts of the electro-magnetic field. The\r\n    problem of determining the mechanism required to establish a\r\n    given species of connection between the motions of the parts of\r\n    a system always admits of an infinite number of solutions. Of\r\n    these, some may be more clumsy or more complex than others, but\r\n    all must satisfy the conditions of mechanism in general.\r\n\r\n    “The following results of the theory, however, are of higher\r\n    value:--\r\n\r\n    “(1) Magnetic force is the effect of the centrifugal force of\r\n    the vortices.\r\n\r\n    “(2) Electro-magnetic induction of currents is the effect of\r\n    the forces called into play when the velocity of the vortices\r\n    is changing.\r\n\r\n    “(3) Electromotive force arises from the stress on the\r\n    connecting mechanism.\r\n\r\n    “(4) Electric displacement arises from the elastic yielding of\r\n    the connecting mechanism.”\r\n\r\nIn studying this part of Maxwell’s work, it must clearly be remembered\r\nthat he did not look upon the ether as a series of cog-wheels with\r\nidle wheels between, or anything of the kind. He devised a mechanical\r\nmodel of such cogs and idle wheels, the properties of which would in\r\nsome respects closely resemble those of the ether; from this model he\r\ndeduced, among other things, the important fact that electric waves\r\nwould travel outwards with the velocity of light. Other such models\r\nhave been devised since his time to illustrate the same laws. Prof.\r\nFitzgerald has actually constructed one of wheels connected together by\r\nelastic bands, which shows clearly the kind of processes which Maxwell\r\nsupposed to go on in a dielectric when under electric force. Professor\r\nLodge, in his book, “Modern Views of Electricity,” has very fully\r\ndeveloped a somewhat different arrangement of cog-wheels to attain the\r\nsame result.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s predictions as to the propagation of electric waves have\r\nin recent days received their full verification in the brilliant\r\nexperiments of Hertz and his followers; it remains for us, before\r\ndealing with these, to trace their final development in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe papers we have been discussing were perhaps too material to receive\r\nthe full attention they deserved; the ether is not a series of cogs,\r\nand electricity is something different from material idle wheels. In\r\nhis paper on “The Dynamical Theory of the Electro-magnetic Field,”\r\n_Phil. Trans._, 1864, Maxwell treats the same questions in a more\r\ngeneral manner. On a former occasion he says, “I have attempted to\r\ndescribe a particular kind of motion and a particular kind of strain\r\nso arranged as to account for the phenomena. In the present paper I\r\navoid any hypothesis of this kind; and in using such words as electric\r\nmomentum and electric elasticity in reference to the known phenomena of\r\nthe induction of currents and the polarisation of dielectrics, I wish\r\nmerely to direct the mind of the reader to mechanical phenomena, which\r\nwill assist him in understanding the electrical ones. All such phrases\r\nin the present paper are to be considered as illustrative and not as\r\nexplanatory.” He then continues:--\r\n\r\n    “In speaking of the energy of the field, however, I wish to\r\n    be understood literally. All energy is the same as mechanical\r\n    energy, whether it exists in the form of motion or in that of\r\n    elasticity, or in any other form.\r\n\r\n    “The energy in electro-magnetic phenomena is mechanical energy.\r\n    The only question is, Where does it reside?\r\n\r\n    “On the old theories it resides in the electrified bodies,\r\n    conducting circuits, and magnets, in the form of an unknown\r\n    quality called potential energy, or the power of producing\r\n    certain effects at a distance. On our theory it resides in\r\n    the electro-magnetic field, in the space surrounding the\r\n    electrified and magnetic bodies, as well as in those bodies\r\n    themselves, and is in two different forms, which may be\r\n    described without hypothesis as magnetic polarisation and\r\n    electric polarisation, or, according to a very probable\r\n    hypothesis, as the motion and the strain of one and the same\r\n    medium.\r\n\r\n    “The conclusions arrived at in the present paper are\r\n    independent of this hypothesis, being deduced from experimental\r\n    facts of three kinds:--\r\n\r\n    “(1) The induction of electric currents by the increase or\r\n    diminution of neighbouring currents according to the changes in\r\n    the lines of force passing through the circuit.\r\n\r\n    “(2) The distribution of magnetic intensity according to the\r\n    variations of a magnetic potential.\r\n\r\n    “(3) The induction (or influence) of statical electricity\r\n    through dielectrics.\r\n\r\n    “We may now proceed to demonstrate from these principles the\r\n    existence and laws of the mechanical forces, which act upon\r\n    electric currents, magnets, and electrified bodies placed in\r\n    the electro-magnetic field.”\r\n\r\nIn his introduction to the paper, he discusses in a general way the\r\nvarious explanations of electric phenomena which had been given, and\r\npoints out that--\r\n\r\n    “It appears, therefore, that certain phenomena in electricity\r\n    and magnetism lead to the same conclusion as those of optics,\r\n    namely, that there is an ætherial medium pervading all bodies,\r\n    and modified only in degree by their presence; that the parts\r\n    of this medium are capable of being set in motion by electric\r\n    currents and magnets; that this motion is communicated from\r\n    one part of the medium to another by forces arising from the\r\n    connection of those parts; that under the action of these\r\n    forces there is a certain yielding depending on the elasticity\r\n    of these connections; and that, therefore, energy in two\r\n    different forms may exist in the medium, the one form being\r\n    the actual energy of motion of its parts, and the other being\r\n    the potential energy stored up in the connections in virtue of\r\n    their elasticity.\r\n\r\n    “Thus, then, we are led to the conception of a complicated\r\n    mechanism capable of a vast variety of motion, but at the\r\n    same time so connected that the motion of one part depends,\r\n    according to definite relations, on the motion of other parts,\r\n    these motions being communicated by forces arising from the\r\n    relative displacement of the connected parts, in virtue of\r\n    their elasticity. Such a mechanism must be subject to the\r\n    general laws of dynamics, and we ought to be able to work out\r\n    all the consequences of its motion, provided we know the form\r\n    of the relation between the motions of the parts.”\r\n\r\nThese general laws of dynamics, applicable to the motion of any\r\nconnected system, had been developed by Lagrange, and are expressed\r\nin his generalised equations of motion. It is one of Maxwell’s chief\r\nclaims to fame that he saw in the electric field a connected system to\r\nwhich Lagrange’s equations could be applied, and that he was able to\r\ndeduce the mechanical and electrical actions which take place by means\r\nof fundamental propositions of dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe methods of the paper now under discussion were developed further\r\nin the “Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism,” published in 1873; in\r\nendeavouring to give some slight account of Maxwell’s work, we shall\r\ndescribe it in the form it ultimately took.\r\n\r\nThe task which Maxwell set himself was a double one; he had first to\r\nexpress in symbols, in as general a form as possible, the fundamental\r\nlaws of electro-magnetism as deduced from experiments, chiefly\r\nthe experiments of Faraday, and the relations between the various\r\nquantities involved; when this was done he had to show how these laws\r\ncould be deduced from the general dynamical laws applicable to any\r\nsystem of moving bodies.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of phenomena, electric and magnetic, which have\r\nbeen known from very early times, and which are connected together.\r\nWhen a piece of sealing-wax is rubbed it is found to attract other\r\nbodies, it is said to exert electric force throughout the space\r\nsurrounding it; when two different metals are dipped in slightly\r\nacidulated water and connected by a wire, certain changes take place\r\nin the plates, the water, the wire, and the space round the wire,\r\nelectric force is again exerted and a current of electricity is said\r\nto flow in the wire. Again, certain bodies, such as the lodestone, or\r\npieces of iron and steel which have been treated in a certain manner,\r\nexhibit phenomena of action at a distance: they are said to exert\r\nmagnetic force, and it is found that this magnetic force exists in the\r\nneighbourhood of an electric current and is connected with the current.\r\n\r\nAgain, when electric force is applied to a body, the effects may be in\r\npart electrical, in part mechanical; the electrical state of the body\r\nis in general changed, while in addition, mechanical forces tending to\r\nmove the body are set up. Experiment must teach us how the electrical\r\nstate depends on the electric force, and what is the connection\r\nbetween this electric force and the magnetic forces which may, under\r\ncertain circumstances, be observed. Now, in specifying the electric\r\nand magnetic conditions of the system, various other quantities, in\r\naddition to the electric force, will have to be introduced; the first\r\nstep is to formulate the necessary quantities, and to determine the\r\nrelations between them and the electric force.\r\n\r\nConsider now a wire connecting the two poles of an electric battery--in\r\nits simplest form, a piece of zinc and a piece of copper in a vessel\r\nof dilute acid--electric force is produced at each point of the wire.\r\nLet us suppose this force known; an electric current depending on the\r\nmaterial and the size of the wire flows along it, its value can be\r\ndetermined at each point of the wire in terms of the electric force\r\nby Ohm’s law. If we take either this current or the electric force\r\nas known, we can determine by known laws the electric and magnetic\r\nconditions elsewhere. If we suppose the wire to be straight and very\r\nlong, then, so long as the current is steady and we neglect the small\r\neffect due to the electrostatic charge on the wire, there is no\r\nelectric force outside the wire. There is, however, magnetic force,\r\nand it is found that the lines of magnetic force are circles round the\r\nwire. It is found also that the work done in travelling once completely\r\nround the wire against the magnetic force is measured by the current\r\nflowing through the wire, and is obtained in the system of units\r\nusually adopted by multiplying the current by 4π. This last result then\r\ngives us one of the necessary relations, that between the magnetic\r\nforce due to a current and the strength of the current.\r\n\r\nAgain, consider a steady current flowing in a conductor of any form or\r\nshape, the total flow of current across any section of the conductor\r\ncan be measured in various ways, and it is found that at any time this\r\ntotal flow is the same for each section of the conductor. In this\r\nrespect the flow of a current resembles that of an incompressible\r\nfluid through a pipe; where the pipe is narrow the velocity of flow\r\nis greater than it is where the pipe is broad, but the total quantity\r\ncrossing each section at any given instant is the same.\r\n\r\nConsider now two conducting bodies, two spheres, or two flat plates\r\nplaced near together but insulated. Let each conductor be connected\r\nto one of the poles of the battery by a conducting wire. Then, for a\r\nvery short interval after the contact is made, it is found that there\r\nis a current in each wire which rapidly dies away to zero. In the\r\nneighbourhood of the balls there is electric force; the balls are said\r\nto be charged with electricity, and the lines of force are curved lines\r\nrunning from one ball to the other. It is found that the balls slightly\r\nattract each other, and the space between them is now in a different\r\ncondition from what it was before the balls were charged. According\r\nto Maxwell, _Electric Displacement_ has been produced in this space,\r\nand the electric displacement at each point is proportional to the\r\nelectric force at that point.\r\n\r\nThus, (i) when electric force acts on a conductor, it produces a\r\ncurrent, the current being by Ohm’s law proportional to the force:\r\n(ii) when it acts on an insulator it produces electric displacement,\r\nand the displacement is proportional to the force; while (iii) there\r\nis magnetic force in the neighbourhood of the current, and the work\r\ndone in carrying a magnetic pole round any complete circuit linked\r\nwith the current is proportional to the current. The first two of\r\nthese principles give us two sets of equations connecting together the\r\nelectric force and the current in a conductor or the displacement in a\r\ndielectric respectively; the third connects the magnetic force and the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nNow let us go back to the variable period when the current is flowing\r\nin the wires; and to make ideas precise, let the two conductors be two\r\nequal large flat plates placed with their faces parallel, and at some\r\nsmall distance apart. In this case, when the plates are charged, and\r\nthe current has ceased, the electric displacement and the force are\r\nconfined almost entirely to the space between the plates. During the\r\nvariable period the total flow at any instant across each section of\r\nthe wire is the same, but in the ordinary sense of the word there is no\r\nflow of electricity across the insulating medium between the plates.\r\nIn this space, however, the electric displacement is continuously\r\nchanging, rising from zero initially to its final steady value when the\r\ncurrent ceases. It is a fundamental part of Maxwell’s theory that this\r\nvariation of electric displacement is equivalent in all respects to a\r\ncurrent. The current at any point in a dielectric is measured by the\r\nrate of change of displacement at that point.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is also an essential point that if we consider any section\r\nof the dielectric between the two plates, the rate of change of the\r\ntotal displacement across this section is at each moment equal to the\r\ntotal flow of current across each section of the conducting wire.\r\n\r\nCurrents of electricity, therefore, including displacement\r\ncurrents, always flow in closed circuits, and obey the laws of an\r\nincompressible fluid in that the total flow across each section of the\r\ncircuit--conducting or dielectric--is at any moment the same.\r\n\r\nIt should be clearly remembered that this fundamental hypothesis of\r\nMaxwell’s theory is an assumption only to be justified by experiment.\r\nVon Helmholtz, in his paper on “The Equations of Motion of Electricity\r\nfor Bodies at Rest,” formed his equations in an entirely different\r\nmanner from Maxwell, and arrived at results of a more general\r\ncharacter, which do not require us to suppose that currents flow always\r\nin closed circuits, but permit of the condensation of electricity at\r\npoints in the circuit where the conductors end and the non-conducting\r\npart of the circuit begins. We leave for the present the question which\r\nof the two theories, if either, represents the facts.\r\n\r\nWe have obtained above three fundamental relations--(i) that between\r\nelectric force and electric current in a conductor; (ii) that between\r\nelectric force and electric displacement in a dielectric; (iii) that\r\nbetween magnetic force and the current which gives rise to it. And\r\nwe have seen that an electric current--_i.e._ in a dielectric the\r\nvariation of the strength of an electric field of force--gives rise\r\nto magnetic force. Now, magnetic force acting on a medium produces\r\n“magnetic displacement,” or magnetic induction, as it is called. In\r\nall media except iron, nickel, cobalt, and a few other substances, the\r\nmagnetic induction is proportional to the magnetic force, and the ratio\r\nbetween the magnetic induction produced by a given force and the force\r\nis found to be very nearly the same for all such media. This ratio is\r\nknown as the permeability, and is generally denoted by the symbol μ.\r\n\r\nA relation reciprocal to that given in (iii) above might be\r\nanticipated, and was, in fact, discovered by Faraday. Changes in a\r\nfield of magnetic induction give rise to electric force, and hence to\r\ndisplacement currents in a dielectric or to conduction currents in a\r\nconductor. In considering the relation between these changes and the\r\nelectric force, it is simplest at first not to deal with magnetic\r\nmatter such as iron, nickel, or cobalt; and then we may say that (iv)\r\nthe work which at any instant would be done in carrying a unit quantity\r\nof electricity round a closed circuit in a magnetic field against the\r\nelectric forces due to the field is equal to the rate at which the\r\ntotal magnetic induction which threads the circuit is being decreased.\r\nThis law, summing up Faraday’s experiments on electro-magnetic\r\ninduction, gives a fourth principle, leading to a fourth series of\r\nequations connecting together the electric and magnetic quantities\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe equations deduced from the above four principles, together with the\r\ncondition implied in the continuity of an electric current, constitute\r\nMaxwell’s equations of the electro-magnetic field.\r\n\r\nIf we are dealing only with a dielectric medium, the reciprocal\r\nrelation between the third and fourth principle may be made more clear\r\nby the following statement:--\r\n\r\n(A) The work done at any moment in carrying a unit quantity of\r\nmagnetism round a closed circuit in a field in which electric\r\ndisplacement is varying, is equal to the rate of change of the total\r\nelectric displacement through the circuit multiplied by 4 π.[62]\r\n\r\n(B) The work done at any moment in carrying a unit quantity of\r\nelectricity round a circuit in a field in which the magnetic induction\r\nis varying, is equal to the rate of change of the total magnetic\r\ninduction through the circuit.\r\n\r\nFrom these two principles, combined with the laws connecting electric\r\nforce and displacement, magnetic force and induction, and with the\r\ncondition of continuity, Maxwell obtained his equations of the field.\r\n\r\nFaraday’s experiments on electro-magnetic induction afford the proof of\r\nthe truth of the fourth principle. It follows from those experiments\r\nthat when the number of lines of magnetic induction which are linked\r\nwith any closed circuit are made to vary, an induced electromotive\r\nforce is brought into play round that circuit. This electromotive force\r\nis, according to Faraday’s results, measured by the rate of decrease\r\nin the number of lines of magnetic induction which thread the circuit.\r\nMaxwell applies this principle to all circuits, whether conducting or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nIn obtaining equations to express in symbols the results of the fourth\r\nprinciple just enunciated, Maxwell introduces a new quantity, to which\r\nhe gives the name of the “vector potential.” This quantity appears in\r\nhis analysis, and its physical meaning is not at first quite clear.\r\nProfessor Poynting has, however, put Maxwell’s principles in a slightly\r\ndifferent form, which enables us to see definitely the meaning of the\r\nvector potential, and to deduce Maxwell’s equations more readily from\r\nthe fundamental statements.\r\n\r\nWe are dealing with a circuit with which lines of magnetic induction\r\nare linked, while the number of such lines linked with the circuit is\r\nvarying. Now, let us suppose the variation to take place in consequence\r\nof the lines of induction moving outwards or inwards, as the case may\r\nbe, so as to cut the circuit. Originally there are none linked with\r\nthe circuit. As the magnetic field has grown to its present strength\r\nlines of magnetic induction have moved inwards. Each little element of\r\nthe circuit has been cut by some, and the total number linked with the\r\ncircuit can be found by adding together those cut by each element. Now,\r\nProfessor Poynting’s statement of Maxwell’s fourth principle is that\r\nthe electrical force in the direction of any element of the circuit is\r\nfound by dividing by the length of the element the number of lines of\r\nmagnetic induction which are cut in one second by it.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the total number of lines of magnetic induction which have\r\nbeen cut by an element of unit length is defined as the component\r\nof the vector potential in the direction of the element; hence the\r\nelectrical force in any direction is the rate of decrease of the\r\ncomponent of the vector potential in that direction. We have thus a\r\nphysical meaning for the vector potential, and shall find that in the\r\ndynamical theory this quantity is of great importance.\r\n\r\nProfessor Poynting has modified Maxwell’s third principle in a similar\r\nmanner; he looks upon the variation in the electric displacement as\r\ndue to the motion of tubes of electric induction,[63] and the magnetic\r\nforce along any circuit is equal to the number of tubes of electric\r\ninduction cutting or cut by unit length of the circuit per second,\r\nmultiplied by 4π.\r\n\r\nFrom the equations of the field, as found by Maxwell, it is possible\r\nto derive two sets of symmetrical equations. The one set connects the\r\nrate of change of the electric force with quantities depending on the\r\nmagnetic force; the other set connects in a similar manner the rate of\r\nchange of the magnetic force with quantities depending on the electric\r\nforce. Several writers in recent years adopt these equations as the\r\nfundamental relations of the field, establishing them by the argument\r\nthat they lead to consequences which are found to be in accordance with\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured to give some account of Maxwell’s historical\r\nmethod, according to which the equations are deduced from the laws of\r\nelectric currents and of electro-magnetic induction derived directly\r\nfrom experiment.\r\n\r\nWhile the manner in which Maxwell obtained his equations is all his\r\nown, he was not alone in stating and discussing general equations\r\nof the electro-magnetic field. The next steps which we are about to\r\nconsider are, however, in a special manner due to him. An electrical\r\nor magnetic system is the seat of energy; this energy is partly\r\nelectrical, partly magnetic, and various expressions can be found for\r\nit. In Maxwell’s theory it is a fundamental assumption that energy has\r\nposition. “The electric and magnetic energies of any electro-magnetic\r\nsystem,” says Professor Poynting, “reside, therefore, somewhere in the\r\nfield.” It follows from this that they are present wherever electric\r\nand magnetic force can be shown to exist. Maxwell showed that all the\r\nelectric energy is accounted for by supposing that in the neighbourhood\r\nof a point at which the electric force is R there is an amount of\r\nenergy per unit of volume equal to KR²/8π, K being the inductive\r\ncapacity of the medium, while in the neighbourhood of a point at which\r\nthe magnetic force is H, the magnetic energy per unit of volume is\r\nμH²/8π, μ being the permeability. He supposes, then, that at each point\r\nof an electro-magnetic system energy is stored according to these\r\nlaws. It follows, then, that the electro-magnetic field resembles a\r\ndynamical system in which energy is stored. Can we discover more of\r\nthe mechanism by which the actions in the field are maintained? Now\r\nthe motion of any point of a connected system depends on that of other\r\npoints of the system; there are generally, in any machine, a certain\r\nnumber of points called driving-points, the motion of which controls\r\nthe motion of all other parts of the machine; if the motion of the\r\ndriving-points be known, that of any other point can be determined.\r\nThus in a steam engine the motion of a point on the fly-wheel can be\r\nfound if the motion of the piston and the connections between the\r\npiston and the wheel be known.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the force which is acting on any part of the\r\nmachine we must find its momentum, and then calculate the rate at\r\nwhich this momentum is being changed. This rate of change will give us\r\nthe force. The method of calculation which it is necessary to employ\r\nwas first given by Lagrange, and afterwards developed, with some\r\nmodifications, by Hamilton. It is usually referred to as Hamilton’s\r\nprinciple; when the equations in the original form are used they are\r\nknown as Lagrange’s equations.\r\n\r\nNow Maxwell showed how these methods of calculation could be applied\r\nto the electro-magnetic field. The energy of a dynamical system is\r\npartly kinetic, partly potential. Maxwell supposes that the magnetic\r\nenergy of the field is kinetic energy, the electric energy potential.\r\nWhen the kinetic energy of a system is known, the momentum of any\r\npart of the system can be calculated by recognised processes. Thus if\r\nwe consider a circuit in an electro-magnetic field we can calculate\r\nthe energy of the field, and hence obtain the momentum corresponding\r\nto this circuit. If we deal with a simple case in which the conducting\r\ncircuits are fixed in position, and only the current in each circuit is\r\nallowed to vary, the rate of change of momentum corresponding to any\r\ncircuit will give the force in that circuit. The momentum in question\r\nis electric momentum, and the force is electric force. Now we have\r\nalready seen that the electric force at any point of a conducting\r\ncircuit is given by the rate of change of the vector potential in the\r\ndirection considered. Hence we are led to identify the vector potential\r\nwith the electric momentum of our dynamical system; and, referring to\r\nthe original definition of vector potential, we see that the electric\r\nmomentum of a circuit is measured by the number of lines of magnetic\r\ninduction which are interlinked with it.\r\n\r\nAgain, the kinetic energy of a dynamical system can be expressed in\r\nterms of the squares and products of the velocities of its several\r\nparts. It can also be expressed by multiplying the velocity of each\r\ndriving-point by the momentum corresponding to that driving-point, and\r\ntaking half the sum of the products. Suppose, now, we are dealing with\r\na system consisting of a number of wire circuits in which currents are\r\nrunning, and let us suppose that we may represent the current in each\r\nwire as the velocity of a driving-point in our dynamical system. We can\r\nalso express in terms of these currents the electric momentum of each\r\nwire circuit; let this be done, and let half the sum of the products of\r\nthe corresponding velocities and momenta be formed.\r\n\r\nIn maintaining the currents in the wires energy is needed to supply\r\nthe heat which is produced in each wire; but in starting the currents\r\nit is found that more energy is needed than is requisite for the\r\nsupply of this heat. This excess of energy can be calculated, and when\r\nthe calculation is made it is found that the excess is equal to half\r\nthe sum of the products of the currents and corresponding momenta.\r\nMoreover, if this sum be expressed in terms of the magnetic force, it\r\nis found to be equal to μ H²/8 π, which is the magnetic energy of the\r\nfield. Now, when a dynamical system is set in motion against known\r\nforces, more energy is supplied than is needed to do the work against\r\nthe forces; this excess of energy measures the kinetic energy acquired\r\nby the system.\r\n\r\nHence, Maxwell was justified in taking the magnetic energy of the field\r\nas the kinetic energy of the mechanical system, and if the strengths\r\nof the currents in the wires be taken to represent the velocities of\r\nthe driving-points, this energy is measured in terms of the electrical\r\nvelocities and momenta in exactly the same way as the energy of a\r\nmechanical system is measured in terms of the velocities and momenta of\r\nits driving-points.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical system in which, according to Maxwell, the energy is\r\nstored is the ether. A state of motion or of strain is set up in the\r\nether of the field. The electric forces which drive the currents, and\r\nalso the mechanical forces acting on the conductors carrying the\r\ncurrents, are due to this state of motion, or it may be of strain, in\r\nthe ether. It must not be supposed that the term electric displacement\r\nin Maxwell’s mind meant an actual bodily displacement of the particles\r\nof the ether; it is in some way connected with such a material\r\ndisplacement. In his view, without motion of the ether particles\r\nthere would be no electric action, but he does not identify electric\r\ndisplacement and the displacement of an ether particle.\r\n\r\nHis mechanical theory, however, does account for the electro-magnetic\r\nforces between conductors carrying currents. The energy of the system\r\ndepends on the relative positions of the currents which form part of\r\nit. Now, any conservative mechanical system tends to set itself in\r\nsuch a position that its potential energy is least, its kinetic energy\r\ngreatest. The circuits of the system, then, will tend to set themselves\r\nso that the electro-kinetic energy of the system may be as large as\r\npossible; forces will be needed to hold them in any position in which\r\nthis condition is not satisfied.\r\n\r\nWe have another proof of the correctness of the value found for the\r\nenergy of the field in that the forces calculated from this value agree\r\nwith those which are determined by direct experiment.\r\n\r\nAgain, the forces applied at the various driving-points are transmitted\r\nto other points by the connections of the machine; the connections\r\nare thrown into a state of strain; stress exists throughout their\r\nsubstance. When we see the piston-rod and the shaft of an engine\r\nconnected by the crank and the connecting-rod, we recognise that the\r\nwork done on the piston is transmitted thus to the shaft. So, too, in\r\nthe electro-magnetic field, the ether forms the connection between the\r\nvarious circuits in the field; the forces with which those circuits\r\nact on each other are transmitted from one circuit to another by the\r\nstresses set up in the ether.\r\n\r\nTo take another instance, consider the electrostatic attraction between\r\ntwo charged bodies. Let us suppose the bodies charged by connecting\r\neach to the opposite pole of a battery; a current flows from the\r\nbattery setting up electric displacement in the space between the\r\nbodies, and throwing the ether into a state of strain. As the strain\r\nincreases the current gets less; the reaction resulting from the strain\r\ntends to stop it, until at last this reaction is so great that the\r\ncurrent is stopped. When this is the case the wires to the battery may\r\nbe removed, provided this is done without destroying the insulation of\r\nthe bodies; the state of strain will remain and shows itself in the\r\nattraction between the balls.\r\n\r\nLooking at the problem in this manner, we are face to face with two\r\ngreat questions--the one, What is the state of strain in the ether\r\nwhich will enable it to produce the observed electrostatic attractions\r\nand repulsions between charged bodies? and the other, What is the\r\nmechanical structure of the ether which would give rise to such a state\r\nof strain as will account for the observed forces? Maxwell gives one\r\nanswer to the first question; it is not the only answer which could\r\nbe given, but it does account for the facts. He failed to answer the\r\nsecond. He says (“Electricity and Magnetism,” vol. i. p. 132):--\r\n\r\n    “It must be carefully borne in mind that we have made only\r\n    one step in the theory of the action of the medium. We have\r\n    supposed it to be in a state of stress, but have not in\r\n    any way accounted for this stress, or explained how it is\r\n    maintained.... I have not been able to make the next step,\r\n    namely, to account by mechanical considerations for these\r\n    stresses in the dielectric.”\r\n\r\nFaraday had pointed out that the inductive action between two bodies\r\ntakes place along the lines of force, which tend to shorten along their\r\nlength and to spread outwards in other directions. Maxwell compares\r\nthem to the fibres of a muscle, which contracts and at the same time\r\nthickens when exerting force. In the electric field there is, on\r\nMaxwell’s theory, a tension along the lines of electric force and a\r\npressure at right angles to those lines. Maxwell proved that a tension\r\nK R²/8 π along the lines of force, combined with an equal pressure\r\nin perpendicular directions, would maintain the equilibrium of the\r\nfield, and would give rise to the observed attractions or repulsions\r\nbetween electrified bodies. Other distributions of stress might be\r\nfound which would lead to the same result. The one just stated will\r\nalways be connected with Maxwell’s name. It will be noticed that the\r\ntension along the lines of force and the pressure at right angles to\r\nthem are each numerically equal to the potential energy stored per unit\r\nof volume in the field. The value of each of the three quantities is K\r\nR²/8 π.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, in a magnetic field, there is a state of stress, and\r\non Maxwell’s theory this, too, consists of a tension along the lines\r\nof force and an equal pressure at right angles to them, the values of\r\nthe tension and the pressure being each equal to that of the magnetic\r\nenergy per unit of volume, or μH²/8π.\r\n\r\nIn a case in which both electric and magnetic force exists, these two\r\nstates of stress are superposed. The total energy per unit of volume\r\nis KR²/8π + μH²/8π; the total stress is made up of tensions KR²/8π and\r\nμH²/8π along the lines of electric and magnetic force respectively, and\r\nequal pressures at right angles to these lines.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, from Maxwell’s theory, that electric force produced at\r\nany given point in space is transmitted from that point by the action\r\nof the ether. The question suggests itself, Does the transmission take\r\ntime, and if so, does it proceed with a definite velocity depending on\r\nthe nature of the medium through which the change is proceeding?\r\n\r\nAccording to the molecular-vortex theory, we have seen that waves of\r\nelectric force are transmitted with a definite velocity. The more\r\ngeneral theory developed in the “Electricity and Magnetism” leads to\r\nthe same result. Electric force produced at any point travels outwards\r\nfrom that point with a velocity given by 1/√(Kμ). At a distant point\r\nthe force is zero, until the disturbance reaches it. If the disturbance\r\nlast only for a limited interval, its effects will at any future time\r\nbe confined to the space within a spherical shell of constant thickness\r\ndepending on the interval; the radii of this shell increase with\r\nuniform speed 1/√(Kμ).\r\n\r\nIf the initial disturbance be periodic, periodic waves of electric\r\nforce will travel out from the centre, just as waves of sound travel\r\nout from a bell, or waves of light from a candle flame. A wire carrying\r\nan alternating current may be such a source of periodic disturbance,\r\nand from the wire waves travel outwards into space.\r\n\r\nNow, it is known that in a sound wave the displacements of the air\r\nparticles take place in the direction in which the wave is travelling;\r\nthey lie at right angles to the wave front, and are spoken of as\r\nlongitudinal. In light waves, on the other hand, the displacements are,\r\nas Fresnel proved, in the wave front, at right angles, that is, to the\r\ndirection of propagation; they are transverse.\r\n\r\nTheory shows that in general both these waves may exist in an elastic\r\nsolid body, and that they travel with different velocities. Of which\r\nnature are the waves of electric displacement in a dielectric? It\r\ncan be shewn to follow as a necessary consequence of Maxwell’s views\r\nas to the closed character of all electric currents, that waves of\r\nelectric displacement are transverse. Electric vibrations, like those\r\nof light, are in the wave front and at right angles to the direction\r\nof propagation; they depend on the rigidity or quasi-rigidity of the\r\nmedium through which they travel, not on its resistance to compression.\r\n\r\nAgain, an electric current, whether due to variation of displacement\r\nin a dielectric or to conduction in a conductor, is accompanied by\r\nmagnetic force. A wave of periodic electric displacement, then, will be\r\nalso a wave of periodic magnetic force travelling at the same rate;\r\nand Maxwell shewed that the direction of this magnetic force also\r\nlies in the wave front, and is always at right angles to the electric\r\ndisplacement. In the ordinary theory of light the wave of linear\r\ndisplacement is accompanied by a wave of periodic angular twist about\r\na direction lying in the wave front and perpendicular to the linear\r\ndisplacement.\r\n\r\nIn many respects, then, waves of electric displacement resemble waves\r\nof light, and, indeed, as we proceed we shall find closer connections\r\nstill. Hence comes Maxwell’s electro-magnetic theory of light.\r\n\r\nIt is only in dielectric media that electric force is propagated by\r\nwave motion. In conductors, although the third and fourth of Maxwell’s\r\nprinciples given on page 185 still are true, the relation between\r\nthe electric force and the electric current differs from that which\r\nholds in a dielectric. Hence the equations satisfied by the force are\r\ndifferent. The laws of its propagation resemble those of the conduction\r\nof heat rather than those of the transmission of light.\r\n\r\nAgain, light travels with different velocities in different transparent\r\nmedia. The velocity of electric waves, as has been stated, is equal to\r\n1/√(μK); but in making this statement it is assumed that the simple\r\nlaws which hold where there is no gross matter--or, rather, where\r\nair is the only dielectric with which we are concerned--hold also in\r\nsolid or liquid dielectrics. In a solid or a liquid, as in vacuo, the\r\nwaves are propagated by the ether. We assume, as a first step towards\r\na complete theory, that so far as the electric waves are concerned\r\nthe sole effect produced by the matter shews itself in a change of\r\ninductive capacity or of permeability. It is not likely that such a\r\nsupposition should be the whole truth, and we may, therefore, expect\r\nresults deduced from it to be only approximation to the true result.\r\n\r\nNow, electro-magnetic experiments show that, excluding magnetic\r\nsubstances, the permeability of all bodies is very nearly the same,\r\nand differs very slightly from that of air. The inductive capacity,\r\nhowever, of different bodies is different, and hence the velocity with\r\nwhich electro-magnetic waves travel differs in different bodies.\r\n\r\nBut the refraction of waves of light depends on the fact that light\r\ntravels with different velocities in different media; hence we should\r\nexpect to have waves of electric displacement reflected and refracted\r\nwhen they pass from one dielectric, such as air, to another, such as\r\nglass or gutta-percha; moreover, for light the refractive index of\r\na medium such as glass is the ratio of the velocity in air to the\r\nvelocity in the glass.\r\n\r\nThus the electrical refractive index of glass is the ratio of the\r\nvelocity of electric waves in air to their velocity in glass.\r\n\r\nNow let K₀ be the inductive capacity of air, K₁ that of glass, taking\r\nthe permeability of air and glass to be the same, we have the result\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n  Electrical refractive index = √(K₁/K₀).\r\n\r\nBut the ratio of the inductive capacity of glass to that of air is\r\nknown as the specific inductive capacity of glass.\r\n\r\nHence, the specific inductive capacity of any medium is equal to the\r\nsquare of the electrical refractive index of that medium.\r\n\r\nSince Maxwell’s time the mathematical laws of the reflexion and\r\nrefraction of electric waves have been investigated by various writers,\r\nand it has been shewn that they agree exactly with those enunciated by\r\nFresnel for light.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have been discussing the propagation of electric waves\r\nin an isotropic medium, one which has identical properties in all\r\ndirections about a point. Let us now consider how these laws are\r\nmodified if the dielectric be crystalline in structure.\r\n\r\nMaxwell assumes that the crystalline character of the dielectric can\r\nbe sufficiently represented by supposing the inductive capacity to\r\nbe different in different directions; experiments have since shewn\r\nthat this is true for crystals such as Iceland Spar and Aragonite;\r\nhe assumes also, and this, too, is justified by experiment, that the\r\nmagnetic permeability does not depend on the direction. It follows\r\nfrom these assumptions that a crystal will produce double refraction\r\nand polarisation of electric waves which fall upon it, and, further,\r\nthat the laws of double refraction will be those given by Fresnel for\r\nlight waves in a doubly refracting medium. There will be two waves in\r\nthe crystal. The disturbance in each of these will be plane polarised;\r\ntheir velocity and the position of their plane of polarisation can be\r\nfound from the direction in which they are travelling by Fresnel’s\r\nconstruction exactly.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s theory, then, would appear to indicate some close connection\r\nbetween electric waves and those of light. Faraday’s experiments on\r\nthe rotation of the plane of polarisation by magnetic force shew one\r\nphenomenon in which the two are connected, and Maxwell endeavoured to\r\napply his theory to explain this. Here, however, it became necessary\r\nto introduce an additional hypothesis--there must be some connection\r\nbetween the motion of the ether to which magnetic force is due and that\r\nwhich constitutes light. It is impossible to give a mechanical account\r\nof the rotation of the plane of polarisation without some assumption as\r\nto the relation between these two kinds of motion. Maxwell, therefore,\r\nsupposes the linear displacements of a point in the ether to be those\r\nwhich give rise to light, while the components of the magnetic force\r\nare connected with these in the same way as the components of a vortex\r\nin a liquid in vortex motion are connected with the displacements of\r\nthe liquid. He further assumes the existence of a term of special form\r\nin the expression for the kinetic energy, and from these assumptions he\r\ndeduces the laws of the propagation of polarised light in a magnetic\r\nfield. These laws agree in the main with the results of Verdet’s\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF MAXWELL’S THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured in the preceding pages to give some account of\r\nMaxwell’s contributions to electrical theory and the physics of the\r\nether. We must now consider very briefly what evidence there is to\r\nsupport these views. At Maxwell’s death such evidence, though strong,\r\nwas indirect. His supporters were limited to some few English-speaking\r\npupils, young and enthusiastic, who were convinced, it may be, in no\r\nsmall measure, by the affection and reverence with which they regarded\r\ntheir master. Abroad his views had made very little way.\r\n\r\nIn the last words of his book he writes, speaking of various\r\ndistinguished workers--\r\n\r\n    “There appears to be in the minds of these eminent men some\r\n    prejudice, or _à priori_ objection, against the hypothesis\r\n    of a medium in which the phenomena of radiation of light and\r\n    heat, and the electric actions at a distance, take place. It\r\n    is true that, at one time, those who speculated as to the\r\n    causes of physical phenomena were in the habit of accounting\r\n    for each kind of action at a distance by means of a special\r\n    ætherial fluid, whose function and property it was to produce\r\n    these actions. They filled all space three and four times over\r\n    with æthers of different kinds, the properties of which were\r\n    invented merely to ‘save appearances,’ so that more rational\r\n    enquirers were willing rather to accept not only Newton’s\r\n    definite law of attraction at a distance, but even the dogma\r\n    of Cotes,[64] that action at a distance is one of the primary\r\n    properties of matter, and that no explanation can be more\r\n    intelligible than this fact. Hence the undulatory theory of\r\n    light has met with much opposition, directed not against its\r\n    failure to explain the phenomena, but against its assumption of\r\n    the existence of a medium in which light is propagated.\r\n\r\n    “We have seen that the mathematical expression for\r\n    electro-dynamic action led, in the mind of Gauss, to the\r\n    conviction that a theory of the propagation of electric\r\n    action in time would be found to be the very key-stone of\r\n    electro-dynamics. Now we are unable to conceive of propagation\r\n    in time, except either as the flight of a material substance\r\n    through space, or as the propagation of a condition of motion,\r\n    or stress, in a medium already existing in space.\r\n\r\n    “In the theory of Neumann, the mathematical conception called\r\n    potential, which we are unable to conceive as a material\r\n    substance, is supposed to be projected from one particle to\r\n    another in a manner which is quite independent of a medium,\r\n    and which, as Neumann has himself pointed out, is extremely\r\n    different from that of the propagation of light.\r\n\r\n    “In the theories of Riemann and Betti it would appear that the\r\n    action is supposed to be propagated in a manner somewhat more\r\n    similar to that of light.\r\n\r\n    “But in all of these theories the question naturally\r\n    occurs:--If something is transmitted from one particle to\r\n    another at a distance, what is its condition after it has\r\n    left one particle and before it has reached the other? If\r\n    this something is the potential energy of the two particles,\r\n    as in Neumann’s theory, how are we to conceive this energy\r\n    as existing in a point of space, coinciding neither with the\r\n    one particle nor with the other? In fact, whenever energy is\r\n    transmitted from one body to another in time, there must be\r\n    a medium or substance in which the energy exists after it\r\n    leaves one body and before it reaches the other, for energy,\r\n    as Torricelli[65] remarked, ‘is a quintessence of so subtle a\r\n    nature that it cannot be contained in any vessel except the\r\n    inmost substance of material things.’ Hence all these theories\r\n    lead to a conception of a medium in which the propagation takes\r\n    place, and if we admit this medium as an hypothesis, I think\r\n    it ought to occupy a prominent place in our investigations,\r\n    and that we ought to endeavour to construct a mental\r\n    representation of all the details of its action, and this has\r\n    been my constant aim in this treatise.”\r\n\r\nLet us see, then, what were the experimental grounds in Maxwell’s day\r\nfor accepting as true his views on electrical action, and how since\r\nthen, by the genius of Heinrich Hertz and the labours of his followers,\r\nthose grounds have been rendered so sure that nearly the whole progress\r\nof electrical science during the last twenty years has consisted in\r\nthe development of ideas which are to be found in the “Treatise on\r\nElectricity and Magnetism.”\r\n\r\nThe purely electrical consequences of Maxwell’s theory were of course\r\nin accord with all known electrical observations. The equations of the\r\nfield accounted for the electro-magnetic forces observed in various\r\nexperiments, and from them the laws of electro-magnetic induction\r\ncould be correctly deduced; but there was nothing very special in\r\nthis. Similar equations had been obtained from the theory of action at\r\na distance by various writers; in fact, Helmholtz’s theory, based on\r\nthe most general form of expression for the force between two elements\r\nof current consistent with certain experiments of Ampère’s, was more\r\ngeneral in its character than Maxwell’s. The destructive features of\r\nMaxwell’s theory were:\r\n\r\n(1) The assumption that all currents flow in closed circuits.\r\n\r\n(2) The idea of energy residing throughout the electro-magnetic\r\nfield in consequence of the strains and stresses set up in the\r\nelectro-magnetic medium by the actions to which it was subject.\r\n\r\n(3) The identification of this electro-magnetic medium with the\r\nluminiferous ether, and the consequent view that light is an\r\nelectro-magnetic phenomena.\r\n\r\n(4) The view that electro-magnetic forces arise entirely from strains\r\nand stresses set up in the ether; the electrostatic charge of an\r\ninsulated conductor being one of the forms in which the ether strain is\r\nmanifested to us.\r\n\r\n(5) A dielectric under the action of electric force is said to\r\nbecome polarised, and, according to Maxwell (vol. i. p. 133), all\r\nelectrification is the residual effect of the polarisation of the\r\ndielectric.\r\n\r\nNow it must, I think, be admitted that in Maxwell’s day there was\r\ndirect proof of very few of these propositions. No one has even yet so\r\nmeasured the displacement currents in a dielectric as to show that the\r\ntotal flow across every section of a circuit is at any given moment\r\nthe same, though there are other experiments of an indirect character\r\nwhich have now completely justified Maxwell’s hypothesis. Experiments\r\nby Schiller and Von Helmholtz prove it is true that some action in\r\nthe dielectric must be taken into consideration in any satisfactory\r\ntheory; they therefore upset various theories based on direct action at\r\na distance, “but they tell us nothing as to whether any special form\r\nof the dielectric theory, such as Maxwell’s or Helmholtz’s, is true or\r\nnot.” (J. J. Thomson, “Report on Electrical Theories,” B.A. Report,\r\n1885, p. 149.)\r\n\r\nWhen Maxwell died there had been little if any experimental evidence\r\nas to the stresses set up in a body by electric force. Fontana, Govi,\r\nand Duter had all observed that changes take place in the volume of\r\nthe dielectric of a condenser when it is charged. Quincke had taken\r\nup the work, and the first of his classic papers on this subject was\r\npublished in 1880, the year following Maxwell’s death. Maxwell himself\r\nwas fond of shewing an experiment in which a charged insulated sphere\r\nwas brought near to the surface of paraffin; the stress on the surface\r\ncauses a heaping up of the paraffin under the sphere.\r\n\r\nKerr had shewn in 1875 that many substances become doubly refracting\r\nunder electric stress; his complete determination of the laws of this\r\naction was published at a later date.\r\n\r\nAs to direct measurements on electric waves, there were none; the value\r\nof the velocity with which, if Maxwell’s theory were true, they must\r\ntravel had been determined from electrical observations of quite a\r\ndifferent character. Weber and Kohlrausch had measured the value of K\r\nfor air, for which μ is unity, and from their observations it follows\r\nthat the value of the wave velocity for electro-magnetic waves is about\r\n31 × 10⁹ centimetres per second. The velocity of light was known, from\r\nthe experiments of Fizeau and Foucault, to have about this value, and\r\nit was the near coincidence of these two values which led Maxwell to\r\nwrite in 1864:--\r\n\r\n“The agreement of the results seems to show that light and magnetism\r\nare affections of the same substance, and that light is an\r\nelectro-magnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to\r\nelectro-magnetic laws.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the first edition of the “Electricity and Magnetism”\r\nwas published, Maxwell and Thomson (Lord Kelvin) had both made\r\ndeterminations of K, and had shewn that for air at least the resulting\r\nvalue for the velocity of electro-magnetic waves was very nearly that\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nFor other substances at that date the observations were fewer still.\r\nGibson and Barclay had determined the specific inductive capacity\r\nof paraffin, and found that its square root was 1·405, while its\r\nrefractive index for long waves is 1·422. Maxwell himself thought\r\nthat if a similar agreement could be shewn to hold for a number of\r\nsubstances, we should be warranted in concluding that “the square root\r\nof K, though it may not be the complete expression for the index of\r\nrefraction, is at least the most important term in it.”\r\n\r\nBetween this time and Maxwell’s death enough had been done to more\r\nthan justify this statement. It was clear from the observations of\r\nBoltzmann, Silow, Hopkinson, and others that there were many substances\r\nfor which the square root of the specific inductive capacity was very\r\nnearly indeed equal to the refractive index, and good reason had been\r\ngiven why in some cases there should be a considerable difference\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\nHopkinson found that in the case of glass the differences were very\r\nlarge, and they have since been found to be considerable for most\r\nsolids examined, with the exception of paraffin and sulphur. For\r\npetroleum oil, benzine, toluene, carbon-bisulphide, and some other\r\nliquids the agreement between Maxwell’s theory and experiment is\r\nclose. For the fatty oils, such as castor oil, olive oil, sperm oil,\r\nneatsfoot oil, and also for ether, the differences are considerable.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the reason for this difference lies in the\r\nfact that, in the light waves, we are dealing with the wave velocity\r\nof a disturbance of an extremely short period. Now, we know that the\r\nsubstances mentioned shew optical dispersion, and we have at present\r\nno completely satisfactory theory from which we can calculate, from\r\nexperiments on very short waves, what the velocity for very long\r\nwaves will be. In most cases Cauchy’s formula has been used to obtain\r\nthe numbers given. The value of K, however, as found by experiment,\r\ncorresponds to these infinitely long waves, and to quote Professor\r\nJ. J. Thomson’s words, “the marvel is not that there should not be\r\nsubstances for which the relation K = μ² does not hold, but that there\r\nshould be any for which it does.”[66]\r\n\r\nIt has been shewn, moreover, both by Professor J. J. Thomson himself\r\nand by Blondlot, that when the value of K is measured under very\r\nrapidly varying electrifications, changing at the rate of about\r\n25,000,000 to the second, the value of the inductive capacity for glass\r\nis reduced from about 6·8 or 7 to about 2·7; the square root of this is\r\n1·6, which does not differ much from its refractive index. The values\r\nof the inductive capacity of paraffin and sulphur, which it will be\r\nremembered agree fairly with Maxwell’s theory, were found to be not\r\ngreatly different in the steady and in the rapidly varying field.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some experiments of Arons and Rubens in rapidly\r\nvarying fields lead to values which do not differ greatly from those\r\ngiven by other methods. The theory, however, of these experiments seems\r\nopen to criticism.\r\n\r\nTo attempt anything like a complete account of modern verifications\r\nof Maxwell’s views and modern developments of his theory is a task\r\nbeyond our limits, but an account of Maxwell written in 1895 would be\r\nincomplete without a reference to the work of Heinrich Hertz.\r\n\r\nMaxwell told us what the properties of electro-magnetic waves in air\r\nmust be. Hertz[67] in 1887 enabled us to measure those properties, and\r\nthe measurements have verified completely Maxwell’s views.\r\n\r\nThe method of producing electrical oscillations in a conductor had\r\nlong been known. Thomson and Von Helmholtz had both pointed it out.\r\nSchiller had examined such oscillations in 1874, and had determined the\r\ninductive capacity of glass by their means, using oscillations whose\r\nperiod varied from ·000056 to ·00012 of a second.\r\n\r\nThese oscillations were produced by discharging a condenser through a\r\ncoil of wire having self-induction. If the electrical resistance of the\r\ncoil be not too great, the charge oscillates backwards and forwards\r\nbetween the plates of the condenser until its energy is dissipated in\r\nthe heat produced in the wire, and in the electro-magnetic radiations\r\nwhich leave it.\r\n\r\nThe period of these oscillations under proper conditions is given by\r\nthe formula T = 2π√(CL) where L, the coefficient of self induction,\r\nand _C_ the capacity of the condenser. These quantities can be\r\ncalculated, and hence the time of an oscillation is known. From such\r\nan arrangement waves radiate out into space. If we could measure\r\nby any method the length of such a wave we could determine its\r\nvelocity by dividing the wave length by the period. But it is clear\r\nthat since the velocity is comparable with that of light the wave\r\nlength will be enormous, unless the period is very short. Thus, a\r\nwave, travelling with the velocity of light, whose period was ·0001\r\nsecond, such as the waves Schiller worked with, would have a length of\r\n·0001 × 30,000,000,000 or 3,000,000 centimetres, and would be quite\r\nunmeasurable. Before measurements on electric waves could be made it\r\nwas necessary (1) to produce waves of sufficiently rapid period, (2) to\r\ndevise means to detect them. This is what Hertz did.\r\n\r\nThe wave length of the electrical oscillations can be reduced by\r\nreducing either the electrical capacity of the system, or the\r\ncoefficient of self-induction of the wire. Hertz adopted both these\r\nexpedients. His vibrator, in some of his more important experiments,\r\nconsisted of two square brass plates 40 cm. in the side. To each of\r\nthese is attached a piece of copper wire about 30 cm. in length, and\r\neach wire ends in a small highly-polished brass ball. The plates are\r\nplaced so that the wires lie in the same straight line, the brass\r\nballs being separated by a very small air gap. The two plates are then\r\ncharged, the one positively the other negatively, until the insulation\r\nresistance of the air gap breaks down and a discharge passes across.\r\nUnder these conditions the discharge is oscillatory. It does not\r\nconsist of a single spark, but of a series of sparks, which pass\r\nand repass in opposite directions, until the energy of the original\r\ncharge is radiated into space or dissipated as heat; the plates are\r\nthen recharged and the process repeated. In Hertz’s experiments the\r\noscillator was charged by being connected to the secondary terminals of\r\nan induction coil.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Professor Fitzgerald had called attention to this method of\r\nproducing electric waves in air, and had given two metres as the\r\nminimum wave length which might be attained. In 1870 Herr von Bezold\r\nhad actually made observations on the propagation and reflection of\r\nelectrical oscillations, but his work, published as a preliminary\r\ncommunication, had attracted little notice. Hertz was the first to\r\nundertake in 1887 in a systematic manner the investigation of the\r\nelectric waves in air which proceed from such an oscillator with a view\r\nto testing various theories of electro-magnetic action.\r\n\r\nIt remained, however, necessary to devise an apparatus for detecting\r\nthe waves. When the waves are incident on a conductor, electric\r\nsurgings are set up in the conductor, and may, under proper conditions,\r\nbe observed as tiny sparks. Hertz used as his detector a loop of wire,\r\nthe ends of which terminated in two small brass balls. The wire was\r\nbent so that the balls were very close together, and the sparks could\r\nbe seen passing across the tiny air gap which separated them. Such\r\na wire will have a definite period of its own for oscillations of\r\nelectricity with which it may be charged, and if the frequency of the\r\nelectric waves which fall on it agrees with that of the waves which\r\nit can itself emit, the oscillations which are set up in the wire will\r\nbe stronger than under other conditions, the sparks seen will be more\r\nbrilliant.[68] Hertz’s resonator was a circle of wire thirty-five\r\ncentimetres in radius, the period for such a resonator would, he\r\ncalculated, be the same as that of his vibrator.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, very considerable difficulty in determining the\r\nperiod of an electric oscillator from its dimensions, and the value\r\nobtained from calculation for that of Hertz’s radiator is not very\r\ntrustworthy. The complete period is, however, comparable with two\r\none hundredth millionths of a second; in his original papers, Hertz,\r\nthrough an error, gave a value greater than this.\r\n\r\nWith these arrangements Hertz was able to detect the presence of\r\nelectrical radiation at considerable distances from the radiator; he\r\nwas also able to measure its wave length. In the case of sound waves\r\nthe existence of nodes and loops formed under proper conditions is\r\nwell known. When waves are directly reflected from a flat surface,\r\ninterference takes place between the incident and reflected waves,\r\nstationary vibrations are set up, and nodes and loops--places, that\r\nis, of minimum and of maximum motion respectively--are formed. The\r\nposition of these nodes and loops can be determined by the aid of\r\nsuitable apparatus, and it can be shewn that the distance between two\r\nconsecutive nodes is half the wave length.\r\n\r\nSimilarly when electrical vibrations fall on a reflector, a large\r\nflat surface of metal, for example, stationary vibrations due to the\r\ninterference between the incident and reflected waves are produced, and\r\nthese give rise to electrical nodes and loops. The position of such\r\nnodes and loops can be found by the use of Hertz’s apparatus, or in\r\nother ways, and hence the length of the electrical waves can be found.\r\nThe existence of the nodes and loops shews that the electric effects\r\nare propagated by wave motion. The length of the waves is found to be\r\ndefinite, since the nodes and loops recur at equal intervals apart.\r\n\r\nIf it be assumed that the frequency is known, the velocity of wave\r\npropagation can be determined. Hertz found from his experiments that\r\nin air the waves travelled with the velocity of light. It appears,\r\nhowever, that there were two errors in the calculation which happened\r\nto correct each other, so that neither the value of the frequency given\r\nin Hertz’s paper nor the wave length observed is correct.\r\n\r\nBy modifying the apparatus it was possible to measure the wave length\r\nof the waves transmitted along a copper wire, and hence, again\r\nassuming the period of oscillation, to calculate the velocity of wave\r\npropagation along the wire. Hertz made the experiment, and found from\r\nhis first observations that the waves were propagated along the wire\r\nwith a finite velocity, but that the velocity differed from that in\r\nair. The half-wave length in the wire was only about 2·8 metres; that\r\nin air was about 4·5 metres.\r\n\r\nNow, this experiment afforded a crucial test between the theories of\r\nMaxwell and Von Helmholtz. According to the former, the waves do not\r\ntravel in the wire at all; they travel through the air alongside the\r\nwire, and the wave length observed by Hertz ought to have been the same\r\nas in air. According to Von Helmholtz, the two velocities observed\r\nby Hertz should have been different, as, indeed, they were, and the\r\nexperiment appeared to prove that Maxwell’s theory was insufficient and\r\nthat a more general one, such as that of Von Helmholtz, was necessary.\r\nBut other experiments have not led to the same result. Hertz himself,\r\nusing more rapid oscillations in some later measurements, found that\r\nthe wave length of the electric waves from a given oscillator was the\r\nsame whether they were transmitted through free space or conducted\r\nalong a wire.[69] Lecher and J. J. Thomson have arrived at the same\r\nresult; but the most complete experiments on this point are those of\r\nSarasin and De la Rive.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken, then, as established that Maxwell’s theory is\r\nsufficient, and that the greater generality of Von Helmholtz is\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn a later paper Hertz showed that electric waves could be reflected\r\nand refracted, polarised and analysed, just like light waves. In his\r\nintroduction to his “Collected Papers” he writes (p. 19):--\r\n\r\n    “Casting now a glance backwards, we see that by the experiments\r\n    above sketched the propagation in time of a supposed action\r\n    at a distance is for the first time proved. This fact forms\r\n    the philosophic result of the experiments, and indeed, in a\r\n    certain sense, the most important result. The proof includes\r\n    a recognition of the fact that the electric forces can\r\n    disentangle themselves from material bodies, and can continue\r\n    to subsist as conditions or changes in the state of space. The\r\n    details of the experiments further prove that the particular\r\n    manner in which the electric force is propagated exhibits the\r\n    closest analogy[70] with the propagation of light; indeed, that\r\n    it corresponds almost completely to it. The hypothesis that\r\n    light is an electrical phenomenon is thus made highly probable.\r\n    To give a strict proof of this hypothesis would logically\r\n    require experiments upon light itself.\r\n\r\n    “What we here indicate as having been accomplished by the\r\n    experiments is accomplished independently of the correctness\r\n    of particular theories. Nevertheless, there is an obvious\r\n    connection between the experiments and the theory in connection\r\n    with which they were really undertaken. Since the year 1861\r\n    science has been in possession of a theory which Maxwell\r\n    constructed upon Faraday’s views, and which we therefore call\r\n    the Faraday-Maxwell theory. This theory affirms the possibility\r\n    of the class of phenomena here discovered just as positively\r\n    as the remaining electrical theories are compelled to deny\r\n    it. From the outset Maxwell’s theory excelled all others in\r\n    elegance and in the abundance of the relations between the\r\n    various phenomena which it included.\r\n\r\n    “The probability of this theory, and therefore the number of\r\n    its adherents, increased from year to year. But as long as\r\n    Maxwell’s theory depended solely upon the probability of its\r\n    results, and not on the certainty of its hypotheses, it could\r\n    not completely displace the theories which were opposed to it.\r\n\r\n    “The fundamental hypotheses of Maxwell’s theory contradicted\r\n    the usual views, and did not rest upon the evidence of decisive\r\n    experiments. In this connection we can best characterise the\r\n    object and the result of our experiments by saying: The object\r\n    of these experiments was to test the fundamental hypotheses of\r\n    the Faraday-Maxwell theory, and the result of the experiments\r\n    is to confirm the fundamental hypotheses of the theory.”\r\n\r\nSince Maxwell’s death volumes have been written on electrical\r\nquestions, which have all been inspired by his work. The standpoint\r\nfrom which electrical theory is regarded has been entirely changed. The\r\ngreatest masters of mathematical physics have found, in the development\r\nof Maxwell’s views, a task that called for all their powers, and the\r\nharvest of new truths which has been garnered has proved most rich. But\r\nwhile this is so, the question is still often asked, What is Maxwell’s\r\ntheory? Hertz himself concludes the introduction just referred to with\r\nhis most interesting answer to this question. Prof. Boltzmann has made\r\nthe theory the subject of an important course of lectures. Poincaré,\r\nin the introduction to his “Lectures on Maxwell’s Theories and the\r\nElectro-magnetic Theory of Light,” expresses the difficulty, which many\r\nfeel, in understanding what the theory is. “The first time,” he says,\r\n“that a French reader opens Maxwell’s book a feeling of uneasiness,\r\noften even of distrust, is mingled with his admiration. It is only\r\nafter prolonged study, and at the cost of many efforts, that this\r\nfeeling is dissipated. Some great minds retain it always.” And again\r\nhe writes: “A French _savant_, one of those who have most completely\r\nfathomed Maxwell’s meaning, said to me once, ‘I understand everything\r\nin the book except what is meant by a body charged with electricity.’”\r\n\r\nIn considering this question, Poincaré’s own remark--“Maxwell does\r\nnot give a mechanical explanation of electricity and magnetism, he is\r\nonly concerned to show that such an explanation is possible”--is most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nWe cannot find in the “Electricity” an answer to the question--What is\r\nan electric charge? Maxwell did not pretend to know, and the attempt to\r\ngive too great definiteness to his views on this point is apt to lead\r\nto a misconception of what those views were.\r\n\r\nOn the old theories of action at a distance and of electric and\r\nmagnetic fluids attracting according to known laws, it was easy to be\r\nmechanical. It was only necessary to investigate the manner in which\r\nsuch fluids could distribute themselves so as to be in equilibrium,\r\nand to calculate the forces arising from the distribution. The problem\r\nof assigning such a mechanical structure to the ether as will permit\r\nof its exerting the action which occurs in an electro-magnetic field\r\nis a harder one to solve, and till it is solved the question--What is\r\nan electric charge?--must remain unanswered. Still, in order to grasp\r\nMaxwell’s theory this knowledge is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe properties of ether in dielectrics and in conductors must be quite\r\ndifferent. In a dielectric the ether has the power of storing energy by\r\nsome change in its configuration or its structure; in a conductor this\r\npower is absent, owing probably to the action of the matter of which\r\nthe conductor is composed.\r\n\r\nWhen we are said to charge an insulated conductor we really act on the\r\nether in the neighbourhood of the body so as to store it with energy;\r\nif there be another conductor in the field we cannot store energy in\r\nthe ether it contains. As, then, we pass from the outside of this\r\nconductor to its interior there is a sudden change in some mechanical\r\nquantity connected with the ether, and this change shows itself as a\r\nforce of attraction between the two conductors. Maxwell called the\r\nchange in structure, or in property, which occurs when a dielectric\r\nis thus stored with electrostatic energy, _Electric Displacement_; if\r\nwe denote it by D, then the electric force R is equal to 4πD/K, and\r\nhence the energy in a unit of volume is 2πD²/K, where K is a quantity\r\ndepending on the insulator.\r\n\r\nNow, D, the electric displacement, is a quantity which has direction\r\nas well as magnitude. Its value, therefore, at any point can be\r\nrepresented by a straight line in the usual way; inside a conductor it\r\nis zero. The total change in D, which takes place all over the surface\r\nof a conductor as we enter it from the outside measures, according\r\nto Maxwell, the total charge on the conductor. At points at which\r\nthe lines representing D enter the conductor the charge is negative;\r\nat points at which they leave it the charge is positive; along the\r\nlines of the displacement there exists throughout the ether a tension\r\nmeasured by 2πD²/K; at right angles to these lines there is a pressure\r\nof the same amount.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above the components of the displacement D must\r\nsatisfy certain relations which can only be expressed in mathematical\r\nform, the physical meaning of which it is difficult to state in\r\nnon-mathematical language.\r\n\r\nWhen these relations are so expressed the problem of finding the value\r\nof the displacement at all points of space becomes determinate, and\r\nthe forces acting on the conductors can be obtained. Moreover, the\r\ntotal change of displacement on entering or leaving a conductor can be\r\ncalculated, and this gives the quantity which is known as the total\r\nelectrical charge on the conductor. The forces obtained by the above\r\nmethod are exactly the same as those which would exist if we supposed\r\neach conductor to be charged in the ordinary sense with the quantities\r\njust found, and to attract or repel according to the ordinary laws.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we define electric displacement as that change which takes\r\nplace in a dielectric when it becomes the seat of electrostatic\r\nenergy, and if, further, we suppose that the change, whatever it\r\nbe mechanically, satisfies certain well-known laws, and that in\r\nconsequence certain pressures and tensions exist in the dielectric,\r\nelectrostatic problems can be solved without reference to a charge of\r\nelectricity residing on the conductors.\r\n\r\nSomething such as this, it appears to me, is Maxwell’s theory of\r\nelectricity as applied to electrostatics. It is not necessary, in order\r\nto understand it, to know what change in the ether constitutes electric\r\ndisplacement, or what is an electric charge, though, of course, such\r\nknowledge would render our views more definite, and would make the\r\ntheory a mechanical one.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to magnetism and electro-magnetism, Maxwell’s theory\r\ndevelops itself naturally. Experiment proves that magnetic induction is\r\nconnected with the rate of change of electric displacement, according\r\nto the laws already given. If, then, we knew the nature of the change\r\nto which the name “electric displacement” has been given, the nature\r\nof magnetic induction would be known. The difficulties in the way of\r\nany mechanical explanation are, it is true, very great; assuming,\r\nhowever, that some mechanical conception of “electric displacement”\r\nis possible, Maxwell’s theory gives a consistent account of the other\r\nphenomena of electro-magnetism.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have, it is true, an electro-magnetic theory of light, but\r\nwe do not know the nature of the change in the ether which affects\r\nour eyes with the sensation of light. Is it the same as electric\r\ndisplacement, or as magnetic induction, or since, when electric\r\ndisplacement is varying, magnetic induction always accompanies it, is\r\nthe sensation of light due to the combined effect of the two?\r\n\r\nThese questions remain unanswered. It may be that light is neither\r\nelectric displacement nor magnetic induction, but some quite different\r\nperiodic change of structure of the ether, which travels through the\r\nether at the same rate as these quantities, and obeys many of the same\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nIn this respect there is a material difference between the ordinary\r\ntheory of light and the electro-magnetic theory. The former is a\r\nmechanical theory; it starts from the assumption that the periodic\r\nchange which constitutes light is the ordinary linear displacement of a\r\nmedium--the ether--having certain mechanical properties, and from those\r\nproperties it deduces the laws of optics with more or less success.\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin, in his labile ether, has devised a medium which could\r\nexist and which has the necessary mechanical properties. The periodic\r\nlinear displacements of the labile ether would obey the laws of\r\nlight, and from the fundamental hypotheses of the theory, a mechanical\r\nexplanation, reasonably satisfactory in its main features, can be given\r\nof most purely optical phenomena. The relations between light and\r\nelectricity, or light and magnetism, are not, however, touched by this\r\ntheory; indeed, they cannot be touched without making some assumption\r\nas to what electric displacement is.\r\n\r\nIn recent years various suggestions have been made as to the nature\r\nof the change which constitutes electric displacement. One theory,\r\ndue to Von Helmholtz, supposes that the electro-kinetic momentum, or\r\nvector potential of Maxwell, is actually the momentum of the moving\r\nether; according to another, suggested, it would appear originally\r\nin a crude form by Challis, and developed within the last few months\r\nin very satisfactory detail by Larmor, the velocity of the ether is\r\nmagnetic force; others have been devised, but we are still waiting for\r\na second Newton to give us a theory of the ether which shall include\r\nthe facts of electricity and magnetism, luminous radiation, and it may\r\nbe gravitation.[71]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we believe that Maxwell has taken the first steps towards\r\nthis discovery, and has pointed out the lines along which the future\r\ndiscoverer must direct his search, and hence we claim for him a\r\nforemost place among the leaders of this century of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A full biographical account of the Clerk and Maxwell families is\r\ngiven in a note by Miss Isabella Clerk in the “Life of James Clerk\r\nMaxwell,” and from this the above brief statement has been taken.\r\n\r\n[2] “Life of J.

In 1887, the Jubilee year, as\r\nProctor--at the same time I held the office of Demonstrator--it was\r\nmy duty to accompany the Chancellor and other officers to Windsor to\r\npresent an address from the University to Her Majesty. I was introduced\r\nto the Chancellor at Paddington, and he at once began to question me\r\nclosely about the progress of the laboratory, the number of students,\r\nand the work being done there, showing himself fully acquainted with\r\nrecent progress.\r\n\r\n[40] In 1894 the list contained, in Part II., sixteen names, and in\r\nPart I., one hundred and three names.\r\n\r\n[41] Under the new regulations Physics was removed from the first part\r\nof the Tripos and formed, with the more advanced parts of Astronomy\r\nand Pure Mathematics, a part by itself, to which only the Wranglers\r\nwere admitted. Thus the number of men encouraged to read Physics was\r\nvery limited. This pernicious system was altered in the regulations\r\nat present in force, which came into action in 1892. Part I. of the\r\nMathematical Tripos now contains Heat, Elementary Hydrodynamics\r\nand Sound, and the simpler parts of Electricity and Magnetism, and\r\ncandidates for this examination do come to the laboratory, though not\r\nin very large numbers.

(_See_ “Pogg. Ann.,” Bd. 107, 1859, p. 490.)\r\n\r\n[50] The proof is as follows:--\r\n\r\nIf σ be the specific heat at constant volume, σ′ at constant pressure,\r\nand consider a unit of mass of gas at pressure p and volume v, let the\r\nvolume increase by an amount dv, while the temperature dy.\r\n\r\n  Thus σ′dT = σdT + pdv\r\n\r\n  But pv = ⅔T/m\r\n\r\n  Hence p being constant,\r\n\r\n            pdv = ⅔ dT/m\r\n  Therefore σ′ = σ + ⅔ 1/m\r\n\r\nNow suppose an amount of heat, dH, is given to a single molecule and\r\nthat its temperature is T. Its specific heat is σ, and\r\n\r\n           dH = σmdT\r\n  But      dH = βdT\r\n  Therefore β = σm\r\n\r\n  Hence 1/m = σ/β\r\n\r\n  Thus σ′ = σ(1 + 2/(3β))\r\n\r\n  And σ′/σ = γ\r\n\r\n  Therefore γ = 1 + 2/(3β)\r\n\r\n  Or β = 2/(3(γ-1))\r\n\r\n\r\n[51] Owing to an error of calculation the actual value obtained by\r\nMaxwell from these observations for the coefficient of viscosity is too\r\ngreat. More recent observers have found lower values than those given\r\nby him; the difference is thus explained.\r\n\r\n[52] Studien über das Gleichgewicht der lebendigen Kraft zwischen\r\nbewegten materiellen Punkten Sitz d. k.

Thus a molecule of steam consists of two parts of\r\nhydrogen, one of oxygen, but a given molecule of oxygen is not always\r\ncombined with the same two molecules of hydrogen; the particles are\r\ncontinually changed. In Maxwell’s paper an hypothesis of this kind is\r\nnot dealt with.\r\n\r\n[54] _Nature_, vol. 1., p. 152 (December 13th, 1894).\r\n\r\n[55] See papers by Mr. Capstick, _Phil.

Its rate of change at any\r\npoint of space measures the electromotive force at that point, so far\r\nas it is due to variations of the electric current in neighbouring\r\nconductors; the magnetic induction depends on the first differential\r\ncoefficients of the components of the electro-tonic state; the\r\nelectric current is related to their second differential coefficients\r\nin the same manner as the density of attracting matter is related\r\nto the potential it produces. In language which is now frequently\r\nused in mathematical physics, the electromotive force at a point\r\ndue to magnetic induction is proportioned to the rate of change of\r\nthe Vector Potential, the magnetic induction depends on the “curl”\r\nof the Vector Potential, while the electric current is measured by\r\nthe “concentration” of the Vector Potential. From a knowledge of the\r\nVector Potential these other quantities can be obtained by processes of\r\ndifferentiation.\r\n\r\n[62] The 4 π is introduced because of the system of units usually\r\nemployed to measure electrical quantities. If we adopted Mr. Oliver\r\nHeaviside’s “rational units,” it would disappear, as it does in (B).\r\n\r\n[63] For an exact statement as to the relation between the directions\r\nof the lines of electric displacement and of the magnetic force,\r\nreference must be made to Professor Poynting’s paper, _Phil.
