SMITH, Ph.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n  We are sure that our readers will be highly pleased to have\r\n  us give the first installment of a story by Dr. Smith. It\r\n  will continue for several numbers and is a worthy follower\r\n  of the \"Skylark\" stories which were so much appreciated by\r\n  our readers. We think that they will find this story\r\n  superior to the earlier ones. Dr. Smith certainly has the\r\n  narrative power, and that, joined with his scientific\r\n  position, makes him an ideal author for our columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrated by MOREY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  Pirates of Space\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently motionless to her passengers and crew, the Interplanetary\r\nliner _Hyperion_ bored serenely onward through space at normal\r\nacceleration. In the railed-off sanctum in one corner of the control\r\nroom a bell tinkled, a smothered whirr was heard, and Captain Bradley\r\nfrowned as he studied the brief message upon the tape of the recorder--a\r\nmessage flashed to his desk from the operator's panel. He beckoned, and\r\nthe second officer, whose watch it now was, read aloud:\r\n\r\n  \"Reports of scout patrols still negative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still negative.\" The officer scowled in thought. \"They've already\r\nsearched beyond the widest possible location of the wreckage, too. Two\r\nunexplained disappearances inside a month--first the _Dione_, then the\r\n_Rhea_--and not a plate nor a lifeboat recovered. Looks bad, sir. One\r\nmight be an accident; two might possibly be a coincidence....\" His voice\r\ndied away. What might that coincidence mean?\r\n\r\n\"But at three it would get to be a habit,\" the captain finished the\r\nthought. \"And whatever happened, happened quick. Neither of them had\r\ntime to say a word--their location recorders simply went dead. But of\r\ncourse they didn't have our detector screens nor our armament. According\r\nto the observatories we're in clear ether, but I wouldn't trust them\r\nfrom Tellus to Luna. You have given the new orders, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Detectors full out, all three courses of defensive screen on\r\nthe trips, projectors manned, suits on the hooks. Every object detected\r\nin the outer space to be investigated immediately--if vessels, they are\r\nto be warned to stay beyond extreme range. Anything entering the fourth\r\nzone is to be rayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right--we are going through!\"\r\n\r\n\"But no known type of vessel could have made away with them without\r\ndetection,\" the second officer argued. \"I wonder if there isn't\r\nsomething in those wild rumors we've been hearing lately?\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Now, systematically and precisely, the great Cone of\r\n    Battle was coming into being; a formation developed during\r\n    the Jovian Wars while the forces of the Three Planets were\r\n    fighting in space.]\r\n\r\n\"Bah! Of course not!\" snorted the captain. \"Pirates in ships faster than\r\nlight--fifth order rays--nullification of gravity--mass without\r\ninertia--ridiculous! Proved impossible, over and over again. No, sir, if\r\npirates are operating in space--and it looks very much like it--they\r\nwon't get far against a good big battery full of kilowatt-hours behind\r\nthree courses of heavy screen, and a good solid set of multiplex rays.\r\nProperly used, they're good enough for anybody. Pirates, Neptunians,\r\nangels, or devils--in ships or on sunbeams--if they tackle the\r\n_Hyperion_ we'll burn them out of the ether!\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the captain's desk, the watch officer resumed his tour of duty.\r\nThe six great lookout plates into which the alert observers peered were\r\nblank, their far-flung ultra-sensitive detector screens encountering no\r\nobstacle--the ether was empty for thousands upon thousands of\r\nkilometers. The signal lamps upon the pilot's panel were dark, its\r\nwarning bells were silent. A brilliant point of white in the center of\r\nthe pilot's closely ruled micrometer grating, exactly upon the\r\ncross-hairs of his directors, showed that the immense vessel was\r\nprecisely upon the calculated course, as laid down by the automatic\r\nintegrating course-plotters. Everything was quiet and in order.\r\n\r\n\"All's well, sir,\" he reported briefly to Captain Bradley--but all was\r\nnot well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDanger--more serious far in that it was not external--was even then, all\r\nunsuspected, gnawing at the great ship's vitals. In a locked and\r\nshielded compartment, deep down in the interior of the liner, was the\r\ngreat air purifier. Now a man leaned against the primary duct--the aorta\r\nthrough which flowed the stream of pure air supplying the entire vessel.\r\nThis man, grotesque in full panoply of space armor, leaned against the\r\nduct, and as he leaned a drill bit deeper and deeper into the steel wall\r\nof the pipe. Soon it broke through, and the slight rush of air was\r\nstopped by the insertion of a tightly fitting rubber tube. The tube\r\nterminated in a heavy rubber balloon, which surrounded a frail glass\r\nbulb. The man stood tense, one hand holding before his silica-and-steel\r\nhelmeted head a large pocket chronometer, the other lightly grasping the\r\nballoon. A sneering grin was upon his face as he awaited the exact\r\nsecond of action--the carefully pre-determined instant when his right\r\nhand, closing, would shatter the fragile flask and force its contents\r\ninto the primary air stream of the _Hyperion_!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFar above, in the main saloon, the regular evening dance was in full\r\nswing. The ship's orchestra crashed into silence, there was a patter of\r\napplause and Clio Marsden, radiant belle of the voyage, led her partner\r\nout into the promenade and up to one of the observation plates.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we can't see the earth any more!\" she exclaimed. \"Which way do you\r\nturn this, Mr. Costigan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like this,\" and Conway Costigan, burly young first officer of the\r\nliner, turned the dials. \"There--this plate is looking back, or down, at\r\nTellus; this other one is looking ahead.\"\r\n\r\nEarth was a brilliantly shining crescent far beneath the flying vessel.\r\nAbove her, ruddy Mars and silvery Jupiter blazed in splendor ineffable\r\nagainst a background of utterly indescribable blackness--a background\r\nthickly besprinkled with dimensionless points of dazzling brilliance\r\nwhich were the stars.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, isn't it wonderful!\" breathed the girl, awed. \"Of course, I suppose\r\nthat it's old stuff to you, but I--a ground-gripper, you know, and I\r\ncould look at it forever, I think. That's why I want to come out here\r\nafter every dance. You know, I ...\"\r\n\r\nHer voice broke off suddenly, with a queer, rasping catch, as she seized\r\nhis arm in a frantic clutch and as quickly went limp. He stared at her\r\nsharply, and understood instantly the message written in her eyes--eyes\r\nnow enlarged, staring hard, brilliant, and full of soul-searing terror\r\nas she slumped down, helpless but for his support. In the act of\r\nexhaling as he was, lungs almost entirely empty, yet he held his breath\r\nuntil he had seized the microphone from his belt and had snapped the\r\nlever to \"emergency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Control room!\" he gasped then, and every speaker throughout the great\r\ncruiser of the void blared out the warning as he forced his already\r\nevacuated lungs to absolute emptiness. \"Vee-Two Gas! Get tight!\"\r\n\r\nWrithing and twisting in his fierce struggle to keep his lungs from\r\ngulping in a draft of that noxious atmosphere, and with the unconscious\r\nform of the girl draped limply over his left arm, Costigan leaped toward\r\nthe portal of the nearest lifeboat. Orchestra instruments crashed to the\r\nfloor and dancing couples fell and sprawled inertly while the tortured\r\nFirst Officer swung the door of the lifeboat open and dashed across the\r\ntiny room to the air-valves. Throwing them wide open, he put his mouth\r\nto the orifice and let his laboring lungs gasp their eager fill of the\r\ncold blast roaring from the tanks. Then, air-hunger partially assuaged,\r\nhe again held his breath, broke open the emergency locker, donned one of\r\nthe space-suits always kept there, and opened its valves wide in order\r\nto flush out of his uniform any lingering trace of the lethal gas.\r\n\r\nHe then leaped back to his companion. Shutting off the air, he released\r\na stream of pure oxygen, held her face in it, and made shift to force\r\nsome of it into her lungs by compressing and releasing her chest against\r\nhis own body. Soon she drew a spasmodic breath, choking and coughing,\r\nand he again changed the gaseous stream to one of pure air, speaking\r\nurgently as she showed signs of returning consciousness. Now, it was\r\nClio Marsden's life.\r\n\r\n\"Stand up!\" he snapped. \"Hang onto this brace and keep your face in this\r\nair-stream until I get a suit around you! Got me?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded weakly, and, assured that she could now hold herself at the\r\nvalve, it was the work of only a minute to encase her in one of the\r\nprotective coverings. Then, as she sat upon a bench, recovering her\r\nstrength, he flipped on the lifeboat's visiphone projector and shot its\r\ninvisible beam up into the control room, where he saw space-armored\r\nfigures furiously busy at the panels.\r\n\r\n\"Dirty work at the cross-roads!\" he blazed to his captain, man to\r\nman--formality disregarded, as it so often was in the Triplanetary\r\nservice. \"There's skulduggery afoot somewhere in our primary air! Maybe\r\nthat's the way they got those other two ships--pirates! Might have been\r\na timed bomb--don't see how anybody could have stowed away down there\r\nthrough the inspections, and nobody but Franklin can neutralize the\r\nshield of the air-room--but I'm going to look around, anyway. Then I'll\r\njoin you fellows up there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\" the shaken girl asked. \"I think that I remember your\r\nsaying 'Vee-Two gas.' That's forbidden! Anyway, I owe you my life,\r\nConway, and I'll never forget it--never. Thanks--but the others--how\r\nabout all the rest of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was Vee-Two, and it is forbidden,\" Costigan replied grimly, eyes\r\nfast upon the flashing plate, whose point of projection was now deep in\r\nthe bowels of the vessel. \"The penalty for using it or having it is\r\ndeath on sight. Gangsters and pirates use it, since they have nothing to\r\nlose, being on the death list already. As for your life, I haven't saved\r\nit yet--you may wish I'd let it ride before we get done. The others are\r\ntoo far gone for oxygen--couldn't have brought even you around a few\r\nseconds later, quick as I got to you. But there's a sure antidote--we\r\nall carry it in a lock-box in our armor--and we all know how to use it,\r\nbecause crooks all use Vee-Two and so we're always expecting it. But\r\nsince the air will be pure again in half an hour we'll be able to revive\r\nthe others easily enough if we can get by with whatever is going to\r\nhappen next. There's the bird that did it, right in the air-room! It's\r\nthe chief engineer's suit, but that isn't Franklin that's in it. Some\r\npassenger--disguised--slugged the chief--took his suit and\r\nprojectors--hole in duct--p-s-s-t! All washed out! Maybe that's all he\r\nwas scheduled to do to us in this performance, but he'll do nothing else\r\nin this life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go down there!\" protested the girl. \"His armor is _so_ much\r\nbetter than that emergency suit you are wearing, and he's got Mr.\r\nFranklin's Lewiston, besides!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be an idiot!\" he snapped. \"We can't have a live pirate\r\naboard--we're going to be altogether too busy with outsiders directly.\r\nDon't worry, I'm not going to give him a break. I'm taking a Standish\r\nand I'll rub him out like a blot. Stay right here until I come back\r\nafter you,\" he commanded, and the heavy, vacuum insulated door of the\r\nlifeboat clanged shut behind him as he leaped out into the promenade.\r\n\r\nStraight across the saloon he made his way, paying no attention to the\r\ninert forms scattered here and there. Going up to a blank wall, he\r\nmanipulated an almost invisible dial set flush with its surface, swung a\r\nheavy door aside, and lifted out the Standish--a fearsome weapon. Squat,\r\nhuge, and heavy, it resembled somewhat an overgrown machine rifle, but\r\none possessing a thick, short telescope, with several opaque condensing\r\nlenses and parabolic reflectors. Laboring under the weight of the thing,\r\nhe strode along corridors and clambered heavily down short stairways.\r\nFinally he came to the purifier room, and grinned savagely as he saw the\r\ngreenish haze of light obscuring the door and walls--the shield was\r\nstill in place; the pirate was still inside, still flooding with the\r\nterrible Vee-Two the _Hyperion's_ primary air.\r\n\r\nHe set his peculiar weapon down, unfolded its three massive legs,\r\ncrouched down behind it and threw in a switch. Dull red beams of\r\nfrightful intensity shot from the reflectors and sparks, almost of\r\nlightning proportions, leaped from the shielding screen under their\r\nimpact. Roaring and snapping, the conflict went on for seconds; then,\r\nunder the superior force of the Standish, the greenish radiance gave\r\nway. Behind it the metal of the door ran the gamut of color--red,\r\nyellow, blinding whiter--then literally exploded; molten, vaporized,\r\nburned away. Through the aperture thus made Costigan could plainly see\r\nthe pirate in the space-armor of the chief engineer--an armor which was\r\nproof against rifle fire and which could reflect and neutralize for some\r\nlittle time even the terrific beam Costigan was employing. Nor was the\r\npirate unarmed--a vicious flare of incandescence leaped from his\r\nLewiston, to spend its force in spitting, crackling pyrotechnics against\r\nthe ether-wall of the squat and monstrous Standish. But Costigan's\r\ninfernal machine did not rely only upon vibratory destruction. At almost\r\nthe first flash of the pirate's weapon the officer touched a trigger;\r\nthere was a double report, ear-shattering in that narrowly confined\r\nspace; and the pirate's body literally flew into mist as a half-kilogram\r\nshell tore through his armor and exploded. Costigan shut off his beam,\r\nand, with not the slightest softening of one hard lineament, stared\r\naround the air-room; making sure that no serious damage had been done to\r\nthe vital machinery of the air-purifier--the very lungs of the great\r\nspace-ship.\r\n\r\nDismounting the Standish, he lugged it back up to the main saloon,\r\nreplaced it in its safe and again set the combination lock. Thence to\r\nthe lifeboat, where Clio cried out in relief as she saw that he was\r\nunhurt.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Conway, I've been so afraid something would happen to you!\" she\r\nexclaimed, as he led her rapidly upward toward the control room. \"Of\r\ncourse you....\" she paused.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he replied, laconically. \"Nothing to it. How do you feel--about\r\nback to normal?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I think, except for being scared to death and just about out\r\nof control. I don't suppose that I'll be good for anything, but whatever\r\nI can do, count me in on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine--you may be needed, at that. Everybody's out, apparently, except\r\nthose who, like me, had a warning and could hold their breath until they\r\ngot to their suits.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you know what it was? You can't see it, nor smell it, nor\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You inhaled a second before I did, and I saw your eyes. I've been in it\r\nbefore--and when you see a man get a jolt of that stuff just once, you\r\nnever forget it. The engineers down below got it first, of course--it\r\nmust have wiped them out. Then we got it in the saloon. Your passing out\r\nwarned me, and luckily I had enough breath left to give the word. Quite\r\na few of the fellows up above should have had time to get away--we'll\r\nsee 'em all in the control room.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that was why you revived me--in payment for so kindly warning\r\nyou of the gas attack?\" The girl laughed; shaky, but game.\r\n\r\n\"Something like that, probably,\" he answered, lightly. \"Here we are--now\r\nwe'll soon find out what's going to happen next.\"\r\n\r\nIn the control room they saw at least a dozen armored figures; not now\r\nrushing about, but seated at their instruments, tense and ready.\r\nFortunate it was that Costigan--veteran of space as he was, though young\r\nin years--had been down in the saloon; fortunate that he had been\r\nfamiliar with that horrible outlawed gas; fortunate that he had had the\r\npresence of mind enough and sheer physical stamina enough to send his\r\nwarning without allowing one paralyzing trace to enter his own lungs.\r\nCaptain Bradley, the men on watch, and several other officers in their\r\nquarters or in the wardrooms--space-hardened veterans all--had obeyed\r\ninstantly and without question the amplifiers' gasped command to \"get\r\ntight.\" Exhaling or inhaling, their air-passages had snapped as that\r\ndread \"Vee-Two\" was heard, and they had literally jumped into their\r\narmored suits of space--flushing them out with volume after volume of\r\nunquestionable air; holding their breath to the last possible second,\r\nuntil their straining lungs could endure no more.\r\n\r\nCostigan waved the girl to a vacant bench, cautiously changed into his\r\nown armor from the emergency suit he had been wearing, and approached\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\n\"Anything in sight, sir?\" he asked, saluting. \"They should have started\r\nsomething before this.\"\r\n\r\n\"They've started, but we can't locate them. We tried to send out a\r\ngeneral sector alarm, but that had hardly started when they blanketed\r\nour wave. Look at that!\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the captain's eyes, Costigan stared at the high powered set of\r\nthe ship's operator. Upon the plate, instead of a moving, living,\r\nthree-dimensional picture, there was a flashing glare of blinding white\r\nlight; from the speaker, instead of intelligible speech, was issuing a\r\nroaring, crackling stream of noise.\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible!\" Bradley burst out, violently. \"There's not a gram of\r\nmetal inside the fourth zone--within a hundred thousand kilometers--and\r\nyet they must be close to send such a wave as that. But the Second\r\nthinks not--what do you think, Costigan?\" The bluff commander,\r\nreactionary and of the old school as was his breed, was\r\nfurious--baffled, raging inwardly to come to grips with the invisible\r\nand undetectable foe. Face to face with the inexplicable, however, he\r\nlistened to the younger men with unusual tolerance.\r\n\r\n\"It's not only possible; it's quite evident that they've got something\r\nwe haven't.\" Costigan's voice was bitter. \"But why shouldn't they have?\r\nService ships never get anything until it's been experimented with for\r\nyears, but pirates and such always get the new stuff as soon as it's\r\ndiscovered. The only good thing I can see is that we got part of a\r\nmessage away, and the scouts can trace that interference out there. But\r\nthe pirates know that, too--it won't be long now,\" he concluded, grimly.\r\n\r\nHe spoke truly. Before another word was spoken the outer screen flared\r\nwhite under a beam of terrific power, and simultaneously there appeared\r\nupon one of the lookout plates a vivid picture of the pirate vessel--a\r\nhuge, black globe of steel, now emitting flaring offensive beams of\r\nforce. Her invisibility lost, now that she had gone into action, she lay\r\nrevealed in the middle of the first zone--at point-blank range.\r\n\r\nInstantly the powerful weapons of the _Hyperion_ were brought to bear,\r\nand in the blast of full-driven beams the stranger's screens flamed\r\nincandescent. Heavy guns, under the recoil of whose fierce salvos, the\r\nframe of the giant globe trembled and shuddered, shot out their tons of\r\nhigh-explosive shell. But the pirate commander had known accurately the\r\nstrength of the liner, and knew that her armament was impotent against\r\nthe forces at his command. His screens were invulnerable, the giant\r\nshells were exploded harmlessly in mid-space, miles from their\r\nobjective. And suddenly a frightened pencil of flame stabbed brilliantly\r\nfrom the black hulk of the enemy. Through the empty ether it tore,\r\nthrough the mighty defensive screens, through the tough metal of the\r\nouter and inner walls. Every ether-defence of the _Hyperion_ vanished,\r\nand her acceleration dropped to a quarter of its normal value.\r\n\r\n\"Right through the battery room!\" Bradley groaned. \"We're on the\r\nemergency drive now. Our rays are done for, and we can't seem to put a\r\nshell anywhere near her with our guns!\"\r\n\r\nBut ineffective as the guns were, they were silenced forever as a\r\nfrightful beam of destruction stabbed relentlessly through the control\r\nroom, whiffing out of existence the pilot, gunnery, and lookout panels\r\nand the men before them. The air rushed into space, and the suits of the\r\nthree survivors bulged out into drumhead tightness as the pressure in\r\nthe room decreased.\r\n\r\nCostigan pushed the captain lightly toward a wall, then seized the girl\r\nand leaped in the same direction.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get out of here, quick!\" he cried, the miniature radio\r\ninstruments of the helmets automatically taking up the duty of\r\ntransmitting speech as the sound disks refused to function. \"They can't\r\nsee us--our ether wall is still up and their spy-sprays can't get\r\nthrough it from the outside, you know. They're working from blue-prints,\r\nand they'll probably take your desk next,\" and even as they bounded\r\ntoward the door, now become the outer seal of an airlock, the\r\nannihilating ray tore through the space which they had just quitted in\r\ntheir flight.\r\n\r\nThrough the airlock, down through several levels of passengers' quarters\r\nthey hurried, and into a lifeboat, whose one doorway commanded the full\r\nlength of the third lounge--an ideal spot, either for defense or for\r\nescape outward by means of the miniature cruiser. As they entered their\r\nretreat they felt their weight begin to increase. More and more force\r\nwas applied to the helpless liner, until it was moving at normal\r\nacceleration.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of that, Costigan?\" asked the captain. \"Tractor\r\nbeams?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently. They've got something, all right. They're taking us\r\nsomewhere, fast. I'll go get a couple of Standishes, and another suit of\r\narmor--we'd better dig in,\" and soon the small room became a veritable\r\nfortress, housing as it did, those two formidable engines of\r\ndestruction. Then the first officer made another and longer trip,\r\nreturning with a complete suit of triplanetary space armor, exactly like\r\nthose worn by the two men, but considerably smaller.\r\n\r\n\"Just as an added factor of safety, you'd better put this on,\r\nClio--those emergency suits aren't good for much in a battle. I don't\r\nsuppose that you ever fired a Standish, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I can soon learn how to do it,\" she replied, pluckily.\r\n\r\n\"Two is all that can work here at once, but you should know how to take\r\nhold in case one of us goes out. And while you're changing suits you'd\r\nbetter put on some stuff I've got here--Service special phones and\r\ndetectors. Stick this little disk onto your chest with this bit of tape;\r\nlow down, out of sight. Just under your wishbone is the best place. Take\r\noff your wrist-watch and wear this one _continuously_--never take it off\r\nfor a second. Put on these pearls, and wear them all the time, too. Take\r\nthis capsule and hide it against your skin, some place where it can't be\r\nfound except by the most rigid search. Swallow it in an emergency--it\r\ngoes down easily and works just as well inside as outside. It is the\r\nmost important thing of all--you can get along with it alone if you lose\r\neverything else, but without that capsule the whole system's shot to\r\npieces. With that outfit, if we should get separated, you can talk to\r\nus--we're both wearing 'em, although somewhat different forms. You don't\r\nneed to talk loud--just a mutter will be enough. They're handy little\r\noutfits, almost impossible to find, and capable of a lot of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Conway--I'll remember that, too,\" Clio replied, as she turned\r\ntoward the tiny locker to follow his instructions. \"But won't the scouts\r\nand patrols be catching us pretty quick? The operator sent a warning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Afraid the ether's empty, as far as we're concerned. They could\r\nneutralize our detector screens, and the scouts' detectors are the same\r\nas ours.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Bradley had stood by in silent astonishment during this\r\nconversation. His eyes had bulged slightly at Costigan's \"we're both\r\nwearing 'em,\" but he had held his peace and as the girl disappeared a\r\nlook of dawning comprehension came over his face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see, sir,\" he said, respectfully--far more respectfully than he\r\nhad ever before addressed a mere first officer. \"Meaning that we both\r\n_will be_ wearing them shortly, I assume. 'Service Specials'--but you\r\ndidn't specify exactly _what_ Service, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I don't believe that I did,\" Costigan grinned.\r\n\r\n\"That explains several things about you--particularly your recognition\r\nof Vee-Two and your uncanny control and speed of reaction. But aren't\r\nyou....\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Costigan interrupted, positively. \"This situation is apt to get\r\naltogether too serious to overlook any bets. If we get away, I'll take\r\nthem away from her and she'll never know that they aren't routine\r\nequipment in the Triplanetary Service. As for you, I know that you can\r\nand do keep your mouth shut. That's why I'm hanging this junk on you--I\r\nhad a lot of stuff in my kit, but I flashed it all with the Standish,\r\nexcept what I brought in here for us three. Whether you think so or not,\r\nwe're in a real jam--our chance of getting away is mightly close to\r\nzero. Now that I've gone this far, I might as well tell you that I don't\r\nbelieve these birds are pirates at all, in the ordinary sense of the\r\nword. And it may be possible that they're after me, but I don't think\r\nso--we've covered up too....\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off as the girl came back, now to all appearances a small\r\nTriplanetary officer, and the three settled down to a long and eventless\r\nwait. Hour after hour they flew through the ether, but finally there was\r\na lurching swing and an abrupt increase in their acceleration. After a\r\nshort consultation Captain Bradley turned on the visiray set and, with\r\nthe beam at its minimum power, peered cautiously downward, in the\r\ndirection opposite to that in which he knew the pirate vessel must be.\r\nAll three stared into the plate, seeing only an infinity of emptiness,\r\nmarked only by the infinitely remote and coldly brilliant stars. While\r\nthey stared into space a vast area of the heavens was blotted out and\r\nthey saw, faintly illuminated by a peculiar blue luminescence, a vast\r\nball--a sphere so large and so close that they seemed to be dropping\r\ndownward toward it as though it were a world! They came to a\r\nstop--paused, weightless--a vast door slid smoothly aside--they were\r\ndrawn _upward_ through an airlock and floated quietly in the air above a\r\nsmall, but brightly-lighted and orderly city of metallic buildings!\r\nGently the _Hyperion_ was lowered, to come to rest in the embracing arms\r\nof a regulation landing cradle.\r\n\r\n\"Well, wherever it is, we're here,\" remarked Captain Bradley, grimly.\r\n\r\n\"And now the fireworks start,\" assented Costigan, with a questioning\r\nglance at the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Don't mind me,\" she answered his unspoken question. \"I don't believe in\r\nsurrendering, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" and both men squatted down behind the ether-walls of their\r\nterrific weapons; the girl prone behind them.\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait. A group of human beings--men and to all\r\nappearance Americans--appeared unarmed in the little lounge. As soon as\r\nthey were well inside the room, Bradley and Costigan released upon them\r\nwithout compunction the full power of their frightful projectors. From\r\nthe reflectors, through the doorway, there tore a concentrated double\r\nbeam of pure destruction--but that beam did not reach its goal. Yards\r\nfrom the men it met a screen of impenetrable density. Instantly the\r\ngunners pressed their triggers and a stream of high-explosive shells\r\nissued from the roaring weapons. But shells, also, were futile. They\r\nstruck the shield and vanished--vanished without exploding and without\r\nleaving a trace to show that they had ever existed.\r\n\r\nCostigan sprang to his feet, but before he could launch his intended\r\nattack a vast tunnel appeared beside him--an annihilating ray had swept\r\nthrough the entire width of the liner, cutting instantly a smooth\r\ncylinder of emptiness. Air rushed in to fill the vacuum, and the three\r\nvisitors felt themselves seized by invisible forces and drawn into the\r\ntunnel. Through it they floated, up to and over the buildings, finally\r\nslanting downward toward the door of a great high-powered structure.\r\nDoors opened before them and closed behind them, until at last they\r\nstood upright in a room which was evidently the office of a busy\r\nexecutive. They faced a desk which, in addition to the usual equipment\r\nof the business man, carried a bewilderingly complete switchboard and\r\ninstrument panel.\r\n\r\nSeated impassively at the desk there was a gray man. Not only was he\r\ndressed entirely in gray, but his heavy hair was gray, his eyes were\r\ngray, and even his tanned skin seemed to give the impression of grayness\r\nin disguise. His overwhelming personality radiated an aura of\r\ngrayness--not the gentle gray of the dove, but the resistless, driving\r\ngray of the super-dreadnaught; the hard, inflexible, brittle gray of the\r\nfracture of high-carbon steel.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Bradley, First Officer Costigan, Miss Marsden,\" the man spoke\r\nquietly, but crisply. \"I had not intended you two men to live so long.\r\nThat is a detail, however, which we will pass by for the moment. You may\r\nremove your suits.\"\r\n\r\nNeither officer moved, but both stared back at the speaker\r\nunflinchingly.\r\n\r\n\"I am not accustomed to repeating instructions,\" the man at the desk\r\ncontinued; voice still low and level, but instinct with deadly menace.\r\n\"You may choose between removing those suits and dying in them, here and\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nCostigan moved over to Clio and slowly took off her armor. Then, after a\r\nflashing exchange of glances and a muttered word, the two officers threw\r\noff their suits simultaneously and fired at the same instant; Bradley\r\nwith his Lewiston, Costigan with a heavy automatic pistol whose bullets\r\nwere explosive shells of tremendous power. But the man in gray,\r\nsurrounded by an impenetrable wall of force, only smiled at the\r\nfusillade, tolerantly and maddeningly. Costigan leaped fiercely, only to\r\nbe hurled backward as he struck that unyielding, invisible wall. A\r\nvicious beam snapped him back into place, the weapons were snatched\r\naway, and all three captives were held in their former positions.\r\n\r\n\"I permitted that, as a demonstration of futility,\" the gray man said,\r\nhis hard voice becoming harder, \"but I will permit no more foolishness.\r\nNow I will introduce myself. I am known as Roger. You probably have\r\nheard nothing of me yet but you will--if you live. Whether or not you\r\ntwo live depends solely upon yourselves. Being something of a student of\r\nmen, I fear that you will both die shortly. Able and resourceful as you\r\nhave just shown yourselves to be, you could be valuable to me, but you\r\nprobably will not--in which case you shall, of course, cease to exist.\r\nThat, however, in its proper time--you shall be of some slight service\r\nto me in the process of being eliminated. In your case, Miss Marsden, I\r\nfind myself undecided between two courses of action; each highly\r\ndesirable, but unfortunately mutually exclusive. Your father will be\r\nglad to ransom you at an exceedingly high figure, but, in spite of that\r\nfact, I may decide to keep you for--well, let us say for certain\r\npurposes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" Clio rose magnificently to the occasion. Fear forgotten, her\r\ncourageous spirit flashed from her clear, young eyes and emanated from\r\nher slender, rounded young body, erect in defiance. \"Since I am a\r\ncaptive, you can of course do anything you please with me up to a\r\ncertain point--but no further, believe me!\"\r\n\r\nWith no sign of having heard her outburst Roger pressed a button and a\r\ntall, comely woman, appeared--a woman of indefinite age and of uncertain\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\n\"Show Miss Marsden to her apartment,\" he directed, and as the two women\r\nwent out a man came in.\r\n\r\n\"The cargo is unloaded, sir,\" the newcomer reported. \"The two men and\r\nthe five women indicated have been taken to the hospital,\" was the\r\nreport of the man.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, dispose of the others in the usual fashion.\" The minion went\r\nout, and Roger continued, emotionlessly:\r\n\r\n\"Collectively, the other passengers may be worth a million or so, but it\r\nwould not be worth while to waste time upon them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you, anyway?\" blazed Costigan, helpless but enraged beyond\r\ncaution. \"I have heard of mad scientists who tried to destroy the earth,\r\nand of equally mad geniuses who thought themselves Napoleons capable of\r\nconquering even the Solar System. Whichever you are, you should know\r\nthat you can't get away with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am neither. I am, however, a scientist, and I direct many other\r\nscientists. I am not mad. You have undoubtedly noticed several peculiar\r\nfeatures of this place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, particularly the artificial gravity, which has always been\r\nconsidered impossible, and those screens. An ordinary ether-wall is\r\nopaque in one direction, and doesn't bar matter--yours are transparent\r\nboth ways and something more than impenetrable to matter. How do you do\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"You could not understand them if I explained them to you, and they are\r\nmerely two of our smaller developments. I have no serious designs upon\r\nthe earth nor upon the Solar System, nor have I any desire to rule over,\r\nor to control the destinies of masses of futile and brainless men. I\r\nhave, however, certain ends of my own in view. To accomplish my plans I\r\nrequire hundreds of millions in gold, other hundreds of millions in\r\nplatinum and noble metal, and some five kilograms of the bromide of\r\nradium--all of which I shall take from the planets of this Solar System\r\nbefore I leave it. I shall take them in spite of the puerile efforts of\r\nthe fleets of your Triplanetary League.\r\n\r\n\"This structure, floating in a planetary orbit, was designed by me and\r\nbuilt under my direction. It is protected from meteorites by certain\r\nforces of my devising. It is undetectable and invisible--your detectors\r\ndo not touch it and light-waves are bent around it without loss or\r\ndistortion. I am discussing these points at such length so that you may\r\nrealize exactly your position. As I have intimated, you can be of\r\nassistance to me if you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now just what could you offer any _man_ to make him join your outfit?\"\r\ndemanded Costigan, venomously.\r\n\r\n\"Many things.\" Roger's cold tone betrayed no emotion, no recognition of\r\nCostigan's open and bitter contempt. \"I have under me many men, bound to\r\nme by many ties. Needs, wants, longings and desires differ from man to\r\nman, and I can satisfy practically any of them. Personally, I take\r\ndelight in the society of young and beautiful women, and many men have\r\nthat same taste; but there are other urges which I have found quite\r\nefficient. Greed, thirst for fame, longing for power, and so on,\r\nincluding many qualities usually regarded as 'noble.' And what I\r\npromise, I deliver. I demand only loyalty to me, and that only in\r\ncertain things and for a relatively short period. In all else, my men do\r\nas they please. In conclusion, I can use you two conveniently, but I do\r\nnot need you. Therefore you may choose now between my service and--the\r\nalternative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly what is the alternative?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not go into that. Suffice it to say that it has to do with a\r\nminor research, which is not progressing satisfactorily. It will result\r\nin your extinction, and perhaps I should mention that that extinction\r\nwill not be particularly pleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say NO, you....\" Bradley roared. He intended to give an unexpurgated\r\nclassification, but was rudely interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on a minute!\" snapped Costigan. \"How about Miss Marsden?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has nothing to do with this discussion,\" returned Roger, icily. \"I\r\ndo not bargain--in fact, I believe that I shall keep her for a time. She\r\nhas it in mind to destroy herself, if I do not allow her to be ransomed,\r\nbut she will find that door closed to her until I permit it to open.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, I string along with the Chief--take what he started to\r\nsay about you and run it clear across the board for me!\" barked\r\nCostigan.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. That decision was to be expected from men of your type.\" The\r\ngray man touched two buttons and two of his creatures entered the room.\r\n\"Put these men into separate cells on the second level,\" he ordered.\r\n\"Search them to the skin: all their weapons may not have been in their\r\narmor. Seal the doors and mount special guards, tuned to me here.\"\r\n\r\nImprisoned they were, and carefully searched; but they bore no arms, and\r\nnothing had been said or thought of communicators. Even if such\r\ninstruments could be concealed, Roger would detect their use instantly.\r\nAt least, so would have run his thought had the subject entered his\r\nmind. But even Roger had no inkling of the possibility of Costigan's\r\n\"Service Special\" phones, detectors and spy-ray--instruments of minute\r\nsize and of infinitesimal power, but yet instruments which, working as\r\nthey were, below the level of the ether, were effective at great\r\ndistances and caused no vibrations in the ether by which their use could\r\nbe detected. And what could be more innocent than the regulation,\r\npersonal equipment of every officer of space? The heavy goggles, the\r\nwrist-watch and its supplementary pocket chronometer, the flash-lamp,\r\nthe automatic lighter, the sender, the money-belt?\r\n\r\nAll these items of equipment were examined with due care; but the\r\ncleverest minds of Triplanetary's Secret Service had designated those\r\ncommunicators to pass any ordinary search, however careful, and when\r\nCostigan and Bradley were finally locked into the designated cells, they\r\nstill possessed their ultra-instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  In Roger's Planetoid\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hall Clio glanced around her wildly, her bosom heaving, eyes\r\ndarting here and there, seeking even the narrowest avenue of escape.\r\nBefore she could act, however, her body was clamped inflexibly, as\r\nthough in a vise, and she struggled, motionless.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless to attempt to escape, or to do anything except what Roger\r\nwishes,\" the guide informed her somberly, snapping off the instrument in\r\nher hand and thus restoring to the thoroughly cowed girl her freedom of\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\"His lightest wish is law,\" she continued as they walked down a long\r\ncorridor. \"The sooner you realize that you must do exactly as he\r\npleases, in all things, the easier your life will be.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I wouldn't _want_ to keep on living!\" Clio declared, with a flash\r\nof spirit. \"And I can _always_ die, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find that you cannot,\" the passionless creature returned,\r\nmonotonously. \"If you do not yield, you will long and pray for death,\r\nbut you will not die unless Roger wills it. I was like you once. I also\r\nstruggled, and I became what I am now--whatever it is. Here is your\r\napartment. You will stay here until Roger gives further orders\r\nconcerning you.\"\r\n\r\nThe living automaton opened a door and stood silent and impassive, while\r\nClio, staring at her in unutterable horror, shrank past her and into the\r\nsumptuously furnished suite. The door closed soundlessly and utter\r\nsilence descended as a pall. Not an ordinary silence, but the\r\nindescribable perfection of the absolute, complete absence of all sound.\r\nIn that silence Clio stood motionless. Tense and rigid, hopeless,\r\ndespairing, she stood there in that magnificent room, fighting an almost\r\noverwhelming impulse to scream. Suddenly she heard the cold voice of\r\nRoger, speaking from the empty air.\r\n\r\n\"You are over-wrought, Miss Marsden. You can be of no use to yourself or\r\nto me in that condition. I command you to rest; and, to insure that\r\nrest, you may pull that cord, which will establish about this room an\r\nether wall: a wall cutting off even this my voice....\"\r\n\r\nThe voice ceased as she pulled the cord savagely and threw herself upon\r\na divan in a torrent of gasping, strangling, but rebellious sobs. Then\r\nagain came a voice, but not to her ears. Deep within her, pervading\r\nevery bone and muscle, it made itself felt rather than heard.\r\n\r\n\"Clio?\" it asked. \"Don't talk yet....\"\r\n\r\n\"Conway!\" she gasped in relief, every fiber of her being thrilled into\r\nnew hope at the deep, well-remembered voice of Conway Costigan.\r\n\r\n\"Keep still!\" he snapped. \"Don't act so happy! He may have a spy-ray on\r\nyou. He can't hear me, but he may be able to hear you. When he was\r\ntalking to you you must have noticed a sort of rough, sandpapery feeling\r\nunder that necklace I gave you? Since he's got an ether-wall around you\r\nthe beads are dead now. If you feel anything like that under the\r\nwrist-watch, breathe deeply, twice. If you don't feel anything there,\r\nit's safe for you to talk, as loud as you please.\r\n\r\n\"I don't feel a thing, Conway!\" she rejoiced. Tears forgotten, she was\r\nher old, buoyant self again. \"So that wall _is_ real, after all? I only\r\nabout half believed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't trust it too much, because he can cut it off from the outside any\r\ntime he wants to. Remember what I told you: that necklace will warn you\r\nof any spy-ray in the ether, and the watch will detect anything below\r\nthe level of the ether. It's dead now, of course, since our three phones\r\nare direct-connected; I'm in touch with Bradley, too. Don't be too\r\nscared; we've got a lot better chance that I thought we had.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? You don't mean it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. I'm beginning to think that maybe we've got something he\r\ndoesn't know exists--our ultra-wave. Of course I wasn't surprised when\r\nhis searchers failed to find our instruments, but it never occurred to\r\nme that I might have a clear field to use them in! I can't quite believe\r\nit yet, but I haven't been able to find any indication that he can even\r\ndetect the bands we are using. I'm going to look around over there with\r\nmy spy-ray ... I'm looking at you now--feel it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the watch feels that way, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine! Not a sign of interference over here, either. I can't find a\r\ntrace of ultra-wave--anything below ether-level, you know--anywhere in\r\nthe whole place. He's got so much stuff that we've never heard of that I\r\nsupposed of course he'd have ultra-wave, too; but if he hasn't, that\r\ngives us the edge. Well, Bradley and I've got a lot of work to do....\r\nWait a minute, I just had a thought. I'll be back in about a second.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a brief pause, then the soundless, but clear voice went on:\r\n\r\n\"Good hunting! That woman that gave you the blue willies isn't\r\nalive--she's full of the prettiest machinery and communicators you ever\r\nsaw!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Conway!\" and the girl's voice broke in an engulfing wave of\r\nthanksgiving and relief. \"It was so unutterably horrible, thinking of\r\nwhat must have happened to her and to others like her!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's running a colossal bluff, I think. He's good, all right, but he\r\nlacks quite a lot of being omnipotent. But don't get too cocky, either.\r\nPlenty has happened to plenty of women here, and men too--and plenty may\r\nhappen to us unless we put out a few jets. Keep a stiff upper lip, and\r\nif you want us, yell. 'Bye!\"\r\n\r\nThe silent voice ceased, the watch upon Clio's wrist again became an\r\nunobtrusive timepiece, and Costigan, in his solitary cell far below her\r\ntower room, turned his peculiarly goggled eyes toward other scenes. In\r\nhis pockets his hands manipulated tiny controls, and through the lenses\r\nof those goggles Costigan's keen and highly-trained eyes studied every\r\nconcealed detail of mechanism of the great globe, the while he planned\r\nwhat must be done. Finally, he took off the goggles and spoke in a low\r\nvoice to Bradley, confined in another windowless room across the hall.\r\n\r\n\"I think I've got dope enough, Captain. I've found out where he put our\r\narmor and guns, and I've located all the main leads, controls, and\r\ngenerators. There are no ether-walls around us here, but every door is\r\nshielded, and there are guards outside our doors--one to each of us.\r\nThey're robots, not men. That makes it harder, since they're undoubtedly\r\nconnected direct to Roger's desk, and will give an alarm at the first\r\nhint of abnormal performance. We can't do a thing until he leaves his\r\ndesk. See that black panel, a little below the cord-switch to the right\r\nof your door? That's the conduit cover. When I give you the word, tear\r\nthat off and you'll see one red wire in the cable. It feeds the\r\nshield-generator of your door. Break that wire and join me out in the\r\nhall. Sorry I had only one of these ultra-wave spies, but once we're\r\ntogether it won't be so bad. Here's what I thought we could do,\" and he\r\nwent over in detail the only course of action which his surveys had\r\nshown to be possible.\r\n\r\n\"There, he's left his desk!\" Costigan exclaimed after the conversation\r\nhad continued for almost an hour. \"Now as soon as we find out where he's\r\ngoing, we'll start something ... he's going to see Clio, the swine! This\r\nchanges things, Bradley!\" His hard voice was a curse.\r\n\r\n\"Somewhat!\" blazed the captain. \"I know how you two have been getting on\r\nall during the cruise. I'm with you, but what can we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll do something,\" Costigan declared grimly. \"If he makes a pass at\r\nher I'll get him if I have to blow this whole sphere out of space, with\r\nus in it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do that, Conway.\" Clio's low voice, trembling but determined, was\r\nfelt by both men and both gasped audibly: they had forgotten that there\r\nwere three instruments in the circuit. \"If there's a chance for you to\r\nget away and do anything about fighting him, don't mind me. Maybe he\r\nonly wants to talk about the ransom, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't talk ransom to _you_--he's going to talk something else\r\nentirely,\" Costigan gritted; then his voice changed suddenly. \"But say,\r\nmaybe it's just as well this way. They didn't find our specials when\r\nthey searched us, you know, and we're going to do plenty of damage right\r\nsoon now. Roger probably isn't a fast worker--more the cat-and-mouse\r\ntype, I'd say--and after we get started he'll have something on his mind\r\nbesides you. Think you can stall him off and keep him interested for\r\nabout fifteen minutes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I can--I'll do _anything_ to help us, or you, get away from\r\nthis horrible....\" Her voice ceased as Roger broke the ether-wall of her\r\napartment and walked toward the divan upon which she crouched in\r\nwide-eyed, helpless, trembling terror.\r\n\r\n\"Get ready, Bradley!\" Costigan directed tersely. \"He's left Clio's\r\nether-wall off, so that any abnormal signals would be relayed to him\r\nfrom his desk--he knows that there's no chance of anyone disturbing him\r\nin _that_ room. But I'm holding my beam on that switch--it's as good a\r\nconductor as metal--so that the wall is on, full strength. No matter\r\nwhat we do now, he can't get a warning. I'll have to hold the beam\r\nexactly on the switch, though, so you'll have to do the dirty work. Tear\r\nout that red wire and kill those two guards. You know how to kill a\r\nrobot, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--break his eye-lenses and his eardrums and he'll stop whatever he's\r\ndoing and send out distress calls.... Got 'em both. Now what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Open my door--the shield switch is to the right.\"\r\n\r\nCostigan's door flew open and the Triplanetary captain leaped into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Now for our armor!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet!\" snapped Costigan. He was standing rigid, goggled eyes staring\r\nimmovably at a spot upon the ceiling. \"I can't move a millimeter until\r\nyou've closed Clio's ether-wall switch. If I take this ray off it for a\r\nsecond we're sunk. Five floors up, straight ahead down a\r\ncorridor--fourth door on right. When you're at the switch you'll feel my\r\nray on your watch. Snap it up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" and the captain leaped away at a pace to be equaled by few men\r\nof half his years.\r\n\r\nSoon he was back, and after Costigan had tested the ether-wall of the\r\n\"bridal suite\" to make sure that no warning signal from his desk or his\r\nservants could reach Roger within it, the two officers hurried away\r\ntoward the room in which their discarded space-armor had been stored.\r\n\r\n\"Too bad they don't wear uniforms,\" panted Bradley, short of breath from\r\nthe many flights of stairs. \"Might have helped some as disguise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it--with so many robots around, they've probably got signals\r\nthat we couldn't understand, anyway. If we meet anybody it'll mean a\r\nbattle. Hold it!\" Peering through walls with his spy-ray, Costigan had\r\nseen two men approaching, blocking an intersecting corridor into which\r\nthey must turn. \"Two of 'em, a man and a robot--the robot's on your\r\nside. We'll wait here, right at the corner--when they round it, take\r\n'em!\" And Costigan put away his goggles in readiness for strife.\r\n\r\nAll unsuspecting, the two pirates came into view, and as they appeared\r\nthe two officers struck. Costigan, on the inside, drove a short, hard\r\nright low into the human pirate's abdomen. The fiercely driven fist sank\r\nto the wrist into the soft tissues and the stricken man collapsed. But\r\neven as the blow landed, Costigan had seen that there was a third enemy,\r\nfollowing close behind the two he had been watching, a pirate who was\r\neven then training a ray projector upon him. Reacting automatically,\r\nCostigan swung his unconscious opponent around in front of him, so that\r\nit was into that insensible body that the vicious ray tore, and not into\r\nhis own. Crouching down into the smallest possible compass, he\r\nstraightened his powerful body with the lashing force of a mighty steel\r\nspring, hurling the corpse straight at the flaming mouth of the\r\nprojector. The weapon crashed to the floor and dead pirate and living\r\nwent down in a heap. Upon that heap Costigan hurled himself, feeling for\r\nthe enemy's throat. But the pirate had wriggled clear, and countered\r\nwith a gouging thrust that would have torn out the eyes of a slower man,\r\nfollowing it up instantly with a savage kick for the groin. No automaton\r\nthis, geared and set to perform certain fixed duties with mechanical\r\nprecision, but a lithe, strong man in hard training, fighting with every\r\nfoul trick known to his murderous ilk.\r\n\r\nBut Costigan was no tyro in the art of dirty fighting. Few indeed are\r\nthe maiming tricks of foul combat unknown to even the rank and file of\r\nthe highly efficient Secret Service of the Triplanetary League; and\r\nCostigan, a Sector Chief of that unknown organization, knew them all.\r\nNot for pleasure, sportsmanship, nor million-dollar purses do those\r\nsecret agents use Nature's weapons. They come to grips only when it\r\ncannot possibly be avoided, but when they are forced to fight in that\r\nfashion they go into it with but one grim purpose--to kill, and to kill\r\nin the shortest possible space of time. Thus it was that Costigan's\r\nopening soon came. The pirate launched a particularly vicious kick, the\r\ndreaded \"coup de sabot,\" which Costigan avoided by a lightning shift. It\r\nwas a slight shift, barely enough to make the kicker miss, and two\r\npowerful hands closed upon that flying foot in midair like the sprung\r\njaws of a bear-trap. Closed and twisted viciously, in the same fleeting\r\ninstant. There was a shriek, smothered as a heavy boot crashed to its\r\ncarefully pre-determined mark: the pirate was out, definitely and\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\nThe struggle had lasted scarcely ten seconds, coming to its close just\r\nas Bradley finished blinding and deafening the robot. Costigan picked up\r\nthe projector, again donned his spy-ray goggles, and the two hurried on.\r\n\r\n\"Nice work, Chief--it must be a gift to rough-house the way you do,\"\r\nBradley exclaimed. \"That's why you took the live one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Practice helps some, too! I've been in brawls before, and I'm a lot\r\nyounger and maybe some faster than you are,\" Costigan explained briefly,\r\npenetrant gaze rigidly to the fore as they ran along one corridor after\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSeveral more guards, both living and mechanical, were encountered on the\r\nway, but they were not permitted to offer any opposition. Costigan saw\r\nthem first. In the furious beam of the projector of the dead pirate they\r\nwere riven into nothingness, and the two officers sped on to the room\r\nwhich Costigan had located from afar. The three suits of Triplanetary\r\nspace armor had been sealed into a cabinet whose doors Costigan\r\nliterally blew off with a blast of force, rather than consume time in\r\ntracing the power leads.\r\n\r\n\"I feel like something now!\" Costigan, once more encased in his own\r\narmor, heaved a great sigh of relief. \"Rough-and-tumble's all right with\r\none or two, but that generator room is full of grief, and we won't have\r\nany too much stuff as it is. We've got to take Clio's suit along--we'll\r\ncarry it down to the door of the power room, drop it there, and pick it\r\nup after we've wrecked the works.\"\r\n\r\nContemptuous now of possible guards, the armored pair strode toward the\r\nroom which housed the pulsating heart of the immense fortress of space.\r\nGuards were encountered, and captains--officers who signaled frantically\r\nto their chief, since he alone could unleash the frightful forces at his\r\ncommand, and who profanely wondered at his unwonted silence--but the\r\nenemy beams were impotent against the mighty ether-walls of that armor;\r\nand the pirates, without armor in the security of their own planet as\r\nthey were, vanished utterly in the ravening beams of the twin Lewistons.\r\nAs they paused before the door of the power room, both men felt Clio's\r\nvoice raised in her first and last appeal, an appeal wrung from her\r\nagainst her will by the extremity of her position.\r\n\r\n\"Conway! Hurry! Oh, hurry! I can't last much longer--good-bye, dear!\" In\r\nthe horror-filled tones both men read clearly the girl's dire extremity.\r\nEach saw plainly a happy, care-free young earth girl, upon her first\r\ntrip into space, locked inside an ether-wall with an over-brained,\r\nunder-conscienced human machine--a super-intelligent but lecherous and\r\nunmoral mechanism of flesh and blood, acknowledging no authority, ruled\r\nby nothing save his own scientific drivings and the almost equally\r\npowerful urges of his desires and passions! She had fought with every\r\nresource at her command. She had wept and pleaded, she had stormed and\r\nraged, she had feigned submission and had played for time--and her\r\ntorment had not touched in the slightest degree the merciless and\r\ngloating brain of the being who called himself Roger. Now his\r\ntantalizing, ruthless cat-play was done, the horrible gray-brown face\r\nwas close to hers--she wailed her final despairing message to Costigan\r\nand attacked that hideous face with the fury of a tigress.\r\n\r\nCostigan bit off a bitter imprecation. \"Hold him just a second longer,\r\nsweetheart!\" he cried, and the power room door vanished.\r\n\r\nThrough the great room the two Lewistons swept at full aperture and at\r\nmaximum power, two rapidly opening fans of death and destruction. Here\r\nand there a guard, more rapid than his fellows, trained a futile\r\nprojector--a projector whose magazine exploded at the touch of that\r\nfrightful field of force, liberating instantaneously its thousands upon\r\nthousands of kilowatt-hours of stored-up energy. Through the delicately\r\nadjusted, complex mechanisms the destroying beams tore. At their touch\r\narmatures burned out, high-tension leads volatilized in crashing,\r\nhigh-voltage sparks, masses of metal smoked and burned in the path of\r\nvast forces now seeking the easiest path to neutralization, delicate\r\ninstruments blew up, copper ran in streams like water. As the last\r\nmachine subsided into a semi-molten mass of metal the two wreckers, each\r\ngrasping a brace, felt themselves become weightless and knew that they\r\nhad accomplished the first part of their program.\r\n\r\nCostigan leaped for the outer door. His the task to go to Clio's aid....\r\nBradley would follow more slowly, bringing the girl's armor and taking\r\ncare of any possible pursuit. As he sailed through the air he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Coming, Clio! All right, girl?\" Questioningly, half fearfully.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Conway.\" Her voice was almost unrecognizable, broken in\r\nretching agony. \"When everything went crazy he ... found out that the\r\nether-wall was up ... forgot all about me. He shut it off ... and seemed\r\nto go crazy, too ... he is floundering around like a wild man now....\r\nI'm trying to keep ... him from ... going down-stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good girl--keep him busy one minute more--he's getting all the warnings\r\nat once and wants to get back to his board. But what's the matter with\r\nyou? Did he ... hurt you, after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; not that. But I'm sick--horribly sick. I'm falling.... I'm so\r\ndizzy I can scarcely see ... my head is breaking up into little pieces\r\n... I just _know_ I'm going to die, Conway! Oh ... oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is _that_ all!\" In his sheer relief that they had been in time,\r\nCostigan did not think of sympathizing with Clio's very real present\r\ndistress of mind and body. \"I forgot that you're a\r\nground-gripper--that's just a little touch of space-sickness. It'll wear\r\noff directly.... All right, I'm coming! Let go of him and get as far\r\naway from him as you can!\"\r\n\r\nHe was now in the street. Perhaps two hundred feet distant and a hundred\r\nfeet above him was the tower room in which were Clio and Roger. He\r\nsprang directly toward its large window, and as he floated \"upward\" he\r\ncorrected his course and accelerated his pace by firing backward at\r\nvarious angles with his heavy service pistol, uncaring that at the point\r\nof impact of each of those shells a small blast of destruction erupted.\r\nHe missed the window a trifle, but that did not matter--his flaming\r\nLewiston opened a way for him, partly through the window, partly through\r\nthe wall. As he soared through the opening he trained projector and\r\npistol upon Roger, now almost to the door, noticing as he did so that\r\nClio was clinging convulsively to a lamp-bracket upon the wall. Door and\r\nwall vanished in the Lewiston's terrific beam, but the pirate stood\r\nunharmed. Neither ravening ray nor explosive shell could harm him--he\r\nhad snapped on the protective shield whose generator was always upon his\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nBut Roger, while not exactly a ground-gripper, did not know how to\r\nhandle himself without weight; whereas Costigan, given six walls against\r\nwhich to push, was even more efficient in weightless combat than when\r\nhandicapped by the force of gravitation. Keeping his projector upon the\r\npirate, he seized the first club to hand--a long, slender pedestal of\r\nmetal--and launched himself past the pirate chief. With all the momentum\r\nof his mass and velocity and all the power of his mighty right arm he\r\nswung the bar at the pirate's head. That fiercely driven mass of metal\r\nshould have taken Roger's head from his shoulders, but it did not. That\r\nshield of force was utterly rigid and impenetrable; the only effect of\r\nthe frightful blow was to set him spinning, end over end, like the\r\nflying baton of an acrobatic drum-major. As the spinning form crashed\r\nagainst the opposite wall of the room, Bradley floated in, carrying\r\nClio's armor. Without a word the captain loosened the helpless girl's\r\ngrip upon the bracket and encased her in the suit. Then, supporting her\r\nat the window, he held his Lewiston upon the captive's head while\r\nCostigan propelled him toward the opening. Both men knew that Roger's\r\nshield of force must be threatened every instant--that if he were\r\nallowed to release it he probably would bring to bear a hand-weapon even\r\nsuperior to their own.\r\n\r\nBraced against the wall, Costigan sighted along Roger's body toward the\r\nmost distant point of the lofty dome of the artificial planet and gave\r\nhim a gentle push. Then, each grasping Clio by an arm, the two officers\r\nshoved mightily with their feet and the three armored forms darted away\r\ntoward their only hope of escape--an emergency boat which could be\r\nlaunched through the shell of the great globe. To attempt to reach the\r\n_Hyperion_ and to escape in one of her lifeboats would have been\r\nuseless; they could not have forced the great gates of the main\r\nair-locks and no other exits existed. As they sailed onward through the\r\nair, Costigan keeping the slowly-floating form of Roger enveloped in his\r\nbeam, Clio began to recover.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they get their gravity fixed?\" she asked, apprehensively. \"And\r\nthey're raying us and shooting at us!\"\r\n\r\n\"They may have fixed it already. They undoubtedly have spare parts and\r\nduplicate generators, but if they turn it on the fall will kill Roger\r\ntoo, and he wouldn't like that. They'll have to get him down with an\r\nairship, and they know that we'll get them as fast as they come up. They\r\ncan't hurt us with hand-weapons, and before they can bring up any heavy\r\nstuff they'll be afraid to use it, because we'll be too close to their\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could have brought Roger along,\" he continued, savagely, to\r\nBradley. \"But you were right, of course--it'd be altogether too much\r\nlike a rabbit capturing a wildcat. My Lewiston's about done right now,\r\nand there can't be much left of yours--what he'd do to us would be a sin\r\nand a shame.\"\r\n\r\nNow at the great wall, the two men heaved mightily upon a lever, the\r\ngate of the emergency port swung slowly open, and they entered the\r\nminiature cruiser of the void. Costigan, familiar with the mechanism of\r\nthe craft from careful study from his prison cell, manipulated the\r\ncontrols. Through gate after massive gate they went, until finally they\r\nwere out in open space, shooting toward distant Tellus at the maximum\r\nacceleration of which their small craft was capable.\r\n\r\nCostigan cut the other two phones out of circuit and spoke, his\r\nattention fixed upon some extremely distant point.\r\n\r\n\"Samms!\" he called, sharply. \"Costigan. We're out ... all right ... yes\r\n... sure ... absolutely ... you tell 'em, Sammy; I've got company here.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the sound-disks of their helmets the girl and the captain had\r\nheard Costigan's share of the conversation. Bradley stared at his\r\nerstwhile first officer in amazement, and even Clio had often heard that\r\nmighty, half-mythical name. Surely that bewildering young man must rank\r\nhigh, to speak so familiarly to Virgil Samms, the all-powerful head of\r\nthe space-pervading Secret Service of the Triplanetary League!\r\n\r\n\"You've turned in a general call-out,\" Bradley stated, rather than\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Long ago--I've been in touch right along,\" Costigan answered. \"Now that\r\nthey know what to look for and know that ether-wave detectors are\r\nuseless, they can find it. Every vessel in seven sectors, clear down to\r\nthe scout patrols, is concentrating on this point, and the call is out\r\nfor all battleships and cruisers afloat. There are enough operatives out\r\nthere with ultra-waves to locate that globe, and once they spot it\r\nthey'll point it out to all the other vessels.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about the other prisoners?\" asked the girl. \"They'll all be\r\nkilled, won't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hard telling,\" Costigan shrugged. \"Depends on how things turn out. We\r\nlack a lot of being safe ourselves yet, and it's my personal opinion\r\nthat there's going to be a real war.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's worrying me mostly is our own chance,\" Bradley assented. \"They\r\nwill chase us, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, and they'll have more speed than we have. Depends on how far away\r\nthe nearest Triplanetary vessels are. Anyway, we've done everything we\r\ncan do--it's in the laps of the gods now.\"\r\n\r\nSilence fell, and Costigan cut in Clio's phone and came over to the seat\r\nupon which she was reclining, white and stricken--worn out by the\r\nhorrible and terrifying ordeals of the last few hours. As he seated\r\nhimself beside her she blushed vividly, but her deep blue eyes met his\r\ngray ones steadily.\r\n\r\n\"Clio, I ... we ... you ... that is,\" he flushed hotly and stopped. This\r\nsecret agent, whose clear, keen brain no physical danger could cloud;\r\nwho had proved over and over again that he was never at a loss in any\r\nemergency, however desperate--this quick-witted officer floundered in\r\nembarrassment like any schoolboy, but continued, doggedly: \"I'm afraid\r\nthat I gave myself away back there, but....\"\r\n\r\n\"We gave ourselves away, you mean,\" she filled in the pause. \"I did my\r\nshare, but I won't hold you to it if you don't want--but I _know_ that\r\nyou love me, Conway!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Love_ you!\" The man groaned, his face lined and hard, his whole body\r\nrigid. \"That doesn't half tell it, Clio. You don't need to hold me--I'm\r\nheld for life. There never was a woman who meant anything to me before,\r\nand there never will be another. You're the only woman that ever\r\nexisted. It isn't that. Can't you see that it's impossible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I can't--it isn't impossible, at all.\" She released her\r\nfinger shields, four hands met and tightly clasped; and her low voice\r\nthrilled with feeling as she went on: \"You love me and I love you. That\r\nis all that matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it were,\" Costigan returned bitterly, \"but you don't know what\r\nyou'd be letting yourself in for. It's who and what you are and who and\r\nwhat I am that's eating me. You, Clio Marsden, Curtis Marsden's\r\ndaughter. Nineteen years old. You think you've been places and done\r\nthings. You haven't. You haven't seen or done anything--you don't know\r\nwhat it's all about. And who am I to love a girl like you? A homeless\r\nspace-flea who hasn't been on any planet three weeks in three years. A\r\nhard-boiled egg. A trouble-shooter and a brawler by instinct and\r\ntraining. A sp....\" He bit off the word and went on quickly: \"Why, you\r\ndon't know me at all, and there's a lot of me that you never _will_\r\nknow--that I can't let you know! You'd better lay off me, girl, while\r\nyou can. It'll be best for you, believe me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't Conway, and neither can you,\" the girl answered softly, a\r\nglorious light in her eyes. \"It's too late for that. On the ship it was\r\njust another of those things, but since then we've come really to know\r\neach other, and we're sunk. The situation is out of control, and we both\r\nknow it--and neither of us would change it if we could, and you know\r\nthat, too. I don't know very much, I admit, but I do know what you\r\nthought you'd have to keep from me, and I admire you all the more for\r\nit. We all honor the Service, Conway dearest--it is only you men who\r\nhave made and are keeping the Three Planets fit places to live in--and I\r\nknow that Virgil Samms' chief lieutenant would have to be a man in four\r\nthousand million....\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think that?\" he demanded sharply.\r\n\r\n\"You told me so yourself, indirectly. Who else in the known Universe\r\ncould possibly call him 'Sammy'? You are hard, of course, but you must\r\nbe so--and I never did like soft men, anyway. And you brawl in a good\r\ncause. You are very much a _man_, my Conway; a real, _real_ man, and I\r\nlove you! Now, if they catch us, all right--we'll die together, at\r\nleast!\" she finished, passionately.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, sweetheart, of course,\" he admitted. \"I don't believe\r\nthat I _could_ really let you let me go, even though I know you ought\r\nto,\" and their hands locked together even more firmly than before. \"If\r\nwe ever get out of this jam I'm going to kiss you, but this is no time\r\nto be taking off your helmet. In fact, I'm taking too many chances with\r\nyou in keeping your finger shields off. Snap 'em on, Clio mine; the\r\npirates ought to be getting fairly close by this time.\"\r\n\r\nHands released and armor again tight, Costigan went over to join Bradley\r\nat the control board.\r\n\r\n\"How're they coming, Captain?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not so good. Quite a ways off yet. At least an hour, I'd say, before a\r\ncruiser can get within range.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see if I can locate any of the pirates chasing up. If I do, it'll\r\nbe by accident; this little spy-ray isn't good for much except close\r\nwork. I'm afraid the first warning we'll have will be when they take\r\nhold of us with a beam or spear us with a ray. Probably a beam, though;\r\nthis is one of their emergency lifeboats and they wouldn't want to\r\ndestroy it unless they have to. Also, I imagine that Roger wants us\r\nalive pretty badly. He has unfinished business with all three of us, and\r\nI can well believe that his 'not particularly pleasant extinction' will\r\nbe even less so after the way we rooked him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to do me a favor, Conway.\" Clio's face was white with horror\r\nat the thought of facing again that unspeakable creature of gray. \"Give\r\nme a gun or something, please. I don't want him to touch me again while\r\nI'm alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"He won't,\" Costigan assured her, narrow of eye and grim of jaw. He was,\r\nas she had said, hard. \"But you don't want a gun. You might get nervous\r\nand use it too soon. I'll take care of you at the last possible moment,\r\nbecause if he gets hold of us we won't stand a chance of getting away\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nFor minutes there was silence, Costigan surveying the ether in all\r\ndirections with his ultra-wave device. Suddenly he laughed, deeply and\r\nwith real enjoyment, and the others stared at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not crazy,\" he told them. \"This is really funny; it had never\r\noccurred to me that all these pirate ships are invisible to any ether\r\nwave as long as they're using power. I can see them, of course, with\r\nthis sub-ether spy, but they can't see us! I knew that they should have\r\novertaken us before this. I've finally found them. They've passed us,\r\nand are now tacking around, waiting for us to cut off our power for a\r\nminute so that they can see us! They're heading right into the\r\nFleet--they think they're safe, of course, but what a surprise they've\r\ngot coming to them!\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not only the pirates who were to be surprised. Long before\r\nthe pirate ship had come within extreme visibility range of the\r\nTriplanetary Fleet, it lost its invisibility and was starkly outlined\r\nupon the lookout plates of the three fugitives. For a few seconds the\r\npirate craft seemed unchanged, then it began to glow redly, with a red\r\nthat seemed to become darker as it grew stronger. Then the sharp\r\noutlines blurred, puffs of air burst outward, and the metal of the hull\r\nbecame a viscous, fluid-like something, flowing away in a long, red\r\nstreamer into seemingly empty space. Costigan turned his ultra-gaze into\r\nthat space and saw that it was actually far from empty. There lay a vast\r\nsomething, formless and indefinite even to his sub-ethereal vision; a\r\nsomething into which the viscid stream of transformed metal plunged.\r\nPlunged, and vanished.\r\n\r\nPowerful interference blanketed his ultra-wave and howled throughout his\r\nbody; but in the hope that some part of his message might get through he\r\ncalled Samms, and calmly and clearly he narrated everything that had\r\njust happened. He continued his crisp report, neglecting not the\r\nsmallest detail, while their tiny craft was drawn inexorably toward a\r\nredly impermeable veil; continued it until their lifeboat, still intact,\r\nshot through that veil and he found himself unable to move. He was\r\nconscious, he was breathing normally, his heart was beating; but not a\r\nvoluntary muscle would obey his will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  Fleet Against Planetoid\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the newest and fleetest of the Law Enforcement Vessels of the\r\nTriplanetary League, the heavy cruiser _Chicago_, of the North American\r\nDivision of the Tellurian Contingent, plunged stolidly through\r\ninterplanetary vacuum. For five long weeks she had patrolled her\r\nallotted volume of space. In another week she would report back to the\r\ncity whose name she bore, where her space-weary crew, worn by their long\r\n\"trick\" in the awesomely oppressive depths of the limitless void, would\r\nenjoy to the full their fortnight of refreshing planetary leave.\r\n\r\nShe was performing certain routine tasks--charting meteorites, watching\r\nfor derelicts and other obstructions to navigation, checking in\r\nconstantly with all scheduled space-ships in case of need, and so\r\non--but primarily she was a warship. She was a mighty engine of\r\ndestruction, hunting for the unauthorized vessels of whatever power or\r\nplanet it was, that had not only defied the Triplanetary League, but\r\nwere evidently attempting to overthrow it; attempting to plunge the\r\nThree Planets back into the ghastly sink of bloodshed and destruction\r\nfrom which they had so recently emerged. Every space-ship within range\r\nof her powerful detectors was represented by two brilliant, slowly\r\nmoving points of light; one upon a great micrometer screen, the other in\r\nthe \"tank\"--the immense, three-dimensional, minutely cubed model of the\r\nentire Solar System.\r\n\r\nA brilliantly intense red light flared upon a panel and a bell clanged\r\nbrazenly the furious signals of the sector alarm. Simultaneously a\r\nspeaker roared forth its message of a ship in dire peril.\r\n\r\n\"Sector alarm! N. A. T. _Hyperion_ gassed with Vee-Two. Nothing\r\ndetectable in space, but....\"\r\n\r\nThe half-uttered message was drowned out in a crackling roar of\r\nmeaningless noise, the orderly signals of the bell became a hideous\r\nclamor, and the two points of light which had marked the location of the\r\nliner disappeared in widely spreading flashes of the same high-powered\r\ninterference. Observers, navigators, and control officers were alike\r\ndumfounded. Even the captain, in the shell-proof, shock-proof, and\r\ndoubly ray-proof retreat of his conning compartment, was equally at a\r\nloss. No ship or thing could _possibly_ be close enough to be sending\r\nout interfering waves of such tremendous power--yet there they were!\r\n\r\n\"Maximum acceleration, straight for the point where the _Hyperion_ was\r\nwhen her tracers went out,\" the captain ordered, and through the fringe\r\nof that widespread interference he drove a solid beam, reporting\r\nconcisely to G. H. Q. Almost instantly the emergency call-out came\r\nroaring in--every vessel of the Sector, of whatever class or tonnage,\r\nwas to concentrate upon the point in space where the ill-fated liner had\r\nlast been known to be.\r\n\r\nHour after hour the great globe drove on at maximum acceleration,\r\ncaptain and every control officer alert and at high tension. But in the\r\nQuartermaster's Department, deep down below the generator rooms, no\r\nthought was given to such minor matters as the disappearance of a\r\n_Hyperion_. The inventory did not balance, and two Q. M. privates were\r\ntrying, profanely, and without much success, to find the discrepancy.\r\n\r\n\"Charged cells for model DF Lewistons, none requisitioned, on hand\r\neighteen thous....\" The droning voice broke off short in the middle of a\r\nword and the private stood rigid, in the act of reaching for another\r\nslip, every faculty concentrated upon something, imperceptible to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Cleve--snap it up!\" the second commanded, but was silenced by\r\na vicious wave of the listener's hand.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" the rigid one exclaimed. \"Reveal ourselves! Why, it's ... Oh,\r\nall right.... Oh, that's it.... Uh-huh.... I see.... Yes, I've got it\r\nsolid. Maybe I'll see you again some time. If not, so long!\"\r\n\r\nThe inventory sheets fell unheeded from his hand, and his fellow private\r\nstared after him in amazement as he strode over to the desk of the\r\nofficer in charge. That officer also stared as the hitherto easy-going\r\nand gold-bricking Cleve saluted briskly, showed him something flat in\r\nthe palm of his left hand, and spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I've just got some of the funniest orders ever put out,\r\nLieutenant\"--his voice was low and intense--\"but they came from 'way,\r\n'way up. I'm to join the brass hats in the Center. You'll know about it\r\ndirectly, I imagine. Cover me up as much as you can, will you?\" And he\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nUnchallenged he made his way to the control room, and his curt \"urgent\r\nreport for the Captain\" admitted him there without question. But when he\r\napproached the sacred precincts of the Captain's own and inviolate room,\r\nhe was stopped in no uncertain fashion by no less a personage than the\r\nOfficer of the Day.\r\n\r\n\" ... and report yourself under arrest immediately!\" the O. D. concluded\r\nhis brief but pointed speech.\r\n\r\n\"You were right in stopping me, of course,\" the intruder conceded,\r\nunmoved. \"I wanted to get in there without giving everything away, if\r\npossible, but it seems that I can't. Well, I've been ordered by Virgil\r\nSamms to report to the Captain, at once. See this? Touch it!\" He held\r\nout a flat, insulated disk, cover thrown back to reveal a tiny golden\r\nmeteor, at the sight of which the officer's truculent manner altered\r\nmarkedly.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard of them, of course, but I never saw one before,\" and the\r\nofficer touched the shining symbol lightly with his finger, jerking\r\nbackward involuntarily as there shot through his whole body a thrilling\r\nsurge of power, shouting into his very bones an unpronounceable\r\nsyllable--the password of the Secret Service. \"Genuine or not, it gets\r\nyou to the Captain. He'll know, and if it's a fake you'll be breathing\r\nspace in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nProjector at the ready, the Officer of the Day followed Cleve into the\r\nHoly of Holies. There the grizzled four-striper touched the golden\r\nmeteor lightly, then drove his piercing gaze deep into the unflinching\r\neyes of the younger man. But that captain had won his high rank neither\r\nby accident nor by \"pull\"--he understood at once.\r\n\r\n\"It _must_ be an emergency,\" he growled, half-audibly, still staring at\r\nhis lowly Q. M. clerk, \"to make Samms uncover his whole organization.\"\r\nHe turned and curtly dismissed the wondering O. D. Then: \"All right! Out\r\nwith it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Serious enough so that every one of us afloat has just received orders\r\nto reveal himself to his commanding officer and to anyone else, if\r\nnecessary to reach that officer at once--orders never before issued. The\r\nenemy have been located. They have built a base, and have ships better\r\nthan our best. Base and ships cannot be seen nor detected by any ether\r\nwave. However, the Service has been experimenting for years with a new\r\ntype of communicator beam; and, while pretty crude yet, it was given to\r\nus when the _Dione_ went out without leaving a trace. One of our men was\r\nin the _Hyperion_, managed to stay alive, and has been sending data. I\r\nam instructed to attach my new phone set to one of the universal plates\r\nin your conning room, and to see what I can find.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to it!\" The captain waved his hand and the operative bent to his\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\"Commanders of all vessels of the Fleet!\" The Headquarters speaker,\r\nreceiver sealed upon the wave-length of the Admiral of the Fleet, broke\r\nthe long silence. \"All vessels, in sectors L to R, inclusive, will\r\ninterlock location signals. Some of you have received, or will receive\r\nshortly, certain communications from sources which need not be\r\nmentioned. Those commanders will at once send out red K4 screens.\r\nVessels so marked will act as temporary flagships. Unmarked vessels will\r\nproceed at maximum to the nearest flagship, grouping about it in\r\nregulation squadron cone in order of arrival. Squadrons most distant\r\nfrom objective point designated by flagship observers will proceed\r\ntoward it at maximum; squadrons nearest it will decelerate or reverse\r\nvelocity--that point must not be approached until full Fleet formation\r\nhas been accomplished. Heavy and Light Cruisers of all other sectors\r\ninside the orbit of Mars ...\" the orders went on, directing the\r\nmobilization of the stupendous forces of the League, so that they would\r\nbe in readiness in the highly improbable event of the failure of the\r\nmassed power of seven sectors to reduce the pirate base.\r\n\r\nIn those seven sectors perhaps a dozen vessels threw out enormous\r\nspherical screens of intense red light, and as they did so their tracer\r\npoints upon all the interlocked lookout plates also became ringed about\r\nwith red. Toward those crimson markers the pilots of the unmarked\r\nvessels directed their courses at their utmost power; and while the\r\nwhite lights upon the lookout plates moved slowly toward and clustered\r\nabout the red ones--the ultra-instruments of the Secret Service\r\noperatives were probing into space, sweeping the neighborhood of the\r\ncomputed position of the pirate's stronghold.\r\n\r\nBut the object sought was so far away that the small spy-ray sets of the\r\nSecret Service men, intended as they were for close-range work, were\r\nunable to make contact with the invisible planetoid for which they were\r\nseeking. In the captain's sanctum of the _Chicago_, the operative\r\nstudied his plate for only a minute or two, then shut off his power and\r\nfell into a brown study, from which he was rudely aroused.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you even going to _try_ to find them?\" demanded the captain.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Cleve returned shortly. \"No use--not half enough power or control.\r\nI'm trying to think ... maybe ... say, Captain, will you please have the\r\nChief Electrician and a couple of radio men come in here?\"\r\n\r\nThey came, and for hours, while the other ultra-wave men searched the\r\napparently empty ether with their ineffective beams, the three technical\r\nexperts and the erstwhile Quartermaster's clerk labored upon a huge and\r\ncomplex ultra-wave projector--the three blindly and with doubtful\r\nquestions; the one with sure knowledge at least of what he was trying to\r\ndo. Finally the thing was done, the crude but efficient graduated\r\ncircles were set, and the tubes glowed redly as their solidly massed\r\noutput was driving into a tight beam of ultra-vibration. \"There it is,\r\nsir,\" Cleve reported, after some ten minutes of delicate manipulation,\r\nand the vast structure of the miniature world flashed into being upon\r\nhis plate. \"You may notify the fleet--co-ordinates H 11.62, RA\r\n124-31-16, and Dx about 173.2.\"\r\n\r\nThe report made and the assistants out of the room, the captain turned\r\nto the observer and saluted gravely.\r\n\r\n\"We have always known, sir, that the Service had _men_; but I had no\r\nidea that any one man could possibly do, on the spur of the moment, what\r\nyou have just done--unless that man happened to be Lyman Cleveland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it doesn't ...\" the observer began, but broke off, muttering\r\nunintelligibly at intervals; then swung the visiray beam toward the\r\nearth. Soon a face appeared upon the plate, the keen but careworn face\r\nof Virgil Samms!\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Lyman.\" His voice came clearly from the speaker, and the Captain\r\ngasped--his ultra-wave observer and sometime clerk was Lyman Cleveland\r\nhimself, probably the greatest living expert in beam transmission! \"I\r\nknew that you'd do something, if it could be done. How about it--can the\r\nothers install similar sets on their ships? I'm betting that they\r\ncan't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably not,\" Cleveland frowned in thought. \"This is a patchwork\r\naffair, made of gunny-sacks and hay-wire. I'm holding it together by\r\nmain strength and awkwardness, and even at that it's apt to go to pieces\r\nany minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you rig it up for photography?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. Just a minute--yes, I can. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because there's something going on out there that neither we nor the\r\nso-called pirates know anything about. The Admiralty seems to think that\r\nit's the Jovians again, but we don't see how it can be--if it is, they\r\nhave developed a lot of stuff that none of our agents has even\r\nsuspected,\" and he recounted briefly what Costigan had reported to him,\r\nconcluding: \"Then there was a burst of interference--on the\r\n_ultra-band_, mind you--and I've heard nothing from him since. Therefore\r\nI want you to stay out of the battle entirely. Stay as far away from it\r\nas you can and still get good pictures of everything that happens. I\r\nwill see that orders are issued to the _Chicago_ to that effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"But listen ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are orders!\" snapped Samms. \"It is of the utmost importance that\r\nwe know every detail of what is going to happen. The answer is pictures.\r\nThe only possibility of obtaining pictures is that machine you have just\r\ndeveloped. If the fleet wins, nothing will be lost. If the fleet\r\nloses--and I am not half as confident of success as the Admiral is--the\r\n_Chicago_ doesn't carry enough power to decide the issue, and we will\r\nhave the pictures to study, which is all-important. Besides, we've\r\nprobably lost Conway Costigan to-day, and we don't want to lose _you_,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland remained silent, pondering this startling news, but the\r\ngrizzled Captain, veteran of the Fourth Jovian War that he was, was not\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\n\"We'll blow them out of space, Mr. Samms!\" he declared.\r\n\r\n\"You just think you will, Captain. I have suggested, as forcibly as\r\npossible, that the general attack be withheld until after a thorough\r\ninvestigation is made, but the Admiralty will not listen. They see the\r\nadvisability of withdrawing a camera ship, but that is as far as they\r\nwill go.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's plenty far enough!\" growled the _Chicago's_ commander, as\r\nthe beam snapped off. \"Mr. Cleveland, I don't like the idea of running\r\naway under fire, and I won't do it without direct orders from the\r\nAdmiral.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you won't--that's why you are going....\"\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a voice from the Headquarters speaker. The captain\r\nstepped up to the plate and, upon being recognized, he received the\r\nexact orders which had been requested by the Chief of the Secret\r\nService--now not as secret as it had been heretofore.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the _Chicago_ reversed her acceleration, cut off her\r\nred screen, and fell rapidly behind, while the vessels following her in\r\ntheir loose cone formation shot away toward another crimson-flaring\r\nleader. Farther and farther back she dropped, back to the limiting range\r\nof the ultra-cameras upon which Cleveland and his highly trained\r\nassistants were furiously and unremittingly at work. And during all this\r\ntime the forces of the seven sectors had been concentrating. The pilot\r\nvessels, with their flaming red screens, each followed by a cone of\r\nspace-ships, drew closer and closer together, approaching the\r\n_Fearless_--the British super-dreadnaught which was to be the flagship\r\nof the Fleet--the mightiest and heaviest space-ship which had yet lifted\r\nher stupendous mass into the ether.\r\n\r\nNow, systematically and precisely, the great Cone of Battle was coming\r\ninto being; a formation developed during the Jovian Wars while the\r\nforces of the Three Planets were fighting in space for their very\r\ncivilizations' existence, and one never used since the last space-fleets\r\nof Jupiter's murderous hordes had been wiped out.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of that enormous hollow cone was a ring of scout patrols, the\r\nsmallest and most agile vessels of the fleet. Behind them came a\r\nsomewhat smaller ring of light cruisers, then rings of heavy cruisers\r\nand of light battleships, and finally of heavy battleships. At the apex\r\nof the cone, protected by all the other vessels of the formation and in\r\nbest position to direct the battle, was the flagship. In this formation\r\nevery vessel was free to use her every weapon, with a minimum of danger\r\nto her sister ships; and yet, when the gigantic main projectors were\r\noperated along the axis of the formation, from the entire vast circle of\r\nthe cone's mouth there flamed a cylindrical field of force of such\r\nintolerable intensity that in it no conceivable substance could endure\r\nfor a moment!\r\n\r\nThe artificial planet of metal was now close enough so that it was\r\nvisible to the ultra-vision of the Secret Service men, so plainly\r\nvisible that the warships of the pirates were seen issuing from the\r\nenormous air-locks. As each vessel shot out into space it sped straight\r\nfor the approaching fleet without waiting to go into any formation--gray\r\nRoger believed his structures invisible to Triplanetary eyes, thought\r\nthat the presence of the fleet was the result of mathematical\r\ncalculations, and was convinced that his mighty vessels of the void\r\nwould destroy even that vast fleet without themselves becoming known. He\r\nwas wrong. The foremost globes were allowed actually to enter the mouth\r\nof that conical trap before an offensive move was made. Then the\r\nvice-admiral in command of the fleet touched a button, and\r\nsimultaneously every generator in every Triplanetary vessel burst into\r\nfurious activity. Instantly the hollow volume of the immense cone became\r\na coruscating hell of resistless energy, an inferno which, with the\r\nvelocity of light, extended itself into a far-reaching cylinder of\r\nrapacious destruction. Ether-waves they were, it is true, but vibrations\r\ndriven with such fierce intensity that the screens of deflection\r\nsurrounding the pirate vessels could not handle even a fraction of their\r\nawful power. Invisibility lost, their defensive screens flared briefly;\r\nbut even the enormous force backing Roger's inventions, greater far than\r\nthat of any single Triplanetary vessel, could not hold off the\r\nincredible violence of the massed attack of the hundreds of mighty\r\nvessels composing the Fleet. Their defensive screens flared briefly,\r\nthen went down; their great spherical hulls first glowing red, then\r\nshining white, then in a brief moment exploding into flying masses of\r\nred hot, molten, and gaseous metal.\r\n\r\nA full two-thirds of Roger's force was caught in that raging,\r\nincandescent beam; caught and obliterated: but the remainder did not\r\nretreat to the planetoid. Darting out around the edge of the cone at a\r\nstupendous acceleration, they attacked its flanks and the engagement\r\nbecame general. But now, since enough beams were kept upon each ship of\r\nthe enemy so that invisibility could not be restored, each Triplanetary\r\nwar vessel could attack with full efficiency. Magnesium flares and\r\nstar-shells illuminated space for a thousand miles, and from every unit\r\nof both fleets was being hurled every item of solid, explosive, and\r\nvibratory destruction known to the highly scientific warfare of that\r\nage. Offensive beams, rods and daggers of frightful power struck and\r\nwere neutralized by defensive screens equally capable; the long range\r\nand furious dodging made ordinary solid or high-explosive projectiles\r\nuseless; and both sides were filling all space with such a volume of\r\nblanketing frequencies that such radio-dirigible torpedoes as were\r\nlaunched could not be controlled, but darted madly and erratically\r\nhither and thither, finally to be exploded harmlessly in mid-space by\r\nthe touch of some fiercely insistent, probing beam of force.\r\n\r\nIndividually, however, the pirate vessels were far more powerful than\r\nthose of the fleet, and that superiority soon began to make itself felt.\r\nThe power of the smaller ships began to fail as their accumulators\r\nbecame discharged under the awful drain of the battle, and vessel after\r\nvessel of the Triplanetary fleet was hurled into nothingness by the\r\nconcentrated blasts of the pirates' rays. But the Triplanetary forces\r\nhad one great advantage. In furious haste the Secret Service men had\r\nbeen altering the controls of the radio-dirigible torpedoes, so that\r\nthey would respond to ultra-wave control; and, few in number though they\r\nwere, each was highly effective.\r\n\r\nA hard-eyed observer, face almost against his plate and both hands and\r\nboth feet manipulating controls, hurled the first torpedo. Propelling\r\nrockets viciously aflame, it twisted and looped around the incandescent\r\nrods of destruction so thickly and starkly outlined, under perfect\r\ncontrol; unaffected by the hideous distortion of all ether-borne\r\nsignals. Through a pirate screen it went, and under the terrific blast\r\nof its detonation one entire panel of the stricken battleship vanished,\r\ncrumpled and broken. It should have been out, cold--but, to the\r\namazement of the observers, it kept on fighting with scarcely lessened\r\npower! Three more of the frightful space-bombs had to be exploded in\r\nit--it had to be reduced to junk--before its terrible rays went out; Not\r\na man in that great fleet had even an inkling of the truth; that those\r\ngreat vessels, those terrible engines of destruction, did not contain a\r\nsingle living creature: that they were manned and fought by automatons;\r\nrobots controlled by keen-eyed, space-hardened veterans inside the\r\nplanetoid so distant by means of tight, interference-proof communicator\r\nbeams!\r\n\r\nBut they were to receive an inkling of it. As ship after ship of the\r\npirate fleet was blown to pieces, Roger realized that his navy was\r\nbeaten, and forthwith all his surviving vessels darted toward the apex\r\nof the cone, where the heaviest battleships were stationed. There each\r\nhurled itself upon a Triplanetary warship, crashing to its own\r\ndestruction, but in that destruction insuring the loss of one of the\r\nheaviest vessels of the enemy. Thus passed the _Fearless_, and twenty of\r\nthe finest space-ships of the fleet as well. But the ranking officer\r\nassumed command, the war-cone was re-formed, and, yawning maw to the\r\nfore, the great formation shot toward the pirate stronghold, now near at\r\nhand. It again launched its stupendous cylinder of annihilation, but\r\neven as the mighty defensive screens of the planetoid flared into\r\nincandescently furious defense, the battle was interrupted and pirates\r\nand Triplanetarians learned alike that they were not alone in the ether.\r\n\r\nSpace became suffused with a redly impenetrable opacity, and through\r\nthat indescribable pall there came reaching huge arms of force\r\nincredible; writhing, coruscating beams of power which glowed a baleful,\r\nalthough almost imperceptible, red. A vessel of unheard-of armament and\r\npower, hailing from a distant solar system of the Galaxy, had come to\r\nrest in that space. For months her commander had been investigating sun\r\nafter sun in quest of one precious substance. Now his detectors had\r\nfound it; and, feeling neither fear of Triplanetarian weapons nor\r\nreluctance to sacrifice those thousands of Triplanetarian lives, he was\r\nabout to take it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  Within the Red Veil\r\n\r\n\r\nNevia, the home planet of the marauding space-ship, would have appeared\r\npeculiar indeed to Terrestrial senses. High in the deep red heavens a\r\nfervent blue sun poured down its flood of brilliant purplish light upon\r\na world of water. Not a cloud was to be seen in that flaming sky, and\r\nthrough that dustless atmosphere the eye could see the horizon--a\r\nhorizon three times as distant as the one to which we are\r\naccustomed--with a distinctness and clarity impossible in our Terra's\r\ndust-filled air. As that mighty sun dropped below the horizon the sky\r\nwould fill suddenly with clouds and rain would fall violently and\r\nsteadily until midnight. Then the clouds would vanish as suddenly as\r\nthey had come into being, the torrential downpour would cease, and,\r\nthrough that huge world's wonderfully transparent, gaseous envelope, the\r\nfull glory of the firmament would be revealed. Not the firmament as we\r\nknow it--for that hot blue sun and Nevia, her one planet-child, were\r\nmany light-years distant from Old Sol and his numerous brood--but a\r\nstrange and glorious firmament containing not one constellation familiar\r\nto earthly eyes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Many bridges and more tubes extended through the air\r\n    from building to building, and the watery \"streets\" teemed\r\n    with surface craft, and with submarines.]\r\n\r\nOut of the vacuum of space a fish-shaped vessel of the void--the vessel\r\nthat was shortly to attack so boldly both the massed fleet of\r\nTriplanetary and Roger's planetoid--plunged into the rarefied outer\r\natmosphere, and crimson beams of force tore shriekingly the thin air as\r\nit braked its terrific speed. A third of the circumference of Nevia's\r\nmighty globe was traversed before the velocity of the craft could be\r\nreduced sufficiently to make a landing possible. Then, approaching the\r\ntwilight zone, the vessel dived vertically downward, and it became\r\nevident that Nevia was neither entirely aqueous nor devoid of\r\nintelligent life. For the blunt nose of the space-ship was pointing\r\ntoward what was evidently a half-submerged city, a city whose buildings\r\nwere flat-topped, hexagonal towers, exactly alike in size, shape, color,\r\nand material. These buildings were arranged as the cells of a honeycomb\r\nwould be if each cell were separated from its neighbors by a relatively\r\nnarrow channel of water, and all were built of the same white metal.\r\nMany bridges and more tubes extended through the air from building to\r\nbuilding, and the watery \"streets\" teemed with surface craft, and with\r\nsubmarines.\r\n\r\nThe pilot, stationed immediately below the conical prow of the\r\nspace-ship, peered intently through the thick windows of crystal-clear\r\nmetal which afforded unobstructed vision in every direction except\r\nvertically upward and behind him. His four huge and contractile eyes\r\nwere active, each operating independently in sending its own message to\r\nhis peculiar but capable brain. One was watching the instruments, the\r\nothers scanned narrowly the immense, swelling curve of the ship's belly,\r\nthe water upon which his vessel was to land, and the floating dock to\r\nwhich it was to be moored. Four hands--if hands they could be\r\ncalled--manipulated levers and wheels with infinite delicacy of touch,\r\nand with scarcely a splash the immense mass of the Nevian sky-wanderer\r\nstruck the water and glided to a stop within a foot of its exact berth.\r\n\r\nFour mooring bars dropped neatly into their sockets and the\r\ncaptain-pilot, after locking his controls in neutral, released his\r\nsafety straps and leaped lightly from his padded bench to the floor.\r\nScuttling across the floor and down a runway upon his four short,\r\npowerful, heavily scaled legs, he slipped smoothly into the water and\r\nflashed away, far below the surface. For Nevians are true amphibians.\r\nTheir blood is cold; they use with equal comfort and efficiency gills\r\nand lungs for breathing; their scaly bodies are equally at home in the\r\nwater or in the air; their broad, flat feet serve equally well for\r\nrunning about upon a solid surface or for driving their stream-lined\r\nbodies through the water at a pace few of our fishes can equal.\r\n\r\nThrough the water the Nevian commander darted along, steering his course\r\naccurately by means of his short, vaned tail. Through an opening in a\r\nwall he sped and along a submarine hallway, emerging upon a broad ramp.\r\nHe scurried up the incline and into an elevator which lifted him to the\r\ntop floor of the hexagon, directly into the office of the Secretary of\r\nCommerce of all Nevia.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, Captain Nerado!\" The Secretary waved a tentacular arm and the\r\nvisitor sprang lightly upon a softly cushioned bench, where he lay at\r\nease, facing the official across his low, flat \"desk.\" \"We congratulate\r\nyou upon the success of your final trial flight. We received all your\r\nreports, even while you were traveling with many times the velocity of\r\nlight. With the last difficulties overcome, you are now ready to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are ready,\" the captain-scientist replied, soberly. \"Mechanically,\r\nthe ship is as nearly perfect as our finest minds can make her. She is\r\nstocked for two years. All the iron-bearing suns within reach have been\r\nplotted. Everything is ready except the iron. Of course the Council\r\nrefused to allow us any of the national supply--how much were you able\r\nto purchase for us in the market?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly ten pounds....\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten pounds! Why, the securities we left with you could not have bought\r\ntwo pounds, even at the price then prevailing!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but you have friends. Many of us believe in you, and have dipped\r\ninto our own resources. You and your fellow scientists of the expedition\r\nhave each contributed his entire personal fortune; why should not some\r\nof the rest of us also contribute, as private citizens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful--we thank you. Ten pounds!\" The captain's great triangular\r\neyes glowed with an intense violet light. \"A full year of cruising. But\r\n... what if, after all, we should be wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case you shall have consumed ten pounds of irreplaceable\r\nmetal.\" The Secretary was unmoved. \"That is the viewpoint of the Council\r\nand of almost everyone else. It is not the waste of treasure they object\r\nto; it is the fact that ten pounds of iron will be forever lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"A high price truly,\" the Columbus of Nevia assented, \"And after all, I\r\nmay be wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"You probably are--of course you are wrong,\" his host made a startling\r\nanswer. \"It is practically certain--it is almost a demonstrable\r\nmathematical fact--that no other sun within hundreds of thousands of\r\nlight-years of our own has a planet. In all probability Nevia is the\r\nonly planet in the entire Universe. We are the only intelligent life in\r\nthe Universe. But there is one chance in numberless millions that,\r\nsomewhere with the cruising range of your newly perfected space-ship,\r\nthere may be an iron-bearing planet upon which you can effect a landing,\r\nand it is upon that infinitesimal chance that some of us are staking a\r\nportion of our wealth. We expect no return whatever, but if you _should_\r\nby some miracle happen to find stores of iron somewhere in space, what\r\nthen? Deep seas being made shallow, civilization extending itself over\r\nthe globe, science advancing by leaps and bounds, Nevia becoming\r\npopulated as she should be peopled--that, my friend, is a chance well\r\nworth taking!\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary called in a group of guards, who escorted the small\r\npackage of priceless metal to the space-ship, and before the massive\r\ndoor was sealed the friends bade each other farewell.\r\n\r\n\" ... I will keep in touch with you on the ultra-wave,\" the Captain\r\nconcluded. \"After all, I do not blame the Council for refusing to allow\r\nthe other ship to go with us. Ten pounds of iron will be a fearful loss\r\nto the world. If we _should_ find iron, however, see to it that the\r\nother vessel loses no time in following us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that! If you find iron all space will be full of vessels, as\r\nsoon as they can possibly be built--good-bye!\"\r\n\r\nThe last opening was sealed and Nerado shot the great vessel into the\r\nair. Up and up, out beyond the last tenuous trace of atmosphere, on and\r\non through space it flew with ever-increasing velocity until Nevia's\r\ngigantic blue sun had been left so far behind that it became a splendid\r\nblue-white star. Then, projectors cut off to save the precious iron\r\nwhose disintegration furnished them power, for week after week Captain\r\nNerado and his venturesome crew of scientists drifted idly through the\r\nillimitable void. Sun after sun, as visible in their ultra-instruments\r\nas though the flying vessel were moving slower than light, they studied\r\nwithout finding a single planet.\r\n\r\nThree months passed. Nerado had already applied the slight power which\r\nwas to swing the vessel around in an immense circle, back toward his\r\nnative world. In that course he was rapidly approaching a sun, an\r\nordinary G-type dwarf, whose spectrum revealed a blaze of lines of the\r\nprecious element for which he was searching. Now at close observing\r\nrange--he had long since abandoned his former eager habit of studying a\r\nsun as soon as it showed the tiniest perceptible disk in his most\r\npowerful telescope--he turned on his powerful visiray beam without\r\nenthusiasm, swung it upon that very commonplace sun, and shrieked aloud\r\nin exultation. Not only one planet had that yellowish luminary--it had\r\nsix, seven, eight; yes, possibly nine or ten; and several of those\r\nplanets were themselves apparently centers of attraction around which\r\nwere circling other tiny worlds! Nerado thrilled with joy as he applied\r\na full retarding force, and every creature aboard that great vessel had\r\nto peer into a plate or through a telescope, before he could believe\r\nthat planets other than Nevia did in reality exist!\r\n\r\nVelocity checked to the merest crawl, as space-speed goes, and with\r\nelectro-magnetic detector screens full out, the Nevian vessel crept\r\ntoward our sun. Finally the detectors encountered an obstacle, a\r\nconductive substance which the patterns showed conclusively to be\r\npractically pure iron. Iron--an enormous mass of it--floating alone out\r\nin space! Without waiting to investigate the nature, appearance, or\r\nstructure of the precious mass, Nerado ordered power into the converters\r\nand drove an enormous softening field of force upon the object--a force\r\nof such a nature that it would condense the metallic iron into an\r\nallotropic modification of much smaller bulk; a red, viscous, extremely\r\ndense and heavy liquid which could be stored conveniently in his tanks.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the precious fluid been stored away than the detectors\r\nagain broke into an uproar. In one direction was an enormous mass of\r\niron, scarcely detectable; in another a great number of smaller masses;\r\nin a third an isolated mass, comparatively small in size. Space seemed\r\nto be full of iron, and Nerado drove his most powerful beam toward\r\ndistant Nevia and sent an exultant message.\r\n\r\n\"We have found iron--easily obtained and in unthinkable quantity--not in\r\nfractions of milligrams, but in millions upon unmeasured millions of\r\ntons! Send our sister ship here as once!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nerado!\" The captain was called to one of the observation plates as\r\nsoon as he had opened his key. \"I have been investigating the mass of\r\niron now nearest us, the small one. It is an artificial structure, a\r\nsmall space-boat, and there are three creatures in it--monstrosities\r\ncertainly, but they must possess some intelligence or they could not be\r\nnavigating space.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Impossible!\" exclaimed the chief explorer. \"Probably, then, the\r\nother was--but no matter, we had to have the iron. Bring the boat in\r\nwithout converting it, so that we may study at our leisure both the\r\nbeings and their mechanisms,\" and Nerado swung his own visiray beam into\r\nthe emergency boat, seeing there the armored figures of Clio Marsden and\r\nthe two Triplanetary officers.\r\n\r\n\"They are indeed intelligent,\" Nerado commented, as he detected and\r\nsilenced Costigan's ultra-beam communicator. \"Not, however, as\r\nintelligent as I had supposed,\" he went on, after studying the peculiar\r\ncreatures and their tiny space-ship more in detail. \"They have immense\r\nstores of iron, yet use it for nothing other than building material.\r\nThey apparently have a rudimentary knowledge of ultra-waves, but do not\r\nuse them intelligently--they cannot neutralize even these ordinary\r\nforces we are now employing. They are of course more intelligent than\r\nthe lower ganoids, or even than some of the higher fishes, but by no\r\nstretch of the imagination can they be compared to us. I am quite\r\nrelieved--I was afraid that in my haste I might slay members of a highly\r\ndeveloped race.\"\r\n\r\nThe helpless boat, all her forces neutralized, was brought up close to\r\nthe immense flying fish. There flaming knives of force sliced her neatly\r\ninto sections and the three rigid armored figures, after being bereft of\r\ntheir external weapons, were brought through the air-locks and into the\r\ncontrol room, while the pieces of their boat were stored away for future\r\nstudy. The Nevian scientists first analyzed the air inside the\r\nspace-suits of the Terrestrials, then removed without ado the protective\r\ncovering of the captives.\r\n\r\nCostigan--fully conscious through it all and now able to move a little,\r\nsince the peculiar temporary paralysis was wearing off--braced himself\r\nfor he knew not what shock, but it was needless; their grotesque captors\r\nwere not torturers. The air, while somewhat less dense than earth's and\r\nof a peculiar odor, was eminently breathable, and even though the vessel\r\nwas motionless in space, an almost-normal gravitation gave them a large\r\nfraction of their usual weight. The space suits were removed with care,\r\nand after the three had been relieved of their pistols and other\r\narticles which the Nevians thought might prove to be weapons, the\r\nstrange paralysis was lifted entirely. The earthly clothing puzzled the\r\ncaptors immensely, but so strenuous were the objections raised to its\r\nremoval, but they did not press the point, but fell back to study their\r\nfind in detail.\r\n\r\nThen faced each other the representatives of the civilizations of two\r\nwidely separated solar systems. The Nevians studied the human beings\r\nwith interest and curiosity blended largely with loathing and repulsion;\r\nthe three Terrestrials regarded the unmoving, expressionless \"faces\"--if\r\nthose coned heads could be said to possess such things--with horror and\r\ndisgust, as well as with other emotions, each according to his type and\r\ntraining. For to human eyes the Nevian is a fearful thing. Even to-day\r\nthere are few Terrestrials--or Solarians for that matter--who can look\r\nat a Nevian, eye to eye, without feeling a creeping of the skin and\r\nexperiencing a \"gone\" sensation in the pit of the stomach. The horny,\r\nwrinkled, drought-resisting Martian, whom we all know and rather like,\r\nis a hideous being indeed. The bat-eyed, colorless, hairless,\r\npractically skinless Venerian is worse. But they both are, after all,\r\nremote cousins of Terra's humanity, and we get along with them quite\r\nwell whenever we are compelled to visit Mars or Venus. But the Nevians--\r\n\r\nThe horizontal, flat, fish body is not so bad, even supported as it is\r\nby four, short, powerful, scaly, flat-footed legs; and terminating as it\r\ndoes in the weird, four-vaned tail. The neck, even, is endurable,\r\nalthough it is long and flexible, heavily scaled, and is carried in\r\nwhatever eye-wringing loops, knots, or angles the owner considers most\r\nconvenient or ornamental at the time. Even the smell of a Nevian--a\r\nmalodorous reek of over-ripe fish--does in time become tolerable,\r\nespecially if sufficiently disguised with creosote, which purely\r\nTerrestrial chemical is the most highly prized perfume of Nevia. But the\r\nhead! It is that member that makes the Nevian so appalling to earthly\r\neyes, for it is a thing utterly foreign to all Solarian history or\r\nexperience. As most Tellurians already know, it is fundamentally a\r\nmassive cone, covered with scales, based spearhead-like upon the neck.\r\nFour great sea-green, triangular eyes are spaced equidistant from each\r\nother about half way up the cone. The pupils are contractile at will,\r\nlike the eyes of the cat, permitting the Nevian to see equally well in\r\nany ordinary extreme of light or darkness. Immediately below each eye\r\nsprings out a long, jointless, boneless, tentacular arm; an arm which at\r\nits extremity divides into eight delicate and sensitive, but very\r\nstrong, fingers. Below each arm is a mouth: a beaked, needle-tusked\r\norifice of dire potentialities. Finally, under the overhanging edge of\r\nthe cone-shaped head are the delicately frilled organs which serve\r\neither as gills or as nostrils and lungs, as may be desired. To other\r\nNevians the eyes and other features are highly expressive, but to us\r\nthey appear utterly cold and unmoving. Terrestrial senses can detect no\r\nchanges of expression in a Nevian's \"face.\" Such were the frightful\r\nbeings at whom the three prisoners stared with sinking hearts.\r\n\r\nBut if we human beings have always considered Nevians grotesque and\r\nrepulsive, the feeling has always been mutual. For those \"monstrous\"\r\nbeings are a highly intelligent and extremely sensitive race, and\r\nour--to us--trim and graceful human forms seems to them the very\r\nquintessence of malformation and hideousness.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens, Conway!\" Clio exclaimed, shrinking against Costigan as\r\nhis left arm flashed around her. \"What monstrosities! And they can't\r\ntalk--not one of them has made a sound--suppose they can be deaf and\r\ndumb?\"\r\n\r\nBut at the same time Nerado was addressing his fellows.\r\n\r\n\"What hideous, deformed creatures they are! Truly a low form of life,\r\neven though they do possess some intelligence. They cannot talk, and\r\nhave made no signs of having heard our words to them--do you suppose\r\nthat they communicate by sight? That those weird contortions of their\r\npeculiarly placed organs serve as speech?\"\r\n\r\nThus both sides, neither realizing that the other had spoken. For the\r\nNevian voice is pitched so high that the lowest note audible to them is\r\nfar above our limit of hearing. The shrillest note of a Terrestrial\r\npiccolo is to them so profoundly low that it cannot be heard.\r\n\r\n\"We have much to do.\" Nerado turned away from the captives. \"We must\r\npostpone further study of the specimens until we have taken aboard a\r\nfull cargo of the iron which is so plentiful here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do with them, sir?\" asked one of the Nevian officers.\r\n\"Lock them in one of the storage rooms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! They might die there, and we must by all means keep them in\r\ngood condition, to be studied most carefully by the fellows of the\r\nCollege of Science. What a commotion there will be when we bring in this\r\ngroup of strange creatures, living proof that there are other suns\r\npossessing planets; planets which are supporting organic and intelligent\r\nlife! You may put them in three communicating rooms, say in the fourth\r\nsection--they will undoubtedly require light and exercise. Lock all\r\nexits, of course, but it would be best to leave the doors between the\r\nrooms unlocked, so that they can be together or apart, as they choose.\r\nSince the smallest one, the female, stays so close to the larger male,\r\nit may be that they are mates. But since we know nothing of their habits\r\nor customs, it will be best to give them all possible freedom compatible\r\nwith safety.\"\r\n\r\nNerado turned back to his instruments and three of the frightful crew\r\ncame up to the human beings. One walked away, waving a couple of arms in\r\nan unmistakable signal that the prisoners were to follow him. The three\r\nobediently set out after him, the other two guards falling behind.\r\n\r\n\"Now's our best chance!\" Costigan muttered, as they passed through a low\r\ndoorway and entered a narrow corridor. \"Watch that one ahead of you,\r\nClio--hold him for a second if you can. Bradley, you and I'll take the\r\ntwo behind us--now!\"\r\n\r\nCostigan stopped and whirled. Seizing a cable-like arm, he pulled the\r\noutlandish head down, the while the full power of his mighty right leg\r\ndrove a heavy service boot into the place where scaly neck and head\r\njoined. The Nevian fell, and instantly Costigan leaped at the leader,\r\nahead of the girl. Leaped; but dropped to the floor, again paralyzed.\r\nFor the Nevian leader had been alert, his four eyes covering the entire\r\ncircle of vision, and he had acted rapidly. Not in time to stop\r\nCostigan's first Berserk attack--the First Officer's reactions were\r\npractically instantaneous, and he moved like chain lightning--but in\r\ntime to retain command of the situation. Another Nevian appeared and,\r\nwhile the stricken guard was recovering, all four arms wrapped tightly\r\naround his convulsively looping, knotting neck, the three helpless\r\nTerrestrials were lifted into the air and carried bodily into the\r\nquarters to which Nerado had assigned them. Not until they had been\r\nplaced upon cushions in the middle room and the heavy metal doors had\r\nbeen locked upon them did they again find themselves able to use arms or\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's another round we lose,\" Costigan commented, cheerfully. \"A\r\nguy can't mix it very well when he can neither kick, strike, nor bite. I\r\nexpected those lizards to rough me up, but they didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't want to hurt us. They want to take us home with them,\r\nwherever that is, as curiosities, like wild animals or something,\"\r\ndecided the girl, shrewdly. \"They're pretty bad, of course, but I like\r\nthem a lot better than I do Roger and his robots, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you have the right idea, Miss Marsden,\" Bradley rumbled.\r\n\"That's it, exactly. I feel like a bear in a cage. I should think you'd\r\nfeel worse than ever. What chance has an animal of escaping from a\r\nmenagerie?\"\r\n\r\n\"These animals, lots. I'm feeling better and better all the time,\" Clio\r\nanswered, and her serene bearing bore out her words. \"You two got us out\r\nof that horrible place of Roger's, and I'm pretty sure that you will get\r\nus away from here, somehow or other. They may think we're stupid\r\nanimals, but before you two and the Secret Service get done with them\r\nthey'll have another think coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the old fight, Clio!\" cheered Costigan. \"I haven't got it\r\nfigured out as close as you have, but I see you, eye to eye. These\r\nfour-legged fish carry considerably heavier stuff than Roger did, I'm\r\nthinking; but they'll be up against something themselves pretty quick,\r\nthat is NO light-weight, believe me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you _know_ something, or are you just whistling in the dark?\"\r\nBradley demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I know a little; not much. The Science Service has been working on a\r\nnew ship for a long time; a ship to travel so much faster than light\r\nthat it can go anywhere in the Galaxy and back in a month or so. New\r\nsub-ether drive, new power, new armament, new everything. Only bad thing\r\nabout it is that it doesn't work so good yet--it's fuller of \"bugs\" than\r\na Venerian's kitchen. It has blown up five times that I know of, and has\r\nkilled twenty-nine men. But when they get it licked they'll _have\r\nsomething!_\"\r\n\r\n\"When, or if?\" asked Bradley, pessimistically.\r\n\r\n\"I said _when!_\" snapped Costigan, his voice cutting like a knife. \"When\r\nthat gang goes after anything they get it, and when they get it it\r\nstays....\" He broke off abruptly and his voice lost its edge. \"Sorry.\r\nDidn't mean to get high, but I think we'll have help, if we can keep our\r\nheads up a while. And it looks good--these are first-class cages they've\r\ngiven us. All the comforts of home, even to lookout plates. Let's see\r\nwhat's going on, shall we?\"\r\n\r\nAfter some experimenting with the unfamiliar controls Costigan learned\r\nhow to operate the Nevian visiray, and upon the plate they saw the Cone\r\nof Battle hurling itself toward Roger's planetoid. They saw the pirate\r\nfleet rush out to do battle with Triplanetary's massed forces, and with\r\nbated breath they watched every maneuver of that epic battle to its\r\nsavagely sacrificial end. And that same battle was being watched, also\r\nwith intense interest, by the Nevians.\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed a blood-thirsty combat,\" mused Nerado at his observation\r\nplate. \"And it is peculiar--or rather, probably only to be expected from\r\na race of such a low stage of development--that they employ only\r\nether-borne forces. Warfare seems universal among primitive\r\ntypes--indeed, it is not so long ago that our own cities, few in number\r\nthough they are, ceased fighting each other and combined against the\r\nsemi-civilized fishes of the greater deeps.\"\r\n\r\nHe fell silent, and for many minutes watched the furious battle between\r\nthe two navies of the void. That conflict ended, he watched the\r\nTriplanetary fleet reform its battle cone and rush upon the planetoid.\r\n\r\n\"Destruction, always destruction,\" he sighed, adjusting his power\r\nswitches. \"Since they are bent upon mutual destruction I can see no\r\npurpose in refraining from destroying all of them. We need the iron, and\r\nthey are a useless race.\"\r\n\r\nHe launched his softening, converting field of dull red energy. Vast as\r\nthat field was, it could not encompass the whole of the fleet, but half\r\nof the lip of the gigantic cone soon disappeared, its component vessels\r\nsubsiding into a sluggishly flowing stream of allotropic iron. Instantly\r\nthe fleet abandoned the attack upon the planetoid and swung its cone\r\naround, to bring the flame-erupting axis to bear upon the inchoate\r\nsomething dimly perceptible to the ultra-vision of the Secret Service\r\nobservers. Furiously the gigantic composite beam of the massed fleet was\r\nhurled, nor was it alone.\r\n\r\nFor Roger in his floating citadel had realized at once that something\r\nuntoward was happening; something altogether beyond even his knowledge\r\nand experience. He could not see anything--space was apparently\r\nempty--but he took his rays off the battleships and directed his every\r\nforce just beyond the point in space where that red stream of\r\ntransformed metal was disappearing. Then, for the first time in\r\nTriplanetary history, the forces of law and order joined hands with\r\nthose of piracy and banditry against a common foe. Rods, beams, planes,\r\nand stilettoes of unbearable energy the doomed fleet launched, in\r\naddition to its main beam of annihilation, and Roger also hurled out\r\ninto space every weapon at his command. Bombs, high-explosive shells,\r\nand deadly radio-dirigible torpedoes--all alike disappeared ineffective\r\nin that redly murky veil of nothingness. And the fleet was being melted.\r\nIn quick succession the vessels flamed red, shrank together, gave out\r\ntheir air, and merged their component iron into the intensely red,\r\nsullenly viscous stream which was flowing through the impenetrable veil\r\nupon which Triplanetarians and pirates alike were directing their every\r\npossible weapon of offense.\r\n\r\nThe last vessel of the Triplanetary armada converted and the resulting\r\nmetal stored away in their capacious reservoirs, the Nevians turned\r\ntheir attention upon the stronghold of the pirates. There ensued a\r\nbattle royal. For this vast planetoid was no feeble warship, depending\r\nsolely upon the limited power available in its accumulators. It was the\r\nproduct of a really mighty brain, a brain re-enforced by the many\r\nperverted but powerful intellects which Roger had won over to his cause.\r\nIt was powered by the incalculable force of cosmic radiation, powered to\r\ndrive its unimaginable mass through space, against any possible\r\nattractions, for an indefinite number of years. It was armed and\r\nequipped to meet any emergency which Roger's coldly analytical mind had\r\nbeen able to foresee.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the scientists of the Secret Service had discovered\r\nultra-waves as yet unknown to him was unfortunate. That Service was\r\nitself unfortunate--impenetrable as it was, and incorruptible. He could\r\nlearn nothing whatever about it. He had heard vague rumors of certain\r\nexperiments--but even if they should discover something it would be too\r\nlate to do them any good. Even without invisibility he would have no\r\ntrouble in annihilating the massed Grand Fleet of the Triplanetary\r\nLeague. He would very shortly collect his tribute and disappear. And\r\nthis new enemy, himself invisible and armed with heretofore unknown\r\nweapons of dire power, who was apparently unaffected by his beams--even\r\nhe would discover that Roger the Great was no puny opponent. He would\r\nanalyze those unknown forces, regenerate them, and hurl them back upon\r\ntheir senders.\r\n\r\nThinking thus, the man of gray sat coldly motionless at his great\r\nmulti-shielded desk, whose top was now swung up to become a board of\r\nmassed and tiered instruments and controls. He shut off his offensive\r\nbeams and surrounded the entire planetoid with the peculiarly rigid and\r\nsubstantial shield which had so easily warded off Costigan's fiercest\r\nattacks. And that shield was more effective than even its designer had\r\nsupposed--gray Roger had builded even better than he knew. For the\r\nvoracious and all-powerful converting beam of the Nevians, below the\r\nlevel of the ether though it was, struck that perfectly transparent wall\r\nand rebounded, defeated and futile. Struck and rebounded, then struck\r\nand clung hungrily, licking out over that impermeable surface in darting\r\ntongues of red flame as the surprised Nerado doubled and then quadrupled\r\nhis power. Fiercer and fiercer drove in the Nevian flood of force until\r\nthe whole immense globe of the planetoid was one scintillant ball of\r\nscarlet energy, but still the pirates' shield remained intact--at what\r\nawful drain of resource, Roger alone knew.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the analysis of his screen, sir.\" A Nevian computer handed his\r\nchief a sheet of metal, upon which were engraved rows of symbols.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, a sixth-phase polycyclic. A screen of that type was scarcely to\r\nhave been expected from such a low form of life,\" Nerado commented, and\r\nrapidly adjusted the many dials and switches before him.\r\n\r\nAs he did so the character of the clinging mantle of force changed. From\r\nred it flamed quickly through the spectrum, became unbearably violet,\r\nthen disappeared; and as it disappeared the shielding wall began to give\r\nway. It did not cave in abruptly, but softened locally, sagging into a\r\npeculiar grouping of valleys and ridges--contesting stubbornly every\r\ninch of position lost. And gray Roger knew that the planetoid was\r\ndoomed. His supposedly impregnable screen was failing in spite of its\r\nutmost measure of energy, and, that defense down, the citadel would not\r\nlast a minute. Therefore he summoned a chosen few of his motley crew of\r\nrenegade scientists and issued brief instructions. For minutes a host of\r\nrobots toiled mightily, then a portion of the shield bulged out,\r\nextended into a tube beyond the attacking layers of force, and from it\r\nthere erupted a beam of violence incredible. A beam behind which was\r\nevery volt and ampere that the gigantic generators and accumulators of\r\nthe planetoid could yield. A beam that tore screamingly through the\r\nether; that by the very vehemence of its incalculable energy tore a hole\r\nthrough the redly impenetrable Nevian field and hurled itself upon the\r\ninner screen of the fish-shaped cruiser in frenzied incandescence. And\r\nwas there, or was there not, a lesser eruption upon the other side--an\r\nalmost imperceptible flash, as though something had shot from the doomed\r\nplanetoid out into space?\r\n\r\nNerado's looped neck straightened convulsively as his tortured drivers\r\nwhined and shrieked at the terrific overload; but Roger's effort was far\r\ntoo intense to be long maintained. Even before his accumulators failed,\r\ngenerator after generator burned out, the defensive screen collapsed,\r\nand the red converter beam attacked voraciously the unresisting metal of\r\nthose prodigious walls. Soon there was a terrific explosion as the\r\npent-up air of the planetoid broke through its weakening container, and\r\nthe sluggish river of allotropic iron flowed in an ever larger stream,\r\never faster.\r\n\r\n\"It is well that we had an unlimited supply of iron.\" Nerado tied a knot\r\nin his neck and spoke in huge relief. \"With but the seven pounds\r\nremaining of our original supply, I fear that it would have been\r\ndifficult to parry that last thrust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Difficult?\" asked the second in command. \"We would now be swimming in\r\nspace. But what shall I do with this iron? Our reservoirs will not hold\r\nit all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seal up one or two of the lower storage compartments, to make room for\r\nthis lot. Immediately it is loaded, we return to Nevia. There we shall\r\ninstall reservoirs in all the spare space, and come back here for more.\"\r\n\r\nThe last drop of the precious liquid secured, the vessel moved away,\r\nsluggishly now because of its prodigious load. In their quarters in the\r\nfourth section the three Terrestrials, who had watched with strained\r\nattention the downfall and absorption of the planetoid, stared at each\r\nother with drawn faces. Clio broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Conway, this is ghastly! It's ... it's just simply perfectly\r\nhorrible!\" she gasped, then recovered a measure of her customary spirit\r\nas she stared in surprise at Costigan's face. For it was thoughtful, his\r\neyes were bright and keen--no trace of fear or disorganization was\r\nvisible in any line of his hard young face.\r\n\r\n\"It's not so good,\" he admitted frankly. \"I wish I wasn't such a dumb\r\ncluck--if Lyman Cleveland or Ford Rodebush were here they could help a\r\nlot, but I don't know enough about any of their stuff to flag a\r\nhand-car. I can't even interpret that funny flash--if it really was a\r\nflash--that we saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why bother about one little flash, after all that really did happen?\"\r\nasked Clio, curiously.\r\n\r\n\"You think Roger launched something? He couldn't have--I didn't see a\r\nthing,\" Bradley argued.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to think. I've never seen anything material sent out\r\nso fast that I couldn't trace it with an ultra-wave--but on the other\r\nhand, Roger's got a lot of stuff that I never saw anywhere else.\r\nHowever, I don't see that it has anything to do with the fix we're in\r\nright now--but at that, we might be worse off. We're still breathing\r\nair, you notice, and if they don't blanket my wave I can still talk.\"\r\n\r\nHe put both hands in his pockets and spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Samms? Costigan. Put me on a recorder, quick--I probably haven't got\r\nmuch time,\" and for ten minutes he talked, concisely and as rapidly as\r\nhe could utter words, reporting clearly and exactly everything that had\r\ntranspired. Suddenly he broke off, writhing in agony. Frantically he\r\ntore his shirt open and hurled a tiny object across the room.\r\n\r\n\"Wow!\" he exclaimed. \"They may be deaf, but they can certainly detect an\r\nultra-wave, and the interference they can set up on it is enough to\r\npulverize your bones. No, I'm not hurt,\" he reassured the anxious girl,\r\nnow at his side, \"but it's a good thing I had you out of circuit--it\r\nwould have jolted you loose from six or seven of your back teeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any idea where they're taking us?\" she asked, soberly.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered flatly, looking deep into her steadfast eyes. \"No use\r\nlying to you--if I know you at all you'd rather take it standing up.\r\nThat talk of Jovians or Neptunians is the bunk--nothing like that ever\r\ngrew in our Solarian system. All the signs say that we're going for a\r\nlong, long ride!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  Nevian Strife\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nevian space-ship was hurtling upon its way. Space-navigators both,\r\nthe two Terrestrial officers soon discovered that it was even then\r\nmoving with a velocity far above that of light and that it must be\r\naccelerating at a stupendous rate, even though to them it seemed\r\nstationary--they could feel only a gravitational force somewhat less\r\nthan that of their native earth.\r\n\r\nBradley, seasoned old campaigner that he was, had retired promptly as\r\nsoon as he had completed a series of observations, and was sleeping\r\nsoundly upon a pile of cushions in the first of the three\r\ninter-connecting rooms. In the middle room, which was to be Clio's,\r\nCostigan was standing very close to the girl, but was not touching her.\r\nHis body was rigid, his face was tense and drawn.\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong, Conway; all wrong,\" Clio was saying, very seriously. \"I\r\nknow how you feel, but it's false chivalry.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't it, at all,\" he insisted, stubbornly. \"It isn't only that\r\nI've got you out here in space, in danger and alone, that's stopping me.\r\nI know you and I know myself well enough to know that what we start now\r\nwe'll go through with for life. It doesn't make any difference, that\r\nway, whether I start making love to you now or whether I wait until\r\nwe're back on Tellus--I've been telling you for half an hour that for\r\nyour own good you'd better pass me up entirely. I've got enough\r\nhorsepower to keep away from you if you tell me to--not otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, both ways, dear, but....\"\r\n\r\n\"But nothing!\" he interrupted. \"Can't you get it into your skull what\r\nyou'll be letting yourself in for if you marry me? Assume that we get\r\nback, which isn't sure, by any means. But even if we do, some day--and\r\nmaybe soon, too, you can't tell--somebody is going to collect fifty\r\ngrams of radium for my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty grams--and everybody knows that Samms himself is rated at only\r\nsixty? I _knew_ that you were somebody, Conway!\" Clio exclaimed,\r\nundeterred. \"But at that, something tells me that any pirate will earn\r\neven that much reward several times over before he collects it. Don't be\r\nsilly, dear heart--good-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe tipped her head back, holding up to him her red, sweetly curved,\r\nsmiling lips, and his eager arms, hitherto kept away from her by sheer\r\nforce of will, swept around her in almost fierce intensity. As his hot\r\nlips met hers, her arms crept up around his neck and they stood, clasped\r\ntogether in the motionless ecstasy of love's first embrace.\r\n\r\n\"Girl, girl, how I love you!\" Costigan's voice was husky, his usually\r\nhard eyes were glowing with a tender light. \"That settles that. I'll\r\nreally _live_ now, anyway, while....\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop it!\" she commanded, sharply. \"You're going to live until you die\r\nof old age--see if you don't. You'll simply _have_ to, Conway!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so, too--no percentage in dying now. All the pirates between\r\nTellus and Andromeda couldn't take me after this--I've got too much to\r\nlive for. Well, good-night, sweetheart, I'd better beat it--you need\r\nsome sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe lovers' parting was not as simple and straightforward a procedure as\r\nCostigan's speech would indicate, but finally he did seek his own room\r\nand relaxed upon a pile of cushions, his stern visage transformed.\r\nInstead of the low metal ceiling he saw a beautiful, oval, tanned young\r\nface, framed in a golden-blonde corona of hair. His gaze sank into the\r\ndepths of loyal, honest, dark-blue eyes; and looking deeper and deeper\r\ninto those blue wells he fell asleep. Upon his face, too set and grim by\r\nfar for a man of his years--the lives of Sector Chiefs of the T. S. S.\r\nare never easy, nor as a rule are they long--there lingered as he slept\r\nthat newly acquired softness of expression, the reflection of his\r\ntranscendent happiness.\r\n\r\nFor eight hours he slept soundly, as was his wont; then, also according\r\nto his habit and training, he came wide awake, with no intermediate\r\nstage of napping.\r\n\r\n\"Clio?\" he whispered. \"Awake, girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Awake!\" Her voice came through the ultra-phone, relief in every\r\nsyllable. \"Good heavens, I thought you were going to sleep until we got\r\nto wherever it is that we're going! Come on in, you two--I don't see how\r\nyou can possibly sleep, just as though you were home in bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got to learn to sleep anywhere if you expect to keep in....\"\r\nCostigan broke off as he opened the door and saw Clio's wan face. She\r\nhad evidently spent a sleepless and wracking eight hours. \"Good Lord,\r\nClio, why didn't you call me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm all right, except for being a little jittery. No need of asking\r\nhow _you_ feel, is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--I feel hungry,\" he answered cheerfully. \"I'm going to see what we\r\ncan do about it--or say, guess I'll see whether they're still\r\ninterfering on Samms' wave.\"\r\n\r\nHe took out a small, insulated case and touched the contact stud lightly\r\nwith his fingers. His arm jerked away powerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Still at it,\" he gave the necessary explanation. \"They don't seem to\r\nwant us to talk outside, but his interference is as good as my\r\ntalking--they can trace it, of course. Now I'll see what I can find out\r\nabout our breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped over to the plate and shot its projector beam forward into\r\nthe control room, where he saw Nerado lying, doglike, at his instrument\r\npanel. As Costigan's beam entered the room a blue light flashed on and\r\nthe Nevian turned an eye and an arm toward his own small observation\r\nplate. Knowing that they were now in visual communication, Costigan\r\nbeckoned an invitation and pointed to his mouth in what he hoped was the\r\nuniversal sign of hunger. The Nevian waved an arm and fingered controls,\r\nand as he did so a wide section of the floor of Clio's room slid aside.\r\nThe opening thus made revealed a table which rose upon its low pedestal,\r\na table equipped with three softly cushioned benches and spread with a\r\nglittering array of silver and glassware. Bowls and platters of\r\ndazzlingly white metal, narrow-waisted goblets of sheerest crystal; all\r\nwere hexagonal, beautifully and intricately carved or etched in\r\napparently conventional marine designs. And the table utensils of this\r\nstrange race were peculiar indeed. There were tearing forceps of sixteen\r\nneedle-sharp curved teeth; there were flexible spatulas; there were deep\r\nand shallow ladles with flexible edges; there were many other peculiarly\r\ncurved instruments at whose uses the Terrestrials could no even guess;\r\nall having delicately fashioned handles to fit the long, slender fingers\r\nof the Nevians.\r\n\r\nBut if the table and its appointments were surprising to the\r\nTerrestrials, revealing as they did a degree of culture which none of\r\nthem had expected to find in a race of beings so monstrous, the food was\r\neven more surprising, although in another sense. For the wonderful\r\ncrystal goblets were filled with a grayish-green slime of a nauseous and\r\noverpowering odor, the smaller bowls were full of living sea spiders and\r\nother such delicacies; and each large platter contained a fish fully a\r\nfoot long, raw and whole, garnished tastefully with red, purple, and\r\ngreen strands of seaweed!\r\n\r\nClio looked once, then gasped, shutting her eyes and turning away from\r\nthe table, but Costigan flipped the three fish into a platter and set it\r\naside before he turned back to the visiplate.\r\n\r\n\"They'll go good fried,\" he remarked to Bradley, signaling vigorously to\r\nNerado that the meal was not acceptable and that he wanted to talk to\r\nhim, _in person_. Finally he made himself clear, the table sank down out\r\nof sight, and the Nevian commander cautiously entered the room.\r\n\r\nAt Costigan's insistence, he came up to the plate, leaving near the door\r\nthree guards armed with projectors in instant readiness. The operative\r\nthen shot the beam into the galley of the pirate's lifeboat, suggesting\r\nthat they should be allowed to live there. For some time the argument of\r\narms and fingers raged--though not exactly a fluent conversation, both\r\nsides managed to convey their meanings quite clearly. Nerado would not\r\nallow the Terrestrials to visit their own ship--he was taking no\r\nchances--but after a thorough ultra-ray inspection he did finally order\r\nsome of his men to bring into the middle room the electric range and a\r\nsupply of Terrestrial food. Soon the Nevian fish were sizzling in a pan\r\nand the appetizing odors of coffee and of browning biscuit permeated the\r\nroom. But at the first appearance of those odors the Nevians departed\r\nhastily, content to watch the remainder of the curious and repulsive\r\nprocedure in their visiray plates.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over and everything made tidy and shipshape, Costigan turned\r\nto Clio.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, girl; you've got to learn how to sleep. You're all in. Your\r\neyes look like you'd been on a Martian picnic and you didn't eat half\r\nenough breakfast. You've got to sleep and eat to keep fit. We don't want\r\nyou passing out on us, so I'll put out this light, and you'll lie down\r\nhere and sleep until noon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; don't bother. I'll sleep to-night. I'm quite....\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll sleep now,\" he informed her, levelly. \"I never thought of you\r\nbeing nervous, with Bradley and me on each side of you. We're both right\r\nhere now, though, and we'll stay here. We'll watch over you like a\r\ncouple of old hens with one chick between them. Come on; lie down and go\r\nbye-bye.\"\r\n\r\nClio laughed at the simile, but lay down obediently. Costigan sat upon\r\nthe edge of the great divan, holding her hand, and they chatted idly.\r\nThe silences grew longer, Clio's remarks became fewer, and soon her\r\nlong-lashed lids fell and her deep, regular breathing showed that she\r\nwas sound asleep. The man stared at her, his very heart in his eyes. So\r\nyoung, so beautiful, so lovely--and _how_ he did love her! He was not\r\nformally religious, but his every thought was a sincere prayer. If he\r\ncould only get her out of this mess ... he wasn't fit to live on the\r\nsame planet with her, but ... just give him one chance, just one!\r\n\r\nBut Costigan had been laboring for days under a terrific strain, and had\r\nbeen going very short on sleep. Half hypnotized by his own mixed\r\nemotions and by his staring at the smooth curves of Clio's cheek, his\r\nown eyes closed and, still holding her hand, he sank down into the soft\r\ncushions beside her and into oblivion.\r\n\r\nThus sleeping hand-in-hand like two children Bradley found them, and a\r\ntender, fatherly expression came over his face as he looked down at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Nice little girl, Clio,\" he mused, \"and when they made Costigan they\r\nbroke the mould. They'll do--about as fine a couple of kids as old\r\nTellus ever produced. I could do with some more sleep myself.\" He yawned\r\nprodigiously, lay down at Clio's left, and almost instantly was himself\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nHours later, both men were awakened by a merry peal of laughter. Clio\r\nwas sitting up, regarding them with sparkling eyes. She was refreshed,\r\nbuoyant, ravenously hungry and highly amused. Costigan was amazed and\r\nannoyed at what he considered a failure in a self-appointed task;\r\nBradley was calm and matter-of-fact.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for being such a nice bodyguard, you two,\" Clio laughed again,\r\nbut sobered quickly. \"I slept wonderfully well, but I wonder if I can\r\nsleep to-night without making you hold my hand all night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he doesn't mind doing that,\" Bradley commented.\r\n\r\n\"Mind it!\" Costigan exclaimed, and his eyes and his tone spoke volumes\r\nthat his tongue left unsaid.\r\n\r\nThey prepared and ate another meal, one to which Clio did full justice;\r\nand, rested and refreshed, had begun to discuss possibilities of escape\r\nwhen Nerado and his three armed guards entered the room. The Nevian\r\nscientist placed a box upon a table and began to make adjustments upon\r\nits panels, eyeing the Terrestrials attentively after each setting.\r\nAfter a time a staccato burst of articulate speech issued from the box,\r\nand Costigan saw a great light.\r\n\r\n\"You've got it--hold it!\" he exclaimed, waving his arms excitedly. \"You\r\nsee, Clio, their voices are pitched either higher or lower than\r\nours--probably higher--and they've built an audio-frequency changer.\r\nHe's nobody's fool, that fish!\"\r\n\r\nNerado heard Costigan's voice; there was no doubt of that. His long neck\r\nlooped and angled in Nevian gratification, and, although neither side\r\ncould understand the other, both knew that intelligent speech and\r\nhearing were attributes common to the two races. This fact altered\r\nmarkedly the relations between captors and captives. The Nevians\r\nadmitted among themselves that the strange bipeds might be quite\r\nintelligent, after all; and the Terrestrials at once became more\r\nhopeful.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't so bad, if they can talk,\" Costigan summed up the situation.\r\n\"We might as well take it easy and make the best of it, particularly\r\nsince we haven't been able to figure out any possible way of getting\r\naway from them. They can talk and hear, and we can learn their language\r\nin time. Maybe we can make some kind of a deal with them to take us back\r\nto our own system, if we can't make a break.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nevians being as eager as the Terrestrials to establish\r\ncommunication, Nerado kept the newly devised frequency-changer in\r\nconstant use. There is no need of describing at length the details of\r\nthat interchange of languages. Suffice it to say that starting at the\r\nvery bottom they learned as babies learn, but with the great advantage\r\nover babies of possessing fully developed and capable brains. And while\r\nthe human beings were learning the tongue of Nevia, several of the\r\namphibians (and incidentally Clio Marsden) were learning Triplanetarian;\r\nthe two officers knowing well that it would be much easier for the\r\nNevians to learn the logically-built common language of the Three\r\nPlanets than to master the senseless intricacies of English.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks the two parties were able to understand each other after\r\na fashion, by using a weird mixture of both languages. As soon as a few\r\nideas had been exchanged, the Nevian scientists built transformers small\r\nenough to be worn collar-like by the Terrestrials, and the captives were\r\nallowed to roam at will throughout the great vessel; only the\r\ncompartment in which was stored the dismembered pirate lifeboats being\r\nsealed to them. Thus it was that they were not left long in doubt, when\r\nanother fish-shaped cruiser of the world was revealed upon their lookout\r\nplates in the awful emptiness of interstellar space.\r\n\r\n\"That is our sister-ship, going to your Solarian system for a cargo of\r\nthe iron which is so plentiful there,\" Nerado explained to his\r\ninvoluntary guests.\r\n\r\n\"I hope the gang has got the bugs worked out of our super-ship,\"\r\nCostigan muttered savagely to his companions as Nerado turned away. \"If\r\nthey have, that outfit will get something more than a load of iron when\r\nthey get there!\"\r\n\r\nMore weeks passed; weeks during which a blue-white star separated itself\r\nfrom the infinitely distant firmament and began to show a perceptible\r\ndisk. Larger and larger it grew, becoming bluer and bluer as the flying\r\nspace-ship approached it, until finally Nevia could be seen, apparently\r\nclose beside her parent orb.\r\n\r\nHeavily laden though the vessel was, such was her power that she was\r\nsoon dropping vertically toward a large lagoon in the middle of the\r\nNevian city. That bit of open water was strangely devoid of life, for\r\nthis was to be no ordinary landing. Under the terrific power of the\r\nbeams braking the descent of that unimaginable load of allotropic iron\r\nthe water seethed and boiled; and instead of floating gracefully upon\r\nthe surface of the sea, this time the huge ship of space sank like a\r\nplummet to the bottom. Having accomplished this delicate feat of docking\r\nthe vessel safely in the immense cradle prepared for her, Nerado turned\r\nto the Terrestrials, who, now under guard, had been brought before him.\r\n\r\n\"While our cargo of iron is being discharged, I am to take you three\r\nTellurians to the College of Science, where you are to undergo a\r\nthorough physical and psychological examination. Follow me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" protested Costigan, with a quick and furtive wink at\r\nhis companions. \"Do you expect us to go _through water_, and at this\r\nfrightful depth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Nevian, in surprise. \"You are air-breathers, of\r\ncourse, but you must be able to swim a little, and this slight\r\ndepth--but little more than thirty of your meters--will not trouble\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong, twice,\" declared the Terrestrial, convincingly. \"If by\r\n'swimming' you mean propelling yourself in or through the water, we know\r\nnothing of it. In water over our heads we drown helplessly in a minute\r\nor two, and the pressure at this depth would kill us instantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I could take a lifeboat, of course, but that....\" The Nevian\r\nCaptain began, doubtfully, but broke off at the sound of a staccato call\r\nfrom his signal panel.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Nerado, attention!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nerado,\" he acknowledged into a microphone.\r\n\r\n\"The Third City is being attacked by the fishes of the greater deeps.\r\nThey have developed new and powerful mobile fortresses mounting\r\nunheard-of weapons and the city reports that it cannot long withstand\r\ntheir attack. The inhabitants are asking for all possible help. Your\r\nvessel not only has vast stores of iron, but also mounts weapons of\r\npower. You are requested to proceed to their aid at the earliest\r\npossible moment.\"\r\n\r\nNerado snapped out orders and the liquid iron fell in streams from\r\nwide-open ports, forming a vast, red pool in the bottom of the dock. In\r\na short time the great vessel was in equilibrium with the water she\r\ndisplaced, and as soon as she had attained a slight buoyancy the ports\r\nsnapped shut and Nerado threw on the power.\r\n\r\n\"Go back to your own quarters and stay there until I send for you,\" the\r\nNevian directed, and as the Terrestrials obeyed the curt orders the\r\nfish-shaped cruiser of space tore herself from the water and flashed up\r\ninto the crimson sky.\r\n\r\n\"What a barefaced liar!\" Bradley exclaimed. The three, transformers cut\r\noff, were back in the middle room of their suite. \"You can outswim an\r\notter, and I happen to know that you came up out of the old DZ83 from a\r\ndepth of....\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I did exaggerate a trifle,\" Costigan interrupted him, \"but the\r\nmore helpless he thinks we are the better for us. And we want to stay\r\nout of any of their cities as long as we can, because they may be hard\r\nplaces to escape from. I've got a couple of ideas, but they aren't ripe\r\nenough to pick yet.... Wow! how this bird's been traveling! We're there\r\nalready! If he hits the water going like this, he'll split himself,\r\nsure!\"\r\n\r\nWith undiminished velocity they were flashing downward in a long slant\r\ntoward the beleaguered Third City, and from the flying vessel there was\r\nlaunched toward the city's central lagoon a torpedo. No missile this,\r\nbut a capsule containing a full ton of allotropic iron, which would be\r\nof more use to the Nevian defenders than millions of men. For the Third\r\nCity was sore pressed indeed. Around it was one unbroken ring of\r\nboiling, exploding water--water billowing upward with searing, blinding\r\nbursts of superheated steam, or being hurled bodily in all directions in\r\nsolid masses by the cataclysmic forces being released by the embattled\r\nfishes of the greater deeps. Her outer defenses were already down, and\r\neven as the Terrestrials stared in amazement another of the immense\r\nhexagonal buildings burst into fragments; its upper structure flying\r\nwildly into scrap metal, its lower half subsiding drunkenly below the\r\nsurface of the boiling sea.\r\n\r\nThe three Terrestrials involuntarily seized whatever supports were at\r\nhand as the Nevian space-ship struck the water with undiminished speed,\r\nbut the precaution was needless--Nerado knew thoroughly his vessel, its\r\nstrength and its capabilities. There was a mighty splash, but that was\r\nall. The artificial gravity was unchanged by the impact; to the\r\npassengers the vessel was still motionless and on even keel as, now a\r\nsubmarine, she snapped around like a very fish and attacked the rear of\r\nthe nearest fortress.\r\n\r\nFor fortresses they were; vast structures of green metal, plowing\r\nforward implacably upon immense caterpillar treads. And as they crawled\r\nthey destroyed, and Costigan, exploring the strange submarine with his\r\nvisiray beam, watched and marveled. For the fortresses were full of\r\nwater; water artificially cooled and aerated, entirely separate from the\r\nboiling flood through which they moved. They were manned by fish some\r\nfive feet in length. Fish with huge, goggling eyes; fish plentifully\r\nequipped with long, armlike tentacles; fish poised before control panels\r\nor darting about intent upon their various duties. Fish with intelligent\r\nbrains, waging desperate war upon a hated foe!\r\n\r\nNor was their warfare ineffectual. Their heat-rays boiled the water for\r\nhundreds of yards before them and their torpedoes were exploding against\r\nthe Nevian defenses in one appallingly continuous concussion. But most\r\npotent of all was a weapon unknown to Triplanetary warfare. From a\r\nfortress there would shoot out, with the speed of a meteor, a long,\r\njointed, telescopic rod, tipped with a tiny, brilliantly shining ball.\r\nWhenever this glowing tip encountered any obstacle, that obstacle\r\ndisappeared in an explosion world-wracking in its intensity. Then what\r\nwas left of the rod, dark now, would be retracted into the\r\nfortress--only to emerge again in a moment with a tip once more shining\r\nand potent.\r\n\r\nNerado, apparently as unfamiliar with the peculiar weapon as were the\r\nTerrestrials, attacked cautiously; sending out far to the fore his\r\nmurkily impenetrable screens of red. But the submarine was entirely\r\nnon-ferrous, and its officers were apparently quite familiar with the\r\nNevian beams which licked at and clung to the green walls in impotent\r\nfury. Through the red veil came stabbing tiny ball after brilliant ball,\r\nand only the most frantic dodging saved the space-ship from destruction\r\nin those first few furious seconds. And now the Nevian defenders of the\r\nThird City had secured and were employing the vast store of allotropic\r\niron so opportunely delivered by Nerado.\r\n\r\nFrom the city there pushed out immense nets of metal, extending from the\r\nsurface of the ocean to its bottom; nets radiating such terrific forces\r\nthat the very water itself was beaten back and stood motionless in\r\nvertical, glassy walls. Torpedoes were futile against that wall of\r\nenergy. The most fiercely driven rays of the fishes flamed incandescent\r\nagainst it, in vain. Even the incredible violence of a concentration of\r\nevery available force-ball against one point could not break through. At\r\nthat unimaginable explosion water was hurled for miles. The bed of the\r\nocean was not only exposed, but in it there was blown a crater at whose\r\ndimensions the Terrestrials dared not even guess. The crawling\r\nfortresses themselves were thrown backward violently and the very world\r\nwas rocked to its core by the concussion, but that iron-driven wall\r\nheld. The massive nets swayed and gave back, and tidal waves hurled\r\ntheir mountainously destructive masses through the Third City, but the\r\nmighty barrier remained intact. And Nerado, still attacking two of the\r\npowerful tanks with his every weapon, was still dodging those flashing\r\nballs charged with the quintessence of destruction. The fishes could not\r\nsee through the sub-ethereal veil, but all the rod-gunners of the two\r\nfortresses were combing it thoroughly with ever-lengthening,\r\never-thrusting rods, in a desperate attempt to wipe out the new and\r\napparently all-powerful Nevian submarine, whose sheer power was slowly\r\nbut inexorably crushing even their gigantic walls.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think that right now's the best chance we'll ever have of doing\r\nsomething for ourselves.\" Costigan turned away from the absorbing scenes\r\npictured upon the visiplate and faced his two companions.\r\n\r\n\"But what can we possibly do?\" asked Clio, and\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it is, we'll try it!\" Bradley exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Anything's better than staying here and letting them analyze us--no\r\ntelling what they'd do to us,\" Costigan went on. \"I know a lot more\r\nabout things than they think I do. They never did catch me using my\r\nspy-ray--it's on an awfully narrow beam, you know, and uses almost no\r\npower at all--so I've been able to dope out quite a lot of stuff. I can\r\nopen most of their locks, and I know how to run their small boats. This\r\nbattle, fantastic as it is, is deadly stuff, and it isn't one-sided, by\r\nany means, either, so that every one of them, from Nerado down, seems to\r\nbe on emergency duty. There are no guards watching us, or stationed\r\nwhere we want to go--our way out is open. And once out, this battle is\r\ngiving us our best possible chance to get away from them. There's so\r\nmuch emission out there already that they probably couldn't detect the\r\ndriving rays of the lifeboat, and they'll be too busy to chase us,\r\nanyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once out, then what?\" asked Bradley, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to decide that before we start, of course. I'd say make a\r\nbreak back for our own Solarian system. We know the direction, from our\r\nown observation, and we'll have plenty of power.\"\r\n\r\n\"But good Heavens, Conway, it's so far!\" exclaimed Clio. \"How about\r\nfood, water, and air--would we ever get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know as much about that as I do. I think so, but of course anything\r\nmight happen. This ship is none too big, is considerable slower than the\r\nbig space-ship, and we're a long ways from home. Another bad thing is\r\nthe food question. The boat is well stocked according to Nevian ideas,\r\nbut it's pretty foul stuff for us to eat. However, it's nourishing, and\r\nwe'll have to eat it, since we can't carry enough of our own supplies to\r\nthe boat to last long. Even so, we may have to go on short rations, but\r\nI think that we'll be able to make it. On the other hand, what happens\r\nif we stay here? We will certainly strike trouble sooner or later, and\r\nwe don't know any too much about these ultra-weapons. We are\r\nland-dwellers, and there is mighty little land on this planet. Then,\r\ntoo, we don't know where to look for what little land there is, and,\r\neven if we could find it, we know that it is all over-run with\r\namphibians already. There's a lot of things that might be better, but\r\nthey might be a lot worse, too. How about it? Do we try it or do we stay\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"We try it!\" exclaimed Clio and Bradley as one.\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'd better not waste any more time talking--let's go!\"\r\n\r\nStepping up to the locked and shielded door, he took out a peculiarly\r\nbuilt torch and pointed it briefly at the Nevian lock. There was no\r\nlight, no noise, but the massive portal swung smoothly open. They\r\nstepped out and Costigan relocked and reshielded the entrance.\r\n\r\n\"How ... what ...?\" Clio demanded, almost stuttering in her surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I've been going to school for the last few weeks,\" Costigan grinned,\r\n\"and I've picked up quite a few things here and there--literally as well\r\nas figuratively speaking. Snap it up, guys! Our armor is stored away\r\nwith the pieces of the pirates' lifeboat, and I'll feel a lot better\r\nwhen we've got it on and have hold of a few fresh Lewistons.\"\r\n\r\nThey hurried down corridors, up ramps, and along hallways, with\r\nCostigan's spy-ray investigating the course ahead for chance Nevians.\r\nBradley and Clio were unarmed, but the secret agent had found a piece of\r\nflat metal and had ground it to a razor edge.\r\n\r\n\"I think I can throw this thing straight enough and fast enough to chop\r\noff a Nevian's head before he can put a paralyzing ray on us,\" he\r\nexplained grimly, but he was not called upon to show his skill with the\r\nimprovised cleaver.\r\n\r\nAs he had concluded from his careful survey, every Nevian was at some\r\ncontrol or weapon, doing his part in that frightful combat with the\r\ndenizens of the greater deeps. Their part was open, they were neither\r\nmolested nor detected as they ran toward the compartment within which\r\nwas sealed all their Terrestrial belongings. The door of that room\r\nopened, as had the other, to Costigan's knowing beam; and all three set\r\nhastily to work. They made up packs of food, filled their capacious\r\npockets with emergency rations, recharged and buckled on Lewistons and\r\nautomatics, donned their armor, and clamped into their external holsters\r\na full complement of additional weapons.\r\n\r\n\"Now comes the ticklish part of the business,\" Costigan informed them.\r\nHis helmet was slowly turning this way and that, and the others knew\r\nthat through his spy-ray goggles he was studying their route. \"There's\r\nonly one boat we stand a chance of reaching, and somebody's mighty apt\r\nto see us. There's a lot of detectors up there, and we'll have to cross\r\na corridor full of communicator beams. There, that line's off ...\r\nscoot!\"\r\n\r\nAt his word they dashed out into the hall and hurried along for minutes,\r\ndodging to right or left as the leader snapped out orders. Finally he\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\"Here's those beams I told you about. We'll have to roll under 'em.\r\nThey're less than waist high--right there's the lowest one. Watch me do\r\nit, and when I give you the word, one at a time, you do the same. _Keep\r\nlow_--don't let an arm or a leg get up into the path of a ray or they\r\nmay see us.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw himself flat, rolled upon the floor a yard or so, and scrambled\r\nto his feet. He gazed intently at the blank wall for a space, then:\r\n\r\n\"Bradley--now!\" he snapped, and the Interplanetary captain duplicated\r\nhis performance.\r\n\r\nBut Clio, unused to the heavy and cumbersome space-armor she was\r\nwearing, could not roll in it with any degree of success. When Costigan\r\nbarked his order she tried, but stopped, floundering, almost directly\r\nbelow the invisible network of communicator beams. As she struggled one\r\nmailed arm went up, and Costigan saw in his ultra-goggles the faint\r\nflash as the beam encountered the interfering field. But already he had\r\nacted. Crouching low, he struck down the arm, seized it, and dragged the\r\ngirl out of the zone of visibility. Then in furious haste he opened a\r\nnearby door and all three sprang into a tiny compartment.\r\n\r\n\"Shut off all the fields of your suits, so that they can't interfere!\"\r\nhe hissed into the utter darkness. \"Not that I'd mind killing a few of\r\nthem, but if they start an organized search we're sunk. But even if they\r\ndid get a warning by touching your glove, Clio, they probably won't\r\nsuspect us. Our rooms are still shielded, and the chances are that\r\nthey're too busy to bother much about us, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nHe was right. A few beams darted here and there, but the Nevians saw\r\nnothing amiss and ascribed the interference to the falling into the beam\r\nof some chance bit of charged metal. With no further misadventures the\r\nTerrestrials gained entrance to the Nevian lifeboat, where Costigan's\r\nfirst act was to disconnect one steel boot from his armor of space. With\r\na sigh of relief he pulled his foot out of it, and from it carefully\r\npoured into the small power-tank of the craft fully thirty pounds of\r\nallotropic iron!\r\n\r\n\"I pinched it off them,\" he explained, in answer to amazed and inquiring\r\nlooks, \"and maybe you don't think it's a relief to get it out of that\r\nboot! I couldn't steal a flask to carry it in, so this was the only\r\nplace I could put it in. These lifeboats are equipped with only a couple\r\nof grams of iron apiece, you know, and we couldn't get half-way back to\r\nTellus on that, even with smooth going; and we may have to fight. With\r\nthis much to go on, though, we could go to Andromeda, fighting all the\r\nway. Well, we'd better break away.\"\r\n\r\nCostigan watched his plate closely, and, when the maneuvering of the\r\ngreat vessel brought his exit port as far away as possible from the\r\nThird City and the warring citadels of the deep, he shot the little\r\ncruiser out and away. Straight out into the ocean it sped, through the\r\nmurky red veil, and darted upward toward the surface. The three\r\nwanderers sat tense, hardly daring to breathe, staring into the\r\nplates--Clio and Bradley pushing at metal levers and stepping down hard\r\nupon metal brakes in unconscious efforts to help Costigan dodge the\r\nbeams and rods of death flashing so appallingly close upon all sides.\r\nOut of the water and into the air the darting, dodging lifeboat flashed\r\nin safety; but in the air, supposedly free from menace, came disaster.\r\nThere was a crunching, grating shock and the vessel was thrown into a\r\ndizzy spiral, from which Costigan finally leveled it into headlong\r\nflight away from the scene of battle. Watching the pyrometers which\r\nrecorded the temperature of the outer shell, he drove the lifeboat ahead\r\nat the highest safe atmospheric speed while Bradley went to inspect the\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty bad, but better than I thought,\" the captain reported. \"Outer\r\nand inner plates broken away on a seam. Inter-wall vacuum all lost, and\r\nwe wouldn't hold carpet-rags, let alone air. Any tools aboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some--and what we haven't got we'll make,\" Costigan declared. \"We'll\r\nput a lot of distance behind us, then we'll fix her up and get away from\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are those fish, anyway, Conway?\" Clio asked, as the lifeboat tore\r\nalong. \"The Nevians are bad enough, Heaven knows, but the very idea of\r\nintelligent and _educated_ FISH is enough to drive one mad!\"\r\n\r\n\"You know Nerado mentioned several times the 'semi-civilized fishes of\r\nthe greater deeps'?\" he reminded her. \"I gather that there are at least\r\nthree intelligent races here. We know two--the Nevians, who are\r\namphibians, and the fishes of the greater deeps. The fishes of the\r\nlesser deeps are also intelligent. As I get it, the Nevian cities were\r\noriginally built in very shallow water, or perhaps were upon islands.\r\nThe development of machinery and tools gave them a big edge on the fish;\r\nand those living in the shallow seas, nearest the islands, gradually\r\nbecame tributary nations, if not actually slaves. Those fish not only\r\nserve as food, but work in the mines, hatcheries, and plantations, and\r\ndo all kinds of work for the Nevians. Those so-called 'lesser deeps'\r\nwere conquered first, of course, and all their races of fish are docile\r\nenough now. But the deep-sea breeds, who live in water so deep that the\r\nNevians can hardly stand the pressure down there, were more intelligent\r\nto start with, and more stubborn besides. But the most valuable metals\r\nhere are deep down--this planet is very light for its size, you know--so\r\nthe Nevians kept at it until they conquered some of the deep-sea fish,\r\ntoo, and put 'em to work. But those high-pressure boys were nobody's\r\nfools. They realized that as time went on the amphibians would get\r\nfurther and further ahead of them in development, so they let themselves\r\nbe conquered, learned how to use the Nevians' tools and everything else\r\nthey could get hold of, developed a lot of new stuff of their own, and\r\nnow they're out to wipe the amphibians off the slate completely, before\r\nthey get too far ahead of them to handle.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Nevians are afraid of them, and want to kill them all, as fast\r\nas they possibly can,\" guessed Clio.\r\n\r\n\"That would be the logical thing, of course,\" commented Bradley. \"Got\r\npretty nearly enough distance now, Costigan?\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't enough distance on the planet to suit me,\" Costigan\r\nreplied. \"We'll need all we can get. A full diameter away from that crew\r\nof amphibians is too close for comfort--their detectors are keen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they can detect us?\" Clio asked. \"Oh, I wish they hadn't hit\r\nus--we'd have been away from here long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" Costigan assented, feelingly. \"But they did--no use\r\nsquawking. We can rivet and weld those seams and pump out the shell, and\r\nwe'd have to fill our air-tanks to capacity for the trip, anyway. And\r\nthings could be a lot worse--we are still breathing air!\"\r\n\r\nIn silence the lifeboat flashed onward, and half of Nevia's mighty globe\r\nwas traversed before it was brought to a halt, in the emptiest reaches\r\nof the planet's desolate and watery waste. Then in furious haste the two\r\nofficers set to work, again to make their small craft sound and\r\nspaceworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  Worm, Submarine, and Freedom\r\n\r\n\r\nSince both Costigan and Bradley had often watched their captors at work\r\nduring the long voyage from the Solar System to Nevia, they were quite\r\nfamiliar with the machine tools of the amphibians. Their stolen\r\nlifeboat, being an emergency craft, of course carried full repair\r\nequipment; and to such good purpose did the two officers labor that even\r\nbefore their air-tanks were fully charged, all the damage had been\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\nThe lifeboat lay motionless upon the mirror-smooth surface of the ocean.\r\nCaptain Bradley had opened the upper port and the three stood in the\r\nopening, gazing in silence toward the incredibly distant horizon, while\r\npowerful pumps were forcing the last possible ounces of air into the\r\npractically unbreakable storage cylinders. Mile upon strangely flat mile\r\nstretched that waveless, unbroken expanse of water, merging finally into\r\nthe violent redness of the Nevian sky. The sun was setting; a vast ball\r\nof purple flame dropping rapidly toward the horizon. Darkness came\r\nsuddenly as that seething ball disappeared, and the air became bitterly\r\ncold, in sharp contrast to the pleasant warmth of a moment before. And\r\nas suddenly clouds appeared in blackly banked masses and a cold, driving\r\nrain began to beat down in torrents.\r\n\r\n\"Br-r-r, it's cold! Let's go in--Oh! _Shut the door!_\" Clio shrieked,\r\nand leaped wildly down into the compartment below, out of Costigan's\r\nway, for he and Bradley also had seen slithering toward them the\r\nfrightful arm of the Thing.\r\n\r\nAlmost before the girl had spoken Costigan had leaped to the levers, and\r\nnot an instant too soon; for the tip of that horrible tentacle flashed\r\ninto the rapidly narrowing crack just before the door clanged shut. As\r\nthe powerful toggles forced the heavy screw threads into engagement and\r\ndrove the massive disk home into its bottle-tight, insulated seat, that\r\ngrisly tip fell severed to the floor of the compartment and lay there,\r\ntwitching and writhing with a loathsome and unearthly vigor. Two feet\r\nlong the piece was, and larger than a strong man's leg. It was armed\r\nwith spiked and jointed metallic scales, and instead of sucking disks it\r\nwas equipped with a series of _mouths_--mouths filled with sharp\r\nmetallic teeth which gnashed and ground together furiously, even though\r\nsundered from the horrible organism which they were designed to feed.\r\n\r\nThe little submarine shuddered in every plate and member as monstrous\r\ncoils encircled her and tightened inexorably in terrific, rippling\r\nsurges eloquent of mastodonic power; and a strident vibration smote\r\nsickeningly upon Terrestrial eardrums as the metal spikes of the\r\nmonstrosity crunched and ground upon the outer plating of their small\r\nvessel. Costigan stood unmoved at the plate, watching intently; hands\r\nready upon the controls. Due to the artificial gravity of the lifeboat\r\nit seemed perfectly stationary to its occupants. Only the weird\r\ngyrations of the pictures upon the lookout screens showed that the craft\r\nwas being shaken and thrown about like a rat in the jaws of a terrier;\r\nonly the gauges revealed that they were almost a mile below the surface\r\nof the ocean already, and were still going downward at an appalling\r\nrate. Finally Clio could stand no more.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to do something, Conway?\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Not unless I have to,\" he replied, composedly. \"I don't believe that he\r\ncan really hurt us, and if I use a ray of any kind I'm afraid that it\r\nwill kick up enough disturbance to bring Nerado down on us like a hawk\r\nafter a chicken. However, if he takes us much deeper I'll have to go to\r\nwork on him. We're getting down pretty close to our limit, and the\r\nbottom's a long way down yet.\"\r\n\r\nDeeper and deeper the lifeboat was dragged by its dreadful opponent,\r\nwhose spiked teeth still tore savagely at the tough outer plating of the\r\ncraft until Costigan reluctantly threw in his power switches. Against\r\nthe full propellant thrust the monster could draw them no lower, but\r\nneither could the lifeboat make any headway toward the surface. The\r\nTerrestrial then turned on his rays, but found that they were\r\nineffective. So closely was the creature wrapped around the submarine\r\nthat his weapons could not be brought to bear upon it without melting\r\nthe vessel's own outer skin.\r\n\r\n\"What can it possibly be, anyway, and what can we do about it?\" Clio\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"I thought at first it was something like a devilfish, or possibly an\r\novergrown starfish, but it's too flat, and has no body that I can see,\"\r\nCostigan made answer. \"It must be a kind of flat worm. That doesn't\r\nsound reasonable--the thing must be all of a hundred meters long--but\r\nthere it is. The only thing left to do now, as I see it, is to try to\r\nboil him alive.\"\r\n\r\nHe closed other circuits, diffusing a terrific beam of pure heat, and\r\nthe water all about them burst into furious clouds of steam. The boat\r\nleaped upward as the metallic fins of the gigantic worm fanned vapor\r\ninstead of water, but the creature neither released its hold nor ceased\r\nits relentlessly grinding attack. Minute after minute went by, but\r\nfinally the worm dropped limply away--cooked through and through;\r\nvanquished only by death.\r\n\r\n\"Now we've put our foot in it, clear to the knee!\" Costigan exclaimed,\r\nas he shot the lifeboat upward at its maximum power. \"Look at that! I\r\nknew that Nerado could trace us, but I didn't have any idea that _they_\r\ncould. It's a good thing these ultra-vision plates don't need light to\r\nsee by or we'd be _'spurlos versenkt'_ in a hurry!\"\r\n\r\nStaring with Costigan into the plate, Bradley and the girl saw, not the\r\nNevian sky-rover they had expected, but a fast submarine cruiser, manned\r\nby the frightful fishes of the greater deeps. It was coming directly\r\ntoward the lifeboat, and even as Costigan hurled the little vessel off\r\nat an angle and then upward into the air one of the deadly offensive\r\nrods, tipped with its glowing ball of pure destruction, flashed through\r\nthe spot where they would have been had they held their former course.\r\n\r\nBut powerful as were the propellant forces and fiercely though Costigan\r\napplied them, the denizens of the deep clamped a tractor ray upon the\r\nflying vessel before it had gained a mile of altitude. Costigan aligned\r\nhis every driving projector as his vessel came to an abrupt halt in the\r\ninvisible grip of the beam, then experimented with various dials.\r\n\r\n\"There ought to be some way of cutting that beam,\" he pondered audibly,\r\n\"but I don't know enough about their system to do it, and I'm afraid to\r\nmonkey around with things too much, because I might accidentally release\r\nthe screens we've already got out, and they're stopping altogether too\r\nmuch stuff for us to do without them right now.\"\r\n\r\nHe frowned as he studied the flaring defensive screens, now radiating an\r\nincandescent violet under the concentration of the forces being hurled\r\nagainst them by the warlike fishes, then stiffened suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so--they _can_ shoot 'em!\" he exclaimed, throwing the\r\nlifeboat into a furious corkscrew turn, and the very air blazed into\r\nflaming splendor as a dazzlingly scintillating ball of energy sped past\r\nthem and high into the air beyond.\r\n\r\nThen for minutes a spectacular battle raged. The twisting, turning,\r\nleaping airship, small as she was agile, kept on eluding the explosive\r\nprojectiles of the fishes, and her screens neutralized and re-radiated\r\nthe full power of the attacking beams. More--since Costigan did not need\r\nto think of sparing his iron, the ocean around the great submarine began\r\nfuriously to boil under the full-driven offensive beams of the tiny\r\nNevian ship. But escape Costigan could not. He could not cut that\r\ntractor beam and the utmost power of his drivers could not wrest the\r\nlifeboat from its tenacious clutch. And slowly but inexorably the ship\r\nof space was being drawn downward toward the ship of ocean's depths.\r\nDownward, in spite of the utmost possible effort of every projector and\r\npenetrator, and the two Terrestrial spectators, sick at heart, looked\r\nonce at each other. Then they looked at Costigan, who, jaw hard set and\r\neyes unflinchingly upon his plate, was concentrating his attack upon one\r\nturret of the green monster as they settled lower and lower.\r\n\r\n\"If this is ... if our number is going up, Conway,\" Clio began,\r\nunsteadily.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, it isn't!\" he snapped. \"Keep a stiff upper lip, girl. We're\r\nstill breathing air, and the battle's not over yet!\"\r\n\r\nNor was it; but it was not Costigan's efforts, mighty though they were,\r\nthat ended the attack of the fishes of the greater deeps. The tractor\r\nbeam snapped without warning, and so prodigious were the forces being\r\nexerted by the lifeboat that, as it hurled itself away, the three\r\npassengers were thrown violently to the floor, in spite of the powerful\r\ngravity controls. Scrambling up on hands and knees, bracing himself as\r\nbest he could against the terrific forces, Costigan managed finally to\r\nforce a hand up to his panel. He was barely in time; for even as he cut\r\nthe driving power to its normal value the outer shell of the lifeboat\r\nwas blazing at white heat from the friction of the atmosphere through\r\nwhich it had been tearing with such an insane acceleration!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see--Nerado to the rescue,\" Costigan commented, after a glance\r\ninto the plate. \"I hope that those fish blow him clear out of the\r\nGalaxy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" demanded Clio. \"I should think that you'd....\"\r\n\r\n\"Think again,\" he advised her. \"The worse Nerado gets licked the better\r\nfor us. I don't really expect that, but if they can keep him busy long\r\nenough, we can get far enough away so that he won't bother about us any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nAs the lifeboat tore upward through the air at the highest permissible\r\natmospheric velocity Bradley and Clio peered over Costigan's shoulders\r\ninto the plate, watching in absorbed interest the scene which was being\r\nkept in focus upon it. The Nevian ship of space was plunging downward in\r\na long, slanting dive, her terrific beams of force screaming out ahead\r\nof her. The rays of the little lifeboat had boiled the waters of the\r\nocean; those of the parent craft seemed literally to blast them out of\r\nexistence. All about the green submarine there had been volumes of\r\nfuriously-boiling water and dense clouds of vapor; now water and fog\r\nalike disappeared, converted into transparent superheated steam by the\r\nblasts of Nevian energy. Through that tenuous gas the enormous mass of\r\nthe submarine fell like a plummet, her defensive screens flaming an\r\nalmost invisible violet, her every offensive weapon vomiting forth solid\r\nand vibratory destruction toward the Nevian cruiser so high in the\r\nangry, scarlet heavens.\r\n\r\nFor miles the submarine dropped, until the frightful pressure of the\r\ndepth drove water into Nerado's beam faster than his forces could\r\nvolatilize it. Then in that seething funnel there was waged desperate\r\nconflict. At that funnel's wildly turbulent bottom lay the submarine,\r\nnow apparently trying to escape, but held fast by the tractor rays of\r\nthe space-ship; at its top, smothered almost to the point of\r\ninvisibility by billowing masses of steam, hung poised the Nevian\r\ncruiser.\r\n\r\nAs the atmosphere had grown thinner and thinner with increasing altitude\r\nCostigan had regulated his velocity accordingly, keeping the outer shell\r\nof the vessel at the highest temperature consistent with safety. Now\r\nbeyond measurable atmospheric pressure, the shell cooled rapidly and he\r\napplied full touring acceleration. At an appalling and constantly\r\nincreasing speed the miniature space-ship shot away from the strange,\r\nred planet; and smaller and smaller upon the plate became its picture.\r\nLong since the great vessel of the void had plunged beneath the surface\r\nof the sea, more closely to come to grips with the vessel of the fishes;\r\nfor a long time nothing of the battle had been visible save immense\r\nclouds of steam, blanketing hundreds of square miles of the ocean's\r\nsurface. But just before the picture became too small to reveal details\r\na few tiny dark spots appeared above the banks of cloud, now brilliantly\r\nilluminated by the rays of the rising sun--dots which might have been\r\nfragments of either vessel, blown bodily from the depths of the ocean\r\nand, riven asunder, hurled high into the air by the incredible forces at\r\nthe command of the other.\r\n\r\nNevia a tiny moon and the fierce blue sun rapidly growing smaller in the\r\ndistance, Costigan swung his visiray beam into the line of travel and\r\nturned to his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're off,\" he said, scowling. \"I hope it was Nerado that got\r\nblown up back there, but I'm afraid it wasn't. He whipped two of those\r\nsubmarines that we know of, and probably half their fleet besides.\r\nThere's no particular reason why that one should be able to take him, so\r\nit's my idea that we should get ready for great gobs of trouble.\r\n\r\n\"They'll chase us, of course; and I'm afraid that with their immense\r\npower, they'll catch us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can we do, Conway?\" asked Clio.\r\n\r\n\"Several things,\" he grinned. \"I managed to get quite a lot of dope on\r\nthat paralyzing ray and some of their other stuff, and we can install\r\nthe necessary equipment in our suits easily enough.\"\r\n\r\nThey removed their armor, and Costigan explained in detail the changes\r\nwhich must be made in the Triplanetary field generators. All three set\r\nvigorously to work--the two officers deftly and surely; Clio uncertainly\r\nand with many questions, but with undaunted spirit. Finally, having done\r\nall they could do to strengthen their position, they settled down to the\r\nwatchful routine of the flight, with every possible instrument set to\r\ndetect any sign of the pursuit they so feared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  The Hill\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Its atmosphere was withdrawn, the outer door opened, and he\r\n    glanced across a bare hundred feet of space at the\r\n    rocket-plane which, keel ports fiercely aflame, was braking\r\n    her terrific speed to match the slower pace of the gigantic\r\n    ship of war.]\r\n\r\nThe heavy cruiser _Chicago_ hung motionless in space, thousands of miles\r\ndistant from the warring fleets of space-ships so viciously attacking\r\nand so stubbornly defending the planetoid of the enemy. In the captain's\r\nsanctum Lyman Cleveland crouched tensely above his ultra-cameras, his\r\nsensitive fingers touching lightly their micrometric dials. His body was\r\nrigid, his face was set and drawn. Only his eyes moved: flashing back\r\nand forth between the observation plates and smoothly-running rolls\r\nwhich were feeding into the cameras the hardened steel tapes upon which\r\nwere being magnetically recorded the frightful scenes of carnage and\r\ndestruction there revealed.\r\n\r\nSilent and bitterly absorbed, though surrounded by staring officers,\r\nwhose fervent, almost unconscious cursing was prayerful in its\r\nintensity, the visiray expert kept his ultra-instruments upon that awful\r\nstruggle to its dire conclusion. Flawlessly those instruments noted\r\nevery detail of the destruction of Roger's fleet, of the transformation\r\nof the armada of Triplanetary into an unknown fluid, and finally of the\r\ndissolution of the gigantic planetoid itself. Then furiously Cleveland\r\ndrove his beams against the crimsonly opaque obscurity into which the\r\npeculiar, viscous stream of substance was disappearing. Time after time\r\nhe applied his every watt of power, with no result. A vast volume of\r\nspace, roughly ellipsodial in shape, was closed to him by forces\r\nentirely beyond his experience or comprehension. But suddenly, while his\r\nrays were still trying to pierce that impenetrable murk, it disappeared\r\ninstantly and, without warning, the illimitable infinity of space once\r\nmore lay revealed upon his plates and his beams flashed on and on\r\nthrough the void, unimpeded.\r\n\r\n\"Back to Tellus, sir?\" The _Chicago_'s captain broke the strained\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't say so, if I had the say.\" Cleveland, baffled and frustrate,\r\nstraightened up and shut off his cameras. \"We should report back as soon\r\nas possible, of course, but there seems to be a lot of wreckage out\r\nthere yet, that we can't photograph in detail at this distance. A close\r\nstudy of it might help us a lot in understanding what they did and how\r\nthey did it. I'd say that we should get close-ups of whatever is left,\r\nand do it right away, before it gets scattered all over space; but of\r\ncourse I can't give you orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can, though,\" the captain made surprising answer. \"My orders are\r\nthat you are in command of this vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case we will proceed at full emergency acceleration to\r\ninvestigate the wreckage,\" Cleveland replied, and the cruiser--sole\r\nsurvivor of Triplanetary's supposedly invincible force--shot away with\r\nevery projector delivering its maximum blast.\r\n\r\nAs the scene of the disaster was approached there was revealed upon the\r\nplates a confused mass of debris; a mass whose individual units were\r\napparently moving at random: yet which was as a whole still following\r\nthe orbit of Roger's planetoid. Space was full of machine parts,\r\nstructural members, furniture, flotsam of all kinds; and everywhere were\r\nthe bodies of men. Some were encased in space-suits, and it was to these\r\nthat the rescuers turned first--space-hardened veterans though the men\r\nof the _Chicago_ were, they did not care even to look at the others.\r\nStrangely enough, however, not one of the floating figures spoke or\r\nmoved, and space-line men were hurriedly sent out to investigate.\r\n\r\n\"All dead.\" Quickly the dread report came back. \"Been dead a long time.\r\nThe armor is all stripped off the suits, and the generators and the\r\nother apparatus are all shot. Something funny about it, too--none of\r\nthem seem to have been touched, but the machinery of the suits seems to\r\nbe about half of it missing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got it all on the spools, sir.\" Cleveland, his close-up survey of\r\nthe wreckage finished, turned to the captain. \"What they've just\r\nreported checks up with what I've photographed everywhere. I've got an\r\nidea of what might have happened, but it's so dizzy that I'll have to\r\nhave a lot of reenforcement before I'll believe it myself. But you might\r\nhave them bring in a few of the armored bodies, a couple of those\r\nswitchboards and panels floating around out there, and half a dozen\r\nmiscellaneous pieces of junk--the nearest things they get hold of,\r\nwhatever they happen to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then back to Tellus at maximum?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right--back to Tellus, as fast as we can possibly go there.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the _Chicago_ hurtled through space at full power, Cleveland and\r\nthe ranking officers of the vessel grouped themselves about the salvaged\r\nwreckage. Familiar with space-wrecks as were they all, none of them had\r\never seen anything like the material before them. For every part and\r\ninstrument was weirdly and meaninglessly disintegrated. There were no\r\nbreaks, no marks of violence, and yet nothing was intact. Bolt-holes\r\nstared empty, cores, shielding cases and needles had disappeared, the\r\nvital parts of every instrument hung awry, disorganization reigned\r\nrampant and supreme.\r\n\r\n\"I never imagined such a mess,\" the captain said, after a long and\r\nsilent study of the objects. \"If you have any theory to cover _that_,\r\nCleveland, I would like to hear it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to notice something first,\" the visiray expert replied. \"But\r\ndon't look for what's there--look for what _isn't_ there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the armor is gone. So are the shielding cases, shafts, spindles,\r\nthe housings and stems....\" The captain's voice died away as his eyes\r\nraced over the collection. \"Why, everything that was made of wood,\r\nbakelite, copper aluminum, silver, bronze, or anything but steel hasn't\r\nbeen touched, and every bit of steel is gone. But that doesn't make\r\nsense--what does it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--yet,\" Cleveland replied, slowly. \"But I'm afraid that\r\nthere's more, and worse.\" He opened a space-suit reverently, revealing\r\nthe face; a face calm and peaceful, but utterly, sickeningly white.\r\nStill reverently, he made a deep incision in the brawny neck, severing\r\nthe jugular vein, then went on, soberly:\r\n\r\n\"You never imagined such a thing as _white_ blood, either, but it all\r\nchecks up. Someway, somehow, every particle--probably every atom--of\r\nfree or combined iron in this whole volume of space was made off with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh? How come? And above all, _why_?\" from the amazed and staring\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n\"You know as much as I do,\" grimly, ponderingly. \"If it were not for the\r\nfact that there are solid asteroids of iron out beyond Mars, I would say\r\nthat somebody wanted iron badly enough to wipe out the fleets and the\r\nplanetoid to get it. But anyway, whoever they were, they carried enough\r\npower so that our armament didn't bother them at all. They simply took\r\nthe metal they wanted and went away with it--so fast that I couldn't\r\ntrace them with an ultra-beam. There's only one thing plain; but that's\r\nso plain that it scares me stiff. This whole affair spells intelligence,\r\nwith a capital \"I\", and that intelligence is anything but friendly. As\r\nfor me I want to get Fred Rodebush at work on this soon--think I'll\r\nhurry it up a little.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped over to his ultra-projector and called the Terrestrial\r\nheadquarters of the T. S. S. Samms' face soon appeared upon his screen.\r\n\r\n\"We got it all, Virgil,\" he reported.\r\n\r\n\"It's something extraordinary--bigger, wider, and deeper than any of us\r\ndreamed. It may be urgent, too, so I think I had better shoot the\r\npictures in on the ultra-wave and save a few days. Fred has a\r\ntelemagneto recorder there that he can synchronize with this camera\r\noutfit easily enough. Right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. Good work, Lyman--thanks,\" came back terse approval and\r\nappreciation, and soon the steel tapes were again flashing between the\r\nfeed-rolls. This time, however, their varying magnetic charges were\r\nmodulating an ultra-wave so that every detail of that calamitous battle\r\nof the void was being screened and recorded in the innermost private\r\nlaboratory of the Triplanetary Secret Service.\r\n\r\nEager though he naturally was to join his fellow-scientists, Cleveland\r\ndid not waste his time during the long, but uneventful journey back to\r\nearth. There was much to study, many improvements to be made in his\r\ncomparatively crude first ultra-camera. Then, too, there were long\r\nconferences with Samms, and particularly with Rodebush, the mathematical\r\nphysicist, whose was the task of solving the riddles of the energies and\r\nweapons of the Nevians. Thus it did not seem long before green Terra\r\ngrew large beneath the flying sphere of the _Chicago_.\r\n\r\n\"Going to have to circle at once, aren't you?\" Cleveland asked the chief\r\npilot. He had been watching that officer closely for minutes, admiring\r\nthe delicacy and precision with which the great vessel was being\r\nmaneuvered preliminary to entering the earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" the pilot replied. \"We had to come in in the shortest possible\r\ntime, and that meant a velocity here that we can't check without a\r\nspiral. However, even at that we saved a lot of time. You can save quite\r\na bit more, though, by having a rocket-plane come out to meet us\r\nsomewhere around fifteen or twenty thousand kilometers, depending upon\r\nwhere you want to land. With their power-to-mass ratio they can match\r\nour velocity and still make the drop direct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess I'll do that--thanks,\" and the operative called his chief, only\r\nto learn that his suggestion had already been acted upon.\r\n\r\n\"We beat you to it, Lyman,\" Samms smiled. \"The _Silver Sliver_ is out\r\nthere now, looping to match your course, acceleration, and velocity at\r\ntwenty-two thousand kilometers. You'll be ready to transfer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be ready!\" and the Quartermaster's ex-clerk went to his quarters\r\nand packed his dunnage-bag.\r\n\r\nIn due time the long, slender body of the rocket-plane came into view,\r\ncreeping 'down' upon the space-ship from 'above,' and Cleveland bade his\r\nfriends good-bye. Donning a space-suit, he stationed himself in the\r\nstarboard airlock. Its atmosphere was withdrawn, the outer door opened,\r\nand he glanced across a bare hundred feet of space at the rocket-plane\r\nwhich, keel ports fiercely aflame, was braking her terrific speed to\r\nmatch the slower pace of the gigantic ship of war. Shaped like a\r\ntoothpick, needle-pointed fore and aft, with ultra-stubby wings and\r\nvanes, with flush-set rocket ports everywhere, built of a lustrous\r\nsilvery alloy of noble and almost infusible metals--such was the private\r\nspeedboat of the chief of the T. S. S. The fastest thing known, whether\r\nin planetary air, the stratosphere, or the vacuus depth of\r\ninterplanetary space, her first flashing trial spins had won her the\r\nnickname of the _Silver Sliver_. She had had a more formal name, but\r\nthat title had long since been buried in the Departmental files.\r\n\r\nLower and slower dropped the _Silver Sliver_, her rockets flaming even\r\nbrighter, until her slender length lay level with the airlock door. Then\r\nher blasting discharges subsided to the power necessary to match exactly\r\nthe _Chicago_'s deceleration.\r\n\r\n\"Ready to cut, _Chicago_! Give me a three-second call!\" snapped from the\r\npilot room of the _Sliver_.\r\n\r\n\"Ready to cut!\" the pilot of the _Chicago_ replied. \"Seconds! Three!\r\nTwo! One! CUT!\"\r\n\r\nAt the last word the power of both vessels was instantly cut off and\r\neverything in them became weightless. In the tiny airlock of the slender\r\ncraft crouched a space-line man with coiled cable in readiness, but he\r\nwas not needed. As the flaring exhausts ceased Cleveland swung out his\r\nheavy bag and stepped lightly off into space, and in a right line he\r\nfloated directly into the open doorway of the rocket-plane. The door\r\nclanged shut behind him and in a matter of moments he stood in the\r\ncontrol room of the racer, divested of his armor and shaking hands with\r\nhis friend and co-laborer, Frederick Rodebush.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Fred, what do you know?\" Cleveland asked, as soon as greetings\r\nhad been exchanged. \"How do the various reports dovetail together? I\r\nknow that you couldn't tell me anything on the wave, but there's no\r\ndanger of eavesdroppers _here_.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't tell,\" Rodebush soberly replied. \"We're just beginning to\r\nwake up to the fact that there are a lot of things we don't know\r\nanything about. Better wait until we're back at the Hill. We have a full\r\nset of ultra-screens around there now. There's a couple of other good\r\nreasons, too--it would be better for both of us to go over the whole\r\nthing with Virgil, from the ground up; and we can't do any more talking,\r\nanyway. Our orders are to get back there at maximum, and you know what\r\nthat means aboard the _Sliver_. Strap yourself solid in that\r\nshock-absorber there, and here's a pair of ear-plugs.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the _Sliver_ really cuts loose it means a rough party, all right,\"\r\nCleveland assented, snapping about his body the heavy spring-straps of\r\nhis deeply cushioned seat, \"but I'm just as anxious to get back to the\r\nHill as anybody can be to get me there. All set.\"\r\n\r\nRodebush waved his hand at the pilot and the purring whisper of the\r\nexhausts changed instantly to a deafening, continuous explosion. The men\r\nwere pressed deeply into their shock-absorbing chairs as the _Silver\r\nSliver_ spun around her longitudinal axis and darted away from the\r\n_Chicago_ with such a tremendous acceleration that the spherical warship\r\nseemed to be standing still in space. In due time the calculated\r\nmid-point was reached, the slim space-plane rolled over again, and, mad\r\nacceleration now reversed, rushed on toward the earth, but with\r\nconstantly diminishing speed. Finally a measurable atmospheric pressure\r\nwas encountered, the needle prow dipped downward, and the _Silver\r\nSliver_ shot forward upon her tiny wings and vanes, nose-rockets now\r\ndrumming in staccato thunder. Her metal grew hot: dull red, bright red\r\nyellow, blinding white; but it neither melted nor burned. The pilot's\r\ncalculations had been sound, and though the limiting point of safety of\r\ntemperature was reached and steadily held, it was not exceeded. As the\r\ndensity of the air increased so decreased the velocity of the man-made\r\nmeteorite. So it was that a dazzling lance of fire sped high over\r\nSeattle, lower over Spokane, and hurled itself eastward, a furiously\r\nflaming arrow; slanting downward in a long, screaming dive toward the\r\nheart of the Rockies. As the now rapidly cooling greyhound of the skies\r\npassed over the western ranges of the Bitter Roots it became apparent\r\nthat her goal was a vast, flat-topped, and conical mountain, shrouded in\r\nlivid light; a mountain whose height awed even its stupendous neighbors.\r\n\r\nWhile not artificial, the Hill had been altered markedly by the\r\nTriplanetary engineers who had built into it the headquarters of the\r\nSecret Service. Its mile-wide top was a jointless expanse of gray armor\r\nsteel; the steep, smooth surface of the truncated cone was a\r\ncontinuation of the same immensely thick sheet of metal. No known\r\nvehicle could climb that smooth, hard, forbidding slope of steel; no\r\nknown projectile could mar that armor; no known craft could even\r\napproach the Hill without detection. Could not approach it at all, in\r\nfact, for it was constantly inclosed in a vast hemisphere of lambent\r\nviolet flame through which neither material substance nor destructive\r\nray could pass.\r\n\r\nAs the _Silver Sliver_, crawling along at a bare three-hundred miles an\r\nhour, approached that transparent, brilliantly violet wall of\r\ndestruction, a violet light filled her control room and as suddenly went\r\nout; flashing on and off again and again.\r\n\r\n\"Giving us the once-over, eh?\" Cleveland asked. \"That is something new,\r\nisn't it, Fred?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's a high-powered ultra-wave spy,\" Rodenbush returned. \"The\r\nlight is simply a warning, which can be carried if desired. It can also\r\ncarry voice and vision....\"\r\n\r\n\"Like this,\" Samms' voice interrupted from the powerful dynamic speaker\r\nupon the pilots' panel and his clear-cut face appeared upon the\r\ntelevision screen. \"I don't suppose Fred thought to mention it, but this\r\nis one of his inventions of the last few days. We are just trying it out\r\non you. It doesn't mean a thing though, as far as the _Sliver_ is\r\nconcerned. Come ahead!\"\r\n\r\nA circular opening appeared in the wall of force, an opening which\r\ndisappeared as soon as the plane had darted through it; and at the same\r\ntime her landing-cradle rose into the air through a great trap-door.\r\nSlowly and gracefully the space-plane settled downward into that\r\ncushioned embrace. Then cradle and nestled _Sliver_ sank from view and,\r\nturning smoothly upon mighty trunnions, the plug of armor drove solidly\r\nback into its place in the metal pavement of the mountain's lofty\r\nsummit. The cradle-elevator dropped rapidly, coming to rest many levels\r\ndown in the heart of the Hill, and Cleveland and Rodebush leaped lightly\r\nout of their transport, through her still hot outer walls. A door opened\r\nbefore them and they found themselves in a large room of full daylight\r\nillumination; the anteroom of the private office of Virgil Samms. Chiefs\r\nof Departments sat at their desks, concentrated upon problems or at\r\nease, according to the demands of the moment; televisotypes and\r\nrecorders flashed busily but silently; calmly efficient men and women\r\nwent wontedly about the all-embracing business of Triplanetary's\r\nspace-pervading Secret Service.\r\n\r\n\"Right of way, Norma?\" Rodebush paused briefly before the desk of the\r\nChief's private secretary; but even before he had spoken she had pressed\r\na button and the door behind her swung wide.\r\n\r\n\"You two do not need to be announced,\" the attractive young woman\r\nsmiled. \"Go right in.\"\r\n\r\nSamms met them at the door eagerly, shaking hands particularly\r\nvigorously with Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations on that camera, Lyman!\" he exclaimed. \"You did a\r\nwonderful piece of work on that. Help yourselves to smokes and sit\r\ndown--there are a lot of things we want to talk over. Your pictures\r\ncarried most of the story, but they would have left us pretty much at\r\nsea without Costigan's reports. But as it was, Fred here and his crew\r\nworked out most of the answers from the dope the two of you got; and\r\nwhat few they haven't got yet they soon will have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing new on Conway?\" Cleveland was almost afraid to ask the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"No.\" A shadow came over Samms' face. \"I'm afraid ... but I'm hoping\r\nit's only that those creatures, whatever they are, have taken him so far\r\naway that he can't reach us.\"\r\n\r\n\"They certainly are so far away that we can't reach them.\" Rodenbush\r\nvolunteered. \"We can't even get their ultra-wave interference any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's a hopeful sign,\" Samms went on. \"I hate to think of Conway\r\nCostigan checking out. There, fellows, was a real observer. He was the\r\nonly man, I have ever known, who combined the two qualities of the\r\nperfect witness. He could actually see everything he looked at, and\r\ncould report it truly, to the last, least detail. Take all this stuff,\r\nfor instance; especially their ability to transform iron into a fluid\r\nallotrope, and in that form to use its intra-atomic energy as power.\r\nSomething brand new--unheard of except in the ravings of imaginative\r\nfiction--and yet he described their converters and projectors so\r\nminutely that Fred was able to work out the underlying theory in three\r\ndays, and to tie it in with our own super-ship. My first thought was\r\nthat we'd have to rebuild it iron-free, but Fred showed me my error--you\r\nfound it first yourself, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't do any good to make the ship non-ferrous unless you could\r\nso change our blood chemistry that we could get along without\r\nhemoglobin, and that would be quite a feat,\" Cleveland agreed. \"Then,\r\ntoo, our most vital electrical machinery is built around iron cores. No,\r\nwe'll have to develop a screen for those forces--screens, rather, so\r\npowerful that they can't drive anything through them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've been working along those lines ever since you reported,\" Rodebush\r\nsaid, \"and we're beginning to see light. And in that same connection\r\nit's no wonder that we couldn't handle our super-ship. We had some good\r\nideas, but they were wrongly applied. However, things look quite\r\npromising now. We have that transformation of iron all worked out in\r\ntheory, and as soon as we get a generator going we can straighten out\r\neverything else in short order. And think what that unlimited power\r\nmeans! All the power we want--power enough even to try out such hitherto\r\npurely theoretical possibilities as the neutralization of gravity, and\r\neven of the inertia of matter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" protested Samms. \"You certainly can't do _that_! Inertia\r\nis--_must_ be--a basic attribute of matter, and surely cannot be done\r\naway with without destroying the matter itself. Don't start anything\r\nlike that. Fred--I don't want to lose you and Lyman, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about us, Chief.\" Rodebush replied with a smile. \"If you\r\nwill tell me what matter is, fundamentally, I may agree with you ... No?\r\nWell, then, don't be surprised at anything that happens. We are going to\r\ndo a lot of things that nobody ever thought of doing before.\"\r\n\r\nThus for a long time the argument and discussion went on, to be\r\ninterrupted by the voice of the secretary.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Samms, but some things have come up that you\r\nwill have to handle. Knobos is calling from out near Mars. He has caught\r\nthe _Endymion_, and has killed about half her crew doing it. Milton has\r\nfinally reported from Venus, after being out of touch for five days. He\r\ntrailed the Wintons into Thalleron swamp. They crashed him there, but he\r\nwon out and has what he went after. And just now I got a flash from\r\nFletcher, in the asteroid belt. I think that he has finally traced that\r\ndope line. But Knobos is on now--what do you want him to do about the\r\n_Endymion_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to--no, put him on here, I'd better tell him myself,\" Samms\r\ndirected, and his face hardened in ruthless decision as the horny,\r\nmisshapen face of the Martian lieutenant appeared upon the screen. \"What\r\ndo you think, Knobos? Shall they come to trial or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, either. It is better that a few gangsters should\r\ndisappear in space than run the risk of another uprising. See to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right.\" The screen darkened and Samms spoke to his secretary. \"Put\r\nMilton and Fletcher on whenever their rays come in.\" He then turned to\r\nhis guests. \"We've covered the ground quite thoroughly. Good-bye--I wish\r\nI could go with you, but I'll be pretty well tied up for the next week\r\nor two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tied up, doesn't half express it,\" Rodebush remarked as the two\r\nscientists walked along a corridor toward an elevator. \"He probably is\r\nthe busiest man on the three planets.\"\r\n\r\n\"As well as the most powerful,\" Cleveland supplemented. \"And very few\r\nmen could use his power as fairly--but he's welcome to it, as far as I'm\r\nconcerned. I'd have the pink fantods for a month if I had to do only\r\nonce what he's just done--and to him it's just part of a day's work.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the _Endymion_? What else could he do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing--that's just what I'm talking about. It had to be done, since\r\nbringing them to trial would probably mean killing half the people of\r\nMorseca; but at the same time it's a ghastly thing to have to order a\r\njob of deliberate, cold-blooded, and illegal murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, of course, but you would....\" he broke off, unable to put\r\nhis thoughts into words. For while inarticulate, manlike, concerning\r\ntheir deepest emotions, in both men was ingrained the code of their\r\norganization; both knew that to every man chosen for it _The Service_\r\nwas everything, himself nothing.\r\n\r\n\"But enough of that, we'll have plenty of grief of our own right here,\"\r\nRodebush changed the subject abruptly as they stepped into a vast room,\r\nalmost filled by the immense bulk of the _Boise_--the sinister\r\nspace-ship which, although never flown, had already lined with black so\r\nmany pages of Triplanetary's roster. She was now, however, the center of\r\na furious activity. Men swarmed over her and through her, in the orderly\r\nconfusion of a fiercely driven but carefully planned program of\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\n\"I hope your dope is right, Fred!\" Cleveland called, as the two\r\nscientists separated to go to their respective laboratories. \"If it is,\r\nwe'll make a perfect lady out of this unmanageable man-killer yet!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n  The Super-Ship Is Launched\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of ceaseless work, during which was lavished upon her every\r\nresource of mind and material afforded by three planets, the _Boise_ was\r\nready for her maiden flight. As nearly ready, that is, as the thought\r\nand labor of man could make her. Rodebush and Cleveland had finished\r\ntheir last rigid inspection of the craft and, standing beside the center\r\ndoor of the main airlock, were talking with their chief.\r\n\r\n\"You say that you think that it's safe, and yet you won't take a crew,\"\r\nSamms argued. \"In that case it isn't safe enough for you men, either. We\r\nneed you too badly to permit you to take such chances.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've _got_ to let us go; because we are the only ones who are\r\nthoroughly familiar with her theory,\" Rodebush insisted. \"I said, and\r\nstill say, that I _think_ it is safe. I can't prove it, however, except\r\nmathematically; because she's altogether too full of too many new and\r\nuntried mechanisms, too many extrapolations beyond all existing or\r\npossible data. Theoretically, she is sound, but you know that theory can\r\ngo only so far, and that mathematically negligible factors may become\r\noperative at those velocities. We do not need a crew for a short trip.\r\nWe can take care of any minor mishaps, and if our fundamental theories\r\nare wrong, all the crews between here and Jupiter wouldn't do any good.\r\nTherefore we two are going--alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be very careful, anyway. Start out slow and take it easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Start out slow? We can't! We can't neutralize half of gravity, nor half\r\nof the inertia of matter--it's got to be everything or nothing, as soon\r\nas the neutralizers go on. We could start out on the projectors, of\r\ncourse, instead of on the neutralizers, but that wouldn't prove anything\r\nand would only prolong the agony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, be as careful as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll do that, Chief,\" Cleveland put in. \"We think a lot of us, and we\r\naren't committing suicide just yet if we can help it. And remember about\r\neverybody staying inside when we take off--it's barely possible that\r\nwe'll take up a lot of room. Good-bye to all of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, fellows!\"\r\n\r\nThe massive insulating doors were shut, the metal side of the mountain\r\nopened, and huge, squat caterpillar tractors came roaring and clanking\r\ninto the room. Chains and cables were made fast and, mighty steel rails\r\ngroaning under the load, the space-ship upon her rolling ways was\r\ndragged out of the Hill and far out upon the level floor of the surface\r\nbefore the tractors cast off and returned to the fortress.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody is under cover.\" Samms informed Rodebush. The chief was\r\nstaring intently into his plate, upon which was revealed the control\r\nroom of the untried super-ship. He heard Rodebush speak to Cleveland;\r\nheard the observer's brief reply; saw the navigator throw his\r\nswitches--then the communicator plate went blank. Not the ordinary\r\nblankness of a cut-off, but a peculiarly disquieting fading out into\r\ndarkness. And where the great space-ship had rested there was for an\r\ninstant nothing. Exactly nothing--a vacuum. Vessel, falsework, rollers,\r\ntrucks, the enormous steel I-beams of the tracks, even the deep-set\r\nconcrete piers and foundations and a vast hemisphere of the solid\r\nground; all had disappeared utterly and instantaneously. But almost as\r\nsuddenly as it had been formed the vacuum was filled by a cyclonic rush\r\nof air. There was a detonation as of a hundred vicious thunderclaps made\r\none, and, through the howling, shrieking blasts of wind, there rained\r\ndown upon the valley, plain and metaled mountain a veritable avalanche\r\nof debris: bent, twisted, and broken rails and beams, splintered\r\ntimbers, masses of concrete, and thousands of cubic yards of soil and\r\nrock. For inertia and gravitation had not been neutralized at precisely\r\nthe same instant, and for a moment everything within the radius of\r\naction of the iron-driven gravity nullifiers of the _Boise_ had\r\ncontinued its absolute motion with inertia unimpaired. Then, left behind\r\nimmediately by the almost infinite velocity of the cruiser, all this\r\nmaterial had again become subject to all of Nature's everyday laws and\r\nhad crashed back to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Could you hold your beam, Randolph?\" Samm's voice cut sharply through\r\nthe daze of stupefaction which held spellbound most of the denizens of\r\nthe Hill. But all were not so held--no conceivable emergency could take\r\nthe attention of the chief ultra-wave operator from his instruments.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" Radio Center shot back. \"It faded out and I couldn't recover\r\nit. I put everything I've got behind a tracer on that beam, but haven't\r\nbeen able to lift a single needle off the pin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no wreckage of the vessel itself,\" Samms went on, half audibly.\r\n\"Either they have succeeded far beyond their wildest hopes or else ...\r\nmore probably....\" He fell silent and switched off the plate. Were his\r\ntwo friends, those intrepid scientists, alive and triumphant, or had\r\nthey gone to lengthen the list of victims of that man-killing\r\nspace-ship? Reason told him that they were gone. They _must be_ gone, or\r\nelse his ultra-beams--energies of such unthinkable velocity of\r\npropagation that man's most sensitive instruments had never been able\r\neven to estimate it--would have held the ship's transmitter in spite of\r\nany velocity attainable by any matter under any conceivable conditions.\r\nThe ship must have been disintegrated as soon as Rodebush released his\r\nforces. And yet, had not the physicist dimly foreseen the possibility of\r\nsuch an actual velocity--or had he? However, individuals could came and\r\ncould go, but Triplanetary went on. Samms squared his shoulders\r\nunconsciously, and slowly, grimly, made his way back to his private\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nHe had scant time to mourn. Scarcely had he seated himself at his desk\r\nwhen an emergency call came snapping in; a call of such import that his\r\nsecretary's usually calm voice trembled as she put it on his plate.\r\n\r\n\"Commissioner Hinkle is calling, sir,\" she announced. \"Something\r\nterrible is going on again, out toward Orion. Here he is,\" and there\r\nappeared upon the screen the face of the Commissioner of Public Safety,\r\nthe commander of Triplanetary's every armed force--whether of land or of\r\nwater, of air or of empty space.\r\n\r\n\"They've come back, Samms!\" the Commissioner rapped out, without\r\npreliminary or greeting. \"Four vessels gone--a freighter and a passenger\r\nliner, with her escort of two heavy cruisers. All in Sector M; Dx about\r\n151. I have ordered all traffic out of space for the duration of the\r\nemergency, and since even our warships seem useless, every ship is\r\nmaking for the nearest dock at maximum. How about that new flyer of\r\nyours--got anything that will do us any good?\" No one beyond the\r\n\"Hill's\" shielding screens knew that the _Boise_ had already been\r\nlaunched.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. We don't even know whether we have a super-ship or not,\"\r\nand Samms described briefly the beginning--and very probably the\r\nending--of the trial flight, concluding: \"It looks bad, but if there was\r\nany possible way of handling her, Rodebush and Cleveland did it. All our\r\ntracers are negative yet, so nothing definite has....\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off as a frantic call came in from the Pittsburgh station for\r\nthe Commissioner, a call which Samms both heard and saw.\r\n\r\n\"The city is being attacked!\" came the urgent message. \"We need all the\r\nreinforcements you can send us!\" and a picture of the beleaguered city\r\nappeared in ghastly detail upon the screens of the observers; a view\r\nbeing recorded from the air. It required only seconds for the\r\ncommissioner to order every available man and engine of war to the seat\r\nof conflict; then, having done everything they could, Hinkle and Samms\r\nstared in helpless, fascinated horror into their plates, watching the\r\nscenes of carnage and destruction depicted there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Nevian vessel--the sister-ship, the craft which Costigan had seen in\r\nmid-space as it hurtled earthward in response to Nerado's summons--hung\r\npoised in full visibility, high above the metropolis. Scornful of the\r\npitiful weapons wielded by man she hung there, her sinister beauty of\r\nline sharply defined against the cloudless sky. From her shining hull\r\nthere reached down a tenuous but rigid rod of crimson energy; a rod\r\nwhich slowly swept hither and thither as the detectors of the amphibians\r\nsearched out the richest deposits of the precious iron for which the\r\ninhuman visitors had come so far. Iron, once solid, now a viscous red\r\nliquid, was sluggishly flowing in an ever-thickening stream up that\r\nintangible crimson duct and into the capacious storage tanks of the\r\nNevian raider; and wherever that flaming beam went there went also ruin,\r\ndestruction, and death. Office buildings, skyscrapers towering\r\nmajestically in their architectural symmetry and beauty, collapsed into\r\nheaps of debris as their steel skeletons were abstracted. Deep into the\r\nground the beam bored; flood, fire, and explosion following in its wake\r\nas the mazes of underground piping disappeared. And the humanity of the\r\nbuildings died: instantaneously and painlessly, never knowing what\r\nstruck them, as the life-bearing iron of their bodies went to swell the\r\nNevian stream.\r\n\r\nPittsburgh's defenses had been feeble indeed. A few antiquated railway\r\nrifles had hurled their shells upward in futile defiance, and had been\r\nquietly absorbed. The district planes of Triplanetary, newly armed with\r\niron-driven ultra-beams, had assembled hurriedly and had attacked the\r\ninvader in formation, with but little more success. Under the impact of\r\ntheir beams the stranger's screens had flared white, then poised ship\r\nand flying squadron alike had been lost to view in a murkily opaque\r\nshroud of crimson flame. The cloud had soon dissolved, and from the\r\nplace where the planes had been there had floated or crashed down a\r\nlitter of non-ferrous wreckage. And now the cone of space-ships from the\r\nBuffalo base of Triplanetary was approaching Pittsburgh, hurling itself\r\ntoward the Nevian plunderer and toward known, gruesome and hopeless\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n\"Stop them, Hinkle!\" Samms cried. \"It's sheer slaughter! They haven't\r\ngot a thing--they aren't even equipped yet with the iron drive!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" the commissioner groaned, \"and Admiral Barnes knows it as\r\nwell as we do, but it can't be helped--wait a minute! The Washington\r\ncone is reporting. They're as close as the other, and they have the new\r\narmament. Philadelphia is close behind, and so is New York. Now perhaps\r\nwe can do something!\"\r\n\r\nThe Buffalo flotilla slowed and stopped, and in a matter of minutes the\r\ndetachments from the other bases arrived. The cone was formed and\r\niron-driven vessels in the van, the old-type craft far in the rear, it\r\nbore down upon the Nevian, vomiting from its hollow front a solid\r\ncylinder of annihilation. Once more the screens of the Nevian flared\r\ninto brilliance, once more the red cloud of destruction was flung\r\nabroad. But these vessels were not entirely defenseless. Their\r\niron-driven ultra-generators threw out screens of the Nevians' own\r\nformulae, screens of prodigious power to which the energies of the\r\namphibians clung and at which they clawed and tore in baffled, wildly\r\ncoruscant displays of power unthinkable. For minutes the furious\r\nconflict raged, while the inconceivable energy being dissipated by those\r\nstraining screens hurled itself in terribly destructive bolts of\r\nlightning upon the city far beneath.\r\n\r\nNo battle of such incredible violence could long endure. Triplanetary's\r\nships were already exerting their utmost power, while the Nevians,\r\ncontemptuous of Solarian science, had not yet uncovered their full\r\nstrength. Thus the last desperate effort of mankind was proved futile as\r\nthe invaders forced their beams deeper and deeper into the overloaded,\r\ndefensive screens of the war-vessels; and one by one the supposedly\r\ninvincible space-ships of humanity dropped in horribly dismembered\r\nwreckage upon the ruins of what had once been Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n  Specimens\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly too well founded was Costigan's conviction that the submarine of\r\nthe deep-sea fishes had not been able to prevail against Nerado's\r\nformidable engines of destruction. For days the Nevian lifeboat with its\r\nthree Terrestrial passengers hurtled through the interstellar void\r\nwithout incident, but finally the operative's fears were realized--his\r\nfar-flung detector screens reacted; upon his observation plate lay\r\nrevealed Nerado's mammoth space-ship, in full pursuit of its fleeing\r\nlifeboat!\r\n\r\n\"On your toes, folks--it won't be long now!\" Costigan called, and\r\nBradley and Clio hurried into the tiny control room.\r\n\r\nArmor donned and tested, the three Terrestrials stared into the\r\nobservation plates, watching the rapidly enlarging pictures of the\r\nNevian space-ship. Nerado had traced them and was following them, and\r\nsuch was the power of the great vessel that the nearly inconceivable\r\nvelocity of the lifeboat was the veriest crawl in comparison to that of\r\nthe pursuing cruiser.\r\n\r\n\"And we've hardly started to cover the distance back to Tellus. Of\r\ncourse you couldn't get in touch with anybody yet?\" Bradley stated,\r\nrather than asked.\r\n\r\n\"I kept on trying until they blanketed my wave, but all negative.\r\nThousands of times too far for my transmitter. Our only hope of reaching\r\nanybody was the mighty slim chance that our super-ship might be prowling\r\naround out here already, but it isn't, of course. Here they are!\"\r\n\r\nReaching out to the control panel, Costigan shot out against the great\r\nvessel wave after wave of lethal vibrations, under whose fiercely\r\nclinging impacts the Nevian defensive screens flared white; but,\r\nstrangely enough, their own screens did not radiate. As if contemptuous\r\nof any weapons the lifeboat might wield, the mother ship simply defended\r\nherself from the attacking beams, in much the same fashion as a wildcat\r\nmother wards off the claws and teeth of her spitting, snarling kitten\r\nwho is resenting a touch of needed maternal discipline.\r\n\r\n\"They probably won't fight us, at that,\" Clio first understood the\r\nsituation. \"This is their own lifeboat, and they want us alive, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's one more thing we can try--hang on!\" Costigan snapped, as he\r\nreleased his screens and threw all his power into one enormous pressor\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\nThe three were thrown to the floor and held there by an awful weight, as\r\nif the lifeboat darted away at the stupendous acceleration of the beam's\r\nreaction against the unimaginable mass of the Nevian sky-rover; but the\r\nflight was of short duration. Along that pressor beam there crept a dull\r\nrod of energy, which surrounded the fugitive shell and brought it slowly\r\nto a halt. Furiously then Costigan set and reset his controls, launching\r\nhis every driving force and his every weapon, but no beam could\r\npenetrate that red murk, and the lifeboat remained motionless in space.\r\nNo, not motionless--the red rod was shortening, drawing the truant craft\r\nback toward the launching port from which she had so hopefully emerged a\r\nfew days before. Back and back it was drawn; Costigan's utmost efforts\r\nfutile to affect by a hair's breadth its line of motion. Through the\r\nopen port the boat slipped neatly, and as it came to a halt in its\r\noriginal position within the multilayered skin of the monster, the\r\nprisoners heard the heavy doors clang shut behind them, one after\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAnd then sheets of blue fire snapped and crackled all about the three\r\nsuits of Triplanetary armor--the two large human figures and the small\r\none were outlined starkly in blinding blue flame.\r\n\r\n\"That's the first thing that has come off according to schedule.\"\r\nCostigan laughed, a short, fierce bark. \"That is their paralyzing ray;\r\nwe've got it stopped cold, and we've each got enough iron to hold it\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it looks as though the best we can do is to stalemate,\" Bradley\r\nargued. \"Even if they can't paralyze us, we can't hurt them, and we are\r\nheading back for Nevia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Nerado will come in for a conference, and we'll be able to make\r\nterms of some kind. He must know what these Lewistons will do, and he\r\nknows that we'll get a chance to use them, some way or other, before he\r\ngets to us again,\" Costigan asserted confidently--but again he was\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and through it there waddled, rolled, or crawled a\r\nmetal-clad monstrosity--a thing with wheels, legs, and writhing\r\ntentacles of jointed bronze; a thing possessed of defensive screens\r\nsufficiently powerful to absorb the full blast of the Triplanetary\r\nprojectors without effort. Three brazen tentacles reached out through\r\nthe ravening beams of the Lewistons, smashed them to bits, and wrapped\r\nthemselves in unbreakable shackles about the armored forms of the three\r\nhuman beings. Through the door the machine or creature carried its\r\nhelpless load, and out into and along a main corridor. And soon the\r\nthree Terrestrials, without armor, without arms, and almost without\r\nclothing, were standing in the control room, again facing the calm and\r\nunmoved Nerado. To the surprise of the impetuous Costigan, the Nevian\r\ncommander was entirely without rancor.\r\n\r\n\"The desire for freedom is perhaps common to all forms of animate life,\"\r\nhe commented, through the transformer. \"As I told you before, however,\r\nyou are specimens to be studied by the College of Science, and you shall\r\nbe so studied in spite of anything you may do. Resign yourselves to\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, say that we don't try to make any more trouble; that we\r\nco-operate in the examination and give you whatever information we can,\"\r\nCostigan suggested. \"Then you will probably be willing to give us a ship\r\nand let us go back to our own world?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not be allowed to cause any more trouble,\" the amphibian\r\ndeclared, coldly. \"Your co-operation will not be required. We will take\r\nfrom you whatever knowledge and information we wish. In all probability\r\nyou will never be allowed to return to your own system, because as\r\nspecimens you are too unique to lose. But enough of this idle\r\nchatter--take them back to their quarters!\"\r\n\r\nAnd back to their inter-communicating rooms the prisoners were led under\r\nheavy guard.\r\n\r\nTrue to his word, Nerado made certain that they had no more\r\nopportunities to escape. All the way back to far-distant Nevia the\r\nspace-ship sped, where at once, in manacles, the Terrestrials were taken\r\nto the College of Science, there to undergo the physical and psychical\r\nexaminations which Nerado had promised them.\r\n\r\nClio and Costigan learned that the Nevian scientist-captain had not\r\nerred in stating that their co-operation was neither needed nor desired.\r\nFurious but impotent, the human beings were studied in laboratory after\r\nlaboratory by the coldly analytical, unfeeling scientists of Nevia, to\r\nwhom they were nothing more nor less than specimens; and in full measure\r\nthey came to know what it meant to play the part of an unknown, lowly\r\norganism in a biological research. They were photographed, externally\r\nand internally. Every bone, muscle, organ, vessel, and nerve was studied\r\nand charted. Every reflex and reaction was noted and discussed. Meters\r\nregistered every impulse and recorders filmed every thought, every idea,\r\nand every sensation. Endlessly, day after day, the nerve-wracking\r\ntorture went on, until the frantic subjects could bear no more.\r\nWhite-faced and shaking, Clio finally screamed wildly, hysterically, as\r\nshe was being strapped down upon a laboratory bench; and at the sound\r\nCostigan's nerves, already at the breaking point, gave way in an\r\noutburst of Berserk fury.\r\n\r\nThe man's struggles and the girl's shrieks were alike futile, but the\r\nsurprised Nevians, after a consultation, decided to give the specimens a\r\nvacation. To that end they were installed, together with their earthly\r\nbelongings, in a three-roomed structure of transparent metal, floating\r\nin the large central lagoon of the city. There they were left\r\nundisturbed for a time--undisturbed, that is, except by the continuous\r\ngaze of the crowd of hundreds of amphibians which constantly surrounded\r\nthe floating cottage.\r\n\r\n\"First we're bugs under a microscope,\" Bradley growled, \"then we're\r\ngoldfish in a bowl. I don't know that....\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off as two of their jailers entered the room. Without a word\r\ninto the transformers, they seized Bradley and the girl. As those\r\ntentacular arms stretched out toward Clio, Costigan leaped. A vain\r\nattempt. In midair the paralyzing ray of the Nevians touched him and he\r\ncrashed heavily to the crystal floor; and from that floor he looked on\r\nin helpless, raging fury while his sweetheart and his captain were\r\ncarried out of their prison and into a waiting submarine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n  The _Boise_ Acts\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what of the super-ship? What happened after that inertialess, that\r\nterribly destructive take-off?\r\n\r\nDoctor Frederick Rodebush sat at the control panel of Triplanetary's\r\nnewly reconstructed space-ship, his hands grasping the gleaming, ebonite\r\nhandles of two double-throw switches. Facing the unknown though the\r\nphysicist was, yet he grinned whimsically at his friend.\r\n\r\n\"Something, whatever it is, is about to take place. The _Boise_ is\r\ntaking off, under full neutralization. Ready for anything to happen,\r\nCleve?\"\r\n\r\n\"All ready--shoot!\" Laconically. Cleveland also was constitutionally\r\nunable to voice his deeper sentiments in time of stress.\r\n\r\nRodebush flipped the switches clear over in flashing arcs, and instantly\r\nover both men there came a sensation akin to a tremendously intensified\r\nvertigo; but a vertigo as far beyond the space-sickness of\r\nweightlessness, as that horrible sensation is beyond mere terrestrial\r\ndizziness. The pilot tried to reverse the switches he had just thrown,\r\nbut his leaden hands utterly refused to obey the dictates of his reeling\r\nmind. His brain was a writhing, convulsive mass of torment\r\nindescribable; expanding, exploding, swelling out with an unendurable\r\npressure against its confining skull. Fiery spirals, laced with\r\nstreaming, darting lances of black and green, flamed inside his bursting\r\neyeballs. The Universe spun and whirled in mad gyrations about him as he\r\nreeled drunkenly to his feet, staggering and sprawling. He fell. He\r\nrealized that he was falling, yet he could not fall! Thrashing wildly,\r\ngrotesquely in agony, he struggled madly and blindly across the room,\r\ndirectly toward the thick steel wall. The tip of one hair of his unruly\r\nthatch touched the wall, and the slim length of that single hair did not\r\neven bend as its slight strength brought to an instant halt the\r\nhundred-and-eighty-odd pounds of mass--mass now entirely without\r\ninertia--that was his body.\r\n\r\nBut finally the sheer brain power of the man began to triumph over his\r\nphysical torture. By indomitable force of will he compelled his groping\r\nhands to seize a life-line, almost meaningless to his dazed\r\nintelligence; and through that nightmare incarnate of hellish torture he\r\nfought his way back to the control board. Hooking one leg around a\r\nstandard, he made a seemingly enormous effort and drove the two switches\r\nback into their original positions; then fell flat upon the floor,\r\nweakly but in a wave of relief and thankfulness, as his racked body felt\r\nagain the wonted phenomena of weight and of inertia. White, trembling,\r\nfrankly and openly sick, the two men stared at each other in half-amazed\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\"It worked.\" Cleveland smiled wanly as he recovered sufficiently to\r\nspeak, then leaped to his feet. \"Snap it up, Fred! We must be falling\r\nfast--we'll be wrecked when we hit!\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not falling anywhere.\" Rodebush, foreboding in his eyes, walked\r\nover to the main observation plate and scanned the heavens. \"However,\r\nit's not as bad as I was afraid it might be. I can still recognize a few\r\nof the constellations, even though they are all pretty badly distorted.\r\nThat means that we can't be more than a couple of light-years or so away\r\nfrom the Solar System. Of course, since we had so little thrust on,\r\npractically all of our time and energy was spent in getting out of the\r\natmosphere; but, even at that, it's a good thing that space isn't an\r\nabsolutely perfect vacuum or we would have been clear out of the\r\nUniverse by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh? Impossible--where are we anyway? Then we must be making mil ...\r\nOh, I see!\" Cleveland exclaimed in disjointed sentences as he also\r\nstared into the plate.\r\n\r\n\"Right. We aren't traveling at all _now_.\" Rodebush replied. \"We are\r\nperfectly stationary relative to Tellus, since we made the hop without\r\ninertia. We must have attained one hundred percent neutralization, which\r\nwe didn't quite expect, and therefore we must have stopped\r\ninstantaneously when our inertia was restored. But it isn't _where_ we\r\nare that is worrying me the most--we can fix our place in space\r\naccurately enough by a few observations--it's _when_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, too. Say we're two light-years away. You think maybe\r\nwe're two years older than we were ten minutes ago, then? That's\r\npossible, of course, maybe probable: there's been a lot of discussion on\r\nthat theory. Now's a good time to prove or to disprove it. Let's snap\r\nback to Tellus and find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll do that, after a little more experimenting. You see, I had no\r\nintention of giving us such a long push. I was going to throw the\r\nswitches over and back, but you know what happened. However, there's one\r\ngood thing about it--it's worth two years of anybody's life to settle\r\nthat relativity-time thing definitely, one way or the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say it is. But say, we've got a lot of power on our ultra-wave:\r\nenough to reach Tellus, I think. Let's locate the sun and get in touch\r\nwith Samms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's work on these controls a little first, so we'll have something to\r\nreport. Out here's a fine place to try the ship out--nothing in the\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right with me. But I _would_ like to find out whether I'm two years\r\nolder than I think I am, or not!\"\r\n\r\nThen for hours they put the great super-ship through her paces, just as\r\ntest-pilots check up on every detail of performance of an airplane of\r\nnew and radical design. They found that the horrible vertigo could be\r\nendured, perhaps in time even conquered as space-sickness could be\r\nconquered, by a strong will in a sound body; and that their new\r\nconveyance had possibilities of which even Rodebush had never dreamed.\r\nFinally, their most pressing questions answered, they turned their most\r\npowerful ultra-beam communicator toward the yellowish star which they\r\nknew to be Old Sol.\r\n\r\n\"Samms ... Samms.\" Cleveland spoke slowly and distinctly. \"Rodebush and\r\nCleveland reporting from the 'Space-Eating Wampus', now directly in line\r\nwith Beta Ursae Minoris from the sun, distance about two point two light\r\nyears. It will take six banks of tubes on your tightest beam, LSV3, to\r\nreach us. Barring a touch of an unusually severe type of space-sickness,\r\neverything worked beautifully; even better than our calculations showed.\r\nThere's something we want to know right away--have we been gone four\r\nhours and some odd minutes, or better than two years?\"\r\n\r\nHe shut off the power, turned to Rodebush, and went on:\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows how fast this ultra-wave travels, but if it goes as fast\r\nas we did coming out it's certainly moving. I'll give him about thirty\r\nminutes, then shoot in another call.\"\r\n\r\nBut in less than two minutes the care-ravaged face of their chief\r\nappeared sharp and clear upon their plates and his voice snapped curtly\r\nfrom the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God you're alive, and twice that the ship works!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\"You've been gone four hours, eleven minutes, and forty-one seconds, but\r\nnever mind about abstract theorizing. Get back here, to Pittsburgh, as\r\nfast as you can drive. That Nevian vessel or another like her is mopping\r\nup the city, and has destroyed half the Fleet already!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be back there in nine minutes!\" Rodebush snapped into the\r\ntransmitter. \"Two to get from here to atmosphere, four from atmosphere\r\ndown to the Hill, and three to cool off. Notify the full four-shift\r\ncrew--everybody we've picked out. Don't need anybody else. Ship,\r\nbatteries, and armament are _ready_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Two minutes to atmosphere, and it took ten coming out? Think you can do\r\nit?\" Cleveland asked, as Rodebush flipped off the power and leaped to\r\nthe control panel.\r\n\r\n\"We could do it in a few seconds if we had to. We used scarcely any\r\npower at all coming out, and I'm not using very much going back,\" the\r\nphysicist explained rapidly, as he set the dials which would determine\r\ntheir flashing course.\r\n\r\nThe master switches were thrown and the pangs of inertialessness again\r\nassailed them--but weaker far this time than ever before--and upon their\r\nlookout plates they beheld a spectacle never before seen by eye of man.\r\nFor the ultra-beam, with its heterodyned vision, is not distorted by any\r\nvelocity yet attained, as are the ether-borne rays of light. Converted\r\ninto light only at the plate, it showed their progress as truly as\r\nthough they had been traveling at a pace to be expressed in the ordinary\r\nterms of miles per hour. The yellow star that was the sun detached\r\nitself from the firmament and leaped toward them, swelling visibly,\r\nmomentarily, into a blinding monster of incandescence. And toward them\r\nalso flung the earth, enlarging with such indescribable rapidity that\r\nCleveland protested involuntarily, in spite of his knowledge of the\r\npeculiar mechanism of the vessel in which they were.\r\n\r\n\"Hold it, Fred, hold it! Way 'nuff!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm using only ten thousand dynes, so she'll stop herself as soon as we\r\ntouch atmosphere, long before she can even begin to heat,\" Rodebush\r\nexplained. \"Looks bad, but we'll stop without a jar.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they did. Weightless and without inertia, gravitation powerless\r\nagainst her neutralizing generators, the great super-ship came from her\r\npractically infinite velocity to an almost instantaneous halt in the\r\noutermost, most tenuous layer of the earth's atmosphere. Her halt was\r\nbut momentary. Inertia restored and gravitation allowed again to affect\r\nher mass, she dropped at a sharp angle downward. More than dropped; she\r\nwas forced downward by one full battery of projectors; projectors driven\r\nby iron-powered generators. Soon they were over the Hill, whose violet\r\nscreens went down at a word.\r\n\r\nFlaming a dazzling white from the friction of the atmosphere through\r\nwhich she had torn her way, the _Boise_ slowed abruptly as she neared\r\nthe ground, plunging toward the surface of the small but deep artificial\r\nlake below the Hill's steel apron. Into the cold waters the space-ship\r\ndove, and even before they could close over her, furious geysers of\r\nsteam and boiling water erupted as the stubborn alloy gave up its heat\r\nto the cooling liquid. Endlessly the three necessary minutes dragged\r\ntheir slow way into time, but finally the water ceased boiling and\r\nRodebush tore the ship from the lake and hurled her into the gaping\r\ndoorway of her dock. The massive doors of the air-locks opened, and\r\nwhile the full crew of picked men hurried aboard with their personal\r\nequipment, Samms talked earnestly to the two scientists in the control\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\" ... and about half the fleet is still in the air. They aren't\r\nattacking; they are just trying to keep her from doing much more damage\r\nuntil you can get there. How about your take-off? We can't launch you\r\nagain--the tracks are gone--but you handled her easily enough coming\r\nin?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was all my fault,\" Rodebush admitted. \"I should have neutralized\r\ninertia first, but I had no idea that the fields would extend beyond the\r\nhull, nor that they wouldn't act simultaneously. We'll take her out on\r\nthe projectors this time, though, the same as we brought her in--she\r\nhandles like a bicycle. The projector blast tears things up a little,\r\nbut nothing serious. Have you got that Pittsburgh beam for me yet? We're\r\nabout ready to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is, Doctor Rodebush,\" came the secretary's voice, and upon the\r\nscreen there flashed into being the view of the events transpiring above\r\nthat doomed city. \"The dock is empty and sealed against your blast,\" and\r\nthereupon \"Good-bye, and power to your tubes!\" came Samms' ringing\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nAs the words were being spoken, mighty blasts of power raved from the\r\ndriving projectors and the immense mass of the super-ship shot out\r\nthrough the portals and upward into the stratosphere. Through the\r\ntenuous atmosphere the huge ship rushed with ever-mounting speed, and\r\nwhile the hope of Triplanetary drove eastward Rodebush studied the\r\never-changing scene of battle upon his plate and issued detailed\r\ninstructions to the highly trained specialists manning every offensive\r\nand defensive weapon.\r\n\r\nBut the Nevians did not wait to join battle until the newcomers arrived.\r\nTheir detectors were sensitive--operative over untold thousands of\r\nmiles--and the ultra-screen of the Hill had already been noted by the\r\ninvaders as the earth's only possible source of trouble. Thus the\r\ndeparture of the _Boise_ had not gone unnoticed, and the fact, that, not\r\neven with his most penetrant rays could he see into her interior, had\r\nalready given the Nevian commander some slight concern. Therefore, as\r\nsoon as it was determined that the great ship was being directed toward\r\nPittsburgh the fish-shaped cruiser of the void went into action.\r\n\r\nHigh in the stratosphere, speeding eastward, the immense mass of the\r\n_Boise_ slowed abruptly, although no projector had slackened its effort.\r\nCleveland, eyes upon interferometer grating and spectrophotometer\r\ncharts, fingers flying over calculator keys, grinned as he turned toward\r\nRodebush.\r\n\r\n\"Just as you thought, Skipper; an ultra-band pusher. C4V63L29. Shall I\r\ngive him a little pull?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet; let's feel him out a little before we force a close-up. We've\r\ngot plenty of mass. See what he does when I put full push on the\r\nprojectors.\"\r\n\r\nAs the full power of the Terrestrial vessel was applied the Nevian was\r\nforced backward, away from the threatened city, against the full drive\r\nof her every projector. Soon, however, the advance was again checked,\r\nand both scientists read the reason upon their plates. The enemy had put\r\ndown re-enforcing rods of tremendous power. Three compression members\r\nspread out fanwise behind her, bracing her against the low mountainside,\r\nwhile one huge tractor beam was thrust directly downward, holding in an\r\nunbreakable grip a cylinder of earth extending deep down into bedrock.\r\n\r\n\"Two can play at that game!\" And Rodebush drove down similar beams, and\r\nforward-reaching tractors as well. \"Strap yourselves in solid,\r\neverybody!\" he sounded a general warning. \"Something is going to give\r\nway somewhere soon, and when it does we'll get a jolt!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the promised jolt did indeed come soon. Prodigiously massive and\r\npowerful as the Nevian was, the _Boise_ was even more massive and more\r\npowerful; and as the already enormous energy feeding the tractors,\r\npushers, and projectors was raised to its inconceivable maximum, the\r\nvessel of the enemy was hurled upward, backward; and that of earth shot\r\nahead with a bounding leap that threatened to strain even her mighty\r\nmembers. The Nevian anchor-rods had not broken; they had simply pulled\r\nup the vast cylinders of solid rock that had formed their anchorages.\r\n\r\n\"Grab him now!\" Rodebush yelled, and even while an avalanche of falling\r\nrock was burying the countryside, Cleveland snapped a tractor ray upon\r\nthe flying fish and pulled tentatively.\r\n\r\nNor did the Nevian now seem averse to coming to grips. The two warring\r\nsuper-dreadnaughts darted toward each other, and from the invader there\r\nflooded out the dread crimson opacity which had theretofore meant the\r\ndoom of all things Solarian. It flooded out and engulfed the immense\r\nmass of humanity's hope in its spreading cloud of redly impenetrable\r\nmurk. But not for long. Triplanetary's super-ship boasted no ordinary\r\nTerrestrial defense, but was sheathed in screen after screen of\r\nultra-vibrations: imponderable walls, it is true, but barriers\r\nimpenetrable to any unfriendly wave. To the outer screen the red veil of\r\nthe Nevians clung tenaciously, licking greedily at every square inch of\r\nthe shielding sphere of force, but unable to find an opening through\r\nwhich to feed upon the steel of the _Boise_'s armor.\r\n\r\n\"Get back--'way back! Go back and help Pittsburgh!\" Rodebush drove an\r\nultra-communicator beam through the murk to the instruments of the\r\nTerrestrial admiral; for the surviving warships of the Fleet--its most\r\npowerful units--were hurling themselves forward, to plunge into that red\r\ndestruction. \"None of you will last a second in this red field. And\r\nwatch out for a violet field pretty soon--it'll be worse than this. We\r\ncan handle them alone, I think; but if we can't, there's nothing in the\r\nSystem that can help us!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the hitherto passive screen of the super-ship became active. At\r\nfirst invisible, it began to glow in livid, violet light, and as the\r\nglow brightened to unbearable intensity the entire spherical shield\r\nbegan to increase in size. Driven outward from the super-ship as a\r\ncenter, its advancing surface of seething energy consumed the crimson\r\nmurk as a billow of blast-furnace heat consumes a cloud of snowflakes in\r\nthe air above its shaft. Nor was the red death-mist all that was\r\nconsumed. Between that ravening surface and the armor skin of the\r\n_Boise_ there was nothing. No debris, no atmosphere, no vapor, no single\r\natom of material substance--the first time in Terrestrial experience\r\nthat an absolute vacuum had ever been attained!\r\n\r\nStubbornly contesting every foot of way lost, the Nevian fog retreated\r\nbefore the violet sphere of nothingness. Back and back it fell,\r\ndisappearing altogether from all space as the violet tide engulfed the\r\nenemy vessel; but the flying fish did not disappear. Her triple screens\r\nflashed into furiously incandescent splendor and she entered, unscathed,\r\nthat vacuous sphere, which collapsed instantly into an enormously\r\nelongated ellipsoid, at each focus a madly warring ship of space.\r\n\r\nThen in that tube of vacuum was waged a spectacular duel of\r\nultra-weapons--weapons impotent in air, but deadly in empty space.\r\nBeams, rays, and rods of Titanic power smote cracklingly against\r\nultra-screens equally capable. Time after time each contestant ran the\r\ngamut of the spectrum with his every available ultra-force, only to find\r\nall channels closed. For minutes the terrible struggle went on, then:\r\n\r\n\"Cooper, Adlington, Spencer, Dutton!\" Rodebush called into his\r\ntransmitter. \"Ready? Can't touch him on the ultra, so I'm going onto the\r\nmacro-bands. Give him everything you have as soon as I collapse the\r\nviolet. Go!\"\r\n\r\nAt the word the violet barrier went down, and with a crash as of a\r\ndisrupting Universe the atmosphere rushed into the void. And through the\r\nhurricane there shot out the deadliest material weapons of Triplanetary.\r\nTorpedoes--non-ferrous, ultra-screened, beam-dirigible torpedoes charged\r\nwith the most effective forms of material destruction known to man.\r\nCooper hurled his canisters of penetrating gas, Adlington his atomic\r\niron explosive bombs, Spencer his indestructible armor-piercing\r\nprojectiles, and Dutton his shatterable flasks of the quintessence of\r\ncorrosion--a sticky, tacky liquid of such dire potency that only one\r\nrare Solarian element could contain it. Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred\r\nwere thrown as fast as automatic machinery could launch them; and the\r\nNevians found themselves adversaries not to be despised. Size for size,\r\ntheir screens were quite as capable as those of the _Boise_. The\r\nNevians' destructive rays glanced harmlessly from their shields, and the\r\nNevians' elaborate screens, neutralized at impact by those of the\r\ntorpedoes, were impotent to impede their progress. Each projectile must\r\nneeds be caught and crushed individually by beams of the most prodigious\r\npower; and while one was being annihilated dozens more were rushing to\r\nthe attack. Then, while the twisting, dodging invader was busiest with\r\nthe tiny but relentless destroyers, Rodebush launched his heaviest\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nThe macro-beams! Prodigious streamers of bluish-green flame which tore\r\nsavagely through course after course of Nevian screen! Malevolent fangs,\r\ndriven with such power and velocity that they were biting into the very\r\nwalls of the enemy vessel before the amphibians knew their defensive\r\nshells of force had been punctured! And the emergency screens of the\r\ninvaders were equally futile. Course after course was sent out, only to\r\nflare viciously through the spectrum and to go black!\r\n\r\nOutfought at every turn, the now frantically dodging Nevian leaped away\r\nin headlong flight, only to be brought to a staggering, crashing halt as\r\nCleveland nailed her with a tractor beam. But the Terrestrials were to\r\nlearn that the Nevians held in reserve a means of retreat. The tractor\r\nsnapped--sheared off squarely by a sizzling plane of force--and the\r\nfish-shaped cruiser faded from Cleveland's sight, just as the _Boise_\r\nhad disappeared from the communicator plates of Radio Center, back in\r\nthe Hill, when she was launched. But though the plates in the control\r\nroom could not hold the Nevian, she did not vanish beyond the ken of\r\nRandolph, now Communications Officer in the super-ship. For, warned and\r\nhumiliated by his losing one speeding vessel from his plates in Radio\r\nCenter, he was now ready for any emergency. Therefore as the Nevian\r\nfled, Randolph's spy-ray held her, automatically behind it as there was\r\nthe full output of twelve special banks of iron-driven power tubes; and\r\nthus it was that the vengeful Terrestrials flashed immediately along the\r\nNevians' line of flight. Inertialess now, pausing briefly from time to\r\ntime to enable the crew to accustom themselves to the new sensations,\r\nthe _Boise_ pursued the invader; hurtling through the void with a\r\nvelocity unthinkable.\r\n\r\n\"He was easier to take than I thought he would be,\" Cleveland grunted,\r\nstaring into the plate.\r\n\r\n\"I thought he had more stuff, too,\" Rodebush assented; \"but I guess\r\nCostigan got almost everything they had. If so, with all our own stuff\r\nand most of theirs besides, we should be able to take them. They must\r\nhave neutralization, too, to take off like that; and if it's one hundred\r\nper cent we'll never catch them ... but it isn't--there they are!\"\r\n\r\n\"And this time I'm going to hold her or burn out all our generators\r\ntrying,\" Cleveland declared, grimly. \"Are you fellows down there able to\r\nhandle yourselves yet? Fine! Start throwing out your cans!\"\r\n\r\nSpace-hardened veterans all, the other Terrestrial officers had fought\r\noff the horrible nausea of inertialessness, just as Rodebush and\r\nCleveland had done. Again the ravening green macro-beams tore at the\r\nflying cruiser, again the mighty frames of the two space-ships shuddered\r\nsickeningly as Cleveland clamped on his tractor rod, again the highly\r\ndirigible torpedoes dashed out with their freights of death and\r\ndestruction. And again the Nevian shear-plane of force slashed at the\r\nTerrestrial's tractor beam; but this time the mighty puller did not give\r\nway. Sparkling and spitting high-tension sparks, the plane bit deeply\r\ninto the stubborn rod of energy. Brighter, thicker, and longer grew the\r\ndischarges as the gnawing plane drew more and more power; but in direct\r\nratio to that power the rod grew larger, denser, and ever harder to cut.\r\nMore and more vivid became the pyrotechnic display of electric\r\nbrilliance, until suddenly the entire tractor rod disappeared. At the\r\nsame instant a blast of intolerable flame erupted from the _Boise_'s\r\nflank and the whole enormous fabric of her shook and quivered under the\r\nforce of a terrific detonation.\r\n\r\n\"Randolph! I don't see them! Are they attacking or running?\" Rodebush\r\ndemanded. He was the first to realize what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"Running--fast!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as well, perhaps, but get their line. Adlington!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Was afraid you were gone--that was one of your bombs, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Well launched, just inside the screens. Don't see how it could\r\nhave detonated unless something hot and hard struck it in the tube; it\r\nwould need about that much time to explode. Good thing it didn't go off\r\nany sooner, or none of us would have been here. As it is, Area Six is\r\npretty well done in, but the bulkheads held the damage to Six. What\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know, exactly. Both generators on the tractor beam went out.\r\nAt first, I thought that was all, but my neutralizers are dead and I\r\ndon't know what else. When the G-4's went out the fusion must have\r\nshorted the neutralizers. They would make a mess; it must have burned a\r\nhole down into number six tube. Cleveland and I will come down, and\r\nwe'll all look around.\"\r\n\r\nDonning space-suits, the scientists let themselves into the damaged\r\ncompartment through the emergency air-locks, and what a sight they saw!\r\nBoth outer and inner walls of alloy armor had been blown away by the\r\nawful force of the explosion. Jagged plates hung awry; bent, twisted,\r\nand broken. The great torpedo tube, with all its intricate automatic\r\nmachinery, had been driven violently backward and lay piled in hideous\r\nconfusion against the backing bulkheads. Practically nothing remained\r\nwhole in the entire compartment.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much we can do here,\" Rodebush said finally, through his\r\ntransmitter, \"Let's go see what number four generator room looks like.\"\r\n\r\nThat room, although not affected by the explosion from without, had been\r\nquite as effectively wrecked from within. It was still stiflingly hot;\r\nits air was still reeking with the stench of burning lubricant,\r\ninsulation, and metal; its floor was half covered by a semi-molten mass\r\nof what had once been vital machinery. For with the burning out of the\r\ngenerator bars the energy of the disintegrating allotropic iron had had\r\nno outlet, and had built up until it had broken through its insulation\r\nand in an irresistible flood of power had torn through all obstacles in\r\nits path of neutralization.\r\n\r\n\"Hm-m-m. Should have had an automatic shut-off--one detail we\r\noverlooked,\" Rodebush mused. \"The electricians _can_ rebuild this stuff\r\nhere, though--that hole in the hull is something else again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say it's something else,\" the grizzled Chief Engineer agreed.\r\n\"She's lost all her spherical strength--anchoring a tractor with this\r\nship now would turn her inside out. Back to the nearest Triplanetary\r\nshop for us, I would say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come again, Chief!\" Cleveland advised the engineer. \"None of us would\r\nlive long enough to get there. We can't travel inertialess until the\r\nrepairs are made, so if they can't be made without very much traveling,\r\nit's just too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how we could support our jacks....\" The engineer paused,\r\nthen went on. \"If you can't give me Mars or Tellus, how about some other\r\nplanet? I don't care about atmosphere, or about anything but mass. I can\r\nstiffen her up in three or four days if I can sit down on something\r\nheavy enough to hold our jacks and presses; but if we have to rig up\r\nspace-cradles around the ship herself it'll take a long time--months,\r\nprobably. Haven't got a spare planet on hand, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We might have, at that,\" Rodebush made surprising answer. \"A couple of\r\nseconds before we engaged we were heading toward a sun with at least two\r\nplanets. I was just getting ready to dodge them when we cut the\r\nneutralizers, so they should be fairly close somewhere--yes, there's the\r\nsun, right over there. Rather pale and small; but it's close,\r\ncomparatively speaking. We'll go back up into the control room and find\r\nout about the planets.\"\r\n\r\nThe strange sun was found to have three large and easily located\r\nchildren, and observation showed that the crippled space-ship could\r\nreach the nearest of these in about five days. Power was therefore fed\r\nto the driving projectors, and each scientist, electrician, and mechanic\r\nbent to the task of repairing the ruined generators; rebuilding them to\r\nhandle any load which the converters could possibly put upon them. For\r\ntwo days the _Boise_ drove on; then her acceleration was reversed, and\r\nfinally a landing was effected upon the forbidding, rocky soil of the\r\nstrange world.\r\n\r\nIt was larger than the earth, and of a somewhat stronger gravitation.\r\nAlthough its climate was bitterly cold, even in its short daytime, it\r\nsupported a luxuriant but outlandish vegetation. Its atmosphere, while\r\nrich enough in oxygen and not really poisonous, was so rank with\r\nindescribably fetid vapors as to be scarcely breathable.\r\n\r\nBut these things bothered the engineers not at all. Paying no attention\r\nto temperature or to scenery and without waiting for chemical analysis\r\nof the air, the space-suited mechanics leaped to their tasks; and in\r\nonly a little more time than had been mentioned by the chief engineer\r\nthe hull and giant frame of the super-ship were as staunch as of yore.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Skipper!\" came finally the welcome word. \"You might try her\r\nout with a fast hop around this world before you shove off in earnest.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the fierce blast of her projectors the vessel leaped ahead, and\r\ntime after time, as Rodebush hurled her mass upon tractor beam or\r\npressor, the engineers sought in vain for any sign of weakness. The\r\nstrange planet half girdled and the severest tests passed flawlessly,\r\nRodebush reached for his neutralizer switches. Reached and paused,\r\ndumfounded, for a brilliant purple light had sprung into being upon his\r\npanel and a bell rang out insistently.\r\n\r\n\"What the blue blazes!\" Rodebush shot out an exploring beam along the\r\ndetector line and gasped. He stared, mouth open, then yelled:\r\n\r\n\"_Roger_ is here, rebuilding his planetoid! _STATIONS ALL_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n  Roger Carries On\r\n\r\n\r\nFor gray Roger had not perished in the floods of Nevian energy which had\r\ndestroyed his planetoid. While those terrific streamers of force\r\nemanating from the crimson obscurity surrounding the amphibians'\r\nspace-ship were driving into his defensive screens, Roger sat impassive\r\nand immobile at his desk. His hard gray eyes moved methodically over his\r\ninstruments and recorders; and after a few minutes he smiled coldly,\r\nwhile an expression of relief struggled fleetingly to move his\r\nexpressionless face. Even though his screens were better than anyone had\r\nsupposed, why admit it?\r\n\r\n\"Baxter, Hartkopf, Chatelier, Anandrusung, Penrose, Nishimura,\r\nMirsky....\" He called off a list of names. \"Report to me here at once!\"\r\n\r\n\"The planetoid is lost,\" he informed his select group of scientists when\r\nthey had assembled, \"and we must abandon it in exactly fifteen minutes,\r\nwhich will be the time required for the robots to fill this first\r\nsection with our most necessary machinery and instruments. Pack each of\r\nyou one box of the things he most wishes to take with him, and report\r\nback here in not more than thirteen minutes. Say nothing to anyone\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\nThey filed out calmly, and as they passed out into the hall Baxter,\r\nperhaps a trifle less case-hardened than his fellows, at least voiced a\r\nthought for those they were so brutally deserting.\r\n\r\n\"I say, it seems a bit thick to dash off this way and leave the rest of\r\nthem; but still, I suppose....\"\r\n\r\n\"You suppose correctly.\" Bland and heartless Nishimura filled in the\r\npause. \"A small part of the planetoid may be able to escape; which, to\r\nme at least, is pleasantly surprising news. It cannot carry all of our\r\nmen and mechanisms, therefore only the most important of both are saved.\r\nWhat would you? For the rest it is simply what you call 'the fortune of\r\nwar,' no?\"\r\n\r\n\"But the beautiful....\" began the amorous Chatelier.\r\n\r\n\"Hush, fool!\" snorted Hartkopf. \"One word of that to the ear of Roger\r\nand you too are left behind. Of such non-essentials the Universe is\r\nfull, to be collected in times of ease, but in times hard to be\r\ndisregarded. Und this is a time of schrecklichkeit indeed!\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    And through that terrific conduit came speeding package\r\n    after package of destruction.]\r\n\r\nThe group broke up, each man going to his own quarters; to meet again in\r\nthe First Section a few minutes before the zero time. Roger's \"office\"\r\nwas now packed so tightly with machinery and supplies that but little\r\nroom was left for the scientists. The gray monstrosity still sat unmoved\r\nbehind his dials.\r\n\r\n\"But of what use is it, Roger?\" the Russian physicist demanded. \"Those\r\nwaves are of some ultra-band, of a frequency immensely higher than\r\nanything heretofore known. Our screens should not have stopped them for\r\nan instant. It is a mystery that they have held so long, and certainly\r\nthis single section will not be permitted to leave the planetoid without\r\nbeing destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many things you do not know, Mirsky,\" came the cold and level\r\nanswer. \"Our screens, which you think are of your own devising, have\r\nseveral improvements of my own in the formulae, and would hold forever\r\nhad I the power to drive them. The screens of this section, being\r\nsmaller, can be held as long as will be found necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Power!\" the dumfounded Russian exclaimed. \"Why, we have almost infinite\r\npower--unlimited--sufficient for a lifetime of high expenditure!\"\r\n\r\nBut Roger made no reply, for the time of departure was at hand. He\r\npressed down a tiny lever, and a robot in the power room threw in the\r\ngigantic plunger switches which launched against the Nevians the\r\nstupendous beam which so upset the complacence of Nerado the\r\namphibian--the beam into which was poured recklessly every resource of\r\npower afforded by the planetoid, careless alike of burn-out and of\r\nexhaustion. Then, all the attention of the Nevians and the greater part\r\nof their power output devoted to the neutralization of that last\r\ndesperate thrust, the metal wall of the planetoid opened and the First\r\nSection shot out into space. Full-driven as they were, Roger's screens\r\nflared white as he drove through the temporarily lessened attack of the\r\nNevians; but in their preoccupation the amphibians did not notice the\r\nadditional disturbance and the section tore on, unobserved and\r\nundetected. Far out in space, Roger raised his eyes from the instrument\r\npanel and continued the conversation as though it had not been\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is relative, Mirsky, and you have misused gravely the term\r\n'unlimited.' Our power was, and is, very definitely limited. True, it\r\nthen seemed ample for our needs, and is far superior to that possessed\r\nby the inhabitants of any solar system with which I am familiar; but the\r\nbeings behind that red screen, whoever they are, have sources of power\r\nas far above ours as ours are above those of the Solarians.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"That power, what is it?\" \"We have, then, the analyses of those fields\r\nrecorded!\" Came simultaneous questions and explanations.\r\n\r\n\"Their power-source is very probably the intra-atomic energy of iron;\r\nand if so, much remains to be done before I can proceed with my plan. I\r\nmust have the most powerful structure in the known Universe before I can\r\nact. In the light of what I have just learned, the loss of the planetoid\r\nis but a trifle.\" Roger, as unmoved as one of his own automatons, was\r\ncoldly analyzing the situation, thinking the thing through to its\r\nlogical conclusion, paying no attention whatever to the losses of life,\r\ntime and treasure now behind him.\r\n\r\n\"But what can you do about it?\" growled the Russian.\r\n\r\n\"Many things. From the charts of the recorders we can compute their\r\nfields of force, and from that point it is only a step to their method\r\nof liberating the energy. We shall build robots. They shall build other\r\nrobots, who shall in turn construct another planetoid; one this time\r\nthat, wielding the theoretical maximum of power, will be suited to my\r\nneeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where will you build it? We are marked. Invisibility now is\r\nuseless. Triplanetary will find us, even if we take up an orbit beyond\r\nthat of Pluto!\"\r\n\r\n\"We have already left your Solarian system far behind. We are going to\r\nanother system; one far enough removed so that the spy-rays of\r\nTriplanetary will never find us, and yet one that we can reach in a\r\nreasonable length of time with the energies at our command. Some fifteen\r\ndays will be required for the journey, however, and our quarters are\r\ncramped. Therefore make places for yourselves wherever you can, and\r\nlessen the tedium of those fifteen days by working upon whatever\r\nproblems are most pressing in your respective researches.\"\r\n\r\nThe gray monster fell silent, immersed in what thoughts no one knew, and\r\nthe scientists set out to obey his orders. Baxter, the British chemist,\r\nfollowed Penrose, the lantern-jawed, saturnine American engineer and\r\ninventor, as he made his way to the furthermost cubicle of the section.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Penrose, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions, if you don't\r\nmind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead. Ordinarily it's dangerous to be a cackling hen anywhere\r\naround _him_, but he can't hear anything here now. His system is pretty\r\nwell shot to pieces. You want to know all I know about Roger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so. You have been with him so much longer than I have, you\r\nknow. In some ways he impresses one as being scarcely human, if you know\r\nwhat I mean. Ridiculous, of course, but of late I have been wondering\r\nwhether he really _is_ human. He knows too much, about too many things.\r\nHe seems to be acquainted with many solar systems, to visit which would\r\nrequire life-times. Then, too, he has dropped remarks which would imply\r\nthat he actually saw things that happened long before any living man\r\ncould possibly have been born. Finally, he looks--well, peculiar--and\r\ncertainly does not act human. I have been wondering, and have been able\r\nto learn nothing about him; as you have said, such talk as this aboard\r\nthe planetoid was impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't worry about being paid your price; that's one thing. If we\r\nlive--and that was part of the agreement, you know--we will all get what\r\nwe sold out for. You will become a belted earl. I have already made\r\nmillions, and shall make many more. Similarly, Chatelier has had and\r\nwill have his women, Anandrusung and Nishimura their cherished revenges.\r\nHartkopf his power, and so on.\" He eyed the other speculatively, then\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n\"I might as well spill it all, since I'll never have a better chance and\r\nsince you should know what the rest of us do. You're in the same boat\r\nwith us and tarred with the same brush. There's a lot of gossip, that\r\nmay or may not be true, but I know one very startling fact. Here it is.\r\nMy great-great-grandfather left some notes which, taken in connection\r\nwith certain things I myself saw on the planetoid, prove beyond question\r\nthat our Roger went to Harvard University at the same time he did. Roger\r\nwas a grown man then, and the elder Penrose noted that he was marked,\r\nlike this,\" and the American sketched a cabalistic design.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" Baxter exclaimed. \"An adept of North Polar Jupiter--_them?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That was before the First Jovian War, you know, and it was those\r\nmedicine-men--really high-caliber scientists--that prolonged that war\r\nso....\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say, Penrose, that's really a bit thick. When they were wiped out\r\nit was proved a lot of hocus-pocus....\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of it was, but most of it wasn't,\" Penrose interrupted in turn.\r\n\"I'm not asking you to believe anything except that one fact; I'm just\r\ntelling you the rest of it. But it is also a fact that those adepts knew\r\nthings and did things that take a lot of explaining. Now for the gossip,\r\nnone of which is guaranteed. Roger is undoubtedly of Tellurian\r\nparentage, and the story is that his father was a moon-pirate, his\r\nmother a Greek adventuress. When the pirates were chased off the moon\r\nthey went to Ganymede, you know, and some of them were captured by the\r\nJovians. It seems that Roger was born at an instant of time sacred to\r\nthe adepts, so they took him on. He worked his way up through the\r\nForbidden Society as all adepts did, by various kinds of murder and job\r\nlots of assorted deviltries, until he got clear to the top--the\r\nseventy-seventh mystery....\"\r\n\r\n\"The secret of eternal youth!\" gasped Baxter, awed in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Right, and he stayed Chief Devil, in spite of all the efforts of all\r\nhis ambitious sub-devils to kill him, until the turning-point of the\r\nFirst Jovian War. He cut away then in a space-ship, and ever since then\r\nhe has been working--and working hard--on some stupendous plan of his\r\nown that nobody else has ever got even an inkling of. That's the story.\r\nTrue or not, it explains a lot of things that no other theory can touch.\r\nAnd now I think you'd better shuffle along; enough of this is a great\r\nplenty!\"\r\n\r\nBaxter went to his own cubby, and each man of the adept's cold-blooded\r\ncrew methodically took up his task. True to prediction, in fifteen days\r\na planet loomed beneath them and their vessel settled through a reeking\r\natmosphere toward a rocky and forbidding plain. Then for another day\r\nthey plunged along, a few thousand feet above the surface of that\r\nstrange world, while Roger with his analytical detectors sought the most\r\nfavorable location from which to wrest the materials necessary for his\r\nprogram of construction.\r\n\r\nIt was a world of cold; its sun was distant, pale, and wan. It had\r\nmonstrous forms of vegetation, of which each branch and member writhed\r\nand fought with a grotesque and horrible individual activity. Ever and\r\nanon a struggling part broke from its parent plant and darted away in\r\nindependent existence; leaping upon and consuming or being consumed by a\r\nfellow creature equally monstrous. This flora was of a uniform color--a\r\nlurid, sickly yellow. In form some of it was fern-like, some\r\ncactus-like, some vaguely tree-like; but it was all outrageous,\r\ninherently repulsive to all Solarian senses. And no less hideous were\r\nthe animal-like forms of life, which slithered and slunk rapaciously\r\nthrough that fantastic pseudo-vegetation. Snake-like, reptile-like,\r\nbat-like, the creatures squirmed, crawled, and flew; each covered with a\r\ndankly oozing yellow hide and each motivated by twin common impulses--to\r\nkill and insatiably and indiscriminately to devour. Over this reeking\r\nwilderness Roger drove his vessel, untouched by its disgusting, its\r\nappalling ferocity and horror.\r\n\r\n\"There should be intelligence, of a kind,\" he mused, and swept the\r\nsurface of the planet with an exploring beam. \"Ah, yes, there is a city,\r\nof sorts,\" and in a few minutes the outlaws were looking down upon a\r\nmetal-walled city of roundly conical buildings.\r\n\r\nInside these structures and between and around them there scuttled\r\nformless blobs of matter, one of which Roger brought up into his vessel\r\nby means of a tractor ray. Held immovable by the beam it lay upon the\r\nfloor, a strangely extensile, amoeba-like metal-studded mass of leathery\r\nsubstance. Of eyes, ears, limbs, or organs it apparently had none, yet\r\nit radiated an intensely hostile aura; a mental effluvium concentrated\r\nof rage and of hatred.\r\n\r\n\"Apparently the ruling intelligence of the planet,\" Roger commented.\r\n\"Such creatures are useless to us; we can build robots in half the time\r\nrequired for their subjugation and training. Still, it should not be\r\npermitted to carry back what it may have learned of us.\" As he spoke the\r\nadept threw the peculiar being out into the air and dispassionately\r\nrayed it out of existence.\r\n\r\n\"That thing reminds me of a man I used to know, back in Penobscot.\"\r\nPenrose was as coldly callous as his unfeeling master. \"The\r\nevenest-tempered man in town--mad all the time!\"\r\n\r\nEventually Roger found a location which satisfied his requirements of\r\nraw materials, and made a landing upon that unfriendly soil. Sweeping\r\nbeams denuded a great circle of life, and into that circle leaped\r\nrobots. Robots requiring neither rest nor food, but only lubricants and\r\npower; robots insensible alike to that bitter cold and to that noxious\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nBut the outlaws were not to win a foothold upon that inimical planet\r\neasily, nor were they to hold it without effort. Through the weird\r\nvegetation of the circle's bare edge there scuttled and poured along a\r\nhorde of the metal-studded men--if \"men\" they might be called--who,\r\nferocity incarnate, rushed the robot line. Mowed down by hundreds, still\r\nthey came on; willing, it seemed to expend any number of lives in order\r\nthat one living creature might once touch a robot with one out-thrust\r\nmetallic stud. Whenever that happened there was a flash as of lightning,\r\nthe heavy smoke of burning insulation, grease and metal, and the robot\r\nwent down out of control. Recalling his remaining automatons, Roger sent\r\nout a shielding screen, against which the defenders of their planet\r\nraged in impotent fury. For days they hurled themselves and their every\r\nforce against that impenetrable barrier, then withdrew: temporarily\r\nstopped, but by no means acknowledging defeat.\r\n\r\nThen, while Roger and his cohorts directed affairs from within their\r\ncomfortable and now sufficiently roomy vessel, there came into being\r\naround it an industrial city of metal, peopled by metallic and insensate\r\nmechanisms. Mines were sunk, furnaces were blown in, smelters belched\r\nforth into the already unbearable air their sulphurous fumes, rolling\r\nmills and machine shops were built and equipped: and as fast as new\r\nenterprises were completed additional robots were ready to man them. In\r\nrecord time the heavy work of girders, members, and plates was well\r\nunder way; and shortly thereafter light, deft, and multi-fingered\r\nmechanical men began the interminable task of building and installing\r\nthe prodigious amount of precise machinery required for the vast\r\nstructure. Roger was well content: but one day he was rudely awakened\r\nfrom his dream of complete isolation.\r\n\r\nEven though he had no reason to believe that there was anything\r\ndangerous within hundreds of millions of miles, it was Roger's cautious\r\ncustom to release the screens from time to time, in order to allow his\r\ndetectors to range out. This day, as he sent out his beams, his hard\r\ngray eyes grew even harder.\r\n\r\n\"Mirsky! Nishimura! Come here!\" he snapped, and showed them upon his\r\nplate an enormous sphere of steel, its rays flaming viciously. \"Is there\r\nany doubt whatever in your minds as to the System to which that ship\r\nbelongs?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all--Triplanetarian,\" replied the Russian. \"While larger than\r\nany I have seen before, its construction is unmistakable. They managed\r\nto trace us, and are testing out their weapons before attacking. Do we\r\nattack or do we run away?\"\r\n\r\n\"If Triplanetarian, and it surely is, we attack,\" coldly. \"This one\r\nsection is armed and powered to defeat Triplanetary's entire navy. We\r\nshall take that ship, and shall add its slight resources to our own. And\r\nit may even be that they have picked up the three who escaped me.... I\r\nhave never yet been balked for long. Yes, we shall take that vessel. And\r\nthose three sooner or later. Bradley I care nothing about ... but\r\nCostigan handled me ... and the woman....\" Diamond-hard eyes glared\r\nbalefully at the urge of thoughts to a clean and normal mind\r\nunthinkable.\r\n\r\n\"To your posts,\" he ordered. \"The robots will continue to function under\r\ntheir automatic controls during the short time it will require to abate\r\nthis nuisance.\"\r\n\r\n\"_One moment!_\" A strange voice roared from the speakers. \"Consider\r\nyourselves under arrest, by order of the Triplanetary Council! Surrender\r\nand you shall receive impartial hearing; fight us and you shall never\r\ncome to trial. From what we have learned of Roger, we do not expect him\r\nto surrender, but if any of you other men wish to avoid immediate death,\r\nleave your vessel at once. We will come back for you later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any of you wishing to leave this vessel have my full permission to do\r\nso,\" Roger announced, disdaining any reply to the challenge of the\r\n_Boise_. \"Any such, however, will not be allowed inside the planetoid\r\narea after the rest of us return from wiping out that patrol. We attack\r\nin one minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would not one do better by stopping on?\" Baxter, in the quarters of the\r\nAmerican, was in doubt as to the most profitable course to pursue. \"I\r\nshould leave immediately if I thought that that ship could win; but I do\r\nnot fancy that it can, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That ship? _One_ Triplanetary ship against _us_?\" Penrose laughed\r\nraucously. \"Do as you please. I'd go in a minute if I thought that there\r\nwas any chance of us losing; but there isn't, so I'm staying. I know\r\nwhich side _my_ bread's buttered on. Those cops are bluffing, that's\r\nall. Not bluffing exactly, either, because they'll go through with it as\r\nlong as they last. Foolish, but it's a way they have--they'll die trying\r\nevery time, instead of running away, even when they know they're licked\r\nbefore they start. They don't use good judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"None of you are leaving? Very well, you each know what to do,\" came\r\nRoger's emotionless voice. The stipulated minute having elapsed, he\r\nadvanced a lever and the outlaw cruiser slid quietly into the air.\r\n\r\nToward the poised _Boise_ Roger steered. Within range, he flung out a\r\nweapon new-learned and supposedly irresistible to any ferrous thing or\r\ncreature, the red converter-field of the Nevians. For Roger's analytical\r\ndetectors had stood him in good stead during those frightful minutes in\r\nthe course of which the planetoid had borne the brunt of Nerado's\r\nsuperhuman attack; in such good stead that from the records of those\r\ningenious instruments he and his scientists had been able to reconstruct\r\nnot only the generators of the attacking forces, but also the screens\r\nemployed by the amphibians in the neutralization of similar beams. With\r\na vastly inferior armament the smallest of Roger's vessels had defeated\r\nthe most powerful battleships of Triplanetary; what had he to fear in\r\nsuch a heavy craft as the one he now was driving, one so superlatively\r\narmed and powered? Well it was for his peace of mind that he had no\r\ninkling that the harmless-looking sphere he was so blithely attacking\r\nwas in reality the much-discussed, half-mythical \"super-ship\" of\r\nTriplanetary's Secret Service; nor that its already unprecedented\r\narmament had been re-enforced, thanks to that hated Costigan, with\r\nRoger's own every worth-while idea, as well as with every weapon and\r\ndefense known to that arch-Nevian, Nerado!\r\n\r\nUnknowing and contemptuous, Roger launched his converter field, and\r\ninstantly found himself fighting for his very life. For from Rodebush at\r\nthe controls down, the men of the Secret Service countered with wave\r\nafter wave and with salvo after salvo of vibratory and material\r\ndestruction. No thought of mercy for the men of the pirate ship could\r\nenter their minds. The outlaws had each been given a chance to\r\nsurrender, and each had refused it. Refusing, they knew, as the\r\nTriplanetarians knew and as all modern readers know, meant that they\r\nwere staking their lives upon victory. For with modern armaments it is\r\nseldom indeed that a single man lives through the defeat in battle of a\r\nwar-vessel of space.\r\n\r\nRoger launched his field of red opacity, but it did not reach even\r\n_Boise_'s screens. All space seemed to explode into violet splendor as\r\nRodebush neutralized it, drove it back with his obliterating zone of\r\nforce; but even that all-devouring zone could not touch Roger's\r\npeculiarly efficient screen. The outlaw vessel stood out, unharmed.\r\nUltra-violet, infra-red, pure heat, infra-sound, solid beams of\r\nhigh-tension high-frequency current in whose paths the most stubborn\r\nmetals would be volatilized instantly; all iron-driven, every deadly and\r\ntorturing vibration known was hurled against that screen; but it, too,\r\nwas iron-driven, and it held. Even the awful force of the macro-beam was\r\ndissipated by it--reflected, hurled away on all sides in coruscating\r\ntorrents of blinding, dazzling energy. Cooper, Adlington, Spencer, and\r\nDutton hurled against it their bombs and torpedoes--and still it held.\r\nBut Roger's fiercest blasts and heaviest projectiles were equally\r\nimpotent against the force-shields of the super-ship. The adept, having\r\nno liking for a battle upon anything like equal terms, sought safety in\r\nflight, only to be brought to a crashing, stunning halt by a massive\r\ntractor beam.\r\n\r\n\"That must be that sixth-phase polycyclic screen that Conway reported\r\non,\" Cleveland frowned in thought. \"I've been doing a lot of work on\r\nthat, and I think I've calculated an opener for it, Fred, but I'll have\r\nto have number ten projector and the whole output of number ten power\r\nroom. Can you let me play with that much juice for a while? All right,\r\nBlake, tune her up to fifty-five thousand--there, hold it! Now, you\r\nother fellows, listen! I'm going to try to drill a hole through that\r\nscreen with a hollow, quasi-solid beam: like a diamond drill cutting out\r\na core. You won't be able to shove anything into the hole from outside\r\nthe beam, so you'll have to steer your cans out through the central\r\norifice of number ten projector--that'll be cold, since I'm going to use\r\nonly the edge. I don't know how long I'll be able to hold the hole open,\r\nthough so shoot them along as fast as you can. Ready? Here goes!\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed a series of contacts. Far below, in number ten converter\r\nroom, massive switches drove home and the enormous mass of the vessel\r\nquivered under the terrific reaction of the newly-calculated,\r\nsemi-material beam of energy that was hurled out, backed by the\r\nmightiest of all the mighty converters and generators of Triplanetary's\r\nsuper-dreadnaught. That beam, a pipe-like hollow cylinder of intolerable\r\nenergy, flashed out, and there was a rending, tearing crash as it struck\r\nRoger's hitherto impenetrable wall. Struck and clung, grinding, boring\r\nin, while from the raging inferno that marked the circle of contact of\r\ncylinder and shield the pirates' screen radiated scintillating torrents\r\nof cracking, streaming sparks, lightning-like in length and in\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nDeeper and deeper the gigantic drill was driven. It was through! Pierced\r\nRoger's polycyclic screen; exposed the bare metal of Roger's walls! And\r\nnow, concentrated upon one point, flamed out in seemingly redoubled fury\r\nTriplanetary's raging rays--in vain. For even as they could not\r\npenetrate the screen, neither could they penetrate the wall of\r\nCleveland's drill, but rebounded from it in the cascaded brilliance of\r\nthwarted lightning.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a dumb-bell I am!\" groaned Cleveland. \"Why, oh why didn't I\r\nhave somebody rig up a secondary SX7 beam on Ten's inner rings? Hop to\r\nit, will you, Blake, so that we'll have it in case they are able to stop\r\nthe cans?\"\r\n\r\nBut the pirates could not stop all of Triplanetary's projectiles, now\r\nhurrying along inside the pipe as fast as they could be driven. In fact,\r\nfor a few minutes desperate Roger, knowing that he faced his long life's\r\ngravest crisis, paid no attention to them at all, nor to any of his own\r\nuseless offensive weapons: he struggled only and madly to break away\r\nfrom the savage grip of the _Boise_'s tractor rod. Futile. He could\r\nneither cut nor stretch that inexorably anchoring beam. Then he devoted\r\nhis every resource to the closing of that unbelievable breach in his\r\nshield; the barrier which through all previous emergencies had kept\r\ndeath at bay. Equally futile. His most desperate efforts resulted only\r\nin more frenzied displays of incandescence along the curved surface of\r\ncontact of that penetrant cylinder. And through that terrific conduit\r\ncame speeding package after package of destruction. Bombs, and\r\narmor-piercing shells, gas shells, and shells of poisonous and corrosive\r\nfluids followed each other in close succession. The surviving scientists\r\nof the planetoid, expert gunners and ray-men all, destroyed many of the\r\nprojectiles, but it was not humanly possible to frustrate them all. And\r\nthe breach could not be forced shut against the all but irresistible\r\nforce of Cleveland's \"opener\". And with all his power Roger could not\r\nshift his vessel's position in the grip of Triplanetary's tractors\r\nsufficiently to bring a projector to bear upon the super-ship along the\r\nnow unprotected axis of that narrow, but deadly tube.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the end came soon. A war-head touched steel plating and\r\nthere ensued a world-wracking explosion of atomic iron. Gaping wide,\r\nhelpless, with all defenses down, other torpedoes entered the stricken\r\nhulk and completed its destruction even before they could be recalled.\r\nExplosive bombs literally tore the pirate vessel to fragments, while\r\nvials of pure corrosion dissolved her substance into dripping corruption\r\nand reeking gases filled every cranny of the wreckage as its torn and\r\ndismembered fragments began their long plunge to the ground. The\r\nspace-ship followed the pieces down, and Rodebush sent out an exploring\r\nray.\r\n\r\n\" ... resistance was such that it was necessary to use corrosive, and\r\nship and contents were completely disintegrated,\" he dictated into his\r\nvessel's log, some time later. \"While there were of course no remains\r\nrecognizable as human, it is practically certain that Roger and his last\r\neleven men died.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Fred,\" Cleveland called his attention to the plate, upon\r\nwhich was pictured a horde of the peculiar inhabitants of the ghastly\r\nplanet, wreaking their frenzied electrical wrath upon everything within\r\nthe circle bared by Roger. \"I was just going to suggest that we clean up\r\nthat planetoid Roger started, but I see that the local boys are\r\nattending to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as well, perhaps. I would like to stay and study these people a\r\nlittle while, but we must get back on the trail of the Nevians,\" and the\r\n_Boise_ leaped away into space, toward the line of flight of the\r\namphibians.\r\n\r\nThey reached that line and along it they traveled at full normal blast.\r\nAs they traveled their detecting receivers and amplifiers were reaching\r\nout with their utmost power; ultra-instruments capable of rendering\r\naudible any signal originating within many light-years of them, upon any\r\nknown frequency. And constantly at least two men were listening to those\r\ninstruments with every sense concentrated in their ears.\r\nListening--straining to distinguish in the deafening roar of background\r\nnoise from the over-driven tubes any sign of voice or signal.\r\nListening--while, millions upon untold millions of miles beyond even the\r\nprodigious reach of those ultra-instruments, three human beings, pitted\r\nagainst overwhelming odds, were even then sending out into empty space\r\nan almost hopeless appeal for the aid so desperately needed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n  The Specimens Escape\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing well that conversation with its fellows is one of the greatest\r\nneeds of any intelligent being, the Nevians had permitted the\r\nTerrestrial specimens to retain possession of their ultra-beam\r\ncommunicators. Thus it was that Costigan had been able to keep in touch\r\nwith his sweetheart and with Bradley. He learned that each had been\r\nplaced upon exhibition in a different Nevian city: that the three had\r\nbeen separated in response to an insistent popular demand for such a\r\ndistribution of the peculiar, but highly interesting creatures from a\r\ndistant solar system. They had not been harmed. In fact, each was\r\nvisited daily by a specialist, who made sure that his charge was being\r\nkept in the pink of condition.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he became aware of this condition of things Costigan became\r\nmorose. He sat still, drooped, and pined away visibly. He refused to\r\neat, and of the worried specialist he demanded liberty. Then, failing in\r\nthat as he knew he would fail, he demanded something to _do_. They\r\npointed out to him, reasonably enough, that in such a civilization as\r\ntheirs there was nothing he _could_ do. They assured him that they would\r\ndo anything they could to alleviate his mental suffering, but that since\r\nhe was a museum piece he must see, himself, that he must be kept on\r\ndisplay for a short time. Wouldn't he please behave himself and eat, as\r\na reasoning being should? Costigan sulked a little longer, then wavered.\r\nFinally he agreed to compromise. He would eat and exercise if they would\r\nfit up a laboratory in his apartment, so that he could continue the\r\nstudies he had begun upon his own native planet. To this they agreed,\r\nand thus it came about that one day the following conversation was held:\r\n\r\n\"Clio? Bradley? I've got something to tell you this time. Haven't said\r\nanything before, for fear things might not work out, but they did. I\r\nwent on a hunger strike and made them give me a complete laboratory. As\r\na chemist I'm a darn good electrician; but luckily, with the sea-water\r\nthey've got here, it's a very simple thing to make....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" snapped Bradley. \"Somebody may be listening in on us!\"\r\n\r\n\"They aren't. They can't, without my knowing it, and I'll cut off the\r\nsecond anybody tries to synchronize with my beam. To resume--making\r\nVee-Two is a very simple process, and I've got everything around here\r\nthat's hollow clear full of it....\"\r\n\r\n\"How come they let you?\" asked Clio.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they don't know what I'm doing. They watched me for a few days, and\r\nall I did was make up and bottle the weirdest messes imaginable. Then I\r\nfinally managed to separate oxygen and nitrogen, after trying hard all\r\nof one day; and when they thought they saw that I didn't know anything\r\nabout either one of them or what to do with them after I had them, they\r\ngave me up in disgust as a plain dumb ape and haven't paid any attention\r\nto me since. So I've got me plenty of kilograms of liquid Vee-Two, all\r\nready to touch off. I'm getting out of here in about three minutes and a\r\nhalf, and I'm coming over after you folks, in a new, iron-powered\r\nspace-speedster that they don't know I know anything about. They've just\r\ngiven it its final tests, and it's the slickest thing you ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Conway, dearest, you can't possibly rescue me,\" Clio's voice broke.\r\n\"Why, there are thousands of them, all around here. If you can get away,\r\ngo, dear, but don't....\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I was coming after you, and if I can get away I'll be there. A\r\ngood whiff of this stuff will lay out a thousand of them just as easily\r\nas it will one. Here's the idea. I've made a gas mask for myself, since\r\nI'll be in it where it's thick, but you two won't need any. The gas is\r\nsoluble enough in water so that three or four thicknesses of wet cloth\r\nover your noses will be enough. I'll tell you when to wet down. We're\r\ngoing to break away or go out trying--there aren't enough amphibians\r\nbetween here and Andromeda to keep us humans cooped up like menagerie\r\nanimals forever! But here comes my specialist with the keys to the city;\r\ntime for the overture to start. See you later!\"\r\n\r\nThe Nevian physician directed his key-tube upon the transparent wall of\r\nthe chamber and an opening appeared, an opening which vanished as soon\r\nas he had stepped through it; Costigan kicked a valve open; and from\r\nvarious innocent tubes there belched forth into the water of the central\r\nlagoon and into the air over it a flood of deadly vapor. As the Nevian\r\nturned toward the prisoner there was an almost inaudible hiss and a tiny\r\njet of the frightful, outlawed stuff struck his open gills, just below\r\nhis huge, conical head. He tensed momentarily, twitched convulsively\r\njust once, and fell motionless to the floor. And outside, the streams of\r\navidly soluble liquefied gas rushed out into air and into water. It\r\nspread, dissolved, and diffused with the extreme mobility which is one\r\nof its characteristics; and as it diffused and was borne outward the\r\nNevians, in their massed hundreds, died. Died not knowing what killed\r\nthem; not knowing even that they died. Costigan, bitterly resentful of\r\nthe inhuman treatment accorded the three and fiercely anxious for the\r\nsuccess of his plan of escape, held his breath and, grimly alert,\r\nwatched the amphibians die. When he could see no more motion anywhere he\r\ndonned his gas-mask, strapped upon his back a large canister of the\r\npoison--his capacious pockets were already full of smaller\r\ncontainers--and two savagely exultant sentences escaped him.\r\n\r\n\"I am a poor, ignorant specimen of ape, that can be let play with\r\napparatus, am I?\" he rasped, as he picked up the key-tube of the\r\nspecialist and opened the door of his prison. \"Maybe they'll learn\r\nsometime that it ain't always safe to judge by the looks of a flea how\r\nfar he can jump!\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped out through the opening into the water, and, burdened as he\r\nwas, made shift to swim to the nearest ramp. Up it he ran, toward a main\r\ncorridor. But ahead of him there was wafted a breath of dread Vee-Two,\r\nand where that breath went, went also unconsciousness--an\r\nunconsciousness which would deepen gradually into permanent oblivion\r\nsave for the prompt intervention of one who possessed, not only the\r\nnecessary antidote, but the equally important knowledge of exactly how\r\nto use it. Upon the floor of that corridor were strewn Nevians, who had\r\ndropped in their tracks. Past or over their bodies Costigan strode,\r\npausing only to direct a jet of lethal vapor into whatever branching\r\ncorridor or open doorway caught his eye. He was going to the intake of\r\nthe city's ventilation plant, and no unmasked creature dependent for\r\nlife upon oxygen could bar his path. He reached the intake, tore the\r\ncanister from his back, and released its full, vast volume of horrid\r\ncontents into the primary air stream of the entire city.\r\n\r\nAnd all throughout that doomed city Nevians dropped; quietly and without\r\na struggle, unknowing. Busy executives dropped upon their cushioned,\r\nflat-topped desks; hurrying travelers and messengers dropped upon the\r\nfloors of the corridors or relaxed in the noxious waters of the ways;\r\nlookouts and observers dropped before their flashing screens; central\r\noperators of communications dropped under the winking lights of their\r\npanels. Observers and centrals in the outlying sections of the city\r\nwondered briefly at the unwonted universal motionlessness and\r\nstagnation; then the racing taint in water and in air reached them, too,\r\nand they ceased wondering--forever.\r\n\r\nThen through those quiet halls Costigan stalked to a certain storage\r\nroom, where with all due precaution he donned his own suit of\r\nTriplanetary armor. Making an ungainly bundle of the other Solarian\r\nequipment stored there, he dragged it along behind him as he clanked\r\nback toward his prison, until he neared the dock at which was moored the\r\nNevian space-speedster which he was determined to take. Here, he knew,\r\nwas the first of many critical points. The crew of the vessel was\r\naboard, and, with its independent air-supply, unharmed. They had\r\nweapons, were undoubtedly alarmed, and were very probably highly\r\nsuspicious. They, too, had ultra-beams and might see him, but his very\r\ncloseness to them would tend to protect him from ultra-beam observation.\r\nTherefore he crouched tensely behind a buttress, staring through his\r\nspy-ray goggles, waiting for a moment when none of the Nevians would be\r\nnear the entrance, but grimly resolved to act instantly should he feel\r\nany touch of a spying ultra-beam.\r\n\r\n\"Here's where the pinch comes,\" he growled to himself. \"I know the\r\ncombination, but if they're suspicious enough and act quick enough they\r\ncan seal that door on me before I can get it open, and then rub me out\r\nlike a blot; but ... ah!\"\r\n\r\nThe moment had arrived, before the touch of any revealing ray. He\r\ntrained the key-tube, the entrance opened, and through that opening in\r\nthe instant of its appearance there shot a brittle bulb of glass, whose\r\nbreaking meant death. It crashed into fragments against a metallic wall\r\nand Costigan, entering the vessel, consigned its erstwhile crew one by\r\none to the already crowded waters of the lagoon. He then leaped to the\r\ncontrols and drove the captured speedster through the air, to plunge it\r\ndown upon the surface of the lagoon beside the door of the isolated\r\nstructure which had for so long been his prison. Carefully he\r\ntransferred to the vessel the motley assortment of containers of\r\nVee-Two, and after a quick check-up to make sure that he had overlooked\r\nnothing, he shot his craft straight up into the air. Then only did he\r\nclose his ultra-wave circuits and speak.\r\n\r\n\"Clio, Bradley--I got away clean, without a bit of trouble. Now I'm\r\ncoming after you, Clio.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's wonderful that you got away, Conway!\" the girl exclaimed. \"But\r\nhadn't you better get Captain Bradley first? Then, if anything should\r\nhappen, he would be of some use, while I....\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll knock him into an outside loop if he does!\" the captain snorted,\r\nand Costigan went on:\r\n\r\n\"You won't need to. You come first, Clio, of course. But you're too far\r\naway for me to see you with my spy, and I don't want to use the\r\nhigh-powered beam of this boat for fear of detection; so you'd better\r\nkeep on talking, so that I can trace you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's one thing I _am_ good at!\" Clio laughed in sheer relief. \"If\r\ntalking were music, I'd be a full brass band!\" and she kept up a flow of\r\ninconsequential chatter, until Costigan told her that it was no longer\r\nnecessary; that he had established the line.\r\n\r\n\"Any excitement around there yet?\" he asked her then.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing unusual that I can see,\" she replied. \"Why? Should there be\r\nsome?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not, but when I made my get-away I couldn't kill them all, of\r\ncourse, and I thought maybe they might connect things up with my\r\njail-break and tell the other cities to take steps about you two. But I\r\nguess they're pretty well disorganized back there yet, since they can't\r\nknow who hit them, or what with, or why. I must have got about everybody\r\nthat wasn't sealed up somewhere, and it doesn't stand to reason that\r\nthose who are left can check up very closely for a while yet. But\r\nthey're nobody's fools--they'll certainly get conscious when I snatch\r\nyou, maybe before ... there, I see your city, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Same as I did back there, if I can. Poison their primary air and all\r\nthe water I can reach....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Conway!\" Her voice rose to a scream. \"They must know--they're all\r\ngetting out of the water and are rushing inside the buildings as fast as\r\nthey possibly can!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see they are,\" grimly. \"I'm right over you now, 'way up. Been\r\nlocating their primary intake. They've got a dozen ships around it, and\r\nhave guards posted all along the corridors leading to it; and _those\r\nguards are wearing masks!_ They're clever birds, all right, those\r\namphibians--they know what they got back there and how they got it. That\r\nchanges things, girl! If we use gas here we won't stand a chance in the\r\nworld of getting old Bradley. Stand by to jump when I open that door!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry, dear! They are coming out here after me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure they are.\" Costigan had already seen the two Nevians swimming out\r\ntoward Clio's cage, and had hurled his vessel downward in a screaming\r\npower dive. \"You're too valuable a specimen for them to let you be\r\ngassed, but if they can get there before I do they're traveling fast!\"\r\n\r\nHe miscalculated slightly, so that instead of coming to a halt at the\r\nsurface of the liquid medium the speedster struck with a crash that\r\nhurled solid masses of water for hundreds of yards. But no ordinary\r\ncrash could harm that vessel's structure, her gravity controls were not\r\noverloaded, and she shot back to the surface; gallant ship and reckless\r\npilot alike unharmed. Costigan trained his key-tube upon the doorway of\r\nClio's cell, then tossed it aside.\r\n\r\n\"Different combinations over here!\" he barked. \"Got to cut you out--lie\r\ndown in that far corner!\"\r\n\r\nHis hands flashed over the panel, and as Clio fell prone without\r\nhesitation or question a heavy beam literally blasted away a large\r\nportion of the roof of the structure. The speedster shot into the air\r\nand dropped down until she rested upon the tops of opposite walls; walls\r\nstill glowing, semi-molten. The girl piled a stool upon the table and\r\nstood upon it, reached upward, and seized the mailed hands extended\r\ndownward toward her. Costigan heaved her up into the vessel with a\r\npowerful jerk, slammed the door shut, leaped to the controls, and the\r\nspeedster darted away.\r\n\r\n\"Your armor's in that bundle there. Better put it on, and check your\r\nLewistons and pistols--no telling what kind of jams we'll get into,\" he\r\nsnapped, without turning. \"Bradley, start talking ... all right, I've\r\ngot your line. Better get your wet rags ready and get organized\r\ngenerally--every second will count by the time we get there. We're\r\ncoming so fast that our outer plating's white hot, but it may not be\r\nfast enough, at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't fast enough, quite,\" Bradley announced, calmly. \"They're\r\ncoming out after me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't fight them and probably they won't paralyze you. Keep on talking,\r\nso that I can find out where they take you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No good, Costigan.\" The voice of the old space-flea did not reveal a\r\nsign of emotion as he made his dread announcement. \"They have it all\r\nfigured out. They're not taking any chances at all--they're going to\r\nparal....\" His voice broke off in the middle of the word.\r\n\r\nWith a bitter imprecation Costigan flashed on the powerful ultra-beam\r\nprojector of the speedster and focused the plate upon Bradley's prison;\r\ncareless now of detection, since the Nevians were already warned. Upon\r\nthat plate he watched the Nevians carry the helpless body of the captain\r\ninto a small boat, and continued to watch as they bore it into one of\r\nthe largest buildings of the city. Up a series of ramps they took the\r\nstill form, placing it finally upon a soft couch in an enormous and\r\nheavily guarded central hall. Costigan turned to his companion, Clio,\r\nand even through the helmets she could see plainly the white agony of\r\nhis expression. He moistened his lips and tried twice to speak--tried\r\nand failed: but he made no move either to cut off their power or to\r\nchange their direction.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she approved, steadily. \"We are going through. I know that\r\nyou _want_ to run with me, but if you actually did it, I would never\r\nwant to see you or hear of you again, and you would hate me forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly that.\" The anguish did not leave his eyes and his voice was\r\nhoarse and strained, but his hands did not vary the course of the\r\nspeedster by so much as a hair's breadth. \"You're the finest little\r\nfellow that ever waved a plume, and I would love you no matter what\r\nhappened. I'd trade my immortal soul to the devil if it would get you\r\nout of this mess, but we're both in it up to our necks and we can't dog\r\nit now. If they kill him we beat it--he and I both knew that it was on\r\nthe chance of that happening that I took you first--but as long as all\r\nthree of us are alive it's all three or none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she said again, as steadily, thrilled this time to the\r\ndepths of her being by the sheer manhood of him who had thus simply\r\nvoiced his Code; a man of such fiber that neither love of life, nor the\r\ninfinitely more powerful love of her which she knew he bore, could make\r\nhim lower its high standard.\r\n\r\n\"We are going through. Forget that I am a woman. We are three human\r\nbeings, fighting a world full of monsters. I am simply one of us three.\r\nI will steer your ship, fire your projectors, or throw your bombs. What\r\ncan I do best?\"\r\n\r\n\"Throw bombs,\" he directed, briefly. He knew what must be done were they\r\nto have even the slightest chance of winning clear. \"I'm going to blast\r\na hole down into the auditorium, and when I do you stand by that port\r\nand start dropping bottles of perfume. Throw a couple of big ones right\r\ndown the shaft I make, and the rest of them most anywhere, after I cut\r\nthe wall open. They'll do good wherever they hit, land or water.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Captain Bradley--he'll be gassed, too.\" Her fine eyes were\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n\"Can't be helped. I've got the antidote, and it'll work any time under\r\nan hour. That'll be lots of time--if we aren't gone in less than ten\r\nminutes we'll be staying here. They're bringing in platoons of militia\r\nin full armor, and if we don't beat those boys to it we're in for plenty\r\nof grief. All right--start throwing!\"\r\n\r\nThe speedster had come to a halt directly over the imposing edifice\r\nwithin which Bradley was incarcerated, and a mighty beam had flared\r\ndownward, digging a fiery well through floor after floor of stubborn\r\nmetal. The ceiling of the amphitheater pierced, the beam expired; and\r\ndown into that assembly hall there dropped two canisters of Vee-Two; to\r\ncrash and to fill its atmosphere with imperceptible death. Then the beam\r\nflashed on again, this time at maximum power, and with it Costigan\r\nburned away half of the gigantic building. Burned it away until room\r\nabove room gaped open, shelf-like, to outer atmosphere; the great hall\r\nnow resembling an over-size pigeon-hole surrounded by smaller ones. Into\r\nthat largest pigeon-hole the speedster darted, and cushioned desks and\r\nbenches crashed down, crushed flat under its enormous weight as it came\r\nto rest upon the floor.\r\n\r\nEvery available guard had been thrown into that room, regardless of\r\ncustomary occupation or of equipment. Most of them had been ordinary\r\nwatchmen, not even wearing masks, and all such were already down. Many,\r\nhowever, were protected by masks, and a few were dressed in full armor.\r\nBut no portable armor could mount defenses of sufficient power to\r\nwithstand the awful force of the speedster's weapons, and one flashing\r\nswing of a projector swept the hall almost clear of life.\r\n\r\n\"Can't shoot very close to Bradley with this big beam, but I'll mop up\r\non the rest of them by hand. Stay here and cover me, Clio!\" Costigan\r\nordered, and went to open the door.\r\n\r\n\"I can't--I won't!\" Clio replied instantly. \"I don't know the controls\r\nwell enough. I'd kill you or Captain Bradley, sure; but I _can_ shoot,\r\nand I'm going to!\" and she leaped out, close upon his heels.\r\n\r\nThus, flaming Lewiston in one hand and barking automatic in the other,\r\nthe two mailed figures advanced toward Bradley; now doubly helpless:\r\nparalyzed by his enemies and gassed by his friends. For a time the\r\nNevians melted away before them, but as they approached more nearly the\r\ncouch, upon which the captain was, they encountered six figures encased\r\nin armor fully as capable as their own. The beams of the Lewistons\r\nrebounded from that armor in futile pyrotechnics, the bullets of the\r\nautomatics spattered and exploded impotently against it. And behind that\r\nsingle line of armored guards were massed perhaps twenty unarmored, but\r\nmasked, soldiers; and scuttling up the ramps leading into the hall were\r\ncoming the platoons of heavily-armored figures which Costigan had\r\npreviously seen.\r\n\r\nDecision instantly made, Costigan ran back toward the speedster, but he\r\nwas not deserting his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Keep the good work up!\" he instructed the girl as he ran. \"I'll pick\r\nthose jaspers off with a pencil ray and then stand off the bunch that's\r\ncoming while you rub out the rest of that crew there and drag Bradley\r\nback here.\"\r\n\r\nBack at the control panel, he trained a narrow, but intensely dense\r\npencil of livid flame, and one by one the six armored figures fell.\r\nThen, knowing that Clio could handle the remaining opposition, he\r\ndevoted his attention to the reenforcements so rapidly approaching from\r\nthe sides. Again and again the heavy beam lashed out, now upon this\r\nside, now upon that, and in its flaming path Nevians disappeared. And\r\nnot only Nevians--in the incredible energy of that beam's blast, floor,\r\nwalls, ramps, and every material thing vanished in clouds of thick and\r\nbrilliant vapor. The room temporarily clear of foes, he sprang again to\r\nClio's assistance, but her task was nearly done. She had \"rubbed out\"\r\nall opposition and, tugging lustily at Bradley's feet, had already\r\ndragged him almost to the side of the speedster.\r\n\r\n\"'At-a-girl, Clio!\" cheered Costigan, as he picked up the burly captain\r\nand tossed him through the doorway. \"Highly useful, girl of my dreams,\r\nas well as ornamental. In with you, and we'll start out to go places!\"\r\n\r\nBut getting the speedster out of the now completely ruined hall proved\r\nto be much more of a task than driving it in had been, for scarcely had\r\nthe Terrestrials closed their locks than a section of the building\r\ncollapsed behind them, cutting off their retreat. Nevian submarines and\r\nairships were beginning to arrive upon the scene, and were raying the\r\nbuilding viciously in an attempt to entrap or to crush the Terrestrials\r\nin its ruins. Costigan managed finally to blast his way out, but the\r\nNevians had had time to assemble in force and he was met by a\r\nconcentrated storm of beams and of metal from every inimical weapon\r\nwithin range.\r\n\r\nBut not for nothing had Conway Costigan selected for his dash for\r\nliberty the craft which, save only for the two immense interstellar\r\ncruisers, was the most powerful vessel ever built upon red Nevia. And\r\nnot for nothing had he studied minutely and to the last, least detail\r\nevery item of its controls and of its armament during wearily long days\r\nand nights of solitary imprisonment. He had studied it under test, in\r\naction, and at rest; studied it until he knew thoroughly its every\r\npossibility--and what a ship it was! The iron-driven generators of his\r\nshielding screens handled with ease the terrific load of the Nevians'\r\nassault, his polycyclic screens were proof against any material\r\nprojectile, and the machines supplying his offensive beams with power\r\nwere more than equal to their tasks. Driven now at full rating those\r\nfrightful weapons lashed out against the Nevian blocking the way, and\r\nunder their impacts her screens flared brilliantly through the spectrum\r\nand went down. And in the instant of their failure the enemy vessel was\r\nliterally blown into nothingness--no unprotected metal, however\r\nresistant, could exist for a moment in the pathway of those iron-driven\r\ntornadoes of pure energy.\r\n\r\nShip after ship of the Nevians plunged toward the speedster in\r\ndesperately suicidal attempts to ram her down, but each met the same\r\nflaming fate before its mass could collide with the ship of the\r\nTerrestrials. Then, from the grouped submarines far below, there reached\r\nup red rods of force, which seized the space-ship and began relentlessly\r\nto draw her down.\r\n\r\n\"What are they doing that for, Conway? _They_ can't fight us!\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't want to fight us. They want to hold us, but I know what to\r\ndo about that, too,\" and the powerful tractor rods snapped as a plane of\r\nlurid light drove through them. Upward now at the highest permissible\r\nvelocity the speedster leaped, and past the few ships remaining above\r\nher she dodged; there was nothing now between her and the freedom of\r\nboundless space.\r\n\r\n\"You did it, Conway; you did it!\" Clio exulted. \"Oh, Conway, you're just\r\nsimply wonderful!\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't done it yet,\" Costigan cautioned her. \"The worst is yet to\r\ncome. Nerado. He's why they wanted to hold us back, and why I was in\r\nsuch a hurry to get away. That boat of his is bad medicine, girl, and we\r\nwant to put plenty of kilometers behind us before he gets started.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you think he will chase us?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Think_ so? I _know_ so! The mere facts, that we are rare specimens and\r\nthat he told us that we were going to stay there all the rest of our\r\nlives, would make him chase us clear to Dustheimer's Nebula. Besides\r\nthat, we stepped on their toes pretty heavily before we left. We know\r\naltogether too much now to be let get back to Tellus; and finally,\r\nthey'd all die of acute enlargement of the spleen if we get away with\r\nthis prize ship of theirs. I hope to tell you they'll chase us!\"\r\n\r\nHe fell silent, devoting his whole attention to his piloting, driving\r\nhis craft onward at such velocity that its outer plating held steadily\r\nat the highest point of temperature compatible with safety. Soon they\r\nwere out in open space, hurtling toward the sun under the drive of every\r\npossible iota of power, and Costigan took off his armor and turned\r\ntoward the helpless body of the captain.\r\n\r\n\"He looks so ... so ... so _dead_, Conway! Are you really sure that you\r\ncan bring him to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. Lots of time yet. Just three simple squirts in the right\r\nplaces will do the trick.\" He took from a locked compartment of his\r\narmor a small steel box, which housed a surgeon's hypodermic and three\r\nvials. One, two, three, he injected small, but precisely measured\r\namounts of the fluids into the three vital localities, then placed the\r\ninert form upon a deeply cushioned couch.\r\n\r\n\"There! That'll take care of the gas in five or six hours. The paralysis\r\nwill wear off before that, so he'll be all right when he wakes up; and\r\nwe're going away from here with every watt of power we can put out. We\r\nhave done everything I know how to do, for the present.\"\r\n\r\nThen only did Costigan turn and look down, directly into Clio's eyes.\r\nWide, eloquent blue eyes that gazed back up into his, tender and\r\nunafraid; eyes freighted with the oldest message of woman to chosen man.\r\nHis hard young face softened wonderfully as he stared at her; there were\r\ntwo quick steps and they were in each other's arms. Clio's lithely\r\nrounded form nestled against Costigan's powerful body as his mighty arms\r\ntightened around her; his neck and shoulder were no less\r\nenthusiastically clasped, and less strongly only because of her woman's\r\nslighter musculature. Lips upon eager lips, blue eyes to gray,\r\nmotionless they stood clasped in ecstasy; thinking nothing of the\r\ndreadful past, nothing of the fearful future, conscious only of the\r\nglorious, the wonderful present.\r\n\r\n\"Clio mine ... darling ... girl, girl, how I love you!\" Costigan's deep\r\nvoice was husky with emotion. \"I haven't kissed you for seven thousand\r\nyears! I don't rate you, by hundreds of steps; but if I can just get you\r\nout of this mess, I swear by all the space....\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't, lover. Rate _me_? Good Heavens, Conway? It's just the\r\nother way....\"\r\n\r\n\"Chop it!\" he commanded in her ear. \"I'm still dizzy at the idea of your\r\nloving me at all, to say nothing of loving me _this_ way! But you do,\r\nand that's all I ask, here or hereafter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Love you? _Love_ you!\" Their mutual embrace tightened and her low voice\r\nthrilled brokenly as she went on: \"Conway, dearest.... I can't say a\r\nthing, but you know.... Oh, Conway!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a time Clio drew a long and tremulous, but supremely happy breath\r\nas the realities of their predicament once more obtruded themselves upon\r\nher consciousness. She released herself gently from Costigan's arms.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think that there is a chance of us getting back to the\r\nearth, so that we can be together ... always?\"\r\n\r\n\"A chance, yes. A probability, no,\" he replied, unequivocally. \"It\r\ndepends upon two things. First, how much of a start we got on Nerado.\r\nHis ship is the biggest and fastest thing I ever saw, and if he strips\r\nher down and drives her--which he will--he'll catch us long before we\r\ncan make Tellus. On the other hand, I gave Rodebush a lot of data, and\r\nif he and Lyman Cleveland can add it to their own stuff and get that\r\nsuper-ship of ours rebuilt in time, they'll be out here on the prowl;\r\nand they'll have what can give even Nerado plenty of argument. No use\r\nworrying about it, anyway. We won't know anything until we can detect\r\none or the other of them, and then will be the time to do something\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Nerado catches us, will you....\" She paused.\r\n\r\n\"Rub you out? I will not. Even if he does catch us, and takes us back to\r\nNevia, I won't. There's lots more time coming onto the clock. Nerado\r\nwon't hurt either of us badly enough to leave scars, either physical,\r\nmental, or moral. I'd kill you in a second if it were Roger; he's dirty\r\nand he's thoroughly bad. But Nerado's a good enough old scout, in his\r\nway. He's big and he's clean. You know, I could really like that fish,\r\nif I could meet him on terms of equality sometime?\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ couldn't!\" she declared, vigorously. \"He's crawly and scaly and\r\nsnaky; and he smells so ... so....\"\r\n\r\n\"So rank and fishy?\" Costigan laughed deeply. \"Details, girl; mere\r\ndetails. I've seen people who looked like money in the bank and who\r\nsmelled like a bouquet of violets that you couldn't trust half the\r\nlength of Nerado's neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"But look what he did to us!\" she protested. \"And they weren't trying to\r\nrecapture us back there; they were trying to kill us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was perfectly all right, what he did and what they did--what else\r\ncould they have done?\" he wanted to know. \"And while you're looking,\r\nlook at what we did to them--plenty, I'd say. But we all had it to do,\r\nand neither side will blame the other for doing it. He's a square\r\nshooter, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe, but I don't like him a bit, and let's not talk about him\r\nany more. Let's talk about us. Remember what you said once, when you\r\nadvised me to 'let you lay,' or whatever it was?\" Woman-like, she wished\r\nto dip again lightly into the waters of pure emotion, even though she\r\nhad such a short time before led the man out of their profoundest\r\ndepths. But Costigan, into whose hard life love of woman had never\r\nbefore entered, had not yet recovered sufficiently from his soul-shaking\r\nplunge to follow her lead. Inarticulate, distrusting his newly found\r\nsupreme happiness, he must needs stay out of those enchanted waters or\r\nplunge again. And he was afraid to plunge--diffident, still deeming\r\nhimself unworthy of the miracle of this wonder-girl's love--even though\r\nevery fiber of his being shrieked its demand to feel again that slender\r\nbody in his clasping arms. He did not consciously think those thoughts.\r\nHe acted them without thinking; they were inherent in his personality.\r\n\r\n\"I do remember, and I still think it's a sound idea, even though I am\r\ntoo far gone now to let you put it into effect,\" he assured her, half\r\nseriously. He kissed her, tenderly and reverently, then studied her\r\ncarefully. \"But you look as though you'd been on a Martian picnic. When\r\ndid you eat last?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember, exactly. This morning, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or maybe last night, or yesterday morning? I thought so! Bradley and I\r\ncan eat anything that's chewable, and drink anything that will pour, but\r\nyou can't. I'll scout around and see if I can't fix up something that\r\nyou'll be able to eat.\"\r\n\r\nHe rummaged through the store-rooms, emerging with sundry viands from\r\nwhich he prepared a highly satisfactory meal.\r\n\r\n\"Think you can sleep now, sweetheart?\" After supper, once more within\r\nthe circle of Costigan's arms, Clio nodded her head against his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I can, dear. Now that you are with me, out here alone, I'm\r\nnot a bit afraid any more. You will get us back to the earth some way,\r\nsometime; I just know that you will. Good-night, Conway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, Clio ... little sweetheart,\" he whispered, and went back to\r\nBradley's side.\r\n\r\nIn due time the captain recovered consciousness, and slept. Then for\r\ndays the speedster flashed on toward our distant solar system; days\r\nduring which her wide-flung detector screens remained cold.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether I'm afraid they'll hit something or afraid that\r\nthey won't,\" Costigan remarked more than once, but finally those tenuous\r\nsentinels did in fact encounter an interfering vibration. Along the\r\ndetector line a visibeam sped, and Costigan's face hardened as he saw\r\nthe unmistakable outline of Nerado's interstellar cruiser, far behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Well, a stern chase always was a long one,\" Costigan said finally. \"He\r\ncan't catch us for plenty of days yet ... now what?\" for the alarms of\r\nthe detectors had broken out anew. There was still another point of\r\ninterference to be investigated. Costigan traced it; and there, almost\r\ndead ahead of them, between them and their sun, nearing them at the\r\nincomprehensible rate of the sum of the two vessels' velocities, came\r\nanother cruiser of the Nevians!\r\n\r\n\"Must be the sister-ship, coming back from our System with a load of\r\niron,\" Costigan deduced. \"Heavily loaded as she is, we may be able to\r\ndodge her; and she's coming so fast that if we can stay out of her range\r\nwe'll be all right--she won't be able to stop for probably three or four\r\ndays. But if our super-ship is anywhere in these parts, now's the time\r\nfor her to rally 'round!\"\r\n\r\nHe gave the speedster all the side-thrust she would take; then, putting\r\nevery available communicator tube behind a tight beam, he drove it\r\nsunward and began sending out a long-continued call to his fellows of\r\nTriplanetary's Secret Service.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer the Nevian flashed, trying with all her power to\r\nintercept the speedster; and it soon became evident that, heavily laden\r\nthough she was, she could make enough sideway to bring her within range\r\nat the time of meeting.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, they've got partial neutralization of inertia, the same as\r\nwe have,\" Costigan cogitated, \"and by the way he's coming I'd say that\r\nhe had orders to blow us out of the ether--he knows as well as we do\r\nthat he can't capture us alive at anything like the relative velocities\r\nwe've got now. I can't give her any more side thrust without overloading\r\nthe gravity controls, so overloaded they've got to be. Strap down, you\r\ntwo, because they may go out entirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that you can pull away from them, Conway?\" Clio was\r\nstaring in horrified fascination into the plate, watching the pictured\r\nvessel increase in size, moment by moment.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, girl, but I'm going to try. Just in case we don't,\r\nthough, I'm going to keep on yelling for help. In solid? All right,\r\nboat, DO YOUR STUFF!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n  The Meeting of the Giants\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Check your blast, Fred, I think I hear something trying to come\r\nthrough!\" Cleveland called out, sharply. For days the _Boise_ had torn\r\nthrough the illimitable reaches of empty space, and now the long vigil\r\nof the keen-eared listeners was to be ended. Rodebush cut off his power,\r\nand through the deafening roar of tube-noise an almost inaudible voice\r\nmade itself heard.\r\n\r\n\" ... all the help you can give us. Samms--Cleveland--Rodebush--anybody\r\nof Triplanetary who can hear me, listen! This is Costigan, with Miss\r\nMarsden and Captain Bradley, heading for where we think the sun is, from\r\nright ascension about six hours, declination about plus fourteen\r\ndegrees. Distance unknown, but probably hundreds of light-years. Trace\r\nmy call. One Nevian ship is overhauling us slowly, another is coming\r\ntoward us from the sun. We may or may not be able to dodge it, but we\r\nneed all the help you can give us. Samms--Rodebush--Cleveland--anybody\r\nof Triplanetary....\"\r\n\r\nEndlessly the faint, faint voice went on, but Rodebush and Cleveland\r\nwere no longer listening. Sensitive ultra-loops had been swung, and\r\nalong the indicated line shot Triplanetary's super-ship at a velocity\r\nwhich she had never before even approached; the utterly\r\nincomprehensible, almost incalculable velocity attained by inertialess\r\nmatter, driven through an almost perfect vacuum by the _Boise_'s maximum\r\nprojector blast--a blast which would lift her stupendous normal tonnage\r\nagainst a gravity five times that of earth's! At the full frightful\r\nmeasure of that velocity the super-ship literally annihilated distance,\r\nwhile ahead of her the furiously driven, but scarcely faster spy-ray\r\nbeam tore on in quest of the three Terrestrials who were calling for\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n\"Got any idea how fast we're going?\" Rodebush demanded, glancing up for\r\nan instant from the observation plate. \"We should be able to see him,\r\nsince we could hear him, and our range is certainly as great as anything\r\nhe can have.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, can't figure velocity without any reliable data on how many atoms\r\nof matter exist per cubic meter out here.\" Cleveland was staring at the\r\ncalculator. \"It's constant, of course, at the value at which the\r\nfriction of the medium is equal to our thrust. Incidentally, we can't\r\nhold it long. We're running a temperature, which shows that we're\r\nstepping along faster than anybody ever computed before. Taking\r\nThrockmorton's estimates it figures somewhere near the order of\r\nmagnitude of ten to the twenty-seventh. Fast enough, anyway, so you'd\r\nbetter bend an eye on that plate. Even after you see him you won't know\r\nanything about where he really is, because we don't know any of the\r\nvelocities involved--our own, his, or that of the beam--and we may be\r\nright on top of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or, if we are outrunning the beam, we won't see him at all. That makes\r\nit nice piloting.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to handle things when we get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lock to them and take them aboard if we're in time. If not, if they are\r\nfighting already--_there they are_!\"\r\n\r\nThe picture of the speedster's control room flashed upon the plate and\r\nCostigan's voice greeted them from the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, fellows, welcome to our city! Where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know,\" Cleveland snapped back, \"and we don't know where you\r\nare, either. Can't figure anything without data. I see you're still\r\nbreathing air. Where are the Nevians? How much time we got yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not enough, I'm afraid. By the looks of things they will be within\r\nrange of us in a couple of hours, and you're so far away yet that it\r\ntook our voices four minutes and about fifty seconds to make the round\r\ntrip, _on the ultra_! Play that on your calculator, Lyman! You haven't\r\neven touched our detector screen yet. I'm mighty glad to have seen you\r\nfellows again, though, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"A couple of hours!\" In his relief Cleveland almost shouted the words.\r\n\"That's time to burn. We can be clear out of the Galaxy in less\r\nthan....\" He broke off at a yell from Rodebush.\r\n\r\n\"Broadcast, Conway, broadcast!\" that worthy had cried, as Costigan's\r\nimage had disappeared utterly from his plate.\r\n\r\nNow he cut off the _Boise_'s power, stopping her instantaneously in\r\nmid-space, but the connection had been broken. Costigan could not\r\npossibly have heard the orders to change his beam signal to a broadcast,\r\nso that they could pick it up; nor would it have done any good if he had\r\nheard and had obeyed. So immeasurably great had been their velocity that\r\nthey had flashed past the speedster without seeing it, even upon the\r\nultra-plates, and now they were unknown billions of miles beyond the\r\nfugitives they had come so far to help--far beyond the range of any\r\npossible broadcast. But Cleveland had understood instantly what had\r\nhappened. He now had a little data upon which to work, and his fingers\r\nwere flying over the keys of the calculator.\r\n\r\n\"Back blast, maximum, seventeen seconds!\" he directed, crisply. \"Not\r\nexact, of course, but that'll put us close enough to find 'em with our\r\ndetectors!\"\r\n\r\nThen for the calculated seventeen seconds the super-ship retraced her\r\npath, at the same awful speed with which she had come so far. The blast\r\nexpired and there, plainly limned upon the observation plates, was the\r\nNevian speedster.\r\n\r\n\"As a computer you're good,\" Rodebush applauded. \"So close that we can't\r\nuse the neutralizers to catch him. If we use a dyne of driving force\r\nwe'll overshoot him a million kilometers before I can snap the switches\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet he's so far away and going so fast that if we keep our inertia\r\non it'll take all day at full drive to overtake him.\" Cleveland was\r\nfrankly puzzled. \"What to do? Shunt in a potentiometer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we don't need it.\" Rodebush turned to the transmitter. \"Costigan!\r\nWe are going to take hold of you with a very light tractor. Don't cut\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"A tractor--inertialess?\" Cleveland wondered.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Rodebush launched the tractor, set at its absolute minimum of\r\npower, and threw in his master switches.\r\n\r\nWhile hundreds of thousands of miles separating the two vessels and the\r\ntractor beam was exerting the least effort of which it was capable, yet\r\nthe super-ship leaped toward the smaller craft at a pace which covered\r\nthat distance in the twinkling of an eye. So rapidly were the objectives\r\nenlarging upon the plates that the automatic focusing devices could\r\nscarcely function rapidly enough to keep them in place. Cleveland\r\nflinched involuntarily and seized his arm-rests in a spasmodic clutch as\r\nhe watched this, the first inertialess space-approach; and even\r\nRodebush, who knew better than anyone else what to expect, held his\r\nbreath and swallowed hard at the unbelievable rate at which the two\r\nvessels were rushing together.\r\n\r\nAnd if these two, who had rebuilt the space-flyer, could hardly control\r\nthemselves, what of the three in the speedster, who knew nothing\r\nwhatever of the super-ship's potentialities? Clio, staring into the\r\nplate with Costigan, uttered a piercing shriek, as she sank her fingers\r\ninto his shoulders. Bradley swore a mighty deep-space oath and braced\r\nhimself against certain annihilation. Costigan stared for an instant,\r\nunable to believe his eyes, then his hand darted to the contacts which\r\nwould cut the beam. Too late. Before his flying fingers could reach the\r\nstuds the _Boise_ was upon them; had struck them in direct central\r\nimpact. Moving at the full measure of her unthinkable velocity though\r\nthe super-ship was at the moment of impact, yet the most delicate\r\nrecording instruments of the speedster could not detect the slightest\r\nshock as the enormous globe struck the comparatively tiny torpedo and\r\nclung to it; accommodating instantly and effortlessly her own terrific\r\npace to that of the smaller and infinitely slower craft. Clio sobbed in\r\nrelief and Costigan, one arm around her, sighed hugely.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you space-fleas!\" he cried. \"Glad to see you and all that, but you\r\nmight as well kill a man outright as scare him to death! So that's the\r\nsuper-ship, huh? SOME ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Conway!\" \"Clear ether, Conway!\" The two scientists answered the\r\nhail of their fellow.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't realize that an inertialess approach would be quite such a\r\nterrifying spectacle, or I would have warned you,\" Rodebush went on.\r\n\"Yes, thanks to you, the super-ship works as she should, at last. But\r\nyou had better put on your suits and transfer. You might get your things\r\nready....\"\r\n\r\n\"'Things' is good!\" Costigan laughed, and Clio giggled sunnily.\r\n\r\n\"We've made so many transfers already that what you see us in is all we\r\nhave,\" Bradley explained. \"We'll bring ourselves, and we'll hurry; that\r\nNevian is coming up fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything on this ship you fellows want?\" Costigan asked.\r\n\r\n\"There may be, but we haven't any locks big enough to let her inside and\r\nwe haven't time to study her now. You might leave her controls in\r\nneutral, so that Lyman can calculate her position if we should want her\r\nlater on.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\" The three armor-clad figures stepped into the _Boise_'s\r\nopen lock, the tractor beam was cut off, and the speedster flashed away\r\nfrom the now stationary super-ship.\r\n\r\n\"Better let formalities go for a while,\" Captain Bradley interrupted the\r\ngeneral introduction taking place. \"I was scared out of nine years'\r\ngrowth when I saw you coming at us, and maybe I've still got the humps;\r\nbut that Nevian is coming up fast, and if you don't already know it I\r\ncan tell you that he's no light cruiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so, too,\" Costigan concurred. \"Have you fellows got enough stuff\r\nso that you think you can take him? You've got the legs on him,\r\nanyway--you can certainly run if you want to!\"\r\n\r\n\"Run?\" Cleveland laughed. \"We have a bone of our own to pick with that\r\nship. We licked her to a standstill once, until we burned out a set of\r\ngenerators, and since we got them fixed we've been chasing her all over\r\nspace. We were chasing her when we picked up your call. See there? She's\r\ndoing the running.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nevian was running, in truth. Her commander had seen and had\r\nrecognized the great vessel which had flashed out of nowhere to the\r\nrescue of the three Terrestrials; and, having once been at grips with\r\nthat vengeful super-dreadnaught, he had little stomach for another\r\nencounter. Therefore his side-thrust was now being exerted in the\r\nopposite direction; he was frankly trying to put as much distance as\r\npossible between himself and Triplanetary's formidable cruiser. In vain.\r\nA light tractor was clamped on and the _Boise_ flashed up to close range\r\nbefore Rodebush threw on her inertia and Cleveland brought the two\r\nvessels relatively to rest by increasing gradually his tractor's pull.\r\nAnd this time the Nevian could not cut the tractor. Again that shearing\r\nplane of force bit into it and tore at it, but it neither yielded nor\r\nbroke. The rebuilt generators of Number Four were designed to carry the\r\nload, and they carried it. And again Triplanetary's every mighty weapon\r\nwas brought into play.\r\n\r\nThe \"cans\" were thrown, ultra-and infra-beams were driven, the furious\r\nmacro-beam gnawed hungrily at the Nevian's defenses; and one by one\r\nthose defenses went down. In desperation the enemy commander threw his\r\nevery generator behind a polycyclic screen; only to see Cleveland's even\r\nmore powerful drill bore relentlessly through it. Punctured that last\r\ndefense, the end came soon. A secondary SX7 beam was now in place on\r\nmighty Ten's inner rings, and one fierce blast blew a hole completely\r\nthrough the Nevian cruiser. Into that hole entered Adlington's terrific\r\nbombs and their gruesome fellows, and where they entered, life departed.\r\nAll defenses vanished, and under the blasts of the _Boise_'s projectors,\r\nnow unopposed, the metal of the Nevian vessel exploded instantly into a\r\nwidely spreading cloud of vapor. Sparkling vapor, with perhaps here and\r\nthere a droplet or two of material which had only been liquefied.\r\n\r\nSo passed the sister-ship, and Rodebush turned his plates upon the\r\nvessel of Nerado. But that highly intelligent amphibian had seen all\r\nthat had occurred. He had long since given over the pursuit of the\r\nspeedster, and he did not rush in to do hopeless battle beside his\r\nfellow Nevians against the Terrestrials. His analytical detectors had\r\nwritten down each detail of every weapon and of every screen employed;\r\nand even while prodigious streamers of red force were raving out from\r\nhis vessel, braking her terrific progress and swinging her around in an\r\nimmense circle back toward far Nevia, his scientists and mechanics were\r\ndoubling and redoubling the power of his already Titanic installations,\r\nto match and if possible to overmatch those of Triplanetary's\r\nsuper-dreadnaught.\r\n\r\n\"Do we kill him now or do we let him suffer a while longer?\" Costigan\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, yet,\" replied Rodebush. \"Would you, Lyman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" replied Cleveland, grimly, reading the thought of the other\r\nand agreeing with it. \"Let him pilot us to Nevia; we might not be able\r\nto find it without a guide. While we're at it we want to so pulverize\r\nthat crowd that if they never come near the Solarian system again\r\nthey'll think it's twenty minutes too soon!\"\r\n\r\nThus it was that the _Boise_, under only a few dynes of propulsion,\r\npursued the Nevian ship. Apparently exerting every effort, she never\r\ncame quite within range of the fleeing raider; yet never was she so far\r\nbehind that the Nevian space-ship was not in clear register upon her\r\nobservation plates. Nor was Nerado alone in strengthening his vessel.\r\nCostigan knew well and respected highly the Nevian scientist-captain,\r\nand at his suggestion the entire time of the long and uneventful flight\r\nwas spent in re-enforcing the super-ship's armament to the iron-driven\r\nlimit of theoretical and mechanical possibility.\r\n\r\nThus, when Nevia and her hot, blue sun appeared upon his plates Rodebush\r\nwas ready for any emergency, and hurled his battleship upon the Nevian\r\nwith every weapon aflame. But so was Nerado ready; and, unlike her\r\nsister-ship, his vessel was manned by scientists well versed in the\r\nfundamental theory of the weapons with which they fought. Beams, rods,\r\nand lances of energy flamed and flared; planes and pencils cut, slashed,\r\nand stabbed; defensive screens glowed redly or flashed suddenly into\r\nintensely brilliant, coruscating incandescence. Crimson opacity\r\nstruggled sullenly against violet curtain of annihilation. Material\r\nprojectiles and torpedoes were launched under full beam control; only to\r\nbe exploded harmlessly in mid-space, to be rayed into nothingness, or to\r\ndisappear innocuously against impenetrable polycyclic screens. Both\r\nvessels were equipped completely with iron-driven mechanisms; both were\r\nmanned by scientists capable of wringing the last possible watt of power\r\nfrom their sources. They were approximately equal in size, and each ship\r\nnow wielded the theoretical ultimate of power for her mass; therefore\r\nneither could harm the other, furiously though each was trying. And more\r\nand more nearly they were approaching the red atmosphere of the world of\r\nthe amphibians. Down into that crimson blanket the two warring\r\nspace-ships dropped, down toward a city which Costigan recognized as\r\nthat in which Nerado made his headquarters.\r\n\r\n\"Better hold off a bit,\" Costigan cautioned. \"If I know that bird at\r\nall, he's cooking up something,\" and even as he spoke there shot upward\r\nfrom the city a multitude of flashing balls. The Nevians had mastered\r\nthe secret of the explosive of the fishes of the greater deeps and were\r\nlaunching it in a veritable storm against the Terrestrial visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Those?\" asked Rodebush, calmly. The detonating balls of destruction\r\nwere literally annihilating even the atmosphere beyond the polycyclic\r\nscreen, but that barrier was scarcely affected.\r\n\r\n\"No, that,\" pointing out a hemispherical dome which, redly translucent,\r\nsurrounded a group of buildings towering high above their neighbors.\r\n\"Neither those high towers nor those screens were there the last time I\r\nwas in this town. They're stalling for time down there, that's all those\r\nfireballs are for. Good sign, too--maybe they aren't ready for us yet.\r\nIf not, you'd better take 'em while the taking's good; and if they _are_\r\nready for us, we'd better get out of here while we're all in one piece.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in fact Nerado had been in touch with the scientists of his city;\r\nhad been instructing them in the construction of converters and\r\ngenerators of such weight and power that they could crush even the\r\ndefenses of the super-ship. They were not, however, quite done; the\r\nentirely unsuspected possibilities of speed inherent in absolute\r\ninertialessness had not entered into Nerado's calculations.\r\n\r\n\"Better drop a few cans down on that dome, fellows, before they make\r\ntrouble for us,\" suggested Rodebush to his gunners.\r\n\r\n\"We can't,\" came Adlington's instant reply. \"We've been trying it, but\r\nthat's a polycyclic screen. Can you drill it? If you can, I've got a\r\nreal bomb here--that special we built--that will do the trick if you can\r\nprotect it from their beams until it gets down into the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try it,\" Cleveland answered, at a nod from the physicist. \"I\r\ncouldn't drill Nerado's polycyclics, but I couldn't use any momentum on\r\nhim. Couldn't ram him--he fell back with my thrust. But that screen down\r\nthere can't back off, so maybe I can work on it. Get your special ready,\r\nand hang on, everybody!\"\r\n\r\nThe _Boise_ looped upward, and from an altitude of miles dove downward\r\nthrough a storm of force-balls, rays, and shells; a dive checked\r\nabruptly as the hollow tube of energy, which was Cleveland's drill,\r\nsnarled savagely down ahead of her and struck the shielding hemisphere\r\nwith a grinding, lightning-splitting shock. As it struck, backed by all\r\nthe enormous momentum of the plunging space-ship and driven by the full\r\npower of her mightiest generators, it bored in, clawing and gouging\r\nviciously through the tissue of that rigid and unyielding barrier of\r\npure energy. Then, mighty drill and plunging mass against iron-driven\r\nwall, eye-tearing and furiously spectacular warfare was waged. Well it\r\nwas for Triplanetary, that day, that its super ship carried ample supply\r\nof allotropic iron; well it was that her originally Gargantuan\r\nconverters and generators had been doubled and quadrupled in power on\r\nthe long Nevian way! For that oven-girdled fortress was powered to\r\nwithstand any conceivable assault; but the _Boise_'s power and momentum\r\nwere now inconceivable, and every watt and every dyne was solidly behind\r\nthat hellishly flaming, that voraciously tearing, that irresistibly\r\nravening cylinder of energy incredible!\r\n\r\nThrough the Nevian shield that cylinder gnawed its frightful way, and\r\ndown its protecting length there drove Adlington's \"Special\" bomb.\r\n\"Special\" it was indeed; so great of girth that it could barely pass\r\nthrough the central orifice of Ten's mighty projector, so heavily\r\ncharged with sensitized atomic iron that its detonation upon any planet\r\nwould not have been considered for an instant if that planet's integrity\r\nmeant anything to its attackers. Down the shielding pipe of force the\r\n\"Special\" screamed under full propulsion, and beneath the surface of\r\nNevia's ocean it plunged.\r\n\r\n\"Cut!\" yelled Adlington, and as the scintillating drill expired, the\r\nbomber snapped his detonating switch.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the effect of the explosion seemed unimportant. A dull, low\r\nrumble was all that was to be heard of a concussion that jarred red\r\nNevia to her very center; and all that could be seen was a slow heaving\r\nof the water. But that heaving did not cease. Slowly, _so_ slowly it\r\nseemed to the observers now high in the heavens, the waters rose up and\r\nparted; revealing a vast chasm blown deep into the ocean's rocky bed.\r\nHigher and higher the lazy, mountains of water reared; effortlessly to\r\npick up, to smash, to grind into fragments, and finally to toss aside\r\nevery building, every structure, every scrap of material substance\r\npertaining to the whole Nevian city.\r\n\r\nFlattened out, driven backward for miles the tortured waters were urged,\r\nleaving exposed bare ground and broken rock where once had been the\r\nocean's busy floor; while tremendous blasts of incandescent gas raved\r\nupward, buffeting even the enormous masses of the two space-ships,\r\npoised by their breathless crews so high above the site of the\r\nexplosion. Then the displaced millions of tons of water rushed back into\r\nthat newly rived pit, seeming to seek in that mad rush to make even more\r\ncomplete the already total destruction of the city. The raging torrents\r\npoured into that yawning cavern, filled it, and piled mountainously\r\nabove it; receding and piling up, again and again, causing tidal waves\r\nwhich swept a full half of Nevia's mighty, watery globe.\r\n\r\nThe city forever silenced, Rodebush again directed his weapons upon\r\nNerado's vessel, but the Nevian was no longer fighting. For the first\r\ntime in that long and bitter engagement, not a Nevian beam was in\r\noperation. His screens, however, were as capable as ever, and after a\r\nfew fruitless attempts to make an impression upon them, Rodebush cut off\r\nhis own offensive and turned to Costigan.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it, Conway? You know these people better than we\r\ndo; what are they up to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to talk to you,\" Nerado's voice came from the speaker, \"and I\r\ncould not do so while the beams were operating. You are, I now perceive,\r\na much higher form of life than any of us had thought possible; a form\r\nperhaps as high in evolution as our own. It is a pity that we did not\r\nmeet you when we first neared your planet, so that much life, both\r\nTellurian and Nevian, might have been spared. But what is past cannot be\r\nrecalled. As reasoning beings, however, you will see the futility of\r\ncontinuing a contest in which neither of us is capable of injuring the\r\nother. You may, of course, destroy more of our Nevian cities, in which\r\ncase I should be compelled to go and destroy similarly upon your earth;\r\nbut, to reasoning minds, such a course of procedure is sheerest folly.\"\r\n\r\nRodebush cut the communicator beam.\r\n\r\n\"Does he mean it?\" he demanded of Costigan. \"It sounds reasonable,\r\nbut....\"\r\n\r\n\"But fishy,\" broke in Cleveland. \"Altogether too reasonable for a....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he means it; every word of it,\" interrupted Costigan in turn.\r\n\"That's the way they are. Reasonable, passionless. Funny--they lack a\r\nlot of things we have, but they've got a lot of things that I wish more\r\nof us Tellurians had too. Give me the plate--I'll talk for\r\nTriplanetary,\" and the beam was restored.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Nerado.\" he greeted the Nevian commander. \"Having been with you\r\nand among your people, I know that you mean what you say and that you\r\nspeak for your race. Similarly, I believe that I can speak for the\r\nTriplanetary Council--the government of three of the planets of our\r\nsolar system--in saying that there need be no more conflict between our\r\npeoples. I also was compelled by circumstances to do certain things\r\nwhich I now wish could be undone; but as you have said, the past is\r\npast. Our two races have much to gain from each other by friendly\r\nexchanges of materials and of ideas, while we can expect nothing except\r\nmutual extermination, if we elect to continue this warfare. I offer you\r\nthe friendship of Triplanetary. Will you release your screens and come\r\naboard to sign a treaty?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will come; my screens are down.\" Rodebush likewise cut off his power,\r\nalthough somewhat apprehensively, and a Nevian lifeboat entered the main\r\nairlock of the _Boise_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, at a table in the control room of Triplanetary's first super-ship,\r\nthere was written the first Inter-Systemic Treaty. Upon one side the\r\nthree Nevians; amphibious, cone-headed, loop-necked, scale-bodies,\r\nfour-legged things to us monstrosities: upon the other the three humans,\r\nair-breathing, rounded-headed, shortnecked, smooth-bodied, two-legged\r\ncreatures equally monstrous to the fastidious Nevians. Yet each of these\r\nrepresentatives, of two races so different, felt respect for the other\r\nrace increase within him minute by minute as the conversation went on.\r\n\r\nThe Nevians had destroyed Pittsburgh, but Adlington's bomb had blown an\r\nequally populous Nevian city out of existence. One Nevian vessel had\r\nwiped out an entire unit of Triplanetary's fleet; but Costigan,\r\npractically unaided, had depopulated one Nevian city and had seriously\r\ndamaged another. He had also beamed down many Nevian ships. Therefore\r\nloss of life and material could be balanced. The Solarian system was\r\nrich in iron, to which the Nevians were welcome; red Nevia possessed\r\nabundant stores of substances which upon earth were extremely rare and\r\nof vital importance. Therefore commerce was to be encouraged. The\r\nNevians had knowledges and skills unknown to earthly science, but were\r\nentirely ignorant of many things, to us commonplace. Therefore\r\ninterchange of students and of books was highly desirable. And so on.\r\n\r\nThus was signed the Triplanetario-Nevian Treaty of Eternal Peace. Nerado\r\nand his two companions were escorted ceremoniously to their vessel, and\r\nthe _Boise_ took off in an inertialess dash toward earth, bearing the\r\ngood news that the Nevian menace was no more.\r\n\r\nClio, now a hardened space-flea, immune even to the horrible nausea of\r\ninertialessness, wriggled lithely in the curve of Costigan's arm and\r\nlaughed up at him.\r\n\r\n\"You can talk all you want to, Conway, but I don't like them a bit. They\r\ngive me the purple jitters! I suppose that they are really estimable\r\nfolks; talented, cultured, and everything; but just the same I'll bet\r\nthat it will be a long, long time before anybody on earth will really,\r\ntruly _like_ them!\"",
