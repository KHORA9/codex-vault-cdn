Four years later Carabajal was imprisoned by the Inquisition,\r\nand the village of Santa Lucia was abandoned by its few inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn 1596, Captain Diego Montemayor, a resident of Saltillo, in the\r\nadjoining State, wishing to render a service to his king, Philip II of\r\nSpain, assembled his friends, and on September 20th of that year,\r\nproceeded to establish a town on the site of the old village on the\r\nnorthern side of the principal spring at the place. The town was named\r\n\"Nuestra Senora de Monterrey\" (Our Lady of Monterrey), after the Count\r\nof Monterrey (Ojos de Santa Lucia y Valle de Extremadura), the ruling\r\nGovernor of New Spain, as Mexico was then called.\r\n\r\nMonterrey is approximately in the center of the State of Nuevo Leon, 1 deg.\r\n12' west of Mexico City, and in latitude 26 deg. 40' N. It is a distributing\r\nrailway center on the main line of the National Railroad, 270 km. from\r\nthe Rio Grande at Laredo, 1,022 km. from Mexico, and 520 km. from\r\nTampico by the Mexican Central Railway. It is the center of many large\r\nindustries, and is the second largest manufacturing city in the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE CONCESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe works described in this paper were carried out under a guaranteed\r\nconcession granted by His Excellency, General Bernardo Reyes, Governor\r\nof the State of Nuevo Leon, to Messrs. James D. Stocker and William\r\nWalker, of Scranton, Pa. The concession is dated October 19th, 1904, and\r\nis for 99 years from that date; the works for a complete water and\r\ndrainage system were to be finished in 3 years from the time of their\r\ncommencement. Before the works were designed and begun, the concession\r\nwas acquired by Mr. William Mackenzie, of the firm of Mackenzie, Mann\r\nand Company, Limited, of Toronto, Ont., Canada, who, on May 4th, 1906,\r\norganized the Monterrey Water-Works and Sewerage Company, Limited\r\n(Compania de Servicio de Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey, S. A.), under the\r\nlaws of the Dominion of Canada, of which company he is President. Mr.\r\nMackenzie is also President of the Monterrey Railway, Light, and Power\r\nCompany, Limited, which was constructing the street railways of\r\nMonterrey concurrently with the water-works. Under the provisions of the\r\nconcession, the Government appointed a Financial Interventor, who had\r\nauthority to examine and check the company's expenditures, and also a\r\nTechnical Inspector to examine and report on the construction. The\r\nduties of these officials also apply to the operation of the system when\r\nthe construction is finished. The Government has the right, after the\r\nsystem has been operated 40 years, to purchase the entire property,\r\nsubject to 6 months' notice, for a sum equal to 16-2/3 times the average\r\nannual net proceeds during the 3 preceding years. This right may be\r\nexercised at the end of 40 years, or at the end of any 10-year period\r\nthereafter, up to 99 years from the commencement of operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GEOLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonterrey lies in a plain at the foot of the Eastern Sierra Madre\r\nMountains which constitute the eastern margin of the Mexican Cordilleran\r\nPlateau, and is surrounded by the magnificent mountains of that group,\r\namong the most notable of which are the beautiful Mitra and Silla\r\nMountains. In the neighborhood of Monterrey these mountains attain\r\nheights of from 2,000 to 2,400 m., and are noted for their broken and\r\njagged sky-lines. The leading geological characteristics of the district\r\nare the uplifted limestones of the older cretaceous age which form the\r\nmain mass of the mountains.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, the mountains are compressional folds which, in the Sierra\r\nMadre, near Monterrey, are close and vertically compressed.[2] The\r\ndrainage areas of the Santa Catarina River, which flows through\r\nMonterrey, and of the Estanzuela and Silla Rivers, its tributaries, are\r\nof limestone and shale; originally the shales were above the limestone,\r\nbut the convulsion which formed the Sierra Madre as an anticlinal fold,\r\nleft the originally horizontal strata standing nearly upright, and\r\nsubsequent erosion in the upper part of the anticline has exposed nearly\r\nvertical strata in many places. The limestone being hard and resisting\r\nerosion, there is generally, along the line of contact, an abrupt drop\r\nvertically on the face of the limestone to the shale below. In many\r\nplaces this abrupt drop is broken by a limestone talus, but the line of\r\ncontact can generally be traced. Mining operations in these mountains\r\nhave revealed the presence of large caves at a considerable elevation,\r\nmany of which contain large reservoirs of water, delivered to them\r\nthrough numerous faults. The river valleys are formed of masses of\r\nlimestone conglomerate and coarse gravels, re-cemented in many cases by\r\nthe lime deposits of the flowing waters. One of the chief\r\ncharacteristics of the subsoil of Monterrey itself is a local rock\r\ncalled \"sillar,\" which is a superficial deposit of carbonate of lime\r\nfrom the evaporated waters. In some places the \"sillar\" is largely mixed\r\nwith a conglomerate called \"tepetate,\" or \"impure sillar.\"\r\n\r\n[2] _Transactions_, Am. Inst. Min. Engrs., Vol. XXXII (1902), pp.\r\n163-178.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.--GENERAL PLAN OF THE WATER SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE\r\nWORKS FOR MONTERREY, N. L., MEXICO.]\r\n\r\nTopographically, the region around Monterrey is distinguished by the\r\ndrainage area of the River Santa Catarina, which rises in the Sierra\r\nMadre near the Laguna de Sanchez, at an elevation of 1,850 m., as shown\r\non Plate II. From this Laguna it follows a tortuous course between\r\nprecipitous mountains through the Boca of Santa Catarina to Monterrey,\r\nfor a distance of 90 km., eventually finding its way to the San Juan\r\nRiver, a tributary of the Rio Grande. Throughout its course it\r\ndisappears, flows underground, and again appears; and, except in flood\r\ntime, it has a subsurface flow for a distance of 16 km. above the city.\r\nIn the Canon of Santa Catarina it appears at the surface, having a\r\nnormal flow of about 1,415 liters (50 cu. ft.) per sec., and its waters\r\nat that point are divided into two parts and carried into irrigation\r\ncanals. The drainage area of the river above Monterrey is 1,410 sq. km.,\r\nand its bed at Monterrey is between 518 and 545 m. above sea level.\r\n\r\nSouthward from Monterrey the country rises along the valley of the Silla\r\nfor a distance of 19 km., where the Silla is separated from the San Juan\r\nby a low divide, the former flowing northward to Monterrey and the\r\nlatter southeastward toward Allende. The Silla Valley is bounded on the\r\neast and west by the steep ranges of the Silla and Sierra Madre\r\nMountains. The floor of this valley is gently rolling, but is cut by\r\nmany arroyos which carry little or no water during the greater part of\r\nthe year. The chief feeder of the Silla River is the Estanzuela, a\r\nstream which derives its waters from several springs coming to the\r\nsurface near the line of contact between the limestone and the shale, at\r\nelevations of about 800 and 900 m.[3] above datum. The water-shed of\r\nthis stream is rich with abundant vegetation due to the precipitation\r\nbeing greater than on the Santa Catarina water-shed. To the south of the\r\ndivide the country is well wooded, and El Porvenir, 35 km. from\r\nMonterrey, is the garden spot of the State of Nuevo Leon. Here the\r\nrainfall is much greater than at any other point near Monterrey, and\r\nthere are many streams which are used for irrigation purposes. Monterrey\r\nis built on a plain, chiefly on the north side of the Santa Catarina\r\nRiver. This plain has a general fall toward the northeast, and beyond\r\nthe city it slopes gently northward for several miles toward the Topo\r\nGrande River, and then southeastward to join the great coastal plain of\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico. The general elevation of the city lies between the\r\n519- and 550-m. contours. The Plaza Zaragoza, in the center of the city,\r\nis 533.90 m. above sea level; the elevation of the highest part of the\r\ncity, at the western boundary, is 550.05 m., and of the lowest part, at\r\nthe northeastern boundary, 518.0 m. above sea level.\r\n\r\n[3] Throughout this paper datum refers to the height in meters above the\r\nmean sea level of the Gulf of Mexico at the Port of Tampico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III, FIG. 1.--GENERAL VIEW OF LINE, ESTANZUELA\r\nAQUEDUCT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    POPULATION, AREA, AND MORTALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of Monterrey has increased as follows:\r\n\r\n                  Census of   1851      14,621\r\n                    \"  \"      1861      26,000\r\n                    \"  \"      1871      33,811\r\n                    \"  \"      1881      39,456\r\n                    \"  \"      1891      41,154\r\n                    \"  \"      1901      73,508\r\n                  (Estimated) 1909      86,000 to 90,000\r\n\r\nThe greatest progress, it will be noted, was between 1891-1901, with an\r\nincrease of more than 22,000 in 10 years. In designing the new works,\r\nprovision has been made for the future requirements of a city of 200,000\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThe actual area within the city limits proper is 960.5 hectares (2,374\r\nacres), forming the area to be provided with water and drainage, but the\r\nmunicipal district extends to many surrounding suburbs, and covers an\r\narea of 33,758 hectares (83,426 acres).\r\n\r\n        TABLE 1.--POPULATION AND DEATH RATE OF MONTERREY, N.

The high death\r\nrate is caused by the excessive infantile mortality, which is so\r\nprevalent throughout the whole of Mexico. The climatic condition of\r\nMonterrey, with its exceptionally healthy subsoil, ought to make it one\r\nof the healthiest of cities, if proper care were taken to enforce\r\nsanitary laws. The data regarding typhoid mortality are probably\r\nunderstated, as they were compiled by the writer, in the absence of any\r\nofficial publications, from the actual death certificates, but no\r\nspecial care is taken by the authorities to insure accuracy in such\r\ncertificates. Attention is called to the typhoid rate in May, June,\r\nJuly, and August, 1909; this high rate coincides with a scarcity of\r\nrainfall and the greatest period of drought experienced in 30 years, and\r\nimmediately precedes the great flood of August 27th. It was probably due\r\nto the lowering of the ground-water throughout the city and the\r\nconsequent contamination of the private wells, which were largely in use\r\nduring that time. Throughout the city the wells are sunk to a depth of\r\nabout 12 or 15 m., in order to reach the subterranean waters, and the\r\ncesspools are often in dangerous proximity to them and at a much higher\r\nlevel. The nature of the subsoil, which is often much fissured and open\r\nin the conglomerate and sillar strata, would make the passage of\r\ncontamination an easy matter, and this alone would account for a high\r\nmortality due to water-borne diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       RAINFALL AND TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe precipitation records of Monterrey and its neighborhood are very\r\nmeager, and cannot be relied on for a longer period than from 1894 to\r\n1909, inclusive. The records are available from 1886, but in the early\r\nyears there are many apparent discrepancies, and they are probably\r\ninaccurate. The average rainfall for the 15 years (1894-1908) is 21.94\r\nin.; the driest years for this period are as follows: 1894, 14.14 in.;\r\n1902, 15.29 in.; 1907, 15.23 in.; 1908, 15.11 in. Assuming the early\r\nrecords to be correct, the average rainfall for the period, 1886-1908,\r\nwould be 19.86 in.\r\n\r\nAt Saltillo, which is 50 miles due southwest, at an elevation of about\r\n1,520 m. above sea level, the average rainfall for the 23 years,\r\n1884-1908, inclusive, is given as 21 in. The maximum year was 1889, with\r\n33-1/2 in., and the minimum 1903, with 7-1/2 in.\r\n\r\nAt Carmen, in the State of Tamaulipas, 144 km. southwest of Monterrey,\r\nat an elevation of about 310 m. above sea level, the average fall for 12\r\nyears is 24.70 in., the maximum year being 1897, with a fall of 34.09\r\nin., and the minimum year, 1905, with 13.41 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--ANNUAL RAINFALL IN MONTERREY COVERING THE PERIOD\r\nFROM 1894 TO 1909.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows the annual variation of rainfall at Monterrey for\r\n1894-1909. Fig. 2 shows the monthly variation during the same period,\r\nand gives the minimum, average, and maximum for each month.\r\n\r\nFrom these diagrams it will be seen that the months of least rainfall\r\nare December, January, February, and March, with averages of 0.66, 0.59,\r\n0.79, and 0.93 in., respectively. The months of greatest rainfall are\r\nAugust, with an average of 4.39 in., and September with 4.87 in. The\r\nmaximum in any month prior to 1909 was 16.75 in., during September,\r\n1904.\r\n\r\n_Rainfall in 1909._--The rainfall in 1909 was unprecedented, causing the\r\ndisastrous flood in the Santa Catarina River, which will be referred to\r\nwhen describing the works. Fig. 3 shows the monthly rainfall for 1906 to\r\n1909, inclusive, and has been plotted to show the variation of rainfall\r\nprior to the great precipitation of August, 1909. In that month there\r\nwere two heavy falls, one beginning at midnight on August 9th, and\r\nduring the following 42 hours a fall of 13.28 in. was recorded by the\r\ngauge at the Water-Works Company's general offices, 10.20 in. of which\r\nfell, during the first 24 hours. From 6 P. M. to 11 P. M., on August\r\n10th, 5.019 in. were recorded, or an average of 1 in. per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--MONTHLY RAINFALL IN MONTERREY COVERING THE\r\nPERIOD FROM 1894 TO 1909 INCLUSIVE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--MONTHLY VARIATION OF RAINFALL AT MONTERREY\r\n1906-1907-1908-1909.]\r\n\r\nAfter 13 dry days, another rainstorm began, at 4 P. M., on August 25th,\r\nand continued more or less intermittently until August 29th. During this\r\n98-hour period there was an additional fall of 21.61 in., 11.27 in.\r\nfalling in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThe total precipitation during the month amounted to 36.00 in. The\r\nhighest previous record for the month of August was in 1895, with a fall\r\nof 6.61 in. Fig. 4 gives the details of the two heavy precipitations in\r\nAugust. As no automatic recording gauge was available, the maximum\r\nintensity could only be computed approximately, owing to the\r\nintermittent character of the readings taken from the ordinary rain\r\ngauge on the roof of the Water-Works Company's office in the city. From\r\nthe readings thus obtained, it was shown that the maximum intensity\r\noccurred early on the morning of the 28th, and was nearly 2 in. per\r\nhour. Above Monterrey, in the Santa Catarina water-shed, it is believed\r\nthat the precipitation was considerably greater, but no gauges were\r\naccessible during the month.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--CURVE OF RAINFALL AT MONTERREY DURING AUGUST\r\n10TH & 11TH AND FROM AUGUST 25TH TO 29TH - 1909.]\r\n\r\nThe total rainfall for 1909 amounted to 47.46 in., of which 75% fell in\r\nAugust. This is 50% greater than the previous highest annual record\r\n(31.65 in. in 1900) for Monterrey.\r\n\r\n_Temperature._--Fig. 6 gives a record of the temperature at Monterrey\r\nfrom 1901 to 1909, inclusive. These records were taken at an altitude of\r\n520 m. It will be noted that the lowest recorded temperatures are in\r\nJanuary and February. The lowest during these years was 24 deg. Fahr., in\r\nJanuary, 1905. The monthly maxima vary between 80 and 110 deg. Fahr. The\r\nmean annual temperature is 72.65 deg. Fahr. (The mean annual barometer is\r\n28.2 in.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--DIAGRAM OF TEMPERATURE VARIATION AT MONTERREY,\r\n1901-09.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the best sources from which Monterrey should be supplied\r\nwith potable water was one that had been long under discussion, and was\r\nthe subject of many investigations prior to the granting of the present\r\nconcession. Several of the original schemes called for an impounding\r\nreservoir in the Canon of Santa Catarina and it was on the assumption\r\nthat a dam would be built that a clause was inserted in the concession\r\nfor the purpose of making its construction obligatory. The general\r\ncharacter of the physical and geological conditions surrounding\r\nMonterrey has already been referred to. A thorough study of these\r\nconditions proved that no suitable site for impounding the Santa\r\nCatarina River could be found, apart from the fact that periodically\r\nthis river is subject to enormous floods which tear through the steep\r\ncanon with tremendous velocity.\r\n\r\nAt the site originally proposed for the dam, a considerable underflow\r\nwas found, and later investigations, carried out under the present\r\nconcession, proved that, although borings were carried to a depth of 54\r\nm., bed-rock could not be found, the strata being composed of gravels,\r\nconglomerate and sand. Assuming that such a dam could have been built,\r\nthe quality of the water draining from a comparatively barren\r\nwater-shed, on which many thousands of goats are pastured, would have\r\nmade its filtration an absolute necessity before it could be delivered\r\nto the consumers.\r\n\r\nThe various available sources from which water could be delivered to the\r\ncity by gravity were investigated by Mr. F. S. Hyde, in the autumn of\r\n1905, and also by J. D. Schuyler, M. Am. Soc. C. E., who was afterward\r\nretained as Consulting Engineer for the Company. The various\r\ninvestigations made from time to time showed that the question of a\r\nsatisfactory supply was one of extreme difficulty, requiring prolonged\r\nobservation and study, more particularly into the character of the\r\nunderground sources of supply.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief characteristics of many of the streams in the State of\r\nNuevo Leon, is their disappearance and reappearance at different points\r\nalong their routes, and the Santa Catarina River, under normal\r\nconditions, as already remarked, is a very notable example of a river\r\nwhich is very dry at the surface for many kilometers of its length. In\r\nthe writer's opinion, the waters of this and similar rivers in the State\r\npass through many open caverns underground, so that experience gained in\r\nthe investigation of underflow waters in other places would be\r\ninsufficient to determine the quantity passing at any point along the\r\nriver if ascertained by merely computing it from the velocity of the\r\nunderflow and the area of the water-bearing gravels. The rainfall on the\r\nwater-shed of the Santa Catarina River is probably 25% greater than at\r\nMonterrey, and all ordinary rains sink rapidly into the limestone soils\r\nand quickly disappear. In another water-shed of a very similar\r\ncharacter, namely, that of the Rio Blanco, in the southern part of the\r\nState, the underflow waters appear at the surface at a place called\r\nMezquital, where a metamorphosed sandstone barrier prevents them from\r\ndisappearing underground. At this point the normal quantity of water is\r\nabout 5,660 liters (200 cu. ft.) per sec., but it gradually disappears,\r\nand a few kilometers below it has sunk to an insignificant stream,\r\nfinally disappearing altogether for about 20 km. In the neighborhood of\r\nMonterrey similar conditions exist with regard to the surface-water\r\nsupplies, and investigations, therefore, were directed toward obtaining\r\nunpolluted supplies from springs and underground sources.\r\n\r\n_Santa Catarina Sources._--The chief points from which it was thought\r\ndesirable to obtain underflow supplies were (1) at the barrier of San\r\nGeronimo, and (2) at the Canon of Santa Catarina, both shown on Plate\r\nII.\r\n\r\nConditions at San Geronimo, which is only 6-1/2 km. west of Monterrey,\r\nwere investigated by the State Government in 1892, to determine the\r\ndepth of bed-rock, the rock on either side of the valley being shale,\r\nwith its original bedding planes standing almost vertical. To determine\r\nthis depth, borings were made by driving 2-in. tubes until it was\r\nassumed that bed-rock had been reached, a method which, in strata\r\ncontaining so many boulders, was obviously unreliable. These borings\r\nindicated that bed-rock was from 12 to 15 m. below the surface. If these\r\nhad proved to be correct, there is no doubt that a development of the\r\nunderground water at this point, by constructing a submerged dam\r\ncombined with an infiltration gallery, would have yielded a large\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1906, the Company commenced operations at San Geronimo by\r\nsinking a well a few meters north of the then dry bed of the river.\r\nWater was found in considerable quantities a few meters below the\r\nsurface, practically at the level of the river, that is, 570 m. above\r\ndatum. This supply was used for provisional purposes, and will be\r\nreferred to later in describing the San Geronimo gravity supply works.\r\n\r\nBetween August, 1906, and January, 1907, 4-in. bore-holes were sunk in\r\nthe river bed and on the high ground to the north with a \"Keystone\"\r\ndriller outfit. These borings showed bed-rock immediately under the\r\nriver bed, at a depth of from 15 to 45 m., but dipping gradually as the\r\nborings were carried northward.\r\n\r\nBoring operations were also carried on at Santa Catarina, during\r\nNovember and December, 1906, and in January, 1907, to determine the\r\ngeological conditions, and the results are shown on Fig. 7. From the\r\narea of water-bearing gravels found, it was proposed to tap the\r\nunderflow water at the 630-m. level by an infiltration gallery. This\r\nwould have necessitated a gravitation tunnel 3,000 m. long, and an\r\naqueduct of 14 km., which it was proposed to carry to one of two\r\ndistributing reservoirs at Guadalupe, on the south side of the river,\r\nopposite Monterrey. In May, 1907, the writer, after making a study of\r\nall the available data which had been accumulated, had additional\r\nborings sunk farther across the valley to the north, and these revealed\r\na considerable area of water-bearing gravels, and proved that, in former\r\ngeological times, the Santa Catarina flowed about 500 m. north of its\r\npresent position, and to the back of Obispado Mountain, instead of\r\nthrough the city. This aspect of the subject was discussed with Mr.\r\nSchuyler, who agreed with the writer that, in the interest of economy,\r\nit was better to tap this supply by an infiltration gallery at the\r\n560-m. level, and bring the water thus obtained to a reservoir to be\r\nplaced at the western limits of the city, dividing the city, for\r\ndistribution purposes, into two interchangeable systems, a high- and a\r\nlow-pressure, the high-pressure system being supplied from Estanzuela,\r\n18 km. south of the city. One advantage to be gained from this change\r\nwas that the scheme was capable of considerable extension, and any\r\nfuture developments at Santa Catarina Canon would form part of the works\r\nto be constructed for both high- and low-pressure districts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--CROSS-SECTION OF SANTA CATARINA RIVER AT SANTA\r\nCATARINA.]\r\n\r\nThe future extension of the Santa Catarina sources, the writer believes,\r\ncan be developed best by driving an infiltration gallery 10 m. below the\r\nsurface of the Santa Catarina River, a little west of the village of the\r\nsame name, and then conveying the water through a comparatively short\r\ngravitation tunnel and pressure conduit to a main reservoir near San\r\nGeronimo having a top water level at an elevation of about 590 m. above\r\ndatum.\r\n\r\n_Southern Sources of Supply._--The available sources of supply southward\r\nfrom Monterrey include a number of springs at various points in a\r\ndistance of 40 km. Many of these springs are of uncertain quantity, and\r\nsome are quite dry during periods of drought. The chief perennial\r\nsprings near Monterrey are those which contribute to form the Estanzuela\r\nand Diente Rivers, both tributaries of the Silla, while farther south,\r\nat the Potrero Cerna, near El Porvenir, there are excellent springs, at\r\na considerable elevation, with a minimum flow of from 170 to 200 liters\r\n(from 6 to 7 cu. ft.) per sec. The total quantity of water available\r\nfrom all these springs during the driest season would probably not be\r\nless than about 560 or 700 liters (from 20 to 25 cu. ft.) per sec.\r\n\r\nThe Estanzuela springs issue at the foot of the Sierra Madre Mountains,\r\nand have a normal flow of from 56 to 85 liters (2 to 3 cu. ft.) per sec.\r\nin an ordinary dry year; they probably derive their water, through the\r\nlimestone formation, from the neighboring water-shed of Santa Catarina,\r\nas the catchment area of the stream is only 910 hectares, and the stream\r\nhas never been known to fail, even in the driest periods of prolonged\r\ndrought. The rainfall on the area is about 30 in. per annum, and the\r\ncatchment area is well wooded and covered with abundant vegetation. The\r\nEl Diente springs have an ordinary dry-weather flow of about 28-1/2\r\nliters (1 cu. ft.) per sec.; but part of the water is carried\r\nunderground, and the real quantity is much greater and could be\r\ndeveloped by a small submerged dam carried down to bed-rock.\r\n\r\nThe elevation and the extreme purity of the water of the Estanzuela\r\nRiver made its acquisition very desirable, and the Company, therefore,\r\npurchased the Federal water rights owned by various members of the\r\nEstanzuela community, amounting to 91 liters per sec., and has since\r\nacquired a Federal concession to all the flood-waters of that river. It\r\nwas decided, therefore, to adopt the Estanzuela River as the first step\r\ntoward developing the water to the south of Monterrey for a\r\nhigh-pressure supply, the advantage of the scheme being that from time\r\nto time extensions could be made to tap other sources by gravity, as the\r\ndemands of the city required. The Estanzuela scheme, therefore, is a\r\npreliminary step toward future extensions which will be necessary in\r\nthis direction as the city grows. The springs near El Porvenir, and\r\nothers which contribute to the San Juan River, can be tapped at a\r\nsufficiently high level to convey them by a gravity pressure line to the\r\nEstanzuela Aqueduct near Mederos.\r\n\r\nThe two sources definitely decided on in July, 1907, were those from\r\nEstanzuela and San Geronimo. The works were designed to supply\r\n40,000,000 liters daily, which it was assumed would be sufficient for\r\nall future developments for a population of 200,000 at a per capita\r\nconsumption of 200 liters per day. The present requirements of the\r\ncity's population, assuming that all the water was supplied by the\r\nCompany, would be, at that rate, which is a very liberal one, only\r\n18,000,000 liters daily. This, it was thought, would be easily met by\r\nthe San Geronimo source alone, as it was estimated that it would provide\r\nnot less than 20,000,000 liters, if the infiltration gallery was driven\r\nfar enough into the water-bearing gravels.\r\n\r\nThe question of a high-pressure water supply for domestic use in a city\r\nlike Monterrey is not a serious one, as practically nine-tenths of the\r\nhouses are of one story. The increase in the number of large commercial\r\nbuildings, however, will make the demand greater in the future, and this\r\npoint has been kept in mind in arranging the division of the\r\ndistribution systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MATERIALS FOR CONCRETE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cement._--In the early stages of construction the cement for the work\r\nwas obtained from the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers, Limited,\r\nof London, which supplied the \"Pyramid\" brand, from the Knight, Bevan,\r\nand Sturges Works, but later the supply was obtained from a new factory\r\nat Hidalgo, near Monterrey. The total quantity of Portland cement used\r\nwas 42,500 bbl. of \"Pyramid\" and 32,500 bbl. of \"Hidalgo.\" The English\r\ncement was tested for the Water-Works Company in London before shipment\r\nand again at Monterrey, to conform to the British Standard\r\nSpecifications; the \"Hidalgo\" cement was required to pass the Standard\r\nSpecifications advocated by the Special Committee of the American\r\nSociety of Civil Engineers. The quality in each case was of the very\r\nhighest, no difficulties being experienced at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sand and Rock._--One of the chief difficulties in connection with the\r\nconstruction work in its initial stages was in procuring satisfactory\r\nsand for the concrete. An investigation of the quality of all the\r\navailable sands in the neighborhood of Monterrey resulted in the\r\ndecision to use a manufactured sand obtained from the calcareous shales\r\nin the foot-hills opposite the city, on the south side, and near the\r\nsite of one of the proposed reservoirs. A quarry was opened, and the raw\r\nmaterial was delivered by a gravity plane to a crushing plant, 230 m.\r\nfrom the quarry and at a level about 50 m. lower.\r\n\r\nThe plant consisted of a No. 5 Austin gyratory rock-crusher, fitted with\r\nelevators and revolving screens of various dimensions, driven by a\r\n150-h.p. Erie steam engine; two sets of Traylor's heavy-duty crushing\r\nrolls, one having 30 by 16-in. and the other 18 by 12-in. rolls; and a\r\nNiagara sand disintegrator. This plant, except during a short period\r\nwhen the requirements were beyond its capacity, was able to produce all\r\nthe sand and rock required for construction purposes. More than 40,000\r\ntons of rock were quarried, the greater part of which was converted into\r\ncrushed stone and sand.\r\n\r\nTable 2 gives the chemical analysis of the chief constituents of the\r\nvarious sands examined.\r\n\r\n   TABLE 2.--ANALYSIS OF SANDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MONTERREY.\r\n\r\n              KEY:\r\n\r\n              A: Percentage of silica (absolute), SiO_{2}\r\n              B: Percentage of alumina, Al_{2}O_{3}\r\n              C: Percentage of sesquioxide, Fe_{2}O_{3}\r\n              D: Percentage of lime carbonate, CaCO_{3}\r\n\r\n  ===+============================+=======+=======+=======+=======+\r\n  No.| Location.                  |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |\r\n  ---+----------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n   1.| Arroyo Seco, near          |       |       |       |       |\r\n     |   brickyard at Monterrey   | 60.10 |17.95  |  2.89 |  8.01 |\r\n   2.| Arroyo Seco, near          |       |       |       |       |\r\n     |   brickyard at Monterrey,  |       |       |       |       |\r\n     |   No. 2                    | 42.92 |14.26  |  4.66 | 34.58 |\r\n   3.| Near Garcia Station,       |       |       |       |       |\r\n     |   Mexican National R.

As these sands contain large proportions of lime carbonates,\r\nwhich make them very undesirable for important structures, their use was\r\nlimited to relatively unimportant work. The best sands procurable were\r\nNos. 5 and 9, but the long distance of the pits from Monterrey, and\r\nconsequently the heavy freight rate, made their use prohibitive on\r\neconomical grounds. The best of the available sands, although it was\r\nvery fine, was No. 7, from Hornos, near Torreon, as it could be depended\r\non for uniformity and could be obtained f. o. b. cars at Monterrey for\r\n3.18[5] pesos per ton.\r\n\r\n[5] All costs given in this paper are in Mexican pesos, one peso being\r\nequivalent to 50 cents in U. S. currency.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the sand and crushed rock used was similar to Nos. 12 and\r\n13, and reference to the cement sand tests in Table 3, will show that\r\nthe manufactured sands gave very satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nTable 3 gives the average tests made with the \"Hidalgo\" cement and\r\nvarious sands, alone and in combination, for the purpose of obtaining\r\ncomparative results; the mixtures tested were composed of 3 parts of\r\nsand to 1 of cement.\r\n\r\n        TABLE 3.--TESTS OF \"HIDALGO\" CEMENT WITH VARIOUS SANDS.\r\n\r\n      =====================================+============+============\r\n                     Sand.                 | At 7 days. | At 28 days.\r\n      -------------------------------------+------------+------------\r\n      Ottawa (Standard)                    |  305 lb.   |  414 lb.\r\n      Monterrey, 1-1/2 parts, }            |            |\r\n      Hornos, 1-1/2 parts     }            |  188  \"    |  313  \"\r\n      Monterrey                            |  253  \"    |  365  \"\r\n      Hornos                               |  202  \"    |  301  \"\r\n      Manufactured sand, Company's crusher |  372  \"    |  566  \"\r\n      Hornos, 2 parts,     }               |            |\r\n      Crusher sand, 1 part }               |  231  \"    |  352  \"\r\n      Hornos, 1-1/2 parts,      }          |            |\r\n      Crusher sand, 1-1/2 parts }          |  265  \"    |  346  \"\r\n      Hornos, 1 part,        }             |            |\r\n      Crusher sand, 2 parts  }             |  248  \"    |  328  \"\r\n      =====================================+============+============\r\n\r\nThe Hornos sand was used during a few weeks in the latter part of 1908,\r\nwhen the crusher was unable to produce all that was required. Its use\r\nwas restricted to thick walls which were required to be water-tight, and\r\nit was always used in equal proportions with the crusher dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ESTANZUELA SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--LOCATION PLAN OF ESTANZUELA DAM.]\r\n\r\n_Intake Works._--The intake (Fig. 8) is about 1 km. below the lowest\r\nspring and at a point where the maximum flow of the stream was observed.\r\nThe works consist of a small monolithic concrete dam, placed obliquely\r\nacross the stream at an angle selected for the purpose of obtaining a\r\nfoundation running parallel to the direction of the strata, which at\r\nthis point were lying almost vertically across the bed of the stream.\r\nAbove these strata the stream bed was formed chiefly of large cemented\r\nlimestone blocks and smaller conglomerate. No storage being possible in\r\nthis valley, which has a very precipitous fall, the height of the dam\r\nwas fixed merely to obtain a small settling basin for sand and debris\r\nbrought down in time of flood. The dam foundation was excavated to\r\nbed-rock, from which the upper disintegrated portions were carefully\r\nremoved; the rock was then stepped, and dovetailed recesses were left\r\nfor properly bonding the concrete.\r\n\r\nThe dam is carried well into the banks. Its extreme length is 52 m., its\r\nmaximum height 4.50 m., and its greatest thickness 2 m. The up-stream\r\nface has a batter of 1 in 12, and the down-stream face, 1 in 8. The top\r\nof the wall is 1 m. thick. For the discharge of flood-water there is a\r\nweir 10 m. long, and it was calculated that with a depth of 1 m. it\r\nwould discharge about 400 times the ordinary flow, or about 23,000\r\nliters per sec., but, in addition, the whole length of the dam\r\n(excluding that occupied by the gate-house) was arranged for the\r\ndischarge of abnormal floods, one of which, on August 27th, reached the\r\nenormous quantity of 82,070 liters (2,900 cu. ft.) per sec., or 825 cu.\r\nft. per sec. per sq. mile of drainage area, a remarkable run-off from so\r\nsmall an area as 910 hectares. The concrete forming the dam is a 1:3:5\r\nmixture. The overflow sill is 692 m. above sea level. When the dam was\r\ncompleted it was filled to the overflow level, in order to test the\r\nwater-tightness of the basin, which, when cleared, was found to be\r\nslightly fissured on the north side. The leakage was sufficient to cause\r\na serious loss during periods of drought, and it was then decided to\r\nline the basin with concrete, so that the stream would enter it without\r\nbeing under a head greater than its own depth. The length of the basin,\r\nmeasured along the center line of the original stream surface, is 85 m.,\r\nand its area is 1,100 sq. m. At its upper end it is merely a lined\r\nchannel, 5 m. wide at the entrance. The floor of the basin has a fall of\r\n4 m. The lining was formed in two thicknesses totaling 30.5 cm. (12\r\nin.) of 1:2-1/2:3-1/2 concrete, laid in panels approximately 3 m.\r\nsquare, the upper panels breaking joint with those immediately below; in\r\nthis way a very satisfactory and water-tight lining was obtained. A\r\nparapet wall, 45.7 cm. high, surrounds the basin. For scouring out the\r\nbasin a 30.5-cm. (12-in.) cast-iron pipe was taken through the dam at\r\nthe lowest point, this pipe being provided with a gate-valve encased in\r\nconcrete on the down-stream face.\r\n\r\nThe gate-house was built in connection with the dam at the north end of\r\nthe overflow weir, its inner dimensions being 4.34 by 2.80 m. The\r\nsubstructure, to the level of the dam, is of concrete founded on the\r\nsolid rock, and the superstructure is of brick rendered with cement\r\nplaster. The roof is of framed timber with red French tiles.\r\n\r\nThe intake pipe is of cast iron. 40.6 cm. (16 in.) in internal diameter,\r\nfitted outside with a movable copper screen which is further protected\r\nby a wrought-iron hinged screen to prevent damage from stones, floating\r\ntimber, etc., during times of flood. Inside the gate-house the outlet\r\npipe is provided with a 40.6-cm. (16-in.) sluice-valve, operated from\r\nthe floor level by a vertical head-stock with worm-gearing. The\r\ngate-house has a scour-out pipe (also operated by a head-stock) and\r\nduplicate copper screens fitted to iron frames. From this house the\r\nwater is conveyed to the upper portion of the conduit, which is a\r\n45.7-cm. (18-in.) cast-iron pipe.\r\n\r\nOf the total area of land, 885 hectares (2,187 acres), owned by the\r\ncompany, 392 hectares (970 acres) have been fenced in, to prevent any\r\ncontamination of the springs. This fence is formed of five lines of\r\nbarbed wire protected with stout hog netting at the bottom, in order to\r\nprevent more particularly the entrance of goats, many thousands of which\r\npasture in the adjoining mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the high ground immediately below the intake, a 3-roomed stone house\r\nhas been constructed for the inspector in charge of the intake works,\r\nwho also keeps in daily touch with the general office and records the\r\ncondition of the stream, particulars of rainfall, etc.\r\n\r\n_Aqueduct._--The total length of the aqueduct, from the intake dam to\r\nthe South Reservoir, is 18,700 m., made up as shown in Table 4.\r\n\r\n                      TABLE 4.--ESTANZUELA AQUEDUCT.\r\n\r\n  +===========================================================+==========+\r\n  |              Description.                                 |Length,   |\r\n  |                                                           |in meters |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------+----------+\r\n  |                                                           |          |\r\n  |Cast-iron pipes, 45.7 cm.

The calculated\r\ndischarging capacity of the conduit when running full is 364 liters (13\r\ncu. ft.) per sec. for the upper, and 465 liters (16.4 cu. ft.) per sec.\r\nfor the lower section. For these pipes, the coefficient, _n_, in\r\nKutter's formula, was taken at 0.013. At present the line has been\r\nlimited by overflows to discharge three-quarters full.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the size of the pipes from Mederos is for the purpose of\r\nreceiving the waters of the Mederos River and other springs in the San\r\nPablo and Aqua Verde catchment areas, as shown on Plate II.\r\n\r\nThe invert of the concrete conduit where it leaves the Estanzuela River\r\nis 684.25 m. above datum, and at the valve-house of the South Reservoir\r\nit is 589.00 m.\r\n\r\nThe concrete pipes were manufactured and laid under contract with Mr.\r\nArthur S. Bent, of Los Angeles, Cal., the Company providing all\r\nmaterials, labor, etc. The contractor was paid 10 cents per lin. ft. of\r\npipe manufactured and 10 cents per lin. ft. laid. He was also\r\nresponsible for the satisfactory completion of the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--ESTANZUELA PIPE LINE STEEL FORMS FOR THE\r\nMANUFACTURE OF CONCRETE PIPE.]\r\n\r\nFig. 9 shows the details of the joint recommended by Mr. Schuyler and\r\nadopted for these pipes. The 63.5-cm. (25-in.) pipes were 61 cm. long\r\nand 76 mm. (3 in.) thick. The 55.9-cm. (22-in.) pipes were of the same\r\nlength, but 70 mm. (2-3/4 in.) thick. For the purpose of strengthening\r\nthese pipes while hauling them over very rough roads they were\r\nreinforced with four rings of No. 6 galvanized-iron wire.\r\n\r\n_Manufacture of Pipes._--The pipes were manufactured under the\r\nSupervision of Mr. H. Stanley Bent, at a pipe yard established below\r\nthe crushing plant, from which the crushed rock and sand were delivered\r\nby gravity in bogies run on narrow-gauge rails. The area of the pipe\r\nyard was approximately 1-1/4 hectares, and it was laid out with parallel\r\nlines of 76-mm. (3-in.) galvanized-iron piping with hose couplings for\r\nsprinkling purposes. After trials with aggregates of various sizes, the\r\nconcrete for the pipes was proportioned by volume as follows:\r\n\r\n  Crushed rock broken to pass through a 19-mm. screen   0.136 cu. m.\r\n  Manufactured sand (run of rolls)                      0.119  \"  \"\r\n  Portland cement                                       0.090  \"  \"\r\n                                                        ------------\r\n  Total                                                 0.345 cu. m.=\r\n                                                       (12.2 cu. ft.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III, FIG. 2.--STEEL FORMS FOR MOULDING CONCRETE\r\nTUBES, ESTANZUELA AQUEDUCT.]\r\n\r\nThe above quantity manufactured two 63.5-cm. pipes; a 55.9-cm. pipe\r\nrequired 0.1415 cu. m. (5 cu. ft.) of the material, in the same\r\nproportions. Fig. 9 shows the forms for these pipes, and Fig. 2, Plate\r\nIII, illustrates the process of moulding. The forms consist of cast-iron\r\nbottom rings, to the proper section of the joint, and inner and outer\r\nsteel forms of 3-mm. plate, provided with inner and outer locking\r\narrangements. The concrete was poured through a cast-iron hopper which\r\nfitted to the top of the outer form.\r\n\r\nThe concrete, which was mixed very dry, in a 1/2-cu. yd. batch, \"Smith\"\r\nmixer, was thoroughly tamped with a 22-lb. tamper, and worked until it\r\nwas of a stiff jelly-like consistency, the wire rings being added as the\r\nconcrete was placed. The best results were obtained with the minimum\r\nquantity of water. The upper joint was moulded with a heavy cast-iron\r\nring. The jacket and core forms were loosened immediately, and placed\r\nover other rings, a sufficient number of bottom rings being used for a\r\nday's work. For the pipes required for curves, special forms were used\r\nto give the necessary bevel to the joint. After 24 hours the finished\r\npipes were lifted from the bottom ring with a special lifter, and ranged\r\nin position for coating internally with a Portland cement grout to which\r\na little freshly slaked lime was added. The pipes were all numbered, and\r\nwere kept moist for 10 days by constant sprinkling. They were not hauled\r\nto the work until 28 days after they were moulded, although this rule\r\nwas sometimes broken, to the detriment of the pipes. More than 32,000\r\npipes were manufactured, but some were used for purposes other than the\r\nEstanzuela Aqueduct.\r\n\r\n_Cost of Pipes._--The contractor brought with him experienced concrete\r\npipe makers from California, and these were afterward assisted by\r\nMexican labor. In a day two tampers could manufacture from 45 to 50\r\npipes of the larger (63.5-cm,), and from 55 to 60 of the smaller\r\n(55.9-cm.) size.\r\n\r\nThe cost varied from 2.75 to 3.25 pesos per pipe for the smaller, and\r\nfrom 3.50 to 4.00 pesos for the larger size.\r\n\r\nThe approximate cost of manufacturing is as follows: Taking, as a fair\r\nexample, one week's work during March, 1908, the wages paid to the 74\r\nmen comprising the total pay-roll (though part of this labor was\r\nintermittent) amounted to 981 pesos. This includes a general foreman at\r\n10 pesos per day, four American tampers at 7.50 pesos, and Mexican labor\r\nvarying from 4 to 1 peso, and all labor necessary to handle and finish\r\nthe pipes, including coating the interiors. During this week there were\r\nmade 1,126 of the 63.5-cm. and 1,095 of the 55.9-cm. size. The pay-roll\r\nincludes 520 pesos for the larger pipes (46 cents each) and 461 pesos\r\nfor the smaller pipe (42 cents each). Table 5 shows the quantities and\r\ncost of the materials used in the manufacture of these pipes.\r\n\r\n                    TABLE 5.--COST OF CONCRETE PIPE.\r\n\r\n  ========================================+===============================\r\n                                          | FOR 1,126 PIPES 63.5 CM.\r\n                                          | IN DIAMETER.\r\n            Materials.                    +-------------+-----------------\r\n                                          | Quantities. |  Cost.\r\n  ----------------------------------------+-------------+-----------------\r\n  Portland cement, at 8.00 pesos per      |             |\r\n    bbl., delivered at pipe-making yard.  |   401 bbl.  | 3,208.00 pesos.\r\n  Sand, at 2.65 pesos per cu. m.          |    85 cu. m.|   225.25  \"\r\n  Crushed rock, 19-mm.

(1.91 pesos per lin. ft.).\r\n\r\nThe cost of the 55.9-cm. pipes amounted to 2.66 pesos for material plus\r\n0.42 peso for labor = 3.08 pesos per pipe, or 5.05 pesos per lin. m.\r\n(1.54 pesos per lin. ft.).\r\n\r\nThe cost of cement included hauling from the bodega to the yard, a\r\ndistance of about 5 km. At a later date, after the Company had commenced\r\nusing the \"Hidalgo\" cement, some additional 55.9-cm. pipes were\r\nmanufactured, so as to have them on hand as a reserve in case of\r\nemergency. In this work only Mexican labor was used, as the previous\r\ngang had been dispersed, but the tampers had previous experience. Taking\r\nthe cost of 418 pipes made during one period of 9 days, the detailed\r\ncost was as given in Table 6.\r\n\r\n                  TABLE 6.--COST OF 55.9-CM.

Scott\r\nand Lee, of Monterrey, under three classifications:\r\n\r\n      (1) \"All material which in the judgment of the Engineer can\r\n      be economically loosened with picks and handled with\r\n      shovels.\"\r\n\r\n      (2) \"Indurated earth or gravel, shale or rock which can be\r\n      loosened without blasting, and 'sillar', locally so-called,\r\n      whether pure or mixed with other substances, and whether it\r\n      requires blasting or not.\"\r\n\r\n      (3) \"All rock not included in the above which requires\r\n      drilling or blasting.\"\r\n\r\nLocally, this classification is well understood, particularly No. 2, as\r\nit covers the sillar soils which are common in the neighborhood of\r\nMonterrey. The contract prices were: No. 1, 50 cents; No. 2, 1.50\r\npesos; and No. 3, 2.50 pesos per cu. m. These prices were over and above\r\nthe clearing and grubbing of the line, which was paid for at the rate of\r\n100 pesos per hectare.\r\n\r\nThe route of the pipe line being along broken country, at some points\r\ndifficult of access, service roadways, about 3 m. wide, for hauling\r\nmaterial were constructed, and, for about 7 km., a roadway was made\r\nalong the line of the trench.\r\n\r\nThe prices for the roadway, under the above classification, were: For\r\nNo. 1, 35 cents; No. 2, 1.50 pesos; and No. 3, 2.50 pesos per cu. m.\r\n\r\nThe trenches were excavated 5 cm. below the required finishing depth, to\r\nallow for grading the pipes in selected material, and were taken out to\r\nan average width of 40 cm. greater than the outside diameter of the\r\npipe, to allow for their proper jointing, and also to give sufficient\r\nroom to roll the pipes in the trenches.\r\n\r\nThe final quantities of excavation were:\r\n\r\n          TRENCH:   No. 1             11,115 cu. m.\r\n                    No. 2             18,096  \"  \"\r\n                    No. 3              6,650  \"  \"\r\n                                    --------------\r\n                    Total             35,861 cu. m.\r\n\r\n          ROADWAYS: No. 1             4,165 cu. m.\r\n                    No. 2             1,999  \" \"\r\n                    No. 3                30  \" \"\r\n                                     -------------\r\n                    Total             6,194 cu. m.\r\n\r\nThe route of the pipe line was laid out so as to obtain an average fill\r\nof not more than 1 m. over the tops of the pipes, but in some cases the\r\ncuts, for short lengths, were 3 m. deep. The excavation for this work\r\nbegan in June, 1907.\r\n\r\n_Hauling Pipes._--The pipes were hauled to the site of the work with\r\nox-carts and mule teams. The cost of hauling varied from 25 cents per\r\npipe at the lower end, to 1 peso per pipe at the upper and,\r\ncomparatively speaking, inaccessible portion of the line. The weight of\r\neach 55.9-cm. pipe was about 182 kg.; that of each 63.5-cm. pipe was\r\nabout 216 kg.\r\n\r\nThe breakages in all the pipes cast at the pipe yard amounted to about\r\n1%, due chiefly to unloading them carelessly near the pipe line.\r\n\r\n_Pipe Laying._--The pipe-laying gang was composed of 7 Mexicans under\r\nthe direction of an American foreman, who was in charge of several\r\ngangs. One gang could lay daily from 60 to 73 m. (from 100 to 120\r\npipes). The following was the ordinary pay-roll for one gang:\r\n\r\n       1 Foreman at 8 pesos (proportion).         2.00 pesos.\r\n       1 Pipe layer at 3 pesos.                   3.00  \"\r\n       1 Pipe layer's assistant at 2 pesos.       2.00  \"\r\n       1 Cement mixer at 2 pesos.                 2.00  \"\r\n       2 Outside plasterers at 2.50 pesos.        5.00  \"\r\n       2 Inside plasterers at 2.25 pesos.         4.50  \"\r\n       1 Water boy at 0.50 peso.                  0.50  \"\r\n                                                  -----------\r\n       Total.                                    20.00 pesos.\r\n\r\nThis brings the average cost of laying the pipes to 32.8 cents per lin.\r\nm.\r\n\r\nThe pipes were jointed with 1:2 cement mortar, the outer joint being\r\nrounded over both pipes for a width of 12-1/2 cm. (5 in.) and a height\r\nof about 19 mm. (3/4 in.). In making these joints the pipe layers wore\r\nrubber gloves. The joints were kept moist, and the trench was\r\nback-filled with fine, screened material to a depth of 10 cm. above the\r\ntop of the pipe. Inside, the joints were carefully caulked with cement\r\nand rendered smooth, the plasterers working continuously along with the\r\npipe layers, doing from 20 to 35 m. at a time. Water had to be conveyed\r\nto the trenches by barrels on burros, and during the dry season it was\r\nsometimes carried 5 or 6 km.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV, FIG. 1.--TYPICAL REINFORCED CONCRETE GIRDER\r\nBRIDGE, ESTANZUELA AQUEDUCT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV, FIG. 2.--ELLIPTICAL ARCH BRIDGE CARRYING\r\nESTANZUELA AQUEDUCT.]\r\n\r\n_Bridges._--The line as laid out passed over many gulches and dry\r\narroyos, and these were crossed with reinforced concrete bridges of\r\nvarying spans and heights, two being shown on Plate IV.\r\n\r\nThese bridges were formed of continuous horizontal girders, 1.10 m. deep\r\nand 1 m. wide, with a cantilever overhang at the abutments, varying in\r\nlength from 1 to 2 m., so as to avoid settlement between the pipes and\r\nthe bridges. The bottom reinforcement consisted of from 2 to 6 twisted\r\nbars of mild steel, varying in different spans from 12.7 to 19 mm. (1/2\r\nto 3/4 in.) in diameter. The turned up bars were 28-1/2 mm. (1-1/8 in.)\r\nin diameter; they were placed on either side, carried over the upper\r\npart of the beams, and continued along the end for the overhanging part\r\nof the girder. These bars, when not obtainable of the full length, were\r\nspliced with a lap of 1.2 m. with No. 6 galvanized-steel wire. The\r\nvertical stirrups were 4.7 by 25.4 mm. (3/16 by 1 in.), of mild steel;\r\nthey were equally spaced 30.5 cm. (12 in.) apart, and carried all around\r\nthe girders, lapping at the center about 15 cm. (6 in.), all the steel\r\nbeing carefully wired together before placing the concrete.\r\n\r\nThe general type of the piers and abutments is shown by Fig. 1, Plate\r\nIV, and varies in height with practically every bridge, the foundations\r\nin every case resting on hard rock. The concrete for the girders was a\r\n1:2-1/2:3-1/2 mixture, the crushed stone used having all passed a mesh\r\nof 19 mm. (3/4 in.). The piers were of 1:3-1/2:5-1/2 concrete, and heavy\r\n\"displacers\" were embedded within them.\r\n\r\nThe concrete was placed after the pipes had been laid through the form\r\nby the pipe contractor, the joints being kept clear of the bottom to the\r\nrequired distance by small moulded concrete blocks. The tops of the\r\ngirders were moulded to a slightly segmental form. The bridges were all\r\nkept watered for about 15 days, and the forms were not struck for 28\r\ndays after placing. At Station 13.4 the pipes were carried over a\r\npicturesque arroyo on an elliptical arched bridge (Fig. 2, Plate IV) of\r\n11 m. clear span.\r\n\r\nThe abutments of all bridges were protected by rubble walls in cement\r\nmortar carried up 60 cm. above the tops of the girders.\r\n\r\nThe contract price for the concrete work of these bridges, the Company\r\nfurnishing the steel and cement, was 14 pesos per cu. m., and for\r\nplacing reinforcing steel 35 pesos per metric ton (2,204 lb.).\r\n\r\nThere are 49 single-span bridges, the larger spans being 9.10 m.; 8\r\ntwo-span, and 11 three-span bridges, their total length, including the\r\noverhang, amounting to 870.50 m., or 4-1/2% of the whole length of\r\naqueduct.\r\n\r\n_Concrete Aprons._--At 76 points there were small depressions which did\r\nnot necessitate the construction of bridges, and at these places the\r\npipes were encased in blocks of concrete carried up the hillside in the\r\nform of an apron having small abutment walls from 1 to 2 m. apart. This\r\nalso served to protect the pipes from scouring action during rainstorms.\r\nAt the upper end of the line, near the intake, the pipe had to be\r\nprotected by concrete continuously for a distance of about 300 m., in\r\norder to prevent damage from falling rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V, FIG. 1.--VENTILATING COLUMN AND ENTRANCE\r\nMANHOLE, ESTANZUELA AQUEDUCT.]\r\n\r\n_Ventilators and Manholes._--Along the route of the concrete pipe there\r\nare 27 ventilators, one of which, together with an entrance manhole, is\r\nshown by Fig. 1, Plate V. They consisted of simple concrete columns,\r\n3.35 m. high, above the ground line, the interior of the shafts being\r\nformed of fire-clay pipes, 15 cm. (6 in.) in diameter. At each\r\nventilator the pipe was cut and a block of concrete, the width of the\r\ntrench, filled in as a foundation. Entrance manholes were also placed at\r\n49 points, at 27 of which they immediately adjoined the ventilating\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\n_Estanzuela Tunnel._--At 1,560 m. from the intake at Estanzuela, the\r\nconduit is laid through a tunnel 281 m. long. The tunnel was driven\r\nthrough hard calcareous strata from the open cuttings at each end. The\r\ninner dimensions were trimmed to approximately 2 m. high and 1-1/2 m.\r\nwide. At the ends of the tunnel the rock was moderately easy to take\r\nout, but the inner section was very hard and difficult to blast.\r\nOrdinary hand drilling was adopted, and the actual cost of driving\r\nvaried from 28 pesos per lin. m. at the ends to 50 pesos in the center.\r\n\r\nThe pipes were laid through the tunnel in the ordinary way, and\r\nback-filled from the center, so as to give a cover of about 45 cm. above\r\nto protect them from falling pieces of shale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V, FIG. 2.--PLACING CONCRETE PIPES IN FORMS FOR\r\nBRIDGE CROSSING AT NORTH END OF TUNNEL, ESTANZUELA AQUEDUCT.]\r\n\r\n_Siphons._--It has already been mentioned that there are 6 cast-iron\r\npipe siphons. The head on these varies between 10 and 38 m. All are\r\nprovided with special inlets and outlets, forming combined overflow and\r\nventilating chambers, and have wooden hand-sluices to divert the water\r\nwhen necessary. The bottoms of all siphons are provided with 20-cm.\r\ncast-iron scour-out pipes, fitted with valves, and carried down to a\r\nlower point to obtain a free outlet. The valve-boxes are protected by\r\nbeing placed in heavy concrete chambers carried up above the level of\r\nordinary floods.\r\n\r\nThe siphons are formed of cast-iron socket pipes, 3.65 m. (12 ft.) long,\r\ncaulked in the ordinary way with lead joints. The thickness of the\r\n45.7-cm. (18-in.) pipes is 19 mm.; that of the 50.8-cm. pipes is 21 mm.\r\nOn the steep hillsides the pipes are anchored securely to the rock in\r\nconcrete blocks reinforced with heavy iron chains. In some cases these\r\nsiphons were difficult of access, but ox-teams hauled the pipes in a\r\nvery efficient and satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n_Overflow Chambers._--The ordinary overflows, of which there are 14, are\r\nsimilar in design to the siphon inlets.\r\n\r\n_Testing, etc._--When the line was completed it was tested for\r\nwater-tightness, and the loss was found to be about 5%, part of which\r\nwas probably due to absorption. At a later date it was found that the\r\nwaters of the Estanzuela River, which contain 150 parts of calcium\r\ncarbonate (CaCO_{3}) per million, deposited a very fine film of lime on the\r\ninterior of the pipes, completely filling any pores there might have\r\nbeen. At the present time there is no measurable leakage, thus proving\r\nthat the character of the work is very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe water was turned into the conduit on June 11th, 1908, and delivered\r\nto the city on the following day through a by-pass, before the reservoir\r\nwas completed.\r\n\r\nThe pipe line is patrolled daily by an inspector with the authority of a\r\ngendarme, so as to prevent the unlawful abstraction of water, a very\r\nnecessary precaution in so dry a country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SOUTH DISTRIBUTING RESERVOIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distributing reservoir for the Estanzuela supply is at Guadalupe, on\r\nthe foot-hills to the south of the Santa Catarina River, about 2 km.\r\nfrom the center of the city. The reservoir is a covered one, of\r\nreinforced concrete, and its capacity is 38,000,000 liters (10,000,000\r\nU. S. gal.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII, FIG. 1.--GENERAL VIEW OF EXCAVATION AND\r\nEMBANKMENT FOR SOUTH RESERVOIR BEFORE LINING.]\r\n\r\n_Excavation and Embankment._--The heavy slope of the ground at the\r\nselected site made the circular form the most desirable. On the low side\r\nthe ground was excavated about 2 m. below the original ground line,\r\nwhile the excavation at the upper part of the slope was about 12 m.\r\ndeep. The excavated material consisted chiefly of sillar and limestone\r\nconglomerate, which when broken up forms a calcareous clay of an\r\nexcellent character for the formation of embankments, when proper care\r\nis taken. The dimensions fixed for the internal diameter of the finished\r\nconcrete work of the reservoir were: 81 m. (265.68 ft.) at the top, and\r\na depth of water of 9 m., with sides sloping 55 in 100.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--SOUTH RESERVOIR PLAN OF EXCAVATION.]\r\n\r\nFig. 10 is a plan of the reservoir, with a cross-section of the\r\nexcavation and embankment. On the lower side the original ground line\r\nwas cut down in steps, and all loose earth, roots, etc., were carefully\r\nremoved. The floor of the reservoir was chiefly sillar conglomerate, a\r\nhard material that required a considerable amount of blasting for its\r\nremoval. The embankments were formed in 10-cm. layers of sillar and\r\nconglomerate broken into small fragments and then rolled with 3-ton\r\nsectional rollers drawn by teams of 4 and 6 mules, which assisted in\r\ndisintegrating the mass thoroughly, and produced by constant wetting a\r\nhomogeneous and compact clay. The excavation and embankment were left so\r\nthat 15 cm. of trimming could be done at a later date, immediately prior\r\nto the lining of the reservoir. The excavated material amounted to about\r\n34,000 cu. m., and, of this quantity, 31,500 cu. m. were used to form\r\nthe embankment; the remainder was taken to a spoil bank immediately\r\nadjoining, the black earth stripping being separated and reserved for\r\ncovering the reservoir, etc. The contract prices for the excavated\r\nmaterial placed in the embankment were:\r\n\r\n                                                                     Pesos\r\n                                                                     per\r\n                                                                     cubic\r\n                                                                     meter\r\n\r\n  Class 1.--Material which could be removed by plows and scrapers    0.60\r\n  Class 2.--This consisted chiefly of \"sillar\"                       1.09\r\n  Class 3.--Limestone conglomerate (requiring blasting)              1.65\r\n\r\nThe prices (for the same classification) for material taken to the spoil\r\nbank, were 0.40, 0.80, and 1.40 pesos, respectively. Of the material\r\ntaken out, 15% came under No. 1 classification, 80% under No. 2, and 5%\r\nunder No. 3.\r\n\r\nThe excavation was begun at the end of May, 1907, and completed in\r\nJanuary, 1908, by Scott and Lee, the contractors. The embankments were\r\nthen allowed to stand until the beginning of July, 1908, to permit the\r\nwhole to become thoroughly settled and consolidated prior to beginning\r\nthe lining. In July the work of trimming the embankments and excavating\r\nfor the foundations of the reservoir columns was commenced, under the\r\nCompany's own administration, which completed the entire work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.--DETAILS OF BEAMS AND COLUMNS FOR SOUTH\r\nRESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII, FIG. 1.--DETAILS OF FORMS FOR SOUTH\r\nRESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII, FIG. 2.--VIEW OF WESTERN HALF OF SOUTH\r\nRESERVOIR, SHOWING FINAL SETTING UP OF DERRICK ON CENTRAL COLUMNS.]\r\n\r\n_Concrete Lining and Roof._--The general arrangement and details of the\r\nside-walls, columns, and roof are shown on Plates VI, VII, VIII and IX.\r\nThe principal feature consists in dividing the reservoir into radial\r\nsections and supporting the roof on 135 primary and 670 secondary beams,\r\nfrom 135 columns, spaced as follows:\r\n\r\n           Outer ring, at 34.25 m. from center    40 columns.\r\n            2d    \"    \"  27.88 \"   \"             40  \"\r\n            3d    \"    \"  21.51 \"   \"             20  \"\r\n           4th    \"    \"  15.41 \"   \"             20  \"\r\n           5th    \"    \"   8.77 \"   \"             10  \"\r\n           6th    \"    \"   2.40 \"   \"              5  \"\r\n                                                 ---\r\n               Total                             135 columns.\r\n\r\nThe inner bottom diameter of the reservoir is 70.32 m. (230.64 ft.); the\r\nupper inside diameter is 81 m. (265.68 ft.); the water depth at the\r\noverflow level is 9 m. (29-1/2 ft).\r\n\r\nThe roof was designed to carry a dead load (the earth cover) of 150 lb.\r\nper sq. ft., and a live load of 100 lb. The maximum compressive fiber\r\nstress in the concrete was assumed at 550 lb. per sq. in. for the beams,\r\nand at 350 lb. for the columns, a low figure, because of their eccentric\r\nloading. The tensile strength of the steel was taken at 14,500 and\r\n16,000 lb. per sq. in. The twisted steel used for the column\r\nreinforcement was made at the local steel plant, but for the beams,\r\netc., a twisted lug bar, of higher quality and greater permissible\r\ntensile stress, was used. The total quantity of steel used was 178 tons.\r\nIt was calculated that the load on the column foundations would not\r\nexceed 1-1/4 tons per sq. ft. With the exception of the side-wall and\r\nfloor, all the concrete was reinforced with steel, of the sizes and\r\nspacing shown on Plate VI.\r\n\r\n_General Construction and Erection Scheme._--The question of ordinary\r\nforms, requiring very heavy timber work, was a serious one, as suitable\r\nlumber is very expensive in Mexico; and the necessity of finishing this\r\nreservoir before the end of the first term allowed under the concession,\r\nwhich expired on December 31st, 1908, led to the adoption of what the\r\nwriter believes is an original scheme for so large a structure. This\r\nscheme was to cast the columns in short sections, mould the radial and\r\nsecondary beams as separate members, and then place them in position\r\nwith derricks. At the same time, in the case of the beams, it was\r\nimportant not to sacrifice either the benefit of that part of the slab\r\nwhich is ordinarily assumed to act as a part of the beam, or the\r\nadditional strength due to continuity; and, in case of the columns, the\r\nstrength due to the reinforcement extending from the foundation to the\r\nbeams.\r\n\r\nThe T-beam section was secured by notching the tops of the moulded\r\nmembers, with notches 10 cm. deep, throughout the lengths of the beams,\r\nas shown on Plate VI. A computation of the maximum flange increment\r\nshows that these notches are sufficient to transfer the flange stresses\r\nto the stem, but, for additional security, flat steel bars were bent to\r\na Z-shape and embedded in the top of the beam, about 60 cm. apart.\r\nContinuity in the beams was secured by carrying the steel to the tops of\r\nthe beams over all supports, and, after erection, concreting them into\r\nthe roof slab. The secondary beams, after casting, were dropped into\r\nrecesses left in the radial beams for the purpose.\r\n\r\n_Concreting, Mixing, etc._--The radial beams and column sections were\r\ncast as nearly as possible under their ultimate positions; the secondary\r\nbeams were cast outside and immediately adjoining the reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe rock and sand was brought from the Company's crushing plant, in\r\n3-cu. yd., side-dump cars, running on a 30-in. track by gravity a\r\ndistance of 1 km., the last 150 m. requiring hauling with 6 mules. The\r\ncars returned all the way to the crusher by gravity. These cars dumped\r\nthe material into bins on the high ground above the reservoir; from\r\nthere it was hoppered into cars which carried to the mixer all the\r\nmaterial for one batch of concrete. Two No. 1 Smith mixers were used,\r\nand from 25 to 30 batches per hour could be handled in each machine.\r\n\r\nThe concrete was transported from the mixers to place in 1/2-cu. yd.,\r\n18-in. gauge, swivel, steel dump-cars pushed by two men. All the\r\nconcrete used in the bottom of the reservoir, for the main beams,\r\ncolumns, and floor, amounting to about 2,460 cu. m., was dumped through\r\na chute into smaller cars. The chute had so many baffle-plates and bolts\r\nthat it resembled a gravity mixer, but, although it was 12 m. long, it\r\neffectively prevented the separation of the materials.\r\n\r\n_Concrete Placing and Moulding._--The square foundations for the columns\r\nwere deposited _in situ_, a recess being left for the reception of the\r\npedestals, which were moulded in place afterward. The capitals and\r\npedestals were cast in one piece, and the columns in 1.21-m. (48-in.)\r\nsections, eight 5-cm. holes being left in them by using wrought-iron\r\npipes, held in place by templates and removed when the castings were\r\nabout 3 hours old. The columns were erected by threading them on the\r\n15.8-mm. (5/8-in.) reinforcing rods, which extended from the pedestals\r\nup through the capitals. The rods were in two lengths, arranged to lap\r\nalternately at one-fourth, the center, and three-fourths of the height\r\nof the columns. In erection, a light timber frame was used in\r\nconjunction with the derrick, and, as the columns were placed, the\r\nreinforcing steel was grouted solid with 1:2 cement mortar.\r\n\r\nAll the erection was done with a combined stiff-leg or guy derrick,\r\nhaving an 80-ft. boom and a 50-ft. mast, and fitted with a 30-h.p.\r\nLambert hoisting engine. The derrick was erected seven times at the\r\ncircumference, and its final position was on top of the center columns.\r\nThe moving of the derrick a distance of about 45 m. and its subsequent\r\nerection occupied usually about 48 hours. The erection work was carried\r\non continuously, day and night, the placing of the whole of the radial\r\nand secondary beams and columns occupying 2-1/2 months.\r\n\r\n_Forms._--As the erection scheme was designed to reduce the cost of\r\nforms, economical construction was of considerable importance. The wall\r\nwas formed in 40 panels, about 6 m. wide and 11.27 m. high. The chief\r\nobject in arranging them in this manner was to permit an expansion\r\njoint, 30 cm. wide, at each panel; this joint was not filled until after\r\nthe completion of the roof, when the temperature inside the reservoir\r\nwas uniform and not subjected to such great fluctuations as if exposed\r\nalternately to the hot sun and comparatively cool nights. The range of\r\ntemperature during the construction period sometimes amounted to 80 deg.\r\nFahr. in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThe expansion joints were left to the last, when a uniform temperature\r\nof about 70 deg. inside permitted the filling of the joints, thus avoiding\r\nall trouble from expansion cracks.\r\n\r\nThe forms are shown in detail on Plate VII. They consisted of shutters\r\nstiffened with four trapezoidal trusses. The bottom posts of the trusses\r\nwere fixed in holes formed in the foundation block; they were propped\r\nback from the embankment at the top, and secured to anchorages by iron\r\nrods.\r\n\r\nSix sets of these forms were used to construct the whole wall. The\r\nconcrete was placed in position through stove-pipe chutes, 20 cm. in\r\ndiameter, in continuous layers, the workmen treading and spading it well\r\nas it was deposited. The forms were allowed to remain 4 or 5 days, and\r\nwere then struck and removed to another section. The pedestals and\r\ncapital forms were of lumber, and five of each were used to cast the\r\ntotal number required. In the column sections the outer steel forms used\r\nin the manufacture of the Estanzuela pipes were adapted for this\r\npurpose. The radial beam forms, shown on Plate VII, were arranged with\r\ninternal wedge-shaped blocks to mould accurately the recess for the\r\nsecondary beams. The bottom forms were left attached to the beams for 28\r\ndays, but the sides and ends were removed after 24 hours. Eight forms\r\nwere sufficient for the whole 135 beams.\r\n\r\nFor the secondary beams, 29 forms were used for the 670 beams, the\r\nbottom lumber also being left until they were mature for handling.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the cross-section of the secondary beam, it will be\r\nnoticed that it is jug-shaped, shelves being left on either side for the\r\nsupport of the roof forms, which were placed after the secondary beams\r\nhad been properly grouted to the radial ones. The lagging was laid\r\ndiagonally, so that the short diameter was slightly greater than the\r\ndistance between the beams. This greatly facilitated the removal of the\r\nlagging, as it was merely necessary to strike the wedge-shaped fillets\r\nbeneath, and turn them clockwise, after tearing out the end lagging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX, FIG. 1.--VIEW OF SEPARATELY MOULDED SECONDARY\r\nBEAMS IN YARD BELOW SOUTH RESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX, FIG. 2.--SETTING PRIMARY BEAMS, SOUTH\r\nRESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\nThe writer believes that the adoption of forms of this type, rather than\r\nthe ordinary kind, led to a saving of lumber of about 400,000 ft. b. m.\r\nDuring the erection and placing of the concrete, all the joining\r\nsurfaces were carefully picked and cleaned, particular care being taken\r\nat the junction of the secondary with the radial beams, and the upper\r\nsurfaces of all beams before laying the roof slab.\r\n\r\nAfter the greater part of the roof was completed, the floor was laid in\r\nthose sections where it was protected from the sun's rays. The concrete\r\nwas placed in two 15-cm. thicknesses, and the work was carried on night\r\nand day, without any joints. The laying of the floor occupied 8 days, or\r\nan average of nearly 100 cu. m. daily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X, FIG. 1.--VIEW OF COMPLETED SECTION OF SOUTH\r\nRESERVOIR. EXPANSION JOINTS IN SIDE-WALL NOT YET FILLED.]\r\n\r\n_Proportions of Concrete._--All the concrete work was brought to a\r\nsmooth face by careful spading, no plastering being used throughout the\r\nreservoir, except in the superstructures. The work was kept well watered\r\nin every case for about 15 days. The whole of the concrete work in\r\nconnection with the reservoir was completed in 5-1/2 months. The\r\nconcrete for the columns and foundations was a 1:3:5 mixture, the\r\naggregate consisting of equal parts of 19-mm. (3/4-in.) and 38-mm.\r\n(1-1/2-in.) crushed stone. The remainder of the concrete, except that\r\nfor the roof, was a 1:2:4 mixture, the aggregate also consisting of\r\nequal parts of 19-and 38-mm. stone. With the exception of a short length\r\nof the side-walls, the sand used was that manufactured by the Company.\r\nWhen the crushing plant was unable to produce all the sand required, the\r\nHornos sand (see Table 3) was used in the side-walls in equal\r\nproportions with the crusher sand.\r\n\r\n_Reservoir Outlet and Entrance Tower._--The outlet, 61 cm. (24 in.) in\r\ndiameter, leads from a well in the center of the reservoir and passes\r\nunder the floor and embankment to an outside valve-pit, 89 m. from the\r\ncenter. This pipe was laid in a trench in a solid cutting before the\r\nconstruction of the embankment, and was encased in 1:4:8 concrete.\r\nWhere it passes under the embankment a 1:2:4 concrete cut-off wall, 3.6\r\nm. wide, 2.5 m. high, and 1 m. thick, was placed across it at right\r\nangles. The cast-iron pipe is curved upward in the central well, and has\r\na bellmouth on which rests a movable circular copper screen.\r\n\r\nAbove the outlet well, and on the roof of the reservoir, there is a\r\ncentral tower, giving access to the interior by a steel stairway. This\r\ntower also serves as a main ventilating shaft, and in it are arranged\r\nthe guide-screens and gearing for raising them for cleaning purposes. In\r\naddition to the ventilation provided in the tower, 20 circular openings,\r\n30 cm. in diameter, are carried through the roof of the reservoir at the\r\ncircumference and into the parapet walls.\r\n\r\n_Inlet Gate-House, etc._--The inlet gate-house is above the reservoir\r\nand about 54-1/2 m. from its center. The conduit enters at 589.00 m.\r\nabove datum, and the gate-house contains the valves for controlling the\r\ninlet pipe to the reservoir, the by-pass, overflow, scour-out pipe, and\r\nthe copper screens. The inlet, which is 45.7 cm. (18 in.) in diameter,\r\nis of cast-iron flanged pipes, carried on iron hangers on the side-wall\r\nof the reservoir, and, at a point 90 cm. above the floor level, it is\r\nturned at right angles to the side-wall and carried on concrete piers to\r\nthe center of the first row of columns. The end of the pipe is closed by\r\na blank flange, and the water is deflected at right angles through two\r\n30-cm. (12-in.) branches, for the purpose of setting up a slight\r\ncircular motion as it enters the reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe valve-pit is clear of the embankment, and in it are brought together\r\nthe main supply and by-pass pipes on which are placed two 61-cm.\r\n(24-in.) sluice-valves; and between them there is a 20-cm. (8-in.)\r\nscour-out pipe, for emptying the reservoir into an adjoining arroyo. The\r\narrangement of the valves gives complete control over the contents of\r\nthe reservoir.\r\n\r\n_Venturi Meter-House._--Fig. 11 shows the arrangement of the Venturi\r\nmeter and its automatic register in a house over the main supply pipe.\r\nThis house is designed to form a feature of the entrance gateway of the\r\nreservoir grounds, which cover an area of 12 hectares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--VENTURI METER-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n_General._--The roof of the reservoir has been laid out as a garden, and\r\nthe embankments are turfed. The intention is to develop the Company's\r\nland as a public park, as it commands fine views of the city and the\r\nsurrounding mountains. An inspector's house has been built, and a\r\nprivate telephone line provides for communication with the Estanzuela\r\nintake and also with the general offices in the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII, FIG. 1.--VIEW OF SOUTH RESERVOIR, LOOKING\r\nTOWARD THE CITY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SAN GERONIMO GRAVITY SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Provisional Supply._--It has already been stated that the Company began\r\noperations at San Geronimo in March, 1906, by sinking a well on the\r\nnorth bank of the Santa Catarina River at San Geronimo. At this point, a\r\nlittle later, a small steam pumping plant, sufficient to handle about\r\n8,000 liters per min., was installed. The lowest depth to which this\r\nwell was ultimately sunk in water-bearing strata, was 7 m., the normal\r\nlevel of the water during 1906 and 1907 never falling lower than 569 m.\r\nabove datum. Tests made from time to time during 1907-08, showed that\r\nthis well was capable of supplying nearly 10,000,000 liters (264,000\r\ngal.) of water daily.\r\n\r\nThe excellent supply yielded by this well made it desirable to adopt it\r\nimmediately as a provisional measure, pending the completion of the\r\nlarger works forming the western source of supply. To utilize the well\r\nto its fullest extent, a reinforced concrete reservoir, of 3,000,000\r\nliters capacity, was constructed on the south bank of the river, the top\r\nwater level being 585 m. above datum, that is, at the same elevation as\r\nthe proposed reservoir for the Estanzuela supply. The reservoir is 53.80\r\nm. long, 21 m. wide, and has a water depth of 3.25 m. at the overflow\r\nlevel. It is excavated on a steep hill slope, and has an earth\r\nembankment on the lower side. The lining is of concrete, 20 cm. thick,\r\nand the roof is of reinforced concrete composed of flat arches springing\r\nfrom beams carried on 46 by 35-cm. reinforced columns. There are 68 of\r\nthese columns, and they are 3 m. apart longitudinally and 5 m. apart\r\ntransversely. The roof was not constructed until October and November,\r\n1907, and prior to that time the necessity of covering the reservoir was\r\namply demonstrated by the growth, during hot weather, of considerable\r\nquantities of green algae, which had to be skimmed from the surface of\r\nthe reservoir every few days.\r\n\r\nThe delivery pipe from the pumping plant was originally of riveted steel\r\nand was asphalted. It was 30 cm. in diameter, 2 mm. in thickness, with\r\nslip joints, and where it crossed the river it was encased in concrete.\r\nThis pipe was afterward replaced by a cast-iron pipe of the same\r\ndiameter. The supply pipe to the city was also of sheet steel, 30 cm. in\r\ndiameter. For a part of its length it was laid in the high ground of the\r\nsouth bank of the river, which it crossed near the western limits of the\r\ncity, and was then connected to a 30-cm, cast-iron pipe in the\r\ndistribution system. The total length of the pipe from the reservoir to\r\nthe city distribution system was 2,850 m.\r\n\r\nThis provisional pipe continued in service from October, 1906, until\r\nAugust 27th, 1909, when the river portion was completely swept away,\r\ntogether with the provisional pump-house at San Geronimo, during the\r\ngreat flood in the Santa Catarina River. Fortunately, the permanent\r\nsupply works were completed at the time, so that the destruction of this\r\npipe line, which had already served its original purpose, had no effect\r\non the supply of water to the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.--SECTION OF INFILTRATION GALLERY, SAN GERONIMO\r\nGRAVITY SUPPLY.]\r\n\r\n_Infiltration Gallery._--The chief feature of the San Geronimo gravity\r\nsupply is the infiltration gallery. By referring to the profile on Plate\r\nXI it will be seen that at this place there is a considerable area of\r\nwhat is undoubtedly water-bearing gravel. The main conditions were\r\nrevealed by the borings previously carried across the valley, but the\r\nprofile has been corrected to show the actual conditions as established\r\nat a subsequent date by shafts. Practically, the water-bearing strata\r\nare not limited merely to the sand and coarse gravels, as the clay\r\nformation lying above and below them is full of small gravel deposits\r\ncontaining considerable volumes of water. The main direction of the\r\nunderflow is toward the east, and the hydraulic gradient, which was\r\nestablished from wells sunk farther west, was found to be approximately\r\n1%, or practically the same as the average surface of the bed of the\r\nriver above the line of the infiltration gallery.\r\n\r\nThe general scheme for tapping this underflow was to drive a main\r\ngallery at the 560-m. level on a grade of 0.05%, which was sufficiently\r\nhigh to take the supply by gravity to the western reservoir, having a\r\ntop water level at 558.75 m. above datum. This elevation is sufficient\r\nto give an excellent pressure over about 60% of the city, and a fair\r\npressure to reach the upper stories of the highest houses, if required,\r\nover the whole supply district. From this gallery it was proposed to\r\nsink shafts at frequent intervals, for a total distance of 300 m.,\r\ncarrying them below the gallery level, to tap any water-bearing gravels\r\nthere might be in the clay formation underlying the gravels and sands.\r\nFrom the main gallery it was proposed to construct branch galleries up\r\nstream on a flat gradient, so as to obtain the advantage of an increased\r\nhead due to the steep hydraulic gradient of the underflow water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--DIAGRAM SHOWING VARIATION IN WATER PLANE 1905\r\nTO MARCH 1910 AT SAN GERONIMO.]\r\n\r\nIn investigations of this kind, it is of first importance to have a\r\ncontinuous record of the level of the water plane, and Fig. 12 has been\r\nplotted to show its variation at San Geronimo from the beginning of\r\n1905 to March, 1910. From January, 1909, to March 31st, 1910, these\r\nlevels are averages of daily readings taken in 9 shafts sunk along the\r\nproposed line of the infiltration gallery. In 1902 the water plane was\r\nstanding at 570.18 m. above datum, but from that date until 1905 the\r\nwriter has been unable to find any records. This diagram should be\r\nexamined together with the rainfall diagram, Fig. 3, and it will be\r\nnoticed that the fall in the water plane drops with the general scarcity\r\nof the rainfall during 1907-08, and until July, 1909. The year previous\r\nto July, 1909, is regarded, by many competent local observers to have\r\nbeen the longest period of extreme drought in 30 years in Nuevo Leon,\r\nand the evidence which the writer has been able to gather regarding\r\nstream flow in the neighborhood of Monterrey supports this view. The\r\ntotal rainfall at Monterrey for the year prior to July 1st, 1909,\r\namounted to 9.98 in., or 4.16 in. less than the lowest record for any\r\ncalender year since 1894, or, in other words, about 45% of the average\r\nannual rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe lowest point to which the water plane dropped was during June and\r\nJuly, 1909, when the levels stood slightly above 565.00 m., or 5 m.\r\nabove the level of the floor of the infiltration gallery. During this\r\nperiod pumping tests were made in the various wells, and from these it\r\nwas quite clear that the infiltration gallery, if carried far enough to\r\nmeet them all, would yield a supply of from 25,000,000 to 40,000,000\r\nliters daily. During the great rainfall of August, 1909, the water\r\nlevels rose very rapidly; the heavy precipitation between August 9th and\r\n10th caused the level to rise to 568.00 m. in about 4 days, and 6 days\r\nafter the great flood of August 27th, the water level, which had\r\ncontinued rising gradually, reached 571.40 m., and then fell gradually\r\nuntil at the end of March, 1910, it was practically the same as it had\r\nbeen from 1902 to 1905.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.--SAN GERONIMO GRAVITY SUPPLY.]\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that the readings were taken in the shafts on the\r\nhigh ground to the west of the present river bed, and were independent\r\nof any flow there might be in the river. During times of ordinary floods\r\nin the river, it was very noticeable that, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthe river water might be turbid to an extreme degree, the well even in\r\nimmediate proximity to the river bed did not show the least sign of\r\ndiscoloration.\r\n\r\n_Design of Works._--Plate XII shows the general design of the gravity\r\nscheme, which consists of a main tunnel 550 m. long and a concrete\r\naqueduct, 1.06 m. (42 in.) in internal diameter and 2,311 m. in length,\r\ndischarging into a low-service distributing reservoir at the extreme\r\nwestern limits of the city. The tunnel and aqueduct were laid on a\r\ngradient of 0.05%, and the latter was designed to discharge 55,000,000\r\nliters per day (22.8 cu. ft. per sec.) if flowing to its full capacity.\r\n\r\n_Gravitation Tunnel._--This tunnel, shown on Plate XII and Fig. 13, was\r\ncompleted prior to driving the infiltration gallery into the\r\nwater-bearing gravel, so that the water encountered in the gallery could\r\nbe easily drained off by gravity, thus avoiding a heavy outlay for\r\npumping. The tunnel passes through various strata, the principal ones\r\nbeing calcareous shale, conglomerate, and gravels. The tunneling\r\noperations were carried on from 5 shafts, No. 1 being 23 m. deep, and\r\nthe others varying from 20 to 10 m. The shafts in loose ground were\r\ntimbered in the usual way, having clear inside dimensions of 2 m. Shaft\r\nNo. 1, which was entirely in shale, was taken out approximately to 3.35\r\nm. in diameter, so as to permit it to be lined with concrete having a\r\nfinished internal diameter of 2.43 m.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--GENERAL DETAILS SAN GERONIMO GRAVITY PIPE LINE.]\r\n\r\nFig. 13 shows the details of the tunnel, which was lined with concrete,\r\nthe bottom and sides being approximately 23 cm. (9 in.) thick. The\r\ninterior dimension is 0.91 m. at the invert level and 1.016 m. at a\r\nheight of 1.22 m., the corners between the side-walls and the floor\r\nbeing slightly curved. The arch is formed of two rings of brickwork in\r\ncement mortar, this thickness being increased in some lengths to three\r\nrings. Where the rock was in good condition, and not likely to\r\ndisintegrate easily, the arch, for a distance of 90 m., was left\r\nunlined. Of the total distance of 550 m., careful timbering was required\r\nfor 300 m. In lining the timbered portion of the tunnel with concrete,\r\nall the timber was removed, except in loose ground, where the laggings\r\nwere left in position.\r\n\r\nWhile the tunnel was being driven, a start was made to drive the north\r\nend of the infiltration gallery, which was in rock for a distance of 44\r\nm. Water appeared at about 35 m., and then the work was temporarily\r\nsuspended until the gravitation tunnel was completed and a length of the\r\naqueduct had been constructed far enough down stream on the north bank\r\nof the river to permit of draining direct to the river. This point was\r\nreached at 1,170 m. from Shaft No. 1, and there a temporary overflow\r\nchamber was constructed.\r\n\r\nWhen the tunnel was completed, the two intermediate shafts were filled\r\nup, the remaining three being retained permanently. Shafts Nos. 2 and 3\r\nwere lined with concrete, 76 cm. (30 in.) in internal diameter, and 23\r\ncm. thick. They were domed at the top to form circular openings to\r\nreceive cast-iron covers. Progress on this tunnel was slow, taking from\r\nDecember, 1907, to November, 1908, to complete, owing chiefly to\r\ndifficulties with an incompetent contractor. The contract was\r\nsubsequently transferred to Mr. John Phillips, of Mexico City (who was\r\nalso the contractor for the aqueduct), who completed it satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n_Continuation of the Infiltration Gallery._--When the aqueduct (to be\r\nreferred to again) was completed as far as 1,170 m. from Shaft No. 1,\r\nthe driving of the infiltration gallery, which was 2 m. high and 1-1/2\r\nm. wide, was continued until gravel was encountered in the roof, at 44\r\nm. from the shaft. At this point the rock dipped at an angle of 45 deg.,\r\nand the gravels contained quantities of large boulders mixed with fine\r\nsand; immediately after encountering the gravel, a flow of about 90\r\nliters per sec. was met, evidently coming through from a pot-hole in the\r\nshale. This quantity diminished in about 10 days to about one-fourth,\r\nbut gradually increased again as the driving proceeded. The operations\r\nof driving the tunnel from 44 m. forward were begun in the dry season,\r\nin February, 1909, and the gravel was encountered for a distance of 24\r\nm., or up to 68 m. from the shaft. The center of this gravel bed was\r\nabout 30 m. south of the old river channel, which had been continuously\r\ndry at the surface for several years. Up to 68 m. the work was very\r\ndifficult, owing to the upper part being of loose gravel and the lower\r\nin very contorted shale. The timbering of the tunnel in the full gravel\r\nsection consisted of heavy square settings, 1 m. apart. At 68 m. the\r\nclay and gravel formation was met, and the rate of progress then was\r\nabout 4 or 5 m. a week. A short branch gallery was also driven about 7\r\nm. up stream near Shaft No. 2. The total distance the infiltration\r\ngallery was carried from Shaft No. 1, was 100 m., when the floods of\r\nAugust, 1909, caused its suspension.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the gallery, attempts were made to sink a 3-1/2\r\nby 2-m. shaft at a point along the line of the infiltration gallery,\r\nabout 130 m. from Shaft No. 1, but water in such abundance was\r\nencountered that it was practically impossible to sink it in the\r\nordinary way more than about 6 m. deep, the quantity of water to be\r\ndealt with amounting to about 20,000,000 liters daily. Seven shafts were\r\nthen sunk in the high ground to the north of the river, five of these\r\nbeing on the line of the gallery and two 30 m. westward. They were sunk\r\nduring the dry season prior to July, 1909. These were ordinary timbered\r\nshafts, 2 m. square between the walings, and were carried to the depths\r\nshown on Plate XI. In Shafts Nos. 5, 6, and 7 the water was flowing with\r\nconsiderable velocity, while Shaft No. 9 seemed to have penetrated a\r\ndifferent water plane and one which was probably independent of that\r\nshowing in any of the other shafts, in which the water was practically\r\nat a uniform level. The evidence obtained showed that if the gallery\r\ncould be carried to Shafts Nos. 6 or 7 a great abundance of water would\r\nbe intercepted. Owing to the difficulties of sinking ordinary shafts in\r\nthe wide river channel, circular shafts were put down. These were 1.37\r\nm. in internal diameter and 23 cm. thick, and were of concrete\r\nreinforced with No. 10 vertical rods, 19 mm. in diameter, tied together\r\nwith No. 6 wire. These shafts were provided with steel cutting edges.\r\n\r\nShaft No. 2 was sunk to a depth of 1 m. below the infiltration gallery\r\nlevel, No. 3 within 2 m., and No. 4 within 4 m., before August, 1909.\r\nThe shafts were sunk by digging them out and loading them at the top,\r\nthe top of the shafts being kept generally 3 m. out of the ground. Shaft\r\nNo. 3 encountered great volumes of water, and, in order to enable\r\nsinking operations to proceed, a pumping shaft, 2-1/4 m. square, was\r\nsunk a little west of it to draw off the water. Notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the prolonged period of drought had lowered the general water plane\r\nin all the shafts to 565.00 m. above datum, the difficulties of handling\r\nthe water even at that level were considerable. At the beginning of\r\nAugust the work was progressing very satisfactorily, but the\r\nextraordinary rainfall of that month caused the work to be shut down\r\ntemporarily.\r\n\r\n_Effect of the Floods in the Santa Catarina River._--The area of the\r\nwater-shed of the Santa Catarina River above Monterrey is about 1,410\r\nsq. km. (544 sq. miles), and its area at San Geronimo, owing to its\r\nconfiguration, is practically the same. Its general character has\r\nalready been referred to. On the night of August 10th and early on the\r\nmorning of August 11th, a big flood came down the river, flowing at its\r\nmaximum about 1,130 cu. m. (40,000 cu. ft.) per sec., due to the heavy\r\nrainfall (Fig. 4). This flood carried away all the temporary staging\r\naround the shafts, seriously wrecking the temporary pumping station, as\r\nwell as destroying the 30-cm. cast-iron pipe, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat it had been encased in a block of concrete 3 m. wide and 1-1/2 m.\r\nthick right across the river; but no damage was done to the infiltration\r\ngallery or to the shafts in the river channel. The effect of the flood\r\non this pipe is shown by Fig. 2, Plate XXXI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXI, FIG. 2.--PROFILE SKETCH, LOOKING UP STREAM ON\r\nLINE OF 24-INCH MAIN SUPPLY PIPE.]\r\n\r\nFollowing this flood, which had caused the loss of 14 lives in the city,\r\n3 miles below San Geronimo, there was practically no rain for 13 days.\r\nThen, on August 25th the second heavy precipitation began and continued\r\nuntil August 29th, the details being shown on Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nThis precipitation, therefore, fell on a water-shed which was completely\r\nsaturated, as it had already absorbed a large proportion of the 13.38\r\nin. of rain which fell during August 10th and 11th; and at every point\r\nalong the river, prior to August 25th, springs were issuing forth, and\r\nthere had been very little evaporation during the intervening dry spell.\r\n\r\nThe writer has calculated that at Monterrey this flood reached the\r\nenormous quantity of 6,650 cu. m. (235,000 cu. ft.) per sec., a rate\r\nequal to 432 cu. ft. per sec. per sq. mile of water-shed.[6] The effect\r\nof this flood was to demolish completely about 1,200 \"sillar\" houses\r\n(without taking into consideration the numerous wooden houses) at\r\nMonterrey, and to cause a fearful loss of life, variously estimated\r\nbetween 3,000 and 5,000 persons; the lower figure the writer believes is\r\napproximately correct. At San Geronimo the original pumping station was\r\ncarried away entirely, leaving practically no trace whatever.\r\n\r\n[6] The writer, in a brief article contributed to _Engineering News_\r\nsoon after the flood (September 23d, 1909), gave this figure as 271,500,\r\nor approximately equal to a run-off of 500 cu. ft. per sec. per sq.\r\nmile; but, from a later and more complete study of the conditions for\r\nmany miles above Monterrey, he believes the above quantity to be\r\napproximately correct.\r\n\r\nShaft No. 2 was apparently destroyed, while No. 3 was turned at an angle\r\nof about 50 deg. down stream and filled up completely with sand. The\r\ninfiltration gallery, near Shaft No. 2, was completely blocked with fine\r\nsand and gravel, and access could only be obtained as far as 54 m. The\r\nprofile, Plate XI, shows the change which had taken place in the river\r\nbed. The original course of the stream was changed to the north bank, 50\r\nm. distant, the effect of the scouring action of the flood being to\r\nlower the general level at this point about 3.65 m., while the southern\r\nportion of the channel was slightly raised. At present (April, 1910),\r\nthe end of the driven portion of the infiltration gallery is about 35 m.\r\nfrom the center of the stream, which is still carrying about 2,270\r\nliters (80 cu. ft.) per sec.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the flood the flow in the gallery was 450 liters (16\r\ncu. ft.) per sec., and this quantity has remained constant since that\r\ntime. The probable effect of the flood was to disturb the whole\r\nsubsurface above the infiltration gallery and put it in motion,\r\ncompletely cleaning the gravels of their surrounding clay, which would\r\naccount for the large infiltration of water in so limited a distance.\r\nThe water has always been limpid and pure, but its hardness remains the\r\nsame as it was prior to the flood.\r\n\r\nWith the copious supply of water from this source, due of course to\r\nabnormal conditions and not likely to be permanent, the operations of\r\ntunneling have been suspended temporarily; but it is proposed to\r\ncontinue the driving of the gallery, from a new shaft west of No. 3.\r\nThe water encountered will be drained off by pumping until the main\r\nwater-bearing gravels, in the neighborhood of Shaft No. 5, are reached.\r\nIt is also proposed to reconstruct the 30-cm. high-level pipe line, from\r\nSan Geronimo along the high road on the north bank of the river, so that\r\nby pumping water can be delivered to the city system from Shafts Nos. 5,\r\n6, and 7, in the event of a shortness of supply from the Estanzuela\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n_Shaft No. 1._--Shaft No. 1 is designed to connect the infiltration\r\ngallery with the gravitation tunnel. This shaft has an inner diameter of\r\n2.43 m. (8 ft.) and is fitted with a special gate-valve. In the bottom\r\nof the door of this valve there is a smaller valve, 30 cm. in diameter,\r\nso that, when the infiltration gallery is closed for cleaning out the\r\nsump, the smaller door, which is operated through the same spindle by a\r\nbevel-geared head-stock at the top of the shaft, can be opened first.\r\nSpace is also left for screens if these should be found necessary.\r\nAccess to this shaft is gained by a reinforced concrete stairway in nine\r\nstages. The superstructure is to be supported on reinforced concrete\r\ncolumn foundations carried to the firm rock, owing to the loose\r\ncondition of the strata at the top of the shaft.\r\n\r\n_Aqueduct._--The construction of the concrete conduit was begun in\r\nApril, 1908. Fig. 13 shows the general types. Type _A_ was adopted in\r\ngravel and conglomerate formation, and Type _B_ where the excavation was\r\nin \"sillar,\" the soft nature of this rock permitting it to be excavated\r\nexactly to the required external diameter of the concrete lining.\r\n\r\nThe concrete which was without steel reinforcement was a 1:2-1/2:3-1/2\r\nmixture, the sand being from the crusher and the aggregate from the\r\nriver bed, screened to pass a 25-mm. mesh. Where the conduit crossed the\r\nriver obliquely, immediately below the gravitation tunnel, it was\r\nstrengthened with mass boulder concrete of Type _C_. During the great\r\nflood this heavy section withstood its effects without damage of any\r\nkind, but beyond this point, where the conduit had been laid in compact\r\ncemented gravels, the scouring action of the flood on the north bank\r\nlowered the level of the gravels from 2 to 3 m.; the only damage,\r\nhowever, was the scouring away of the gravels at the south side of the\r\nconduit. To prevent such an occurrence in the future, the conduit at\r\nthat point was strengthened with additional concrete for a distance of\r\n195 m., as shown on Fig. 13. The extra concrete, amounting to 733 cu.\r\nm., was a 1:3:5 mixture, in which was embedded 20% of heavy boulders.\r\nThe top of this special length now forms a weir for the present river\r\nflow. Where the conduit enters the bluff on the north side of the river,\r\nat 1,200 m., there is an overflow chamber which has a sluice-gate 76 cm.\r\nwide, arranged so that the conduit can overflow at the present time when\r\nrunning 76 cm. deep. To deflect the flow in the conduit, a wrought-iron\r\nplate, provided with a balance weight, is dropped into a groove on the\r\nlower side. The outlet is a 61 cm. concrete tube, having its invert\r\nabove ordinary flood level, and arranged to be closed by a gate.\r\n\r\nAt 1,963 m. the conduit is carried over an arroyo on a segmental arch of\r\n8 m. clear span, as shown on Fig. 13. There are 5 ventilating columns\r\nand 5 manholes on the aqueduct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X, FIG. 2.--SETTING FORMS FOR SAN GERONIMO\r\nCULVERT.]\r\n\r\nThe aqueduct terminates in the Obispado distributing reservoir\r\nvalve-house, at a level of 558.50 m. The work in connection with this\r\naqueduct was completed by December, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DISTRIBUTING RESERVOIR AT OBISPADO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main distributing reservoir for the San Geronimo gravity supply is\r\nimmediately below the historic Obispado (Bishop's Palace), at the western\r\nlimits of the city. The general arrangement and lay-out is shown on Plate\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.--GENERAL PLAN AND SECTIONS, OBISPADO\r\nRESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\n_Valve-House._--The invert of the conduit from San Geronimo, where it\r\nenters the valve-house, is 558.50 m. above datum. The valve-house, which\r\nis built in the center of the reservoir, is shown on Fig. 2, Plate XVIII.\r\nOne of its special features is the provision of the main overflow at this\r\npoint instead of within the reservoir proper. The inlet, main supply\r\ntunnel, independent by-pass overflow, scour-out pipes, gate-valves, and\r\nscreens, are all controlled within the valve-house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII, FIG. 2.--VIEW OF ROOF OF OBISPADO RESERVOIR,\r\nLOOKING NORTH.]\r\n\r\n_Reservoir._--The reservoir is rectangular, 126 by 81 m. (413.28 by\r\n265.68 ft.) at the top, and has a water depth of 4 m. (13.1 ft.). In the\r\ndesign it was necessary to limit it to the lowest economical depth, so\r\nas to increase the static pressure over the low-pressure district as\r\nmuch as possible.\r\n\r\n_Excavation and Embankment._--The excavation, except for a depth of\r\nabout 1 m. which was in black soil, was chiefly in a disintegrated\r\n\"sillar\" stratum of a heavy clayey nature, the greater part of which\r\ncould be handled conveniently with plows and scrapers; the actual\r\nfoundation on the eastern half required blasting for the final depths.\r\n\r\nThe total excavation amounted to 56,479 cu. m., of which 7,255 cu. m.\r\nwere placed in the embankment, the remainder being deposited in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the reservoir. The final trimming of the\r\nbanks, which were left 30 cm. full, was not undertaken until the lining\r\nwas begun. The work was done under contract with Mr. J. S. Nickerson, of\r\nMonterrey. The excavation had only one classification, and the contract\r\nprices were 0.50 peso per cu. m. for material carried to spoil banks,\r\nand 1.00 peso for material placed in the embankment. The excavation was\r\nbegun in December, 1907, and completed in April, 1908. The work was then\r\nleft standing until the end of 1908 to allow the banks to consolidate\r\nthoroughly prior to lining, which was begun on January 4th, 1909.\r\n\r\n_Concrete Lining and Roof._--Plate XIII shows the general plan and\r\nsections, the main feature being the simple division of the reservoir\r\ninto 24 rows of columns longitudinally and 15 rows transversely, making\r\na total of 360 columns, less the four left out at the central tower. All\r\nthe columns are 5 m. apart both ways. The roof was designed for a live\r\nload of 100 lb. and a dead load of 150 lb., the same as at the South\r\nReservoir. With the exception of the floor, all the concrete work was\r\nreinforced with twisted steel lug bars. The foundation load on the\r\ncolumns for the eastern half of the reservoir is 0.9 ton per sq. ft.;\r\nthat on the columns for the western half, where the foundation is of\r\nvery hard sillar and conglomerate, is 1.95 tons per sq. ft.\r\n\r\n_Under-drainage of the Floor._--To provide for proper drainage in case\r\nof seepage, the floor was underdrained with rubble drains, 30 cm. wide\r\nand 23 cm. deep, filled with large round gravel carted from the bed of\r\nthe Santa Catarina River. The total length of these underdrains is 1,160\r\nm. In order to facilitate the detection of any seepage, they were\r\nconducted to a permanent inspection pit outside of the reservoir.\r\n\r\n_Main Distributing Conduit._--The main distributing conduit is laid\r\nalong the inside of the reservoir, at the inlet end, and carried on\r\nelliptical arches of 2 m. span to a height of 71 cm. above the finished\r\nfloor level. This conduit is 76 cm. high and 45.7 cm. wide, and it\r\nbranches in two directions from the inlet tunnel to each side of the\r\nreservoir, its total length being 69 m. In order to prevent any\r\nstagnation and to give a continuous circulation, the water is delivered\r\nat eight points, in the length of the distributing pipe, through square\r\nopenings with semicircular tops, the areas of the openings increasing\r\ntoward the ends. These inlets are placed so that the current will not\r\nstrike the roof columns.\r\n\r\n_Outlet Tunnel and Valve-House._--The outlet tunnel is at the north end\r\nof the reservoir, and was excavated in hard sillar rock. The tunnel is\r\nlined with concrete 30 cm. thick, the finished internal dimensions being\r\n1.52 by 0.91 m. The length of the tunnel is 22.5 m. to the point where\r\nit enters the outlet-house. This house is divided by a wall 45 cm.\r\nthick, which supports a 76-cm. (30-in.) penstock-valve. The supply pipe\r\nto the city leaves this chamber in the west wall, and is also fitted\r\nwith a 76-cm. penstock-valve. The supply pipe has a copper screen of the\r\nsame design and dimensions as those in the inlet-house. A 30-cm.\r\n(12-in.) scour-out pipe in this chamber provides for draining the\r\ncontents of the reservoir to a neighboring irrigation ditch, when\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe superstructure of the valve-house is of concrete, and at the floor\r\nlevel there are bevel-geared head-stocks to raise the valves, etc.\r\n\r\n_By-Pass and Supply Pipes._--The by-pass and supply pipes are carried\r\nbelow the reservoir embankment to join the main 76-cm. (30-in.)\r\ncast-iron distributing pipe to the city. For this short distance they\r\nwere constructed of concrete, 76 cm. in internal diameter, 10 cm. (4\r\nin.) thick, reinforced with 6-1/2-mm. square steel longitudinal rods, 30\r\ncm. from center to center in the circumference, and hooped with\r\n6-1/2-mm. square steel rods spaced 30 cm. apart. The concrete forming\r\nthese pipes was a 1:1-1/2:2-1/2 mixture.\r\n\r\n_Parapet Walls._--The parapet walls have 12 piers at each side and 8 at\r\neach end. In these piers there are ventilating openings branching at the\r\ntop to each side of the parapet, with outlets provided with cast-iron\r\nscreens. This arrangement gives 4 sq. m. of ventilating space (exclusive\r\nof that provided in the central tower), equally distributed at 40 points\r\naround the walls of the reservoir.\r\n\r\n_General Construction Scheme._--The concrete mixing plant, which\r\nconsisted of two No. 1 Smith mixers, was arranged in connection with the\r\nbins and hoppers for the rock and sand on the high ground to the west,\r\nand from there the material was conveyed on a framed timber gangway\r\ncarried right across the center of the reservoir, as shown by Fig. 1,\r\nPlate XVII. From this central platform the concrete for the columns was\r\nfilled from stages placed on the top of traveling towers, 5 m. high,\r\nwhich were run between two rows of columns on standard-gauge rails laid\r\non the floor of the reservoir. By this arrangement 24 columns could be\r\nfilled from each length of track. A main narrow track was also laid\r\nright around the reservoir, with the necessary turn-outs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII, FIG. 1.--FILLING PRIMARY BEAMS FROM TRAVELING\r\nTOWER, OBISPADO RESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV, FIG. 1.--CONSTRUCTION OF WEST SIDE-WALL OF\r\nOBISPADO RESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV, FIG. 2.--PRIMARY BEAMS AND COLUMNS, OBISPADO\r\nRESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.--DETAILS OF FORMS FOR CONCRETE WORK, OBISPADO\r\nRESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\nThe forms for the columns, primary and secondary beams, are shown on\r\nPlate XIV. The side forms for the primary beams were struck in 24 hours,\r\nso as to economize lumber; but the bottom lumber was left in position\r\nfor 28 days. To avoid much unnecessary timber, the secondary beam forms\r\nwere supported at the ends on reinforced concrete corbels cast on the\r\nprimary beams.\r\n\r\nFor placing the side-walls, a special traveling form was used, the\r\ndetails of which are shown clearly on Plate XIV. At the end of each form\r\nan expansion joint of 25 cm. was left to be filled after the roof was\r\nplaced in position. The concrete was delivered to the wall through\r\nstove-pipe chutes, and carefully spaded by workmen in the limited space\r\nbetween the forms and the embankment. The wall form was removed after 36\r\nhours, by loosening the jacks and pulling forward the hooked tie-rods.\r\nThis form is also shown on Fig. 2, Plate XVI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI, FIG. 2.--TRAVELING SIDE-WALL FORM, OBISPADO\r\nRESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI, FIG. 1.--PREPARING FLOOR FOR CONCRETING,\r\nOBISPADO RESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\nThe concreting of the roof slab was carried on continuously, and, when\r\npartly completed, the floor was laid in the shade. The bottom layer of\r\nthe floor, 13 cm. thick, was laid in continuous panels between the\r\ncolumns, and brought to a fairly smooth surface. On this surface, after\r\nkeeping it wet for 10 days and then allowing it to dry thoroughly, a\r\nlayer of asphaltum, supplied by the American Asphaltum and Rubber\r\nCompany, of Chicago, was placed. The work was done by ordinary Mexican\r\nlaborers after they had received a few days' instruction from one of the\r\nAsphaltum Company's superintendents. The surface of the lower layer was\r\nkept perfectly clean, and then received one coat of \"Pioneer\" paint. The\r\nasphaltum, heated in a boiler inside the reservoir to a temperature of\r\napproximately 425 deg. Fahr., was then poured over the floor from buckets,\r\nin a layer approximately 4 mm. thick. Where the floor joined the column\r\npedestals, and at each new panel section, a double thickness was used.\r\nThe labor cost of water-proofing, including superintendence, etc.,\r\namounted to 3.3 cents (Mexican) per sq. m. for painting with \"Pioneer\"\r\npaint, and 5.4 cents for the asphaltum coating, or a total labor cost of\r\n8.7 cents per sq. m. for the complete water-proofing. This cost is based\r\non a rate of 8.00 pesos per day for a foreman, and 1.00 peso for each\r\nlaborer. It required 50 U. S. gal. of the paint to cover 265.2 sq. m.,\r\nand an average of about 6 lb. of asphaltum for 1 sq. m.\r\n\r\nThe upper concrete layer of the floor, 10 cm. thick, was placed so as to\r\nbreak joint with the lower, and was brought to a smooth surface with\r\nwooden floats sheathed with steel and reaching across the panels. In\r\nthis way a perfectly smooth surface was obtained without any plastering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII, FIG. 2.--CENTRAL TOWER AND STAIRWAY, OBISPADO\r\nRESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\nThe concrete for the beams, columns, side-walls, and floor, was a\r\n1:2-1/2:4 mixture, crushed sand and stone being used throughout. In the\r\nroof slab the mixture was 1:2:3.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the concrete work of the reservoir was completed in 6\r\nmonths, by the Company's own administration, and the reservoir was first\r\nput into service a few days after the great flood of August 27th, when\r\nthe Estanzuela supply main, crossing the Santa Catarina River, was\r\npartly destroyed. Since that time frequent examinations of the\r\ninspection pit, which is connected by a pipe to the rubble drains under\r\nthe floor, have never revealed the slightest leakage.\r\n\r\n_Lay-Out of the Reservoir Roof and Grounds._--The Company owns about\r\n11-1/2 hectares of land, which includes that occupied by the reservoir\r\nand its surroundings, and as this property is in an attractive\r\nsituation, commanding fine views of the Sierra Madre Mountains, the\r\nwhole of the works have been given a pleasing architectural character,\r\nand the grounds laid out to form a public park for the citizens of\r\nMonterrey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--SKETCH PLAN OF LAY OUT AT OBISPADO RESERVOIR.]\r\n\r\nThe general plan of the scheme is shown by Fig. 14 and Fig. 2, Plate\r\nXVIII. The roof, which has an area of 1 hectare, has been laid out with\r\nwalks and grass plots, and the surrounding embankments have been\r\nconverted into driveways. Above the reservoir a small plazuela of 1/2\r\nhectare has been laid out with a space above it for a band-stand. The\r\nwhole of the ground has been encircled with carriage drives, on which it\r\nis the intention to plant shade trees. The lay-out of this land also\r\nembraced the scheme for protecting the reservoir by draining the\r\nsurface-water away to the irrigation ditches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               COMPARISON OF SOUTH AND OBISPADO RESERVOIRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two reservoirs are practically of the same capacity, the only\r\ndifference being the level of the overflows in their relationship to the\r\nroof, which gives the Obispado Reservoir a slightly greater capacity.\r\nSome comparative figures may be of interest, owing to the differences in\r\ntype and construction. Table 7 gives the comparative quantities of\r\nmaterial in each reservoir proper, that is to say, exclusive of the\r\nvalve-houses, lay-out of grounds, etc.\r\n\r\n  TABLE 7.--COMPARISON OF MATERIALS IN SOUTH AND OBISPADO RESERVOIRS.\r\n\r\n  ==========================+===============================+============\r\n                            |    SOUTH RESERVOIR.  | _OBISPADO RESERVOIR._\r\n                            +--------+-------------+--------+------------\r\n                            |        | Quantities, |        | Quantities,\r\n                            |   No.  | in cubic    |   No.  | in cubic\r\n                            |        | meters.     |        | meters.\r\n  --------------------------+--------+-------------+--------+------------\r\n  _Earthwork:_              |        |             |        |\r\n      Total excavation      |  ...   |   34,000    |   ...  |   56,479\r\n      Placed in embankment  |  ...   |   31,500    |   ...  |    7,255\r\n      Placed in spoil banks |  ...   |    2,500    |   ...  |   49,224\r\n                            +--------+-------------+--------+------------\r\n  _Concrete:_               |        |             |        |\r\n      Columns (including    |        |             |        |\r\n               foundations) |  135   |    1,240    |   356  |      543\r\n      Primary beams         |  135   |      440    |   374  |      462\r\n      Secondary beams       |  670   |      515    | 1,252  |      576\r\n      Side-walls            |  ...   |    1,255    |   ...  |      710\r\n                            |        |             |        |\r\n                            | Square |             | Square |\r\n                            | meters.|             | meters.|\r\n      Roof slab             | 5,140  |      520    | 10,206 |    1,020\r\n      Floor                 | 4,070  |      780    |  9,200 |    2,120\r\n      Parapet walls         |  ...   |       90    |   ...  |      165\r\n                            +--------+-------------+--------+------------\r\n           Total concrete   |  ...   |    4,840    |   ...  |    5,596\r\n                            +--------+-------------+--------+------------\r\n                            |        |  Pounds.    |        |  Pounds.\r\n  Reinforcing steel bars    |  ...   |  387,000    |   ...  |  380,000\r\n                            |        |             |        |\r\n                            |        |  Square     |        |  Square\r\n                            |        |  meters.    |        |  meters.\r\n  Expanded metal in roofs,  |        |             |        |\r\n                slabs, etc. |  ...   |    5,691    |   ...  |   10,490\r\n  ==========================+========+=============+========+============\r\n\r\nThe total cost of these reservoirs, including valve-houses, by-passes,\r\nand the length of supply pipe where the by-pass joins, and including all\r\nengineering expenses, etc., but exclusive of the cost of lands,\r\nplanting, fencing, and special work in connection with the formation of\r\nparks, was as follows:\r\n\r\nSouth Reservoir: 394,000 pesos, or 10,368 pesos per million liters.\r\n\r\nObispado Reservoir: 375,000 pesos, or 9,375 pesos[7] per million liters.\r\n\r\n[7] Mexican currency.\r\n\r\nThese rates may be regarded as reasonable when taking into consideration\r\nthe special difficulties of construction in Mexico, and the high cost of\r\nall imported material, on which heavy duties are levied.\r\n\r\nThe value of the materials alone in these reservoirs amounted to more\r\nthan 70% of their total cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              ANALYSES OF ESTANZUELA AND SAN GERONIMO WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 8 shows analyses of the Estanzuela and San Geronimo waters, made\r\nin February, 1910, by Messrs.

Plate XIX\r\nshows in skeleton form the lines of the cast-iron mains. These are laid\r\nat the present time along routes containing houses (excluding wooden\r\nshacks) which can be served immediately. The distribution system is\r\narranged to serve as follows:\r\n\r\n               Estanzuela supply              4,150 houses.\r\n               San Geronimo supply            8,600   \"\r\n                                             --------------\r\n                   Total                     12,750 houses.\r\n\r\nThis represents, at the present time, a division of the city of 32-1/2%\r\nfor the Estanzuela, and 67-1/2% for the San Geronimo supply. Of the area\r\nof the supply district north of Santa Catarina River, 57% will be\r\nsupplied from San Geronimo and 43% from Estanzuela. The real development\r\nof the city, however, is northward in the area of the low-pressure\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThe static pressure over the city in the two sections varies as follows:\r\n\r\n                Estanzuela supply             85 to 50 lb.\r\n                San Geronimo supply           55 to 29 lb.\r\n\r\nThe main supply pipe from the South Reservoir is 61 cm. (24 in.) in\r\ninternal diameter, and this size allows ample provision for future\r\nextensions. The supply pipe from the Obispado Reservoir is 76 cm. (30\r\nin.) in internal diameter. On this main, in Calle de Cinco de Mayo, at a\r\ndistance of 320 m. from the reservoir, has been placed a 76-cm. (30-in.)\r\nVenturi meter, the recording apparatus being in the house on the side of\r\nthe road. Both these supply pipes are carried well into the city, and\r\nfrom them the distribution mains are laid; these are 45.7 and 30 cm. (18\r\nand 12 in.) in internal diameter, with intermediate sections of 15 and\r\n10 cm. (6 in. and 4 in.). Along Calle de Cinco de Mayo, where the\r\ndivision between the two services takes place, two lines are laid, a\r\n30-cm. for high pressure and a 38-cm. (15-in.) for the low pressure. A\r\nduplicate pipe, 30 cm. (12 in.) in diameter, is also laid in Calle de\r\nDr. Coss. On Calle de Alvarez the low-pressure pipe is 61 cm. (24 in.),\r\nand the high-pressure, 45.7 cm. (18 in.) in diameter. Provision is also\r\nmade for extending the range of the two services to other districts.\r\nPractically every block is provided with gate-valves to cut off the\r\nsupply in any direction. On the 76-cm. main, 61-cm. (24-in.) valves are\r\nused, and are connected by tapers to the pipe. On the 61-cm. mains,\r\n45.7-cm. (18-in.) valves are used. The actual frictional loss by\r\nreducing the valve being small, this method permitted the use of valves\r\nof a more convenient size. On all the larger valves there are 15-cm.\r\nby-passes fitted with independent gate-valves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--CONNECTION BETWEEN HIGH-AND LOW-PRESSURE AREAS\r\nAND THE INTERSECTION OF CINCO DE MAYO AND ALVAREZ STREETS.]\r\n\r\nScour-out pipes, 10 cm. (4 in.) and 15 cm. (6 in.) in diameter, are\r\nplaced in various parts of the system, draining to the sewers.\r\nAir-valves, both double and single, are also placed at high points in\r\ndifferent parts of the system.\r\n\r\n_Reducing Valves._--At four points in the system the mains are arranged\r\nso that the supply can be interchangeable. Fig. 15 shows the arrangement\r\nof the mains at the junction of Cinco de Mayo and Alvarez Streets, and\r\nis typical of the arrangement at the other points.\r\n\r\nEach reducing valve is placed on a 30-cm. (12-in.) branch main between\r\nthe two services. These valves adjust themselves automatically to the\r\npressure required, after they have been properly regulated to the\r\ndifferent pressures on either side. To allow repairs to be easily made,\r\nthere are ordinary gate-valves at each end enclosed in the same pit. If\r\nnecessary, as in case of fire, any part of the system can be changed\r\ninto high pressure temporarily by closing the valves against the San\r\nGeronimo supply.\r\n\r\nTable 9 gives the length of the mains as laid, and the number of valves.\r\n\r\n                    TABLE 9.--LENGTH OF WATER MAINS.\r\n\r\n      =========================+=====================+=============\r\n            DIAMETER:          |                     |\r\n      --------------+----------+ Length, in meters.  | Number of\r\n       Centimeters. |  Inches. |                     | gate-valves.\r\n      --------------+----------+---------------------+-------------\r\n           10.2     |     4    |     49,831.68       |    677\r\n           15.2     |     6    |     31,918.31       |    306\r\n           30.5     |    12    |     14,461.31       |    117\r\n           38.1     |    15    |      1,661.98       |     11\r\n           45.7     |    18    |      4,522.61       |      5\r\n           61.0     |    24    |      2,826.54       |     10\r\n           76.2     |    30    |      1,454.40       |\r\n      --------------+----------+---------------------+-------------\r\n                 Totals        |    106,676.83       |  1,126\r\n      =========================+=====================+=============\r\n\r\nThe pipes were all cast according to the British Standard Specification,\r\nin 3.65-m. (12-ft.) lengths, and were supplied by Messrs. D. Y. Stewart\r\nand Company, and Messrs. Dick, Kerr and Company, of Kilmarnock and\r\nLondon. The valves were all of standard design, faced with gun-metal,\r\nand were supplied by Messrs. Glenfield and Kennedy, Limited, of\r\nKilmarnock, Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn the distribution system it is proposed to provide 200 fire-hydrants,\r\nby arrangement with the municipality, but only a few of these have been\r\nplaced. The general type is a double hydrant for two 63.5-mm.\r\n(2-1/2-in.) streams. These are to be placed at the corner of every block\r\nin the business portion of the city; single-way hydrants will be used in\r\nthe residential districts.\r\n\r\n_Laying Cast-iron Pipes._--Table 10 has been prepared to show what can\r\nbe accomplished with Mexican labor in laying pipes. In this kind of work\r\nthe labor was particularly efficient; after the gangs were once drilled\r\ninto shape, the work proceeded systematically, and at very good speed.\r\nAll the pipes, after being laid, were tested to 150 lb. per sq. in. in\r\nthe presence of the Technical Inspector.\r\n\r\nTable 11 gives the details of the excavation, the material, and the\r\naverage cost, of laying about 106.6 km. of pipes.\r\n\r\n_House Connections._--The ordinary house connections, which are of\r\n19-mm. (3/4-in.) galvanized-steel pipe, are connected to the mains by\r\nlead goosenecks and brass corporation cocks. The Company's obligation\r\nunder the concession extended to the edge of the sidewalk, and at this\r\npoint curb-boxes, chiefly of the Hays pattern, were placed; but,\r\nsubsequently, owing to the metering of every house service in the city,\r\nthe control of the Company extended to the meter, which, as a rule, is\r\nplaced immediately inside of the house. Owing to the rapid deterioration\r\nof the house service pipes in some districts of the northern part of the\r\ncity, where the soil is formed of decaying organic matter, it has been\r\ndecided to use lead pipe entirely from the main to the meter.\r\n\r\n_Damage Due to Floods._--During the night of August 27th, the main\r\n61-cm. pipe, under the river bed of Santa Catarina, at the point where\r\nthe main entered the city, was destroyed for a distance of 130 m., due\r\nto the scouring away of a whole block of city property. The Venturi\r\nmeter register chart at the South Reservoir showed that the break\r\noccurred a few minutes before midnight. The location of this pipe is\r\nshown by Fig. 5; its broken end was in proximity to an old bridge pier.\r\nFortunately, at the time of the flood, the Obispado Reservoir works were\r\ncompleted, and the whole city was supplied with water from San Geronimo\r\nwithin 48 hours. As only about 1,500 services had then been connected,\r\nthis delay was not serious; in fact, in the lower part of the city, the\r\nwater in the mains was sufficient until the San Geronimo supply could be\r\nconnected. To make a temporary connection to conduct the high-pressure\r\nwater to the city, a 15-cm. steel pipe was placed above ground, on the\r\nline of the main, for a distance of 100 m. This pipe was supported by a\r\ncable, 30 mm. in diameter, and by timber trestles. By limiting the\r\nsupply district, this pipe was of sufficient capacity to serve until the\r\nlarge main could be safely restored.\r\n\r\n   TABLE 10.--COST OF LAYING AND JOINTING CAST-IRON PIPES, EXCLUDING\r\n   LOWERING AND TESTING.\r\n\r\n  +--------------+----------+----------------------------------------+\r\n  |              |          | 76 CM.

scoured away, but\r\nconsiderable salvage was done afterward, and, as it is the intention of\r\nthe authorities not to permit rebuilding along the flood-path of the\r\nriver, these mains do not require reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MAIN SEWERAGE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Company's obligations, as far as drainage is concerned, were limited\r\nto the removal and disposal of sewage, no provision being required for\r\nstorm-water, which is allowed to find its way to the natural\r\nwatercourses. Apart from that fact, however, the best system for a city\r\nlike Monterrey, where rainfall for many months at a time is very scarce,\r\nis the strictly \"separate system.\" In the design advantage was taken of\r\nthe natural topography of the drainage district, which is almost an\r\nideal one for a gravitation system of sewers, the general fall in all\r\ndirections being northeast; it was also in this direction that the best\r\navailable land could be obtained for disposal purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.--DIAGRAM OF THE MAIN SEWERS OF MONTERREY.]\r\n\r\nPlate XX shows in skeleton form the general lay-out of the sewers. Two\r\ndrainage districts are arranged, divided by Calle de Washington, which may\r\nbe regarded as practically the center of the city, and each of these\r\ndistricts has an independent main collector connecting to the outfall\r\nsewer at the northeast extremity of the city.\r\n\r\nThe system has been designed so that extensions may be made and may cover\r\nany part within the city limits; the main collectors are large enough for\r\nthe whole area when fully built up.\r\n\r\nThe sewers are designed on a very liberal basis, namely, on the assumption\r\nthat when flowing half full the quantity to be dealt with will be 380\r\nliters per capita per day, with a maximum rate of flow of 200 per cent. It\r\nwas assumed that each house would be occupied by 7 persons and have a\r\nfrontage of 12-1/2 m. The minimum velocities in the sewers, when running\r\nfull, vary between 0.91 and 1.5 m. per sec., with the exception of a few\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\nThe minimum size adopted was 24.3 cm. (8 in.) in internal diameter. The\r\nsewers of diameters between 24.3 and 50 cm., are 0.91 m. (36 in.) long,\r\nand are of salt-glazed vitrified clay, imported from San Antonio, Tex.\r\n\r\nTable 12 gives the details of the length of the various sewers laid.\r\n\r\n                      TABLE 12.--LENGTH OF SEWERS.\r\n\r\n   +----------+------------------------------------------+-----------+\r\n   |DIAMETER: |                                          |           |\r\n   +-----+----+        Kind.                             | Length,   |\r\n   |  cm | in.|                                          | in meters.|\r\n   +-----+----+------------------------------------------+-----------+\r\n   |24.3 |  8 |    Fire-clay                             | 38,332.85 |\r\n   |25.4 | 10 |       \"                                  | 16,400.69 |\r\n   |30.5 | 12 |       \"                                  |  7,953.15 |\r\n   |38.1 | 15 |       \"                                  |  4,850.56 |\r\n   |45.7 | 18 |       \"                                  |  2,023.40 |\r\n   |50.8 | 20 |       \"                                  |  1,450.53 |\r\n   |55.9 | 22 | Reinforced concrete tubes, 6.9 cm. thick |  3,134.20 |\r\n   |61.0 | 25 |     \"         \"       \"    7.6 \"     \"   |    357.40 |\r\n   |68.6 | 27 |       Brick and concrete                 |    484.05 |\r\n   |76.2 | 30 |         \"    \"     \"                     |    662.69 |\r\n   |     |    |                                          |           |\r\n   |     |    |                                 Total    | 75,649.15 |\r\n   +-----+----+------------------------------------------+-----------+\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the manholes are of brickwork, 23 cm. thick, and\r\nhave concrete inverts. They have a diameter of 1.2 m., which is reduced to\r\n0.61 m. at the top, and each is provided with a heavy cast-iron frame and\r\nclosed cover weighing about 190 kg. There are 521 manholes, and they are\r\nplaced at every block and on long lines about 80 m. apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--STANDARD 300-GAL. FLUSH TANKS.]\r\n\r\nThe sewers are flushed with 15-cm. (6-in.) automatic flushing siphons of\r\nthe Miller pattern with 20-cm. (8-in.) discharge pipes. There are 278 of\r\nthese siphons, and they are placed in flush-tanks (Fig. 16) built of\r\nbrickwork and plastered with 1:1 cement mortar. Their capacity varies from\r\n800 to 1,200 liters, and they discharge from 22-1/2 to 28-1/2 liters per\r\nsec. They are timed to flush once in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThe system is at present ventilated by 23-cm. (9-in.) steel ventilating\r\ncolumns (Fig. 16), with ornamental cast-iron bases. There are 220 of these\r\ncolumns. Most of them are 7.85 m. above the level of the edge of the\r\nsidewalk, and are connected to special 15-cm. branch pipes leading from\r\nthe sewer on the outside of the flush-tanks. In the center of the city\r\nthey are provided with extension lengths, giving a total height of 12 m.\r\n\r\nTable 13 gives the particulars of the average distributed cost of laying\r\nthe 75.6 km. of sewers.\r\n\r\n        TABLE 13.--AVERAGE COST, PER LINEAR METER, FOR 75.6 KM.\r\n            OF SEWERS, FOR MATERIALS AND LABOR COMPLETE.\r\n\r\n  +----------+-----------+--------+-----------------------------+--------+\r\n  |          | INTERNAL  |Cost of |    EARTHWORK AND LABOR:     | Total  |\r\n  |          | DIAMETER  | mater- |-------+------------+--------| cost of|\r\n  |          |   OF      | ials   |       | Cost of    |Cost of | sewer  |\r\n  |          |  SEWERS.  |includ- |Average| excavation,|labor   |complete|\r\n  |Kind of   +------+----+ ing    | depth | including  |  in    |  per   |\r\n  |  Sewer.  |      |    |10-cm.  |  of   | back-      |laying  | linear |\r\n  |          |      |    |(4-in.) | sewer | filling,   |(includ-| meter. |\r\n  |          |  cm. | in.|branches|       | removing   | ing    |        |\r\n  |          |      |    |every   |   m.  | surplus,   |hauling,|        |\r\n  |          |      |    |4-1/2 m.|       | etc.       | etc.). |        |\r\n  |          |      |    |Pesos.  |       | Pesos.     | Pesos. |        |\r\n  +----------+------+----+--------+-------+------------+--------+--------+\r\n  |Fire-clay | 24.3 |  8 |  2.00  |  2.10 |    3.46    | 0.21   | 5.67   |\r\n  |    \"     | 25.4 | 10 |  2.78  |  2.25 |    3.97    | 0.2625 | 7.0125 |\r\n  |    \"     | 30.5 | 12 |  3.64  |  2.50 |    4.705   | 0.305  | 8.65   |\r\n  |    \"     | 38.1 | 15 |  6.14  |  2.75 |    5.50    | 0.4375 |12.0775 |\r\n  |    \"     | 45.7 | 18 |  8.80  |  3.00 |    6.745   | 0.645  |16.19   |\r\n  |    \"     | 50.8 | 20 | 11.30  |  3.50 |    8.275   | 0.815  |20.39   |\r\n  |Concrete  | 55.9 | 22 |  5.93  |  3.50 |    9.19    | 1.325  |16.445  |\r\n  |    \"     | 61.0 | 25 |  7.30  |  3.75 |   11.245   | 1.685  |20.23   |\r\n  |One brick}|      |    |        |       |            |        |        |\r\n  |thick on }| 68.6 | 27 |  7.17  |  3.75 |   11.735   | 3.93   |22.835  |\r\n  |concrete }| 76.2 | 30 |  7.925 |  4.00 |    14.53   | 4.515  |26.97   |\r\n  |founda-  }|      |    |        |       |            |        |        |\r\n  |tions    }|      |    |        |       |            |        |        |\r\n  +----------+------+----+--------+-------+------------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--SKETCH SHOWING DISCONNECTING TRAP ON HOUSE\r\nDRAIN.]\r\n\r\nThe house connections are chiefly of 10-cm. (4-in.) pipes, laid on a\r\nminimum gradient of 2-1/2%, from oblique branches on the sewer to siphon\r\nintercepting traps near the house, as shown by Fig. 17. From this trap a\r\n10-cm. fire-clay inspection pipe is carried up and capped at the sidewalk\r\nlevel with a cast-iron box having a locked cover. From this inspection\r\npipe a branch is connected to a cast-iron fresh-air inlet, in most cases\r\nset in the wall of the house, the inlet being 30 cm. above the level of\r\nthe pavement.\r\n\r\n_Effect of the Flood on Sewers._--The flood of August 27th and 28th, 1909,\r\npartly destroyed one of the main collectors, which was laid along the\r\nbanks of the river and encased in concrete. This has now been relaid\r\nfarther north, and out of the way of any future floods. The total length\r\nof the new sewers replacing those damaged amounts to 1200 m., and they\r\nvary in internal diameter from 20 to 55.9 cm. (8 to 22 in.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MAIN OUTFALL SEWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe direction of the main outfall sewer was determined after a thorough\r\nstudy of all the available land lying to the north and northeast of the\r\ncity, as it was the intention of the Company to utilize for irrigation\r\npurposes the sewage and any surplus waters that might be developed. The\r\nbest available site was found to be about 12 km. north of the city, a\r\nlittle northwest of the village of San Nicolas de los Garzas, as shown on\r\nPlate II. The long length of outfall required was justified by the cheap\r\ncost of the land and its excellent character for sewage irrigation. The\r\nsewer was designed for a capacity of 90,000,000 liters a day (36.76 cu.\r\nft. per sec.) in order to allow for conveying surplus waters as well as\r\nsewage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII.--OUTFALL SEWER: PLAN OF GROUND SHOWING SEWER;\r\nALSO DETAILS OF VARIOUS SECTIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe outfall intercepts the two main branches of the city sewers at Calle\r\nde Allende and Calle de Tapia, and its total length is approximately\r\n11,900 m. The chief type adopted is shown on Plate XXII. It is formed\r\nwith an invert of radial bricks laid in 1:2 cement mortar, on a foundation\r\nof 1:3:5 concrete approximately 7 cm. thick. As the ground was chiefly in\r\nhard sillar, only a little concrete was required to mould the bottom to\r\nthe correct shape. The arch was formed of special radial bricks, 15 cm. (6\r\nin.) deep, laid in cement mortar. These bricks were adopted in preference\r\nto concrete, owing to the heavy cost of sand and rock, due to the long\r\nhaul, and for the purpose of obtaining rapid work. Plate XXI shows the\r\nsewer arch, and one of the ventilating columns and manholes. The bricks\r\nwere obtained from the local brick plant, and form a very satisfactory\r\nmaterial for sewers, being well burnt, thoroughly hard, and absorbing not\r\nmore than 7-1/2% of their weight of water. The contract prices for the\r\nlabor on the brickwork were 1.25 pesos per sq. m., and 1.38 pesos for the\r\narch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI, FIG. 1.--VIEW OF ARCH, OUTFALL SEWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI, FIG. 2.--VENTILATING COLUMN AND MANHOLE, OUTFALL\r\nSEWER.]\r\n\r\nThe general route of the sewer is very direct, long straight lines of\r\nseveral kilometers being possible, and these were joined by curves of\r\napproximately 30 m. radius. The gradient of the sewer invert is 0.2% (1 in\r\n500) which is approximately the general fall of the ground northward from\r\nMonterrey.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of excavation was as follows:\r\n\r\n                 No. 1, soft earth          8,960 cu. m.\r\n                 No. 2, sillar             18,492  \"  \"\r\n                 No. 3, conglomerate rock   9,822  \"  \"\r\n                                           ------\r\n                 Total                     37,274 cu. m.\r\n\r\nThe contract prices for this excavation were: for No. 1, 32 cents; No. 2,\r\n85 cents; and No. 3, 2.17 pesos per cu. m.\r\n\r\nAll the excavation was in perfectly dry ground. Where the sewer was partly\r\nout of the ground it had a foundation of concrete, 1.75 m. wide, from 15\r\nto 23 cm. thick, below the bottom of the brickwork, and carried up to the\r\nspringing of the arch, and a well-tamped embankment, with slopes of 1-1/2\r\nto 1, to protect the sewer to a height of 30 cm. (12 in.) above the arch.\r\nFor 342 m. at the Monterrey end of the line, the sewer was constructed in\r\ntunnel, from, the open end and from two intermediate shafts. The tunnel\r\nthroughout was in sillar, and the contract price for excavation was 24.50\r\npesos per lin. m. This work was done without timbering of any kind, except\r\nat the shaft lengths. Plate XXII shows the lining of the tunnel, which\r\nwas of concrete with a brick invert. At four places the sewer passes under\r\nmain railway tracks, which at these points were carried on steel girders\r\nsupported on concrete abutments, the sewer being carried under the tracks\r\nin the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n_Bridges._--At three points the sewer was carried over arroyos on\r\nreinforced concrete girders. No. 1, at Station 5,600, consisted of four\r\n10-m. spans; No. 2, at Station 8,365, over the Estanscia Arroyo, consisted\r\nof nine 10-m. spans; and No. 3, at Station 8,960, over the Topo Chico\r\nArroyo, consisted of three 10-m. spans. One of these bridges is shown on\r\nPlate XXIII. They were designed as two parallel continuous girders with\r\nconnecting top and bottom slabs. The concrete for the girders was a\r\n1:2-1/2:3-1/2 mixture, the sand being from the crusher and the rock gauged\r\nto pass a 19-mm. (3/4-in.) screen. The inside was rendered with a coat of\r\n1:1 cement mortar, 7 mm. thick, for water-tightness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII, FIG. 1.--FORMS FOR MAIN GIRDERS, ESTANSCIA\r\nBRIDGE, OUTFALL SEWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII, FIG. 2.--VIEW OF ESTANSCIA BRIDGE, COMPLETED.]\r\n\r\nThe piers of the Estanscia Bridge (Plate XXIII) were carried down through\r\nsoft earth to a stiff clay from 4-1/2 to 6 m. below the surface, and the\r\nfoundations were spread so that the pressure would not exceed 1 ton per\r\nsq. ft. The ends of the bridges were protected by rubble wing-walls\r\nsupporting the embankment over the sewer. A 1:3:5 concrete was used for\r\nthe upper part of the piers, and the lower part was of the same mixture\r\nwith 30% of large boulders. There are 70 manholes (Fig. 19) along the line\r\nof the sewer, and they vary from 150 to 230 m. apart. The sewer is\r\nventilated with 30 concrete towers (Fig. 18, and Fig. 2, Plate XXI), 2.9\r\nm. high, having 20-cm. (8-in.) shafts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--DETAILS OF VENTILATORS ON OUTFALL SEWER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--DETAILS OF MANHOLES ON OUTFALL SEWER.]\r\n\r\nThe works for the outfall sewer were carried out satisfactorily under a\r\ncontract with Mr. John Phillips, of Mexico City, the Company supplying the\r\ngreater part of the materials. The work was begun on March 16th, and\r\nfinished on November 12th, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                SEWAGE DISPOSAL WORKS AND IRRIGATION LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of disposing of the sewage and using it profitably, the\r\nCompany purchased 909 hectares (2,246 acres) of land from the Community of\r\nSan Nicolas de los Garzas, the outfall sewer being carried to the\r\nsouthwestern boundary of the land acquired. This area has a general fall\r\nin all directions to the northeastern boundary, with a gradual fall of\r\nabout 25 m. across the diagonal of the land. The area purchased was\r\npractically virgin land, only small portions having been cultivated. The\r\ngreater part was covered with a growth of mezquite trees and small shrubs.\r\nThe quality of the land is excellent, if properly irrigated, and capable\r\nof yielding abundant crops of every description. The limits of this land\r\nare shown on Plate II.\r\n\r\n_Sewage Purification Tanks._--For the purpose of obtaining a satisfactory\r\neffluent to discharge on the land without causing nuisance, the Company\r\nbuilt a system of detritus chambers and liquefying tanks at the end of the\r\noutfall sewer. One difficulty to be faced, in designing these works, was\r\nthe fact that there were no data regarding the probable quantity of\r\ndry-weather sewage, nor any particulars as to its general character;\r\nthere was also the probability that the outfall sewer would have to carry\r\nlarge quantities of surplus water. Therefore, the system was designed so\r\nas to be capable of extension if necessary, and the sizes of the various\r\ntanks were limited at present, because of the septic processes which would\r\nbe set up in the long length of outfall sewer. The tanks were designed to\r\ndeal with 10,000,000 liters of sewage proper per day, and the channels,\r\netc., were proportioned to take the full flow of the sewer if necessary.\r\nProvision was also made for discharging large volumes of surplus water\r\ndirectly on the land, independent of the tanks. To do this a by-pass was\r\ntaken from the sewer a short distance before reaching the site of the\r\ntanks. By properly timing the flow, arrangements could be made to\r\ndischarge these waters in the early hours of the morning, by allowing the\r\nscour-pipes in the distribution system to be opened at night when the\r\ndomestic sewage flow was at its minimum. As the area of land available is\r\nvery great, the degree of purification in the tanks was relatively\r\nunimportant; the object to be obtained consisted chiefly in distributing\r\non the land an effluent which would be innocuous and clear.\r\n\r\nThe general design of the works is shown on Plate XXIV, and they consist\r\nessentially of a screen chamber, duplicate detritus tanks, and three\r\nliquefying tanks. There is also a sludge-pit 629 m. from the tanks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV.--SEWAGE DISPOSAL WORKS AT SAN NICOLAS DE LOS\r\nGARZAS; GENERAL PLAN OF DETRITUS AND LIQUEFYING TANKS, WITH DETAILS OF THE\r\nLATTER.]\r\n\r\n_Screen Chamber and Detritus Tanks._--Enlarged details of the screen\r\nchamber are shown on Plate XXV. The invert, where the sewer enters the\r\nscreen chamber, is 489.45 m. above datum. This chamber has duplicate\r\nscreens which are fully detailed on Plate XXX. For cleaning purposes the\r\nscreens are raised by a steel-framed head-gear, which is arranged so that\r\nthey may be lowered to a small traveling bogie, out of the way of the\r\nscreen chamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV.--SEWAGE DISPOSAL WORKS AT SAN NICOLAS DE LOS\r\nGARZAS. DETAILS OF DETRITUS CHAMBERS AND INLET CHANNELS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVI.--SEWAGE DISPOSAL WORKS AT SAN NICOLAS DE LOS\r\nGARZAS DETRITUS AND LIQUEFYING TANKS; DETAILS OF DISTRIBUTING CHANNELS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXX.--SEWAGE DISPOSAL WORKS AT SAN NICOLAS DE LOS\r\nGARZAS. DETAILS OF SCREENING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nFrom the screen chamber there are two main channels, 1.22 m. wide,\r\nbranching to the two concrete detritus chambers. Each channel has a square\r\npenstock, so that the sewage can be diverted into either chamber when\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe detritus chambers are octagonal in plan, 4 m. in diameter, and each is\r\nprovided with an outlet weir 1.50 m. wide. At the weir level the chambers\r\nhave a depth of 1.75 m., with drainage channels below that level. The\r\ncoping is 1 m. above the outlet weir of the detritus tanks. To drain off\r\nthese chambers, each has a scour-out pipe, 30 cm. in diameter, controlled\r\nfrom valves with spindles carried above the coping level. Each of these\r\npipes is connected to a central chamber, and leads to a 56-cm. (22-in.)\r\nsludge-pipe. The chambers as designed are of smaller capacity than those\r\nusually provided, but, as all surface water is strictly excluded from the\r\nsewerage system, the quantity of detritus reaching the chambers may be\r\nsmall. The velocity through them when both are in use will be\r\napproximately 0.082 m. (0.27 ft.) per sec.\r\n\r\nFrom these chambers the sewage is carried to the three liquefying tanks by\r\na main channel, 11.5 m. long and 1.50 m. wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII, FIG. 1.--CAST CONCRETE BEAMS BEING PLACED IN\r\nPOSITION, LIQUEFYING TANKS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII, FIG. 2.--INLET WEIRS TO LIQUEFYING TANKS,\r\nDURING CONSTRUCTION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII, FIG. 1.--VIEW OF LIQUEFYING TANKS, FROM INLET\r\nEND.]\r\n\r\nThe tanks are of concrete and have reinforced concrete roofs. Each is 66\r\nm. long and 6 m. wide; the minimum depth for the sewage is 1.50 m. at the\r\noutlet end, and 2.25 m. at the inlet, increasing to a maximum depth of\r\n2.75 m. at the lowest depth at the scour-out channel. Their combined\r\ncapacity is 2,500,000 liters, which is equivalent to 6 hours' flow of the\r\nquantity of sewage for which they were designed. The sewage passes from\r\nthe main channel, through penstock-valves which control the flow, into one\r\nor the other of the tanks. From these valve openings it flows over\r\nconcrete weirs, 5 m. long, and is deflected to the bottom of the tank by a\r\nreinforced concrete scum-plate, extending across each tank, with a\r\nclearance of 15 cm. at each end. This scum-plate is 1.5 m. deep and 10 cm.\r\nthick, and is placed 40 cm. from the end walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIX.--SEWAGE DISPOSAL WORKS AT SAN NICOLAS DE LOS\r\nGARZAS; DETAILS OF OUTLET CHANNELS AND WEIR BOX.]\r\n\r\nThe details of the concrete division and outside walls are shown on Plate\r\nXXIX. The floor was constructed in two layers, and its surface is divided\r\ninto 6 channels formed by small walls, 20 cm. wide and 15 cm. deep, the\r\nobject of these channels being to facilitate the cleaning of the floor by\r\nscouring it out to a specially arranged channel at the deepest point of\r\nthe tank, near the inlet end. Each scour-out channel has a 30-cm. (12-in.)\r\ngate-valve, controlled from the roof of the tank, the three scour-pipes\r\nmeeting in a concrete chamber outside of the tanks, from which a 56-cm.\r\n(22-in.) concrete pipe discharges the contents of the tanks to the\r\nsludge-pit during cleaning operations. The velocity through the tanks,\r\nwhen they are used in combination, is 0.0253 m. (0.083 ft.) per sec., the\r\ntanks being made as long as economically possible, in order to obtain this\r\nlow velocity and thus permit the proper sedimentation of the suspended\r\nmatters. The roof of each tank is 1 m. above the weir level. Each tank has\r\nfour ventilating columns, 3.7 m. high and 30 cm. in diameter, vitrified\r\nclay pipes, with an exterior casing of contrete, being used for the\r\nshafts. The roof is enclosed within parapet walls, and is covered with a\r\nlayer of earth 25 cm. thick.\r\n\r\nThe outlet channel from the tanks leads to a measuring chamber, 3 m.\r\nsquare, as shown on Plate XXIX. This chamber is fitted with penstocks,\r\n1.83 m. wide, and measuring weirs. From this chamber the sewage is\r\ndelivered to two main irrigation ditches, which distribute the sewage in\r\ntwo directions, one northward and the other to the western extremity of\r\nthe lands.\r\n\r\n_Construction of Tanks._--The excavation for the tanks was in soft earth\r\nfor a depth of 1-1/2 m.; the lower depths were in a firm foundation of\r\nsillar and calcareous clay. The total excavation in the tanks, channels,\r\netc., was 8,335 cu. m., and the actual cost was 45-3/4 cents per cu. m. To\r\nfacilitate the construction, about six-tenths of the concrete beams were\r\ncast as single monoliths and placed in position by sliding them across the\r\ntanks on temporary timbers. The remainder of the beams, the roof, and the\r\nslab were placed in position in the ordinary way with timber forms. The\r\ntotal quantity of concrete placed was 1,360 cu. m. A 1:2-1/2:4-1/2\r\nconcrete was used for the walls, channels, etc., and a 1:2:3 mixture for\r\nthe roof slab and beams.\r\n\r\nTable 14 gives the average cost per cubic meter for all the concrete work.\r\n\r\n    TABLE 14.--AVERAGE COST PER CUBIC METER FOR CONCRETE IN TANKS.\r\n\r\n   +-----------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n   |                                         | Pesos per | Pesos per |\r\n   |                                         | cubic     | cubic     |\r\n   |                                         | meter.    | meter.    |\r\n   +-----------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n   | LABOR :                                 |           |           |\r\n   |  Mixing and placing                     |  5.20     |           |\r\n   |  Carpenter work in forms, framing, etc. |  4.20     |           |\r\n   |                                         |  _____    |           |\r\n   | Total labor cost                        |           |  9.40     |\r\n   |                                         |           |           |\r\n   | MATERIALS :                             |           |           |\r\n   | Screened gravel                         |  4.04     |           |\r\n   | Sand (from neighboring arroyo)          |  4.98     |           |\r\n   | Cement (including hauling)              | 15.19     |           |\r\n   | Lumber, nails, and other supplies       |  1.90     | 26.11     |\r\n   +-----------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n   | Total cost of concrete per cubic meter                35.51     |\r\n   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n_Sludge-pit._--The sludge-pit, used when cleaning out the tanks, is\r\ncarried 639 m. northward, far enough to get the available fall to drain\r\nthe bottom of the detritus chambers and liquefying tanks. The drainage\r\npipe was formed of 56-cm. (22-in.) concrete tubes. The sludge-pit is\r\nmerely an excavation in the earth 20 m. square and 2 m. deep, the sides\r\nhaving a slope of 1-1/2 to 1. An overflow drains the pit to an irrigation\r\nditch, the solid matter being allowed to settle and the liquid to drain\r\noff. From time to time it is proposed to dig out the solids and plow them\r\ninto the land.\r\n\r\n_General._--To the east of the tanks a 3-roomed house has been built for\r\nthe inspector.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide a good supply of water for cleaning operations, a well\r\n22 m. deep has been sunk and is fitted with pumps operated by an Eclipse\r\nwindmill, 4 m. in diameter, on a tower 22 m. high, which delivers the pump\r\nwater to a circular wooden tank of 20,000 liters capacity.\r\n\r\nThe work in connection with the purification tanks was carried out by the\r\nCompany's own staff; it was begun on September 10th, 1908, and practically\r\ncompleted by the first week in January, 1909.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing, the tanks have to deal with the sewage from a\r\npopulation of only 10,000 persons, as only from 15 to 20% of the\r\nconnections have been made. The sewage, therefore, has been diluted with\r\nseveral times its volume of surplus water, and the necessary scum on the\r\ntop of the sewage in the tanks has not yet assumed the usual thick matty\r\ncondition observed in most systems. As there are no available means in\r\nMonterrey of having proper determinations made of the degree of\r\npurification which takes place in the passage of the sewage through the\r\nliquefying tanks, a few simple tests have been made. These tests were\r\nlimited to the determination of the amount of oxygen absorbed in 4 hours,\r\nand show a purification of 50% in passing from the detritus chambers to\r\nthe outlet. The sewage, although very black and full of suspended matter\r\nas it enters the tanks, leaves them in a very clarified condition.\r\n\r\nOf the total area of land acquired by the Company, 904 hectares (2,234\r\nacres) have been leased to the Monterrey Railway, Light, and Power\r\nCompany, for 99 years, the Water-Works Company reserving 5 hectares (12\r\nacres) absolutely for future extensions of the sewage works. By giving 12\r\nmonths' notice, the Company also reserves the right to utilize any part of\r\n145 hectares (358 acres) near the tanks, should it be required at any time\r\nin the future for sewage purification purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    QUALITY OF AND RATES FOR LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the work was practically under the direction of English-speaking\r\nsuperintendents and general foremen. For the ordinary skilled and\r\nlow-skilled labor, Mexicans were employed exclusively, and, on the work,\r\nwhich was quite new to them, they proved entirely efficient and\r\nsatisfactory; throughout the work, on which at some periods between 2,000\r\nand 3,000 men were employed, chiefly under the Company's direct\r\nadministration, they were very tractable and willing to do their best, and\r\nno trouble was experienced at any time. The Mexican \"peon,\" and also the\r\nordinary skilled workman in the north of Mexico, is intelligent, and is\r\nexcellent for purely routine work, but he is not adaptable or resourceful\r\nin cases of emergency. Under intelligent and careful supervision, however,\r\nit is quite possible to get as good results as could be obtained anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe daily rates of wages for a 10-hour day were approximately as given in\r\nTable 15, these rates being varied in special cases.\r\n\r\n                       TABLE 15.--RATES OF WAGES\r\n\r\n      +-----------------------------------+-------------------+\r\n      |                                   | Pesos per day.    |\r\n      +-----------------------------------+-------------------+\r\n      | General foreman                   |  8.00  to 10.00   |\r\n      | Foreman                           |  6.00  \"   8.00   |\r\n      | Cabos                             |  2.00  \"   4.00   |\r\n      | Masons                            |  3.00  \"   4.00   |\r\n      | Bricklayers                       |  3.00  \"   4.00   |\r\n      | Masons and bricklayers helpers    |       1.50        |\r\n      | Cast-iron pipe jointers (foreman) |       4.50        |\r\n      |  \"   \" caulkers                   |       3.00        |\r\n      |  \"   \" helpers                    |  1.50  to  2.00   |\r\n      | Fire-clay pipe layers             |       1.75        |\r\n      |  \"   \" helpers                    |  1.25  to  1.50   |\r\n      | Drillers                          |  1.25  \"   1.50   |\r\n      | Carpenters                        |  2.00  \"   2.50   |\r\n      | Blacksmiths                       |       2.50        |\r\n      | Crane men                         |       6.00        |\r\n      | Peons (laborers)                  |  1.00  to  1.25   |\r\n      | Boys (watering concrete)          |  0.37-1/2 to 0.50 |\r\n      | Watchman                          |       1.00        |\r\n      | Timekeepers                       |  22.00 per week.  |\r\n      +-----------------------------------+-------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             COST OF WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 16 gives the main items of the approximate expenditure.

Fig. 20 shows in\r\ngraphic form the amount of the labor pay-rolls and the progress of the\r\nwork during the whole construction period from 1906 to 1909, inclusive,\r\ncomprising also that done under contract.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--PROGRESS DIAGRAM SHOWING MONTHLY LABOR PAY-ROLLS\r\nDURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TARIFFS AND SANITARY REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tariffs._--The tariffs charged for the water and drainage service (Table\r\n17) were approved by the State Government (which accepts the\r\nresponsibility for their collection), under a compulsory State law which\r\ncame into force on March 1st, 1910, for the southern portion of the city,\r\nand on July 1st, for the northern half, the penalty for non-compliance\r\nbeing a tax of 10% on the monthly rental value of the property, as\r\nassessed by the State officials.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the tariffs (which were published on February 22d, 1909) is a\r\ncharge for water varying between 12 and 16 cents (Mexican) per 1,000\r\nliters, with a minimum monthly rate for each different class of property\r\nconnected to the system. The rate for house drainage is fixed at 80% of\r\nthe minimum water rate levied on the consumer. The minimum rates have been\r\nfixed so that the poorer classes of the community will not be overtaxed,\r\nwhile at the same time the rate is actually levied on the quantity of\r\nwater used, as indicated by the meter. All the services at the present\r\ntime are metered, and the meter system will be used throughout.\r\n\r\n                        TABLE 17.--THE TARIFFS.\r\n\r\n  +-----+------------+---------+-----------+---------+----------+--------+\r\n  |     | Monthly    | Liters  | Price for | Minimum | Rate for | Total  |\r\n  |Class| property   |   of    | 1,000     | monthly | drainage | rate   |\r\n  |     | rental.    |  water  | liters.   | rate.   | service. |payable.|\r\n  |     | Pesos.     | allowed.| Cents.    | Pesos.  | Pesos.   | Pesos. |\r\n  +-----+------------+---------+-----------+---------+----------+--------+\r\n  |   I | Up to 20   |  7,800  |   16      | 1.25    |   1.09   |  2.25  |\r\n  |  II | 21 to 40   | 12,500  |   16      | 2.00    |   1.60   |  3.60  |\r\n  | III | 41 to 60   | 18,750  |   16      | 3.00    |   2.40   |  5.40  |\r\n  |  IV | 61 to 120  | 23,350  |   15      | 3.50    |   2.80   |  6.30  |\r\n  |   V | 121 to 300 | 30,000  |   15      | 4.50    |   3.60   |  8.10  |\r\n  |  VI | 301 upward | 33,350  |   15      | 5.00    |   4.00   |  9.00  |\r\n  +-----+------------+---------+-----------+---------+----------+--------+\r\n\r\n    \"Notes: (1st) The rental for the water meters 5/8-in. size\r\n    (15-1/2 mm.), which shall always be considered the property\r\n    of the Company, will be 20 cents per month.

SCHUYLER, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--For completeness of\r\ndetail and wide range of subjects of general interest to engineers, this\r\npaper is certainly one of the notable contributions to recent engineering\r\nliterature. It is a minute and painstaking record of the successful\r\naccomplishment of construction work under unusual climatic conditions and\r\ndifficult circumstances, and reflects credit on the author, not only in\r\nhis capacity as an engineer, but as a faithful recorder of facts. It was\r\nparticularly fortunate that he was an eyewitness of the disastrous and\r\nextraordinary flood which swept through Monterrey, destroying many lives\r\nand much property, and has thus been able to give an intelligent estimate\r\nof the maximum discharge of the river during the height of the flood wave\r\nof August 27th-28th, 1909, when the rate of run-off per unit of area of\r\nwater-shed drained reached an amount which has seldom been equalled or\r\nexceeded, as far as reliable records extend. It is worthy of note that\r\nworks deriving their water supply from the source of such torrential\r\nfloods should have survived with so little actual damage, and with\r\nscarcely any interruption of service. The repair of all damages to the\r\nsystem was estimated to have cost not more than $20,000.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Conway did not assume charge of construction until May, 1907, he\r\nwas spared the responsibility of deciding on the general plan of securing\r\nan abundant supply of pure water from sources permitting of delivery by\r\ngravity under adequate pressure for fire protection--a responsibility\r\nwhich devolved on the writer, assisted by G. S. Binckley, M. Am. Soc. C.\r\nE., Mr. Conway's predecessor, as Chief Engineer. Not only the water-works,\r\nbut the system of sewerage and sewage disposal by broad irrigation were\r\nsubsequently carried out on the plans submitted to the State Government by\r\nthe writer in 1906, and given provisional acquiescence at that time.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of water at hand for the supply of a city of that size,\r\nas there are large perennial springs which flow out of the travertine of\r\nthe plain, and are used for irrigation in the valley below the city. One\r\nof the largest of these, near the civic center, has a normal flow of\r\nnearly 30 cu. ft. per sec.; another nearby, also within the city limits,\r\nflows some 10 or 12 sec-ft., while both the Estanscia and Robalar springs,\r\nbut a few miles below (shown on Plate II), discharge more than 20 sec-ft.,\r\nas nearly as memory serves. Besides this supply, the water to be developed\r\nby sinking shafts in certain parts of the plain, as demonstrated at the\r\nbrewery and elsewhere, was apparently a reliable source of large volume.\r\n\r\nTo utilize these sources, however, would have involved condemnation of the\r\nwater-rights in the case of the springs, depriving present owners of the\r\nuse of the water, and this Governor Reyes wished to avoid. Besides, it\r\nwould have necessitated pumping the water for the city in perpetuity, an\r\nexpense which the Governor was equally anxious to save; hence a gravity\r\nsupply was made the prime requisite of the plans.\r\n\r\nUntil the concession was granted, and for a year or more afterward, it was\r\nassumed that an adequate supply could only be obtained by the storage of\r\nthe flood-water of the Santa Catarina River in a large reservoir; and the\r\nearlier plans of the concessionaires were based on the construction of a\r\nhigh masonry storage dam at the upper end of the \"narrows,\" where the\r\nriver turns from a western direction to a course almost due east, between\r\nhigh vertical cliffs of limestone. The concession distinctly provided for\r\nsuch a dam, and among the plans on file in the State Capitol is one\r\nprepared by the late E. Sherman Gould, M. Am. Soc. C. E., for a masonry\r\nweir across the gorge. Samuel M. Gray, M. Am. Soc. C. E., also filed a\r\nplan and report proposing a capacious, shallow, storage reservoir near the\r\ncity, to be filled by a large flood-water canal from the Santa Catarina\r\nCanon.\r\n\r\nAlthough the writer could not have anticipated the occurrence of floods of\r\nthe magnitude of the one of August, 1909, which would surely have\r\ndestroyed any reservoir built in the Canon, he was unable to endorse the\r\nstorage plan of water development, chiefly because of the uncertainty of\r\nthe water-tightness of the reservoir in a cavernous limestone formation,\r\nand also because of the probable impurity of water draining from such\r\nextensive goat pastures. He, therefore, urged the development of the\r\nunderflow of the river, which was manifesting itself in the springs\r\nreferred to. Mr. Binckley secured two Keystone drilling machines and\r\nproceeded to profile the bed-rock at Santa Catarina Canon and at San\r\nGeronimo, the two places on the stream where the river flows between walls\r\nof rock _in situ_. At both sites the strata were standing nearly vertical\r\nacross the channel, and, by careful sampling and testing, it was found\r\nthat in both locations there were thick strata of limestone so highly\r\nsilicious as to be insoluble, and hence free from caverns. From this\r\ndetermination it was concluded that all the water which appeared in the\r\nvalley below must pass through the sections where the borings were made.\r\nThe results of this drilling, however, proved conclusively that the depth\r\nto bed-rock at either place was too great to permit of a masonry dam being\r\nconsidered as practical, and demonstrated the inadequacy of methods which\r\nhad been used in the earlier investigations when dams were regarded as\r\nfeasible.\r\n\r\nThe results have also shown that the subterranean supply at the lower\r\ncross-section of the river, at San Geronimo, is abundant, and can probably\r\nbe increased to an indefinite degree by continuing the filtration gallery;\r\nwhile at Santa Catarina the same type of development can be made for a\r\nhigh-source supply, although requiring a long and expensive tunnel and\r\nconduit.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID T. PITKETHLY, ASSOC. M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--Having been\r\nengaged on the design of sewerage systems for some years, the writer finds\r\nthis paper of peculiar interest, particularly the sewerage portion. There\r\nare some points in the design, however, which do not appear to be clear.\r\n\r\nThe system is described as \"strictly separate,\" and yet the sewers are\r\ndesigned to run half-full, providing a capacity of 200%, the 100% basis,\r\nor 380 liters per capita, being 90%, or 180 liters, in excess of the\r\ncalculated water supply of 200 liters per capita.\r\n\r\nIt has been the writer's practice to design sanitary sewer systems on the\r\nbasis of the water consumption, and to assume the whole daily amount to\r\nreach the sewer in 16 hours, thus providing capacity sufficient to care\r\nfor the maximum or wash-day flow without causing the sewers to run above\r\nthe calculated hydraulic gradient, which should be placed within the pipe\r\nso as to provide air space for ventilation under all circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe practice of calculating sanitary sewers to run half-full is a good one\r\nwhen ground-water is expected in sufficient amount to fill the remaining\r\nportion of the sewer, but when no ground-water, or roof-, or surface-water\r\nis allowed to enter the system, or all precautions are taken to exclude\r\nsuch, then the system may be designed so that the expected maximum, or\r\nwash-day flow, will fill the sewer to the desired hydraulic gradient.\r\n\r\nThe method of ventilating the sewers does not seem practicable. The houses\r\nare principally of one story, and yet the stand-pipes on the sewers have\r\nopenings 25 ft. 9 in. above the sidewalk. Are the ventilating or vent\r\npipes of the house plumbing carried to a height to balance this, or will\r\nthese chimneys draw the air from the house drains and fresh-air pipes,\r\nbreaking the seal in the so-called disconnecting traps, thus causing the\r\ncirculation of air in the house piping to be downward through the sewers\r\ninstead of upward through the fresh-air inlets and vents, as designed?\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that crude sewage, as well as the liquefying\r\n(septic) tank effluent, is to be applied to land for irrigation purposes,\r\nbut the application of crude sewage without any attempt at removing the\r\nsuspended matter, or the effluent from the septic tanks where only a\r\npartial removal occurs, seems to be bad practice.\r\n\r\nThe author states that:\r\n\r\n\"The degree of purification in the tanks was relatively unimportant; the\r\nobject to be obtained consisted chiefly in distributing on the land an\r\neffluent which would be innocuous and clear.\"\r\n\r\nHow he expects to obtain such an effluent by passage through screens,\r\ndetritus tanks, and septic tanks only, is more than the writer can\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe removal of suspended matter in a septic tank depends on the strength\r\nof the sewage, the time of retention, the time elapsing between cleaning,\r\nthe presence of trade wastes, etc., and seldom exceeds 38 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe subject of septic tanks and their effect on sewage is discussed in the\r\n\"Fifth Report of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal\" (England, 1908),\r\nand the following extracts, relative to the application of crude sewage to\r\nland and the effect of septic tanks on sewage, seem apropos:\r\n\r\n    \"23. * * * There are also many cases in which crude sewage has\r\n    been passed over land, but the evidence shows that land treatment\r\n    of crude sewage is liable to give rise to nuisance by the\r\n    accumulation of solids on the surface of the land. Moreover, in\r\n    some cases these solids are apt to form an impervious layer,\r\n    which interferes with the aeration of the soil, and so impairs\r\n    the efficiency of the treatment.\"\r\n\r\n    \"31. * * * At that time it was claimed that the septic tank\r\n    possessed the following, among other, advantages:\r\n\r\n    \"That it solved the sludge difficulty, inasmuch as practically all\r\n    the organic solid matter was digested in the tank.\r\n\r\n    \"That it destroyed any pathogenic organisms which there might be\r\n    in the sewage.\"\r\n\r\n    \"32. As regards the first of these claims, it is now clearly\r\n    established that, in practice, all the organic solids are not\r\n    digested by septic tanks, and that the actual amount of digestion\r\n    varies to some extent with the character of the sewage, the size\r\n    of the tanks relative to the volume treated, and the frequency of\r\n    cleansing.\"\r\n\r\n    \"At Huddersfield, Mr. Campbell estimated that about 38 per cent.\r\n    of the solids were converted into gas or digested; * * * while at\r\n    Birmingham, Messrs. Watson and O'Shaughnessy say that the figures\r\n    available indicated a digestion of not more than 10 per cent. of\r\n    the suspended matter entering the tanks.\"\r\n\r\n    \"33. As regards the second claim, we find as a result of a very\r\n    large number of observations that the sewage issuing from the\r\n    septic tanks is, bacteriologically, almost as impure as the sewage\r\n    entering the tanks.\"\r\n\r\nMessrs. Winslow and Phelps, in their interesting paper, \"Investigations on\r\nthe Purification of Boston Sewage,\"[8] quote a suggestion made by\r\nStoddart (1905):\r\n\r\n[8] Water Supply and Irrigation Paper No. 185, p. 125.\r\n\r\n    \"He finds, in a septic tank of several compartments, a\r\n    considerable deposit of sludge in the first compartment, giving\r\n    a fairly clear supernatant liquid, which in the last chamber of\r\n    all undergoes a secondary decomposition, leading to the\r\n    throwing down of an additional precipitate of offensive\r\n    sludge.\"\r\n\r\nWhat took place in the case referred to by Stoddart corresponds to the\r\nauthor's observations of the liquid leaving the tanks in a clarified\r\ncondition, but the secondary decomposition must take place in some manner,\r\nand, when it does, a nuisance seems to be unavoidable where no provision\r\nis made to care for it.\r\n\r\nIn view of the experience of others, some further treatment seems to be\r\nnecessary. Such treatment should include disinfection, as no method of\r\ndisposal yet devised has succeeded in reducing materially the pathogenic\r\ngerms usually to be found in sewage and tank effluents.\r\n\r\nIf the crops to be irrigated are to be eaten, uncooked, by mankind, then\r\ndisinfection at least is imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE S. BINCKLEY, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--Mr. Conway's admirable\r\npaper is of special interest to the writer, as the entire general design\r\nof the system, as well as the extensive hydrological studies and final\r\nselection of the sources of water supply, was completed during 1906\r\nthrough the joint labors of the writer, as Chief Engineer, and James D.\r\nSchuyler, M. Am. Soc. C. E., as Consulting Engineer.\r\n\r\nIn this work, Mr. Schuyler and the writer had the rare privilege of\r\ndealing from its inception with the problem of designing a complete and\r\nsomewhat extensive system of municipal water supply and drainage,\r\nunhampered by any existing works to which the new systems would have to be\r\nadapted. It would probably be difficult to find in the United States a\r\ncity of 85,000 inhabitants, previously totally lacking either a water\r\nsupply or sewerage system, which, under a consistent and harmonious\r\ndesign, has been provided with both in the degree of completeness and\r\nstructural excellence exemplified in the works at Monterrey.\r\n\r\nThe few important changes or amplifications made in the original design,\r\nand the manner in which its detail has been executed is naturally most\r\ninteresting to the writer, and this excellent paper should be of very\r\nsubstantial value, particularly to engineers engaged on similar work in\r\nMexico or Spanish America.\r\n\r\nThe very novel construction method adopted by Mr. Conway in the roofing of\r\nthe South or Guadalupe Reservoir, seems to the writer rather to invite\r\ncriticism, and the fact that in the subsequent construction of the roof\r\nover the rectangular Obispado Reservoir the customary monolithic concrete\r\nconstruction was apparently reverted to after experience with the\r\nseparate-unit plan previously used, would indicate that Mr. Conway reached\r\nthe same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe original design of the circular Guadalupe Reservoir contemplated just\r\nabout the same arrangement of columns and roof support as that actually\r\nused, but the writer had expected that the columns would be cast in place,\r\nand that the system of primary and secondary beams would be filled at the\r\nsame time as, and integral with, the roof slab, the reinforcement being\r\nplaced in accordance with what may be described as conventional practice.\r\nThe writer believes that the efficiency of the concrete and steel placed\r\nin this manner would be notably higher than under the system actually\r\nadopted, which, in effect, is pretty much the same as constructing the\r\nsupporting system of units of cut stone. If, with all the elements of\r\nstructural weakness involved in the multiplicity of mortised joints,\r\ndiscontinuous reinforcement, etc., this construction is strong enough, it\r\nwould seem that an important reduction in the dimensions of the members\r\ncould have been effected by monolithic construction and continuous\r\nreinforcement, without sacrifice of strength.\r\n\r\nThe comparison, in Table 7, of the costs of these two reservoirs, is\r\ninteresting, but very moderately illuminating, as the comparative unit\r\ncost of the most important element in their construction--the concrete--is\r\nnot given. The total excavation cost for each reservoir is practically the\r\nsame, and the general expense, engineering, and cost of fittings and\r\naccessories presumably so, but the total cost of the Guadalupe Reservoir\r\nas given is $19,000 (pesos) in excess of that of the Obispado Reservoir,\r\nwhile, in the latter, there were 756 cu. m. more concrete. This certainly\r\nindicates a much higher cost of concrete per unit as laid in the South\r\n(Guadalupe) Reservoir. An actual comparison of the cost per unit of\r\nconcrete laid under the two systems would be instructive.\r\n\r\nThe writer is interested to observe that the same system of sub-drainage\r\nused by him in the construction of the reservoir for the provisional\r\nsupply of water from San Geronimo, has been used by the author in the\r\nObispado Reservoir. This arrangement of drains under the floor of the\r\nreservoir at San Geronimo was devised as a safeguard against damage to the\r\nlining through the accumulation of water inside the impervious bank\r\nagainst its back.\r\n\r\nIt was realized that, in such a climate as that of Monterrey, perfect\r\nwater-tightness of the lining might be difficult to secure or maintain,\r\nand, if leaks existed, a sudden draft on the contents of the reservoir\r\nmight result in serious damage through the static pressure exerted against\r\nthe lining of the sides or upward thrust against the floor. In the\r\nwriter's opinion, such a system of drains is an important element, as not\r\nalone the fact but the quantity of leakage may be determined, and danger\r\nof saturation of the supporting bank avoided--a matter of importance\r\nwhere, as is sometimes the case, the material of such a bank is unfit to\r\nresist the effects of saturation. The author does not state whether or not\r\nthis safeguard was omitted in the Guadalupe Reservoir. Incidentally,\r\nhowever, the matter of saturation of the bank is not important in either\r\nreservoir, as the material of which these banks are constructed is such\r\nthat settlement or failure through saturation is out of the question. It\r\nmay be remarked, however, that in fixing the angle of the sides of the\r\nGuadalupe Reservoir at 60 deg. the writer contemplated the same system of\r\nconstructing the bank as he used in that of the San Geronimo Reservoir. In\r\nthis case, the bank was built up by spreading the material in thin layers,\r\nwetting down, and rolling and puddling by the passage of the ox-carts used\r\nfor the transportation of the material, the wheels of the carts, and\r\nespecially the cloven hoofs of the animals, producing a most excellent\r\neffect. The inside slope was built up in this fashion to a much lower\r\nangle, and with a top width considerably in excess of the finished\r\ndimensions. The excess material was then picked off to the line, and\r\nexactly to the slope. Thus the finished slope presented a surface which\r\nwas compacted to a degree impossible to attain at or near the surface of\r\nthe bank as built, and presenting a support of the best possible character\r\nfor the concrete lining and coping.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. SAUCEDO, ASSOC. M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--The author's\r\ndescription of the water-works and sewerage of Monterrey, one of the most\r\nextensive schemes in Mexico, will be of general interest to engineers,\r\nespecially those engaged in hydraulic and sanitary problems. The writer,\r\nhaving been connected with the works for four years, knows the local\r\nconditions well, and presents herewith some complementary data on what he\r\nconsiders an important feature, the subject of floods, mentioned by the\r\nauthor on different occasions, especially as certain developments in the\r\nworks show the importance of such occurrences as a factor in designing.\r\n\r\nAbnormal rainfalls of long duration and high intensity are common in the\r\nsemi-arid region of Mexico. They come at irregular intervals, though\r\ntending to coincide with the early fall. The floods of August, 1909, were\r\na repetition of similar occurrences in the past; and, though there are no\r\nnumerical records of previous cases, local traditions and historical state\r\ndocuments describe them as having occurred since the foundation of the\r\ncity, at intervals of from 15 to 40 years. The graphic descriptions of the\r\nplaces flooded are in accord with the character of the floods of August,\r\n1909, and September, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe diagram, Fig. 21, is a record of the rainfall during the latter flood,\r\nand was plotted from intermittent readings of standard gauges. It\r\ndemonstrates that the intensity increased toward the mountains on the\r\nsouth, which form the tributary water-shed of the Santa Catarina River,\r\nshowing a difference of 10.54 in. between the city and the Estanzuela Dam,\r\nwhich is not quite 12 miles to the southeast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--RAINFALL DURING FLOODS OF SEPTEMBER 14TH-16TH,\r\n1910, IN MONTERREY.]\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the volume of discharge of the river at the time of maximum\r\nflood is only a reasonable conjecture which (without special reference to\r\naccuracy) aims to impress those who have not witnessed such occurrences\r\nwith the tremendous volume coming from barren steep surfaces previously\r\nsaturated.\r\n\r\nThe original computation, referred to by the author, was obtained from the\r\naverage of two different methods which gave results close to each other.\r\nIn one method the extent and nature of the water-shed were considered,\r\ntogether with the maximum period of precipitation that occurred,\r\nsufficient to gather a maximum volume of water in the river. In the other\r\nmethod the volume was derived from a cross-section of the wetted perimeter\r\nof the river at the time of maximum flow, in combination with velocity\r\napproximations obtained by using rough floats. This gave 271,500 cu. ft.\r\nper sec. The figure submitted by the author, 235,000 cu, ft. per sec., is\r\nin accord with the proposed formula[9] for impervious surfaces by C. E.\r\nGregory, M. Am. Soc. C. E. In the first and last methods, the intensity, a\r\ngoverning factor, is more or less of an assumption, and the\r\ncross-sectional method is also unreliable, as the river-bed was greatly\r\ndisturbed, due to the high velocity of the water, which deepens the\r\nchannel to a considerable extent at times of maximum flood, the gravels\r\nbeing redeposited during the period of subsidence. Such was the case\r\nduring the flood of September, 1910, when the depth of gravel above the\r\nroof of the San Geronimo Infiltration Gallery was diminished to such an\r\nextent that it was so inefficient as a filter for the flood as to permit\r\nthe percolation of turbid water into the underground supply.\r\n\r\n[9] _Transactions_.

E., Vol. LVIII. p. 458.\r\n\r\nDuring the floods of August, 1909, Shafts Nos. 2 and 3 were damaged beyond\r\nrepair, and sand and gravel, entering through them, blocked up the\r\ngallery to within about 150 ft. of Shaft No. 1. The interior timbering\r\nprobably collapsed, due to cavings and disturbance in the river-bed during\r\nthe period of maximum flood, but no explorations have been possible on\r\naccount of the great quantity of water still coming through (at present\r\nmore than 650 liters per sec.). For this reason the work of driving the\r\ngallery, as well as lining Shaft No. 1, has been suspended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII, FIG. 2.--VIEW OF SANTA CATARINA RIVER IN\r\nFLOOD, ON AUGUST 28TH, 1909.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXI, FIG. 1.--FLUSH-TANK CARRIED DOWN BY FLOOD OF\r\nAUGUST 27TH-28TH, 1909.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXI, FIG. 2.--VIEW SHOWING SCOURING EFFECT OF FLOOD\r\nON SAN GERONIMO AQUEDUCT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXII, FIG. 1.--VIEW OF SANTA CATARINA RIVER AFTER\r\nTHE FLOOD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXII, FIG. 2.--VIEW OF SANTA CATARINA RIVER FLOWING\r\nTHROUGH LOW-LYING STREETS, 8 DAYS AFTER THE FLOOD.]\r\n\r\nOn reaching the city, the flood of August, 1909, swept away two streets\r\nadjoining the river. These streets had been built on made ground, in what\r\nwas originally the river-bed. The sewers and water mains laid in them were\r\ndestroyed entirely, and some 460 ft. of the 24-in. cast-iron pipe, buried\r\nunder the river-bed at a depth of 8 ft., were carried away. In relaying\r\nthis portion of the main, and for protecting the remainder of it across\r\nthe river, it is now proposed to encase it in a solid rubble concrete\r\nblock, 8 ft. square, which will impart weight and stability against the\r\nscouring effect of floods.\r\n\r\nThe South Reservoir is circular in shape, with an interior diameter of\r\n165.68 ft. at the top, and is partly excavated in the ground and partly\r\ncompleted by an embankment of vast proportions (Fig. 10). Right after the\r\nflood of August, 1909, a wet spot appeared on the northeastern toe of the\r\nembankment, and it was supposed for some time that it was the effect of\r\nthe saturation produced by the preceding rains, but, as it persisted for\r\nseveral months, it was obvious that its origin was in the interior of the\r\nreservoir, which was emptied when the writer took charge of the work. The\r\nfirst inspection revealed a horizontal crack in the concrete lining, about\r\n310 ft. long and extending about 153 deg. around the circumference on the\r\nnorth side. Throughout its length it coincided with the line of cut and\r\nfill. Vertical cracks, coinciding with the panel points in the lining, had\r\nalso developed, and extended from the main horizontal crack to the roof.\r\nThe circumstances originating this development can be conjectured by\r\nconsidering the position of the main crack, its characteristic features,\r\nand the conditions that preceded its formation. The coincidence of the\r\ncrack with the joint of cut and fill, points to this line as a source of\r\ndanger. An examination showed, besides, that the fracture was clean and\r\nsharp, ranging in thickness from a hair line at the ends to 3/16 in. at\r\nthe center, and that its upper border projected over the lower one\r\nperceptibly, a proof that horizontal motion had taken place. The vertical\r\ncracks were a secondary effect, the consequence of the displacement\r\nimmediately after it was scoured. A fracture was discovered in the floor\r\nof the reservoir. It started at the center and branched out into two\r\ndiverging lines in a radial direction.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance of two abnormal rainfalls, giving 35 in. in 9 days, the\r\nprecipitation being concentrated in two periods, not far apart, of 42\r\nhours and 98 hours, respectively (Fig. 4), together with lack of provision\r\nfor shedding the water from the roof of the reservoir and from the\r\nsurrounding embankment, lead to the inference that the latter became\r\nsaturated, increasing thereby in weight and decreasing in stability,\r\nespecially in its steep inner face. A settlement and the consequent\r\nhorizontal displacement, under these conditions, was natural. The concrete\r\nlining, only 16 in. thick at that height, was not sufficient to sustain\r\nthe resulting strain, and the main fracture developed, permitting the\r\nstored-up water to leak into the bank. In time this seepage found its way\r\nunder the bottom of the reservoir, softening the ground and producing a\r\nslight settlement which caused the crack in the floor. Had under-drainage\r\nbeen provided, as at the Obispado Reservoir, the actual conditions would\r\nhave been noticed earlier. However, as the embankment is of vast\r\nproportions, stable in itself to sustain with a large margin of safety the\r\nweight of the stored-up water, there was no actual danger of failure,\r\nexcept for the fact that the material forming the structure, on account of\r\nits calcareous nature, is dissolved by water. Long exposure to this\r\ncondition would, in time, open passages in the embankment, and it is\r\ncertain that there would be cavings in its interior.\r\n\r\nThe necessary grouting has been done, and provision is being made for\r\nwater-proofing the interior of the reservoir and shedding the water from\r\nthe roof and from the embankment, thus relieving the structure of the\r\nconsequent strain.\r\n\r\nAnother place in the works where floods have had a damaging effect is the\r\nEstanzuela intake basin, which, when the dam was completed, was filled to\r\nthe overflow level in order to test its water-tightness. As this basin,\r\nwhen cleaned, was found to be slightly fissured on the north side, it was\r\ndecided to line it with concrete. As shown in Fig. 8, the lining does not\r\ncover its entire area, but only the central portion, leaving a strip on\r\neither side without protection. The flood of September, 1910, coming in\r\ngreater volume than the previous ones of August, 1909, in passing through\r\nthe narrow gorge at the entrance, undermined the lining in those places\r\nwhere it was not founded on solid rock. Figs. 1, 2, and 3, Plate XXXIII,\r\nshow some of the damage caused by this flood. The buoyant effect of the\r\nwater and the impact of large rolling boulders caused fractures all over\r\nthe surface, and lifted the concrete lining bodily; but the dam proper,\r\nbeing founded on rock bottom, did not suffer any injury. In the future, in\r\norder to avoid the seepage of the ordinary supply, alluded to by the\r\nauthor, the water will be carried to the valve-house in an open rubble\r\nconcrete channel, lined with cement mortar and built high up against the\r\nwestern hillside. The remainder of the basin will be paved with large\r\nboulders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIII, FIG. 1.--ESTANZUELA DAM: BROKEN CONCRETE\r\nBASIN LINING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIII, FIG. 2.--ESTANZUELA DAM: BROKEN CONCRETE\r\nBASIN LINING, EAST SIDE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIII, FIG. 3.--ESTANZUELA DAM SEPT. 26, 1910: VIEW\r\nOF SHEARING FRACTURES OF WALL AND LINING AFTER FLOOD SEPT. 14-17, 1910.]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the writer wishes to emphasize the point that,\r\nnotwithstanding the severity of the test, relatively small damage was\r\ninflicted on the extensive works carried out under the author's design and\r\ndirection. A test so severe that it caused serious damage and immense\r\nlosses in the entire region, washing away kilometers of railroad track and\r\ndestroying practically all the bridges within reach of the flood, is an\r\noccurrence of paramount importance, and should be remembered as a leading\r\nfactor in the design of engineering works.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE T. HAMMOND, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--In a country, such as\r\nthat described in this paper, where water is valuable, and a shortage is\r\nat times possible, where the majority of the population is very poor, and\r\nwater and sewage discharge are both to be paid for on a basis of volume,\r\nthe question of the expected quantity of daily water supply and sewage\r\nflow per capita is of primary importance. This question, notwithstanding\r\nits difficulty, should be given a first place in the studies for\r\nwater-works and sewerage projects, and should never be lost sight of in\r\nthe design, which should be such that, while proper for the expected\r\nfuture flow for a reasonable time, should also be proper and economical\r\nfor conditions which at present obtain and may change but slowly.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable, of course, to get as much capacity in works as one can\r\nfor the outlay, but there are instances where one can get too much for the\r\nmoney, as where a larger pipe than is necessary is used for a sewer,\r\nmerely because it costs about the same as a smaller one, and as a result\r\nthe cost of maintenance is permanently increased.\r\n\r\nThe water-works were designed to supply 40,000,000 liters (10,582,000\r\ngal.) daily, which it was assumed would be sufficient for all future\r\ndevelopments in Monterrey for a population of 200,000 at a per capita\r\nconsumption of 200 liters (about 53 gal.) per day. The present population\r\nof the city is given as less than 90,000, there having been an increase of\r\n22,000 in ten years (1891-1901), but it is evident that in the last ten\r\nyears (1901-1911) this rate of increase has not continued. Taking into\r\naccount all the data known to the writer, it does not seem that the city\r\nwill attain a population of 200,000 in a great many years, if it ever\r\ndoes; but this is a matter of personal opinion, and is only stated as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nThe present requirements of the city's population, assuming that each\r\nperson uses 200 liters (53 gal.) per day, would be, at that rate, which is\r\na very liberal one, only 18,000,000 liters (4,762,000 gal.) per day, or\r\nless than half the amount which may be provided.\r\n\r\nIf the water were not to be metered and the sewage discharge paid for by\r\nmeasure, it is possible that the free use of water might lead to the usual\r\nwaste with which all are fairly familiar; but the use of meters, and the\r\nrates charged, will reduce the water consumption to a minimum. This end\r\nwill especially result from Section 5 of the Tariffs which provides that:\r\n\r\n\"Groups can be formed of two or more small houses so as to obtain a joint\r\nservice under the proportion shown in the tariff.\"\r\n\r\nThis provision will keep down the per capita supply, among the majority of\r\nthe people, to about 37-1/2 liters (10 gal.) per day. A similar provision\r\nled to abuse in Santiago de Cuba, as well as in other Cuban cities, where\r\none householder, taking water, frequently delivers it to adjoining houses\r\nand tenements through rubber hose. As many as ten or twelve families are\r\nsometimes found to be supplied from one tap in this manner. Indeed, it may\r\nbe stated as a rule, having but few exceptions, that where water is paid\r\nfor by meter its use is always restricted.\r\n\r\nThe water mains and distribution system, however, are so well laid out,\r\nand the whole design is so good, that the writer would not anticipate much\r\ndifficulty because it is on rather too liberal lines for the present or\r\nprobable future. It may, perhaps, be argued that it may cost more to keep\r\nthe mains in such a system clean; but this extra cost will scarcely be of\r\nmuch moment, and will be offset by the greater lasting quality of the\r\nlarger pipes. There is another feature of the problem, however, which is\r\nnot affected favorably by a too liberal forecast of the per capita water\r\nsupply, namely, the sewerage system.\r\n\r\nIf it is assumed that, using 200 liters per capita per day, the total\r\nwater supply of the city for the present population will be 18,000,000\r\nliters, and that this may double in fifty years, or even amount to\r\n40,000,000 liters in that time, it would seem that a rather liberal\r\nprovision has been made for the water supply, and that this will scarcely\r\nbe exceeded by the sewage, for the latter must come from the water supply,\r\nthere being little or no ground-water and no storm-water taken into the\r\nsewers. Designing the sewers to flow half full for all diameters less than\r\n18 in., and seven-tenths full for all larger sizes, it would seem that\r\nthis would give ample capacity for all time to come in such a city, and\r\nthat good practice would not exceed these figures, it being more desirable\r\nthat the sewers should not be too large to work well, than that they\r\nshould be large enough in all places to meet every possible contingency.\r\nIf all the sewers of a system are too large, the condition is incurably\r\nbad; while, if a few miles prove to be too small, on account of growth and\r\nprosperity not anticipated by the designer, it will be easy enough to\r\nrelay such parts when this becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. Conway states that:\r\n\r\n\"The sewers are designed on a very liberal basis, namely, on the\r\nassumption that when flowing half full the quantity to be dealt with will\r\nbe 380 liters [100 gal.] per capita per day, with a maximum rate of flow\r\nof 200 per cent.\"\r\n\r\nIf the writer understands this statement correctly, it means that the\r\nsewers, flowing half full, will carry 380 liters per capita in 12 hours,\r\nor are designed with 200% of the capacity required to take the assumed\r\nflow in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nIt was assumed that each house would be occupied by 7 persons and have a\r\nfrontage of 12-1/2 m. (about 41 ft.), that is, about 700 gal. per day per\r\nhouse, the maximum flow rate being 200%, or at the rate of 700 gal. per\r\nhouse in 12 hours.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that nearly all the houses are of one story, and\r\nthat, as a rule in tropical and sub-tropical countries, the per capita use\r\nof water diminishes with some function of the increasing number of\r\ninhabitants in one house. Most of the water is used in the kitchen, and\r\nwhere there are 7 persons instead of 5, the quantity used by the smaller\r\nnumber will generally serve the larger.\r\n\r\nThe writer is unable to understand how this quantity of sewage will be\r\nproduced, especially as the author states that, as far as the company is\r\nconcerned, it is limited to the removal and disposal of the sewage, and is\r\nnot required to provide for storm-water. He also states that:\r\n\r\n\"Apart from that fact, however, the best system for a city like Monterrey,\r\nwhere rainfall for many months at a time is very scarce, is the strictly\r\n'separate system'.\"\r\n\r\nThe minimum velocities in the sewers, when running full, vary between 0.91\r\nand 1.5 m. (from 3 to 5 ft.) per sec., and will be the same flowing half\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing data it will be observed that:\r\n\r\n    (1) The water supply is the only source from which sewage flow\r\n    is anticipated;\r\n\r\n    (2) The water supply is very liberally estimated at 200 liters\r\n    (53 gal.) per capita daily;\r\n\r\n    (3) For purposes of sewer design, the daily flow of sewage\r\n    expected (all of which is derived from the water supply of 200\r\n    liters per capita) is estimated at 380 liters per capita, with a\r\n    maximum rate of flow of 200% (or at the rate of 760 liters per\r\n    capita), and with this quantity the sewers are designed to flow\r\n    only half full;\r\n\r\n    (4) The gradients are such that a velocity of from 3 to 5 ft.\r\n    (0.91 to 1.5 m.) per sec. will be secured in the sewers flowing\r\n    half full with the above quantity of flow per capita.\r\n\r\nThe writer does not agree with this method of computation, as he feels\r\nsure that it will give sewers which are too large, with grades too steep\r\nfor the best obtainable results. His experience, extending over more than\r\ntwenty years in sewer design and hydraulic work, convinces him that the\r\nmethod pursued is wrong in principle.\r\n\r\nThe principles involved in sewer design are first of all hydraulic. The\r\nquantity of flow, in the nature of things, cannot be forecasted\r\naccurately; success depends on getting the nearest possible approximation\r\nto average conditions. If 200 liters per capita per day is a liberal\r\nallowance, and 40,000,000 liters per day is a liberal expectation at this\r\nrate for double the present population, and the sewers are designed to\r\nflow half full only, why should this again be doubled?\r\n\r\nThe design of a sewer system for a city such as Monterrey is, in fact, a\r\nvery difficult problem, especially as the quantity of sewage will be very\r\nlimited, flush-water will have to be used in considerable quantities, and\r\nwater in that part of the world is precious at all times and often scarce.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the size or shape of the pipes selected for the\r\nlateral sewers, should have been such as would more nearly agree with the\r\nrequirements than does the 8-in. circular.\r\n\r\nA. P. Folwell, M. Am. Soc. C. E., writing of the 8-in. circular size,\r\nstates:[10]\r\n\r\n[10] \"Sewerage,\" by A. P. Folwell, M. Am, Soc. C. E.\r\n\r\n    \"To secure a flow in this pipe having an average depth of 4\r\n    inches would require the sewage from a population of 6,500. In\r\n    general it may be said that the ordinary depth of flow in any\r\n    sewer should not be less than 2 inches, nor should it be less\r\n    than 1/2 the radius of the invert, since if it is so there is\r\n    much more danger of deposits forming along the edges and even in\r\n    the center of the stream. It will sometimes be impossible to\r\n    meet this requirement fully, but it should be kept in mind as\r\n    extremely desirable.\"\r\n\r\nSewers of small size should be proportioned throughout the system so that\r\nthe depth of the minimum daily flow in the invert, and the velocity of\r\nflow, will be the best possible to prevent deposits. The transporting\r\npower of water is dependent mainly on the depth of flow, a minimum\r\nvelocity being selected rather than a minimum depth of flow. To those who\r\nhave had charge of the maintenance of sewers, as well as of their design\r\nand construction, this principle seems so obvious that it is always a\r\nsurprise to see it disregarded by designers, who in these days seem\r\ninclined to consider sewerage as a system of grades and sizes of pipes\r\ninstalled for ideal, rather than for actual, conditions. Messrs. Staley\r\nand Pierson have well stated the principle involved as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A stream having a depth of flow sufficient to immerse solid matter held\r\nin suspension, to a certain extent lifts it and carries it forward. The\r\nentire surface is also exposed to the action of the current. A stream\r\nhaving an equal velocity but a less depth in proportion to the diameter of\r\nthe solid matters to be transported, evidently has less transporting\r\npower. * * * An amount of sewage which can be properly transported by a\r\ncircular sewer of a given size, cannot be as efficiently transported by\r\none of larger diameter.\"\r\n\r\nFrom some strange idea, which is apparently without foundation in logic or\r\nbased on any actual justification from experience, it has of late years\r\nbecome the practice of designing engineers to make the 8-in. circular\r\npipe the smallest size for sewers; and it is not improbable that the\r\ndesigner of the Monterrey system has merely followed this example. It has\r\nalso become the frequent practice of designers to give every length of\r\nsewer all the grade possible, regardless of the fact, taught both by\r\nhydraulics and experience, that the best grade is that which will give as\r\nmuch depth of flow as is consistent with a scouring velocity.\r\n\r\nSome years ago it was the standard practice, in the \"strictly separate\r\nsystem\" of sewers, to use the 6-in. pipe as the minimum size, and, as far\r\nas the writer has been able to discover, after giving the matter a rather\r\nextensive investigation, the 6-in. size has given excellent results\r\nwherever its use was proper. In places where it has not succeeded there\r\nwere excellent reasons why it should not have been selected, and these\r\ncould easily have been observed at the time the designs were made. The\r\nbest sizes for the sewers in a given system is always a matter to be\r\ndetermined by local conditions; but there seems to be no reason why the\r\n6-in. size should not be used where the flow is so slight that the 8-in.\r\nwill not work well; or where the velocity must of necessity be so great\r\nthat a flotation depth of flow cannot be maintained in the larger size. As\r\nto likelihood of clogging and stoppage, the writer's opinion, based on the\r\nmaintenance of three rather extensive systems in different parts of the\r\nUnited States, in each of which the 6-in. size comprises more than 75% of\r\nthe whole length of pipe, and of three other systems, one having 12-in.\r\nand two having 8-in. as the minimum sizes, is that the 6-in. size, where\r\nproperly used, is less likely to become clogged than either of the others\r\nused improperly. The cost of maintaining the 6-in. pipe lateral, under\r\nthese circumstances, is much less than that of maintaining the 8-in.\r\nlateral.\r\n\r\nThe 6-in. pipe is not being used now as much as the 8-in., and in most\r\ncases this is probably because the capacity of the latter is nearly double\r\nthat of the 6-in., and costs only a few cents more per foot. If there is a\r\nsufficient population per acre, or if, within 30 or 40 years, such a\r\npopulation is anticipated as will fill the 8-in. pipe half full, its use,\r\nof course, is justified and necessary; but where it is quite evident that\r\nthis will never occur, its use is counter-indicated.\r\n\r\nIn Monterrey, where the building lots have a frontage of 41 ft., where the\r\nhouses, as a rule, are only one story high, where the water service is\r\nmetered and paid for, and the sewage flow is also paid for, there seems to\r\nbe no reason to justify the use of 8-in. pipe for the upper reaches of the\r\nsmallest sewers. The sewage flow to be anticipated will probably never be\r\nsufficient to keep an 8-in. pipe sewer in a good clean condition at the\r\nupper ends of the lines of sewers without excessive flushing; and the\r\nsharper or steeper the grade on which it is placed, the worse will be the\r\nresult, because the sharper the grade, the thinner the flowing thread of\r\nsewage will be drawn out in the invert; on the other hand, if the grades\r\nare flat, the slight quantity of sewage flow will be spread out in a\r\nsluggish stream, without sufficient depth, on the bottom of the 8-in.\r\npipe.\r\n\r\nWhere a wide surface is given to a small quantity of flowing sewage, it\r\nstagnates slowly along the bottom of the sewer, leaving frequent deposits\r\nto undergo decomposition and create foul air, if not to choke the sewer, a\r\nresult often produced; and where a circular sewer which is too large for\r\nthe ordinary flow is given a strong velocity by using steep grades, the\r\nstream, though flowing rapidly, is drawn out to such a thin thread that it\r\nwill not effect the flotation of the solid masses in the sewage brought in\r\nat house connections, and the shallow and thin stream simply flows around\r\nsuch masses until a dam or obstruction forms and the sewage is backed up\r\nsufficiently to force the obstruction farther down, to form another\r\nobstruction in a larger pipe below. Flushing may possibly keep such a\r\nsewer fairly clean; but, as usually practiced, it is effective only for a\r\nfew hundred feet from the flush-tank; and the quantity of flush-water\r\nrequired by an 8-in. pipe is more than twice as much as that required to\r\nkeep the 6-in. pipe clean. Ventilation is better in the smaller sewer than\r\nin the larger, as there is less air to move; but the elaborate ventilating\r\nstacks provided at Monterrey may take care of this; and it is evidently a\r\nplace where ventilation will be needed.\r\n\r\nThe ideal size and shape of cross-section for a sewer is such as will give\r\nthe best flotation to moving solids which are being carried along by the\r\nflow; and this means the sewer that, with the expected ordinary or average\r\nflow, will give the best depth in the invert, when the velocity of flow is\r\nsufficient to keep suspended solids, grit, etc., moving at a rate of from\r\n2 to 3 ft. per sec. The size, however, is limited by practical\r\nconsiderations. The circular pipes cannot well be less than 6 in. in\r\ndiameter, because the house connections cannot well be less than 4-in.\r\npipe, and the sewer should be larger than the house connections, for\r\nvarious practical reasons; but, in order to secure flotation and a\r\nscouring flow, the smallest pipe, or the pipe having the smallest invert\r\nradius, that practical considerations permit, should be selected. The\r\ngrade should be such, and the collecting system so laid out, that the flow\r\nmay be conserved as far as possible, and the sewage flow should be kept of\r\nas great a depth in the invert, or bottom of the sewer, as safety in\r\nself-cleansing velocity will permit. This will save flush-water and\r\nprevent stoppages, and thus reduce the cost of maintenance to a minimum.\r\nFor good sanitary practice, the sewers should be designed, first of all,\r\nto comply with the requirements of the present, or immediately expected,\r\nordinary flow, with some reasonable allowance for the future. They should\r\nbe neither too large nor too small, and the grade should neither be too\r\ngreat nor too little, to secure the best flotation and scouring effects\r\nand the best flush-wave action under all circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe use of cement concrete pipe for sewers seems to be growing in favor;\r\nnor is this surprising, in view of the many improvements made in their\r\ndesign and manufacture. The excellence of the concrete pipe used in\r\nMonterrey and its success, suggest the query: Why was it not used still\r\nmore extensively?\r\n\r\nTable 13 shows that the cement pipe cost much less than the vitrified\r\ntile, or \"fire-clay\" pipe. Thus, the 38.1 cm. (15-in.) fire-clay cost 6.14\r\npesos per lin. m., the 45.7 cm. (18-in.) cost 8.80 pesos, and the 50.8 cm.\r\n(20-in.) cost 11.30 pesos. Compared with this, the concrete pipe was much\r\nthe cheaper; the 55.9 cm. (22-in.) cost 5.93 pesos, which is less than the\r\ncost of the 38.1 cm. (15-in.) fire-clay; and the 61.0 cm. (25-in.)\r\nconcrete pipe cost 7.30 pesos, which is less than the 45.7 cm. (18-in.)\r\nfire-clay.\r\n\r\nThe writer's experience with concrete pipe, derived mainly from a long\r\nservice in sewer design and construction in Brooklyn, N. Y., leads him to\r\nbelieve that at Monterrey the whole sewer system might, with advantage,\r\nhave been built of concrete pipe, using an egg-shaped pipe with an area\r\nslightly larger than an 8-in. circle, designed for a discharge equal to an\r\n8-in. pipe for all the smaller sewers. The invert of such an egg-shaped\r\npipe would fulfill the present requirements in carrying a very small flow\r\nwith good flotation depth, better than would a 6-in. circular pipe, and\r\nthe reserve capacity of the 8-in. pipe would be secured without\r\ninterfering with good present service. Egg-shaped pipes, similar to those\r\nused in Brooklyn, the writer believes, would have given far better\r\nsatisfaction throughout the Monterrey sewerage system than circular\r\nfire-clay pipe, and would have cost no more, but probably less. The\r\negg-shaped pipe referred to is made with a flat base and a self-centering\r\njoint, thus insuring perfect alignment, and a smoother interior surface\r\nthan can be obtained with fire-clay pipes.\r\n\r\nBrooklyn has about 450 miles of concrete pipe sewers, of all sizes less\r\nthan 24 in., the greater part of which is egg-shaped. There are also about\r\n250 miles of vitrified stoneware circular pipe sewers of similar sizes,\r\nand the cost of repairs and replacing pipe, over a period of years is\r\nabout the same per mile for each kind. Incidentally, it may be stated that\r\nthe annual cost of repairs per mile on both kinds of pipe is very small,\r\nand is only about one-fifth of the cost of repairs per mile on the brick\r\nsewers, of which there are about 200 miles.\r\n\r\nThe principal advantages and disadvantages of cement concrete pipe sewers\r\nmay be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n                      ADVANTAGES OF CONCRETE PIPE.\r\n\r\n  (a) Cement concrete pipe is usually less costly than vitrified\r\n      pipe.\r\n\r\n  (b) It can be formed in any shape desired.\r\n\r\n  (c) It is not cracked by vibration, and resists impact better than\r\n      vitrified pipe, for which reason it is a better material to\r\n      lay near the surface of a street in which there is heavy\r\n      traffic.\r\n\r\n  (d) It is not affected by ordinary sewage.\r\n\r\n  (e) The cost of repairing and maintaining is about the same as for\r\n      a vitrified pipe sewer.\r\n\r\n  (f) It can be made in the city or town where it is to be\r\n      installed, thus giving the locality the advantage of having\r\n      some of the money paid for labor in its manufacture spent in\r\n      the place where the sewers are being put in, where it is\r\n      raised as a tax, etc.; also saving freight charges, etc.\r\n\r\n  (g) It can be made under the most careful local supervision and\r\n      inspection, of selected material, by the engineer who is\r\n      responsible for the success of the work. Vitrified pipe can\r\n      seldom be made in this way.\r\n\r\n                      DISADVANTAGES OF CONCRETE PIPE.\r\n\r\n  (a) If not carefully made and of the best of materials, it is\r\n      subject to failure by disintegration, etc.\r\n\r\n  (b) It will not stand strong chemical action, and therefore the\r\n      smaller sizes should not be used where they are likely to be\r\n      exposed to trade wastes containing strong acids. In the larger\r\n      sizes the quantity of flow mixes so quickly with the trade\r\n      wastes that this danger is minimized, and it is very seldom\r\n      that even the smaller sizes become affected; but vitrified\r\n      pipe may be used in places where chemical action is\r\n      anticipated.\r\n\r\n  (c) If not properly made, it will be attacked by steam and hot\r\n      vapor, and by animal fats in the sewage; but, if properly\r\n      made, it is not affected by these.\r\n\r\n  (d) Unless reinforced or made very thick, it will not stand as\r\n      great a crushing load as the best vitrified stoneware pipe;\r\n      but, as sewers are not intended to be used under very heavy\r\n      pressure, this is not so very important. It is amply strong to\r\n      withstand any internal pressure or any external crushing load\r\n      to which it probably will be submitted.\r\n\r\n  (e) Under a considerable head of ground-water, it may permit water\r\n      to infiltrate through its walls for a considerable time after\r\n      it is laid, thereby temporarily increasing the flow, which, if\r\n      the sewage is to be pumped, will increase the cost of pumping.\r\n      This difficulty can be met by using a carefully selected mix\r\n      of materials in making the pipe, and by making the joints\r\n      carefully. Infiltration through concrete diminishes rapidly\r\n      after the sewer is in use; it occurs in vitrified pipe, also,\r\n      to some extent.\r\n\r\nThe house connection drain adopted in Monterrey, with the disconnecting\r\ntrap, is very much like one which the writer has seen introduced with very\r\nbad result. These are being removed as rapidly as possible by one of his\r\nclients, a sewerage company, in the Southern States. It has been a\r\nfruitful cause of stoppages and bad smells; the ordinary method now in\r\ngeneral use is much better. In the design shown, it would seem that there\r\nmay even be some danger that the ventilation of the sewer by the\r\nstand-pipes in the streets may force the traps.\r\n\r\nOne is rather surprised to learn that the main outfall sewer is designed\r\nwith a capacity of 90,000,000 liters per day, the present sewage being\r\nestimated as not more than 18,000,000 liters, and the far future being\r\nthought to require only 40,000,000 liters. Why this excessive size?\r\nPossibly the surplus water which it is to carry is to be discharged into\r\nthe sewers from the water supply system direct, and is intended for\r\nirrigating the land at the disposal area, when the sewage is insufficient\r\nfor this purpose. The author states that all surface water is strictly\r\nexcluded.\r\n\r\nThe method of sewage disposal gives rise to several questions. It is\r\nproposed to use an extensive area for growing crops, which are to be\r\nirrigated with sewage. The paper states that the underlying strata at\r\nMonterrey contain numerous caverns, and the first question is: What will\r\nbe the effect on the water supply of other towns lower down the valley?\r\nThe writer recollects a serious outbreak of typhoid fever in Bluefield, W.\r\nVa., caused by the pollution of the water in similar strata finding its\r\nway through unknown underground caverns and channels to the city's water\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThe next question is: What crops will be grown? It is a well-known fact\r\nthat vegetables grown by the use of sewage as a fertilizer, are unsafe in\r\na raw state for human consumption. This is well-known to European\r\ntravelers in China and Japan, where the use of fecal matter as fertilizer\r\nrenders the various water supplies (where not filtered and disinfected)\r\nand all green vegetables, unsafe, on account of typhoid germs. Moreover,\r\ncrops not intended for human consumption, which are grown on lands\r\nirrigated by sewage bearing typhoid germs, etc., are unsafe for men to\r\nhandle; even to store them may cause a dissemination of disease. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that the whole sewage flow should be in some manner\r\ndisinfected at least, if not filtered, before it is used.\r\n\r\nThe method of sewage disposal and the use of merely settled septic sewage\r\nfor irrigation seem to be open to objection. The disposal plant is not\r\nsufficiently effective to meet the present requirements of sanitary\r\nscience; and the sludge-pit will be certain to breed a pest of flies, if\r\nit is not also an intolerable nuisance on account of foul smells.\r\nMonterrey would seem to be a proper place for the introduction of the\r\nImhoff tank, with percolating filters, and a final settling tank, the\r\neffluent being disinfected, before entering the latter tank. The flow\r\nmight then be used safely for irrigation purposes for crops not to be\r\neaten uncooked by man. The writer does not see how the method provided can\r\npossibly fulfill the object stated, to distribute on the land an effluent\r\nwhich will be \"innocuous and clear,\" or how any consequential degree of\r\npurification can be obtained in the tanks provided.\r\n\r\nWhile there are described in this paper many things to find fault with,\r\nthere are also many things to commend. The water supply system, with its\r\nreservoirs, etc., seems to be admirable; and the methods of construction\r\nby which the expense for forms was reduced is very interesting. The\r\nparking and ornamentation of the grounds over the reservoir roofs cannot\r\nfail to benefit the people and popularize the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUDOLF MEYER, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--The writer, as Engineer for\r\nthe Government (guaranteeing the concessionaires a gross return of 10% per\r\nannum on the capital invested), and as inspector of the various works has\r\nhad exceptional opportunities to become acquainted, not only with their\r\nconstruction, but also with events leading up to the granting of the final\r\nconcession under which they were built and will be extended. In order to\r\njudge of the extent to which the different engineers, in their turn\r\ncontributed toward the design of these works, the writer has thought it\r\ndesirable to submit a complete statement of all matters relating to the\r\ninception, investigations, surveys, tests, etc., previous to the adoption\r\nof the present plans.\r\n\r\nData regarding former investigations, plans, and concessions which have\r\nsince lapsed, have been obtained from the Government archives. These refer\r\nto periods prior to Mr. Conway's engagement, and anterior to the retaining\r\nof Mr. Schuyler by the concessionaires, and Mr. Binckley's connection with\r\nthe scheme, and they are presented here as complementary to the\r\ninformation in the paper.\r\n\r\nSamuel M. Gray, M. Am. Soc. C. E., acting in the interest of some American\r\ncapitalists (who had been induced by Col. J. A. Robertson, of Monterrey,\r\nto look into the merits of a concession acquired by him, for building\r\nthese works), being guided by the Government's proposition to supply the\r\ncity with water by damming the flood-waters of the Santa Catarina River in\r\nthe narrow gorge through which the stream emerges from the Sierras, some\r\neight miles from the city, had several soundings made and reservoir sites\r\nsurveyed in the first two box canons up the river, and prepared and\r\npresented to the Government several alternative projects, besides the one\r\nmentioned by Mr. Schuyler. Several different dam sites were designated by\r\nMr. Gray, whose investigations extended over some two years, and were\r\nfinally abandoned after he had designed the general outlay for a complete\r\nnetwork of water mains and sewers for the city, on account of the\r\nunwillingness of the Government at that time, about 1897, to grant any\r\nguaranties as to bonds or income to the concessionaire or his assigns. Mr.\r\nGray did not favor the general scheme of storing flood-waters as a water\r\nsupply, but strongly recommended to the attention of the Government the\r\ngreater advantages of deriving the supply from subterranean flow in the\r\nriver, by an infiltration gallery driven into the water-bearing gravels in\r\nthe Santa Catarina Canon (only a short distance above the place where Mr.\r\nBinckley afterward established his bore-holes across the river). He\r\nproposed to take advantage of the steep slope of the river at a turn in\r\nthe canon, and from the lower end drive a tunnel through a projecting rock\r\nspur, which tunnel, though starting well above the ordinary reach of\r\nfloods, would terminate in water-bearing gravel, at a sufficient depth\r\nbelow the surface of the river-bed to intercept part of the underflow. Mr.\r\nGray, through investigations made under his direction, by Nathaniel\r\nTurner, M. Am. Soc. C. E., had ascertained that there was an abundant\r\nsubterranean flow, and work had actually been started on the proposed\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\nThe results of Mr. Gray's investigations were put at the disposal of\r\nMessrs. Mackenzie, Mann & Co. by Mr. Robertson, at whose offices Mr.\r\nBinckley prepared the first plans submitted by him for the approval of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Gray's investigations, Messrs. Mackin and Dillon (F. H. Dillon,\r\nAssoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.), under contract with the Government, prepared\r\nthe following plans: For a dam in the Santa Catarina Canon; for a pipe\r\nline, similar to the one proposed by Mr. Gray, to a reservoir and settling\r\nbasin on the left bank of the river (a short distance above where the\r\nprovisional pumping station was established afterward by Mr. Binckley),\r\nbut on the flat above the bluff skirting the river, practically at the\r\nsame elevation as the present high-pressure reservoirs; for a complete\r\nnetwork of water mains and sewers in the city, indicating the approximate\r\ndirection in which the sewage would be disposed of, either by turning it\r\ninto the river or by spreading it over suitable lands, the location of\r\nwhich was to be determined later; and also a complete set of\r\nspecifications.\r\n\r\nOn these data bids were invited by publication, and inquiries were\r\nreceived from several parties. Finally, Messrs. Stocker and Walker, of\r\nScranton, Pa., entered into negotiations with the Government, and the\r\npresent concession was agreed upon and granted.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Stocker and Walker engaged the late E. Sherman Gould, M. Am. Soc.\r\nC. E., to prepare a plan for a storage dam in the Santa Catarina Canon,\r\nand submitted plans for water distribution and sewers in the city,\r\nslightly modifying the original plans of Messrs. Mackin and Dillon.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1905, the concession was acquired by Messrs. Mackenzie,\r\nMann & Co., of Toronto, Canada, together with all plans, etc.,\r\npresented by the original concessionaires. The new concessionaires stated\r\nthat they would examine the whole situation again, for the purpose of\r\npresenting modified plans for works.\r\n\r\nMr. Schuyler, in the interest of the new owners, had paid one flying visit\r\nto Monterrey when Mr. Gray's projects were brought to his notice, and the\r\nwriter had an opportunity to show him the tunnel which had been started.\r\nMr. Schuyler left for Brazil and did not return until February, 1906, when\r\nhe was accompanied by the Chief Engineer appointed by the concessionaires.\r\nMessrs. Schuyler and Binckley then prepared plans for the water\r\ndistribution and sewer systems in the city and for a provisional water\r\nsupply to be pumped at San Geronimo, some two miles up the river. The new\r\nplans for the city work followed closely the general disposition by Mr.\r\nGray, the principal difference being that the main reservoirs for the\r\npermanent water supply were located to the south instead of to the west.\r\nThis change was due to the results of an investigation, made during Mr.\r\nSchuyler's absence in Brazil, by Mr. F. S. Hyde, late Hydraulic Engineer\r\nof the Necaxa Water Power plant, who, accompanied by the writer, visited\r\nthe whole water-shed of the Santa Catarina River in October, 1905, in\r\nsearch of suitable dam sites and prospects of power development. Mr. Hyde\r\nextended his studies to the Santiago Canon, southeast of the city,\r\nrecommending finally that the water be brought from that canon, and that\r\nwells be dug in different points of the Santa Catarina River between San\r\nGeronimo and the entrance of the canon, and tested by pumping, for the\r\npurpose of establishing levels and ascertaining the available amount of\r\nunderflow, with a view of determining the location for an infiltration\r\ngallery high enough up the river to permit of a gravity delivery and under\r\ngood pressure in the city.\r\n\r\nIn view of Mr. Hyde's report, and as the result of a visit to the Santiago\r\nCanon, Mr. Schuyler decided to locate the reservoirs south of the town,\r\nintending to bring in water from the southeast, from springs in the\r\nSantiago Canon, and also by infiltration from Santa Catarina, his and Mr.\r\nBinckley's scheme of water supply being for the same pressure throughout\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nTo supply water during construction, and partly meet the demands of the\r\ncity, Mr. Binckley, on his arrival, decided to establish a provisional\r\npumping station at the well in the river nearest to town, started by\r\ndirection of Mr. Hyde at San Geronimo. This well was situated within the\r\nbed of inundation of high floods, on a low bank, at the foot of a\r\nconglomerate bluff some 20 ft. high, limiting a flat which was above the\r\nreach of any flood. It was on the same side of the river as the city, and\r\nthere was plenty of good ground on the flat above for the establishment of\r\na reservoir.\r\n\r\nA slightly shorter pipe line was secured by crossing the river, building\r\nthe reservoir (a substantial concrete-lined and vaulted-over structure) on\r\nthe opposite bank, laying out the pipe line to follow that bank nearly to\r\nthe city, and finally crossing back again; but the result has been that\r\nsince the flood of August, 1909, in which the river crossings were\r\ndestroyed, the reservoir remains isolated on the other side of the river\r\nfrom town, though intended to form part of the permanent works and act as\r\na compensating reservoir for equalizing the pressure of the high-pressure\r\nsystem. Fortunately, the pumping station, the larger pumps, and the\r\nboilers, had been moved up the bank (after a rapid rise in the river on\r\nAugust 10th, 1909) to the new wells established by Mr. Conway on the line\r\nof the proposed prolongation of the infiltration gallery. The reservoir,\r\nhowever, is left to stand alone on the other side of the river, and its\r\nusefulness will not be restored until a new line is laid across the river,\r\nre-establishing its connection with the new pump line and the new and\r\npermanent pipe line to be laid along the north bank from the pumping\r\nstation to the city. This will free Monterrey from the constant menace of\r\na water famine. At present its two main water supplies may be cut off by\r\nunexpected floods like those of 1909 and 1910, as both supplies are\r\ncarried across the river, and though only the cast-iron pipe connecting\r\nwith the water supply from Estanzuela was carried away by the flood, the\r\nconcrete conduit of the San Geronimo low-pressure supply was seriously\r\nthreatened. Such risks are too great to be carried for any length of time;\r\nbesides, a succession of dry years would cause such a reduction in the\r\nEstanzuela supply as to require an additional reserve in the way of\r\npumping stations drawing on the under-flow of the river, such as already\r\nexists in San Geronimo.\r\n\r\nAfterward, Messrs. Schuyler and Binckley submitted preliminary plans and\r\nprofiles for the projected concrete gravity conduit from Estanzuela to the\r\nreservoir south of the city, and Mr. Binckley submitted excavation plans\r\nfor two reservoirs, only one of which was built, and from designs by Mr.\r\nConway.\r\n\r\nStephen E. Kieffer, M. Am. Soc. C. E., was intrusted by Mr. Binckley with\r\nthe revision of the plans of the water distribution and sewers. The\r\nsouthern half was approved by the Government and executed according to his\r\nplans; the northern part was afterward revised by Mr. Conway and has been\r\npartly built.\r\n\r\nThe final maturing of the project of an infiltration gallery in San\r\nGeronimo as a low-pressure gravity supply, the division of the city into\r\nhigh- and low-pressure districts corresponding to the two supplies, with\r\none reservoir, instead of two to the south of the city, and the other to\r\nthe west at the Obispado, the entire details of both these gravity\r\nschemes, and of the whole sewage disposal scheme, as well as the\r\nmodification introduced into the city work for the northern half, are\r\nunquestionably due to Mr. Conway, independently of the general views which\r\nmay have been held on those points by other engineers.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1910, Mr. Conway left Monterrey, all the principal works being\r\nfinished. Since that time Vicente Saucedo, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E., has\r\nput in many additional water mains and sewers in the northern part of the\r\ncity, and is finishing the _force majeure_ work caused by the destruction\r\nwrought in the districts along the river banks by the extraordinary\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nThe writer, having had an opportunity to watch the earnest efforts of the\r\nseveral engineers connected with these works, in the course of their\r\ndesign and construction, resulting without doubt in being the first of\r\ntheir kind built in Mexico, has been induced to contribute this discussion\r\nin order to bring out clearly the share of each.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitkethly's apprehensions as to the adequacy of the system of\r\nventilation adopted have not been realized, in part perhaps because the\r\nhouses, though generally of only one story, have such high ceilings that\r\nthe tops of their vent pipes are generally higher than the ventilating\r\ncolumns at the heads of the branch sewers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE ROBERT GRAHAM CONWAY, M. AM. SOC. C. E. (by letter).--The writer\r\nregrets that some features of the works described in this paper have\r\nfailed to call forth the many useful criticisms which he expected, and his\r\nremarks, therefore, are limited to the few points which have been raised.\r\nHe is particularly indebted to Messrs. Schuyler, Meyer, and Saucedo for\r\nadding supplementary information of value to the paper, but regrets that\r\nhe cannot support Mr. Binckley in his claim that \"the entire general\r\ndesign of the system, as well as the extensive hydrological studies and\r\nfinal selection of the sources of water supply, was completed in 1906,\"\r\netc. On May 1st, 1907, when the writer assumed responsibility as Chief\r\nEngineer, he was unfortunately confronted with the fact that very little\r\ndata and only a few preliminary and incomplete plans were available. His\r\nfirst duty was to report upon the final sources of supply, and the\r\nrecommendations made in his report (dated July 12th), received Mr. (now\r\nSir William) Mackenzie's approval during the same month. The final plans,\r\nupon which the approval of the State Government was definitely obtained,\r\nwere prepared by the writer during the summer of 1907, were submitted to\r\nthe Governor of the State, Gen. Bernard Reyes, on October 19th, and\r\nreceived his approval on December 12th, 1907. No works, with a long\r\npreliminary history, such as those at Monterrey, can rightly be said to be\r\ndue to any one individual; many engineers contributed to the final result,\r\nand the writer willingly acknowledges his indebtedness to the able men,\r\nwho, for ten years prior to the construction of the works, investigated\r\nthe particular problems which were met--problems which were not only of an\r\nengineering and physical nature, but racial and financial. The\r\nresponsibility of constructing the works in their present form, and\r\nleaving them practically complete, did, however, fall on the writer's\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Pitkethly and Hammond have criticized the basis of the\r\ncalculations upon which the sewer system was laid down. In considering\r\nthis problem, it is necessary to remember that, in designing this system,\r\nthere was practically no information upon which to base the calculations;\r\nand the writer believed that the wisest course was to anticipate a liberal\r\ngrowth, and provide a large margin of safety. In designing a sewer system\r\nin older and well-established communities, the engineer is generally able\r\nto compile considerable information regarding the probable sewage flow for\r\nwhich it is necessary to provide. In Monterrey this quantity was\r\nabsolutely unknown. The writer's practice in other places has been to\r\nassume that about 8% of the total daily discharge of sewage will flow off\r\nin one hour; and, from many curves which he has plotted regarding sewage\r\nflow in British towns, this rate appears to him to be approximately\r\ncorrect. In Monterrey, however, the old Mexican traditions are rapidly\r\nchanging, and the city is now becoming one of the most Americanized in\r\nMexico; the old one-story houses will give way in time to buildings of\r\nseveral stories--a change, already noticeable, which has occurred during\r\nthe past few years, particularly in the business portion of the city.\r\nTaking these facts into consideration, it is believed that it would be,\r\nnot only bad engineering, but bad business, for a company whose concession\r\nlasts 99 years, to provide sewers as small as 6 in., as Mr. Hammond would\r\nrecommend, and then be called upon, under the terms of the concession, to\r\nrelay larger sewers at a future date, thus incurring further capital\r\nexpenditure upon which no Government guaranty would apply, and no further\r\nrevenue be obtained. In matters of this kind, not only the engineering,\r\nbut the commercial, aspect of the question must be kept in view, and this\r\npoint, the writer must frankly admit, he has always seriously considered.\r\n\r\nThe writer's experience with reference to the method of ventilating sewers\r\nby tall columns extends over many years, and he still maintains that no\r\nother system gives such satisfactory results. In this view he finds\r\nconsiderable support in a recent paper on \"Salisbury Drainage,\" by Mr. W.\r\nJ. E. Binnie,[11] written since the system at Monterrey was installed, in\r\nwhich the result of a series of experiments carried on during 1906-07 are\r\ngiven. At Salisbury, England, 68 ventilators, 6 in. in internal diameter,\r\n30 ft. high, were connected to the main sewer by 6-in. stoneware pipes.\r\nThey were placed about 540 ft. apart, and, from careful anemometer\r\nreadings, the following conclusions were reached:\r\n\r\n[11] _Minutes of Proceedings_, Inst. C. E., Vol. CLXXXI, p. 317.\r\n\r\n  \"(1) That four ventilators all lying in the lower portion of the\r\n       town acted sometimes as air-inlets and sometimes as\r\n       air-outlets, and that the other sixty-four acted as\r\n       air-outlets.\r\n\r\n  \"(2) That the average velocity of the air escaping up these\r\n       columns was 3.2 feet per second, representing the circulation\r\n       of 3,600,000 cubic feet of air per diem, or sufficient to\r\n       change the air in the sewers every 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n  \"(3) That the average velocity of the current of air in the\r\n       ventilating-column increases with the size of the sewer to\r\n       which it is connected, averaging 2.4 feet per second with the\r\n       7-inch sewer, 3.6 feet per second with the 9-inch sewer, 3.7\r\n       feet per second with the 12-inch sewer, and 4.1 feet per\r\n       second with the 15-inch sewer in these experiments.\r\n\r\n  \"(4) That the draught in the column is very largely dependent on\r\n       the wind, being at its minimum on a still day, and could\r\n       therefore be readily increased by the use of a suitable cowl.\r\n\r\n  \"(5) That the draught is very little affected by the\r\n       sewer-gradients. It was expected that, in ventilating-columns\r\n       placed in connection with the upper end of a sewer laid at a\r\n       steep gradient, a strong draught would have been obtained. No\r\n       direct connection, however, was traceable.\"\r\n\r\nAs the result of these experiments, Mr. Binnie rightly came to the\r\nconclusion that this system of ventilation was efficient.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammond anticipates that the house connection trap system at Monterrey\r\nwill lead to bad results, but the writer has seen the system at work in\r\nmany widely different cities with excellent results. He believes that it\r\nis in accord with the best practice of the most eminent sanitarians during\r\nthe last 20 years, and has no apology to make for introducing that system\r\nin Monterrey.\r\n\r\nRegarding Mr. Hammond's summary of the advantages of concrete pipes for\r\nsewer construction, the writer is in entire agreement, and would willingly\r\nhave introduced them throughout the whole of the Monterrey system, but for\r\nthe fact that it was an exceedingly difficult matter to obtain suitable\r\nsand for their manufacture during the early days of construction, and\r\nconsiderable delays would have arisen if a complete network of such pipes\r\nhad been used. His later experience at Monterrey, when the sand difficulty\r\nhad been solved, clearly showed that concrete pipe could be laid down at\r\nmuch less expense than fire clay.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Pitkethly and Mr. Hammond refer to the system of liquefying tanks\r\nused at Monterrey preparatory to turning the sewage on the irrigation\r\nlands, and both express doubts as to their efficiency. The writer is now\r\nseparated from his library and notes by many thousands of miles, and\r\ncannot quote \"chapter and verse\" as accurately as he would like, in order\r\nto support his views that the system adopted was adequate for dealing\r\nwith a system such as that at Monterrey. It must be pointed out that not\r\nonly was it intended to prevent the sewage from becoming a nuisance, but\r\nthat the sewage flow plus a large quantity of surplus water was intended\r\nto be used profitably for irrigation purposes. With that object, the\r\nCompany--or rather its allied Company, the Monterrey Railway, Light, and\r\nPower Company--obtained the control of 2,246 acres of the very finest\r\narable land, with almost perfect natural drainage conditions, so that this\r\nland could be utilized to create a profitable revenue from the use of the\r\nsewage. The outfall sewer was accordingly designed to carry sufficient\r\nwater and sewage to irrigate about 2,500 acres of land, which area could\r\nbe considerably extended if necessary at any future time.\r\n\r\nMost authorities now agree that before turning sewage upon land, a\r\npreliminary treatment is required to remove as much as possible of the\r\nsuspended matter, and then reduce the latter by subsidence in liquefying\r\nor septic tanks, so that the quantity remaining in the effluent is so\r\nsmall and finely divided that it may be readily decomposed and oxidized by\r\nbacterial action without risk of clogging the surface or interstices of\r\nthe land upon which it may discharge.[12]\r\n\r\n[12] See Raikes, \"Sewage Disposal Works,\" pages 97-98.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitkethly quotes Messrs. Watson and O'Shaughnessy as saying, in their\r\nevidence before the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal, that not more\r\nthan 10% of the solids are digested in septic tanks, but it must be\r\nremembered that in many other places evidence was given before the same\r\nCommission showing that from 25 to 30% was actually obtained.\r\n\r\nMr. J. D. Watson, in his paper, \"Birmingham Sewage-Disposal Works,\"[13]\r\nread in March, 1910, points out that:\r\n\r\n[13] _Minutes of Proceedings_, Inst. C. E., Vol. CLXXXI, p. 259.\r\n\r\n    \"The much-maligned sewage-farm still may be allowed (where the\r\n    conditions are favourable) to rank as one of the best methods\r\n    of sewage-disposal. Diverse opinions may be held as to what are\r\n    favourable conditions, particularly as conditions are sure to\r\n    vary widely with locality; but it may be assumed that where\r\n    there is 1 acre of suitable land per 100 persons, as in Berlin\r\n    and several other important cities, the efficiently-worked\r\n    sewage-farm, when judged solely by the standard of the effluent\r\n    produced, is still in the front rank. Effluents from such a\r\n    farm are remarkable for their paucity of micro-organisms, their\r\n    low albuminoid ammonia, and their unvarying character.\"\r\n\r\nAssuming that not more than 2,000 acres of the irrigated land at Monterrey\r\nwere available for sewage purposes, this area would represent the sewage\r\ntreatment of the present population of not more than 45 persons per acre,\r\nand on the basis of the design, that is, for a population of 200,000\r\npersons, this represents not more than 100 persons per acre. In many\r\nsewage farms on the continent of Europe, the number treated per acre\r\nvaries between 80 and 200 persons; for example, at Breslau it is 187, at\r\nBerlin 105, at Brunswick 88, and at Steglitz 185.\r\n\r\nRegarding the crops to be grown on the land, very satisfactory results\r\nwere obtained from growing Indian corn, and two excellent crops per annum\r\nwere taken from an area of 500 acres during the period in which the writer\r\nwas responsible for the works. It was also his intention to grow alfalfa,\r\nand turn a part of the land into a pecan grove, and, although he does not\r\nshare the apprehensions of danger of either Mr. Pitkethly or Mr. Hammond\r\nas to growing root crops, he believes the growth of alfalfa, Indian corn,\r\noats, barley, and pecan and fruit trees is eminently suitable for the\r\nland, which is a deep rich loam, from 4 to 8 ft. deep, overlying the\r\n\"sillar\" formation referred to in the paper. The writer has seen many\r\nsewage farms during the last 18 years, upon which root crops of excellent\r\nquality have been grown, and not the least suspicion has ever been raised\r\nregarding their use.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the adoption of the monolithic form for constructing the\r\nSouth Reservoir, the writer is so convinced as to its economy that had he\r\nto build this reservoir again, he would adopt the same method. Mr.\r\nBinckley, in drawing attention to the method of construction, has\r\noverlooked the fact that the cost of forms for a reservoir 30 ft. deep was\r\na very serious item, and warranted the adoption of this new method, not\r\nonly on account of economy but because of rapidity of construction; while,\r\nin the case of the Obispado Reservoir, which is very much shallower,\r\nsimpler forms could be and were adopted.\r\n\r\nMr. Saucedo's remarks regarding the repetition of the extraordinary floods\r\nof August, 1909, in September, 1910, are particularly interesting, and\r\nshow how abnormal conditions are in so dry a section of Mexico as the\r\nState of Nuevo Leon. These two floods, the writer believes, are among the\r\nmost instructive in North America, particularly when one remembers that\r\nprior to 1909 the average rainfall during a period of 15 years, was less\r\nthan 22 in. per annum.\r\n\r\n             TABLE 18.--COMPARISON OF VOLUME OF FLOODS, ETC.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+-----------+----------+-------+--------+\r\n  |                              |           | Maximum  |Cu. ft.| Annual |\r\n  |                              | Drainage  | recorded | /sec. | amount |\r\n  | River.                       | area, in  | flow, in | per   |   of   |\r\n  |                              | square    |  cu. ft. |square |  rain- |\r\n  |                              | miles.    | per sec. | mile. |  fall. |\r\n  +------------------------------+-----------+----------+-------+--------+\r\n  | Santa Catarina, Monterrey,   |           |          |       |        |\r\n  |   August 27th, 1907          |      544  | 235,000  | 432   |  22    |\r\n  | Estanzuela, near Monterrey,  |           |          |       |        |\r\n  |   August 28th, 1909          |       3.5 |   2,900  | 825   |  25    |\r\n  | Tansa, India                 |      52.5 |  35,000  | 666.7 | 101    |\r\n  | Krishna, India               |     345   | 118,000  | 342.6 | 258    |\r\n  | Coquitlam River, Vancouver   |     100   |  12,000  | 120   |147-189 |\r\n  | Sweetwater, Cal.             |     186   |  18,150  |  99   |  ...   |\r\n  | Delaware, Lambertville, N.
