He will do better\r\nstill to steep himself in the spirit of scientific evolution, and to\r\nbear in mind that incessant change is the law of the social, quite as\r\nmuch as of the physical and organic world, and that the most splendid\r\nblossoms have sprung from very humble germs. This is the supreme truth\r\nof science, and it is only when such a point of view has become quite\r\nfamiliar to us that we shall be neither troubled nor disconcerted\r\nby the sociological history of humanity; and however shocking or\r\nunnatural certain customs may appear, we shall guard ourselves against\r\nany feeling of indignation at them, and more especially against a\r\nthoughtless refusal to give credence to them, simply because they run\r\ncounter to our own usages and morality.\r\n\r\nAll that social science has a right to ask of the facts which it\r\nregisters is that they should be authentic; this duly proved, it\r\nonly remains to accept, classify, and interpret them. Faithful to\r\nthis method, without which there could be no science of sociology,\r\nI have here gathered together as proofs a number of singular facts,\r\nwhich, improbable as they may appear according to our pre-conceived\r\nnotions, and criminal according to our moral sense, are nevertheless\r\nmost instructive. Although in a former work I have taken care to\r\nestablish the relativity of morality, the explanations that I am about\r\nto make are not out of season; for the subject of this book is closely\r\nconnected with what, _par excellence_, we call “morals.”\r\n\r\nOn this point I must permit myself a short digression.\r\n\r\nNo one will pretend that our so-called civilised society has a very\r\nstrict practical morality, yet public opinion still seems to attach a\r\nparticular importance to sexual morality, and this is the expression of\r\na very real sentiment, the origin of which scientific sociology has no\r\ndifficulty in retracing. This origin, far from being a lofty one, goes\r\nback simply to the right of proprietorship in women similar to that in\r\ngoods and chattels--a proprietorship which we find claimed in savage,\r\nand even in barbarous countries, without any feeling of shame. During\r\nthe lower stages of social evolution, women are uniformly treated as\r\ndomestic animals; but this female live-stock are difficult to guard;\r\nfor, on the one hand, they are much coveted and are unskilful in\r\ndefending themselves, and on the other, they do not bend willingly to\r\nthe one-sided duty of fidelity that is imposed on them. The masters,\r\ntherefore, protect their own interests by a whole series of vexatious\r\nrestraints, of rigorous punishments, and of ferocious revenges, left at\r\nfirst to the good pleasure of the marital proprietors, and afterwards\r\nregulated and codified. In the chapter on adultery, especially, will\r\nbe found a great number of examples of this marital savagery. I have\r\npreviously shown, in my _Evolution de la Morale_, that the unforeseen\r\nresult of all this jealous fury has been to endow humanity, and more\r\nparticularly women, with the delicate sentiment of modesty, unknown to\r\nthe animal world and to primitive man.\r\n\r\nFrom this evolution of thousands of years there has finally resulted,\r\nin countries and races more or less civilised, a certain sexual\r\nmorality, which is half instinctive, and varies according to time\r\nand place, but which it is impossible to transgress without the risk\r\nof offending gravely against public opinion. Civilisations, however,\r\nwhether coarse or refined, differ from each other. Certain actions,\r\ncounted as blameworthy in one part of the world, are elsewhere held as\r\nlawful and even praiseworthy. In order to trace the origin of marriage\r\nand of the family, it is therefore indispensable to relate a number of\r\npractices which may be scandalous in our eyes. While submitting to this\r\nnecessity, I have done so unwillingly, and with all the sobriety which\r\nbefits the subject. I have striven never to depart from the scientific\r\nspirit, which purifies everything, and renders even indecency decent.\r\n\r\nLike the savages of to-day, our distant ancestors were very little\r\nremoved from simple animal existence. A knowledge of their physiology\r\nis nevertheless necessary to enable us to understand our own; for,\r\nhowever cultivated the civilised man may be, he derives from the humble\r\nprogenitors of his race a number of instincts which are energetic in\r\nproportion as they are of a low order. More or less deadened, these\r\ngross tendencies are latent in the most highly developed individuals;\r\nand when they sometimes break out suddenly in the actions of a man’s\r\nlife, or in the morals or literature of a people, they recall to us\r\nour very humble origin, and even show a certain mental and moral\r\nretrogression.\r\n\r\nNow it is to this primitive man, still in such a rudimentary state,\r\nthat we must go back for enlightenment on the genesis of all our social\r\ninstitutions. We must take him at the most distant dawn of humanity,\r\nfollow him step by step in his slow metamorphoses, without either\r\ndisparaging or poetising him; we must watch him rising and becoming\r\nmore refined through accumulated centuries, till he loses by degrees\r\nhis animal instincts, and at length acquires aptitudes, inclinations,\r\nand faculties that are truly human.\r\n\r\nNothing is better adapted to exemplify the evolution which binds our\r\npresent to our past and to our future than the sociological history of\r\nmarriage and of the family.\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken of the aim of this book, it remains for me to\r\njustify its method. This differs considerably from what the mass of\r\nthe public like far too well. But a scientific treatise must not take\r\npurely literary works for its models; and I can say to my readers,\r\nwith much more reason than old Rabelais, that if they wish to taste\r\nthe marrow, they must take the trouble to break the bone. My first\r\nand chief consideration is to assist in the foundation of a new\r\nscience--ethnographical sociology. Elegant and vain dissertations, or\r\nvague generalities, have no place here. It is by giving way to these,\r\nand in attempting to reap the harvest before sowing the seed, that\r\nmany authors have lost themselves in a pseudo-sociology, having no\r\nfoundation, and consequently no value.\r\n\r\nSocial science, if it is to be seriously constituted, must submit with\r\ndocility to the method of natural science. The first task, and the one\r\nwhich especially falls to the lot of the sociologists of the present\r\nday, is to collect the facts which will form materials for the future\r\nedifice. To their successors will fall the pleasure of completing and\r\nadorning it.\r\n\r\nThe present work is, therefore, above all, a collection of facts which,\r\neven if taken alone, are curious and suggestive. These facts have been\r\npatiently gleaned from the writings of ethnographers, travellers,\r\nlegists, and historians. I have classed them as well as I could,\r\nand naturally they have inspired me here and there with glimpses of\r\npossible inductions, and with some slight attempts at generalisation.\r\n\r\nBut whether the reader rejects or accepts my interpretations, the\r\ngroundwork of facts on which they rest is so instructive of itself that\r\na perusal of the following pages cannot be quite fruitless.\r\n\r\n  CH.

In comparing human bipeds with animals\r\nit has seemed as if we were disparaging these so-called demi-gods. It\r\nis to this blind prejudice that we must attribute the tardy rise of\r\nanthropological sociology. A deeper knowledge of biological science\r\nand of inferior races has at last cured us of this childish vanity.\r\nWe have decided to assign to man his true place in the organic world\r\nof our little globe. Granted that the human biped is incontestably\r\nthe most intelligent of terrestrial animals, yet, by his histological\r\ntexture, by his organs, and by the functions of these organs, he is\r\nevidently only an animal, and easily classed in the series: he is\r\na bimanous, mammiferous vertebrate. Not that by his most glorious\r\nrepresentatives, by those whom we call men of genius, man does not rise\r\nprodigiously above his distant relations of the mammal class; but, on\r\nthe other hand, by imperfectly developed specimens he descends far\r\nbelow many species of animals; for if the idiot is only an exception,\r\nthe man of genius is still more so. In fact, the lowest human races,\r\nwith whose anatomy, psychology, and sociology we are to-day familiar,\r\ncan only inspire us with feelings of modesty. They furnish studies\r\nin ethnography which have struck a mortal blow at the dreams of “the\r\nkingdom of man.”\r\n\r\nWhen once it is established that man is a mammal like any other,\r\nand only distinguished from the animals of his class by a greater\r\ncerebral development, all study of human sociology must logically be\r\npreceded by a corresponding study of animal sociology. Moreover, as\r\nsociology finally depends on biology, it will be necessary to seek in\r\nphysiological conditions themselves the origin of great sociological\r\nmanifestations. The first necessity of societies is that they should\r\nendure, and they can only do so on the condition of providing\r\nsatisfaction for primordial needs, which are the condition of life\r\nitself, and which imperatively dominate and regulate great social\r\ninstitutions. Lastly, if man is a sociable animal, he is not the only\r\none; many other species have grouped themselves in societies, where,\r\nhowever rudimentary they may be, we find in embryonic sketch the\r\nprincipal traits of human agglomerations. There are even species--as,\r\nfor example, bees, ants, and termites--that have created true\r\nrepublics, of complicated structure, in which the social problem has\r\nbeen solved in an entirely original manner. We may take from them more\r\nthan one good example, and more than one valuable hint.\r\n\r\nMy present task is to write the history of marriage and of the family.\r\nThe institution of marriage has had no other object than the regulation\r\nof sexual unions. These have for their aim the satisfaction of one of\r\nthe most imperious biological needs--the sexual appetite; but this\r\nappetite is only a conscious impulse, a “snare,” as Montaigne calls\r\nit, which impels both man and animal to provide, as far as concerns\r\nthem, for the preservation of their species--to “pay the ancestral\r\ndebt,” according to the Brahmanical formula. Before studying the sexual\r\nrelations, and their more or less regulated form in human societies, it\r\nwill not be out of place to say a few words on reproduction in general,\r\nto sketch briefly its physiology in so far as this is fundamental,\r\nand to show how tyrannical are the instincts whose formation has been\r\ndetermined by physiological causes, and which render the fiercest\r\nanimals mild and tractable. This is what I shall attempt to do in the\r\nfollowing chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Reproduction._\r\n\r\nStendhal has somewhere said that the beautiful is simply the outcome\r\nof the useful; changing the phrase, we may say that generation is\r\nthe outcome of nutrition. If we examine the processes of generation\r\nin very simple organisms, this great function seems to answer to a\r\nsuperabundance of nutritive materials, which, after having carried\r\nthe anatomic elements to their maximum volume, at length overflows\r\nand provokes the formation of new elements. As long as the new-born\r\nelements can remain aggregated with those which already constitute the\r\nindividual, as long as the latter has not acquired all the development\r\ncompatible with the plan of its being, there is simply growth. When\r\nonce the limit is attained that the species cannot pass, the organism\r\n(I mean a very rudimentary organism) reproduces itself commonly by a\r\nsimple division in two halves. It perishes in doubling itself and in\r\nproducing two beings, similar to itself, and having nothing to do but\r\ngrow. It is by means of this bi-partition that hydras, vorticellæ,\r\nalgæ, and the lowest mushrooms are generally propagated.\r\n\r\nIn the organisms that are slightly more complicated the function of\r\nreproduction tends to be specialised. The individual is no longer\r\ntotally divided; it produces a bud which grows by degrees, and detaches\r\nitself from the parent organism to run in its turn through the very\r\nlimited adventures of its meagre existence.\r\n\r\nBy a more advanced step in specialisation the function of reproduction\r\nbecomes localised in a particular cell, an ovule, and the latter,\r\nby a series of repeated bi-partitions, develops a new individual;\r\nbut it is generally necessary that the cellule destined to multiply\r\nitself by segmentation should at first dissolve by union with another\r\ncell. Through the action of various organic processes the two\r\ngenerating cells arrive in contact. The element which is to undergo\r\nsegmentation--the female element--then absorbs the element that is\r\nsimply impulsive; the element called male becomes impregnated with\r\nit, and from that moment it is fertilised, that is to say, capable of\r\npursuing the course of its formative work.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon, so simple in itself, of the conjugation of two\r\ncellules, is the foundation of reproduction in the two organic\r\nkingdoms as soon as the two sexes are separated. Whether the sexes are\r\nrepresented by distinct or united individuals, whether the accessory\r\norganic apparatus is more or less complicated, are matters of no\r\nconsequence; the essential fact reappears always and everywhere of the\r\nconjugation of two cellules, with absorption, in the case of superior\r\nanimals, of the male cellule by the female cellule.\r\n\r\nThe process may be observed in its most elementary form in the algæ and\r\nthe diatomaceæ, said to be conjugated. To form a reproductive cellule,\r\nor spore, two neighbouring cellules each throw out, one towards the\r\nother, a prolongation. These prolongations meet, and their sides\r\nabsorb each other at the point of contact; then the protoplasms of the\r\ntwo elements mingle, and at length the two cellules melt into a single\r\nreproductive cellule (_Spirogyra longata_).\r\n\r\nBetween this marriage of two lower vegetal cellules, which realises to\r\nthe letter the celebrated biblical words, “they shall be one flesh,” or\r\nrather one protoplasm, and the fundamental phenomenon of fecundation\r\nin the superior animals, including man, there is no essential\r\ndissimilarity. The ovule of the female and the spermatozoon of the male\r\nbecome fused in the same manner, with this difference only, that the\r\nfeminine cellule, the ovule, preserves its individuality and absorbs\r\nthe masculine cellule, or is impregnated by it.\r\n\r\nBut, simple as it is, this phenomenon of fecundation is the sole reason\r\nof the duration of bi-sexual species. Thanks to it, organic individuals\r\nthat are all more or less ephemeral,\r\n\r\n “Et, quasi cursores, vitaï lampada tradunt.”\r\n\r\n  (_Lucretius_, ii. 78.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many organised beings reproduction seems in reality the supreme\r\nobject of existence. Numbers of vegetables and of animals, even of\r\nanimals high in the series--as insects--die as soon as they have\r\naccomplished this great duty. Sometimes the male expires before having\r\ndetached himself from the female, and the latter herself survives just\r\nlong enough to effect the laying of eggs. Instead of laying eggs, the\r\nfemale cochineal fills herself with eggs to such a degree that she dies\r\nin consequence, and the tegument of her body is transformed into a\r\nprotecting envelope for the eggs.\r\n\r\nAt the not very distant time when animism reigned supreme, these facts\r\nwere attributed to calculations of design. Nature, it was believed,\r\noccupied herself chiefly with perpetuating organised species; as for\r\nindividuals, she disdained the care of them. We now know that Nature,\r\nas an anthropomorphic being, does not exist; that the great forces\r\ncalled natural are unconscious; that their blind action results,\r\nhowever, in the world of life, in a choice, a selection, a progressive\r\nevolution, or, to sum up, in the survival of the individuals best\r\nadapted to the conditions of their existence. Without any intention of\r\nDame Nature, the preservation of the species was necessarily, before\r\nanything else, the object of selection; and during the course of\r\ngeological periods primitive bi-partition gradually became transformed\r\nthrough progressive differentiation into bi-sexual procreation,\r\nrequiring the concurrence of special and complicated apparatus in\r\norder to be effected. But, at the same time as procreation, other\r\nfunctions also became differentiated by the formation of special\r\norgans; the nervous system vegetated around the _chorda dorsalis_;\r\nand, finally, conscious life awoke in the nervous centres. Thenceforth\r\nthe accomplishment of the great function of procreation assumed an\r\nentirely different aspect. In the lowest stages of the animal kingdom\r\nreproduction is effected mechanically and unconsciously. A paramœcium,\r\nobserved by M. Balbiani, produced in forty-two days, by a series\r\nof simple bi-partitions, 1,384,116 individuals, who very certainly\r\nhad not the least notion of the phenomena by which they transmitted\r\nexistence. But with superior animals it is very different; in their\r\ncase the act of procreation is a real efflorescence, not only physical,\r\nbut psychical. For the study that I am now undertaking it will not\r\nbe without use to recall the principal features of this amorous\r\nefflorescence, since it is, after all, the first cause of marriage and\r\nof the family. At the same time, not to lose our standpoint, it is\r\nimportant to bear in mind that at the bottom all this expenditure of\r\nphysical and psychical force has for motive and for result, both in man\r\nand animal, the conjugation of two generative cellules. Haeckel has\r\nwritten a dithyramb on this subject in his _Anthropogenia_, which is\r\nin the main so true that I take pleasure in quoting it--“Great effects\r\nare everywhere produced, in animated nature, by minute causes....\r\nThink of how many curious phenomena sexual selection gives rise to\r\nin animal life; think of the results of love in human life; now,\r\nall this has for its _raison d’être_ the union of two cellules....\r\nThere is no organic act which approaches this one in power and in the\r\nforce of differentiation. The Semitic myth of Eve seducing Adam for\r\nthe love of knowledge, the old Greek legend of Paris and Helen, and\r\nmany other magnificent poems, do they not simply express the enormous\r\ninfluence that sexual love and sexual selection have exercised since\r\nthe separation of the sexes? The influence of all the other passions\r\nwhich agitate the human heart cannot weigh in the balance with love,\r\nwhich inflames the senses and fascinates the reason. On the one hand,\r\nwe celebrate in love the source of the most sublime works of art,\r\nand of the noblest creations of poetry and of music; we venerate it\r\nas the most powerful factor in civilisation, as the prime cause of\r\nfamily life, and consequently of social life. On the other hand, we\r\nfear love as a destructive flame; it is love that drives so many to\r\nruin; it is love that has caused more misery, vice, and crime than\r\nall other calamities together. Love is so prodigious, its influence\r\nis so enormous on psychic life and the most diverse functions of\r\nthe nervous system, that in regard to it we are tempted to question\r\nthe supernatural effect of our natural explanation. Nevertheless,\r\ncomparative biology and the history of development conduct us surely\r\nand incontestably to the simplest, most remote source of love; that is\r\nto say, the elective affinity of two different cellules--the spermatic\r\ncell and the ovulary cell.”[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Rut and Love._\r\n\r\nIn a former work on the evolution of morality I have described the\r\nmanner in which the hereditary tendencies and instincts arise from\r\nhabit, induced in the nervous cellules by a sufficient repetition of\r\nthe same acts. The instinct of procreation has, and can have, no other\r\norigin. The animal species, during the long phases of their evolution,\r\nhave reproduced themselves unconsciously, and by very simple processes,\r\nwhich we may still observe in certain zoophytes. By degrees these mere\r\nsketches of animals have become perfected and differentiated, and\r\nhave acquired special organs over which the biological work has been\r\ndistributed; thenceforth the play of life has echoed in the nervous\r\ncentres, and has awakened in them impressions and desires, the energy\r\nof which strictly corresponds to the importance of the functions.\r\nNow, there is no more primordial function than procreation, since on\r\nit depends the duration even of the species; and for this reason the\r\nneed of reproduction, or the rut, breaks out in many animals like a\r\nkind of madness. The psychic faculties of the animal, whether great or\r\nsmall, are then over-excited, and rise above their ordinary level; but\r\nthey all tend to one supreme aim--the desire for reproduction. At this\r\nperiod the wildest and most unsociable species can no longer endure\r\nsolitude; both males and females seek each other; sometimes, even,\r\nthey are seen to form themselves into groups, or small provisional\r\nsocieties, which will dissolve again after the coupling time is over.\r\n\r\nEach period of rut is for animals a sort of puberty. The hair, the\r\nplumage, and the scales often assume rich tints which afterwards\r\ndisappear. Sometimes special epidermic productions appear in the male,\r\nand serve him for temporary weapons with which to fight his rivals, or\r\nfor ornaments to captivate the female. It is with a veritable frenzy\r\nthat the sexual union is accomplished among certain species. Thus Dr.\r\nGünther has several times found female toads dead, smothered by the\r\nembrace of the males.[2] Spallanzani was able to amputate the thighs\r\nof male frogs and toads during copulation, without diverting them from\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nIn the animal class which more particularly interests us, that of\r\nmammals, rut produces analogous, though less violent, phenomena. Now,\r\nin this case, we know that erotic fury is closely related to congestive\r\nphenomena, having for their seat the procreative glands, which swell\r\nin both male and female, and provoke in the latter a veritable process\r\nof egg-laying. We must not forget that man, in his quality of mammal,\r\nis subject to the common law, that female menstruation is essentially\r\nidentical with the intimate phenomena of rut in the females of mammals,\r\nand corresponds also to an ovarian congestion, or to the swelling and\r\nbursting of one or more of the Graafian follicles; it is, in short, a\r\nproduction of eggs. I need not lay stress on these facts, but it is\r\nright to recall them by the way, since they are the _raison d’être_ of\r\nsexual attraction, without which there would be neither marriage nor\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIf we are willing to descend to the foundation of things, we find\r\nthat human love is essentially rut in an intelligent being. It exalts\r\nall the vital forces of the man just as rut over-excites those of the\r\nanimal. If it seems to differ extremely from it, this is simply because\r\nin man the procreative need, a primordial need beyond all others, in\r\nradiating from highly developed nervous centres, awakens and sets in\r\ncommotion an entire psychic life unknown to the animal.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing surprising to the naturalist in this procreative\r\nexplosion, which evolves altruism out of egotism. We know too\r\nwell, however, that it has not appeared so simple a matter to many\r\nphilosophers and celebrated literary men, little familiar with\r\nbiological sciences. A belated metaphysician, Schopenhauer, who has\r\nlately become fashionable, adopting the ancient stereotyped doctrine\r\nwhich makes Nature an anthropomorphic personage, has gratuitously\r\ncredited her with quite a profound diplomatic design. According to him,\r\nit is a foregone conclusion that she should intoxicate individuals with\r\nlove, and thus urge them on, without their suspecting it, to sacrifice\r\nthemselves to the major interest of the preservation of the species.\r\nThe glance that we have just thrown on the processes of reproduction,\r\nfrom the paramœcium up to man, suffices to refute this dream. I will\r\nnot, however, dwell on this. What is here of great interest is to\r\ninquire how the superior animals comport themselves when pricked by\r\ndesire, and to note the principal traits of their sexual psychology;\r\nfor here again we shall have to recognise more than one analogy to\r\nwhat happens in regard to man; and we shall also see later that there\r\nexists both in the animal and the man some relation between the manner\r\nin which sexual attraction is felt and the greater or less aptitude for\r\ndurable pairing, and consequently for marriage and the family.\r\n\r\nWithout giving more time than is necessary to these short excursions\r\ninto animal psychology, it will be well to pause on them for a moment.\r\nThey throw a light on the sources of human sociology; they force us\r\nalso to break once for all with the abstract and trite theories which\r\nhave inspired, on the subject of marriage and the family, so much empty\r\nwriting and so many satiating trivialities. It is in animality that\r\nhumanity has its root; it is there, consequently, that we must seek the\r\norigins of human sociology.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Loves of Animals._\r\n\r\nIn a well-known mystic book occurs an aphorism which has become\r\ncelebrated--“Love is strong as death.” The expression is not\r\nexaggerated; we may even say that love is stronger than death, since\r\nit makes us despise it. This is perhaps truer with animals than with\r\nman, and is all the more evident in proportion as the rational will is\r\nweaker, and prudential calculations furnish no check to the impetuosity\r\nof desire. For the majority of insects to love and to die are almost\r\nsynonymous, and yet they make no effort to resist the amorous frenzy\r\nwhich urges them on. But however short may be their sexual career, one\r\nfact has been so generally observed in regard to many of them, that it\r\nmay be considered as the expression of a law--_the law of coquetry_.\r\nWith the greater number of species that are slightly intelligent, the\r\nfemale refuses at first to yield to amorous caresses. This useful\r\npractice may well have arisen from selection, for its result has\r\ninvariably been to excite the desire of the male, and arouse in him\r\nlatent or sleeping faculties. However brief, for example, may be\r\nthe life of butterflies, their pairing is not accomplished without\r\npreliminaries; the males court the females during entire hours, and for\r\na butterfly hours are years.\r\n\r\nWe can easily imagine that the coquetry of females is more common\r\namongst vertebrates. When the season of love arrives, many male fishes,\r\nwho are then adorned with extremely brilliant colours, make the most of\r\ntheir transient beauty by spreading out their fins, and by executing\r\nleaps, darts, and seductive manœuvres around the females.\r\n\r\nAmong fishes we begin already to observe another sexual law, at least\r\nas general as the law of coquetry, which Darwin has called the _law\r\nof battle_. The males dispute with each other for the females, and\r\nmust triumph over their rivals before obtaining them. Thus, whilst\r\nthe female sticklebacks are very pacific, their males are of warlike\r\nhumour, and engage in furious combats in their honour. In the same way\r\nthe male salmon, whose lower jaw lengthens into a crook during the\r\nbreeding season, are constantly fighting amongst each other.[3]\r\n\r\nThe higher we ascend in the animal kingdom the more frequent and more\r\nviolent become two desires in the males--the desire of appearing\r\nbeautiful, and that of driving away rivals. In South America, the males\r\nof the _Analis cristellatus_, a fissilingual saurian, have terrible\r\nbattles in the breeding season, the vanquished habitually losing his\r\ntail, which is bitten off by the victor. An old observer also describes\r\nthe amorous male alligator as “swollen to bursting, the head and tail\r\nraised, spinning round on the surface of the water, and appearing to\r\nassume the manner of an Indian chief relating his exploits.”[4]\r\n\r\nBut it is particularly among birds that the sentiment, or rather the\r\npassion, of love breaks out with most force and even poetry. It is\r\nespecially to birds that the celebrated Darwinian theory of sexual\r\nselection applies. It is difficult, indeed, not to attribute to this\r\ninfluence the production of the offensive and defensive arms, the\r\narmaments, the organs of song, the glands of odoriferous secretion\r\nof many male birds, also their courage, the warlike instinct of many\r\nof them, and lastly, the coquetry of the females. Let us listen to\r\nAudubon, as he relates the loves of the skylark:--“Each male is seen\r\nto advance with an imposing and measured step, swinging his tail,\r\nspreading it out to its full extent, then closing it again like a fan\r\nin the hands of a fine lady. Their brilliant notes are more melodious\r\nthan ever; they repeat them oftener than usual as they rest on the\r\nbranch or summit of some tall meadow reed. Woe to the rival who dares\r\nto enter the lists, or to the male who simply comes in sight of another\r\nmale at this moment of veritable delirium: he is suddenly attacked,\r\nand, if he is the weaker, chased beyond the limits of the territory\r\nclaimed by the first occupant. Sometimes several birds are seen engaged\r\nin these rude combats, which rarely last more than two or three\r\nminutes: the appearance of a single female suffices to put an instant\r\nend to their quarrel, and they all fly after her as if mad. The female\r\nshows the natural reserve of her sex, without which, even among larks,\r\nevery female would probably fail to find a male [this is a little too\r\nflattering for larks, and even for men]. When the latter,” continues\r\nAudubon, “flies towards her, sighing forth his sweetest notes, she\r\nretreats before her ardent admirer in such a way that he knows not\r\nwhether he is repulsed or encouraged.”[5]\r\n\r\nIn this little picture the author has noted all the striking traits of\r\nthe love of birds--the courage and jealousy of the male, his efforts\r\nto charm the female by his beauty and the sweetness of his song, and\r\nfinally, the coquetry of the female, who retreats, and thus throws oil\r\non the fire. The combats of the amorous males among many species of\r\nbirds have been observed and described minutely. “The large blue male\r\nherons,” says Audubon, “attack each other brutally, without courtesy;\r\nthey make passes with their long beaks and parry them like fencing\r\nmasters, often for half-an-hour at a time, after which the vanquished\r\none remains on the ground, wounded or killed.”[6]\r\n\r\nThe male Canadian geese engage in combats which last more than\r\nhalf-an-hour; the vanquished sometimes return to the charge, and the\r\nfight always takes place in an enclosed field, in the middle of a\r\ncircle formed by the band or clan of which the rivals form part.\r\n\r\nBut it is especially among the gallinaceæ that love inspires the\r\nmales with warlike fury. In this order of birds nearly all the males\r\nare of bellicose temperament. Our barn-door cock is the type of the\r\ngallinaceæ--vain, amorous, and courageous. Black cocks are also always\r\nready for a fight, and their females quietly look on at their combats,\r\nand afterwards reward the conqueror. We may observe analogous facts,\r\nonly somewhat masked, in savage, and even in civilised humanity. The\r\nconduct of certain females of the _Tetras urogallus_ is still more\r\nhuman. According to Kowalewsky, they take advantage of a moment when\r\nthe attention of the old cocks is entirely absorbed by the anxiety of\r\nthe combat, to run off with a younger male.[7]\r\n\r\nIf we may believe certain authors, these amorous duels must not always\r\nbe taken seriously. They are often nothing more than parades, tourneys,\r\nor courteous jousts, merely giving the males an opportunity of showing\r\ntheir beauty, address, or strength. This is the case, according to\r\nBlyth, with the _Tetras umbellus_.[8] In the same way, the grouse of\r\nFlorida (_Tetras cuspido_) are said to assemble at night to fight until\r\nthe morning with measured grace, and then to separate, having first\r\nexchanged formal courtesies.[9]\r\n\r\nBut among animals, as well as men, love has more than one string to\r\nhis bow. It is especially so with birds, who are the most amorous of\r\nvertebrates. They use several æsthetic means of attracting the female,\r\nsuch as beauty of plumage and the art of showing it, and also sweetness\r\nof song. Strength seems often to be quite set aside, and the eye and\r\near are alone appealed to by the love-stricken males.\r\n\r\nEvery one has seen our pigeons and doves courteously salute their\r\nmates. Many male birds execute dances and courting parades before\r\ntheir females. Thus, for example, do the _Tetras phasaniellus_ of\r\nNorth America, herons (_Cathartes jota_), vultures, etc. The male of\r\nthe red-wing struts about before his female, sweeping the ground with\r\nhis tail and acting the dandy.[10] The crested duck raises his head\r\ngracefully, straightens his silky aigrette, or bows to his female,\r\nwhile his throat swells and he utters a sort of gutteral sound.[11]\r\nThe male chaffinch places himself in front of the female, that she may\r\nadmire at her ease his red throat and blue head.[12]\r\n\r\nAll this æsthetic display is quite intentional and premeditated;\r\nfor while many pheasants and gallinaceous birds parade before their\r\nfemales, two pheasants of dull colour, the _Crossoptilon auritum_ and\r\nthe _Phasianus Wallichii_, refrain from doing so,[13] being apparently\r\nconscious of their modest livery.\r\n\r\nBirds often assemble in large numbers to compete in beauty before\r\npairing. The _Tetras cuspido_ of Florida and the little grouse of\r\nGermany and Scandinavia do this. The latter have daily amorous\r\nassemblies, or _cours d’amour_, of great length, which are renewed\r\nevery year in the month of May.[14]\r\n\r\nCertain birds are not content with their natural ornaments, however\r\nbrilliant these may be, but give the rein to their æsthetic desire\r\nin a way that may be called human. Mr. Gould assures us that some\r\nspecies of humming-birds decorate the exterior of their nests with\r\nexquisite taste, making use of lichens, feathers, etc. The bower-birds\r\nof Australia (_Chlamydera maculata_, etc.) construct bowers on the\r\nground, ornamented with feathers, shells, bones, and leaves. These\r\nbowers are intended to shelter the courting parades, and both males\r\nand females join in building them, though the former are more zealous\r\nin the work.[15] But in this erotic architecture the palm is carried\r\noff by a bird of New Guinea, the _Amblyornis inornata_, made known to\r\nus by M. O. Beccari.[16] This bird of rare beauty, for it is a bird of\r\nParadise, constructs a little conical hut to protect his amours, and\r\nin front of this he arranges a lawn, carpeted with moss, the greenness\r\nof which he relieves by scattering on it various bright-coloured\r\nobjects, such as berries, grains, flowers, pebbles, and shells. More\r\nthan this, when the flowers are faded, he takes great care to replace\r\nthem by fresh ones, so that the eye may be always agreeably flattered.\r\nThese curious constructions are solid, lasting for several years, and\r\nprobably serving for several birds. What we know of sexual unions among\r\nthe lower human races suffices to show how much these birds excel men\r\nin sexual delicacy.\r\n\r\nEvery one is aware that the melodious voice of many male birds\r\nfurnishes them with a powerful means of seduction. Every spring our\r\nnightingales figure in true lyric tournaments. Magpies, who are\r\nill-endowed from a musical point of view, endeavour to make up for this\r\norganic imperfection by rapping on a dry and sonorous branch, not\r\nonly to call the female, but also to charm her; we may say, in fact,\r\nthat they perform instrumental music. Another bird, the male of the\r\nweaver-bird, builds an abode of pleasure for himself, where he goes to\r\nsing to his companion.[17]\r\n\r\nAudubon has made one observation in regard to Canadian geese which\r\nis in every point applicable to the human species. The older the\r\nbirds are, he says, the more they abridge the preliminaries of their\r\namours. Their poetic and æsthetic sense has become blunted, and they go\r\nstraight to their object.\r\n\r\nWherever amongst the animal species supremacy in love is obtained\r\nby force, the male, nearly always the more ardent, has necessarily\r\nbecome, through the action of selection, larger, stronger, and better\r\narmed than the female. Such is in reality the case in regard to the\r\ngreater number of vertebrates; certain exceptions, however, exist,\r\nand naturally these are chiefly found among birds, as they are more\r\ninclined than other types to put a certain delicacy in their sexual\r\nunions. With many species of birds, indeed, the female is larger and\r\nstronger than the male. It is well known to be the same with certain\r\narticulates, and these facts authorise us to admit that there is no\r\nnecessary correlation between relative weakness and the female sex.\r\nMust we therefore conclude, with Darwin, that the females of certain\r\nbirds owe their excess of size and height to the fact that they have\r\nformerly contested also for the possession of the males? We may be\r\nallowed to doubt it. Almost universally, whether she is large or\r\nsmall, the female is less ardent than the male, and in the amorous\r\ntragi-comedy she generally plays, from beginning to end, a passive\r\n_rôle_; in the animal kingdom, as well as with mankind, amazons are\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nAmong birds and vertebrates generally the male is much more impetuous\r\nthan the female, and therefore he has no difficulty in accepting for\r\nthe moment any companion whatever.[18] This uncontrollable ardour\r\nsometimes even urges the males to commit actual attempts on the safety\r\nof the family. Thus it happens that the male canary (_Fringilla_\r\n_canaria_) persecutes his female while she is sitting, tears her nest,\r\nthrows out the eggs, and, in short, tries to excite his mate to become\r\nagain a lover, forgetting that she is a mother. In the same way our\r\ndomestic cock pursues the sitting hen when she leaves her eggs in order\r\nto feed.[19]\r\n\r\nWith the cousins-german of man, the mammals, sexual psychology has a\r\ngeneral resemblance to that of birds, but more often it is far less\r\ndelicate. And besides this, the sexual customs are naturally less\r\nrefined in proportion as the nervous centres of the species are less\r\nperfected. Thus the stupid tatoways meet by chance, smell each other,\r\ncopulate and separate with the greatest indifference. Our domestic dog\r\nhimself, although so civilised and affectionate, is generally as gross\r\nin his amours as the tatoway.\r\n\r\nWith birds, as we have seen, the law of battle plays an important\r\npart in sexual selection; but it is often counter-balanced by other\r\nless brutal influences. This is rarely the case in regard to mammals,\r\nwith whom especially the right of the strongest regulates the unions.\r\nThe law of battle prevails among aquatic as well as land mammals. The\r\ncombats of the male stags, in the rutting season, are celebrated. The\r\ncombatants have been known to succumb without being able to disentangle\r\ntheir interlocked antlers; but seals and male sperm-whales fight with\r\nequal fury, and so also do the males of the Greenland whale.[20]\r\n\r\nIn mammals, as in birds, and as in man, sexual desire raises and\r\nintensifies all the faculties, and seems to elevate the individual\r\nabove the level of normal life. Animals in a state of rut become\r\nbolder, more ferocious, and more dangerous. The elephant, pacific\r\nenough by nature, assumes a terrible fury in the rutting season. The\r\nSanskrit poems constantly recur to the simile of the elephant in rut to\r\nexpress the highest degree of strength, nobility, grandeur, and even\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nBut obviously I must not linger very long over the loves of the\r\nanimals. My chief object is to study sexual union and marriage\r\namongst human beings. The rut of animals and their sexual passions\r\nmerely interest us here as preliminary studies, which throw light on\r\nthe origin of analogous sentiments in mankind. Before leaving this\r\nsubject, however, it will be useful to note a few more facts which,\r\nfrom the point of view of sexual psychology, bring animals and men near\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\nThe old Cartesian paradox, which makes the animal an unconscious\r\nmachine, has still many partisans. A widely-prevailing prejudice\r\ninsists that animals always obey blind instincts, while man alone,\r\n_homo sapiens_, made after the image of God, weighs motives,\r\ndeliberates and chooses. Now, as procreation constitutes one of the\r\ngreat necessities of organised beings, and is an imperious law which no\r\nspecies can elude without disappearing, surely we ought to find amongst\r\nanimals the most exact regularity in the acts connected with it. Man\r\nalone ought to have the privilege of introducing caprice and free\r\nchoice into love. It is not so, however. On this side of his nature,\r\nas on all the others, man and animal approach, resemble, and copy each\r\nother. In his celebrated invocation to Venus, Lucretius has truly said,\r\nproclaiming the universal empire of the instinct of reproduction--\r\n\r\n          “Per te quoniam genus omne animantum\r\n  Concipitur, visitque exortum lumine solis.”\r\n\r\nThe animal, as well as the morally developed man, is capable of\r\npreference and individual passion; he does not yield blindly and\r\npassively to sexual love.\r\n\r\nAccording to observers and breeders, it is the female who is specially\r\nsusceptible of sentimental selection. The male, even the male of birds,\r\nis more ardent than the female, that is to say, more intoxicated and\r\nmore sharply pricked by instinct, and thus generally accepts any\r\nfemale whatever: all are alike to him. This is the rule, but it is not\r\nwithout exceptions; thus, the male pheasant shows a singular aversion\r\nto certain hens. Amongst the long-tailed ducks some females have\r\nevidently a particular charm for the males, and are courted more than\r\nthe others.[21] The pigeon of the dovecot shows a strong aversion to\r\nthe species modified by breeders, which he regards as deteriorated.[22]\r\nStallions are often capricious. It was necessary, for example, to\r\nuse stratagem in order to induce the famous stallion Monarch to beget\r\nGladiateur, who became still more famous.[23] Analogous facts have been\r\nobserved in regard to bulls.[24]\r\n\r\nBut it is more especially the females who introduce individual fancy\r\ninto sexual love. They are subject to singular and inexplicable\r\naversions. Mares sometimes resist, and it is necessary to deceive\r\nthem.[25] Female pigeons occasionally show a strong dislike to certain\r\nmales without apparent cause, and refuse to yield to their caresses. At\r\nother times a female pigeon, suddenly forgetting the constancy of her\r\nspecies, abandons her old mate or legitimate spouse to fall violently\r\nin love with another male. In the same way peahens sometimes show a\r\nlively attachment to a particular peacock.[26] High-bred bitches, led\r\nastray by passion, trample under foot their dignity, honour, and all\r\ncare for nobility of blood, to yield themselves to pug-dogs of low\r\nbreed or mongrel males. We are told of some who have persisted for\r\nentire weeks in these degrading passions, repulsing between times the\r\nmost distinguished of their own race.[27]\r\n\r\nEven among species noted for their fidelity it sometimes happens\r\nthat acts of sexual looseness are committed. The female pigeon often\r\nabandons her mate if the latter is wounded or becomes weak.[28]\r\nMisfortune is not attractive, and love does not always inspire heroism.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this short study of sexual union in the animal kingdom, I\r\nwill attempt to formulate the general propositions which may be drawn\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nAll organic species undergo the tyranny of the procreative function,\r\nwhich is a guarantee of the duration of the type.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of reproduction, when detached from all the complicated\r\naccessories which often conceal it in bi-sexual species, goes back\r\nessentially to the conjugation of two cellules.\r\n\r\nWith intelligent animals the procreative function echoes in the nervous\r\ncentres under the form of violent desires, which intensify all the\r\npsychic and physical faculties in awakening what we call love.\r\n\r\nAt its base, the love of animals does not differ from that of man.\r\nDoubtless it is never such a quintessence as the love of Petrarch,\r\nbut it is often more delicate than that of inferior races, and of\r\nill-conditioned individuals, who, though belonging to the human race,\r\nseek for nothing in love but, to use an energetic expression of Amyot’s\r\nPlutarch, to “get drunk.”\r\n\r\nBut among many of the animal species the sexual union induces a durable\r\nassociation, having for its object the rearing of young. In nobility,\r\ndelicacy, and devotion these unions do not yield precedence to many\r\nhuman unions. They deserve attentive study.\r\n\r\nI have now, therefore, to consider marriage and the family amongst the\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Anthropogenia_, p. 577.\r\n\r\n[2] Darwin, _Descent of Man_, p. 384.\r\n\r\n[3] Darwin, _Descent of Man_, p. 365.\r\n\r\n[4] Bartram, _Travels through Carolina_, p. 128 (1791).\r\n\r\n[5] Audubon, _Scènes de la Nature dans les États-Unis_, vol. i. p. 383.\r\n\r\n[6] _Ibid._ vol. ii. p. 66.\r\n\r\n[7] Darwin, _Descent of Man_, p. 399.\r\n\r\n[8] _Ibid._ p. 403.\r\n\r\n[9] Espinas, _Sociétés Animales_, p. 326.\r\n\r\n[10] Audubon, _loc. cit._, vol. i. p. 305.\r\n\r\n[11] _Ibid._ vol. ii. p. 50.\r\n\r\n[12] Darwin, _Descent of Man_, p. 438.\r\n\r\n[13] _Ibid._ p. 438.\r\n\r\n[14] Darwin, _Descent of Man_, p. 433.--Espinas, _Soc.

Nature (since the expression is\r\nconsecrated) proceeds sometimes by a lavish and lawless production,\r\nand sometimes by a sort of Malthusianism. Thus a cod lays every year\r\nabout a million eggs, on which she bestows no care, and of which\r\nonly the thousandth, or perhaps even the hundred thousandth part,\r\nescapes destruction; turtle-doves, on the contrary, only lay two eggs,\r\nbut nearly all their young attain maturity. In short, the species\r\nis maintained sometimes by prodigality of births and sometimes by a\r\ngreat expenditure of care and affection on the part of the parents,\r\nespecially of the female. It is almost superfluous to remark that\r\nanalogous facts are observed in human natality, according as it is\r\nsavage or civilised.\r\n\r\nWith animals, as with men, sexual association, when it endures, becomes\r\nmarriage, and results in the family, that is to say, a union of parents\r\nfor the purpose of protecting their young. The care of the male for his\r\nprogeny is more rare and tardy than that of the female. Among animals,\r\nas among men, the family is at first matriarchal, and it is only in\r\nthe higher stages of the animal kingdom that the male becomes a truly\r\nconstituent part of the family group; but even then, except among\r\ncertain species of birds, his chief care is less to rear the young than\r\nto govern in order to protect them. He plays the _rôle_ of a despotic\r\nchief, guiding the family when it remains undivided after the rearing\r\nof the young, and most frequently acting like a polygamous sultan,\r\nwithout the purely human scruple in regard to incest.\r\n\r\nJust as we find amongst animals the two principal types of the human\r\nfamily, the matriarchate and the patriarchate, or rather the maternal\r\nand paternal family, so we may observe equally among them all the forms\r\nof sexual union from promiscuity up to monogamy; but for enlightenment\r\non these interesting points of sociology, a rapid examination of the\r\nanimal kingdom is worth far more than all generalities.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Marriage and the Rearing of Young amongst Animals._\r\n\r\nWe shall leave entirely unnoticed the inferior kingdom of zoophytes,\r\nwhich are devoid of coalescing nervous centres, and consequently of\r\nconscious life. Even the lower types of molluscs do not begin to think\r\nof their progeny; they scatter their eggs as plants do their seeds,\r\nand leave them exposed to all chances. We must go to the superior\r\nmolluscs to see any care of offspring awakening. In this order, indeed,\r\nthe most highly developed species watch more or less over their eggs.\r\nThe taredos carry them stuck together in rings round their bodies;\r\nsnails often deposit them in damp ground, or in the trunk of a tree;\r\ncephalopods fix them in clusters round algæ, and sometimes watch them\r\ntill they open, after which they leave them to get on as they can in\r\nthe great world.\r\n\r\nWith spiders and insects the eggs are often the object of a solicitude\r\nand even prolonged forethought, which rejoice greatly the lovers of\r\ndesign. We must observe, however, that the males of spiders and that of\r\nthe greater number of insects entirely neglect their young; it is again\r\nin the female that the care for offspring first awakens. And this is\r\nnatural, for the eggs have been formed in her body; she has laid them,\r\nand has been conscious of them; they form, in a way, an integral part\r\nof her individuality.\r\n\r\nThe females of spiders also take care of their eggs after laying them,\r\nenclose them in a ball of thread arranged in cocoons, carry them about\r\nwith them, and at the moment of hatching set them free, one by one,\r\nfrom the envelope. Amongst some species there is even a certain rearing\r\nof the young. Thus the _Nemesia Eleonora_ lives for some time in her\r\ntrapped nest with her young, numbering from twenty to forty.[29]\r\n\r\nWith insects maternal forethought sometimes amounts to a sort of\r\ndivining prescience, which the doctrine of evolution alone can explain.\r\nThere is really something wonderful in the actions of a female insect,\r\nas she prepares for her descendants, whom she will never see any more\r\nthan she has seen her own parents, a special nourishment which differs\r\nfrom her own. It is thus that the sphinx, the pompilus, the sand-wasp,\r\nand the philanthus dig holes in the sand, in which they deposit with\r\nthe eggs a suitable food for the future larvæ.[30]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand these facts, apparently so inexplicable, we\r\nmust look not only to the powerful influence of selection, but also\r\nto the zoögenic past of the species. With the insect the perfect form\r\nis always the last which it assumes, the outcome of all the previous\r\nmetamorphoses. But the larval form, though actually transitory, must\r\nhave been for a long time the permanent form, and it had different\r\ntastes and needs. At the present time there are still numbers of\r\ninsects whose larval existence has a much longer duration than that of\r\nthe so-called perfect insect (May-flies, cockchafers). There are even\r\nlarvæ which reproduce themselves. Certain others, even though sterile,\r\nhave not lost the maternal instinct. Thus at the time of the hatching\r\nof the nymphs the larvæ of the termites assist the latter to get rid of\r\ntheir envelope. It is therefore probable that, though now transitory,\r\nthe larval forms of insects have formerly been permanent; they\r\nrepresent ancestral types, which evolution has by degrees metamorphosed\r\ninto insects that we call perfect. The larvæ, now actually sterile,\r\ndescend from ancestors which were not so, and in the larvæ of\r\ncertain species the maternal instinct has survived the reproductive\r\nfunction.[31]\r\n\r\nThis is doubtless the case with bees and ants; their workers must\r\nrepresent an ancestral form, having preserved the maternal fervour\r\nof its anterior state; the winged form, on the contrary, must be\r\nrelatively recent. It even appears probable that in the republics of\r\nants and bees the laborious workers may have succeeded, in a certain\r\nway, in getting rid of sexual needs which cause animals and even men\r\nto commit so many mad actions. With them the old maternal instinct has\r\ntaken the place ceded to it by sexual instinct, and has become enlarged\r\nand ennobled. Their affection is no longer exclusively confined to a\r\nfew individuals produced from their own bowels, but is shared by all\r\nthe young of the association. In their sub-œsophagian ganglion one care\r\ntakes precedence of all others--the care of rearing the young. This is\r\ntheir constant occupation and the great duty to which they sacrifice\r\ntheir lives. Maternal love, usually so selfish, expands with them into\r\nan all-embracing social affection. It is not impossible that a psychic\r\nmetamorphosis of the same kind may one day take place in future human\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nIt would even seem that the workers appreciate the faculty of\r\nreproduction all the more for being deprived of it. The queen bee, or\r\nrather the fertile female, who is the common mother of all the tribe,\r\nhas every possible care lavished on her, and is publicly mourned when\r\nshe dies. If she happens to perish before having young, and then cannot\r\nbe replaced, the virgin workers despair of the republic; losing for\r\never “les longs espoirs et les vastes pensées,” they give way to an\r\nincurable and mortal pessimism.\r\n\r\nOne primitive form of the family, the matriarchate, which we shall\r\nstudy later, is realised, even in an exaggerated form, by ants and\r\nbees. In human societies we shall only find very faint imitations of\r\nthis system, which has been so strictly carried out by the primates of\r\nthe invertebrates, and which seems to have inspired the ancients with\r\ntheir fables about the amazons.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrated species, with the exception of mankind, have founded\r\nno society that can be even distantly compared to that of hymenoptera\r\nand of ants. With nearly all fishes and amphibia the parents are very\r\npoorly developed as regards consciousness, and take no care of their\r\neggs after fecundation. Some species of fishes are, however, endowed\r\nwith a certain familial instinct, and strange to say, here it is the\r\nmale who tends his offspring. So true is it, that the imaginary being\r\ncalled Nature has no preference for any special methods, and that in\r\nher eyes all processes are good on the one condition that they succeed!\r\nThus the Chinese _Macropus_ gathers the fecundated eggs into his\r\njaws, deposits them in the midst of the froth and mucous exuding from\r\nhis mouth, and watches over the young when they are hatched.[32] The\r\nmale of synagnathous fishes and the sea-horses carry their eggs in an\r\nincubating pouch; the _Chromis paterfamilias_, of the lake of Tiberias,\r\nprotects and nourishes in his mouth and bronchial cavity hundreds of\r\nsmall fishes.[33]\r\n\r\nOther fishes also have more or less care for their young. Salmon and\r\ntrout deposit their eggs in a depression which they have hollowed out\r\nin the sand for the purpose. Fishes, belonging to various families,\r\nconstruct nests and watch over the young when hatched (_Cranilabrus\r\nmassa_, _Cranilabrus melops_). Often again it is the male who\r\nundertakes all the work. Thus the male of the _Gasterosteus leiurus_ is\r\nincessantly occupied in fetching the young ones home, and driving away\r\nall enemies, including the mother.[34] The male stickleback, who is\r\npolygamous, builds a nest and watches with solicitude over the safety\r\nand rearing of the young.[35]\r\n\r\nMany reptiles are unnatural parents; some, however, already possess\r\nsome degree of familial instinct. Thus several males of the batrachians\r\nassist the female to eject her eggs. The male accoucheur toad rolls the\r\neggs round his feet, and carefully carries them thus. The Surinam toad,\r\nthe _Pipa Americana_, after having aided the female in the operation of\r\nlaying the eggs, places them on the back of his companion, in little\r\ncutaneous cavities formed for their reception.[36]\r\n\r\nThe _Cobra capella_ bravely defends its eggs. The saurians often live\r\nin couples, and the females of crocodiles escort their new-born little\r\nones. Female tortoises go so far as to shelter their young in a sort of\r\nnest.[37]\r\n\r\nBut it is especially among birds and mammals that we find forms\r\nof union or association very similar to marriage and the family\r\nin the human species. Nothing is more natural; for anatomical and\r\nphysiological analogy must of necessity lead in its train the analogy\r\nof sociology. There is no more uniformity either amongst mammals than\r\namongst men; the needs, the habitat, and the necessities of existence\r\ndominate everything, and in order to secure adjustment to these,\r\nrecourse is had to various processes.\r\n\r\nLike men, birds live sometimes in promiscuity, and sometimes in\r\nmonogamy or polygamy; the familial instinct is also very unequally\r\ndeveloped among them. Sometimes even we find their conjugal customs\r\nmodified by the kind of life they lead. Thus the wild duck, which is\r\nstrictly monogamous in a wild state, becomes very polygamous when\r\ndomesticated, and it is the same with the guinea fowl. Civilisation\r\ndepraves these birds, as it does some men. As may be supposed, it is\r\ngenerally the animals living in troops who are degraded most easily by\r\nhabitual promiscuity. But this is not always the case; the character\r\nof the animal, his mode of life, and the degree of morality previously\r\nacquired, determine his manner of acting. It is probable also that\r\ncertain animals, living in troops during the breeding season, have\r\nformerly been less sociable than at present, for they leave the troop\r\nand retire apart in couples as soon as they have paired. Social life is\r\nburdensome to them.\r\n\r\nIt is especially interesting to study the various modes of conjugal\r\nand familial association amongst birds. This may easily be inferred\r\nfrom the ardour, the variety, and the delicacy they bring to their\r\namours; the moral level among them, to borrow a human expression, is\r\nvery diverse, according to the species. There are some birds absolutely\r\nfickle and even debauched--as, for example, the little American\r\nstarling (_Icterus pecoris_), which changes its female from day to day;\r\nthat is to say, it is in the lowest stage of sexual union, a debauched\r\npromiscuity, which we only exceptionally find in some hardly civilised\r\nhuman societies.[38] The starling, nevertheless, is not ferocious, like\r\nthe asturides, to whom, according to Brehm, love seems unknown, and\r\namongst whom the female devours her male, the father and the mother\r\nfeast on their own young, and the latter, when full grown, willingly\r\neat their parents. These ferocious habits denote a very feeble moral\r\ndevelopment. But if we may believe a French missionary, Mgr. Farand,\r\nbishop of the Mackenzie territory, similar customs still prevail among\r\nthe Redskins of the extreme north.[39] We shall not, therefore, be too\r\nmuch scandalised at the birds. These cases of moral grossness are,\r\nbesides, rare enough with them.\r\n\r\nOther species, while they have renounced promiscuity, are still\r\ndetermined polygamists. The gallinaceæ are particularly addicted to\r\nthis form of conjugal union, which is so common, in fact, with mankind,\r\neven when highly civilised and boasting of their practice of monogamy.\r\nOur barn-door cock, vain and sensual, courageous and jealous, is a\r\nperfect type of the polygamous bird. But the polygamous habits of the\r\ngallinaceæ do not prevent them from experiencing very strong sexual\r\npassion. When seized by this frenzy of desire, some of them appear to\r\nbe senseless of all danger. The firing of a gun, for example, does not\r\nalarm a male grouse when swinging his head and whistling to charm his\r\nfemale;[40] but this ardour does not hinder him from being a fickle\r\nanimal, always in search of new adventures, and always seeking fresh\r\nmates.[41]\r\n\r\nThese examples of wandering fancy are for the most part rare among\r\nbirds, the majority of whom are monogamous, and even far superior to\r\nmost men in the matter of conjugal fidelity.\r\n\r\nNearly all the rapacious animals, even the stupid vultures, are\r\nmonogamous. The conjugal union of the bald-headed eagle appears even to\r\nlast till the death of one of the partners. This is indeed monogamic\r\nand indissoluble marriage, though without legal constraint.[42]\r\nGolden eagles live in couples, and remain attached to each other for\r\nyears without even changing their domicile.[43] But these instances,\r\nhonourable as they are, have nothing exceptional in them; strong\r\nconjugal attachment is a sentiment common to many birds.\r\n\r\nWith the female Illinois parrot (_Psittacus pertinax_) widowhood and\r\ndeath are synonymous, a circumstance rare enough in the human species,\r\nyet of which birds give us more than one example. When, after some\r\nyears of conjugal life, a wheatear happens to die, his companion\r\nhardly survives him a month. The male and female of the _panurus_\r\nare always perched side by side. When they fall asleep, one of them,\r\ngenerally the male, tenderly spreads its wing over the other. The\r\ndeath of one, says Brehm, is fatal to its companion. The couples of\r\ngolden wood-peckers, of doves, etc., live in a perfect union, and\r\nin case of widowhood experience a violent and lasting grief. The\r\nmale of a climbing wood-pecker, having seen his mate die, tapped day\r\nand night with his beak to recall the absent one; then at length,\r\ndiscouraged and hopeless, he became silent, but never recovered his\r\ngaiety (Brehm). These examples of a fidelity that stands every test,\r\nand of the religion of memory, although much more frequent in the\r\nunions of birds than in those of human beings, are not, however, the\r\nunfailing rule. With birds, as with men, there seems to be a good\r\nnumber of irregular cases--individuals of imperfect moral development\r\nand of fickle disposition. This may be inferred from the facility with\r\nwhich, among certain species of monogamous birds, the dead partner is\r\nreplaced. Jenner, who introduced vaccination, relates that in Wiltshire\r\nhe has seen one of a couple of magpies killed seven days in succession,\r\nand seven times over immediately replaced. Analogous facts have been\r\nobserved of jays, falcons, and starlings. Now, when it concerns animals\r\nthat are paired, each substitution must correspond to a desertion, the\r\nmore so as the observations were made in the same locality and in the\r\nheight of the breeding season.[44]\r\n\r\nVery peculiar fancies sometimes arise in the brains of certain birds.\r\nThus we see birds of distinct species pairing, and this even in a wild\r\nstate. These illegitimate unions have been observed between geese and\r\nbarnacle geese, and between black grouse and pheasants.\r\n\r\nDarwin relates a case of this kind of passion suddenly appearing in\r\na wild duck. The fact is related by Mr. Hewitt as follows:--“After\r\nbreeding a couple of seasons with her own mallard, she at once shook\r\nhim off on my placing a male pintail in the water. It was evidently\r\na case of love at first sight, for she swam about the new-comer\r\ncaressingly, though he appeared evidently alarmed and averse to her\r\novertures of affection. From that hour she forgot her old partner.\r\nWinter passed by, and the next spring the pintail seemed to have\r\nbecome a convert to her blandishments, for they nested and produced\r\nseven or eight young ones.”[45] It is difficult not to attribute\r\nsuch deviations as these to motives similar to those by which we are\r\nourselves actuated--to passion, caprice, or depravity. They certainly\r\ncannot be accounted for by the theory of mechanical and immutable\r\ninstinct. Such facts clearly prove that animal psychology, although\r\nless complicated than our own, does not differ essentially from it,\r\nand consequently throws much light on our present investigation. The\r\nadventure of the wild duck, for example, may, without any alteration,\r\nbe read as a human adventure, proving for the hundred-thousandth\r\ntime that the heart, or what we call by that name, is versatile; that\r\nconjugal fidelity does not always resist a strong impression arising\r\nfrom a chance encounter; that novelty has a disturbing effect; and,\r\nfinally, that indifference and coldness can rarely hold out against\r\nthe persistent advances of one who loves ardently enough not to yield\r\nto discouragement. Dante has already made this last reflection in his\r\ncelebrated line--\r\n\r\n  “Amor ch’a nullo amato amar perdona.”\r\n\r\nTo quote Dante _à propos_ of the illicit amours of a pintail and a wild\r\nduck may shock the learned, but the aptness of the quotation proves\r\nonce more the essential identity of the animal and human organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Family amongst Animals._\r\n\r\nIf the study of the modes of sexual union amongst animals is not\r\nuseless to the sociologist, that of the animal family is at least\r\nquite as interesting. This latter confirms the inductions of theorists\r\nrelative to the primitive form of the human family. The animal family\r\nis especially maternal. The female of birds, immediately she has laid\r\nher eggs, experiences a sort of intoxication; to sit becomes for her\r\nan imperious need, which completely transforms her moral nature. In\r\nJanuary 1871, during the bombardment of Paris, a German shell, bursting\r\nin the loft of a house inhabited by one of my friends, was powerless\r\nto disturb a female pigeon absolutely enchained by the passion of\r\nincubation.\r\n\r\nIt is amongst birds that the animal family is best constituted; this,\r\nhowever, differs much according to the species, especially as regards\r\nthe participation of the male in the rearing of the young.\r\n\r\nAmongst ducks, the male has no care for his progeny. The male eider\r\nresembles the duck in this respect (Audubon). Male turkeys do much\r\nworse: they often devour the eggs of their females, and thus oblige the\r\nlatter to hide them.[46] Female turkeys join each other with their\r\nyoung ones for greater security, and thus form troops of from sixty to\r\neighty individuals, led by the mothers, and carefully avoiding the old\r\nmales, who rush on the young ones and kill them by violent blows on the\r\nhead with their beaks.[47]\r\n\r\nAmong certain species of gallinaceæ the male leaves to the female the\r\ncare of incubation and of rearing the young. During this time he is\r\nrunning after adventures, but returns when the young are old enough\r\nto follow him and form a docile band under his government.[48] It\r\nis important to notice that, amongst birds, the fathers devoid of\r\naffection generally belong to the less intelligent species, and are\r\nmost often polygamous. It seems, therefore, that polygamy is not very\r\nfavourable to the development of paternal love.[49]\r\n\r\nBut bad fathers are rare amongst birds. Often, on the contrary, the\r\nmale rivals the female in love for the young; he guards and feeds her\r\nduring incubation, and sometimes even sits on the eggs with her. The\r\ncarrier pigeon feeds his female while she is sitting;[50] the Canadian\r\ngoose[51] and the crow do the same; more than that, the latter takes\r\nhis companion’s place at times, to give her some relaxation. The blue\r\nmarten behaves in the same manner.[52] Among many species, male and\r\nfemale combine their efforts without distinction of sex; they sit in\r\nturn, and the one who is free takes the duty of feeding the one who is\r\noccupied. This is the custom of the black-coated gull,[53] the booby\r\nof Bassan,[54] the great blue heron,[55] and of the black vulture.[56]\r\nAccording to Audubon, the blue bird of America works so ardently at the\r\npropagation of its species that a single brood does not satisfy him;\r\neach couple, therefore, exerts itself zealously, rearing two or three\r\nbroods at the same time, the female sitting on one, while the male\r\nfeeds the little ones of the preceding brood.[57]\r\n\r\nBut however violent the love of birds for their progeny may be, it\r\nlasts only a short time, and is suddenly extinguished when the young\r\ncan manage for themselves. It is then quite surprising to see the\r\nparents drive away by strokes of the beak the little ones they had been\r\nnursing with such devoted tenderness a few days before. The birds of\r\nseveral species, however, teach their young to fly before separating\r\nfrom them. The white-headed sea-eagle carries them on its back to give\r\nthem lessons in flying; grebes, swans, and eiders teach their young to\r\nswim, etc. But the family is only of short duration among birds and\r\nanimals generally, unless, as is the case with some gallinaceæ, the\r\nmale keeps a few of his daughters to enrich his harem. As a matter\r\nof fact, both with birds and other animals, the paternal or maternal\r\nsentiment hardly lasts longer than the rearing time. When once the\r\nyoung are full grown, the parents no longer distinguish them from\r\nstrangers of their species, and it is thus even with monogamic species\r\nwhen the conjugal tie is lifelong; the marriage alone endures, but the\r\nfamily is intermittent and renewed with every brood. We may remark that\r\nit is almost the same with certain human races of low development. But,\r\nbefore speaking of man, it will be well to investigate conjugal union\r\nand the family amongst the animals nearest to man--the mammals.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of duration and strength of the affections,\r\nor that which we as men should call their morality, the mammals are\r\nfar from occupying the first rank in the animal hierarchy; many birds\r\nare very superior to them. We find, however, great differences in\r\nthe morals, according to the species. Many mammals have stopped at\r\nthe most brutal promiscuity; males and females unite and separate\r\nat chance meetings, without any care for the family arising in the\r\nmind of the male. The females of mammals being always weaker than\r\nthe males, no sexual association comparable to polyandry is possible\r\nin this class, since, even if she wished it, the female could not\r\nsucceed in collecting a seraglio of males. But as to polygamy, it is\r\nquite different, and this is very common with mammals, especially\r\nwith the sociable kinds, living in flocks. It is even a necessity\r\nof the struggle for existence. Sociability generally proceeds from\r\nweakness. The species that are badly armed for fierce combats, and\r\nthat have besides some difficulty in finding food, are glad to live in\r\nassociation. Union is strength. The ruminants, for example, do this.\r\nCertain carnivorous animals, ill-furnished with teeth and claws, dogs\r\nalso, and jackals, live in troops for the same reason--that of opposing\r\na respectable front to the enemy. This life in common is certainly\r\nfavourable to the development of social virtues; it cannot but soften\r\nprimitive cruelty, and develop altruistic qualities; but it is little\r\nconducive to sexual restraint and monogamy. Thus the greater number of\r\nsociable mammals are polygamous. The ruminants live in hordes composed\r\nof females and young, grouped around a male who protects them, but who\r\nexpels his rivals and becomes a veritable chief of a band. Very various\r\nspecies compose familial societies in the same manner, and strongly\r\nresembling each other.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indian adult elephant renounces the solitary life which strong\r\nanimals generally adopt, it is in order to found a little polygamous\r\nsociety, from which he expels all the males weaker than himself.[58]\r\n\r\nThe moufflons of Europe and of the Atlas also form little societies of\r\nthe same kind in the breeding season.[59]\r\n\r\nAmong the walrus, says Brehm, the male, who is of very jealous\r\ntemperament, collects around him from thirty to forty females, without\r\ncounting young, making altogether a polygamous family sometimes\r\namounting to a hundred and twenty individuals.\r\n\r\nThe male of the Asiatic _antilope saiga_ is inordinately polygamous; he\r\nexpels all his rivals, and forms a harem numbering sometimes a hundred\r\nfemales.[60]\r\n\r\nThe polygamic _régime_ of animals is far from extinguishing\r\naffectionate sentiments in the females towards their husband and\r\nmaster. The females of the guanaco lamas, for example, are very\r\nfaithful to their male. If the latter happens to be wounded or killed,\r\ninstead of running away, they hasten to his side, bleating and offering\r\nthemselves to the shots of the hunter in order to shield him, while, on\r\nthe contrary, if a female is killed, the male makes off with all his\r\ntroop; he only thinks of himself.\r\n\r\nIn regard to mammals, there is no strict relation between the\r\ndegree of intellectual development and the form of sexual union. The\r\ncarnivorous animals often live in couples for the reason previously\r\ngiven; but this is not an absolute rule, for the South African lion is\r\nfrequently accompanied by four or five females.[61] Bears, weasels,\r\nwhales, etc., on the contrary, generally go in couples. Sometimes\r\nspecies that are very nearly allied have different conjugal customs;\r\nthus the white-cheeked peccary lives in troops, whilst the white-ringed\r\npeccary lives in couples.[62]\r\n\r\nThere is the same diversity in the habits of monkeys. Some are\r\npolygamous and others monogamous. The wanderoo (_Macacus silenus_) of\r\nIndia has only one female, and is faithful to her until death.[63] The\r\n_Cebus capucinus_, on the contrary, is polygamous.[64]\r\n\r\nThose cousins-german of man, the anthropoid apes, have sometimes\r\nadopted polygamy and sometimes monogamy. Savage tells us that the\r\n_Gorilla gina_ forms small hordes, consisting of a single adult male,\r\nwho is the despotic chief of many females and a certain number of young.\r\n\r\nChimpanzees are sometimes polygamous and sometimes monogamous. The\r\npolygamous family of monkeys is always subject to the monarchic\r\n_régime_. The male, who is at the same time the chief, is despotic; he\r\nexacts a passive obedience from his subordinates, and he expels the\r\nyoung males as soon as they are old enough to give umbrage to him. To\r\nsum up, he is at once the father, the protector, and the tyrant of\r\nthe band. Nevertheless, the females are affectionate to him, and the\r\nmost zealous among them prove it by assiduously picking the lice from\r\nhim, which, with monkeys, is a mark of great tenderness.[65] But the\r\nmaster who has been thus flattered and cringed to sometimes comes to a\r\nbad end. One fine day, when old age has rendered him less formidable,\r\nwhen he is no longer capable of proving at every instant that right\r\nmust yield to might, the young ones, so long oppressed, rebel, and\r\nassassinate this tyrannous father. We must here remark, that whatever\r\nthe form of sexual association among mammals, the male has always\r\nmuch less affection for the young than the female. Even in monogamous\r\nspecies, when the male keeps with the female, he does so more as chief\r\nthan as father. At times he is much inclined to commit infanticides and\r\nto destroy the offspring, which, by absorbing all the attention of his\r\nfemale, thwart his amours. Thus, among the large felines, the mother is\r\nobliged to hide her young ones from the male during the first few days\r\nafter birth, to prevent his devouring them.\r\n\r\nI shall here conclude this very condensed study of sexual association\r\nand the family in the animal kingdom. My object is not so much to\r\nexhaust the subject, as to bring into relief the analogies existing\r\nbetween man and the other species. The facts which have been cited\r\nare amply sufficient for this purpose, and we may draw the following\r\ngeneral conclusions from them:--\r\n\r\nIn the first place there is no premeditated design in nature; any mode\r\nof reproduction, of sexual association and of rearing of young that is\r\ncompatible with the duration of the species may be adopted. But in a\r\ngeneral manner it may be said that a sort of antagonism exists between\r\nthe multiplicity of births and the degree of protection bestowed on the\r\nyoung by the parents.\r\n\r\nA rough outline of the family is already found in the animal kingdom;\r\nit is sometimes patriarchal, as with sticklebacks, etc., but most often\r\nit is matriarchal. In the latter case the female is the centre of it,\r\nand her love for the young is infinitely stronger and more devoted than\r\nthat of the male. This is especially true of mammals, with whom the\r\nmale is generally an egoist, merely protecting the family in his own\r\npersonal interest.\r\n\r\nThe familial instinct, more or less developed, exists in the greater\r\nnumber of vertebrates, and in many invertebrates. From an early period\r\nit must have been an object of selection, since it adds considerably to\r\nthe chances of the duration of the species. With some species (ants,\r\nbees, termites) this instinct has expanded into a wide social love,\r\nresulting in the production of large societies of complex structure,\r\nin which the family, as we understand it, is unknown. I lay stress on\r\nthis fact, for it is of great importance in theoretical sociology; it\r\nproves, in fact, that large and complicated societies, with division\r\nof social labour, can be maintained without the institution of the\r\nfamily. We are not, therefore, warranted in pretending, as is usually\r\ndone, that the family is absolutely indispensable, and that it is the\r\n“cellule” of the social organism. Let us observe, by the way, that the\r\nexpression “social organism” is simply metaphorical, and we must beware\r\nof taking it literally, as Herbert Spencer, with a strange naïveté,\r\nseems to have done. Societies are agglomerations of individuals in\r\nwhich a certain order is necessarily established; but it is almost\r\npuerile to seek for, and to pretend to find in them, an actual\r\norganisation, comparable, for example, to the anatomic and physiologic\r\nplan of a mammal.\r\n\r\nTerminating this short digression, I revert to my subject by summing up\r\nthe results of our examination of sexual associations among the animals.\r\n\r\nIn regard to marriage, as well as to the family, nature has no\r\npreference; all means are welcome to her, provided the species profits\r\nby them, or, at least, does not suffer too much from them.\r\n\r\nWe find amongst animals temporary unions, at the close of which the\r\nmale ceases absolutely to care for the female; but we also find,\r\nespecially among birds, numbers of lasting unions, for which the word\r\nmarriage is not too exalted. It does not appear that polyandry--that\r\nis, a durable society between one female and many males--has been\r\npractised by animals. The female, nearly always weaker than the male,\r\ncould not reduce a number of them to sexual servitude, and the latter\r\nhave never been tempted to share one female systematically. On the\r\ncontrary, they are often polygamous. But it is especially amongst\r\nmammals that polygamy is common, and it must often have had its _raison\r\nd’être_ either in the sexual proportion of births, or in a greater\r\nmortality of males. These are reasons I shall have to refer to later,\r\nin speaking of human polygamy.\r\n\r\nBut if polygamy is frequent with mammals, it is far from being the\r\nconjugal _régime_ universally adopted; monogamy is common, and is\r\nsometimes accompanied by so much devotion, that it would serve as an\r\nexample to human monogamists.\r\n\r\nIt is important also to notice that, in regard to animals, the mode of\r\nsexual association may vary without much difficulty. No species is of\r\nnecessity and always restricted to such or such a form of sexual union.\r\nAn animal belonging to a species habitually monogamous may very easily\r\nbecome polygamous. In short, there does not seem to be any relation\r\nbetween the degree of intelligence in a species and its conjugal\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters it will be seen that, in great measure, these\r\nobservations do not apply exclusively to animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Espinas, _Soc.

The method of evolution\r\nrequires us to begin our inquiry with the lowest forms of sexual\r\nassociation, and there is none lower, morally and intellectually, than\r\npromiscuity; that is to say, a social condition so gross that within\r\na group, a horde, or a tribe, all the women belong, without rule or\r\ndistinction, to all the men. In a society so bestial there is surely\r\nno room for what we call love, however grossly we may understand this\r\nsentiment. There is no choice, no preference; the sexual need is\r\nreduced to its simplest expression, and absolutely debased to the level\r\nof the nutritive needs; love is no more than a hunger or thirst of\r\nanother kind; there is no longer any distinction between the man and\r\nthe tatoway.\r\n\r\nSome sociologists have affirmed, without hesitation, that community\r\nof women represented a primitive and necessary stage of the sexual\r\nassociations of mankind. Surely they would have been less dogmatic\r\non this point if, before approaching human sociology, they had first\r\nconsulted animal sociology, as we have done. We have seen that many\r\nvertebrated animals are capable of a really exclusive and jealous\r\npassion, even when they are determined polygamists. As a matter of\r\nfact, the vertebrates with whom love is merely a need, like any other,\r\nseem to be a very small minority. Some among them, especially birds,\r\nare models of fidelity, constancy, and devoted attachment, which may\r\nwell inspire man with feelings of modesty. Mammals, while less delicate\r\nin their love than many birds, are, however, for the most part, already\r\non a moral level incompatible with promiscuity. The mammals nearest to\r\nman, those whom we may consider as the effigies of our nearest animal\r\nancestors, the anthropoid apes, are sometimes monogamous and sometimes\r\npolygamous, but, as a rule, they cannot endure promiscuity. Now, this\r\nfact manifestly constitutes a very strong presumption against the\r\nbasis of the theory according to which promiscuity has been, with the\r\nhuman species, the primitive and necessary stage of sexual unions. Do\r\nwe thus mean to say that there is no example of promiscuity in human\r\nsocieties, primitive or not? Far from it. It would be impossible\r\nto affirm this without neglecting a large number of facts observed\r\nin antiquity or observable in our own day. But we are warranted in\r\nbelieving that the very inferior stage of promiscuity has never been\r\nother than exceptional in humanity. If it has existed here and there,\r\nit is that by the very reason of the relative superiority of his\r\nintelligence, man is less rigorously subject to general laws, and that\r\nhe knows sometimes how to modify or infringe them; there is more room\r\nfor caprice in his existence than in the life of the animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Some Cases of Human Promiscuity._\r\n\r\nHuman groups have, then, practised promiscuity, and it is not quite\r\nimpossible that some of them practise it still. Exceptional as these\r\nfacts may be, they are interesting to sociologists, and it is important\r\nto mention and to criticise them also. We are indebted for our\r\nknowledge of a certain number of them to the writers of Greco-Latin\r\nantiquity. I will give them in full, at least those that deserve or\r\nhave obtained more or less credit.\r\n\r\n“Throughout the Troglodyte country,” relates Strabo, “the people lead\r\na nomad life. Each tribe has its chief, or _tyrant_. The women and the\r\nchildren are possessed in common, with the exception of the wives and\r\nchildren of the chief, and whoever is guilty of adultery with one of\r\nthe wives of the chief is punished by a fine consisting of the payment\r\nof a sheep.”[66]\r\n\r\nAnother passage of Strabo’s, which is better known, is often quoted\r\nas proving a primitive epoch of promiscuity among the ancient Arabs\r\nalso. This passage is curious and interesting, but it has not in the\r\nleast the extent of signification that is attributed to it. Concerning\r\nthe conjugal customs of the peoples of Arabia Felix, Strabo speaks as\r\nfollows:--“Community of goods exists between all the members of the\r\nsame family, but there is only one master, who is always the eldest\r\nof the family. They have only one wife between them all, and he who\r\ncan forestall the others enters her apartment the first, and enjoys\r\nher, after having taken the precaution of placing his staff across\r\nthe door (it is the custom for every man to carry a staff). She never\r\nspends the night with any but the eldest, the chief. This promiscuity\r\nmakes them all brothers. We must add that they have commerce with\r\ntheir own mothers. On the other hand, adultery, which means for them\r\ncommerce with a lover who is not of the family, is pitilessly punished\r\nwith death. The daughter of one of the kings of the country, who\r\nwas marvellously beautiful, had fifteen brothers, all desperately in\r\nlove with her, and who, for this reason, took turns in enjoying her\r\nwithout intermission. Fatigued with their assiduity, she invented the\r\nfollowing stratagem. She procured staffs exactly similar to those of\r\nher brothers, and when one of them left her, she quickly placed across\r\nthe door the staff similar to that of the brother who had just quitted\r\nher, then replaced it shortly after by another, and so on, taking care\r\nnot to place there the staff like the brother’s whose visit she was\r\nexpecting. Now, one day, when all the brothers were together in the\r\npublic place, one of them went to her door, and concluded, at the sight\r\nof the staff, that some one was with her; but, as he had left all his\r\nbrothers together, he believed in a flagrant act of adultery, hastened\r\nto seek their father, and led him to the spot. He was, however, forced\r\nto acknowledge in his presence that he had slandered his sister.”[67]\r\n\r\nEven admitting the perfect accuracy of the fact related by Strabo (and\r\nthere is nothing in it to surprise an ethnographical sociologist), the\r\nword promiscuity is here quite inappropriate. The custom of maternal\r\nincest, which is not without example, perhaps warrants the supposition\r\nof ancient familial promiscuity; but in reality the Arabs of whom\r\nStrabo speaks were simply polyandrous, and they were so precisely\r\nin the manner of the Thibetans of the present day; they practised\r\nfraternal polyandry--a conjugal form to which we shall presently return.\r\n\r\nThe other examples of so-called promiscuity related by the writers of\r\nantiquity are, unfortunately, so briefly given that it is difficult to\r\njudge of their value.\r\n\r\n“The Agathyrses” (Scythians), says Herodotus, “are the most delicate\r\nof men; their ornaments are chiefly of gold. They have their women\r\nin common in order that they may all be brothers, and that, being so\r\nnearly related, they may feel neither hatred nor envy against each\r\nother.”[68]\r\n\r\nIn another passage Herodotus says of the Massagetes (Scythians), “Each\r\nman marries a wife, but they use them all in common.” The assertion\r\nis grossly contradictory, and can only relate to the extremely loose\r\nmanners of the unmarried women. As a matter of fact, amongst many\r\nsavage or barbarous peoples chastity is not imposed on the women, as\r\nlong as they have no proprietors. “When one of them desires a woman,”\r\ncontinues Herodotus, “he suspends his quiver in front of his chariot,\r\nand tranquilly unites with her.”[69]\r\n\r\nThis is merely a trait of very free manners, which may be placed by\r\nthe side of many others, proving that modesty has been slow of growth\r\nin the human brain. The Tahitians were still more cynical than the\r\nMassagetes. Herodotus himself speaks of black Indians (Tamils) “who\r\ncoupled as publicly as beasts” (iii. 101), and V. Jacquemont has\r\nrelated that Runjeet Singh would ride with one of his wives on the\r\nback of an elephant and take his pleasure publicly with his companion,\r\ncareless of censure (V. Jacquemont, _Corres._, 16th March 1831). It\r\nwould be very easy, by searching into ethnography, to accumulate facts\r\nof this kind; but for the moment I have only to continue my examination\r\nof old Greco-Roman texts relating more or less to promiscuity. I\r\ntherefore return to them. Herodotus again relates, in speaking of the\r\nAnses, an Ethiopian tribe: “Their women are common; they do not live\r\nwith them, but couple after the manner of beasts. When a vigorous child\r\nis born to a woman, all the men go to see it at the third month, and\r\nhe whom it most resembles acknowledges it for his.”[70] And here we\r\nhave Pliny saying also of the Garamantes: _Garamantes matrimoniorum\r\nexsortes, passim cum feminis degunt_.[71]\r\n\r\nStrabo, too, affirms of the Celtic population of Ierne (Ireland), “the\r\nmen have public commerce with all kinds of women, even with their\r\nmothers and sisters.”[72]\r\n\r\nThe passages that I have just quoted are those which are most\r\nfrequently used to support the pretension that human societies have\r\nbegun with promiscuity; they are at once the most ancient, most\r\nauthentic, and most explicit. We may add to them the assertion of\r\nVarro, quoted by Saint Augustine,[73] according to which the Greeks,\r\nprior to the time of Cecrops, lived in promiscuity. But how is it\r\npossible not to be struck with the weakness of these historical\r\nproofs? Some of them are mere general assertions, while others plainly\r\nrelate either to social anomalies or to cases of polyandry. There is no\r\ndoubt as to this in regard to the ancient Arabs of whom Strabo speaks,\r\nand also to the Protohellenes of Varro. This last instance certainly\r\nrelates to the matriarchal family, of which I shall have to speak again\r\nat some length. In fact, after having stated that the Protohellenes had\r\nno marriage, Varro adds that the children only knew their mother and\r\nbore her name. The proof is decisive, for the matriarchate does not in\r\nthe least exclude marriage, as we shall see later, and in the case of\r\nthe Lydians it lasted until the time of Herodotus.\r\n\r\nIn order to complete this review of ancient texts, I will mention\r\nfurther the passage of the _Timæus_ in which Socrates speaks of the\r\ncommunity of wives:--“On the subject of the procreation of children we\r\nestablished a community of wives and children; and we devised means\r\nthat no one should ever know his own child. They were to imagine that\r\nthey were of one family, and to regard those who were within a certain\r\nlimit of age as brothers and sisters; and again, those who were of an\r\nelder generation as parents and grandparents, and those who were of a\r\nyounger generation as children and grandchildren.”\r\n\r\nBut Plato had a lively imagination. He was a “great dreamer,” as\r\nVoltaire said of him, and this passage evidently describes a purely\r\nutopian society.\r\n\r\nTraditions relative to a very ancient epoch of promiscuity are found\r\nhere and there outside the Greco-Roman world. In China, for example,\r\nthe women are said to have been common until the reign of Fouhi.[74] A\r\ntradition of the same kind, but more explicitly stated, is mentioned in\r\nthe Mahabharata (i. 503): “Formerly it was not a crime to be faithless\r\nto a husband; it was even a duty.... This custom is observed in our own\r\ndays among the Kourous of the north.... The females of all classes are\r\ncommon on the earth; as are the cows, so are the women; each one has\r\nher caste.... It is Civéta-Ketou who has established a limit for the\r\nmen and women on the earth.”[75] This assertion is vague, and has not\r\nthe least proof to support it.\r\n\r\nIf, continuing our inquiry, we attempt to correct these historical\r\ndocuments by ethnographical information, we shall hardly find, on\r\nthis side of the subject more than on the other, anything but simple\r\nassertions, which are either too vague or too brief, or evidently open\r\nto dispute.\r\n\r\nIn the Andaman Islands, or at least in certain of them, the women\r\nare said to have been held in common till quite recently. Every\r\nwoman belonged to all the men of the tribe, and resistance to any of\r\nthem was a crime severely punished.[76] This time we seem to have\r\nfound, at length, a case of actual legal promiscuity. But, according\r\nto other accounts, the Andamanite man and woman contract, on the\r\ncontrary, a monogamic and temporary union, and remain together, in\r\ncase of pregnancy and maternity, until the child is weaned, as do\r\nmany animals.[77] Now, however short a conjugal union may be, it is\r\nincompatible with promiscuity.\r\n\r\nThe indigenous Indians of California, who are among the lowest of\r\nhuman races, couple after the manner of inferior mammals, without the\r\nleast formality, and according to the caprice of the moment.[78] They\r\nare said even to celebrate feasts and propitiatory dances, which are\r\nfollowed by a general promiscuity.[79]\r\n\r\nAccording to Major Ross King, some aboriginal tribes of India, notably\r\nthe Kouroumbas and the Iroulas, have no idea of marriage, and live\r\nin promiscuity.[80] The only prohibitory rule consists in not having\r\nintimate commerce with a person belonging to another class or caste;\r\nbut there seem only to be two classes in the tribe.\r\n\r\nBarbarous tribes belonging to white races are said also to have\r\npractised promiscuity in modern times. Among certain tribes of the\r\nZaporog Cossacks the women are said to be common, and are confined\r\nin separate camps.[81] Besides these, the Ansarians, mountaineers of\r\nSyria, are said to practise, not promiscuity pure and simple, or civil\r\npromiscuity, but a religious promiscuity, analogous to that of the\r\nancient Gnostics[82] and the Areoïs of Tahiti. These Ansarians must\r\ndoubtless have been confounded with the Yazidies, a sect of Arabs, also\r\nSyrians, practising a sort of manichæism, and who, it is said, assemble\r\nperiodically every month, or every three months, in fraternal agapæ, at\r\nthe conclusion of which they unite in the darkness without heed as to\r\nadultery or incest. Throughout the Syrian Orient the erotic festival of\r\nthe Yazidies is called by a significant name, _Daour-el-Cachfeh_--the\r\ngame of catching.[83] But even if the fact were true, what does it\r\nshow? Only one more aberration to the score of the phallic religions.\r\n\r\nHere I end my enumeration. Evidently nothing very convincing results\r\nfrom it. The greater number of the facts that I have just quoted\r\nhave either been carelessly observed, or contested, or affirmed by a\r\nsingle witness, or depend merely on hearsay evidence. It is prudent,\r\ntherefore, to regard them with lawful suspicion, and even if certain of\r\nthem are exact, we must be careful not to draw general conclusions from\r\nthem. Promiscuity may have been adopted by certain small human groups,\r\nmore probably by certain associations or brotherhoods. Thus the chiefs\r\nof the Namaquoi Hottentots willingly held their wives in common.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to study the family we shall find that among the Kamilaroi\r\nof Australia all the women of one clan are reputed to be the wives of\r\nall the men of another. But this community is often only fictitious,\r\nand, besides, it is already regulated; it is not promiscuity pure and\r\nsimple. So far, nothing proves sufficiently that there has been a\r\nuniversal stage of promiscuity among mankind. Some theorists have been\r\nso hasty to come to a conclusion on this point that they have gone\r\nbeyond actual experience. Moreover, as I have been careful to remark,\r\nthe simple fact that man is a mammalian primate weakens this hypothesis\r\nin advance, since the nearest relations of man in the animal kingdom\r\nare in general polygamous, and even sometimes monogamous.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Hetaïrism.--Jus primæ noctis._\r\n\r\nNot only is it impossible to admit that mankind has, in all times and\r\nplaces, passed through a necessary stage of promiscuity, but we must\r\ngo further, and also renounce a theory which has had some degree of\r\nsuccess lately--the theory of obligatory primitive hetaïrism. According\r\nto this theory, when the instinct of holding feminine property arose in\r\nman, some individuals arrogated the right to keep for themselves one\r\nor more of the women hitherto common. The community then protested,\r\nand while tolerating this derogation from ancient usage, exacted that\r\nthe bride, or purchased woman, should make an act of hetaïrism, or\r\nprostitution, before belonging to one man only.\r\n\r\nIt is Herodotus who has transmitted to us the most striking example of\r\nthis kind, the one invoked by all the theorists of hetaïrism. I shall,\r\ntherefore, quote it at length: “The most disgraceful of the Babylonian\r\ncustoms is the following. Every native woman is obliged, once in her\r\nlife, to sit in the temple of Venus and have intercourse with some\r\nstranger. And many, disdaining to sit with the rest, being proud on\r\naccount of their wealth, come in covered carriages, and take up their\r\nstation at the temple with a numerous train of servants attending them.\r\nBut the far greater part do this: many sit down in the temple of Venus,\r\nwearing a crown of cord round their heads; some are continually coming\r\nand others are going out. Passages marked out in a straight line lead\r\nin every direction through the women, along which strangers pass and\r\nmake their choice. When a woman has once seated herself, she must not\r\nreturn home till some stranger has thrown a piece of silver into her\r\nlap and lain with her outside the temple. He who throws the silver\r\nmust say thus: ‘I beseech the goddess Mylitta to favour thee;’ for the\r\nAssyrians call Venus Mylitta. The silver may be ever so small, for she\r\nwill not reject it, inasmuch as it is not lawful for her to do so, for\r\nsuch silver is accounted sacred. The woman follows the first man that\r\nthrows, and refuses no one. But when she has had intercourse, and has\r\nabsolved herself from her obligations to the goddess, she returns home;\r\nand after that time, however great a sum you may give her, you will\r\nnot gain possession of her. Those that are endowed with beauty and\r\nsymmetry of shape are soon set free; but the deformed are detained a\r\nlong time, from inability to satisfy the law, for some wait for a space\r\nof three or four years. In some parts of Cyprus there is a custom very\r\nsimilar.”[84]\r\n\r\nAfter having read this passage, we are surprised at the import that has\r\nbeen attributed to it. Even admitting the obligation and universality\r\nof the custom in ancient Babylon, it is only an example of religious\r\nprostitution, with traces of exogamy. The Babylonians honoured Mylitta,\r\njust as the Armenians, according to Strabo,[85] venerated the goddess\r\nAnaïtis. “They have erected temples to Anaïtis in various places,\r\nespecially in the Akilisenus, and have attached to these temples a good\r\nnumber of hierodules, or sacred slaves, of both sexes. So far, indeed,\r\nthere is no ground for astonishment; but their devotion goes further,\r\nand it is the custom for the most illustrious personages to consecrate\r\ntheir virgin daughters to the goddess. This in no way prevents the\r\nlatter from easily finding husbands, even after they have prostituted\r\nthemselves for a long time in the temples of Anaïtis. No man feels on\r\nthis account any repugnance to take them as wives.”\r\n\r\nI quote in full these venerable passages, which have been so much\r\nused and abused, in order that it may not be possible to mistake\r\ntheir signification. Once more we repeat that they merely relate to\r\nerotico-religious aberrations. The procreative need, or delirium,\r\nhas inspired men with many foolish ideas, and probably will continue\r\nto do so. A very slight knowledge of mythology is enough to show us\r\nthat numerous cults have been founded on the sexual instinct, and\r\nthese cults are naturally accompanied by special practices, little in\r\naccordance with our European morality. Religious prostitution, which\r\nwas widely spread in Greek antiquity, has been also found in India,\r\nwhere every temple of renown had its bayadères, the only women in India\r\nto whom, until quite recently, any instruction was given.\r\n\r\nThe far more peculiar custom of _Tchin-than_, or religious\r\ndefloration, formerly in use in Cambodia[86] and in Malabar, is\r\nevidently akin to religious prostitution. But this custom is nothing\r\nelse than a mystic transformation of what was called the _jus primæ\r\nnoctis_, of which I must first speak. It is important to distinguish\r\nseveral varieties of it. The first and most simple was the custom by\r\nwhich every newly-married woman, before belonging to her husband, was\r\nobliged to give herself, or be given, to a certain number of men,\r\neither relatives, friends, or fellow-citizens. This was the custom\r\namong the Nasamons, according to Herodotus: “When a Nasamon marries,\r\ncustom requires that his bride should yield herself on the first night\r\nto all his guests in turn; each one who has had commerce with her makes\r\nher a present, which he has been mindful to bring with him.”[87]\r\n\r\nA similar custom is said to have existed in various countries of the\r\nglobe, in ancient times in the Balearic Isles, more recently among the\r\nancient Peruvians, in our own times among several aboriginal tribes of\r\nIndia; in Burmah, in Cashmere, in the south of Arabia, in Madagascar,\r\nand in New Zealand;[88] but always as an exceptional practice, in\r\nuse only in a small group or tribe. It is not impossible that here\r\nand there this usage, which is rare enough, may have been derived\r\ntraditionally from an ancient marriage by classes, analogous to that\r\nstill found among the Kamilaroi of Australia; but it may have been\r\nsimply a mark of good-fellowship, or of conjugal generosity on the part\r\nof the bridegroom.\r\n\r\nThe seignorial _jus primæ noctis_, the right of the lord, is much\r\nmore widely spread, and its existence cannot be contested. Among the\r\nKaffirs, says Hamilton,[89] the chiefs have the choice of the women for\r\nseveral leagues round. So also, until lately, in New Zealand, every\r\npretty girl was _taboo_ for the vulgar, and had to be first reserved\r\nfor the chief.[90] In New Mexico, with the Tahous, as Castañeda informs\r\nus, it is necessary, after having purchased the girl from her parents,\r\nto submit her to the seignorial right of the cacique, or to a priest\r\nof high rank. Religion already begins to insinuate itself into this\r\nsingular right.[91]\r\n\r\nAccording to Marco Polo, the same custom existed in the thirteenth\r\ncentury in Cochin-China. “Know,” says the old chronicler, “no woman can\r\nmarry without the king first seeing her. If she pleases him, he takes\r\nher to wife; if she does not please him, he gives her enough from his\r\nown property to enable her to marry.\r\n\r\n“In the year 1280 of Christ, when Messire Marco Polo was in that\r\ncountry, the king had three hundred and eighty-six children, male and\r\nfemale.”[92]\r\n\r\nUnder the feudal system in Europe this right of prelibation, or\r\nmarquette (designated in old French by the expressive term _droit de\r\nculage_), has been in use in many fiefs, and until a very recent epoch.\r\nAlmost in our own days certain lords of the Netherlands, of Prussia,\r\nand of Germany, still claimed it. In a French title-deed of 1507 we\r\nread that the Count d’Eu has the right of prelibation in the said place\r\nwhen any one marries.[93] More than this, ecclesiastics, and even\r\nbishops, have been known to claim this right in their quality of feudal\r\nlords. “I have seen,” says Boetius, “in the court at Bourges, before\r\nthe metropolitan, an appeal by a certain parish priest, who pretended\r\nto claim the first night of young brides, according to the received\r\nusage. The demand was rejected with indignation, the custom unanimously\r\nproscribed, and the scandalous priest condemned to pay a fine.”\r\n\r\n“In a kingdom of Malabar,” says J. Forbes, “the ecclesiastical power\r\ntook precedence of the civil on this particular point, and the\r\nsovereign himself passed under the yoke. Like the other women, the\r\nqueen had to submit to the right of prelibation exercised by the\r\nhigh priest, who had a right to the first three nights, and who was\r\npaid fifty pieces of gold besides for his trouble.”[94] In Cambodia,\r\naccording to an ancient Chinese traveller, religious prelibation\r\nwas obligatory on all the young girls, and was performed every year\r\nwith great ceremony. The parents who had daughters to marry made a\r\ndeclaration of it, and a public functionary fixed the day for the\r\ncelebration of _Tchin-than_, or the legal and religious defloration.\r\nFor this the intervention of a Buddhist priest, or a _tao-sse_\r\npriest, was indispensable. The parents entreated his service, which\r\nwas very costly, and for this reason girls who were poor retained\r\ntheir virginity longer than the rich. It even sometimes happened that\r\npious persons, moved by a sentiment of charity, took on themselves\r\nthe payment of the costs of the ceremony for those who had been\r\nwaiting a long time. Great display attended it. On the appointed day\r\nthe officiating priest was carried in the evening with much pomp to\r\nthe festive house, and the next morning he was reconducted home in a\r\npalanquin with parasol, drum, and music, and not without being offered\r\nfresh presents. A. de Rémusat has given, in Latin, some curious\r\nparticulars of the intimate details of the ceremony, which I cannot\r\nrelate here.[95]\r\n\r\nThese few examples suffice to show how very much morality is a relative\r\nthing, but they cannot serve as a basis to a general theory of\r\nhetaïrism.\r\n\r\nThe seignorial right of prelibation is simply an abuse of force and\r\ngood pleasure; only, viewed in the light of our morality, it shocks us\r\nmore than the others. One might justify it, however, by reasons which\r\nBossuet considered sufficient to render slavery lawful. The right of\r\nconquest has given, or still gives, all over the world, every sort\r\nof right over the vanquished, even the right of life and death. The\r\nconqueror, “in a just war,” says the sage of Meaux, may legitimately\r\nkill the vanquished and, _a fortiori_, enslave him; and one may add,\r\nfollowing out a logical conclusion, that it is lawful for him to\r\ndispose as he pleases of his wife and daughter. As a matter of course,\r\nthe priest, in his quality of lord, can claim the same privileges as\r\nthe layman; but besides this, if it should happen that his particular\r\nreligion lends itself to the idea by being founded in some manner on\r\nthe worship of the principle of procreation, as is so frequently the\r\ncase with oriental religions, a sort of superstitious prestige will\r\ncome to adorn and clothe this sacerdotal shamelessness.\r\n\r\nIn all this there is hardly any room for hetaïrism considered as a\r\ncompensation to the community for damage to its ancient rights.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that the _jus primæ noctis_ of relatives and friends does\r\nnot imply simple polyandry, it may very naturally be explained by\r\nprimitive laxity of morals. Among the greater number of peoples who\r\nare very slightly or not at all civilised, the women are free to give\r\nor sell themselves before marriage as they please, and as it does not\r\nentail any disgrace, they use the liberty largely. Besides, in many\r\ncountries the husband had, or still has, over his wife or wives all the\r\nrights of a proprietor over the thing possessed. Now, considering he\r\nis a stranger to all modesty and sexual restraint, nothing seems more\r\nnatural, if he has some instinct of sociability, than to lend his wife\r\nto his friends, just as he would do them an act of politeness, make\r\nthem a present, or invite them to a feast, all without thinking any\r\nevil. This view of the practice is supported by many facts.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it is the great sexual licence accorded to young girls in so\r\nmany countries which has led many observers and travellers to conclude\r\nthat promiscuity has been systematically established. In Australia\r\nthe girls cohabit from the age of ten with young boys of fourteen or\r\nfifteen, without rebuke from any one, and there are even great sexual\r\norgies in which the signal is given to the young people for liberty to\r\nunite freely in open day.[96]\r\n\r\nIn the greater number of savage countries these customs are common. At\r\nNouka-Hiva, or more generally all over Polynesia, the young girls did\r\nnot marry, that is to say, did not become the chattel of a man, before\r\nthe age of nineteen or twenty, and until then they contracted a great\r\nnumber of capricious unions, which became lasting only in case of the\r\nbirth of children.[97]\r\n\r\nIn all these islands, moreover, modesty was unknown, and the members of\r\neach family passed the night side by side on mats, and entirely naked.\r\nThe place of honour, in the centre, was occupied by the master of the\r\nhouse, flanked by his wife or wives.[98]\r\n\r\nAnalogous customs, extremely licentious in our eyes, but perfectly\r\nnatural for primitive peoples, were in full force among all the\r\nindigenous races of America.\r\n\r\nThe Chinouk girls give or hire themselves out as they please. In the\r\nlatter case the parents often take the payment.[99]\r\n\r\nThe Aymaras, who have no word for marriage, and who are such a simple\r\nfolk that, in their opinion, any crime can be committed with impunity\r\non Good Friday, since God is dead on that day, contract without scruple\r\nfree unions merely for the duration of the evening of a feast. The\r\ncontract is made in mimic language, and in settling it the man and\r\nwoman exchange head-gear only.[100]\r\n\r\nSimilar manners prevail among the Esquimaux, the Kaffirs, and the Dyaks\r\nof Borneo. In Japan the parents willingly hire out their daughters,\r\neither to private individuals or to houses of prostitution, for a\r\nperiod of several years, and the girls are in no way dishonoured\r\nthereby. In Abyssinia, says Bruce, outside of the conjugal bond, which\r\nis easily tied or untied, the women dispose of their person as they\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nIn primitive Rome, as with us, the young girl without dowry, the\r\n_indotata_, was held in moderate esteem; and therefore many young\r\ngirls procured themselves a dowry by trafficking their persons. An old\r\nLatin proverb has handed down the souvenir of this ancient fashion of\r\nprocuring a dowry: _Tusco more, tute tibi dotem quæris corpore_.[101]\r\n\r\nNow, in all these customs, at once so simple and so gross, it is\r\nimpossible to see the traces of an enforced hetaïrism, derived from\r\nan antique period of promiscuity, which was also equally obligatory.\r\nThey are simply traits of animal laxity. Men were still almost devoid\r\nof moral training, and the care for decency and modesty was of the\r\nslightest.\r\n\r\nIf in a primitive country a certain amount of restraint is imposed\r\non a woman who is married, or rather owned by a man, it is solely\r\nbecause she is considered as property, held by the same title as a\r\nfield or a domestic animal. For her to dispose of her person without\r\nauthorisation is often a capital crime; but the husband, on the\r\ncontrary, has in many countries the undisputed right to lend, let out,\r\nor barter his wife or wives: _jus utendi et abutendi_. I will mention a\r\nfew of these marital customs.\r\n\r\nIn America, from the land of the Esquimaux to Patagonia, the loan of\r\nthe wife is not only lawful, but praiseworthy. Egidius says of the\r\nEsquimaux, “that those who lend their wives to their friends without\r\nthe least hesitation are reputed in the tribe as having the best and\r\nnoblest character.”[102] The English traveller, Captain Ross, relates\r\nthat one of the Esquimaux prowling around his ship was accompanied by\r\nthe wives and children of one of his intimate friends, to whom he had,\r\nin the preceding autumn, confided, on his side, his own two wives.\r\nThe exchange was to terminate at a fixed time, and the Esquimaux of\r\nwhom Captain Ross speaks was very indignant with his friend because\r\nthe latter, having forgotten himself while chasing the deer in distant\r\nregions, was not exact in keeping the engagement.[103]\r\n\r\nOn this point the Redskins are not more delicate than the Esquimaux.\r\nThus the Natchez make no difficulty of lending their wives to their\r\nfriends.[104] In New Mexico the Yuma husbands willingly hire out their\r\nwives and their slaves, without making any difference. And, besides,\r\nwith them, as in many other countries, to furnish a guest with a\r\ntemporary wife is simply one of the duties of hospitality.[105] The\r\nchiefs of the Noutka Columbians barter their wives among each other as\r\na sign of friendship.[106] Nothing would be easier than to enumerate a\r\ngreat number of facts of the same kind observed in Australia, Africa,\r\nPolynesia, Mongolia, and almost everywhere. But it is more remarkable\r\nto meet with the same custom in a Mussulman country. Nevertheless,\r\nBurckhardt relates that the Merekedeh, a branch of the great tribe\r\nof Asyr, understood hospitality in this primitive manner. To every\r\nstranger received under their tents or in their houses, they offered\r\na woman of the family, and most often a wife of the host himself.\r\nThe young girls alone were exempt from this strange service. It was\r\nconsidered the duty of the traveller to conform with a good grace to\r\nthe custom, otherwise he was hooted and chased from the village or\r\ncamp by the women and children. This extreme manner of understanding\r\nhospitality was very ancient and deeply rooted, and it was not without\r\ndifficulty that the conquering Wahabites brought the Asyrs to renounce\r\nit.[107] But these customs were not specially confined to the Asyrs;\r\nthey were in force throughout prehistoric Arabia. An old Arab writer,\r\nIbn al Moghawir, mentions them. “Sometimes,” he says, “the wife was\r\nactually placed at the disposition of the guest; at other times, the\r\noffer was only symbolic. The guests were invited to press the wife\r\nin their arms, and to give her kisses, but the poignard would have\r\nrevenged any further liberties.”[108] It is not very long since the\r\nsame practice prevailed in Kordofan and Djebel-Taggale.[109] Certain\r\ntraits of morals related by the Greco-Latin writers show that in Rome,\r\nand Greece also, if it was not the husband’s duty to lend his wife to\r\nhis friends, he had at least the right to do so. At Sparta, Lycurgus\r\nauthorised husbands to be thus liberal with their wives whenever they\r\njudged their friends worthy of this honour. And, further, the public\r\nopinion of Sparta strongly approved the conduct of an aged husband\r\nwho took care to procure for his wife a young, handsome, and virtuous\r\nsubstitute.[110]\r\n\r\nThe same customs prevailed at Athens, where Socrates, it is said,\r\nlent his wife Xantippe to his friend Alcibiades; and at Rome,[111]\r\nwhere the austere Cato the elder gave up his wife Marcia to his friend\r\nHortensius, and afterwards took her back, much enriched, it is true, at\r\nthe death of this friend.\r\n\r\nAll these facts relate, therefore, to a very widely-spread and almost\r\nuniversal custom, which is in perfect accord with the extremely low\r\nposition that has been granted to women in the greater number of savage\r\nand barbarous societies. The married woman, being exactly assimilated\r\nto a slave or a thing possessed, might thenceforth be treated as such;\r\nand the right of property, soon becoming sacred, easily stood before\r\nany scruples of decency which were still rare and weak.\r\n\r\nAfter the preceding investigation, there appears to be no difficulty\r\nin refuting the sociological theory, far too prevalent, according to\r\nwhich the entire human race has passed through a primitive period of\r\npromiscuity followed by hetaïrism. Our first ancestors, the precursors\r\nof man, were surely very analogous to the other primates. We may,\r\ntherefore, conclude that, like them, they generally lived in polygamous\r\nfamilies. When these almost human little groups were associated in\r\nhordes or tribes, it is quite possible that great laxity of morals may\r\nhave prevailed amongst them, but not a legal or obligatory promiscuity.\r\nIn a society sufficiently numerous and savage it is no easy task for a\r\nman to guard his feminine property, for the women are not by any means\r\naverse to adventures. Their modesty is still very slight, and before\r\nbelonging specially to one man they have generally been given or sold\r\nto many others. At that period of the social evolution public opinion\r\nsaw no harm in all this. And, besides, the husband or the proprietor of\r\nthe woman considered her absolutely as his thing, and did not scruple\r\nto lend her to his friends, to barter her, or to hire her out.\r\n\r\nThese primitive customs, combined with polyandrous or collective\r\nmarriage and the matriarchate, have deceived many observers, both\r\nancient and modern.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to scrutinise these facts, and to view them in the light\r\nof animal sociology, we arrive at the conclusion that human promiscuity\r\ncan only have been rare and exceptional, and that the theory of\r\nthe community of wives and of obligatory hetaïrism will not bear\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe procreative need is one of the most tyrannical, and primitive\r\nman has satisfied it as he best could, without the least delicate\r\nrefinement; but the egotism of individuals has had for its result, from\r\nthe origin of human societies, the formation of unions based on force,\r\nand, correlatively, a right of property which fettered more or less\r\nrigorously the liberty of the women who were thus possessed.\r\n\r\nThese primitive unions were concluded according to the chance caprices\r\nor needs of extremely gross societies, who cared little to submit to a\r\nuniform conjugal type. There are some very singular ones among them,\r\nwhich differ essentially from the legal forms of marriage finally and\r\nvery tardily adopted by the majority of mankind. It is these isolated\r\nconjugal unions, extravagant and immoral in our eyes, that we now have\r\nto consider.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[66] Herodotus, Book xvi. p. 17.\r\n\r\n[67] Strabo, vol. xvi. ch. iv. p. 25.\r\n\r\n[68] Herodotus, Book i. p. 216.\r\n\r\n[69] Herodotus, iv. 104.\r\n\r\n[70] _Ibid._ iv. 180.\r\n\r\n[71] Pliny, v. 8.\r\n\r\n[72] Strabo, iv. 4.\r\n\r\n[73] Varro, _Apud.

It would be\r\ninexpedient here to treat the subject afresh in detail, but I will\r\nrecall the conclusions arrived at by that investigation. Modesty is\r\n_par excellence_ a human sentiment, and is totally unknown to the\r\nanimals, although the procreative need inspires them with desires and\r\npassions essentially identical with what in man we call love; it is\r\ntherefore certainly an artificial sentiment, and comparative ethnology\r\nproves that it must have resulted from the enforced chastity imposed\r\non women under the most terrible penalties. In reality, primitive\r\nmarriage hardly merits the name; it is simply the taking possession\r\nof one or several women by one man, who holds them by the same title\r\nas all other property, and who treats adultery, when unauthorised by\r\nhimself, strictly as robbery. This ferocious restraint has resulted,\r\nespecially in the woman, in the formation of particular mental\r\nimpressions, corresponding psychically to the sentiment of modesty, and\r\ninducing a certain sexual reserve which has become instinctive. But\r\nthis moral inhibition is still very weak in races of low development,\r\nand, taking the whole human species, it exists chiefly in the woman;\r\nit is a sexual peculiarity of character, and is of relatively recent\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nIf we keep well in mind these preliminary considerations, we shall\r\nnot be much surprised at the forms of sexual association which we\r\nare about to consider, although they are singularly repulsive to our\r\nideas of morality. We shall be still less surprised at them when we\r\nare acquainted with the extreme licence permitted in many savage and\r\nbarbarous societies.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more difficult for us to realise, civilised as we\r\nare, than the mental state of the man far behind us in cultivation as\r\nregards what we call _par excellence_ “morality.” It is not indecency;\r\nit is simply an animal absence of modesty. Acts which are undeniably\r\nquite natural, since they are the expression of a primordial need,\r\nessential to the duration of the species, but which a long ancestral\r\nand individual education has trained us to subject to a rigorous\r\nrestraint, and to the accomplishment of which, consequently, we cannot\r\nhelp attaching a certain shame, do not in the least shock the still\r\nimperfect conscience of the primitive man. On this point facts are\r\neloquent and abundant; I will quote a few of them.\r\n\r\nIn Tasmania it way thought an honour for women to prostitute themselves\r\nto Europeans, who were ennobled in the eyes of the natives by the\r\nprestige of their superiority.[113] The Australians, who were a little\r\nmore developed than the Tasmanians, willingly lent or hired out\r\ntheir women--at least those that were their own property--to their\r\nfriends.[114]\r\n\r\nThe women were not less bestial than their males. They often engaged,\r\nsays Peltier, in furious combats, fighting with spears, for the\r\npossession of a man. This is a peculiar case, and is an entirely human\r\ninstance of that _law of battle_ of which I have spoken in regard to\r\nanimals. Like the females of animals also the Australian women adored\r\nstrength, and when the men of their own horde were beaten in battle\r\nthey sometimes went over to the camp of the conquerors of their own\r\naccord (Mitchell).[115] In these facts there is nothing exceptional,\r\nand we may change the country without changing the customs. Thus the\r\nBochimans treat their wives as simple domestic animals, and offer them\r\nwillingly to strangers,[116] as do also the Australians.\r\n\r\nIn the Andaman Islands and elsewhere the women give themselves up\r\nbefore marriage--that is, before becoming the property of one man--to\r\nthe most unbridled prostitution,[117] and yet the most innocent,\r\naccording to the morality of the country.\r\n\r\nAmong the Esquimaux the laxity of sexual customs, both for men and\r\nwomen, is extreme. The husbands feel no shame in selling, or rather\r\nhiring out, their wives; and the latter, as soon as their proprietors\r\nare gone to the chase or to fish, abandon themselves to an uncontrolled\r\ndebauch, taking care to post their children outside the hut to warn\r\nthem in case of the unexpected return of the master.[118] Sexual\r\nmorality does not yet exist among the Esquimaux, and an Aleout said\r\nquite simply to the missionary Langsdorff, “When my people couple they\r\ndo it like the sea-otters.”[119] In fact, if the cold permitted, the\r\nEsquimaux would not be any more clothed than the sea-otters. In their\r\ncommon houses, where two or three hundred people are crowded together,\r\nand a high degree of temperature is maintained, they throw off their\r\nclothing without distinction of age or sex.[120] They go further\r\nstill, and, like many savages, practise what is called Socratic love\r\nopenly and without shame. Thus, among the Inoits, well-favoured boys\r\nare brought up with care, dressed as girls, and sold at a high price\r\ntowards the age of fifteen,[121] without any harm being seen in it.\r\n\r\nThe Redskins of the extreme north are scarcely more modest than the\r\nEsquimaux. Carver relates that among the Nandowessics a woman was\r\nparticularly honoured because she had first entertained and then\r\ntreated as husbands the forty chief warriors of the tribe.[122]\r\n\r\nBut it is especially in Polynesia that the naïve immodesty of primitive\r\npeoples was displayed with the greatest indifference to the opinions of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n“The principal difficulty of the missionaries in the Sandwich Isles,”\r\nsays M. de Varigny, “consisted in teaching the women chastity; they\r\nwere ignorant of the name and of the thing. Adultery, incest, and\r\nfornication were common things, approved by public opinion, and even\r\nconsecrated by religion.”[123]\r\n\r\nThese customs are of ancient date in Polynesia. The travellers of\r\nlast century had observed them still the same. The Tahitian women,\r\nif they were free, openly bartered their persons, and the fathers,\r\nmothers, brothers, and sometimes the husbands, often brought them to\r\nthe European sailors and hired them out, after a lively bargaining, for\r\nnails, red feathers, etc.[124]\r\n\r\nAt Noukahiva “the young girls of the island,” says Porter, “are the\r\nwives of all those who can buy their favours, and a beautiful daughter\r\nis considered by her parents as a means of procuring them for a time\r\nriches and plenty. However, when they are older, they form more lasting\r\nconnections, and seem then as firmly attached to their husbands as\r\nwomen of any other country.”[125]\r\n\r\nIn the same archipelago, the surgeon Roblet says that the French\r\nsailors were frequently offered girls of eight years; “and,” he adds,\r\n“they were not virgins.”[126]\r\n\r\n“Virtue,” says Porter, “such as we understand it, was unknown among\r\nthem, and they attached no shame to acts which they regarded not only\r\nas natural, but as an inoffensive amusement. Many parents thought\r\nthemselves honoured by the preference given to their daughters, and\r\nshowed their satisfaction by presents of pigs and fruits, which, on\r\ntheir part, was an extreme of munificence.”[127]\r\n\r\nIn Polynesia public opinion forbade married women to yield themselves\r\nwithout the authorisation of their owners, and this was almost the only\r\nstrict rule of morals existing; but the husbands trafficked in their\r\nwives without scruple. “Tawee,” says Porter, “was one of the handsomest\r\nmen of the island, and loved to adorn his person; a bit of red stuff,\r\nsome morsels of glass, or a whale’s tooth, had irresistible charms\r\nfor him, and in order to procure these objects he would offer any of\r\nthe most precious things he possessed. Thus, though his wife was of\r\nremarkable beauty, and he was the tenderest of husbands, Tawee offered\r\nhis wife more than once for a necklace.”[128]\r\n\r\nTo offer a woman to a visitor to whom one would do honour was, for that\r\nmatter, a simple act of courtesy in Polynesia, and the same courtesy\r\nprescribed the immediate acceptance of the offer, _coram populo_\r\n(Bougainville). It was frequently his own wife that the husband thus\r\ngave up to his guest, and the case of Porter, which I have just quoted,\r\nhad nothing exceptional in it. A similar thing happened to Captain\r\nBeechey,[129] and to many other travellers. This conjugal liberality\r\nwas one of the customs of the country; the friend, or _tayo_, acquired\r\nconjugal rights over the wife or wives of his friend. Between brothers\r\nand relations the exchange of wives was frequent,[130] to such a degree\r\nthat at Toubouai, etc., Moerenhout tells us the women were nearly held\r\nin common, and that in the Marquesas a woman had sometimes as many as\r\ntwenty lovers.[131]\r\n\r\nFor the Polynesians the pleasures of sensual love were the chief\r\nbusiness of life; they neither saw evil nor practised restraint in\r\nthem. The women were trained with a view to amorous sports;[132] they\r\nwere fattened on a soup of bread fruit, and from earliest infancy\r\ntaught by their mothers to dance the _timorodie_, a very lewd dance,\r\naccompanied by appropriate words.[133] The conversation also was in\r\nkeeping with the morals. “One thing which particularly struck me,” says\r\nMoerenhout, “as soon as I began to understand their language, was the\r\nextreme licence in conversation--a licence pushed to the limit of most\r\nshameless cynicism, and which is the same even with the women; for\r\nthese people think and talk of nothing but sensual pleasure, and speak\r\nopenly of everything, having no idea of the euphemisms of our civilised\r\nsocieties, where we use double meanings and veiled words, or terms\r\nthat are permitted in mentioning things which would appear revolting\r\nand cause scandal if plainly expressed; but these islanders could not\r\nunderstand this, and the missionaries have never been able to make them\r\ndo so.”[134]\r\n\r\nLastly, the existence of the religious and aristocratic society of\r\nthe _Areoïs_, in Tahiti and other archipelagoes, finishes the picture\r\nof the mental condition of the Polynesians as regards morals. Without\r\ndescribing afresh this curious association, I shall only remind\r\nmy readers that it had for its object an unrestrained and public\r\nabandonment to amorous pleasures, and that, for this reason, the\r\ncommunity of women and the obligation of infanticide were decreed.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century sentimentality invaded the brains of thinkers\r\nand writers like an epidemic, and gave rise to the belief that\r\nprimitive man, or “man in a state of nature,” as the phrase went,\r\nwas the model of all virtues. But we must discount much of this.\r\nAs we might naturally expect, the uncultivated man is a mammal of\r\nthe grossest kind. We have already seen that his sexual morality is\r\nextremely loose, and necessarily so; we are, however, surprised to find\r\nhim addicted to certain aberrations from nature which the chroniclers\r\nof the Greco-Latin world have accustomed us to regard as the result\r\nof a refined and depraved civilisation,--an opinion which is quite\r\nerroneous, as comparative ethnography irrefutably proves. Nothing is\r\nmore common among primitive races than what is called Socratic love,\r\nand on this point I will briefly quote a few facts, without pausing\r\nlonger on them than my subject requires. In the vast sociological\r\ninvestigation which I am undertaking, moral bestiality must not\r\ndiscourage scientific analysis any more than putrefaction arrests the\r\nscalpel of the anatomist; it does not therefore follow that we take\r\ndelight in it.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, many human races have practised, from the first,\r\nvices contrary to nature. The Kanaks of New Caledonia frequently\r\nassemble at night in a cabin to give themselves up to this kind of\r\ndebauchery.[135] The New Zealanders practised it even among their\r\nwomen.[136] It was also a widely-spread custom throughout Polynesia,\r\nand even a special deity presided over it. In the whole of America,\r\nfrom north to south, similar customs have existed or still exist. We\r\nhave previously seen that the Esquimaux reared young boys for this\r\npurpose. The Southern Californians did the same, and the Spanish\r\nmissionaries, on their arrival in the country, found men dressed as\r\nwomen and assuming their part. They were trained to this from youth,\r\nand often publicly married to the chiefs.[137] Nero was evidently a\r\nmere plagiarist. The existence of analogous customs has been proved\r\namongst the Guyacurus of La Plata, the natives of the Isthmus of\r\nDarien, the tribes of Louisiana, and the ancient Illinois, etc.[138]\r\n\r\nThe two chief forms of sexual excess of which I have been speaking,\r\nunnatural vice and the debauchery of girls or free women, are habitual\r\nin savage countries; and later, when civilisation and morality have\r\nevolved, the same inveterate inclinations still persist for a long\r\ntime, in spite of public opinion and even of legal repression.\r\n\r\nThe Incas, according to the chronicler Garcilaso, were merciless in\r\nregard to these sexual aberrations, and the Mexican law was equally\r\nsevere, but all without much effect, if we may believe the accounts of\r\nGarcilaso himself, Gomara, Bernal Diaz, etc. I have elsewhere related\r\nhow the ancient legislations of the great Asiatic states repressed\r\nthese base aberrations of the procreative sense, and nevertheless,\r\nat the present day, the Arabs frequently give way to them, even in\r\nthe holy Mosque at Mecca;[139] and other Eastern peoples, Hindoos,\r\nPersians, and Chinese, are also very imperfectly reformed on this point.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that morality is essentially relative, and that\r\nancestral impressions are extremely tenacious in the human brain,\r\nwe shall not be much surprised to see these low tendencies persist\r\nas survivals in the midst of civilisations already far advanced.\r\nNevertheless, the theoretic morality of all the great nations of the\r\nEast has for centuries condemned these repugnant excesses, which our\r\nEuropean ancestors, both Celts and Teutons, have early reproved and\r\nrepressed. It is all the more singular to find the most intelligent\r\nrace of antiquity, the ancient Greeks, practising the greatest\r\ntolerance on this subject, so much so that the names of Socrates and\r\nPlato, those fathers of ethereal spiritualism, are attached to amours\r\nthe mere thought of which now excites disgust in a civilised European.\r\n\r\nA very slight acquaintance with Greco-Roman literature furnishes\r\nabundant information on this matter. I have no need, therefore, to\r\ndwell on it, but I must quote a curious passage of Strabo, from\r\nwhich we learn that the ancient Cretans associated with so-called\r\nSocratic amours the ceremonial of marriage by capture, of which I\r\nshall soon have to speak. This strange passage is as follows:--“It\r\nis not by persuasion, but by capture, that they obtain possession\r\nof the beloved object. Three days or more in advance the _erastes_\r\napprises the friends of the young boy of his project of abduction.\r\nIt would be considered the greatest disgrace for them to conceal the\r\nchild, or prevent him from passing by the road indicated. By so doing\r\nthey would appear to confess that he did not merit the favours of\r\nsuch a distinguished _erastes_. What do they do therefore? They meet\r\ntogether, and if the ravisher is equal or superior in rank and all\r\nother respects to the family of the child, they are content in their\r\npursuit to comply with the idea of the law, and to make a semblance of\r\nattack only, allowing the child to be carried off, and even testifying\r\ntheir satisfaction; but if, on the contrary, the ravisher should be of\r\ngreatly inferior rank, they invariably rescue the child from his hands.\r\nIn any case the pursuit comes to an end when the child has crossed the\r\nthreshold of the _andrion_ of his captor.” We may doubtless presume,\r\nfrom this passage, that the ancient Cretans were no longer in the state\r\nof bestial coarseness of the New Caledonians. With them the capture was\r\na symbol or comedy. It was a mark of esteem, paid less to the beauty of\r\nthe child than to his valour and propriety of manners. In fact, the boy\r\nhad the legal right to revenge himself, if he had suffered any violence\r\nin his capture; and in restoring him to liberty his ravisher loaded\r\nhim with presents, some of which were obligatory and legal, namely,\r\na warrior’s cloak, an ox, and a goblet; it was a kind of initiation\r\nin virility, and it was considered a disgrace for a young boy not to\r\nobtain an _erastes_.[140]\r\n\r\nBut even if we admit that all the ceremonial of this singular platonic\r\nmarriage among the Cretans was perfectly innocent, it arose, none the\r\nless, from a moral laxity, plainly showing that ancient morals were\r\ngross in the extreme.\r\n\r\nI here conclude my enumeration. Short as it has been, for I have\r\npurposely limited my facts to a small number, it is sufficient to\r\nprove that for an immense period man has been a very coarse animal. We\r\nmay, therefore, expect to find him adapting without scruple forms of\r\nmarriage or sexual association quite unusual among Europeans, and which\r\nit now remains for me to describe briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Some Strange Forms of Marriage._\r\n\r\nIn savage societies, where no delicacy yet exists in regard to sexual\r\nunion, and where, on the other hand, woman is strictly assimilated\r\nto things and domestic animals, marriage, or what we please to call\r\nso, is an affair of small importance, which is regulated according\r\nto individual caprice. More generally the parents, and sometimes the\r\nfriends or the chiefs, pair the young people as they think fit, and\r\nquite naturally they have little regard for monogamic marriage, to\r\nthe strictness of which, even in civilised societies, man finds it so\r\ndifficult to bend.\r\n\r\nThe young people, on their part, have hardly any individual\r\npreferences. The young boys of the Redskins, as Lafitau tells us, never\r\neven troubled to see, before marriage, the wife chosen for them by\r\ntheir parents.[141] In Bargo, according to R. and J. Lander, they marry\r\nwith perfect indifference; “a man does not care any more about choosing\r\na wife than about which ear of corn he shall pick.” There is never any\r\nquestion as to the sentiments of the contracting parties.[142]\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain, also, that during the first ages of the evolution\r\nof societies, the ties of kinship, even those we are accustomed to\r\nregard as sacred, and respect for which seems to be incarnate in us,\r\nhave not been any impediment to sexual unions. Like the sentiment of\r\nmodesty, the horror of incest has only been engraved on the human\r\nconscience with great difficulty and by long culture. Scruples of\r\nthis kind are unknown to the animal, and before they could arise in\r\nthe human brain it was first necessary that the family should be\r\nconstituted, and then that, from some motive or other, the custom of\r\nexogamous marriage should be adopted. Now, as we shall see later, the\r\nfamily has at first been matriarchal or rather maternal, and with such\r\na familial system, the children have no legal father; the prohibitions\r\nrelative to incest could therefore, at the most, only exist in regard\r\nto the female line, and, in fact, we find it to be so in many countries\r\nwhere this system of filiation prevails. But primitive morals, existing\r\nbefore the formation of a morality condemning incest, have left many\r\ntraces in the past, and even in the present. “The Chippeways,” says\r\nHearne, “frequently cohabit with their mother, and oftener still with\r\ntheir sisters and daughters.”[143] And yet he is speaking here of\r\nRedskins, a people reputed to be fanatical on the matter of exogamy.\r\nLangsdorff says the same of the Kadiaks, who unite indiscriminately,\r\nbrothers with sisters, and parents with children.[144] It is well\r\nknown, besides, that in the matter of sexual unions no race has fewer\r\nprejudices than the Esquimaux. The Coucous of Chili, and the Caribs\r\nalso, willingly married at the same time a mother and daughter. With\r\nthe Karens, too, of Tenasserim, marriages between brother and sister,\r\nor father and daughter, are frequent enough, even in our own day.[145]\r\n\r\nBut these unions, though incestuous for us, have not been practised\r\namongst savages and inferior races only. According to Strabo, the\r\nancient Irish married, without distinction, their mothers and\r\nsisters.[146]\r\n\r\nWe are told by Justin and Tertullian[147] that the Parthians and\r\nPersians married their own mothers without scruple. In ancient Persia,\r\nreligion went so far even as to sanctify the union of a son with his\r\nmother.[148] Priscus relates that these marriages were also permitted\r\namong the Tartars and Scythians, and it is reported, too, that Attila\r\nmarried his daughter Esca.[149]\r\n\r\nWhether from a survival of ancient morals, or the care to preserve\r\npurity of race, conjugal unions between brother and sister were\r\nauthorised, or even prescribed, in various countries, for the royal\r\nfamilies. The kings of ancient Egypt were obliged to marry their\r\nsisters, and Cleopatra thus became the wife of her brother Ptolemy\r\nDionysius. The Incas of Peru were subject to a similar law; and at Siam\r\nalso, when the traveller La Loubère visited it, the king had married\r\nhis sister.[150] But I shall have to return to the subject of marriage\r\nbetween relations in treating of the endogamic _régime_ which has been,\r\nor is, in force among many peoples.\r\n\r\nThese incestuous marriages astonish us, and certain of them are even\r\nrevolting to our ideas, as, for example, the union of the mother with\r\nthe son. Another custom will probably surprise, if not shock us quite\r\nas much. I allude to experimental marriages, which are far from being\r\nrare. They will appear, however, less singular, if we remember that in\r\nsocieties of low order little value is set on the chastity of young\r\ngirls; virginal purity is not at all prized, and there are even some\r\npeoples, as the Saccalaves of Madagascar,[151] for instance, and also\r\ncertain indigenous peoples of India,[152] among whom it is regarded as\r\na duty for the mothers themselves to deflower their daughters before\r\nmarrying them.\r\n\r\nWith such morals prevailing, experimental marriages seem natural\r\nenough. De Champlain, an ancient French traveller in North America,\r\nrelates that the Redskins of Canada always lived a few days together,\r\nand then quitted each other if the trial had not been satisfactory to\r\neither of them.[153]\r\n\r\nA Spanish chronicler, Herrara, reports that the Otomies of Mexico spent\r\na night of trial with the woman that they desired to marry; they could\r\nquit her afterwards, but only on condition of not retaining her during\r\nthe following day.[154]\r\n\r\nAmong the Sonthals also, an aboriginal tribe of India, whose marriages\r\nare celebrated simultaneously once a year, the candidates for marriage\r\nmust first live six days together, and it is only after this trial\r\nthat it is lawful for them to marry.[155] With certain Tartar tribes\r\nof Russia in Europe and of Siberia there existed an institution of\r\nexperimental marriages lasting for a year, if the woman did not become\r\na mother during that period.[156] In the island of Ceylon, according to\r\nDavy, there are also provisional marriages, confirmed or annulled at\r\nthe end of a fortnight.[157]\r\n\r\nAmong the Jews in Morocco the Rabbis consecrate temporary marriages,\r\nfor three or six months, according to agreement. The man only engages\r\nto acknowledge the child if needful, and to make a certain donation to\r\nthe mother.[158]\r\n\r\nStrabo tells us of an analogous custom prevailing in antiquity among\r\nthe Tapyres (Parthians), according to which a woman, after having\r\nhad two or three children by a man, was forced by law to change her\r\nhusband.[159] This is almost exactly what Marshal Saxe demanded for\r\nFrenchwomen in the last century.\r\n\r\nWe must not confound these experimental marriages, which are regulated,\r\nand in some sort legal, with free and easily cancelled unions still\r\nmore common, as, for example, those of the Nouka-Hivians, that are\r\nbroken at will, provided there are no children;[160] those of the\r\nHottentots;[161] those of the Abyssinians, who marry, part, and\r\nre-marry at will.[162] These last unions, founded merely on individual\r\ncaprice, have nothing extraordinary about them, and we know that they\r\nare not rare in civilised countries.\r\n\r\nMuch more curious, from a point of view of sexual and conjugal\r\nmorality, are the partial marriages, which only bind the parties for\r\ncertain days of the week. This is a rare kind of marriage that seems\r\nimprobable to us, yet it has been proved to have existed among the\r\nHassinyehs of the White Nile, of Arab or perhaps Berber race.\r\n\r\nBy an agreement, which is sharply discussed beforehand, the Hassinyeh\r\nwoman engages to be a faithful wife for a fixed number of days in the\r\nweek, generally three or four, but this is in proportion to the number\r\nof heads of cattle given to the parents by the bridegroom as the price\r\nof their daughter, and it is the mother herself who makes the bargain.\r\nNaturally, on the days that are not reserved the woman is free, and she\r\nhas a right to use her liberty as she pleases.[163]\r\n\r\nThese strange customs amongst the Arabs must surely date from old\r\npre-Islamite ages, and we may class them with other antique customs,\r\nas, for example, marriage for a term, called _mot’a_ marriage, which\r\nwas in use with the Arabs until the time of Mahomet, and which\r\ndoubtless they imported later into Persia, where it exists in our own\r\nday. And again, in the kingdom of Omân, in the fourteenth century, the\r\nSultan could still grant to a woman, indeed to any woman he pleased,\r\nthe permission to have lovers according to her fancy, and her relations\r\nhad no right to interfere.[164]\r\n\r\nThe partial marriage of the Hassinyeh Arabs is therefore not so\r\nsurprising as it seems at first sight when isolated from other\r\npractices of the same kind. And it must be confessed that, immoral as\r\nit may appear to us, it is superior to the other modes of primitive\r\nconjugal association in use among the greater number of savage peoples.\r\nDoubtless it denotes an extreme of moral grossness, but at the same\r\ntime it shows a certain respect for feminine independence, contrasting\r\nstrongly with the animal subjection imposed on women in the greater\r\nnumber of societies of little or no civilisation. The situation of the\r\nwoman who is owned and treated as a simple domestic animal, hired out\r\nor lent to strangers or to friends, according to the caprice of her\r\nmaster, but not allowed, at the peril of her life, to be unfaithful to\r\nher owner without his leave, is surely far more abject still.\r\n\r\nI shall not dwell any more on these mere sketches of marriage, free\r\nand transient unions broken as soon as made, experimental marriages,\r\nthree-quarter marriages, and marriages for a term, all of which show\r\nthe very slight importance attached to sexual union by man in a low\r\nstage of development. And yet we must not refuse the name of marriage\r\nto these ephemeral and incomplete unions, since they are arranged by\r\nmeans of serious contracts which have been well discussed beforehand,\r\nand by agreements entered into at least between the husband and the\r\nrelatives of the wife. The men of the horde or tribe do not, however,\r\nprofess a very strict respect for these marriages; the husband is often\r\nuneasy in the enjoyment of his feminine property, and although legally\r\nobtained, he must always be ready to defend it.\r\n\r\nAmong the Bochimans, says Liechtenstein, with whom marriage is reduced\r\nto its most simple expression, “the strongest man often carries off the\r\nwife of the weakest,” because it is the proper thing for him to do,\r\nsince he is called “the lion.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, these abuses of strength exist, more or less, in all countries\r\nand all races; but among the Redskins of America and the Esquimaux it\r\nseems that public opinion ratifies them, and that might has morally\r\nbecome right.\r\n\r\n“When a Toski,” says Hooper, “desires the wife of another man, he\r\nsimply fights with her husband.”\r\n\r\n“A very ancient custom,” says Hearne, “obliges the men to wrestle for\r\nany woman to whom they are attached; and of course the strongest party\r\nalways carries off the prize. A weak man, unless he be a good hunter\r\nand well beloved, is seldom permitted to keep a wife that a stronger\r\nman thinks worth his notice. This custom prevails throughout all the\r\ntribes.”[165]\r\n\r\nIn the same way, among the Copper and Chippeway Indians woman is a\r\nproperty which is little respected, and which the strong may always\r\ntake from the weak.[166]\r\n\r\nRichardson also says that among the Redskins every man has the right\r\nto challenge another to fight, and if he is victor, to carry off his\r\nwife.[167]\r\n\r\nThe same customs prevail among the Indians of South America--at least\r\namong certain of them. Thus Azara relates that the Guanas never marry\r\nbefore they are over twenty, for earlier than this they would be beaten\r\nby their rivals.[168]\r\n\r\nIt has been attempted to show that these conflicts are the equivalent\r\nof what is called in regard to animals “the law of battle,” but the\r\ncomparison is not exact, for animals seem in this respect much more\r\ndelicate than men. If they fight it is before pairing, and besides, as\r\nwe have seen, their combats are often courteous, like the tournaments\r\nof our ancestors; frequently, too, the object of these assaults is\r\nmuch less to capture the female than to seduce her by displaying\r\nbefore her eyes the qualities with which they are endowed--courage,\r\nforce, address, and beauty. On her part, the female for whom they are\r\ncompeting is so little alarmed at their violence that, in general, she\r\ntranquilly looks on at the duels, and afterwards gives herself, one\r\nmay say, freely to the victor. With certain species of birds a lyric\r\ntourney is substituted for the fight, and so ardently do the birds\r\nengage in it that a competitor will often die of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nLastly, when the tourney is over, the couples paired, and the marriage\r\nconcluded, all rivalry ceases, the newly-mated birds isolate themselves\r\nmore or less, and devote all their energies to the production of a\r\nfamily. Now these are delicate refinements unknown to primitive man,\r\nwhose rivalries on the subject of the possession of women resemble far\r\nmore the struggles of the old males with the young in the hordes of the\r\ngorillas or chimpanzees. We are forced to acknowledge that the sexual\r\nmorality of primitive man does not much differ from that of anthropoid\r\napes, and it is quite a stranger to the æsthetic and poetic refinements\r\nof certain birds.\r\n\r\nI here end my short inquiry into the morals of primitive man and the\r\neccentric modes of conjugal union which have preceded the institution\r\nof a more durable, exclusive, and solemn marriage.\r\n\r\nWe are filled with astonishment when we find such complete animal\r\nlaxity in our undeveloped ancestors, and we can hardly understand the\r\ntotal absence of scruples which are now profoundly incarnate in us.\r\n\r\nThose anthropologists who insist on making man a being apart in the\r\nuniverse shut their eyes to these gross aberrations. Evolutionists are\r\nnot so timid, and do not fear to face the truth.\r\n\r\nIf, as it is impossible to deny, man is subject to the laws of\r\nevolution like all other beings, we are forced to admit that he\r\nmust have passed through very inferior phases of physical and moral\r\ndevelopment. _Homo sapiens_ surely descends from an ancient pithecoid\r\nancestor, and this original blot has necessarily been a drawback to his\r\nmoral evolution.\r\n\r\nBut here it is important to make a distinction. The resemblance\r\nbetween the moral coarseness of the savage and the depravation of the\r\ncivilised man is quite superficial. Who thinks of being shocked at the\r\nmorals of animals? Now those of primitive man are quite as innocent,\r\nand the brutality of the savage has nothing in common with the moral\r\nretrogression of the civilised man struck with decay.\r\n\r\nHow unlike is the Aleout, imitating the sea-otter, without thinking\r\nany evil, to the European degraded by the vices of our civilisation!\r\nFor the latter the future is closed; there are some declivities that\r\ncan never be remounted. The posterity of the savage, on the contrary,\r\nmay, with the aid of time and culture, attain to great moral elevation,\r\nfor there are vital forces within him which are fresh and intact. The\r\nprimitive man is still young, and he possesses many latent energies\r\nsusceptible of development. In short, the savage is a child, while the\r\ncivilised man, whose moral nature is corrupt, presents to us rather the\r\npicture of decrepid old age.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] _L’Évolution de la Morale._\r\n\r\n[113] Wake, vol. i. p. 77.\r\n\r\n[114] _Id._ vol. i. p. 71.\r\n\r\n[115] H.

The forms of marriage most\r\nuniversally practised, those which the majority of mankind has reached\r\nand stopped at, are polygamy and monogamy, or monandry. I shall have\r\nmuch to say of these. For the moment I shall treat of another kind of\r\nmarriage, far less widely spread without doubt, but which, however,\r\nexists or has existed at divers points of the globe; I allude to\r\npolyandry.\r\n\r\nI have no longer to prove that morality is variable and perfectible,\r\nthat it results from social life, and is only to be taken together\r\nwith the other needs, desires, and necessities of the struggle for\r\nexistence. Our moral sentiments are simply habits incarnate in our\r\nbrain, or instincts artificially created; and thus an act reputed\r\nculpable at Paris or at London may be and frequently is held innocent\r\nat Calcutta or at Pekin. In order to judge impartially of polyandric\r\nmarriage we must remember these elementary truths. Not, certainly, that\r\npolyandry is rare amongst us, but it is censured, counted as criminal,\r\nand obliged to hide itself. The legal and regulated possession,\r\npublicly acknowledged, of one woman by several men, who are all\r\nhusbands by the same title, shocks our feelings and morality extremely\r\nin the present day.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, human societies, small or large, must and will live, and\r\nit is an imperious condition which imposes the polyandric _régime_,\r\nnamely, a considerable inequality between the number of men and that of\r\nwomen. Now, this disproportion may result from divers causes. In the\r\nfirst place, it may be natural, as it is among certain animal species.\r\nAmong the lepidoptera, for example, nine hundred and thirty-four males\r\nhave been counted as against seven hundred and sixty-one females.[169]\r\nAlthough smaller, the disproportion is not less real amongst mankind.\r\nAs a general rule, and in nearly all countries where it has been\r\npossible to ascertain it, the relation between masculine and feminine\r\nbirths gives a certain excess of boys. This relation has been found\r\nin Europe to be 106 for 70 million of births; but our great masculine\r\nmortality re-establishes the equilibrium in the early years of life.\r\nThe proportion of births, besides, is far from being identical in\r\nall the countries of Europe, and we even find oscillations in a\r\ngiven country. In England it is generally 104.5, in France 106.3,\r\nin Russia 108.9, at Philadelphia 110.5. In certain ethnic or social\r\ncategories the proportion of masculine births notably augments. It\r\nrises to 113 for the Jews of Russia, to 114 for those of Breslau, to\r\n120 for the Jews of Livonia. More singular still, the proportion of\r\nmasculine to feminine births augments for certain professions; it is,\r\nfor example, higher amongst the English clergy.[170] It is even seen\r\nto vary spontaneously. In the year 1886, during several months, the\r\nproportion of feminine births rose at Paris. In France, for a period\r\nof forty-four years, it has happened five times in one department, and\r\nsix times in another, that the female births have been in excess. At\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, among the whites, for several years there have\r\nbeen ninety to ninety-nine masculine births. The reason or reasons of\r\nthese spontaneous oscillations in the proportion of the sexes still\r\nescapes us. We verify it only, and we are warranted in concluding that\r\nthe production of sex in the embryo depends on some relatively second\r\ncauses. It is sure, for example, that the clergy of England are not\r\nof a special race. If, however, they have more male children than the\r\nother inhabitants of England, the fact can only depend on intimate\r\nparticulars of their kind of life. This reminds us of certain biblical\r\nprecepts relative to conjugal life, and the too neglected theory of M.\r\nThury (of Geneva) on the influence of the degree of ovular maturity on\r\nthe production of the sexes.\r\n\r\nBut spontaneous oscillations in the proportion of the sexes are always\r\nfeeble; even the matrimonial type does not seem to influence them, for\r\nin the harems of Siam the sexual relation of births is the same as in\r\nEurope.[171] On the other hand, it is proved that race-horses, which\r\nare very polygamous, since they serve as stallions, have male and\r\nfemale descendants in exactly equal proportions.[172]\r\n\r\nIt is the social actions of men which produce the most profound\r\ndisturbances in the proportion of the sexes. To begin with, in savage\r\nor barbarous countries, where violent death has become an ordinary\r\noccurrence for men, the number of adult females much exceeds that of\r\nadult males. Thus, at Bantou, when the Dutch established themselves\r\nthere, they found ten women to one man.[173] In La Soñora, at the\r\nend of a civil war, there were seven women to one man. In spite of\r\nall moral and legal precepts, such conditions unfailingly result in\r\npolygamy, disguised or not.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, a custom very widely spread in savage countries, that\r\nof the infanticide of girls, not less necessarily engenders polyandry,\r\nif the equilibrium in the numerical proportion of the sexes is not\r\nre-established in another manner. In reality, the infanticide of\r\ngirls has been largely practised in nearly all polyandrous countries.\r\nIt seems also that the custom of sacrificing the female children\r\ninfluences in the long run the natural production of the sexes.\r\nThus the polyandrous Todas, who _formerly_ killed their girls, have\r\nactually a sexual proportion of 133.3 for adults, and of 124 for the\r\nchildren.[174]\r\n\r\nIn Polynesia, where the infanticide of girls was so largely practised,\r\nthe sexual relation to-day is altogether in favour of male births.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand the proportion of the sexes in 1858 was 130.3 for\r\nadults, and 122.2 for non-adults.[175]\r\n\r\nIn 1839, in the Sandwich Islands, the numerical proportion was 125.08\r\nfor adults, and 125.75 for non-adults.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 a general census of all the Sandwich Islands gave for the\r\nnumerical proportion of the sexes 125.36.\r\n\r\nBut there is more than one way of falsifying the proportion of the\r\nsexes. It is not necessary to kill nearly all the female children,\r\nas was the custom among the Gonds of Bengal, where in many villages\r\nMacpherson did not see a single girl;[176] it suffices to sell them.\r\nIt is even the sale of girls which in many countries has at first\r\nrestrained the savage practice of feminine infanticide. Girls became a\r\nmerchandise negotiated by the parents, and afterwards redeemed by the\r\nmen, because they could not do without them; but then it happened, in\r\nvarious countries and among various races, that men joined together to\r\nlighten the expense, and that several of them contented themselves with\r\none wife in common, became polyandrous.\r\n\r\nBut we must not believe, with certain sociologists, that polyandry has\r\never been a universal and necessary matrimonial phase. The enormous\r\nconsumption of men, necessitated by a savage or barbarous life, has\r\noften given an impulse to polygamy. It is only in certain societies\r\nwhere the practice of female infanticide exceeded all measure, or in\r\ncertain islands, or certain regions with little or no population,\r\nwhere conquerors badly off for wives came to settle, that polyandry has\r\nbecome general and enduring. It is surely only an exceptional form of\r\nmarriage, and we can enumerate the countries where it has been or is\r\nstill in use.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Ethnography of Polyandry._\r\n\r\nCæsar speaks thus of the polyandry of the ancient Britons:--“By tens\r\nand twelves the husbands have their wives in common, especially\r\nbrothers with brothers, and parents with children.”[177]\r\n\r\nI have previously quoted Strabo on the polyandry of the primitive\r\nArabs, which was also fraternal.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century the Guanches of two of the Canary Isles,\r\nLancerote and Tortaventura, were still polyandrous, but amongst them\r\nthe husbands did not number more than three.[178]\r\n\r\nPolyandry also existed in New Zealand and in the Marquesas, but\r\nrestricted to certain women only.[179]\r\n\r\nIn America, amongst the Avaroes and the Maypures, according to\r\nHumboldt, brothers had often only one wife.\r\n\r\nBut the great polyandric centres exist or have existed in Asia, in\r\nIndia, Ceylon, and Thibet. Various aboriginal tribes of India, nearly\r\nalways much addicted to female infanticide, have practised polyandry.\r\nThe Miris and Dophlas of Bengal are still polyandrous.[180] Among the\r\nTodas of Nilgherry polyandry was fraternal. When a man married a girl,\r\nshe became on that account the wife of all his brothers, and inversely\r\nthese became the husbands of all the sisters of the wife. The first\r\nchild born of these marriages was attributed to the eldest brother, the\r\nsecond to the next brother, and so forth.[181]\r\n\r\nBut polyandry has not flourished only among the primitive races of\r\nIndia. The Hindoo populations had also adopted it, and traces of it are\r\nfound in their sacred literature. Thus in the Mahabharata the five\r\nPandou brothers marry all together the charming Drâaupadi, with eyes\r\nof lotus blue.[182] But in Brahmanic India polyandry is more than a\r\nmere memory. Skinner has proved that near the sources of the Djemmah,\r\namongst a very fine race of Hindoo mountaineers, fraternal polyandry\r\nstill prevailed. “Having asked one of these women,” says the traveller,\r\n“how many husbands she had--‘Only four,’ she replied. ‘And all living?’\r\n‘Why not?’”\r\n\r\nThese customs, according to the traveller, did not hinder these\r\nmountaineers from being, on other points, very moral men. Thus they\r\nheld lying in horror, and in their eyes to deviate from the truth, even\r\nquite innocently, was almost a sacrilege.[183]\r\n\r\nAt the other extremity of India, in Ceylon, the polyandric _régime_ is\r\nstill very flourishing, especially in the interior of the island, and\r\namong the leisured classes. The number of husbands, generally brothers\r\nor relatives, is variable; it varies from three to eight. According\r\nto Emerson Tennent, polyandry was formerly general in the island, and\r\nit is owing to the efforts of the Dutch and Portuguese that it has\r\ndisappeared from the coast.[184]\r\n\r\nIt is particularly in lamaic Thibet that the polyandric _régime_ is\r\nin full vigour; and in this country religion strengthens it, for the\r\nmost distinguished men, the ruling classes, the chiefs or officers of\r\nthe State, _a fortiori_ the lamas, have the same disdain for marriage\r\nso loudly professed by the saints of Catholicism. The greater number\r\nexempt themselves from it, and leave to the common people the gross\r\ncare of producing children. Now, the latter, by reason of their\r\npoverty, associate together to lighten the burden of the family. It is,\r\nagain, fraternal polyandry which is the rule in Thibet. It is in this\r\ncountry that sociologists have sought the classic type of this kind of\r\npolyandry.\r\n\r\nIn Thibet the right of primogeniture is combined with the right of\r\nmarriage, and the younger brothers follow the fate of their chief.\r\nIt is this last who marries for all of them, and chooses the common\r\nwife.[185] However, if we may believe other accounts, a certain liberty\r\nis allowed to younger brothers. The pressure on them is chiefly\r\neconomic. When the eldest son marries, the property is transmitted\r\nto him in advance of his inheritance, with the charge of maintaining\r\nhis parents, who, however, can live in a separate house. The youngest\r\nbrother takes orders, and becomes a lama. The others, if they choose,\r\nbecome inferior husbands of the wife, who with us would be their\r\nsister-in-law, and they are almost forced to do this, since their\r\neldest brother is sole inheritor. Once within the polyandric _régime_,\r\nthe younger brothers have a subordinate position. The eldest, the\r\nhusband-in-chief, considers them as his servants, and has even the\r\nright to send them away without any resource, if he pleases. If the\r\nprincipal husband dies, then his widow, his property, and his authority\r\npass to the younger brother next in age. In the case of the brother not\r\nbeing one of the co-husbands, he cannot inherit the property without\r\nthe wife, nor the wife without the property. We have here, then, a sort\r\nof polyandrian levirate.[186]\r\n\r\nThe children springing from these unions give the name of father\r\nsometimes to the eldest of the husbands, and sometimes to all.[187]\r\nTravellers tell us that these polyandrous households are not more\r\ntroubled than our monogamous ones. Some Thibetans, living thus in\r\nconjugal association, could not understand V. Jacquemont when he\r\nasked them if the preference of their single wife for one or other of\r\nthem did not cause quarrels between the husbands. But if jealousy is\r\nunknown to the husbands, it is, on the contrary, frequent with the\r\nwife. “A Thibetan woman,” says Turner, “united to several husbands, is\r\nas jealous of her conjugal rights as an Indian despot could be of the\r\nbeauties who people his zenana or harem.”[188]\r\n\r\nAs to the manner in which the intimate relations between husbands and\r\nwife are regulated in the polyandric households of Thibet, we have\r\nscarcely any information. Among the Todas the wife never had conjugal\r\ncommerce with more than one husband at a time, but she changed every\r\nmonth; sometimes also the associated husbands add to their number\r\ntemporarily some young man belonging to the tribe, but not yet engaged\r\nin the bonds of wedlock.[189]\r\n\r\nThere is another form of polyandry besides the fraternal, but quite\r\nas curious, and which has been made to play a great _rôle_ in various\r\nsociological theories. It is the polyandry of the Naïrs, an indigenous\r\nhigh caste of Malabar.\r\n\r\nHowever extraordinary the fraternal polyandry called Thibetan may\r\nseem in our eyes, that of the Naïrs of Malabar is far more so. Here\r\nthe reality exceeds all that we could have imagined in the way of\r\nconjugal customs. The Naïr parents married their daughters early. The\r\nbride was rarely more than twelve years old. The proceedings began\r\nwith an ephemeral union, a sort of fictitious marriage, but celebrated\r\nnevertheless with great rejoicings in presence of parents and friends.\r\nThe initiative and provisional husband passed round the neck of the\r\nbride the conjugal collar, the _tali_, and henceforth the marriage\r\nwas concluded and had to be consummated; only at the end of four or\r\nfive days the new husband was obliged to quit the house of the wife\r\nfor ever. On the contrary, the young bride remained in the family, and\r\nfrom this period contracted a series of partial but durable marriages.\r\nThe first marriage of the young Naïr girl had evidently no other\r\nobject than defloration; it was a service demanded of a fictitious\r\nhusband, and for which he was often paid. A traveller relates that\r\nfor this preliminary marriage a porter or a workman was employed and\r\npaid. If his pretensions were too high, recourse was had to an Arab\r\nor a stranger; and, says the narrator, the gratuitous services of\r\nthese last were always preferred if, when the ceremony was over, they\r\nwithdrew in time and with good grace. When once well and duly prepared\r\nfor marriage, the young Naïr girl might take for husband whomsoever\r\nshe liked, except the provisional husband of the first few days.[190]\r\nThe number of her husbands varied from four to twelve.[191] Each one\r\nof them was at first presented to her either by her mother or by her\r\nmaternal uncle, an important personage in the family. Each co-partner\r\nwas in his turn husband in reality during a very short time, varying\r\nfrom one day to ten, and he was free, on his side, to participate in\r\ndivers polyandric conjugal societies. We are assured that in these\r\ncurious _ménages_ all the associated husbands lived in very good\r\nunderstanding with each other.[192]\r\n\r\nGenerally the Naïr husbands were neither brothers nor relatives, for\r\nthese polyandrous people seemed to have ideas about incest analogous to\r\nour own. But the unions outside the caste were the only ones reputed\r\nculpable; they constituted a sort of social adultery. The conjugal\r\nprerogatives of the husbands were not unaccompanied by certain duties.\r\nThey had to maintain the common wife, and they agreed together to share\r\nthe expense. One took on himself to furnish the clothes, another to\r\ngive the rice.[193] On these conditions each one could in his turn\r\nenjoy the common property, and, in order not to be troubled in the use\r\nof his rights, it sufficed the husband on duty to hang on the door of\r\nthe house and on the wife’s door his shield and his sword or knife.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmins were obliged to tolerate these polyandric marriages, so\r\ncontrary, however, to their laws; they finished by even deriving a\r\nprofit from them. In the Brahmanic families in contact with the Naïrs\r\nthe eldest son alone married, so as not to scatter the patrimony; the\r\nothers entered the matrimonial combinations of the Naïrs, and thus\r\ntheir children did not inherit.[194]\r\n\r\nOn their side, the Naïrs were naturally only acquainted with\r\nmatriarchal heredity. No Naïr, says Buchanan, knows his father, and\r\nevery man has for heirs the children of his sister. He loves them as\r\nif they were his own, and unless he is reputed a monster, he must show\r\nmuch more grief at their death than he would for his own possible\r\nchildren--namely, those of his own wife.[195]\r\n\r\nIn comparing the two kinds of polyandry that I have just described, the\r\npatriarchal polyandry of the Thibetans, and the matriarchal polyandry\r\nof the Naïrs, the majority of sociologists consider the first as\r\nsuperior to the other. In so doing they seem to me not to be able to\r\nshake off sufficiently our European ideas. Doubtless the fraternal\r\nThibetan polyandry, while leaving undecided the paternal filiation of\r\nthe children, assures them a sort of collective paternal parenthood,\r\nsince the fathers are of the same blood. This polyandrian family\r\nconsequently differs less than the Naïr family from our own system of\r\npatriarchal kinship, which is reputed superior; but surely the liberty,\r\nand even the dignity of the woman, which must count for something, are\r\nmore respected under the Naïr system, which not only does not reduce\r\nthe woman to a thing possessed, that one lends to one’s friends, but\r\ngives her the power of choosing her husbands.\r\n\r\nFraternal polyandry being declared superior to polyandry of the Naïr\r\ntype, it has been concluded that in virtue of the law of progress\r\nit must have been preceded in all times and places by the latter.\r\nAs regards the greater number of cases of Thibetan polyandry, the\r\nsupposition is gratuitous; it seems, however, established as far as\r\nancient Arabia is concerned, where, thanks to a very learned treatise\r\nrecently published by Mr. W. Robertson Smith, professor of Arabic at\r\nthe University of Cambridge,[196] we may note the causes of polyandry\r\nand follow its evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Polyandry in Ancient Arabia._\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of ancient Arabian polyandry was the one we find in\r\nnearly all the polyandric countries--that is to say, the infanticide of\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nThe primitive Arabs, extremely savage and even anthropophagous, were\r\nled to adopt the custom of female infanticide by the difficulty of\r\nliving in their arid country, where famines were very common. Down to\r\nthe present time the nomads of Arabia suffer constantly from hunger\r\nduring a great part of the year.[197]\r\n\r\nThe custom of infanticide was inveterate among the Arabs, and Mahomet\r\nwas obliged to condemn it over and over again in the Koran:--“They who\r\nfrom folly or ignorance kill their children shall perish.[198] Kill not\r\nyour children on account of poverty.[199] Kill not your children for\r\nfear of poverty; we will feed them, and you also.[200] When it shall be\r\nasked of the girl buried alive for what crime she is put to death ...\r\nevery soul will then acknowledge the work that she had done.”[201]\r\n\r\nIn this last verse the Koran bears witness to the custom of killing the\r\ngirls, and it indicates the process in use, which actually consisted\r\nin burying them alive. This was done openly, and often the grave of\r\nthe newly-born infant was dug by the side even of the couch of the\r\nmother who had just given birth to it. According to the morality of\r\nthe primitive Arabs, these acts were not only very simple, but even\r\nvirtuous and generous,[202] which seems to indicate that they were\r\nindeed only precautions against famine. An Arab legend, quoted by Mr.\r\nR. Smith, paints in lively colours these atrocious customs. It relates\r\nto a chief of Tamin, who became a constant practitioner of infanticide\r\nin consequence of a wound given to his pride. He was called Caïs, and\r\nwas contemporary with Mahomet. The daughter of his sister was carried\r\noff in a razzia and given to the son of her captor, as was the usage\r\nin Arabia, where the captured women made part of the booty and were\r\ndivided with it. This time, when Caïs came to reclaim his niece by\r\noffering to pay her ransom, the latter, being well pleased with the\r\nadventure, refused to quit her husband. Caïs, the uncle, was mortally\r\noffended, and from that moment he interred alive all his daughters,\r\naccording to the ancient custom. But one day, during his absence, a\r\ndaughter was born to him, whom the mother secretly sent to a relative\r\nto save her, and then declared to her husband that she had been\r\ndelivered of a still-born child. Some years later, the girl, grown\r\ntall, came to pay a visit to her mother. Caïs discovered her, while\r\nher mother was plaiting her hair and ornamenting it with cowries. “I\r\narrived,” the father is made to say, speaking to Mahomet, “and I said,\r\n‘Who is this young girl?’ ‘She is yours,’ replied the mother, weeping,\r\nand she related how she had formerly saved her. I waited till the\r\nemotion of the mother was calmed; then one day I led away the girl; I\r\ndug a grave and I made her lie down in it. She cried, ‘Father, what do\r\nyou intend to do with me?’ Then I covered her with earth. She cried\r\nagain, ‘Father, do you wish to bury me? Are you going away, and will\r\nyou abandon me?’ But I continued to heap earth on her until her cries\r\nwere stifled. That was the only time it has happened to me to feel pity\r\nin burying a daughter.”[203]\r\n\r\nSuch customs, combined with the sale to strangers of girls carried\r\noff in razzias, and the polygamy of the rich men, must assuredly have\r\nprofoundly disturbed the numerical proportion of the sexes, and have\r\nrendered polyandry almost a necessity, which, besides, could not\r\nexcite any scruple with the ancient Arabs, whose morals were very\r\nlicentious. Thus the captured women often remained common to a group of\r\nrelatives.[204] In the fifth century the Syrio-Roman law had even to\r\nforbid the contracts of fraternity, by which all was held in common,\r\nincluding the wives and children.[205]\r\n\r\nThat fraternal polyandry, called Thibetan, may have existed in Arabia,\r\nthe passage of Strabo, which I have previously quoted in regard to\r\npromiscuity, would suffice to establish; but Arab writers expressly\r\nattest it, and notably Bokhâri (vi. 127), according to whom the number\r\nof polyandrous husbands was not allowed to exceed ten; besides this,\r\nvarious customs of more modern date, as, for example, the passing of\r\nthe widow, by heritage, to the relatives of the husband, seem to arise\r\nfrom it. Moreover, even at the present day in Arabia, the father cannot\r\ngive his daughter to another if the son of his brother demands her, and\r\nthe latter has the right to obtain her at a lower price;[206] this is\r\nthe right of pre-emption applied to the woman.\r\n\r\nIt seems, indeed, as if these were the vestiges of an antique\r\nfraternal polyandry, and it is in fact of fraternal or Thibetan\r\npolyandry that Strabo speaks. Has this fraternal patriarchal polyandry\r\nbeen preceded by a matriarchal polyandry, after the mode of the\r\nNaïrs--a polyandry which did not make the woman the property of the\r\nhusbands? Without being able to give a direct proof of this, we may,\r\nhowever, consider it as very probable. In the present day the partial\r\nmarriages, by which the women of the Hassinyeh Arabs engage themselves\r\nfor some days of the week only, strongly resemble the matriarchal\r\npolyandry of the Naïrs, and temporary marriage, or _mot’a_, of the\r\nancient Arabs approaches nearly to it also.\r\n\r\nIt is this kind of marriage, in all probability, that the prophet means\r\nwhen he inveighs against “fornication.”\r\n\r\nBy the _mot’a_ marriage the woman does not leave her home; her tribe\r\npreserves the rights it has over her, and her children do not belong\r\nto the husband. In short, the conjugal union is only contracted for a\r\nfixed time. These _mot’a_ marriages had nothing dishonourable in them,\r\nand did not in the least prevent the women from finding fresh husbands\r\nwhen, at the expiration of the lease, they became once more free.[207]\r\n\r\nThe custom of _mot’a_ marriage was long prevalent in Arabia. Ammianus\r\nspeaks of it,[208] saying that the wife received a price or indemnity\r\nfrom her temporary husband, and that, if it happened to the contracting\r\nparties to wish to continue to live together at the expiration of\r\nthe time fixed, they inaugurated a fresh and more durable union by\r\na symbolic ceremony, during which the wife offered to her husband a\r\njavelin and a tent.\r\n\r\nThe prophet himself decided with great hesitation to condemn the\r\n_mot’a_ marriage. A tradition makes him say that “if a man and a woman\r\nagree together, their union should last for three nights, after which\r\nthey may separate or live together, as they please.”[209]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the _mot’a_ marriage was only abolished in the time of Omar;\r\nand it is important to remark with regard to it, that this mode of\r\nmarriage, singular as it may appear to us, was, for the woman, very\r\nsuperior to the servitude of the Mussulman harem. It was a personal\r\ncontract, in which her parents did not interfere, and which did not\r\ndegrade her from the rank of an independent person to the humiliation\r\nof merely being a thing possessed. The _mot’ a_ marriage indicates,\r\nbesides, very free manners, as is attested by a number of facts and\r\ntraditions, particularly certain religious rites of the Canaanites, the\r\nAramites, and the pagan Hebrews, and also the licentious practices of\r\nwomen and girls in the temple of Baalbek.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the _mot’ a_ marriage gave place to a definite marriage,\r\nthe _ba’al_ marriage, by which the young girl went to live with her\r\nhusband and owed him fidelity. Marriages of this kind were sought at\r\nfirst by the chiefs, to whom they assured alliances. As a consequence\r\nthese unions became honourable, and dethroned the ancient matrimonial\r\ncustom.[210] Henceforth the women who continued to live in the ancient\r\nmode were dishonoured, and treated as prostitutes, whose dwelling was\r\nindicated by a special flag. At the same time the taste for paternity\r\nwas born in men, and, in case of doubt on this matter, sages whose\r\nprofession it was, declared the signs by which a man could recognise\r\nhis own offspring.[211]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Polyandry in General._\r\n\r\nI have quoted or made a summary of nearly all the information that\r\nhas reached us on the subject of ancient and modern polyandry. From\r\nthence we may conclude that in no way are we authorised to consider\r\nthis form of conjugal union as having been general. Still it has become\r\na necessity in a good number of gross societies. It has specially\r\nprevailed in countries badly supplied with food, where the struggle\r\nfor existence was severe, where warlike conflicts with neighbouring\r\ntribes were incessant, and where, in order to endure, the community\r\nwas forced to diminish the _impedimenta_ and the useless mouths. In\r\nsuch conditions, men still savage or barbarous have recourse without\r\nhesitation all over the world to female infanticide; and as, on the\r\nother side, the chiefs and strong men monopolise as many women as\r\npossible, the debauchery of unmarried women and polyandrian households\r\nbecome necessary palliatives.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there are two principal kinds of polyandry--the\r\nmatriarchal and patriarchal. In the first, the woman or girl does not\r\nquit her family or her _gens_; sometimes even she is permitted the\r\nright of choosing her husbands, who are not related to each other, and\r\nupon whom the woman scarcely depends at all, since she remains with her\r\nown relations, and bears children for them.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, in the patriarchal polyandry, the woman, captured or\r\nbought, is almost entirely uprooted; she leaves her natural protectors\r\nto go and live with her husbands, to whom she belongs, who are limited\r\nin number, are nearly always brothers or relations, and to whom she\r\ncannot be unfaithful without authorisation.\r\n\r\nBoth forms of polyandric marriage suppose a complete absence of\r\nmodesty, of sexual reserve and moral delicacy. But we know that these\r\nqualities can only be the fruit of long culture. In this respect both\r\nmatriarchal and patriarchal polygamy are equal. But it is important to\r\nobserve that the first enslaves woman much less. On the other hand,\r\nthe second already permits the establishment of a sort of paternal\r\nfiliation, since the husbands are generally of the same blood. For this\r\nreason it is reputed superior.\r\n\r\nIn reality matriarchal polyandry always coincides with the primitive\r\nfamily form, the matriarchate--that is to say, with a system that takes\r\nno account of paternal filiation, and leaves the children to the tribe\r\nof the mother.\r\n\r\nPatriarchal polyandry, on the contrary, already presents the outline of\r\na sort of paternal family, with the right of primogeniture attributed\r\nto the first-born.\r\n\r\nWe shall have to study in detail both the patriarchate and the\r\nmatriarchate. Polyandry, in its reputedly highest form, the Thibetan,\r\nonly constitutes a patriarchate of the most imperfect kind, since there\r\nis still a confusion of fatherhood.\r\n\r\nProof is still wanting to force us to conclude that matriarchal\r\npolyandry must always have preceded the other. This appears to be true\r\nfor ancient Arabia only. In all other places we can merely suppose\r\nit to have been so. We should be equally mistaken if we admitted _a\r\npriori_ that patriarchal polyandry implies a degree of civilisation\r\nsuperior to that of the countries where matriarchal polyandry prevails.\r\nThe ancient Arabs, of whom Strabo speaks, practised fraternal\r\npolyandry, and yet we know that they were scarcely civilised, they\r\nwere cannibals, and so ferocious that their wives accompanied them in\r\ncombats in order to despatch and mutilate the wounded enemies. These\r\nfuries made themselves necklaces and bracelets for their ankles with\r\nthe nose and ears of a dead enemy,[212] and sometimes even they ate his\r\nliver.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, polyandry is an exceptional conjugal form, as rare as\r\npolygamy is common. It must be classed with experimental and term\r\nmarriages. With our European ideas on conjugal fidelity, obligatory\r\nby the right of proprietorship, we can scarcely conceive even of the\r\npossibility of this perfect absence of jealousy, this placidity of the\r\nco-husbands. It is indelicate, doubtless. But how shall we describe our\r\nmorality and the laws that give to the deceived husband the right of\r\nlife and death over his faithless companion, and in this respect bring\r\nus down to the level of the savage? Do indelicate manners rank lower\r\nthan ferocious manners? They are both those of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[169] Darwin, _Descent of Man_, p. 278.\r\n\r\n[170] A.

If, however, we cannot dispense with the special study of\r\nmarriage by capture, it is because it has been made to play a chief\r\n_rôle_ in sociology. According to some authors, it has been a universal\r\nnecessity, and must have preceded exogamy in all times and places.\r\n\r\nSurely this too general theory may be contested; but it is beyond doubt\r\nthat the rape of women has been widely practised all over the world,\r\nthat very often it has been considered glorious, and that in many\r\ncountries it has been attenuated into pacific marriage.\r\n\r\nNothing is more natural and simple than rape among savage or barbarous\r\ntribes, who hold violence in esteem and use it largely, and who, as we\r\nhave previously seen, are almost always addicted to female infanticide.\r\nBut has the widely-spread custom of rape the great importance in\r\nsociological theory that has been attributed to it? This is a question\r\nto which we can only reply after having consulted the facts.\r\n\r\nThroughout Melanesia capture has been the primitive means of procuring\r\nwives, or rather slaves-of-all-work, absolutely at the discretion\r\nof the ravisher. Bonwick, indeed, tells us that in Tasmania, and\r\nconsequently in Australia, capture was more often simulated only, and\r\nresulted from a previous agreement between the man and woman;[213] but\r\nthe savage manner in which the rape was effected abundantly proves that\r\namiable agreement was exceptional. The Australian who desires to carry\r\noff a woman belonging to another tribe prowls traitorously around the\r\ncamp. If he happens to discover a woman without a protector he rushes\r\non her, stuns her with a blow of his club (_douak_), seizes her by\r\nher thick hair, drags her thus into the neighbouring wood; then, when\r\nshe has recovered her senses, he obliges her to follow him into the\r\nmidst of his own people, and there he violates her in their presence,\r\nfor she has become his property--his domestic animal.[2] The captured\r\nwoman generally resigns herself without difficulty;[214] in truth, she\r\nhas, generally, changed her master, but not in the least changed her\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nSometimes two men unite to commit one of these rapes. They glide\r\nnoiselessly into a neighbouring camp in the night; one of them winds\r\nround his barbed spear the hair of a sleeping _lubra_, the other\r\npoints his spear at her bosom. She awakes, and dares not cry out; they\r\ntake her off, bind her to a tree, and then return in the same manner\r\nto make a second capture; after that they return in triumph to their\r\nown people.[215] The captives rarely revolt, for they are, in a way,\r\naccustomed to the capture. From infancy they have been familiarised\r\nwith the fate that awaits them, for the simulation of the rape is one\r\nof the games of the Australian children.[216] Later the life of a\r\npretty Australian girl is marked by a series of plots to carry her off,\r\nand of successive rapes, which force her to pass from hand to hand,\r\nand expose her to wounds received in conflicts, and to bad treatment\r\ninflicted by the other women amongst whom she is introduced. Sometimes\r\nshe is dragged very far, even hundreds of miles from the place of her\r\nbirth.[217]\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the tribe to which the ravished woman belongs to\r\navenge her, and the Australian has, after his own manner, a strong\r\nsentiment of certain obligations, which for him are moral; but more\r\nfrequently, to escape too great damages, the tribes hold a meeting, and\r\nthe ravisher submits to a symbolic retaliation agreed on beforehand.\r\nArmed with his little shield of bark, he takes his place at about forty\r\nyards from a group of ten warriors belonging to the aggrieved tribe,\r\nand each one of these throws two or three darts at him, which are\r\nnearly always avoided or parried. Thenceforth the offence is effaced,\r\nand peace re-established.[218]\r\n\r\nThe same customs prevail among the Papuans of New Guinea. At Bali the\r\nmen carry off and violate brutally the solitary women they may meet;\r\nand afterwards they agree with the tribe as to compensation.[219] In\r\nlike manner, in the Fiji Isles, rape, real or simulated, was general\r\nand even glorious. A particular divinity presided over it. The ravished\r\nwoman either fled to a protector or resigned herself, and then a feast\r\ngiven to the parents terminated the affair.[220]\r\n\r\nTo be able to see in these bestial customs anything resembling\r\nmarriage, one must be a prey to a fixed idea--a positive matrimonial\r\nmonomania. There is here no marriage by capture, but rather slavery\r\nby capture. This is not the only method of procuring wives practised\r\nby the Australians. They often proceed pacifically by traffic, and a\r\nman acquires a wife by giving in exchange another woman of whom he\r\nhas power to dispose--a sister or relative.[221] Certain tribes had\r\nalso instituted a sort of regulated promiscuity--a collective marriage\r\nbetween all the men of one clan and all the women of another. I shall\r\nhave to return to the consideration of this singular form of sexual\r\nassociation. For the moment I confine myself to noticing that rape is\r\nnot always obligatory in Australia.\r\n\r\nNeither is it so among the negroes of Africa; it is even more rare\r\nthere than in Melanesia, but there also it does not constitute a\r\nmarriage. Women are carried off just in the same way as other things\r\nare carried off. Thus the Damara Hottentots often steal wives from the\r\nNamaquois Hottentots.[222] Among the Mandingos and the Timanis there is\r\nno marriage by capture, properly speaking; already they purchase the\r\ndaughter from her parents, without, of course, consulting her; then the\r\nintending purchaser, aided by his friends, carries off his acquisition\r\nin a brutal manner, whether she will or not. It is a simple commercial\r\naffair; the daughter is an exchange value representing a certain number\r\nof jars of palm wine, of stuffs, etc.\r\n\r\nAmongst the natives of America brutal rape was, or still is, very\r\ncommon. In Terra del Fuego, the young Fuegians carry off a woman as\r\nsoon as they are able to construct or procure a canoe.[223] From tribe\r\nto tribe the Patagonians at war exterminate the men and carry off the\r\nwomen. The Oen Patagonians make incursions every year at the time of\r\n“the red leaf” on the Fuegians to seize their women, their dogs, and\r\ntheir weapons.[224] The Indians on the banks of the Amazon and Orinoco\r\ncontinually capture women, and thus every tribe is sometimes nearly\r\nwithout women and sometimes overflowing with them.[225] The Caribs so\r\nfrequently procured wives in this way that their women did not often\r\nspeak the language of the men.[226] In the Redskin tribe of the Mandans\r\nthe rape of young women was a perpetual cause of trouble, of disorder,\r\nand of vengeance, proportioned to the power and to the anger of the\r\nrelations of the ravished woman.[227]\r\n\r\nWe find similar customs among savage or barbarous peoples nearly\r\neverywhere. The Tartars, says Barnes, make their wives of the prisoners\r\nthat they capture in battles.[228]\r\n\r\nThe Code of Manu also mentions this primitive mode of union more or\r\nless conjugal:--“When a young girl is carried off by force from the\r\nparental house, weeping and crying for succour, and those who oppose\r\nthis violence are killed or wounded, and a breach is made in the walls,\r\nthis mode (of marriage) is called that of the giants.”[229]\r\n\r\nThe Bible relates several facts of the same kind. Thus the tribe of\r\nBenjamin procured themselves wives by massacring the inhabitants of\r\nJabez-Gilead and capturing four hundred of their virgins. Another time\r\nthe Benjamites practised a Sabine rape in carrying off the women during\r\na feast near Bethel.\r\n\r\nThe Israelites, having vanquished the Midianites, killed all the\r\nmen, according to the Semitic custom, and took away the cattle, the\r\nchildren, and the women.[230] But Moses, always directly inspired by\r\nthe Lord, ordered them to put to death the women and even the male\r\nchildren, and to keep the young girls and virgins.[231] There were\r\nsixteen thousand maidens, of whom thirty-two were reserved for the\r\nLord’s share, which doubtless means for the priests. Of the sheep,\r\noxen, asses, and maidens that remained, Moses further deducted the\r\nfiftieth part, which he gave to the Levites of the tabernacle.[232]\r\n\r\nThis ferocity and this coarse assimilation of captured women to cattle\r\nare not peculiar to the people of God, but prevailed amongst the\r\nprimitive Arabs,[233] or rather amongst all the Semites, who were still\r\nsavage or barbarous.\r\n\r\nCapture in war has, besides, been largely practised by all races and\r\nthroughout the world. An old Irish poem, the “Duan Eiranash,” speaks\r\nof three hundred women carried off by the Picts from the Gaels, who,\r\nfinding themselves thus deprived of their women by a single blow,\r\nallied themselves then with the Irish.\r\n\r\nI will confine myself to these examples, gleaned from all parts, and\r\nwhich it would be easy to multiply. They amply suffice to establish\r\nthat in primitive societies woman, being held in very low esteem, is\r\nabsolutely reduced to the level of chattels and of domestic animals;\r\nthat she represents a booty like any other; that her master can use\r\nand abuse her without fear. But in these bestial practices there is\r\nnothing which approaches, even distantly, to marriage, and we are not\r\nin the least warranted to call these brutal rapes marriages. Even in\r\nthe countries where a true marriage exists, the customs and the laws\r\ntolerate for a long time the introduction into the house of the husband\r\nof captured slaves, who are treated by the master as concubines by\r\nthe side of the legitimate wife or wives. The heroes of Homer profit\r\nlargely by this legal tolerance, and when the Clytemnestra of Æschylus\r\njustifies herself for having killed her husband, she alleges, among\r\nother extenuating circumstances, the intimacy of Agamemnon with his\r\nslave Cassandra.\r\n\r\nAssuredly in all this there is no marriage. We shall presently see that\r\nin many countries the concubinate, legal and patent, has co-existed, or\r\nco-exists, by the side of marriage without being confounded with it.\r\nIt is important to reserve the name of _marriage by capture_ to legal\r\nand pacific marriage, in the ceremonial of which we find practices\r\nrecalling or simulating by survival the primitive rape of woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Marriage by Capture._\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that this symbolic rape does not always signify\r\nthat the capture of the woman has preceded pacific conjugal union. It\r\nrepresents especially a mental survival, the tradition of an epoch,\r\nmore or less distant, when violence was held in high esteem, and when\r\nit was glorious to procure slaves for all sorts of labour by force of\r\narms. In the countries where the ceremonial of capture exists, the\r\nfine times of rape are generally somewhat gone by, but the mind is\r\nstill haunted by it, and even in peaceful marriages, after the contract\r\nor bargain is concluded, men like to symbolise in the ceremonial the\r\nrapes of former days, which they cannot and dare not any longer commit.\r\nThese practices have also another bearing: they signify that the bride,\r\nthen nearly always purchased from her parents, must be in complete\r\nsubjection to the master that has been given her, and occupy the\r\nhumblest place in the conjugal house.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons the symbolic ceremonial of capture has been, or\r\nis still, in use with many races at the celebration of their marriages.\r\nIn some degree it is found all over the world. Among the Esquimaux of\r\nCape York the marriages are arranged in a friendly way by the parents\r\nof the future couple, and nevertheless, from the infancy of the latter,\r\nthe conjugal ceremony must simulate a capture. The future bride must\r\nfly, must defend herself with her feet and hands, scream at the height\r\nof her voice, until her new master has succeeded in taking her to his\r\nhut, where she at once settles happily.[234]\r\n\r\nIn the same way, in Greenland the bridegroom captures his bride, or has\r\nher captured for him; and in the latter case he has recourse to the\r\nhelp of two or three old women.[235]\r\n\r\nWith the Indians of Canada, where sometimes a true marriage is\r\nconcluded in presence of the chief of the tribe, when he has pronounced\r\nthe matrimonial formula, “the husband turns round, stoops down,\r\ntakes his wife on his back, and carries her to his tent, amid the\r\nacclamations of the spectators.”[236]\r\n\r\nSome Redskin tribes, observed by Lafitau, symbolised rape even in the\r\nintimate relations between young couples. The husband was obliged\r\nto enter the wigwam of his wife in the night; it would be a grave\r\nimpropriety for him to approach it in the day-time.[237]\r\n\r\nIn ancient Guatemala, where marriages were celebrated with a certain\r\npomp, the father of the bridegroom sent a deputation of friends to seek\r\nthe bride, and one of these messengers had to take the girl on his\r\nshoulders and carry her to an appointed spot, near the house of the\r\nbridegroom.[238]\r\n\r\nIn Asia, over the vast Mongol region extending from Kamtschatka to the\r\ncountry of the Turcomans, the ceremonial of capture is always held in\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nThis symbolism of capture is especially curious with the\r\nKamtschatdales. There it is not as a conqueror that the husband enters\r\nthe family of the wife, since he must first do an act of servitude,\r\nfind the parents of the girl he desires, put himself at their service,\r\nand take his part in the domestic labour. This period of probation\r\nmay last a long time, even years,[239] and surely it is a singular\r\nprelude to a marriage by violent capture. However, when the time of the\r\nnovitiate is over, the future husband is allowed to triumph violently\r\nand publicly over the resistance of his bride. She is armed with thick\r\ngarments, one over the other, and with straps and cords. Besides this\r\nshe is guarded and defended by the women of the _iourte_. However, the\r\nmarriage is not definitely concluded until the bridegroom, surmounting\r\nall these obstacles, succeeds in effecting on his well-defended bride a\r\nsort of outrage on modesty, that she herself must acknowledge by crying\r\n_ni ni_ in a plaintive tone. But the girls and women of the guard fall\r\non the assailant with great cries and blows, tear his hair, scratch\r\nhis face, and sometimes throw him. Victory often necessitates repeated\r\nassaults and many days of combat. When at last it is gained, and the\r\nbride has herself acknowledged it, the marriage is settled, and is\r\nconsummated the same evening in the _iourte_ of the bride, who is not\r\ntaken to her husband’s house till the next day.[240]\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial of capture still continues in the marriages of the\r\nKalmucks, the Tungouses, and the Turcomans, but has become less coarse.\r\n\r\nWith the Kalmucks the girl is first bought from her father, and\r\nthen, after a pretended resistance, is carried away on a horse ready\r\nsaddled.[241] The custom varies: sometimes it is enough to place the\r\nbride, by force, on a horse; sometimes she flees, always on horseback,\r\nbut is pursued and caught by the bridegroom, who consummates the\r\nmarriage on the spot, and then conducts his prize to his tent.[242]\r\n\r\nThe Tungouses, coarser still, proceed by an attempt on modesty, as with\r\nthe Kamtschatdales; the bridegroom must attack his bride and tear her\r\nclothes.[243]\r\n\r\nWith the Turcomans, marriage can be concluded with or without the\r\nconsent of the parents. In the latter case, the young people fly and\r\nseek refuge in a neighbouring _obah_. They are always well received\r\nthere, and remain a month or six weeks. During this time the elders\r\nof the two _obahs_ negotiate an arrangement with the parents; they\r\nagree on the price of the girl, who afterwards returns to the paternal\r\ndomicile; she must remain six months or a year, or even longer, before\r\nliving with her husband, and during all this time he may only see her\r\nsecretly. Sometimes the flight is executed with the previous consent\r\nof the parents, and then it is no more than a symbolic capture,[244] a\r\ncomedy.\r\n\r\nIn reality rape, more or less real, is often replaced by a simple\r\nceremonial with the greater part of the nomads of Central Asia, and\r\nnotably the Turcomans. Then the young girl, clothed in her bridal\r\ncostume, bestrides a fiery horse, which she puts to a gallop, having\r\nat the saddle a kid or a lamb freshly killed. The bridegroom and all\r\nthe wedding guests, also on horseback, pursue the future wife, who,\r\nby clever turns and evolutions, hides herself, and hinders them from\r\nseizing the animal she has carried off.[245] All this is plainly the\r\nmere mimic of rape, and there is in these divers customs a designed\r\ngradation: at first the actual stealing of the girl, with the\r\nunderstanding that the affair will not end tragically; then a stealing\r\nthat may be called legal, as it is authorised by the parents; at length\r\nthe simple ceremony symbolic of rape by violence.\r\n\r\nCustoms very similar to these are found with a certain number of the\r\naborigines of Bengal.\r\n\r\nThe Kurmis and other _sudras_ celebrate marriage by a pretended\r\ncombat. Sometimes the bridegrooms mark their foreheads with blood,\r\nwhich seems, indeed, to be the origin of the singular and nearly\r\nuniversal custom in India of the _sindradan_,[246] consisting of\r\nmarking the forehead of the bride with vermilion. The vermilion has\r\napparently replaced the blood, and the blood may, and doubtless does,\r\nsymbolise a violent rape.\r\n\r\nWith the Mecks and the Kacharis, the bridegroom, accompanied by his\r\nfriends, goes to the house of his future bride; he there meets the\r\nfriends of the latter, and the two troupes simulate a combat, in which\r\nthe future husband is always victor; the bride finishes by being\r\ncarried off, and her husband has only to feast the friends of both\r\nparties, and pay the father the price of the girl.[247]\r\n\r\nWith the Soligas, the man carries away the young girl with her consent,\r\nand goes, like the Mongols, to a neighbouring village to pass the\r\ntime of the honeymoon, after which the couple return home and give a\r\nfeast.[248]\r\n\r\nThe custom of simulated capture still exists among other aboriginal\r\ntribes of India, the Khonds, Badagas, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in primitive humanity, to carry off a woman with\r\narmed violence was considered a glorious exploit, since in the most\r\ndiverse races pacific marriage assumes, with such good will, the\r\npretence of violent conquest.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, in order to marry a girl, a man applied either to her\r\nfather or nearest relation; then, consent being obtained, he ravished\r\nhis future bride, who was bound to resist energetically. As the New\r\nZealand women were robust, the contest, however courteous it might be,\r\nwas severe; the clothes of the girl were generally torn to shreds, and\r\nit sometimes took hours to drag her a hundred yards.[249]\r\n\r\nSometimes the mother of the bride interfered. Mr. Yate mentions a case\r\nof this kind. It relates to a mother quite content with the marriage\r\nof her daughter, but obliged by custom to make a show of violent\r\nopposition. The newly-married couple, on coming out of the church, for\r\nthey were converted, met the old woman, vociferating and tearing her\r\nhair, and abusing the missionary, but telling him at the same time in a\r\nlow voice not to mind, for she was not serious.[250]\r\n\r\nIn certain districts of New Zealand the future husband was obliged\r\nliterally to carry off the girl. When the marriage was negotiated and,\r\nin principle, concluded, all the relatives watched the _fiancée_ with\r\nthe greatest care, and held themselves in readiness to defend her. The\r\nyoung man had to seize his bride at all costs by force of arms; his\r\nhonour depended on it, and often he suffered severely in conducting his\r\nglorious enterprise to a successful end.[251]\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial of capture evidently springs from customs of rape,\r\nwhether ancient or not; it is, therefore, quite natural to meet with\r\nrazzias among the Bedouins, as among all of their race. With the\r\nBedouins of Sinai, the comedy is played to the life. The bridegroom,\r\naccompanied by a couple of friends, attacks the girl when she is\r\nleading the flocks home. She defends herself vigorously by throwing\r\nstones, and is esteemed according to the amount of energy she shows.\r\nAt length they finish by taking her to the tent of her father, where\r\nthe name of her future husband is proclaimed. After this the girl\r\nis dressed as a bride, placed on a camel, all the time feigning\r\nresistance, and conducted to the encampment. A feast and presents\r\nterminate the ceremony.[252]\r\n\r\nWith the Mezeyn Arabs things are pushed further. The girl, in the\r\nso-called capture, evades pursuit and takes refuge in the mountains,\r\nwhere her friends have prepared provisions for her beforehand. The\r\nbridegroom rejoins his future wife in her retreat, and it is there\r\nthat the marriage is consummated. After this the couple return to the\r\npaternal domicile, which the woman, unless she is with child, does not\r\nquit for a year.\r\n\r\nThe matrimonial comedy is not always so complicated. With the Amezas\r\nthe bride only runs from tent to tent, and is at last conducted by\r\nseveral women to a tent prepared at some distance; her bridegroom\r\nawaits her there, but he has to force her to enter it; that done, the\r\nwomen retire.[253]\r\n\r\nWith the Moors of Java, relates Schouten, the father of the bride\r\ncarries her, all swathed up, to the bridegroom. The latter, aided by\r\ntwo of his paranymphs, lifts her on a horse and rides away with her.\r\nOnce arrived at his house he hides his wife there and goes off, without\r\nthanking his assistants and friends.\r\n\r\nMany European races have also practised the ceremonial of marriage\r\nby capture. The Bœotians, says Pausanias, conducted the wives to the\r\nhouse of the husband in a chariot, of which they afterwards solemnly\r\nburnt the pole, to indicate that the woman was henceforth the property\r\nof her master, and was never to think of quitting his abode. But in\r\nancient Greece it was at Sparta especially that the nuptial ceremony of\r\ncapture was practised.[254] A frequently quoted passage from Plutarch’s\r\n_Life of Lycurgus_ gives us details on this point. “In their marriages\r\nthe bridegroom carried off the bride by violence; and she was never\r\nchosen in a tender age, but when she had arrived at full maturity. Then\r\nthe woman that had the direction of the wedding cut the bride’s hair\r\nclose to the skin, dressed her in a man’s clothes, laid her upon a\r\nmattress, and left her in the dark. The bridegroom, neither oppressed\r\nwith wine nor enervated with luxury, but perfectly sober, as having\r\nalways supped at the common table, went in privately, untied her\r\ngirdle, and carried her to another bed. Having stayed there a short\r\ntime, he modestly retired to his usual apartment to sleep with the\r\nother young men, and observed the same conduct afterwards, spending the\r\nday with his companions and reposing himself with them in the night,\r\nnor even visiting his bride but with great caution and apprehensions\r\nof being discovered by the rest of the family; the bride at the same\r\ntime exerted all her art to contrive convenient opportunities for their\r\nprivate meetings,” etc.[255]\r\n\r\nAt Rome the ceremonial of capture was kept up for a long time in the\r\nplebeian marriages, without confarreation or coemption. As in so\r\nmany other countries, they played the comedy of the carrying off\r\nof the bride by the bridegroom with the pretended resistance of the\r\nmother and the relations.[256] In the more respectable marriages the\r\nceremonial of capture was simplified, but still very significant. The\r\nhair of the bride was separated with the point of a javelin (_hasta\r\ncelibaris_),[257] and for this symbolic ceremony a javelin that\r\nhad pierced the body of a gladiator was preferred. Then the bride,\r\nconducted to the house of her husband, was to enter it without touching\r\nthe threshold; she was lifted over it.[258] It is curious to find\r\nthis same custom in China now in our own day, and we can hardly help\r\nrecognising in it the symbolic embodiment of capture.\r\n\r\nA similar ceremonial is always practised in Circassia. In the midst of\r\na feast the bridegroom enters, escorted by his friends, and carries off\r\nhis bride, who henceforth becomes his wife.[259]\r\n\r\nMoreover, as at Sparta, the newly-married Circassian must not visit the\r\nwife, except in secret, for a whole year--a term evidently fixed, as at\r\nSparta, for the period of probable pregnancy.[260]\r\n\r\nIt is not very long ago that a ceremonial of the same kind was observed\r\nquite near us, in Wales. On the day fixed, the bridegroom and his\r\nfriends, all on horseback, came to take the bride; but they found\r\nthemselves in the presence of the friends of the young girl, also on\r\nhorseback, and a mock fight ensued, during which the future wife fled\r\non the crupper of the horse of her nearest relative. But instantly the\r\nsquadron of the bridegroom, counting sometimes two or three hundred\r\nhorse, galloped in pursuit. Finally they rejoined the fugitive, and all\r\nwas terminated by a feast and common rejoicings.[261]\r\n\r\nIn Livonia every marriage was also the occasion of a simulated\r\ncombat of cavalry, as with the Welsh, but it took place before the\r\nmarriage.[262] In Poland also, and in Lithuania and Russia, the seizure\r\nof the girl often preceded marriage.\r\n\r\nI shall here end the enumeration of these customs, which are all\r\nmanifestly symbolical of capture. We still find the trace of it even\r\nin the Brittany of to-day, where the representative of the husband,\r\nthe _bazvalan_, and the parents of the _fiancée_ sing, alternately,\r\nstrophes of a marriage song, in which the one asks and the others\r\nrefuse the bride, offering in her stead either a younger sister, or the\r\nmother or grandmother.[263] Our inquiry is terminated; it remains now\r\nto ask what is the meaning of this ceremonial so widely spread in all\r\nages and in all countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Signification of the Ceremonial of Capture._\r\n\r\nThe author of an interesting book on primitive marriage, Mr. McLennan,\r\nand after him a great number of sociologists, have concluded that in\r\nsavage societies sexual unions or associations have been generally\r\neffected by the violent capture of the woman, that by degrees these\r\ncaptures have become friendly ones, and have at length ended in a\r\npeaceful exogamy, retaining the ancient custom only in the ceremonial\r\nform.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible to have been thus in a certain number of\r\ncountries; but we must beware of seeing in this a necessary and general\r\nevolution. Surely savage hordes and tribes naturally carry off the\r\nwomen and girls of their neighbours and enemies, the little groups\r\nwith whom they are incessantly struggling for existence. They seize\r\ntheir women as they do everything else, and impose on the captives\r\nthe unenviable _rôle_ of slaves-of-all-work. Given the brutality of\r\nprimitive man, the fate of the captured woman is necessarily of the\r\nhardest, and it is natural that the woman of the tribe should not\r\nsolicit it. Thus, with or without reason, the Australian fells to the\r\nground his captured wife, pierces her limbs with his javelin, etc. A\r\nstranger, a prisoner, violently brought into a society where she cannot\r\ncount on a single friend, will evidently be more resigned to this\r\nbad treatment, and can nearly always be made to submit to it without\r\nresistance. But we must not accept this as a sufficient explanation of\r\nexogamy. We have seen that the Australian, accustomed to primitive\r\nrape in all its brutality, only has recourse to it when he cannot\r\nprocure by simple barter the woman he covets.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly great temptation to capture a woman. A man thereby\r\nescapes paying a price for her to her parents, which is the rule in\r\nnearly all savage countries, but the operation is not effected without\r\nrisk and reprisals more or less dangerous, so that before undertaking\r\nit he thinks twice.\r\n\r\nWe must be careful not to confound rape with marriage; nothing is more\r\ndistinct with savage and even with civilised men. Perhaps even the\r\ndangers and the inconveniences of brutal capture have given rise to the\r\nidea of primitive conjugal barter, of a peaceful agreement by which a\r\ngirl was ceded to a man for a compensation agreed upon. In principle\r\nthis commercial transaction left to the husband the greater part of\r\nthe rights he would have acquired by violent capture; but, in reality,\r\nthese rights were necessarily mitigated, for the woman, being thus\r\nceded in a friendly manner, was not completely abandoned by her own\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThus in Polynesia, or at least in New Zealand, the husband who murdered\r\nhis wife, although he had purchased her, incurred the revenge of her\r\nrelations, unless she was guilty of adultery.[264] It was often thus,\r\nbut not always, however; for with the Fijians, in delivering a daughter\r\nto the purchaser, the father or the brother said to the future husband,\r\n“If you become discontented with her, sell her, kill her, eat her; you\r\nare her absolute master.”[265] Much nearer home, in ancient Russia, the\r\nfather at the moment of marriage gave his daughter some strokes with a\r\nwhip, saying, “Henceforth, if you are not obedient, your husband will\r\nbeat you.”[266]\r\n\r\nSuch customs show us plainly why, in so many countries, symbolic\r\npractices recalling violent capture are kept up in the ceremony of\r\nmarriage. In the first place, by reason even of the dangers to which\r\nit exposed the ravisher, rape was considered a brilliant action, and\r\npleasure was felt in simulating it. But besides and beyond all, the\r\nceremonial of capture symbolised also the subjection of the woman\r\nsold or ceded by her parents; it sanctioned the very excessive rights\r\nthat the husband acquired over the wife. As a rule, the ceremonial of\r\ncapture coincides with a very great subjection of the woman, even where\r\nit is only a very distant survival. At Sparta, for example, the wife\r\nmight still be lent by the husband, and it was the same in ancient\r\nRome, where she was, according to the legal expression, _in manu_,\r\nassimilated to slaves, and where the _pater familias_ had the right of\r\nlife and death over her.\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, warranted in believing that in civilised countries\r\nwhere conjugal legislation is still derived from the Roman law, the\r\nsubordinate position assigned to woman is the last vestige of primitive\r\nmarriage by capture or by rape, attenuated to a purchase, as practised\r\nin the earliest times of the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[213] _Daily Life and Origin of the Tasmanians_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[214] Dumont d’Urville, _Hist.

It is indeed the truth that, as far back\r\nas we can carry our historical and ethnographical investigations, we\r\nfind, with very rare exceptions, the subjection of woman is the rule\r\nin all human societies, and that the more backward the civilisation\r\nthe harder was the subjection. Some sociologists have pretended that\r\nmaternal filiation implied for the woman a sort of golden age--a reign\r\nof Amazons--during which the woman, as centre of the family, must have\r\nbeen honoured as its chief. All we know of ethnography gives the lie to\r\nthis hypothesis. In the present day the matriarchate does not anywhere\r\nexist, but maternal kinship does, and we do not find that it involves\r\na milder condition for the woman. This system of filiation necessarily\r\nindicates a gross state of society, in which paternity is still\r\nuncertain. Now, as a rule, the subjection of woman is in inverse ratio\r\nto the development of man. In primitive societies, where might is the\r\nonly right, the woman, on account of her relative weakness, is always\r\ntreated with extreme brutality. It would be difficult, without losing\r\nall human quality whatever, to be less intelligent than the Australian,\r\nand equally difficult to imagine a more cruel servitude than that of\r\nthe Australian woman, always beaten, often wounded, sometimes killed\r\nand eaten, according to the convenience of her owner. The Fijians, much\r\nmore intelligent than the Australians, amused themselves with beating\r\ntheir mother, and with binding their wives to trees in order to whip\r\nthem.[267] A Fijian named Loti, simply to make himself notorious,\r\ndevoured his wife, after having cooked her on a fire that he had forced\r\nher to light herself.[268] No kind of ferocious caprice was condemned\r\nby the morality of the country. But such manners are as far as possible\r\nfrom being consistent with the idea of a matriarchal society, in which\r\na place of honour is accorded to the wife.\r\n\r\nIn primitive societies the condition of children is, if possible, still\r\nmore subordinate than that of woman. Infanticide at the moment of\r\nbirth is not even a venial fault. And later, the parents exercise the\r\nundisputed right of life and death over their progeny; and when slavery\r\nis instituted, the children become a veritable article of merchandise.\r\nIn short, the rights of a father of a family are unlimited.\r\n\r\nFrom this primitive right of property accorded to the parents over\r\ntheir children has resulted quite naturally all over the world the\r\nright of marrying them without consulting them at all. Moreover, as\r\nit had long been the custom to sell them, marriage was naturally\r\nconsidered as a commercial bargain, and by degrees marriage by purchase\r\neven took the place of marriage by capture, but after having long\r\nco-existed with it. Capture and purchase had each their advantages\r\nand disadvantages. Capture cost nothing, and it procured wives and\r\nconcubines over whom the husband had every possible right; but, in\r\npractice, it was not exempt from danger, and once accomplished, it\r\nexposed him still to revenge and retaliation. Men became resigned,\r\ntherefore, to the purchase of the wife, as soon as they could dispose\r\nof some exchange-values; and as nothing, absolutely nothing, was\r\nany obstacle to the caprice or avidity of the parents, the most\r\nunreasonable marriages were often negotiated, and notably the marriages\r\nof children.\r\n\r\nThis custom of selling children, especially girls, for a future\r\nconjugal association is very common all over the world.\r\n\r\nIn New Caledonia the children are betrothed by the parents almost from\r\nthe moment of birth.[269] In Africa, among the black races, and notably\r\nthe Hottentots, whose women age fast, the prudent men retain, years in\r\nadvance, the little girls destined to succeed their actual wives.[270]\r\nIn Ashantee little girls of ten and twelve thus sold are already\r\nlegally considered the wives of the acquirer, although they have not\r\nyet left their mothers, and any familiarity taken with them by another\r\nman is punished by a fine paid to the future owner.[271]\r\n\r\nIn Polynesia, also, the fathers, mothers, and relatives arranged the\r\nconjugal unions of the children years before these unions were actually\r\npossible.[272]\r\n\r\nWith the Moxos and the Chiquitos of South America premature marriages\r\nwere such a settled order of things that there were no celibates above\r\nthe age of fourteen for the men and twelve for the women. The Jesuit\r\nmissionaries in America had completely adopted this native custom,\r\nand they often married young girls of ten to boys of twelve years.\r\nNaturally these child marriages entailed sometimes equally precocious\r\nwidowhood. D’Orbigny states that he has seen among these tribes a\r\nwidower of twelve and a widow of ten years.[273]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Marco Polo the Tartars of Asia celebrated marriages\r\nthat were more singular still--the marriages of deceased children. The\r\nfamilies drew up the contract as if their children had been living,\r\nsolemnly celebrated a symbolic wedding, then burned not less solemnly\r\nthe fictitious contract, which would be, they thought, the means of\r\nholding it good in the other world for the vanished young couple.\r\nThenceforward an alliance existed between the contracting families as\r\nif the marriage had been real.[274]\r\n\r\nAmong the Reddies of India a young woman from sixteen to twenty years\r\nold is frequently married to a little boy of five or six. The wife\r\nthen goes to live either with the father, or with an uncle, or a\r\nmaternal cousin of her future husband. The children resulting from\r\nthese extra-conjugal unions are attributed to the boy, who is reputed\r\nto be the legal husband. When once this boy has reached manhood his\r\nlegitimate wife is old, and then he in his turn unites himself to the\r\nwife of another boy, for whom he also raises up pseudo-legitimate\r\nchildren.[275]\r\n\r\nChild-marriages, at least of little girls, are still very common in\r\nIndia amongst the Brahmins, and it is not unusual to see sexagenarian\r\nBrahmins marry little girls of six or seven years, for whom they pay\r\nmoney.[276]\r\n\r\nOn this point, as on most others, our European ancestors have not been\r\nmore delicate than the savage or barbarous races of other countries.\r\nThus Plutarch tells us that in ancient Italy the girls were often\r\nmarried before the age of twelve years, but that they did not become\r\nwives before that age.[277]\r\n\r\nAt the present day the Russian peasants still frequently act like the\r\nReddies of India, and it is not rare to see, under the _Mir_ system,\r\nyoung boys of eight or ten years married to women of twenty-five or\r\nthirty. Very often, in this case, the chief of the family becomes the\r\neffective husband of the woman while the legal husband is growing\r\nup.[278]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Marriage by Servitude._\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts we may evidently conclude that in societies of\r\nlittle or no cultivation the children are left absolutely to the\r\ndiscretion of the parents. The latter, having every possible right over\r\ntheir progeny, consider them as a property, and think it no crime to\r\nsell their daughters, pubescent or not, as soon as they constitute a\r\nnegotiable value. This sale of daughters is even the most widely spread\r\nform of primitive marriage, or of what it is convenient to call so. In\r\nsocieties of some degree of civilisation, where exchange-values exist,\r\nas domestic animals, stores of provisions, or slaves, the sale of a\r\ndaughter is argued and debated like any other transaction, and the\r\nmerchandise is delivered for the price agreed on. In a more primitive\r\nstate of civilisation, when man subsists chiefly by the chase, or\r\nfishing from day to day, and is not always rich enough to buy a wife,\r\nthe exchange-values considered equivalent of the required daughter are\r\noften replaced by a certain amount of labour or services rendered to\r\nthe parents, and hence results a special form of marriage--marriage by\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nThis mode of marriage was not uncommon with the Indians of North\r\nAmerica. Sometimes the future husband engaged to serve the parents of\r\nthe girl for a fixed period of time. He hunted for them, hollowed out\r\nor constructed canoes, or where agriculture was practised he cultivated\r\nthe land.[279] Sometimes the husband was not entirely enslaved; he had\r\nonly to give to his wife’s parents a part of the produce of the chase,\r\nand he was not exempt from this tribute till a daughter was born to\r\nhim, who became, by way of indemnity, the property of the maternal\r\nuncle of his wife.[280]\r\n\r\nOften during the time of his voluntary servitude the husband remained\r\nin the family of his wife, and he actually took the position there of a\r\nsort of slave.[281]\r\n\r\nIn the more civilised societies of Central America the custom of\r\nmarriage by servitude was nevertheless preserved. Among the Kenaï, the\r\nfuture husband went every morning for a whole year to the house of the\r\nparents of his betrothed to prepare the food, carry the water, or heat\r\nthe bath-chamber; then, when his year of service was over, he took away\r\nthe daughter.[282] In Yucatan the son-in-law was obliged to serve his\r\nfather-in-law for two or three years. This manner of acting even became\r\na general custom which it was considered immoral not to follow.[283]\r\nWith the Mayas, the bridegroom was required to build himself a house\r\nopposite that of his future father-in-law, and he lived there five or\r\nsix years, giving his labour during all that period.[284]\r\n\r\nAlthough more common in America than elsewhere, the custom of marriage\r\nby servitude is not confined to that continent. The Limboos and the\r\nKirantis of Bengal often buy their wives by giving a certain term of\r\nlabour to the father, in whose house they remain until the payment is\r\nfinished.[285] We know also that marriage by servitude is not peculiar\r\nto savages of inferior races, since the Bible informs us that Jacob\r\nonly espoused Leah and Rachel at the price of fourteen years’ service.\r\nWithout dilating further on marriage by servitude, I shall remark by\r\nthe way that it had for its result the placing of the husband in a\r\nsubordinate position towards the woman, or at least towards the family\r\nof the woman, in which he had so long been treated as a servant. A\r\ncertain independence was gained by the wife who had been acquired in\r\nthis manner. Thus, with the Kenaï, of whom I was speaking just now, the\r\nwoman had the right to return to her father if she was not well treated\r\nby her husband.[286] Marriage by servitude had therefore, in fact,\r\na moral side; it lessened the subjection, always hard and sometimes\r\ncruel, to which woman is liable in nearly all savage or barbarous\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Marriage by Purchase._\r\n\r\nMarriage by purchase is much more widely spread than marriage by\r\nservitude or service. All over the world, in all races and in all\r\ntimes, wherever history can inform us, we find well-authenticated\r\nexamples permitting us to affirm that during the middle age of\r\ncivilisation the right of parents over children, and especially\r\nover daughters, included in all countries the power to sell them. I\r\npurpose to consult on this subject all the great races of mankind, and\r\nconfirmatory facts will not be wanting; I shall, indeed, have to limit\r\nmyself in giving them.\r\n\r\nAmong the Hottentots and the Kaffirs, the exchange value of the country\r\nbeing cattle, the daughters are paid for in cows or oxen, and the price\r\nof the merchandise varies according to the fluctuations of demand and\r\nsupply. Among the Great Namaquois Levaillant saw a conjugal affair\r\nconcluded very cheaply, for a single cow;[287] but this price may be\r\nincreased tenfold.[288] With the Corannas, the man makes his request\r\nleading an ox to the door of the girl. If he is allowed to kill the\r\nanimal, it means that his demand is granted. In the contrary case, the\r\nsuitor is sent away and sometimes stoned.[289] Hottentot girls are\r\nsometimes sold in their own tribe, and sometimes in a neighbouring one.\r\nAt the time of Burchell’s travels there was a lively traffic in girls\r\nbetween the Bachapin Hottentots and the Kora Hottentots.[290]\r\n\r\nAccording to Livingstone, among the Makalolo Kaffirs the price paid\r\nto the father had also for its object the redemption of the right of\r\nownership which he would otherwise have in the children of his daughter.\r\n\r\nIn Central Africa, in Senegambia, in the valley of the Niger, with the\r\nMandingoes, the Peuls, etc., marriages are reduced to the sale of the\r\ngirl by those having the right.[291] With the Timannis, says Laing,\r\nthe pretendant first brings a jar of palm wine, or a little rum, to\r\nthe parents. If his demand is favourably received the presents are\r\naccepted, and the giver is invited to return, which he does, bringing\r\na second jar of wine, some kolas, some measures of stuff, and some\r\nchaplets. All is then definitely concluded, and they announce to the\r\ngirl that she is married.[292]\r\n\r\nWith the Moors of Senegambia conjugal sales are effected in nearly the\r\nsame manner; however, the girl has a right to refuse, but on condition\r\nof renouncing marriage for ever, on pain of becoming the slave of her\r\nfirst suitor in the case of an attempt to marry her to another.[293]\r\nThis right of refusal, limited as it is, already constitutes a notable\r\ndegree of progress which does not always exist in much more civilised\r\ncountries. We must place by the side of this some other customs in\r\nforce here and there in this region of Central Africa, confining\r\nourselves to the Sahara and to where the population is strongly mixed\r\nwith Berber blood. It is to be remembered that in nearly all Berber\r\ncountries the subjection of women is or has been a little less severe.\r\n\r\nAt Sackatoo the daughter is generally consulted by her parents as a\r\nmatter of form only, for she never refuses. In the same district the\r\nyoung people first obtain a mutual consent, and then that of their\r\nparents. Among rich people the husband settles on his future wife a\r\ndowry consisting of female slaves, sculptured calabashes filled with\r\nmillet, dourra, and rice, of cloth, bracelets, toilet articles, of\r\nstones for grinding the grain, mortars for pounding it, etc. All these\r\npresents are borne in great pomp, on the heads of female slaves, to the\r\nhusband’s house when the wife enters it for the first time.\r\n\r\nAt Kouranko the young girls are often sold by their parents as\r\ndearly as possible to rich old men. They are forced to submit, but,\r\nonce widows, they resume their liberty and recoup themselves by\r\nchoosing at will a young husband, on whom they lavish their care\r\nand attentions.[294] Now we shall find that in many civilisations\r\nrelatively advanced, widowhood even does not gratify the woman with a\r\nliberty of which she is never thought worthy.\r\n\r\nAt Wowow and at Boussa the emancipation of woman is markedly greater.\r\nIt is no longer the father, it is the grandmother who gives or refuses\r\nher grand-daughter, and if the grandmother is dead, the girl is free\r\nto act as she likes.[295] This fact, if correct, is infinitely more\r\ncurious than all the others, and it ought to rejoice the sociologists\r\nfull of faith, who admit in a distant antiquity the existence of a\r\nmatriarchal _régime_ assigning to woman the chief place in the family.\r\nBut let us continue our inquiry.\r\n\r\nIn Polynesia marriage by purchase was habitual. In New Zealand the man\r\nbought the girl, and offered presents to her parents.[296]\r\n\r\nGenerally in Polynesia the suitor offered pigs, stuffs, etc. If his\r\ndemand was granted, the bargain was quickly concluded; the girl was\r\nthere and then delivered to the husband; a Polynesian bed was arranged\r\nin the house of the bride’s father, and the newly-married couple passed\r\nthe night there. The next day a feast was celebrated, to which friends\r\nwere invited, and which consisted of several pigs.[297]\r\n\r\nAt Tahiti temporary marriages were also concluded, and in this case the\r\npresents of pigs, stuffs, pigeons, etc., varied in amount according to\r\nthe length of the union.[298]\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of the sale, the Polynesian father always retained over\r\nhis daughter the prior right of ownership, and when the presents seemed\r\nto him to be insufficient, he took back the merchandise to let or sell\r\nit to a more generous lover. If a child was born, the husband was free\r\nto kill the infant, which was done by applying a piece of wet stuff\r\nto the mouth and nose, or to let it live, but in the latter case he\r\ngenerally kept the wife for the whole of her life. If the union was\r\nsterile, or the children put to death, the man had always the right to\r\nabandon the woman when and how it seemed good to him.[299] She was a\r\nslave that he had bought, and that he could get rid of at will.[300]\r\n\r\nOn the great American continent, from north to south the custom of\r\nthe sale of the daughter is common to a great number of peoples. With\r\nthe Redskins female merchandise is generally paid for in horses and\r\nblankets. When the daughter had been sold to a white man and then\r\nabandoned, as frequently happened, the parents resumed possession of\r\nher, and sold her a second time.\r\n\r\nIn Columbia what was most prized was the aptitude of the woman for\r\nlabour, and her qualities as a beast of burden were worth to her\r\nparents a greater or less number of horses.[301]\r\n\r\nAmong the Redskins of northern California the girls were bought and\r\nsold like any other articles, and there was no thought of consulting\r\nthem in the matter. The price was paid to the father, and the girl was\r\nled off simply as if it were a horse-sale. Poor suitors naturally had\r\nto give way to rich ones, and hence all the opulent old men obtained\r\nall the beautiful young women.[302] There was no nuptial ceremony.\r\nHowever, with the Modocs, the conclusion of the business is marked by a\r\nfeast, but the newly-married couple take no part in it.\r\n\r\nThe Redskin parents do not always entirely abandon their married\r\ndaughter, and if she is too ill-treated by her owner, they have the\r\nright to take her back, and then of course to sell her to some one\r\nelse.[303] Socialist customs sometimes co-exist with these gross\r\nconjugal ones. The nuptial abode is often prepared by the tribe, or,\r\nas in Columbia, the friends join in paying to the father the price of\r\nthe daughter.[304] The Californian suitors sometimes obtain a wife on\r\ncredit; but then the man is called “half-married,” and is forced to\r\nlive as a slave with the parents of the girl until he has concluded\r\nthe payment, for there is no essential difference between marriage by\r\nservitude and marriage by purchase. In America, as elsewhere, morality\r\nis simply the expression of habits and needs, and thus the purchase\r\nof the wife has ended by becoming an honourable thing; and among the\r\nCalifornian Redskins the children of a wife who has cost nothing to her\r\nhusband are looked down on.[305]\r\n\r\nThe Papayos of New Mexico are not content with selling their daughters\r\nby private contract; they put them up to auction.[306] As for the\r\ninhabitants of those curious Neo-Mexican phalansteries called\r\n_pueblos_, as they are much more advanced than the greater part of\r\ntheir American congeners, their matrimonial customs are less gross;\r\nand the suitor, when accepted by the parents, tries to charm his\r\nbride by daily serenades lasting for hours--a rare thing in savage\r\ncountries.[307]\r\n\r\nWith the half-civilised tribes of Guatemala and Nicaragua conjugal\r\nunions were also determined according to the presents made to the\r\nparents, and in Guatemala the young people were both kept in ignorance\r\nof the affair until the last moment.[308] In Nicaragua, however, there\r\nexisted a curious exception in certain towns, where at a particular\r\nfestival the young girls had the right to choose their husbands freely\r\nfrom among the young men present.[309]\r\n\r\nWith the Moxos and the Guaranis the price paid to the parents is still\r\nthe decisive reason of the marriage.[310] However, the Guaranis also\r\nexact from the husband proofs of virile qualities in the chase and in\r\nwar.[311] The struggle for existence is still severe, and in order\r\nto keep one or more wives a man must be able not only to feed but to\r\ndefend them.\r\n\r\nThe Mongols of Asia buy their wives exactly like the Mongoloids of\r\nAmerica, of whom I have just spoken.\r\n\r\nAmong the nomad Mongols, the Tartars of northern Asia, the parents\r\narrange the marriages with absolute authority, and without consulting\r\nthe parties more especially interested. The bargain is sharply debated\r\nbetween the parents, and the price to be paid by the husband or his\r\nfamily is very precisely settled; the future couple are not even\r\ninformed of it, their sentiments, their desires, or dislikes, are not\r\nconsidered in the least. The price of the girl is paid in cattle,\r\nsheep, oxen, or horses; in pieces of stuff, in brandy, in butter, in\r\nflour, etc. Everything being agreed on, the contract of sale is drawn\r\nup before witnesses, but the girl is only delivered to the purchaser\r\nafter the ceremony of marriage, which, as we have previously seen,\r\ntakes the form of capture.[312]\r\n\r\nThe Turcomans have customs very similar to those of the Tartars.\r\nWith them the price of the girl is chiefly reckoned in camels, and\r\nit generally takes five to pay for a girl; but as in their eyes the\r\nwoman is not an object of luxury, as she not only has to manage the\r\nhousekeeping but to manufacture articles which have an exchange\r\nvalue, and which are profitable to the family, experienced women and\r\nwidows, provided they are passable, are much more sought for in the\r\nconjugal market than young girls. It is no longer five camels, but\r\nfifty, or even a hundred, that must be paid for a widow still in good\r\ncondition.[313] If the suitor cannot immediately get together the price\r\nof the woman he covets, he has recourse to marriage by capture, and\r\ntakes refuge with his bride in a neighbouring camp.\r\n\r\nA settlement is always effected, matters are compounded, and the\r\nravisher engages to pay a certain number of camels and horses, which\r\nhe generally procures by marauding on the frontiers of Persia. It is\r\na veritable debt of honour for him, and he must pay it with the least\r\npossible delay.[314]\r\n\r\nThese barbarous customs of Mongolia are naturally softened in China,\r\nbut without any essential change in their main features. There, as well\r\nas in Tartary, the young girl is considered as the property of her\r\nparents, and her training is so perfect that she has not the slightest\r\ndesire to be consulted before being married, or rather sold, for ready\r\nmoney.[315] In the Chinese family, daughters count for so little value\r\nthat they are only called by ordinal numbers--first-born, second-born,\r\netc.--to which is added a surname.[316] The price of the daughter when\r\npurchased is paid to the parents in two separate portions--the first on\r\nthe conclusion of the agreement and the signing of the contract, and\r\nthe other on the wedding-day.[317] Marriage by capture has naturally\r\ngone out of use in the old civilisation of China, but the trace of it\r\nstill remains in the ceremonial, for the bride is lifted over the\r\nthreshold of the conjugal dwelling, as was the custom in ancient Rome.\r\n\r\nIt has appeared so natural to parents all over the world to dispose of\r\ntheir daughters as they chose, that many of the aborigines of India\r\ndo nearly the same as the Mongols. The daughters are sold by the\r\nparents among the Kolhans, the Bendkars, the Limboos, the Kirantis, the\r\nMoundas, the Santals, the Oraons, the Muasis, the Birhors, the Hos, the\r\nBoyars, the Nagas, the Gonds, etc.[318] The price of the girl varies\r\nfrom three to fourteen rupees, or is reckoned in head of cattle or\r\nmeasures of rice. Sometimes female merchandise is rare and dear, for in\r\nsome countries female infanticide has long prevailed; it may happen,\r\ntoo, that daughters are condemned to celibacy, as with the Hos,[319]\r\nor, as with the Nagas, that marriages are delayed, and that the\r\nbridegroom must often submit to marriage by servitude.[320] Sometimes,\r\nagain, the girls are carried off, as happens among the Kolhans, by the\r\nimpatient bridegrooms, and, after the rape, arbitrators negotiate a\r\nsettlement.[321] It should be remarked, by the way, that with the Nagas\r\nmarriage by servitude has its ordinary effect, that of abasing the\r\nhusband and raising the wife; and, in fact, among these races, although\r\nthe wife performs severe labour, she is treated as the equal of her\r\nhusband.[322]\r\n\r\nIn some aboriginal tribes of India we even find matriarchal customs.\r\nThus with the Pani-Koechs the husbands leave to their very industrious\r\nwives the care of their property. In marrying, a man goes to live with\r\nhis mother-in-law, and obeys her as well as his wife. Moreover, in this\r\ntribe the mothers negotiate the marriages; the fathers have nothing to\r\ndo with them.[323]\r\n\r\nAmong the Yerkalas the maternal uncle has the right to claim for his\r\nsons the two eldest daughters of his sister, or to renounce them for an\r\nindemnity of eight images of idols.[324]\r\n\r\nMoney, always money! With all peoples and races marriage is often\r\nreduced to a pecuniary question. In this respect the Berbers, the\r\nSemites, and the Aryans are not distinguished from other human types.\r\nWith certain Touaregs of the Sahara, says Duveyrier, it is the daughter\r\nherself who indemnifies the father, and it is after the old Italian\r\nmanner, _more tusco_, that she gains the price of enfranchisement\r\nwhich is necessary for her marriage. “The father, before the marriage\r\nof his daughter, exacts from her the reimbursement, levied on her\r\nbody, of what she has cost her family ... and the girl, dishonoured\r\naccording to our ideas, but ransomed according to local ideas, is all\r\nthe more sought after, the greater her success in the commerce of her\r\nattractions.”[325]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the Touaregs, the Semites, Hebrews, and Arabs, attached\r\nand still attach an enormous value to the virginity of the bride;\r\nbut marriage was not and is not any the less for them a simple sale.\r\nThe history of Jacob’s marriage has already shown us that marriage\r\nby servitude was practised by the ancient Hebrews. In later times\r\nthe consent of the woman became necessary, which is a great step in\r\nadvance, but the husband none the less bought his wife in some way or\r\nother.[326]\r\n\r\nWith contemporary Arabs marriage is a simple sale, without any\r\ndisguise. An Arab jurist gives us the formula of it, which is very\r\nclear. It is as follows: “I sell you my daughter for such a sum.” “I\r\naccept.” The same author says elsewhere: “The woman sells in marriage\r\na part of her person. In a purchase men buy an article of merchandise;\r\nin a marriage they buy the field of procreation.”[327] It would be\r\nimpossible to speak more plainly. Nevertheless, the consent of the\r\nwoman is necessary; it is she who is supposed to sell herself, and the\r\nprice of the bargain constitutes her dowry. It was the same with the\r\nHebrews.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been their religion, the greater number of the Aryan\r\npeoples have also considered marriage as a commercial transaction.\r\nThe Afghan Mussulmans buy their wives, and these are regarded as a\r\nproperty, so much so that in case of widowhood they cannot re-marry,\r\nunless the second husband indemnifies the family of the first.[328]\r\n\r\nIn Brahmanic India the daughter is also bought from the parents. A\r\ncurious verse of the Code of Manu tells us how the purchaser was\r\nindemnified in the case of substitution of another person: “If, after\r\nhaving shown a suitor a young girl, whose hand is granted to him,\r\nanother is given him to wife, and secretly brought to him, he becomes\r\nthe husband of both for the same price; such is the decision of\r\nManu.”[329] Things have not much changed at present. “When they wish to\r\nsignify that they are going to be married,” says an editor of _Lettres\r\nédifiantes_, in speaking of the Hindoos, “they generally say that they\r\nare going to buy a wife.” However, the parents do not appropriate\r\nthe entire sum paid by the purchaser; a great part of it goes to buy\r\njewels for the bride.[330] The ancient Malays of Sumatra had solved the\r\nconjugal problem in three different ways. Sometimes the man bought and\r\nled away the woman, according to the universal custom; sometimes the\r\nwoman bought the man, who then came to live with her family; sometimes\r\nthe two were married on a footing of equality.[331] We must note in\r\npassing that this last matrimonial form is very exceptional.\r\n\r\nThroughout Europe, as well in Greco-Latin antiquity as among\r\nbarbarians, the young girl has formerly been considered as a negotiable\r\nproperty, and marriage as a sale.\r\n\r\nThe Sagas tell us that the Scandinavian fathers married their daughters\r\nwithout consulting them--after the manner of savages--and received an\r\nindemnity from the son-in-law.[332]\r\n\r\nWith the Germans the daughter could not marry without the authorisation\r\nof her father or of her nearest relative, who first received the\r\nearnest money from the bridegroom;[333] as for the bride, she received\r\nthe _oscle_, or price of the first kiss, and then the _morgengabe_,\r\nwhich constituted her dowry. In return, the German widow, like the\r\nAfghan widow, was the property of the parents of her husband, and could\r\nnot re-marry without their authorisation.[334]\r\n\r\nIn primitive Greece the daughter was purchased either by presents\r\nto the father or by services rendered to him.[335] The father could\r\nmarry his daughter as he thought well, and in default of a son could\r\nleave her by will, with the heritage of which she formed a part, to a\r\nstranger.[336]\r\n\r\nAt Rome also the daughter was the property of her father, and until\r\nthe time of Antoninus the father had the right to re-marry her when\r\nthe husband had been absent three years.[337] Marriage by purchase had\r\ncertainly been the primitive form of the conjugal contract. In reality\r\nthe _confarreatio_, a solemn and religious union in the presence of ten\r\nwitnesses, was a patrician marriage. The _usus_, or the consecration\r\nof a free union after a year of cohabitation, strongly resembles the\r\nPolynesian marriage. But the most common conjugal form, the one which\r\nsucceeded the _usus_, and surely preceded the _confarreatio_, was\r\nmarriage by purchase, the _coemptio_.\r\n\r\nCoemption ended in time by becoming purely symbolic; the wife was\r\ndelivered to the husband, who, as a formality, gave her a few pieces\r\nof money; but the ceremony is none the less eloquent, and it proves\r\nclearly that in principle the woman had been, at Rome as elsewhere,\r\nassimilated by the parents to a thing, to a venal property. When at\r\nAthens and at Rome an effort was made to give the married woman a\r\nless subordinate position, nothing more was done than opposing money\r\nto money by inventing the dowry marriage; and hence resulted other\r\ninconveniences, on which Latin writers have largely dilated, and which\r\nwe can easily study to-day from life. But for the present I must not\r\nspeak of them. It suffices to have proved that all over the earth, in\r\nall times and among all races, marriage by purchase has been widely\r\npractised.\r\n\r\nNow, the custom of marriage by purchase has a very clear and very\r\nimportant signification from a moral and social point of view. It\r\nimplies a profound contempt for woman, and her complete assimilation\r\nto chattels, to cattle, and to things in general. On this point the\r\nRoman law leaves no room for ambiguity, since it makes no essential\r\ndifference between the marital law and the law of property. In regard\r\nto the woman, as in regard to goods, possession or use, continued\r\nfor a year, gave a right of ownership. When applied to things, this\r\npossession is called _usucapion_; applied to the woman, it is called\r\n_usus_.[338] The difference between the terms is slight; between the\r\nfacts there is none. In reality the wife and the child, especially\r\nthe female child, have been the first property possessed by man,\r\nwhich has even implanted in the savage mind the taste for possession,\r\nand the pretension to use and abuse the things left entirely to his\r\nmercy. At Rome this became by the _jus quiritium_, for the woman the\r\n_manus_ of the husband, and for property the _jus utendi et abutendi_\r\nof the proprietor. But this abuse, and this use, nearly always equally\r\nan abuse also, have contributed not a little to deprave man and to\r\nrender him, from the origin of societies until our own day, refractory\r\nto ideas of equity and justice, especially in what relates to the\r\ncondition of woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[267] Williams, _Fiji and the Fijians_, vol. i. p. 156.\r\n\r\n[268] Pritchard, _Polynesian Reminiscences_, etc., p. 371.\r\n\r\n[269] De Rochas, _Nouv.

Now, man is surely the\r\nmost sociable of animals, therefore he is much inclined to polygamy,\r\nlike the great anthropoid apes, with whom our primitive ancestors must\r\nhave had more than one analogy. We have already spoken of the causes\r\nwhich in human societies of the earliest ages disturbed the normal\r\nrelation of the sexes, or the approximate equilibrium between the\r\nnumber of men and that of women. We have seen how savage life rapidly\r\nuses up the men to such a degree that often, in spite of the custom\r\nof female infanticide, there is still an excess of women sufficient\r\nto impose polygamy. Although primitive morality may not think in the\r\nleast of blaming the plurality of wives, it yet happens that this\r\npolygamy, to which all men aspire in a savage country, is spontaneously\r\nrestricted; and, as with chimpanzees, and for the same reasons, it\r\nbecomes, in fact, the privilege of a small number of the strongest and\r\nthe most feared, the chiefs, the sorcerers, or the priests, when there\r\nare any.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, for example, the adult men take possession of the women\r\nof all ages, and in consequence the greater number of young men cannot\r\nbecome proprietors of a woman before the age of about thirty years.[339]\r\n\r\nEnforced celibacy is, besides, softened by the complaisance of the\r\nmen already provided for, the husbands, if we may so call them, who\r\nare generous to the other men, and much more jealous of their rights\r\nof property than of their conjugal rights. It is easy to have an\r\nunderstanding with them, and, with the aid of a suitable present, to\r\ninduce them to lend their wives. In New Caledonia the chiefs and rich\r\nmen only can indulge in the luxury of polygamy, and in this archipelago\r\nthe plurality of wives has already the character that it nearly always\r\nassumes in a primitive country. If the New Caledonians ardently\r\ndesire to have several wives it is not generally with a sensual aim,\r\nfor among the Canaks the genetic appetite is little developed; their\r\nreasons are of quite another kind. Neither slavery nor domesticity\r\nyet exist in New Caledonia. However, agriculture is already practised\r\nthere, and this requires hard labour, from which the men, especially\r\nthe chief men, like to exonerate themselves. Now, it is polygamy that\r\nfurnishes the Canaks with servile labour, which they cannot do without;\r\nit exactly replaces slavery. Therefore, every man, of however little\r\nimportance he may be, procures a number of women in proportion to the\r\nextent of the land he has in cultivation, and also to the figure he\r\nmust make in the world. We shall find this servile polygamy in many\r\nother countries, notably among the Fijians, who resemble the New\r\nCaledonians, but at Fiji polygamy had already evolved and become\r\ncomplicated. It was accompanied by concubinage. As we shall see later,\r\nthis is generally the case. Nowhere do we find men passing abruptly\r\nfrom polygamy to monogamy, and long before arriving at the latter, when\r\nfirst custom and then law restrains and regulates the loose polygamy\r\nof the earlier ages, the change is only at first effected in the form;\r\na man has a small number of wives, who, with their children, enjoy\r\ncertain privileges, but by the side of these titular wives he possesses\r\nconcubines in greater or less number. In this manner everything is\r\nreconciled--morality with sensuality, and the family with the interests\r\nof property.\r\n\r\nThis _régime_ was already in force among the Melanesians of the Fiji\r\nIsles, where the chiefs, living in great state, acquired in one way\r\nor another three or four hundred women, of whom the greater number\r\nfilled only the position of servants to the master, and at the same\r\ntime of concubines, who were at the disposition of the warriors or of\r\nthe guests. The wives whose children inherited were very few in number.\r\nThey were daughters of chiefs, and their situation, although less\r\ndegraded than that of the concubines, was still very humble. Not only\r\ndid they resign themselves without difficulty to polygamy, but they\r\nwere subjected to a singular duty--that of rearing for their husband\r\na chosen concubine. The fact is curious, and worth the trouble of\r\nnarrating. “The bride takes with her a young girl who is still a child,\r\nbut who promises to be beautiful, and who has been carefully selected\r\nfrom the lower class of the people. It is a virgin destined for her\r\nhusband. She brings her up with the tenderest solicitude, and when the\r\ngirl is marriageable, the queen, on an appointed day, undresses her,\r\nwashes her carefully, and even pours perfumed oil on her hair, crowns\r\nher with flowers, conducts her thus naked to her husband, presents her\r\nto him, and retires in silence.”[340] Excessive as it seems to us, this\r\nabsolute resignation is quite natural among savages.\r\n\r\nIn primitive countries the married woman--that is to say, the woman\r\nbelonging to a man--has herself the conscience of being a thing, a\r\nproperty (it is proved to her often and severely enough), but she does\r\nnot think of retaliating, especially in what concerns the conjugal\r\nrelations. Moreover, as her condition is oftenest that of a slave\r\nover-burdened with work, not only does she not resent the introduction\r\nof other women in the house of the master, but she desires it, for\r\nthe work will be so much the less for herself. Thus among the Zulus\r\nthe wife first purchased strives and works with ardour in the hope of\r\nfurnishing her husband with means to acquire a second wife--a companion\r\nin misery over whom, by right of seniority, she will have the upper\r\nhand.[341]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this the greater number of the men in Kaffirland\r\nhave two or three wives, and hence a certain scarcity of feminine\r\nmerchandise in the country; the young men have difficulty in providing\r\nfor themselves, and many girls are sold from infancy.[342] The same\r\ncustoms prevail with the Hottentots; and both Kaffirs and Hottentots\r\nesteem the monogamic preaching of the Christian missionaries as very\r\nimpertinent, and on this point both men and women are agreed.[343]\r\n\r\nAlong the whole course of the Zambesi, says Livingstone, the number of\r\nwives are the measure of a man’s riches, and the women are the first to\r\nfind this quite natural.\r\n\r\nIt is important to observe that in savage societies the woman could not\r\nlive independently; for her, celibacy is synonymous with desertion, and\r\ndesertion would mean a speedy death. This is even the reason of the\r\nlevirate, of which I shall have to speak later.\r\n\r\nAs for all the negroes of Africa, whatever the degree of their\r\ncivilisation or savagery, they have not even a suspicion of the\r\nmonogamic _régime_. But, in Africa also, sensuality is only one of the\r\nsecondary causes of the plurality of wives so strongly desired by all\r\nthe blacks. Their polygamy is chiefly founded on economic motives. At\r\nthe Gaboon,[344] says Du Chaillu, the supreme ambition of a man is to\r\npossess a great number of wives. Nothing is of more value to him, for\r\nthey cultivate the ground, and their strict duty is to serve him and\r\nfurnish him with food. The wife is always purchased from her father\r\nat a price agreed on, and often from her earliest infancy. In this\r\ncase she is placed under the care of the husband’s chief wife. The\r\nhusband-proprietor does not interfere at all with the agricultural\r\nlabour executed by the wives; he only requires them to supply him with\r\nfood. If he has bought them, it is merely as a profitable investment.\r\nHe consequently treats them as slaves, or as domestic animals, and\r\nhas no scruple in lashing them with a whip for nothing at all, and\r\nthus causing ineffaceable scars. “I have seen very few women,” says Du\r\nChaillu, “who had not traces of this kind on their bodies.”\r\n\r\nThe whip which serves for these conjugal corrections has a double\r\nthong, made of hippopotamus or sea-cow hide. “You should hear,” says\r\nthe traveller, “the worthy husband cry out--‘Ah, wretch! do you think\r\nI have bought you for nothing?’”[345] The Gaboon tribes, of whom Du\r\nChaillu speaks, are reckoned the least civilised of negroes; but even\r\namong the least gross of African races the conjugal _régime_ and the\r\ndegree of subjection imposed on women are scarcely lessened.\r\n\r\nAt Tchaki, and at Badagry, etc., when Clapperton spoke of English\r\nmonogamy to the natives, all his auditors, without distinction of\r\nsex, burst into a laugh,[346] so absurd did the thing appear to them.\r\nThroughout Africa the number of a man’s wives is only limited by his\r\nresources. If, as Schweinfurth tells us, among the Bongos of the upper\r\nNile, a man rarely has more than three wives, it is simply on account\r\nof the strict law of supply and demand; for a woman costs no less than\r\nten iron plates, each weighing about two pounds, to which must be\r\nadded twenty iron spear heads, all precious articles and not easily\r\nprocured.[347] At Bornou also men in easy circumstances have seldom\r\nmore than three wives; and the poor have to content themselves, whether\r\nthey will or not, with monogamy.[348] But among the negroes of Kaarta\r\nand the Fantis of the coast of Guinea polygamy is excessive. In Kaarta\r\na private individual often has ten wives and as many concubines;\r\nbut princes or knights often have threefold or even tenfold that\r\nnumber.[349] In consequence of this, about a third of the inhabitants\r\nare of princely or royal blood. As for the Fantis, polygamy is a source\r\nof riches, not only through the labour of the women, but also through\r\nthe sale of the children, of whom a large and profitable trade is\r\nmade.[350] This trait of morals is not in the least peculiar to them;\r\nthroughout black Africa the right of the father of a family includes\r\nthat of selling the children, and he exercises it without scruple.\r\n\r\nNaturally the last sentiments we may expect to find in African\r\nhouseholds are those of delicacy or moral nobility. Humble to servility\r\nin presence of the master, the women give the rein to their shameless\r\nexcesses as soon as they can do it without danger.\r\n\r\nIn Bornou a wife never approaches her husband without kneeling.[351]\r\nWhen a Poul orders one of his wives to prepare his supper, which\r\nimplies that the master desires her company for the night, this signal\r\nfavour is received with transports of joy. The chosen wife hastens to\r\nobey, and when the repast is ready she proudly goes to seek the master,\r\nthus humiliating her female colleagues, who retreat in confusion to\r\ntheir cabins to await their turn.[352] But all this abject behaviour\r\nis merely by compulsion, and the women recoup themselves well for it\r\nwhenever they have the chance.\r\n\r\nThe poor women of the Gaboon, who are lacerated by whips for no\r\noffence, do not understand chastity, and their intrigues constantly\r\nprovoke conflicts and _palavers_ between the men of the villages.[353]\r\nThe obscenity of the Monboottoo women astonished Schweinfurth, well\r\nacquainted as he was with negro customs.[354] The Bambarra women easily\r\nforget conjugal fidelity for a bead necklace, a fine waist-cloth, etc.;\r\nand, as in so many other countries, the husband-proprietors have no\r\nscruple in hiring out their wives for a sufficient price.[355]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, unauthorised adultery is cruelly punished throughout\r\nAfrica; but fear is powerless to ensure to the negro husbands the\r\npurely commercial fidelity they exact from their wives, and therefore,\r\nin order to correct feminine morals, they have recourse in certain\r\nparts to fantastic methods--to the _Mumbo Jumbo_ which Mungo Park\r\ndescribes.[356] Strangely attired and unrecognisable, a singular\r\npersonage, doubtless a sorcerer, appears in the evening after being\r\ncalled for by frightful howlings in the woods, and first goes to the\r\nspot where the inhabitants are accustomed to assemble to talk at their\r\nease. This coming is the signal for songs and dances, which last into\r\nthe middle of the night. Then the _Mumbo Jumbo_ designates the guilty\r\nor indocile woman. The latter is immediately seized, stripped, bound\r\nto a stake, and vigorously beaten by the _Mumbo_ himself, amid the\r\nacclamations and laughter of the assembly, and especially of the other\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIn all negro Africa the husbands are generally strangers to the\r\njealousy of honour which exists among the intelligent husbands of\r\ncivilised countries. They do not care for moral fidelity, based on\r\naffection and free choice. The Kaffir woman, Schouter tells us, is the\r\nox of her husband. A Kaffir said one day, speaking of his wife, “I have\r\nbought her, therefore it is her duty to work.”\r\n\r\n“The negro,” relates another traveller (Monteiro), “knows neither love,\r\naffection, nor jealousy. During the many years that I have spent in\r\nAfrica I have never seen a negro manifest the least tenderness for a\r\nwoman--put his arms around her, give or receive a caress, denoting some\r\ndegree of affection or love on one side or the other.... They have no\r\nword in their language to signify love or affection.”[357]\r\n\r\nA French traveller says also of the Malagasies, “Modesty and jealousy\r\nare two sentiments very little developed among the Malagasies of both\r\nsexes and all ranks. They push licence very far in their manners, but\r\nquite unconsciously.”[358]\r\n\r\nThroughout black Africa, indeed, marriage does not exist, at least\r\nin the sense we attach to the word. It is not a civil institution,\r\nmuch less a sacrament; it is a bargain, delivering the woman to the\r\nmercy of the buyer. Here and there, however, we see dawnings of legal\r\nmarriage--that is to say, a contract sanctioned by civil authority.\r\nAmong the Bongos of the upper Nile, for example, a man who wishes to\r\nprocure a certain woman generally applies to the chief or to some\r\ndignitary, who enforces his demand.[359]\r\n\r\nWith the Malagasies, where the social organisation is much more complex\r\nand _quasi_ feudal, there is already a veritable civil marriage. The\r\nfuture pair, accompanied by their parents, go before the judge or the\r\nchief of the village, declare their intentions, pay the _Hasina_,\r\nor matrimonial tax, and the union is concluded. As is the case in\r\nmany countries, Malagasian polygamy already tends towards monogamy.\r\nAt Madagascar, as in China, rich men have one chief wife, who has a\r\nhouse to herself and other privileges; but by the side of the titular\r\nwife there are lesser wives.[360] I shall have to return to this\r\nhierarchical polygamy, which forms a sort of evolutionary connecting\r\nlink between primitive polygamy, subjecting all the wives equally\r\nbefore their owner, and monogamic marriage. But for the present I must\r\npursue my summary inquiry through the lands of primitive polygamy.\r\n\r\nIn the whole of Polynesia polygamy was general and unlimited. There,\r\nagain, the number of wives was strictly in proportion to rank and\r\nriches.[361] There were, however, examples of voluntary monogamy[362]\r\namong the chiefs, and a much larger number of monogamists, in spite of\r\nthemselves, in the lower classes.[363] In several Polynesian islands\r\npolygamy was already evolving towards monogamy; thus, at Samoa,[364]\r\nat Tonga,[365] in New Zealand,[366] there existed a chief wife,\r\nexempted from hard work, and having pre-eminence over the other wives.\r\n\r\nOver all the great American continent polygamy is or has been in force.\r\nThe Ancas or Araucanos of South America--nomads and robbers--buy very\r\ndear wives when they can, and make concubines of all the prisoners\r\nprocured in their razzias, exactly after the manner of the ancient\r\nArabs. The poor or the feeble among them, as elsewhere, are badly\r\nprovided, and are frequently reduced to remain celibate,[367] or to\r\nhave only one wife. For the same reasons, the young men among the\r\nOtomacs were often obliged to be contented with an old woman,[368] and\r\nthe Charruas waited till their first wife grew old before procuring\r\na younger one.[369] Herrero tells us also, that in Honduras forced\r\nmonogamy was general enough, except, indeed, for the chiefs, who\r\nappropriated the women by the right of the strongest.[370] In South\r\nAmerica, as in Africa, the women were very far from rebelling against\r\npolygamy; for there, also, all the hard work fell to them, and the\r\nburden of it was lightened in proportion to the number of labourers. In\r\nthe tribes that were already agricultural, the Guaranis, for example,\r\nthe men did nothing to the land but clear off the brushwood and timber;\r\nthen came the women, who did all the sowing, harvesting, prepared the\r\nfermented drink for guests,[371] without mentioning other domestic\r\ncares. Such a kind of life is necessarily unfavourable to delicacy, and\r\neven amongst civilised people habitual overwork is hardly compatible\r\nwith refined sentiments. In all countries exclusive love and jealousy\r\nsuppose not only some moral development, but also a certain amount\r\nof leisure and of time and capacity, to think. It is therefore quite\r\nnatural that the savage woman should seldom pretend to possess a man\r\nfor herself alone, and on this point the women of the Redskins of\r\nNorth America think and feel like the Guarani women of Brazil. Thus,\r\nwith the Omahas, the man hardly ever takes a second wife but with the\r\nconsent of the first.[372] Often the initiative even comes from her;\r\nshe goes to find her husband, and says to him, “Marry the daughter\r\nof my brother. She and I are of the same flesh.” It must be admitted\r\nthat America is the promised land of the matriarchate, or rather, of\r\nmaternal filiation; polygamy easily takes an incestuous colour there;\r\nthe wives of the same man are often relatives, habitually sisters. In\r\nabout forty of the Redskin tribes, and surely they are not the only\r\nones, when a man marries the eldest daughter of a family, he acquires,\r\nby express privilege, the right of taking afterwards for wives all the\r\nsisters of the first as soon as they become marriageable.[373] This was\r\nthe custom of the Omahas, the Cheyennes, the Crees, the Osages, the\r\nBlack-feet, the Crows, the Spokans of Columbia,[374] the Chawanons of\r\nLouisiana, etc.\r\n\r\nThe custom was not, however, obligatory. The wives were not necessarily\r\nrelatives, or, at least, not necessarily sisters. Thus, with the\r\nOmahas, a man sometimes took as wives an aunt and a niece of his first\r\nwife.[375] Among the Californians a man sometimes married not only a\r\ngroup of sisters, but also their mother,[376] and in this respect the\r\nGreenlanders imitated their hereditary enemies, the Redskins.[377]\r\nBut, consanguine or not, polygamy was general among the savage tribes\r\nof North America. The possession of a numerous flock of wives placed\r\na man above the common as surely as that of a large fortune does\r\nin Europe;[378] religion even sanctified this polygamy, for in all\r\ncountries it can accommodate itself to the dominant morals. Thus, the\r\nChippeways believe that polygamy is agreeable to the Great Spirit; for\r\nit is a means of having a numerous posterity.[379]\r\n\r\nExcept the habitual consanguinity of the wives, the polygamy of\r\nthe Redskins has nothing original in it; it is, as elsewhere, the\r\nprivilege of the rich men.[380] Sometimes also the girls are retained\r\nfrom infancy, and then, as happens with the Noutka-Columbians, the\r\nbuyer deposits certain valuable articles as security.[381] In these\r\npolygamous families of Redskins the harmony is rarely disturbed; and\r\nthe man, always having the power to repudiate any wife as he may\r\nplease, only has to command very submissive ones.[382] Here and there\r\ncertain customs appear which have a shade of monogamy about them; for\r\ninstance, among the Columbians every wife has her separate habitation,\r\nor, at the least, her special fireside.[383] Sometimes there is a chief\r\nwife having authority over the other wives.[384] But everywhere the\r\nsubjection of women in regard to man is extreme. Among the Indians\r\nof New Mexico--and these are not by any means the most savage--the\r\nwomen have to prepare the food, tan the skins, cultivate the ground,\r\nfabricate the clothes, build the houses, and groom the horses. In\r\nreturn for this, the men, whose sole occupations are hunting and war,\r\nbeat their wives without pity, and often mutilate and kill them.[385]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Polygamy in Asia and Europe._\r\n\r\nWe might already deduce some general ideas from our rapid survey\r\nof savage polygamy in Oceania, Africa, and America; but it will be\r\nconvenient, before we do so, to interrogate the primitive races of Asia\r\nand Europe. Doubtless, the description of their conjugal manners and\r\ncustoms, after all that precedes, may seem monotonous; nevertheless,\r\nthis monotony even is instructive; it proves that in all times and\r\nplaces, in despite of differences of race, climate and environment, the\r\nevolution of human groups is subject to certain laws, that the family,\r\nmarriage, the constitution of property, and social organisation pass\r\nthrough a series of necessary phases; in short, that in attempting to\r\nconstruct a science of sociology we are not pursuing a chimera.\r\n\r\nI resume, therefore, my enumeration. Among the indigenous tribes of\r\nIndia polygamy is widely spread, without, however, being universal; for\r\neach one of these small peoples has evolved, as it has been able, more\r\nor less rapidly. Some among them are polyandrous, and even monogamous.\r\nOften enough polyandry co-exists with polygamy, the one appearing as\r\nmoral as the other.\r\n\r\nWith all these aborigines, marriage, or what we are pleased to call\r\nso, is generally concluded by purchase, and the price of the woman\r\nnaturally oscillates according to the law of supply and demand. Most\r\noften it is represented by poultry, pigs, oxen, or cows, given to the\r\nparents. From this manner of procuring wives it seems that, there\r\nalso, polygamy is the luxury of the rich or of chiefs. Among the\r\nMishmis these privileged individuals sometimes possess sixty wives.\r\nThe Mishmi husbands form a rare exception on one point--they are not\r\nat all exacting about the fidelity of their wives; they consider them\r\nas slaves or servants, and provided they continue to benefit their\r\nmasters by their work, the latter willingly shut their eyes to their\r\nintrigues.[386]\r\n\r\nAmong these polygamous tribes, which it would take too long to\r\nenumerate, may be counted the Miris, the Dophlas, the Juangs, the\r\nKhamtis, the Singphos, etc.\r\n\r\nWe must again note in certain tribes, the Khamtis, for example, the\r\nmonogamic pre-eminence of the first wife.[387] It is one of those\r\nsociological analogies of which I have already spoken, and it is\r\nimportant to point it out.\r\n\r\nPolygamy still prevails with the mountaineers of Bootan, concurrently\r\nwith polyandry. It is often incestuous; a man willingly marries two\r\nsisters, the one an adult, the other younger. But no other incest\r\nis recognised or punished except that committed between son and\r\nmother.[388]\r\n\r\nFarther north, among the Ostiaks, a man feels no repugnance to marrying\r\nseveral sisters,[389] and, in general, polygamy is very widely spread\r\namong the nomad Mongols. A Yakout, for example, if obliged to make\r\nfrequent journeys, takes care to have a wife in every place at which\r\nhe stops.[390]\r\n\r\nThe polygamic _régime_ is also in great honour in the Mongolian\r\narchipelagoes of Asia, in the Palos Islands, in the Caroline Islands,\r\netc. Among the Battas of Sumatra it evidently begins to be distasteful\r\nto the women, since the polygamous husband is obliged to assign to each\r\nof his wives a special hearth, and kitchen utensils of her own, with\r\nwhich she prepares her food apart, or with that of her husband, when\r\nshe is on duty, and required by the master.[391]\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I confine myself to primitive polygamy, to that of the\r\ngrossest savages or barbarians; but there are barbarians of every race\r\nand colour, and the roots of all superior civilisations necessarily go\r\nfar down into primitive savagery. Now we have seen that the polygamic\r\n_régime_ is prevalent throughout the world among races that are little\r\ncultivated; we may hence conclude that the most civilised nations must\r\nhave begun with polygamy, and, in reality, it has been thus everywhere\r\nand always. In the various civilised societies, living or dead,\r\nmarriage has commenced by being polygamous. It is a law which has few\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Peru, the Incas decreed monogamy to be obligatory for the\r\nlower classes. The Chinese attribute to Fo-Hi, their first sovereign,\r\nthe institution of marriage. This legendary king is said to have raised\r\nthem out of promiscuity. Such also was the _rôle_ of Cecrops, in\r\nGreece, and the same thing happened in primitive India. About thirty\r\nyears ago a number of erudite Europeans, especially the mythologists\r\nand linguists, were smitten with a blind love for the Indian hymns of\r\nthe Rig-Veda. They set to work to torture these old Sanscrit texts,\r\nnaturally obscure, and by subjecting them to a sort of linguistic\r\nexamination, they wrung from them imaginary revelations. It was\r\ndecided that a unique and marvellous race, primitively endowed with\r\nevery virtue and capacity, had sprung up one fine day on some plateau\r\nor other of Central Asia. The most enthusiastic of them generously\r\nendowed these hypothetical Aryans with superhuman faculties. A French\r\nacademician believed and declared that from the high plateaus of Pâmir\r\nthey perceived the sea, distant, however, some hundreds of leagues;\r\nhe affirms that they understood the “circles of the stars,” and were\r\nomniscient. It is to be presumed that this model race was of necessity\r\nmonogamous, since it was perfect. To-day, however, we must demolish all\r\nthese castles in the air, too lightly built in primitive and chimerical\r\nArya. The antiquity of the Vedic hymns has had to be much shortened,\r\nand, if we consent to read them without prejudice, we shall have little\r\nadmiration for the authors, those gross Aryans, who tried to make their\r\ngods drunk in order to obtain cows, and who sacrificed and cut to\r\npieces animals, and perhaps men, on their altars. There is surely room\r\nto suppose that their social condition was not more refined than their\r\nreligion. On this point the information that may be drawn from the\r\nVedic hymns is vague and drowned in the waves of religious effusion.\r\nNevertheless the Rig-Veda speaks of spouses of the gods, and of princes\r\nsurrounded by their wives, etc. In fact, a document much more precise\r\nand more recent, the Code of Manu, abundantly proves that the Hindoos,\r\nlike all other peoples, have begun by being polygamous.\r\n\r\nI do not now insist on this point, as I shall return to it later.\r\nIn every country the primitive races have practised polygamy, when\r\nthat has been possible for them. Our European ancestors have not been\r\nmore scrupulous on this point than our hypothetical Aryan cousins of\r\nCentral Asia. Cæsar tells us that the Gauls were polygamous, and had\r\nthe right of life and death over their wives.[392] Tacitus vaunts much\r\nthe monogamy of the Germans; this moral feature, says he, distinguishes\r\nthem from other barbarians, but he confesses that certain German chiefs\r\nhad several wives, and that, as it happens in all barbarous countries,\r\nthe wife was sold by the parents for presents consisting of oxen,\r\nhorses, and arms.[393]\r\n\r\nPolygamy was so natural to German morals that, long after Tacitus, the\r\nMerovingian kings, Clotaire and his sons, for example, still practised\r\nit, that Dagobert had three wives, and that Charlemagne himself was\r\nbigamous. We know, too, that Saint Columban was banished from Gaul\r\nonly for having blamed the polygamy of King Thierry. Let us resign\r\nourselves, therefore, to confess the truth. The white race has no\r\ndivine investiture. Like all the others, it has sprung from animality;\r\nlike all the others, it has been polygamous, and we have only to open\r\nour eyes to perceive that, in the present day, in countries reputed to\r\nbe the most civilised, and even in the classes reputed to be the most\r\ndistinguished, the majority of individuals have polygamic instincts\r\nwhich they find it difficult to resist.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to form a just opinion of primitive polygamy.\r\nIts causes are manifold. The principal one is often the disproportion\r\nof the sexes, resulting from the enormous mortality of men which savage\r\nlife necessitates. The desire of giving the rein to a sensuality that\r\nthere is, as yet, no thought of repressing, may have a certain share\r\nin the matter; but this motive, which is perhaps dominant in the\r\npolygamous anthropoid apes, quickly becomes secondary in man.\r\n\r\nEven the lowest savage is more calculating, and has more forethought,\r\nthan the monkey. His first slave, one may say his first domestic\r\nanimal, is his wife. Even when he is still a simple hunter and nomad,\r\nhe has always game to be carried, fire to be lighted, a shelter to be\r\nerected, without reckoning that wives are very apt at gathering edible\r\nfruits and shell-fish, and rendering a thousand services. Besides, they\r\ngive birth to offspring that can be bartered, sold, or even eaten at\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, very desirable to possess as many as possible\r\nof these beings, fitted for such various ends. If a man is an\r\nagriculturist, the wife is then of still greater utility; he puts upon\r\nher all the hard work; she digs, plants, sows, reaps even, and all\r\nfor the profit of her master. She is, besides, a subjected and feeble\r\ncreature, whom he can treat just as he will, and on whom he can let\r\nloose his instincts of brutal domination. By force or by ruse, by\r\ncapture or by purchase, he therefore procures himself as many wives\r\nas possible. He often buys them in the lump; for example, a lot of\r\nsisters, or of relations of different ages. This diversity of age has\r\nits value; for, in all the numerous uses to which a wife can be put,\r\nthe younger ones can take at need the place of the elder when the\r\nlatter are worn out or broken down.\r\n\r\nPolygamy begins with equality--that is to say, that the man subjects\r\nhis little feminine flock to an equal servitude, against which the\r\nwives do not think of rebelling, as they find it quite natural, for\r\nthey are not of a more refined nature than their proprietor. By\r\ndegrees, however, a certain hierarchy is established among the wives of\r\nthe same man. This comes to pass when the social structure is already\r\nmore complex, when there are chiefs, nobles, and priests. Polygamy,\r\nin this case, is restrained. Though it continues to be the taste of\r\nnearly all men, it becomes the privilege of the rich and powerful. The\r\nlatter sometimes even indulge in an excessive polygamy, and it becomes\r\ndifficult for them to maintain order and servile submission among their\r\nfeminine flock. From this time they have one or more titular wives, who\r\nrule over their companions, and are sometimes exempt from hard labour.\r\nThese chief wives are often daughters, sisters, or relatives of noted\r\nwarriors, or of important men, with whom the husband is allied, and\r\nwhose prestige somewhat protects the wives that they have given, or\r\nmore often sold. In consequence of this, a certain tendency to become\r\na distinct personality awakens in the wives themselves; they insist on\r\nhaving their separate hearth, and even their distinct apartment; life\r\nin the flock weighs on them.\r\n\r\nPolygamy then puts on monogamic tendencies. The greater number of\r\nsuperior races have adopted this hierarchical polygamy before reaching\r\nthe legal monogamy, in a mitigated form, of which I shall treat later.\r\nIt is important now to describe with some details this polygamy of\r\nsuperior races.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[339] Baudin, _Hist.

To begin with, both in the\r\ncase of human beings and of anthropoid apes, sexual unions have not\r\nbeen reduced to any rule; promiscuity has been rare and exceptional,\r\nbut polygamy has been very common, at least a gross polygamy, not\r\nregulated in any way, and merely resulting from the monopoly of the\r\nwomen by the strongest or the richest men. It has been a sort of\r\nconjugal anarchy, admitting simultaneously of various matrimonial\r\nforms, as polyandry, term marriage, experimental marriage, etc., during\r\nperiods of more or less length.\r\n\r\nBesides their primordial _rôle_ as child-bearers, wives were found very\r\nuseful in other ways--either for the satisfaction of sensual desires,\r\nor for the execution of a number of painful labours; and therefore\r\nmen endeavoured to procure as many of them as possible, first by\r\ncapture, and then by purchase, or by giving a certain amount of work in\r\nsubmitting to a temporary servitude. In the preceding chapter I have\r\ngiven the history of this primitive, savage polygamy which as yet no\r\nlaw regulated.\r\n\r\nDuring the first phases of their social evolution, all the human races\r\nhave practised, with more or less brutality, this gross polygamy. We\r\nhave seen--and it is a subject to which I shall have to return--how,\r\nin the bosom of the polygamic _régime_, monogamic tendencies have\r\nappeared, which by degrees have ended by prevailing amongst all the\r\nmore civilised races. These races have resigned themselves to adopt\r\nmonogamy, or at least legal monogamy. I say “resigned,” for it seems\r\nthat monogamy costs much to man; in reality laws and customs have\r\neverywhere attenuated the severity of it for him by various compromises\r\nof which I shall soon have to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Arab Polygamy._\r\n\r\nHowever, among the superior races, there is one, the Arab race,\r\nwhich, up to our own time, has maintained and legalised the polygamic\r\n_régime_, while propagating and regulating it among the various\r\npeoples that have come under its domination. If, in this respect, the\r\nArab race has been an exception to the general evolution, it is not\r\nbecause it is less gifted than the others; it has sufficiently proved\r\nthis. According to the ancients, a fantastic fish, the _remora_, had\r\nthe power of suddenly stopping the passage of ships at sea; religion\r\nhas played this part for the Arabs. Theoretically, all the great and\r\nsolidly constituted religions are incompatible with progress. Although\r\nrelatively they may appear innovations at the moment of their birth,\r\nyet they bar the route of the future, and, as much as is in their\r\npower, oppose all ulterior evolution. This is imperative, since they\r\npretend to declare the immutable will of divine personages, who are\r\nomnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly wise, and who cannot consequently\r\neither re-touch or amend the laws that they make, and the commands\r\nthey give to poor human creatures. Now, Islamism arose amidst the full\r\npolygamic _régime_; its founder could not even dream of establishing\r\nany other. Polygamy was therefore established by divine right among\r\nthe faithful, and as at the bottom it is in accord with the primitive\r\ninstincts of man, it has maintained itself in Mussulman countries from\r\nthe time of Mahomet to our own days. From the sociological point of\r\nview this is a most interesting fact, for it gives us the opportunity\r\nof studying and estimating the polygamic _régime_ in its full\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nLet us listen at first to the Koran; we will then consult the Arabian\r\njurists and the customs of contemporary Arabs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the holy book loudly proclaims the inferiority of women,\r\nwhich naturally justifies their subjection, and this subjection is\r\ngreat in all polygamous countries. There is no ambiguity on this point\r\nin the words of the prophet: “Men are superior to women by reason\r\nof the qualities God has given them to place them above women, and\r\n_because men employ their wealth in giving dowries to women_. Virtuous\r\nwomen are obedient and submissive; they carefully guard, during their\r\nhusband’s absence, that which God has ordered them to preserve intact.\r\nThou shalt correct those whom thou fearest may be disobedient: thou\r\nshalt put them in beds apart: _thou shalt beat them_: but as soon as\r\nthey obey thee again, do not seek cause for quarrel with them. God is\r\nmerciful and great.”[394]\r\n\r\nThis text is eloquent. It first of all consecrates masculine\r\nsuperiority by divine right, then marriage by purchase, and lastly, the\r\nliberty of the husband to treat his wives with brutality.\r\n\r\nThe restrictions on polygamy found in the Koran are very slight:\r\n“Marry not the women whom your fathers had to wife: it is a sin, and\r\nabomination: except what is already past.”[395]\r\n\r\nNo retrospective effect here! We may conclude from this that, up to the\r\ntime of Mahomet, the sons inherited the harem of their father, as is\r\nstill the case in a number of little despotic states of negro Africa.\r\n\r\nThe holy book also commands respect for the feminine property of\r\nothers, save in the case of capture by war or of religious infidelity\r\nof the husband. “You are forbidden to take to wife free women who are\r\nmarried, except those women whom your right hand shall possess as\r\nslaves: such is the law of God.”[396] “O believers! when believing\r\nwomen come unto you as refugees, try them. And if you know them to be\r\ntrue believers, send them not back to their infidel husbands; but give\r\ntheir husbands back what they have expended for their dower.”[397]\r\nIn the Koran the respect for money is already much greater than for\r\nfemales. The wife must be purchased. “It is permitted unto you to\r\nprocure wives with money, and you shall keep them in virtuous ways,\r\navoiding debauchery. Give unto her with whom thou dost cohabit the\r\ndower thou hast promised.”[398]\r\n\r\nThe prophet counsels the faithful, without however commanding it,\r\nto have a small number of wives: “But if ye fear that ye cannot act\r\nequitably towards the orphans, take in marriage of such other women as\r\nplease you, two, or three, or four, and not more.”\r\n\r\nThe text ends with a permission to the man merely to pay a fictitious\r\ndowry to the wives: “Assign dowries freely to your wives, and if it\r\npleases them to give you back a part, enjoy it conveniently at your\r\nease.”[399]\r\n\r\nAs for the prophet himself, he was to be above most of the restrictions\r\nwhich he imposed on others: “O prophet, we have allowed thee thy wives\r\nunto whom thou hast given their dower, and also the slaves which thy\r\nright hand possesseth of the booty which God hath granted thee, and\r\nthe daughters of thy uncle, and the daughters of thy aunts, both on\r\nthy father’s side and on thy mother’s side, who have fled with thee\r\nfrom Mecca, and any other believing woman, if she give herself unto\r\nthe prophet.”[400] “O prophet, if believing women come to thee for an\r\nasylum, having promised thee that they will flee idolatry, that they\r\nwill not steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill their children, and\r\nwill not disobey thee in anything that is just: believe them and pray\r\nfor them: God is indulgent and merciful.”[401] This last text gives\r\na sad enough idea of the morality of the Arab women before the time\r\nof Mahomet; but taken together with the preceding one, it shows how\r\nconvenient and even agreeable it is to be the interpreter of the Divine\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nWith such facilities for recruiting, the harem of the prophet must have\r\nbeen richly furnished; therefore he has taken care to free himself from\r\none duty which he recommends to others, of _debitum conjugale_: “Thou\r\nmayest,” he says to himself, “either grant or refuse thy embraces to\r\nthy wives.”[402]\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, he says to vulgar believers: “Ye can by no means carry\r\nyourselves equally between wives in all respects, though you study to\r\ndo it; therefore turn not from a wife with all manner of aversion, nor\r\nleave her like one in suspense; if ye agree and fear to abuse your\r\nwives, God is gracious and merciful.”[403]\r\n\r\nPolygamy is not rare in the world. We have seen it and shall see it\r\nagain in the course of our inquiries; but the polygamy of the Koran\r\nhas an advantage over most of the others; it is at once celestial\r\nand terrestrial, for the paradise of true believers is only an ideal\r\nharem: “Say, O believer, what shall I declare of greater benefit for\r\nthose who fear God, than gardens through which flow rivers of water,\r\nwhere they shall dwell for ever, and there shall be women, who are pure\r\nvirgins, etc.[404]... Damsels having large black eyes. Therein shall be\r\nagreeable damsels, whom no man or genius hath deflowered.[405] There\r\nshall be young and beautiful virgins.[406]... And near them (the elect)\r\nshall be houris with large black eyes, having complexions like rubies\r\nand pearls.[407] Verily we have created the damsels of Paradise by a\r\npeculiar creation.”[408]\r\n\r\nThe whole of this sacred code sanctifies the inferiority of the woman,\r\nand this inferiority has not been at all mitigated in practice; for\r\niniquity, always tenacious, is far more so when it is authorised by\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nWe must notice, however, in regard to Mussulman marriage, a\r\ncircumstance which at first sight is singular: it is that Mahometanism\r\nintervenes in nothing, as religion, in all that concerns marriage; all\r\nconjugal matters are absolutely private, and even the civil power does\r\nnot appear any more than the religious power in the celebration of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the future husband goes to declare his union to\r\nthe sheik or cadi, who then remits the minute of it to the interested\r\nparty, without keeping a copy of it. This formality is, besides, in no\r\nway obligatory; the marriage is considered as a private act, and if\r\nafterwards any disputes should arise in relation to it, the parties\r\nconcerned arrange them as well as they can, by appealing to the\r\ntestimonial proof.[409]\r\n\r\nIt all amounts to this, that for Mussulmans the wife is a thing, and\r\nthe marriage a simple bargain. The wife is always sold to the husband,\r\nand the price is discussed either by her legal representative or by her\r\nconventional agent. The nuptial gift is even essential to marriage, and\r\nif it has not been paid the wife has the right to refuse all intimate\r\ncommerce. “The wife sells herself,” says Sidi Khelil; “and every vendor\r\nhas the right to retain the merchandise sold until after taking the\r\npayment.”[410] Before buying, the suitor is allowed to see the face and\r\nthe hands of the bride; for the hands of the woman are reputed to give\r\nan idea of her personal beauty.[411]\r\n\r\nA man ought, whenever possible, to marry a virgin, and the bargain may\r\nbe concluded several years before the delivery of the merchandise.[412]\r\nIf the girl is still a virgin, not emancipated, but beyond the age when\r\nit is considered necessary to commence the special _rôle_ reserved to\r\nher sex, the father has the right to impose marriage on her.[413]\r\n\r\nThe orphan girl can also be married by the authority of the Cadi, if\r\nshe is more than ten years old, and if there is reason to fear that she\r\nmay lead an irregular life.[414]\r\n\r\nIn all other cases the consent of the girl is necessary. This\r\ncircumstance, let us especially note, constitutes a real moral\r\nprogress beyond savage polygamy, and we shall presently see that it is\r\nnot yet realised in Kabyle. The consent of the girl is given in two\r\nways, according to whether she is a virgin or not. This interesting\r\nparticular must be frankly declared during the negotiation; the Koran\r\ncommands it. If the girl is a virgin, it is understood that modesty\r\nshould deprive her of speech, and in order to signify yes or no, she\r\nmust have recourse to the language of signs. She can, for example, show\r\nher repugnance by covering her face, and her content by smiling. But if\r\nshe is no longer _virgo intacta_ she is allowed to speak freely.[415]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, according to the Koran, the woman owes her master an\r\nabsolute submission; and he, in return, whatever may be the number of\r\nhis wives, binds himself morally not to leave any one of them “as in\r\nsuspense.” This precept of the sacred code is specifically carried out.\r\nEvery Mussulman owes to his wives an equal share of his nights, and she\r\nwho has had the favour of the night has a right to the following day\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nWhen the husband buys a fresh wife he is indebted to her seven\r\nsuccessive nights if she is a virgin; for three only, in a contrary\r\ncase. He has the right to refuse greater exactions than this.[416]\r\n\r\nBut the husband has other obligations. He must supply food to his wife,\r\neven if she is afflicted with a voracious appetite. This last case is\r\nconsidered as a calamity, but the husband must resign himself to it,\r\nor repudiate the glutton.[417]\r\n\r\nThe husband owes, besides, to his wife or wives water to drink, water\r\nfor ablutions and purifications, oil to eat, oil to burn, oil for\r\ncosmetic unctions, wood for cooking and for the oven, salt, vinegar,\r\nmeat every other day or otherwise, according to the custom in various\r\ncountries. He must supply them with a mat or a bed--that is to say, a\r\nmattress--and a cover to put on the mat. These duties have correlative\r\nrights. The husband has the right to forbid his wife to eat garlic, or\r\nto eat or drink any other thing which may leave a disagreeable odour.\r\nHe may interdict any occupation likely to weaken her, or impair her\r\nbeauty.[418] Finally, if she refuses her conjugal obligations without\r\nreasonable motives, the husband can at will deprive her of salt,\r\npepper, vinegar, etc.[419] The sum total of these restrictions renders\r\nan Arab woman’s position a very subordinate one, both before and after\r\nmarriage. But the fate of the Kabyle woman is much more miserable.\r\n\r\nWe are always hearing it repeated in France that the Kabyle man is\r\nmonogamous, and consequently not so different from ourselves in this\r\nrespect as the Arab; but among the Kabyles, as among the Arabs, it is\r\npolygamy which is legal; and if the greater number of the Kabyles are\r\nmonogamous in practice, it is chiefly from economy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their republican customs, of their respect for individual\r\nliberty, of the rights they accord to the mother, and of certain\r\nsafeguards with which they protect the women in time of war, contrary\r\nalso to the liberal tendencies of the Berbers in relation to women,\r\nthe Kabyles of Algeria treat their married women and their daughters\r\nas actual slaves, and they are in this respect inferior to the Arabs\r\nthemselves.[420] In all matters that refer to sexual relations the\r\nKabyle customs are ferocious. Outside of marriage all union of the\r\nsexes is severely interdicted in Kabyle, and the married woman has no\r\npersonality; she is literally a thing possessed.[421]\r\n\r\nThe young Kabyle girl is sold by her father, her brother, her uncle,\r\nor some relation (_açeb_); in short, by her legal owner. In announcing\r\nhis marriage, a man says quite bluntly--“I have bought a wife.” When a\r\nfather has married his daughter, the phrase in ordinary use is--“He has\r\neaten his daughter.”[422]\r\n\r\nAmong the Cheurfas, but it is an exceptional case, the girl is\r\nconsulted on the choice of a husband when she has attained the age of\r\nreason; everywhere else the virgin daughter is never consulted, and\r\neven the widow and repudiated wife, to whom the Mussulman law accords\r\nliberty, cannot dispose of themselves in Kabyle countries.[423]\r\n\r\nIn many tribes, however, the daughter can twice refuse the man that is\r\nproposed to her; but after that she has exhausted her right, and is\r\nforced to submit.[424]\r\n\r\nThe legal owner of the Kabyle woman generally gives her, at her\r\nwedding, garments and jewels; or rather, he lends them to her, for it\r\nis forbidden to the woman to dispose of them, and at her death these\r\nprecious articles must be returned to her relatives.[425]\r\n\r\nAn essential condition of the Kabyle marriage, as of the Arab, is the\r\npayment of a certain price, generally debated, but which certain tribes\r\nof southern Jurjura have fixed once for all. This price is called the\r\n“turban” (_thâmanth_), as with us “pin-money” is spoken of. A penal\r\nsanction guarantees the payment of the _thâmanth_ and the delivery of\r\nthe person sold.[426]\r\n\r\nIn principle the woman has no right over the _thâmanth_.[427]\r\n\r\nBesides the purchase money, or _thâmanth_, the Kabyle further\r\nstipulates in addition that he shall receive a certain quantity of\r\nprovisions (cattle, or food, flour, oil, butter) to be consumed during\r\nthe marriage festivities.\r\n\r\nThe villages which have tariffed the _thâmanth_ have also fixed the\r\namount of these presents.\r\n\r\nThe father likewise stipulates, for the benefit of the daughter who is\r\nsold, a gift of garments and of jewels; but this gift dispenses the\r\nhusband from providing in this respect for the maintenance of the wife\r\nduring one year. This is particularly necessary, because the bride, in\r\nquitting her parents, leaves them all that she has received,[428] and\r\ntakes away nothing but her body.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes the mother who thus makes the conjugal sale of her\r\ndaughter, but on condition of being recognised as guardian; and even\r\nthen she does not enjoy, like the father, an unrestrained power, and\r\nshe has to consult her daughter.[429]\r\n\r\nOnce purchased, the Kabyle wife is entirely at the mercy of the\r\nhusband-proprietor. She must follow him wherever it suits him to\r\nsettle; her only actual possession is the raiment which covers her.\r\nHer husband has the right to chastise her with his fist, with a stick,\r\nwith a stone, or even with a poignard. He is only forbidden to kill her\r\nwithout a reasonably serious motive.[430]\r\n\r\nIf, however, when she has become a mother, she is unable to suckle her\r\nchild, the law decides that the husband is obliged to provide a wet\r\nnurse;[431] though this is more for the child’s sake than the mother’s,\r\nas she cares little enough about the infant.\r\n\r\nThe married woman is considered so entirely as property in Kabyle that\r\nthe prolonged absence of the master is allowed to set her free. In this\r\ncase she belongs, after four years, to her maternal relations, who\r\nhave the right to re-marry her--that is to say, to re-sell her--unless\r\nthe absent husband has left her a sufficient provision. However, the\r\nhusband’s parents can delay the dissolution of the first marriage,\r\nsometimes for seven years, sometimes for ten years, but on condition of\r\ntaking the place of the absent husband in furnishing the deserted wife\r\nwith food and clothes.[432]\r\n\r\nThe Kabyle woman, therefore, married or not, is always a thing\r\npossessed. We shall see later that even widowhood does not enfranchise\r\nher. The right of correcting the woman who is not under the power of a\r\nhusband ceases only when she has reached an age when marriage would be\r\nsterile, and especially if she has in a way abjured her sex by mixing\r\nwith men in the markets.[433]\r\n\r\nVery often the assimilation of the Kabyle people to the French is\r\nspoken of as a thing relatively easy. It appears to me that the servile\r\nsubjection of the Kabyle woman is an almost insurmountable obstacle to\r\nthis dream of fusion. Without doubt the married woman in France is only\r\na minor; but in Kabyle she is still in the lowest stage of slavery. In\r\nthis respect the Berbers of Kabyle are on a level with the coarsest\r\nsavages; they are even inferior to the Arabs, although the latter have\r\npreserved almost unchanged the polygamic _régime_ of the old Islamite,\r\nand even pre-Islamite ages. But in all times and all countries the\r\ncondition of woman is the measure of the moral development of the whole\r\npeople. Now, in regard to this there is a gulf between Kabyle and\r\ncivilised Europe.\r\n\r\nThe polygamic _régime_ has, besides, in every country an almost\r\nnecessary result--the slavery of women. This is natural. As in the\r\nhordes of chimpanzees, the male, the anthropomorphous paterfamilias,\r\nonly maintains his authority by force and by expelling his rivals, so,\r\nin human societies, the polygamous husband can hardly be anything but\r\nthe proprietor of subjugated beings, not daring to aspire to freedom.\r\nIt may be remarked also that the polygamic appetite, so habitual to\r\nman, cannot be strange to woman. Both have the same blood and share the\r\nsame heredity. The polygamous husband, therefore, has always to prevent\r\nor repress the straying of his feminine flock by close confinement or\r\nby terror. Under a polygamic _régime_ the wife has scarcely any rights;\r\nshe has chiefly duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Polygamy in Egypt, Mexico, and Peru._\r\n\r\nI have dwelt long enough on Mussulman polygamy. From a sociological\r\npoint of view it is extremely interesting. It affords us the\r\nopportunity of studying from life customs which, with differences of\r\ndetail, must have been those of all civilised peoples at a certain\r\nperiod of their evolution, and which probably have only been kept up\r\namong the Islamites on account of the confusion of civil and religious\r\nlaws, these last giving to polygamy a sort of consecration.\r\n\r\nIn all the great primitive barbarous monarchies the polygamy of the\r\nfirst ages has been by degrees restrained or abolished, according to\r\nthe measure of social progress.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Egypt polygamy was still in force; but already it was\r\ninterdicted to the priests,[434] contrary to what has happened nearly\r\neverywhere. As a matter of fact, and by the simple necessity resulting\r\nfrom the proportion of the sexes, even when polygamy is authorised and\r\nlegal, it is especially the luxury of rich and powerful men; the common\r\npeople have everywhere been reduced to monogamy, whether they wished\r\nit or not. Under most of the great early despotic monarchies which\r\nhad emerged from primitive savagery this fact became legalised, and\r\nplurality of wives constituted a privilege reserved to the great ones\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Peru monogamy was obligatory for men who possessed nothing,\r\nbut not for the Inca and the nobles of the kingdom. Thus the last Inca,\r\nAtahualpa, had three thousand wives or concubines. As generally happens\r\nwhen polygamy is restrained, there was already a hierarchy among the\r\nwives of the Inca; one of them, who was obliged to be his sister,\r\nthe _coya_, was reputed superior to the others, and her eldest son\r\nsucceeded his father.[435] On this point, as on many others, ancient\r\nPeru had unconsciously copied Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico also, monogamy was habitual for the poor, but the powerful\r\nand the nobles had a number of wives proportioned to their rank and to\r\ntheir riches.[436] In Mexico, as in Peru, polygamy was monogamic in\r\nthe sense that one wife had pre-eminence over the others, and that her\r\nchildren alone inherited the paternal title and wealth.\r\n\r\nThis polygamy of princes and potentates, who by right of birth soar\r\nabove the common rule, is found also in the great Aryan empires of\r\nAsia.[437]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Polygamy in Persia and India._\r\n\r\nThe polygamy of the monarchs of ancient Persia seems to have been\r\ncopied from that of the kings of Egypt, or of the Incas of Peru. They\r\nhad numerous concubines and three or four wives, of whom one was\r\nespecially considered as queen, or privileged wife.[438]\r\n\r\nAs for the Persians of more ancient times still, the Mazdeans who drew\r\nup the sacred code of the Avesta, if we refer to the Zend text, we\r\nfind they had a most severe sexual morality. The Avestic code condemns\r\nand punishes resort to prostitutes, seduction, sexual extravagances,\r\nabortion, etc. Throughout that portion of the Avesta which has come\r\ndown to us there is no recognition of polygamy, and the verses which\r\nmention marriage have quite a monogamic meaning. It seems, however,\r\nsays one of the translators of the Avesta, that among the ancient\r\nPersians polygamy may have been authorised in case of sterility of\r\nthe first wife.[439] Like anthropophagy, polygamy is an original\r\nsin with human societies. But writings so exclusively religious and\r\neven liturgic as the Avesta constitute very incomplete sources of\r\ninformation in regard to civil institutions. To study the marriage of\r\nthe ancient Persians in the Avesta seems about as illusory as it would\r\nbe to study ours in a Catholic prayer-book.\r\n\r\nWe know also, from the Code of Manu and historical and ethnographical\r\ndocuments, that polygamy is and has been far from being unknown in\r\nIndia, and yet it is difficult to prove from the text of the Vedic\r\nhymns that the writers of these chants have practised it.\r\n\r\nThis may be inferred, however, from several verses. In the beginning\r\nthe morals were coarse enough for abortion to be common. “Let Agni,” we\r\nread in a hymn, “kill the rakchasa who, under the form of a brother, a\r\nhusband, or a lover, approaches thee to destroy thy fruit.”[440] On the\r\nother hand, woman is held in slight esteem by the sacred chants. She is\r\na being “of incapable mind and unfit for serious employment.”[441] In\r\none hymn, Satchi, the daughter of Buloman, boasts of having eclipsed\r\nher rivals in the eyes of her husband.[442] A certain number of verses\r\nspeak of the wives of the gods: “The praying cows, these wives of Agni,\r\nwish to obtain a proof of the virility of the god.”[443]\r\n\r\nIn Sanskrit the word “finger” is feminine, and thus very often the\r\nfingers which handle the sacred mortar are called the ten wives of\r\nAgni.[444]\r\n\r\nIn short, other accounts leave us no room to doubt that in primitive\r\nIndia, as elsewhere, the great and the powerful have largely practised\r\npolygamy from Vedic times.[445]\r\n\r\nThat these customs have been those of Brahmanic India, the text of Manu\r\nin antiquity, and the reports of travellers in modern times, attest\r\nloudly enough. One verse of Manu regulates the right of succession\r\nof sons that a Brahmin may have by four wives belonging to different\r\ncastes. “If a Brahmin has four wives belonging to four classes, in\r\nthe direct order, and if they all have sons, this is the rule of\r\ninheritance. Let the son of the Brahmin (after having deducted the\r\nbull, the chariot, and the jewels) take three parts of the rest; let\r\nthe son of the Kchatriya wife take two parts; that of the Vaisyâ, one\r\npart and a half; that of the Soudra, one part only.”[446]\r\n\r\nAnother verse, much more singular, declares that the children of a\r\nsecond wife belong to the person who has lent the money to buy her:\r\n\r\n“He who has a wife, and who, after having borrowed money from some one,\r\nmarries another with it, derives no other advantage than the sensual\r\npleasure; the children belong to the man who has given the money.”[447]\r\nAs for the king, the Code of Manu permits polygamy to him in the\r\nlargest measure, at least under the form of concubinage. He ought to\r\nhave a troop of wives, whose duty it is to fan him, and to pour water\r\nand perfumes over his august person. He refreshes himself with them\r\nfrom the cares of government, and passes the night in their agreeable\r\ncompany.[448] We must not forget, besides, that, as the Mahabharata\r\nhas informed us, the Kchatriyas practised marriage by capture and\r\npolygamy.[449]\r\n\r\nTo sum up, in India, as everywhere else, polygamy has evolved; it\r\nhas at first been common; then, when power and riches have been\r\nconcentrated in the hands of a small number, it has become the\r\nprivilege of the great. The polygamy of the princes and of the rich\r\nBrahmins was even the first obstacle encountered in the seventeenth\r\ncentury by the preaching of the Jesuits in India.[450]\r\n\r\nIn the present time it is the same for the great, and custom tolerates\r\na second wife, even to common husbands, in case of sterility of the\r\nfirst.[451] I shall have to speak again of these customs in treating of\r\nconcubinage.\r\n\r\nIf we now sum up the general sense of the numerous facts which I have\r\njust passed in review, we see that with the entire human race polygamy\r\nhas succeeded to the sexual and conjugal anarchy of the first ages.\r\nLike all other institutions, primitive polygamy has gradually become\r\nregulated, but always while keeping the woman in a very humiliating\r\nposition. One fact of great importance, and which has by degrees\r\nruined the _régime_ of a plurality of wives, even when custom, law,\r\nand religion authorised it, is that polygamy became a luxury within\r\nthe reach only of rulers, as soon as a tolerable social condition\r\nrestrained the too rapid mortality of males. Indeed, from this moment\r\nthe sexual equilibrium of births compelled the greater number of men to\r\npractical monogamy, and thenceforth, as Herbert Spencer justly remarks,\r\na public opinion was necessarily formed in favour of monogamy. Often,\r\ntherefore, polygamy constituted a legal privilege; it was expressly\r\nlimited to kings, great men, and priests.\r\n\r\nBesides this a hierarchy became established among the numerous wives,\r\nand one of them had precedence of her companions.\r\n\r\nFinally, legal monogamy was decreed, but this monogamy was in\r\nappearance only. In practice the pain of it was softened by\r\ncompromises, notably by prostitution, which was at least tolerated, and\r\nby concubinage, which received the consecration of law.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[394] Koran, Sourate, iv. 38.\r\n\r\n[395] Koran, Sourate, iv. 26.\r\n\r\n[396] _Ibid._ iv. 28.\r\n\r\n[397] _Ibid._ lx. 10.\r\n\r\n[398] _Ibid._ iv. 18.\r\n\r\n[399] _Ibid._ iv. 3.\r\n\r\n[400] Koran, xxxiii. 47.\r\n\r\n[401] _Ibid._ lx. 12.\r\n\r\n[402] _Ibid._ xxxiii. 49.\r\n\r\n[403] _Ibid._ iv. 128.\r\n\r\n[404] _Ibid._ iii. 13.\r\n\r\n[405] Koran, lii. 20.\r\n\r\n[406] _Ibid._ lv. 56-70.\r\n\r\n[407] _Ibid._ lvi. 22.\r\n\r\n[408] _Ibid._ lvi. 35.\r\n\r\n[409] E.

Societies evolve slowly; it is by degrees that customs become\r\nrefined, and that laws are formulated of a less and less brutal kind.\r\nIt has been with marriage as with everything else. To the confusion\r\nof primitive bestial unions, when polygamy after the manner of\r\nchimpanzees prevailed, have succeeded sexual associations regulated\r\nby laws and customs. I have successively described these outlines\r\nor primitive forms of marriage, ending with polygamy, which itself\r\nis not incompatible with a somewhat advanced civilisation, but which\r\ngenerally, by its restrictions, soon develops a tendency towards\r\nmonogamy.\r\n\r\nThe abyss is not so very great that separates polygamic from monogamic\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, primitive man, besides having a purely animal absence\r\nof modesty, has generally polygamic instincts, and nothing can be more\r\nnatural, since he descends from anthropoid precursors, and the great\r\nmonkeys are habitually polygamous. But the solidity of instincts, moral\r\nor immoral, is always in proportion to the duration of their rise.\r\nNow, during enormous chronological periods or cycles, in comparison\r\nwith which the historic ages of humanity are but a moment, our nearest\r\nanimal ancestors and our prehistoric percursors have, as far as it was\r\npossible, lived in a polygamic _régime_. It is therefore quite natural\r\nthat most men, even in the present time, should be much inclined\r\nto polygamy, and that primitive societies should only have emerged\r\nslowly and imperfectly from it, while tempering monogamic marriage by\r\npolygamic palliatives. Of these palliatives the two principal ones\r\nstill in use amongst the most civilised peoples are prostitution and\r\nconcubinage, which last becomes a concubinate when legalised.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Prostitution._\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be out of place here to give a detailed history of\r\nprostitution. Having, besides, repeatedly spoken of it in the preceding\r\nchapters, I may now confine myself to recapitulating the chief traits\r\nof its evolution. In primitive societies, as we know, it is general,\r\nand in no way blamed. Free girls and women willingly sell themselves,\r\nand more often still, they are an article of traffic for their parents,\r\nlike any other merchandise.\r\n\r\nNo idea of shame as yet attaches to sexual unions considered in\r\nthemselves. Prostitution is a simple barter which shocks no one,\r\nand venal love is merely restrained by respect for the property of\r\nanother. Women who are already appropriated, or possessed by a man,\r\nare in principle respected, but solely by the same title as any other\r\nproperty. Their masters, their husbands, those who have bought or\r\ncaptured them, have a perfect right to hire them out to whomsoever they\r\nwill, as the Australian husbands do, and as the Polynesian ones did.\r\n\r\nWhen the appropriation of women, polygamic as much as possible,\r\nbecame general, the more than fickle instincts of primitive man\r\npersisted none the less; and, as a matter of fact, it is then that\r\nprostitution, in the modern sense of the word, first arose. Outside the\r\nmajority of women, regularly belonging to husband-proprietors, there\r\nexisted, in much smaller numbers, women trafficking their persons,\r\neither voluntarily for their own profit, or for that of their legal\r\npossessors. At Senaar, for example, and in many other countries,\r\nmerchants and slave-dealers trade very profitably in their feminine\r\nlive stock.\r\n\r\nWe know also that, in primitive Athens, the most eminent men possessed\r\ntroops of prostitutes, and drew a large revenue from them; for it is\r\nvery slowly that prostitution, and all that relates to it, has awakened\r\nany scruple in the human conscience.\r\n\r\nEven at the most glorious period of Hellenic civilisation, with what\r\nconsideration were the most distinguished hetaïræ still regarded, since\r\nSocrates and Pericles willingly met at the house of Aspasia!\r\n\r\nIn all the more or less cultivated societies of the old or new world\r\nprostitution has flourished or continues to flourish. It is even in\r\nrefined societies alone that prostitution becomes specialised and\r\nlegalised, and ends by being regulated, by becoming, in short, a kind\r\nof institution, supplementing legal marriage and being concurrent with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEverywhere--in all countries, and among all races--prostitution has\r\nbeen, or continues to be, tolerated, and sometimes even honoured. It\r\nexisted in the great states of Central America, in ancient Peru, in\r\nancient Mexico, and in Nicaragua, where there were already prostitutes\r\nand brothels. In this last country the morals were still so impure,\r\nand continence, although very relative, so difficult to bear, that at\r\na certain annual festival the women of all classes were authorised to\r\nabandon themselves to whomsoever they pleased.[452]\r\n\r\nIn the great societies founded by the Mongoloid races, or the Mongols\r\nof Asia, prostitution displays itself in the open day. In China,\r\ntea-houses abound, although the ancient morality of the Celestial\r\nEmpire makes chastity a moral duty for unmarried girls and women. In\r\nCochin-China and Japan, on the contrary,[453] practice and theory are\r\nin accord. No moral brand of shame attaches to the prostitute. In\r\nCochin-China, says Finlayson,[454] a father has the right to give his\r\ndaughter, for a small sum of money, to a visitor or even a stranger,\r\nwithout the reputation of the young girl suffering any harm, and\r\nwithout any hindrance to her finding a suitable husband afterwards. In\r\nJapan the tea-houses (_tsiaya_) are more numerous still than in China;\r\nin the large towns they form vast quarters, and some of them are very\r\nluxurious. The mode of recruiting for inmates seems at first improbable\r\nto a European, and this alone suffices to show the relativity of\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nEverywhere “the right of the father of a family” over his children has\r\nbegun by being unlimited. In Japan it is still excessive, even over\r\nmarried daughters. Thus M. Bousquet, who was travelling in Japan a few\r\nyears ago, relates that as he was lodging one day in the house of a\r\nyoung married couple, the father of the wife offered her to him, and\r\nthe husband did not dream of protesting.[455]\r\n\r\nA daughter represents a certain amount of capital, belonging first to\r\nthe father and then to the husband; to alienate it without the consent\r\nof the proprietor is a theft, but with his authorisation the action\r\nbecomes lawful, and therefore parents who are in difficulties negotiate\r\ntheir daughter without any intervention by the Japanese law. A young\r\ngirl is even admired when she prostitutes herself from devotion. “The\r\nJapanese romances repeat to satiety the story of the virtuous virgin\r\nwho voluntarily submits to this servitude in order to save her father\r\nfrom misery, or to pay the debts of her betrothed.”[456] In Japan,\r\nhouses of prostitution are a national institution; the law regulates\r\nthe costume of the women who inhabit them, and the duration of their\r\nstay. On this point Europe has little to envy Japan. But what is\r\nspecial to Japan is that the _tikakie_, the inmates of these houses,\r\nare placed there by their parents themselves, and for a price that is\r\ndebated beforehand. These inmates of the tea-houses generally enter\r\nthem from the age of fourteen or fifteen years, to live there till\r\nthey are twenty-five years old. They are taught to dance, to sing, to\r\nplay the guitar, and to write letters. They are lodged in handsome\r\napartments, where men go to see them openly and without any mystery.\r\n\r\nThey are in no way dishonoured by their trade; many of them marry very\r\nwell afterwards; it even happens that respectable citizens go to seek\r\nan agreeable wife in these houses of pleasure. The most beautiful among\r\nthem are celebrated. After their death their portraits are placed in\r\nthe temples. “In the temple of Asaxa,” says M. Bousquet, “is found a\r\npainting representing several Japanese ladies in full dress; they are,\r\nmy guides tell me, the portraits of the most celebrated courtesans of\r\nYeddo, which are annually placed here in their honour.” So also Dr.\r\nSchliemann reports that he has seen statues of deified courtesans in\r\nthe Japanese temples. Their celestial intervention was implored in an\r\noriginal manner. The suppliants first wrote a prayer on a paper, then\r\nmasticated the request and rolled it into a bullet, which they shot\r\nwith an air-gun at the statues of these strange divinities.[457]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Japanese differ very much from us in their idea\r\nof feminine virtue. They have an idea, however, and do not in the\r\nleast permit the women to love as they please. Thus the girl who gives\r\nherself to a lover without paternal authorisation is legally punished\r\nby sixty lashes with a whip, and the Japanese public would not endure\r\nin a play the personage of a young girl in love.[458]\r\n\r\nIt is not the chastity of woman, as we understand it, but her\r\nsubjection, that Japanese morality requires. The woman is a thing\r\npossessed, and her immorality consists simply in disposing freely of\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nAs regards prostitution, Brahmanic India is scarcely more scrupulous\r\nthan Japan, and there again we find religious prostitution practised in\r\nthe temples, analogous to that which in ancient Greece was practised at\r\nCyprus, Corinth, Miletus, Tenedos, Lesbos, Abydos, etc.[459]\r\n\r\nAccording to the legend, the Buddha himself, Sakyamouni, when visiting\r\nthe famous Indian town of Vesali, was received there by the great\r\nmistress of the courtesans.[460]\r\n\r\nBut the Brahmins have not been more strict in what concerns\r\nprostitution than the founder of the great Buddhist religion. On this\r\npoint the accounts of travellers and missionaries supplement the\r\nsilence of the Code of Manu. The writers of _Lettres édifiantes_ found\r\nreligious prostitution openly practised in the Brahmanic temples. “The\r\npeople have put,” writes one of them, “the idol named _Coppal_ in a\r\nneighbouring house; there she is served by priests and by _Devadachi_,\r\nor slaves of the gods. These are prostitute girls, whose employment is\r\nto dance and to ring little bells in cadence while singing infamous\r\nsongs, either in the pagoda, or in the streets when the idol is carried\r\nout in state.”[461] In this case it was a matter of actual commerce,\r\nof trading for the profit of the priests, and the latter had recourse\r\nwithout any shame to what we call to-day the advertisement to attract\r\nthe customers. “I heard,” relates the same missionary, “published with\r\nthe blowing of a trumpet, that there was danger in frequenting the\r\n_Devadachi_ who dwelt in the town; but that one could safely visit\r\nthose who served in the temple of _Coppal_.”[462] An old traveller,\r\nSonnerat, confirms the testimony of the missionaries of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. He affirms that, like all the other Hindoos, the Brahmins are\r\nmuch addicted to libertinage, and that, in their practical morality,\r\nit is not considered a fault to have commerce with a courtesan; that\r\nthey have licentious books in which refined debauchery is taught _ex\r\nprofesso_; that they use love-charms, etc.[463]\r\n\r\nI stop here, and purposely abstain from speaking of the prostitution\r\nof Europe. We know too well that it has always been very flourishing,\r\nas well in ancient Rome as in the Middle Ages, although they were so\r\ncatholic. In old France it established itself boldly, in full daylight,\r\nto such a degree that some towns, that of Rouen for example, had their\r\n_proxénètes jurés_, wearing bronze medals with the arms of the town on\r\nthem.[464] As for contemporary prostitution, it is superfluous to call\r\nattention to the fact that it is one of our great social diseases.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the origin of prostitution goes back to the most primitive\r\nsocieties; it is anterior to all the forms of marriage, and it has\r\npersisted down to our own day in every country, and whatever might\r\nbe the race, religion, form of government, or conjugal _régime_\r\nprevailing. Taken by itself, it would suffice to prove that monogamy is\r\na type of marriage to which mankind has found it very difficult to bend\r\nitself; the very general existence of the concubinate completes the\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Various Forms of Concubinage._\r\n\r\nBetween animal love, that can be tasted with the prostitute, and the\r\nnoblest monogamic union, there is a wide space, which the concubinate\r\nhas filled. Legal concubinage or the concubinate, admitted and\r\npractised, as we shall see, in so many countries, is a sort of free\r\nmarriage, tolerated by custom, recognised by law, and co-existing by\r\nthe side of monogamic marriage, the rigour of which it palliates. It\r\nwas at first a blending of polygamy with monogamy, and then, undergoing\r\nitself an evolution analogous to that which has caused the adoption\r\nby degrees of legal monogamy among nearly all civilised peoples, it\r\nended by becoming in its turn monogamic in ancient Rome. I will briefly\r\nretrace its ethnographical history.\r\n\r\nIn its primitive phase, still very confused, the concubinate has been\r\nsimply the conjugal appropriation of slaves, especially of women\r\ncaptured after a victory. These were part of the rights of the victor;\r\nthe captives were considered as booty, and shared in the same way. We\r\nhave already seen in Deuteronomy that Moses authorises this barbarous\r\npractice, and that it was habitual also among the primitive Arabs. The\r\nHomeric warriors did the same, as various passages of the _Iliad_ and\r\n_Odyssey_ prove.\r\n\r\nI will quote a few of them. To begin with, we find the old priest\r\nChryses comes to offer Agamemnon a rich ransom for his daughter, and\r\nreceives from the king of kings the brutal reply--“I will not set your\r\ndaughter free: old age shall find her in my dwelling at Argos, far\r\nfrom her native land, weaving linen and sharing my bed. Go, then, and\r\nprovoke me not.”[465]\r\n\r\nThersites, speaking to Agamemnon, is still more explicit--“Son of\r\nAtreus, what more dost thou require? What wilt thou? Thy tents are full\r\nof brass and of many most beautiful women, that we give first to thee,\r\nwe, Acheans, when we take a town.”[466] Elsewhere, Achilles, speaking\r\nof his beloved Briseis, of whom he had been robbed, cries--“Why have\r\nthe Atreides led hither this vast army? Is it not for the sake of the\r\ndark-haired Helen? Are they, then, the only men who love their wives?\r\nEvery wise and good man cherishes and loves his wife. And I also loved\r\nBriseis from my heart, although she was a captive.”[467]\r\n\r\nAnd, a little further on, he makes a clear distinction between the\r\nslave concubine and the legitimate wife, swearing never to accept as\r\nwife a daughter of Agamemnon.\r\n\r\nIn the _Odyssey_, when Ulysses enters unrecognised his own house, and\r\nsees pass before him in the vestibule his female slaves, laughing and\r\njoyous as they go to play with the suitors, his feelings are not merely\r\nthose of a lawful proprietor who is offended, but of a jealous man\r\nwhose harem has been violated. At first he is tempted to kill these\r\nwomen, which he actually does a little later, and he hears “his heart\r\ncry out in his bosom, as a bitch, turning around her young ones, barks\r\nat a stranger and tries to bite him.”[468]\r\n\r\nBut such customs have prevailed here and there up to modern times.\r\nIn 1548, in Peru, when Pedro de la Gasca had defeated the party of\r\nPizarro, he distributed amongst his followers the widows of the\r\ncolonists who were killed.\r\n\r\nAt Asterabad, after a small local revolt, Hanway saw the Persian\r\nmagistrates sell fifty women to the soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn Livonia, after the taking of Narva, Peter the Great coolly sold to\r\nthe boyars the wives of the inhabitants.[469] Bruce tells us also that\r\nin Abyssinia the victors habitually take possession of the wives of the\r\nvanquished.[470]\r\n\r\nBut if captives serve or have served somewhat in all countries to\r\nsupply the domestic concubinate, they were not the only ones reserved\r\nfor this purpose; female slaves, however procured, were treated as\r\nsuch. The fact is so well known that I shall abstain from establishing\r\nit by examples. I only quote one observed at Sackatoo, in tropical\r\nAfrica, for it proves clearly that in a barbarous country, concubinage,\r\nor the domestic and servile concubinate, does not outrage morality in\r\nany way, and is regarded merely from a commercial point of view. At\r\nSackatoo, when a married man has intimate relations with one of the\r\nfemale slaves given as dowry to his wife, he need simply replace her\r\nthe following day by another slave who is a virgin and of equal value.\r\nOn this purely mercenary condition, the caprice of the husband never\r\noccasions any conflict with the legitimate wife.[471]\r\n\r\nThe relative and so-called Christian civilisation of the Abyssinians\r\naccommodates itself very easily to such customs. By the side of the\r\n_oizoro_, the proud and indolent matron, all the great nobles have a\r\ntroop of pretty servant girls with sprightly looks.[472]\r\n\r\nThe king sets the example, and naturally he goes further still. If any\r\nwoman has had the good luck to please him, he sends an envoy to invite\r\nher to live in the palace. This distinction is received as it should\r\nbe: the lady adorns herself as quickly as possible, and obeys without\r\na murmur; but above these concubines there is the wife or queen, the\r\n_itighe_.\r\n\r\nAs far as they can, ecclesiastical dignitaries imitate laic ones.\r\nBruce found one, the Abba-Salam, guardian of the sacred fire, third\r\npersonage in authority in the church, who forced women to yield to\r\nhim by a threat at the same time pious and original--the fear of\r\nexcommunication.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the Malagasy concubinage, of the chief wife\r\n(_vadi-be_) having her own apartment and privileges, and ruling\r\nover the “lesser wives” (_vadi-keli_), who live together in equal\r\nsubmission.[473]\r\n\r\nIn short, the domestic concubinate is largely practised over all\r\ncentral or barbarous Africa.\r\n\r\nThe ancient half-civilised nations of central America did not disdain\r\nit either. In Peru, as we shall see, the monogamic _régime_ was\r\nobligatory, but only for the poorer people.\r\n\r\nIn the Maya nations, the rich and powerful practised the concubinate\r\nwithout any moderation.[474] At Guatemala, the parents were filled with\r\nsolicitude on this point, and when a young noble married a girl of his\r\nown rank who had not yet attained puberty, they were careful to keep\r\nhim patient by giving him a young slave as concubine, whose children,\r\nhowever, would not be his heirs.[475]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico the were three kinds of concubines:--\r\n\r\n1. Young girls not yet arrived at a marriageable age, and whom the\r\nparents usually chose for their sons at the request of the latter.\r\nThese unions required neither ceremony nor contract, but they were\r\noften legitimated later, when they became fruitful.\r\n\r\n2. Partially legitimate wives, who were also partially married,\r\nretaining only the characteristic trait of the conjugal ceremony--that\r\nis, the tying together of the garments of the half-married ones. These\r\nwives could not be repudiated without a motive, but neither they nor\r\ntheir children could inherit.\r\n\r\n3. Lastly, the third class comprehended simple concubines, largely\r\nkept by the nobles, and who ranked not only lower than the legitimate\r\nwives, but also than the half-legitimate ones.[476] All this system is\r\ningenious, and it is certainly difficult to state the gradation better.\r\n\r\nHowever common the concubinate may be, nowhere do we find it so wisely\r\ncombined as in ancient Mexico, where four sorts of sexual association\r\nwere recognised--monogamic marriage, consecrated by law and religion;\r\nsemi-legitimate marriage; free and durable union with a legitimable\r\nconcubine; and lastly, free love, escaping all regulation.\r\n\r\nI shall proceed soon to take an estimate of these customs, so different\r\nfrom our own, but it still remains for me to speak of the concubinate\r\namong the superior races, the yellow and the white. The Mongols of\r\nTartary are monogamous in principle, in the sense of having one sole\r\nlegitimate wife; but the rich and noble have by the side of this matron\r\nor chief wife, concubines or lesser wives, subject to the former,\r\nwho has precedence and rules over them, who governs the household,\r\nand whose children are considered legitimate and have hereditary\r\nrights.[477]\r\n\r\nIn China, the concubinage of the Mongols has been carefully regulated,\r\nlike everything else; it is naturally, as elsewhere, the privilege\r\nof the rich and great, who sometimes keep a veritable harem, and\r\npeople it by purchasing pretty girls, scarcely arrived at puberty,\r\nfrom their parents (Macartney, _Hist. Univ. des Voy._, t. xxxiii.\r\n473).[478] According to the current morality of China, the concubinate\r\nis blamed unless the legitimate wife remains sterile for ten or twelve\r\nyears.[479] Formerly an attempt was made to restrain it, by only\r\ntolerating it for the mandarins and childless quadragenarians;[480] but\r\nthese severe measures have fallen into desuetude.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the Chinese concubinate has no other check than\r\nhuman respect and public opinion. It is perfectly legal. The first or\r\n_chief wife_ is an honoured matron; she commands the _lesser wives_,\r\nwho owe her respect and obedience. If a husband attempts to lower her\r\nto the rank of lesser wife, he incurs the bastonnade with a hundred\r\nstrokes of the bamboo, but ninety only if, on the contrary, he tries\r\nto raise a lesser wife to the supreme rank.[481] The legal concubines,\r\nthe lesser wives, are subordinate to the especially legitimate wife,\r\nand are forbidden to assume the dress reserved for her.[482] The chief\r\nwife is the mistress of the house; she is not only the mother of her\r\nown children, but also the putative mother of the children of the\r\nlesser wives. The latter children wear mourning for her and not for\r\ntheir natural mother; and it is on the legal mother that they lavish\r\nthe expressions of their respect, affection, and obedience.[483] We\r\nlearn from Chinese comedies that rivalries sometimes break out between\r\nthe matron and her fellow wives; but in general the Chinese woman is so\r\nwell trained, so well broken in from infancy, that this is rare enough,\r\nand Chinese wives have even been known to counsel their husbands\r\nto take concubines in the towns where they may be long detained by\r\nbusiness.[484] It is well to remember, by the way, that the human brain\r\ncan retain all kinds of impressions, and that morality and instincts\r\nstrictly result from the nature of the life and education.\r\n\r\nThe concubinate must actually have been necessary for man, for we see\r\nit practised by all races, and by the white races as well as the others.\r\n\r\nWe know that the monarchs of ancient Assyria had, by the side of the\r\nsingle wife, a good number of concubines, exactly like the Abyssinian\r\nnegroes of our own days, or, to keep to antiquity, like the glorious\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\nPolygamous as they are, the modern Arabs do not on that account abstain\r\nfrom the concubinate. Even at Mecca all the rich men keep in their\r\nhouses, with their legitimate wives, concubines who are generally\r\nnatives of Abyssinia. However, if one of these women becomes a mother,\r\nthe morality of the country requires her master to raise her to the\r\nrank of legitimate wife.[485] The _Mekavy_ of the middle and lower\r\nclass also buy young Abyssinian slaves, teach them to cook and to sew,\r\nmake concubines of them, and re-sell them afterwards advantageously to\r\npassing strangers, especially if they have been sterile;[486] in this\r\ncommerce they unite pleasure and profit.\r\n\r\nThe concubinate is not more rare among the Aryans than the Semites. The\r\nmonarchs of ancient Persia had, we know, a troop of concubines; and in\r\nall the great barbarian societies, the princely concubinate is only the\r\nsurvival of old customs.\r\n\r\nIn India the Brahmins of the middle class often have one chief wife,\r\nand at the same time several domestic concubines.[487]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in Homeric Greece the concubinate was a general\r\npractice, and in no way censured. In later times, when Greece was more\r\ncivilised, the primitive domestic concubinate disappeared, but there\r\nalways remained to alleviate the ennui of monogamic marriage what we\r\ncall concubinage, or hetaïrism, which was openly practised by Socrates\r\nand Pericles. “If,” says Lecky on this subject, “we could imagine a\r\nBossuet or a Fénelon figuring among the followers of Ninon de Lenclos,\r\nand publicly giving her counsel on the subject of her professional\r\nduties and the means of securing adorers, this would be hardly less\r\nstrange than the relation which really existed between Socrates and the\r\ncourtesan Theodota.”[488]\r\n\r\nAll societies which have had any legal form of marriage have adopted\r\nthe concubinate, either free or more or less regulated, but it has\r\nnowhere been so precisely legalised as in ancient Rome. I shall say\r\na few words about it, not that I intend to walk in the steps of our\r\nlegists, but in order to show what assistance ethnographical sociology\r\ncould be to the science of written law. By its means alone can the\r\nlegal texts, which have been a hundred times studied, commented on, and\r\ncriticised in an isolated manner, as if they related to sociological\r\nfacts without analogy in the world, be connected with the general\r\nevolution of customs and institutions.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom, the Roman concubinate is essentially similar to the\r\nothers; it has merely been legalised with more care, and transformed\r\ninto an institution as regular as marriage proper. It was, besides,\r\nindispensable in a country where the right of marriage, the _jus\r\nconnubii_, was restricted. The _leges Julia_ and _Papia Poppæa_ also\r\nexpressly authorise it.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Roman concubinate was a free union between a man and a\r\nwoman not wishing, or not being able, to marry.[489] It was lawful\r\nto have as concubine a woman with whom marriage was forbidden--an\r\nadulteress, an actress, a woman of bad life, or a freed slave. This\r\nlast case was the most frequent, most moral, and the most protected by\r\nthe laws.\r\n\r\nThe intention of the parties, revealed either by a formal declaration,\r\nor by the inequality of conditions, determined between marriage and the\r\nconcubinate. The dowry was one of the signs which served to distinguish\r\nmarriage from the concubinate.\r\n\r\nThe Roman concubinate was only, in fact, a marriage of inferior\r\ndegree.[490] Thus a married man could not take a concubine. A bachelor\r\ncould not have several at the same time.[491]\r\n\r\nThe concubinate implied paternity. The child was considered as a\r\nnatural child of the father (_naturalis, non vulgo conceptus_), though\r\nhe did not enter the father’s family or become his heir, but followed\r\nthe status of his mother.[492]\r\n\r\nThe institution of the Roman concubinate evolved naturally, and its\r\nconditions were more and more ameliorated.\r\n\r\nUnder Constantine, the legitimation of children born from a concubinate\r\nwas permitted in a general way by marriage between the father and\r\nthe woman who had been his concubine up to the day of marriage. It\r\nwas necessary, however, that the man should not have at the time a\r\nlegitimate child. But Justinian authorised the legitimation even in\r\nthis last case; he granted also the benefit of legitimation to the\r\nchildren of an enfranchised slave marrying her master, provided that\r\nthe latter had not then any legitimate children.[493]\r\n\r\nWhen Christian marriage had definitely abolished the Roman legal\r\nconcubinate, custom naturally braved the laws, and the clergy\r\nthemselves were the first to set the example, thus proving the truth\r\nof the assertion in Genesis, “It is not good for man that he should\r\nbe alone.” For a long time the anointed of the Lord had wives or\r\nconcubines. The latter took the place of the former when, by St.\r\nBoniface, St. Anselm, Hildebrand, etc., and the Councils, the marriage\r\nof priests had become an atrocious crime.\r\n\r\nIn 1171, at Canterbury, an investigation proved that the abbot-elect\r\nof St. Augustine had seventy children in a single village.[494]\r\nDuring many years a tax, called by an expressive name (_culagium_),\r\nwas systematically levied by various princes on priests living in\r\nconcubinage.[495] Better still, it often happened that the lay\r\nparishioners obliged their priests to have concubines, _by way of\r\nprecaution_. A canon of the Council of Palencia (1322) anathematises\r\nthe laics who act thus.[496] In his _History of the Council of Trent_,\r\nSarpi says that many Swiss cantons had adopted this custom. At the\r\nCouncil of Constance, an important speaker, Nicolas de Clemangis,\r\ndeclared that it was a widely-spread practice, and that the laity were\r\nfirmly persuaded that the celibacy of the priests was quite fictitious.\r\nBayle quotes on this point the following remarkable passage--“Taceo de\r\nfornicationibus et adulteriis a quibus qui alieni sunt probro cæteris\r\nac ludibrio esse solent, spadonesque aut sodomitæ appellantur; denique\r\nlaici usque adeo persuasum habent nullos cælibes esse, ut in plerisque\r\nparochiis non aliter velint presbyterum tolerare nisi concubinam\r\nhabeat, quo vel sic suis sit consultum uxoribus, quæ nec sic quidem\r\nusque quaque sunt extra periculum.”\r\n\r\nIf, leaving aside the middle age and its clergy, we cast our eyes\r\naround us in the most civilised and polished European societies,\r\nwe see that the concubinate has indeed disappeared, but that its\r\ninferior form, concubinage, is very flourishing. Centuries of legal\r\nand religious restraint have not been able to uproot it, and the\r\nrigid monogamic marriage inscribed in our laws is constantly set at\r\ndefiance by our customs. Nearly everywhere the number of births called\r\nillegitimate is on the increase. In France it constantly progresses--\r\n\r\n  From 1800 to 1805      4.75 per cent.\r\n   ”   1806 to 1810      5.43    ”\r\n   ”   1821 to 1825      7.16    ”\r\n\r\nSince that time the proportion has oscillated round 7.25 in France. But\r\nin Sweden, from 1776 to 1866, it has risen from 3.11 per cent. to 9.5.\r\nIn Saxony the return has been 15.37 in 1862-1864.[497]\r\n\r\nAt Paris, according to the calculations of A. Bertillon, more than a\r\ntenth of the couples (40,000) were living in free union.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if we interrogate all races, all epochs, and all countries,\r\nwe see that the concubinate and concubinage have flourished, and still\r\nflourish, by the side of legal marriage. One country alone is an\r\nexception to this--Kabyle. But the exception confirms the rule. If we\r\nfind in Kabyle neither concubinage nor concubinate, neither free unions\r\nnor natural children, the reason is very simple. It is that outside\r\nmarriage no sexual union is tolerated, and in case of illegitimate\r\nbirth the mother and child are both put to death, whilst retaliation\r\nfalls on the illegal father.[498]\r\n\r\nThe concubinate is therefore, or at least has been till now, natural\r\nto man. One may say, borrowing a locution from Bossuet, that this\r\nis proved by “the experience of all the centuries.” It remains for\r\nme now to deduce from the facts I have enumerated a sketch of the\r\ngeneral evolution which they represent, and to estimate their moral\r\nsignificance. The evolution is of the simplest. Sexual union, without\r\nrestraint or law, has been the commencement. Then the right of the\r\nstrongest or the richest has created polygamic households. In these\r\nhouseholds the priority was at last bestowed on one wife; but as the\r\nhusband did not intend to curb his changing humour, he kept by the side\r\nof the chief spouse either slaves or “lesser wives,” to whom, in the\r\nend, a legal position was accorded. The monogamic _régime_ making more\r\nand more way, the time came--at Rome, for example--when this disguised\r\npolygamy was no longer tolerated, and the concubinate became a marriage\r\nof the second order, being unable to co-exist with the other. At\r\nlength there was a pretence of abolishing it, and there was no other\r\nmatrimonial type legally recognised except the monogamic union, lasting\r\ntill the death of the husband or wife. But custom has rebelled against\r\nthe law, and monogamy has been more apparent than real. Prostitution\r\nfor the least refined, adultery and free union for the others, have\r\nserved as safety-valves for inclinations too inveterate and too violent\r\nto be controlled by legal texts. Has moral purity gained thereby?\r\nSurely not. Moreover, there is in consequence a whole population of\r\nillegitimate children, too often abandoned by their fathers, and\r\nsuffering from their birth a legal indignity of the most iniquitous\r\nkind. Hence arise a thousand unmerited sufferings, which legislation\r\nmust some day or other remedy, and from which the legal concubinate has\r\nspared China, for example. Doubtless the ideal is a fine thing, but it\r\nis folly to sacrifice the real to it, and to legislate without taking\r\ninto account the requirements of human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[452] Bancroft, _loc. cit._, vol. ii. p. 676.\r\n\r\n[453] _Hist.

Without\r\ndoubt, in a society composed sensibly of equal numbers of men and\r\nwomen, the more powerful and rich may monopolise several women by the\r\nright of the strongest, but in doing so they wrong the community, and\r\npublic opinion becomes hostile to the practice. It is thus that with\r\nthe Dyaks the chiefs lose their authority and see their influence\r\ndiminish when they indulge in polygamy, although no law forbids it.[499]\r\n\r\nAnother cause quite as powerful which contributed greatly to lead\r\nto legal monogamy was the institution of individual and hereditary\r\nproperty. L. Morgan does not hesitate to refer monogamic marriage to\r\nthis sole origin. Indeed, in all societies more or less civilised, the\r\ndesire for heritable property has quickly assumed a capital importance;\r\nthe more or less equitable regulation of questions of interest, and\r\nthe anxiety to safeguard these interests, form the solid basis of all\r\nwritten codes. Now, nearly everywhere the heritage is transmitted\r\naccording to filiation, sometimes maternal, sometimes paternal; but it\r\nis only in the monogamic _régime_ that the parentage of children is the\r\nsame for all in the paternal as well as the maternal line.[500]\r\n\r\nOver and above this, moral motives have reinforced the great influences\r\nresulting from the laws of natality and the all-powerful questions of\r\ninterest. In theory or ideal, the life-long union of two beings, giving\r\nand devoting themselves to each other, engaging to share good and evil\r\nfortune, is surely very noble; but, as we shall see, the realisation of\r\nmonogamic marriage has everywhere been most gross, and it is difficult\r\nto refer it to elevated aspirations. Unless we are intoxicated with\r\nsentimentalism, we cannot believe, with Bachofen,[501] that women,\r\nnaturally more noble and more sensitive than their gross companions,\r\ngrew tired of primitive hetaïrism, and, obeying powerful religious\r\naspirations, enthroned monogamic marriage by force, becoming by the\r\nsame stroke heads of the family, and inaugurating gynecocracy. These\r\nAmazonian fables are very energetically contradicted by history and\r\nethnography.\r\n\r\nNearly in every age, and nearly in every place, woman, by reason of\r\nher native weakness, has been subordinate to her companion, often\r\noppressed by him, and her subjection is the more severe as the\r\ncivilisation is the more primitive. It is a great error to believe\r\nthat in all times and places monogamic union is the sign and necessary\r\nseal of an advanced civilisation. A number of primitive tribes are\r\nmonogamous; certain monkeys are so too. Among the inferior monogamous\r\nraces I will mention the Veddahs[502] of the woods of Ceylon, so low\r\nin intelligence that they have not even names for the numbers; the\r\nBochimans of South Africa,[503] scarcely more developed; the Kurnais of\r\nAustralia, among whom monogamy, though not obligatory, is general.[504]\r\nCertain aborigines of India,[505] less primitive, no doubt, than these\r\nvery humble specimens of our species, but still very savage, are also\r\nmonogamous. These are: the Nagas, who are contented to make their one\r\nwife work very hard; the Kisans, who limit themselves to a single wife,\r\nand have not even any concubines;[506] the Padans, who set a good\r\nexample to more than one superior race, for not only do they blame\r\npolygamy and only practise it exceptionally, but they do not buy their\r\nwives, and leave to their young people the liberty of marrying as they\r\nplease.[507]\r\n\r\nThe form of marriage is therefore not necessarily connected with the\r\ndegree of general civilisation. The contrary is well proved, since\r\nvery civilised peoples have adopted polygamy, sometimes openly, and\r\nvery often in a masked form. Man is willingly polygamous by instinct,\r\nbut he is often forced to bend to the necessities of social existence.\r\nTherefore, in the same country, and in the same race, we may meet\r\nwith tribes and ethnic groups very analogous in everything else, but\r\npractising very dissimilar conjugal forms. It is not rare, for example,\r\nto see monogamy and polygamy elbowing each other. Thus the Redskins\r\nare willingly polygamous, and yet the Pimas, the Cocomaricopas, and\r\na number of tribes on the banks of the Gilo, of Colorado and of New\r\nMexico, only marry one wife, whilst with the Navajos, the Comanches,\r\netc., a man has as many wives as he can buy.[508]\r\n\r\nWith the Zapotecs of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec there is no polygamy;\r\nit is forbidden.[509] On the contrary, with all the Indians of Columbia\r\npolygamy is general; but the Otomacs, who are reckoned among the most\r\nsavage, are monogamous.[510] Necessity makes the law; and although\r\nit may be the legal form of marriage adopted by the superior races,\r\nmonogamy does not imply in itself an advanced civilisation. Besides,\r\nthe numerous facts that I have previously quoted abundantly prove that\r\npolygamy and monogamy can coexist in the same society--the former for\r\nthe sole use of the ruling classes, the latter for the common people.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Monogamy in the Ancient States of Central America._\r\n\r\nIt was thus in Mexico,[511] where, among the wives of the great men,\r\none alone was called lawful; her children inherited the paternal title\r\nand wealth, to the exclusion of the others.[512] In Peru, as in Mexico,\r\nthe law, with the bold partiality which there is no attempt to disguise\r\nin barbarous societies, permitted polygamy to the Inca and to the\r\nenormous family of the Incas, while exacting a strict monogamy from the\r\npoor. State communism, imposed on the country, regulated the sexual\r\nunions somewhat as our rural proprietors regulate the coupling of their\r\ndomestic animals. Peruvian marriage was a civil act, very comparable to\r\nenforced military service in modern Europe. Every year in the kingdom\r\nof Cuzco it was the practice to assemble together in the squares of\r\nthe towns and villages all the individuals of marriageable age, from\r\ntwenty-four to twenty-six years for the men, and from eighteen to\r\ntwenty for the women. At Cuzco the Inca himself married the persons of\r\nhis own family, and always in a public square, by putting in each other\r\nthe hands of the different couples. In their respective boundaries\r\nthe chiefs of districts, resembling our mayors, fulfilled the same\r\nfunction for the persons of their own rank or of an inferior rank. We\r\nare indeed told that the consent of parents was necessary, but it was\r\nnot a question of the consent of the interested parties.[513] Besides,\r\nit was strictly forbidden to marry outside the civil group of which the\r\nindividuals formed a part. In this case marriages must often have been\r\ncontracted between relatives more or less near. As to incest, there\r\nwas little severity, since the Inca was legally bound to marry one of\r\nhis sisters, with the reservation that she might not be his uterine\r\nsister,[514] and the same rule was at last extended to the nobles of\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nIn sanctioning the civil marriage of the country, the public\r\nfunctionary, the _Curaca_, administered to the couple the oath of\r\nconjugal fidelity, which, according to P. Pizzarre, was generally kept;\r\nperhaps because, as we shall see later, the Peruvian law was not tender\r\nto adulterers.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to have been the least nuptial ceremony in Peru.\r\nIn Mexico, on the contrary, marriage was celebrated with much show,\r\nand it was religious. The bride was conducted in great pomp to the\r\nhouse of the bridegroom, who came with his family to meet her. The\r\ntwo processions mutually perfumed each other with boxes of burning\r\nincense. After this the future spouses sat down on the same mat, and\r\na priest married them by tying the robe of the bride to the mantle of\r\nthe bridegroom. The precaution had previously been taken to consult\r\nthe diviners and augurs. Nuptial festivals followed, in which the\r\nnewly-married couple took no part. They lasted four days, and the\r\nmarriage was not to be consummated until their termination.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Monogamy in Ancient Egypt._\r\n\r\nIn the ancient empires of central America the position of the wife was\r\nvery subordinate;--this is an ordinary fact in barbarous countries. But\r\nin this respect, a singular exception seems to have existed in ancient\r\nEgypt, which nevertheless offers so many analogies to ancient Peru.\r\nThis anomaly must be described with some details, because the believers\r\nin a prehistoric gynecocracy complacently rely on it to support their\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe general assertions of the writers of antiquity on this point have\r\nbeen confirmed by the demotic deeds recently deciphered. I shall\r\nbriefly quote both.\r\n\r\nLet us listen first to Herodotus on the subject of Egyptian women:\r\n“They have established laws and customs opposite, for the most part,\r\nto those of the rest of mankind. With them the women go to market and\r\ntraffic; the men stay at home and weave.... The men carry burdens on\r\nthe head, the women on the shoulders.... The boys are never forced to\r\nmaintain their parents unless they wish to do so; the girls are obliged\r\nto, even if they do not wish it.”[1] From this last rule it is already\r\nlogical to infer that the women possessed and inherited property,\r\nwhich is not ordinary in primitive monarchies. Herodotus adds that “no\r\nwoman performs sacerdotal duties towards a divinity of either sex; the\r\npriests of all the divinities are men.”[515] In a country so profoundly\r\nreligious this interdict clearly proves that in public opinion, at\r\nleast, the woman was held to be an inferior being. Besides, polygamy\r\nwas permitted in Egypt, which suffices of itself to exclude the idea of\r\nfeminine domination in the family. However, Herodotus relates that many\r\nEgyptians, especially “those that dwelt on the marshes,” have, like the\r\nGreeks, adopted monogamy.[516]\r\n\r\nDiodorus goes further than Herodotus. He affirms that in the Egyptian\r\nfamily it is the man who is subjected to the woman: “Contrary to the\r\nreceived usage of other nations, the laws permit the Egyptians to marry\r\ntheir sisters, after the example of Osiris and Isis. The latter, in\r\nfact, having cohabited with her brother Osiris, swore, after his death,\r\nnever to suffer the approach of any man, pursued the murderer, governed\r\naccording to the laws, and loaded men with benefits. All this explains\r\nwhy the queen receives more power and respect than the king, and why,\r\namong private individuals, the woman rules over the man, and that it is\r\nstipulated between married couples, by the terms of the dowry-contract,\r\nthat the man shall obey the woman.”[517]\r\n\r\nThe assertion of Diodorus seems at first sight inadmissible;\r\nnevertheless, the demotic deeds, in a measure, confirm it. If the\r\nfamily subjection of the man was not general in Egypt, at least it\r\nexisted in a number of cases. In reality, the Egyptian law did not\r\ndeal with marriages, and the interested parties contracted them at\r\ntheir will. Now, in virtue of the law of matriarchal inheritance,\r\nthe woman was often richer than the man. She could therefore dictate\r\nhow the marriage contract should be drawn up. The conjugal union was\r\nmanifestly before every thing a commercial agreement, since the word\r\n_husband_ does not appear in the documents until after the reign\r\nof Philopator.[518] The Egyptian woman generally married under the\r\n_régime_ of the separate possession of property; she did not change\r\nher condition, and preserved the right of making contracts without\r\nauthorisation; she remained absolute mistress of her dowry. The\r\ncontract also specified the sums that the husband was to pay to his\r\nwife, either as nuptial gift, or as annual pension, or as compensation\r\nin case of divorce.[519]\r\n\r\nSometimes even, by acts subsequent to marriage, the Egyptian wife could\r\nsucceed in completely dispossessing her husband, and therefore the\r\nlatter was careful to stipulate, as a precaution, that his wife should\r\ntake care of him during his life, and pay the expenses of his burial\r\nand tomb.[520]\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it appears, indeed, that in ancient Egypt no marital power\r\nexisted, at least in the families of private individuals.\r\n\r\nThis state of things lasted till the time of Philopator, who, in the\r\nfourth year of his reign, established the pre-eminence of the husband\r\nin the family by deciding that thenceforth all the transfers of\r\nproperty made by the wife should be authorised by the husband.[521]\r\n\r\nThese facts, certainly very curious, have seemed decisive to a number\r\nof sociologists who, with Bachofen, like to believe that in prehistoric\r\ntimes there has existed a gynecocratic period--an age of gold, when\r\nwomen reigned as mistresses, and of which the mythic Amazons were\r\na survival. The very incomplete accounts that we possess of the\r\ncondition and _rôle_ of woman in Egypt do not seem to me to warrant\r\nthe importance that is attached to them.\r\n\r\nIn barbarous, as in civilised societies, there are three great means\r\nof influence--religion, military power, and money. In ancient Egypt,\r\nDiodorus tells us, woman was judged unworthy of the priesthood, and\r\ntherefore inferior from a religious point of view. She did not possess\r\nany warlike power. Neither monuments, nor writings, nor traditions\r\nmake any mention of female warriors, analogous either to the Amazons\r\nof fable or those of the king of Dahomey. There remains the influence\r\nof money, doubtless an enormous influence in all societies where it\r\ncan accumulate in the hands of certain individuals to the detriment of\r\nothers. Now, everything proves that if in ancient Egypt women have more\r\nor less enjoyed great independence, and have even abused it so as to\r\nsubject their husbands, they obtained it simply by the power of money.\r\n\r\nEvidently the organisation of property and the laws of succession in\r\nEgypt permitted women to be rich or to become so, and in consequence\r\nto domineer over husbands less favoured in this respect. We shall see\r\nthat in ancient Greece and Rome the same causes produced the same\r\neffects. Is it even necessary to go to ancient times to seek examples\r\nof feminine emancipation, even very insolent emancipation, based only\r\non the dowry or fortune? We also have an abundance of plutocratic\r\nAmazons. But these facts are not incompatible with the legal subjection\r\nof women. If they seem to have been very common in ancient Egypt, it\r\nis because legislation did not meddle with marriage; and it must also\r\nbe remembered that the demotic documents only mention, as is natural,\r\nthe contracts of the upper or middle classes, the propertied classes,\r\nwhich, of course, are a minority.\r\n\r\nSo little was gynecocracy inscribed in the laws and customs of Egypt\r\nthat a simple royal decree depriving women of the disposition of their\r\nproperty sufficed to cast them into the subordinate rank which they\r\nhave occupied until the present time in all human societies, but which,\r\nperhaps, they will not always occupy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is a noteworthy fact that in a society so rigid as the\r\nEgyptian, a minority of women should have been able to obtain legally\r\na great amount of independence; it constitutes a remarkable exception,\r\nand may, perhaps, be referred to the influence of the Berber races,\r\nwhich, according to Egyptian traditions themselves, played an important\r\npart in the foundation of primitive Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Monogamy of the Touaregs and Abyssinians._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that our contemporary Kabyles, although of\r\nBerber origin, make the yoke of their wives very hard; but it may\r\nbe admitted that, in this respect, they have been influenced by\r\nnumerous conquerors. A certain emancipation of women seems to be a\r\ncharacteristic trait of Berber societies. Even at the present time,\r\namong the Touaregs of the Sahara, who have preserved their independence\r\nand the purity of their race better than the Kabyles, the rich woman\r\nenjoys a social position analogous to that of the ladies of ancient\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the Mussulman law, the Targui woman practically imposes\r\nmonogamy on the man. She would immediately seek a divorce if her\r\nhusband attempted to give her a rival.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Touaregs filiation is still maternal, and confers the rank.\r\n“The child follows the blood of the mother;” the son of a slave or\r\nserf father and a noble woman is noble. “It is the womb which dyes the\r\nchild,” they say in their primitive language.[522] “Absolute mistress\r\nof her fortune, her actions, and her children, who belong to her and\r\nbear her name, the Targui lady goes where she will and exercises a\r\nreal authority.”[523] She seldom marries before the age of twenty, and\r\nshe marries as she pleases, the fathers only intervening to prevent\r\n_mésalliances_. She eats with her husband, to whom, however, she owes\r\nobedience, and who can kill her in case of adultery.--(Duveyrier,\r\n339-340.)\r\n\r\nThe Targui women know how to read and write in greater numbers than the\r\nmen. It is well known, besides, that rudimentary instruction in reading\r\nand writing is widely spread among the Mahometan population of North\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Targui ladies, says Duveyrier, that is due the\r\npreservation of the ancient Lybian and ancient Berber writing.[524]\r\n\r\nLeaving domestic work to their slaves, the Targui ladies occupy\r\nthemselves with reading, writing, music, and embroidery;[525] they live\r\nas intelligent aristocrats.\r\n\r\n“The ladies of the tribe of the Ifoghas are renowned,” says again\r\nDuveyrier, “for their _savoir-vivre_ and their musical talent; they\r\nknow how to ride _mehari_ better than all their rivals. Secure in their\r\ncages, they can ride races with the most intrepid cavaliers, if one\r\nmay give this name to riders on dromedaries; in order, also, to keep\r\nthemselves in practice in this kind of riding, they meet to take short\r\ntrips together, going wherever they like without the escort of any\r\nman.”[526] Targui gallantry has preserved for the women of the tribe of\r\nImanan, who are descended from the ancient sultans, the title of royal\r\nwomen (_timanôkalîn_) on account of their beauty and their superiority\r\nin the art of music.\r\n\r\nThey often give concerts, to which the men come from long distances\r\ndecked out like male ostriches. In these concerts the women sing while\r\naccompanying themselves on the tambourine and a sort of violin or\r\nrebâza. They are much sought after in marriage, because of the title of\r\ncherif which they confer on their children.”[527]\r\n\r\nThe Targui lady often sings in the evenings, improvising and\r\naccompanying herself on the rebâza. If she is married, says Duveyrier,\r\nshe is honoured all the more in proportion to the number of her\r\nmasculine friends, but she must not show preference to any one of\r\nthem. The lady may embroider on the cloak, or write on the shield of\r\nher chevalier, verses in his praise and wishes for his good fortune.\r\nHer friend may, without being censured, cut the name of the lady on\r\nthe rocks or chant her virtues. “Friends of different sexes,” say the\r\nTouaregs, “are for the eyes and the heart, and not for the bed only, as\r\namong the Arabs.”[528]\r\n\r\nSuch customs as these indicate delicate instincts which are absolutely\r\nforeign to the Arabs and to the Kabyles. They strongly remind us of\r\nthe times of our southern troubadours, and of the _cours d’amour_,\r\nwhich were the quintessence of chivalry. But it is important to notice\r\nthat with the Touaregs, as with the Provençals and the Acquitainers\r\nof the twelfth century, who may well have had Berber ancestors, these\r\ndiversions and gallantries were for aristocrats and princes, and in no\r\nway prevented the general slavery of women. These customs are curious;\r\nthey show a degree of moral nobility, and are worthy of note, but at\r\nthe same time we must guard against according them a general value\r\nwhich they do not possess. It is important, also, to remark that the\r\nindependence of the Berber lady, who is saved the trouble of grinding\r\nthe corn, of cooking, etc., rests on the magic power of money. “By\r\nmeans of accumulation,” says Duveyrier, “the greatest part of the\r\nfortune is in the hands of women”--(p. 339). In short, it is only by an\r\nextraordinary power of illusion that we can recognise in the relatively\r\nfavourable situation of the Berber lady a case of Amazonian gynecocracy.\r\n\r\nIn Abyssinia, which also is not a gynecocratic country, the women\r\nenjoy very great liberty; their conduct is very dissolute, and their\r\nmarriage very easily broken. Bruce, who first made known to us these\r\ncurious customs, likens them to those of ancient Egypt. “In Abyssinia,”\r\nhe says, “the women live as if they were common to every one. They\r\npretend, however, to belong, by principle, to one man only when they\r\nmarry, but they do not act up to it.”[529] Divorce is so easy in\r\nAbyssinia that Bruce says he has seen a woman surrounded by seven\r\nformer husbands.[530] The most distinguished Abyssinian ladies have\r\ncicisbei, after the Italian fashion of old times. At their feasts,\r\naccording to Bruce again, the lovers yield themselves publicly to each\r\nother. Their neighbours at table simply take care to hide them very\r\nimperfectly by improvising with their cloaks a waving partition.[531]\r\nThe young women of the province of Samen, says Bruce, came alone to\r\ntrade with the travellers. “They were hard in their bargains, with the\r\nexception of one only, in which they seemed very reasonable and very\r\ngenerous. They agreed to give rather than sell their favours, alleging\r\nthat long solicitations on one side and refusals on the other wasted\r\ntime that might be more agreeably employed.”[532] It is clear from this\r\nthat the monogamic _régime_ of the Abyssinians is more apparent than\r\nreal, that it is much modified by the extreme cicisbeism, by the use of\r\nconcubines, of which I have already spoken, and lastly by the abuse of\r\ndivorce, turning it into a successive polygamy.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Monogamy among the Mongols of Asia._\r\n\r\nAmong the Asiatic Mongols monogamy is also not very strict. In Thibetan\r\nHimalaya polyandry seems to predominate. It is not rare, either, in\r\nThibet proper, where, on the other hand, polygamy is not forbidden,\r\nfor there is no rigid legislation in regard to marriage. Besides, in\r\nthese countries, as in many others, girls enjoy complete liberty before\r\nmarriage, and they use it without suffering at all in reputation.[533]\r\n\r\nIt is singular that in Lamaïc Thibet, in full theocracy, in a country\r\nwhere the prayers and the practices of religion enter into nearly\r\nall the actions of civil life, marriage escapes all ecclesiastical\r\ninterference. In fact, the priests have nothing to do with it, and\r\nall the matrimonial ceremony, which is purely laïc, consists in a\r\nsimple mutual engagement entered into by the interested parties before\r\nwitnesses.[534]\r\n\r\nThis laïc anarchy of marriage in Thibet must no doubt be attributed\r\nto Lamaïc bigotry itself. The Lamas avoid women, holding marriage in\r\ncontempt, and all the great functionaries, as well as many Thibetans\r\nof the other classes, are of the same opinion.[535] Religion does not\r\nconcern herself with it; she disdains it, as in Egypt, which seems to\r\nshow that a sufficient degree of religious madness hinders theocratic\r\nlegislators from thinking of civil institutions.\r\n\r\nBut in regard to marriage, both civil and religious laws are always\r\nsubordinate to the necessities resulting from the social condition and\r\nthe proportion of the sexes. In Thibet, therefore, in spite of the\r\nentire liberty allowed to individuals, the marriage of the greatest\r\nnumber is monogamic quite as much as if the law had prescribed it.[536]\r\n\r\nIn Tartary the nomad Mongols have adopted for their matrimonial type\r\nmonogamy tempered by the domestic concubinate. I have spoken previously\r\nof their “lesser wives,” of their marriage by purchase with the\r\nceremonial of capture. I need not, therefore, repeat all this. I will\r\nonly note in passing that their girls have also very loose manners,\r\nwhich are not always corrected by marriage.[537] According to one of\r\nthe most recent explorers of Mongolia, the proportion of the sexes in\r\nthat country is the inverse of that in Europe. The women are much less\r\nnumerous than the men. This may probably be the principal reason of the\r\ncelibacy of the Lamas, and of the real monogamy of the greater number\r\nof laymen who do not belong to the aristocracy.[538]\r\n\r\nChinese marriage essentially resembles Mongol marriage, but with a more\r\nsettled ritual and a more uniform legislation. It is also monogamic,\r\nwith the palliative of the concubinate, the “lesser wives” of whom I\r\nhave already spoken.[539] Besides this, the subjection of women in\r\nChina is extreme. When a Chinaman has only daughters he is said to\r\nhave no children.[540] The Chinese woman is submissive in all states,\r\nas a daughter to her parents, as a wife to her husband, and as a widow\r\nto her sons, especially to her eldest son.[541] (Pauthier, _Chine\r\nModerne_, p. 239). The young Chinese girl has not even an idea that\r\nshe may be consulted in the choice of a husband.[542] She is bought\r\nfrom her parents, and a part of the sum agreed on is paid when the\r\ncontract is signed.[543] As in Mongolia, matrimonial arrangements\r\nare often settled, not only from the infancy of the future wife and\r\nhusband, but even before their birth, on the hypothesis of a difference\r\nof sex.[544] These agreements are made by the fathers and mothers, or,\r\nin default of them, by the grandparents or nearest relatives.[545]\r\nLastly, the women are excluded by law from inheritance,[546] and kept\r\nas much as possible in seclusion, so that they scarcely see any one\r\nbesides their parents.[547] By marrying, the young Chinese girl simply\r\nchanges masters. “The bride,” says a Chinese author, “ought only to be\r\na shadow and an echo in the house.” The married woman eats neither with\r\nher husband nor with her male children; she waits at table in silence,\r\nlights the pipes, must be content with the coarsest food, and has not\r\neven the right to touch what her son leaves.[548]\r\n\r\nChina is a country of very ancient civilisation, where the laws and\r\nrites have regulated everything, and consequently there exists a whole\r\nlegislation with regard to marriage.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, conjugal union is forbidden between persons having the\r\nsame family name,[549] and I shall have to return to this circumstance.\r\n\r\nAs in ancient Rome, the law prohibits marriage between slaves and free\r\npersons.[550] It absolutely forbids marriage to the priests of _Fo_,\r\nand to those of the _tao_ sect.[551] It orders public functionaries\r\nnot to contract marriage with actresses, comedians, or musicians.[552]\r\nIt seems that in ancient times, in China as in Greco-Latin antiquity,\r\nthe father had the excessive right to unmarry his daughter, for to\r\nremedy this abuse the Chinese law pronounces the punishment of a\r\nhundred strokes of bamboo on the father-in-law who should send away\r\nhis son-in-law in order to re-marry his daughter to another.[553] The\r\nChinese widow, no longer belonging to her original family, but to the\r\nfamily of her husband, can be re-married by the latter.[554] Moreover,\r\nthe contract of betrothal concluded between the parents having a legal\r\nvalue, the family of the betrothed man who dies before the conclusion\r\nof the marriage has the right to marry the bereaved _fiancée_, or false\r\nwidow,[555] who, by-the-bye, is much honoured when she has the courage\r\nto devote herself to a celibate life.[556]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Chinese women are excluded from inheritance; they\r\nhave a right, however, in marrying, to a small dowry, either in money\r\nor furniture, but the value of it is optional. It must be at least\r\na chest of drawers or a small _trousseau_, which the bridegroom is\r\nobliged to supply if the parents fail to do so. Moreover, he must\r\nalso give the nuptial bed.[557] Primitive and even cruel as are the\r\nconditions and rules of Chinese marriage, the Chinese women submit to\r\nthem not only without murmuring, but with a sort of devotion, broken\r\nin as they are by a long ancestral education. And besides, for the\r\nChinese in general, it is a strict duty to marry, from a triple point\r\nof view--social, political, and religious. Everybody marries in the\r\nCelestial Empire, and the number of male celibates over twenty-four\r\nyears of age is quite insignificant. If a suitable opportunity of\r\nmarriage does not present itself, the parents, who are sovereign\r\narbiters in this matter, do not hesitate to go to an orphanage to seek\r\na son or daughter-in-law.[558]\r\n\r\nIn Japan, during the feudal age, the end of which we are now\r\nwitnessing, marriage was nearly identical with Chinese marriage, and\r\nthere would be nothing to say about it in particular, if during the\r\nlast few years the fever of reformation, with which Japan is carried\r\naway, had not happily modified marriage, at least in practice, by\r\ngiving the young girl a voice in the matter,[559] and by awakening in\r\nsome Japanese consciences doubts on the subject of the prostitution\r\nof young girls. At the present moment, everything in Japan is being\r\nEuropeanised, and the adaptation of our Civil Code to the old Japanese\r\ncustoms is only a question of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _Monogamy and Civilisation._\r\n\r\nThe foregoing facts are sufficiently numerous to enable us to deduce\r\ncertain conclusions from them. These facts, taken as they are from\r\nnearly all the non-Aryan races, prove in the first place that the\r\nmonogamic _régime_ is in no way the appanage of the superior races,\r\nfor among the lowest of human races some are monogamic. In regard to\r\nmarriage, we find that primordial conditions impose the various forms\r\nof sexual union, quite independently of the caprice of individuals, or\r\nof the degree of culture and social development.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to estimate the moral worth of a people, a race, or a\r\ncivilisation, we are much more enlightened by the position given to\r\nwoman than by the legal type of the conjugal union. This type, besides,\r\nis usually more apparent than real. In many civilisations, both dead\r\nand living, legal monogamy has for its chief object the regulation\r\nof succession and the division of property. With much _naïveté_ and\r\neffrontery, many legislators have sanctioned polygamy in reality by\r\nrecognising the domestic concubinate by the side of legal monogamy. As\r\nfor the position of the wife who is reputed to be specially legitimate,\r\nit is often much inferior to that enjoyed by the woman who lives under\r\nother conjugal _régimes_ which are theoretically less elevated. In the\r\ngreater number of countries more or less monogamic, which I have just\r\npassed in review, woman, whether married or not, has been subjected to\r\nextreme subordination. In an exceptional case she acquires a certain\r\nindependence, where, thanks to maternal inheritance, she can become\r\npossessed of personal or real estate. It is to money alone, and not to\r\nthe moralising influence of monogamy, that woman in barbarous countries\r\nowes the power of attaining a certain independence, for the two peoples\r\nwho have granted it to her, the Egyptians in antiquity and the Touaregs\r\nof our own day, lived or live under a legislation which authorises\r\npolygamy. It is important also to notice that in the valley of the\r\nNile, and in the Sahara, feminine emancipation is only the privilege of\r\nthose women who belong to the ruling and propertied classes.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, in every country and in every time, woman, organically\r\nweaker than man, has been more or less enslaved by him, unless in the\r\ncase where legislation has allowed her to use an artificial force to\r\nserve her as a shield. This fictitious force, before which virile\r\nbrutality has lowered its flag, has been money, wherever the laws\r\nregulating succession have permitted women to raise themselves to the\r\ndignity of proprietors.\r\n\r\nA similar lesson will be given us by the study of the monogamic\r\n_régime_ among the white races of Asia and of Europe. There also\r\nwe shall see riches serve woman as a defensive, and sometimes even\r\noffensive weapon, against the severity of laws and customs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[499] Herbert Spencer, _Sociology_, vol. ii. p. 301.\r\n\r\n[500] _Id., ibid._ vol. ii. pp. 301, 302.\r\n\r\n[501] _Das Mutterrecht._\r\n\r\n[502] _Das Mutterrecht._\r\n\r\n[503] Spencer, _Sociology_, vol. ii. p. 299.\r\n\r\n[504] Fison and Howitt, _Kamilaroi and Kurnai_.\r\n\r\n[505] Dalton, _Ethnology of Bengal_, p. 41.\r\n\r\n[506] _Id., ibid._ p. 132.\r\n\r\n[507] _Id., ibid._ p. 28.\r\n\r\n[508] Doménech, _Voyage Pittoresque dans les Déserts du Nouveau Monde_,\r\np. 510.\r\n\r\n[509] Bancroft, _Native Races_, etc., vol. ii. p. 661.\r\n\r\n[510] Mollien, _Hist.

Nothing can be more beautiful than\r\nthe union of two intelligent and refined beings freely associating\r\ntheir lives after ripe reflection “for better, for worse,” as the\r\nmarriage service of England has it. But the reality is often very\r\ndifferent from this poetic ideal. Even amongst the most highly\r\ncivilised peoples, this spontaneous, disinterested, devoted union,\r\nbased on moral and intellectual sympathies, is very rare; it does not\r\nexist in civilisations still partly barbarous, whose monogamy easily\r\naccommodates itself to the subjection of women, however extreme. We\r\nshall see that it is so, in studying this matrimonial type amongst\r\nthe Hebrews at first, and afterwards amongst the Aryan races, that is\r\nto say, amongst the human types which are reputed _par excellence_\r\nSuperior.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Hebrew Marriage._\r\n\r\nThe Hebrews seem to have been alone among the Semites in adopting\r\nmonogamy, at least in general practice. Moreover, the Bible tells us\r\nthat concubinage was not forbidden to God’s chosen people. In speaking\r\nof the daughter sold by her father to a rich man, the book of Exodus\r\nused language sufficiently explicit on this point--“If she please not\r\nher master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her\r\nbe redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power.\r\nAnd if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after\r\nthe manner of daughters. But if he take to him another wife, her food,\r\nher raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.”[560] The\r\nbook of Genesis indeed tells us that “a man shall leave his father and\r\nmother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they twain shall be one\r\nflesh;”[561] but this famous verse seems to indicate the violence of\r\nthe love rather than monogamic and indissoluble marriage.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the subjection of the Jewish woman was not extreme, as it is\r\nin Kabyle; it was, however, very great. Her consent to marriage was\r\nnecessary, it is true, when she had reached majority, but she was all\r\nthe same sold to her husband. We must note, nevertheless, that she had\r\na recognised right of ownership, and that the property of the husband\r\nwas security for that of the wife and for her dowry; but the husband\r\nnone the less held the wife in strict dependence. The song of the\r\nvirtuous woman at the end of Proverbs is generally quoted as a sublime\r\nportrait of the Jewish wife by all those who are still hypnotised by\r\nthe prestige of the so-called holy books. However, in reading these\r\ncelebrated verses with an unprejudiced mind, we hardly find more\r\nthan the portrait of a laborious servant, busy and grasping--“She\r\nseeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.... She\r\nriseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a\r\nportion to her maidens. She considereth a field, and buyeth it; with\r\nthe fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth her loins\r\nwith strength, and strengtheneth her arms.... Her candle goeth not\r\nout by night.... She eateth not the bread of idleness.” We shall see\r\nlater that the wife, though she might gain much money, which seems to\r\nhave been the ideal of the Hebrew husband according to the Proverbs,\r\nwas repudiable at will, with no other reason than the caprice of the\r\nmaster who had bought her. Finally, and this is much more severe, she\r\nwas always obliged to be able to prove, cloths in hand, that she was\r\na virgin at the moment of her marriage, and this under pain of being\r\nstoned. Let us listen to the sacred book--“If any man take a wife, and\r\ngo in unto her, and hate her ...” and seeking a pretext to repudiate\r\nher, he imputes to her a shameful crime, saying, “I took this woman,\r\nand when I came to her, I found her not a maid ... her father and\r\nmother shall take her and shall represent to the elders of the city\r\nin the gate the tokens of the damsel’s virginity.” Of what kind were\r\nthese proofs? The following verses tell us, “They shall spread the\r\ncloth before the elders of the city. And the elders of that city shall\r\ntake that man and chastise him, and they shall amerce him in an hundred\r\nshekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel.... But\r\nif this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for\r\nthe damsel, then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her\r\nfather’s house, and the men of the city shall stone her with stones\r\nthat she die; because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the\r\nwhore in her father’s house; so shalt thou put evil away from among\r\nyou.”[562] If we add to the preceding, that by the law of levirate,\r\nthe childless widow, whether she wished or not, was awarded to her\r\nbrother-in-law, we shall be enlightened as to the unenviable position\r\nof the married woman under the Hebrew law.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Marriage in Persia and Ancient India._\r\n\r\nOf the conjugal customs of the ancient Persians we know little. The\r\nonly formal prescription that we find in the Avesta is a strict\r\nprohibition against marrying an infidel. The Mazdean who commits such\r\na crime troubles the whole universe: “he changes to mud a third of the\r\nrivers that rush down the mountain sides; he withers a third of the\r\ngrowth of trees and of herbs which cover the earth; he takes from pure\r\nmen a third of their good thoughts, of their good words, of their good\r\nactions; he is more noxious than serpents and wolves.”[563]\r\n\r\nOn Indian marriage we are better informed, at first by the Code\r\nof Manu, and then by modern travellers. India has early practised\r\nmitigated monogamy. Polygamy and concubinage were the privilege of the\r\nBrahmins and rich Kchatriyas; but the mass of the nation generally\r\nlived in monogamy, though nevertheless imposing on the married woman\r\na most humiliating position. Manu proclaims aloud the necessary\r\ndependence and incurable inferiority of the weaker sex: “If women\r\nwere not guarded, they would bring misfortune to two families.” “Manu\r\nhas bestowed on women the love of their bed, of their seat, and of\r\nadornment, concupiscence, anger, bad inclinations, the desire to do\r\nevil, perversity.”[564] “A little girl, a young woman, and an old\r\nwoman ought never to do anything of their own will, even in their own\r\nhouse.” “During her childhood a woman depends on her father; during\r\nher youth, on her husband; her husband being dead, on her sons; if she\r\nhas no sons, on the near relatives of her husband; or in default of\r\nthem, on those of her father; if she has no paternal relatives, on the\r\nsovereign. A woman ought never to have her own way.”[565]\r\n\r\nGiven such an utter subordination of woman, it is self-evident that\r\nthere would be no question of her choosing a husband. It is the\r\nfather’s duty to marry his daughter; and he need not wait till she\r\nhas reached puberty: “A father must give his daughter in marriage to\r\na young man of agreeable appearance, and of the same rank, according\r\nto the law, although she may not have attained the age of eight years,\r\nat which he ought to marry her.”[566] However, if the father neglects\r\nthe prime duty of marrying his daughter, the law ordains that the\r\nlatter shall proceed to do it. Marriage is a sacred duty: “Let a girl,\r\nalthough adult, wait three years; but after that period, let her choose\r\na husband of the same rank as herself.”[567] The girl is then free, and\r\nher husband in marrying her owes no payment to the father: “The father\r\nhas lost all authority over his daughter in delaying for her the time\r\nof becoming a mother.”[568] Girls cannot be married too soon; at eight\r\nyears old they are given a husband of twenty-eight; at twelve years, a\r\nman of thirty.[569] Some verses, in contradiction to that which I have\r\njust now quoted, forbid the father from receiving any gratuity whatever\r\nin marrying his daughter, not even a cow or a bull: “All gratuity,\r\nsmall or large, constitutes a sale.”[570] But the prohibition to sell\r\nhis daughter, though still very little observed, is evidently of\r\nposterior date; and in India, as in all other countries, the daughter\r\nhas been esteemed at first as merchandise. The law imposes at times\r\nvery curious restrictions on a man who is intending to marry. He must\r\nnot take a girl with red hair, or bearing the name of a constellation,\r\nof a river, a bird, or a serpent.[571] He must not, under pain of hell,\r\nmarry before his elder brother.[572] Above all, he must not marry below\r\nhis rank. To marry a woman belonging to the servile class is, for the\r\nBrahmin or the Kchatriya, an enormous crime, which lowers him to the\r\nrank of the Soudras.[573] It is an unpardonable sin: “For him who\r\ndrinks the foam of the lips of a Soudra, or who has a child by her,\r\nthere is no expiation declared by the law.”[574] He descends to the\r\ninfernal abode, and his son loses caste. As for the son of a Brahmanic\r\nwoman and a Soudra, he is a Tchandala, the vilest of mortals.[575] The\r\nyoung Brahmin, after having received the authorisation of his spiritual\r\ndirector, and having purified himself by a bath, must marry a woman of\r\nhis own class, who is well made, who has a fine down over her body,\r\nfine hair, small teeth, limbs of a charming sweetness, and the graceful\r\nmovement of a swan or a young elephant.[576] But, however the wife may\r\nbe chosen, she is held in a state of servile submission. “A wife,” says\r\nthe Code, “can never be set free from the authority of her husband;\r\nneither by sale nor by desertion.” “Once only a young girl is given in\r\nmarriage; once only the father says, I give her.”[577]\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, these antique precepts are still observed in India.\r\nIn general, monogamy prevails, but the married woman is none the less\r\nkept in a state of abject subjection. It is shameful, says Somerset,\r\nfor a virtuous woman to know how to read and dance; these futile\r\naccomplishments are left to the bayadere. “Servant, slave,” are the\r\nhabitual appellations used by the husband in addressing his wife,\r\nwho replies by saying “Master, lord,” who must take care not to call\r\nher husband by his name,[578] and has not the right to sit at his\r\ntable.[579] It is the parents who negotiate the marriage, without any\r\nregard to the tastes of the future husband and wife, and thinking only\r\nof rank and fortune.[580] A daughter is always married, or rather sold,\r\nin infancy, often to a sexagenarian Brahmin, and before she is of age\r\nto manifest any preference.[581]\r\n\r\nThese accounts, which are as authentic as possible, enable us to\r\nestimate the Hindoo marriage. However monogamic it may generally be,\r\nit is very inferior from a moral point of view. The tyrannical right\r\nleft to the husband, his unlimited power, the servitude of the wife,\r\nyielded or negotiated in infancy, the pride of caste and the care for\r\nwealth outweighing all other considerations, proclaim loudly enough\r\nthat matrimonial legislation in India has been the regulation, for the\r\nman’s profit only, of instincts of a very low order.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Marriage in Ancient Greece._\r\n\r\nIn primitive Greece the position of woman was little better. On one\r\nhand, the _Iliad_ tells us that the epithet “woman” thrown at a man\r\nwas the most contemptuous insult;[582] on the other hand, we have seen\r\nthat the girl was purchased by the husband, either by presents or by\r\nservices rendered to the father;[583] in short, that the husband might\r\nhave domestic concubines with the sole reservation that their children\r\ndid not inherit from him.[584] In the first chant of the _Odyssey_ the\r\nsevere apostrophe of Telemachus to his mother proves also that in the\r\nabsence of the husband the wife was humbly submissive to her sons. “Go\r\nto thy chamber; attend to thy work; turn the spinning wheel; weave the\r\nlinen; see that thy servants do their tasks. Speech belongs to men,\r\nand especially to me, who am the master here.”[585] Penelope, like a\r\nwell-trained woman, meekly allows herself to be silenced and obeys,\r\n“bearing in her mind the sage discourse of her son.”\r\n\r\nIn later times the virtuous woman was shut up in the gyneceum, where\r\nshe could only receive her parents or the friends authorised by her\r\nhusband.[586] She was not even admitted to festivities. But, while\r\nthe wife was semi-cloistered in the conjugal house, the husband could\r\nat will frequent and court the hetaïræ (ἑταίραι), and the strangers\r\n(ξέναι) with whom the citizens of Athens had not the _jus connubii_,\r\nand who were not admitted like the well-born or native Athenian woman\r\n(ελευθέρα) to the thesmophors.[587]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that at Athens primitive marriage was regulated by the\r\nman with very little heed to the tastes or preferences of the woman.\r\nAt Sparta it was the sentiment of strict and zealous patriotism\r\nwhich inspired Lycurgus in all his regulations regarding marriage.\r\nThe obligation of marriage was legal, like the military service. The\r\nyoung men were attracted to it by making them assist at the gymnastic\r\nexercises of naked young girls. “This was an incentive to marriage,\r\nand, to use Plato’s expression, drew them almost as necessarily by\r\nthe attraction of love as a geometrical conclusion is drawn from the\r\npremises.”[588] In the supreme interest of population, love was forced\r\non young men, but it was for the sake of fertility. The young married\r\ncouple were not allowed to meet except in secret until the first\r\npregnancy.[589] It was praiseworthy for an old husband to lend his\r\nyoung wife to a handsome young man, by whom she might have a child.\r\n\r\nIn our own day it is not very rare, particularly in France, to see poor\r\nyoung men marry rich old women. Solon did not permit this conjugal\r\nprostitution of man at Athens. “A censor,” says Plutarch, “finding\r\na young man in the house of a rich old woman, fattening as they say\r\na partridge fattens by his services to the female, would remove him\r\nto some young girl who wanted a husband.”[590] At Sparta Lycurgus\r\nwent as far as to put hardened celibates under the ban of society. In\r\nthe first place, they were not permitted to see these exercises of\r\nthe naked virgins; and the magistrates commanded them to march naked\r\nround the market-place in winter, and to sing a song composed against\r\nthemselves.... They were also deprived of that honour and respect which\r\nthe young pay to the old.[591]\r\n\r\nThe young Greek girl could not dispose of her person any more than\r\nthe Chinese or Hindoo woman could. She was married by her father; in\r\ndefault of her father, by her brother of the same blood; in default of\r\na brother, by a paternal grandfather.[592] The right of brothers who\r\nwere heirs to their father to marry their sister was not even exhausted\r\nby a first marriage.[593] The father of the family had the power either\r\nto marry his daughter during his lifetime, or to bequeath her by will,\r\nas well as her mother, who was assimilated, like her, to chattels or\r\nproperty. “Demosthenes, my father, bequeathed his fortune, which was\r\nfourteen talents, myself, aged seven years, my sister, aged five years,\r\nand our mother. At the moment of dying, when asked what he would have\r\ndone with us, he bequeathed _all these things_ to this Aphobus and to\r\nDemophontes, his nephews; he married my sister to Demophontes, and gave\r\nat once two talents.”[594] “In the same way,” says Demosthenes again,\r\n“Pasion dying, bequeathed his wife to Phormion.”[595] It might happen\r\nthat the daughter or the wife were by law one body with the estate.\r\nThus a daughter, in default of male heirs, belonged to the relation who\r\nwould have inherited in her stead and place, if she had not lived.\r\n\r\nIf there were several relatives in the same degree of succession,\r\nthe daughter was to marry the eldest of them. Further still, she was\r\nobliged in this case to quit her husband, if previously, and even with\r\npaternal authorisation, she had contracted marriage.[596] In Greece, to\r\nsafeguard or conquer her independence, a woman had no other resources\r\nthan the seduction of her sex and the love she could inspire. She\r\nhad early recourse to these defensive weapons, for Aristotle thinks\r\nit his duty to put young men on guard against the excess of conjugal\r\ntenderness and feminine tyranny, the habit which enchains the man to\r\nhis wife.[597] At length in Greece, as it had happened in Egypt, money\r\nfinished by protecting the woman much more efficaciously, and even by\r\ngiving her sometimes the advantage on the conjugal field of battle.\r\nSolon, who knew Egypt, began by decreeing the absolute poverty of\r\nthe married woman. “The bride was to bring with her only three suits\r\nof clothes, and some household stuff of small value, for he wished\r\nmarriages to be made without mercenary or venal views, and would have\r\nthat union cemented by love and friendship, and not by money.”[598] But\r\nthis primitive legislation could not stand against the combined action\r\nof the affection of the girl’s parents, her own desire of independence,\r\nand lastly, the cupidity of the husband, and thus the practice of\r\nthe dowry became general. This dowry was constituted before marriage\r\nby a public act.[599] Securities and bonds were given to assure the\r\ndowry and the conditions of marriage. The dowry was mortgaged on the\r\nhusband’s property, and returned to the wife on the dissolution of the\r\nmarriage. When the woman could shelter herself behind the shield of the\r\ndowry she was much more respected, and she even sometimes tyrannised in\r\nher turn. Aristophanes, Menander, Lucian, etc., pour out endless bitter\r\ncriticisms on the haughty and extravagant rich woman.\r\n\r\nIn the comedy of _The Clouds_ the good Strepsiades cries: “I led so\r\nhappily in the country a good simple life, without vexation or care,\r\nrich in bees, in sheep, and in olives! Then I married the niece of\r\nMegacles, son of Megacles. I was of the country, she of the town; she\r\nwas a haughty, extravagant woman, a true Cesyra. The wedding day,\r\nwhen I lay down by her, I smelt the wine, the cheese, and the wool;\r\nshe cares for perfumes, saffron, tender kisses, expense, good cheer,\r\nand wanton transports. I will not say that she was idle--no--she\r\nworked hard at ruining me.” According to Menander, religion served\r\nas an excuse to women for enormous expenses. Under the pretext of\r\npiety they ruined their husbands by religious sacrifices accompanied\r\nwith perfumes, with golden clasps for the sandals, and female slaves\r\nceremoniously ranged in a circle.[600]\r\n\r\nOne poor hen-pecked husband groans in these terms: “Cursed be the first\r\nman who invented marriage, and then the second, and the third, and the\r\nfourth, and all those who imitated them.” One old husband laments: “I\r\nhave married a witch with a dowry. I took her, to have her fields and\r\nhouse, and that, O Apollo, is the worst of evils.”[601] Listen again to\r\nthis one: “If being poor, you marry a rich woman, you give yourself a\r\nmistress and not a wife; you reduce yourself to be at the same time a\r\nslave and poor”--(Anaxandrides).[602]\r\n\r\nTo sum up, in ancient Greece marriage implied at first the complete\r\nslavery of the wife, who was treated as a thing; then by degrees\r\nconjugal customs were mitigated, and the wife became a person, and\r\neven a proprietor, whom her dowry or personal fortune could protect.\r\nThenceforward money produced its usual effect on inferior characters:\r\nit debased or infatuated individuals who were without moral nobility;\r\ncupidity blinded certain men; the insolence of money intoxicated\r\ncertain women. But this only occurred among the ruling classes, and the\r\nfate of husbands reduced to conjugal servitude by love of a large dowry\r\ndoes not concern us here.\r\n\r\nThe important feature in Greek marriage is, that the first legislators\r\nregarded it solely from the point of view of increase of population,\r\nand held individual liberty, especially that of the woman, very\r\ncheaply. Whatever we may think of this legal tyranny, it attained\r\nits end perfectly. The small republics of ancient Greece overflowed\r\nwith men; thus Attica had four thousand one hundred and sixty-six\r\ninhabitants to the square league--that is to say, the population was\r\nthree times more dense than that of France at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Marriage in Ancient Rome._\r\n\r\nIn its general features Roman marriage does not greatly differ from\r\nGreek, but its evolution has been more complete, and the legislation on\r\nthe subject is better known to us. Marriages of children, especially\r\nof little girls, were the rule at Rome, since the nuptial majority of\r\ngirls was fixed at twelve years. But they were often betrothed, and\r\neven married, before that age. Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of Agrippa\r\nand of Pomponia, was promised to Tiberius from her first year.[603] The\r\n_Digest_ authorised betrothal at the age of seven.[604]\r\n\r\nIn betrothing his daughter the father contracted a civil obligation,\r\nsanctioned at first by an action for damages, and later by infamy.\r\nEvery woman of twenty, if she was neither married nor a mother,\r\nincurred the punishment decreed by Augustus against celibacy and\r\nchildlessness.[605] We are indeed told in Roman legislation that the\r\nconsent of the girl was necessary before passing finally to betrothal\r\nand marriage. But it is evident that the consent of a child of twelve\r\nyears, or even less, was illusory; in reality, the young Roman girl was\r\nmarried by her parents.[606] The young wife was still such a child,\r\nthat on the day of her wedding she took a ceremonious leave of her\r\nplaythings and dolls, offering them up to the gods. In reality, it was\r\nnot the wife who made the engagement, but the persons in whose power\r\nshe found herself.[607]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Roman customs conceded to women a certain liberty of\r\nmanners which the Greeks would not have tolerated. The Roman woman\r\nwalked in the streets, went to the theatre with the men, shared in\r\nbanquets, etc.; yet she was, especially in primitive Rome, subjected\r\nfirst to her father and then to her husband. And, besides, public\r\nopinion obliged the woman to use in great moderation the practical\r\nliberty that was left to her. The famous epitaph of the Roman\r\nmatron--_domum mansit; lanam fecit_--is well known. This epitaph may\r\nperhaps exaggerate, but it does not lie. Thus Suetonius tells us that\r\nthe daughters and grand-daughters of Augustus were compelled to weave\r\nand spin, and that the Emperor usually wore no other garments but those\r\nmade by the hands of his wife and sister.[608]\r\n\r\nLegally, the Roman wife was the property of her husband, who treated\r\nher, not as his equal, but as his child. At Rome, also, conjugal union\r\nhad been looked at chiefly from the point of view of procreation\r\n(_Liberorum quærendorum causâ_). The wife who was the mother of three\r\nchildren acquired a certain independence; she could make a will even\r\nduring the lifetime of her husband, and did not need to have recourse\r\nto a trustee.[609] But the subjection of woman was very great. The\r\nfather, invested with the _potestas_, could sell his child to a third\r\nparty, _in mancipium_. The _mancipium_, which was almost a right of\r\npropriety, passed afterwards to the heirs of the owner.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the _pater familias_ had the right to marry his\r\ndaughter without consulting her, but he enjoyed a right more excessive\r\nstill, that of re-marrying her when his son-in-law had been absent\r\nfor three years.[610] It was Antoninus only who thought of depriving\r\nthe father of his right to annul the marriage of his daughter. To the\r\n_potestas_ of the father succeeded the _manus_ of the husband. The\r\nwoman _in manu_ was considered legally as the daughter of her husband,\r\nand therefore as the sister of her children. If the husband was himself\r\nthe son of a family, the wife _in manu_ was held as grand-daughter\r\nof the father of the family. This entailed for her the extinction of\r\npaternal power (on her own side), and of guardianship and the rights\r\nof relationship with the male members of her father’s family. In the\r\nmarriage with _manus_ the husband became the proprietor of all the\r\ndowry of his wife. The father, however, could stipulate that the dowry\r\nshould be returned to him if his daughter died without children or was\r\nrepudiated. The _leges Julia_ and _Papia_ had, in fact, imposed on the\r\nfather the obligation of giving a dowry to his daughter; but the dowry\r\ncould be appointed by third parties or by the woman herself, if she\r\nwas _sui juris_, and then also she had the right to stipulate for some\r\nreservations.\r\n\r\nThis terrible right of _manus_ was acquired by the husband with every\r\nform of marriage, even the grossest of all, the _usus_, or simple\r\ncohabitation during one year; but the wife could avoid the _conventio\r\nin manum_ by passing three nights in the year out of the conjugal\r\ndomicile. The _manus_ invested the husband with a large right of\r\ncorrection over his wife, though in very grave cases he was to assemble\r\nthe family tribunal, which included the children of cousins-german.\r\nThese family tribunals took cognisance even of murder committed by\r\nthe wife, and they were still in use under the emperors.[611] On the\r\nother hand, the Roman husbands did not let their legal right of beating\r\ntheir wives fall into desuetude, for Saint Monica consoled the wives\r\nof her acquaintance whose faces showed marks of marital brutality,\r\nby saying to them: “Take care to control your tongues.... It is the\r\nduty of servants to obey their masters.... You have made a contract of\r\nservitude.”[612]\r\n\r\nThere were at Rome three kinds of marriages, which I have already\r\nnamed--1st, The _usus_, resulting from a simple continuous\r\ncohabitation, without contract or ceremony, a sort of Tahitian\r\nmarriage; 2nd, the _coemptio_ or purchase, of which I have spoken at\r\nlength--that is to say, the legal regulation of the primitive marriage\r\nby purchase, in use all over the world at the origin of civilisations.\r\nCoemption, without any palliatives, delivered the wife’s body and goods\r\nto her husband; 3rd, the _confarreatio_, or aristocratic marriage,\r\nin which the high Pontiff of Jupiter gave, in the presence of ten\r\nwitnesses, a cake made of flour, water, and salt to the bride and\r\nbridegroom, who ate it between them. The _manus_ was conferred on the\r\nhusband in the marriage by confarreation, the same as in the marriage\r\nby _usus_ and _coemptio_. We must note that at Rome, as in Greece, the\r\nreligious ceremony was in no way essential to the marriage, which was a\r\nlaic and civil institution in the first place.[613]\r\n\r\nThese three forms of marriage very probably represent the evolution of\r\nthe conjugal union in ancient Rome. The _usus_, or free cohabitation,\r\nmust have been the commencement; then came the purchase of the wife,\r\nthe _coemptio_, and at length the solemn marriage or _confarreatio_\r\nof the patricians. But marriage with the husband’s right of _manus_\r\nsubsisted for a long time, and it conferred on him all the customary\r\nlicence of savages of every country, notably that of lending the wife,\r\nand this exorbitant right endured till the best days of Rome, since the\r\nvirtuous Cato of Utica used it still in lending his wife Martia to his\r\nfriend Hortensius.\r\n\r\nThis fact is curious, and deserves attention. Hortensius began by\r\nasking for the loan of Cato’s daughter, Portia, already married to\r\nBibulus, and the mother of two children. It was, says Plutarch, with\r\nthe object of selection, that he might have a child of good race; he\r\npromised to return her afterwards to her husband. On the refusal of\r\nCato, Hortensius fell back on Martia, Cato’s own wife, who was at the\r\ntime _enceinte_. Cato was not at all shocked at the proposition,\r\nbut referred it, however, to Philip, his father-in-law, who also\r\nsaw no harm in it. A contract was therefore concluded between Cato,\r\nHortensius, and Philip; and Martia, whom no one thought of consulting,\r\nwas yielded to Hortensius, and afterwards taken back, at the death of\r\nthe latter, by Cato. She was then the heir of Hortensius, and Cato had\r\nnot the least scruple in receiving her back with her money at the same\r\ntime.[614]\r\n\r\nTo any one not versed in ethnographical sociology these customs seem\r\nimprobable. Doubt has been cast on this story of Hortensius and Cato,\r\nthough it is attested by the _Anti-Cato_ of Julius Cæsar, on which\r\nPlutarch relies; but it has nothing extraordinary for us. We know that\r\nat first woman was everywhere the absolute property of the man. The\r\n_manus_ of the Roman husband was in the main only an attenuated form\r\nof primitive conjugal right, which we know included the power to lend,\r\nbarter, or cede the wife without consulting her. The case of Cato is\r\nthen only a survival of preceding ages.\r\n\r\nNecessarily brief and incomplete as the _résumé_ must be that I can\r\nhere give of conjugal legislation at Rome, it will suffice, I hope, to\r\ngive a clear idea of what Roman marriage was. I should add that the\r\nlaw, inspired by the old patriotic spirit and the prejudices of caste,\r\nlimited the right of marriage, the _jus connubii_. The _justes noces_\r\nwere at first an aristocratic privilege. The plebeians coupled _more\r\nferarum_. At length the _jus connubii_ extended to marriages between\r\nLatin and Roman, Latin and Latin, and even foreigner and foreigner.\r\nThe child followed the condition of the mother, which seems to be a\r\nsurvival of the ancient maternal family. Another vestige of the same\r\nkind is found in the legal position of _spurii_--that is to say, of\r\nchildren born of a marriage which is either prohibited or incestuous or\r\nbigamous. These children, irregularly conceived, have a mother, but no\r\nlegal father; they do not come under the paternal power of the father,\r\nlike the child of lawful marriage, and cannot be legitimated.[615]\r\n\r\nThe study of the transformations that Roman marriage underwent from\r\nthe time of Numa to that of the emperors is most interesting; for we\r\ncan follow a complete evolution in regard to it which has never been\r\nso complete in any other country. At first we find conjugal anarchy,\r\nthe capricious union or _usus_, which could be, and which was in fact,\r\noften polygamous, as the ulterior persistence of the concubinate\r\nproves; then the marriage by capture, of which the trace remained in\r\nthe marriage ceremony; then the marriage by purchase, the coemptio,\r\nwith its ordinary consequence, the servitude of the wife, which even\r\nthe solemn marriage or confarreation did not abolish. At length this\r\nbrutal law of the primitive ages relaxes. The law which holds the\r\nwoman under paternal power (_patria potestas_) is turned round. The\r\nfather himself gives his daughter _in mancipium_ to a third party, who\r\nafterwards enfranchises her. Sometimes it is the _patria potestas_\r\nwhich is a check to the _manus_ of the husband. The wife, in marrying,\r\nwithout being subject to the _manus_, remains subject to her father,\r\nwho can even claim her again.\r\n\r\nBut the institution of the dowry as obligatory and inalienable by\r\nthe husband, the power of the woman to marry while remaining in the\r\npaternal family, to have her paraphernalia, to inherit property of\r\nher father, to control both of these, and also the great facility\r\nof divorce, ended by rendering the Roman, or at least the patrician\r\nmatron, almost independent. Under the empire Roman marriage had become\r\nin fact a sort of free union, in which money considerations played the\r\npredominant part. Plautus already speaks of the dotal-slave, a creature\r\nof the wife’s, managing her property and ruling the husband--\r\n\r\n “_Argentum accepi, dote imperium vendidi._”[616]\r\n\r\nHorace mentions the wife ruling by means of her dowry--“_dotata regit\r\nvirum conjux_” (_Od._ iii. 18). Martial declares that he wishes no\r\nrich marriage; it does not suit him, he says, to be married by his\r\nwife--“_uxori nubere nolo meae_” (_Epig._ viii. 12). From Seneca to\r\nSaint Jerome, who both speak of it, the dotal-slave is advantageously\r\nreplaced by the frizzed steward (_Procurator calamistratus_) managing\r\nthe affairs of my lady.[617] They went further still, and as it\r\nhappens in Russia at the present day, they concluded fictitious\r\nmarriages; but at Rome, these false marriages, contracted for ready\r\nmoney, had no other object than to elude the laws against celibacy.[618]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _Barbarous Marriage and Christian Marriage._\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid being too incomplete in this rapid survey of marriage\r\namong all races, I will say a few words on barbarous marriage outside\r\nthe Greco-Roman world.\r\n\r\nThe barbarians of ancient Europe, more or less monogamous, have\r\ndiffered little from any others. Their marriage resembles that of their\r\nfellows of all races and all times; that which chiefly characterises it\r\nis the subjection of woman.\r\n\r\nBarbarous women, says Plutarch, neither ate nor drank with their\r\nhusbands, and never called them by their name.[619] Among the\r\nGermans, who were more often monogamous, as Tacitus says,[620] the\r\nwife was purchased; then the purchase-money was transformed into a\r\ndower accorded to the bride under the name of _morgengabe_ or oscle\r\n(_osculum_), the price of the first kiss.\r\n\r\nGerman betrothals, which could only be annulled for a serious reason,\r\nstrongly resembled Latin ones--that is, they were a sale of the girl in\r\nanticipation by her legal owners. It was necessary for the girl to have\r\nthe consent of her father, or her nearest relative, for her marriage.\r\nAs widow, having been purchased, she belonged to the relatives of her\r\ndead husband, and could not marry again without their leave.[621] The\r\nfeudalism of the Middle Ages was careful not to emancipate the woman,\r\nand she remained a minor, or even less, since the Code of Beaumanoir\r\nsays (titre lvii.)--“Every husband can beat his wife when she will\r\nnot obey his commands, or when she curses him or contradicts him,\r\nprovided that he does it moderately, and that death does not follow in\r\nconsequence.” Among the Saxons, the Burgundians, and the Germans in\r\ngeneral, the widow was subjected to the rule of her eldest son as soon\r\nas he had attained the age of fifteen.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the woman surprised in committing adultery might\r\nbe executed by her husband, who even had the right to call in the aid\r\nof her son.[622] In the ninth and tenth centuries, however, among the\r\nSaxons in England, an advance that was quite exceptional took place.\r\nThe young girl could marry herself, was not repudiable at will, had\r\nher own property and her keys, and the penal law of her husband ceased\r\nto weigh upon her.[623] This progress was quite local, and operated\r\nspontaneously, quite independently of Christian influence. In fact,\r\nChristianity has only emancipated women spiritually, and its real\r\ninfluence on marriage has been injurious. Doubtless the Christian wife\r\nmight hope to become a seraph in the next world, but in this she was\r\nonly a servant or a slave. In Greco-Roman antiquity marriage had been\r\nconsidered, as it ought to be, a civil institution. Legislation, more\r\nor less sensible and intelligent, regarded it simply from the point of\r\nview of population.\r\n\r\nChristianity, which taught that the earthly country was of no account,\r\nand taxed with impurity all that related to sexual union, made marriage\r\na sacrament, and consequently an institution quite apart from humble\r\nconsiderations of social utility. All sexual union outside marriage\r\nwas reputed criminal; the ideal preached to women was the mystic\r\nmarriage with God. The pious Constantine increased all the penalties\r\nagainst sexual crimes. Adultery became again a capital offence; the\r\nwoman guilty of marrying a slave was condemned to death;[624] marriage\r\nwas declared indissoluble; second marriages were blameworthy. At the\r\nsame time the fathers of the Church and the preachers did not cease\r\nto utter their thunders against woman, disparaging her, and abusing\r\nher as an impure creature, almost devilish. This encouraged the severe\r\nlegislation of the barbarians in conjugal matters. I have previously\r\nmentioned some traits of these brutal laws. I shall return to them in\r\nspeaking of questions connected with marriage, which remain still to\r\nbe treated of--adultery, divorce, and widowhood. We shall then see how\r\nhurtful the influence of Christianity has been on marriage, and we\r\nshall come to the conclusion that in order to manage earthly affairs\r\nwell, it is not good to keep our looks constantly raised to the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[560] Exodus, xxi. 8-10.\r\n\r\n[561] Genesis, ii. 24.\r\n\r\n[562] Deut., ch. xxii., ver. 13-21.\r\n\r\n[563] Hovelacque, _L’Avesta_, p. 396.\r\n\r\n[564] _Code of Manu_, book ix. pp. 5-17.\r\n\r\n[565] _Code of Manu_, v. pp. 147, 148.\r\n\r\n[566] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[567] _Ibid._ ix. p. 90.\r\n\r\n[568] _Ibid._ p. 93.\r\n\r\n[569] _Ibid._ p. 94.\r\n\r\n[570] _Ibid._ iii. pp. 51, 53.\r\n\r\n[571] _Ibid._ book iii.\r\n\r\n[572] _Ibid._ book iii. pp. 171, 172.\r\n\r\n[573] _Ibid._ pp. 14, 15.\r\n\r\n[574] _Code of Manu_, book iii. p. 19.\r\n\r\n[575] _Ibid._ p. 17.\r\n\r\n[576] _Ibid._ pp. 4-10.\r\n\r\n[577] _Ibid._ ix. pp. 46, 47.\r\n\r\n[578] Somerset, _Hist.

That the human\r\nspecies, and especially the primitive, unpolished human species, is one\r\nof the most ferocious of the animal kingdom, stands out strikingly from\r\nthese investigations; but it is perhaps in regard to adultery that the\r\ncruelty and injustice of men are most strongly shown; and by the word\r\n“men” here we mean the masculine half of mankind, for generally the\r\nonly adultery which has been punished has been that of the woman. As\r\nfor the adultery of the husband, men have been very slow in admitting\r\nthat it was a wrong of which the wife might complain.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this revolting partiality is very simple. Diderot makes\r\nOrou tell it in his _Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville_; it is\r\nthat “the tyranny of man has converted the possession of woman into a\r\nproperty.”[625]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, our long inquiry has abundantly proved that very\r\ngenerally, in human societies, marriage has been, or is still, a\r\nbargain, when not a capture. In all legislations the married woman is\r\nmore or less openly considered as the property of the husband, and is\r\nvery often confounded, absolutely confounded, with things possessed. To\r\nuse her, therefore, without the authority of her owner, is a theft; and\r\nhuman societies have never been tender to thieves. Nearly everywhere\r\ntheft has been considered a crime much more grave than murder. But\r\nadultery is not a common theft. An object, an inert possession, are\r\npassive things; their owner may well punish the thief who has taken\r\nthem, but him only. In adultery, the object of the larceny, the wife,\r\nis a sentient and thinking being--that is to say, an accomplice in\r\nthe attempt on her husband’s property in her own person; moreover, he\r\ngenerally has her in his keeping; he can chastise her freely, and glut\r\nhis rage on her without any arm being raised for her defence. On the\r\ncontrary, in letting loose his vengeance the husband will frequently\r\nhave public opinion and law on his side, when the latter does not take\r\non itself the punishment of the guilty one. But let us listen once more\r\nto the eloquent language of facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Adultery in Melanesia._\r\n\r\nIn Tasmania and Australia the women were, or are, considered as the\r\nproperty of the men. We have seen that in these countries there is\r\nno care for decency or chastity, and that wives are often obtained\r\nby brutal rape. Their proprietors also make no scruple of letting\r\nthem out, lending them, or bartering them; they have the fullest\r\nright to use or abuse them. The Tasmanians felt very honoured if a\r\nwhite man borrowed their wives, but they none the less chastised, and\r\nvery cruelly too, unauthorised infidelities, on the simple ground,\r\nas their panegyrist, the Rev. Bonwick, tells us, of their right of\r\nownership.[626] In certain Australian tribes, organised in classes, the\r\nwomen were reputed common to all the individuals of the same class,\r\nbut all intimate relation with a man of another group was a most grave\r\nadultery for both the guilty ones--a social adultery.[627]\r\n\r\nIn the greater number of New Caledonian tribes the punishment of\r\nadultery is left to the care of the injured husband, who kills the\r\nthief, if he can, but often contents himself with giving a severe\r\npunishment to his wife, sometimes inflicting a sort of scalping. At\r\nKanala, however, adultery has already become a social crime. The man\r\nwho commits it is led before the chief, judged by the council of elders\r\nwhom the chief presides over, and executed on the spot.[628] But in one\r\nway or another, whether he incurs the social vengeance or that of the\r\noffended one--the robbed one, rather--and of his relatives, the New\r\nCaledonian who commits adultery risks his life. Sometimes, however, he\r\ncan get off by paying a fine, after the old German fashion. Often also,\r\nin case of adultery committed by a married man, the New Caledonians\r\npractise a singular retaliation: the adult men of the village simply\r\nviolate the wife of the delinquent.[629] The wives of the chiefs being\r\nmuch more sacred than the others, the slightest attempt on the rights\r\nof their proprietors risks being cruelly punished. M. Moncelon has seen\r\na man condemned to death merely for having looked at the wife of the\r\nchief while she was picking up shells;[630] it was regarded as treason.\r\nThis ferocity in the repression of adultery is not at all special to\r\nMelanesia. With some variations, it is found in all times and in all\r\ncountries. It is worthy of remark also that even when the adulterous\r\nman is punished, it is simply because he has robbed another husband,\r\nand not because he has failed in conjugal faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Adultery in Black Africa._\r\n\r\nWe have previously seen that among the black populations of Africa\r\nmarriage is a simple bargain, and that the negresses are only\r\nmoderately chaste. Now, as the purchase of wives and the absence of\r\nchastity in the women are factors eminently suited to produce adultery,\r\nwe shall not be surprised to find that it is very common in Africa; it\r\nis nevertheless very severely punished there, but only because it is\r\na very grave outrage on property. Among the Hottentots, the husband,\r\nhaving the right of life and death[631] over his wife or wives, and\r\nbeing allowed to kill them for the smallest offence, naturally enjoys\r\nthe same right, with a much stronger reason, when they commit an\r\nunauthorised infidelity, for he can lend or let them to strangers if he\r\nlikes.[632]\r\n\r\nIn the tribes where polygamy already inclines to monogamy, and where\r\nthere exists a chief wife ruling over the others, the gravity of the\r\ncrime of adultery is in relation to the position occupied by the\r\nwoman. Thus, at the Gaboon, Du Chaillu tells us, where the women are\r\nextremely dissolute, a distinction is made in their infidelities.\r\nThe adultery of the chief wife is an enormous crime. The man who\r\nhas been an accomplice in it is, at the very least, sold as a slave;\r\nbut adultery with less important wives can be atoned for by a large\r\ncompensation.[633] As for the woman, her pecuniary value often protects\r\nher. The husband-proprietor has bought his wife, and he cares very\r\nlittle for the purity of her morals, since he has no scruple in making\r\nher an object of traffic;[634] therefore, whenever she is unfaithful\r\nwithout his permission, the consideration of the cost of purchase and\r\nof the possible profit of letting her out, often restrains his vengeful\r\narm. He is free, however, to punish or to pardon, and sometimes the\r\nchastisement of adultery is terrible. At Bornou, for example, the\r\nguilty ones are bound hand and foot, and their heads are smashed\r\nby being struck together.[635] At Kaarta, says Mungo Park, the two\r\nguilty ones are put to death. With the Soulimas there is a singular\r\nexception to this. The adulterous woman merely has her head shaved,\r\nand she loses a privilege which is probably of Berber origin--viz.,\r\nthat of quitting her husband at will, simply by refunding him the\r\namount of purchase-money he has paid for her. All the vengeance of\r\nthe husband falls on the lover, and he makes him his slave.[636] At\r\nJouida, in Dahomey, the offended husband had still the right, in 1713,\r\nof invoking judicial power in order to have his guilty wife strangled\r\nor beheaded by the public executioner.[637] Her accomplice was not\r\nspared, and sometimes, says Bosman, he was burned at a slow fire. This\r\ncruel wish to make delinquents suffer a long time is found again in\r\nUganda, where King M’tesa caused adulterers to be dismembered, having\r\none limb at a time cut off and thrown to the vultures, who feasted\r\non it before the eyes of the sufferers.[638] With the Ashantees, the\r\nhusband, as sovereign justiciary, can either kill his wife, or marry\r\nher to a slave, or cut off her nose, according to his pleasure.[639]\r\nWe find this last punishment specially applied to adultery in various\r\ncountries, and Diodorus will tell us the motive for it. On the\r\nSenegal coast the all-powerful protection of money saved the life of\r\nadulterers, and the offended husbands spared them in order to sell them\r\nto European slave-traders.\r\n\r\nIn Abyssinia the conjugal bond is so frail, morals are so shameless,\r\nand divorce is so easy, that adultery is rarely taken in a tragic\r\nlight. Formerly the injured husband often confined himself to\r\nchasing from his house the adulterous woman, clothed in rags for the\r\noccasion.[640]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Adultery in Polynesia._\r\n\r\nPolynesian customs alone would suffice to prove that in primitive\r\ncountries adultery is simply punished as a robbery, or commercial\r\nfraud. As regards sexual morality, or rather immorality, nothing can\r\nbe compared to what was practised in Polynesia, where all modesty was\r\nunknown, where the husbands willingly let out their wives, and the\r\nintimate friend of the husband (_tayo_) had the right to share his\r\nwife with him. But dissolute as they were, these islanders were very\r\ndetermined conjugal proprietors, and they sometimes punished adultery\r\nwith the most extreme severity. The missionary, Marsden, relates that a\r\nNew Zealand chief killed his adulterous wife by dealing her a blow on\r\nthe head with his club. Public opinion approved of the deed, and the\r\nbrother of the dead woman came to take the body, only making a feint of\r\nretaliation, because the punishment was considered to be merited.[641]\r\n\r\nCook saw at Tahiti a native man punished in the same way for adultery,\r\nby blows of the club; but in this case there was the aggravating\r\ncircumstance that the woman belonged to a class superior to his.[642]\r\nIn some islands, especially at Tahiti and Tonga, where the customs were\r\nless savage, and licence was more unbridled than in New Zealand, the\r\nwomen sometimes got off with a simple correction. We must again remark\r\nthat what was blamed and punished was not the adultery itself, but\r\nadultery unauthorised, or not commanded by the legal owner--in short,\r\ntheft.\r\n\r\nAt Noukahiva, says Krusenstern, there was a functionary called the\r\n“fire-lighter” who lived with the wife of a king. The duty of this\r\ndignitary was, in the first place, to obey the queen, and in the next\r\nto supply her husband’s place with her in case of prolonged absence on\r\nhis part.[643] Taking this fact by the side of others, as, for example,\r\nthe unlimited right of the friend, or _tayo_, over the wife, we see\r\nclearly what the Polynesians understood by adultery.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Adultery in Savage America._\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux, who are as free from prejudices in their conjugal\r\ncustoms as the Polynesians, have also, at least certain of them,\r\nadopted the custom of joint husbands, _cicisbei_, who replace the\r\nhusband in case of absence.[644] There are some, however, who blame\r\nthe adultery of wives, and believe even that the fairies would kill\r\nthem if their wives were unfaithful during their absence.[645] But\r\nall the Esquimaux are not equally easy going; some of them, the\r\nreindeer Koriaks, for example, kill at once the man and woman taken in\r\nadultery.[646]\r\n\r\nThe Redskins are always less tolerant; with them adultery is a very\r\nserious affair, although they often also consider the exchange of wives\r\na mark of friendship. It is generally the husband who takes vengeance\r\nas he pleases, and he often does so by cutting open with his teeth\r\nthe nose, and sometimes the ears, of the guilty woman. This was the\r\npractice with the Comanches,[647] the Yumas,[648] and the Sioux.[649]\r\nBut the injured, or robbed, husband is at liberty to make a\r\ncomposition with the seducer.[650] He can at will either pardon--as did\r\na Mandan husband who sent the wife to her lover, adding three horses\r\nto the present[651]--or he can put to death the faithless wife and her\r\naccomplice. By a rare exception, the Omahas recognised the right of the\r\nwife to revenge herself on an adulterous husband and his mistress.[652]\r\nWith the Omahas, also, an adulterous wife was bound to a stake in the\r\nprairie, abused by twenty or thirty men, and then abandoned by her\r\nhusband.[653] We have seen that this obscene mode of retaliation is in\r\nuse at New Caledonia, and we shall find it again in the Roman Empire.\r\nThe mode of vengeance with the Redskins, whether of the husband or the\r\ntribe, varied according to locality, but was often atrocious. Thus the\r\nModocs of California publicly disembowelled the guilty woman.[654]\r\nAmong the Hoopsas, another tribe of Californian Redskins, the male\r\naccomplice in the adultery lost one eye,[655] or, if he was married,\r\nthe injured man took his wife.\r\n\r\nThe natives of South America were not more clement than their congeners\r\nin the north. The Caribees put both guilty ones to death.[656] The\r\nGuarayos also punished with death the accomplice in adultery as if he\r\nwere a thief.[657]\r\n\r\nFrom this rapid survey of savage countries we may conclude that\r\nadultery is everywhere considered as a robbery only, but at the same\r\ntime as one of the gravest of robberies. The man who is guilty of\r\nadultery suffers consequently, by virtue of the right of retaliation,\r\na punishment more or less severe. As for the adulterous woman, she is\r\ngenerally chastised by the husband-proprietor with extreme cruelty, no\r\nrestraint existing to moderate his vengeance.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _Adultery in Barbarous America._\r\n\r\nIn the barbarous monarchies of all countries the chastisement of\r\nadultery is scarcely mitigated, and for a long time it is directly\r\ninflicted on the guilty woman by the husband or the parents.\r\n\r\nWith the Pipiles of Salvador the man who committed adultery was put to\r\ndeath, or became the slave of the offended husband.[658] In Yucatan the\r\nguilty ones were stoned or pierced with arrows; before this they were\r\nimpaled or disjointed.[659] According to Herrara, among the Yzipecs the\r\ninjured husband cut off the nose and ears of the adulterous woman.[660]\r\nThe same author tells us that among the Guaxlotillans the woman was\r\ntaken before the Cacique, and if found guilty she was cut in pieces and\r\neaten.[661]\r\n\r\nIn ancient Mexico adultery was generally punished with stoning,[662]\r\nand in certain districts this crime entailed the quartering of the\r\nguilty woman; elsewhere, the judges simply ordered the husband to cut\r\noff her nose and ears.[663]\r\n\r\nIn Peru the law also punished ordinary adultery with capital\r\npunishment.[664] There was no chastisement terrible enough for adultery\r\ncommitted with one of the wives of the Inca, the son of the Sun: the\r\nguilty man was burnt, his parents were put to death, and his house\r\ndestroyed (Pizarro).\r\n\r\nGuatemala offered an exception;[665] there the affair was arranged by\r\na composition--a fine of precious feathers paid to the husband. The\r\nlatter could also repudiate his wife, or pardon her, in which last\r\ncase he was much honoured. If the adultery was committed with the wife\r\nof a great lord, the crime naturally acquired an exceptional gravity;\r\nthe guilty man was then strangled if he was noble, and if servile,\r\nwas thrown down a precipice. We shall find elsewhere this hierarchic\r\niniquity, for in this matter, as in others, various human societies and\r\nraces repeat themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. _Adultery among the Mongol Races and in Malaya._\r\n\r\nThus the Mongols of Asia seem to have copied the Mongoloids of America.\r\nWith the nomad Tartars a man of inferior class who has committed\r\nadultery with a woman of his own class pays the injured husband\r\nforty-five head of cattle; but the husband must revenge himself on the\r\ninconstant wife. The law invites him to do so; for if he kills her,\r\nthe compensation of cattle remains his property; if not, it goes to\r\nthe prince. But if it happens that a man of low condition has illicit\r\nintercourse with the wife of a prince, then the crime is terrible; the\r\nman is cut to pieces, the faithless wife is decapitated, and the family\r\nof the guilty man reduced to slavery.[666] If we may believe a modern\r\ntraveller, Mongol customs have become considerably modified on this\r\npoint, adultery being now extremely common in Mongolia, and so little\r\nrepressed that the women hardly take the trouble to conceal it.[667]\r\n\r\nIn lamaic Thibet they do not regard adultery as a tragedy. The wife is\r\ncorrected, and the lover pays a fine to the husband, or husbands, when\r\nthere are several.[668]\r\n\r\nChinese legislation is relatively moderate in regard to adultery. In\r\nthe first place it expressly forbids the husband to lend or let out\r\nhis wife, under pain of twenty-four strokes with the bamboo.[669] The\r\nChinese woman can certainly be imprisoned for adultery,[670] but she is\r\nchiefly punished by repudiation, which is obligatory on the husband on\r\npain of twenty strokes of the bamboo.[671] She can, however, be sold\r\neither by the husband or by the judge to whom the offended husband\r\nremits her.[672] In contrast to certain barbarous legislations, the\r\nChinese law is more severe in regard to adultery for the strong than\r\nfor the weak. “Whoever, on the strength of his power or credit, shall\r\ntake away the wife or the daughter of a free man to make her his own\r\nwife, shall be imprisoned for the usual time and put to death by\r\nstrangulation.”[673]\r\n\r\nIn Japan the law gives the offended husband the cruel and very general\r\nright to kill the guilty ones if taken in adultery, and forbids him to\r\nspare one.[674] We find this latter injunction, perhaps more humane\r\nthan it appears, in ancient Roman legislation and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNothing is at once more monotonous and more ghastly than this\r\nethnographic review of the penalties against adultery.\r\n\r\nSimple death has not sufficed to punish this crime, so enormous has\r\nit everywhere seemed; and thus other refinements of cruelty have been\r\nadded--disembowelling, cutting in pieces, the stake, etc.\r\n\r\nSo far, among the races we have been investigating, Chinese legislation\r\nhas been the wisest and most just, since, contrary to usual custom, it\r\nenacts the most severe penalties against the powerful man who takes\r\nadvantage of his social position to commit adultery. Here and there,\r\nhowever, we find societies where adultery excites less fury. These\r\nsocieties are rare, and they are not always the most civilised.\r\n\r\nAt Java, for example, adultery is treated with clemency, especially\r\nif it is not committed with the chief wife. Even in this last case\r\nthe guilty one, at least the man, is often only punished by public\r\ncontempt.[675] The Dyaks punish conjugal infidelity with a fine only,\r\nfor both parties.[676] This is a rare example of clemency, and it is\r\ngiven by a still barbarous race. We look in vain for such moderation\r\namong much more civilised peoples, as we shall see in studying ancient\r\nEgypt and the Berbers and Semites.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. _Adultery among the Egyptians, the Berbers, and the Semites._\r\n\r\nDiodorus tells us that in ancient Egypt the man who was guilty of\r\nadultery received a thousand lashes, whilst the woman suffered the\r\namputation of her nose, a very special penalty, which we have seen\r\nused in America and negro Africa, which we shall find also among the\r\nSaxons of England, and for which Diodorus has given us the reason. “The\r\nlegislator,” he says, “has intended to deprive the woman of attractions\r\nwhich she had only made use of for seduction.”[677]\r\n\r\nThe Bible, also, is not tender towards adulterers. But it makes no\r\ndistinction between the culpability of the man and the woman; stoning\r\nis for both. This terrible punishment is not only inflicted on the\r\nfaithless wife, but on the inconstant _fiancée_. The accomplices\r\neven are put to death. There are, however, some distinctions, and\r\nprecautions are taken to mitigate the rigour of the law; thus the\r\nguilty woman is only condemned to be stoned if the crime has been\r\ncommitted in the city. If in the fields, the man alone incurs\r\nstoning;[678] it is thus admitted that the woman may have suffered\r\nviolence. Besides this, two witnesses are in all cases necessary to\r\nestablish the crime. Lastly, the slave woman is not punished with\r\ndeath.[679]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Arabs were not more clement towards adultery than their\r\ncousins of Palestine, and the Bedouins, who have preserved more of\r\nthe old customs, still consider adultery as the greatest of crimes.\r\nBurckhardt tells us that with them the adulterous woman is beheaded\r\neither by her father or her brother.[680] These are morals that go far\r\nbeyond the prescriptions of the Koran. It would seem that Mahomet,\r\nmuch given to sexual pleasures himself, had not the courage to be too\r\nsevere on others. He, indeed, calls the adultery of woman the “infamous\r\naction” _par excellence_, but he directs, nevertheless, that the crime\r\nbe proved by four witnesses.[681] Moreover, the woman can escape the\r\npunishment by swearing four times before God that she is innocent,\r\nand that her husband has lied.[682] If she is convicted, both she and\r\nher accomplice receive a hundred lashes in public. Then the woman\r\nmust be shut up “until death visits her, or God finds her a means of\r\nsalvation,”[683] all of which is relatively mild enough.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mussulmans, the Kabyles of Algeria do not keep to the somewhat\r\nhumane prescriptions of the Koran in regard to adultery. In general,\r\nthey are pitiless towards all infractions of morals. With them a\r\nkiss on the mouth is equivalent to adultery, and costs more than an\r\nassassination.[684] Every child born out of marriage is put to death,\r\nas well as its mother.[685] If the family tries to spare the guilty\r\none, the Djemâa stones her and imposes a fine on the relatives.[686]\r\nThe child and mother are stoned by the Djemâa or the family. Even when\r\na woman is actually separated from her husband her adulterous child is\r\nkilled, but the fate of the mother is left to the discretion of the\r\nrelatives.[687]\r\n\r\nWhoever carries off a woman, especially a married woman, and flees\r\nwith her, becomes a public enemy, and the village where the fugitives\r\nhave taken refuge must give them up under pain of war. The man is put\r\nto death, and the woman is restored to her family, who do not spare\r\nher.[688]\r\n\r\nCustom authorises the deceived husband to sacrifice his wife, and if\r\nhe rarely does it he is only hindered by the loss of the capital she\r\nrepresents; but usage requires the repudiation,[689] and the husband\r\nmust, besides, take a striking and bloody vengeance on the lover.[690]\r\nAt the very least he must simulate it, must fire, perhaps, on the\r\nguilty one with a gun loaded only with powder, and strike or slightly\r\nwound his wife’s lover. He has thus saved his honour; he is content\r\nwith little, as in our rose-water duels.[691] With the Kabyles, more\r\nthan elsewhere, marriage is a mercenary affair; consequently adultery\r\nnaturally has pecuniary consequences. Thus, in compensation for\r\nadultery or the abduction of his wife, the husband has a right to the\r\namount of the purchase, the _thâmanth_, or to an indemnity, sometimes\r\narbitrary, sometimes tariffed;[692] but this compensation in money is\r\ndistinct from the retaliation, and in no way hinders it.[693]\r\n\r\nLastly, the Kabyle legislation formally interdicts the marriage of the\r\nadulterous woman with her accomplice.[694]\r\n\r\nBeginning with Melanesia and reaching Kabyle, I have sought among\r\nvery different races, forming altogether the major part of mankind,\r\nthe penalties used or decreed against adulterers. The result is a\r\nlamentable enumeration of sanguinary follies. I have passed by in\r\nsilence the legendary or exceptional sufferings. I have not spoken\r\nof women crushed under the feet of elephants, violated by stallions,\r\nburied alive, etc. The common reality alone more than suffices to show\r\nthat man, still far from being very delicate in conjugal or amorous\r\nmatters, considers adultery as a great crime, especially for woman. It\r\nremains for us to see how the races calling themselves _par excellence_\r\nnoble--the Indo-European races--have regarded this fault, so difficult\r\nto pardon.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. _Adultery in Persia and India._\r\n\r\nThe Avesta does not mention adultery in ancient Persia. In modern\r\nPersia it has been punished with ferocity, except, naturally, when it\r\nwas committed by the Shah, who chose, according to his fancy, any young\r\ngirls or women among his subjects, without any one daring to find fault\r\nwith him.[695] But for private individuals adultery was an abominable\r\ncrime; the man who had committed it was put to death; the woman,\r\ntreated of course more severely, was tied up alive in a sack and thrown\r\ninto the water.\r\n\r\nThe Code of Manu gives us very complete information in regard to\r\nthe penalty for adultery in ancient India. In the first place, it is\r\nunderstood that the adultery of the husband ought not to trouble the\r\nwife at all. “Although the conduct of her husband may be blameworthy,\r\nand he may give himself up to other amours and be devoid of good\r\nqualities, a virtuous woman ought constantly to revere him as a\r\ngod.”[696] The adultery of the woman is naturally quite another thing.\r\n“If a woman, proud of her family and her importance, is unfaithful\r\nto her husband, the king shall have her devoured by dogs in a very\r\nfrequented public place.”[697] If a woman of high rank, the lover\r\nalso is not spared. “The king shall condemn her accomplice to be\r\nburned on a bed of red hot iron.”[698] For the less aristocratic\r\nadultery the punishment varies according to the caste. “For adultery\r\nwith a protected Brahmanee, a Vaisya loses all his property, after\r\nimprisonment for a year; a Kchatriya is condemned to pay a thousand\r\npanas, to have his head shaved and watered with urine of an ass.” For\r\nthe Brahmin the penalty is very light. “An ignominious tonsure is\r\nordered instead of capital punishment for a Brahmin in the cases where\r\nthe punishment of the other classes would be death.”[699] The Soudra,\r\non the contrary, who holds criminal commerce with a woman belonging\r\nto one of the three first classes, “shall be deprived of the guilty\r\nmember, and of all his possessions, if she was not guarded; but if it\r\nwas so, he loses both his goods and his existence.”[700] It must be\r\nnoticed, also, that very slight evidence suffices to prove adultery.\r\n“To pay little attentions to a woman, to send her flowers and perfumes,\r\nto frolic with her, to touch her ornaments or vestments, to sit with\r\nher on the same couch, are considered by wise men as proofs of an\r\nadulterous love.”[701]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the husband, if he has had no children, can oblige\r\nhis wife to give herself either to his brother or to another relative.\r\n“Anointed with liquid butter and keeping silence, let the relative\r\ncharged with this office approach during the night a widow or a\r\nchildless woman, and engender one single son, but never a second.”\r\nThen, in the following verse, the Code alters: “Some of those who\r\nunderstand this question well, think that the aim of this precept\r\nis not perfectly attained by the birth of a single child, and that\r\nwomen may legally engender in this manner a second son.”[702] One\r\nverse, certainly less ancient, contradicts these curious texts, which\r\nare evidently survivals of primitive customs, according to which the\r\nhusband disposed as he pleased of his feminine property. More modern\r\nBrahmanic legislation still authorises the husband to kill the wife\r\nand her lover if taken in adultery, and there would be nothing new to\r\nus in this, if, as in Japan, and as formerly at Rome, the law did not\r\nformally interdict him from killing only one of the two culprits.[703]\r\n\r\n\r\nX. _Adultery in the Greco-Roman World._\r\n\r\nHowever Aryan India may be, she differs very remarkably from us. Let\r\nus look now at the way in which adultery has been regarded in Europe,\r\nand, to begin with, in the Greco-Roman world. We know that in classic\r\nantiquity marriage was quite crudely considered as a civic duty, and\r\nlooked at from the single point of view of population. Lycurgus and\r\nSolon encouraged the impotent husband to favour the adultery of his\r\nyoung wife. Speaking of the laws of Lycurgus, Plutarch says--“He\r\nlaughed at those who revenge with war and bloodshed the communication\r\nof a married woman’s favours; and allowed that, if any one in years\r\nshould have a young wife, he might introduce to her some handsome and\r\nworthy young man, whom he most approved, and when she had borne a\r\nchild of this generous race, bring it up as his own. Also he permitted\r\nthat if a man of character should entertain a passion for a married\r\nwoman upon account of her modesty and the beauty of her children, he\r\nmight beg her husband that he might be allowed to plant, as it were,\r\nin rich and fertile soil, excellent children, the congenial offspring\r\nof excellent parents.”[704] This is marriage considered without the\r\nleast prejudice, from the strict point of view of social utility. Solon\r\nimitates Lycurgus on this point, but with one restriction which recalls\r\nthe Code of Manu, that the wife of an impotent husband should, with his\r\npermission of course, choose a lover from among the nearest relatives\r\nof the said husband.[705]\r\n\r\nCustom sometimes went further than the laws, and Plutarch relates that\r\nCimon of Athens, who was a model of goodness and greatness of soul,\r\nlent his wife to the rich Callias.[706] But that did not prevent the\r\nlaws of Solon from authorising the husband to kill the adulterer.[707]\r\nFurther, the law punished with civil degradation the too indulgent\r\nhusband, and authorised the family tribunals to condemn to death the\r\nguilty woman, whom the husband himself executed before witnesses.[708]\r\nLastly, a law of Draco, which was never abrogated, delivered the\r\nadulterous lover to the discretion of the husband.[709] After all, save\r\nfor the good of the state, before which everything had to bend, this\r\nGreek legislation only consecrates the old primitive right by which the\r\nwife was the property of her husband.\r\n\r\nIn all that concerns marriage ancient Rome singularly resembles\r\nancient Greece.[710] Her customs and regulations regarding the wife\r\nwere at first of a savage atrocity. The term adulterer begins by being\r\napplied to the woman alone, and the law of the Ten Tables arraigned\r\nthe guilty wife before the domestic tribunal; she was condemned and\r\nexecuted by the relatives themselves--_Cognati necanto uti volent_.\r\nFamily tribunals continued to exist during the whole period of the\r\nrepublic, and even later, concurrently with the law _Julia_; but\r\ncustoms softened, and death was commuted to banishment to two hundred\r\nmiles from Rome at the least, with the obligation of wearing the toga\r\nof the courtesan. The _flagrante delicto_ naturally authorised the\r\nhusband to kill the wife on the spot;[711] as for the lover, he could\r\nkeep him, torture him, mutilate him, _raffanise_ him (I dare not give\r\nthe sense of this picturesque word), and deliver him to the ferocious\r\nlubricity of his slaves. Law and public opinion authorised the husband\r\nto fleece the surprised lover, and thus torture could be made a means\r\nof extorting money from him.\r\n\r\nThe _Lex Julia_, enacted either by Julius Cæsar or Augustus, attempted\r\na reform of morals. By the terms of this law, which was in force till\r\nthe time of Justinian, the husband could not kill his wife, taken in\r\nadultery, without being punished as a murderer. Neither could he put\r\nthe lover to death unless he were a slave, a go-between (_leno_), a\r\ncomedian, or a freed man of the husband or of the family. But the\r\nhusband could hold him prisoner twenty hours in order to procure\r\nwitnesses. The father had more extensive rights than the husband; he\r\nwas authorised, in case of _flagrante delicto_, to kill his daughter\r\nand her lover, but he was to kill them both, and immediately. However,\r\nto enable him to act thus as justiciary, he must have the _potestas_\r\nstill, and the crime must have been committed in his house, or in\r\nthat of his son-in-law. The _Lex Julia_ punishes the adulterous man\r\nby the confiscation of the half of his goods; it decrees the same\r\npunishment for the woman, and, besides, forbids her to marry after\r\nthe repudiation, which was obligatory for the husband. The latter was\r\nobliged even to drive away his wife at once for fear of being called\r\na go-between. This same _Lex Julia_ made adultery a public crime\r\nwhich every citizen could bring before the tribunals, and it punished\r\nwith the sword the adulterous man.[712] By degrees, and towards the\r\nChristian epoch, the legislation relative to adultery was amended.\r\n\r\nIn his quality of philosopher the Emperor Antoninus was more clement\r\nand just than his predecessors; by one law he interdicted the husband,\r\nwho might himself be presumably guilty of adultery, to kill or sue his\r\nwife surprised in _flagrante delicto_. By degrees the customs became in\r\ntime so free and so tolerant that, Septimus Severus having enacted new\r\nlaws against adultery, the consul, Dion Cassius, found at Rome three\r\nthousand plaints on the register for this cause.[713] Theodosius, says\r\nan ecclesiastical writer, mitigated the penalties against adultery; he\r\nabolished an ancient Roman custom, inspired by the idea of retaliation,\r\naccording to which the guilty woman, shut up in a little hut, was\r\ngiven to the passers-by, who even were to be furnished with little\r\nbells to attract attention.[714] The same ignoble penalty was, we\r\nhave seen, in use among several of the Redskin tribes, and this fact\r\nproves, with many others, the original equality of the most diverse\r\nraces in primitive savagery. Yielding to the ardour of a new convert,\r\nConstantine legislated with fury against all moral outrages, and\r\ndecreed, without wincing, the punishment of death against adulterers of\r\nboth sexes.\r\n\r\nJustinian reformed and moderated legal severities. His code condemns\r\nthe adulteress to be whipped, to have her hair shaved, and to be shut\r\nin a convent for life, if her husband does not take her back before\r\nthe end of two years. In comparison with the excess of zeal shown by\r\nConstantine, this is nearly merciful. We have already said enough of\r\nthe relaxation of manners under the wiser Pagan emperors. A marriage\r\nwhich was almost free procured for young women of the aristocracy an\r\nindependence without much restraint; and in practice, at least, and in\r\nspite of the laws, adultery had ceased to be the abominable crime which\r\nit had begun by being.[715]\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. _Adultery in Barbarous Europe._\r\n\r\nOur ancestors of barbarous Europe have had, as regards adultery,\r\ncustoms quite as ferocious as those of the savages of any other race.\r\nThese same customs were still found recently among the Tcherkesses of\r\nthe Caucasus, where the injured husband shaved the hair of the guilty\r\nwoman, split her ears, and sent her back to her parents, who sold her\r\nor put her to death.[716] The lover was generally killed by the husband\r\nor his relatives. With the Lesghis, the husband who had not killed his\r\nadulterous wife in _flagrante delicto_ could have her judged by the\r\ncouncil of the tribe, and she was then condemned and stoned after the\r\nHebrew fashion.[717]\r\n\r\nIn the Germanic and Scandinavian countries adultery has primitively\r\nbeen considered as an enormous crime. Thus the ancient Danes punished\r\nadultery with death, whilst murder was only fined. The old Saxons began\r\nby burning alive the adulteress, and on the extinct fire they hung or\r\nstrangled her accomplice. In England King Edmund assimilated adultery\r\nto murder. King Canute ordered that the man should be banished, and the\r\nwoman should have her nose and ears slit.\r\n\r\nTacitus tells us that with the Germans the adulteress was made to walk\r\nnaked through the villages. Prior to the ordinances of Canute this old\r\nGerman custom was still preserved in England. Her head shaved, and her\r\nbody bare to the waist, the woman was dragged out of her husband’s\r\nhouse in the presence of her relations, and then whipped to death\r\nthrough the streets. Her lover was hung on a tree.\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of the Visigoths, and in virtue of the law of\r\nretaliation, the adulteress was given into the hands of the wife of her\r\nlover, if the latter was married. And if the lover had no children, his\r\ngoods were confiscated to the profit of the injured husband (lib. iii.).\r\n\r\nThe penalties ended by becoming entirely pecuniary, especially for\r\nthe man. The fifth section of the Salic law, and the thirty-fifth\r\nsection of the Ripuarian law, both inflict a fine of two hundred pence\r\non whoever abducts a married woman. A law of Charlemagne orders the\r\nravisher to restore the wife and all that she has carried off. If the\r\nhusband does not exact a composition, the sheriff takes up the matter,\r\nbanishes the guilty man, and condemns him to pay a fine of sixty pence.\r\nIn the Middle Ages the adulteress was generally shut up for life in\r\na convent, and lost her dowry. Whipping was sometimes added to these\r\npunishments, as is proved by an ordinance made in 1561.[718]\r\n\r\nThe laws of King John (1362), of Charles le Bel (1325), of Louis XI.\r\n(1463), show that certain towns preserved the old custom of making\r\nthe adulteress run naked through the city. Lastly, until 1789,\r\nlegislation, although moderating its severity, remains undecided,\r\nvaries according to place, circumstance, and even social position; but\r\nthe atrocious and coarse penalties of ancient times are abolished and\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. _Adultery in the Past and in the Future._\r\n\r\nLike all our ethnographical studies, this also affirms the law of\r\nprogress. We have seen savagery pass into barbarism, and barbarism into\r\ncivilisation. We have seen adultery punished at first as a robbery--but\r\na most execrable robbery--and the chastisement falling chiefly on\r\nthe woman as being a property in revolt. For her alone fidelity is\r\nobligatory. As to the adulterous husband, he is punished, if at all,\r\non the ground of having abused the property of another, and not in the\r\nleast because he has been unfaithful to his own wife. By slow degrees,\r\nhowever, equity asserts certain rights, and at the same time customs\r\nare humanised; marriage becomes less and less a “contract of slavery”\r\nfor the woman; and, in spite of the recoil caused by catholicism,\r\nprogress resumes its course, and we begin to foresee the time when,\r\nmarriage being instituted on rational and just foundations, adultery\r\nwill disappear, or nearly so, from our customs and our laws.\r\n\r\nBut surely that time is far distant. Our conscience is still so\r\nimpregnated with the morality of past ages that our public opinion and\r\nour juries willingly pardon a man who murders his adulterous wife,\r\nwhile they are full of mercy for the conjugal infidelities of this\r\nferocious justiciary. The antique morals which hold woman as a servile\r\nproperty belonging to her husband still live in many minds. They will\r\nbe extinguished by degrees. The matrimonial contract will end by\r\nbeing the same kind of contract as any other, freely accepted, freely\r\nmaintained, freely dissolved; but where constraint has disappeared\r\ndeception becomes an unworthy offence. Such will be the opinion of a\r\nfuture humanity, more elevated morally than ours. Doubtless it will\r\nhave no longer any tender indulgence for conveniently dissimulated\r\nadultery, but, on the other hand, it will no longer excuse the avenging\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[625] Diderot, _Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville, in Œuvres_, t.\r\nii. p. 245.\r\n\r\n[626] Bonwick, _Daily Life_, etc., p. 72.\r\n\r\n[627] Fison and Howitt, _Kamilaroi_, etc.\r\n\r\n[628] De Rochas, _Nouvelle Calédonie_, p. 262.\r\n\r\n[629] L.

In the lowest\r\nstage of savagery--as, for example, in Australia and Tasmania--woman,\r\nbeing exactly assimilated to a domestic animal, who can be beaten,\r\nwounded, killed, and even eaten, her association with man does not\r\nmerit the name of marriage, and consequently there is no question among\r\nthese races of divorce, nor even of repudiation. The man, being able,\r\nas master, to dispose of the life of his wife, has, in addition, the\r\nright to send her away, or abandon her, if he chooses.\r\n\r\nIn New Caledonia, where the stage of the most brutal savagery is past,\r\nwhere the wife is no longer carried off as in Australia, but bought\r\nfrom her legal owners, the dissolution of the conjugal union is still\r\nill-regulated. The man can chase away or repudiate his wife. The couple\r\ncan also part by mutual agreement, the children following sometimes\r\nthe mother and sometimes the father; nothing is uniform.[719] But the\r\npurchase of the woman protects her already somewhat against murder. As\r\nshe represents a capital, the husband often hesitates to kill her, or\r\neven to drive her away.\r\n\r\nThe Hottentots of the Damara tribe have on this point similar customs\r\nto the New Caledonians. They do not hesitate to send away the wives\r\nof whom they are tired, and whom they can replace.[720] In Caffraria\r\nthe husbands have also every right, without exception, over the wives\r\nthey have bought.[721] In middle Africa, which is much more civilised,\r\ndivorce and repudiation are rather less simple, and often give place to\r\nrestitutions or indemnities.\r\n\r\nWith the Bongos, in case of divorce, the father must give back a part\r\nof the utensils or fire-arms for which he had ceded his daughter. He is\r\neven forced to a total restitution, if the husband keeps the children\r\nwhile repudiating the wife. In the last case there is evidently an\r\nidea of indemnifying the husband for the charge he undertakes, and\r\nthis view of the matter is not uncommon in Africa.[722] Among the\r\nBongos marriage is considered as a simple commercial transaction; and\r\nit is the same in the whole of Central Africa, especially among the\r\nSoulimas, where the women have the power of leaving their husbands to\r\nunite themselves to another man, on the sole condition of returning\r\nto their husband-proprietor the sum that he has paid to purchase them\r\nfrom their parents. However, this rare and singular liberty is taken\r\nfrom them if they commit adultery. But even in this last case they are\r\ntreated with relative mildness.[723] As we have previously seen, the\r\nsame custom is observed among the Fantis of the Gold Coast, where\r\nthe woman who quits her husband without a serious reason, taking her\r\nchildren with her, need only pay him a fixed indemnity--four ackies\r\n(twenty-two shillings and sixpence) for each child.[724] In the same\r\nway the Ashantees consider children a value worth keeping; thus their\r\nwomen can re-marry after a three years’ absence of their husband; and\r\nin case of the traveller’s return, it is the second marriage which\r\nholds good, only all the children that are his become the property of\r\nthe first husband.[725] In fact, that equals an indemnity, since in\r\nAfrica children are generally considered as a commercial value.\r\n\r\nIn Polynesia the conjugal bond could be untied, as it was tied, with\r\nthe greatest ease. In the Marquesas Isles the husband and wife parted\r\nof mutual accord, in case of incompatibility of temper, and all was\r\nover; but if without his authorisation the wife deserted the conjugal\r\nhut to follow a lover, the husband watched for her and administered\r\nfurious and repeated corrections.[726] At Hawaï the marriage was\r\nalso dissolved at will, if the husband and wife were agreed on this\r\npoint.[727] At Tahiti the unions were of the frailest; the husband and\r\nwife parted without ceremony, and the children were no obstacle, for\r\nby a previous agreement they were made over to one or other of the\r\npartners.[728] It was the same in the Caroline Isles, where, though the\r\nrace was different, the customs were analogous, and married couples\r\ncould divorce themselves at will.[729]\r\n\r\nThis fragility of marriages is common in savage countries. The man\r\nalways has the right of repudiation, and very often the reciprocal\r\nright exists also. This fact seems even less rare among savages than it\r\nis later, at the middle period of the development of civilisation, when\r\nthe patriarchal family is solidly established.\r\n\r\nIn North America, meaning, of course, savage America, the classic\r\nland of the matriarchate, man nevertheless enjoys nearly always the\r\nright of repudiation, often without limits; but certain tribes either\r\nadmit divorce by mutual consent, or limit the right of repudiation,\r\nor recognise certain rights of the wife. The Malemoute Esquimaux\r\ndrive away their wives at will,[730] as do also the Kamtschatdales,\r\ntheir congeners of Asia;[731] but, with the Esquimaux, hardly any\r\nbut a free and capricious union is known; there is as yet no durable\r\nmarriage. It is nearly the same in a certain number of American\r\ntribes, where divorce is easy at the will of the two parties. Among\r\nthe Dakota Santals the wife who is ill treated by her companion has\r\nthe right to retire; but she cannot take the children without the\r\nhusband’s consent.[732] The marriage of the Iroquois, and of some other\r\nneighbouring tribes, was also broken by mutual consent. These Redskins\r\nlived in great common houses, each one inhabited by a fraction of the\r\ntribe, a _gens_, and consequently, that one of the divorced couple\r\nwhose relations dominated in the _gens_, remained there; the other was\r\nforced to depart.[733] The Redskins of California also practised this\r\neasy and mutual divorce.[734] The Navajos still recognised the right\r\nof the wife to leave her husband, but already the masculine point of\r\nhonour entered into play, and the deserted husband was obliged, under\r\npain of ridicule, to revenge himself by killing some one.[735] At\r\nGuatemala the wife and husband could part at will and on the slightest\r\npretext.[736] The Moxos of South America only regarded marriage as an\r\nagreement that could be dissolved by the will of the two parties.[737]\r\nBut in many other Redskin tribes the right of divorce seems far from\r\nbeing reciprocal; it is replaced, to the detriment of the wife, by\r\nrepudiation, which the husband can pronounce with a word. According to\r\nthe Abbé Domenech, it is the fear of this terrible word which maintains\r\nan appearance of harmony among the many women in the interior of the\r\nIndian wigwams.[738] With the Chippeways a man takes or buys a girl of\r\ntwelve, and sends her back when he is tired of her.[739] The Chinook\r\nhusband can also repudiate his wife according to his caprice.[740]\r\nIn a tribe of the Nahuas, the husbands enjoyed the same rights, but\r\non condition of exercising them on the day after the marriage; the\r\nexperimental union preceded the durable one.[741] In New Mexico, the\r\nhusband repudiated at will, on condition only of restoring his wife’s\r\npossessions.[742] A single word of the Caribean husbands also sufficed\r\nto dismiss the wife.[743] The same rule is found with the Abipones\r\nalso, where the husband can repudiate his wife on the slightest\r\npretext.[744]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to be drawn from all these facts is, that there are no\r\nmore fixed rules for divorce than for marriage in savage societies.\r\nBut, as the wife is more often bought or captured, it is quite natural\r\nthat her owner should send her away at his pleasure. Wherever divorce\r\nis mutual, it is when the wife costs little to obtain, or where the\r\nties of relationship are well defined between the members of her and\r\nher tribe, or her _gens_, who then think themselves bound to afford her\r\na certain protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Divorce and Repudiation among Barbarous Peoples._\r\n\r\nThese free and fragile marriages are found in societies more civilised\r\nthan those of the Polynesians and the American Indians. Bruce tells us\r\nthat in Abyssinia marriage is in reality only a free union, without any\r\nsanction or ceremony; couples unite, part, and re-unite as many times\r\nas they like. There are neither legitimate nor illegitimate children.\r\nIn case of divorce the children are divided; the girls belong to the\r\nfather, and the boys to the mother.[745]\r\n\r\nM. d’Abbadie affirms also that Abyssinian marriage is purely civil\r\nand always dissoluble; he adds that it is dotal, and co-exists, for\r\nrich men, with the concubinate.[746] It is quite certain that divorce\r\nis largely used in Abyssinia, since Bruce says he has seen a woman\r\nsurrounded with seven former husbands. In Hayti, the only negro country\r\nthat is civilised in European fashion, we find either preserved or\r\ninstituted, by the side of legal monogamic marriage, free unions which\r\nrecall the Roman concubinate. The persons thus paired are called\r\n“placed”; they suffer no contempt on this account, and their children\r\nhave the same rights as those of persons legally married. There are at\r\nHayti ten times more “placed” persons than married ones; they separate\r\nless often than the latter are divorced, and have better morals.[747]\r\nBut in general the free union, or, what comes to the same thing, the\r\npower of divorce, left to the two united parties, is rare enough in\r\ncountries more or less civilised. Most usually it is the husband who,\r\neven without any cause of adultery in the wife, has the right to\r\nrepudiate her. It is thus, for example, at Madagascar, where, in order\r\nto repudiate his wife, a husband need simply declare his resolution to\r\nthe magistrate who has received the notification of the marriage; it\r\nis only necessary for him to pay for the second time the _hasina_, or\r\nduty on marriage. When once he has declared his intention, the husband\r\nhas still twelve days’ grace to retract it; but if he exceeds this\r\ndelay the repudiated wife becomes her own mistress and free to marry\r\nagain.[748]\r\n\r\nIn Kordofan, among the Djebel-Taggale,[749] the great legal motive for\r\nrepudiation in all the primitive legislations, sterility, justified\r\nproceedings that were absolutely savage. The ceremony was called the\r\n_nefir_ (drum or trumpet). A woman being apparently sterile, the\r\nhusband, before repudiating her, called noisily together all his male\r\nrelatives, who, after a feast, all had intimacy with the barren wife.\r\nIf this heroic expedient did not result in pregnancy, the husband sold\r\nhis wife by auction, agreeing to return to his obliging relatives the\r\ndifference, if any, between the first price and the sum she would fetch\r\nin the auction. Extraordinary as this custom of _nefir_ may seem to\r\nus, it is, apart from the final sale, but the repetition with more\r\nshamelessness of analogous practices in India, and even in ancient\r\nGreece, in case of well-proved sterility in the wife.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouins and the Touaregs in general have nothing comparable to the\r\n_nefir_ of the Djebel-Taggale, but among them the extreme facility and\r\nexcessive frequency of repudiations renders marriage nearly illusory.\r\nAccording to Burckhardt, repudiation is so common with the former that\r\na man sometimes has fifty wives in succession.[750] With the Touaregs\r\nof the Sahara the wives themselves can demand divorce, and we have\r\nseen that they thus force their husbands to bend to monogamy, in spite\r\nof the Koran and of their polygamic appetites.[751] It seems that in\r\ncertain of their tribes the women make it a point of honour to be often\r\nrepudiated. Only to have one husband is, in their eyes, a humiliating\r\nthing, and they are heard to say: “Thou art not worth anything; thou\r\nhast neither beauty nor merit; men have disdained thee, and would have\r\nnone of thee.”[752]\r\n\r\nThis is quite in accord with the _laisser aller_ habitual to the\r\nprimitive Berbers in regard to marriage. In this respect, however, our\r\nKabyles of Algeria contrast with the other ethnic groups of their race.\r\nTheir conjugal customs are most rigid; neither liberty nor libertinage\r\nexist for the wife amongst them. Their customs in regard to repudiation\r\nand divorce are consequently very curious, and are worth studying in\r\ndetail. In Kabyle, marriage is treated literally as a commercial affair\r\nof the most serious kind, especially for the women, who are owned as\r\nthings by their husbands. The customs and the _Kanouns_, however,\r\nforbid the exchange of wives, and the husband whose wife has fled from\r\nthe conjugal dwelling is forbidden to sell the fugitive except to a man\r\nof the tribe, and even then he is not allowed to have the price.[753]\r\nStill, the Kabyle husband has preserved the right of repudiation, and\r\nthis right he alone enjoys, and without restriction.\r\n\r\nThere are in Kabyle two kinds of repudiation. In one, the husband\r\nsimply says, “I repudiate thee;” and he repeats this formula three\r\ntimes. The wife remains dependent on him until he sells her by means\r\nof a price of redemption. If he accepts from the father or some other\r\nman this price (_lefdi_) he must, when the sum is once counted out,\r\ndeclare before witnesses that he gives up all rights over his wife.\r\nThen, and only then, the marriage is dissolved.[754] Under the other\r\nform of repudiation the husband says, “I repudiate thee, and I put such\r\na sum on thy head.” The formula is pronounced once, twice, and thrice.\r\nIn this case the husband is irrevocably bound, and by paying the sum\r\nfixed, the wife has the power to marry again; at the same time, the\r\nhusband can specify the conditions, can say, for example, that if the\r\nwoman is married to such or such a man, the price of redemption will be\r\ndoubled or tripled. Sometimes the sum is so great that it amounts to\r\nan absolute interdiction of any fresh marriage, and the woman is then\r\ndesignated “a prevented one” (_thamaouok’t_).[755] When the formula of\r\nrepudiation has only been pronounced once or twice, the husband can,\r\nby means of a fine paid to the _djemâa_, and with the consent of the\r\nfather-in-law, take back his wife; but he loses his reputation, and his\r\ntestimony is no longer legal. If the formula has been pronounced three\r\ntimes, it is irrevocable. As for the other revocation, public opinion\r\ndoes not admit that it may be revocable, unless it has only been\r\ndeclared once, and that the husband find a priest who will consecrate a\r\nfresh union.[756]\r\n\r\nIf, after repudiation, the Kabyle woman marries again, and becomes a\r\nwidow, the first husband can retake her without repayment and without a\r\nfine.[757]\r\n\r\nWithout pronouncing the formula of repudiation, the Kabyle husband has\r\nthe power to send his wife back to her family, with the consent of the\r\nsaid family. If the husband has serious reasons of displeasure he sends\r\nher to her parents without forewarning them, mounted on an ass, and\r\nconducted by a servant or a negro. This treatment is so ignominious\r\nfor the wife that it is equal to repudiation, and public opinion then\r\nforbids the husband to take her back. Sometimes, in case of proved\r\nadultery, the husband sends the wife back to her family, after having\r\nshaved her head; the guilty one is then for ever dishonoured, and\r\nhowever beautiful she may be, she never finds another husband.[758]\r\n\r\nIn case of repudiation, for any motive whatever, the Kabyle husband\r\nhas the right to keep all his children, girls and boys, even those\r\nat the breast.[759] As for the repudiated woman, she always returns\r\nto her parents, and it is to these last that a man must apply to\r\nmarry her; but the new marriage cannot be concluded until after the\r\npayment to the first husband of the price of the redemption (_lefdi_),\r\nwhich is sometimes more, sometimes less, than the _thâmanth_, or\r\nprice of the first acquisition. Generally, too, the parents profit\r\nby the opportunity to claim a supplement, or gratification. The\r\nfather often agrees first with the husband, reimburses him for the\r\n_thâmanth_, and afterwards negotiates his daughter as he pleases. In\r\na certain number of tribes the husband can directly sell his wife,\r\nbut Kabyle morality reproves this practice,[760] and permits the wife\r\nin that case to retire to her father, where she remains “prevented”\r\n(_thamaouok’t_); however, if the father is powerful, he risks sometimes\r\nmarrying his daughter, and the tribe at need stands by him.[761] In\r\nany case, the repudiated Kabyle woman can only marry after a delay\r\n(_aidda_), generally of four months,[762] which is conformable to the\r\nprescriptions of the Koran. If she flees the country, the parents\r\nmust restore to the husband the _thâmanth_ or _lefdi_, for this\r\nlast can no longer gain them a new suitor.[763] The whole of this\r\n_régime_ is very partial to the husband. However, as public opinion\r\nin Kabyle is sovereign, it has decreed a few protective measures for\r\nwoman, recalling from afar the proverbial liberality of the Berbers\r\nin conjugal matters. Thus, though the woman is deprived of the right\r\nof divorce, she is allowed a “right of insurrection” if she has just\r\ncomplaints to make. In this case she begins by telling one of her\r\nrelatives, who fetches her back to her father openly, the husband not\r\nbeing permitted to oppose; it remains to him either to repudiate the\r\nfugitive or to let her be a “prevented one.” It is understood that\r\ncustom protects an “insurgent” wife only when she takes refuge with her\r\nrelatives.[764] Some tribes have tariffed the _thâmanth_; and in case\r\nof repudiation the husband can only exact or receive the ordained sum.\r\nAs for the tariff of the repudiated woman, it is nearly always more\r\nthan the _thâmanth_, or price of the virgin and the widow. This is done\r\ncounting on the avidity of the husband, to urge him to permit a fresh\r\nmarriage.[765] Lastly, it is the rule that after four years’ absence\r\non the part of the husband the union is dissolved and the woman is\r\nfree.[766] This is a wise law which certain European codes might borrow\r\nwith advantage from Kabyle legislation.\r\n\r\nIt is a veritable godsend for scientific sociology to be able to know\r\nin its minute details all this curious regulation of Kabyle marriage.\r\nToo often we are forced to content ourselves, in regard to savage or\r\nbarbarous peoples, with general assertions that have to be completed\r\nas well as may be from accounts that are incoherent, sometimes\r\ncontradictory, and always fragmentary. Here we possess a whole\r\nbarbarous code, quite an assemblage of old Berber customs, which are\r\nmore or less confounded with the precepts of the Koran.\r\n\r\nThe law of Mahomet itself is only a sort of compromise between the\r\nancient customs of Arabia and the Biblical precepts relating to\r\nmarriage. On certain sides the Arab customs are superior to the\r\nseverity of the Kabyle kanouns, but on others they are inferior to\r\nthem, as, for example, in not affording to the wife the right of\r\n“insurrection.”\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to distinguish between the text of the Koran and\r\npractice, which has notably departed from it--sometimes for the\r\nbetter, sometimes for the worse. The Koran leaves to the husband\r\nthe absolute right of repudiation. It orders that if the formula of\r\nrepudiation has been pronounced three times, the husband cannot take\r\nback the wife until she has been married to another; it permits him\r\nto do it, therefore, in the contrary case.[767] It specifies that the\r\nrepudiated wife should have a sufficient maintenance provided for\r\nher, and that the husband should not keep the dower she brought with\r\nher;[768] that the husband should have four months’ grace to retract\r\nhis decision;[769] that if the repudiated wife is suckling an infant,\r\nthe husband, or, in his default, the next heir, should supply her needs\r\nduring the two years that the suckling should last.[770]\r\n\r\nThe Koran orders repudiated wives not to re-marry before three\r\nmenstrual periods, not to dissimulate their pregnancy, “if they believe\r\nin God and in the day of judgment;” and in the last case it advises the\r\nhusbands to take them back.[771] Lastly, the law of Mahomet encourages\r\namicable arrangements, and these by money payments between ill-assorted\r\ncouples; it authorises the husband to sell a divorce to his wife for a\r\ncession, with her consent, of a portion of her dowry.[772] This is what\r\nthe texts, which are both legal and sacred, declare: this, then, is the\r\ntheory. We will now see what is the practice as regards repudiation and\r\ndivorce in Algeria at the present time.\r\n\r\nThere are three graduated formulas of repudiation: first, the\r\ndiscontented husband says simply to the wife, “Go away,” and if he\r\nhas only said it once or twice, he may retract his decision; second,\r\nbut if he has said, “Thou art to me as one dead, or as the flesh of\r\nswine,” it is forbidden to take back the repudiated wife until she has\r\nbeen married to another, and then repudiated or left a widow; lastly,\r\nthere is a formula so solemn that it entails a separation for ever; it\r\nis this, “Let thy back be turned on me henceforth, like the back of my\r\nmother.”[773]\r\n\r\nAny one of these senseless reasons, which have often the force of law\r\nwith unenlightened races, can be set aside, and the repudiation counted\r\nnull when it has been pronounced during a critical period of the\r\nwoman.[774] The woman with child, on the contrary, can be repudiated,\r\nbut she has a right to an “allowance during pregnancy.”[775] Actual\r\ncustom also admits voluntary divorce, at the proposal of the wife, for\r\na redemption paid by her to her master. Sometimes the initiative comes\r\nfrom the husband, who, knowing that his wife desires her liberty, says\r\nto her, “I repudiate thee, if thou givest me this _pallium_ of Herat,\r\nor this horse, or this camel,” etc. It is then a sort of divorce by\r\nmutual consent, and the two part as good friends.[776]\r\n\r\nLastly, there is obligatory divorce, pronounced by the Cadi, on the\r\nplaint of the woman, when the husband is impotent, when in spite of\r\nthese matrimonial conventions he tries to compel the woman to quit\r\nthe house of her parents, or when he has corrected her with excessive\r\nbrutality.[777] Then the divorced wife goes away, taking her dowry with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTaken altogether, these customs, while conforming to the spirit of\r\nthe Koran, have in a certain measure improved the position of the\r\nmarried woman. This is because progress is the law of the social as\r\nwell as the organic world; more or less slowly, more or less quickly,\r\nit ends by modifying in practice even theocratic legislations, which\r\nare the most rigid of all. But the old customs are still found almost\r\nintact in certain districts of Arabia which have remained more or less\r\ncompletely isolated. Thus in nearly all Arab countries there is one\r\nespecial reason which justifies immediate repudiation of the marriage,\r\nand that is the absence of virginity, when it has been affirmed in\r\nthe agreements preceding the union. But in Yemen this circumstance\r\njustifies far more than mere repudiation; it excuses the murder of the\r\nbride;[778] it is a practical return to the old law preserved in the\r\nBible ordering the guilty woman to be stoned.\r\n\r\nAfter the manner of all barbarous legislations, that of Mahomet has\r\ncorrected, or at least tried to restrain, certain especially ferocious\r\ncustoms; but, on the other hand, it has given the force of law to\r\nsome particularly crying abuses, and has thus rendered them more\r\ndifficult of redress. This is generally the case. In all barbarous\r\nsocieties the subjection of woman is more or less severe; customs or\r\ncoarse laws have regulated the savagery of the first anarchic ages;\r\nthey have doubtless set up a barrier against primitive ferocity, they\r\nhave interdicted certain absolutely terrible abuses of force, but they\r\nhave only replaced these by a servitude which is still very heavy,\r\nis often iniquitous, and no longer permits to legally possessed women\r\nthose escapes, or capriciously accorded liberties, which were tolerated\r\nin savage life. We shall have to prove this fact more than once in\r\ncontinuing our ethnographic study of divorce in barbarous societies.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Peru the liberal and reasonable custom of divorce by mutual\r\nconsent was adopted.[779] At Quito, at least, where marriage was not\r\ncivil and obligatory, the married pair had the power of separating by\r\nmutual accord.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico divorce was merely tolerated. Before being allowed to break\r\nthe conjugal tie, the couple were obliged to submit their differences\r\nto a special tribunal, which, after a minute examination of the facts,\r\nand three hearings of the parties, sent them away without pronouncing\r\njudgment, if they persevered in their design.[780] The tribunal could,\r\nit seems, forbid the separation, but it did not expressly authorise it.\r\nIts silence, however, equalled a sentence of divorce.\r\n\r\nThis luxury of legality, this pretence of placing the conjugal union\r\nout of reach of the caprice or injustice of one of the parties, can\r\nonly be met with in societies already advanced in organisation.\r\n\r\nIn lamaic Thibet, where marriage is a simple civil convention, with\r\nwhich the theocratic government of the country does not interfere,\r\nmarriages are dissolved, as they are made, by mere mutual consent;\r\nbut this consent is necessary, and there only results a separation\r\nanalogous to ours, and taking from the separated couple the power to\r\nre-marry.[781] With the nomad Mongols we find, in spite of a relative\r\ncivilisation, the absolute right of repudiation left to the husband\r\nalone, as it is in savage countries. The Mongol husband who is tired\r\nof his wife, whom, besides, he has purchased, can send her back to her\r\nparents without giving the least reason; he simply loses the oxen,\r\nsheep, and horses that he has paid for her. On their side, the parents\r\nmake no difficulty of taking her back, for they have the right to sell\r\nher again. The Mongol wife can also spontaneously quit her husband;\r\nbut this is not so simple a matter, because she represents a value.\r\nIt is a capital that has fled; therefore the parents must send her\r\nback four times following to the husband-proprietor. If the latter\r\npersists in not receiving her, the marriage is dissolved, but in that\r\ncase the parents must restore a part of the cattle previously paid\r\nby the marital purchaser.[782] In short, repudiation and divorce are\r\nconsidered in Mongolia entirely as commercial transactions, and always\r\narranged for the advantage of the husband.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have regulated this still quite primitive divorce, and\r\nwhile leaving to the husband the right of repudiation, they have\r\ncarefully specified the conditions of it.\r\n\r\nA Chinese husband can repudiate his wife for adultery, sterility,\r\nimmodesty, disobedience to her father and mother or to him, loquacity\r\nor propensity to slander, inclination to theft, a jealous disposition,\r\nor an incurable malady. These motives, however, no longer suffice when\r\nthe wife has worn mourning for her father-in-law or her mother-in-law;\r\nwhen the family has become rich in comparison with its former poverty;\r\nand lastly, when the wife has no longer a father or mother to receive\r\nher. If, heedless of these interdictions, the husband repudiates his\r\nwife all the same, he becomes liable to receive eighty strokes of\r\nbamboo, and must take her back.[783] To the husband alone belongs the\r\nright of repudiation, but the law admits divorce by mutual consent. On\r\nthe other hand, it has taken good care to consecrate the servitude of\r\nthe wife by ordering that if she flees from the conjugal abode when\r\nthe husband refuses a divorce, she shall be punished by a hundred\r\nstrokes of bamboo, and may be sold by her husband to any one willing to\r\nmarry her.[784] Chinese legislation absolutely refuses the “right of\r\ninsurrection” to the wife, which the Kabyle _Kanouns_, rigorous as they\r\nare to women, have granted. For divorce, as for everything else, China\r\nis at the stage of mitigated or humane barbarism. The foundation of\r\nher laws has remained savage, but a less ancient spirit has attempted\r\nto modify their severity. It has limited the right of repudiation, at\r\nfirst in the power of the master; it has specified the impediments;\r\nlastly, it has sanctioned divorce by mutual consent, which still\r\nterrifies our legislators.\r\n\r\nAncient India had also left the right of repudiation to the husband,\r\nbut she had no place for divorce in her legislation, and had imposed no\r\nrestriction on the good pleasure of the husband if there existed one\r\nof the cases enumerated by the Code:--“A wife given to intoxicating\r\nliquors, having bad morals, given to contradicting her husband,\r\nattacked with an incurable disease, as leprosy, or who has been\r\nspendthrift of his wealth, ought to be replaced by another.” “A sterile\r\nwife ought to be replaced in the eighth year; the wife whose children\r\nare all dead, in the tenth year; the wife who only bears daughters, in\r\nthe eleventh; the wife who speaks with bitterness, instantly.”[785]\r\n“For one whole year let a husband bear with the aversion of his wife;\r\nbut after a year, if she continues to hate him, let him take what she\r\npossesses, only giving her enough to clothe and feed her, and let him\r\ncease to cohabit with her.”[786]\r\n\r\nHere it is no longer a question of divorce by mutual consent, nor\r\nof protective measures for the wife. If she is legally replaced\r\nwithout being repudiated, and then if she abandons with anger the\r\nconjugal abode, she must be imprisoned or repudiated in the presence\r\nof witnesses.[787] The prolonged absence of the husband does not set\r\nfree the wife, even when she has been left without resources. She\r\nmust patiently await the return of the absent master, during eight\r\nyears if he is gone for a pious motive; six years if he is travelling\r\nfor science or glory; three years if he is roaming the world for his\r\npleasure. When these delays have expired, the deserted one is none the\r\nless married; she has only the power to go to seek the traveller.[788]\r\n\r\nLike the writers of the Code of Manu, those of the Bible have thought\r\nvery little of the rights of woman in legislating on divorce and\r\nrepudiation.\r\n\r\nThe book of Deuteronomy, very accommodating for the husband, authorises\r\nhim to repudiate his wife “when she find no favour in his eyes, because\r\nhe hath found some uncleanness in her;” he has only to put a “letter\r\nof divorce” in her hand, and may not take her again, either if she\r\nis repudiated by another husband or becomes a widow.[789] With much\r\nstronger reason a man can repudiate an immodest wife.[790] As for\r\nthe wife, she could only demand a divorce for very grave causes: if\r\nthe husband was attacked by a contagious malady (leprosy); if his\r\noccupations were too repugnant; if he deceived her; if he _habitually_\r\nill-treated her; if he refused to contribute to her maintenance; and\r\nif, after ten years of marriage, his impotence was well established,\r\nespecially if the woman declared she needed a son to sustain her in her\r\nold age.[791] But even then it was the husband who was reputed to have\r\nsent away his wife, and she lost her dowry.\r\n\r\nAll these antique legislations bear on the woman with shameful\r\niniquity. The most humane have confined their efforts to placing a few\r\nslight restrictions on the brutal good pleasure of man, which nothing\r\nholds back in savage societies. But it is important to notice that\r\ncertain tribes, still more or less buried in savagery, have regulated\r\ndivorce with humanity enough and equity enough to put to shame the\r\ntheocratic legislators of the great barbarian societies.\r\n\r\nWe discover again this iniquitous spirit in regard to the respective\r\nsituations of the man and the woman in marriage in the Greco-Roman\r\nworld, but it becomes moderated as ancient civilisation progresses.\r\nIn primitive Greece the right of repudiation is left to the man, and\r\nhe uses it whenever he thinks he has legitimate motives for doing\r\nso.[792] This right continued in more civilised Greece, but it was\r\ngradually restricted. Nevertheless, it was always a great dishonour\r\nfor a woman to be repudiated. Euripides makes Medea say, “Divorce is\r\nalways shameful for a woman.” In _Andromachus_, Menelaus, speaking of\r\nhis daughter Hermione, said: “I will not that my daughter should be\r\ndriven from the nuptial bed; save that, all that a woman can suffer\r\nis relatively without importance; but for her to lose her husband is\r\nto lose her life.” At Athens repudiations were frequent, and they\r\nwould have been more so if considerations of interest had not often\r\nhindered the good pleasure of the master. He was obliged, in fact, by\r\nthe conditions of the law, in repudiating his wife, to restore her\r\ndowry, or pay interest at the rate of nine oboles.[793] Moreover, the\r\nrelatives who were guardians of the woman could claim by law a pension\r\nfor her maintenance.[794] A personage of Euripides cries mournfully:\r\n“The riches that a wife brings only serve to make her divorce more\r\ndifficult.”[795] However, the right of divorce was recognised for\r\nwomen, but custom held the laws in check by rendering it difficult\r\nfor wives to perform any public action, and by imposing on them the\r\nconfinement of the gyneceum.[796]\r\n\r\nAt Rome divorce evolved more rapidly and more completely than in\r\nGreece. In primitive Rome we see at first, as usual, the right\r\nof repudiation allowed to the husband and forbidden to the wife.\r\n“Romulus,” says Plutarch, “gave the husband power to divorce his\r\nwife in case of her poisoning his children, or counterfeiting his\r\nkeys, or committing adultery, and if on any other account he put her\r\naway she was to have one moiety of his goods, and the other was to\r\nbe consecrated to Ceres.”[797] The Roman husband could also put away\r\nhis wife for sterility.[798] He was, however, obliged to assemble the\r\nfamily beforehand for consultation. If the marriage had been contracted\r\nby confarreation it had to be dissolved by a contradictory ceremony,\r\ndiffarreation.[799] In the ancient law, when the crime of the woman led\r\nto divorce, she lost all her dowry. Later, only a sixth was kept back\r\nby adultery, and an eighth for other crimes.[800] At length divorce by\r\nconsent (_bonâ gratiâ_) was introduced in spite of the censors; and\r\nthen both parties had liberty of divorce, only with certain pecuniary\r\ndisadvantages for the husband whose fault led to the divorce. Thus the\r\nadulterous husband lost advantage of the terms which usage accorded for\r\nthe restitution of the dowry. In the last stage of the law the guilty\r\nhusband lost the dowry, or the _donatio propter nuptias_. Inversely,\r\nif the wife divorced without a cause, the husband retained a sixth\r\nof the dowry for each child, but only up to three-sixths.[801] The\r\nformula of the Roman repudiation recalls by its energetic conciseness\r\nthe Kabyle formula, and it seems especially to relate to the property:\r\n_Res tuas habeto_.[802] The wife, even though subjected to the _manus_,\r\nobtained at last the power of divorce, by sending the _repudium_ to her\r\nhusband, who was then forced to set her free from the _manus_.[803] In\r\nshort, divorce became in time very easy. Cicero repudiated his wife\r\nTerentia in order to get a new dowry. Augustus forced the husband of\r\nLivia to put her away, although she was with child. Seneca speaks of\r\nwomen counting their years, not according to the Consuls, but to the\r\nnumber of their husbands. Juvenal quotes a woman who was married eight\r\ntimes in five years. St. Jerome mentions another who, after having had\r\ntwenty-three husbands, married a man who had had twenty-three wives.\r\n\r\nConstantine, humbly obedient to the Christian spirit which had invaded\r\nhis base soul, restricted the cases of divorce to three for each\r\nspouse, but always admitted mutual consent, and under Justinian the\r\nfull liberty of divorce reappeared in the Code.[804]\r\n\r\nFrom its origin Christianity combatted the morals called pagan, which\r\nname even was a reproach. Abandoning the modest reality, it lost anchor\r\nfrom the first, and was drowned in a sea of dreams. Marriage, instead\r\nof being simply the union of a man and a woman in order to produce\r\nchildren, became mystic; it was the symbol of the union of Christ\r\nwith his church; it was tolerated only, and the church especially\r\ncondemned divorce. Nevertheless, custom and good sense held out a\r\nlong time against ecclesiastical unreason, and it was very slowly, in\r\nthe twelfth century only, that the civil law prohibited divorce.[805]\r\nSt. Jerome had allowed, as did afterwards the Christians of the East,\r\nthat adultery broke the bond of marriage as well for the woman as\r\nthe man, which is simply just; but this sentiment was condemned and\r\nanathematised by the Council of Trent,[806] which thus returned,\r\ncontrary to the opinion of Papinian and the ancient jurists, to savage\r\ncustoms, which make the wife the slave, and not the companion, of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nAmong the Germans and the Scandinavians, the man alone had the right\r\nof repudiation according to the almost universal usage of barbarous\r\npeoples; however, divorce by mutual consent was tolerated.[807] The\r\nSalic law also permitted divorce, and we find in Marculphus the form\r\nof an act of divorce by mutual consent. “The husband and wife, such\r\nand such a one, seeing that discord troubles their marriage and that\r\nlove does not rule in it, have agreed to separate, and leave each other\r\nmutually free, without opposition from either party, under pain of a\r\nfine of one pound.”\r\n\r\nThe pagan Irish had rendered divorce useless by instituting marriages\r\nof one year, at the end of which the wife could be repudiated by the\r\ntemporary husband and even ceded to another for a fresh year. These\r\nexperimental marriages were made or unmade, sometimes on the first of\r\nMay, and sometimes on the first of November of each year.[808]\r\n\r\nRepudiations at the will of the husband are still in use among the\r\nTcherkesses of the Caucasus, whose customs have more than one feature\r\nin common with those of our ancestors of barbarous Europe. With them\r\nthe husband can repudiate in two manners: either by sending away\r\nhis wife in the presence of witnesses, and leaving the dowry to the\r\nparents, which implies the liberty to marry again for the repudiated\r\nwife; or by simply driving the wife away, and then he can recall her\r\nagain during one year.[809]\r\n\r\nIn France, under the two first races, the man could put away the\r\nwoman; he could even, which is more rare and original, repudiate his\r\nfamily, and leave it, after a declaration before the judge, and this\r\ndestroyed all rights of inheritance on both sides. Later, under the\r\ninfluence of the Catholic clergy, who by reason, no doubt, of their\r\nwant of practical experience in the “things of the flesh,” claimed\r\nenergetically the right of regulating all conjugal questions, a\r\ndistinction was made between the separation of abode (_quoad thorum_)\r\nand complete divorce (_quoad vinculum_); the first only was permitted.\r\nThe Church, always assuming to be immutable, maintained in theory the\r\nindissolubility of the sacramental marriage, and it needed the great\r\nmovement of the French Revolution to shake for a moment the Catholic\r\nprejudice against divorce, which was incompletely re-established in\r\nour French code a few years ago. But the brutality of our ancient\r\nconjugal customs survives still, and they are not up to the level of\r\nour legislation, imperfect as that is. Many husbands always treat their\r\nwives as slaves, against whom everything is lawful, since in a hundred\r\nsuits for separation or divorce there are ninety-one to ninety-three\r\nmade by wives on account of cruelties and serious injuries.[810] Above\r\nall, our juries almost invariably acquit the husband who has murdered\r\nhis adulterous wife. So difficult is it to “put off the old man.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Evolution of Divorce._\r\n\r\nOur various researches on the subject of divorce have led us to nearly\r\nuniform conclusions. They all show us that, however dissimilar may be\r\nthe countries or the epochs, the union of man and woman begins, with\r\nvery rare exceptions, by the complete slavery of the latter, and her\r\nassimilation to domestic animals, over which man has all possible\r\nrights, _a fortiori_ that of driving away. Then as the ages move on\r\ntheir course we see societies which become by degrees civilised, and\r\nin proportion to this advance the condition of the woman improves.\r\nAt first the man could kill her if she displeased him; then, cases\r\nof adultery apart, he contented himself with repudiating her; next,\r\nthe severity of this right of repudiation, at first unlimited, was\r\nmitigated; then it was restricted to certain well-defined cases;\r\nsome rights were even granted to the repudiated woman. At length\r\nher own right was recognised to seek divorce in order to escape\r\nfrom intolerable treatment. At last a return was made to divorce by\r\nmutual consent, which had been allowed in a good number of primitive\r\nsocieties, before a rigid legislation, generally theocratic, had\r\ncrystallised, in codifying them, some of the old barbarous customs.\r\nThe Catholic prejudice itself, absurd as it was in regard to marriage,\r\nbecame humanised by time. Doubtless the Church continued in principle\r\nto condemn divorce, but she allowed a good number of cases of nullity\r\nof marriage, undoing thus with one hand what she attempted to build up\r\nwith the other, and, willingly or not, compounding and compromising\r\nwith “the world.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[719] Moncelon, _Réponses au Questionnaire de Sociologie_, in _Bull. de\r\nla Soc. d’anthrop._, 1886.\r\n\r\n[720] Campbell, _Hist.

It is one of those questions of social\r\norganisation hardly noticed by the travellers to whom we look\r\nespecially for information.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we may affirm that widowhood, regarded as a special\r\ncondition recognised by customs and laws, does not exist in very\r\nanarchic societies. Voltaire has somewhere said that the origin of\r\ndivorce was doubtless posterior by some days to that of marriage. With\r\nmuch stronger reason may we infer that the existence of some kind of\r\nmarriage is necessary before there can be any widowhood. Widowhood,\r\ntherefore, does not exist in societies where promiscuity or temporary\r\nmarriage prevails. No widowhood is possible, for example, in the tribe\r\nof the Australian Kamilaroi, where all the women of a class are common\r\nto all the men of the same class. It became otherwise from the time\r\nthat, either by capture, purchase, or any other means, woman became\r\nthe particular property of one man. Thenceforth it was necessary to\r\nregulate in some way the condition of the widow or widows. Generally\r\nthe solution of the problem has been very simple: the widow, who has\r\nbeen habitually captured or bought by the deceased, does not cease\r\nafter his death to be regarded as a thing or property; she is part of\r\nthe inheritance, by the same title as chattels or domestic animals.\r\nSometimes, however, special obligations or troubles are imposed on\r\nher; Kolben tells us that in passing to a fresh husband, the Hottentot\r\nwidow must cut off a joint of the little finger; but to cut off a\r\nfinger-joint was a common custom with the Hottentots on the death of\r\na relative, and the women did it, or were forced to do it, more often\r\nthan the men. There is nothing in this particular to the condition\r\nof the widow.[811] At the Gaboon a man’s wives belonged to his heir,\r\nand if the deceased was of importance in the tribe, they must resign\r\nthemselves to a period of mourning and of widowhood, which lasts a year\r\nor two. The end of this mourning is marked by a great festival or orgy,\r\nwhich Du Chaillu has thus described--“The wives of the deceased (he had\r\nseven) were radiant ... they were going to quit their widow’s clothes\r\nand join the festival like brides. The heir had the right to marry them\r\nall, but to show his generosity, he had ceded two to a younger brother\r\nand one to a cousin.” They drank bumper after bumper (palm wine), and\r\nthen began to dance. “The wives danced. But what dances! The most\r\nmodest step was indecent.”[812]\r\n\r\nIn equatorial Africa, the son inherits the widows of his father: it\r\nis thus in Yarriba.[813] Sometimes they are sold simply, if they have\r\nhad no children by the deceased husband.[814] In Kouranko, widows\r\nhave a milder fate. They are numerous; for, as young girls, they have\r\ngenerally been sold by their parents to old husbands; but according\r\nto Laing, the custom of the country renders them free, and makes them\r\ntheir own mistresses as soon as they are widows, and they profit by\r\nthis immediately to choose themselves a young husband, and lavish cares\r\nand attentions on him; it is then their turn.[815] Nevertheless, the\r\ncustom of classing widows with the heritage seems very general in negro\r\nAfrica. It exists with the Bambarras of Kaarta, where, at the death\r\nof a prince, his successor puts the wives of the deceased monarch up\r\nto auction. Even if old and horrible, they sell easily and dear, for\r\nmen like the honour of succeeding to a king.[816] We shall find the\r\nsame usage again in Madagascar, at least in the noble families of the\r\nHovas. On ascending the throne, Radama simply kept all his father’s\r\nwives. So obligatory is this on the reigning sovereign, that at the\r\ndeath of the same Radama, his widow Ranavalo was bound to keep, by the\r\ntitle of _wives_, all her husband’s widows. Then, in a great council\r\nheld after her elevation to the throne, it was decided that the Queen\r\nRanavalo could not marry again, but would be free to take lovers at her\r\nwill, and that all the children born of these fugitive unions should\r\nbe considered as the legitimate posterity of Radama.[817] By this\r\ningenious measure all was conciliated--respect to custom, the liberty\r\nof the queen, and the regular succession to the throne.\r\n\r\nWe shall find again in very different countries this savage custom of\r\nconsidering widows as a simple property, transmissible by inheritance.\r\nSometimes the heir succeeds simply to the deceased husband; sometimes\r\nhe accepts and exacts an indemnity, in case the widow re-marries. Such\r\nwas already the custom with the Smoos of Central America. There the\r\nwidows belonged by right to the relatives of the deceased husband;\r\nand in order to contract afresh, they had to pay to these relatives\r\nwhat was called “widow money.”[818] Inversely, with the Kliketats, if\r\na woman happened to die very soon after her marriage, the husband who\r\nhad bought her could claim her price back from the parents;[819] he had\r\nbeen deceived in the quality of the merchandise.\r\n\r\nThis was not all; as long as the mourning lasted, the widow was always\r\nconsidered, in certain districts, as having duties to fulfil towards\r\nher dead husband, or rather towards his shade. Thus, with the Sambos\r\nof Central America, she had to furnish a sufficient quantity of food\r\nduring a year to the tomb of the deceased;[820] and it was the same in\r\nMexico.[821]\r\n\r\nIn many of the Redskin tribes second marriages are not tolerated by\r\ncustom till after a very long delay, exacted for reasons that have\r\nnothing savage in them; it is simply that the children of the first\r\nmarriage may be grown out of their early infancy, and the custom is\r\nobligatory for the man as well as for the woman. The Selish widow only\r\nmarries after two years;[822] but the delay is sometimes from two to\r\nthree years for the widower as well as for the widow.[823] With the\r\nNez-Percés of Columbia, the widower can marry again at the end of one\r\nyear.[824] With the Omahas the delay was much longer, from four to\r\nseven years for the man and the woman. This rule was very strict, and\r\nin case of its infraction, the parents of the dead husband had the\r\nright to strike and wound, but without killing, the widow who might\r\nbe too hasty in marrying again. In a parallel case, they confined\r\nthemselves to taking a pony from the man;[825] this was because a man\r\ncould defend himself. On the contrary, if the widower waited much\r\nbeyond the legal time before marrying again, the parents or relatives\r\nof the dead wife thought themselves obliged to intervene. “This man,”\r\nsaid they, “has no one to sew his mocassins; let us seek a wife\r\nfor him.” When they did so, the widower was bound to accept their\r\noffer.[826]\r\n\r\nThis question of widows has evidently been very embarrassing for\r\nprimitive societies. They have either been kept or sold, according as\r\nit might be agreeable or advantageous. But another very simple way\r\nof getting rid of the encumbrance has been to sacrifice them on the\r\ntomb of the dead husband. Nothing is less rare than such immolations\r\nin savage countries, and these atrocious acts are often inspired\r\nby affectionate sentiments, by care for the fate which awaits the\r\ndeceased husband after death. How can they let him travel alone on that\r\ndangerous journey beyond the tomb? This is the reason of the widely\r\nspread custom of human sacrifices, which chiefly consist of women and\r\nslaves. I quote a few facts of this kind, simply as specimens.\r\n\r\nIn certain tribes of New Zealand the widows were strangled on the tomb\r\nof the deceased husband.[827] In equatorial Africa, at Yourriba, when\r\nthe king dies, four of his wives and a number of slaves are forced to\r\npoison themselves. The poison is poured into a parrot’s egg for them,\r\nand if it does not produce any effect the patients must supplement it\r\nby hanging themselves. At Jenna, on the Niger, at the death of a chief,\r\none or two of his widows must commit suicide the same day, in order to\r\nfurnish him with pleasant company in the country beyond the tomb, of\r\nwhich he is going to take possession.[828] At Katunga, the chief wife\r\nof the deceased king is obliged to poison herself on the tomb of her\r\nhusband, in company with the eldest son and the principal personages of\r\nthe kingdom. All these victims must be buried with the dead master.[829]\r\n\r\nThe massacres by which the death of the king of Dahomey is solemnised\r\nare well known, and in them also the wives play an important part as\r\nvictims. We know that the primitive Germans had analogous customs; for\r\nsavages of all countries, to whatever race they belong, resemble each\r\nother and repeat themselves.\r\n\r\nAmong various peoples funeral sacrifices are replaced by mutilations\r\nmore or less voluntary, and especially obligatory on widows. As\r\nexamples, I may mention the amputation of the little finger by the\r\nHottentots, the Melanesians, and the Charruas; and the gashes which\r\nPolynesian widows made on their faces and bodies. These bloody\r\ndemonstrations were obligatory, and far from corresponding to a real\r\ngrief. At Noukahiva Porter saw a widow, the funeral wounds still\r\nfresh on her neck, breast, and arms, prostitute herself to American\r\nsailors.[830]\r\n\r\nThis review of savage manners and customs in regard to widows has\r\nonly been a long enumeration of cruelties and iniquities, and these,\r\nalthough much lessened in barbarous countries, do not, by any means,\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Widowhood in Barbarous Countries._\r\n\r\nThe natives of Himalayan Bhootan are sometimes monogamous, sometimes\r\npolygamous, and sometimes polyandrous, and these variations naturally\r\naffect the conditions of widowhood. Among the monogamous and\r\npolygamous, the widows can only marry again after a delay of three\r\nyears. This regulation, which we have already found among the Redskins,\r\nhas doubtless been dictated by the same reasons; and taken with many\r\nother similarities existing in very dissimilar races and countries,\r\nit tends to prove that scientific sociology can be more than a mere\r\nname or imagination. In the Himalayan Bhootan, a widow who has no\r\nrepugnance to polygamy has many chances of marrying again, if she has\r\na younger sister still free, whom the new husband can marry at the\r\nsame time.[831] In polyandrous families there can hardly be any real\r\nwidowhood for the woman. Thus, at Ladak, if the eldest brother, the\r\nhusband in chief, happens to die, his property, authority, and share\r\nof the wife pass to the next brother, whether the latter be or not\r\none of the husbands.[832] This is a sort of levirate which naturally\r\nexists in polyandrous households, and obviates at once the question\r\nof widowhood, so embarrassing to the other forms of marriage. This\r\nquestion of widows has been solved very grossly, and sometimes very\r\ncruelly, in the Middle Empire or China proper. Although on certain\r\nsides the old Chinese civilisation puts ours to shame, it is very\r\nbackward in relation to all that concerns widows. We have previously\r\nseen that during her whole life the subjection of the Chinese woman\r\nis extreme, that she owes obedience first to her parents, then to\r\nher husband, then to her son, and that she is married, or rather\r\nsold, without being consulted at all. But widowhood does not even\r\nset her free, for she represents a value which the relatives of the\r\nhusband inherit, and which they hasten to profit by. It often happens,\r\ntherefore, that the Chinese widow is made to marry again, or rather, is\r\nsold again, and this time, also, no one dreams of asking her consent.\r\nThe child at the breast, if there is one, is included in the bargain.\r\nIn order to moderate the haste of covetous parents, the law has been\r\nobliged to intervene, and prevent the sale of the widow before the\r\nexpiration of the time of mourning. The Chinese widow, if she wishes\r\nto escape this traffic in her person, and is without fortune, has no\r\nresource except to become a bonzess. Those widows only whose rank or\r\nriches place them above the common, are able to pass the rest of their\r\ndays without being united to a fresh husband;[833] this posthumous\r\nfidelity is much encouraged in China by public opinion, whenever\r\ninterest does not forbid it. The betrothed maiden, who may become a\r\nwidow before being a wife, is much esteemed if she buries herself for\r\never in an enforced sorrow; but naturally, a reciprocal demand is not\r\nmade on the betrothed man who may lose his _fiancée_. If the rich widow\r\nwho remains inconsolable is much praised, she who refuses to survive\r\nher husband receives greater honour. Tablets are erected in the temples\r\nin memory of young girls who have killed themselves on the tombs of\r\ntheir betrothed, and twice a year certain mandarins make oblations in\r\ntheir honour.[834] With much stronger reason is this done for real\r\nwidows.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the _Pekin Gazette_ published a decree, according a tablet\r\nto the memory of the wife of a mandarin who had poisoned herself on\r\nhearing of the death of her husband in a battle against the rebels.\r\nThese suicides of widows are performed in public, with great pomp and\r\nsolemnity. In January 1861 two young widows thus committed suicide\r\nat Fou-Chow, in presence of several thousand spectators. Another did\r\nthe same at the end of December 1860.[835] It would seem, therefore,\r\nthat these suicides are frequent enough even at the present time. From\r\nobservations made during the Anglo-French Expedition to China, it\r\nappears that they are generally widows without children or relations\r\nwho thus sacrifice themselves; they do it openly and with much\r\nceremony. A month beforehand, the widow goes in procession through\r\nthe town, as has been thus described:--“Two executioners headed the\r\nprocession; then came musicians; then men dressed in coarse linen\r\ntunics with hoods, carrying parasols, little pagodas, boxes of\r\nperfumes, and streamers. After them came a third executioner, followed\r\nby a second group bearing poles, surmounted by figures of fantastic\r\nanimals. And lastly came a mandarin’s palanquin, surrounded by numerous\r\nservants of both sexes, dressed in mourning, which consisted of grey\r\nlinen. In the palanquin was the heroine of the _fête_, a young woman\r\ndressed in red (the imperial colour), and crowned with a blue diadem.\r\nHer red satin robe was ornamented with lace and gold embroidery. This\r\nsolemn procession had no other object than to announce the suicide to\r\nthe public, and invite them to attend it on the following moon, day\r\nfor day. The young widow was exact in appearing at the rendezvous, and\r\ntranquilly hung herself at the date fixed.”[836]\r\n\r\nWith differences of form and mode of execution, India devotes her\r\nwidows to a similar fate.\r\n\r\nIt seems, indeed, that in India also the widow is, or has been,\r\nconsidered as the property of the relatives of her dead husband, for\r\na verse of the Code of Manu orders that if she has been sterile, a\r\nrelative shall endeavour to make her conceive. Very striking and\r\nprimitive is the inequality of the obligations imposed by Indian law\r\non the widower and on the widow.[837]\r\n\r\nHere is the law for the husband: “Every Dwidja knowing the law, who\r\nsees his wife die before him, if she has obeyed these precepts, and\r\nis of the same class as himself, must burn her with consecrated fires\r\nand with utensils of sacrifice.”--“After having accomplished thus\r\nwith consecrated fires the funeral ceremony of a wife who has died,\r\nlet him contract a new marriage, and light a second time the nuptial\r\nfire.”[838] As for the widow, her duty is very different: “A virtuous\r\nwoman, who desires to obtain the same abode of felicity as her husband,\r\nmust do nothing which may displease him, either during life or after\r\ndeath.”--“Let her willingly emaciate her body by feeding on flowers,\r\nroots, and pure fruits; but, after losing her husband, let her not\r\npronounce the name of any other man.”--“But the widow, who, through\r\nthe desire of having children, is unfaithful to her husband, incurs\r\ncontempt here below, and will be excluded from the celestial abode\r\nwhither her husband has gone.”--“Nowhere in this Code is the right of\r\ntaking a second husband assigned to a virtuous wife.”[839]\r\n\r\nThe obligation not to marry again, and especially that of living on\r\nflowers and fruits, are sufficiently vexatious, but they are nothing\r\nto the suttees, or burning alive of widows, which were quite recently\r\ncommon in Bengal. The Code of Manu does not speak of this abominable\r\ncustom, though it was very ancient, for Diodorus mentions it, and\r\nrelates how the two widows of Ceteus, an Indian general under Eumenes,\r\ndisputed the honour of burning themselves with the corpse of their\r\nhusband. The description which Diodorus gives corresponds in every\r\ndetail with what took place at the suttees quite recently; so slow\r\nto change are these old theocratic societies. One of the wives, says\r\nDiodorus, could not be burnt because she was with child. The other\r\nadvanced to the funeral pile crowned with myrtle, adorned as for a\r\nwedding, and preceded by her relatives, who sang hymns in her praise.\r\nThen after having distributed her jewels to her friends and domestics,\r\nshe lay down on the funeral pile by the side of her husband’s body,\r\nand died without uttering a cry.[840]\r\n\r\nAt that time, according to Diodorus, the law only allowed the sacrifice\r\nof one wife. In the eighteenth century it was more exacting. In fact,\r\nthe writers of the _Lettres édifiantes_ have described in detail\r\nseveral sacrifices of this kind. The custom was no longer observed\r\nexcept by wives of grandees, and especially of rajahs; but all of\r\nthese were burnt, save the women with child, whose suffering was only\r\ndeferred.\r\n\r\nIn 1710, at the death of the Prince of Marava, aged eighty years, all\r\nhis wives, to the number of forty-seven, were burnt with his corpse,\r\nwhich was richly adorned and placed in a large grave filled with wood.\r\nThe victims, who were covered with precious stones, stepped at first\r\nvery bravely on the funeral pile; but the moment the flames reached\r\nthem, they uttered loud cries, and rushed on each other. The spectators\r\nsucceeded in calming them by throwing a number of pieces of wood at\r\nthem; afterwards their bones were gathered up and thrown into the sea,\r\nand a temple to their honour was erected over the grave.[841] At that\r\ndate, and in that part of the country, even women with child were only\r\ntemporarily spared till after their delivery.[842] Two other princes,\r\nvassals of Marava, having died at the same epoch, and leaving, the one\r\nseventeen, the other thirteen widows, all these unfortunate creatures\r\nwere burnt together, except one, who, being with child, could not\r\nsacrifice herself until later. The suttees were not a legal obligation;\r\nrelatives even tried to dissuade the widows from it; but the point of\r\nhonour, and the fear of public opinion, or rather of public contempt,\r\nwere stronger with them than love of life.[843] The mode of burning\r\nvaried in different provinces. In Bengal the woman was bound firmly to\r\nthe corpse, and the two bodies were covered with bamboos. In Orissa,\r\nthe widow threw herself on the pile, which was in a pit or grave. In\r\nthe Deccan, a country which was in great part Tamil, and where suttees\r\nwere much more rare, the widow sat on the pile, and placed the head\r\nof her dead husband on her knees. She remained thus, motionless,\r\nuntil she was suffocated by the smoke, or overthrown by the fall of\r\nheavy logs of wood, previously attached with cords to posts placed at\r\nthe four corners of the pile. It is said that in certain provinces\r\nthe victim was intoxicated with opium beforehand. Sometimes also,\r\nproper precautions not having been taken, it happened that she rushed\r\nmadly out of the flames, and was then brutally thrust back by the\r\nspectators.[844]\r\n\r\nThese frightful customs, which have hardly yet disappeared from India,\r\nare but survivals from the times of savagery: such brutalities were\r\nhabitual in a number of primitive societies, as I have previously shown.\r\n\r\nIn the Koran, in the Bible, and among the Arabs, or rather the\r\ncontemporaneous Islamites, we find nothing analogous to this; but the\r\nposition given to the widow is none the less unenviable.\r\n\r\nA verse of the Koran shows us that before the time of Mahomet, sons\r\ninherited all their father’s wives as a matter of course, in African\r\nfashion: “Thou shalt not marry the women who have been thy father’s\r\nwives; it is an abomination and a bad practice.”[845] We have seen\r\nthat this most gross custom, against which Mahomet inveighs, still\r\nprevails in various countries, and especially amongst the negroes of\r\ntropical Africa. It must have been general at the time of Mahomet, even\r\namongst the Arabs, since the prophet states that his law need not have\r\nany retrospective effect: “Let that remain,” proceeds the same verse,\r\n“which has already been done.”\r\n\r\nThere is one point, however, on which the Koran is in advance of the\r\ngreater number of barbarous societies, and even of the Bible. It\r\nrecognises, in fact, the right of a widow to inherit from her husband;\r\nthis right gives her a fourth, if there is no child, and an eighth only\r\nin the contrary case.[846] But notwithstanding this the widow was often\r\nabandoned, or, what is worse, confounded with the heritage. The Bible\r\nwas less kind to the widow. It specifies indeed that the fortune of\r\nthe husband is security for the personal effects and the dowry of the\r\nwife, but it does not place her among her husband’s heirs. The Jewish\r\nwidow was a charge on her children, or, if she had none, on her own\r\nfamily.[847] The abandoned widow had no other resource than her share\r\nin the offerings and public charity.[848] The injunction is indeed\r\ngiven not to afflict her;[849] it would certainly have been better to\r\ngrant her some rights.\r\n\r\nIn Judæa, the wife was bought by her husband; it is therefore probable\r\nthat, in primitive times, she formed a part of his wealth, as is the\r\ncase now among the Mussulman Afghans and among the Kabyles.\r\n\r\nIn Afghanistan, the widow, being a mortgaged property, cannot re-marry\r\nuntil the price of purchase paid for her by her deceased husband has\r\nbeen reimbursed to the parents of that husband.[850] In a great number\r\nof Kabyle tribes, the widow remains “hung” to her dead husband--that is\r\nto say, she is counted part of the heritage.[851] Generally she returns\r\nto her family, and her father or her relatives sell her a second\r\ntime.[852] If, however, she has children, especially male children, she\r\ncannot be forced to marry again; but then the son redeems her, or she\r\ndeducts from the property of her children the sum necessary to redeem\r\nherself from paternal power.[853] In the tribe of Aït Flik, heirs have,\r\nby pre-emption, the privilege of marrying the widow, and that without\r\nhaving to pay the _thâmanth_.[854] It is understood that while awaiting\r\nthe day when she is to be disposed of again, the Kabyle widow is bound\r\nto the strictest chastity. If she becomes with child, she is punished\r\nby stoning.[855]\r\n\r\nLike the Bible, and nearly all other legislations, the Koran only\r\nallows the marriage of a widow after a certain term of delay. In the\r\nKoran, this term is four months and ten days;[856] and if the woman is\r\nwith child, the delay must extend till after her delivery. But there\r\nare some pregnancies that are either imaginary or fictitious, and which\r\ncome to nothing, yet in Arab countries successions are suspended on\r\naccount of them. If, at the moment of her husband’s death, a woman\r\nthinks herself with child, she places her girdle on the body of the\r\ndeceased; note is taken of it, and the time awaited. If the waiting is\r\nvain, at the end of eleven months the widow is visited and examined by\r\nmatrons; and if nevertheless the professed pregnancy has no result, the\r\nchild who refuses to be born is called “asleep” for an indefinite time.\r\nHenceforth the widow is free, and if she ends by becoming a mother, her\r\nchild, awaited so long, is reputed to be the son of the husband dead\r\nyears before, and inherits from him.[857]\r\n\r\nThis singular prejudice is common to the Kabyles and to the Arabs. A\r\nnumber of Mussulman legists have vainly tried to overcome it. All that\r\nthey have been able to do is to limit to four or five years, generally\r\nto four, the duration of this pretended “sleep” of the fœtus.[858]\r\n\r\nThe widow has not been more worthily treated at the origin of\r\nGreco-Roman civilisation than in the other barbarous civilisations. It\r\nwould be strange if it were so. We have seen that at Athens the woman,\r\neven when married, was part of the paternal patrimony; that the dying\r\nhusband could leave her by will to a friend, with his goods, and by\r\nthe same title; that at Rome the wife was bought and subjected to the\r\nterrible right of the marital _manus_.\r\n\r\nFor a long time at Rome, as in China at the present day, the widows who\r\ndid not marry were particularly honoured. The widower married again\r\nimmediately after his wife’s death; widows, on the contrary, were in\r\nany case forbidden to marry before a delay of six months, afterwards\r\nextended to twelve months, and that under pain of infamy for the father\r\nwho had made the marriage, for the husband who had taken the widow, and\r\nlater for the re-married woman also, when infamy also applied to women.\r\nBy degrees Roman customs and laws improved on this point as on others.\r\nThe _Leges Julia_ and _Papia Poppæa_ encouraged second marriages, in\r\nopposition to the ancient prejudice; the _Institutes_ ordained that\r\nwhen the widow was poor and without dowry, she could inherit from her\r\nhusband one-fourth if there were three children, and a full masculine\r\nshare if there were none.[859] But the triumph of Christianity was the\r\nsignal for a retrograde movement. Constantine returned to the old ideas\r\nof primitive Rome, and went so far as to inflict on second marriages\r\npecuniary penalties, which were to be paid to the children of the first\r\nmarriage.[860] In acting thus, the neophyte emperor was acting up to\r\nthe logic of the Church, in whose eyes marriage itself was an evil\r\nrendered necessary by the sin of Adam, and by whom second marriages\r\nwere emphatically condemned.[861]\r\n\r\nFrom the fusion of Christian doctrines with the gross customs of more\r\nor less barbarous European races, on the subject of women and marriage,\r\nthere resulted for the widow a position of extreme subjection. Among\r\nthe Germans, as among the Afghans and Kabyles, the widow became again\r\nthe property of her own family, and in order to marry her, it was\r\nnecessary to pay a special price, the _reipus_, which was double the\r\n_mundium_ or price of the first purchase.[862] The Salic law decreed\r\nthat at the age of fifteen the son should be the guardian of his\r\nwidowed mother. The Lombard law decides also that the widow shall not\r\nmarry again without the consent of her son (section xxxvii.); and this\r\nconsent was necessary even for her to enter a convent. Thus Theodoric,\r\nadopting with barbarous fury the opinions of the Church on second\r\nmarriages, promulgated a law interdicting widows from marrying again,\r\nand condemning to the flames any man who should be convicted of having\r\nhad commerce with them.\r\n\r\nThese objections to second marriage, or at least the blame attached\r\nto them by public opinion, are common in many ancient societies. We\r\nhave found them in India, in ancient Rome and Greece, etc. We can only\r\nattribute this way of thinking, senseless and unjust as it is, to a\r\nsort of delirium of proprietorship in the husband, who pretends still\r\nto rule over and possess his wife from beyond the tomb, but chiefly to\r\nthe desire of avoiding disturbances in the transmission of hereditary\r\nwealth, when the women were able to have possessions of their own.\r\nThe levirate, of which I am now going to speak, remedied the latter\r\ninconveniences.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--_The Levirate._\r\n\r\nThe levirate is the name given to the obligation imposed by custom or\r\nlaw on the brother of the deceased husband to marry his sister-in-law\r\nwhen she became a widow. This custom of the levirate, which for a long\r\ntime has been thought peculiar to the Hebrews, is very widely spread,\r\nand is found among races most widely differing from each other. There\r\nis surely good reason for it in savage or barbarous societies where for\r\na woman abandonment would mean death.\r\n\r\nI will enumerate some of the peoples who practise the levirate,\r\nbeginning as usual with the inferior races.\r\n\r\nWe meet the levirate first in Melanesia, at New Caledonia, where the\r\nbrother-in-law, whether he be already married or not, must marry his\r\nbrother’s widow immediately.\r\n\r\nWe also find the levirate among the Redskins, particularly the\r\nChippeways; and at Nicaragua, where the widow belongs either to the\r\nbrother or nearest relative of her deceased husband.[863]\r\n\r\nWith the Ostiaks, the next brother of the husband is obliged to marry\r\nhis widow or widows; for the Ostiaks, like the Redskins, often take for\r\nwives a whole set of sisters.[864] It is the same with the Kirghis, and\r\nin general with the nomad Mongols.[865] The Afghans also make it a duty\r\nof the brother-in-law to marry his sister-in-law, on her becoming a\r\nwidow.[866]\r\n\r\nThe Code of Manu imposes the levirate even on the brother of a\r\nbetrothed man who dies: “When the husband of a young girl happens to\r\ndie after the betrothal, let the brother of the husband take her for\r\nwife.”[867] The object of this legal precept in India is to give a\r\nposterity to the deceased brother; for the following verse seems to\r\nlimit the duration of the cohabitation with the widowed _fiancée_,\r\nand it seems indeed that all commerce is to cease after the first\r\npregnancy.[868]\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the Hebrew levirate, which is only a particular\r\ncase of a very general fact.\r\n\r\nWe find the levirate mentioned twice in the Bible. At first in Genesis:\r\n“Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and perform\r\nthe duty of an husband’s brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy\r\nbrother.”[869] Again, in Deuteronomy: “If brethren dwell together,\r\nand one of them die, and have no son, the wife of the dead shall not\r\nmarry without unto a stranger; her husband’s brother shall go in unto\r\nher, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband’s\r\nbrother unto her. And it shall be, that the first-born whom she beareth\r\nshall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name\r\nbe not blotted out of Israel.”[870] The Hebrew levirate was therefore\r\na sort of obligatory and fictitious adoption of a nephew by the\r\ndeceased uncle. We shall soon see that in all primitive or barbarous\r\nsocieties this adoption is largely practised, and that it is absolutely\r\nequivalent to a real filiation.\r\n\r\nThe verses which follow inform us that, with the Hebrews, the levirate\r\nwas rather a moral than a legal obligation; the brother-in-law could\r\neven refuse it; but in refusing, he incurred the public contempt, and\r\nhad to submit to a degrading ceremony: “And if the man like not to\r\ntake his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up to the\r\ngate unto the elders, and say, My husband’s brother refuseth to raise\r\nup unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of\r\nan husband’s brother unto me; then the elders of his city shall call\r\nhim, and speak unto him: and if he stand, and say, I like not to take\r\nher; then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the presence of the\r\nelders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face,\r\nand she shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that\r\ndoth not build up his brother’s house. And his name shall be called in\r\nIsrael, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.”[871]\r\n\r\nIn India the principal object of the levirate, applied to the widowed\r\n_fiancée_, was to furnish the deceased man with a fictitious son,\r\nwho could perform for him the sacrifices to the manes, a duty of the\r\nhighest importance in the religion of Brahma. For the Hebrews, a much\r\nmore practical people than the Hindoos, the levirate had only an\r\nearthly object--that of keeping up the name or family of the deceased,\r\nand all that belonged to it. It may be compared with the obligation\r\nimposed at Athens on the nearest relative in the masculine line to\r\nmarry the heiress, or to supplement at need the impotence of the\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThe old practice of the levirate still exists in Abyssinia with this\r\ncurious detail, that it is applied during the lifetime of the husband\r\nif he has been the victim of an accident, frequent in the Abyssinian\r\nwars, of emasculation. The mutilated husband, being thus struck with\r\nwhat might be called “virile death,” his brother succeeds him in his\r\nmarital rights and duties.[872]\r\n\r\nSome sociologists, too much given to theorise, have tried to prove\r\nthat the levirate was a remnant of polyandry. Certainly the levirate\r\nis practised under a polyandric _régime_, but polyandry has never been\r\nmore than an exceptional mode of marriage, and there is hardly any\r\ntrace of it among the New Caledonians, the Redskins, the Mongols, the\r\nAfghans, the Hindoos, the Hebrews, the Abyssinians, etc., who, all of\r\nthem, practise different varieties of levirate.\r\n\r\nThe much more natural reasons that I have given above appear to me\r\nquite sufficient and more probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Conclusions._\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of all these facts, we find that the fate of\r\nthe widow has varied according to the matrimonial form in use, and\r\naccording to the degree of civilisation, but that it has not always\r\nbeen ameliorated in proportion to the general progress. Laws and\r\ncustoms have ever been kind to the widower. It has been very different\r\nfor the woman, and her position has perhaps been better, from our\r\npoint of view, in certain primitive societies, than it became later.\r\nThus, in the confused state of primitive families, when men lived\r\neither in a freedom almost bordering on promiscuity, or in groups\r\nhalf polyandric or polygamic, and more especially in polyandrous\r\ncountries, there was no actual widowhood, or state of being a widow,\r\nfor woman. The disappearance of one of the men with whom she lived\r\nin intimate relations made no great change in her position. Under\r\na polygamic _régime_ it is quite otherwise; for then the wives are\r\nprivate property. Their master has nearly always bought them, and their\r\nsubjection is very great. Therefore, at the death of their master, they\r\nare treated exactly like things; they follow the fate of the goods, and\r\npass into the hands of the heir, who can keep or sell them. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, they are sacrificed in greater or less numbers on the tomb\r\nof the dead husband, whom they must continue to serve and love in the\r\nfuture life.\r\n\r\nUnder a monogamic _régime_ societies are generally more civilised, and\r\nthe dominating ideas are then the care of property, and sometimes the\r\nperpetuation of the name. The widow cannot inherit, for the property\r\nmust not be divided. She is then a most embarrassing incumbrance.\r\nSometimes she is persuaded to follow still into the next world the\r\nhusband who has preceded her thither; this is the most radical\r\nsolution. Sometimes her relations marry her again, and obtain a second\r\nprice for her; sometimes she is provided for by the levirate.\r\n\r\nTraces of these ancestral iniquities are still preserved in our modern\r\ncodes, which, though nearly emancipating the widow, push the fanaticism\r\nof consanguinity so far as not to consider her as the relative of her\r\nhusband as concerns property. From a social point of view, the whole of\r\nthis survey of the treatment of widows is not flattering for humanity.\r\nIn short, from a moral point of view, the easy resignation with which\r\nmen and women bear widowhood, places mankind, as regards nobility of\r\nsentiment, far below certain species of animals, as, for example, the\r\nIllinois paraquet (_Psittacus Illinois_), for whom widowhood and death\r\nare synonymous, as well for the male as the female. Doubtless it might\r\nbe alleged that even in so-called highly civilised societies people do\r\nnot marry as a rule from any lofty sentiment; but that is surely a poor\r\nexcuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[811] Burchell, _Hist.

Among these theories, there are some which have\r\nbeen very favourably received, and not without reason. Insufficient as\r\nthey might be, they reduced a chaos of facts into order, and contained\r\na certain amount of truth. All of them are open to criticism and\r\ncontest, both because they are the fruit of a too hasty generalisation,\r\nand because their authors have claimed for them a certainty which\r\nsociological facts do not easily bear out. Human groups have always\r\nlived as they could, without caring about theories; their social\r\nconduct inevitably results from a sort of compromise in the conflict\r\nbetween their appetites, their aptitudes, and the necessities dictated\r\nby their physical environment.\r\n\r\nBefore hazarding any general conclusions, I shall be careful, as\r\nbefore, to refer to comparative ethnography, and to interrogate the\r\nvarious human races, from the lowest to the most elevated. This inquiry\r\nwill enable us to form a rough idea, with a certain approximation to\r\ntruth, in regard to the probable evolution of the family in humanity.\r\nBut in order to approach this subject with sufficient impartiality,\r\nit is absolutely necessary to clear our minds from all the current\r\ntheories in regard to the family. There is, in fact, no theme which\r\nhas inspired more empty oratorical lucubrations. The doctrine has been\r\nfirmly held that the family, as we have it instituted in Europe and\r\nin European colonies, is the _beau idéal_, the sacred and immutable\r\nsociological type. Ethnography, however, and even history, teach us\r\nthat the present familial type of Europe has not always existed, and\r\nthat it is the result, like everything else, of a slow evolution;\r\nfrom whence it is reasonable to infer that it will still continue to\r\nbe modified. But facts are more eloquent than reflections; I will\r\ntherefore approach them, beginning with the lowest human races, the\r\nMelanesians.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Family in Melanesia._\r\n\r\nIn my sketch of the family in the animal kingdom, I have already had\r\noccasion to remark that the family, such as we understand it, is not\r\nindispensable to the maintenance of societies, since the ants do\r\nwithout it in their republics, in which we find neither paternity nor\r\nmaternity, in the sense we attach to them, but simply three classes of\r\nindividuals, the breeders, the young, and the educators.\r\n\r\nWith these last, the working ants, by a paradoxical contradiction,\r\nmaternal love has survived the atrophy of the generative function; it\r\nis even purified and widened, for it is lavished without partiality on\r\nall the young ones, which form the hope of the republic; and though\r\nthus diluted, it seems to have lost none of its energy.\r\n\r\nNothing at all similar is seen in inferior human societies, but the\r\nfamily is still, however, in a confused state; paternity, in the social\r\nsense of the word, does not exist; filiation is especially maternal,\r\nbut the actual degrees of consanguinity are not well distinguished in\r\ndetail; parenthood is not yet individual, but is constituted in groups.\r\n\r\nIn the present day we may still study this familial confusion in\r\ncertain Australian tribes. We have seen that marriage, or what goes by\r\nthat name, resulted in Tasmania, Australia, Bali, etc., from a violent\r\nand brutal rape, generally ratified by a compensation and a simulation\r\nof retaliation between the tribe of the woman and that of the ravisher.\r\n\r\nAmong the least savage tribes of Melanesia, this rape is often\r\nfictitious, in which case it is no more than a survival; but sometimes\r\nit is still real, and it surely must always have been so at the origin\r\nof the Australian societies. But however gross these societies may be,\r\nthey are none the less the result of a long evolution. In the interior\r\nof Borneo there are still existing human beings compared with whom the\r\nAustralians are civilised people. These absolutely primitive savages of\r\nBorneo are probably the remains of negroïd peoples, who must formerly\r\nhave been the first inhabitants of Malaya. They roam the forests in\r\nlittle hordes, like monkeys; the man, or rather the male, carries off\r\nthe female and couples with her in the thickets. The family passes the\r\nnight under a large tree; the children are suspended from the branches\r\nin a sort of net, and a great fire is lighted at the foot of the tree\r\nto keep off the wild beasts. As soon as the children are capable of\r\ntaking care of themselves, the parents turn them adrift as animals\r\ndo.[873]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless thus, after the manner of the great monkeys, that\r\nprimitive human societies have been formed. With the chimpanzees these\r\nhordes can never become very large, for the male progenitor will not\r\nendure rivals, and drives away the young males as long as he is the\r\nstrongest. The first men were surely more sociable, because of their\r\nhuman nature. The young males of the human horde were able to remain,\r\nin greater or less number, within the association, but the jealousy\r\nof the progenitor-in-chief, the father of the family, must often have\r\nobliged them to procure one or several females by capturing them from\r\nneighbouring or rival hordes; they thus became more or less exogamous;\r\nand, in their embryo societies, marriage, or rather sexual union, ended\r\nby being prohibited between brothers and sisters, not because there was\r\nthe least moral scruple about incest, but because, within the limit of\r\nthe horde, the young women were claimed by the most robust males, who\r\nwould not yield them up. We know that this is still the case in the\r\nAustralian tribes.[874]\r\n\r\nIn this gross social state it is necessarily the mother who is the\r\ncentre of the family, just as she is in the families of mammifers; it\r\nis, therefore, quite natural that the children should bear her name and\r\nnot that of their father, which, for that matter, is not always easy\r\nto designate. When once the custom of exogamy was well established,\r\nwhat was at first a necessity ended by becoming an obligation, and men\r\nwere forbidden to unite themselves with women of the group to which\r\nthey belonged, and which bore the same name as their own. Such is still\r\nthe general rule in Australia.[875] But in Australia this group is\r\noften only a sub-tribe, a _gens_ or clan; for the hordes, becoming too\r\nnumerous, are subdivided into factions or large families, who unite\r\ntogether for common defence or vengeance. The children of each group\r\nbelong sometimes to the clan of the mother, and there is then no legal\r\nparenthood between them and their father;[876] also, in case of war,\r\nthe son must join the maternal tribe.[877] But this is not a universal\r\nrule, and in many tribes the children now belong to the paternal\r\nclan.[878]\r\n\r\nThese are general cases, common to the greater part of the Australian\r\ntribes, but not to all. There are some who have organised their\r\nmarriage and their family into classes, thus regulating, in a certain\r\nmeasure, the primitive confusion, and establishing by this very\r\nregulation a sort of limited promiscuity. The word “classes,” employed\r\nby travellers who have made us acquainted with these curious customs,\r\nis improper, for neither social classes nor castes exist in Australia.\r\nThese so-called classes are simply sub-tribes or clans, analogous to\r\nthe Roman _gens_.\r\n\r\nIn certain of these tribes a sort of categorical promiscuity is kept\r\nup. Thus, among the tribes of Mount Gambier, of the Darling River, and\r\nof Queensland, each tribe is divided into two sub-tribes, and within\r\neach of these clans all the men are reputed brothers, and all the\r\nwomen are sisters, and all marriage between these brothers and these\r\nsisters is strictly forbidden.[879] This is a primordial law; the\r\nviolation of it is an act of the deepest guilt, which not only stains\r\nthe individual, but the group to which he belongs; it is more than\r\nincest, and the Australians, who have a very lively sentiment of duty,\r\nfeel intense horror of such an act. But if every man is brother to\r\nall the women in his clan, on the other hand he is husband to all the\r\nwomen of the other clan of his tribe. Consequently, all the men of one\r\ngroup are called husbands by all the women of the other, and inversely.\r\nMarriage with these Australians is not therefore an individual act,\r\nas with us; it is a social condition, resulting from the fact of\r\nbirth.[880] However, the actual communal union is not obligatory in\r\nthe least. A man or woman may stop at the nominal or reputed marriage;\r\nthey may merely call each other husband and wife; but in principle,\r\nthe right is admitted, and the men sometimes offer temporary wives of\r\ntheir own class to strangers who visit them.[881] Thus in the tribe of\r\nthe Kamilaroi, near Sydney, every man of the Kubi clan has the right\r\nto call “my wife” every person of feminine sex belonging to the Ipai\r\nclan, and to treat her as such. There is no need of proposals, or of\r\ncontract, or of ceremony; a man is a husband by right of birth, but the\r\nintimate union does not imply association by couples; the woman passes\r\nfrom one to the other, or even from several to several others. On the\r\nother hand, within the limit of the clan, all the men and all the women\r\ncall each other brothers and sisters, and are bound to respect each\r\nother. In uniting with the men of the other sub-tribe having conjugal\r\nright over them, the women do not on that account cease to reside in\r\ntheir own clan, the sub-tribe of their “brothers.”\r\n\r\nMarriage within this sub-tribe is the abomination of desolation, the\r\nsin for which there is no forgiveness. Whoever commits it is outlawed\r\nfrom society, driven from the tribe, tracked through the woods like\r\ngame, and put to death. He has dishonoured the association, and the\r\nchildren who are born of these social incests are exterminated.[882]\r\nThus, all real consanguinity has been set aside, and a fictitious\r\nfraternity created between all the members of the same clan, similar\r\nto paternity by adoption. Is this artificial parenthood the result of\r\npractical exogamy, or has it, on the contrary, produced it? We cannot\r\ntell; but wherever it exists, its rule is absolutely inflexible. If,\r\nfor example, as often happens in Australia, the important men, the\r\nchiefs, the sorcerers, or the strong adults, seize a certain number of\r\nwomen for their personal use, they only do it in conformity to the law\r\nof exogamy between the sub-tribes. If one of the women thus confiscated\r\nruns away and is re-taken, she is not restored to the man who had\r\nusurped possession of her, but belongs by right to those who have\r\ncaught her.\r\n\r\nMoreover, certain neighbouring tribes are subdivided into sub-tribes,\r\nor clans of the same name; they have probably sprung one from the other\r\nat some former period. If it happens that a man steals a woman from one\r\nof these tribes, the captured woman is immediately incorporated into\r\nthe corresponding clan of the ravisher’s tribe, and she becomes the\r\n“sister” of all the women of this clan, to which will also belong her\r\nchildren. As for the ravisher, he is always a member of another _gens_,\r\nor clan, of the same tribe. If the tribes of the captured woman and of\r\nher captor are not symmetrical--that is to say, have not corresponding\r\nclans--then the woman may become the founder of a new clan belonging to\r\nthe tribe of the man who has carried her off.[883]\r\n\r\nIf a woman is captured by a party of warriors, and not by one\r\nindividual only, the first care of the captors is to inflict on her\r\na collective violation, on the condition, however, that none of them\r\nbelong to a clan homonymous with that of the ravished woman; if any\r\none of their party is an exception to this, he must abstain from so\r\ndoing.[884]\r\n\r\nThe sign of the fictitious fraternity of the Kamilaroi, and of all the\r\nAustralian tribes organised in the same manner, is a common emblem,\r\nthe _totem_. All the men bearing the same _totem_ are united by the\r\nbond of a conventional fraternity, which is none the less strict for\r\nthat reason. The _totem_ has evidently been invented in a primitive\r\nepoch, when the different degrees of consanguinity were not easily\r\ndistinguished, and were therefore replaced by an artificial union far\r\nwider than the limits of the natural family.\r\n\r\nWhenever a single individual wished to escape from this tribal\r\nmarriage, he was obliged to resort to various artifices. One of these\r\ntransitional processes has remained in use in the Kurnai tribe, in\r\nGippsland, Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe terms still in use with them to designate kinship recall the\r\nformer existence of a fraternal marriage; but in practice they have\r\nnone the less adopted individual marriage. The manner in which these\r\nindividual marriages are contracted probably indicates what must have\r\nhappened in primitive times, when some innovators attempted to escape\r\nfrom tribal marriage by carrying off the women they preferred, and\r\nwere only re-admitted to their tribe after having obtained pardon and\r\nthe ratification of their audacious enterprise. Among the Kurnai every\r\nmarriage must be made by the capture of one of the women of their\r\ntribe, even when this rape has been preceded by a friendly exchange\r\nof sisters, which is usual enough. This simulated rape is punished by\r\na simulation of vengeance. The fugitives are pursued; they are even\r\nill-treated, but short of being actually killed. Their punishment is\r\nsimply an act of obedience to ancestral customs. When all is concluded,\r\nand the fugitive couple reinstated among their people, the woman\r\nbelongs to the man who has carried her off; he is no longer obliged to\r\noffer her to the visitors of his clan, as old Australian hospitality\r\nrequired;[885] she belongs to him alone. Sometimes the ravisher\r\nlegalises his right of sole proprietor by first giving notice to his\r\nfriends, and offering them the use of his wife, after which he can keep\r\nher to himself.[886]\r\n\r\nIn proportion as tribal marriage was being transformed, owing to the\r\nbreaches made in it by individual instinct, the consanguineous family\r\nwas gradually arising in place of the collective and fictitious family.\r\nIt seems most likely that uterine filiation, or the maternal family,\r\nwas first established. The Australian Motas still have filiation by the\r\nwoman’s side, and among them the property of the uncle is transmitted\r\nto the uterine nephew; but already the paternal family is beginning to\r\nbe constituted, and the relatives on the male side seek to redeem the\r\nheritage by means of an indemnity.[887] With other and more advanced\r\nAustralian tribes, fanatical evolution is more complete; masculine\r\nfiliation is already instituted, and agnation adopted; there is even\r\na worship of the manes of male ancestors.[888] The Melanesians of\r\nAustralia and Tasmania present, therefore, a tolerably complete picture\r\nof the evolution of marriage and of the family, from the primitive\r\nrape, followed by a tribal period in which marriage is merely a limited\r\nand regulated promiscuity, and in which real consanguinity is replaced\r\nby a fictitious fraternity, down to the _régime_ of individual marriage\r\nand masculine filiation, previously passing through uterine filiation,\r\nor the maternal family. We shall find traces of this evolution among\r\nother races, but nowhere is the lower stage so well preserved as in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Family in America._\r\n\r\nNothing similar to the gross tribal marriage of the Australian\r\nKamilaroi is to be found among the American Indians, whose familial\r\norganisation, however, strikingly recalls that of the Melanesian clans,\r\nthough already in a higher degree of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe tribes of the Redskins were, and are still, divided into phratries,\r\nwhich are again subdivided into clans. Now these clans are composed of\r\nreal or fictitious relatives. In each phratry the corresponding clans\r\nhave the same _totem_, and it is strictly forbidden to marry a woman\r\nbelonging to the group bearing the same _totem_. This organisation is\r\nvery ancient; it existed in Mexico at the time of the Spanish conquest,\r\nand the French found it in the eighteenth century among the Redskins of\r\nCanada. The Hurons, Charlevoix tells us, were divided into three clans:\r\nthe wolf, the tortoise, and the bear.[889] The _totem_, or emblem of\r\nthe clan, served to sign treaties.[890] This is a general fact, and the\r\nsubdivision of the tribe into clans or _gentes_ is observed among the\r\nTinneh Indians, the Choctaws, the Iroquois, the Omahas, the Indians\r\nof Columbia, etc., etc. Each clan forms one large family, inhabiting\r\nsometimes a common house, as do still the Indians of the Pueblos, as\r\ndid the Iroquois at the time they were first discovered, and as did the\r\nMexicans at the epoch of the Spanish conquest. The “long houses” of the\r\nIroquois were buildings a hundred feet in length. A large corridor,\r\nclosed at the two extremities by a door, traversed its entire length.\r\nTo the right and left of this central corridor, and opening on it,\r\nwere stalls, or niches, each serving as the apartment of a family. The\r\nnumber of these families varied from five to twenty.[891]\r\n\r\nThe members of a Redskin clan had common rights and duties. When a\r\nman died, any personal objects he might possess were deposited in\r\nhis tomb, for they might be useful to him in the future life. The\r\nremaining property of the deceased belonged principally to the clan,\r\nor the _gentiles_; his near relatives, however, were considered first.\r\nThus, among the Iroquois, the widow, the children, and the maternal\r\nuncles claimed the largest part, while a very small portion of the\r\nheritage came to the brothers. The general principle was that the\r\nproperty should remain in the clan. In the present day the old customs\r\nare modified, and with the Iroquois, the Creeks, the Cherokees, the\r\nChoctaws, the Crows, etc., there is no longer any gentile heritage; all\r\npasses to the children.[892]\r\n\r\nThe political organisation was, or still is, republican. The members\r\nof a Redskin clan have the right to elect and to depose the chief of\r\nthe community, and the liberty to adopt strangers. They are united\r\nby a strict solidarity, and have a mutual duty to help and to avenge\r\neach other. And lastly they have their council and their sepulture in\r\ncommon.[893]\r\n\r\nBut the most rigorous obligation for the members of the same clan is\r\nthat of not marrying in it. To take a wife having the same _totem_ is\r\nconsidered as a most culpable act; it is a crime sometimes punished by\r\ndeath.[894] The Iroquois law regulating marriages recalls, in a certain\r\ndegree, that which takes place among the Kamilaroi of Australia. Thus\r\nan Iroquois of the Seneca tribe and of the Wolf clan must not marry a\r\nwoman belonging, not only to his own clan, but to all the clans of the\r\nsame name in the five other tribes of the Iroquois. On the other hand,\r\nhe is perfectly free to marry in any of the seven other clans of his\r\nown Seneca tribe.[895] In short, an Iroquois may be endogamous in the\r\ntribe, but he must be exogamous from the point of view of the clan or\r\nclans.\r\n\r\nThe motive of the prohibition of marriage within the clan is always the\r\nsupposed relationship. Thus the law of the Tinneh Indians forbids a man\r\nof the Chitsang clan to marry a woman of the same clan because that\r\nwoman is his sister.[896]\r\n\r\nThe children always belong to the _gens_, or clan, of their mother.\r\n\r\nThese rules vary more or less from tribe to tribe, except the\r\nprohibition of marriage within the clan, which is strict and general.\r\nThus, among the Omahas, a man may take a wife in another tribe, even\r\nif this woman belongs to a clan of the same name as his own; but he\r\ncannot marry within his own clan, because all the women of this clan\r\nare reputed to be his relations--sisters, aunts, nieces, daughters,\r\netc. We shall see presently to what women these various appellations,\r\nwhich among the Redskins have a much wider sense than with us, are\r\napplied.[897]\r\n\r\nThese customs, or very analogous ones, were in force with a great\r\nnumber of American tribes. At the present day the Indians of the Moqui\r\nPueblos still live in their common habitations, as at the time of the\r\nconquest, and they are divided into nine clans.[898]\r\n\r\nIn the Pueblo of Orayba the relatives of a married woman who dies take\r\nher property and her children, only leaving to the husband his horse,\r\nhis clothes, and his weapons;[899] for by marrying the woman does not\r\ncease to belong to her original clan. Among the Pipiles of Salvador\r\na genealogical tree with seven branches was painted on the wall of\r\nthe common house, and save in the case of a great service rendered\r\nto the clan, a man could not intermarry with any persons related up\r\nto the degree indicated by the genealogical tree.[900] In reality,\r\nthis people had got beyond familial confusion, or of purely _totemic_\r\nrelationship, but the principle regulating conjugal unions had not yet\r\nchanged. In Yucatan marriage between persons of the same name--that is\r\nto say, of the same clan--entailed the penalty of being considered as\r\na renegade.[901] The savage Abipones were also exogamous, according\r\nto Dobritzhoffer. This rule naturally gives way in proportion as\r\ncivilisation develops. The Nahuas still prohibited marriage between\r\nconsanguineous relatives; but at Nicaragua the prohibition only applied\r\nto relatives of the first degree.[902]\r\n\r\nWe have previously seen, in describing the family amongst the animals,\r\nthat it is habitually maternal; it is around the female that the young\r\ngroup themselves. As for the male, if he does not abandon the family,\r\nhe exercises no other function but that of chief of the band. It must\r\nsurely have been thus that the first human hordes were formed, and when\r\nman became intelligent enough to take note of filiation, it was uterine\r\nparenthood alone that he considered worthy of account. The primitive\r\nfamily was maternal, for in the confusion of sexual unions paternal\r\nfiliation would have been difficult to determine; no importance was\r\ntherefore attached to it in early times, and the father was not looked\r\nupon as the parent of his children.\r\n\r\nWe shall find the maternal family, or at least traces of it, in many\r\ncountries, but it is especially among the Indians of North America\r\nthat it has been the best preserved and the best studied. In the\r\neighteenth century it was already remarked by Charlevoix, Lafitau, and\r\nLahontan,[903] that the Redskins always bear the name of their mother,\r\nand that it is through a man’s sister that his name is transmitted\r\nto descendants. The American clan is based on uterine filiation; it\r\ncomprehends all the descendants, in the female line of an ancestral\r\nmother, real or hypothetical. It is therefore exactly the contrary of\r\nthe agnatic _gens_ of the Greco-Roman world.\r\n\r\nThe Redskin clan is composed of all the families reputed to be related\r\nto each other; it is a little republic having the right to the service\r\nof all the women for the cultivation of the soil, and of all the men\r\nfor the chase, war, and _vendettas_. It is to the woman that the wigwam\r\nor family dwelling belongs, as well as all the objects possessed by\r\nthe family, and the whole is transmitted by heritage, not to the son,\r\nbut to the eldest daughter or to the nearest maternal relative,[904]\r\nsometimes to the brother of the deceased woman. Nevertheless, this\r\nheritage must be understood in the sense of a simple usufruct. It was\r\nthe maternal clan in reality who was the proprietor, and none of the\r\nmembers of the community could seriously alienate the social property.\r\nThe husband alone, in most of the tribes, had no right over the goods\r\nor over the children; they all remained in the maternal clan;[905]\r\nit was maternal filiation which regulated the name, the rank, and\r\nthe hereditary rights in the clan.[906] A sort of communism reigned\r\nthere. All the provisions, whether they were the produce of the soil,\r\nof the chase, or of fishing, were placed in public storehouses, under\r\nthe control of an aged matron; and if it ever happened that a family\r\nhad exhausted its provisions, another family immediately came to its\r\naid.[907]\r\n\r\nBut maternal filiation was, or is, in force even where the clans did\r\nnot live in common houses, as we find it still among the Mohicans, the\r\nDelawares, the Narrangasetts, the Pequots, the Wyandots, the Missouris,\r\nthe Minnitaris, the Crows, the Creeks, the Chickasaws, the Cherokees,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWith the Iroquois and the Hurons, the father, says Charlevoix, was\r\nalmost a stranger to his children. “Among the Hurons,” continues the\r\nsame observer, “dignity and succession are inherited through the women.\r\nIt is the son of the sister who succeeds, and in default of him the\r\nnext relative in the female line.”[908]\r\n\r\n“With these peoples,” says Lafitau, “marriages are arranged in such\r\na way that the husband and wife do not leave their own family to\r\nestablish a family and a cabin independently. Each one remains at home,\r\nand the children born of these marriages belong to the families that\r\nhave produced them, and are counted as members of the family and cabin\r\nof the mother, and not at all as belonging to those of the father. The\r\npossessions of the husband do not go to his wife’s cabin, to which\r\nhe is himself a stranger; and in his wife’s cabin the daughters are\r\nheirs in preference to the males, who have nothing there but mere\r\nsubsistence.”[909]\r\n\r\n“Besides this,” continues Lafitau, “the wife’s cabin has rights over\r\nthe product of the husband’s, hunting; all of this must be contributed\r\nduring the first year, and a half only afterwards.”[910]\r\n\r\nThe mothers negotiated the marriages, and naturally did so without\r\nconsulting the interested parties. When the affair was once settled,\r\npresents had to be made to the gentile relatives of the bride. It\r\nwas the care of these relatives, in case of conjugal dissensions\r\nbetween the married pair, to attempt a reconciliation and to prevent a\r\ndivorce.[911] At the present time, among the Santi-Dakotas, if a wife\r\nis ill-treated by her husband, the mother-in-law has the right to take\r\nback her daughter; the husband’s power must yield to hers.[912] Does\r\nthe institution of filiation by women, or the maternal family, entail,\r\nas some have pretended, the _régime_ of the matriarchate? North America\r\nbeing _par excellence_ the country of exogamy and of the maternal\r\nfamily, the theorists of the primitive matriarchate have often drawn\r\narguments from thence which it is interesting to weigh.\r\n\r\nAt the epoch during which the Seneca-Iroquois still lived in their\r\n“long houses,” it seems that the influence of the women in the\r\ncommunity was very great. The missionary, Arthur Wright, wrote in\r\n1873:--“It was the custom for the women to govern the house. The\r\nprovisions were in common; but woe to the unfortunate husband or\r\nlover too idle or clumsy to bring home from the chase a sufficient\r\nbooty. Whatever the number of his children or the value of the goods\r\nhe possessed in the house, he might be ordered at any moment to take\r\nup his blanket and pack off.” After that, unless he obtained the\r\nintercession of some aunt or grandmother, he was forced to obey, return\r\nto his own clan, or contract an alliance elsewhere. “The women were the\r\nchief power in the clans, and they did not hesitate, when necessary, to\r\ndepose a chief, and make him re-enter the ranks of simple warriors. The\r\nelection of the chiefs always depended on them.”[913]\r\n\r\nAmong the Wyandots there is in every clan a council composed of four\r\nwomen elected by the female chiefs of the family. These four women\r\nchoose a chief of the clan from among the men; then the _totem_ of the\r\nclan is painted on the face of this chief. The council of the tribe\r\nis formed by an assemblage of the clan councils; four-fifths of it,\r\ntherefore, consist of women. The sachem, or chief of the tribe, is\r\nchosen by the chiefs of the clans.[914]\r\n\r\nCharlevoix relates that in 1721 the Natchez Indians were governed by\r\na very despotic chief, the Sun, who was succeeded by the son of his\r\nnearest of kin. This was the female chief, and she had, like the Sun,\r\nthe power of life and death over the people. At the death of the female\r\nchief in 1721, her husband, not belonging to the family of the Sun, was\r\nstrangled by her son, according to custom, and that without prejudice\r\nto other human sacrifices.[915] The ancient Spanish chroniclers also\r\nspeak of the submission of the husbands to their wives in Nicaragua;\r\nthey seem to have been treated as servants (Herrera, Audogoya).\r\n\r\nLastly, among the Redskins the matrons had the right to baptise the\r\nchildren--that is to say, to make them enter either the maternal or the\r\npaternal clan.[916]\r\n\r\nThese facts are curious. They prove, indeed, that with the Redskins the\r\nwomen enjoyed a notable influence, especially in ancient times. With\r\nthe Seneca-Iroquois they could expel the incapable hunter; but this\r\nwas evidently by their title of housekeepers of the clan. Among the\r\nWyandots, they figured numerously in the council; but nevertheless,\r\nthe supreme chief was a man. As for the woman-chief of the Natchez\r\nIndians, we find an equivalent of it in certain little despotic\r\nmonarchies of black Africa. Among the Ashantees, and in Darfour, etc.,\r\nthe princesses dominate their husbands or their lovers by the prestige\r\nof royalty. Nothing is more natural than that a plebeian husband should\r\nbe strangled on the tomb of his wife with other human victims, when we\r\nconsider the prevailing ideas of future life and the absolute servility\r\nof the subject in primitive monarchical states. In fact, the power\r\nof women among the Redskins was more apparent than real. Charlevoix\r\nhimself declares that their domination is fictitious,[917] “that they\r\nare, in domestic life, the slaves of their husband,” that the men hold\r\nthem in profound contempt, and that, amongst themselves, the epithet of\r\n“woman” is a cutting insult.\r\n\r\nImportant affairs were kept secret from them;[918] polygamy was\r\nhabitually permitted to the men, but polyandry was nearly always\r\nprohibited to the women. In fact, among the Redskins the woman is the\r\nslave of her husband, and the latter thinks so slightly of her, that\r\nfrequently the men live conjugally for years without communicating with\r\ntheir wives otherwise than by signs, as owing to exogamous marriage\r\nthey speak different languages.[919] The authority that the husbands\r\nconcede to their wives in certain tribes is entirely domestic; it is a\r\nhousehold royalty.\r\n\r\nThus, with the Selisches, the cabins containing the provisions are\r\nconfided to the women, and the husband himself can take nothing without\r\ntheir permission.[920] The husband or the son commands in the woods and\r\non the prairie; but in the interior of the wigwam it is the most aged\r\nwoman or the mother who governs and assigns to each one his place.[921]\r\n\r\nThese customs and the marriages by servitude have led several observers\r\nto attribute to the women a considerable authority which they do not\r\nreally possess. In fact, they are nearly always purchased, and are very\r\nsubmissive. The maternal family and the matriarchate are very different\r\nthings. The first is common; the second is very rare, if indeed it has\r\never existed. The Australians, who have the maternal family, none the\r\nless treat their wives as we should not dare to treat our domestic\r\nanimals. And again, in order that filiation by the female side should\r\ngive women a notable social influence, it is necessary that society\r\nshould be very civilised, that there should be exchangeable values,\r\nand that women should become rich by inheritance. Then they are in a\r\nposition to exercise the power that fortune gives in every country. But\r\namong the Redskins private property as yet hardly existed; the clans\r\npreserved the prior claim; personal property had not a great value;\r\nthere were no domestic animals; it was difficult for any individual,\r\nman or woman, to become rich. Lastly, the chief occupations, those\r\nwhich were reputed noble, those also on which the existence of the\r\ntribes depended, were the chase and war; now the women took no part\r\nin these. They have not therefore been able to exercise a dominant\r\ninfluence, even in the tribes where they were treated with relative\r\nmildness. Among the Redskins in general, all the painful labours fall\r\nto the women, except the fabrication of arms. It is she who takes care\r\nof the home, who cooks, prepares the skins and the furs, gathers the\r\nwild rice, digs, sows and reaps the maize and the vegetables, dries the\r\nmeat and the roots for the winter-provision, makes the clothes and the\r\nnecklaces, etc. She even works at the construction of bark canoes, but\r\nin this, man comes to her aid. With that exception, he confines himself\r\nto hunting and fighting, smoking, eating, drinking, and sleeping.\r\nIn his eyes work is a disgrace.[922] Such are the customs of living\r\nRedskins. Were they different last century? Not at all, if we may\r\nbelieve the authorities even who are invoked by the modern theorists\r\nof the American matriarchate. Charlevoix tells us that the Huron\r\nhusbands prostituted their daughters and their wives for money,[923]\r\nthat the Sioux cut off the noses of their unfaithful wives and scalped\r\nthem,[924] and that all the hard work was left to the women, the men\r\nglorying in their idleness.[925] Lafitau enumerates, with still greater\r\ndetail, the many and painful occupations of the women,[926] and he\r\nnarrates the story of a husband who burnt his adulterous wife at a\r\nslow fire.[927] It is not then amongst the Redskins that we can find\r\nthe matriarchate. Their familial system is none the less very curious,\r\nespecially if we compare it with that of the Australians.\r\n\r\nThe familial clan of the Australians and of the Redskins enables us\r\nto retrace the origin of the ideas of kinship. Nothing similar seems\r\nto exist among the animals. In the best endowed species, the parents,\r\nespecially the females, have an instinctive love of their young, but\r\nonly as long as they are young. After that period they no longer\r\nrecognise them, and often even drive them away.\r\n\r\nMan, who has certainly begun his existence in the same way as the\r\nanimals, has early attained, not to ideas of precise filiation, but to\r\na vague idea of consanguinity between all the members of his horde.\r\nIn these little primitive groups, no distinction has at first been\r\nmade between real and fictitious kinship. All the men of the same clan\r\nhave been brothers, all the women have been sisters, and by the help\r\nof an inveterate habit of exogamy, a gross morality has been formed,\r\nwhich condemned social incest. But as the life of the clan was, before\r\nall things, communal, while marriages within the clan were prohibited,\r\nit was decided that the clans of the same name--that is, those who\r\nhad sprung one from the other--should be united by a sort of social\r\nmarriage, all the women of the one being common to all the men of\r\nthe other. Then, in the course of time, the instinct of individual\r\nappropriation having undermined the primitive community, the women\r\nwere distributed amongst the men; they formed families which were\r\noften singular ones, and of which I shall have to speak again. There\r\nwas no longer promiscuity from clan to clan, but the wife was to be\r\ntaken from an allied clan. The first filiation which was established\r\nwas surely maternal filiation: primitive conjugal confusion would not\r\npermit of any other. But at length, when the family became more or\r\nless instituted, the relations could be classified, and the degrees of\r\nconsanguinity distinguished.\r\n\r\nIt was not without difficulty that man succeeded so far. A long period\r\nof time was required to disentangle the skein of family relationships;\r\nand fictitious kinship continued to be confounded with real kinship\r\nfor many ages. Change came only by a slow evolution, which we will now\r\nproceed to study.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[873] Lubbock, _Orig.

As a matter of fact, the\r\nNorth American Indians marry within their tribe; they are therefore\r\nendogamous as regards the tribe, but they do not take their wives from\r\ntheir own clan, and consequently they are exogamous as regards this\r\nclan. But the clan being composed of real or supposed blood-relations,\r\nthe exogamy of the Redskins is actually nothing more than our own\r\nprohibition, very much extended, of marriages within certain degrees of\r\nkinship.\r\n\r\nThere is really nothing here which resembles marriage by capture, so\r\noften classed with exogamy; but the latter may very easily co-exist\r\nwith the former, and may even be the general rule in more savage\r\ntribes. It prevailed, we are told, among the Caribs[928] to such a\r\ndegree that the wives did not speak the same language as their husbands.\r\n\r\nHow was the American tribe originally formed? Either consanguineous\r\nhordes have ranged themselves side by side, or, which is more\r\nprobable, a horde, becoming too numerous, has swarmed. Analogous\r\ngroups, proceeding from it, have formed large families, remaining\r\nall the while attached to the original stock, but constituting,\r\nnevertheless, distinct communities, confederated with each other and\r\nwith the primitive clan, which at length became indistinguishable\r\nfrom the others. The whole of these clans taken together represent a\r\ntribe. If the clans are too numerous, they group themselves in twos,\r\nor threes, etc., within the bosom of the tribe, and thus form what in\r\nprimitive Greece were called _phratries_, the bond between them being\r\na lesser degree of kinship. At first, marriage was prohibited within\r\nthe phratry, and afterwards exogamy was restricted to the clans. The\r\nclans composing the phratry had festivals in common, and considered\r\nthemselves bound to aid each other in revenging wrongs.[929] The clan,\r\nor _gens_, is a group of persons united by a closer consanguinity, but\r\nin the female line. The children of the women of the clan remain in\r\nthe clan of their mother. “The woman bears the clan,” say the Wyandot\r\nIndians,[930] just as our ancestors said, “The womb dyes the child.”\r\nEach clan has its _totem_ (a tortoise, bear, eland, or fox, etc.). In\r\nthe “long houses” of the Iroquois, or in the Pueblos, the members of\r\neach clan even had a common habitation, in which each family had its\r\nown cell; but the members of this cell-family belonged to different\r\nclans, as the husband was not of the same clan as his wife, and\r\nsometimes did not inhabit the same dwelling. We have heard it said many\r\ntimes that “the family is the social cellule.” Now this is evidently\r\nfalse in regard to the American tribe, and to all tribes that are\r\norganised on the same plan. In them it is the clan which is the social\r\nunit, or cellule, to keep to the metaphor favoured by H. Spencer, and\r\nit is feminine filiation which determines the kinship. What is this\r\nkinship in the female line in its details? That is what we must now\r\nproceed to inquire.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Family among the Redskins._\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the different degrees of kinship are understood\r\nand named varies somewhat among the diverse Redskin tribes; but, in\r\ngeneral, the similarity is very great, and great also is the confusion\r\nbetween real consanguinity and fictitious kinship. Among the Omahas,\r\nfor example, five classes of kinship are recognised--1st, the _nikie_\r\nkinship, arising from a very distant common ancestor; 2nd, the clan\r\nkinship; thus the families whose tents adjoin each other when the\r\ntribe is assembled, are of this kinship; 3rd, kinship by the calumet\r\ndance--that is to say, by adoption; 4th, kinship by marriage, including\r\nthe husband, wife, son, and daughter’s husband; 5th, kinship of\r\nblood-relation, including the clans of the mother, grandmother, and\r\nfather.[931]\r\n\r\nThe Omahas admit, therefore, entire groups of so-called kinsfolk quite\r\nunknown in our individualist societies; and moreover, the adopted\r\nkinsmen are held exactly on the same footing as the others.\r\n\r\nIf we confine ourselves to real kinship, we shall see that it is\r\nunderstood in a very wide manner. I will simply give, as a detailed\r\nexample, a description of the family among the Iroquois Senecas and\r\nthe Omahas. With the Iroquois Senecas, the direct line, both ascending\r\nand descending, is very short. It does not go farther than grandfather\r\nand grandmother, and grandson and grand-daughter. The more distant\r\nancestors and descendants are all comprised without distinction in the\r\nsame categories; they form groups of grandfathers or grandsons. In a\r\ncollateral line, they proceed by groups, in the same manner. Thus, _for\r\na_ _woman_, the sons and daughters of a sister are reckoned as her\r\nown sons and daughters, and their children are her grandchildren. The\r\ncollateral kinship is then confounded, at least in terminology, with\r\nkinship in a direct line. On the contrary, the sons and daughters of\r\na woman’s brother are only her nephews and nieces. How can we explain\r\nthis familial confusion on one side, and this distinction on the other?\r\nIt may probably be attributed to the habit of the Redskins to marry a\r\nlot of sisters at the same time. A woman counts her sister’s children\r\nas her own, because the husband of that sister, whom we should call\r\nher brother-in-law, is virtually her husband also. Inversely, _for a\r\nman_, his brother’s children, or his fraternal nieces and nephews,\r\nare reckoned as his own children; their children are his grandsons or\r\ngrand-daughters, whilst the children and grandchildren of his sister\r\nare only his nephews and nieces.[932] Following our previous line of\r\nreasoning, we are led to suppose that these denominations of kinship\r\ngo back to a distant epoch, when brothers had their wives in common,\r\nbut abstained from marrying their own sisters. This supposition is\r\nconfirmed by the examination of the collateral ascending kinship. Thus,\r\neither in the case of a man or woman, the father’s brother, or the\r\npaternal uncle, is reckoned as the father, and his sons and daughters\r\nare reckoned as brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nThe sisters of the father, or of any person bearing the title of\r\nfather, are called aunts. The children of these aunts are cousins.\r\nFor a man, the kinship of uncle is restricted to the brothers of the\r\nmother, and the children of these uncles are cousins. The mother’s\r\nsister, or the maternal aunt, is counted as a mother; her children are\r\nnot nephews and nieces, but sons and daughters. All sisters, real or\r\nfictitious, are mutually mothers of all their children. The children\r\nof a man’s brothers are not his nephews and nieces, but his sons and\r\ndaughters; his sisters’ children are his nephews and nieces,[933]\r\nprobably because these names have been given at an epoch when the\r\nbrothers married groups of sisters in common, but not their own sisters.\r\n\r\nThe Omaha Redskins distinguish the degrees of kinship almost in the\r\nsame way as the Iroquois Senecas. For them also the most distant\r\nascendants are all grandfathers or grandmothers. They class all their\r\nrelations in groups, formed of individuals virtually brought together\r\nby similar degrees of consanguinity or alliance. Whole categories of\r\nindividuals, more or less numerous, are called brothers or fathers of\r\na man or woman; all those whom the father of a person calls brothers\r\nare fathers to that person; all those whom the mother of a woman calls\r\nhusbands are also fathers to that woman. The name “mother” is given to\r\nall the women reputed as sisters to the mother, to the aunts or nieces\r\nof the mother, and also to the virtual wives of the father.\r\n\r\nA man has virtually for wives all the wives of his brothers, and also\r\ntheir widows, on account of the levirate.\r\n\r\nIf a man has a brother-in-law who is at the same time the husband of\r\na paternal aunt, the sister of that man is the grand-daughter of the\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\nA man becomes your brother-in-law if he is merely the husband of a\r\npaternal aunt, because he can marry your sister.\r\n\r\nThe husband of a daughter, of a niece, or of a grand-daughter, is a\r\nson-in-law.[934]\r\n\r\nAll the sons and all the daughters of persons reputed as fathers and\r\nmothers call each other brothers and sisters. All the wives, real or\r\nvirtual, of the grandfather are called grandmothers; so are also all\r\nthe mothers or grandmothers of the fathers and mothers, and all the\r\nwomen that the fathers and mothers call sisters.\r\n\r\nA man counts as his sons all the sons of his brothers or of his virtual\r\nwives; but the sisters of these sons are his sisters. A woman calls\r\nthe sons and daughters of her brothers her nephews and nieces, but the\r\nchildren of her sister are counted as her own children; because their\r\nfather is virtually her husband.\r\n\r\nAmong the Omahas a man calls his sister’s children nephews and nieces.\r\nA person of either sex counts as grandchildren all those who are called\r\nthe children of his sons, daughters, nephews, and nieces, or reputed as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nA man counts as uncles all those whom his mothers call “brothers”; and\r\nas aunts all the sisters of his father and the wives of his uncles. A\r\nman has for brothers-in-law the husbands of his father’s sister; for\r\nthey are the real or virtual husbands of his sisters; a woman has them\r\nfor virtual husbands.[935]\r\n\r\nVarious prohibitions of marriage result from these conventional\r\nkinships. A man may not marry the women that he calls daughters of a\r\nsister, or grand-daughters, etc. A woman may not marry the men who are\r\nher sons, the sons of her sister, of her aunt or of her niece, or who\r\nare her brothers, etc.[936]\r\n\r\nBut an Omaha may marry any woman who is not a blood relation, provided\r\nthat she does not figure among the prohibited affinities.[937]\r\n\r\nWe have not such detailed information regarding the other Redskin\r\ntribes; but we know enough of them to be certain that their systems of\r\nkinship are very analogous to those of the Iroquois Senecas and the\r\nOmahas. Filiation is everywhere maternal, except in certain tribes in\r\nthe course of evolution; nearly everywhere also it is a crime to marry\r\na woman having the same _totem_.[938]\r\n\r\nAmong the Mandans, Pawnies, and Arickaries, a man calls his brother’s\r\nwife his wife also. Among the Crows a woman calls her husband’s\r\nbrother’s wife her “comrade”; but among the Winebagos she calls her\r\n“sister.” In some tribes a man’s wife’s sister’s husband is called his\r\n“brother.”[939]\r\n\r\nSome very severe and inconvenient rules of decency have resulted from\r\nthese fictitious kinships, with their prohibitions of marriage.\r\n\r\nThus, among the Omahas, the young girls may only speak to their\r\nfather, brother, and grandfather. A woman avoids passing before her\r\ndaughter’s husband as much as possible; and, unless under extraordinary\r\ncircumstances, a woman does not speak directly to the father of her\r\nhusband. A man never addresses a word to the mother or grandmother of\r\nhis wife.[940] In the last century, among the Iroquois, a young man\r\nwas dishonoured if he stopped to converse in public with a young girl\r\nwho was certainly within the prohibited degree of kinship.[941] For a\r\nyoung Iroquois girl to call the husband of her aunt by his personal\r\nname was considered a grave act, indicating a culpable _liaison_.[942]\r\n\r\nFrom the manner in which the Redskins understand kinship, we may infer\r\ntwo things: first, that they must have passed through a familial stage,\r\nin which groups of brothers married groups of sisters and possessed\r\nthem in common, thus combining polygamy and polyandry, since they\r\nattach little value to real consanguinity, and their kinships are very\r\noften fictitious; and secondly, that they make no difference between\r\nreal filiation and adoption, and in this they resemble savages and even\r\nbarbarians of all countries. Among the Omahas the word used to signify\r\nadoption means literally “to take for one’s own son.”[943] The adopted\r\nchild is always treated as the first-born, and takes his place; the\r\nfather who adopts him refuses him nothing, and gives him a share in all\r\nhis wealth. The real father, on his side, makes presents to the adopted\r\nfather. And lastly, there is a prohibition of marriage during four\r\nyears between the two families, on account of the kinship created by\r\nthe adoption.[944]\r\n\r\nSometimes an entire clan adopts another. Thus the Wolf-Iroquois were\r\nadopted by the Falcon-Iroquois, and the effect of this adoption was\r\nthat the two clans became completely assimilated, the new-comers taking\r\nthe kinships of the adoptive clan.[945]\r\n\r\nThe adoption of enemies, taken prisoners after a battle, is still more\r\ncurious. This adoption has almost miraculous effects; it extinguishes\r\nthe ferocious hatred which the Redskins always feel for men belonging\r\nto rival tribes; more than that, it makes the captive warrior become\r\nthe husband of the woman whom he has perhaps rendered a widow, or\r\nof the daughter whose father he may have killed. The Redskins have,\r\nit should be said, very exaggerated ideas on the subject of warlike\r\nvalour. A combatant must never surrender unless very severely wounded.\r\nEvery warrior who is taken prisoner is dishonoured and held as\r\ndead by his tribe, and his captors generally torture him to death.\r\nHowever, in the last century, the most ferocious of the Redskins, the\r\nIroquois, sometimes spared a few prisoners to offer them to the wives\r\nor daughters whose relations had been killed. The latter had the power\r\neither to put them to death, in order that their shades might serve as\r\nslaves to their father, brother, or husband, etc., who had fallen, or\r\nto pardon them, and even adopt them. In this last case, the enemies of\r\nthe previous night took a place among the warriors of the clan, and\r\nwere no longer distinguished from the others.[946]\r\n\r\nThis system of kinship in the familial clan is curious, because it\r\nholds real consanguinity very cheap, unhesitatingly confusing real with\r\nfictitious kinship, and thus forming classes of fictitious relations.\r\nIt seems to prove the existence of an ancient period of promiscuity,\r\nduring which there was scarcely any thought of determining with\r\nprecision the degrees of consanguinity of individuals. Naturally,\r\nthe first form of the family which was more or less vaguely outlined\r\nin the confused groups anterior to the familial clans, was the\r\nmaternal family; but this system of filiation by classes is in no way\r\nincompatible with paternal filiation.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time kinship in the female line prevails among most\r\nof the Redskin tribes. Certain of them, however, are evolving in\r\nthe direction of masculine filiation, and this movement was already\r\ncommencing at the close of the last century.[947] The transformation\r\nbegan with the chiefs and more powerful men. Among the Thlinkits of\r\nRussian America the great men already give the paternal name to their\r\nchildren; but the poorer people are still in the stage of uterine\r\nfiliation.[948] Certain tribes have quite recently adopted the system\r\nof paternal filiation. It is owing to European influence that this\r\nchange is operating, and its accomplishment is only a question of time.\r\nThe Ojibways have only taken two generations to effect the adoption\r\nof agnatic filiation.[949] A similar evolution was spontaneously\r\naccomplished in the great states of Central America. In Peru maternal\r\nfiliation was still in general use, but the paternal family was\r\nbeginning to appear. In the mass of the nation, says Gomara, the\r\nheritage was transmitted to nephews and not to sons; but in the family\r\nof the Incas direct male descendants alone had the right to avail\r\nthemselves of their origin, and sons inherited.[950] It seems that in\r\nMexico the familial evolution may have been more advanced, for there\r\nit is always the paternal personality which predominates, and it is\r\nthe father who dictates to the children rules of conduct and moral\r\nprecepts. The mothers exhort their daughters to be submissive to their\r\nhusbands, to obey them and strive to please them.\r\n\r\nThe familial customs which I have just described are general in\r\nAmerica; they are not universal as regards exogamy, for Hearne tells us\r\nthat many Chippeways frequently take to wife their sisters, daughters,\r\nand even mothers.[951] We know, on the other hand, that the Peruvian\r\nIncas married their sisters, and that throughout the Peruvian empire no\r\none married outside the administrative district.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of America the diversity is still greater. The Caribs\r\nmarried their relatives, with the exception of sisters,[952]\r\nindiscriminately; the Indians of Guiana, on the contrary, practised\r\ntotemic exogamy, like the Redskins.[953]\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Guatemala were unacquainted with maternal kinship. They\r\nwillingly married their sisters, provided they were not children of the\r\nsame father, and among them the children belonged to the class of the\r\nfather even when the mother was a slave.[954] Among the Mayas descent\r\nwas also reckoned in the male line.[955] In various savage tribes of\r\nMexico the women did not inherit. Among the Ityas and in Yucatan the\r\nname of the child was formed by combining the names of the father and\r\nmother; the mother’s name, however, had the precedence.[956]\r\n\r\nThe monk Thevet relates that the Indians of Brazil already pushed the\r\nagnatic system, at least in theory, to its most extreme limits; for\r\nthey affirmed, he says, that in procreation the part of the father is\r\npredominant, and that of the mother only secondary.[957] The general\r\nconclusion to be drawn from these very dissimilar facts is, that we\r\nshould abstain from forming any absolute theories on these great\r\nsociological questions of marriage and the family, which are still so\r\nfar from being elucidated.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Family in Polynesia._\r\n\r\nFiliation by the female line seems to be generally adopted, not only in\r\nPolynesia, but in many Melanesian or Micronesian archipelagoes. It has\r\nbeen found in the Fiji Islands, at Tonga and the Carolines,[958] etc.\r\nBut exogamy, even the exogamy of the clan, after the American fashion,\r\nappears rare. It existed at Samoa, but in any case it seems not to have\r\nbeen a general custom.[959]\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand endogamy predominated, and marriage with a woman of\r\nanother tribe was even prohibited, unless an important political motive\r\ncould be given as an excuse.[960] Endogamy was also practised in the\r\nHawaian Islands. In the Mulgrave Islands every marriage required the\r\nsanction of an assembly of all the friends and relatives, or rather of\r\nthe whole clan,[961] for the interest of the community was involved in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the Hawaian Islands there existed a confused kinship by classes,\r\nanalogous to that of the familial clan among the Redskins, but much\r\nmore gross. Group-marriage of brothers and sisters prevailed, but\r\ngenerally the brothers did not marry their own sisters. As for the\r\nnames expressing the degrees of kinship, they were names of classes.\r\nThe Hawaians had no words to express “father” or “mother.” They used\r\nthe word “_mkûa_,” which signifies “parents.” To say “father,” they\r\nadded the word “_kana_,” which signifies “male”: _Mkûa kana_, male\r\nparent. To say “mother,” they used the combination, _Mkûa ouahina_,\r\nfemale parent. There was no expression for “son” or “daughter.” They\r\nused the word _keiki_, child, or little one, to which they added _kana_\r\nor _ouahina_, as before, according as the child was male or female. The\r\nlanguage had no terms for “brother” or “sister.”[962] The word employed\r\nto express “wives” is collective; it applies to the wife’s sister as\r\nwell as to the wife proper, and signifies literally “female”; in the\r\nsame way, for “husband” they used the word _kana_ (male), and applied\r\nit also to the husband’s brother and sister’s husband. All the sisters\r\nof a woman were called “the wives of the husband of that woman,” even\r\nwhen they were not actually so.[963] The Hawaians had no expressions\r\nfor “grandfather” or “grandmother.” Their word _kapuna_ signifies an\r\nancestor of any degree beyond the father and mother (_mkûa_). Neither\r\nhad they any special denomination for “grandson” or “grand-daughter.”\r\nAs brothers and sisters did not generally intermarry, the women called\r\nthe husband or husbands of their sisters, not “husbands,” but “intimate\r\ncompanions” (_punalua_).[964]\r\n\r\nIt was possible for either the paternal or maternal family to evolve\r\nfrom this confused system of kinship, based at first apparently on the\r\npromiscuity of brothers and sisters; but it was the latter which at\r\nfirst arose, and in the time of Cook the rank and dignity of the chiefs\r\nwere transmitted in the female line.[965] A singular custom noticed\r\nby Cook in the Society Isles may perhaps be interpreted in the sense\r\nof maternal filiation. They spoke of the transmission of the title\r\nand dignity of the chiefs to their first-born, and that even at the\r\nmoment of birth. As soon as the wife of a chief had given birth to a\r\nson, the father was reckoned as deposed, and became a simple regent; he\r\nowed homage to his son, and might not remain in his presence without\r\nuncovering to the waist.[966] At Tonga maternal filiation was well\r\nestablished; rank was transmitted by the women, who sometimes even\r\nreigned,[967] and the father was not counted as the parent of his\r\nchild.[968]\r\n\r\nOf late years, and manifestly under European influence, the familial\r\nsystem has become modified in Polynesia. At Tonga masculine filiation\r\nis being substituted by degrees for feminine filiation.[969] The Maoris\r\nof New Zealand have also adopted agnatic filiation, but this new system\r\nstill jars against ancient usages, which formerly harmonised with the\r\nmaternal family.\r\n\r\nThis evolution of the family in Polynesia has probably had for its\r\nstarting-point a confused promiscuity, and afterwards a system of\r\nclassification of relations, in which real and fictitious ties were\r\nhardly distinguished from each other. With the slight importance\r\nattached to real consanguinity might very naturally coexist a great\r\nfacility to practise adoption. This was abused to such a degree in\r\nthe Marquesas Islands that it was not uncommon to see aged persons\r\ngetting themselves adopted by children, and even animals were adopted\r\nalso. Thus a chief had adopted a dog, to which he had ceremoniously\r\noffered ten pigs and some precious ornaments; he had him constantly\r\ncarried by a _kikino_; and at the banquets of the chiefs, the animal\r\nhad his appointed place by the side of his adoptive father.[970] There\r\nwas no distinction generally made between the real and the adoptive\r\nparent,[971] and we may hence conclude that the degrees and bonds of\r\nkinship were not well distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Family among the Mongols._\r\n\r\nThe family of the Polynesians, and more especially of the Hawaians, may\r\nwell have been, as L. Morgan supposes, the primitive familial type of\r\nthe American Redskins. It has for its basis a marriage which is at once\r\npolyandric and polygynic, between groups of sisters and corresponding\r\ngroups of brothers, and it results quite naturally in a system of\r\nkinship by classes, holding real consanguinity very cheap.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that analogous systems of kinship may have been\r\nadopted by the greater number of the Asiatic Mongols. This may at\r\nleast be inferred from the fragmentary but significant accounts with\r\nwhich explorers have supplied us. Among the Yourak Samoyedes, it is\r\nforbidden to marry a woman of the same tribe (or rather clan).[972]\r\nThe people among the Kalmucks are subject to restrictions of the same\r\nkind in regard to marriage, which must not take place within three or\r\nfour degrees of kinship. The great men, however, for whom the laws\r\nare more lenient in all countries, sometimes obtain immunity from\r\nthese inconvenient obligations, but the populace is very much shocked\r\nat their laxity. “Great men and dogs,” they say, “have no kin.”\r\nNevertheless, the sons of the great men, who often also marry their\r\nsisters-in-law, always take a wife in another clan.[973] Kinship by\r\nclasses surely existed among the Mongols only a few centuries ago,\r\nfor Baber, the founder of the Mongol Empire of Delhi, speaks in his\r\n_Memoirs_ of one of his lieutenants, named Lenguer Khan, who possessed\r\na whole tribe of maternal uncles, the Djendjouhah, forming a people who\r\nlived in the mountains of the Punjaub.[974]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _The Evolution of the System of Kinship by Classes._\r\n\r\nThese facts, and the inferences they suggest, enable us to solve a\r\ndifficulty which has embarrassed an eminent sociologist, L. Morgan, to\r\nwhom we owe our acquaintance with the details of the curious systems of\r\nkinship by classes prevailing among the Polynesians and the Redskins.\r\n\r\nMorgan, in comparing, term for term, the denominations indicating\r\nkinship among the Iroquois-Senecas and the Tamils of India, found\r\nthem identical as to meaning and number, and he admits, but not\r\nwithout hesitation, that there has been, in both races, a parallel and\r\nspontaneous evolution.[975] This way of explaining ethnic similarities\r\nis certainly in general very legitimate. At first sight it often\r\nappears trustworthy, and saves the trouble of inventing fantastic\r\nmigrations. In thousands of cases men of every period, every country,\r\nevery race have conducted themselves in the same way, had the same\r\nideas, realised the same inventions, adopted the same practices,\r\nwithout knowing each other, without even supposing the existence of\r\nthe other peoples, and this simply because all of them were part of\r\nthe great human family. But between the Mongoloids of North America,\r\ntheir cousins of Northern Asia, and the Hawaians, there is probably\r\nthe bond of a distant and common origin, and, besides this, the nomad\r\nMongols of Asia have more than once penetrated into India. Up to the\r\npresent time, half-savage Mongol tribes occupy entire regions of the\r\nHimalaya. Mongols and Tamils have had wide and long communications with\r\neach other during prehistoric ages; it has therefore been possible\r\nfor them to borrow mutually their system of kinship. There exists\r\nquite a chain of peoples, including the Tamils of India, the least\r\ncivilised Mongols, the American Redskins, and lastly the greater\r\nnumber of the Polynesians, all of whom have formerly adopted, or still\r\npractise systems of kinship, based, not on consanguinity, but on a\r\nclassification more or less fictitious.\r\n\r\nThe fact is interesting; but it is somewhat bold to attach to it, as\r\nMorgan has done, a universal value, and to pretend that all human\r\nraces have passed through this phase of kinship by classes. Even in\r\nthe countries where this familial form prevails, it is subject to more\r\nthan one exception, and it is probable that each great human type,\r\nhaving had its special centre of creation, has evolved physically\r\nand psychically in its own manner, sometimes unconsciously imitating\r\nthe others, but quite as often deviating from them, according as the\r\nenvironment, the difficulties to be overcome, and the necessities\r\nof the struggle for existence imposed on it such or such a line of\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nHowever it may be, if we condense, by classification, all the notions\r\nthat have been collected in relation to kinship by classes among the\r\nAustralians, the Tamils, the primitive Mongols, the Mongoloids of North\r\nAmerica and those of Polynesia, we may retrace the evolution of kinship\r\nby classes with sufficient appearance of truth.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there must have existed hordes, which, though doubtless\r\nhuman, were still very bestial as regards their instincts and\r\nintelligence. In these hordes, which were not very numerous, the women\r\nbeing taken possession of by the most robust old males, the young ones\r\nwere obliged either to quit the group or to remain in it by ravishing\r\none or two women from rival hordes; for exogamy was a necessity. The\r\nleast advanced of the Australian tribes seem to be still in this\r\nprimitive stage. At length a little order was put into this disorder\r\nby the horde breaking up into clans; it was then decided that all the\r\nmen and all the women of each clan should be brothers and sisters, and\r\nshould not intermarry, and that on the other hand, all the men of a\r\nclan should be the husbands of all the women of the neighbouring clan,\r\nsimply by right of birth. The Kamilaroi of Australia may represent the\r\nsecond stage.\r\n\r\nIn Polynesia the principle is the same, but the idea has become\r\nrestricted and defined. Groups of real brothers marry groups of women\r\nactually sisters, thus forming households at once polyandric and\r\npolygamic; but traces of the antique marriage by fictitious groups\r\nof brothers and sisters appear again in the terms used to designate\r\nthe various degrees of kinship. These terms are in reality purely\r\nclassificatory, and take little account of real consanguinity.\r\n\r\nAmong the Redskins a new and important restriction has been\r\nestablished. Marriage outside the clan is continued, but not marriage\r\nby groups of sisters and brothers. That this was done in primitive\r\ntimes, however, is proved by the familial vocabulary. On the other\r\nhand, they have clearly renounced polyandry, and adopted polygamy with\r\nnot less clearness; but this polygamy is special, and it is generally a\r\ngroup of sisters who marry the polygamous husband.\r\n\r\nAs for the terms of kinship, they are always general and\r\nclassificatory. The relations are denominated by groups, and the titles\r\nof kinship do not in the least correspond to the ties of blood.\r\n\r\nLastly, among certain nomad Mongols of Asia, the strict prohibition to\r\nmarry within the clan, and the terms of kinship applying to groups,\r\nshow that formerly a familial system, analogous to that of the American\r\nRedskins, has been in use.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this classificatory system is preserved entire in the\r\ndenominations of kinship by the Tamils of India. But among these last,\r\nand also among certain Mongol populations of Thibetan Himalaya, the\r\nprimitive family, at once polygamic and polyandric, that of the Hawaian\r\nislanders, has evolved after its own manner, which it is interesting to\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe Polynesian, or rather the Hawaian family, formed essentially by\r\nthe conjugal union of a group of brothers with a group of sisters,\r\nmay evidently be restricted in two ways. Either, in the long run,\r\npolyandry is found irksome; the men will no longer share their wives,\r\neven with brothers, but find polygamy very convenient; in this case the\r\nbrothers contract isolated marriages, preserving nothing of the old\r\nways but the custom of marrying, when possible, a group of sisters:\r\nthe Redskins have done and still do this. Or, on the contrary, for\r\none reason or another, and most often on account of the relative\r\nscarcity of women, the Hawaian marriage evolves in another direction.\r\nThe brothers continue to marry in a group; but, instead of marrying\r\nsimultaneously several sisters, they take only one wife and possess her\r\nin common: this time it is in the direction of polyandry that primitive\r\ngroup-marriage has evolved. From the Himalaya to Ceylon we find a long\r\ntrack of ethnic groups who have thus transformed their marriage. The\r\nmountaineers of Bhootan, the Naïrs, certain other aboriginal tribes\r\nof India, and a part of the population of Ceylon, where the Tamils\r\nhave largely immigrated, are all of them the remains or landmarks of\r\nan ancient layer of polyandric population traversing the whole of\r\nHindostan.\r\n\r\nAll these facts can be classed in a satisfactory manner. Thus united,\r\nand placed in a series, they complete and throw a light on each other,\r\nand show us the reason of customs which before appeared inexplicable.\r\n\r\nAll this evolution is quite admissible, but it is important to restrict\r\nit to the populations with which it actually appears to be connected,\r\nand not to make of it a universal law, applicable to the whole human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _The Clan and the Family._\r\n\r\nIndependently of their intrinsic interest, the facts that I have so\r\nrapidly enumerated have a very wide bearing. Taken alone, they suffice\r\nto destroy altogether the generally accepted ideas as to the origin\r\nof human societies. The current doctrine, so often asserted, and\r\nmanifestly inspired by the Edenic tradition of a terrestrial Paradise\r\nand by the memory of the Roman family, insists that human societies\r\nhave always and everywhere started with the family, and by this word is\r\nunderstood the patriarchal family, essentially composed of the father\r\nand the mother, or at most the mothers and the children. From this\r\nfirst family, grouped submissively around one august chief, the father,\r\nsimilar families are supposed to have sprung, which, side by side,\r\nconstituted tribes, cities, and states. This familial unit, supposed to\r\nbe primordial, this “cellule” of societies, is held to be particularly\r\nrespectable; the chief who governs it despotically, the father, has\r\nsomething enchanting about him. At his voice the celestial wrath bursts\r\nwithout mercy on the child bold enough to brave it. Even as late as\r\nthe last century, the paternal malediction had the effect of a moral\r\nthunderbolt; in romances and theatrical plays the writers often had\r\nrecourse to it in order to effect the catastrophes of their plots.\r\n\r\nWe are forced in the present day to renounce this traditional notion.\r\nWe must bid adieu to the primitive patriarchate. The patriarchal, or\r\neven simply paternal family, does not date, at least in most cases,\r\nfrom the origin of societies.\r\n\r\nThe truly primitive stock is no other than the clan, that is, a small\r\nconsanguine group in which the kinship is still very much confused.\r\nIt was not in a day that the first men succeeded in constructing\r\ngenealogical trees, or even in determining with any precision the\r\ndegrees of consanguinity. Not only does the father not stand out as\r\na principal personage from the background of the familial clan; he\r\nhas not even yet any recognised social existence in the little group;\r\nin short, the actual physiological father has had in principle no\r\nascertainable relationship with his children, for marriage was anything\r\nbut monandric.\r\n\r\nWithin the primitive social unit, the familial clan, every one was\r\nconsanguine, but in a confused way; the wives had several husbands, and\r\nthe husbands several wives; the degrees of kinship were not individual,\r\nbut applied to classes of individuals. At this period of social\r\ndevelopment it was difficult to distinguish as yet the real from the\r\npossible, fictitious consanguinity from real consanguinity. Every one\r\nhad groups of fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters: filiation and\r\nthe true ties of consanguinity in numerous cases could not be discerned.\r\n\r\nIn these groups of consanguine individuals, these clans with\r\nkinship still confused, the first thing that became most habitually\r\ndifferentiated was not the paternal family, for that could scarcely\r\nexist, seeing that the father of a child was not easy to designate; it\r\nwas the maternal family, which we will now proceed to examine.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[928] McLennan, _Primitive Marriage_, p. 71.\r\n\r\n[929] A.

The small primitive\r\nsocieties founded by these races seem to have begun, not with the\r\nfamily, in the sense we give to this word, but by groups of consanguine\r\nindividuals with still very confused filiation. The familial form which\r\nfirst emerged from this primitive clan was most often a matrimonial\r\nassociation between several sisters on the one hand and several\r\nbrothers on the other. Then, from this household, at once polygamic\r\nand polyandric, sprang sometimes the polyandric family, when several\r\nbrothers had a single wife in common, and sometimes the polygynic\r\nfamily, when a single man married or bought several women, who might,\r\nor might not, be sisters to each other.\r\n\r\nBut has the familial group evolved in the same manner all over the\r\nearth and among all races? Except for the countries previously\r\nenumerated, precise and detailed information is wanting, and we\r\nare reduced to conjectures which are more or less probable. With\r\nrare exceptions, the races which it remains for us to examine have\r\ndefinitely emerged from primitive familial confusion, and they have\r\nadopted either maternal or paternal filiation. Have they first passed\r\nthrough the familial clan with classes of fictitious or real relations?\r\nWe cannot certainly affirm it. The existence of a _totem_ and the\r\ncustom of exogamy seem to bear witness in favour of this hypothesis;\r\nbut these are insufficient proofs. The _totem_ does not necessarily\r\nimply consanguinity; and exogamy may be dictated by very diverse\r\nreasons, for we often find exogamic tribes living side by side with\r\nendogamic tribes.\r\n\r\nWhat is still more general than the clan, is the institution of the\r\nmaternal family, or uterine filiation; but this familial type is not\r\ninvariably deduced from a previous familial clan. Among many animal\r\nspecies the maternal family exists without there ever having been\r\neither clan or _gens_. As a matter of fact, in humanity as well as\r\nin animality, the uterine family establishes itself spontaneously,\r\nwhenever the male abandons the female and her progeny. This familial\r\ntype will therefore necessarily appear in every horde where there is no\r\ndurable pairing of males and females, of men and women. In every ethnic\r\ngroup living in promiscuity, for example, uterine filiation shows\r\nitself, and it will be the same under a polyandric _régime_, unless\r\nfictitious paternity is established. In short, for the adoption of the\r\npaternal family, it is imperative that the wives should be appropriated\r\nby a particular man, though it is of no importance whether the marriage\r\nbe monogamic or polygamic. But this possession of one or more women by\r\none man to the exclusion of all others, presupposes already a complex\r\nsocial condition, which has necessarily been preceded by a period of\r\ngross savagery, when only uterine filiation was possible. Now, it is\r\na rule that ancient customs endure for a long time, and survive the\r\nsocial condition which had given birth to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Family in Africa._\r\n\r\nThe uterine family is far from being rare in negro Africa, but this\r\ndoes not in any way hinder the man from exercising a discretionary\r\npower over his wife or wives, and still more over his children. We\r\nhave previously seen how lamentable the fate of woman is among the\r\nnegro Africans, and how excessive are “the rights of the father of\r\nthe family,” since he can traffic in his children without rebuke.\r\nThis virile despotism may easily coexist with the adoption of uterine\r\nfiliation. In one Kaffir tribe, the men used their own children to\r\nbait their traps for catching lions,[976] and yet maternal filiation\r\nprevails in Kaffraria; only it does not govern inheritance. This mode\r\nof filiation is adopted by other races as well as Kaffirs. “In Guinea,”\r\nsays Bosman,[977] “if it pleases the daughter of a king to marry a\r\nslave, her children are free.” Among the Fantees, the chief slave has\r\nthe rights of succession, to the exclusion of the son; but the latter\r\nis only deprived of paternal succession; the property of his mother, as\r\ndistinct from that of his father, comes to him.[978] At Dahomey there\r\nseems to be, in the royal family, a symbolic survival of the maternal\r\nfamily. At the death of the king, his sister exercises a regency of\r\nseveral days, and her duty is to occupy the throne in reality, and to\r\nremain seated on it as long as a successor has not been appointed.[979]\r\nBut this does not in any way hinder the populations of Dahomey from\r\nadopting as a general custom, not only masculine succession, but even\r\nthe right of primogeniture.[980] Barbarous as Dahomey may be, it is\r\nalready a society of too complex a structure to accommodate itself\r\neasily to the maternal family. Has this savage mode of filiation been\r\nformerly in use there? It is possible; but the short regency of the\r\nking’s sister is a very insufficient proof of it. In eastern Africa,\r\namong the Vouazegouras, and also among the Bangalas of Cassanga, the\r\nuncle has the indefeasible right to sell his nephews, and in so doing\r\nhe has the strong approval of public opinion. “Why,” say they, “should\r\na man remain in need while his brothers and sisters have children?” Yet\r\nthis relates to tribes long under Arab influence. In the same region,\r\nthe Vouamrimas generally consider the son of their sister as their\r\nheir, in preference to their own children.[981] Among the Bazes and the\r\nBareas, succession is also in the maternal line, and the heirs are,\r\nin the first degree, the eldest son of the eldest sister; and in the\r\nsecond degree, the second son of the same sister,[982] etc. In southern\r\nAfrica the children belong to the maternal uncle, who also has the\r\nright to sell them.[983] It is the same among the Basuto Kaffirs. With\r\nthese last, as a Kaffir chief informed me, it is again the nephew who\r\nsucceeds to the throne.[984] The Makololo Kaffirs, however, seem to be\r\nin process of adopting paternal filiation; or at least they combine\r\nit with maternal filiation, by compelling the husband, as Livingstone\r\ninforms us, to redeem his children by the payment of a tax, without\r\nwhich they would belong to the maternal grandfather.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is no uniform rule among the Kaffirs, for Levaillant\r\nhas seen a tribe with whom the inheritance was transmitted at a\r\nman’s death to his wife and male children, to the exclusion of the\r\ndaughters,[985] which is again a transitional _régime_.\r\n\r\nIn some districts of central Africa, among populations that are\r\nhalf-civilised, and more or less converted to Mahometanism, matriarchal\r\ncustoms still persist. On the Niger, at Wowow and at Boussa, it is the\r\ngrandmother who grants or refuses to her grand-daughter the permission\r\nto marry.[986] The curious privilege that, according to Laing, the\r\nSoulima have, to quit their husband when they please, is perhaps of\r\nmatriarchal origin also.[987]\r\n\r\nThe exogamy of the clan, which frequently coexists with uterine\r\nfiliation, is met with here and there in Africa. Burton has proved\r\nthe existence of it among the Somals,[988] and Du Chaillu has found\r\nit at the Gaboon.[989] Traces of the maternal family still exist, or\r\nhave existed, in African societies that are more or less barbarous,\r\nbut which have, however, emerged from savagery; in Madagascar,\r\nNubia, Abyssinia, and especially in ancient Egypt. Among the Hovas\r\nof Madagascar, not only wealth, but political dignities, and even\r\nsacerdotal functions, are transmitted to the nephew, the sister’s son.\r\nThe Saccalavas do the same as the Hovas, and among them the women of\r\nhigh rank willingly take husbands of inferior rank, who simply become\r\ntheir servants. As for the children, they inherit the rank and rights\r\nof their mother.[990] The same customs prevail among the Nubians, or\r\ndid formerly prevail; the Arab chroniclers tell us that among them the\r\nheritage belonged, not to the son of the deceased, but to the nephew,\r\nthe sister’s son. The Nubians justified this custom pertinaciously, by\r\nsaying that the consanguinity of the sister’s son had the advantage of\r\nbeing incontestable.[991] And lastly, Nicholas of Damascus says the\r\nsame thing of the Ethiopians.[992]\r\n\r\nWithout the proof of any absolutely precise text, we have an\r\naccumulation of facts which render it very probable that, in ancient\r\nEgypt, maternal filiation was in force. In a preceding chapter I have\r\nspoken of the exceptional position granted to the free woman in the\r\nkingdom of the Pharaohs. I will recall, in passing, that until the time\r\nof Philometor, who deprived women of the right to dispose of their\r\nproperty, the word _husband_ never occurs in marriage deeds.[993]\r\nBesides this, public deeds often only mention the mother, up to the\r\ntime of this same King Philometor, who, being evidently a determined\r\npartisan of the patriarchate, ordered the names of contractors to be\r\nregistered according to the paternal name.[994] Also, in the valley of\r\nthe Nile, the hieroglyphic funeral inscriptions frequently bear the\r\nname of the mother without indicating that of the father, and it is\r\nonly in demotic inscriptions that paternal filiation is mentioned.[995]\r\nWe must add that in Egypt women could reign, and that during the\r\nlifetime of the monarch who was their husband they divided with him the\r\nsovereign honours, and even, according to Diodorus,[996] received the\r\nlarger share of them. All these facts seem to attest that in Egypt free\r\nwomen enjoyed an exceptionally favourable position, and they render\r\nprobable the ancient existence of uterine filiation in the valley of\r\nthe Nile. There are, however, some contradictory facts, especially the\r\ngenealogy of the chief priests, of which Herodotus speaks, and also\r\nthe incestuous endogamy customary in the royal families. According to\r\nHerodotus, the Egyptian priests showed him, at Thebes, three hundred\r\nand forty-one wooden statues representing high-priests, all born one\r\nof the other in the masculine line: “Each of these statues,” he says,\r\n“represents a Piromis born of a Piromis.”[997] From which it would\r\nresult that in Egypt, at least in the sacerdotal caste, masculine\r\nfiliation was established from the highest antiquity, for a hundred and\r\nforty-one generations represent something like ten or eleven thousand\r\nyears. Maternal filiation is also generally connected with exogamy,\r\nwhile the Pharaohs habitually married their sisters. According to\r\nDiodorus, this was even obligatory.[998] In the ancient royal records\r\nthe qualities of sister and wife of kings are often found united.\r\nUnder the Ptolemies, all the queens have borne both these titles;\r\nand we may perhaps refer to an ancient tradition of Egyptian origin\r\ncertain customs which recently existed in the Soudan, Abyssinia, and\r\nMadagascar. At Massegna, in the Soudan, Barth tells us that Othman\r\nBougoman, Sultan of Massegna, had among his wives one of his sisters\r\nand one of his daughters. At the end of the seventeenth century, the\r\nsister of the king of Abyssinia displayed a sumptuous style of living\r\npeculiarly feminine: “The sister of the emperor appears in public\r\nmounted on a mule richly caparisoned, having by her side her women\r\nbearing a daïs over her. From four to five hundred women surround her,\r\nsinging verses in her praise, and playing the tambour in a lively and\r\ngraceful manner.”[999] And at the present time, among the Malagasy\r\nnobility, marriage between brother and sister is very common.[1000]\r\n\r\nThere is certainly nothing farther from exogamy than marriages between\r\nbrothers and sisters; but, to say the truth, there is no logical and\r\nnecessary connection between the form of filiation and exogamic or\r\nendogamic customs.\r\n\r\nThe Malagasy contract what we should call incestuous marriages,\r\nwhile preserving maternal filiation; the Arabs and Kabyles, on the\r\ncontrary, in obedience to the prescriptions of the Koran, have a\r\nhorror of incest. The sacred book prohibits a man from taking to wife\r\nhis mother, daughter, sister, his paternal or maternal aunt, his\r\ngrand-daughter, his mother-in-law, his daughter-in-law, or even his\r\nnurse and foster-sister. A man was not to marry two sisters at the\r\nsame time.[1001] This is indeed a limited exogamy; and yet the Koran\r\nestablishes the paternal and even patriarchal family very clearly.\r\nThe study of the family in Malaya and among the aborigines of India\r\nwill complete the proof that in the same country, and in the same\r\nrace, various systems of marriage, family, and filiation, may coexist,\r\nand that consequently we must guard against formulating too strict\r\nsociological laws in regard to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Family in Malaya._\r\n\r\nAt Sumatra there were three kinds of marriages--1st, the wife, or\r\nrather the family of the wife, bought the man, who henceforth became\r\nher property, worked for her, possessed nothing of his own, was liable\r\nto be dismissed, and could commit no fault without the proprietary\r\nfamily being responsible for it, exactly as the Roman master answered\r\nfor his slaves; 2nd, the man and the woman could marry on a footing of\r\nequality; 3rd, the man bought his wife or wives.[1002] The first form\r\nof marriage, that of servitude of the man, who, instead of marrying,\r\nis married by the family of his wife, has fallen into desuetude in\r\nMalaya, but it has left behind it, in certain districts, the system of\r\nmaternal filiation. It is the maternal uncle who is the head of the\r\nfamily, or, in default of him, the eldest son of the wife’s family.\r\nIf there is neither uncle nor son old enough, it is the mother who\r\nbecomes the head of the family, and the father only takes her place\r\nin case she has disappeared, and when all the children are minors. At\r\nthe death of a man, his property does not go to his wife or children,\r\nbut to his maternal family, and in the first place to his brothers\r\nand sisters. The married man also continues to live in his maternal\r\nfamily; it is the field of his own family that he cultivates, and he\r\nonly accidentally assists his wife.[1003] In short, under this system\r\nthe individual, whether man or woman, is not set free in the least from\r\nthe family in which he is born; it is for this family that the woman\r\nbears children; filiation and inheritance must therefore follow the\r\nmaternal line. But it is not at all the same throughout Malaya. Marsden\r\ntells us that a man sometimes buys his wife by giving a sister in\r\nexchange;[1004] he must therefore be the proprietor of his sister, and\r\nconsequently of the wife whom he procures by means of this barter.\r\n\r\nIn the Arroo Isles the men buy their wives, by giving gongs, clothes,\r\netc., to the parents of the women.[1005]\r\n\r\nAt Timor the son-in-law buys his wife thus from his father-in-law, and\r\nthe latter can remain owner of the children if they are not included\r\nin the bargain;[1006] but these customs are not easily compatible with\r\nthe system of the maternal family, and, taken altogether, they prove\r\nthat in Malaya the family is not by any means constituted in a uniform\r\nmanner. We shall see that it is the same with the primitive races of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Family among the Naïrs of Malabar._\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we have to inquire what the family is among the\r\nNaïrs of Malabar, whose curious polyandry I have previously described.\r\nThe Naïrs of Malabar are not by any means savages; they form an\r\naristocratic caste. We have seen how, from a very early age (ten\r\nto twelve years), the young Naïr girls, after having been solemnly\r\ndeflowered by a stranger, who has been paid to perform this task,\r\npractised the widest polyandry, without any other restriction than\r\nthe prohibitions relative to caste and tribe. As is usual and even\r\nnatural, Naïr polyandry coexists with a system of maternal filiation.\r\nPrecautions are taken in order that the free and numerous unions of\r\nthe Naïr ladies should not destroy the family. The Naïr husbands are\r\nreduced to the modest _rôle_ of progenitors; and it is to the wife that\r\nthe fortune of the family belongs. It is not, however, the mother who\r\ngoverns the family, but her brother. To this brother belongs the duty\r\nof bringing up his nephews, of protecting them, and of mourning for\r\nthem, if they happen to die; in reality, he is an avuncular father, and\r\nwhen he dies his nephews inherit his personal property. In the Naïr\r\nfamily the polyandrous mother is much respected, and the next in honour\r\nto her is her eldest daughter, who will replace her in her _rôle_ of\r\nmother-bee, the producer of children. The Naïr husbands, the fathers,\r\nonly enter the house of their common wife by turns and on certain days;\r\nthey have not even the right to sit down by the side of their wife or\r\ntheir children; they are mere passing guests, almost strangers.[1007]\r\n\r\nIf we regard these facts on a certain side, it appears as if we may at\r\nlast have found among the Naïrs, in a country where the matriarchate\r\nincontestably reigns, the legal pre-eminence of woman over man, or the\r\n_materna potestas_. It is, in fact, the Naïr woman who possesses; it\r\nis through her that wealth is transmitted, and, given the _régime_ of\r\nfree polyandry, it is difficult for Naïr children to know their own\r\nfather. Moreover, in various polyandric countries of Malabar, the\r\npre-eminence of the woman in the family has influenced the political\r\norganisation, and thus an entire female feudal system has arisen, the\r\nbonds of suzerainty and vassalage reposing on a fictitious polyandry.\r\nThus, in February 1887, the English journals announced that the Sultan\r\nof the Laccadives, having become the vassal of England, had notified\r\nto his subjects his new position by means of a proclamation, in which\r\nhe explained that he had ceased to be the _husband_ and subject of his\r\nancient suzerain, the Bibi of Cannanor; for by a special favour the\r\ngovernment of Ceylon had consented to admit him to the number of the\r\n_husbands_, that is to say, of the direct vassals, of the Queen of\r\nEngland. We must note that for the Indians of this region the Queen\r\nof England is “the daughter” of the East India Company, and lives in\r\na palace in London with many men. And now what is the real value of\r\nthis polyandric matriarchate? It is surely more apparent than real.\r\nAmong the Naïrs, as everywhere else, property assures to the man or\r\nwoman who possesses it an importance in proportion to its value. The\r\nNaïr lady then, being a proprietor, is highly esteemed. But it does not\r\nfollow that this esteem is equal to undisputed domination. Doubtless\r\namong the Naïrs the man, as husband, does not exist; nevertheless he\r\nis a warrior, and even a very fierce one. But military force has this\r\nin common with money, that it is nowhere despised. Therefore, in the\r\nfamily of his sister, the Naïr man is anything but a subordinate. We\r\nhave just seen this. It is he who governs and brings up the children of\r\nhis sister by her numerous husbands. He is, in reality, the chief of\r\nhis sister’s family, and what he loses as husband he gains as uncle.\r\n\r\nReduced to their true value, the polyandry and the familial _régime_ of\r\nthe Naïrs still remain a sociological fact of the greatest interest.\r\nIt is at once the most complete and the most logical of polyandric\r\nsystems. In reality, the Naïr marriage does not only or specially\r\ninclude groups of brothers or sisters; full liberty is given to the\r\nwoman, save only the restrictions of class. There is no attempt, as\r\nin Thibet, to create a masculine pseudo-filiation, by arbitrarily\r\nattributing such or such children to such or such husbands. Among\r\nthe Naïrs, the maternal family is instituted in all its plenitude;\r\nand lastly, their polyandry is in no way thwarted by the proportion\r\nof the sexes, for if the woman may contract marriage with several\r\nmen, each one of the latter in his turn has power to enter several\r\nconjugal associations. This matrimonial _régime_ is therefore perfectly\r\ncompatible with the maintenance of the population and the equilibrium\r\nof the sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _The Family among the Aborigines of Bengal._\r\n\r\nIf we proceed with our investigations by studying the familial and\r\nmatrimonial _régime_ of the aborigines of Bengal, we shall find, among\r\npopulations having probably a common origin, systems of family and\r\nmarriage which are very dissimilar.\r\n\r\nHere and there we discover the maternal family, or customs proving that\r\nthis familial fashion has formerly been in force.\r\n\r\nAccording to Buchanan, among the Buntar, who are neighbours to the\r\nNaïrs, a father is free during his lifetime to make presents to his\r\nchildren, but at his death all that he possesses goes to his sisters\r\nand their children. The Kochh, also, have no kinship or succession\r\nexcept through the women. The mothers arrange the marriages; the\r\nfathers never interfere, and the husband goes to live with his wife and\r\nhis mother-in-law, whom he obeys. As for widows, they choose themselves\r\nyoung husbands when they are rich. Among the Yerkalas of Southern\r\nIndia, the maternal uncle has the right to claim for his sons the two\r\neldest daughters of his sister.[1008] Among the Khasias, it is to the\r\nson of the sister that the power of the Rajah is transmitted; but\r\nthis princess (_Kunwari_) has not the right to marry herself; she is\r\nsubject to reasons of state, and her husband is chosen by the assembled\r\npeople.[1009] The Garos have established the rule, that in marriages\r\nthe right of initiative belongs to the woman; it is the young girl who\r\ndistinguishes the man of her choice, tells him so, and invites him to\r\nfollow her. Any advance made by a man is considered as an insult to all\r\nthe clan (_mahari_) of the girl, and in order to expiate it, libations\r\nof beer and sacrifices of pigs are required, all of them at the expense\r\nof the _mahari_ of the man. The marriage of the Garos answers exactly\r\nto the ceremony of capture, only the actors change parts; it is here\r\nthe bridegroom who pretends to refuse the bride, runs away and is\r\nconducted by force to his future wife amidst the lamentations of his\r\nrelations.[1010] At the death of a man, among the Garos, the widow\r\nremains mistress of the house, but the other property passes to a\r\ncollateral heir, who marries the widow and sometimes her daughter also.\r\n\r\nIf we were to confine ourselves to the consideration and interpretation\r\nof these facts only, we might naturally conclude that the familial\r\n_régime_ of the aborigines of Bengal is maternal; but contradictory\r\nfacts are not wanting. Among the Bhuiyas, although the demand in\r\nmarriage is made by the girls, as with the Garos, the sons receive the\r\nnames of their male ascendants; the eldest son takes the name of the\r\ngrandfather; the second son takes that of the great-grandfather, and\r\nthe names of collaterals are given to the other sons.[1011] Among the\r\nMuasis, it is the father who negotiates the marriage of his daughter,\r\nor who sells her, rather, for a certain number of measures of rice\r\nsolemnly measured and delivered.[1012]\r\n\r\nAmong the Malers of Rajmahal, it is again the father who places his\r\ndaughter’s hand in that of her future husband and exhorts him to love\r\nhis wife.[1013] The Kandhs have adopted succession in the masculine\r\nline, with a division of property amongst the sons.[1014] The servitude\r\nof the women amongst the Korwas is very great; they are oppressed with\r\nwork, and till the fields and gain the daily bread, whilst the men\r\nhunt or repose.[1015] The Mishmis buy their wives, have as many as\r\nthey can procure, and own them like chattels, since at a man’s death\r\nall his wives, except the mother of the heir, pass to the nearest male\r\nrelation.[1016] Among the Mundas, after the decease of the father of\r\na family, the sons live together until the majority of the youngest\r\nof them; they then proceed to divide the property, including their\r\nsisters, who are exactly assimilated to cattle.[1017] The Oraons share\r\nthe widows amongst the brothers and cousins in the same way as the\r\nMundas share their sisters.[1018]\r\n\r\nWe find, therefore, no uniformity in the familial organisation of the\r\nBengalese aborigines; and it is the same in regard to their exogamy\r\nor endogamy. Exogamy is common. Thus the Juangas are divided into\r\nexogamous tribes.[1019] The Khonds think it humiliating to marry the\r\nwomen of their own tribe. It is more manly, in their opinion, to go\r\nand _take_ a wife from a distant neighbourhood.[1020] The Munniporees\r\nare divided into four clans, who do not intermarry.[1021] Among the\r\nSantals, it is forbidden to men to marry in their own clan; but\r\ntheir children belong to the paternal clan.[1022] The Limboos (near\r\nDarjeeling) are also exogamous, but evidently oscillate between the\r\nmaternal and paternal family; for the daughters remain in the tribe\r\nor rather in the clan of their mother, whilst the sons belong to the\r\npaternal clan, but only after the father has paid a certain sum to the\r\nmother.[1023] The Garos are divided into several clans or _maharis_,\r\nand, amongst them, a man must not marry in his own clan, but in another\r\nappointed clan, in which from time immemorial his family has been\r\naccustomed to take wives.\r\n\r\nOther aborigines of Bengal are endogamous. Thus it is imperative for\r\nthe daughters of the Abors to marry in their own clan, or the sun and\r\nmoon would cease to shine.[1024] According to Heber, the Karens of\r\nTenasserim are more than endogamous, for among them marriages between\r\nbrother and sister, father and daughter, are frequent enough in the\r\npresent day.[1025]\r\n\r\nWhat may we deduce from these contradictory facts? A general\r\nconclusion, which I have expressed several times over: namely, that in\r\nwhat concerns the evolution of marriage and of the family, there is no\r\nabsolute law. Nevertheless, by reason of the familial and matrimonial\r\nconfusion usual in the greater number of primitive societies, maternal\r\nfiliation has been adopted more often than paternal, and has frequently\r\npreceded it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _The Couvade._\r\n\r\nThere is a custom, at first sight extraordinary but still common\r\nenough, which must have arisen during transitional epochs, when,\r\npolygamic or monogamic marriage having become established, the husbands\r\nhave exerted themselves to affirm their parental rights, and to\r\nsubstitute masculine filiation for the ancient uterine filiation. In\r\nthe same way as in certain countries, Abyssinia,[1026] for example,\r\nin order to proclaim an adoption, the adoptive father simulates some\r\nmaternal practice, sometimes goes so far as to offer his breast\r\nsolemnly to his adoptive son, so, in very different countries, the\r\nhusband has found no better way to prove his paternity than to simulate\r\nchildbirth; and hence the very singular custom of the couvade.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, it seems very foolish for the husband to take to his\r\nbed immediately after the delivery of his wife, and for a certain\r\nnumber of days to be nursed and tended by the mother herself.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the custom has often been questioned. It will not be\r\nout of place, therefore, to quote authentic facts which put all doubt\r\nto silence. These facts are numerous enough, and have been observed in\r\nvarious parts of the globe; in America, Asia, and Europe.\r\n\r\nIn New Mexico, among the Lagunero and the Ahomana, when a woman is\r\ndelivered of a child, the father goes to bed for six or seven days,\r\nand scrupulously abstains from eating fish or meat.[1027] As soon as a\r\nCarib became a father, he at once went to bed and simulated childbirth\r\nby suitable cries and contortions; the women of the hamlet hastened\r\nto his side and congratulated him on his happy delivery.[1028] The\r\nChoctaw Redskins formerly had an analogous custom. Brett and Im Thurn\r\nhave observed this “lying-in” among the Indians of Guiana. The father,\r\nBrett says, goes to his hammock quite naked, taking the most indecent\r\nposture, and he remains there some days as if he were ill, receiving\r\nthe congratulations of his friends and tended by the women of the\r\nneighbourhood, whilst the mother of the new-born infant goes about her\r\ncooking without receiving any attention.[1029]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the Jesuit Dobritzhoffer, in regard to the Abipones,\r\nis not less explicit: “Among the Abipones of South America,” he says,\r\n“as soon as the wife has given birth to a child, the husband is put to\r\nbed, and carefully tended; he fasts for a certain time. You would swear\r\nthat it is he who has just been delivered. I had formerly read of this\r\nand smiled at it, not being able to credit such folly, and supposing\r\nthat this barbarous custom was related more as a joke than seriously,\r\nbut at last I have seen it with my own eyes amongst them.”[1030] More\r\nrecent testimony confirms what I have just quoted. In 1842 M. Mazé,\r\nCommissioner-General in French Guiana, himself proved the custom of\r\ncouvade among the Indian tribes on the river Oyapok. In 1852 M. Voisin,\r\njustice of the peace in a commune of French Guiana, ascending in a\r\ncanoe the river Mana, received hospitality one night in the hut of some\r\nGalibi Indians. On awaking he learned that during the night, and behind\r\na partition of foliage which separated his hammock from the household\r\nof his hosts, a child had been born. The mother had uttered no sound,\r\nand at daybreak M. Voisin saw her go to the river-side and make her\r\ntoilet, then take her new-born child and throw it several times into\r\nthe water, catching it as it rose to the surface, and then wiping it\r\nwith her hands. The husband, on the contrary, remained all the while\r\nin his hammock, acting the invalid, and receiving with the greatest\r\nseriousness the attention lavished on him by his wife.[1031]\r\n\r\nThe couvade comedy is not always so complete. In certain tribes it is\r\nattenuated, and becomes more symbolic.\r\n\r\nThus in California, when the mother is delivered, the father is content\r\nto keep to the house and abstain from eating fish and meat.[1032]\r\n\r\nAmong various tribes of South America the husband of the woman limits\r\nthe practice to a few hygienic precautions; this is the couvade reduced\r\nto its simplest expression.[1033]\r\n\r\nThis custom was found in Asia, among the Tartars, by Marco Polo. It\r\nstill exists in Bengal, among the Larkas, although attenuated; on\r\nthe occasion of a birth the parents quit the house, the wife and\r\nhusband are both declared unclean for eight days, and during that\r\ntime the husband cooks the food. After which the masculine filiation\r\nof the child is proclaimed by solemnly giving him the name of his\r\ngrandfather.[1034] We shall be mistaken if we imagine that the couvade\r\nis special to very inferior races. The Greco-Roman writers have quoted\r\na certain number of examples observed among the barbarians of the\r\nancient world. Strabo relates that the Iberian women, after the example\r\nof those of the Celts, Thracians, and Scythians, quit their beds as\r\nsoon as they are delivered, and give them up to their husbands, whom\r\nthey tend.[1035] Diodorus tells us that in Corsica, after a woman\r\nhas given birth to a child, the husband goes to bed as if he were\r\nill, and he remains there an appointed number of days like a lying-in\r\nwoman.[1036]\r\n\r\nIn his _Argonautica_ Apollonius of Rhodes speaks of a people of\r\nTibarenedes, on the north-west coast of Asia Minor, who had the custom\r\nof the couvade: “As soon as the married women are delivered, their\r\nhusbands groan, lie on beds, and cover their heads. All this time their\r\nwives give them strengthening food, and prepare baths for them suitable\r\nfor lying-in women.”[1037] It is probable that more than one trace of\r\nthis “lying-in” still exists in Europe, in superstitious and popular\r\npractices. Quite recently a Russian has informed me that it is still in\r\nuse in the Baltic provinces, but naturally in a form of survival in\r\nwhich the meaning is lost. It is, however, complete enough; the husband\r\ngoes to bed, utters groans and cries, and his neighbours hasten to his\r\nside. And lastly, M. Léon Donnat told me lately that he had discovered\r\nthe couvade still practised in the little island of Marken, in the\r\nZuydersee.\r\n\r\nHowever strange it may be, a custom that is thus widely spread in\r\ncountries, races, and epochs extremely diverse must have had a serious\r\n_raison d’être_. It cannot be attributed to mere caprice.\r\n\r\nNow the only plausible explanation is that which gives to the couvade\r\nthe value of our registry of birth. Not, perhaps, all over the world,\r\nbut here and there, at the moment when the effort was being made\r\nto found the paternal family, or at least to determine masculine\r\nfiliation, some very simple-minded tribes conceived the idea of\r\nsymbolising the share of the man in procreation by the gross mimicry\r\nof childbirth. By this practice, so well calculated to strike the\r\nattention, the father openly affirmed his paternity, and doubtless\r\nacquired certain rights over the new-born child. Let us note that the\r\ncustom has been especially preserved among the American Indians, that\r\nis to say, in a country where the system of the maternal family has\r\nbeen, and still is, widely spread. The couvade probably represents\r\nan effort to emerge from it. It shows that the man will no longer\r\nshare his wife or wives, that he claims to have children which are\r\ncertainly his own, and who will doubtless inherit his possessions. It\r\nis, in short, a revolt of individualism against primitive communism.\r\nThe mimicry is gross and strange, but in a social condition where\r\nthere exists neither lawyer, nor mayor, nor register of civil acts,\r\ntestimonial proof is the great resource, and, in order to make it\r\nsure and durable, men have willingly had recourse to striking and\r\ncomplicated practices which are calculated to engrave the remembrance\r\nof a fact on the memory of those present.\r\n\r\nThe procedure of primitive Rome offers us many examples of the same\r\nkind; and notably in the formalities of emancipation, when the Roman\r\nfather made, three times in succession, a simulation of selling his\r\nson.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. _The Primitive Family._\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages I have collected together, with as much\r\nexactitude as I could, all that we know of the familial clan and the\r\nmaternal family. It would be bold to assert that such have been the\r\nprimitive and always necessary forms of the family. It is indisputable,\r\nhowever, that they are or have been very common in all countries and\r\nin all races. But these are types of familial association already\r\nregulated and complicated. Anterior to them there must have existed, in\r\nthe little human hordes, a complete anarchy, most often characterised\r\nby the despotism of the strongest male, dominating a small flock of\r\nwomen and children, who were meekly submissive to his caprices--in\r\nfact, a sort of bestial patriarchate. Among thinly-scattered races,\r\nwithout intelligence or industry, practical monogamy was established at\r\nthe very outset. We know that this was the case with the stupid Veddahs\r\nof Ceylon, when they wandered in simple families in the virgin forests\r\nof their island, incapable of constituting even the smallest horde. As\r\nsoon as men have grouped themselves in small societies, regulated even\r\nin a slight degree, the familial clan with its confused kinship must\r\nfrequently have been constituted, but on plans which were necessarily\r\nvariable according to the conditions and exigencies of the social life.\r\nAll that was possible has surely been attempted; sometimes regulated\r\npromiscuity, for each man claimed his rights, sometimes the mixed\r\npolyandric and polygynic household, elsewhere simple polyandry, when\r\nthe women were scarce, and at other times monogamy.\r\n\r\nI repeat, all that was compatible with the maintenance of the little\r\nsocial group must have been tried at first; and then selection assured\r\nthe permanent adoption of such or such a system. As soon as men began\r\nto take note of descent, it was always uterine filiation that they held\r\nin account; paternal descent was less evident, and less easy to prove;\r\nit has been nearly everywhere the latest, and the widely-spread custom\r\nof the couvade proves that it was not established without difficulty.\r\nIt has ended, however, by triumphing, all over the world, in the\r\nstates that are still barbarous, but which have a complex social and\r\npolitical structure, where the primitive tribal _régime_ has more or\r\nless disappeared, and where a line of demarcation sufficiently strong\r\nseparates the interests of the individual from those of the group to\r\nwhich he belongs. In short, the social transformation from which the\r\npaternal family has arisen has nearly always coincided with a radical\r\nchange in the _régime_ of property, which has simultaneously become\r\nindividual or, at least, familial.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[976] Layland, _Journal of Ethnological Society_, 1869.\r\n\r\n[977] Bosman, _Voyage en Guinée_, p. 197.\r\n\r\n[978] Bowdich, _Observations sur le Gouvernement des Achantis_\r\n(collection Walkenær, t. xii.).\r\n\r\n[979] A.

Doubtless\r\nthe white races have ended by excelling the others, and by attaining\r\na higher degree of moral, social, and intellectual development.\r\nNevertheless, the ethnic groups, belonging to the races classed\r\ntogether _en bloc_ as inferior, have emerged from savagery, and formed\r\nlarge societies, which have been veritable training schools for the men\r\nof their race.\r\n\r\nNow, in all the States which have succeeded in attaining some degree\r\nof civilisation, the paternal family is the type that has been finally\r\nadopted. It was thus in Peru, in Mexico, and even in ancient Egypt,\r\nwhere King Philometor gave the finishing stroke to the maternal family\r\nwhich had so long flourished in the valley of the Nile. With much more\r\nreason in China, a country very civilised after its own fashion, an\r\nanalogous evolution must have been effected. Indeed, in China proper,\r\nthere are scarcely any traces of the maternal family left; but they are\r\nstill visible in Japan, whose civilisation has been entirely borrowed\r\nfrom China.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, as formerly among the Basques, filiation is subordinated to\r\nthe transmission of the patrimony whole and inalienated. It is to the\r\nfirst-born, whether boy or girl, that the inheritance is transmitted,\r\nand he or she is forbidden to abandon it. At the time of marriage\r\nthe husband or wife must take the name of the heir or heiress, who\r\nmarries and personifies the property. Filiation is therefore sometimes\r\nmaternal and sometimes paternal; but the maternal uncle still bears the\r\nname of “second little father”; the paternal aunt is called “little\r\nmother,” the paternal uncle is called “little father,” etc.[1038]\r\nMarriage between groups of brothers and other groups of sisters has\r\nbeen common enough in primitive societies to enable us to see in this\r\nfamilial nomenclature the traces of one of those ancient unions at once\r\nmonogamic and polygamic.\r\n\r\nIn China the language itself attests the ancient existence of a\r\nmarriage contracted by a group of brothers having their wives in\r\ncommon, but not marrying their sisters. A Chinaman always calls the\r\nsons of his brother his “sons,” whilst he considers those of his\r\nsister as his nephews;[1039] but the virtual, or rather fictitious\r\nfathers, brothers, and sons, are distinguished from the real fathers,\r\nbrothers, and sons, by the epithet “class” added to their appellation.\r\nThus they say, “class-father, class-son, class-brother”--that is to\r\nsay, the man who belongs to the class of the father, to that of the\r\nson, or to that of the brother. It is therefore simply the American\r\nnomenclature perfected.[1040] We have previously seen that in China\r\nproper, not only the paternal family, but the patriarchate, are\r\nrigorously established; that woman is in extreme subjection, and always\r\ndisinherited;[1041] but certain impediments to marriage can only relate\r\nto an ancient familial organisation which has now disappeared. In all\r\nthe vast Chinese empire there are scarcely more than from one to two\r\nhundred family names, and the Chinese call themselves the “people of a\r\nhundred families.” Now in China all marriage between persons bearing\r\nthe same name is prohibited.[1042] In certain villages every one has\r\nthe same family name; two or three thousand persons, for example, are\r\ncalled “sheep,” “ox,” “horse,” etc., all of them appellations agreeing\r\nwell with clans having corresponding _totems_.[1043] But however it\r\nmay have been in the past, at the present day masculine filiation is\r\nwell established in China, and nine degrees of kinship in the direct\r\nline are distinguished, which an old Chinese author has enumerated\r\nas follows:--“All men who come into the world have nine degrees of\r\nkinship--namely, my own generation in the first place, then that of\r\nmy father, of my grandfather, and of the father and grandfather of my\r\ngrandfather. In a descending line come the generation of my son, that\r\nof my grandson, then that of his son and his grandson. All the members\r\nof one same generation are brothers to each other.”[1044] Let us note\r\nthat this filiation, short as it is, is still associated with kinship\r\nby classes.\r\n\r\nDoubtless these accounts, taken alone, would be insufficient, but\r\nunited with those which the study of the family among the Australians,\r\nthe Redskins, the Tamils, etc., has furnished us with, they warrant us\r\nin believing that the Chinese paternal family is the last term of an\r\nevolution having for its starting-point the familial clan, and having\r\npassed through the maternal family.\r\n\r\nLet us add, in conclusion, that the system of fictitious kinships is\r\nreflected throughout the governmental organisation of China. In reality\r\nthe political structure of China is only an enlarged copy of the\r\nfamily. The emperor is the reputed father and even mother of all the\r\nempire. The mandarin who governs a town is the “father” of that town,\r\nand he himself has for “governmental father” the mandarin of a superior\r\ngrade, whom he obeys.[1045]\r\n\r\nWe shall now discover traces of a similar evolution of the family among\r\nthe Semites and Berbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Family among Semitic Races._\r\n\r\nWhen we read the word “patriarch” in our current literature, our\r\nthoughts instantly fly to the chief of the ancient Semitic, and\r\nespecially the Hebraic family, the little tyrant holding grouped\r\nunder his despotic sway his wives, children, and slaves--that is to\r\nsay, the patriarchate in all its severity, with the power of life and\r\ndeath attributed to the patriarch. But this Semitic patriarch has\r\nnot existed from the beginning; he is the result of a long anterior\r\nevolution, and, like so many other peoples, the Semites have begun with\r\nthe confused kinship of the familial clan. We have previously found,\r\nin studying primitive marriage among the Arabs, an ancient _régime_ of\r\nfree polyandry, analogous to that of the Naïrs. At this distant epoch\r\nthe woman still bore children for her clan, and this clan was so much\r\nlike a large family, that in the present day even, in certain parts of\r\nArabia, the word used for clan literally signifies “flesh.”[1046] To be\r\nof the same clan, therefore, was to be of the same flesh.\r\n\r\nIt was in a relatively recent epoch that paternal filiation was\r\nestablished among the Arabs. In the time of the prophet the\r\nprohibitions of marriage were still on the maternal side,[1047] and\r\nin all ages the collateral kinship with uncles and aunts has been\r\nconsidered very close in Arabia.[1048]\r\n\r\nAmong the Hebrews, individual property was instituted in very early\r\ntimes, for it is alluded to in Genesis.[1049] But various customs show\r\nclearly the ancient existence of communal clans. Thus the inheritance,\r\nespecially the paternal inheritance, must remain in the clan. Marriage\r\nin the tribe is obligatory for daughters: “Let them marry to whom they\r\nthink best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they\r\nmarry. So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove\r\nfrom tribe to tribe; for every one of the children of Israel shall keep\r\nhimself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.”[1050]\r\n\r\nMoses instituted three classes of heirs: first the children, then the\r\nagnates, and then the members of the clan or gentiles.[1051] The Hebrew\r\nfather did not inherit from his son, nor the grandfather from his\r\ngrandson, which seems to indicate an ancient epoch, when the children\r\ndid not yet belong to the clan of their father.\r\n\r\nFor a long time among the Hebrews the german sister was distinguished\r\nfrom the uterine sister; the kinship with this last was considered much\r\ncloser. In primitive Judæa a man could marry the first, but not the\r\nsecond. To the King of Egypt and to Abimelech, who reproached Abraham\r\nfor having passed Sarah off as his sister, the patriarch replies: “For\r\nindeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, _but not\r\nthe daughter of my mother_, and she became my wife.” In the same way\r\nTamar could become the wife of Amnon, for she was only his paternal\r\nsister.[1052] The father of Moses and Aaron married his father’s\r\nsister, who was not legally his relation.[1053] Abraham himself could\r\nmarry his paternal sister, and his brother Nabor took to wife his\r\nfraternal niece, the daughter of his brother.[1054] But by degrees\r\npaternal kinship was recognised by the same title as maternal kinship,\r\nand Leviticus advances as far as to expressly forbid marriage with\r\nfather’s sisters as well as with mother’s sisters,[1055] “whether\r\nthey be born at home or abroad.” Doubtless all these indications have\r\ntheir value; they are, however, only indications, and it is especially\r\nin placing them by the side of similar facts observed amongst other\r\npeoples where the existence of the maternal family and the familial\r\nclan is indisputable, that we are inclined to accord to them the same\r\nsignificance. In short, it is clear that the Hebrews early adopted\r\npaternal filiation and the patriarchate.\r\n\r\nThe memory of a distant epoch of confused kinship and of free sexual\r\nunions had, however, remained in Semitic tradition. Sanchoniathon,\r\nindeed, in his _History of Phœnicia_, says that the first men bore the\r\nname of their mother, because then the women yielded themselves without\r\nshame to the first comer.[1056] Among the Berbers familial evolution is\r\nmuch easier to follow than with the Semites, and its lower phases are\r\nmore evident.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Family among the Berbers._\r\n\r\nDuring late years the meaning of the word “Berber” has become\r\nconsiderably widened. We are now inclined to consider as varieties of\r\nthe same very old race the men of Cro-Magnon, the ancient inhabitants\r\nof the cave of Mentone, the ancient Vascons, the Cantabrians, Iberians,\r\nGuanchos, Kabyles, Berbers, and Touaregs, etc. All these peoples are\r\nthought to belong to one great human type, which we may call Berber,\r\nand of which numerous representatives still exist. Anterior to all\r\nAsiatic migration, and from the time of the stone age, this race seems\r\nto have occupied the south of Gaul and Spain, the Canary Isles, and\r\nNorthern Africa. At the present day the most important epigonic groups\r\nof the Berber race are the Kabyles and the Touaregs of the Sahara.\r\nSeveral writers of antiquity have told us how the family of the ancient\r\nBerbers was formerly instituted, and we know _de visu_ what it is\r\namong contemporary Berbers. We are therefore able to give a rough\r\noutline of it.\r\n\r\nThe general characteristics of the Berber family seem to have been a\r\nprivileged position accorded to women and maternal filiation, with\r\ntendencies even to the matriarchate. Speaking of the Cantabrians,\r\nStrabo writes: “Among the Cantabrians usage requires that the husband\r\nshall bring a dower to his wife, and the daughters inherit, being\r\ncharged with the marriage of their brothers, which constitutes a kind\r\nof gynecocracy.”[1057] The word gynecocracy is surely too strong. We\r\nhave here probably an account of a custom which still exists in Japan,\r\nand which existed quite recently in Basque countries, that of leaving\r\nto the first-born, whether boy or girl, the administration of the\r\ninalienable patrimony of the family, and of obliging his or her wedded\r\npartner to take the name and abode of the family. This is what M. le\r\nPlay has formerly called the family-stock; but this family-stock may,\r\nand doubtless must, have co-existed primitively with maternal filiation.\r\n\r\nThis last is still in force among the Touaregs of the Sahara, and I\r\nhave previously spoken of the great independence which their women\r\nenjoy, and especially the rich and noble ladies. At Rhât, for example,\r\nby inheritances and by the accumulation of productions, it has come to\r\npass that nearly the whole of the real property has fallen into the\r\nhands of the women.[1058] We know that in ancient Egypt, where the\r\nBerbers were largely represented, the women also enjoyed a very similar\r\nposition. As a consequence of this _régime_, the rights and pretensions\r\nof the Berber ladies have become so inconvenient for the men, that many\r\nof them prefer to marry slaves.[1059] The family among the Touaregs\r\nwill surely evolve, as it formerly did in Egypt, and as it has done\r\nwith the Kabyles, where the most rigorous patriarchate has at length\r\nreplaced the ancient maternal family. In Kabyle, however, traces of the\r\nancient organisation, anterior to Rome and to Islamism, still exist.\r\nThe Kabyle village has, in its tribe, a political personality which\r\nstrongly recalls the clan. Many customs, indeed, are evident survivals\r\nof an ancient communal organisation. Thus, with the Kabyles, mutual\r\nassistance between fellow-citizens is a strict duty. Even in a foreign\r\nland the fellow-citizen must be helped, at the risk of all interests\r\nand at the peril of one’s life. Whoever fails in this duty incurs\r\npublic contempt; he is even punished with a fine, and made responsible\r\nfor the losses suffered by the deserted compatriot. Even the Kabyle of\r\nanother tribe must, at need, be succoured, or his tribe may bring a\r\nplaint before the _djemâa_ of the tribe to which the egoist belongs,\r\nand the latter is punished or reprimanded.\r\n\r\nIn a Kabyle village, when an individual erects a building, he has\r\na right to the assistance of all the inhabitants. In the same\r\nway the greater part of the field labour is performed by mutual\r\nassistance.[1060] But all this refers to the men; for women there\r\nremains no trace either of the maternal family or of the more or less\r\nserious advantages which it generally confers on wives and mothers. One\r\ncustom, however, and one only, still recalls ancient manners; this is\r\n“the right of rebellion,” of which I have spoken elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe are acquainted with the date at which the last seal was placed on\r\nthe subjection of the Kabyle woman. It was only a hundred and twenty\r\nyears ago that the men refused henceforth a legal position to women in\r\nthe succession of males.[1061] At present the Kabyle woman, whether\r\nmarried or not, no longer inherits.[1062]\r\n\r\nThe Kabyle _Kanouns_ admit six categories of heirs: 1st, the _açeb_\r\nor universal heirs--that is to say, all the male descent, the direct\r\nline through males, and all the collaterals descending through males of\r\nthe paternal branch; 2nd, the ascendants through males on the paternal\r\nside--the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather; 3rd, the uterine\r\nbrother, heir to a legal portion; 4th, the master and the freed man,\r\n_açeb_ heirs of each other; 5th, the _karouba_--that is to say, the\r\ncommunity having its assembly of major citizens, the _djemâa_, and\r\nbeing a civil personage;[1063] 6th, the _ensemble_ of the _karoubas_,\r\nconstituting the village. However, the collaterals of all degrees may\r\ninherit in default of ascendants and descendants.[1064] In all this\r\nlist there is no mention of women.\r\n\r\nIn fact, whatever property a Kabyle woman may have been able\r\nlaboriously to amass, it falls to the male descent, to the ascendants,\r\nor to the husband, or to the collaterals in the paternal line. It is\r\nonly in default of this cloud of male heirs that the succession to the\r\nproperty gained by a Kabyle woman devolves at last on her daughters,\r\nor her mother or grandmother.[1065] From all the preceding facts, and\r\nin spite of gaps in our information, we may, however, suppose that in\r\nthe Berber world also the family has evolved in passing through three\r\ndegrees, which we have already found amongst various races, and which\r\nare the communal clan, the maternal family, and the patriarchate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Family in Persia._\r\n\r\nThis evolution seems therefore very common; it is a general fact, but\r\nwe are not yet warranted in calling it a law. Thus, as far as our\r\ninformation goes, which it is true is not very complete, no trace of it\r\nis to be found among the ancient Persians, with whom we will now begin\r\nour interrogation of the Aryan races, from the point of view of their\r\nfamilial organisation. If the familial clan with confused kinship has\r\never existed in ancient Persia, it can only have been at an extremely\r\nremote epoch; there is no trace of it in the _Avesta_. And more than\r\nthis, the most ancient accounts show us the patriarchal family, in the\r\nHebraic sense of the word, instituted among the Mazdeans: a legitimate\r\nwife, purchased from her parents, and by the side of her a greater or\r\nless number of concubines; and lastly, dominating all the rest, the\r\nfather of the family, having the right of life or death over the wives\r\nand children.[1066]\r\n\r\nNot only does the clan not exist, but exogamy is replaced by the\r\nmost incestuous of endogamies. Thus Strabo relates that, following\r\na very ancient custom, the Magi might have commerce with their own\r\nmothers.[1067] According to Ctesias, marriage between mother and son\r\nwas a common thing in Persia, and this not from sudden passion, but\r\nby deliberate proposal, “by false judgment.”[1068] Lucian, on his\r\npart, says expressly that marriage between brother and sister among\r\nthe Persians was perfectly legal. Indeed, in various passages of the\r\n_Avesta_, consanguineous unions are recommended and praised.[1069]\r\nIn the eyes of the Mazdeans, whose sacred code expressly forbade all\r\nalliance with infidels, endogamy, even when excessive, was evidently\r\nmoral; and they encouraged it to such a degree as to approve of the\r\nkind of incest which is regarded as the most criminal by nearly all\r\nother peoples. Neither is there any trace of the matriarchate in\r\nancient Persia, unless we choose to see a vestige of it in the legend\r\naccording to which, in the time of the mythic monarchies, the eldest\r\ndaughter of the king had the right to choose her husband herself.\r\nFor this purpose all the young nobles of the country were assembled\r\ntogether at a festival, and the princess signified her preference by\r\nthrowing an orange to the man who pleased her best.[1070] I mention\r\nthis tradition that I may omit nothing, but it evidently constitutes a\r\nmost insignificant proof. Modern Persia, being Mahometan, has regulated\r\nmarriage and the family in accordance with the Koran. We find, however,\r\nby the side of the perpetual marriage which only death or divorce can\r\ndissolve, a form of conjugal union less solemn and more ephemeral, and\r\nwhich is not generally recognised by law in countries even slightly\r\ncivilised. I speak of marriages for a term, or rather the hiring of a\r\nwife for a time and for a fixed price. Unions of this kind are legal in\r\nPersia. They are agreed on before the judge, and at the expiration of\r\nthe contract, or rather the lease, the interested parties may renew the\r\nengagement if they think well. In a contrary case, the woman can only\r\ncontract another union of the same kind after a delay of forty days. If\r\nbefore the expiration of the conjugal lease the man desires to break\r\nit, he can do so, but only on condition of placing in the hands of the\r\nwoman the total sum stipulated in the contract.[1071] The offspring\r\nof these temporary unions, or of any sort of union, are all equal\r\nbefore the Persian law, which merely subjects them to the right of\r\nprimogeniture. At the death of the father, the eldest son, though born\r\nof a slave mother, takes two-thirds of the succession. The remaining\r\nthird of the property is divided amongst the other children, but in\r\nsuch a way that the share of the boys is half as large again as that\r\nof the girls.[1072] This right of primogeniture and these advantages\r\ngranted to boys exclude all idea of maternal filiation in the customs\r\nof modern Persia, and we have seen that there was no trace of it in\r\nancient Persia; this race therefore seems not to have passed through\r\nthe phase of the maternal family, nor perhaps through that of the clan.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _The Family in India._\r\n\r\nIn India, on the contrary, certain customs and traditions appear to be\r\ntrue survivals, relating to an ancient organisation of exogamic clans\r\nwith maternal filiation. But of these old customs the sacred books\r\nretain no trace. In Vedic India the family is already patriarchal,\r\nsince the husband is called _pati_, which signifies master; but this\r\nVedic family is of a most restricted kind. It is composed, essentially\r\nand simply, at first of the husband and wife, who become the father\r\nand the mother; then of the son and of the daughter, who are mutually\r\nbrother and sister. The grandparents belong to the anterior family; the\r\nuncles and aunts are part of the collateral families.[1073] The Code\r\nof Manu is already less exclusive, for it admits, as we shall see, a\r\nfictitious filiation; but it is still patriarchal, and, according to\r\nManu, the daughters occupy an entirely subordinate position. It is\r\na son and a chain of male descendants that it is important to have;\r\nreligion even makes it an obligation; for the ancestors of any man\r\nwho has not a son to perform in their honour the sacrifice to the\r\nmanes, or the _Srâddha_, are excluded from the celestial abode. It\r\nis necessary to have a son to “pay the debt of the ancestors.” “By a\r\nson, a man gains heaven; by the son of a son, he obtains immortality;\r\nby the son of this grandson, he rises to dwell in the sun.”[1074] The\r\nCode of Manu already proclaims the right of primogeniture. It is by\r\nmeans of the eldest son that a man pays the debt of the ancestors; it\r\nis therefore he who ought to have everything; his obedient brothers\r\nwill live under his guardianship, as they have lived under that of the\r\nfather,[1075] on condition, however, that if the sons are of different\r\nmothers, the mothers of the younger ones are not of superior rank to\r\nthat of the mother of the eldest son.[1076] The son of a brahmanee,\r\nfor example, would not yield precedence to the son of a _kchâtriya_:\r\ncaste is always of the first consideration. But the quality of son\r\nmay be acquired otherwise than by community of blood. Thus a husband\r\nmay, as we have seen, have his sterile wife fertilised by his younger\r\nbrother. The child thus conceived is reputed to be son of the husband;\r\nnevertheless, in the succession, he is given the share of an uncle\r\nonly, and not the double share to which he would have had a right if he\r\nhad been the real son[1077] by flesh and blood. If a man has the great\r\nmisfortune to have only daughters, he can obviate this by charging\r\nhis daughter to bear him a son. For this purpose, it suffices for him\r\nto say mentally to himself: “Let the male child that she gives birth\r\nto become mine, and fulfil in my honour the funeral ceremony.”[1078]\r\nThe son thus engendered by mental incest and by suggestion, as we\r\nshould say to-day, is perfectly authentic. He is not a grandson, but\r\na real and true son, and he inherits all the fortune of his maternal\r\ngrandfather, with the light charge on it of offering two funeral\r\ncakes--one to his own father, his father according to the flesh,\r\nthe other to his maternal grandfather, or father according to the\r\nspirit.[1079] The law of Manu does not totally disinherit daughters,\r\nbut it cuts down their share considerably. Under pain of degradation,\r\nbrothers must give their sisters, but only to their german sisters,\r\nthe fourth of their share, to enable them to marry.[1080] Another\r\nverse[1081] accords to the daughter the inheritance of the maternal\r\nproperty, composed of what has been given to the mother at her\r\nmarriage. But to be capable of inheriting, this daughter must still\r\nbe celibate. In the contrary case, she merely receives a present. In\r\nshort, the whole Brahmanic code is based, in what concerns the family,\r\non masculine filiation and the patriarchate. Nevertheless, customs that\r\nare kept up by the side of it, and doubtless in spite of it, prove that\r\nin certain parts of India there must formerly have existed exogamic\r\nclans and a system of maternal filiation.\r\n\r\nBut it is important to remark that these survivals are, or were, met\r\nwith especially in Tamil districts, in Malabar or Ceylon, which were\r\nin great measure colonised by Tamils. In certain small kingdoms of\r\nMalabar, as late as the seventeenth century, the right of succession\r\nwas transmitted through the mother; a princess could also, if she\r\npleased, marry an inferior.[1082] Custom still designated as brothers\r\nto each other the children either of two brothers or two sisters,\r\nbut the children of the brother and of the sister were only german\r\ncousins.[1083] Certain families never made any partition, thus\r\npreserving the custom of the ancient familial clan.[1084] Wherever\r\nfeminine filiation prevailed, it was the sister’s son who succeeded\r\nthe defunct Rajah.[1085] So also in the eastern part of Ceylon, the\r\nproperty was transmitted to the sister’s son, to the exclusion of the\r\nsons.[1086] To conclude, I will mention the custom, also very widely\r\nspread in India, of not marrying a woman of the same name.\r\n\r\nWe must beware of exaggerating the value of these partial facts; they\r\npermit us, however, to infer that in certain parts of India, and\r\nespecially among the Tamils, the family has at first been maternal, and\r\nhas slowly evolved from the primitive clan.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _The Greco-Roman Family._\r\n\r\nThe chief object of this book being to study the evolution of the\r\nfamily and of marriage, I need not describe in detail the Greco-Roman\r\nfamily, which has, besides, served as a theme for so many writers. It\r\ncertainly appears, contrary to the opinion of the Romans themselves,\r\nto have emerged tardily enough from the primitive clan or _gens_. This\r\nRoman _gens_ was composed, really or fictitiously, of consanguine\r\nindividuals, living under an elected chief, and having the same name.\r\nThe union of several _gentes_ formed the _curia_ or the _phratry_.\r\nGrouped together, the phratries or curiæ constituted _tribus_.\r\nAnd lastly, the assembly of the tribus formed the nation: Rome or\r\nAthens.[1087] It is therefore the clan, or _gens_, and not the family,\r\nwhich has been at Rome, and at Athens the _cellule_, according to the\r\nfashionable expression, of ancient society.\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of history, these clans were already agnatic; they had\r\nadopted paternal filiation, and each of them claimed a common masculine\r\nancestor; but the right of the _gens_ to the heritage, and in certain\r\ncases the possession of an _ager publicus_, still proved the antique\r\ncommunity of property; and a number of indications and traditions\r\nbore witness in favour of the existence of a prehistoric phase of the\r\nmaternal family, preceding agnation. Bachofen goes much further, and\r\nnot without a show of reason. He insists, for example, that kinship in\r\nthe Latin clan may at first have been confused. He alleges, on this\r\npoint, that in the time of Numa the word _parricide_ signified, not\r\nthe murder of a father, but that of a free man of some sort; that in\r\nthe family tribunal the cognates of the wife figured, and that the\r\ncognates wore mourning for each other; that the cognates of the wife,\r\nand those of the husband of a wife, had over her the _jus osculi_, or\r\nthe right of embracing her, etc.; lastly, that the Etruscan Servius,\r\nthe founder of plebeian liberty, was conceived, says the legend, during\r\na great annual festival, when the people reverted to primitive sexual\r\ndisorder.[1088]\r\n\r\nThe Greek γένος resembled the Roman _gens_. Its members had a common\r\nsepulture, common property, the mutual obligation of the _vendetta_,\r\nand an archon.[1089]\r\n\r\nIn the protohistoric clans of Greece maternal filiation was first\r\nof all established. The Cretans said motherland (μητρίς), and not\r\nfatherland (πατρίς). In primitive Athens the women had the right of\r\nvoting, and their children bore their name--privileges which were taken\r\nfrom them, says the legend, to appease the wrath of Neptune, after an\r\ninundation.[1090] Tradition also relates that at Athens, until the time\r\nof Cecrops, children bore the name of their mother.[1091]\r\n\r\nAmong the Lycians, says Herodotus, the matriarchate endured a long\r\ntime, and the children followed the status of their mother. Uterine\r\nbrothers were carefully distinguished from german brothers for a long\r\nperiod in Greece; the former are called ὁμογάστριοι in Homer, and the\r\nlatter ὄπατροι; and uterine fraternity was regarded as much more close.\r\nLycaon, pleading with Achilles, says, in order to appease him, that he\r\nis not the uterine brother of Hector.[1092] At Athens and Sparta a man\r\ncould marry his father’s sister, but not his mother’s sister.[1093] In\r\nEtruria the funeral inscriptions in the Latin language make much more\r\nfrequent mention of the maternal than the paternal descent. Sometimes\r\nthey mention only the name of a child and that of his mother (Lars\r\nCaius, son of Caulia, etc.); sometimes they indicate the father’s name\r\nby simple initials, whilst that of the mother is written in full.[1094]\r\n\r\nAs in so many other countries, the paternal family succeeded the\r\nmaternal family in the ancient world, but not without difficulty. To\r\nbegin with, the fact of marriage did not suffice alone to establish\r\npaternal filiation; the declaration of the father was necessary,\r\nas well in Greece as in Rome. In his _Oresteia_, Æschylus puts in\r\nopposition before Minerva the old maternal right and the new paternal\r\nright. The chorus of the Eumenides, representing the people, defends\r\nthe ancient customs; Apollo pleads for the innovators, and ends by\r\ndeclaring, in a fit of patriarchal delirium, that the child is not\r\nof the blood of the mother. “It is not the mother who begets _what\r\nis called her child_; she is only the nurse of the germ poured into\r\nher womb; he who begets is the father. The woman receives the germ\r\nmerely as guardian, and when it pleases the gods, she preserves\r\nit.” The Orestes of Euripides takes up the same theory when he says\r\nto Tyndarus--“My father has begotten me, and thy daughter has given\r\nbirth to me, as the earth receives the seed that another confides to\r\nit; without a father, there could be no child.” These patriarchal\r\ntheories naturally consecrated the slavery of woman. The laws of Solon\r\nstill recognised the right of women to inherit, in default of paternal\r\nrelations of the male sex, to the fourth degree, but in the time of\r\nIsæus the law refused to the mother any place among the heirs of her\r\nson.[1095]\r\n\r\nIn fact, throughout the historic period the Greco-Roman world is\r\npatriarchal. In Greece and at Rome woman is despised, subjected, and\r\npossessed like a thing; while the power of the father of the family is\r\nenormous. It is especially so at Rome, where, nevertheless, the family\r\nis not yet strictly consanguineous, for it includes the wife, children,\r\nand slaves, and where agnation has for its basis the _patria potestas_.\r\n“All those are agnates who are under the same paternal power, or who\r\nhave been, or who could be, if their ancestor had lived long enough to\r\nexercise his empire.... Wherever the paternal power begins, there also\r\nbegins kinship. Adoptive children are relations.... A son emancipated\r\nby his father loses his rights of agnation.”[1096] At the commencement\r\nof Roman history, we see, therefore, clans, or _gentes_, composed of\r\nfamilies, of whom some are patrician--that is, able to indicate their\r\nagnatic lineage--and the others plebeian. The “justæ nuptiæ” are for\r\nthe former; the latter unite without ceremony, _more ferarum_. The\r\nfamily is possessed by the _pater familias_; he is the king and priest\r\nof it, and becomes one of its gods when his shade goes to dwell among\r\nthe manes. In this last case, the family simply changes masters;\r\n“the nearest agnate _takes the family_,” says the law of the Twelve\r\nTables. Something very similar existed in Greece, for we have seen\r\nthat at Athens the right of marrying their sisters, left to brothers\r\nwho were heirs, was not even exhausted by a first marriage.[1097]\r\nThe institution of individual, or rather familial property, that of\r\nmasculine filiation, and of patriarchal monogamy, dismembered the\r\n_gens_, which at length became merely nominal. The law of the Twelve\r\nTables, however, still decides that the succession shall be vacant if,\r\nat the death of the father, the nearest agnate refuses to “take the\r\nfamily,” and in default of an agnate the _gentiles_ shall take the\r\nsuccession. The nominal _gens_ persisted for a long time in the ancient\r\nworld; thus every Roman patrician had three names--that of his _gens_,\r\nthat of his family, and his personal name.[1098] At Athens, in the time\r\nof Solon, the _gens_ still inherited when a man died without children.\r\n\r\nThe long duration of Greco-Roman society enables us to follow the\r\nwhole evolution of the family in it. It would be going beyond the\r\nfacts to affirm the existence of a still confused consanguinity in\r\nthe ancient _gens_; but it seems very probable that this _gens_ first\r\nadopted the maternal and then the paternal family, which last became\r\nsomewhat modified, in the sense of the extension of feminine rights.\r\nThis extension was slow, and it was not till the time of Justinian that\r\nequal shares were given to sons and daughters in succession, or even\r\nthat widows were entrusted with the care of their children.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. _The Family in Barbarous Europe._\r\n\r\nOrganisation into clans more or less consanguineous, then into\r\nphratries and tribes, seems natural in many primitive societies; and\r\noutside the Greco-Roman world the barbarous populations of Europe had\r\nall adopted it. In these clans, has kinship begun by being confused?\r\nHas exogamy prevailed? On these particular points precise information\r\nis wanting; doubtless evolution cannot everywhere have been uniform.\r\nOne thing is, however, certain, namely, that the Celtic populations\r\nhave preserved the institution of the clan much longer than any\r\nothers. In Wales and Ireland the clan was still the social unit; it\r\nwas responsible for the crimes of its members, paid the fines and\r\nreceived the compensations. In Ireland, and surely elsewhere, there\r\nwas an _ager publicus_ allotted amongst the members of the clans.\r\nIndividualism prevailed in the end, as it did everywhere. A certain\r\nportion of the common soil, reserved in usufruct for the chiefs, was at\r\nlast seized by them as individual property; but all the members of a\r\nclan were reputed as of kin, and at a man’s death his land was allotted\r\nby the chief amongst the other families of the clan or _sept_.[1099]\r\nThese clans, however, were anything but exogamous, if we may believe\r\nStrabo, who affirms that the ancient Irish, like the Mazdeans,\r\nmarried, without distinction, their mothers and sisters.[1100] Irish\r\nmarriage had in no way the strictness of the Roman marriage; temporary\r\nunions were freely allowed, and customs having the force of law\r\nsafeguarded the rights of the wife.[1101] Other European barbarians,\r\non the contrary, were exogamous, and prohibited under pain of severe\r\npunishment, as whipping or drowning, marriage between members of the\r\nsame clan.[1102] The _mir_ of the southern Slavs may be considered as\r\na survival of these ancient barbarous clans, sometimes endogamous,\r\nsometimes exogamous.\r\n\r\nIn becoming subdivided into families, have these little primitive\r\nclans adopted maternal filiation? This is possible; but when they came\r\nin contact with the Roman world the greater number had already the\r\npaternal family. Let us notice, however, that the Irish law, far from\r\nsubjecting the mother, accorded her a position equal to that of the\r\nfather.[1103] Let us also recall the following passage of Tacitus[1104]\r\n_à propos_ of the Germans: “The son of a sister is as dear to his uncle\r\nas to his father; some even think that the first of these ties is the\r\nmost sacred and close; and in taking hostages they prefer nephews, as\r\ninspiring a stronger attachment, and interesting the family on more\r\nsides.” We may add to this that in Germany the mother could be the\r\nguardian of her children;[1105] that the Salic law, _non emendata_,\r\nadmitted to the succession, in default of children, the father and\r\nmother, the brothers and sisters, and then the sister of the mother\r\nin preference to that of the father. Let us remember, also, that in\r\nSlav communities women have a right to vote, and may be elected to the\r\ngovernment of the community;[1106] but this is still a long way off the\r\nmatriarchate, or even uterine filiation. The Saxon law (tit. vii.), the\r\nBurgundian law (tit. xlv.), and the German law (tit. lvii. and xcii.)\r\nonly admit women to the succession in default of male ascendants; the\r\nlaw of the Angles prefers paternal agnates, even to the fifth degree,\r\nbefore women.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are only two precise testimonies that may be quoted\r\nin favour of the ancient existence of maternal filiation among the\r\nbarbarians of Europe--that of Strabo, relating to the Iberians; and the\r\ncase of the Picts, amongst whom the lists of kings show that fathers\r\nand sons had different names, and that brothers succeeded instead of\r\nsons.[1107] From this absence, or rather rarity, of proofs in favour of\r\nthe ancient existence of the maternal family among the barbarians of\r\nEurope, must we conclude that it has never existed? Not at all; we can\r\nonly say that this ancient filiation is possible, and even probable,\r\nbut as yet insufficiently established.\r\n\r\nWhat cannot be disputed is, that always and everywhere peoples who are\r\nin process of civilisation have adopted the paternal family, according\r\neven excessive powers to the father of the family. What is probable\r\nis, that in the majority of cases paternal filiation has succeeded to\r\nmaternal filiation and to more or less confused familial forms. Is\r\nthis paternal or even patriarchal family the final term of familial\r\nevolution? Has evolution, never as yet arrested in its course, said its\r\nlast word in regard to marriage and the family?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1038] Lubbock, _Orig. Civil._, p. 177.\r\n\r\n[1039] L.

Man is neither a demi-god nor an angel; he\r\nis a primate more intelligent than the others, and his relationship\r\nwith the neighbouring species of the animal kingdom is more strongly\r\nshown in his psychic than in his anatomical traits.\r\n\r\nMore than once, I fear, the accumulation of detailed facts which forms\r\nthe groundwork of this book may have fatigued my readers; but this is\r\nthe only condition on which it is possible to give a solid basis to\r\nsociology. It is, in fact, nothing less than a matter of creating a\r\nnew science. We are scarcely beginning to be really acquainted with\r\nmankind, to take a complete survey of it in time and space. Now this\r\nwould be quite impossible without the help of comparative ethnography.\r\nWe must regard the existing inferior races as survivals, as prehistoric\r\nor protohistoric types that have persisted through long ages, and are\r\nstill on different steps of the ladder of progress; it is this view\r\nalone which we shall find suggestive and enlightening; and it is in\r\nstrict correlation with the method of evolution, to which, indeed, it\r\nowes its value.\r\n\r\nThe innumerable dissertations on the history of marriage and of the\r\nfamily which appeared previous to the rise of scientific method, have\r\nnecessarily been devoid of accuracy and especially of breadth of\r\nthought. A thick veil concealed the real origin of these institutions;\r\nreligious legends, that had become venerable on account of their\r\nantiquity, paralysed scientific investigation. To submit our social\r\ninstitutions to the great law of evolution, by means of disagreeable\r\nresearches, was not to be tolerated by public opinion. In fact, if\r\nmarriage and the family have been constantly modified in the past,\r\nwe cannot maintain that these institutions will remain for ever\r\ncrystallised in their present state. Until this revolutionary idea had\r\ntaken root and become sufficiently acclimatised in public opinion, all\r\nso-called social studies were scarcely more than empty lucubrations.\r\nFrom time to time, no doubt, a few bold innovators, braving scoffs or\r\neven martyrdom, have dared to construct theories of new societies;\r\nbut, being insufficiently informed, they could only create Utopias\r\ncontemned by the mass of the public. Scientific sociology builds\r\nits edifice stone by stone; its duty is to bind the present to the\r\nmost distant past; its honour will lie in furnishing a solid basis\r\nof operation to the innovators of the future; but this new branch\r\nof human knowledge can only grow by submitting to the method of the\r\nnatural sciences. Before everything else, it is important to classify\r\nthe facts that have been observed. This course is imperative. It is\r\ndry, and lends itself with difficulty to oratorical effusions, but no\r\nother path can lead to the truth. My constant anxiety has been to be\r\nfaithful to it, and as an anthropologist I have especially borrowed\r\nmy materials from ethnography. Step by step, and following as much as\r\npossible the hierarchic order of human races and of civilisations, I\r\nhave described the modes of marriage and of the family adopted by the\r\nnumerous varieties of the human type; I have endeavoured to note the\r\nphases of their evolution, and to show how superior forms have evolved\r\nfrom inferior ones. Now that I am at the end of my inquiry, it will be\r\nwell to sum up clearly its result.\r\n\r\nThe prime cause of marriage and the family is purely biological; it is\r\nthe powerful instinct of reproduction, the condition of the duration\r\nof species, and the origin of which is necessarily contemporaneous\r\nwith that of primal organisms, of protoplasmic monads, multiplying\r\nthemselves by unconscious scissiparity. By a slow specialisation\r\nof organs and functions, in obedience to the laws of evolutionary\r\nselection, various animal types have been created; and when they have\r\nbeen provided with separate sexes and conscious nervous centres,\r\nprocreation has become a tyrannic need, driving males and females to\r\nunite in order to fulfil the important function of reproduction.\r\n\r\nIn this respect man is strictly assimilable to the other animals, and\r\nwith him as with them all the intoxication of love has for its initial\r\nprinciple the elective affinity of two generating cellules of different\r\nsex. So far, this is mere biology, but it results, among superior\r\nanimals, in sociological phenomena, in pairings which endure after the\r\nsatisfaction of procreative needs, and produce in outline some forms\r\nof human marriage, or rather, of sexual union in humanity--namely,\r\npromiscuity, polygamy, and even monogamy. Our most primitive ancestors,\r\nour precursors, half men and half apes, have certainly had extremely\r\ngross customs, which are still in great measure preserved among the\r\nleast developed races.\r\n\r\nThe study, however, of contemporary savage societies proves to us that\r\nabsolutely unbridled promiscuity, without rule or restraint, is very\r\nrare even in inferior humanity. In exceptional cases, individuals\r\nof both sexes may have abandoned themselves, of common accord, to\r\npromiscuity, as did the Polynesian _areoïs_; but these instances\r\nrelate to acts of debauchery, and not to a regulated social condition\r\ncompatible with the maintenance of an ethnic group. The conjugal form\r\nnearest to promiscuity is the collective marriage of clan to clan--as,\r\nfor example, that of the Kamilaroi, amongst whom all the men of one\r\nclan are reputed brothers to each other, and at the same time husbands\r\nof all the women of a neighbouring clan, reputed also sisters to each\r\nother. Other varieties of sexual association are more common, and\r\nmay be arranged under the general heads of promiscuity, polygamy,\r\npolyandry, and monogamy. We hear also of temporary unions, marriages\r\nfor a term, and partial marriages concluded at a debated price for\r\ncertain days of the week only, etc. Every possible experiment,\r\ncompatible with the duration of savage or barbarous societies, has\r\nbeen tried, or is still practised, amongst various races, without the\r\nleast thought of the moral ideas generally prevailing in Europe, and\r\nwhich our metaphysicians proclaim as innate and necessary. Having\r\nelsewhere demonstrated at length the relativity of morality, I will\r\nnot go over the ground again, but will quote on this point some lines\r\nof Montaigne:--“The laws of conscience, which we pretend to be derived\r\nfrom nature, proceed from custom; every one having an inward veneration\r\nfor the opinions and manners approved and received amongst his own\r\npeople, cannot without very great reluctancy depart from them, nor\r\napply himself to them without applause.... The common fancies that we\r\nfind in repute everywhere about us, and infused into our mind with the\r\nseed of our fathers, appear to be most universal and genuine. From\r\nwhence it comes to pass, that whatever is off the hinges of custom\r\nis believed to be also off the hinges of reason.”[1108] The partial\r\nmarriages of the Hassinyeh Arabs are surely off the hinges of our\r\ncustom; and it is the same with polyandry, which borders on these\r\npartial marriages, but is much more widely spread. Like everything else, polyandric\r\nmarriage has evolved, from its most complete form, that of the Naïrs,\r\nto the polyandry in use in Thibet, which already inclines towards\r\nmonandry and the paternal family. Primitive polyandry has easily arisen\r\nfrom the marriage by classes practised by many savage clans; but most\r\noften it is polygamy which has sprung from it. And the latter must\r\nfrequently have been established from the first in primitive hordes,\r\nsimply by the right of the strongest.\r\n\r\nMan may be monogamous in the very lowest degree of savagery and\r\nstupidity; certain animals are so; but in humanity it is more often the\r\ninstinct of polygamy which predominates; and therefore, when in the\r\ncourse of the progressive evolution of societies monogamy at length\r\nbecame moral and legal, men have been careful to soften its rigour\r\nby maintaining together with it concubinage and prostitution, and by\r\ngenerally leaving to the husband the right of repudiation, which has\r\nnearly always been refused to the wife. This injustice appeared quite\r\nnatural, for as the wife had usually been captured or bought, she was\r\nconsidered as the property of the man, and held in strict subjection.\r\nAt length, in its last form, monogamic marriage, which had at first\r\nbeen the association of a master and a slave, tended more and more to\r\nbecome the union of two persons, living on a footing of equality.\r\n\r\nThe family has undergone a similar evolution. Apart from a few\r\nexceptional cases of precocious monogamy (Veddahs, Boshimans, etc.),\r\nethnography shows us the greater number of savage races living in\r\nlittle consanguine groups, in which the kinship is still confused\r\nand the solidarity strong. The degrees of consanguinity are not well\r\ndefined; real kinship is easily confounded with fictitious kinship, and\r\nclasses of relations are created, ranged under the same title, although\r\nvery differently united by ties of blood. The woman nearly always bears\r\nchildren for her group, or clan, and this clan is very often exogamic;\r\nthis exogamy is practised from clan to clan, and only within the tribe.\r\nThere is no absolute rule, however, and it is not unusual to see\r\nendogamy elbow exogamy.\r\n\r\nIn the large and confused family of the clan, all the members of which\r\nwere bound together by a strict solidarity of interests and a real or\r\nfictitious kinship, the restricted family became gradually established\r\nby a reaction of individual interests. On account of the more or less\r\ncomplete confusion of sexual unions, the first to become detached\r\nfrom the consanguine clan was the maternal family, based on uterine\r\nfiliation, the only filiation capable of sure proof; but the great\r\nassociation of all the members of the clan still existed. By the simple\r\nfact of birth in this little ethnic group, the individual had rights to\r\nthe territory of the clan and his share in the common resources; his\r\nclan were bound to give him aid, assistance, and, at need, vengeance\r\nalso. In proportion as the family assumed more distinct proportions\r\nin the clan, it tended to become separate from it, and then, nearly\r\nalways, it was based not on maternal but on paternal filiation. This\r\ndid not come to pass in a day; it took a long time to arrive at the\r\npoint of attributing to such or such a man the ownership of one or\r\nmore women and their progeny. The ridiculous ceremonial of the couvade\r\nwas probably invented during this period of transition, when it was no\r\neasy matter for a man to obtain the recognition of his paternal title\r\nand rights by the other men of the clan. For a long time the maternal\r\nfamily resisted the enthronisation of the paternal family, and here\r\nand there it succeeded in maintaining its existence, and in serving as\r\na basis for the transmission of inheritance. For, whether paternal or\r\nmaternal, the institution of the family, when well consolidated, had\r\nfor its result the parcelling out of the possessions of the ancient\r\nclans, and the creation of familial or individual property on the ruins\r\nof the ancient common property. Finally, nothing more remained of the\r\nclan, or _gens_, but the sign or _totem_, the name, and a kinship, also\r\nnominal, between the various families that had come from it.\r\n\r\nThe system and the vocabulary of kinship were then renewed; to the\r\nclassificatory mode, grouping the relations by classes, without much\r\ncare as to consanguinity, has succeeded the descriptive mode, which\r\ncarefully specifies the degree of consanguinity of each person, and\r\ndistinguishes a direct line from collateral lines, and in which each\r\nindividual is the centre of a group of relations.\r\n\r\nIn a remarkable book, which has not yet had all the success it\r\ndeserves, Lewis Morgan believes he has recognised five stages in the\r\nevolution of the family: 1st, the family is consanguineous--that is\r\nto say, founded on the marriage of brothers and sisters of a group;\r\n2nd, several brothers are the common husbands of their wives, who\r\nare not sisters; 3rd, a man and woman unite, but without exclusive\r\ncohabitation, and with faculty of divorce for one or the other; 4th,\r\nthen comes the pastoral family of the Hebrews, the marriage of one man\r\nwith several women; but this patriarchal form has not been universal;\r\n5th, at last appeared the family of civilised societies, the most\r\nmodern, characterised by the exclusive cohabitation of one man and one\r\nwoman. Not taking this classification too literally, and reserving a\r\nplace for varieties and exceptions, we have here five stages which mark\r\ntolerably well the evolution of the family in humanity.\r\n\r\nThe moral direction of this slow transformation is evident; it proceeds\r\nfrom a communism more or less extensive to individualism; from the\r\nclan, where all is solidarity, to the family and the individual, having\r\ntheir own interests, which are as distinct as possible from those\r\nof other families and other individuals. Each one has endeavoured\r\nto get for himself as large a share as possible of that which was\r\nformerly held in common; each man has aimed at obtaining a more and\r\nmore exclusive right over property, wife, and children. From these\r\nappetites, more economic than ethereal, have at length proceeded\r\nthe patriarchal family, monogamy, and familial property, and later,\r\nindividual property;[1109] the _régime_ of the family and that of\r\nproperty have evolved in company. But this transformation has been\r\neffected by extremely slow degrees; for a long time the new _régime_\r\nbore the mark of the old one in certain rights reserved to the clan, in\r\ncertain prohibitions, in certain obligations, which still imposed some\r\nsolidarity on individuals--as, for example, the legal injunction to\r\nhelp a man in peril, to hasten to the assistance of a village plundered\r\nby robbers, the general duty of hospitality, etc.--all of them precepts\r\nformulated by the codes of Egypt and India, and still to be found in\r\nKabylie, and which have disappeared from our frankly individualistic,\r\nor rather egoistic, modern legislations.\r\n\r\nIt is indisputable that this evolution has everywhere coincided with\r\na general progress in civilisation, and the advance has been sensibly\r\nthe same among the peoples of all races, on the sole condition that\r\nthey should have emerged from savagery. Everywhere, in the end, the\r\npaternal family and monogamic marriage have become a sort of ideal to\r\nwhich men have striven to conform their customs and institutions. It\r\nhas very naturally been concluded that these last forms of the family\r\nand of conjugal union have an intrinsic sociologic superiority over the\r\nothers, that in all times and places they strengthen the ethnic group,\r\nand create for it better conditions in its struggle for existence. But\r\nthis reasoning has nothing strict in it; civilisation is the result\r\nof very complex influences, and if a certain social practice has been\r\nadopted by inferior races, it does not logically follow that it is,\r\nfor that reason only, bad in itself. What seems indisputable is, that\r\nman tends willingly towards individualism, and yields himself up to\r\nit with joy as soon as that becomes possible to him, thanks to the\r\ngeneral progress of civilisation. At the origin of civilisations, in\r\na tribe of savages, surrounded with perils, and painfully struggling\r\nfor existence, a more or less strict solidarity is imperative; the\r\nco-associates must necessarily form as it were a large family, in which\r\na more or less communal _régime_ is essential. The children, the weak\r\nones, and the women have more chance of surviving if in some measure\r\nthey belong to the entire clan; perpetual war soon cuts down a great\r\nnumber of men; it is therefore necessary that their widows and children\r\nshould find support and protection without difficulty, and the _régime_\r\nof the clan, with its wide and confused kinship, lends itself better to\r\nthis helpful fraternity than a strict distinction of _tuum_ and _meum_\r\napplied to property and persons. The same may be said of patriarchal\r\npolygamy, which often flourished on the ruins of the clan. For this\r\n_régime_ to become general, it is necessary that, in the ethnic group,\r\nthe proportion of the sexes should be to the advantage of the feminine\r\nsex; in this case it is imperative, and evidently becomes favourable to\r\nthe maintenance of the social body; in fact it guarantees the women\r\nagainst desertion, augments the number of births, and assures to the\r\nchildren the care of one or more adoptive mothers, if the real mother\r\nhappens to die. The opinion of Herbert Spencer, who quite _à priori_\r\nattributes to monogamy a diminution in the mortality of children,[1110]\r\nis a most hazardous one. By the last census taken in Algeria we learn,\r\nnot without surprise, that the increase in the indigenous Mussulman and\r\npolygamic population was much superior to that of the most prolific\r\nof the European monogamous states. Polygamy may therefore have its\r\nutilitarian value, and this is the case as soon as it adapts itself to\r\nthe general conditions of social life.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Present._\r\n\r\nIt is many centuries since Europe adopted monogamic marriage as the\r\nlegal type of the sexual union. That there exists by the side of\r\nregular marriage a considerable margin, in which are still found\r\nnearly all the other forms of sexual association, we do not deny; but\r\nin France, for example, two-thirds of the population live so entirely\r\nunder the _régime_ of legal monogamy, that it would be evidently\r\nsuperfluous to describe it here; it is, in substance, the Roman\r\nmarriage, the bonds of which Christianity has striven to lighten. In\r\nthe general opinion, marriage such as our laws and customs require it\r\nto be, is the most perfect type possible of conjugal union; and this\r\ncurrent appreciation has not been a little strengthened by a learned\r\ntreatise, frequently quoted, and of which I cannot dispense with saying\r\na few words.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, a justly celebrated demographer, whom I have the honour to\r\ncall friend, Dr. Adolphe Bertillon, published a monograph on marriage,\r\nwhich made a great sensation.[1111]\r\n\r\nThis work, bristling with figures, scrupulously collected and strictly\r\naccurate, proves or seems to prove that the celibate third of the\r\nFrench population is, by reason of its celibacy, struck with decay,\r\nand plays the part of an inferior race by the side of the married\r\ntwo-thirds. In comparative tables, which are extremely clear, A.\r\nBertillon follows step by step the different fates of the married and\r\nunmarried, and he shows us that at every age the celibate population\r\nis struck by a mortality nearly twice as great as the other; that its\r\nbirths merely make up 45 per cent. of its annual losses; that it counts\r\nevery year twice as many cases of madness, twice as many suicides,\r\ntwice as many attempts on property, and twice as many murders and acts\r\nof personal violence. Consequently, the State has to maintain for this\r\ncelibate population twice as many prisons, twice as many asylums and\r\nhospitals, twice as many undertakers,[1112] etc. These revelations,\r\nabsolutely true as raw results, caused a great commotion in the little\r\npublic specially occupied with demography and sociology. Their alarm\r\nwas soon calmed.\r\n\r\nFrom his interesting work A. Bertillon had drawn conclusions which were\r\nvery doubtful, taking surely the effect for the cause, by attributing\r\nthe inferiority of the celibate population solely to its celibacy. If\r\nthis be so, we have only to marry these weak ones in order to raise\r\nthem; but the superiority of the married population, which on the whole\r\nis indisputable, does not necessarily imply the superiority of the\r\nmarriage state.\r\n\r\nIt is in consequence of economic hindrances, and of physical or\r\npsychical inferiority, that, in the greater number of cases, people\r\nresign themselves to celibacy. Those who wish to marry cannot always\r\ndo so, and A. Bertillon knew better than any one that the number of\r\nmarriages, the age at marriage, the number of children by marriage,\r\netc., depend in the mass not on individual caprice, but on causes\r\naltogether general. Setting aside money considerations--which are so\r\npowerful, and to which I shall presently return--and confining our\r\ncalculation to persons of normal endowment, it is probable that there\r\nis more energy, more moral and intellectual vitality, in those who\r\nbravely face the risk of marriage than in the timid celibates; but it\r\nis certain that the celibate population, taken as a whole, includes the\r\nmajority of the human waste of a country. At the time when A. Bertillon\r\nwrote his learned treatise, in 1859, statistics prove the existence in\r\nFrance of 370,018 infirm persons,[1113] of whom the greater number were\r\nevidently condemned to celibacy by the very fact of their infirmity.\r\nOn the other hand, it is probable that among the beggars, properly so\r\ncalled, there is a large proportion of celibates, without counting the\r\ninfirm; now in 1847 there were 337,838 beggars in France.[1114]\r\n\r\nTo these lists of unwilling celibates must be added, especially, the\r\nvirile population in the army, the mortality in which was, as we well\r\nknow, double that of the civil population. Now, on the 1st January\r\n1852, the French army counted 354,960 men.[1115] To these matrimonial\r\nnon-values, contributing a larger tithe to sickness and death, must\r\nbe further joined the celibates from religious vows. The census shows\r\n52,885 of the latter. Without any ill-feeling towards the Catholic\r\nclergy, we may be allowed to hold the opinion that the very fact of\r\na man’s vowing himself to celibacy--that is to say, of setting at\r\nnought the desires of nature and the needs of the society of which\r\nhe forms a part--merely for metaphysical motives, often implies a\r\ncertain degree of mental inferiority. The special statistics of the\r\nlittle ecclesiastical world are not published in France; but M. Duruy\r\nhaving once had the happy thought of ascertaining from the judicial\r\npigeon-holes the number of crimes and misdemeanours committed by the\r\nmembers of religious orders engaged in teaching, compared with those\r\nof lay schoolmasters, during a period of thirty months, the result of\r\nthe inquiry showed that, proportionally to the number of schools, the\r\nformer were guilty of four times as many misdemeanours and twelve times\r\nas many crimes as the latter.[1116] Short as the period of observation\r\nwas, this enormous difference gives matter for reflection, although it\r\nmay not have the value of a law.\r\n\r\nBut the principal causes which influence matrimony are the greater or\r\nless facility of existence, and the extreme importance attached to\r\nmoney. As a general rule, life and death tend to balance each other,\r\nand the populations whose mortality is great have, as compensation, a\r\nrich birthrate. We invariably see the number of marriages and births\r\nincreasing after a series of prosperous years, and _vice versâ_.\r\nGeneral causes have naturally a greater influence on the population\r\nliving from hand to mouth. The well-to-do classes escape this, and we\r\neven find that the chances of marriage for the rich increase during\r\nyears of high prices.[1117]\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely attribute to anything else but an excessive care for\r\nmoney and a forethought pushed to timidity some very disquieting traits\r\nin our marriage and birth rates in France. I will merely recall, by the\r\nway, the continually decreasing excess of our births, which, if not\r\nstopped by radical social reforms, can only end in our final decay.\r\n\r\nThe fear of marriage and the family is the particular feature of\r\nFrench matrimoniality. The desirable age for marriage, says A.\r\nBertillon,[1118] is from twenty-two to twenty-five for men, and from\r\nnineteen to twenty for women. In England more than half the marriages\r\nfor men (504 in 1000) and nearly two-thirds of those of women are\r\ncontracted before the age of twenty-five. Now, this is only the case\r\nin France for 0.29, and in Belgium for 0.20 of the marriages. A\r\ndemographical phenomenon of the same kind is observed in Italy, where\r\nonly 232 men out of 1000 marry before the age of twenty-five.[1119]\r\nAt Paris, where the struggle for existence is more severe, and where\r\nthe care for money is more predominant, late marriages abound, and\r\nit is only above the age of forty for men and thirty-five for women\r\nthat the marriage rate equals, and even exceeds, that of the whole\r\nof France;[1120] it is self-evident that the result of this must be\r\na decrease in the total of births by marriage. Whether these facts\r\nproceed from the growing difficulties of existence, or from a fear,\r\nalways augmenting also, of trouble and care, or from these two causes\r\ncombined and mutually strengthening each other, the consequence is\r\nthe same: marriages are becoming more and more simple commercial\r\ntransactions, from whence arises the worst and most shameful of\r\nselections--selection by money. As a moral demographer, A. Bertillon\r\nthunders against what he calls “the system of dower” more peculiar\r\nto the Latin races, since we get it from Rome, where recourse was\r\ndoubtless had to it in order to emancipate patrician women from strict\r\nconjugal servitude. But the remedy has become an evil, and it is\r\nsurely to the love of the dowry rather than to “the beautiful eyes of\r\nthe casket” that must be attributed a whole list of true marriages\r\nby purchase, much more common in our own country than elsewhere.\r\nSometimes it is old men who conjugally purchase young girls, and\r\nsometimes old women who buy young husbands. I will especially notice\r\nthis last category of marriages by purchase. As regards them, France\r\nis unworthily distinguished beyond other nations. In our tables of\r\nstatistics, for example, the proportionate number of marriages between\r\nbachelors from eighteen to forty years and women of fifty and upwards,\r\nis ten times greater than in England.[1121]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marriages with Women of Fifty Years and upwards.

The comparison is not\r\nflattering for us. It is important to note, also, that these figures\r\nonly refer to first marriages. Tables of the same kind, showing the\r\nmarriages between young girls and old men, or between aged widows\r\nand young men, would add to our confusion, and bring to our thoughts\r\nthe picturesque exclamation which Shakespeare puts into the mouth of\r\nKing Lear--“Fie!

Give me an ounce of civet, good\r\napothecary, to sweeten my imagination.”[1122]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marriages with Men of Sixty Years and upwards._\r\n\r\n        IN FRANCE.         |          IN ENGLAND.\r\n  Age of Girls.

For one who\r\nis not a prophet by supernatural inspiration, it is hazardous to make\r\npredictions. The future, nevertheless, is born from the womb of the\r\npast, and, after having patiently scrutinised the evolution of bygone\r\nages, we may legitimately risk a few inductions with regard to the ages\r\nto come. Doubtless the primitive forms of marriage and the family will\r\npersist, if not for ever, as Herbert Spencer believes, at least for a\r\nvery long time among certain inferior races, protected and at the same\r\ntime oppressed by climates which the civilised man cannot brave with\r\nimpunity. These backward prehistoric races will continue to subsist in\r\nunwholesome regions, as witnesses of a distant past, recalling to more\r\ndeveloped races their humble origin. But with these last the form of\r\nmarriage and of the family, which has incessantly been evolving, cannot\r\nevidently remain immutable in the future. The little human world knows\r\nno more repose than the cosmic environment from whence it has sprung,\r\nand which encloses it. Among peoples, as among individuals, vital\r\nconcurrence and selection do their work. Now, when it is a matter of\r\ninstitutions so essentially vital as marriage and the family, the least\r\namelioration is of the highest importance; it has an influence on the\r\nnumber and quality of fresh generations, and on the flesh and spirit of\r\npeoples. All things being equal, the preponderance, whether pacific or\r\nnot, will always fall to the nations which produce the greatest number\r\nof the most robust, most intelligent, and best citizens. These better\r\nendowed nations will often absorb or replace the others, and always\r\nin the long run will be docilely imitated by them. Ethnography and\r\nhistory show us the true sense of evolution in the past. Societies have\r\nconstantly advanced from confusion to distinction. Monogamic marriage\r\nhas succeeded to various more confused modes of sexual association.\r\nSo also the family is the ultimate residuum of vast communities of\r\nill-defined relationships. In its turn, the family itself has become\r\nrestricted. At first it was still a sort of little clan; and then\r\nit was reduced to be essentially no more than the very modest group\r\nformed by the father, the mother, and the children. At the same time\r\nthe familial patrimony crumbled, just as that of the clan had been\r\npreviously parcelled out; it became individual. What is reserved for\r\nus in the future? Will the family be reconstituted by a slow movement\r\nof retrogression, as Herbert Spencer believes?[1123] Nothing is less\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nInstitutions have this in common with rivers, that they do not easily\r\nflow back towards their source. If they sometimes seem to retrograde,\r\nit is generally a mere appearance, resulting from a sort of sociologic\r\nrhythm. In truth, the end and the beginning may assume a superficial\r\nanalogy, masking a profound difference. Thus the unconscious atheism of\r\nthe Kaffirs has nothing in common with that of Lucretius, and nothing\r\ncan be less analogous than the anarchic equality of the Fuegians\r\nand American individualism. If, as is probable, the individualist\r\nevolution, already so long begun, continues in the future, the\r\ncivilised family--that is to say, the last collective unit of\r\nsocieties--must again be disintegrated, and finally subsist no longer\r\nexcept in genealogy scientifically registered with ever-increasing\r\ncare; for it is, and always will be, important to be able to prejudge\r\nhow “the voice of the ancestors” may speak in the individual. But even\r\nfrom the crumbling of the family will result the reconstitution of a\r\nlarger collective unit, having common interests and resuscitating under\r\nanother form that solidarity without which no society can endure.\r\n\r\nBut this new collectivity will in no way be copied from the primitive\r\nclan. Whether it be called State, district, canton, or commune, its\r\ngovernment will be at once despotic and liberal; it will repress\r\neverything that would be calculated to injure the community, but\r\nin everything else it will endeavour to leave the most complete\r\nindependence to individuals. Our actual family circle is most often\r\nvery imperfect; so few families can give, or know how to give, a\r\nhealthy, physical, moral, and intellectual education to the child,\r\nthat in this domain large encroachments of the State, whether small or\r\ngreat, are probable, even desirable. There is, in fact, a great social\r\ninterest before which the pretended rights of families must be effaced.\r\nIn order to prosper and live, it is necessary that the ethnic or social\r\nunit should incessantly produce a sufficient number of individuals\r\nwell endowed in body, heart, and mind. Before this primordial need all\r\nprejudices must yield, all egoistic interests must bend.\r\n\r\nBut the family and marriage are closely connected; the former cannot be\r\nmodified so long as the latter remains unchanged. If the legal ties of\r\nthe family are stretched, while social ties are drawn closer, marriage\r\nwill have the same fortune. For a long time, more or less silently, a\r\nslow work of disintegration has begun, and we see it accentuated every\r\nday. Leaving aside morals, which are difficult to appreciate, let us\r\nsimply take the numerical results which statistics furnish us with in\r\nregard to divorce and illegitimate births.\r\n\r\nIn the five countries compared as follows, the increase of divorces has\r\nbeen continuous and progressive during thirty years, and in France the\r\nnumber has doubled.\r\n\r\nThe number of illegitimate births followed simultaneously an analogous\r\nprogression. In France, during the period 1800-1805, it was 4.75 per\r\n100; now, wrote M. Block in 1869, it has gradually risen to 7.25 per\r\n100.[1124] At the same time, and as a consequence of this demographic\r\nmovement, the proportion of free unions has considerably increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF DIVORCES.[1125]\r\n\r\n_The frequency of divorces in 1851-55 being 100, what has it become\r\nduring the following years?_\r\n\r\n            France.

Bertillon calculated this proportion for Paris at about a tenth.\r\nBut these results are simply the logical continuation of the evolution\r\nof marriage. It is in the sense of an ever-increasing individual\r\nliberty, especially for woman, that this evolution is being effected.\r\nBetween men and women the conjugal relations have at first been\r\nnearly everywhere from masters to slaves; then marital despotism\r\nbecame slowly attenuated, and at Rome, for example, where the gradual\r\nmetamorphosis may be traced during a long historic period, the power\r\nof the _paterfamilias_, which at first had no limit, at length became\r\ncurbed; the personality of the woman was more and more accentuated, and\r\nthe rigid marriage of the first centuries of the Republic was replaced\r\nunder the Empire by a sort of free union. Doubtless this movement\r\nnecessarily retrograded under the influence of Christianity; but, as\r\nalways happens in the logic of things, it has, nevertheless, resumed\r\nits course; it will become more and more evident, and will surely pass\r\nthe point at which it stopped in imperial Rome.\r\n\r\nMonogamic marriage will continue to subsist; it is the last-comer,\r\nand much the most worthy, and besides, the balance of the sexes makes\r\nit almost a necessity; but it will have more and more equality in it,\r\nand less and less of legal restraint. On this point I am glad to find\r\nmyself in accord with the most celebrated of modern sociologists,\r\nHerbert Spencer, who is not very bold, however, on these delicate\r\npoints. “In primitive phases,” he says, “while permanent monogamy was\r\ndeveloping, union in the name of the law--that is, originally, the\r\nact of purchase--was accounted the essential part of the marriage,\r\nand union in the name of affection was not essential. In the present\r\nday union in the name of the law is considered the most important,\r\nand union by affection as less important. A time will come when union\r\nby affection will be considered the most important, and union in the\r\nname of the law the least important, and men will hold in reprobation\r\nthose conjugal unions in which union by affection is dissolved.”[1126]\r\nMontaigne once wrote: “We have thought to make our marriage tie\r\nstronger by taking away all means of dissolving it; but the more we\r\nhave tightened the constraint, so much the more have we relaxed and\r\ndetracted from the bond of will and affection.”[1127]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore probable that a future more or less distant will\r\ninaugurate the _régime_ of monogamic unions, freely contracted, and, at\r\nneed, freely dissolved by simple mutual consent, as is already the case\r\nwith divorces in various European countries--at Geneva, in Belgium,\r\nin Roumania, etc., and with separation in Italy. In these divorces of\r\nthe future, the community will only intervene in order to safeguard\r\nthat which is of vital interest to it--the fate and the education of\r\nthe children. But this evolution in the manner of understanding and\r\npractising marriage will operate slowly, for it supposes an entire\r\ncorresponding revolution in public opinion; moreover, it requires as a\r\ncorollary, profound modifications in the social organism. The _régime_\r\nof liberty in marriage and the disintegration of our actual familial\r\ntype are only possible on condition that the State or the district, in\r\na great number of cases, is ready to assume the _rôle_ of guardian and\r\neducator of children; but, before it can take on itself these important\r\nfunctions, it must have considerable resources at its disposal which\r\nto-day are wanting. In our present _régime_, the family, however\r\ndefective it may be, still constitutes the safest, and almost the only\r\nshelter for the child, and we cannot think of destroying this shelter\r\nbefore we have constructed a larger and better one.\r\n\r\nTransformations so radical as these cannot evidently be wrought\r\ninstantaneously, by a mere change of view, after the fashion of\r\npolitical revolutions. Nothing is more chimerical than to fear or\r\nto hope for the sudden destruction of our actual forms of marriage,\r\nof the family, and of property; but there is no doubt that all this\r\nis tottering. The alarm and the lamentations of so many moralists,\r\nboth lay and religious, are not therefore without some foundation.\r\nSocieties have always evolved, but the rapidity of this evolution is\r\naccelerating; it is, in some sort, proportionate to the square of the\r\ntime elapsed. I fear that in the eyes of our descendants we shall\r\nappear slaves of routine, as our ancestors are in ours.\r\n\r\nFor those who have not firmly rallied to the side of the great law\r\nof progress, the future is full of terror. It has always been thus;\r\nthe apostles of progress have always had to overcome the resistance\r\nof the sectaries of the past. From time immemorial, certain Dyak\r\ntribes were accustomed to fell trees by chopping at the trunk with a\r\nhatchet, perpendicularly to the fibres. One day some revolutionaries\r\nproposed making V-shaped cuttings, in the European method. The Dyak\r\nconservative party, inspired by the regard due to custom, were wroth at\r\nthis, and punished the innovators by a fine.[1128] Nevertheless, I do\r\nnot doubt that the new method has triumphed in practice; it was found\r\nadvantageous. But this incident is, in miniature, the history of all\r\ntransformations, small or great.\r\n\r\nIt is very certain that in societies where marriage by groups half\r\npolyandric and half polygamic had been instituted for centuries,\r\nthe bold agitators who attempted to substitute individual union\r\nwere considered at first as dangerous revolutionaries, and those\r\nwho dismembered into families the communal clan only succeeded at\r\nthe cost of great difficulty and peril. Thus in the _Oresteia_ of\r\nÆschylus, of which I have spoken in the last chapter, the chorus of\r\nthe Eumenides gives voice to the protestations of public opinion\r\nagainst the establishment of the paternal family in Greece. The\r\nprospects which alarm the conservative spirits of to-day are, in truth,\r\nbut the last consequence of that ancient evolution. Statisticians\r\nwho are not evolutionists prove, without understanding it, that the\r\nindissolubility of marriage becomes more and more intolerable for\r\nindividuals.[1129]There is, as it were, a tide of discord continually\r\nrising which renders conjugal stability more and more precarious. This\r\ngrievous state of things distresses, on the other hand, the moralists,\r\nfor neither do they see the reason of it. The surprise of the former is\r\nnot more justified than the lamentation of the latter. It is nothing\r\nmore than the future, which, with its habitual effrontery, persists in\r\nrising out of the past. The faint-hearted cry to us that everything is\r\ncoming to an end. It is not so; on the contrary, everything is about to\r\nbe renewed. From the most distant stone age, the history of humanity\r\nhas only been a long series of regenerations. Far from mourning when\r\nthe world seems to be entering a period of fresh life, let us rather\r\nrejoice and say again with Lucretius--\r\n\r\n  “Cedit enim rerum novitate extrusa vetustas\r\n  Semper et ex aliis aliud reparare necesse est.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1108] Montaigne, _Essays_; _Custom_.\r\n\r\n[1109] A.
