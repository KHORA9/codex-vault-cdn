These delays ensued because\r\nthe editor wished to take into account the most recent determinations\r\nand decrees of the guilds and various legislative factors connected\r\nwith the industry; but he was at length forced to the conclusion that\r\nnotwithstanding the excellent organisation and lofty standing of the\r\nbranch under consideration, it was useless to wait for anything final\r\nand absolute in such a field. Suggestions of possible improvements and\r\nindications of blemishes are therefore earnestly invited, in order\r\nthat they may be duly allowed for in the event of a new edition. — The\r\nplan followed by Zipperer has been adopted in the main; a tribute due\r\nto its previous success. Yet on the other hand, the arrangement of the\r\nbook has undergone some alteration, and is, at least in the editor’s\r\nopinion, a perceptible improvement. — All scientific, industrial and\r\ntechnical progress has been treated as fully as possible, the economic\r\npart in particular having been diligently recast.\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, have been impossible for the editor to write all\r\nthese chapters without external aid, his knowledge of the respective\r\nbranches being by no means exhaustive enough. He may therefore\r\nbe allowed to express here his obligation and thanks to all his\r\nfellow-workers; and in particular, to the ~Association of German\r\nChocolate Manufacturers~, Dresden; its managing director, Herr\r\nGreiert; the director of the ~Cocoa Purchase Co.~, Hamburg,\r\nHerr Rittscher, who contributed the whole of the chapter headed;\r\n~Commercial Varieties of Cacao Beans~; further to Prof. Dr.\r\nHärtel, Chief Inspector of the Royal Research Institute, Leipsic;\r\nDr. R. Böhme, Managing Director of Messrs. Stollwerck Bros. Chemical\r\nLaboratory, Cologne; and to Superintendent Engineer Schneider, of\r\nthe firm J. M. Lehman, Dresden, among many others. Mention must also\r\nbe made of the manufacturers who so kindly placed material at the\r\neditor’s disposal. Let us hope that the work will meet with a success\r\ncorresponding to the pains taken by the editor and publishers, and\r\nprove a really serviceable ~Handbook to the Chocolate Industry~.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Schaeffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracts from the prefaces to the first and second editions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this work is to furnish a source of information and\r\nadvice for those who are interested in the branch of industry to which\r\nit relates.\r\n\r\nThe author of this treatise has therefore endeavoured not only to\r\ndescribe the manufacturing processes; but he has also devoted special\r\nattention to the raw materials employed, and endeavoured to make them\r\ngenerally familiar by reference to the literature on the subject, as\r\nwell as by providing a precise account of the chemical constituents of\r\nthese substances and discussing the consequently necessary procedure to\r\nbe observed in the course of manufacture. The art of chocolate making\r\nis no longer what it was a few decades ago; it has for the most part\r\npassed from small operators into the hands of large manufacturers. A\r\nshort historical resumé will serve as a sketch of this development and\r\na cursory description of some forms of apparatus which have now merely\r\nhistorical interest will serve to show how improvement in the industry\r\nhas been effected.\r\n\r\nChocolate is a favourite and most important article of food, and in\r\nthat sense it is subject to legal regulations for which allowances must\r\nbe made, as well as for the most suitable analytical methods by means\r\nof which a manufacturer can ascertain the presence of unlawful mixtures\r\nin competing products, so that knowing the regulations in force, he may\r\navoid any infringement of the same.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithin the ten years that have elapsed since the first edition of this\r\nwork appeared, the manufacture of chocolate has undergone considerable\r\nexpansion. Not only has the ~modus operandi~ been simplified\r\nand improved by the introduction of a number of new mechanical\r\nappliances, but the technique of the subject has been so extended,\r\nboth from chemical and mechanical points of view, as partly to furnish\r\na new standard in estimating and determining cacao constituents and\r\npreparations. The author has endeavoured to take due account of all\r\nthese advances, and made a point of collecting the material scattered\r\nthrough the various professional journals, sifting or supplementing\r\nwhere necessary, in order that all engaged in the industry, ~the\r\nmanufacturer as well as the food analyst and the engineer~, may be\r\nin a position to derive a vivid impression of existing conditions in\r\nthe chocolate manufacture, from the present volume.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the importance which several branches of the\r\nindustry have recently acquired, such as the preparation of cocoa\r\npowder, soluble cocoa, cacao butter, pralinés and chocolate creams,\r\nspace has been given to descriptions of the respective details. On the\r\nother hand no attempt has been made to introduce calculations as to the\r\ncost of manufacture, since statements to that effect would possibly be\r\nrather detrimental than otherwise.\r\n\r\nCosts of production as regards cacao preparations is subject to great\r\nvariation, according to the scale on which they are carried out, so\r\nthat estimates made on the basis of large operations might eventually\r\nlead to the conclusion that a small factory might be profitable, and\r\nwith no better result than that of creating undue competition in prices\r\nand occasioning eventual failure. Moreover, the fluctuations in the\r\nmarket price of cacao and sugar are so frequent, and there is such\r\npossibility of new sources of expense, that calculations can only apply\r\nto the time when they are made; they soon become out of date, and then\r\nafford no trustworthy indication of probable profit and loss.\r\n\r\nThe section treating of legislative regulations relating to the trade\r\nin cacao preparations has undergone complete revision to adapt it to\r\nexisting conditions.\r\n\r\nTo render the book more useful, an appendix has been added in which the\r\nproduction and composition of a few cacao preparations are treated of,\r\nproviding valuable data for reference.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Paul Zipperer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  First Part: =The Cacao Tree=                                      Page\r\n\r\n  A. =Tree and Beans=                                                  1\r\n\r\n  a) Description of the Cacao Tree and its Fruit                       1\r\n\r\n  b) Geographical Distribution and History of the Cacao Tree           4\r\n\r\n  c) Cultivation of the Cacao Tree; Diseases and Parasites             7\r\n\r\n  d) Gathering and Fermentation                                        9\r\n\r\n  e) Description of the Beans                                         12\r\n\r\n  f) The Commercial Sorts of the Cacao Bean                           16\r\n\r\n  1.

Tree and Beans.\r\n\r\n\r\na) Description of the Cacao Tree and its Fruit.\r\n\r\nThe cacao tree with its clusters of red blossom and golden yellow\r\nfruits is conspicuous even in tropical vegetation. Of considerable\r\ndiameter at the base, it often attains a height of eight metres. Its\r\nwood is porous and light; the bark is cinnamon coloured, the simply\r\nalternating leaves are from 30 to 40 cm. in length and from 10 to 12\r\ncm. broad, growing on stalks about 3 cm. long. The upper surface of\r\nthese leaves is bright green, and the other one of a duller colour, and\r\nslightly hairy.\r\n\r\nThe flowers, which are often covered with hairs, occur either singly or\r\nunited in bunches not only on the thicker branches but also all along\r\nthe trunk from the root upwards. (Fig. 1 A.)\r\n\r\nThe formation of the fruit takes place only from the flowers of the\r\nstem or thicker branches, and for a thousand flowers there is only one\r\nripe fruit.\r\n\r\nThe flowers (fig. 1 B & C) are very small and of a reddish white\r\ncolour. Calyx and corolla are five partite, the ten filaments are\r\nunited at their base (fig. 1 G) and only half of them are developed to\r\nfruitful organs, such as bear pollen (fig. 1 J) in their four separate\r\nanther compartments (fig. 1 H).\r\n\r\nThe pistil is formed of five united carpels and bears in each of its\r\nfive compartments eight ovules. (Fig. 1 E & F).\r\n\r\nThe fruit is at first green, and afterwards turns yellow, but with\r\nstreaks and tints of red occurring; many varieties also are entirely\r\ncrimson. Resembling our cucumber in size, shape and appearance (see\r\nfig. 2 A & B), it has a length of about 25 cm. and a diameter of 10\r\ncm., and the thickness of its shell is from 15 to 20 mm. This shell is\r\nof rather softer consistency than that of the gourd, and has five deep\r\nlongitudinal channels, with five others of less depth between them.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 1. (After Berg & Schmidt, Atlas.)\r\n\r\n _A_ Twig in bloom (1/2). _B_ Flower (3/1). _C_ Flower in vertical\r\n section (3/1). _D_ Leaf of flower (6/1) _E_ Bean-pod in vertical\r\n section (6/1) _F_ Bean-pod in cross section (9/1). _H_ Anther. _J_\r\n Pollen.]\r\n\r\nThe shell encloses a soft, sweetish pulp, within which from twenty-five\r\nto forty almond shaped seeds are ranged in five longitudinal rows,\r\nclose to each other. The white colour of these seeds is frequently\r\ntinged with yellow, crimson, or violet (Sec. Fig. 2 C. D. & G).\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 2. (After Berg & Schmidt).\r\n\r\n _A_ Fruit with half of shell removed (1/2). _B_ Fruit in cross section\r\n (1/2). _C_ Side view of seed (1/3). _D_ Front view of seed (1/1). _E_\r\n Seedling (1/1). _F_ Kotyledon or Seed-leaf (1/1). _G_ Seed in cross\r\n section (1/1).]\r\n\r\nThe fruits ripen throughout the whole year, though but slowly during\r\nthe dry season; and the time needed for its full development is about\r\nfour months. It may be gathered at all times of the year, although\r\nthere are regular gathering seasons, determined and modified by the\r\nrespective climatic conditions. So, for example, we find that in Brazil\r\nthe principal gathering takes place in February and July, whilst in\r\nMexico it is in March and April. In the primeval Amazonian forests the\r\nfruit of the cacao tree is gathered and brought to market at all times\r\nof the year, wherever Indian tribes obtain.\r\n\r\n\r\nb) Geographical Distribution and History of the Cacao Tree.\r\n\r\nThe cacao tree flourishes in a warm, moist climate. It is therefore\r\nindigenous to tropical America, from 23° north to 15° or 20° south\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nConsequently the area in which it grows comprises the Central American\r\nrepublic of Mexico down to the Isthmus of Panama; Guatemala, the\r\nGreater and Lesser Antilles, Martinique, Trinidad, St. Lucia, Granada,\r\nCuba, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, and San Domingo; in\r\nSouth America, the republics of Venezuela, Columbia, Guiana, Ecuador,\r\nPeru and the northern parts of Brazil, especially the districts lying\r\nalong the middle Amazon.\r\n\r\nIn all other countries where the cacao tree now flourishes, it has been\r\nnaturalised, either by colonists, or with government aid, as in Asia,\r\nwhere the Philippine Islands, Java, Celebes, Amboyna and Ceylon in\r\nparticular are deserving of mention; and in Cameroon (Bibundi, Victoria\r\nand Buea), Bourbon, San Thomé and the Canary Islands in Africa, where\r\nthe tree is sometimes found growing at an elevation of about 980 ft.\r\nabove sea level. Ceylon offers an instructive illustration of the zeal\r\nwith which the cultivation is carried on in some districts. According\r\nto information furnished by Mr. Ph. Freudenburg, late German Consul\r\nat Colombo, cacao had been planted in a few instances during the time\r\nCeylon was in possession of the Dutch, but only since 1819 has seed\r\nbeen distributed out of the botanical gardens at Kalatura, and it was\r\nstill later before planters could obtain it from those established\r\nat Peradenija. Systematic cultivation for commercial purposes was\r\ncommenced in 1872 or 1873. The principal seats of cacao plantations are\r\nDumbara, Kurunegalla, Kegalla and Polgahawella, together with North,\r\nEast and West Matala, Urah and Panwila.[1] According to statistical\r\nrecords, the relation between the growth and export of cacao is shown\r\nby the following table, which also shows the development of its\r\ncultivation:\r\n\r\n  Year       Area under         Exports\r\n         cultivation (acres)     (cwts)\r\n\r\n  1878         300                  10\r\n  1879         500                  42\r\n  1880        3000                 121\r\n  1881        5460                 283\r\n  1885       12800                7247\r\n  1892       14500               17327\r\n  1895       18278               27519\r\n  1898       22500               32688\r\n  1908       39788               62186\r\n\r\nLike all other articles of human food, cacao has a history of some\r\ninterest, the most essential points of which are here summarised from\r\nthe excellent work of A. Mitscherlich.[2]\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the cacao tree was first brought to Europe in 1519 by\r\nFernando Cortez and his troops. He found in Mexico a very extensive\r\ncultivation of cacao, which had been carried on for several centuries.\r\nIn the first letter addressed by Cortez to Charles the Fifth, he\r\ndescribed cacao beans as being used in place of money. Cortez applied\r\nto the cacao tree the name of “Cacap”, a word derived from the old\r\nMexican designation “Cacava-quahitl”. The Mexicans called the fruit\r\n“Cacavacentli”, the beans “Cacahoatl” and the beverage prepared from\r\nthem “Chocolatl”[3], said to be derived from the root “Cacava” and\r\n“Atl”, water. This term was adopted by the Spaniards, and it gave rise\r\nin the course of time to the word “Chocolate”, which is now universal.\r\n\r\nThe botanical definition of the typical form of the cacao tree, which\r\nbelongs to the family BUTTNERIACEAE, is referable to Linnaeus, who gave\r\nit the name “Theobroma Cacao” (food of the gods, from “Theos”, God,\r\nand “Broma”, food). Probably chocolate was a favourite beverage with\r\nLinnaeus, who may have been acquainted with the work of the Paris\r\nphysician Buchat, published in 1684, in which chocolate is alluded\r\nto as an invention more worthy of being called food of the gods than\r\nnectar or ambrosia. Clusius first described the cacao tree in his\r\n“Plantae exoticae”. The taste for chocolate soon spread throughout\r\nSpain after the return of Cortez’ expedition from the New World, not,\r\nhowever, without encountering some opposition, especially on the part\r\nof the clergy, who raised the question whether it were lawful to\r\npartake of chocolate on fast days, as it was known to possess nutritive\r\nproperties. However, it found an advocate in Cardinal Brancatio, who\r\ndescribed it as an article belonging, like wine, to the necessaries of\r\nlife, and he therefore held that its use in moderation could not be\r\nprohibited. In 1624 Franciscus Rauch published a work at Vienna, in\r\nwhich he condemned the use of chocolate and suggested that the monks\r\nshould be prevented from partaking of it, as a means of preventing\r\nexcesses. About the commencement of the 17th century, the use of\r\nchocolate spread from Spain to Italy, where it was brought to the\r\nnotice of the public by the Florentine Antonio Carletti (1606), who had\r\nlived for some time in the Antilles. The method of converting cacao\r\nbeans into chocolate was also made known in Europe by Carletti, while\r\nthe Spaniards had kept it a secret. Under Theresa of Austria, wife of\r\nLouis XIV, the habit of taking chocolate appears to have become very\r\ncommon in France after the partial introduction of cacao by importation\r\nfrom Spain. The first cacao imported from the French colony of\r\nMartinique arrived in Brest in 1679 in “Le Triomphant”, the flagship of\r\nadmiral d’Estrées. Opinion in France as to chocolate was then divided:\r\nMadame Sévigné, once an admirer of chocolate, afterwards wrote to her\r\ndaughter: “il vous flatte pour un temps et puis il vous allume tout\r\nd’un coup fièvre continue qui vous conduit à la mort”, a theory which\r\nnowadays must necessarily be regarded as ridiculous.\r\n\r\nChocolate was in general use in England about the middle of the 17th\r\ncentury. Chocolate houses, similar to the coffee houses of Germany,\r\nwere opened in London. Bontekoë, physician to the Elector Wilhelm of\r\nBrandenburg, published in 1679 a work entitled “Tractat van Kruyd,\r\nThee, Coffe, Chocolate,” in which he spoke very strongly in favour\r\nof chocolate and contributed very sensibly to the increase of its\r\nconsumption in Germany. The first chocolate factory in Germany is said\r\nto have been erected by Prince Wilhelm von der Lippe about the year\r\n1756 at Steinhude. This prince brought over Portuguese specially versed\r\nin the art of chocolate making.\r\n\r\n\r\nc) Cultivation of the Cacao Tree; Diseases and Parasites.\r\n\r\nThe first information regarding the cultivation of the cacao tree\r\nin Mexico is that obtained on the invasion of the country by the\r\nSpaniards. Prior to that time there is a total absence of anything\r\ndefinite. The tree flourishes best in situations where the mean\r\ntemperature is between 24° and 28° C. The farther the place of\r\ncultivation from the equator the poorer is the product. The other\r\nmost essential conditions are long continued moisture of the soil\r\nand a soft, loose texture with abundance of humus, and above all,\r\nshelter from the direct rays of the sun. For these reasons, planters\r\nselect for their cacao areas ground the virgin soil of which has not\r\nbeen exhausted by the cultivation of other plants. The plants are\r\neither raised in a nursery until they reach the most suitable age\r\nfor transplanting, or the seeds are sown on the ground selected for\r\nthe plantation. The transport of live seed for new plantations is\r\nattended with some difficulty, since the seeds very quickly lose their\r\nvitality. C. Chalot[4] recommends that this vitality be preserved by\r\ngathering the fruit before it is perfectly ripe, immersing it in melted\r\nparaffin oil, and then wrapping it in paper; on which the fruit may be\r\ntransported without losing any of its nutritive qualities.\r\n\r\nIn the sheltered valleys of tropical countries, where the soft soil,\r\nrich in humus, is kept constantly moist by large rivers, the cacao tree\r\nblossoms throughout the whole year. When growing wild it is generally\r\nisolated under the shadow of larger trees; when cultivated, the young\r\nplant is placed under the shelter of banana trees, and at a later\r\nperiod of its growth shelter is provided by the coral (called Erythrina\r\ncorallodendron or Erythrina indica), further known as “Coffie-mama”\r\namong the Surinam Dutch and madre del cacao among the Spaniards. Yet\r\nthis tree, like the Maniok, is said not to enjoy so long a life as the\r\ncacao plant, which sometimes reaches an age of forty years. On this\r\naccount the Castilloa or also Caesalpina dashyracis have recently been\r\nrecommended as a more lasting protection. The fact that it does not\r\nlose its leaves during the dry season (e. g. on Java, during the East\r\nMonsoon) is an additional advantage.\r\n\r\nA cacao plantation requires a considerable area, in the proportion of\r\n50 hectares for 20,000 trees. The quantity of fruit to be obtained\r\nfrom that number of trees, as an annual crop, would be worth from\r\n£ 1,200-1,300. In planting the seeds, they are set in rows that are\r\nfrom 8 to 10 m. apart, four or five seeds being planted within from\r\n1 to 2 m, the shading trees being planted between the rows. Of each\r\nfive seeds planted the greater number often fail to germinate, either\r\nin consequence of unfavourable weather or as the result of attacks\r\nby insects etc.; but if more than one plant grows, the weaker ones\r\nare pulled up. Until the plants are two or three years old, they are\r\nprotected by a shed open at one side, and they are transplanted after\r\nthey have attained a height of 3 ft. The chief enemies of tropical\r\ncultivation—weeds, aerial roots, insects, bacterial infection—have to\r\nbe provided against continually, so as to prevent damage; accordingly\r\nif the ground be not moist enough, it should be systematically watered,\r\nand so drained if marshy, for the tree requires most careful nursing\r\nif it is to develop into a prolific fruit-bearing specimen. The seed\r\ngerminates about fourteen days after being planted; but flowers are not\r\nproduced till after 3 or 5 years. After the tree has once born fruit,\r\nwhich may occur at the end of the fourth year it often continues to\r\ndo so for fifty years. The tree is most prolific when from twelve to\r\nthirty years old.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of all cultivated plants and domestic animals, the\r\nexistence of which does not depend on the principal of natural\r\nselection, and among which life is not a continuous development of\r\nendurance in the face of adverse elements, the cacao tree has its\r\npeculiar diseases. Indeed, it would seem as though it were beset by all\r\nvermin extant. The reader may obtain some idea of the extent of the\r\ndamage done to cacao plantations by such noxious agents, if he turns up\r\nthe clear and exhaustive account published by the Imperial Biological\r\nInstitute for Agriculture and Forestry (Germany).[5] Unfortunately we\r\nhave not space here to mention more than a few of the most frequently\r\noccurring and important diseases, such as the GUM DISEASE, which is\r\nespecially destructive, gum formations in the wood tissue and bark of\r\nthe tree eventually killing it. Next to be dreaded are the various\r\nfungus growths, cancers and cancer-like incrustations (“Krulloten”) and\r\nbroom formations. It often happens that specii of beetle attack the\r\ntree, causing decay and rot to set in; such e. g. are the wood-borer,\r\nbark bug, and woodbeetle. Other parasites, again, do not destroy the\r\nwhole tree, but are equally detrimental, as they also preclude all\r\nprospects of a harvest. Fruit rot and its like, fruit cancer, and\r\ncacao moths, are notorious in this connection. There are also several\r\nlarger creatures which betray a preference for the nutritious fruit of\r\nthe cacao tree, various species of rat, and the squirrel, which unite\r\nto make the planter’s life a burden.\r\n\r\n\r\nd) Gathering and Fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of the fruit is effected by means of long rods, at\r\nthe end of which is a semi-circular knife for cutting through the\r\nstalk. The fruits are then split in two, the beans separated from the\r\nsurrounding pulp and spread out on screens to dry, or exposed to the\r\nsun on bamboo floors. Beans so prepared are described as unfermented.\r\n\r\nIn most lands where cacao is cultivated, another process is adopted,\r\ncalculated to heighten the flavour of the fruit and develop its\r\nnutritious constituents. The newly gathered beans are first partially\r\nfreed from the fruity substances always adhering, then piled up into\r\nheaps and covered with banana skins or cocoa-nut matting, in order\r\nthat they may be shut off as far as possible from all atmospheric\r\ninfluence, and so left for some time, while the chemical processes of\r\nwarming and fermentation are gradually consummating. This procedure\r\nis alternated with repeated exposures to the sun, according to the\r\nmaturity and species of the cacao bean, and the prevailing weather\r\nconditions; though details as to the length of time and number of\r\nrepetitions necessary to the production of a marketable article\r\nstill await determination.[6] It may be taken as a general rule that\r\nfermentation should proceed till the bean, or rather the cotyledon,\r\nhas acquired the light brown colour characteristic of chocolate. This\r\nprinciple is nevertheless often violated, especially as loss of weight\r\nin the bean is often intimately connected with complete fermentation.\r\nUnsufficiently fermented varieties, but which were fully ripe when\r\ngathered, develop a violet colour during this process; it is possible\r\nfor them to pass through what is known as “After fermentation” before\r\nreaching the factory. This is not so in the case of beans developing\r\nfrom unripe fruit, for obviously the valuable constituents of the\r\ncotyledon are here not prominent, and scarcely calculated to ferment\r\nproperly. Such can be recognised by their betraying a bluish grey\r\ncolour in the drying processes, and the soft and smooth structure which\r\nthey then acquire. A normal progress of fermentation is indicated where\r\nthe interior of the mass of beans registers, on the first morning after\r\ngathering, a temperature not exceeding 30-33° C, 35-38° on the second\r\nday, and on the third morning a temperature not exceeding 43° C. If the\r\nouter shells are marked, the heating has been too severe. In countries\r\nwhere the harvest season suffers from the periodical rains, drying over\r\nwooden fires[7] is often resorted to. The value of many specimens is\r\nhereby greatly diminished when the roasting is carelessly managed, for\r\nthe smoke must on no account be allowed to come into contact with the\r\nbean. Yet “Smoky” lots among the St. Thomas, Accra, and Kameroon sorts\r\nwere formerly much more frequent in commerce than now, for the planter\r\nhas learned to avoid this evil. After they have been fermented, the\r\nbeans are washed, or trodden with the naked foot, in some countries,\r\nand so cleansed from the pulp remains still adhering. They are then\r\nallowed to dry in the open air, and packed into sacks; contact with\r\nmetal or stone is strictly to be avoided, which as good conductors of\r\nheat and rapid cooling agents are most disadvantageous. Instead of\r\npiling the beans up in loose heaps, they may be fermented in “Tanks”\r\nmade of wood, and where possible, provided with partitions. According\r\nto Kindt, cedar wood has been proved best for this purpose, because\r\nof its enormous resisting capacity. It used to be thought that in\r\nfermentation ensued a germination of the seed,[8] as in the preparation\r\nof malt; but this idea has been proved erroneous. The contrary is\r\nrather the case, for the process almost kills the seed; and when the\r\nsensitiveness of the latter is taken into consideration, and also\r\nthe fact that it only develops under the most favourable conditions,\r\nit must be allowed that the statement contains an obvious truth. Yet\r\nchemical change does take place in the fermentation of the seed; but\r\nas to its precise nature, owing to the lack of scientific research on\r\nthe scene of operations, we are still unable to dogmatise. It would\r\ntherefore be useless to discuss the manifold theories and speculations\r\nbearing on this point, and waste of time to discuss the various\r\nkinds of fermentation and the chemical processes therein involved.\r\nYet it may almost be taken for granted, that the fresh-plucked bean\r\ncontains a so-called glycoside[9] which decomposes into grape sugar,\r\ninto an equally amyloids colour stuff (the so-called cacao-red), and\r\nthe nitrogeneous alkaloids Theobromine and Kaffein; a change probably\r\nincidental to the fermentation.[10] The sugar might further split\r\nup into Alcohol and Carbonic Acid Gas, although this is by no means\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nWhilst we have lost our bearings as far as the chemical aspect of\r\nthis process is concerned, we are much more firm in respect to the\r\nbiological, thanks to researches which Dr. v. Preyers has conducted on\r\nthe spot in Ceylon. Preyer’s[11] experiments leave absolutely no room\r\nfor objection, and it can safely be accepted that there are no bacteria\r\npresent in fermentation, but a fungus-like growth rich in life, a\r\nkind of yeast by him called Saccharomyces Theobromae, and described\r\nin passing;[12] facts which constitute the gist of his findings. He\r\nfurther establishes that the presence of bacteria often noticed is\r\nabsolutely undesirable, and that better results are obtained when all\r\nlife is energetically combated, and especially these bacteria. We\r\nshould, then, be confronted with the same phenomenon in the preparation\r\nof cacao as are already met with in beer brewing, and the pressing of\r\nwine and which are still waited for in the preparing of tea and tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe kernel of the fresh bean, “Nips”, is white and has a bitter taste\r\nand alternates in colour between whitish yellow, rose and violet; the\r\nmere influence of solar heat is sufficient to produce the brown cacao\r\npigment, but drying is not so effective as fermentation in removing\r\nthe harsh bitter taste and hence fermented beans are always to be\r\npreferred. These have often acquired a darker colour in the process,\r\ntheir weight is considerably diminished, and their flavour modified to\r\nan oily sweetness, without losing an atom of the original aroma[13].\r\n\r\nCommercially and for manufacturing purposes only the seeds of the\r\ncacao tree are of importance. The root bark is said by Herr Loyer of\r\nManila to be of medicinal value as a remedy for certain common female\r\ncomplaints and is employed by the natives of the Philippine Islands as\r\nan abortifacient. According to Peckoldt[14] the fruit shell contains\r\na considerable amount of material that yields mucilage and might\r\ntherefore be utilised as a substitute for linseed.\r\n\r\n\r\ne) Description of the Beans.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the cacao tree which yield the beans at the present\r\ntime occurring in commerce are.\r\n\r\nTheobroma cacao, Linné the ~true cacao~, spread over the widest\r\narea, and almost ~exclusively cultivated on plantations~, with\r\nmany varieties (Crillo, Forastero etc.) and Theobroma ~bicolor~, a\r\nparty-coloured cacao tree the seeds of which are mixed with Brazilian\r\nand Caracas beans.\r\n\r\nTheobroma speciosum Wildenow, which yields, like Theobroma cacao,\r\nBrazilian beans (magnificent tree).\r\n\r\nTheobroma quayanense, yielding Guiana beans.\r\n\r\nTheobroma silvestre or forest cacao.\r\n\r\nTheobroma subincanum, ~white-leaved-cacao~, and Theobroma\r\nmicrocarpum, ~small-fruited cacao~, ~are met with as\r\nadmixtures~ in Brazilian beans.\r\n\r\nTheobroma glaucum, ~grey cacao~, fruits of which variety are found\r\namong Caracas beans.\r\n\r\nTheobroma angustifolium the ~narrow-leaved~ and Theobroma\r\novatifolium, ~oval leaf~, may be regarded as characteristic of\r\nMexican cacao.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the commercial kinds of cacao, a knowledge of which\r\nis of first importance to manufacturers, it is desirable to consider\r\nthe beans in regard to external form and microscopial structure, in\r\norder that the use of some indispensable scientific expressions in the\r\nsubsequent description of particular commercial kinds of cacao may be\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nThe bean, page 3 Fig. 2 C-G, consists, according to Hanousek[15], of\r\na seed-shell, a seed-skin and the embryo or kernel with the radicle.\r\nThe oval-shaped seed is generally from 16 to 28 mm. long, 10 to 15\r\nmm. broad and from 4 to 7 mm. thick. At the lower end of the bean\r\nthere is a depressed, flattened and frequently circular hilum visible,\r\nfrom which a moderately marked line extends up to the apex of the\r\nbean where it forms the centre of radiating longitudinal ribs—\r\nvascular bundles-extending to the middle of the bean through the outer\r\nseed-coating back to the hilum.\r\n\r\nThe outer seed shell (cf. Fig. 3) is of the thickness of paper,\r\nbrittle, scaly externally and reddish brown, lined with a colourless\r\ntranslucent membrane peeling to the so-called silver membrane\r\n(previously but falsely known as seed envelope) and penetrating into\r\nthe convolutions of the kernel in irregularly divided folds. The shells\r\nof some of the better sorts of beans, such as Caracas, are frequently\r\ncovered with a firmly adherent, dense, reddish-brown powder, consisting\r\nof ferruginous loam originating from the soil on which the beans have\r\nbeen dried and serving as a protection against the attacks of insects.\r\nBut opinions are divided as to, the utility of this process.\r\n\r\nThe fermented kernel consists of two large cotyledons occupying the\r\nwhole bean; it is of fatty lustre, reddish grey or brown colour and\r\noften present a superficial violet tinge; and under gentle pressure\r\nreadily breaks up into numerous angular fragments the surfaces of\r\nwhich are generally bordered by the silver membrane. The fragments can\r\nbe easily recognised when laid in water. At the contact of the lobes\r\nthere is an angular middle rib and two lateral ribs are connected with\r\nthe radicle at the broader end of the bean. The ripe fresh-gathered\r\ncacao-kernel is undoubtedly white and the reddish brown or violet\r\npigment is formed during the fermenting of the bean. But there is\r\nalso a white cacao, though seldom met with. According to information\r\nfurnished by Dr. C. Rimper of Ecuador, it is of rare occurrence and is\r\nnot cultivated to any great extent. In Trinidad also a perfectly white\r\nseeded cacao, producing large fruit and fine kernels, was introduced\r\nfrom Central America by the curator of the Botanic Gardens in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic structure of the shell, Fig. III., presents no\r\nremarkable peculiarity that requires to be noticed here.\r\n\r\nThe delicate inner membrane (fig. 3) coating the cotyledons and\r\npenetrating into their folds consists of several layers. Connected\r\nwith it are club-shaped glandular structures, fig. 4, consisting of\r\nseveral dark coloured cells that are known as the ~Mitscherlich\r\nparticles~. According to A. F. W. Schimper[16] they are hairs fallen\r\nfrom the epidermis (fig. 4) of the cotyledon and do not originate, as\r\nwas formerly supposed, in the inner silver membrane.\r\n\r\nThese structures, named after their discoverer, were formerly supposed\r\nto be algae, or cells of the embryo sac, unconnected with the tissues\r\nof the seed cells. They are, however, as true epidermoid structures,\r\nsimilar to the hairs of other plants.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 3. Cross Section of Shell of Cacao Bean\r\n                        (Tschirsch).\r\n\r\n  _gfb_ vascular bundles\r\n  _co_ cotyledon\r\n  _pc_ ducts\r\n  _f_ pulp\r\n  _fe_ endocarp, or inner coat of fruit\r\n  _se_ epicarp, or skin\r\n  _sch_ mucilagenous, or slime cells\r\n  _lp_ parenchyma, or cellular tissue\r\n  _st_ sklerogenous, or dry cells\r\n  _is_ silver membrane\r\n  _co_ cotyledon\r\n  _gfb_ vascular bundles]\r\n\r\nThese Mitscherlich particles are not only ~characteristic of the seed\r\nmembrane~, but also of the entire seed as well as the preparations\r\nmade from it. Wherever ~cacao is mixed with other materials~,\r\nits presence may be ascertained by microscopical detection of these\r\nstructures, which are peculiar to cacao.\r\n\r\nIn the large elongated, hexagonal cells of the seed membrane there are\r\ntwo other structures to be seen with the aid of high power (250 fold),\r\none appearing as large crystalline druses, while the other consists of\r\nextremely fine needles united in bundles.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n Cross section of the cotyledon, showing “Mitscherlich particles”\r\n (Moeller).]\r\n\r\nBy addition of petroleum spirit the former, consisting of fat acid\r\ncrystals, are dissolved, the latter, remaining unaltered, are\r\nconsidered by Mitscherlich to be theobromine crystals, since their\r\ncrystalline form closely resembles that of theobromine. A more\r\nscientific explanation has not been forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe cotyledons are seen under the microscope to consist of a tissue\r\nof thin walled cells, without cavities, lying close together, and\r\nhere and there distributed through the tissue, cells with brownish\r\nyellow, reddish brown, or violet coloured contents. These latter are\r\nthe pigment cells which contain the substance known as cacao-red and\r\nanalogous to tannin; it, together with theobromine, gives rise to\r\nthe delicate taste and aroma of cacao. The other cells of the tissue\r\nare filled with extremely small starch granules the size of which\r\nrarely exceeds 0.005 mm.; with them are associated fat, in the form of\r\nspear-shaped crystals, and albuminoid substances.\r\n\r\nIn order to discriminate between these substances they must be stained\r\nby various reagents. According to Molisch[17], theobromine may be\r\nrecognised, in sections of the seed, by adding a drop of hydrochloric\r\nacid and after some time an equal drop of auric chloride solution (3\r\n%) After some of the liquid has evaporated, bunches of long yellow\r\ncrystals of theobromine aurochloride make their appearance. On addition\r\nof osmic acid the fat is coloured greyish brown. On addition to the\r\nmicroscopic section a drop of iodine solution, or better iodozine\r\nchloride, the starch becomes blue, while albuminous substances are\r\ncoloured yellow. Cacao starch granules are very small and cannot well\r\nbe mistaken for other kinds, except the starch of some spices such\r\nas pimento or that of Guarana, prepared from the seeds of Paulinna\r\nsorbilis. According to Möller the blue iodine colouration of cacao\r\nstarch takes place very slowly and it is probably retarded by the large\r\namount of fat present; but the point has been contested by Zipperer and\r\nlater investigators.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the starch granules of cacao and the cells containing\r\ncacao-red distinctly visible under the microscope, it is advisable\r\nto immerse the section in a drop of almond oil, because the addition\r\nof water renders the object indistinct in consequence of the large\r\namount of fat present. Another excellent medium for the microscopic\r\nobservation of cacao is the solution of 8 parts of chloral hydrate in 5\r\nparts of water, as recommended by Schimper.[18]\r\n\r\nBy these means it may easily be seen that the pigment or cacao red in\r\ndifferent sorts of cacao varies more or less in colour.\r\n\r\nTo complete the account of the microscopic characters of the cacao\r\ncotyledon, mention must be made of the small ~vascular bundles~,\r\ngenerally spiral, that are distributed throughout the tissues of the\r\ncotyledons and are readily made visible by adding a drop of oil or a\r\ndrop of chloral hydrate solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nf) The Commercial Sorts of the Cacao Bean.\r\n\r\nMindful of Goethe’s dictum: ~Friend, the paths of theory are\r\nuncertain, and hid in gloom~, we propose to devote this chapter\r\nto an exclusively practical discussion of the commercial value of raw\r\ncacao, and from the merchant’s point of view.\r\n\r\nSuch differences of opinion prevail in manufacturing circles as to\r\nthe possible uses of each separate sort, that for this reason alone\r\nany other than a purely geographical classification would scarcely be\r\nfeasible. But apart from this, varying as it does with the protective\r\nduties imposed, the commercial value of cacao can by no means remain\r\na universal constant; and it must be noted that variations in the\r\nnational taste serve to heighten its instability.\r\n\r\nThis latter circumstance also causes a deviation from the nearly\r\nrelated principal that the Motherland becomes chief consumer of the\r\nvarieties grown in her colonies. The cacao sorts of the English\r\nGold-Coast running under the collective name of ~Accra~, have\r\ntaken complete possession of the German market; Trinidad cacao enjoys\r\nimmense popularity in France, and the Dutch pass on the larger part of\r\ntheir Java importations to other consuming nations. As regards this\r\nlatter sort, however, the fact they are chiefly employed as colouring\r\nand covering stuffs for other cacaos must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nIn most cases either the producing country or a principal shipping\r\nport gives its name to the different sorts. Yet paradoxical exceptions\r\nwill at once occur to the reader. The inferior and mediocre Venezuelan\r\nvarieties of the Barlovento district shipped from La Guayra are\r\ngenerally denominated as ~Caracas~, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the capital of the republic Venezuela, situated as it is 1000\r\nmetres above sea level (being about 3300 feet), and therefore quite\r\noutside the cacao zone, has practically no connection with the cacao\r\ntrade. The collective name, Samana still holds good for the cacaos\r\nof the Dominican republic, at least in Germany, although this outlet\r\nof a tiny mountainous peninsular has long ceased to export any but\r\nvery insignificant quantities. Consequently, and rightly, the French\r\nmerchant specifies these sorts as ~Sanchez~, adopting the name\r\nof the principal cacao exporting port of the republic. Arriba, the\r\nchoicest product of Ecuador (port, Guayaquil) takes its name from the\r\nSpanish word arriba, above, the plantations being situated along the\r\nupper sources of the Rio Guayas (to wit, the rivers Daule, Vinces, and\r\nZapotal). Other Guayaquil cacaos are named after the rivers (Balao,\r\nNaranjal) and districts (e. g. Machala) where they are most cultivated.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of so many other cultivated plants, distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of the various sorts are not only determined by the\r\ndifferent species of tree, but are rather and principally dependant on\r\nthe combined effect of physical and climatic conditions. So whether\r\nthe seedling Criollo, the splendid Creole bean native to Venezuela,\r\nbelongs also to the more fruitful Forastero species (spanish forastero,\r\nforeign), a variety less sensitive and consequently commoner, is a\r\nproblem which can only claim secondary consideration.\r\n\r\nApart from the geographical influences mentioned, method and nicety\r\nof procedure are of prime importance in the preparation of the cacao\r\nsorts. Yet technically perfect implements do not always prove the\r\nbest means to an attainment of this end; it being a fact recorded by\r\nexperience that the chemical constituents of the cacao bean reach\r\ntheir fullest developement in such simple and primitive processes as,\r\ne. g. are still patronised in Ecuador and Venezuela. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to observe that these simple and primitive methods postulate\r\nnicety and carefulness, which failing, there will be no lack of defects\r\nin the cacao prepared. On the Haiti/Domingo island, e. g. a variety\r\nof cacao is harvested which is in itself very profitable, as stray\r\nspecimens finding their way to the market testify, but which as an\r\narticle of commerce proves most unreliable, being generally brought\r\non the market in such an unprepared state, that fermentation first\r\ntakes place on the sea voyage, and then of course only in insufficient\r\nmeasure. During this period appear those disagreeable and accompanying\r\nsymptoms technically known as “Vice propre” and the beans, which\r\nwere not completely ripe in the first place, do not develop further,\r\nand greenish breakings in the skin become pronounced, and remain a\r\nsource of terror to the manufacturing world. All attempts made in\r\nEuropean interests to bring about an alteration in this deplorable\r\nstate of affairs have hitherto been lost on the indolence of the\r\nnative planters. Indeed, until the political and economical conditions\r\nprevalent among the mixed Negro population of Haiti/Domingo are\r\nthoroughly reformed, no perceptible improvement can be expected in\r\nthe qualities of the Samana and Haiti cacaos, for which reason, with\r\nrapidly disappearing exceptions, there are scarcely any well organised\r\nplantations in these parts.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Old World, we find in the West African Gold Coast a\r\ntypical example of the possibilities of cultivation on a small scale,\r\nunder proper and competent guidance, and with primitive processes;\r\nfor not only as far as quantitative progress is concerned, but also\r\nin respect to quality, the varieties produced by the natives of this\r\nEnglish colony improve from year to year. Kameroon, a district which\r\nlike the Gold Coast has only taken to the cultivation of cacao of\r\nlate years, provides us with an exactly opposite instance. Here the\r\nplantation system has been in force right from the commencement of\r\nthe industry, with all its technically perfected implements, yet\r\nnevertheless the perfecting of the cacao proceeds very slowly, and\r\nit will be a long time before the produce of this land can lay any\r\nserious claim to specification as a variety for consumption. Its large\r\nproportion of acid ingredient has been above all detrimental, almost\r\ncompletely precluding its use as any other but a mixing sort, although\r\nsome plantations have been yielding comparatively mild cacaos now for\r\nseveral years. We cannot stay to discuss the problem of causes in this\r\ninstance, and whether the fact that the Forastero species has been\r\nexclusively planted prejudices the developement of the cacao, or the\r\nclimatic conditions, must remain an open question. Let it be noted\r\nin passing that the Forastero Bean has taken universal possession of\r\nAfrica, as well in Kameroon, as in the Gold Coast, on the island of St.\r\nThomas and also in the Congo Free State. The Bahia cacao, again, owes\r\nits origin to the Forastero seedling.\r\n\r\nWe will refrain from any further elaboration of this introduction,\r\nhowever, so as not to anticipate the following review of the various\r\ncommercial sorts of cacao.\r\n\r\n\r\nf) I. American Cacao Varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Central America.\r\n\r\nWe begin with\r\n\r\n~Mexico~, the classical cacao land, scarcely of importance to the\r\ngeneral trade, as the greater part of its entire produce, comprising\r\nabout three thousand tons yearly, is consumed in its native country. Of\r\nthe other Central American states, next to\r\n\r\n~Nicaragua~, whose large Venezuelan-like beans find their way to\r\nthe Hamburg market from time to time,\r\n\r\n~Costa Rica~ is above all worthy of mention. This state began to\r\nexport its home produce in 1912, averaging for that year about 60 tons;\r\nand in 1909, the export had already increased to 350 tons, mostly to\r\nEngland and North America, through the shipping port called Port Limon.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. South America.\r\n\r\n~Columbia.~ From this republic come two distinct sorts; the rare,\r\nrounded, and native\r\n\r\n~Cauca~ bean, which is nearly related to the Maracaibo variety,\r\nand which cultivated along the Magdalena river is in the main shipped\r\nfrom Baranquille, on the Caribbean sea, occasionally also from\r\nBueneventura on the Pacific coast; and then the\r\n\r\n~Tumaco Cacao~, so named from the small shipping port on the\r\nEcuador border, which resembles the inferior sorts of the Ecuador coast.\r\n\r\nCauca-and Tumaco-cacaos are only seldom free from defective beans\r\nand worm-eatings, probably less caused by the primitive processes of\r\npreparation than the difficult means of communication in this country.\r\nThen also considerable quantities are retained for home consumption.\r\n\r\n~Ecuador~ is the home of the cacao richest in aroma, the country\r\nwhich first developed the plantation system on a large and well\r\norganised scale, and which was still at the head of cacao-harvesting\r\nlands a few years ago, with a yearly produce of about 32,000 tons.\r\nYet although it had increased this amount to 40,000 tons in the year\r\n1911, Ecuador can only take second rank among cultivating lands, the\r\nGold Coast coming first. The following and most valuable varieties are\r\nembraced under the name of the chief shipping port.\r\n\r\nGUAYAQUIL. They are:\r\n\r\n1. ~Arriba~, i. e. above, these cacaos coming from the upper\r\ntributaries of the rio Guaya (the rivers Daule, Vinces, Publoviejo, and\r\nZapatol). The Arribas, like the Guayaquil cacaos generally, are chiefly\r\nused in the preparation of cacao powders. They form e. g. the principal\r\nconstituents of the Dutch cacao powders, especially the so-called\r\nsuperior Summer-Arriba, harvested from the month of April to July. All\r\nthat is gathered in other seasons falls into the general class “Arriba\r\nsuperior de la época\r\n\r\nThe cacaos of the months immediately following on Summer, the\r\n~rebuscos~, after crop, are as a rule the most inferior varieties\r\nof arriba, whilst the Christmas harvest of the months of January and\r\nFebruary (cosecha de Navidad) often yields quite excellent sorts.\r\n\r\n2. ~Machála~, second in importance among the Guayaquil sorts,\r\nrather more fatty than the ariba, and differing from this again in\r\nAroma and the colour of its kernel, which is of a rather darker brown.\r\nChief cultivation occurs in the low lying land bordering on Peru and\r\nlying opposite the island of Jambeli, where the prevailing climatic\r\nconditions are quite different from those in the arriba districts,\r\nalthough these are not far removed. August and September are the\r\nharvest months for Machala. Ten years ago this sort was shipped in\r\nlarge measure from the then newly created harbour Puerto Bolivar. But\r\nsince large ocean going steamers no longer call there, it now takes the\r\nmore roundabout route via Guayaquil.\r\n\r\n3. ~Baláo.~ This variety can be described as a mean between\r\nMachala and Arriba. It has some of the characteristics of both, the\r\nbean being somewhat rounder.\r\n\r\n4. ~Naranjal~ and ~Tenguél~ are likewise subdivisions of\r\nthe foregoing, except that the bean is here much larger and flatter.\r\nAs the production of all three sorts, and especially of Balao, is\r\nsubstantially greater than what finds its way to the market, we may\r\nreasonably assume that a large proportion is used for mixing purposes,\r\nand sails on commercial seas, as it were, under false colours.\r\nCultivating district: the Machala district situated along the Jambeli\r\ncanal, and the stretch of coast watered by the rivers Balao and\r\nNaranjal.\r\n\r\n5. Pegados (i. e. stuck together) or Pelatos (balls) is the description\r\nof the cacaos comprised of series of 4-10 beans rolled together,\r\ngenerally developing from overripe fruit. They experience a particular\r\nkind of fermentation, apparently the result of the fruity substances\r\nstill evident, which gives the light coloured kernels a soft aromatic\r\nflavour. For several years these sorts have rarely been seen on the\r\nEuropean market, they being generally reserved for home consumption.\r\n\r\n6. ~Oscuros~, i. e. dark coloured, a refuse sort rightly viewed\r\nwith suspicion in manufacturing circles—Pelotas soaked in water, or\r\nbeans left in the clefts and fissures of the drying chamber floors.—The\r\nblack shell of the bean encloses a brownish and dirty-looking kernel,\r\nthe colour sometimes approaching black: the whole bean giving a\r\ndisagreeable impression, as it is often disfigured with mould, and\r\npossessed of a disagreeable odour. For several years this variety\r\nserved the “crooks” of the commercial world as mixing material for\r\nthe so-called “flavouring” of Machala, but it now again appears as a\r\ndistinct sort.\r\n\r\nThe shipping port for all these cacao sorts is Guayaquil; though other\r\nharbours also handle valuable varieties. Such, for example, are\r\n\r\n a) ~Bahia de Caraquéz~, and the small haven of Manta lying\r\n south of this town, which deals in a sort resembling a blended\r\n Machala-Balao, though occasionally light brown in appearance and of\r\n aromatic flavour. This cacao is generally labelled as ~Caraquéz~\r\n for short, and is to be distinguished from ~Caraque~, the French\r\n term for Caracas cacao.\r\n\r\n The chief harvesting months are June and July; the April-May arrivals,\r\n however, are usually better, as the setting-in of the rainy season\r\n increases the difficulties of drying. The harvest in 1909 reached\r\n 3,000 tons, and is normally from 2000 to 5,000 tons yearly.\r\n\r\n b) ~Esmeraldas~, similar to the foregoing, but of perceptibly\r\n inferior output, possesses only a very insignificant yield (about 150\r\n tons a year), and this in spite of the cultivating capacities of the\r\n interior.\r\n\r\n~Peru~, the most southerly producing land on the west coast can\r\nlikewise only boast of a very insignificant yield, chiefly destined for\r\nhome consumption.\r\n\r\n~Brazil~, with its two great sorts for consumption, Bahia and\r\nPara cacao, and a yearly production of round 33,000 tons, has from the\r\nyears 1906-1909 far outrun all other harvesting lands. Yet although it\r\nwas able to increase this to 36,250 tons in 1911 it must nevertheless\r\ntake second place among cultivating lands, the Gold Coast and Ecuador\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\nA most important factor on the market is included under the\r\nspecification ~Bahia~-cacao. Here again the shipping port has\r\ngiven its name to the cacao sort. It is harvested in three southerly\r\nsituated districts, Ilheos, Belmonte, and Canavieiras, and is\r\ndespatched to Bahia from harbours of the same name, in sailing vessel\r\nwhich sometimes ship a thousand sacks.\r\n\r\nIlheos despatches the inferior of the two principal varieties “Fair\r\nfermented” and “Superior fermented” that is, the first-named, and so\r\nfurnishes two-thirds of the Bahia crop. The cacao areas in the district\r\nof Ilheos are situated on rather high and mountainous ground, where\r\narresting atmospheric conditions often predominate. Also the absence of\r\nany waterway whatever renders it a necessity to despatch the cacao to\r\nBahia on beasts of burden, which during the rainy season can scarcely\r\nfind a footing on the beaten tracks. It is, then, the unfavourable\r\natmospheric conditions, combined with a certain carelessness on the\r\npart of the planter in the preparing processes, which prejudices the\r\notherwise excellent quality of the Bahia bean, and more especially in\r\nthe months of June, July and August.\r\n\r\nAt this period it is no rarity to find from 10 to 20 percent of waste\r\nbeans, and in general only the December-February months offer anything\r\napproaching a guarantee as to quality. But here no hard and fast rule\r\ncan be adduced.\r\n\r\nBelmonte and Canavieiras are the districts of the “Superior fermented”\r\ncacaos. The lower lay of the land is responsible for other climatic\r\nconditions, and in addition, both harbours here are situated at the\r\nmouths of rivers which afford an easy and sure means of transport. So\r\nthe cacao, which is also better roasted,—a few planters even drying in\r\novens—reaches the market in a much better condition, and fetches at\r\nleast from 3-4 sh. a cwt. more than the “Fair Fermented” variety.\r\n\r\nIn all three districts, the beans are prepared in wooden boxes, covered\r\nwith banana skin, in which the Ilheos variety is allowed to ferment\r\nfrom 2-3 days, and the superior from 2-5 days: this after they have\r\nbeen well shaken up. In Belmonte considerable drying takes place on the\r\nsand there deposited by the river in large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe harvesting is generally reckoned from April 1st. to March 31st.\r\nIn June and July is the intermediate harvest, whilst the months from\r\nOctober to February supply the bulkiest crops.\r\n\r\nThe Bahia district yields yearly about 33,500 tons, a fourth part of\r\nwhich is devoted to the consumption of the United States, the remainder\r\nchiefly going to Germany, France and Switzerland. The return is still\r\non the increase, and large stretches of land await cultivation.\r\n\r\n~Para~ cacao is the denomination of all those sorts shipped from\r\nthe tracts of land lying along the banks of the Amazon and its mighty\r\ntributaries, more especially from Manaos and Itacoatiara, through Para,\r\na port situated on the eastern arm of the delta. These varieties may\r\nbe classed as intermediary between Bahia and good Sumana. The yearly\r\nyield (harvest months June-August) amounts to about 5,000 tons, a\r\ncomparatively small figure in view of the enormous expanses capable\r\nof planting, where the cacao tree at present grows wild, or at least\r\nuncultivated. It is true that the returns for 1891 reached 6,500; only\r\nto be diminished by half in 1908. France is by far the chief country\r\nconsuming Para cacao; the sort not meeting with especial favour in\r\nother states.\r\n\r\n~Guiana.~ Of the three colonies belonging to France, Holland,\r\nand Great Britain respectively, which go under this name, only the\r\nintermediate one, Dutch Guiana, is of importance in the world’s cacao\r\ntrade. It comes into consideration under the name of\r\n\r\n~Surinam~ cacao. The yield, which should in normal years amount\r\nto about 3,000 tons (1899 providing the record with approximately\r\n4,000 tons), has been considerably impaired by tree diseases and\r\nparasites. The return for 1904 only amounted to 850 tons, for example.\r\nBut meanwhile Holland had hit upon excellent measures to battle against\r\nthe enemies of the tree, and the years 1909 and 1910 had in consequence\r\nalready improved this to 2,000 tons. The bean has some resemblance to\r\nthe Trinidad bean, as far as quality is concerned.\r\n\r\n~Venezuela~, one of the earliest cultivating lands, is the\r\nhome of the Criollo bean, and of the most splendid specimens of\r\nbean in general, sorts which play a prominent part in the Chocolate\r\nManufacture. The Venezuelan bean is rather long and round, and\r\nits kernel of a beautiful light brown, with a mild sweet flavour.\r\nUnfortunately the plantations have recently been interspersed with\r\nForastero or Trinidad-Criollo trees—called in Venezuela “Trinitarios\r\nbecause brought over from Trinidad, a species which requires less\r\nattention and bears more fruit, but which just on that account supplies\r\ncommoner and mediocre beans, slowly fermenting, and often developing a\r\nviolet hue. The preparation is here of the simplest; the beans e. g.\r\nare dried on clay-covered floors, and in rainy weather earthy fragments\r\noften adhere to them. Yet such “Patios” or “Then-dales”, (clay floors)\r\nare only in use on the small “haciendas” (plantations). The colouring\r\nof the Venezuelan bean with an ocre-like earth constitutes an especial\r\npeculiarity. It is adopted in particular for the medium and finer\r\nsorts. The earth is mostly sent from the neighbourhood of Choroni to\r\nthe two large shipping ports Puerto Cabello and La Guayra, where the\r\ncolouring or “Earthification” of the cacaos to be exported ensues. The\r\nearth, varying in colour from a dirty yellow to brick-red, is mixed to\r\na thin paste with sea-water, and afterwards placed in the sun on large\r\nsieves, or spread over cement floors. Where the colouring takes place\r\nimmediately on the plantation, the yellowish brown earth everywhere\r\navailable is utilised; and where sea-water cannot be obtained, as on\r\nthe Rio Tuy, for example, there the beans are coloured with a mixture\r\nprepared from crushed and almost liquid cacao fruits and this same\r\nyellowish brown earth, as the use of fresh water is thought to afford\r\nbut inferior protection against mould growths. Such juice-coloured\r\ncacaos, and occasionally also the Ocumare sorts, are often covered\r\nwith a rather thick earthy crust. Professional opinion concerning the\r\nutility of this colouring varies greatly. In France, the principal\r\ncountry consuming Venezuelan cacao, it is still maintained that the\r\nthin earthy crust not only enables the bean to resist the penetration\r\nof mildew, but also admits of a kind of after-fermentation, together\r\nwith developement and preservation of the most valuable constituents\r\nof the cacao bean. Colouring is then the rule for the finer Caracas\r\nsorts, and all varieties shipped through Puerto Cabello; it is also in\r\nuse at Carupano, for export to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Venezuelan cacaos are divided as follows, and with one exception\r\ntake their names from the chief shipping ports, to which they are\r\nbrought in small sailing vessels tapping the villages dotted along the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n 1. ~Maracaibo~ cacao, the noble, large, and always uncoloured\r\n bean found on the shore of Sea of Maracaibo.\r\n\r\n 2. ~Puerto Cabello~, quite the finest of all cacao sorts, with\r\n the following sub-classes, each named after tiny harbours in the\r\n vicinity: Chuáo, Borburato, Chichiriviche, San Felipe (coloured with\r\n its own peculiar light brown earth) Ocumare, Choroni.\r\n\r\n 3. ~Caracas~ cacao, exceptionally so-called, although quite a\r\n small proportion, namely that brought over the mountains from the Rio\r\n Tuy district in donkey caravans, now touches the republican capital.\r\n La Guayra, rather, is the shipping port for the so-called Caracas\r\n sorts, to which belong all the cacaos from the fertile Barlavento\r\n district east of La Guayra, a region watered by two rivers, Rio Tuy\r\n and Rio Chico, and with the following outlets; Rio Chico (which gives\r\n its name to the most ordinary of sorts), Higuerote, and Capaya. The\r\n plantations hard on the mountainous coastal slopes produce a very fine\r\n bean, of equal value with the Puerto Cabello.\r\n\r\n 4. ~Carupano~ cacao, a sound Venezuelan medium sort, generally\r\n coming into use uncoloured; the arrivals from the easterly harbour Rio\r\n Caribe also belong to this sort, and also the cacaos of Irapa, Guiria,\r\n and Cano Colorado, often shipped from the port of Trinidad lying\r\n opposite.\r\n\r\n From ~Angostura~ (Ciudad Bolivar) on the Orinoco and San Fernando\r\n on the Apure, only very insignificant quantities arrive.\r\n\r\n They speak of a Christmas and a Summer (June 21st) harvest in\r\n Venezuela; but the first four months of the year are generally the\r\n most productive. The total produce of Venezuela amounts to about\r\n 16,000 tons, of which as export there fall to\r\n\r\n  La Guayra          about 8,000 tons.\r\n  Puerto Cabello     about 3,000 tons.\r\n  Carupano                        about 4,500 tons.\r\n  Maracabio and via Trinidad      about 500   tons.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. The Antilles.\r\n\r\nTrinidad produces a cacao which on many plantations, or estates, as\r\nthey are called, receives preparation at the hands of experts, and\r\nis very highly esteemed in commerce, and especially in England and\r\nFrance. The best and generally slightly coloured sorts are specified\r\nas “Plantation”, the medium “Estates”, after the English name, and the\r\ninferior “Fair Trinidad shipping cacao The bean “Trinidad criollo” is\r\noval, yet not so rounded as the Venezuelan; its kernel is for the most\r\npart dark-coloured, still brown in the better varieties, but inky black\r\namong the inferior. It is customary in Trinidad to trade the cacaos as\r\nprime specimens and to assign to them the name of a species which not\r\ninfrequently furnishes no true indication of their origin. “Soconusco”\r\nand “San Antonio” are particularly high-sounding; mention can further\r\nbe made of “Montserrat”, “La Gloria”, “Maraval”, “Belle Fleur”, “El\r\nReposo” etc. Chief harvest, December to February inclusive, by-harvest\r\nMay to August.\r\n\r\nThe total export from Trinidad amounts to about 22,500 tons yearly.\r\nThe substantially smaller island of Grenada, also British, contributes\r\nabout 6,000 tons a year to the world’s supply. Owing to the prevalence\r\nof like climatic and geological conditions, the yield and quality are\r\nhere the same as on the neighbouring island of Trinidad. The chief\r\nconsumer of the Grenada cacaos is the Motherland, and the same holds\r\ngood for the small British islands of St. Vincent, St. Lucia and\r\nDominique, all of little import in the general trade of the world.\r\n\r\nMartinique-and Guadeloupe-cacaos, hailing from the French islands so\r\nnamed, with a yearly production varying from 5,000 to 7,500 tons,\r\nonly come into consideration for the consumption of the Motherland,\r\nwhich affords them an abatement of 50 percent in connection with the\r\ntariffs. San Domingo, the larger and eastern part of the Haiti island,\r\nalready contributes about 20,000 tons yearly to the universal harvest.\r\nEspecially in the last ten years has the cacao cultivation here\r\nreceived considerable expansion (yield 1894 2,000 tons, 1904 13,500\r\ntons) and as vast suitable tracts of land are to hand, this country\r\nwould justify the highest expectations, if the general political and\r\neconomical relations of the double republic and a certain indolence of\r\nthe planters, all small farmers, had not to be allowed for.\r\n\r\nA methodical preparation only seldom takes place. Processes are limited\r\nto a very necessary drying, as a rule, so that the cacao, excellent in\r\nitself, takes rank among the lowest as a commercial quality. The chief\r\ngatherings occur in the months of May, June and July. The shipping\r\nports are Puerta Plata on the north-coast, Sanchez and Sumana on the\r\nBight of Samana, and La Romana, San Pedro de Macoris and Santo Domingo\r\n(the capital) on the south coast. Tiny Samana, situated on a small\r\ntongue of land, and so outlet for no extensive region, has given its\r\nname to Domingo cacao as a commercial sort, as from here the first\r\nshipments were dispatched.\r\n\r\n~Sanchez~ cacao, so named because Sanchez, where the transports\r\ncome from the fruitful district of Cibao as far as La Vega, is the\r\nchief exporting harbour of the republic. From the same district,\r\nstarting at Santiago, there is yet another line, this time running\r\nnorthwards to Puerto Plata on the coast. The cacao of this northerly\r\nprovince of Cibao is generally held in higher esteem than that coming\r\nfrom the southern harbours.\r\n\r\nThe United States, which have recently developed an interest in\r\nthe land for political reasons, have been promoted to first place\r\namong its customers during the last few years; and then follow\r\nFrance and Germany. It can only be hoped that this influence grows,\r\nin view of the thereby doubtlessly accelerated improvements in the\r\npreparation processes. Up to the present, varieties free from blame are\r\nconspicuously rare. Uniformity as regards the weight of the sacks has\r\nnot been possible, owing to the diversity of the means of transport.\r\nDistricts lying along the railways, or close to the harbours, make use\r\nof 80-100 kg. sacks (about 176-220 lbs.) But where transport must be\r\nmade on beasts of burden, sacks of from 65-70 kilos (143-154 lbs.) are\r\nthe rule.\r\n\r\n~Haiti~ cacao, coming from the Negro republic of the same name,\r\nis the most inferior of all commercial sorts, chiefly on account\r\nof the incredibly neglective preparation which it undergoes, for\r\nexceptions prove that the bean is capable of being developed into a\r\nvery serviceable cacao. Beans covered with a thick gray coloured earthy\r\ncrust, often even mixed with small pebbles and having a gritty, and\r\nwhere healthy, black-brown beaking kernel. The “Liberty and Equality”\r\nof the Negros and Mulattos in this corrupted republic are mirrored\r\nin its plantation system, the land being cultivated but little, and\r\nrunning almost wild. To effect a change in this state of affairs, that\r\nisland law must first of all be abolished, whereby every stranger is\r\nprevented from acquiring landed estate in Haiti.\r\n\r\nThe yield, about 2,500 tons, is chiefly exported from Jérémic, then\r\nalso from the harbours Cap Haitien, Port de Paix, Petit Goave, and Port\r\nau Prince. France and the United States are the principal customers.\r\nThe neighbouring island of\r\n\r\n~Cuba~ also delivers the greater part of its cacao produce to\r\nthe United States, amounting to between 1,000 and 3,000 tons, a fact\r\nexplained by geographical, political and freight considerations.\r\n\r\nThanks to its careful preparation, this bean, which resembles the\r\nDomingo in many respects, is preferred, and fetches a correspondingly\r\nhigher price. The shipping port is Santiago de Cuba, situated in the\r\nsouth-eastern portion of the island.\r\n\r\nJamaica, with its yearly harvest of about 2,500 tons, principally\r\nattends to the wants of the Mother Country.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. African Cacao Varieties.\r\n\r\nCacao cultivation in Africa is of comparatively recent date. The\r\nplantations found on the three islands San Thomé and Principe\r\n(Portuguese), and Fernando Po (Spanish), lying in the Gulf of Guinea,\r\nare the oldest. To the first-named island may be traced much of the\r\nimpulse given to cacao plantation in other African districts, so rapid\r\nhas been its success here, under the energetic guidance of the skilful\r\nPortuguese planter, and the yet more effective propitious climatic\r\ninfluences and favourable industrial conditions.\r\n\r\nRare sorts are nowhere to be met with, for the Forastero bean has\r\nconquered the whole of Africa. The sorts produced are accordingly\r\nrather adapted for general consumption. St. Thomas and the Gold Coast\r\nprovide a third of the world’s present-day cacao supply, and in the\r\nEnglish colony especially, the geological and climatic conditions are\r\nof such a kind, that the\r\n\r\n~Gold Coast~ might very well become to the raw cacao market of the\r\nfuture what the Brazilian province, San Paulo, is now to the coffee\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the “Eighties”, the Swiss Missionary Society planted\r\nin the vicinity of their station, and so started the cultivation of\r\nthe cacao tree now flourishing throughout the land. The first fruits\r\ncame to Europe in 1891, and in 1894 already totalled 20 tons. In 1901\r\nit was 1,000 tons, 1906 approaching 10,000 tons, and the year 1911\r\nprovided the record with about 40,000 tons. It is true that complaints\r\nwere long and rightly lodged concerning the inferior quality, due to\r\ncarelessness on the part of the natives in conducting the processes\r\nof preparation. But since the year 1909, there have appeared on the\r\nmarket side by side with the inferior and so-called current qualities,\r\nwhich still retains more or less of the defects of the earlier produce,\r\nanother and properly fermented cacao, in no mean quantities; it is very\r\npopular in all cacao-consuming lands, and fetches from 2 to 3 shillings\r\nper cwt. more than the current qualities. All this has been achieved\r\nthrough intelligent and sympathetic guidance and control of the small\r\nnative planter on the government’s part, without resource to any large\r\norganised plantation system.\r\n\r\n~Accra~ cacao, then, as the sorts of the African Gold Coast are\r\ncollectively named, also promises to be the cacao of the future, if\r\nit can maintain its quantitative and qualitative excellence. There is\r\nindeed no want of soil and adequate labour strength in that province.\r\nApart from Accra, Addah, Axim, Cape Coast Castle, Prampram, Winebah,\r\nSaltpond, Secondi must be mentioned above all. The chief harvest is\r\nfrom October to February.\r\n\r\n~Togo~, the small German colony adjoining the British Gold Coast, has\r\ntill now had only a yearly yield of 250 tons in a variety resembling\r\nAccra. The excellent beans prepared on the plantations fetch several\r\nshillings a cwt. more than Accra, whilst the deliveries of the natives\r\nrank below the current specimens of this sort. Its port is Lome.\r\n\r\n~Lagos~, the British Colony bordering on Dahomey and east of the Gold\r\nCoast, is watered by the Niger and possesses cacao exporting ports in\r\nLagos, Bonni and Old Calabar, and exports about 4,000 tons of a sort\r\nresembling Accra, but nevertheless not so well prepared and so of\r\ninferior value.\r\n\r\nThe cacao plantations of the Lagos colony,—more properly known as\r\nSouthern Nigeria—lie on either side of the great Niger delta, in low\r\nlying land where the climatic and geological conditions are quite\r\ndifferent from those in the neighbouring German possession of\r\n\r\n~Kameroon~, in which country steep slopes and the narrow coastal strip\r\nat the foot of the Kameroon range, lofty mountains, perhaps 13,000\r\nft. high, constitute the cacao cultivating region. Consequently the\r\nsame variety of seed, the Forastero, here produces a different kind of\r\nfruit. The Kameroon bean has its own peculiar characteristics; although\r\nthere is some resemblance to that produced on the opposite islands of\r\nFernando Po, Principe, and St. Thomas; and the milder sorts from the\r\n“Victoria” and “Moliwa” plantations often do duty as a substitute for\r\nthe latter variety. There is no other bean which contains so much\r\nacid as the Kameroon, and although this statement must be modified in\r\nview of improvements in recent years, the fact prevents the largest of\r\nGerman colonial sorts from serving as any other than a mixing variety.\r\n\r\nCultivation is the rule throughout Kameroon, with the exception of\r\nDoula, and the produce of the separate plantations, such as Victoria,\r\nBibundi, and Moliwe, Bimbia, Debundscha and so forth, all of which\r\nbelong to large Berlin and Hamburg companies, is influenced and\r\ndifferentiated by variations in the technique of preparation. There\r\nare smooth beans with blackish-brown shells, and others of a red-brown\r\nhue and shrivelled, some with traces of fruit pulp, and others again\r\nquite light-coloured, with occasional black specks resulting from a too\r\nthorough drying.\r\n\r\nThe chief gathering begins in September and ends in January.\r\nExportation began in the year 1899 with 5 cwts. The produce in 1898\r\nfigured at 200 tons and it had in the year 1910 grown to 3,500 tons.\r\nGermany is of course the principal consumer, although England has since\r\n1909 bought very much Kameroon cacao as St. Thomas.\r\n\r\n~Kongo~ is a bean resembling the finer St. Thomas, but smaller and\r\noften smoky. It comes on the market via Antwerp. Up to the present\r\nFrench Congo has only produced a few thousand hundredweights yearly,\r\nbut the Belgian Congo Free State has managed to achieve an annual\r\noutput of 900 tons towards the close of the last decade; and when this\r\ncountry takes the Gold Coast as model, perhaps Congo cacao will one day\r\nplay an important rôle in the world of commerce.\r\n\r\n~St. Thomas~, the small Portuguese island lying in the Gulf of\r\nGuinea, and almost on the Equator, produces a sort which enjoys immense\r\npopularity, and especially in Germany, which traces a fourth part of\r\nits consumption back to this island. The export figures are\r\n\r\n  1889       2,000 tons.\r\n  1894       6,000 tons.\r\n  1899      11,500 tons.\r\n  1904      18,000 tons.\r\n  1910      38,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThese are estimates which make the Portuguese planter worthy of all\r\nrespect. It is true that “Black ivory” has been utilised on a large\r\nscale, the exploiting of black labour having resulted in a boycotting\r\nof these St. Thomas sorts on the part of some English manufacturers,\r\nbut less on account of harsh treatment on the plantations themselves as\r\nthe manner of recruiting in Angola.\r\n\r\nFine Thomas is the description of those sorts which have been used\r\nin an unmixed condition owing to their indigestibility, but properly\r\ngathered and fermented. The inferior and slightly damaged cacaos picked\r\nout from these are called by the Portuguese planter “Escolas”, or\r\nassorted. Yet they do not come into commerce under this designation,\r\nbeing mostly used for making up sample collections which illustrate the\r\ndifference between these and ~Fine Thomas~. The latter is traded\r\nthrough Lisbon “On Approval of Sample\r\n\r\nAll the St. Thomas cacao trade passes through Lisbon; for the tariff\r\nregulations of the Portuguese government make direct connection between\r\nthe island and the consuming land practically impossible. France indeed\r\nchooses the route via Madeira, unloading and reloading, to avoid the\r\nadditional duties. The cacao is at Lisbon stored in the two great\r\nCustom-houses there, and prepared for despatch to the respective lands.\r\nFine St. Thomas is reshipped in the original sacks.\r\n\r\nThe samples are offered under various marks, either the initials of\r\nthe planter or the name of a plantation. We mention a few of the best\r\nknown; U. B., D. V., R. O., “M. Valle Flor”, “Boa Entrada”, “Monte\r\nCafé”, “Santa Catarina”, “Pinheira”, “Agua Izé”, “Colonia Acoriana”,\r\n“Queluz”, “Gue Gue”, “Rosema”, “Pedroma”, “Monte Macaco\r\n\r\nThe beans vary, as far as shell and kernel are concerned, according\r\nto the mode of preparation on the plantations and the structure of\r\nthe soil from which they spring. Many which were formerly universally\r\nesteemed are now no longer preferred because the soil in the meantime\r\nhas been worked out; and many are now described under different marks.\r\nYet particular characteristics still continue; there are mild and\r\nstrong sorts, smooth and shrivelled varieties which look as though they\r\nhave been washed, and others black like the Cameroon bean. All are\r\noffered as Fine Thomas, and enjoy an immense popularity.\r\n\r\nGood ~medium Thomas~ is the commercial designation of those\r\ncacaos hailing from small plantations which have undergone a scarcely\r\nsufficient preparation owing to the lack of proper apparatus, and\r\nwhich are always interspersed with black or sham beans. In so far\r\nas these are delivered from large plantations, they generally owe\r\ntheir origin to overripe fruit, probably overlooked in the gathering\r\nseason; or fruits bitten by the rats which infest this island may also\r\ncontribute such beans. Almost all these inferior cacaos are sorted\r\nin the Lisbon custom-houses, and thinned down to the quality “Medium\r\nThomas” free from objection or “Good Medium Thomas The two months of\r\nthe Summer harvest, July and August, supply a somewhat better variety\r\nof cacao, known in commerce as “Pajol”, i. e. literally, “Hailing from\r\nthe country”, which generally fetches a rather higher price. During\r\nthe Winter harvest from November to February the medium St. Thomas\r\nvarieties come on the market, but not before the beginning of the\r\nyear, as previous to that point of time only the regular harvest of\r\n~Fine St. Thomas~ comes into consideration. All attempts on the\r\npart of consumers to effect an improvement in the quality of the medium\r\nvarieties have unfortunately hitherto proved abortive, for they are\r\nregarded as by-produce on the larger estates, and the small ones do not\r\npossess the apparatus necessary for a thorough preparation. Then again\r\nit is seen that these inferior sorts are taken off the market at very\r\nreasonable prices.\r\n\r\nFernando Po, a mountainous island, situated immediately off Cameroon,\r\nmay be regarded as a source of supply for the Motherland, Spain,\r\nand only as such, for its yearly output of 2500 tons need fear no\r\ncompetition, thanks to the excessive tariffs laid on the produce of\r\nother lands here. The qualities here are inferior to those from St.\r\nThomas and Cameroon, chiefly because most plantation are in the hands\r\nof blacks and consequently not well managed.\r\n\r\n~German East Africa~, ~Madagascar~, ~Mayotta~ (Comoren) and ~Réunion~\r\nwith their dwarfish yield are only worthy of passing mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Asiatic Cacao Sorts.\r\n\r\nThe only cacao plantations deserving the name on the continent of\r\nAsia are those occurring on the two islands of Ceylon and Java, both\r\nproducing a sort differing entirely from the Africans, the predominant\r\nseedling here planted being the Trinidad-Criollo. The Ceylon-Java bean\r\nis, like the genuine Criollo, oval shaped, inclining to a sphere; its\r\nkernel is light brown and among the finer sorts even whitish. So both\r\nvarieties are principally used for colouring and covering the cacao\r\nmass, for neither has a very pronounced flavour. The shell is light\r\nbrown or reddish brown after washing, and appears free from all traces\r\nof pulp. It sits loosely on the kernel, at least in the case of the\r\nJava bean, and is consequently often met with broken.\r\n\r\n~Ceylon~, with the shipping port of Colombo, produces in a good\r\nyear from 3,500 to 4,000 tons, about two-thirds of which are traded\r\nthrough London. Direct shipments to Germany have recently been more\r\nand more frequent; Australia also claims consideration as a consuming\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe different sorts, or rather, qualities, for a very careful\r\npreparation ensures the excellence of the goods, go under the\r\ndescription fine, or medium, or ordinary, and occasionally are\r\nutilised as typical examples. The better sorts come exclusively from\r\nplantations, and the ordinary are the result of native enterprise.\r\n\r\n~Java~ also produces a large quantity, the cacao here being chiefly\r\nplanted on the north side of this long, narrow island. More than a half\r\nis exported from the port of Samarang, then follow Batavia, Soerabaja\r\nand a few minor places, with a total output of about 2,500 tons. The\r\nlarger proportion of this cacao is sold in the markets of Amsterdam\r\nand Rotterdam to Dutch merchants, who pass it on to other consuming\r\ncountries. England, North America, Australia, China and the Philippines\r\nare the chief customers.\r\n\r\nThose sorts coming from the neighbouring islands of Celebes, Timor,\r\nBali, Amboina and Lombok may also be considered as sub-classes of the\r\nJava; but they do not total more than 75 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Australian Cacao Sorts.\r\n\r\nCacao plantation in Australia is still in its early stages. Most\r\nprogressive is\r\n\r\n~Samoa~, which has increased its 1900 export of 30 cwt. to 200 tons at\r\nthe present time, among which right excellent qualities occur, culled\r\nfrom Criollo trees. The deteriorated Forastero has also recently been\r\nplanted, which we must allow to be more fruitful and less dependent on\r\ncareful nursing. The Samoa Criollo bean resembles the large fine Ceylon\r\nvariety, except that it has a more pronounced flavour.\r\n\r\n~New Guinea and Bismarck-Archipelagoes~ can only claim casual mention\r\nas experimentally interested in cacao cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\ng) The Trade in Cacao and the Consumption of Cacao Products; Statistics.\r\n\r\nAlthough cacao and cacao products have always been held in the highest\r\nesteem, ever since they first became known in Europe, yet price\r\nconsiderations long prevented them from enjoying the same widespread\r\npopularity among the lower classes as tea and coffee. Thanks, however,\r\nto the improved means of transport established in the course of\r\nthe last fifty years, which has cheapened all exotic produce, the\r\ndemand for these wares has of late been more frequent and urgent,\r\nand is reflected in the constantly increasing influx of cacao on the\r\nEuropean markets and the systematic opening out of new regions to the\r\nraw material, just as corresponding extensions in the factory world\r\ncontribute towards a reduction in the cost of the products. Hence cacao\r\nmay now be described as a luxury within the reach of everyman. Its\r\ndiffusion among all grades of the population may be regarded as a great\r\nblessing, for in it has arisen a new [Transcriber’s Note: a line is\r\nmissing here] merely a stimulant, like tea or coffee, but a beverage in\r\nthe proper sense of the term, analytically so established.\r\n\r\nIt will accordingly prove of interest to glance through the returns\r\nin connection with the trade in these goods, their importation\r\nand exportation, commercial values of the same, and the relative\r\nconsumption of cacao, tea and coffee.\r\n\r\nSuch figures are always at hand. The surprisingly rapid growth of the\r\ncacao cultivation, and the manufacture of cacao products, is e. g.\r\nat once apparent in statistics furnished by the French government.\r\nIn 1857 the number of 5,304,207 kilos of beans were consumed there.\r\nThe importations of the year 1895, on the other hand, amounted to\r\n32,814,724 kilos, having in the space of 38 years increased more than\r\nsixfold. Of this quantity, almost the half, comprising about 15,234,163\r\nkilos, is disposed of retail.\r\n\r\nTurning to the trade in Germany, the cacao industry here and its\r\nconsumption,[19] we are again greeted with cheery prospects. According\r\nto the official inquiry, German trade in Cacao products for the years\r\n1907-1910 is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n~Table~ 1.\r\n\r\n  ========================+===================+============================\r\n  No. on offic. statistics|                   |  Exports from Germany\r\n      +———————————————————+                   |Duty|\r\n      |Description|     Imports to Germany    |Free|—————— inclusive —————\r\n      |           | 1907 | 1908 | 1909 | 1910 |1910| 1907| 1908| 1909| 1910\r\n  ====+===========+======+======+======+======+====+=====+=====+=====+=====\r\n      |           |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n   63 |Cacao Bean |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      | raw       |345154|343519|407248|439413|  — | 1390| 1186| 1429| 1620\r\n      |           |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n   64 |Cacao Shell|      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      | whole     |    55|     1|     6|     6|  — |12802| 9901|11825|17006\r\n      |           |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n  168 |Cacao Butter|     |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      | Cacao Oil |   243|   106|   208|  263|22223|20804|18494|27291|22465\r\n      |           |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n  203a|Cacao Mass,|      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      |Ground Cacao|     |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      | shells    |   165|  1196|   128|    58| 125| 3430| 3519| 3694| 5219\r\n      |           |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n  203b|Cacao      |  6792|  8148|  6497|  6446|2599| 3050| 1752| 2803| 3755\r\n      |  Powder   |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      |           |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n  204a|Chocolate &|      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      | Chocolate |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      |Equivalents| 11636| 10050| 12197| 15183|1513| 5021| 3671| 4609| 4712\r\n      |           |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n  204b|Products   |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      |from Cacao |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      |Mass, Cacao|      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      | Powder,   |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      |Chocolate  |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      |   and     |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      | Chocolate |      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      |Equivalents,|     |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      | Acorn, and|      |      |      |      |    |     |     |     |\r\n      | Oat cacaos|  1239|  1281|  1258|  1140|2027| 4260| 4439| 4555| 4964\r\n\r\nThe year 1910 brought a total import of 878,413 cwts. of raw cacao,\r\nthus overtopping the figures of the previous year, which had created a\r\nrecord with 814,496 cwts., by 64,330 cwts.\r\n\r\nComing to the geographical distribution, we find that they were\r\nimported into Germany in the following proportions, namely:\r\n\r\n                                                              Comparison\r\n                                              1910     1909      with\r\n                                                               previous\r\n                                                                 years\r\n  British West Africa                 cwts.  206 180  189 686  +  6 494\r\n  Port.

It is interesting, in view of\r\nrecent occurrences, to note the quantities despatched from the various\r\nplaces. The importations from St. Thomas, for instance, show a striking\r\nincrease. They stand at the head of the raw cacao products coming into\r\nGermany, with 239,756 cwts., and have pushed Accras down to second\r\nplace, this variety having failed to maintain its 1909 lead, for 1910\r\ndid not add more than 6,496 cwts. to its previous total of 199,686\r\ncwts. Bahias came third, then as now, with 128,760 cwts. This order has\r\nnot always remained constant, but has suffered considerable deviations\r\nin progressive years. We give below a table showing the chief cacao\r\nproducing lands and their imports into Germany between 1900 and 1908.\r\n\r\n~Table~ 2. =Imports in Germany in tons.=\r\n\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n              | 1900 | 1901 |  1902  | 1903 | 1904 |\r\n  ————————————+——————+——————+————————+——————+——————+\r\n  Brit.

We give the following table (3) to indicate its\r\nprogress between the years 1901 and 1908, and to facilitate comparison.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind, when making use of this table (specially in\r\nconnection with Germany) that the falling off in the years 1907-8 is to\r\nbe attributed to the abnormally bad harvests and consequent increase in\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n~Table~ 3. =Import or Consumption in the Various Lands in tons.=\r\n\r\n  ————————————————-+————————-+————————-+————————-+————————-+\r\n                   |  1901   |  1902   |  1903   |  1904   |\r\n  =================+=========+=========+=========+=========+\r\n  The United States|         |         |         |         |\r\n   of North America|2066595·8|2312072·8|2850808·2|3216415·6|\r\n  Germany          |1841000·0|2060170·0|2163440·0|2710140·0|\r\n  France           |1791650·0|1934300·0|2074150·0|2179450·0|\r\n  England          |1890800·0|2038600·0|1868119·2|2054250·4|\r\n  Holland          |1437300·0|1466627·4|1073047·4|1218440·0|\r\n  Spain            | 593107·7| 925997·6| 602675·2| 581635·9|\r\n  Switzerland      | 436330·0| 570700·0| 585650·0| 683910·0|\r\n  Belgium          | 186548·7| 227763·3| 276779·1| 279200·8|\r\n  Austria-Hungary  | 168650·0| 182010·0| 203460·0| 251010·0|\r\n  Russia           |   —     |   —     | 190068·0| 205570·0|\r\n\r\n  ————————————————-+————————-+————————-+————————-+————————-\r\n                   |  1905   |  1906   |  1907   |  1908\r\n  =================+=========+=========+=========+=========\r\n  The United States|         |         |         |\r\n   of North America|3523164·5|3794857·5|3752650·5|4261529·3\r\n  Germany          |2963310·0|3526050·0|3451540·0|3435190·0\r\n  France           |2174760·0|2340380·0|2318030·0|2044450·0\r\n  England          |2119071·2|2013204·0|2015947·2|2105152·0\r\n  Holland          |1073740·0|1122400·0|1221924·9|1582100·0\r\n  Spain            | 610171·2| 563682·1| 562823·9| 658011·3\r\n  Switzerland      | 521840·0| 646690·0| 712420·0| 582050·0\r\n  Belgium          | 301899·7| 386168·6| 325396·7| 455408·1\r\n  Austria-Hungary  | 266850·0| 331280·0| 347170·0| 370730·0\r\n  Russia           | 222768·0| 267094·0| 247338·0| 258806·0\r\n\r\nThe relative consumption of coffee, tea and cacao has also inclined in\r\nfavour of the latter as far as Germany is concerned. According to the\r\n19th. Report of the Association of German Chocolate Makers, No. 7,\r\nthe imports which passed through the custom-houses of that country, and\r\nintended for consumption, figured at the following in tons; though in\r\nthis connection it is as well to remember that the German ton is about\r\n50 lbs. less than the English.\r\n\r\n                Coffee         Cacao        Tea\r\n             (raw in bean)  (raw in bean)\r\n  1886          12 360·5      3 686·7     1618·5\r\n  1887         101 833·4      4 295·0     1760·0\r\n  1888         114 658·1      4 979·8     1778·4\r\n  1889         113 228·5      5 565·1     1875·0\r\n  1890         118 126·3      6 246·5     1995·0\r\n  1891         125 611·2      7 087·0     2221·0\r\n  1892         122 031·9      7 460·9     2479·0\r\n  1893         122 190·5      7 960·9     2676·0\r\n  1894         122 357·5      8 319·9     2840·0\r\n  1895         122 390·2      9 950·9     2544·0\r\n  1896         129 896·6     12 209·5     2471·0\r\n  1897         136 395·0     14 692·5     2852·0\r\n  1898         153 270·4     15 464·9     3661·9\r\n\r\nFrom the above columns it will be seen that the importation of coffee\r\nhas only increased 24 percent, that of tea 125 percent, but that\r\nof cacao at the surprising rate of 330 percent. A comparison of the\r\ntotals for coffee, tea and cacao in the years 1886, 1898 & 1906 will\r\nmake the proportions still more evident.\r\n\r\n                 1886     1898     1906\r\n                ——————   ——————   ——————\r\n  Coffee         96·0%    89·0%    82·6%\r\n  Cacao           2·8%     8·9%    15·6%\r\n  Tea             1·2%     2·1%     1·8%\r\n                ————————————————————————\r\n      Total     100·0%   100·0%   100·0%\r\n\r\nSo that whilst in the year 1886 thirty-five times as much coffee as\r\ncacao found its way into Germany, the imports for 1898 were ten, and in\r\n1906 only five and a half times greater in the case of the first named\r\narticle. It follows that there has been a corresponding increase as\r\nregards cacao consumption in Germany. A momentary survey of the graphs\r\nin Fig. 5, which we owe to the kindness of Herr Greiert, Managing\r\nDirector of the Association of German Chocolate Manufacturers, will\r\nmake this clear to the reader; and the diagram there illustrates the\r\nrelative growth of cacao consumption in Germany, when compared with\r\nother countries. On calculating the quantity of cacao consumed per\r\nhead of the population, we get a graph (fig. 6) which puts the rapid\r\nincreases in this direction at a glance.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Fig. 5. _Ausgestellt vom Verband deutscher\r\n Chocoladefabrikanten._\r\n\r\n Sitz Dresden\r\n\r\n _Verbrauch von Rohkakao_ 1896-1901\r\n\r\n in _Frankreich_. _Grossbrittanien._ _Holland_ den _Verein.

According\r\nto official reports, the average consumption of cacao per head between\r\nthe years 1861-5 amounted to 0·03 kg. (tea 0·02 kg. and coffee 1·87\r\nkg.) but had in 1910 risen to an average of 0·53 kg. per head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Chemical Constitution of the Bean.\r\n\r\n\r\na) The Cacao Bean Proper.\r\n\r\nJust as the beans of the cacao fruit are included under the botanical\r\nconcept “Seed”, so also their chemical constituents closely resemble\r\nthose common to every other seed. There are the usual reserve stuffs\r\ninherited from the mother plant, which serve as sustenance for the\r\nyet undeveloped organs, and compare with albumen in the feathered\r\nworld. Apart from the constituents incidental to all plant life at\r\nthis stage, such as albumin, starch, water, fat, sugar, cellulose and\r\nmineral stuffs such as ash, the cacao seed has two other components\r\npeculiar to itself; ~Theobromine~ and ~Cacao-red~. We adjoin\r\na succession of chemical determinations respecting the quantitative\r\nproportions of these substances in the seed, and think further that we\r\nmay be allowed to cite the results of fore-time investigators in this\r\nsphere, especially as their work has formed the basis for all future\r\noperations, and again, in view of the doubt which still prevails in\r\nscientific circles as to the “Normal” composition of the cacao bean.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Table~ 4.\r\n\r\nPercentage Composition of the Hulled Bean.\r\n\r\n  =====================+=============+==================================\r\n        Analyst        |   Payen[20] |Lampadius[20]|  Mitscherlich[20]\r\n  =====================+=============+=============+===========+========\r\n  Constituents percent| Undescribed | West Indies | Guayaquil | Caracas\r\n  =====================+=============+=============+===========+========\r\n  1.

10.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing tables provide us with a general idea of the chemical\r\nconstituents of the cacao bean, but their distinctive properties,\r\nboth chemical and physical, still remain to be defined, with which we\r\naccordingly proceed, as such data will on the one hand enable us to\r\ngrasp how loss may be avoided in the manufacture of cacao and chocolate\r\nwares, and at the same time render intelligible familiar processes\r\nconnected therewith.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the following substances occur in cacao in varying\r\namounts:\r\n\r\n  1. Water.\r\n  2. Fat.\r\n  3. Cacao-red.\r\n  4. Theobromine.\r\n  5. Albumen.\r\n  6. Starch.\r\n  7. Cellular tissue or cellulose.\r\n  8. Small percentages of grape and cane sugar.\r\n  9. Mineral or ash stuffs.\r\n\r\nLike the majority of plants and plant products, the cacao bean consists\r\nof vesicles or cells, closed on all sides and arranged in a series\r\nof layers. They are constructed of cellular tissue or cellulose, and\r\ncontain fat, albumen, water, starch, theobromine, cacao pigment,\r\nbesides sugar and salts in inferior quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ~Water or Moisture.~\r\n\r\nThere is present in the bean from 6 to 8 percent of water, a factor\r\nwhich bodes well for the proper germination of the seed, as when this\r\nlatter is deprived of moisture, e. g. in the course of a too thorough\r\ndrying, it speedily decays. Water is still evident in small quantities\r\neven in the largest and almost withered beans, as will be seen on\r\ncomparison of the foregoing analyses.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ~Fat.~\r\n\r\nAs a constituent at the expense of which respiration is effected, fat\r\nremains one of the most important resources of plant. It has a twofold\r\nexcellence in this connection, and firstly as a highly calorifacient\r\nand carboniferous substance, and again because such a reserve enables\r\nthe living organism to oxidise with particular ease, wherefore it is\r\nfound accumulated in somewhat significant measure in the majority\r\nof seeds. When seen under the microscope it appears either as round\r\ncoherent masses, or as crystalline aggregates clearly distinguishable\r\nfrom the rest of the cell contents on treatment with a solution of\r\nosmic acid. The fat in the cacao bean usually amounts to from 50-56\r\npercent, or one half of the total weight of the shelled beans; the shell\r\nalso contains from 4 to 5 percent of fat.[25] The unfermented bean has\r\nfrequently, in addition to its bitter taste, a most unpleasant flavour,\r\nattributable to the rancidity of its fatty contents.\r\n\r\nThe raw bean contains rather more fat than the roasted bean, for\r\nwhilst the one averages from 50 to 55 percent, there is seldom more\r\nthan 48-52 percent in the other. The cause of this phenomenon may\r\nbe connected with the enrichment of the shells in fat, and in some\r\ninstances, as when the beans are over-roasted, is to be ascribed to\r\nthe chemical change which the play of burning heat on fatty bodies\r\ninvolves, when a destructive decomposition of the whole ensues, with\r\nformations of acroleine. Chemically considered, cacao butter consists\r\nof a mixture of so-called esters, or compounds connected with ether,\r\nsuch as the glycerides of fatty acids, and contains, in addition to\r\nstearine, palmatine, and laurine[26], the glyceride of arachidic acid.\r\nIt was also formerly supposed that formic, acetic and butyric acids\r\nwere among the constituents of this ingredient, but the view has\r\nbeen proved erroneous by Lewkowitsch[27]; similarly, the presence of\r\ntheobromic acid alleged by Kingzett[28] has been called into question\r\nby Graf.[29]\r\n\r\nCacao butter is a fairly firm fat of pleasant taste and smell, which\r\nvaries in colour between yellowish white and yellow. When freshly\r\nexpressed, it has frequently a brownish shade, passing after a short\r\ntime into a pale yellow, and turning almost white on long keeping. The\r\nbrown colour is due to pigment in suspension, which becomes sediment\r\nin the course of melting, when the butter asumes a normal colour,\r\nreferrible to pigment dissolved in the butter oils, and secondarily\r\nto a dissolution of the products of roasting in these liquids, rather\r\nthan to any matter in suspension. The pleasant smell and taste of cacao\r\nbutter is probably closely allied to the dissolved substances mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe fat extracted from cacao by solvents differs essentially from that\r\nobtained by hydraulic pressure, a fact overlooked in some of even the\r\nmost recent experiments, and which therefore cannot be too strongly\r\nemphasised. Extracted fat is yellowish white, sometimes approximating\r\nto grey, and after having been kept a long time, the whole becomes\r\ntinged with an actual whiteness, which first attacks the outer surface,\r\nand then rapidly progresses towards the centre in concentric paths,\r\nand which is a sign of rancidity. Its fracture is partly granular,\r\nthe smell is not so pronounced as that of expressed fat, being even\r\nunpleasant at times, as in the case of faulty wares (but compare\r\npage), and it has a keen taste. Cacao butter does not, as is generally\r\nsupposed, keep better than other vegetable fats, but is equally liable\r\nto become rancid, as Lewkowitsch[30] demonstrates. By rancidity is\r\ndenoted that state of offensive taste and smell acquired by fatty\r\nsubstances on longer or shorter keeping and especially when they are\r\nnot properly stored. What chemical re-arrangements of the respective\r\nconstituents this state presupposes is very questionable; though\r\nit appears from the experiments of Lewkowitsch[30] and others[31]\r\nthat the formation of acids does not play as prominent a part as the\r\nexperimenter is inclined to think, nothwithstanding the marked increase\r\nin quantity which may occur. The primary cause of rancidity will rather\r\nbe found in the oxidation products of the glycerine contained in all\r\nfats.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of cacao butter varies considerably, according\r\nas it has been expressed or extracted by means of solvents. White[32]\r\nasserts that it can only be determined when the liquefied oil has\r\nbeen solidified several days. According to Rammsberger the specific\r\ngravity of expressed butter is 0·85; that of butter extracted by\r\ntreatment with ether figures at 0·958. Hager gives the normal specific\r\ngravity of fresh cacao butter at 15° C. as from 0·95 to 0·952; stale\r\nbutter 0·945 to 0·946, and the same figures have been confirmed by\r\nother investigations, though Dietricht gives 0·98 to 0·981 at 100° C.\r\nThe melting point is generally regarded as 33° C.; there is in this\r\nrespect, however, a great difference between the two descriptions of\r\nfat. Expressed fat which has been kept for some length of time melts\r\nbetween 34° C. and 35° C., and these figures remain constant, so that\r\nit is advisable to read the melting point of fat which has been in\r\nstore some time rather than that of the fresh pressed product, and take\r\nthis as a standard. All other fat shows a lower melting point.\r\n\r\nAs the melting point of freshly melted cacao butter shows considerable\r\nfluctuation, the liquid fat must be kept in darkness and cooled with\r\nice for about a week, and the reading should not be taken before the\r\nexpiration of this time, as only then is it possible to obtain any\r\ndefinite and final result.\r\n\r\nExperiments on the melting point of cacao butter as carried out by\r\nZipperer under special conditions yielded the following values; cf.\r\nalso Table 12.\r\n\r\n    Kind of bean           Melting      Centigrade\r\n                          point raw      roasted\r\n  Machala Guayaquil         34·5           34·0\r\n  Caracas                   33·5           34·0\r\n  Ariba                     33·75          31·5\r\n  Port au Prince            34·25          33·8\r\n  Puerto Cabello            33·50          33·0\r\n  Surinam                   34·20          34·0\r\n  Trinidad                  34·00          34·0\r\n\r\nWhite and Oldham[33] give the following melting points:\r\n\r\n  Guayaquil                 33·6-33·9\r\n  Granada                   33·0-33·3\r\n  Trinidad                  31·5-32·5\r\n  Caracas                   33·0-33·6\r\n  Ceylon                    33·9-34·2\r\n\r\nFilsinger and Henking found[34]:\r\n\r\n  Cauca                     32·1-32·4\r\n  Bahia                     32·7-33·4\r\n  Porto Plata               33·1-33·6\r\n\r\nThese results vary somewhat, but the differences are to be ascribed\r\nto the methods employed and to the manner in which the observations\r\nof different experimenters are carried out. Generally it may be taken\r\nthat the melting point should not be under 3° or over 35°C. The fat\r\nsolidifies between 21·5° and 23° C. (solidifying point). The fatty\r\nacids from the fat melt at 48°-52° C.; they begin to solidify at 45°\r\nC., the solidifying ending generally at 51°-52° C. (see table 12).\r\n\r\nAdulteration of cacao fat, as many experiments have shown, cannot be\r\ndetected simply by deflections in the melting point. Björklund’s ether\r\ntest,[35] which is very suitable for the detection of an admixture of\r\nextraneous substances like tallow, wax and paraffin, is carried out as\r\ndescribed in paragraph....\r\n\r\nCacao fat, like all other fats, is saponified by alkalis, that is\r\nto say, forms a soap or a chemical compound of the fatty acids with\r\nalkalis such as potash, soda, ammonia etc. On the addition of a mineral\r\nacid to the soap a salt of the mineral acid and alkali is formed, with\r\nthe separation of the fatty acid. The fatty acids are of two kinds:\r\n\r\n1. The volatile acids or those which are volatile at 100°-110° C. or\r\nmore easily with steam than other vapours. These usually exist only\r\nin very small quantity in cacao fat but may considerably increase in\r\namount in the fat obtained from imperfectly fermented beans.[36]\r\n\r\n2. The solid fatty acids are such as are fixed, and do not act in the\r\nmanner above mentioned: cacao butter consists chiefly of the glycerides\r\nof these acids.\r\n\r\nBjörklund’s tests will only detect, as has been stated, admixtures of\r\nwax, paraffin, tallow and bodies of a relatively high melting point.\r\nAnother method must therefore be adopted to detect fat of low melting\r\npoints, as cocoa-nut fat, or liquid oils like cotton seed and sesame\r\noils. The methods in use in connection with cacao butter are the\r\n~determination~ of the ~iodine~, ~saponification~ and\r\n~acid values~, finding the ~melting point~ of the ~fatty\r\nacids~, the ~Reichert-Meissl number~, and by means of Zeiss’\r\nbutyro-refractometer, its ~refractive index~.\r\n\r\nThe iodine value indicates the amount of iodine percent absorbed by\r\nthe fat, and is accordingly a measure of the unsaturated fatty acids.\r\nAs these latter differ in amount in vegetable and animal fats, though\r\nconstant for each separate kind, it is possible by means of this iodine\r\nvalue to recognise a genuine cacao fat and to detect adulteration.\r\nThe determination of the iodine value is carried out by Hulbl’s[37]\r\nmethod, and according to Filsinger,[38] it is advisable to let\r\nthe iodine solution act on the fat for from ten to twelve hours in\r\ndiffused daylight. Before determining the iodine value in cacao fat,\r\nsays Welmans[39] this substance should be dried at from 100-105°C. to\r\nexpel the acroleine produced by too high roasting, at the same time\r\navoiding too high a temperature, as acroleine can then be very easily\r\nreproduced. Filsinger has determined the iodine value of many varieties\r\nof cacao butter with the following results:\r\n\r\n    ~Kind~:        ~Iodine value~:\r\n  Cauca               36·2-36·7\r\n  Bahia               36·8-37·1\r\n  Porto Plata         36·6-36·9\r\n  Ariba               35·1-36·8\r\n\r\nGenuine cacao butter shows an average iodine value of from 33-37·5.[40]\r\n\r\nThe ~saponification value~ or ~Köttstorfer’s number~[41]\r\nexpresses the number of milligrammes of potassium hydrate required for\r\nthe complete saponification of 1 gramme of fat, or in other words, the\r\namount of potassium hydrate necessary to the saponification of the fat\r\nin thents percent. Filsinger[42] gives the amount as between 192 and\r\n202 in genuine cacao butter, although it usually fluctuates between 194\r\nand 195. Its determination is the means of detecting adulterations with\r\ncocoa-nut butter and its preparations.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the ~acid~ value has lately become of\r\nimportance, especially since the introduction of the so-called Dutch\r\nHa cacao or shell butter, which is obtained from cacao refuse and is\r\noften rancid. This value or number expresses the amount of potassium\r\nhydrate necessary to neutralise the free fatty acids in 1 gramme of\r\nfat, and it is therefore a measure of the amount of free fatty acid.\r\nAs this constant has been variously stated, according to the methods\r\nadopted (Burstyn, Merz), the fact must be taken into account when\r\ncomparing the literature on the subject. As the constants have been\r\ndetermined by two different methods (Merz, Burstyn), this must be\r\ntaken into consideration when comparing the various data on the acid\r\nvalue of fats. Whilst the “Vereinbarungen” (No. 1, 1897) in a chapter\r\non “Food Fats and Oils” still recognise two distinct methods in the\r\ndetermination of free fatty acids, as well as two different ways of\r\nrecording the results (degree of acidity and free acid, calculated on\r\nthe oily acids) there occurs in the supplement to the recent margarine\r\ncode for Germany issued by the Chancellor on April 1st. 1898, entitled\r\n“Instructions for chemical research in fats and cheeses” under c)\r\na dictum that there is only one absolute and precise procedure in\r\nthe “Determination of free fatty acids (degree of acidity) These\r\ncalculations are based on the Burstyn method, which we accordingly\r\nannex, more especially as it is now in universal use. It should be\r\nobserved that the method of preparation and the age of the beans, as\r\nwell as that of the fat all tend to increase the acid value.\r\n\r\nThe Reichert Meissl value expresses the percentage value of the\r\nvolatile fatty acids present in the fat; as already mentioned, they\r\namount to 1·6 ccm, in cacao fat extracted by solvents. Milk chocolate,\r\nsays Welmans, yields a fat having a Reichert-Meissl value of 2·5, but\r\ncompare page....\r\n\r\nThe determination of the ~refractive index~ in Zeiss\r\nbutyrorofractometer is of value for ascertaining the purity of cacao\r\nbutter, and it serves as a control on the iodine value, for according\r\nto Roques[43] the refractive index and the iodine value stand in equal\r\nrelation, so that fat having a high refractive index gives a high\r\niodine value and vice versa. The refractive index of cacao butter\r\nranges between 1·4565-1·4578 at 40°C. corresponding to 46-47·8 on the\r\nscala of the Zeiss butyro-refractometer. The use of the latter is\r\nrecommended by Filsinger as a preliminary test for cacao butter, since\r\nwith a normal refraction it is not necessary to proceed further and\r\ndetermine the iodine, saponification and acid values, nor the melting\r\npoint. In conclusion we annex table 12, where the respective constants\r\nfor different varieties of cacao butter will be found tabulated.[44]\r\n\r\nFor further information on all these methods, the reader is referred\r\nto the excellent work of R.

It is commercially known as Dutch IIa or artificial\r\ncacao butter, and cannot be obtained like the fat of the kernel by\r\nmechanical means, but is obtained by some cheap solvent like benzene.\r\nThe traces of benzene are very difficult to hide, and consequently\r\nthis shell butter has little commercial value and its manufacture is\r\nunremunerative.\r\n\r\nFilsinger[45] gives the iodine value of shell butter as higher than\r\nthat of kernel butter, and fixes it between 39 and 40: its acid value,\r\nespecially if the fat is rancid, can reach 50-60° Burstyn, i. e. 50\r\nto 60 ccm. normal alkali for 100 grammes of fat.[46] If the free acid\r\nof shell butter be counteracted with sodium or magnesium carbonate,\r\nthe neutral fat then has the normal iodine value of pure cacao butter,\r\nnamely 36·5. In a sample giving an abnormally high iodine value it\r\nis always necessary to determine the acid value, and if the latter\r\nbe too high, the fatty acids must be removed, when if the sample be\r\nunadulterated, the normal iodine value will be obtained. It may be\r\nnoted in passing that the high acid values occurring in shell butter\r\nmay be due in part to the acidity of the benzene employed as a solvent.\r\n\r\nCacao butter has a considerable commercial value, and is consequently\r\nliable to adulteration with many inferior fats of vegetable origin.\r\nAmong these are especially beef and mutton tallow, the purified\r\nfatty acids of palm-nut oil, wax, paraffin, stearic acid, dicka fat\r\n(nucoa butter, possibly) and cocoa-nut fat, as well as the numerous\r\npreparations of the last named, variously known in commerce as Mannheim\r\ncocoa-nut butter, vegetaline, lactine, finest plant butter, chocolate\r\nbutter, laureol vegetable butter, palmin, kunerol etc. Other but less\r\ncommoner are the sesame cotton-seed, arachidic, margarine and hazelnut\r\noils.\r\n\r\nFor the detection of these and similar adulterates, the reactions and\r\nanalytical methods described are all-sufficient. Benedict[47] discovers\r\nthat the presence of wax and paraffin considerably diminishes the\r\nsaponification value, cocoa, nut fat increases it and lowers the iodine\r\nvalue, whereas stearic acid raises the acid value.\r\n\r\n  ================+==========+===========+=========+============+\r\n                  | Melting  |  Melting  |         |  Saponif-  |\r\n                  |  point   | Point of  |  Iodine |  ication   |\r\n                  |          |fatty acids|  value  |   value    |\r\n                  |   °C.    |    °C.    |         |            |\r\n  ================+==========+===========+=========+============+\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Cacao butter    |  30-34·5 |   48-52   |  34-37·5|  192-202   |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Oil of Almonds  |    —     |     14    | 93-101·9|189·5-195·4 |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Sesame oil      |    —     |   26-30   |106·4-109|  187-192   |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Earth-nut       |          |           |         |            |\r\n   (Arachis) oil  |    —     |   27-31   |  92-101 |  190-197   |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Hazelnut oil    |    —     |   17-25   | 83·2-88 |191·4-197·1 |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Cotton-seed oil |    —     |   38-40   | 106-111 |  191-197   |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Oleo-margarine  |32·4-32·5 |     42    |43·8-48·5| 195-197·4  |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Beef tallow     |  43-49   |   43-46   |35·4-36·5| 193·2-198  |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Wax             |  62-64   |     —     | 8·0-11  |  97-107    |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Paraffin        |  38-82   |     —     | 3·9-4   |    —       |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Stearic acid    | 71-71·5  |     —     |    —    | 195-200    |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Sebin           |37·6-37·8 |     —     |43·7-43·8|192·4-192·6 |\r\n                  |          |           |         |            |\r\n  Cocoa-nut fat   | 20-28    |   24-25   |   8-9   |254·8-268·4 |\r\n                  | chiefly  |           |         |            |\r\n                  |26·2-26·4 |           |         |            |\r\n\r\n  ================+=========+============\r\n                  |         | Refractive\r\n                  | Acid    |  index\r\n                  | value   | in Zeiss’s\r\n                  |         | butyrometer\r\n  ================+=========+============\r\n                  |         |   46-47·8\r\n  Cacao butter    |9·24-17·9|  at 40° C.\r\n                  |         |\r\n  Oil of Almonds  |    —    |   64-64·8\r\n                  |         |  at 25° C.\r\n  Sesame oil      |    —    |   67-69\r\n                  |         |  at 25° C.\r\n  Earth-nut       |         |\r\n   (Arachis) oil  |    —    | 65·8-67·5\r\n                  |         |  at 25° C.\r\n  Hazelnut oil    |    —    |     —\r\n                  |         |\r\n  Cotton-seed oil |    —    | 67·6-69·4\r\n                  |         |  at 25° C.\r\n  Oleo-margarine  |    —    |   48·6\r\n                  |         |  at 40° C.\r\n  Beef tallow     |    —    |    49\r\n                  |         |  at 40° C.\r\n  Wax             |  19-21  |    —\r\n                  |         |\r\n  Paraffin        |    —    |    —\r\n                  |         |\r\n  Stearic acid    | 195-200 |    —\r\n                  |         |\r\n  Sebin           |    —    |    —\r\n                  |         |\r\n  Cocoa-nut fat   |    —    |   35·5\r\n                  |         | at 40° C.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presence of cocoa-nut fat can also be shown by the etherification\r\nof the fatty acids with alcohol and sulphuric acid, when the\r\ncharacteristic odour of the ester of cocoa-nut acid occurs. Vegetable\r\noils, such as almond, cotton-seed, arachidic, sesame and hazelnut\r\noils, lower the melting point of the fatty acids and raise the iodine\r\nvalue. Sesame oil is easily detected by Baudouin’s reaction, yielding\r\na raspberry coloration whilst pure cacao butter keeps a fine yellow\r\nor dark brown. It is possible to detect the presence of so minute a\r\nquantity as 1% of sesame oil, by means of Baudouin’s reaction.\r\n\r\nThe following table, containing the analytical determinations of all\r\nfatty substances which can possibly be employed in the adulteration of\r\ncacao butter, will serve to facilitate reference to this subject.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its use in the manufacture of certain cacao preparations\r\nand for lubricating parts of machinery which come into contact with\r\nthe cacao etc. cacao fat is also used in perfumery and especially in\r\npharmacy for making suppositaries, ointments, etc., but it is of no\r\nimportance in soap making. As an edible fat, in the true sense of the\r\nword, like ordinary butter or lard, cacao butter is not used. It has\r\nbeen maintained by Benedikt[48] that when in the form of chocolate\r\nit is as easily digestible in the human organism as milk fat, which\r\nis generally regarded as offering most favourable conditions for\r\nabsorbtion in the intestinal canal. The digestibility of both fats\r\nvaries from 92·3 to 95·38 percent, and both, in this respect, stand\r\nvery near to cocoa-nut fat from which the solid glycerides have been\r\nremoved, and to ordinary butter, the former according to Bourot and\r\nJean.[49] being digestible to the extent of 98 and the latter 95·8\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nCacao butter is obtained as a by-product in the preparation of cocoa\r\npowder and in every country where cocoa powder is produced there\r\nis always a large trade in the former article. That is, apart from\r\nGermany, especially the case in Holland, where the monthly supply to\r\nthe Amsterdam market is so large that during 1899 one firm alone—Van\r\nHouten—had 855 tons for sale. The average price of late years has\r\nconsiderably increased, and is now about 64-73 cents per kilogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ~Cacao-red or Pigment.~\r\n\r\nThe majority of investigators interested in the cacao bean have\r\nassigned its peculiar aroma and taste to the cacao-red which it\r\ndevelops. As previously pointed out, the young fresh bean is\r\ncolourless, the pigment forming later, as can be observed in many\r\nvegetable colouring materials, such as oakand cinchona-red, madder,\r\nindigo and kola-nut red (from Sterculia acuminata). As the later\r\ninvestigations of Hilger[50] have shown, the fresh colourless cacao\r\nbean contains a diastasic ferment, as well as a glucoside body, which\r\nC. Schweitzer[51] has termed glocoside or cacaonin. The term glucoside\r\nmay be noted in passing as including those bodies, the greater number\r\nof which occur in plants, and which by treatment with alkalis, acids\r\nor ferments are split up into an indifferent body and a sugar,\r\ngenerally glucose. These bodies may be chemically regarded as ethyl\r\nderivatives of the respective sugars. When the ripe, white seeds are\r\ndried, the cacao-glycoside is partly decomposed by the agency of the\r\nabove-mentioned diastasic ferment and formations of grape sugar, pure\r\nnon-nitrogenous cacao-red, together with theobromine and coffeine\r\nensue. These substances, and likewise a certain amount of undecomposed\r\ncacao glycoside, can all be detected in the seed, which has by this\r\ntime acquired a brownish to violet colour.\r\n\r\nThe unfermented bean, according to Schweitzer, has as much as 0·6%\r\nunaltered glucoside. Fermentation produces the same effect as drying,\r\nas here again the glycerine is not completely split up, for the\r\ncacao-red, isolated in the ordinary way, consists according to Hilger\r\nof a mixture of pure non-nitrogenous cacao-red and some glycoside.\r\n\r\nThe complete decomposition of the cacao glycoside can only be effected\r\nin a chemical manner, by boiling the finely divided and defatted seeds\r\nwith dilute acids, a method which has made it possible to effect an\r\nexact determination of the diureides, as the treatment with acid sets\r\nfree the totality of their theobromine and coffeine.\r\n\r\nSchweitzer regards the molecule of cacao glycoside as an ester\r\ncomprised of one molecule of non-nitrogenous cacao-red, six molecules\r\nof starch-sugar and one molecule of theobromine with double-sided\r\nattachment and having the hypothetrical formula C_{60}H_{86}O_{15}N_{4}.\r\n\r\nBefore the appearance of Hilger’s researches, all statements of a\r\nchemical nature respecting cacao-red related to a mixture of a pure\r\nnon-nitrogenous pigment and the glycoside, which must in all cases be\r\npreliminarily obtained, before the pure pigment can be prepared. That\r\ncan be done[52] by treating the roasted beans with petroleum ether,\r\nwhich removes the fat and part of the free theobromine then with water,\r\nto extract the remaining theobromine, coffeine, sugar and salts,\r\nand finally with alcohol, to extract the cacao-red. The alcoholic\r\nresidue is then quickly dried on porous plates. The material thus\r\nobtained is a reddish brown amorphous bitter powder, which is scarcely\r\nsoluble in water, easily so in alcohol or in dilute alkali, and is\r\nreprecipitated by acid from its alkaline solution. It gives a sublimate\r\nof theobromine when heated. When the substance is ~distilled with\r\n5 percent of sulphuric acid, the added glycoside is completely\r\ndecomposed into sugar, theobromine and the real cacao-red~, which\r\nlatter is represented by the formula C_{17}H_{12}(OH)_{10}. It appears\r\nto stand in near relation to tannin, which it resembles in yielding\r\nformic acid, acetic acid, and pyrocatechin by the action of caustic\r\nalkalis. The pure non-nitrogenous cacao-red, at present, is of\r\nexclusively scientific interest; for practical purposes only the crude\r\ncacao-red, cacao-red glycoside, as naturally existing in the bean, is\r\nof importance. The better and the more effectual the manner in which\r\nthe beans have been prepared by fermentation, the more intense is the\r\nformation of the cacao red, especially its localisation in the cells\r\nand cell tissues. This is the reason that the variations in colour of\r\ndifferent kinds of bean and the aqueous extracts which they yield are\r\nso distinct.\r\n\r\nEspecially is this noticeable in carelessly dried beans, in which\r\nthe cotyledon tissue is of a dirty brown or yellow colour instead of\r\nbeing brown or violet; the pigment here is not restricted to separate\r\ncells but has the appearance of having penetrated into the contiguous\r\nalbuminous cells. The bean contains 2·6-5 percent of the crude\r\ncacao-red; it is soluble in alcohol and in ether and partly so in hot\r\nwater, and is completely extracted from the bean by weak acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe crude cacao-red can be determined quantitatively by precipitating\r\nits solution with lead acetate, decomposing the lead precipitate with\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen and evaporating the filtrate containing the\r\ncacao-red to dryness.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous extract of the beans, which contains the cacao-red, is\r\ncoloured greenish brown by alkalis, red by acids; acetates give a\r\ngrey to yellowish colour; tincture of iodine, stannous chloride and\r\nmercurous nitrate give a rose to brown precipitate. Iron and copper\r\nsalts produce grey precipitates which gradually become brown to black.\r\nGelatine solution, containing alum, and albumin give copious yellow\r\nprecipitates.\r\n\r\nStains produced on linen by the colouring matter of cacao-red can\r\nbe removed by treatment with hot water and finally bleaching with a\r\nsolution of sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. ~Theobromine.~\r\n\r\nAll those materials which are regarded as stimulants, like coffee, tea,\r\ncacao, tobacco etc., owe their action to peculiar nerve stimulating\r\nbodies, which are present only in small quantity in the seeds or leaves\r\nof the respective plants and are termed by chemists alkaloids and\r\ndiureides.\r\n\r\nThe physiologically active constituents of tea, coffee and cacao are\r\nconsidered, even up to to-day, by many authors as alkaloids or organic\r\nbases and especially ranked among the xanthine or purine bases. Recent\r\ninvestigations, however, separate these substances from the alkaloids\r\nin the strict sense and comprise them within a particular group of\r\nurea derivatives under the designation of ureides; the ureides of tea,\r\ncoffee and cacao representing two molecules of urea, they are to be\r\nqualified as “diureides\r\n\r\nA bitter substance in the cacao bean had already been observed by\r\nSchrader, but Woscressensky[53] in 1841 was the first to isolate the\r\ndiureide, theobromine.\r\n\r\nTheobromine is found in the unfermented and fermented beans in two\r\nforms; as free theobromine, which has been eliminated from the\r\nglucoside by the ferment in the drying and fermenting processes, and in\r\ncombination with glucose and cacao-red as a glucoside, from which it\r\ncan only be separated by chemical means.\r\n\r\nTheobromine stands in near relation to caffeine, the diureide of tea\r\nand coffee, as will be seen from their chemical formulae—in which\r\ntheobromine is shown to contain one methyl group CH_{3}, less, its\r\nplace being taken by an hydrogen atom;\r\n\r\n            Caffeine                           Theobromine\r\n   ____________/\\____________          ______________/\\______________\r\n  /                          \\        /                              \\\r\n  C_{5}HN_{2}O_{3}(CH_{1})_{3},       C_{5}H_{2}N_{2}O_{3}(CH_{1})_{2},\r\n\r\nso that in all, theobromine falls short of caffeine by only one\r\nradical. Strecker[54] was the first to show the relation between\r\nthe two substances, when he succeeded in converting caffeine into\r\ntheobromine by the action of methyl oxide on silver theobromine for 24\r\nhours at 100° C. Caffeine and silver iodide are then formed and can\r\nbe separated by treatment with alcohol, which dissolves the caffeine,\r\nleaving the silver iodide undissolved.\r\n\r\nE. Fischer[55] was shown the relation of theobromine and caffeine to\r\nuric acid by artificial synthesis of both substances from derivatives\r\nof both. Fischer, starting with monomethyl pseudo-uric acid, converted\r\nit into 7-methyl uric acid by distilling it with hydrochloric acid, and\r\nafterwards, by treating the lead salt of the latter with methyl iodide\r\nand ether, produced 3-7-methyl-uric acid. That acid was converted into\r\ndimethyldioxychlor-purine by treatment with a mixture of phosphorus\r\noxychloride and phosphoric penta-chloride, with subsequent reduction\r\ninto 3-7 dimethyl-6-amino-2-oxy-purine, from which, by the action of\r\nnitrous acid with loss of the amine group, theobromine was finally\r\nobtained. The synthesis of theobromine is a brilliant exploit of\r\nFischer’s, and it is quite possible that at no distant period, when a\r\nsimple and cheap method of production has been arrived at, synthetical\r\ntheobromine will appear commercially as a rival of the natural product.\r\nAt present there is no prospect of this being immediately realised,\r\nand cacao shells from which theobromine is now prepared are as yet in\r\nno danger of displacement by the new substitute, but still serve as a\r\nuseful by-product in the manufacture of cacao.\r\n\r\nTheobromine and caffeine, like the alkaloids or plant bases, have a\r\ndistinct physiological and even toxic action if taken in too large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nFrom the experiments of Mitscherlich it appears that theobromine has a\r\nsimilar action to caffeine, but is somewhat less active owing to its\r\nbeing less soluble in the gastric juice. Mitscherlich’s experiments\r\nwith frogs, pigeons and rabbits show that 0·05 grammes killed a frog in\r\n40 hours, 0·05 grammes a pigeon in 24 hours, and 1 gramme a rabbit in\r\nless than 20 hours. Death resulted in all cases from cramping of the\r\nspinal cord, producing either convulsions or subsequent paralysis.\r\n\r\nThe results of these experiments do not detract from the nutritive\r\nvalue of cacao, since the human organism requires ten times as much\r\ntheobromine as rabbits to exhibit the slightest toxic symptom; in\r\ncacao mass containing 1 % not mentioned in discussion; just a head’s\r\nup to PP for S&R] theobromine, that would involve the consumption of\r\n5 lbs. averdupois of chocolate at once, a practical impossibility.\r\nSimilar conditions prevail in connection with the use of tea, coffee,\r\nand especially tobacco, where symptoms of poisoning have been\r\noccasionally noticed (the nicotine peril of excessive smokers) but it\r\nwould seem that cacao and chocolate are the most favourably placed of\r\nthese stimulants as regards such toxic action. It appears from the\r\nexperiments of Albanese[56] Bondzynski, Gottlieb[57] and Rost[58] that\r\n3 percent of the theobromine administered passed out in the urine\r\nunaltered, whilst on the other hand 20-30 percent of that decomposed\r\nin the organism is found again as monomethyl-xanthine.\r\n\r\nThe larger proportion of the monomethyl xanthine is heteroxanthine (=\r\n7 Methyl-X) and the inferior 3 Methyl-X. The excretion of theobromine\r\nappears to be closely connected with the quantity of urine voided,\r\nwhich is especially increased by the administration of theobromine.\r\nSince 1890, as a result of W. v. Schröder’s[59] observations in 1888,\r\nthat property of theobromine has had an extended application in\r\npractical therapeutics; theobromine has been used as a diuretic in\r\nkidney diseases, and, unlike all similar medicinal agents, it exercises\r\nno influence on the heart, a circumstance which essentially increases\r\nits therapeutic value. It can be employed for medicinal purposes,\r\neither uncombined or in the form of salicylate, acetate and certain\r\ndouble compounds, as sodium or lithium and theobromine salicylate or\r\nacetate.\r\n\r\nThe double compounds known as diuretin, agurin and uropherin are freely\r\nsoluble in water and are therefore more readily absorbed into the\r\nsystem than pure theobromine, which is only with difficulty soluble in\r\nwater. Through the establishment of theobromine as a medicinal agent,\r\nfor which we are indebted to Chr. Gram[60] and G. See,[61] cacao husks,\r\nhitherto a waste product in the manufacture of cacao, have become of\r\nvalue for the preparation of theobromine, in which many of the largest\r\nGerman chemical factories are now engaged.\r\n\r\nFluctuations as regards the percentage of theobromine in the beans\r\nare so extraordinary that they can only be ascribed to the lack of\r\nprescribed and definite modes of procedure in fermenting, which\r\nobviously necessitates differences in the resulting products.\r\n\r\nEminger found from 0·88-2·34 percent of theobromine in the examination\r\nof a rather considerable number of commercial kinds of cacao beans and\r\nin the husks 0·76 percent of the diureide: C. C. Keller[62] has also\r\nfound it in the leaves and in the pericarp. Cacao contains 0·05 to 0·36\r\npercent of caffeine.\r\n\r\nTheobromine is a permanent white powder, appears under the magnifying\r\nglass as small, white, prismatic or granular crystals. At first it has\r\nonly a slightly bitter taste, which becomes more intense when it is\r\nkept in the mouth for some length of time; and indeed, the bitter taste\r\nof the cacao bean and its preparations is mostly due to theobromine. It\r\nsublimes at 220 ° C. without melting. This phenomenon explains why the\r\nover roasted bean, that is, the kernel of beans which by accident have\r\nbeen heated to more than 130-150 ° C. is poorer in theobromine than\r\nthe husks. When heated to 310 ° C. theobromine melts to a clear liquid\r\nwhich re-crystallizes on cooling.\r\n\r\nOne part of absolutely pure theobromine dissolves according to Eminger\r\nin 736·5 parts of water at 18 ° C., in 136 parts at 100 ° C. in 5399\r\nparts alcohol (90 %) at 18 ° C. in 440 parts at boiling (90 %) point\r\nand in 818 parts of boiling absolute alcohol. It dissolves in 21000\r\nparts of ether at 17 ° C. in 4856 parts of methyl alcohol at 18 ° C.\r\nin 58·8 parts of chloroform at 18 ° C. and in 2710 parts of boiling\r\nchloroform[63]. Theobromine is partly decomposed by strong alkalis but\r\nby cautious addition of alkalis it forms compounds with them, which,\r\nare readily dissolved by solutions of sodium salicylate, acetate or\r\nbenzoate. These double compounds under the name of diuretin, agurin and\r\nuropherin have lately become of therapeutic value.[64]\r\n\r\nSodium silicate and more particularly trisodiumphosphate according\r\nto Brissemoret[65] are great solvents of theobromine. One and a half\r\nmolecules of the latter salt can dissolve one molecule of theobromine\r\nso that in this way it is possible to prepare a solution of nearly\r\n2 percent. Phenol also dissolves a large quantity of theobromine,\r\naccording to Maupy,[66] who has utilised this property for the\r\ndetermination of theobromine. The defatted cacao preparation is\r\nmoistened with water and extracted with a mixture consisting of 15\r\npercent of phenol and 85 percent of chloroform.\r\n\r\nTheobromine, like caffeine, gives the so called murexide reaction when\r\nevaporated with chlorine water—forming amalic acid—and when a watch\r\nglass previously moistened with a little fluid ammonia is held over the\r\nlast few drops at the end of the operation. The residue thus obtained\r\nhas a violet colour, which serves to distinguish theobromine readily\r\nfrom other plant bases which do not belong to the xanthine group.\r\n\r\nAlthough theobromine is the most valuable constituent of cacao beans,\r\nthe importance attached to a greater or lesser amount in the beans as a\r\ncommercial article was formerly much exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Dragendorff and others have shown that the\r\nvalue of various stimulants like tobacco, coffee and tea, does not\r\nentirely depend on the amount of alkaloid or diureide but partly also\r\non the joint action of all the constituents of those articles, and it\r\nis particularly the aromatic bodies which determine their commercial\r\nvalue. Various kinds of coffee, for example, of inferior commercial\r\nvalue contain considerably more caffeine than the costly Mocca beans.\r\nThe highly prized Havana tobacco ranges lower than the Sumatra kinds in\r\nnicotine content, and the same conclusion with regard to cacao would\r\nprobably be correct. In support of this view, attention may be directed\r\nto the following analyses performed by Wolfram.[67]\r\n\r\n\r\nPercentage of theobromine at 100° C.\r\n\r\n  ================================+========================================\r\n           Description            |              % Theobromine %\r\n  ================================+========+=========+=============+=======\r\n  Caracas                         |        |   1·63  |             |   1·11\r\n  Guayaquil (of considerably less |        |         |             |\r\n    value than the first)         | In the |   1·63  |    In the   |   0·97\r\n  Domingo                         |  bean  |   1·66  |    shells   |   0·56\r\n  Bahia                           |        |   1·64  |             |   0·71\r\n  Puerto Cabello (fine kind)      |        |   1·46  |             |   0·81\r\n  Tabasco                         |        |   1·34  |             |   0·42\r\n                                  |————————+————————-+————————————-+———————\r\n                                  |Average | = 1·56% |             | =0·76%\r\n\r\nExcluding the theobromine in the shells which are not used in the\r\npreparation of cacao, it will be seen from the above table that the\r\nCaracas bean, which is the finest and dearest, has an amount of\r\ntheobromine which is only equal to, or even a little less, than that in\r\nthe inferior beans from Guayaquil and Domingo.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ~Albumin.~\r\n\r\nOn the presence of albuminous bodies in the cacao bean, varying between\r\n14-15 percent, depends to a great extent its nutritive value. The\r\nalbumin in plants, unfortunately, is not to hand in a form suitable\r\nfor direct absorption and assimilation in the animal organism, in\r\nfact, only a fraction of it is so available. Before considering the\r\nnutritive value of the albumin of the cacao bean it will be well to\r\ngive attention to the general chemical and physical properties of\r\nalbumin so far as a knowledge of them will assist in the elucidation of\r\nthe subsequent matter.\r\n\r\nAlbuminous bodies or proteins occur either dissolved in the sap of\r\nplants or in a solid in the protoplasm of plant cells; also in the\r\nform of granular deposits (Aleuron granules[68]). In cacao they are\r\napparently present in the three different conditions.\r\n\r\nThe term vegetable albumen, in its more restricted sense, is meant\r\nto designate a protein substance which is soluble in water and is\r\ncoagulable by heat. The greater part of the proteid which exists in the\r\nseeds and sap of plants and is coagulable by heat, is not albumin but\r\nglobulin, that is to say, it is insoluble in water, though dissolved\r\nby solutions of neutral salts. Whilst many protein substances in\r\naqueous solution require a temperature of 100 ° C. before coagulating,\r\nor becoming insoluble under certain conditions, others coagulate at\r\n65 ° C. Concentrated acetic acid dissolves all albuminous bodies with\r\nthe aid of heat, concentrated nitric acid gives a yellow coloration\r\n(xantoprotein reaction). Albuminous substances are decomposed when\r\nheated to 150 ° C. developing a dark colour, swelling up and evolving\r\nan offensive smell, finally leaving behind a difficultly combustible\r\ncoaly residue.\r\n\r\nGlobulins combine with aqueous solutions of alkalis such as potash,\r\nsoda, ammonia etc. producing alkaline albuminates; with acids they\r\nform acid albuminates or syntonins. Both have the property in common,\r\nthat whilst they are insoluble in pure water, they readily dissolve\r\nin slightly acidulated or alkaline water, as well as in weak saline\r\nsolutions, and are then no longer coagulable by boiling.\r\n\r\nAlbuminous bodies are converted first into albumoses (proteoses), and\r\nthen into peptons by gastric and intestinal digestion or by hydrolytic\r\ndecomposition with acids or alkalis, also by the action of steam under\r\npressure of many atmospheres, as well as by putrefaction. Albumoses,\r\nwith the exception of hetero-albumose, are soluble in water. Peptons\r\ndissolve entirely and in that condition are absorbed by the animal\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nAlbumins are precipitated from their solutions by strong alcohol,\r\nand in that way Zipperer succeeded in precipitating 4·25 percent of\r\nalbumin from the aqueous extract of Trinidad cacao, which corresponds\r\nto about 25 percent of the total amount of albumen in the bean.\r\n\r\nThe results of his investigation have shown that generally more soluble\r\nalbumen is present in the unfermented than in the fermented bean.\r\nConsequently, it would appear that in the finer kinds of cacao beans,\r\nin which very careful fermentation has been carried out, the albumin,\r\nowing to fermentative alteration, is rendered less soluble.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of albumin is still not sufficiently known, despite\r\nthe excellent experiments of E. Fischer on this subject; generally it\r\nis regarded as having the formula:\r\n\r\n  C     52·31-54·33%\r\n  H      7·13- 7·73%\r\n  N     15·49-17·60%\r\n  S      0·76- 1·55%\r\n  O     20·55-22·98%\r\n\r\nAccepting a mean formula corresponding to the above figures as\r\nrepresentation of the albumen (namely C_{72}H_{112}N_{18}SO_{22}),\r\nit becomes possible to obtain a quantitative determination of this\r\nconstituent in the plants in which it is contained. There is, for\r\ninstance, 16 % of nitrogen here. Starting from such a standpoint,\r\nand determining the percentage of Nitrogen contained in a plant, and\r\nmultiplying by 6·25 (i. e. 16 %), the amount of albumen is obtained.\r\nFor further particulars see paragraph 4. The albumen in cacao, as\r\npreviously mentioned, is in the form of globulin, that is, in a less\r\nsoluble form. In cacao preparations which are required for invalids,\r\nespecially those with affections of the stomach, it is important to\r\nhave the albumen in a more readily soluble condition. Various attempts\r\nhave been made with cacao preparations to obtain that result, and\r\nlater on, full illustrations and explanations will be given on this\r\nsubject. First of all, however, it is desirable to consider the\r\nscientific methods employed to ascertain the relative digestibility or\r\nindigestibility of albumen.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stutzer[69] of Bonn has been engaged in determining the\r\naction of digestive ferments of the animal organism on alimentary\r\nsubstances, and has worked out a method by which it is possible to\r\nascertain the proportion of albuminous substances which can be regarded\r\nas digestible.\r\n\r\nThe method depends upon the fact that salivary, gastric and intestinal\r\ndigestion can be artificially imitated in the laboratory. But as the\r\nsalivary secretion only digests starch and is difficult to obtain, malt\r\ndiastase, which serves the same purpose, is used instead. On the other\r\nhand albuminous material is only digested by juices of the stomach and\r\nintestines as fresh obtained from the mucous membranes of the pig or\r\nox. If we suppose an average of 16 percent of total albumen in cocoa\r\npowder, the following results would probably be given by Stutzer’s\r\nmethod:\r\n\r\nOf 16 % of total albumen there are on an average:\r\n\r\n                                             | corresponding to percentage\r\n                                             | of the total mass:\r\n                                             |\r\n           }  7·6% soluble in the stomach    |  47·5% } 65%\r\n           }  2·8% soluble in the intestines |  17·5% }\r\n  Albumen: }  5·6% insoluble                 |  35·0%\r\n           } ——-                             | ———\r\n           } 16·0%                           | 100·0%\r\n\r\nAs shown by the experiments of Forster[70] however, artificial\r\ndigestion does not correctly represent the actual consumption of\r\nnutriment in the human body. ~Forster’s~ experiments, in which\r\ncacao powder was administered to healthy men, gave a much higher value,\r\nin fact, 80 percent of the nitrogenous substance was digested, against\r\n65 percent by Stutzer’s artificial method of digestion. The results\r\nobtained by artificial digestion must therefore be increased in that\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. ~Starch.~\r\n\r\nStarch is one of the most important constituents of cacao, as on\r\nthe starch taken in conjunction with the fat and albumen depends\r\nthe nutritive value of the cacao bean. As previously stated, cacao\r\nstarch is one of the smallest kinds which occur in the vegetable\r\nkingdom; consequently it can easily be distinguished from the starch\r\ngranules of other plants. Owing to their minuteness the concentric\r\nrings showing the stratified structure of the starch granules can\r\nonly be distinguished with difficulty under the microscope. Cacao\r\nstarch consists usually of globular granules, generally separate, but\r\nsometimes in aggregations of two or three. The appearance under the\r\nmicroscope of the starch granules is clearly shown in fig 7, which\r\nrepresents a section of Ariba cacao enlarged 750 times.[71]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n=a= on the above represents the intercellular spaces, =b= the cell\r\nwalls, =c= the starch granules, =d= the fat crystals, those being the\r\ncontents and structural elements of the cacao cell that the microscope\r\nwill at once distinguish.\r\n\r\nCacao starch has the usual properties of ordinary kinds of starch,\r\nnamely:\r\n\r\n1. ~It is gelatinised by hot water~, that is to say, the water\r\npenetrates between the layers of starch granules, separating them\r\nand causing by its penetration a swelling up of the starch whereby\r\na transparent mass know as “starch paste” is produced. It has been\r\nsupposed that cacao starch is less easily gelatinised than the starch\r\nof other plants. According to investigations of Soltsien’s[72], which\r\nZipperer unreservedly endorses, this is not the case, for under certain\r\nessential conditions, cacao starch gelatinises just as readily as other\r\nkinds of starch.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The blue coloration of starch with iodine.~\r\n\r\nThis is said to take place more slowly with cacao than with other\r\nstarches, though we have always found that once the cacao starch\r\nis gelatinised, a blue coloration appears immediately on adding a\r\nsufficiently strong solution of iodine.\r\n\r\nThere are certainly other materials in the cacao bean, such as fat,\r\nwhich by more or less enveloping the starch, prevent access of water\r\nto the starch granules and thus hinder gelatinisation; or again, the\r\nalbumen and cacao-red may exert some retarding influence on the iodine\r\nreaction, ~especially if the iodine solution used is very dilute~.\r\nYet it is impossible to describe the reaction as slow.\r\n\r\nAccording to Soltsien, if a mixture of two parts of cacao bean with\r\none part of calcinated magnesia and water is heated, a clear-filtering\r\ndecoction is obtained, which immediately assumes the blue colour\r\non addition of iodine solution. On neutralising the filtrate with\r\nacetic acid, and adding 3-4 parts of strong alcohol, its starch is\r\nprecipitated.\r\n\r\n~By boiling with dilute acids as well as by the action of ferments\r\nlike the saliva, diastase~ etc., ~starch is converted into starch\r\nsugar~ (~glucose~, ~dextrose~). The empirical formula for\r\nstarch is C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, that for starch sugar is C_{6}H_{12}O_{6},\r\nso that in the conversion one molecule of water is introduced,\r\nwherefore its chemical nature is greatly changed, and especially in\r\nits becoming freely soluble in water. That alteration allows of starch\r\nbeing quantitatively determined, as the dextrose thus produced has the\r\nproperty of reducing an alkaline solution of copper sulphate (known as\r\nFehling’s solution, after the discoverer); that is to say, the copper\r\nsulphate is converted into insoluble red cuprous oxide. As dextrose\r\nalways precipitates a definite amount of cuprous oxide, the quantity of\r\nstarch present can in that way be determined.\r\n\r\nThe chemical determination of starch is only in a limited degree\r\neffectual in the recognition of an admixture of foreign starch in cacao\r\npreparations. If more than 10-15 percent of starch (calculated on the\r\ncrude bean) has been found, then it must be assumed that there has\r\nbeen an admixture of foreign starch, but chemistry affords no means by\r\nwhich foreign starch can be distinguished from the genuine starch of\r\nthe cacao bean. For that purpose the foreign starch must be minutely\r\nobserved under the microscope, which not only serves to detect its\r\npresence, but gives an approximate estimation of the amount present,\r\nand its origin. Great caution should be exercised, or the result may be\r\neasily exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. ~Cellulose or crude fibre.~\r\n\r\nWe have already made the acquaintance of this material as the chief\r\nconstituent of the cell walls and vascular tissues. Recent chemical\r\ninvestigations have shown that it consists of the anhydrides of hexose\r\nand pentose (sugar compounds) incrustated with many impurities, such as\r\ncacao-red, gum, mucilage etc. From a chemical point of view, cellulose\r\nhas the same formula as starch, viz. C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}, or one of its\r\nmultiples represented in formula. One of its chemical properties is\r\nsolubility in ammonio-cupric sulphate, and affinity for alkalis such\r\nas potash, soda, ammonia, causes it to swell when they act on the cell\r\nfibres.\r\n\r\nWeender’s process[73] as worked out by Henneberg is the one usually\r\nadopted for the determination of crude fibre in plants, although\r\nrecently H. Suringar, B. Tollens[74] and more particular König[75] have\r\npointed out that in Weender’s process the so-called pentosan, that is\r\nto say, the sugar-like constituent of the composition C_{5}H_{10}O_{5},\r\nwhich comprises a not inconsiderable portion of the crude fibre,\r\nundergoes a disproportionate alteration, so that the analytical results\r\nthus obtained can by no means give an accurate representation of the\r\namount of cellulose. The crude fibre must therefore be treated in such\r\nmanner as to eliminate the pentosan. For this purpose the various\r\nmethods of König, Matthes and Streitberger have been proposed, to which\r\nwe shall return in Book 4. Filsinger, the meritorious experimenter\r\non the subject of cacao, has by König’s method determined the amount\r\nof crude fibre in a series of different varieties of cacao bean, and\r\nobtained the following results as regards shelled and roasted beans.\r\n\r\n                         percent\r\n   1. Puerto Cabello        5·37\r\n   2. Java                  3·97\r\n   3. Ariba Guayaquil I     4·10\r\n   4. Ariba Guayaquil II    4·07\r\n   5. Machala Guayaquil I   4·43\r\n   6. Para                  4·01\r\n   7. Surinam Guiana        3·01\r\n   8. Bahia                 2·81\r\n   9. Grenada               3·10\r\n  10. Guatemala             3·50\r\n  11. Machala Guayaquil II  3·58\r\n  12. Caracas               3·65\r\n  13. Samana                4·58\r\n  14. St. Thomé A I         4·13\r\n  15. St. Thomé A II        2·95\r\n  16. St. Thomé B           3·15\r\n  17. Haiti                 3·12[76]\r\n\r\nThese new values may be provisionally regarded as normal. From\r\nthese results not only can an idea of the functioning of the cacao\r\nshelling machine be obtained, but also the presence of any occasional\r\nadmixture of husk in cacao preparations may be inferred, since the husk\r\ncontains a great deal more crude fibre than the kernel. Therefore the\r\ndetermination of the crude fibre is an important item in the testing of\r\ncacao preparations, as there is no doubt that the presence of vegetable\r\nsubstances rich in crude fibre can be detected by the increase in the\r\namount of cellulose.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. ~Sugar and plant acids.~\r\n\r\nThe presence of glucose in raw cacao beans was first pointed out\r\nby Schweitzer[77]. The sugar is formed by the action of the cacao\r\nferment on the glucoside cacaonin during the processes of drying and\r\nfermentation. In addition to sugar, malic and tartaric acids have been\r\nobserved. These substances, however, are only of interest to the plant\r\nphysiologist and not to the manufacturer, so it is sufficient merely to\r\nnotice them here in passing.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. ~The mineral or ash constituents.~\r\n\r\nWhen cacao beans are ignited, the constituents of an organic nature are\r\nvolatilised and only the non-volatile or inorganic constituents remain\r\nbehind. These consist of potash, soda, lime, iron magnesia, combined\r\nwith silicic acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid and chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe amount of ash in raw and shelled cacao beans varies from 3-4 %.\r\nTuchen[78] found 2·9-3 %, Trojanowski[79] 2·08-3·93 %, Zipperer[80]\r\n2·7-4 %, L’Hote[81] 2·2-4 %, H. Beckurts[82] 2·20-3·75, J. Hockauf[83]\r\n2·84-4·4 percent. Of those kinds which are now most in use, Ceylon\r\ngave 3·30 percent, Java 3·20 and Kameroon 2·95 percent.

According\r\nto Molisch[85], when sections are cautiously heated on platinum foil,\r\nthese globules are found in the ash. From their number they give a\r\ncharacteristic appearance to the ash of cacao beans, and thus may serve\r\nas a good means of identifying cacao, since they can be detected in the\r\nsmallest quantity of a genuine cacao preparation.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy fact may here be mentioned, namely the presence of a\r\nrather small amount of copper in the ash of cacao beans as well as\r\nthe husks. Duclaux[86] was the first to point out this fact, which\r\nseveral other observers, such as Skalweit[87] and Galippe[88] have also\r\nconfirmed. The amount of copper in the husk varies from 0·02 to 0·025\r\npercent and in the beans from 0·0009-0·004 percent (Duclaux). Copper\r\nin similar amount is found in all kinds of beans and husks, and its\r\npresence is due to the absorption of copper by the plant from the soil,\r\nwhence it gradually accumulates in the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nb) The Cacao Shells.\r\n\r\nMost of the constituents which exist in the cacao kernels are also to\r\nbe found in the husks and the methods for isolating and determining\r\nthem are the same in both cases. The composition of the husk, according\r\nto Laube and Aldendorff[89], is as follows:\r\n\r\n~Table~ 15.\r\n\r\n  Key to Row 1:\r\n         Col 4A = Nitrogenous substance\r\n         Col 6B = Non nitrogenous extractive\r\n  ———————————————+——————+—————+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+—————\r\n                 |Amount|     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n                 | of   |     |     |     |     |Woody|     |\r\n                 |husk  |Water|  4A | Fat |  6B |fibre| Ash | Sand\r\n  ———————————————+——————+—————+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+—————\r\n                 |                    ~Per cent~\r\n  ———————————————+——————+—————+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+—————\r\n  Caracas        | 20·09| 7·74|11·68| 5·99|35·29|12·79| 8·32|18·62\r\n  Guayaquil      |  —   | 9·11|12·94|10·75|47·08|13·12| 6·79| 0·21\r\n  Trinidad       | 14·04| 8·30|15·14| 4·23|46·05|18·00| 7·06| 0·92\r\n  Puerto Cabello | 14·92| 6·40|13·75| 4·38|47·12|14·83| 6·06| 7·46\r\n  Soconusco      | 18·58| 6·48|19·12| 6·48|39·39|15·67| 8·15| 4·71\r\n  Mean           | 16·33| 7·83|14·29| 6·38|45·79|14·69| 7·12| 5·90\r\n\r\n\r\n~Zipperer’s analysis[90] of the unroasted husks gave the following\r\nresults~:\r\n\r\n~Table~ 16.\r\n\r\n  Key to Row 1 abbreviations:\r\n         Col 2 = Surinam        = Surin\r\n         Col 3 = Caracas        = Carac\r\n         Col 4 = Trinidad       = Trini\r\n         Col 5 = Puerto Cabello = P Cab\r\n         Col 6 = Machala        = Mach\r\n         Col 7 = Port au Prince = P a P\r\n\r\n  ————————————————————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+—————\r\n                       |Surin|Carac|Trini|P Cab|Mach |P a P|Ariba|Mean\r\n  ————————————————————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+—————\r\n                       |                  ~Per cent~\r\n  ————————————————————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+————-+—————\r\n  Moisture             |13·02|11·90|13·09|12·04|  —  |  —  |  —  |12·51\r\n  Fat                  | 4·17| 4·15| 4·74| 4·00|  —  |  —  |  —  | 4·23\r\n  Cacao tannic acid    |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n   soluble in 80%      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n   alcohol             | 5·10| 3·80| 4·87| 9·15|  —  |  —  |  —  | 4·58\r\n  Theobromine          | 0·33| 0·30| 0·40| 0·32|  —  |  —  |  —  | 0·33\r\n  Ash                  | 7·31|16·73| 7·78| 8·99|  —  |  —  |  —  |10·20\r\n  Woody fibre          |14·85|17·99|18·04|15·98|  —  |  —  |  —  |16·71\r\n  Nitrogen             |  —  | 2·25| 2·13| —   |  —  |  —  |  —  | 2·19\r\n  Proportion of husk   |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n    in the raw seeds   |14·60|15·00|14·68|12·28|16·14|16·00|18·68|15·34\r\n\r\n\r\nRoasted cacao husks contain according to G.

Laube and\r\nAldendorff, for instance, found 14-20 percent, while Zipperer obtained\r\n12-18 percent of husks.\r\n\r\nThese discrepancies are mainly due to adhering sand and ferruginous\r\nearth collected during the drying and fermenting processes. If the\r\nbeans are carefully collected and kept free from earthy substances, the\r\npercentage of husks as against that of the bean will appear much lower;\r\nit is, indeed, now possible to obtain properly treated beans which\r\ncontain on an average only some 10 percent of husks, such as Ariba\r\nand Machala. The husks of these two varieties are exceedingly woody,\r\nand their amount sometimes reaches 15 percent. The latest machinery\r\nfor cleaning the beans effects so complete a separation of the husks\r\nfrom the kernel that very little of the former remains in the finished\r\ncacao preparation (less than 1 percent in thin-shelled beans and no\r\nmore than 2 percent in thick-shelled beans such as Ariba). For some\r\nyears it was not possible to effect so thorough a removal of the husk,\r\nso that there was always found an appreciably large amount of shells\r\nin the finished preparations, which rendered it difficult to detect\r\nadulteration. As, however, the quantity of ash present in the husk is\r\ndouble that in the kernel, it was possible to form an opinion as to\r\nthe intentional admixture of shells from the increase of ash in cacao\r\npreparations. Hence the ash was always required to be determined when\r\nadulteration was suspected. Under existing conditions the addition of a\r\nquantity of shells sufficient to increase the percentage of ash present\r\nin the powder or chocolate is scarcely practicable, so that, for the\r\npurpose of detecting small additions, other methods must be resorted\r\nto, such as the estimation of the crude fibre or silica in the ash[94]\r\nwith the aid of the microscope, in which it is possible to easily\r\ndistinguish the forms of the cotyledon (kernel) mass and those of the\r\nhusk. The diagram on page 14, Fig. 3, clearly shows the elementary\r\nforms of the cacao husk as represented by Mitscherlich. It illustrates\r\na longitudinal section of the husk of Bahia beans, enlarged about\r\n500 times, with six different cell elements in alphabetical order.\r\nFirst the compressed cells of the epidermis are to be seen on the\r\nexterior, in several parallel series and succeeded by moderately broad\r\nand thin-walled cellular tissue of the parenchyma, which sometimes\r\npresents large empty spaces (sch) the results of the loosening of the\r\ncell walls through the formation of mucilage. This cellular tissue\r\n(lp) is also permeated by bundles of spiral vessels (gfb), which, with\r\nthe dry cells, are characteristic of the husk, as they exist only in\r\nvery small quantity in the kernel. Then follow parallel rows of cells\r\n(lp) resembling epithelial cells; next comes a layer of cells with\r\nthick walls, the dry cells (st) and finally several rows of elongated\r\nones (lp). The silver membrane (is) interposes between the husk and\r\nthe kernel, fragments of which remain adhering to the shell after\r\nseparation of the latter.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, we find that the husk of the cacao bean consists of the\r\ninner coat of fruit, called endocarp and other parts of the fruit\r\ncovering, as well as the skin of the seed[95]. The following layers\r\nmay be distinguished;\r\n\r\n 1. The pulp, (f in fig. 3) fragile large cells with frequent hiatus;\r\n\r\n 2. the ~endocarp~ (fe), a single layer of fragile, very narrow\r\n and irregularly arranged cells, but ~without hiatus~;\r\n\r\n 3. the ~epicarp~, or skin (se), polygonal and extended cells,\r\n with an outer wall of some thickness.\r\n\r\n 4. the ~parenchyma~ or cellular tissue (lp), consisting of\r\n large and multiform cells, with vascular bundles (gfb), the large\r\n mucilagenous or slime cells (sch) and\r\n\r\n 5. the ~sklerogenous or dry cells~ (st), a single layer of\r\n vessels shaped like a horseshoe, and thickening towards the interior,\r\n and in conclusion\r\n\r\n 6. the ~silver membrane~ (is), belonging to the earlier inner\r\n coat of fruit, and consisting of two single rows of fat-bearing cells.\r\n\r\nIn examination of the husks of the plane surface enlarged 160 times\r\n(fig. 8), it will be noticed that the characteristic epidermis (ep)\r\nconsists of large and rather elongated but irregular polygonal cells.\r\nFrequently on the epidermis may be remarked a delicate network of\r\nthe cells constituting the fruit pulp (p). Beneath the epidermis\r\nlies a very delicate transverse cellular layer (qu) followed by the\r\nparenchyma, as already stated. The remaining elementary forms are\r\nnot readily observed on a plane surface but only in section, though\r\nwe adjoin a few diagrams, showing the layers as isolated from the\r\npericarp; namely, fig. 9 parenchyma, a layer of sklerogenous cells,\r\nfig. 10, and the silver membrane (is) with two superjacent Mitscherlich\r\nparticles (tr) in fig. 11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nFor microscopical examination, the husk must first be defatted with\r\npetroleum or ordinary ether and then treated with dilute chloral\r\nhydrate (8: 5) to assist the definition of the forms. An approximate\r\nestimation of the amount of husk in a cacao preparation can be made by\r\nmeans of the microscope, adopting Filsinger’s[96] levigation method,\r\nwhich consists of concentrating those elements of the cacao which are\r\nseldom seen even in suspension in water, and which sink to the bottom\r\nwhen repeatedly stirred in that liquid. To these belongs first of all\r\nthe husk, and its presence and determination in the levigation method\r\nis accordingly greatly facilitated. The details of the method will be\r\nfurther described in treating of husk admixtures in cacao preparations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nCacao shells are the only by-product in the cacao industry, and have\r\nbeen developed and exploited to such an extent, that a rational\r\nutilisation of the ever increasing quantities has become a matter of\r\nurgent necessity. They are not used in our industry, for an admixture\r\nof husk is not permissible, even in the inferior kinds of chocolate\r\nor cocoa powder, but must be regarded as an adulteration. It is true\r\nthat they have been brought on the market as cocoa tea, and again,\r\nhave been coated with sugar, to make them tasty; and to this day,\r\ncandied husks constitute a favourite sweetmeat of the population of\r\nEast Germany. But in this way only comparatively inferior quantities of\r\nthe by-product were absorbed, and consequently projects of all kinds\r\nhave been suggested to use up larger percentage. As we have seen, the\r\nfatty contents of the bean can be extracted with benzine, and there\r\nis a resultant 4 or 5 percentage of fat of inferior value, which is\r\ncommercially known as “Dutch IIa Cacao Butter”; the defatted shells can\r\nbe further used for the preparation of theobromine, as Zipperer has\r\nalready noted in the first edition of this book.\r\n\r\nKathreiner’s successors in Munich[97] employ an extract of cacao\r\nshells prepared with hot water, in order to improve coffee berries\r\nduring the roasting and to give a flavour to the coffee substitutes\r\nprepared from corn and malt. Cacao extract is also prepared from the\r\nshells[98] by first treating them with water or steam, and afterwards\r\nextracting with water, and finally evaporating as far as necessary. The\r\nthick extract thus prepared contains theobromine, and is intended for\r\nuse either alone or as an addition to cacao powder and chocolate.\r\n\r\nStrohschein in Berlin[99] prepares from the shells a thick liquid\r\nextract which he calls “Martol Its preparation was suggested by the\r\nfact that the cacao husk gives evidence of containing a considerable\r\namount of iron. In “Martol”, the iron occurs as a tannate, and the\r\npreparation further contains theobromine, carbohydrates, and phosphoric\r\nacid. The preparation is said to be used as a medicinal remedy in\r\nchlorosis, yet has scarcely justified such a statement.\r\n\r\nAlfred Michel of Eilenberg[100] utilises the shells in the preparation\r\nof a brown colouring material. The husks, free from impurities, are\r\nfirst soaked in soft water, with or without the addition of sulphuric\r\nacid, then washed and finally treated with a strong 35 % solution of\r\ncaustic soda. From the alkaline solution, the colouring matter is\r\nprecipitated with acid or acid metallic salt, collected on a filter,\r\nand again washed. Thus obtained, it is a dark reddish-brown paste,\r\npossessed of a vitreous fracture. The yield of colouring matter is from\r\n20-25 % of the weight of the original shells. By re-treatment with\r\nalkali, the paste can be again obtained in solution and can be used\r\nas required, either in liquid or paste form. The colouring matter can\r\nbe obtained in different tints, either by soaking the shells in more\r\ner less dilute sulphuric acid, or by precipitation from the alkaline\r\nsolution at various temperatures, or yet again, by the addition of\r\nmetallic oxides.\r\n\r\nBoussignault[101] says that in Paris briquettes have been made from\r\ncacao shells, and twenty-two years ago, Zipperer[102] proposed to\r\nuse them as fodder, especially for horses. Experimental work in that\r\ndirection was instituted, but for various reasons, had to be abandoned.\r\nThe question as to a rational working up of the husk of the cacao bean\r\nis once more receiving special consideration, more particularly since\r\nthe publication by the “Association of German Chocolate Manufacturers”\r\nof a prize essay on the subject. The fodder value of the husks as\r\ndetermined by Märcker is apparent from the following figures:\r\n\r\n~Table~ 18.\r\n\r\n  ===========================+=============+===========+===========\r\n                             |  free from  |           | whole and\r\n            Shells           | dust, whole | fine meal |   dusty\r\n                             |      %      |     %     |     %\r\n  ===========================+=============+===========+===========\r\n  Moisture                   |     9·08    |    6·50   |    9·95\r\n  Albumen                    |    13·56    |   14·13   |   12·69\r\n     “    digestible         |     6·06    |    7·07   |    4·38\r\n  Fat                        |     2·65    |    6·76   |    3·96\r\n  Raw fibre                  |    29·14    |   25·80   |   21·55\r\n  Ash                        |     6·32    |    6·44   |    7·26\r\n  Non-nitrogenous extractive |    39·25    |   40·37   |   44·59\r\n\r\nFeeding experiments which were carried out in certain agricultural\r\ninstitutes showed that the cacao husk stands in nutritive value\r\nbetween good meadow hay and wheaten bran, and is not only a fattening\r\nfodder for oxen, but also a valuable feeding material for cows and\r\ndeer[103]. These results have been confirmed by Prof. Feruccio Faelli\r\nin Turin[104].\r\n\r\nThe advantages of cacao shells as fodder, when a comparison with bran\r\nis established, are at once apparent. Two hundredweight (that is to\r\nsay, about 220 lbs. averdupois) cost only from six to seven shillings,\r\nwhilst the price of bran varies between nine and ten shillings. The\r\nhusks also keep better, for after having been stored eighteen months,\r\nProfessor Faelli found that they had undergone no alteration, whilst on\r\nthe other hand bran had become sour. A further advantage possessed by\r\nthe husk is that it will absorb four times its weight of water against\r\nthree times absorbed by bran. Cattle not only readily get accustomed\r\nto the fodder but subsequently take to it with eagerness. The best\r\nresults were obtained with Dutch, Swiss and Parmesan milch cows. After\r\n10 days feeding the butter and milk-sugar had increased, as well as the\r\ndaily average yield of milk from 44 to 49·5 kilogrammes. As soon as the\r\nfeeding with cacao husk was discontinued the yield of milk decreased.\r\nFaelli concludes that cacao husk, which can be used as a fodder up to 4\r\nkilog. daily, exercises a very favourable influence on milch cows, and\r\nhe purposes to continue the investigation with horses.\r\n\r\nIn a report on the Experimental Farms of Canada 1898, page 151,\r\nreference is made to the manurial value of the husks in enriching the\r\nsoil with nitrogen and potash, a fact which had already been pointed\r\nout by Boussignault.\r\n\r\nThe future use of the husks appears therefore to be ensured, and it\r\nis to be hoped that it will allow of a permanent consumption of this\r\nby-product.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Of which the Central Province has 32,003 acres: North Western\r\nProvince 3689 acres, North Central Province 25 acres, Province of Uva\r\n2153 acres and Province of Sabaragamura 1918 acres.

Manufacture of Chocolate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Preparation of the Cacao Beans.\r\n\r\nUp to the end of the eighteenth century the manufacture of chocolate\r\nwas carried on entirely by hand, a method at once laborious and\r\ninefficient. The workman used to kneel down on the ground, and crush\r\nthe beans in iron mortars. It was not until 1732[105] that Buisson\r\nintroduced the use of a bench and so rendered that inconvenient and\r\nunwholesome practice unnecessary. Even to-day, the Chinese cooks on\r\nthe Philippine islands carry their chocolate “Factory” about with\r\nthem, in which the trestle is essential. It further comprises a small\r\nmarble mortar and warmed pestle, and by means of these utensils and\r\nimplements the hulled beans are pounded, and the triturated mass so\r\nobtained spread out. It is then flavoured with sugar and spices. With\r\nthat exception, hand labour in the chocolate manufacture has since the\r\nyear 1778 been entirely displaced by machinery, when Doret exhibited\r\nthe first specimen before the medical faculty of Paris. According\r\nto Belfort de la Roque,[106] a Genoese named Bozelly had already\r\nconstructed a mill by means of which he was able to prepare from six to\r\nseven hundred pounds of chocolate daily, comparing favourably with the\r\nthirty pound output yielded by hand labour. Pelletier[107], in 1819,\r\ndescribes a machine for the mechanical preparation of chocolate of his\r\nown construction, capable of doing the work of seven men. The machines\r\nused in the chocolate manufacture have since that time been repeatedly\r\nimproved and re-constructed, although always with this one end in view,\r\nnamely to obtain a fine even cacao mass, and afterwards mix it as\r\nthoroughly as possible with the other ingredients employed.\r\n\r\nThe first machines of the modern type were constructed by the Parisian\r\nmechanic George Hermann (1801-1883) in the year 1830, to which inventor\r\nwe are indebted for the principle of fine grinding with varying\r\nvelocities, on which manufacture of chocolate is based to-day. There is\r\nat the present time a rather large circle of manufacturers engaged in\r\nthe putting together of special machines for the preparation of cacao\r\nand cacao products, chocolate apart.\r\n\r\nWhether chocolate manufacture be carried out on a large or small scale,\r\nit always involves the subjecting of the cacao bean to a regularly\r\nsucceeding series of operations, before the resulting product known\r\nas “Chocolate” (in the strict commercial sense of the term) can be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe respective operations succeed each other as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ~Preparation of the Beans.~\r\n\r\n 1. ~Storing~, ~cleansing~ and ~sorting~ of raw beans.\r\n\r\n 2. ~Roasting~ the cleansed beans.\r\n\r\n 3. ~Crushing~, ~shelling~ and ~cleansing~ the roasted\r\n bean (removing the radicles etc.)\r\n\r\n 4. ~Mixing~ different kinds of beans.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ~Production of the Cacao Mass.~\r\n\r\n 5. ~Grinding~ the beans till they yield a homogenous paste on\r\n heating.\r\n\r\n 6. ~Mixture~ of the liquefied cacao mass with sugar, spices, etc.\r\n\r\n 7. ~Trituration~ by rollers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ~Preparation~ of the resulting ~Chocolate~.\r\n\r\n 8. ~Extraction~ of ~air~, ~division~ and\r\n ~moulding~.\r\n\r\n 9. ~Cooling.~\r\n\r\n 10. ~Packing~ and ~storing~.\r\n\r\nThis represents the general course of manufacture, which we will now\r\nproceed to describe in more detail, following the headings given above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Preparation of the Beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ~Storing~, ~cleansing~ and ~sorting~.\r\n\r\nRight up to the moment when they are to be used in the manufacture, the\r\nraw cacao beans must be kept as originally packed, and stored in an\r\nairy sun-lit room; although if they have accumulated moisture during\r\ntransport or sustained any manner of damage in harvesting, they should\r\nthen be emptied out of the sacks, spread out over the floor of such a\r\nroom as above described, and dried as effectively as possible. It has\r\nalso been recommended that such beans be washed with a dilute solution\r\nof caustic potash (1 in 5000), and afterwards dried rapidly.\r\n\r\nUnfermented beans, those damaged in the harvest, and those which have\r\nreceived no proper fermentation, develop a greyish white colour with\r\noccasional tints of violet and an unpleasant, bitter herbal flavour,\r\nproperties which unfortunately penetrate to the resulting cacao\r\nproducts. Attempts have been made to meet this evil with a so-called\r\n“Secondary Fermenting Gordian[108] proposes in this connection that the\r\nbeans be filled in water-butts, and steeped in warm water for at least\r\n48 hours (so that obviously the butts must be kept in a warm room), at\r\nthe expiration of which time it can be poured off, and the beans dried\r\nin a chamber heated to a temperature of between forty and fifty degrees\r\ncentigrade. There is said to ensue an appreciable improvement as to\r\nflavour and colour, when this process is carried out.\r\n\r\nThe magazines in which cacao beans are stored have sometimes an\r\nunwelcome visitor, to wit, a grub which according to W. Hauswaldt[109]\r\nhappens to attack just the best kinds of Caracas and Trinidad. As\r\neggs of the grub have on several occasions been found on the interior\r\nof the still unshelled bean, we may assume that they were deposited\r\nby a butterfly (species unknown, but possibly Ephestia cahiriteller,\r\ncf. von Faber loc. cit. page 335) either before or immediately after\r\nfermentation, and no later. Sometimes these grubs appear on the surface\r\nof the sacks, which they overspread in a few days. Removal of the\r\ninfected packages, opening the sacks, and exposure to the sun, as\r\nwell as a thorough cleansing of the storehouses, is attended with a\r\nqualified amount of success. The best plan is to destroy the moths\r\nduring their period of activity in the summer months June, July, and\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hauswaldt, Stollwerck[110] and G. Reinhardt[111], this\r\ncan be effected by placing in the store rooms large, shallow basins\r\nof water, near which burning petroleum lamps are introduced on the\r\napproach of dusk, favourably placed on a pile of bricks and stone, so\r\nthat they clearly illuminate the reflecting water. The moths assemble\r\nround the light en masse and either perish in the water or flame, a\r\nfate which sometimes overtakes even the larvae, for they display the\r\nsame fatal attraction for any light, real or apparent. The water must\r\nbe changed every day, as otherwise the wing-dust collecting on its\r\nsurface affords a means of escape to the insects coming later. As the\r\nweather becomes cooler, the doors and windows of the store-rooms should\r\nbe left open, so that when frost sets in, the rest of the maggots may\r\nbe destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe cleansing and sorting of the raw cacao bean is the most important\r\nfactor in the manufacture of chocolate, and yield a manifold return,\r\nfor inferior and cheaper kinds of bean which have passed through these\r\nprocesses can be advantageously mixed with finer varieties. The chief\r\nobject of cleansing and sorting is the removal of foreign bodies and\r\nsuch chance admixtures as sand, pebbles, and fragments of sacking,\r\nwhich are liable to damage the stones used in grinding at a later stage\r\nof the preparation, or communicate an unnatural and disagreeable smell\r\nto the subsequent roast products. These admixtures are so multiform and\r\nvarious that they cannot be removed solely by the aid of machinery, but\r\nmust be finally picked out by hand. Mechanical appliances are limited\r\nto the removal of pebbles, dust, and possible fragments of iron, after\r\nwhich preliminary cleaning the beans are thrown on straps, where they\r\ncan be picked by hand. The collector of these foreign bodies would find\r\nhimself with a rather interesting stock at the end of a few years, as\r\nWilhelm Schütte-Felsche points out.\r\n\r\nThe cleansing of the raw beans was formerly carried out in so-called\r\nroller casks, placed horizontally, and revolving round an axle fitted\r\nin the floor, whence it passed upward, cutting them slantwise. In this\r\napparatus the beans were rolled and vigorously rubbed together, and\r\nafterwards the hand-picking succeeded. More recently, the roller casks\r\nhave been displaced by rotary cylindrical sieves, driven by motor power.\r\n\r\nSuch a machine is illustrated in fig. 12. The beans are lifted to a\r\nrotatory cylindrical sieve by means of an elevator, where they are\r\nfreed from dust and dirt; in other sections of the sieve fragments of\r\nblossom, sacking, or cloth are isolated, whilst occasional splinters of\r\niron are removed by a large magnet. So prepared, the beans are cast on\r\nrunning belts, and here the hand-picking above-mentioned is carried out.\r\n\r\nFig. 13 shows a cleansing machine for the same purpose, which has\r\nrecently become rather popular. Here the dust passing from the sieve\r\nis sucked up into a dust chamber, by means of an exhauster, whilst\r\npebbles, blossom fragments, and small beans are separately isolated.\r\nThe cleansed beans pass likewise under magnetic influence, which\r\nremoves traces of iron, and finally succeed to the running belting.\r\n\r\nOften the beans are introduced into an extensive brushing machine\r\nbefore roasting, to cleanse them from dirt etc. These are generally\r\nfound in such factories as have circular and cylinder roasters with\r\ndirect heating apparatus. Fig. 13 a shows such a brushing machine for\r\ncacao beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ~Roasting the Beans.~\r\n\r\nThe cleansed and sorted beans are now subjected to a high temperature,\r\nthat is to say, they are now roasted. This roasting answers many\r\npurposes;\r\n\r\n 1. The aroma and flavour of the bean is so developed.\r\n\r\n 2. The starch granules are gelatinised.\r\n\r\n 3. The herbal constituents are so transformed that the flavour of the\r\n beans becomes milder; a distinct improvement.\r\n\r\n 4. In the consequent drying, the shells are rendered brittle, and more\r\n easily removeable.\r\n\r\n 5. The beans themselves can afterwards be better ground.\r\n\r\nThe roasting of the cacao bean does not demand so high a temperature\r\nas that of coffee, to effect the above chemical and physical changes.\r\nExperience has shown that the best temperature lies between 130-140 °\r\nC., though deviations from this standard have recently become frequent\r\nand considerable, according to the uses for which the cacaos are\r\nintended, and roasting has sometimes taken place at a temperature even\r\nas low as 100 ° C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe process of roasting can be carried out in the roasting drum or\r\nmachine in a variety of ways, as:\r\n\r\n1. Direct roasting over a coal fire,\r\n\r\n2. Passing of a hot-air stream over the beans,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n3. Roasting by means of gas, with compressed air, as far as ~sources\r\nof heat~ are concerned; and as regards ~shape of the drum~, it\r\nis to be noted that the cylindrical are most in use. The separation\r\nof the shells from the kernel was still effected at the beginning of\r\nthe present century by stirring the beans in water and so detaching\r\nthe inner coating of the seeds, the method adopted by Weisched\r\n(Mitscherlich page 112). Not till this stage had been reached were they\r\nsubjected to a strong heat, causing the shells to spring off.\r\n\r\nThis method has at the present time only historical interest, for the\r\nso-called roasting drums, as used in the preparation of coffee, are now\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13a.]\r\n\r\nRoasting must be attended with the greatest care, in order that it may\r\nneither be too thorough nor insufficient. It is a great mistake to\r\nthink that the roasting machine can be handed over to the care of any\r\napprentice. That nicety of roasting which corresponds to the variety\r\nand its subsequent utilisation constitutes the qualitative basis of\r\nthe chocolate manufactured later. It is impossible for even the best\r\nchocolate maker to retrieve what has been spoilt in this important\r\npreliminary operation, wherefore a skilled workman, endowed with a keen\r\nsense of taste and smell, is always to be seen at the roasting machine.\r\n\r\nIt has already been attempted to provide a means of security against\r\nover-burning by the construction of the so-called safety-roaster, about\r\nwhich will be spoken later.\r\n\r\nOverroasting is immediately indicated by a disagreeable empyreumatic\r\nodour (resembling that of roasted coffee); the husks char and the\r\nkernels crumble, also betraying a charring on the outside. There is\r\na correspondingly increasing keenness of flavour, and a transference\r\nof theobromine from the kernel to the husks (cf. page 65). From the\r\ndestructive distillation of the cacao fat arises that volatile and\r\npungent acroleine which is the principal cause of the empyreuma of the\r\nover-roasted bean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nThe following general precautions in roasting cacao are worthy of\r\nnote; 1. the beans should not remain too long in the roasting drum;\r\n2. they should be kept on the stir, for which reason the apparatus is\r\nmade revolvable on its axles; 3. the heat applied should be carefully\r\nregulated; and 4. to guard against a loss of aroma, the roasted beans\r\nshould be cooled as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nAs the cacao must be more or less roasted according to its quality and\r\nultimate destination, which entails the acquisition of considerable\r\nempirical knowledge on the part of the workman entrusted with this\r\nprocess, it would be neither advisable nor practicable to annex\r\ndefinite instructions as to time and temperature requirements.\r\n\r\nIn the following we describe a machine which is to be found in most\r\nfactories and which corresponds to all the demands of technique.\r\nFrom its heating system, it belongs to the class of hot-air current\r\nroasters—direct coal fire assisting—and in shape to the cylindrical\r\nroasters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14 a.]\r\n\r\nThis machine is illustrated in fig. 14 and shown in section in figs.\r\n14 a and 14 b. To prevent loss of heat by radiation, to save fuel, and\r\npreclude possibilities of danger from fire, the whole installation is\r\nwalled in. Driving shafts occur at the back of the machine, and the\r\ncharging apparatus is introduced in front. A furnace lies directly\r\nunder the drum, whilst on either side are chambers accessible to\r\ncurrents of fresh air, which are provided with heating tubes and\r\nwhich admit of a regulation of the air supply. They are shut off from\r\nconnection with the gases from the fire, so that only the fresh air\r\nheated here can penetrate to the roasting products in the charged\r\ndrum. There are winnowing shovels fitted in this, calculated to keep\r\nthe beans in motion and facilitate the access of air. When the hopper\r\nis closed, the gases arising from the roast product can be led off\r\nby an annexed outlet pipe, and thereupon condensed and the resulting\r\nliquid drained off at the foot of the machine. For the attainment of\r\nthe proper degree of roasting, as well as for controlling the whole\r\nprocess, there is a sampler to every machine. The drum is emptied\r\nwhilst in motion, its door-like front being turned aside and the\r\nroasted beans transferred by the winnowing shovels before mentioned to\r\ntrolleys wheeled underneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14 b.]\r\n\r\nThe loss of heat by radiation is very insignificant, as the machine is\r\ncompletely walled in. Any kind of fuel may be used. Since the stoking\r\nas well as the removal of soot takes place at the front, several of\r\nthese roasters can be set up side by side. It is a great advantage\r\nof this installation, that by removal of the front of the drum its\r\ninterior is laid quite open, admitting of a thorough overhauling which\r\nis attended with every disadvantage for the flavour of subsequent\r\nroasting lots.\r\n\r\nThe machine here described is constructed in varying sizes, with an\r\noutside capacity of four hundred kilograms.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned the so-called safety-roaster offers a certain\r\nsecurity against the burning of the beans as the roasting boiler is\r\nlifted out of the fire by means of an automatically working safety\r\nregulator. Figs. 15 a and b show a spherical roaster open and closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15 a.]\r\n\r\nThe principal of construction is founded on the fact that each roasting\r\nis connected with a loss of weight and it is logical that the same\r\nquality of beans always yields the same loss of weight at a certain\r\ndegree of roasting. On an average cacao yields a loss of 6-7 %.\r\nAccording to this, the loss of weight which can at first be empirically\r\nascertained, for example by a new kind of bean, can be calculated and\r\ncan be indicated on a regulator, on the principle of the Roman scale.\r\nWhen the beans have lost the weight in question the counterpoise of\r\nthe regulator raises the axle of the roasting sphere by means of which\r\nthe working of the whole machine is set in motion.\r\n\r\nThere is no exception to the rule that only beans of one and the\r\nsame kind should be roasted and broken up together, as thickness or\r\nthinness of the shells determines to a large extent the time required\r\nfor roasting, and also an even size of bean is necessary to the smooth\r\noperation of the breaking machine. The husks of the roasted cacao bean\r\nare hygroscopic, and consequently the roasted unshelled beans contain\r\nmore moisture after having been kept for a time, than they do in the\r\nraw state; but the drier the bean is, the easier it shells. The cacao\r\nis therefore to be worked up as quickly as possible, or at least kept\r\nin well covered metal boxes till further treatment can be proceeded\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15 b.]\r\n\r\nAs sources of heat we find direct and indirect stoking with house\r\ncoal and coal gas, and besides these, for the installations of larger\r\nfactories Dowson gas is especially suitable, as it does not involve\r\ntoo high a temperature, and the outlay is not so great as when coal-gas\r\nis used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe roasting machine in fig. 16 for Dowson or coal gas belongs to\r\nthe class of roasters with direct firing. It corresponds to the one\r\ndiagrammed in Fig. 15 as regards charging and emptying. Here also the\r\nfront wall of the drum can be removed, and the interior consequently\r\nlaid completely open. The transmission of gas is effected at an air\r\npressure of one atmosphere, for the attainment of which an air pump\r\nis fitted up in the vicinity, capable of feeding four machines at the\r\nsame time. The drum holds about 150 kilos. It goes without saying that\r\nthe regulating of the requisite heat is in this instance of the utmost\r\nease and nicety. Another preponderating advantage of this machine as\r\ncompared with those heated with coke or ordinary coal is its clean\r\noperation and the extraordinary speed with which it can be both started\r\nand stopped. Form 3-4 cbm. of coal gas are needed for 100 kilos of\r\nbeans, whilst for Dowson gas, which has not such a high heating value,\r\nmuch larger quantities are required, and consequently a stronger\r\nframework becomes necessary, though here no air pumps need be put in\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\nSteam roasting apparatus have not proved particularly successful, as\r\nhas been evident in all experiments hitherto made with them, and steam\r\nagency does not appear to be suitable for the cacao bean, it admitting\r\nof no thorough and at the same time even roasting.\r\n\r\nYet on the other hand the hot air-current roasters described enjoy an\r\never increasing popularity, partly because they are heated indirectly,\r\nand again because they appreciably diminish the time taken up in the\r\nactual process, which in other cases approaches to as much as thirty or\r\nforty minutes, without exposing the beans to the danger of burning or\r\ngetting charred.\r\n\r\nAs just stated, the beans should be passed on to the next process as\r\nspeedily as possible, yet on the other hand be completely cooled\r\noff, so as to loosen their shells before they arrive in the breaking\r\nmachine. There are also special constructions for this cooling. If the\r\nroasting drums are fitted up directly on the ground, it is effected\r\nby disposing the beans issuing from these machines in wide baskets or\r\nsieves, and letting them cool there before bringing them to the next\r\nprocess. Should they be situated at a sufficient height, the beans can\r\nbe slowly transferred down a shoot connected with the rooms below,\r\nwhere crushing mills await them, and cooled on the journey by a play of\r\nfresh air currents.\r\n\r\nVery much to the purpose and well adapted as regards most of the\r\nrequisite conditions, are the cooling trucks with exhaust apparatus\r\nshown in fig. 17.\r\n\r\nThese trucks are fitted with perforated false bottoms and with sliding\r\nshutters at the side. After the contents of the roasting machine have\r\nbeen discharged into the trucks, these are wheeled over to the exhaust\r\napparatus easily recognisable in the diagram, where the cacao is so far\r\ncooled that subsequent “after-roasting” is impossible, whilst the gases\r\ngiven off are conducted by the ventilator. This exhaust chamber can be\r\nmade to work from both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ~Crushing, hulling and cleansing.~\r\n\r\nUp to ten years ago, the crushing and shelling of cacao beans had not\r\nbeen so far perfected as to effect the complete separation of husk and\r\nradicle from all particles of kernel, or to prevent loss by isolating\r\nand collecting the minute particles of kernel, which are drawn up\r\nthrough the exhaust apparatus in conjunction with the lightest of the\r\ncacao shells. Yet the requirements demanded of a satisfactory machine\r\nadvanced to such an extent that not only cacao nibs free from shell\r\nwere postulated—an end scarcely hard to attain—but shells free from\r\ncacao nibs were made a further essential. A machine which performs\r\nboth these objects not only works excellently, but is also economical.\r\nFor a solution of this problem the Association of German Chocolate\r\nManufacturers, which is specially interested in all that concerns\r\nthe chocolate industry, offered a prize years ago; the firm of J. M.\r\nLehmann were the first to construct a machine answering every call made\r\non it to perfection.\r\n\r\nFig. 18 illustrates a crushing and cleansing machine averaging an\r\noutput of 2500-3000 kilos, of the latest and most modern type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe beans are first broken into smaller pieces in all machines now\r\nemployed as crushing, shelling or cleansing apparatus, and the one at\r\npresent under consideration provides no exception. An air-current is\r\nmade to play on these fragments, which finally isolates and transfers\r\nthe loosened shells to another part of the apparatus. The cacao next\r\nsucceeds to a crusher of regular capacity lodged in the upper part of\r\nthe machine, being despatched on an elevator. The fragments fall into\r\na cylindrical sieve, dust being detached in the first compartment,\r\nwhilst the meshes of subsequent compartments gradually increase in\r\nsize and sort the products therein transmitted in corresponding\r\nsizes. There is a groove traversed by air-currents—proceeding from a\r\nventilator—immediately under each compartment. This current of air can\r\nbe regulated, i. e. made weaker for lighter and stronger for heavier\r\nfragments, and there is a ventilator for every compartment to make this\r\nregulation of the easiest, and in this way shells of equal size but\r\nspecifically lighter than, the cacao fragments are most efficaciously\r\nseparated. Contrasting with the older type of machine, it works almost\r\nnoiselessly, all shakings of grooves and sieves being entirely avoided;\r\nin addition to which there is a perfect exclusion of dust, when the\r\nshells are transferred into the dust-removing chamber. A further\r\nadvantage is that there is no wearing out of the machine, except as\r\nregards the direct crushing apparatus, which occasionally need renewing.\r\n\r\nThe dust particles before mentioned, which possibly comprise as much\r\nas one half of the cacao fragments, require a special kind of working\r\nup, on ~different machines~, before the cacao still contained\r\ntherein can be obtained. It is a fact obvious and apparent, that the\r\nsmaller the fragments of shell mixed with this crushed cacao, the\r\nmore difficult will be their separation, a fact of equal importance\r\nto technical and analytical science, and the more scrupulously this\r\nprocess is to be carried out, the greater the lavishment on sieves and\r\nventilating compartments entailed.\r\n\r\nTo effect this operation on the breaking machine is seriously to\r\novertask the latter, and defeats its own end, as experiments carried\r\nout in the Chocolate factory of Schütte-Felsche have proved, inasmuch\r\nas it leads very easily to mixing of the products which are to be kept\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\nFig. 19 shows such a machine for the cleansing of this so-called cacao\r\n“dust\r\n\r\nThe particles are raised to a large flat sieve by means of an elevator,\r\nagain sorted in different sizes, and submitted to air currents of\r\ncorresponding strength. The quantity obtained varies according to\r\nthe variety of cacao, though in some cases it may amount to 50 or 54\r\npercent. What remains after this process is absolutely worthless and\r\ncan only be considered as refuse, at least as far as the chocolate\r\nmanufacturer is concerned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\nIt has become necessary in modern manufacture that iron fragments\r\noccurring in the machine not only be separated by distinct magnetic\r\nfields in the respective machines, but that this also be effected in a\r\nmachine specially constructed for the purpose. Fig. 20 illustrates such\r\nan electromagnetic apparatus. The advantages of this system are that it\r\navoids magnets limited in strength, and by the functioning of strong\r\nelectro-magnets perfect cleansing even in the case of the largest\r\noutput, as well as machines of the most simple construction, can be\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\nWe submit the following description of the machine and its method of\r\nworking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe machine contains a hopper with sloping groove to obtain an even\r\nintroduction of the beans to be cleansed. At the end of this there is\r\nan electro-magnet roller, consisting of a non-magnetised mantle and a\r\nmagnetic compartment round which it turns.\r\n\r\nAfter traversing the sloping groove, the beans succeed to the roller,\r\nmeeting it at a tangent. As soon as they reach the field of magnetism,\r\nall iron fragments are appropriated by the revolving mantle, whilst the\r\nbeans themselves do not come into contact with this, but pass directly\r\nunderneath. The iron fragments are disposed of separately, and outside\r\nthe magnetising area.\r\n\r\nIt is of prime importance in the preparation of chocolate and more\r\nparticularly of cocoa powder (easily soluble cacao), that the crushed\r\nmaterial proceeding from the crushing machine should undergo a\r\nfurther purification, with a view to separating, and removing the\r\nhard radicles. These constitute the gritty sediment of insufficiently\r\nprepared cacao powder, when dissolved. J. M. Lehmann effects the\r\ncomplete removal of the radicle by means of his machine D. R. G. M. No.\r\n24,989 (Fig. 21).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\nHere the finer siftings from the crusher are transferred to the\r\ncontrolling feeder, under which a small ventilator occurs, which\r\nprovides for the removal of any still remaining portions of husk.\r\nCacao and radicle descend to a shaking sieve, the finer particles\r\npassing through its meshes, whilst the larger grains fall into a\r\npocket attached to the end, as cleansed product. The former fragments\r\nnow succeed to a cylinder, having its inner surface punched with\r\nsmall cavities (fig. 22) and while the cacao particles remain in\r\nthose cavities during the rotation of the cylinder, the radicles of\r\nmore elongated form are caught up by a special separator (1) and so\r\nprevented from being carried round with the rest. The cacao particles\r\nare then made to fall into a trough (3) by a brush (2) working against\r\nthe cylinder, and subsequently urged forward by a conveyor (4). That\r\nprocess is enacted all along the cylinder, so that finally cacao and\r\nradicle issue from the machine completely separated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe advantages, economical and otherwise, attending the use of the\r\nabove breaking and cleansing machines become apparent when the\r\nfollowing figures, registering results obtained in several experiments,\r\nare considered. Formerly the loss experienced in sorting, roasting,\r\ncrushing and hulling averaged about 30 % of the total beans, but now\r\nthe employment of the above machines shows the following satisfactory\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThe loss of 823 kg Machala beans, unroasted, amounted to a total:\r\n\r\n  a)  in  picking     3·6  kg\r\n  b)  \"   roasting   63·5  \"\r\n  c)  \"   shelling   61    \"\r\n  d)  \"   dust       34    \"\r\n                   —————————\r\n                    162·1  kg or 20%,\r\n\r\nwithout taking into account the application of the waste; 2267 kg of\r\nSt. Thomé raw cacao lost:\r\n\r\n  a)  in  picking      5  kg\r\n  b)  \"   roasting   170  \"\r\n  c)  \"   shelling   152  \"\r\n  d)  \"   dust        79  \"\r\n                  —————————\r\n                     406  kg or 20%.\r\n\r\nAccording to these data the use of these machines admits of a saving of\r\nabout 10 percent more material than in former work.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these particulars it is also of interest to consider\r\nthe qualitative and quantitative composition of the various waste\r\nproducts of the manufacture. Filsinger[112] has at the instance of\r\nthe Association of German Chocolate manufacturers, examined a mixture\r\nof 50 pounds of large Machala beans with an equal quantity of small\r\nbeans, after passing it through a shelling machine of the most modern\r\nconstruction, and he thus obtained:\r\n\r\n  70   pounds of large kernels,\r\n   9·2   “    \"  medium kernels,\r\n   0·8   \"    \"  radicles,\r\n  10     \"    \"  husk (outer woody shell),\r\n   4     \"    \"  cacao waste,\r\n   6     \"    \"  other loss,\r\n\r\nThe 4 pounds of cacao waste yielded by further sifting:\r\n\r\n  a)  kernel   I. sort 250 grammes,\r\n              II.  \"    50    \"\r\n             III.  \"   220    \"\r\n              IV.  \"    25    \"\r\n  b)  husk     I.  \"   185    \"\r\n              II.  \"    55    \"\r\n             III.  \"   370    \"\r\n              IV.  \"    80    \"\r\n  c)  cacao dust       725    \"\r\n  d)  waste             30    \"\r\n  e)  loss              10    \"\r\n                   ————————\r\n                      2000 grammes.\r\n\r\nChemical analysis of these portions gave the following results:\r\n\r\n  ======================================+================================\r\n                                        |          Percentages\r\n                                        +———-—-—+—-—-——+————--—+——-—-——-\r\n                                        |  Ash  | Sand |  Fat  |Fibre[113]\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————————+—————-—+——————+—————-—+———————-\r\n  1.

From the large amount of fat present in the\r\nformer material it might be regarded, in the full sense of the term,\r\nas a cacao constituent and, for that reason, its presence in cacao\r\npreparations should not be objected to, while the husk containing\r\nas much as 20 percent of woody fibre cannot be considered a cacao\r\nconstituent in the same sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. ~Mixing different kinds.~\r\n\r\nStress has already been laid on the variations in taste incidental to\r\ndifferent species of bean. It has further to be noted that they develop\r\na milder and more aromatic flavour according as they have been more\r\nproperly fermented, and in contrary instances possess an astringent and\r\neven acid taste. It therefore becomes an aim of the manufacturer so\r\nto improve the flavour of inferior varieties by mixing with the finer\r\nas to produce a resultant cacao giving perfect satisfaction to every\r\ntaste. Nevertheless the general rule still holds good that for the\r\npreparation of the finest qualities of chocolate only the better sorts\r\nof bean (as Caracas, Ariba, Puerto Cabello etc.) should be employed.\r\nFor inferior and less expensive ware other varieties of bean suffice,\r\nthe mixture being obviously regulated by the prevailing market prices.\r\n\r\nIn many instances the proportions of such mixtures are kept secret\r\nby the manufacturer as matters of importance, and every individual\r\nmanufacturer has his own method and specialities as regards such\r\nblends.\r\n\r\nWe compare here a few verified blends:\r\n\r\n  1.\r\n  Caracas  }\r\n  Guayaquil}  of each 1 part\r\n\r\n  2.\r\n  Caracas = 1 part\r\n  Bahia   = 5 parts\r\n\r\n  3.\r\n  Maracaibo}\r\n  Maragnon }  each 1 part\r\n\r\n  4.\r\n  Trinidad}\r\n  Maragnon}  equal parts\r\n\r\n  5.\r\n  Caracas  = 1 part\r\n  Maragnon = 2 parts\r\n\r\n  6.\r\n  1 part Ariba\r\n  1 part Surinam\r\n  1 part Trinidad\r\n\r\n  7.\r\n  1 part Ariba\r\n  1 part Trinidad\r\n  1 part Surinam\r\n  1 part Caracas\r\n\r\n  8.\r\n  3 parts Ariba\r\n  1 part Trinidad\r\n  1 part Surinam\r\n  1 part Caracas\r\n\r\n  9.\r\n  1 part Machala\r\n  1 part St. Thomas\r\n\r\nCeylon cacaos are not used so much as mixing varieties, but almost\r\nexclusively as covering agents, to make other cacaos lighter coloured\r\n(sometimes almost approaching yellow).\r\n\r\nThe beans are weighed off in these proportions on a sensitive scale,\r\nand then passed on to be ground and triturated into cacao paste.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Production of the Cacao Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ~Fine grinding and trituration.~\r\n\r\nFormerly the roasted, crushed, and decorticated beans were frequently\r\nground before being transferred to the “Melangeur”,—a machine that will\r\nbe described later—, in which they were then reduced to a finer state\r\nof sub-division and lastly mixed with sugar. For this grinding, mills\r\nof various construction were employed (as Weldon, Pintus etc.). But\r\nas time rolled on the Melangeur took the place of these preliminary\r\ngrinding mills, and in this it was endeavoured to effect that fine\r\ndivision of the cacao mass which is essential to the production of a\r\nhomogeneous cacao and sugar intermixture, but without complete success.\r\nCylinder rolling machines (French method) were the first to attain this\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, the roasted and cleansed kernels are ground so\r\nfine as to become a semi-liquid when subjected to heat, and that\r\nis done whatever the ultimate destiny of the cacao, whether it be\r\nintended for chocolate or cocoa powder. This object is obtained by\r\nmeans of special mills, constructed with “Over-runners\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24 a.]\r\n\r\nThese cacao mills, which were formerly but seldom met with in chocolate\r\nfactories, have now become indispensable necessaries, since they have\r\nthe advantage:\r\n\r\n1. of rendering the cacao mass in this semi-glucose form more easily\r\nmiscible with sugar, a factor of the highest importance for the\r\ncommoner and cheaper qualities of chocolate;\r\n\r\n2. of grinding the cacao as fine as possible in one operation and the\r\nsimplest manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24 b.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24 c.]\r\n\r\nBut side by side with the appreciation which these mills met with,\r\nthere arose a corresponding increase in the demands made on them, such\r\nas the utmost nicety, greatest possible output, and least possible\r\nnecessity of after-heating, and these have been successively answered\r\nby twin, triple and at the present time even quadruple mills. fig. 23\r\nshows a simple grinding mill which can only come into consideration\r\nin connection with the smallest of branches, whilst Fig. 24 a and b\r\nillustrates another with three successive stones arranged one above the\r\nother, such as will be found in all the larger factories of to-day.\r\nAlso a triple mill but with grindstones of increasing size pictured in\r\nfig. 24 c. A mill possessing four pairs of grinding stones is given in\r\nfig. 25, and is calculated to meet each and every conceivable demand.\r\n\r\nWhilst simple, double and triple mills are brought on the market in\r\ndifferent sizes, corresponding to the outputs required, these quadruple\r\nmills are only constructed in the largest sizes. They grind perfectly,\r\nand without detriment to the flavour, deliver quantities of cacao\r\nfiguring at from 1000 to 1200 kilos daily. There is naturally a larger\r\noutput if the fatty contents of the cacao are considerable, a thorough\r\nroasting being always presupposed.\r\n\r\nThe axles occurring on these quadruple grinding mills are connected\r\nwith one another by means of spur-wheels, and the axles themselves\r\nrun in ball-bearings, which not only permits a perfectly noiseless\r\noperation of the machine, but also makes the action very easy, that is\r\nto say, dependent on only very little motor power. The cacao is raised\r\nto the hopper by means of an elevator, where the quantity introduced\r\ninto the machine is regulated, and then passes between crushers\r\noccurring in the middle of the first pair of grinding stones, which\r\nit subsequently leaves as a pasty mass. It is then conducted along\r\na groove into the second mill, and here undergoes further grinding,\r\nand so to the third and fourth, where the process can be described as\r\ntrituration, for the cacao leaves the machine in liquid form. Only in\r\nthis manner is it possible to obtain the finest ground product, without\r\nany disastrous accompaniment of excessive heating.\r\n\r\nCacao mills with one stone suffice for the production of chocolate mass\r\non a small scale, but for the manufacture of cocoa powder, twin or\r\ntriple grinders must be employed.\r\n\r\nAll these are of the “Over-runner” type, act by their own weight, and\r\nconsequently do not involve the disastrous consequences which were\r\nentailed by the “Under-runners” tried formerly.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the nineties of the last century, experiments were\r\nmade with a view to superseding these types with mills having stones of\r\nvarying sizes, and first larger upper stones of a grinding pair were\r\ntried, then larger under stones, but neither have been able to maintain\r\nthemselves in the workshop, and the grinders of equal size still hold\r\ngood as the fittest and most popular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\nAttempts have recently been made to introduce a machine combining mill\r\nand roller. Its value lies in the fact that with a relative increase\r\nin the grinding rapidity, it does not involve a greater than requisite\r\nheat, and on emerging from the machine the cacao shows no deficiencies\r\nas to flavour, and is withal much finer than that produced in other\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\nFig. 26 shows such a machine. The mill on this serves merely to reduce\r\nthe hard kernel to a pulp, and this admits of the grinding stones being\r\nplaced farther apart, and so occasions no heat. Trituration is then\r\neffected by a roller apparatus, for which operation machines with four\r\nrollers have been proved most satisfactory. As such roller machines are\r\nfurnished with water-cooling systems, it is possible for the cacao to\r\nbe kept cool even on these.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. ~Mixture with sugar and spices.~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\nA thorough mixing with sugar can only be effected when the cacao paste\r\nis heated to a temperature rather above the melting point of cacao\r\nbutter, that is to say, as high as from 35° to 40° C., and consequently\r\nthe incorporating machine in which that operation is carried on is\r\nprovided with a steam jacket. For this process it is advisable to\r\nhave the chocolate in a semi-liquid condition, wherefore the ground\r\ncacao issuing from the mills is transferred to steam-heated vessels\r\n(fig. 27) fitted with taps suitable for drawing off the mass as it is\r\nrequired. Formerly the cacao mass was fed into the melangeur in lumps\r\nand there liquefied. But as this necessitated the application of heat\r\nto the melangeur, attended with the risk of cracking its under-plating,\r\nand also a postponement of the mixing processes, whereby considerable\r\ntime was lost, this method no longer obtains to-day. It is at present\r\nusual not only to warm the cacao mass beforehand, but the sugar also,\r\nby storing it in warm chambers, so that the whole paste possesses\r\na uniform temperature, lowering of temperature in the melangeur is\r\navoided, and there is consequently no waste of the heating steam.\r\n\r\nIn some large factories the actual incorporation of cacao and sugar\r\nis preceded by a preliminary mixing of large quantities, which\r\nconsiderably relieves the strain on the melangeur, whilst it keeps the\r\nmachine rooms as far as possible free from superfluous dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe mixing machine shown in fig. 28 can here be used with advantage.\r\nAs will be seen on comparing the illustration, it is provided with a\r\nshifting trough. Such a machine, when closed down, is capable of mixing\r\nfrom 100-500 kilos of chocolate. The mixing is effected by means of two\r\nsuitably shaped blades, and the heating by a steam jacket. After the\r\noperation is completed, the mixed material is turned out into portable\r\ntroughs, and after having been kept in a warm chamber for some length\r\nof time, transferred to the melangeur for further treatment.\r\n\r\nIt has been found advantageous to keep the chocolate mass so obtained\r\nin suitable receptacles for several days[114], at a temperature of\r\nnot less than 20° C. and between that figure and 40° C. So the sugar\r\nis enabled to penetrate the entire mass, which now proceeds to the\r\nrolling processes carried out in the melangeur and rolling machines.\r\nShortly before its discharge from the latter, it is mixed with spices,\r\nvanillin, eatherial oils and so forth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. ~Treatment of the Mixture.~\r\n\r\n\r\na) Trituration.\r\n\r\nIn describing the mixing machines, we do not intend to enter into\r\ndetails regarding the machines formerly in use, but merely to give a\r\nbrief outline of the principles illustrated in their construction.\r\n\r\nTrituration was formerly produced;\r\n\r\n  1. by rollers running backwards and forwards on a grinder;\r\n  2. by several cones rotating in a circle on a disc-shaped bed;\r\n  3. by means of rotating stones running in a trough;\r\n  4. by means of several cylindrical rollers;\r\n  5. by means of grooved cone moving in a grooved casing.[115]\r\n\r\nAt the present time only the type mentioned under 1. and 4. are in\r\ngeneral use. 3. is met with less frequently, and will be described at\r\ngreater length in a subsequent paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe machines 1. and 3. are put into operation prior to the cylinder\r\nrolling mills, which finish off the incorporation of chocolate and\r\nsugar and the levigation process only begun in the first-named.\r\n\r\nThe machines constructed in the manner described under 3., to which we\r\nnow turn, were introduced by G. Hermann of Paris, but are at present\r\nalmost obsolete. Since they have some historical interest and are\r\ntypical of the development of the melangeur, we annex a rough sketch\r\nshowing their general construction in fig. 29.\r\n\r\nThe ellipsoid runners _a_ made of granite work in the trough _i_ which\r\nis also of granite and is fitted with the casing _h_. The runners\r\nrotate on their axles _b_ so as to move in a circle. The two arms of\r\nthe axis _b_ have at the centre an elliptical ring with a quadrangular\r\nopening, into which fits the similar shaped part of the vertical shaft\r\n_c_ fitted with the toothed wheels, _d_ and _d′_, which are set in\r\nmotion by power transmitted to the shaft and its connections. The arm\r\n_b_ has some play downwards, so that it can adjust itself vertically\r\naccording to the greater or less quantity of material in the mill. The\r\ntwo steel blades, _e_ and _e′_, are shaped to fit the cavity of the\r\ntrough; being connected with the shaft _c_ they revolve with it and\r\nsweep down the cacao mass adhering to the sides of the mill. Between\r\nthe foundation _k_ and the trough _i_ there is a space _l_ into which\r\nsteam can be introduced through _f_, the condensed water passing away\r\nby _g_.\r\n\r\nAll machines of this kind have now been displaced by the melangeur\r\nwhich is capable of turning out a much larger quantity of material with\r\na relatively smaller expenditure of power. The operation of mixing\r\nchocolate is not a mere mixing, for the ~pressure~ exerted by\r\nthe ~runners~ is also an indispensable factor. On that account\r\nthe ordinary mixing machines have not proved serviceable, especially\r\nin the case of chocolates containing a small amount of fat, such as\r\nthe cheaper kinds, while the addition of cacao butter to facilitate\r\nthe working of the machine would considerably increase the cost of\r\nproduction. Melangeurs are generally constructed on the same principle\r\nas the edge runner grinding mills which are so much used; but they\r\ndiffer from them in so far as the bed-stone revolves, while the runners\r\nmerely rotate on their axles without revolving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe melangeur with travelling bed-stone, as constructed by Lehmann, is\r\nshown at fig. 30; it is fitted with an arrangement for lifting out the\r\nrunners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\nThe bed-stone as well as the runners are made of granite. Each runner\r\nhas an axis working in plummer blocks, so that it can be lifted out\r\nindependently of the other one. By that construction the runners are\r\nprevented from taking an oblique position as was the case with the\r\nmills formerly made, since one runner would be forced downwards or\r\ntilted on its outer edge whenever the other one was raised up somewhat.\r\nThe bed-stone of this machine revolves and it is easily heated by steam\r\npipes from below. One important advantage of this machine is that\r\nbeing low it can be very easily charged and emptied. The contrivance\r\nfor lifting out the runners prevents them thumping upon the bed-stone\r\nthat might otherwise readily happen when starting the machine, and it\r\nalso lessens the wear of the driving bands; moreover, large lumps of\r\nsugar or cacao are very readily crushed down and, so, the working is\r\nmuch facilitated. The emptying of the melangeur is readily and safely\r\neffected, while the bed stone is revolving, by holding a shovel so\r\nthat the cacao is thrown up against the shovel. A melangeur of this\r\nconstruction is represented by fig. 31; it has three runners and\r\nunderneath the bed-stone is fitted a steam engine which supplies\r\ndriving power, the exhaust steam being used for heating the machine.\r\n\r\nAlthough this emptying by hand is not attended with any serious\r\ndrawbacks, yet it involves loss of time and is rather inconvenient,\r\nso that the demand for mechanical automatism in this operation was\r\nvery considerable. It is now some years since Messrs. J. M. Lehmann\r\npatented an apparatus for the mechanical discharging of the chocolate\r\nmass from these machines, but their invention still holds good. A\r\nmelangeur provided with such apparatus is shown on fig. 31. Here\r\na vertically moving shovel is sunk behind the outlet, gradually\r\ndamming the material, and causing it to rise above the edge of the\r\ntank and fall through the opening. A second but horizontally working\r\narrangement, which in this case as in the last is controllable by means\r\nof a crank, conducts the remainder of the material to the same shovel.\r\nSo the material is discharged within a few minutes.—These melangeurs\r\nare built for varying outputs. Fig. 32 illustrates one of the largest\r\nyet constructed. Its base has a diameter of 2 metres, and the machine\r\nitself has a capacity of 5 cwts. To avoid the mixing of dust with\r\nthe sugar as far as possible, the whole melangeur is provided with a\r\ndust-proof protector.\r\n\r\n\r\nb) Levigation.\r\n\r\nAn extreme fineness and homogeneity of the chocolate mass is obtained\r\nin the employment of cylindrical rolling machines, for the construction\r\nof which we are indebted to G. Hermann of Paris. Every kind of\r\nchocolate must be passed through the rolling machine at least once\r\nor twice even when finely powdered sugar is used, though in this\r\ncase it is less a question of sub-division than of incorporation and\r\nintermixture. The best qualities are passed through the machine from\r\nsix to eight times, or even more. The mass is finally fed into the\r\nmachine in cold blocks and so ground off. Granite is the material\r\nchiefly employed in making the rollers, although it is not every\r\nvariety which can be adapted to this purpose. Apart from the fact that\r\ngranite, or indeed any other mineral stone, seldom occurs in compact\r\nmasses and free from flaws, neither porphyry nor the stone generally\r\ndescribed as granite is suitable for employment in the construction of\r\nmill rollers. A kind is generally preferred which intermediates between\r\ngranite and porphyry as to hardness and possesses excellent grinding\r\ncapacities, and which goes by the name of diorite. No other stone can\r\ncompare with this diorite in respect to the above qualities, and the\r\nchief firms engaged in the construction of roller machines possess\r\ntheir own quarries. But we shall return to this later, for recently\r\nexperiments with case-hardened casting rollers (Krupp steel) and hard\r\nporcelain have yielded very flattering results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33 a.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33 b.]\r\n\r\nWe shall now enter into more detail respecting the principle\r\nillustrated by these rolling machines. The plasticity of the chocolate\r\nmass necessitates a rotation of the cylinder surfaces in opposite\r\ndirections with dissimilar velocities. Accordingly two or more rollers\r\nare caused to work against each other, and in compliance with this\r\nprinciple of sub-division with differential velocities, their axles are\r\nfitted with wheels, of which each has a different number of cogs.\r\n\r\nSo those rollers furnished with the greater number of teeth revolve\r\nmore slowly, whilst in opposite instances there is a corresponding\r\nacceleration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of the machines now in use differs more or less from\r\nthat of the type first invented by Hermann, plan and elevation of which\r\nappear in figs. 33 a and 33 b respectively.[116]\r\n\r\nThe granite rollers at _a¹_, _a²_, _a³_ are fitted with an octagonal\r\niron axle that is somewhat thicker at the interior part and they are\r\nmounted upon a frame as shown in the drawing. The sockets of the\r\ncentral rollers _a²_ are fixed and each one is held in position by\r\nthree sets screws; those of the two other rollers can be shifted along\r\ngrooves in the frame and when the cylinders _a¹_ and _a³_ have been\r\nbrought into proper position relatively to the cylinder _a²_ they are\r\nheld fast by the set screws _p_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this adjustment, there is at each end of the machine\r\na horizontal wrought iron shaft _f_ that can be turned by the winch\r\n_e_, and these shafts are fitted with two endless screws _d_ working\r\nin the corresponding wheels _c_. These occur on the spindles _a_,\r\nwhich screw in and out of the bearing blocks of the rollers _a¹_ and\r\n_a²_, but turn only in the fixed collars _b_ without being shifted\r\nfrom their place. The result is that on turning the cranks _e_ the\r\ncorresponding cylinder _a¹_ or _a³_ is moved nearer to, or further\r\nfrom, the central cylinder _a²_, while the position of all of them\r\nalways remains parallel. The shaft _Q_ is set in motion by the driving\r\nwheel _L_ fitted with the loose wheel _L¹_. It acts first upon the\r\ncog wheel _K_ which works in the larger wheel _J_ on the axle of the\r\ncentral roller _a²_. That works in the cog wheel _O_ and the wheel _P_\r\nfitted to the roller _a¹_ driving them as well as the wheel _M_ and\r\nthe pinion _N_ of the roller _a³_ The result is that the axle _a²_\r\nmakes 1¾ revolutions and _a³_ 6⅛ revolutions while _a¹_ in the\r\nsame time makes only one revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe cacao or chocolate is supplied to this machine by the hopper _R_\r\nwhich is placed between the rollers _a¹_ and _a²_. The pasty mass\r\nadhering to the rollers is carried forward by the quicker moving roller\r\n_a²_ and it is ground finer between the rollers _a²_ and _a³_,\r\nafter which the material is removed from _a³_ at the outer side by an\r\nadjustable blade _gg_ and then falls down into a receptacle below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 38 and 39.]\r\n\r\nOn the design fig. 34 we see a machine of more modern construction\r\nready mounted. The receptacle parts of the same are arranged and\r\nconnected in full agreement with the above mentioned except that the\r\nmotion is effected by the driving power fitted to the machine on the\r\nground on the left side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of this roller machine has long been applied in the\r\nbuilding of other types, and we find that these, variously altered,\r\nrenovated and improved, are to-day an indispensable equipment in every\r\nchocolate factory. In the following pages we give a description of some\r\nof the best-known constructions of refiner.\r\n\r\nThe so called battery rolling mills constitute a remarkable innovation.\r\nIt is apparent that the more rollers a cylinder machine contains,\r\nand the greater their length and diameter, all the more efficacious\r\nwill the working of the machine be. Batteries have accordingly been\r\nconstructed, whereby two, three or more roller systems are combined,\r\none to every three rollers, and rising one above the other, so that\r\nthey slant upwards much as shown in Fig. 40.\r\n\r\nAs the battery rolling mills possessed the disadvantages that they took\r\nup too much room and could not be well fed and regulated, they are\r\ngenerally replaced by rolling machines of from 6 to 9 rollers, first\r\nconstructed by J. M. Lehmann. These rolling machines of 6 to 9 rollers\r\nwhich we see before us in Figs. 35 and 36 are really systems of 3\r\nrollers fitted one over the other. They therefore take up the room of a\r\n3-roller machine and are quite as easy to work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41 a.]\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the design of a nine-roller apparatus, fig. 37,\r\nthe chocolate mass descends from one roller system to the other, and\r\nis fine rolled in a third of the time otherwise required, and at\r\none operation, with corresponding saving of labour. The nine roller\r\napparatus are provided with landing stage and steps, and fed either by\r\nmeans of elevators, or from above.\r\n\r\nFig. 38 shows a recent construction, three roller apparatus (case\r\ncastings, cf. below) standing vertically, which accordingly takes\r\nup little room. The hopper is low-lying, whilst the discharging\r\nis effected from the upper roller, and accordingly admits of the\r\noccasional use of a somewhat larger size of transport trolley. This\r\ntype also occurs with 6-9-12 rollers, as apparent from fig. 39.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41 b.]\r\n\r\nWhilst these systems were exclusively supplied with rollers made of\r\ngranite or hard porcelain up to a few years ago, it has been found\r\nthat good results are obtained by the use of cast rollers, and they\r\nhave been for some time employed on machines of three, four and five\r\nrollers. (Figs. 38, 40, 41 a-c.) In consequence of the non-porous\r\nsurface of these steel rollers, it is possible to grind to a finest\r\npowder, merely in one operation, without passing the chocolate through\r\nthe machine several times; and the so-called “Burning” of masses\r\nwhich have not been properly mixed cannot arise in this case, though\r\nit is true that the apparatus must be provided with water cooling\r\narrangements to avoid a too excessive heat. They are specially adapted\r\nto the preparation of the more ordinary qualities, and are even\r\noccasionally employed for finer chocolates, for obviously these must be\r\nagain submitted to a rolling process, when granite or porcelain rollers\r\nare preferred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41 c.]\r\n\r\nFor this reason the 6, 9 or even 12 roller mills have been more\r\ndiscarded since the last grinding process has been performed by granite\r\nrollers (cold process).\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the disadvantages of the pulley drive, it is in\r\ncertain cases advisable to drive each machine direct from an electric\r\nmotor.

But if the sugar exceeds 65 percent, it is no longer\r\npossible to mould these chocolates, and the addition of fresh cacao\r\nbutter becomes a necessary preliminary to this operation, cf. also\r\nthe first part in section IV. Such varieties would have a composition\r\nsomewhat like the following:\r\n\r\n  Cacao mass                     25 parts\r\n  Sugar                          67   \"\r\n  Cacao butter                    7   \"\r\n  Spices  and vanillin as above   1   \"\r\n\r\nIn the experimental preparation of samples of chocolate mass it is\r\nnot advisable to employ large quantities of ingredients, when a\r\nwaste of material is bound to ensue, but to begin with mixing small\r\nquantities of one or two kilos. The small Universal Kneading and Mixing\r\nMachines, Patent Werner & Pfleiderer, Type 1, Class BS, can here be\r\nused with advantage. They are specially intended for small outputs and\r\nexperimental work; but we shall return to their description later,\r\nafter stating that they are furnished with heating apparatus, stuffing\r\nboxes and air-tight lid, and can easily be taken to pieces, greatly\r\nfacilitating the removing of the mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Further Treatment of the Raw Chocolate.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. ~Manufacture of “Chocolats Fondants”~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\nRecently the creams sometimes described as in the heading have\r\nenjoyed a vast popularity, and are sold as eatable chocolates in\r\never-increasing quantities. As far as can be ascertained, they\r\nwere first manufactured in Switzerland, melt readily, and have a\r\ncorrespondingly large amount of fat, resulting from the addition of\r\ncacao butter, which distinguishes them from ordinary chocolates.\r\nWhen readily melting chocolates were first introduced, it was a\r\nprevailing opinion that the required property could only be obtained\r\nby increasing the amount of fatty content. Now the excessive evidence\r\nof fat in chocolates is very objectionable, both as regards taste and\r\ndigestibility. To avoid this, therefore, the chocolates are treated\r\nmechanically, to attain the required character of readily melting.\r\nThe machines used for that purpose are termed “Conches”, because the\r\ntrough, in which the chocolate is rubbed into a long cylinder, has\r\nsomewhat the shape of a long shell. For the working up of chocolates in\r\nconches, the necessary conditions are;\r\n\r\n 1. that the chocolate should have been ground perfectly fine,\r\n\r\n 2. it must contain such an amount of fat as to become glucose on\r\n warming, not indeed so thin as that used as coating material, but\r\n nevertheless softer than the ordinary cake-chocolate of good quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43 a.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\nThe machine can be heated by means of steam, hot water pipes, gas or\r\ncharcoal stoking, according as they are available in the place of\r\ninstallation, and the temperature should rise above 70-80° C. for\r\nfondants, and 50° C. for milk chocolates. In factories with water\r\npower or electricity, continuous fondant machines can be worked day\r\nand night, but when only worked during the day, must be kept warm\r\novernight. Constant tending of the machine is unnecessary, as it works\r\nautomatically. After a treatment of from 40-48 hours, the chocolate\r\nattains the requisite character (i.e. it melts readily), and a rounding\r\noff of taste, which are the properties of all good brands. Milk\r\nchocolates can also be advantageously prepared in the conche, as also\r\ncovering or coating cacaos of all kinds, which harden considerably in\r\nconsequence of this treatment.\r\n\r\nFigs. 43 and 43 a show quadruple conches of the modern type with hot\r\nwater, wherein four troughs are arranged in pairs, and one opposite the\r\nother. Conches with only 1 and 2 troughs are also constructed, and in\r\nvarious sizes, the troughs sometimes having a capacity of 125 and 200\r\nkilos, so that the quadruple conche is capable of holding five or eight\r\nhundred kilograms in all. The curved bottom of the troughs, as well as\r\nthe rollers fitted in them, are made of granite, and the front wall\r\nstrongly bent in at the corner, so that the mass is forced over the\r\nborder of the front wall, where there are openings for its discharge\r\nas well. To prevent radiation as far as possible, it is best that the\r\ntroughs be walled in, the troughs are either walled. Fig. 44 shows the\r\nroom of a modern chocolate factory, with 15 conches.\r\n\r\n“Chocolats fondants” are from a gastronomic point of view, the finest\r\nchocolate product on the market, and it is not remarkable that this\r\nbranch of the chocolate manufacture has witnessed a considerable\r\nextension, and is likely to extend still more.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. ~Heating chambers and closets.~\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of chocolate has been very considerably facilitated\r\nby the introduction of heating chambers and closets, which have now\r\nbecome an indispensable feature of every factory in the industry. In\r\nthese chambers the chocolate which has still to be rolled, as well\r\nas that already submitted to this operation, is stored and kept at a\r\ntemperature of 60° C. until it can be further treated (moulded). This\r\nmanner of heating involves an appreciable cheapening of the production,\r\nfor masses which are dry and apparently require an addition of fat\r\nrecover in such a manner during a twenty four hours’ storing in the\r\nheating chambers that such addition becomes unnecessary. But especially\r\nwhen chill casting rollers are employed, which the mass leaves in a\r\nvery dry state, the use of these heating chambers is indispensable.\r\nThey should be available in every factory to such an extent as to\r\nfind room for the total output of one day, though even twice or three\r\ntimes this amount might very well be provided for. Closets heated by\r\nsteam are best adapted for small factories, such as are illustrated\r\nin Fig. 45. They possess double doors, are walled in, and are capable\r\nof holding from 300-400 kilos of chocolate mass for each metre of\r\nlength. Larger factories should furnish themselves with chambers, which\r\nare more open to access and on the walls of which iron shelves can\r\nbe introduced, heated by steam pipes arranged underneath. A typical\r\nchamber, measuring 2·8 metres in breadth (including passage) and 5\r\nmetres in length would hold about 2,500 kg of chocolate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. ~Removal of Air and Division.~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\nAfter emerging from the final rolling process, the chocolate is stored\r\nup in heating chambers until it is ready to succeed to the moulding,\r\nprior to which, however, it must be freed from air and cut up into\r\nsmall portions. Until recently, it usually came next in a melangeur\r\nprovided with a dish-shaped bed-stone made of granite, as illustrated\r\nin fig. 46, where it was kneaded and reduced to a uniform plasticity\r\nand heated to the temperature required for moulding. The melangeurs\r\ndevoted to this purpose are now superseded by special tempering\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nA machine of this recent construction, used for working solid and\r\nsemi-liquid material, is shown in fig. 47. The tank intended as a\r\nreceptacle for the chocolate mass is in this case made of iron and, to\r\nfacilitate cleaning, smooth in the interior. It runs in a water-bath,\r\nthe supply in which can be controlled by steam or cold water. The\r\ngranite runner is provided with a lifting device, admitting of the\r\nworking up of material containing foreign ingredients like nuts, whole\r\nand fine-split.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.]\r\n\r\nThe mass is taken out of the machine in lumps, and in order that it\r\nmay be reduced to a temperature suitable for the removal of air (about\r\n26-32 ° C. on the outside) it is laid to cool on wooden, marble or iron\r\ntables. When this temperature is arrived at, large lumps of chocolate\r\nare introduced either into the air-extracting or the dividing machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\nAfter the importance of the tempering processes had at length been\r\nrecognised, inasmuch as the maintenance of the temperature prescribed\r\nis of immense influence on the chocolate subsequently produced, and it\r\nhad on the other hand been ascertained that such machines as described\r\nabove could not be absolutely relied upon, for the shaking tables\r\ninvolve an occasional excess of tempering, the idea of a machine which\r\nshould completely and automatically perform this task was finally\r\nconceived. This new machine, given in fig. 48, and already differing\r\nfrom all other tempering machines in external appearance, ushers in an\r\nentirely fresh process respecting the _modus operandi_ prevailing in\r\nthe present manufacture of chocolate, which does not fail to satisfy\r\nthe highest expectations. It may be said to work continuously, for no\r\nmatter what the temperature of chocolate passing into it may be, the\r\nmaterial leaves the machine at the temperature desired within a lapse\r\nof one minute. According as more or less chocolate has to be turned\r\nover in the moulding department, the machine can be stopped or set\r\nin motion without detriment to its efficacy. Besides this, it cleans\r\nalmost automatically, so that a quick change of quality is always\r\npossible. The special virtue of this machine is that it turns out the\r\nmaterial with such a degree of homogeneity as has never before been\r\nknown, making moulding at much higher temperatures a possibility. There\r\nis yet another side issue, namely a doubling of the life of the moulds,\r\nand finally, owing to the fact that the often considerable amount of\r\nwaste material is done away with in this process, the moulding shop\r\nis spared to some extent. The series of rollers through which the\r\nchocolate passes is maintained at a proper temperature by means of\r\nautomatic water apparatus. The daily output of the machine figures at\r\n3000-4000 kilograms. The material is passed on out of this machine to\r\nthe dividing and moulding processes.\r\n\r\nThe necessary extraction of air follows immediately on the tempering\r\nprocess, for the blades of the scraper then release the chocolate mass\r\nfrom the rollers in thin layers, between which air penetrates. The\r\nremoval of air is effected by machines, an old type of which is shown\r\nin fig. 49 (in front elevation).\r\n\r\nIt can be warmed by means of a charcoal fire placed in the space =i=,\r\nor by any other suitable means. The chocolate mass is fed into the\r\ncylindrical hopper =a=, at the base of which occurs an archimedian\r\nscrew =b=, which is propelled by the shaft and cog-wheel system =c d\r\ne= in the direction indicated by the arrow. Thus the chocolate mass is\r\nforced into the box =f=, leaving which in cylindrical form, it succeeds\r\nto the travelling band =h=. It is now almost entirely freed from air.\r\nAs the material is pushed forward on the band, it is cut off either by\r\na knife =g= fixed to the box =f=, or divided as far as possible into\r\nequal parts by a double knife with adjustable blades corresponding\r\nto the weight required for a chocolate square. This manipulation\r\npresupposes a fair amount of skill on the part of the machinist, but\r\nthis once attained, the division ensues as precisely and simply as can\r\nbe desired.\r\n\r\nAir-extracting machines of recent construction, although still\r\npartially built on the above principle, are at the same time generally\r\ndeveloped as automatic dividing machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.]\r\n\r\nFig. 50 shows such a machine for solid and semi-liquid chocolates. By\r\nmeans of this, the material is next conducted along a vertical screw\r\npath in even mass to the horizontal screw, and so a second filling with\r\nthe hand is rendered unnecessary. After it has been freed from air in\r\nthis, it enters a revolverlike cutter, which discharges the divided\r\nportions on a travelling belt. On the latter it is conducted to a table\r\nstanding near, where it is laid into moulds. The machine is of very\r\nstrong make, and puts out from 15-250 gr, divided into approximately\r\n10-25000 squares, within a space of ten hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51 a.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 51 a and b give finally two of the best known types which have\r\na very extensive application, protected by patent imperial (Germany),\r\nand built by J. M. Lehmann, Herm. Baumeister, J. S. Petzholdt in\r\nDöhlen, G, near Dresden and others. With this patent dividing machine\r\nof J. M. Lehmann, solid and semi-liquid chocolate material, as also\r\nnut and almond chocolates are divided exactly, in any weight from 18\r\nto 250 grammes, and then conducted in strips of equal size to the\r\nmould previously mentioned. As far as cleanliness, purity, and easy\r\nmanagement are concerned, it fulfills all the demands which can be\r\nexpected of the most modern machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51 b.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Moulding of the Chocolate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\n11. ~Transference to the Moulds.~\r\n\r\nThe pieces of chocolate, on emerging from the dividing processes, are\r\nplaced separately in iron moulds, that is to say, as far as this has\r\nnot already been done in the dividing machine. It is important that\r\nthese should have the same temperature as the chocolate mass, in order\r\nto prevent the formation of spots on the surface of the cakes, and to\r\nobtain a good and non-greyish fracture. The temperature for moulding\r\nsmaller objects can be fixed at between 27° and 32° C. and for the\r\nlarger may be considerably lower. In summer also, moulding may be\r\nproceeded with at a lower temperature than in winter. According to a\r\nnote in the Gordian (1895, No. 4) the moulding may be carried out in\r\nsummer, when the atmospheric temperature is;\r\n\r\n  from 25-31° C, at 26-27·5° C\r\n    \"  18·5-25° C, at 28·5-30° C\r\n    \"  12·5-18·5° C, at 31-32·5° C\r\n\r\nIn cold weather, the cakes may be moulded at a temperature of from\r\n32·5-35° C., according to their thickness. When not manufactured in\r\nthe automatic machine shown in fig. 48, the mass should be otherwise\r\ncontrolled as regards temperature, which should be registered by a\r\nthermometer introduced therein. The moulds are for the most part\r\nfilled with plastic and liquid chocolates, and their depths determined\r\nand modified by the weight of material which they are destined to\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\nFig. 52 shows a machine which conducts the semi-fluid mass to the\r\nmoulds in the following manner. The moulds are automatically introduced\r\nunder the apparatus, and filled from the small stirrer above. They then\r\nsucceed to the shaking table and are finally transported to the cooling\r\nroom. On this machine moulds of from 75-350 mm long and 75-225 mm broad\r\ncan safely be employed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are two different forms in which chocolate is sold, namely, that\r\nintended for domestic purposes, and that which is to be consumed as an\r\narticle of luxury. The kinds known as cake, rock and roll chocolate\r\nbelong to the first class, the several pieces weighing 50, 100, 200,\r\n250, 500 up to 5000 grammes. Tin-plate is the only material of which\r\nmoulds are made; and these generally have a capacity rather greater\r\nthan is necessary for holding the particular quantities to be moulded.\r\nThe chocolate is therefore, as described above, divided into given\r\nweights, and generally deposited direct in the moulds by the dividing\r\nmachine. The divided portions of chocolate are pressed down in the\r\nmoulds by hand, equally distributed in the latter, and then transferred\r\nin the moulds to the shaking table or combination of shaking tables\r\nto be described later. On the shaking table the soft chocolate soon\r\npenetrates completely into all the corners and impressions of the\r\nstamped tin moulds. The removal of the cooled cakes from the moulds is\r\neasily effected by pressing.\r\n\r\nThese moulds are generally provided with from four to ten ridges or\r\nindentations, so that the chocolate can be conveniently divided, and as\r\nrequired for use. Others again have a similar number of compartments.\r\n\r\nThe compartments may be impressed with any kind of inscription, so that\r\nsuch information as the name of a firm can always be reproduced on the\r\ncakes.\r\n\r\nBroken chocolate is generally of inferior quality, brought on the\r\nmarket without any protective covering.\r\n\r\nIn those kinds of chocolate which are known as articles of luxury a\r\ndistinction is to be made between;\r\n\r\n1. Those moulds which are in one piece and completely filled with\r\nchocolate, so that the superfluous mass can be removed by a knife. In\r\nsuch cases the weight of the cakes is exactly regulated by the capacity\r\nof the moulds.\r\n\r\n2. Those intended for moulding various figures of fruit etc. in which\r\ntwo or three parts make a closed space which is of the form desired.\r\n\r\nAmong the moulds of the first type must be numbered those used in the\r\npreparation of small tablets and sticks, and the sweetmeats known as\r\nNapolitains and Croquettes.\r\n\r\nThe second class comprises moulds for making chocolate cigars and\r\nchocolate eggs, and also the double moulds.\r\n\r\nThe moulds for the smaller tablets, cream sticks, napolitains and\r\ncroquettes are also made exclusively from tin-plate, and the separate\r\nparts are enclosed in a stout iron frame, the top of which is ground\r\ndown smooth, so that any superfluous portion of the filling can easily\r\nbe scraped away. In that way from six to thirty pieces can be cast in\r\none mould at the same time: the cooled chocolate can be released from\r\nthe moulds by gently tapping one corner against a table. In napolitain\r\nmoulds protecting hooks are attached, to avoid their sustaining any\r\ninjury in this operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of the more frequent moulds.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ~Chocolate Cigars.~\r\n\r\nThese are made either by introducing the chocolate mass between the\r\ntwo halves of a double mould, of which each corresponds to a half of\r\nthe cigar shape to be moulded and which each fit exactly one on the\r\nother; or else by pouring it into hollow moulds stamped out of one\r\ncomplete piece. Moulding presses[117] are utilised in the manufacture\r\nof material ~en masse~. In these the cigars are filled into\r\niron moulds, afterwards held together by means of iron combs, and so\r\nintroduced in to the press. For each size and shape special moulds\r\nand plates are essential. Neither barium sulphate nor zinc white may\r\nbe employed to produce an imitation of the ash on ordinary cigars, as\r\nboth are objected to by health inspectors; nor are they necessary, for\r\nin phosphate of lime (tricalcium carbonate) we possess a perfectly\r\nharmless and at the same time efficient substitute, when it is mixed up\r\nwith starch syrup.\r\n\r\nOther figures, such as fish etc., may also be produced in chocolate, by\r\nmeans of the moulding press, when it is furnished with stamped moulds,\r\ncorresponding to the forms required.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ~Chocolate eggs.~\r\n\r\nThese are generally made hollow, unless they are very small, by\r\npressing chocolate in two halves of an egg-shaped mould and then\r\nuniting the two parts. Another method patented by Th. Berger of\r\nHamburg[118] seems less practical. A mould is made of soft sheet\r\ncaoutchouc blown out; this is dipped into liquid chocolate and, after\r\nthe adhering coating has hardened, the air is let out of the mould. The\r\nuse of caoutchouc moulds would render this method too costly, since the\r\nalternation of temperature soon makes the caoutchouc unserviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ~Various figures, fruits, animals, and other small objects.~\r\n\r\nDouble moulds are used for making these objects in chocolate,\r\nconsisting sometimes of three or four parts; they are made either of\r\nsheet iron, tinned, or, for more complicated forms, the moulds are cast\r\nin tin, but these latter are not so durable as those of tinned sheet\r\niron with strong iron frames.\r\n\r\nThe several parts of the moulds, after having soft chocolate mass\r\npressed into them, are put together and excess of material is removed\r\nby requisite pressure by the use of a press of the kind made by A.\r\nReiche in Dresden, which will admit of a large number of moulds\r\nbeing placed in it at a time. By the use of such a press the moulds\r\nare protected from injury, and the objects moulded have a better\r\nappearance, as a result of the uniform as well as strong pressure\r\nexerted.\r\n\r\nAfter cooling, the moulded objects are readily detached from the moulds\r\nand they only require to be scraped clean, or further ornamented as may\r\nbe desired. That is done in various ways, for example by painting with\r\ncoloured cacao butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. ~Crumb Chocolate.~\r\n\r\nThis term is applied to the small pieces of chocolate of truncated\r\nconical shape, with from 4 to 5 smooth surfaces. They are made by\r\na machine specially constructed for the purpose by A. Reiche (No.\r\n1550); it consists of a four-cornered box with a removable bottom.\r\nInside the box there is a false bottom, from 1 to 2 cm above the other\r\nbottom, which is fitted with a removable sheet iron plate, in which\r\npentagonal holes are stamped. A knife can be introduced at one corner\r\nof the bottom of the box. After sufficient chocolate has been made to\r\npenetrate through the pentagonal holes by agitating the box on the\r\ntable, the knife is rapidly drawn across the bottom and the box raised\r\nup. The sheet iron plate is then taken out, and by gently tapping one\r\ncorner the small pieces of chocolate are shaken out.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ~Small tablets, sticks, fruits or figures filled with cream.~\r\n\r\nThese are prepared by pouring the cream contents in either wooden or\r\niron moulds, previously dusted with a little flour, and then moulding\r\nround them chocolate in whatever form is required, always taking care\r\nthat this is kept as soft and plastic as possible, a suitable addition\r\nof cacao butter proving invaluable for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn former times chocolate moulds were manufactured exclusively in\r\nFrance, where the firm Létang of Paris enjoyed what was to all\r\nintents and purposes a world monopoly. But since the year 1870 the\r\noft-mentioned firm of Reiche in Dresden-Plauen has taken up the\r\nmanufacture, and has succeeded in conquering the market in a remarkably\r\nshort time. The moulds of this firm satisfy each and every possible\r\nrequirement, although it would be no disadvantage if the old type of\r\npattern mould were cleared away at one and the same time with the old\r\nroutine, to make room for a little artistic skill and embellishment.\r\n\r\nRecently Reiche has brought out a special machine intended as an easy\r\nand practical cleanser of his many moulds, which include bonbon cutters\r\nand cutting rollers, numbering stamps, chocolate slicers, roller\r\nmachine boxes etc. He has lately brought on to the market a special\r\nmachine for quickly and efficiently cleaning the moulds, which is\r\nillustrated in fig. 53.\r\n\r\nIn one end, a circular brush is introduced, and against this the moulds\r\nto be cleaned are firmly pressed. In consequence of the large number of\r\nrevolutions which this brush passes through, the moulds are cleansed\r\nof still adhering masses of chocolate in a half or third of the time\r\noccupied when hand labour is employed. At the other end of the shaft\r\noccurs a duster, sprinkled with Vienna white (a lime), which polishes\r\noff the moulds previously and thoroughly cleaned by the circular brush.\r\nThe great advantage of this machine is that the daily expenditure on\r\npolishing is considerably reduced One girl can do the work of two hand\r\nworkers, when this machine is employed. In addition, it makes possible\r\na continual touching up of the material used in the making of the\r\nmoulds, a ventilating apparatus removing all traces of dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. ~The Shaking Table.~\r\n\r\nThe pasty chocolate mass fills itself into the chocolate moulds\r\nspontaneously, in consequence of its soft consistency. Yet to share it\r\nevenly throughout the mould, so that it adapts itself to every bend\r\nand hollow there occurring, and further to bring to the surface any\r\npossible bubbles of air evident in the mass, the chocolate is whilst\r\nstill in the moulds subjected to brisk shaking.\r\n\r\nThis is effected by placing the chocolate on trays and transferring\r\nthese to the shaking table, of which types and construction are at the\r\npresent time manifold and various, the best and oldest being given in\r\nfront elevation below (Fig. 54).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\nThe movable slab =a=, fitted with an upright rim at its edges, has\r\nunderneath two projecting pieces =d=, working against deeply toothed\r\nwheels =e=, which fastened on the shaft =b=, are driven round by the\r\npulleys =c=. The teeth of the wheels catch on the projecting pieces at\r\nevery revolution of the shaft and push them rather gently on one side,\r\nand when the tooth-points slide from under the slab, it drops down as\r\nmuch as it has been previously raised. Each tooth of the wheel coming\r\ninto contact with the projections, the same motion is repeated several\r\ntimes, causing the slab to oscillate up and down.\r\n\r\nThis oscillation of the slab is controlled by means of a hand lever\r\n=f=, occurring on the shaft =g=, and fixed crosswise thereon, so that\r\nwe can only show it in cross section on the diagram. The lever =f=\r\nattaches itself to the under part of the slab, raises it, and so throws\r\nthe wheels out of contact with the projecting pieces, but without\r\nstopping the rotation of the shaft =b=.\r\n\r\nShaking tables have also witnessed considerable improvements with the\r\nlapse of time, and we shall now proceed to treat these in more detail,\r\nespecially as several recent constructions offer and illustrate many\r\ninteresting mechanical points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.]\r\n\r\nAn old type of machine, that is nevertheless still much employed, is\r\nillustrated in fig. 55. Here the slab is caused to osculate by shaking\r\nwheels introduced underneath, each possessing six, eight, or more\r\nteeth. The slab is raised and lowered by contact with wedge-shaped\r\nparts, the effect produced being greater or less according as the\r\nmoulds are large or small, heavy or light, and in proportion to the\r\nconsistency of the chocolate mass which they contain, e. g. whether it\r\nis solid or semi-liquid.\r\n\r\nQuite an improved construction is shown in fig. 56. Here the table\r\nis attached to a vertical axle, which is moved up and down by means\r\nof a toothed wheel fixed on its bottom end. There is also a cylinder\r\narrangement under the whole machine to assist in controlling the\r\nvertical motion of the shaft, and as it is provided with automatic\r\nlubrication, there is no danger of any wearing out of the apparatus and\r\nconsequent irregularity of functioning.\r\n\r\nThe shaking and jerking of the slabs is in itself attended by a\r\nconsiderable amount of noise, and when to this is added that caused by\r\nthe tables, it will be seen that a chocolate factory may become to its\r\nneighbours a very serious source of objection. For years attempts have\r\ntherefore been made to construct shaking tables, so that they would\r\nnot cause any greater noise than is absolutely inevitable. Pneumatic\r\ncontrivances and caoutchouc have met with right royal success in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nThe most recent and probably the most perfectly constructed shaking\r\ntable is given in figs. 57 and 57 a. It embodies all the latest\r\nimprovements and is self lubricating, a fact of the highest importance\r\nas releasing the strain on the attendance, which would need to be very\r\nperfect to ensure absence of noise in the case of a machine making\r\n800 strokes a minute. When it is considered that the moulding room\r\nis generally managed by girls who neither possess knowledge of, nor\r\ninterest in, the machines, the advantages of such automatic lubrication\r\nbecome even more apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57 a.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 58 and 58 a.]\r\n\r\nApart from the automatic lubrication, in itself a sufficient guarantee\r\nfor the efficiency of the machine, screws and nuts are entirely avoided\r\non this machine. The motive mechanism is also interesting. By a special\r\narrangement, the number of revolutions in relation to the number of\r\nthe elevations of the slab is reduced to one fourth, viz., from 760 to\r\n190. Since the elevation of the slab can be regulated to zero, a loose\r\npulley for shifting the driving belt is unnecessary; in addition, the\r\ndriving shaft makes only a small number of revolutions, and works in\r\noil. The round shaped upright serves to carry the vertically moving\r\nframe =i=, which supports the slab moving in an oiled groove at =s=,\r\nand which is supported underneath by the pivot =m=. Both at =m= and\r\n=s= there is automatic lubrication. The bearings of the spindle\r\n=n=, attached to the upright, work into left and right screw threads\r\nat =oo=, to which points the ends of a broad leather belt =p= are\r\nattached, passing over the roller =g=, by which the frame =i= is\r\nsuspended. The driving pulley =k=, running in oil, carries in its\r\ncentre the four rollers =l=, which turn round and round the pulley =k=,\r\nso as to come into contact with the belt =p= and press it outwards on\r\nboth sides. At the same time it shortens the belt in the vertical axle,\r\nso raising up the table slab =i=. This is repeated four times by one\r\nrevolution of the driving pulley, so that working with 190 revolutions\r\na minute, the slab is raised 760 times. According as the screws =oo=\r\nare moved to or from the centre, the vertical movement of the slab can\r\nbe increased or decreased to a point when the slab is completely out\r\nof action, i. e. when the rollers l no longer touch the belt =p=. Under\r\nfavourable local conditions, a number of such tables can be driven by\r\none shaft, so that only one pulley and a single driving belt would be\r\nneeded, though each table would work quite independently of the others.\r\nSuch an arrangement is shown in figures 58 and 58 a.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58 b.]\r\n\r\nThis shaking table, though only recently introduced, has quickly made\r\nitself popular, and is especially suitable for the preparation of\r\nreadily liquefiable chocolate. The gentle vibratory motion produced by\r\nthis shaking table and its exact adjustability admit of the thinnest\r\ncakes being made in a perfectly uniform thickness, without any\r\nobjectionable projections round their edges. Besides the shaking tables\r\nof this construction there are others made in such a way that whether\r\nthe moulds are light or heavy, small or large, the slab is always\r\nraised to the same height, the working of the slab being adjusted by\r\naltering the number of revolutions. The manipulation of these tables is\r\nmuch more difficult than that of tables constructed as above described,\r\nand that is probably the reason why these have for decades been scarce\r\non the market.\r\n\r\nThe moulded chocolate spread out on trays is transferred as rapidly as\r\npossible to the cooling chamber, with which we shall conclude section\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nInstead of several shaking tables alternately receiving the moulds,\r\nwhich involve frequent changes, so-called shaking systems (fig. 58b)\r\nhave been generally adopted of late. They consist of a number of\r\nshaking tables, having their frames attached to each other, possessing\r\na common motor control, and having their slabs arranged one after the\r\nother in such a way that the filled moulds slowly proceeding from the\r\ndividing machine can be automatically conducted over them. The shaken\r\nmoulds are then passed on to further processes, or they enter the\r\ncooling chambers at once. The advantage of the shaking table system\r\nlies in a reduction of the number of hands, who only need to be in\r\nattendance at each end of the system, and further in the regularity,\r\nboth as regards time and strength, which prevails in connection with\r\nthe shaking of each mould.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. ~Cooling the chocolate.~\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the more rapidly the moulded chocolate is\r\ncooled the finer is its texture and the more uniform the appearance of\r\nthe fractured surface. That is due to the formation of smaller crystals\r\nof the fat when the cooling is rapid, while in slow cooling larger\r\ncrystals are formed and the fracture consequently becomes dull and\r\ngreyish.\r\n\r\nFormerly it was possible to distinguish chocolate made in summer from\r\nthat made in winter by the more uniform appearance of the fracture,\r\nthat was, in the latter case, the result of more rapid cooling.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, manufacturers are no longer dependent upon\r\nfavorable atmospheric conditions in that respect, for by suitable\r\narrangements it is now possible to produce the reduced temperature\r\nrequisite by artificial means.\r\n\r\nThe most suitable cooling chamber is an underground space which should,\r\nhowever, be so situated as to be in convenient communication with the\r\nmoulding room. The cheapest and simplest place for a cooling chamber\r\nis a cellar, if it be properly constructed and dry, as well as large\r\nenough to contain the quantity of chocolate made in one day’s working.\r\nThe best temperature to be kept up ranges from 8° to 10° C. Within\r\nthose limits there is no danger of the chocolate being coated with\r\nmoisture, or that it will acquire a coarse grained texture by lying too\r\nlong. The following rules will serve for guidance in regard to this\r\npoint:\r\n\r\nGenerally, chocolate presents the finest fracture when it has been\r\nfully levigated and when it contains a considerable amount of fat,\r\nprovided that the fat present is only cacao butter. Those kinds which\r\nare not so well levigated, or have had some addition of foreign fat\r\nof higher melting point, show an inferior fracture. It is possible to\r\nobtain an equally vitreous fracture in a less cold cellar (16° C. and\r\nupwards) when the chocolate is moulded at a temperature corresponding\r\nto that of the cellar; to effect that, the chocolate should be moulded\r\nat a proportionally lower temperature the warmer the cellar is. The\r\ndifference can be seen by the appearance of pale red spots on the\r\nsurface. When it is desired to dispense with artificial cooling, the\r\ncellar should be as much as possible below the surface of the ground;\r\nit should also be of sufficient height, not less than 3 m. If the\r\nsituation and height of the cellar be properly adjusted, the requisite\r\narea for disposing of a daily production amounting to 5000 kilos\r\nwould be 400 sq. m. The cellar must be well ventilated and furnished\r\nwith double windows, so placed as to open towards the north and east.\r\nDischarges of warm waste water, as well as steam pipes or furnaces\r\nshould be kept as far distant from the cellar as possible. The internal\r\narrangement of the cellar should be of such a nature that the whole\r\nof the chocolate to be cooled can be deposited upon the floor, since\r\nthat is the place where cooling takes place most rapidly. With that\r\nobject in view it is desirable to construct brickwork pillars about 25\r\ncm high, covered with white tiles. Passages are arranged between these\r\npillars. The cellar should be entered by as few persons as possible\r\nand, therefore, the cooled cakes of chocolate should be taken at once,\r\nin the moulds, to an adjoining room to be turned out and passed on to\r\nthe packing room and store.\r\n\r\nMost of the existing factories, that have been established for any\r\ntime (large and small) have had to adopt artificial means of cooling,\r\nbecause in most instances the quantity of chocolate to be cooled daily\r\nhas, in course of time, increased tenfold. The machine rooms have been\r\nenlarged, the number of machines has also been increased, while the\r\ncooling cellar has remained in its formerly modest proportions. But\r\nthose circumstances are not the only reasons for having recourse to\r\nartificial refrigeration, which is often necessary in consequence of\r\nthe inconvenient situation of the cellar and the high underground water\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nIn the application of artificial refrigeration in a chocolate factory\r\nit is not advisable to hasten the cooling of large quantities by\r\nproducing too low a temperature in small chambers. The cakes of\r\nchocolate mass by that means come out of the moulds as hard as glass,\r\nbut it is questionable whether the consumer using the chocolate many\r\nmonths afterwards, will make the same observation. Great care would\r\nhave to be taken with such rapidly cooled chocolate, to pass it\r\ngradually through chambers of a medium temperature and thus prepare it\r\nfor exposure in the packing rooms and warehouses. Even when employing\r\nartificial means for cooling, the reduction of the cellar temperature\r\nand cooling upon pillars is to be preferred to the more direct\r\ncooling upon a system of pipes, which after all is nothing else than\r\na cooling upon ice, as may be in some instances the only alternative.\r\nConsequently, a well constructed cellar for cooling, furnished with a\r\nsystem of cooling pipes on the roof is perhaps the most advantageous\r\narrangement, especially for large factories.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out artificial refrigeration various kinds of machines are\r\nused for reducing temperature, in which the desired effect is produced\r\neither directly by the condensation and evaporation of suitable\r\nmaterials, such as liquid carbonic acid, ammonia, sulphurous acid, or\r\nindirectly by making saline solutions (calcium chloride), cooled below\r\nthe freezing point, circulate through a system of pipes fitted on the\r\nroof or walls of the space to be cooled. As the cold liquid is pumped\r\nthrough the pipes, it takes up heat from the air in contact with them,\r\ncorrespondingly reducing the temperature of the cooling chamber. The\r\ncooling installations of the firm of C. G. Haubold, junior, Chemnitz,\r\nare among the best and have long been extensively used in the chocolate\r\nindustry. Their cooling apparatus is a compressing machine, in\r\nwhich coolness is obtained by the evaporation and recondensation of\r\nsuch liquid gases as carbonic acid or ammonia. Like all compressing\r\nmachines, it is comprised of three main parts.\r\n\r\n I. The evaporator or refrigerator, consisting of a wrought iron\r\n system of pipes. The latter are placed in the spaces of the plant\r\n to be cooled, with a so-called direct evaporation arrangement, and\r\n are either arranged on the walls and ceiling, or built in a special\r\n chamber as dry or moist air coolers, according to the quality of the\r\n chocolate to be cooled, or the use for which it is destined. Whilst\r\n in the former case cooling is effected directly in the rooms, in the\r\n latter the air of the cooling room is conducted to the air coolers by\r\n means of ventilator, in order to be cooled and dried there, and then\r\n again introduced in the chamber.\r\n\r\n II. The compressor, a gas suction and pressure pump, working both\r\n simply and complex, which draws the refrigerating medium out of the\r\n evaporator, compresses it, and forces it along to the condenser.\r\n\r\n III. This condenser consists of a coil of wrought iron or copper\r\n pipes, which are enclosed in a barrel and are often described as\r\n the immersion condenser. There is another type, in which the pipes\r\n are united to one or more pipe-walls, introduced in a vessel which\r\n collects and drains off the condensations. In both cases the coil of\r\n pipes is played upon by a continual stream of water, in order that the\r\n gases which they contain may be condensed. The immersion condenser is\r\n generally employed when there is a plentiful supply of cheap water\r\n at hand, and the other in contrary cases. This latter condenser is\r\n provided with a separate liquid “after-cooler”, constructed on analogy\r\n with the before mentioned immersion condenser. The counter current\r\n principle holds good in both types, and admits of a better using up of\r\n the cooling water. The liquid gas then passes on to the evaporator,\r\n where it is responsible for further refrigeration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59a.]\r\n\r\nThe refrigerator also occurs in the form of a brine cooler. In this\r\nconstruction the evaporating pipes are likewise enclosed in a barrel,\r\ncontaining a high percentage of salt brine. In consequence of the\r\nrefrigerating apparatus occurring on the interior of the pipes, the\r\nbrine contained therein is cooled down to a very low temperature,\r\npumped along to the cooling chambers, and after delivering its alloted\r\nrefrigeration unit re-conducted to the cooling apparatus, where it is\r\nonce more subjected to the same series of processes.\r\n\r\nA well-known arrangement for such artificial refrigeration is that\r\nconstructed by Wegelin & Hübner at Halle o. S., in which carbonic acid\r\nis employed, and it has been found well adapted for use in chocolate\r\nfactories. The accompanying illustrations figures 59 a and 59 b\r\nrepresent an arrangement of that kind in which the cooling is effected\r\non cooling trays judiciously arranged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59b.]\r\n\r\nThe refrigerating machine is constructed on the carbonic acid gas\r\ncompression system; it consists of 1. the compressing pump =a=, 2. the\r\ncondenser =b=, and 3. the system of pipes =c= and =d=, that constitute\r\nthe refrigerator. The coil of pipes in the refrigerator is connected\r\nat one extremity with the compressing pump and at the other extremity\r\nwith the condenser. Liquid carbonic acid passes from the condenser\r\ninto the coil of pipes and is there evaporated. The heat necessary\r\nfor that change is withdrawn, either directly or indirectly, from the\r\ncooling chamber and from the chocolate placed in it, until the desired\r\nreduction of temperature is brought about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.]\r\n\r\nThe compressing pump =a= is a peculiarly constructed suction and\r\npressure pump, it draws out of the refrigerating pipes the vaporised\r\ncarbonic acid by which they have been cooled and then subjects it to a\r\npressure which helps to effect its reconversion into the liquid state.\r\n\r\nThe condenser =b= consists of a coil of pipes over which a current of\r\ncold water is kept flowing and the compressed carbonic acid vapour,\r\npassing from the compressor into these pipes, is there cooled and\r\ncondensed by the surrounding water, so as to be transferred back to\r\nthe refrigerator through a valve fitted to it for that purpose. The\r\nouter vessel of the condenser is constructed of cast-iron, in one piece\r\nwith the compressor frame. These cooling arrangements are constructed\r\neither with or without mechanical ventilators. In figures 63 a and 63\r\nb the compressing pump and condenser are represented as placed on the\r\nground floor, while the refrigerator is situated in the cellar space\r\nlying beside them and at a lower level, in such a manner that both the\r\nsystems of cooling pipes are not situated upon the roof of the cellar,\r\nbut run along it at regular distances parallel to the side walls of the\r\ncellar. The compressor and condenser form one apparatus and the former\r\nis driven by a steam engine.\r\n\r\nIn the cooling cellar, the refrigerator is generally fixed to the walls\r\nin such a way that the warm chocolate, taken into the cellar, can be at\r\nonce placed upon the stages formed by the system of cooling pipes, and\r\nso there is some advantage in having the system of cooling pipes fitted\r\nalong the roof of the cellar.\r\n\r\nThe machine which is diagrammed in fig. 60 possesses an hourly\r\noutput of some 70000 calories, measured in salt water at -5 ° C. The\r\ncompressor is driven directly by an electric motor, and a stirring\r\napparatus is put in motion by the crankshaft of the compressor, the two\r\nbeing connected by an intermediate gearing.\r\n\r\nWegelin and Hübner put out cooling plants with salt water cooling,\r\nsmaller and medium sized plants are on the contrary provided with\r\nso-called direct evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe diagram in fig. 61 shows an air-cooler as built of late by Esher,\r\nWyss & Co. for chocolate cooling plants.\r\n\r\nThese air coolers are especially used for direct evaporation of\r\ncarbonic acid gas. They consist of three groups of ribbed wrought-iron\r\npipes, the whole constituting a system supported in a frame work of\r\nU-shaped and angular iron. The separate tubes are welded and bent\r\ntogether. The ribbed bodies are in themselves square shaped, and apart\r\nfrom the tube opening have a nozzle introduced in their centre, which\r\npressed firmly against the press pipe effects a favourable transmission\r\nof heat in the case of large surface areas of the support, the more so\r\nas the tubes are square shaped.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous advantages of this machine can be numbered the\r\nabolition of the refrigerator and brine pump, prompt and instantaneous\r\nrefrigeration when the machine is started, and ease of control, as a\r\nflange connection occurs immediately in front of the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\nA wrought iron trough is fitted up underneath the air-cooler to catch\r\nthe water drops. Above, and to the left, the three systems of the\r\nair-cooler are connected by means of a catch.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground of the illustration is given a miniature of the\r\nribbed tube system, which very clearly illustrates the arrangement of\r\nthe separate ribs.\r\n\r\nA ventilator not apparent on the diagram conducts air to the tubes in\r\nthe cooling chamber, and these present a considerable cooling area,\r\nin addition to which, the air-stream taking a parallel direction,\r\nresistance to its passage is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nAnother method of cooling[119], that is carried out in France\r\nconsists in placing the moulds, containing cakes of chocolate, upon a\r\ntravelling belt running horizontally through the whole length of the\r\ncooling chamber. The requisite reduction of temperature is effected\r\nby apparatus similar to that described above in Wegelin & Hübner’s\r\narrangement. The liquefied carbonic acid flows through a system of\r\npipes fitted to the roof of the cooling chamber, producing by its\r\nvaporisation the necessary cooling and then it passes back to the\r\nrefrigerating machine. Circulation of the air in the cooling chamber is\r\nprovided for by a suitable ventilator under the pipes of the cooling\r\nsystem, gutters being fixed to carry away any water condensing upon\r\ntheir surface and prevent it from falling upon the chocolate. The\r\ntravelling belt passes along so slowly that the moulds, containing\r\nchocolate, placed upon it at one end, take from ten to fifteen minutes\r\nin passing to the other end where they are taken off and carried to the\r\npacking rooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.]\r\n\r\nAnother cooling arrangement that works very well is constructed by T. &\r\nW. Cole of the Park Road Iron Works, London E.; figure 62, represents\r\na plan of this arrangement, which has the great advantage of providing\r\nfor the exclusion of moisture from the cooling chamber. Refrigeration\r\nis effected, by means of Cole’s Arctic-Patent Dry Cold Air machines, by\r\ncompressing atmospheric air and then allowing it to expand, after being\r\ncooled by water and having moisture removed by suitable arrangements.\r\nThe machine is of very solid construction; it works at a pressure of\r\nfrom 70 to 80 atmospheres and drives the dry cooled air through a\r\nsystem fitted in the cooling chamber where the chocolate is spread\r\nout, either on portable trucks or on a travelling belt, so that it\r\nremains in the chamber long enough to become perfectly cold. The system\r\nof cooling can be changed in various ways. The sudden removal of the\r\ncold chocolate into another chamber where the air is moist, would be\r\nattended with a deposition of water upon the goods. For that reason\r\nthe goods are first transferred, for a short time, to a warm chamber\r\n(ante-room) where they acquire a temperature at which no deposition of\r\nmoisture can take place. The chief advantage of this arrangement is\r\nthat it furnishes dry cold air economically, both in summer and also\r\nin a moist climate. Cole guarantees that this machine will effect a\r\nrefrigeration of 5 ° C.; according to the statement of Messrs. Negretti\r\nand Zambra the cooled air contains only 40 % of moisture. The cold\r\nair from one of these machines can be led, by a well insulated run\r\nof pipes, to any part of the factory and thus be made available for\r\ncooling purposes in different places.\r\n\r\nThe cooling plants hitherto described may be classified as “Space\r\nCoolers”, because in each case a special compartment of the cooling\r\nchamber must be utilised. The increased prices of estate constitute no\r\nmean objection to such a system.\r\n\r\nA critical valuation of these plants brings out a few undisguisable\r\ndeficiencies. A large proportion of the cold is lost in the chamber\r\nitself, before it has been of any avail; and then again the rooms are\r\ngenerally insufficiently, sometimes even not at all, insulated from\r\nadjacent and warmer chambers, which once more involves raising of\r\nthe low temperature essential in the process.[120] Detrimental also\r\nis the presence of the personnel, the illuminations, and many minor\r\ninfluences. It is evident that the larger the output required the\r\nlarger must the cooling chamber be, involving corresponding economical\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nWith the recognition of these evils arose the problem of their\r\nabolition. The aim was to employ small chambers and avoid loss of cold\r\nair. It is now solved by a system already used in many and various\r\nindustries, namely, cooling in closets. Larger or smaller closets\r\nmay be employed, as required, and in consequence of their thorough\r\ninsulation may even be introduced into the warmest rooms. Their\r\nprinciple is maximum efficiency with minimum occupation of space, and\r\navoidance of loss of cold as far as possible. In consequence of this\r\nlatter aim, the refrigerators in this case can be constructed on a\r\nsmaller scale than those destined for an equal output of material,\r\nwhich are fixed up in cooling chambers; or they may be larger, which\r\nis yet more important, for the efficiency of the machine under\r\nconsideration can be considerably increased by connecting it with one\r\nof the closets.\r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of cooling chambers, those which transport the\r\nmoulds automatically, and those which contain layers where the moulds\r\nare placed one over another. Both types are cooled by the circulation\r\nof air, so effected, that cooled air currents are sucked up by a fan\r\nout of a tubular system fitted underneath a horizontal partition,\r\nand then forced along to the chambers above, where they are evenly\r\ndistributed over the rows of sheet-iron, laden with moulds, or where\r\nthey play upon the travelling belt which transports the moulds out of\r\nthe cooling chambers. The air passes once more into the tube chamber\r\non the opposite side, where it delivers up the warmth it has in the\r\nmeantime acquired, to enter finally the same system of circulation as\r\nbefore. The general temperature of the closets is a mean between 8 °\r\nC. and 10 ° C., and the cooling lasts from 20-40 minutes, according to\r\nthe strength and size of the tablets. As the temperature never goes\r\nlower than 8 ° C., it is impossible for the tablets to become moist\r\nwhen exposed to the warmer outer atmosphere. Fig. 63a shows a Cooling\r\nChamber built by J. M. Lehmann, which is adapted for a daily output of\r\nsome 1000 kilos, and divided into compartments one above the other.\r\nThe sections of this chamber, which in the illustration plainly shows\r\nthe small amount of space required for its erection, are divided by\r\nvertical cross-partitions into four compartments, each of which is\r\nprovided with a shelf or stand to take a charge of 10 cooling trays,\r\nand accessible by three spring-doors, thus giving as small apertures\r\nas possible and reducing the loss of cold when charging to a minimum.\r\nIn addition to this, each compartment is fitted with a contrivance for\r\nregulating and, if necessary, completely cutting of the draught. The\r\nposition of the system of pipes is shown by the two pipe-ends to which\r\nit is connected. On the opposite side, or front of the chamber, is the\r\nfan-drive, either a small electric motor, or shafting. The perforated\r\ncooling trays are visible through the open doors. The sides of the\r\nchamber consist of two layers of wood with thick slabs of cork between\r\nthem. All chambers of this system, including those with automatic\r\nconveyance of the moulds, can be taken to pieces for transport, the\r\nsingle pieces afterwards only requiring to be fastened together again\r\nwhen erecting the chamber.—The chamber illustrated serves for cooling\r\nmoulded chocolate. For pralinés and the like similar chambers are\r\nsupplied, which are, however, smaller and lighter in construction.\r\n\r\nFig. 63b represents a cooling chamber with forced air circulation\r\nand automatic conveyance of the moulds, built by the same firm. This\r\nchamber, which, owing to the travelling belt conveying the moulds, is\r\nof considerable length, is nowhere connected with the outside air; the\r\nwhole manipulation of the moulds is carried on through small adjustable\r\nopenings at the points where the travelling band enters and leaves\r\nthe chamber. The band consists of chains in links on to which wooden\r\nlaths are screwed and its speed can be regulated to suit the size of\r\nthe tables to be dealt with. The width of the belt and chamber can at\r\nany time be varied to suit the place of erection and correspond with\r\nthe length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63 a.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63 b.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63 c.]\r\n\r\nAs is to be seen from the illustration, this cooling chamber requires\r\nthe minimum of attendance and thus complies with the principles lately\r\nadopted in all large factories, in which the tendency is to substitute\r\nas much as possible mechanical appliances for manual work. It will\r\nbe seen from the preceding chapters that this tendency is especially\r\nmarked in the moulding department, where automatic tempering,\r\nmoulding and mould-filling plants and shaking tables have already\r\nbeen introduced. In order to utilise fully such automatic plants the\r\nlast link in the chain only was wanting, namely, a suitable means of\r\ntransferring the moulds from the shaking tables to the cooling chamber\r\nand through the latter to the demoulding and packing room. The purpose\r\nof the cooling chamber above described is to fill up this gap, and its\r\nproper place is thus ranged in among the automatic machinery described.\r\n\r\nThus it is that many modern factories have united the above machines to\r\nform a single working plant, as shown by Groundplan Fig. 63c.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Special Preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\na) ~Chocolate Lozenges and Pastilles.~\r\n\r\nThese chiefly consist of cacao mass, sugar and spices. Formerly they\r\nwere made by placing the semi-liquid chocolate material on a stone\r\nslab, furnished with a rim of uniform height which served to regulate\r\nthe thickness of the goods manufactured, and then rolling out the mass\r\nas required. The lozenges were punched from the rolled-out layer by\r\nmeans of a cutter. After allowing the mass to cool, these lozenges were\r\ndetached from the remaining portions, which were then rolled again and\r\nthe same process repeated.\r\n\r\nPastilles, on the surface of which impressions of varying import, such\r\nas figures, names, firms etc. are required, may also be manufactured by\r\nplacing the soft chocolate mass upon tin-plates in which depressions\r\noccur corresponding to the device desired. A roller is employed to make\r\nthe material fit into the depressions, and superfluous chocolate is\r\nremoved with a knife.\r\n\r\nThese impressions come out especially fine, when the pastille moulds\r\nare subjected to a shaking on the tables with which we are already\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.]\r\n\r\nYet these processes are becoming obsolete, and the chocolate slabs\r\nor plates are at the present time superseded by the two forms of\r\napparatus constructed by A. Reiche, which we accordingly describe below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.]\r\n\r\nIn the first of these simply constructed machines, fig. 64, the\r\nmaterial oozes through perforations in a square sieve-like arrangement,\r\nat length issuing on the sheet-iron plate fitted underneath. The\r\nprocess is aided by repeated shaking, and when sufficient chocolate has\r\npenetrated to the plate, the box is raised on its hinge and chocolate\r\nmass left ready for further treatment. By gentle additional shaking,\r\nthe still irregular heaps are rounded off to perfection; they are now\r\ncooled down and finally detached. The coating of the lozenges with\r\ncoloured sugar grains is effected by passing them, together with the\r\nplate to which they still adhere, through a box containing sugar dust.\r\n\r\nThis machine is scarcely used now; in its place come the two\r\nconstructions of A. Reiche, as already stated, the one being intended\r\nfor solid material, and the other for semi-liquid chocolate mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.]\r\n\r\nBy means of his pastille machine Nr. 14091, which we give in Figs. 65\r\nand 66, chocolate lozenges of the most diverse size can be prepared\r\nvery rapidly and to advantage. The chocolate material, which in this\r\ncase is solid, is pressed through perforations in a metal plate and\r\notherwise treated as in previous cases.\r\n\r\nIn working with this machine, it must be previously and sufficiently\r\nwarmed, then partially filled with chocolate material of a proper\r\nconsistency (not more than 75 % of the total capacity may be utilised).\r\nIt is highly important in the preparation of lozenges that the material\r\nshould neither be too hard nor too plastic, but strike a just medium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.]\r\n\r\nBefore pressing down the plunger, worked by a screw, a metal plate\r\nis laid upon the chocolate to prevent contact with the plunger. By\r\nslight pressure, the chocolate mass is forced through the perforations,\r\naccording to the required size of the lozenges, but the plunger must\r\nnot be screwed down further. This will admit of the plate on which the\r\nlozenges rest being drawn out and another inserted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.]\r\n\r\nTo this machine belong the usual perforated plates _f_, Fig. 66 of\r\nwhich there are three of different sizes for each machine, as shown by\r\nfigures _a_ _b_ _c_, also the plates _d_ used for making the perforated\r\nconfections which find their way to the Christmas Tree. These plates\r\nare impressed with larger or smaller designs, and so make two different\r\nsizes of goods possible. A third plate is supplied for the manufacture\r\nof whole pieces (various varieties of chocolate croquette).\r\n\r\nThe machine works smoothly and noiselessly and delivers excellent\r\nproducts. If instead of the usual plain lozenges, such with the name of\r\na firm or other device are desired, the corresponding impressions must\r\nbe stamped out on the plate in which the chocolate is received after\r\nbeing forced through the perforations. See fig. 66, g, h, i.\r\n\r\nFig. 67 illustrates the pastille machine Nr. 14 178 for thin\r\nchocolate mass, constructed by A. Reiche (German Patent 227 200).\r\nIt resembles the foregoing apparatus in principle and appearance,\r\nbeing only distinguished by a different aim, namely the treatment\r\nof thin material. Used in conjunction with the peculiar moulds also\r\nmanufactured by the same firm (marked “Durabula”), even the deepest\r\nimpressions can be effected with an enormous saving of time and\r\nmaterial and in a most practical manner, as will be seen on comparing\r\nfigs. 69 _a_ to _d_.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the full value out of this machine, some little\r\npractice is necessary on the part of the workman in charge. But\r\npossessed of an average amount of skill, he can soon turn out with this\r\napparatus ten times as much as can be made with the ordinary type of\r\nlozenge machine.\r\n\r\nFor a favourable accommodation of the different pastille plates,\r\nthe hurdle diagrammed in fig. 68 (by A. Reiche) is quite excellent.\r\nIt is manufactured out of one complete sheet of steel, is free\r\nfrom any suspicion of soldering, and entirely galvanised. It thus\r\noffers a strong guarantee as regards wear and tear. It may also be\r\nadvantageously employed as a transporting device.\r\n\r\n\r\nb) ~Coated chocolates, pralinés etc.~\r\n\r\nThese delicacies are now held in high esteem, and of late the\r\nconsumption of pralinés and cheaper forms with imitative contents has\r\nincreased very considerably.\r\n\r\nThe designation praliné (properly pronounced prahlin) has been applied\r\nto sugar-coated almonds and is derived from the name of a cook in the\r\nemploy of Marshal du Plessis, which was Pralins. This “chef” belonged\r\nto the age of Louis XIV. and was the first to make these sweetmeats.\r\nBut now the term is applied to sweetmeats of various forms, soft\r\nfruit-sugar, marmalade, cream, nut-paste etc. respectively enveloped\r\nin chocolate. The special formulae employed in the preparation of\r\ndifferent kinds of pralinés are comprised in the confectioner’s art,\r\nand do not need to be dealt with here.\r\n\r\nThe substances themselves are called fondants. Formerly the sugar was\r\nboiled, placed upon a slab, and there manipulated with a spatula, an\r\noperation difficult to manage, indeed almost impossible in the last\r\nstages. In consequence of the increased demand for such preparations,\r\nmachines were introduced several years ago whereby the operation is\r\nmechanically performed. Such a machine is shown in fig. 70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.]\r\n\r\nThe bed-plate as well as all the working parts of the machine are\r\nconstructed of stout copper. The working parts admit of being raised\r\nor lowered by means of the hand-wheel above, and they remain fixed\r\nwhilst the bed-plate turns and its underside is played upon by water.\r\nThe machine is capable of working up pure fondant without any syrup\r\naddition, as well as that made up with syrup. The boiled sugar is\r\npoured on the bed-plate of the fondant machine, cooled down from 10-20\r\nminutes according to the syrup content, and to such an extent that the\r\nmachine can be set in motion, whilst the working parts are gradually\r\nlowered to the previously mentioned bed-plate. The sugar poured out\r\nis then cooled by means of the action of a ventilator fitted on a\r\ncrossbeam, occurring in the middle of the wooden cooler, and working\r\nin conjunction with the ventilator, in consequence whereof a cooling\r\ncurrent of air is brought to strike the hot sugar centrally.—When pure\r\nsugar is used, the fondant is finished within six minutes, but in the\r\ncase of a syrup addition the time required is lengthened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.]\r\n\r\nA quite recent type of fondant machine is given in fig. 71. It achieves\r\nits end by employing an air-current and a cylinder with screw, which is\r\nprovided with water cooling apparatus. The _modus operandi_ presents\r\nmany and obvious advantages, chief among which is the possibility of\r\nconducting new material to the machine uninterruptedly, and further the\r\npreservation of the flavour of the chocolate worked up. The result is\r\na production of first-class quality in respect to taste and flavour,\r\nwhich is quite ready to be passed on to the next processes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.]\r\n\r\nThe fondant is then diluted with colouring matter in boiling pans,\r\nand so prepared for subsequent treatment. The figures which have to\r\nbe poured in are then transferred to gypsum moulds, lined with starch\r\npowder, and the fondant sugar is in its turn poured over these either\r\nby means of pans held in the hand or such as are machine-driven.\r\nHand-pouring postulates a considerable amount of skill on the part of\r\nthe man in charge, especially when even weights of the separate pieces\r\nare required. We annex an illustration of a motor-driven depositing\r\nmachine (fig. 72).\r\n\r\nThe sugar is here introduced into receivers heated by means of a\r\nwater-bath. The receiving boxes are moved under the outflow one\r\nafter another, after having been dusted with powder and filled with\r\nchocolate, whilst the adjustment of the weight of each separate piece\r\nis effected by the operation of a very ingenious mechanism, even from\r\n0-8 grammes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.]\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of several hours in the drying room, the molten figures\r\nare so hard that they can be raised out of the powder with the aid of\r\na shovel. Fig. 73 shows such a machine, whilst Fig. 74 illustrates a\r\nmachine where the work goes on unbrokenly, and from which the chocolate\r\nfigures are removed with a shovel.\r\n\r\nThe sweetmeats are next dipped into liquified chocolate (covering\r\nstuff) to coat them with a layer of that material. The mass employed\r\nfor this purpose must contain up to 15 % more butter than that used\r\nfor ordinary chocolate, so that it may be kept soft long enough for\r\ncontinuous working.[121] This is performed in the machine fig. 75. On\r\na bed-plate coming into contact with steam or cold water, as required,\r\noccur rake-like stirrers, and a small ventilator introduced above\r\nassists in cooling off the material. For the purpose of discharging,\r\nthere is an outlet on the rim of the pan. For storage of the tempered\r\ncoverings and also for occasional alleviations with cacao butter, a\r\nmachine illustrated in fig. 76 is utilised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.]\r\n\r\nThe dipping of pralinés for the purpose of coating them was formerly\r\ncarried out by means of a fork, the nucleus masses being dropped into\r\nthe coating material, taken out with a fork, and placed upon metal\r\nplates. Various kinds of ornamentation were designed by the same\r\ninstrument. In the preparation of the higher priced coated fondants,\r\na similar method of procedure is still in vogue, although such\r\nmanipulation presupposes a high degree of skill on the part of the\r\nmechanics are at the machine. For articles of more general consumption,\r\nwhether ornamented or not, machines have been introduced for the\r\npurpose by divers manufacturers, some of which function excellently.\r\nTwo of that kind which in every way respond to the calls made on them\r\nare here described, but we shall not waste time and labour over the\r\nmore complicated and expensive machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.]\r\n\r\n The first method of coating fondants, patented by A. Reiche of\r\n Dresden-Plauen, is not based on mechanical principles, but rather\r\n relies on a series of small appliances, represented in fig. 77. The\r\n jacketed casing _a_, fig. 77 contains water, and into it the pan\r\n containing coating material can be placed: that is kept in a liquid\r\n condition by heating the water in the jacket by spirit lamps or gas\r\n jets underneath. The adjoining vessel _b_ is closed on all sides,\r\n filled with water, and also kept warm in the same manner; it serves\r\n for the preparatory warming of the objects to be coated, which are\r\n spread upon a wire network, and for that purpose two of these wire\r\n frames can be hung upon the hooks inside the box. The mass dropping\r\n from the wire frame is conveyed into the covering box _a_, by means\r\n of a sheet of metal placed above it; _c_ serves as an apparatus for\r\n turning, and we give it on a larger scale in fig. 78.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.]\r\n\r\nThe tracings _h_ and _i_ in fig. 79 show the cross section and top view\r\nof the wire gratings, on which cylindrical and ball-shaped sugar goods\r\nare deposited. The other two kinds of grating are illustrated at _L_\r\nand _M_ (fig. 80).\r\n\r\nThe size of the meshes of the sieve gratings depends on that of the\r\ncentres to be coated.\r\n\r\nThe method of covering is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe centres for the pralinés etc. are placed in the cavities of the\r\ngratings, and, as soon as one of the gratings is full, the latter is\r\ncovered up by the fine-meshed grating the half of the cross-section of\r\nwhich is shown in Fig. 79 and the full view in Fig. 80 (see K and N\r\nrespectively), K representing the cover-grating.\r\n\r\nBoth gratings are held simultaneously by the operator at their handles\r\nand then dipped together in the liquid covering contained in the vessel\r\na, Fig. 77, after which the superfluous covering mass is removed by\r\nknocking. The gratings are now deposited on the mechanism C, Figs.\r\n77 or 78, as the case may be, the top sieve removed and a sheet of\r\npaper or a metal plate put in its place. It is then turned by hand to\r\nthe opposite side, the grating with the impressions is removed and\r\nthe cover centres are found lying in regular order, and at regular\r\ndistances apart, on the metal plate. The object of the intervals\r\nbetween the covered centres is to prevent the running together of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.]\r\n\r\nBeans and rings are only dipped up to the middle, and the process\r\nrepeated with the other half of the centre after the first half has\r\ncooled. This ensures a pleasing, round appearance, and has further\r\nthe advantage that the cover grating need not be put on during the\r\noperation. When dipping cylindrical or ball-shaped centres, the grating\r\nK which has first been removed on dipping, is at once transferred to\r\nthe heater, to prevent it cooling and withdrawing too much warmth from\r\nthe covering material at the next immersion.\r\n\r\nThe dipping of pralinés etc. is exceedingly easy if the new type of\r\ndipping machine is used, a full view of which is given in Fig. 81\r\nand which has the highly appreciable advantage of simultaneously\r\ncooling the dipped centres. All the parts are, in the main, worked\r\nby hand, only the shaking and stirring contrivances and the cooling\r\nfan requiring to be driven by motor power. The middle piece carries\r\nthe actual dipping apparatus, underneath which the tank holding the\r\ncovering chocolate is fixed, while the lefthand sidepiece serves for\r\nfeeding; as many as four operators can be engaged simultaneously at\r\nthe latter, the work consisting of laying the centres in the gratings\r\ncorresponding to the mouldings desired. The construction of these\r\ngratings is, in the main, similar to the stamped trays of Anton Reiche,\r\nbut they are not provided with handles and are despatched along the\r\nguide-rails by hand. The filled grating is then placed in a frame,\r\nwhich is dipped by means of a winch into the liquid chocolate. The top\r\ngrating on the dipping frame is adjustable, and the object of this\r\ngrating is to keep the centres down, as without this arrangement some\r\nof the centres might rise to the surface of the covering. The top\r\ngrating is, before commencing to dip, pushed over the filled grating\r\nwith the centres and is thus immersed with them. The frame having been\r\nremoved, the shaker is put in action to remove the superfluous material\r\nfrom both the gratings and the centres. The grating is drawn out\r\nafter use from below the top grating and transferred to a book-shaped\r\nejector, on one side of which is a metal sheet covered with paper. The\r\nwhole of the centres are then discharged on to the sheet, by reversing\r\nthe two flap-sections.\r\n\r\nThe sheet containing the covered centres is then transferred to the\r\ncooling apparatus at the right, in which it is gradually lowered on a\r\n“paternoster” apparatus by turning round a handle. It is then conducted\r\nto the left by an endless band, and finally discharged in a cooled\r\nstate by the machine. The ventilator should be supplied with air from\r\nthe cellars and is arranged to blow it out in the opposite direction to\r\nthe goods in the cooling apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.]\r\n\r\nThe shape of the design-gratings is reproduced in high relief on the\r\ngoods, and it will therefore be readily understood that further designs\r\nor fancy shapes can be made on the gratings. For the production of\r\nsemi-dipped goods or such as are dipped round and remain uncovered at\r\nthe bottom, a device is attached to the striking gear which renders\r\nit possible to regulate the depth of each immersion at will. The tank\r\ncontaining the covering material is surrounded by a water-jacket,\r\nwhich is heated by steam. The heat of the water is indicated by a\r\nthermometer. The receptacle containing the covering can easily be drawn\r\nout towards the front. In addition to this, the whole of the outside\r\nof the machine, which also constitutes a complete water-jacket, is\r\nheated by steam, and finally the ejector. The gratings containing the\r\nimpressions are taken out of the ejector after use and transferred to\r\nthe feeding side to be used again, so that, at the very most, four\r\ngratings are required for each design.\r\n\r\nThe daily output of the machine is 300-600 kilos, and the size of the\r\ngratings 280 by 400 millimetres, the output naturally depending on\r\nwhether the machine is operated by two, three or more persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. The Manufacture of Cocoa Powder and “Soluble” Cocoa.\r\n\r\n\r\na. The various methods of disintegrating or opening up the tissues of\r\ncacao.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively high fat content of pure cacao, which would deter\r\ncertain persons, especially those suffering from stomach disorders,\r\nfrom taking it, has given rise to the now extensive demand for a cacao\r\npreparation containing a less amount of fat and the constituents of\r\nwhich are capable of being easily assimilated in the human organism. At\r\nthe same time the desire to obtain a cacao preparation easily capable\r\nof complete and uniform suspension in milk or water may have played\r\nits part, as this quality, in consequence of which the preparation can\r\nrapidly and without difficulty be rendered ready for consumption, is\r\nobviously a great advantage. The best way to obtain this appeared to\r\nbe the pulverisation of the cacao, which, when reduced to a powder,\r\nmore readily satisfies the above conditions. As, however, it was not\r\npossible to pulverise cacao which still contained its full amount of\r\nnatural fat, it became necessary to devote attention to the operation\r\nof extracting the cacao butter. It is many years since the first\r\nappearance of certain preparations in Germany which went under the name\r\nof “Cacogna”, and which had been deprived of their fat to the extent\r\nof 20-25 %. This problem, however, was recognised and attempts and all\r\nmanner of experiments made to solve it at a much earlier period in\r\nHolland. The founder of the well-known Dutch firm of J. C. van Houten\r\n& Sons in Weesp, Mr. C. J. van Houten, was the first to attempt the\r\nexpression of the fat from cacao (1828) and to treat it with chemical\r\nagents with a view to opening up or bringing about the disintegration\r\nof the tissues, in order to render the cacao a fit and welcome article\r\nof food, not only for healthy persons, but also for invalids and\r\nconvalescent persons.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Dutch cocoa thus manufactured had been introduced\r\ninto England and Germany, where, as well as in Holland, it became very\r\npopular, that manufacturers in Germany and Switzerland began to devote\r\ntheir attention to the treatment with chemical agents. The consumption\r\nof so-called “soluble” cocoa has increased to such an extent of late\r\nyears that it is now almost as large as that of chocolate goods.\r\n\r\nThe term “soluble”, as now generally applied to cocoa powders, is\r\nundoubtedly a misnomer, inasmuch as such preparations are practically\r\nnot soluble at all. We have therefore termed cocoa for drinking\r\npurposes in this book “disintegrated” cacao, as the processes described\r\nin the following pages only render the elements of cacao, as, for\r\ninstance, the cellulose, capable of suspension in liquids. It would be\r\nquite impossible to render cacao, by any special treatment, soluble\r\nin the real sense of the term, as is the case with salt or sugar. It\r\nwill thus be readily understood that the expression “disintegrated” is\r\ncorrecter and more logical than the term “soluble The degree to which\r\ndisintegration has been carried, i. e. the efficiency of the opening-up\r\nprocesses adopted, is marked by the absence of any sediment worth\r\nspeaking of in the beverage prepared with boiling water, even after it\r\nhas been left standing some time. The greater the power of suspension\r\nof the preparation, the less particles of cacao will settle to the\r\nbottom, and the higher the beverage will be esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe disintegrating agents are, in practice, applied either to the raw\r\nor roasted, but otherwise untreated beans, or to the more or less\r\ndefatted cacao, as follows:\r\n\r\n a) by treating the cacao with hot water, without or under pressure;\r\n\r\n b) by treatment with alkalis, such as carbonate of kali or\r\n sodium, carbonate of magnesia (Dutch method), spirits of ammonia\r\n (sal-ammoniac) and carbonate of ammonia (German method).\r\n\r\nThe chemical and physical effects brought about by these agents consist\r\nchiefly in the swelling or steeping of the cellulose by the action\r\nof the alkalis, as a consequence of which they sink less rapidly in\r\nliquids than would be the case with untreated cacao. A further effect\r\nis the partial neutralisation of the acids present, besides which the\r\ncacao-red or pigment is also attacked, a result which may be regarded\r\nas less desirable, as the cacao-red is the secreter of the aroma, which\r\nnaturally suffers with it. If the cacao is treated with steam or hot\r\nwater, the starch is apt to gelatinise, and the acids to begin to\r\nferment.\r\n\r\nAs the treatment with steam, for the reasons given above, is nowadays\r\nrarely practised, we will at once proceed to consider the method of\r\ndisintegrating cacao most in use. Modifications of the methods of\r\nmanufacture bearing on this point will be dealt with in their place\r\nunder the corresponding heading later in this book.\r\n\r\n\r\nb. Methods of Disintegration.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ~Preliminary Treatment of the Beans.~\r\n\r\nThe method of manufacture of disintegrated cocoa comprises the\r\nfollowing operations:\r\n\r\n  a) The cleaning and sorting of the raw bean;\r\n  b) Roasting;\r\n  c) Shelling, breaking and grinding;\r\n  d) Treatment with alkalis or water;\r\n  e) Expression of the fat or cacao butter;\r\n  f) Pulverising.\r\n\r\nThe order of the above processes is subject under certain conditions\r\nto various modifications arising from the fact that the alkalis are\r\napplied at various stages in the course of manufacture, i. e.:\r\n\r\n  I. before roasting;\r\n  II. during roasting;\r\n  III. after roasting,\r\n\r\nand further\r\n\r\n  a) before pressing;\r\n  b) after pressing (treatment of the defatted beans).\r\n\r\nThe cleaning and sorting of the raw beans, or, in short, the complete\r\ntreatment to which the raw cacao is subjected (a to c) is in all\r\nmethods effected by the same machines, a description of which has been\r\ngiven on pages [Transcriber’s Note: Rest of line missing]\r\n\r\nSome manufacturers proceed at once to treat the cacao with alkali on\r\ncompletion of the above operations.\r\n\r\nC. Stähle[122] effects the disintegration of cacao by subjecting the\r\nbeans to the chemical action of a mixture of ammonia and steam, at a\r\ntemperature not exceeding 100 Deg. C. The next process (roasting) is\r\nthen supposed to draw out the ammonia introduced into the material,\r\nwhich, being volatile, easily escapes, and enables the flavour to\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nPieper[123] moistens the raw beans with water, to which alkali has\r\nbeen added, and this has the effect of neutralising the acids present\r\nin the bean; afterwards the beans are fermented, dried and roasted.\r\nThe fermentation is described as rendering the particles of albumin or\r\nprotein bodies easily digestible and further imparts to the beans a\r\nfine, reddish brown colour. This process is therefore nothing but an\r\nafter-fermentation of the cacao under the influence of alkalis. From a\r\nscientific point of view, the process does not possess the advantages\r\nwhich Pieper claims for it, with the exception of the really evident\r\nimprovement in colour. This effect can, however, be obtained equally\r\nwell by suitable treatment with water alone.\r\n\r\nG. Wendt[124] has patented a method of improving the colour and\r\nfacilitating the disintegration of cacao, in which the beans are\r\ntreated, before roasting, with lime water and milk of lime (lime\r\nsolutions) and further washed with the solution during roasting.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the methods of disintegration by means of fixed alkalis\r\n(carbonate of magnesia, potash and sodium) first employed by the Dutch,\r\nconcerning which the following description will be useful.\r\n\r\nThe cleaned beans are first very superficially roasted, to facilitate\r\nwinnowing, and the cacao thus treated (half roasted cacao) broken\r\nas small as possible, which is an equally important factor in the\r\nshelling and winnowing processes. It should be observed here that the\r\nless the cacao has been roasted, the finer it should be broken. The\r\nmaterial is then impregnated by one of the above-mentioned alkaline\r\nsolutions, which is sprayed on to the beans. The chief agent employed\r\nis potash (carbonate of potassium) in the proportion of 1½-2 (3 at\r\nthe outside) parts of potash to 20-30 parts of water, for every hundred\r\nparts of the defatted material to be treated. Some manufacturers use\r\nsodium or a mixture of sodium and carbonate of magnesia in place of\r\nthe potash. As soon as the cacao has been uniformly impregnated by the\r\nalkaline solution, the roasting process should be completed. Still more\r\ncare should be devoted to the roasting of cacao for pulverising than is\r\nrequired in the case of eating chocolates, as taste and smell play a\r\nmore important part and the point of complete roasting is not so easily\r\nrecognised. The cacao being roughly broken and the shells removed, the\r\nsecond roasting process must of course be conducted over a low fire.\r\nThe most suitable machines for this purpose are the large roasting\r\nmachines illustrated on page 93, Fig. 14, as in these machines there\r\nis little possibility of over-roasting, even when dealing with large\r\nquantities and the machine is intensely heated; another advantage is\r\nthe easy accessibility of the roasting drum, which can be immediately\r\nexposed by removing the front cover, for cleaning; cleaning is very\r\nnecessary in roasting machines. Broken and moistened cacao chars\r\nmuch more readily than raw beans which have not been deprived of\r\ntheir shells. If it is not possible to thoroughly clean the interior\r\nof the roasting drum, as is often the case with spherical roasters,\r\nthe particles of cacao remaining in the drum continually undergo\r\nre-roasting, finally falling in a completely charred state into the\r\ncacao, thereby greatly prejudicing its taste.\r\n\r\nIf necessary, the cacao can now be passed through the breaking machine\r\nagain, from which it is transferred to the triple cacao mill, which\r\nprovides for fine grinding. The material is then deposited in heated\r\npans (see page 117, Fig. 27) where it remains until ready for the next\r\nprocess, the expression of the fat. The object of the fine grinding\r\nin the mill is to render the cacao on being ground again after the\r\ndefatting process, easily capable of being sifted, and to obtain a\r\npreparation which, on being mixed with hot water, leaves as little\r\nsediment as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ~Expression of the Fat.~\r\n\r\nHydraulic presses are nowadays exclusively used for this most important\r\noperation in the manufacture of “soluble” cocoa. The methods of\r\npressing have, in common with the other operations in the course of\r\nmanufacture, undergone considerable modification and improvement.\r\n\r\n According to Macquer (see Mitscherlich, S. 58) the butter was\r\n extracted during the last century by pulverising the seeds, boiling\r\n them in water and cleansing the fat, which, on cooling, congealed on\r\n the surface of the water, by re-melting. According to Desprez (see\r\n Mitscherlich, S. 58), burned, shelled and finely pulverised beans were\r\n spread to a height of 12-15 inches on coarse linen or canvas, which\r\n was spanned across a vessel containing boiling water, to expose the\r\n fine powder thoroughly to the action of the hot vapour. The powder\r\n was then pressed, in linen bags, between two tin plates, whereby some\r\n 50% of pure cacao butter was obtained. At a later period the heatable\r\n hydraulic pot-presses came into use. The mass had, however, to be\r\n introduced into these pots tied up in a cloth or sack, to facilitate\r\n which it was previously treated with water, forming a thickish syrup\r\n very convenient for pressing. All these methods, however, were\r\n attended with the great disadvantage that the cocoa, after being\r\n stored some time, acquired a grey colour, or became mouldy. To avoid\r\n these undesirable results presses were constructed which rendered\r\n it possible to liquefy the mass without any further treatment in the\r\n receptacle in which the pressing was conducted. Such a press, likewise\r\n acting hydraulically, is shown in Fig. 82 on the opposite page.\r\n\r\nThis machine exerts a total pressure of 320000 kilogrammes and works\r\nwith 400 atmospheres. The construction of the machine is similar to\r\nthat of the well-known types of presses used by oil manufacturers for\r\nthe preparation of vegetable oils. When pressing, however, the pots\r\ncontaining the cacao must be rendered water-tight both at the top and\r\nbottom, to prevent the liquid cacao from escaping, while such provision\r\nis not necessary in the case of the oil presses. The stopping up of the\r\npress-pots is effected by means of a side-handle, and arrangements are\r\nprovided for heating the pots both from above and below. The machine\r\nillustrated has 4 pots, arranged one above the other, which can be\r\ndrawn out on guide-rails towards the front of the machine. During\r\npressing, they close telescopically with the piston arranged underneath\r\neach pot. The pump which supplies the water for the hydraulic pressure,\r\nworks perfectly automatically, increases the pressure according to\r\nthe quantity of fat which has run off and keeps the pressure at its\r\nmaximum or at any degree required. With these presses it is possible\r\nto extract, without difficulty, 85 % and even more of the total fat of\r\nthe cacao bean. If pressing is carried on at too high a temperature,\r\na pale, whitish grey butter is the result. If, however, a little\r\nattention is paid by the operator at the press, the butter obtained is\r\nusually perfectly clear, as it is first conducted through a horse-hair\r\npad covered with linen, or a camel-hair cushion 15 millimetres in\r\nthickness. Sufficient attention is not always paid to the operation\r\nof pressing, so that it often happens that some of the cacao escapes\r\nwith the butter, which is especially the case if the pressure has been\r\nincreased too rapidly at the beginning. If the butter is extracted\r\nfor use in the factory itself, the escape of the cacao with it is of\r\nno serious consequence; if, however, the butter is intended for sale\r\nfor commercial purposes, its appearance is a most important factor,\r\nwherefore it is advisable to filter the impure fat immediately after\r\npressing. It is true that, in most factories, the butter is in such\r\ncases merely remelted to allow the impurities to settle to the bottom,\r\nthis part being then submitted again to the same treatment, while\r\nthe rest of the butter is disposed of on the market. If filtering is\r\nnecessary, the butter filter should be used, which, first constructed\r\nin Holland, has been in use for a long time there. The principle of\r\nthese filters is to pass the butter through hanging tubes made of a\r\nfiltering material similar to flannel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.]\r\n\r\nThe firm of Volkmar Hänig & Co. constructs special cocoa butter filters\r\nwhich can be obtained through the firm of J. M. Lehmann. Figs. 83 and\r\n83a show this type of filter (cross and vertical section), the manner\r\nof working with it being the following:\r\n\r\n As soon as the butter has passed through the hair sieve in the upper\r\n part of the apparatus, which removes larger objects such as pieces of\r\n wood etc., it enters the hanging filter tubes, which, to facilitate\r\n cleaning, are interchangeable. The filter butter accumulates in\r\n the large space provided for the purpose and is withdrawn through\r\n a tap. An observing glass is attached to the apparatus for the\r\n purpose of watching the height of the butter, and the whole filter is\r\n water-jacketed, the water being heated by a steam coil fixed in the\r\n bottom of the apparatus. A thermometer is fixed to the side of the\r\n filter, for regulating the temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 83 and 83 a.]\r\n\r\nThe degree to which cocoa powders should be defatted is an important\r\nquestion which, some years ago, formed the subject of much\r\ncontroversy. The relation between the percentage of fat contained in\r\nthe original cacao kernel, the expressed butter and the defatted cacao\r\nmass is shown in tables 19 and 20.\r\n\r\nThe taste of defatted cacao is, as is well known, all the better for\r\nbeing defatted to a low degree, and it is this which constitutes the\r\ngreat advantage of cocoa prepared according to the Dutch method, the\r\nremaining cacao content of which is some 24-33 percent, so that,\r\ntaking 50 percent as the average quantity of fat contained in the\r\ncacao, only about 34-52 percent of the whole is removed from the mass.\r\n\r\nIf the expression of the butter is carried to a further degree, the\r\ncacao will certainly become more easily capable of suspension in\r\nliquids[125], but such treatment is detrimental to its flavour[126],\r\nwhich is apt to become woody or bitter.

and would-be connoisseurs,\r\nthat the bitter taste peculiar to the acid produced in cacao during\r\nfermentation is the real aroma of the cacao, is undoubtedly erroneous.\r\nIt could, in the same way, be said of tea and its acids, the bitterer,\r\nthe better; which would of course end in the destruction of the true\r\nflavour. Equally erroneous is the theory that bitter cacao is more\r\nconsistent. Such cacao must, previous to consumption, either be more\r\nsweetened than usual or, if the same quantity of sugar is put in, less\r\nof the beverage can be taken. When, for instance, very thin coffee\r\nis made, the beans, on colouring an abnormally large quantity of\r\nwater, are said to be stronger, i. e. to yield more. The consistency\r\nof all such beverages is, however, only a matter of taste, and it\r\nwould therefore be useless to discuss the subject in detail; some\r\npersons prefer strong tea, which has been brewed a quarter of an hour,\r\nothers simply pour boiling water over the tea leaves and then drink\r\nthe beverage immediately. It may, however, safely be taken that the\r\nhighest amount of butter which can be expressed from cacao without\r\nprejudicing the flavour of the finished powder is 66 percent of the\r\ntotal fat content. Manufacturers nowadays try as a rule to express as\r\nmuch butter as possible, as the butter has a high price on the market,\r\nand this tendency naturally has the effect of lowering the quality of\r\nthe cocoa. We thus come across cocoa powders containing only 20, 17, 15\r\npercent of fat and even less. Of course nothing can be said against\r\nthe production of such cocoas, provided they are sold at a lower price\r\nthan cocoas more rich in fat and the public are aware that they are\r\npurchasing a non-fatty preparation, besides which the expression of\r\nso high a percentage of the fat alone rendered cocoa a fit regular\r\nbeverage for certain classes of invalids and persons suffering from\r\ndisorders of the stomach. The only serious drawback in this case is\r\nthe great variability of the fat content, which fluctuates between\r\n13 and 35 percent. Such fluctuations are absolutely impossible in\r\nthe case of any other article of food which is manufactured and sold\r\nwholesale, or, at any rate, buyers know in all such cases exactly what\r\nthey are purchasing; this is a point to which serious attention must be\r\ncalled. It is very much to be regretted that the Association of German\r\nChocolate Makers[127] has declined to follow up this matter, while\r\nthe Union of German Food Chemists, after considerable controversy,\r\nadvocated a distinct legal classification of non-fatty cocoa powders\r\ncontaining up to 20 percent of fat.[128] We would prefer the Dutch\r\npreparations, which have remained the same up to the present day,\r\nso-called fatty cocoas containing more than 25 percent of fat, to be\r\nclassified specially and those preparations which contain less than\r\nthis percentage of fat to be termed “highly defatted” or “dry” cocoas,\r\nthe names applied to both kinds being of little importance as long as\r\nthe public has the means of clearly recognising the distinction (see\r\ntables 19 and 20). Some 17 percent must be taken as the minimum\r\npermissible butter value, which would mean the expression of about 80\r\npercent of the total fat content, or two-thirds of the cacao mass\r\nitself; cocoa powders with only 15 percent or less of butter are\r\nto be regarded as inferior in quality and should not be produced.\r\nUnfortunately, however, these suggested limits are, at any rate for the\r\npresent, not likely to be realised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84b.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85a.]\r\n\r\nThe pressure obtained by means of the pressing devices above described\r\nis naturally not sufficient for the production of such highly defatted\r\ncocoas. Stronger presses are therefore necessary, one of which, a very\r\npowerful apparatus, is shown in Fig. 84.\r\n\r\n This machine, at the present time the most powerful cocoa butter press\r\n in the world, brings a pressure of over one million kilos to bear on\r\n the cacao mass, working with 400 atmospheres, and thus renders it\r\n possible to express as much as 90 percent of the total fat content\r\n of the bean. The construction of this press is exactly the same as\r\n that shown in Fig. 82, the pump Fig. 84a having, however, three\r\n pistons or plungers instead of one; it works, like the other machine,\r\n automatically, i. e., after the large quantity of water required at\r\n the commencement has been fed into the press, the large plunger is put\r\n out of gear at a pressure of 5 atmospheres; the two smaller pistons\r\n are then put into action together, and produce the enormous pressure\r\n of 400 atmospheres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85b.]\r\n\r\nAfter defatting, the expressed cacao cakes are allowed to cool down,\r\nfor which purpose they are transferred to flat trays or other suitable\r\nreceptacles, and pulverising and sifting the powder thus obtained\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ~Pulverising and Sifting the Defatted Cacao.~\r\n\r\nThere are several methods of proceeding with these operations, such\r\nas treating the expressed cacao in the melangeur already described\r\nin an earlier part of this book (cf. 30-32 figs.) or passing it\r\nthrough the centrifugal sifting machine (cf. 84b and 88 figs.) with\r\nwhich we are now acquainted. At a time when the melangeur was to a\r\ncertain extent the universal machine of the manufacturer, it was almost\r\nexclusively utilised for pulverisation, that up-to-date division of\r\nlabour whereby this machine is limited to mixing (and very properly so\r\nlimited, as its name implies) and the preparation of cacao powders on\r\nthe contrary assigned to more efficient constructions having then not\r\nas yet been adopted. We annex a description of one or two specially\r\nconstructed arrangements for the pulverisation and sifting of cacao, as\r\nmanufactured by J. M. Lehmann and already repeatedly tested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.]\r\n\r\nFirst there is the cacao cake crusher (figs. 85a and 85b), which\r\nreduces the pressed cake into rather large pieces about the size of\r\na walnut, previous to its being pulverised either in the melangeur,\r\ncentrifugal sifting machine or some similar apparatus. It has been\r\nfurnished with one (fig. 85a) and in some cases even with two (fig.\r\n85b) pair of toothed or cogged rollers, and the cacao in this latter\r\ntype of construction is crushed as small as a pea, which reduction,\r\nalthough it is by no means essential, considerably relieves the strain\r\non the pulverising machine and is also in some sort a protection\r\nagainst unnecessary waste of material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.]\r\n\r\nThen again, there is the so-called pulveriser shown in fig. 86. This is\r\nin principle an edge-mill with revolving bed-stone and runners, both\r\nmade of granite. The coarsely broken press cakes are fed into the mill\r\nthrough a hopper provided with a slide, and are reduced to a loose\r\npowder of firmly fixed colour, escape of dust being prevented by the\r\nhood fitted to the mill. By turning a crank, a lateral sliding door is\r\nopened, and an arrangement inside is set in motion, by which the ground\r\ncacao is turned out of the mill. The pressure of the runners can be\r\ndiminished and even completely nullified.\r\n\r\nFor cacao that has been thoroughly defatted (“dry” cocoa), the hardness\r\nof which demands a more efficient treatment than is possible in these\r\nmachines, they being only calculated to press or at the most exert a\r\nrubbing effect, there are the crushers proper, called mills built in\r\npulverising plants for dry cocoas as illustrated on fig. 87.\r\n\r\nThe pressed cacao, already broken up to some extent in a preliminary\r\ncrusher (cf. figs. 85a and b), is systematically conducted through the\r\nmill by an elevator provided with hopper and feeding apparatus. On the\r\ninterior of the machine, which is completely plated with steel-plates,\r\nthere is a cross-arm as on a windmill, which passes through a large\r\nnumber of revolutions per minute. Chiefly owing to its thrashing\r\neffect, the cacao in the mill is fine ground, without any rubbing\r\nor exertion of pressure as in the melangeur and other machines. The\r\nouter part of the frame consists of a grating with various widths of\r\nhole, which can be readily changed. The whole of the powder which has\r\nattained a certain degree of fineness falls through these meshes and is\r\nso despatched from the machine at once, an additional advantage when\r\ncomparing this mill with the melangeur, in which all the powder, even\r\nthat sufficiently ground, must remain till the final discharging, much\r\nto the detriment of its flavour and aroma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.]\r\n\r\nThe powdered cacao next succeeds to the sifting operations, after it\r\nhas first cooled a little, and for these the centrifugal sifting\r\nmachines are used in the main. Special care must be taken that such\r\napparatus as is used is not too diminutive to deal with the quantities\r\nof cacao introduced, as this is extremely injurious to the machine. It\r\nis further to be noted that no type of sifter whatever can yield good\r\nresults if it has not been especially constructed for dry cacaos.\r\n\r\nWe have before us in fig. 88 centrifugal sifting machine constructed\r\non one of the largest scales. In this cacao is introduced in the\r\nfloor of the sieve through a feeder, and by means of an elevator. The\r\nsifting cylinder is spanned with silk or bronze gauze, and conceals in\r\nits interior a rough sort of preliminary sieve, the purpose of which\r\nis to prevent the larger unpowdered pieces penetrating to the silk\r\ngauze. There is a ventilator inside this rough sieve, which produces\r\nand transmits an air current, so that the meshes are kept open. Under\r\nproper guidance it is practically impossible for the machine to break\r\ndown, although the sieve must be cleansed twice daily, an operation\r\nscarcely requiring more than two or three minutes, as it is not\r\nnecessary first to remove the part under consideration. Because of this\r\neasy manner of cleaning, the centrifugal sifter far excels all others,\r\nas the plan sifter, the latter generally having to be dismounted before\r\nthis operation can be proceeded with.\r\n\r\nThe powder issues from the first outlet of the sieve. There is a\r\nsecond, where both preliminary and cylinder sieve transmit their\r\noverflow, and this is then again conducted to the pulveriser in order\r\nto be worked up once more. Pulverisers and sifting apparatus can\r\nbe so combined by means of conveyors and elevators that they work\r\nautomatically, which is always of immense advantage where a large daily\r\noutput is in question. But pressed cakes which are to be conducted\r\nthrough the machine in broken pieces must first be treated in a\r\npreliminary crusher (cf. figs. 85a and b).\r\n\r\nFig. 88a shows one of the plansieves of the firm Baumeister, and\r\nprotected by patent, which also finds employment for the sieving of\r\ncacao powder.\r\n\r\nThis machine possesses four round sieves lying one upon another, on\r\nwhich the material to be sieved is moved by a crank driving power\r\njust as on a hand sieve, so that the surface of the sieve is fully\r\nemployed. The sieves possess neither projection nor hauling gear, the\r\nsieving is effected without pressure or friction, and the powder is\r\ntherefore loose and woolly. A brushing arrangement revolves without any\r\nmechanism, driven solely by the peculiar movement of the plansieve,\r\nunder the wholly flat sieves, and this brushing arrangement any cacao\r\npowder which may adhere to the sieve and so prevents a displacement of\r\nthe tension, as far as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.]\r\n\r\nIn the following illustration we give as an example the arrangement of\r\na pulverising plant with pulverisers (cf. fig. 86) for a second time.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary crusher receives the cakes, and then a conveyor brings\r\nthe broken pieces along to the elevator, which in its turn feeds the\r\nfilling box of the pulveriser, the connection between the two being\r\nestablished by a sliding platform. The discharged material succeeds on\r\na landing where it is cooled down a little. A second conveyor brings\r\nit to the elevator of the sifting machine. Whilst the fine powder is\r\ntaken up in barrels collectively introduced under the apparatus, the\r\nremainder of the cacao passes along to the conveyor first mentioned,\r\nis mixed with other broken pieces of cacao cake, and so returns to the\r\npulveriser.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the Dutch method of disintegration, mention must be\r\nmade of the process adopted by Moser & Co. in Stuttgart[129], where the\r\ncleansed, shelled and moistened beans are enclosed in a rotating drum,\r\nso that they can be subjected to the influence of ammonia and water\r\nvapour, produced from a solution of ammonium carbonate, which is passed\r\nthrough the hollow interior of the drum. The beans are then roasted and\r\nso freed of superfluous ammonia, after which follow in regular order\r\nthe processes of grinding, defatting and pulverising.\r\n\r\nAfter this description of the Dutch and other well-known methods of\r\ndisintegration obtaining in the manufacture of cocoa powder, we shall\r\nnow proceed to describe such of the remaining processes as seem to\r\ndeserve mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. Disintegration after Roasting.\r\n\r\nThe chief difference between the following methods of procedure and\r\nthe Dutch and other processes previously referred to is that in the\r\nformer the beans are neither impregnated with alkalis before nor during\r\nthe roasting, but after it has been carried out, and the impregnation\r\noccurs sometimes prior, and at other times subsequent, to the\r\nexpression of the fat. The several stages of treatment which proceed\r\nthis process succeed each other in the same order as in the preparation\r\nof chocolate, cleansing, sorting, roasting, crushing, shelling and\r\ntrituration following one after the other. But if the treatment with\r\nalkali is to take place before the fat is expressed, the cacao passes\r\nfrom the grinding mill direct to the apparatus in which it is subjected\r\nto the action of a solution of potash or some other alkali.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ~Disintegration prior to Pressing.~\r\n\r\nThe system of impregnating the ground but as yet undefatted beans with\r\nalkali was first introduced into Germany by Otto Rüger, Lockwitzgrund.\r\nThe principle features of the Rüger process are similar to those of\r\nother methods at present frequently met with, so that a detailed\r\ndescription would seem to be rather superfluous. Melangeurs may be\r\nconveniently employed in the treatment of cacao mass in a liquid state\r\nwith alkalis, such as we have previously described, and illustrated in\r\nfig. 86 on page 210.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90 a.]\r\n\r\nAs preparing machines for disintegration, the kneading and mixing\r\napparatus shown in working position in fig. 28, page 118, and in fig.\r\n90 a with tilted trough for emptying are specially constructed and\r\npatented and quite deserve the popularity they have acquired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90 b.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90 c.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91 a.]\r\n\r\nTheir construction and method of working are described on page 118.\r\nOther well-known machines for the purpose are the “Universal” mixing\r\nand kneading machines patented by Werner & Pfleiderer, which are shown\r\nin figs. 90 b and 90 c. As regards the general outlines of their\r\nconstruction, it will suffice to refer to the excellent descriptions\r\nof the machines which occur in the catalogues issued by this firm.\r\nMention cannot fail to be made, however, of the circumstance that\r\nin these machines the evaporation of the alkaline solvent is also\r\neffected. The working of the kneading arms facilitates the escape of\r\nvapour from the mass and prevents overheating from contact with the\r\nwalls of the apparatus. Underneath, the trough is provided with a\r\ndouble jacket, that is heated by steam.\r\n\r\nTo maintain connection of the steam and water pipes whilst the trough\r\nis reversed there are two flexible metal tubes. Both are screwed to\r\nthe fixed pipes. For carrying away the vapour given off there is a\r\ntin plate cover to the trough, provided with a charging aperture and\r\na channel inside to catch the moisture collecting on the cover and\r\ndischarge it. When the machine is to be emptied, the cover is raised\r\nand a receiver adapted to the size and form of the machine is so placed\r\nthat the charge can be diverted into it. The tilting of the machine is\r\neffected mechanically, and depends on the working of a lever. So as to\r\nprevent spurting of the liquid material when discharging, the stirring\r\narms can be stopped for a time.\r\n\r\nFrom this “Universal” Kneader and Mixer the special type “Vacuum\r\nKneader”, system Werner-Pfleiderer, is distinguished, as its name\r\nimplies, by a vacuum arrangement. As seen on illustrations 91 a\r\nand b, this comprises a pyramid-like cover made of cast iron, and\r\nshutting down air-tight, which is provided with indiarubber caulking,\r\nand binding screws, and is fitted up for steam heating. It moves on\r\nthe frame of the machine and is counterpoised with weights, so as to\r\nfacilitate its raising and lowering. On the front part of the lid\r\nthere is a small aperture paned in with glass, and opposite on the\r\ninterior in a specially protected compartment occurs an electric light\r\narrangement, which admits of the continual observation of the material\r\nduring the working up processes. In addition, small quantities of cacao\r\nmass can be introduced on removal of the glass pane without lifting\r\nup the lid; so that the advantages of the aperture are twofold. The\r\nupper part of the cover tapers off into a suction pipe, which itself\r\nterminates in a flanged support intended as a finish to the conduit\r\nfrom the airpump.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91 b.]\r\n\r\nThe kneading trough of the machine is made of cast iron, provided with\r\na false bottom, and fitted up for heating with hot water or steam to a\r\npressure of 7 atmospheres, or for cooling down with cold water. By way\r\nof rapid discharging, the trough is counterpoised with weights, and\r\ncan easily be tilted over by means of a hand winch. Its interior, as\r\nalso the kneading shovels, are clean scoured, and the bearings of the\r\nshovels stopped with easily adjustable stuffing boxes. These stuffing\r\nboxes (German Patent) are so fitted in that no greasing substances\r\nwhatever can penetrate to the cacao mass, which is of the highest\r\nimportance, as in the case of the ordinary stuffing boxes grease is\r\nsucked up into the kneading trough by the action of the air pumps and\r\nthe material contained in this so rendered impure. The steam and water\r\nconduit to and fro is effected by means of supple metallic hose, which\r\nfollow the movement of the trough as it is tilted.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum kneading machines have acquired great importance in the\r\nmanufacture of milk chocolates, where it is chiefly a question of\r\nreducing mixtures of cacao, sugar, and condensed milk to a requisite\r\nthickness. Lately the value of the machine has been regarded as\r\nconsisting in the main of the possibility of preparing cacao under\r\nvacuum which it affords.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that the treatment of the cacao under vacuum\r\ndemands a much lower temperature and takes place in about half the time\r\nrequisite for open machines, where it must be carried out against the\r\nconstant and contrary influence of the atmosphere, apart from the fact\r\nthat the vacuum kneader preserves the aroma far better.\r\n\r\nThe alkali solution used in disintegration may be prepared in vats\r\nfitted with draw-off cocks, or, in small factories, in glass carboys\r\nsuch as are used for the conveyance of acids. Of the fixed alkalis,\r\npotash is preferable, since it is a natural constituent of terrestrial\r\nplants and therefore of the cacao bean, and so its employment\r\nintroduces no foreign ingredient. Magnesium carbonate seems to find\r\nfavour in many quarters, but we consider it less suitable as being\r\ninsoluble in water, and therefore can only be incorporated with the\r\ncacao mass in a state of suspension. It is sufficient to have a potash\r\nsolution some 90 or 95 % strong, answering to the requirements of\r\nmodern medical treatises.[130] The salt is soluble in an equal quantity\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the solution, the best plan is to dissolve a known\r\nquantity in from 3 to 4 times as much water at the temperature of the\r\nroom and then by diluting with water reduce this composition to the\r\nrequired strength. As for each 100 kilos of cacao still undefatted from\r\n2 to at the most 3 kilos of potash and from 15 to 20 kilos of water are\r\nrequired, this 2 or 3 kilos of the salt should be dissolved in about 10\r\nlitres of water and the solution after diluted with the remainder of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nIn using volatile alkalis, which are nevertheless falling into disuse\r\nmore and apparently no longer maintain their reputation, ordinary\r\nammonium carbonate which may be easily obtained in powder form at any\r\nchemist’s, or a solution of ammonia, such as spirits of sal-ammoniac,\r\nmay be used. The former is easily soluble in about five parts of water.\r\nFrom ½ to 3 kilograms of ammonium carbonate are generally reckoned\r\nfor every 100 kilos of undefatted cacao material, and this amount is\r\ndissolved in water, the whole of the salt being at once introduced into\r\nfrom 15 to 30 litres, as when smaller quantities are used there ensues\r\na decomposition of the salt and one of the products of decomposition,\r\nthe carbonate of ammonium, remains undissolved.\r\n\r\nThe spirits of sal-ammoniac operate much more effectively than the\r\nammonium carbonate on account of their high percentage of ammonia,\r\nand so only a third as much of this substance may be employed, and\r\ngenerally even smaller quantities prove quite sufficient. Consequently\r\n100 kilos of defatted cacao should be mixed with 0·5-1 kilo of ammonia\r\nsolution (specific gravity 0·96), previously diluted with 20 or at\r\nthe most 29 litres of water. The mixture should be prepared in glass\r\ncarboys immediately before use, because of the volatility of ammonia.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of the cacao, salt solution and cacao are together\r\nintroduced into a melangeur, or better into the kneading and mixing\r\nmachine, and the apparatus being set in working order, steam enters,\r\nand removes the quantities of water which have been added, as well as\r\nthe volatile alkalis. Whether all the water has been driven off or no\r\ncan only be judged from the consistency of the mass after treatment,\r\nand it is just this that renders the process of little value. The cacao\r\nmaterial issuing from the machine must be just as liquid as when it\r\ncomes out of the triturating mills, and so long as it appears as a\r\nglucose substance, which very often happens where unsuitable mixing\r\nmachines are employed, so surely will it contain water, and this may\r\nlead to the growth of mould or to the cacao developing a grey colour\r\nwhen packed in boxes. If the cacao cannot be sufficiently dried in\r\nthese machines, it must be transferred to some sort of drying plant\r\n(where the temperature is about 48 ° C.), and there deprived of its\r\nstill remaining moisture.\r\n\r\nWhen volatile alkali is used, kneading and mixing machines cannot very\r\nwell be dispensed with, as they work up the cacao material much more\r\nthoroughly and admit of a better distribution of the ammonia than the\r\nmelangeur or incorporator. In this case it is advisable that the entire\r\nprocess be carried out in some apartment separated from the other rooms\r\nof the factory, in order that the pungent smell of ammonia may not\r\nbe communicated to other products, a further evil connected with this\r\nmethod of disintegration. At the same time provision must be made for\r\nthe escape of the discharged gas through flues leading out into the\r\nopen air.[131]\r\n\r\nThe treated cacao, when perfectly free from water and volatile\r\nalkali, then passes on to the press, pulveriser and sifting machine\r\nsuccessively, the several operations being proceeded with exactly\r\nas described. In the original process of Rüger’s, the defatted and\r\ndisintegrated cacao is dried after it has been reduced to smaller\r\npieces, and then mixed with fat in such proportions as seem requisite\r\nand desirable, so that it is possible in this method to re-imbue a\r\ndisintegrated cacao with its original percentage of fatty contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ~Disintegration after Pressing.~\r\n\r\nIn this process, which may no longer be adopted as far as we can\r\nascertain the mechanically prepared beans are roasted, crushed and\r\ndecorticated, then ground in mills, defatted, and finally the cakes\r\nare broken up into a rough powder and treated with alkali in the\r\nmanner above described. Care must here be taken to use as little water\r\nas possible in dissolving the alkali. It is best to employ potash\r\nexclusively, for it has been found that the last traces of volatile\r\nalkali are extremely difficult to remove from defatted cacaos as\r\ndecomposed by the solution, and there is no means of neutralising the\r\nammonia without at the same time causing material damage to the flavour\r\nand aroma of the product treated.\r\n\r\nThe concentrated solution of alkali may be conveniently sprayed on\r\nthe powder while the latter is subjected to a constant stirring, an\r\noperation best effected in the melangeur. The final drying is carried\r\nout in hot closets, provided with an effective ventilator suitable\r\nto the purpose. After it has been thoroughly dried, the cacao next\r\nsucceeds to the pulverising and sifting processes.\r\n\r\nSome methods of rendering cacao soluble remain to be mentioned,\r\nwherein no alkali whatever is used, and in which the disintegration is\r\neffected by means of either water or steam. The first process of the\r\nkind was invented by Lobeck & Co of Dresden[132] in the year 1883. The\r\ncacao beans, either raw, roasted, decorticated, ground or otherwise\r\nmechanically treated are exposed to heat and the action of steam under\r\nhigh pressure in a closed vessel, then subsequently powdered and\r\ndried. The process has little to recommend it and has not been able to\r\nestablish itself accordingly, for hereby the starch in the cacao is\r\ngelatinised, and acid fermentation is introduced, such as does not fail\r\nto damage the final product. Then again, there is a danger of the cacao\r\nbecoming mouldy in the store rooms, after being treated by this process.\r\n\r\nA second method, patented by Gädke, German Patent No. 93 394, 17 th.\r\nJan. 1895, consists in disintegrating by means of water in a less\r\npractical manner. The roasted, decorticated but as yet unground beans\r\nare moistened with water, and subsequently dried at a temperature of\r\n100 ° C. after which succeed the processes of grinding, defatting,\r\npulverising and so forth. This process has also failed to establish\r\nitself to any effect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn our opinion any one of these methods skilfully and properly carried\r\nout will yield a marketable, hygienic and wholesome product, though\r\nsome of them can boast of their own particular advantages. This\r\nholds good for the so-called “Dutch” method in particular, though\r\nit is open to the objection that the cacao so prepared is combined\r\nwith an extraneous product and that the combination remains right up\r\nto the moment of consumption. Considered from this point of view,\r\ndisintegration with fixed alkalis is generally less advisable than\r\nthe optional treatment with water or volatile alkali, but it may be\r\ntaken for granted that each manufacturer had better decide the several\r\ndetails best adapted to his own particular outfit.\r\n\r\nA well made soluble cocoa powder should have a pure brown colour,\r\nwithout any suspicion of grey, should be perfectly dry, and feel light\r\nand soft when finely divided, so betraying that property which the\r\nFrench designate under the term “impalpable The peculiar aroma of\r\nthe cacao must be retained, and especially should the preparation be\r\npreserved from the slightest taint of any ammonia combination, its\r\ntaste being kept pure and cacao-like, any hint of alkalinity indicating\r\ndefect in the manner of disintegration. Over and above delicacy\r\nof aroma and taste, that characteristic described as “solubility”\r\nconstitutes a main criterion of quality in the eyes of the consuming\r\npublic. To ascertain that only an empirical test can be employed.[133]\r\nAbout 7·5 grammes of cocoa powder are introduced into some 150 grammes\r\nof hot milk or hot water contained in a graduated beaker, and then the\r\nquantity of sediment which sinks to the bottom of the vessel in a given\r\ntime is noted. The more slowly a sediment is formed and the smaller it\r\nis, the greater the “solubility” of the cocoa.\r\n\r\nIf it becomes necessary to give the cacao an additional flavouring, the\r\nspices or ether-oils generally employed in the manufacture of chocolate\r\nmay be used in the course of pulverisation, and shortly before sifting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Packing and Storing of the finished Cacao Preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nChocolate will keep in its original condition for years, when protected\r\nfrom atmospheric influence. It is therefore generally, and especially\r\nwhere the finer qualities are concerned, packed up immediately after\r\nit leaves the last process, and ornamented chocolates are previously\r\nvarnished with an alcoholic solution of benzoin and shellac (see page\r\n250).\r\n\r\nThe inferior qualities are usually packed in paper and wooden boxes,\r\nbut the superior first in tin-foil and subsequently in paper. ~Cocoa\r\npowder~ arrives packed in parchment boxes as a rule, and also in\r\ncardboard or tin boxes.\r\n\r\nAlthough packing in parchment or waxed paper is hygienically and\r\neconomically more advantageous than tin-foil packing, the latter\r\nis nevertheless to be preferred, not only because it is a better\r\npreservative of the aroma evident in the spices added, but also because\r\nit prevents an evil which also in the end leaves its mark on cacao,\r\nwhen stored a very long time, to wit, the development of rancidity.\r\nThis is explained by the fact that the tin-foil sticks to the\r\nchocolate, and so hinders the penetration of air.\r\n\r\nAccording to an act dating from June 25th. 1897, and in force in\r\nGermany (Reichsgesetzblatt No. 22), metal-foil containing more than\r\none percent of lead may not be used in the packing of snuff, chewing\r\ntobacco and cheese. What holds good for other articles of consumption\r\nmust also apply to cacao preparations, when they are so packed that\r\nthey come first of all into contact with metal-foil, and not with\r\npaper. Tin-plating also, containing in its coating more than 1 % of\r\nlead and in the soldering more than 10 % is also inadmissible in the\r\nchocolate industry. Although it is said that the whole of the tin-plate\r\nfittings made in Germany are constructed according to an imperial\r\nstandard, yet it may occasionally so happen that cheap packing material\r\ndoes not correspond and answer to the legal requirements.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer can only protect himself against possible prosecution\r\nfor contravening or neglecting the articles of this act by obtaining a\r\nwritten guarantee as to the quality of the tin-plate supplied.\r\n\r\nThe rooms where chocolate wares are stored should not be too warm,\r\nand it is indispensable that they be kept dry, for heat accelerates\r\nthe volatilisation of their aroma and also the rancidity to which\r\ncacao is liable, whilst moisture spoils the general appearance of the\r\nchocolate and promotes the growth of mould. This development of mould,\r\nwhich is first noticeable after long storage in damp, dark warehouses,\r\nis principally due to the growth of a fungus which Royer has named\r\n“Cacao-oïdium[134]\r\n\r\nAs the numerous wrappings (in tin-foil, paper, etc.) are at present\r\nonly effected by hand labour, they mean an appreciable increase in the\r\nprice of the goods. This is of less moment for the chocolate tablets as\r\nthe small napolitains and the like. Therefore attempts have often been\r\nmade to effect this wrapping by means of machines[135], and I have seen\r\namong others two models for napolitains, one on a large and the other\r\non a small scale, the property of a Hamburg chocolate factory, and\r\nconstructed by the firm of A. Savy & Co., Paris, which same machines\r\nwere said to effect the wrapping in tin-foil, folding and additional\r\npacking in paper, as also the final closing, automatically and well;\r\nbut just as I requested to be shown the machines, I was told that they\r\nwere for the time being not in working order. Since then I have heard\r\nno more of the matter, and regret that the firm of Savy & Co., who have\r\na branch in Dresden, have not been able to answer several letters which\r\nI sent them inquiring for further particulars. It must be that the\r\nmachines have failed to answer their purpose, for otherwise they would\r\nhave been assured of a hearty reception, no matter how dear they might\r\nhave been. So for the nonce our chocolate packing must depend on hand\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nQuite a different arrangement obtains in respect to cocoa powder, which\r\nwas also originally packed up in paper bags by hand. This operation\r\nis to-day despatched in machines, as also in the case of other powder\r\nsubstances, like tooth-powder, dyes, patent foods, soap powder, etc.,\r\nand this even in the smallest of factories. It is true that the machine\r\nbuilt a decade ago by L. Wagner in Heilbronn and at that time described\r\nby Zipperer in our second edition, which was to wrap up a dozen packets\r\nsimultaneously, seems to have failed, for it is no longer constructed;\r\nyet its place has been taken by a succession of other machines which\r\nhave stood the tests of many years. The principle has been altered,\r\nmany packets at one time not being filled, but always one only, and the\r\nadvantage lies in the fact that the machine fills more exactly and with\r\na higher degree of uniformity as regards the weights of the several\r\npackets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 92 and 93.]\r\n\r\nApart from the “Machines for packing en masse” Co., Ltd. Berlin, who\r\nput out several automatic fillers, special mention may here be made of\r\nthe firm of Fritz Kilian, whose automatic filler and packer “Ideal”\r\n(fig. 92) for quantities of from 25-2500 grammes, and “Triumph” (fig.\r\n93), for quantities of from 1-100 grammes, have both long established\r\ntheir right to a place in every factory, their excellence being\r\npredominant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[105] See Mitscherlich, page 111.\r\n\r\n[106] Practical Guide to Chocolate Manufacture (no date given).\r\n\r\n[107] Comptes rendus de l’Exposition, quoted by B. de la Roque.\r\n\r\n[108] Gordian, A., German Chocolate and Sugar Industries, Vol. 1, p. 22.\r\n\r\n[109] Correspondence of the Association of German Chocolate\r\nManufacturers 1878, p. 17.\r\n\r\n[110] Correspondence of Ass.

Berlin, have\r\nrecently strongly recommended their “wrapping machines, for centres of\r\nany shape or consistency, which work automatically, that is to say,\r\nit is only necessary to heap the centres in continuous succession in\r\nthe machine, when they are urged forward and wrapped in paper or other\r\nmaterials, being finally despatched out of the machine automatically.\r\nThe wrappers may be simple or double, loose, or tight fitting.”\r\nTheir employment in the packing of chocolate tablets is especially\r\nrecommended.—And so the problem would be solved! Unfortunately I am\r\nin want of personal guidance, never yet having seen the machines in\r\nworking order, and so not being able to submit any opinion as to their\r\nefficiency. Even if they are really able to deal with larger tablets,\r\nyet the more critical problem regards the smaller goods, especially in\r\nconnection with the wrapping in tin-foil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Part III.+\r\n\r\nIngredients used in the manufacture of chocolate.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Legal enactments. Condemned ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nChocolate is a mixture of cacao mass with sugar, to which usually\r\nspices and even cacao butter are also added. The sugar generally\r\namounts to rather more than one half (60 percent) of the total\r\nmixture. Spices such as cinnamon, vanilla, cloves, nutmeg, mace,\r\ncardamoms, as well as cacao butter, or perfumes like peruvian balsam,\r\nare only added in small quantity so as to improve or alter the flavour\r\nas required. Recently, the ethereal oils of the spices have been used\r\nfor this purpose as well as artificially prepared aromatic substances,\r\nsuch as vanillin, for example. Flour and starch[136], although the\r\nlatter is seldom used, are permissible ingredients in cheaper kinds of\r\nchocolate but only when the fact of the addition is plainly stated.\r\nThe kinds of flour usually employed are wheat and potato flours,\r\nrice-starch and arrowroot, dextrin and, less frequently, oat, barley,\r\nacorn, chestnut, or rye flour. In certain forms of dietetic chocolate,\r\nsugar being injurious to invalids, it is replaced by saccharin; another\r\nmaterial, such as a leguminous flour from beans, peas or lentils,\r\nmust be employed in its place.[137] In some kinds of fancy chocolate,\r\nharmless colours, tincture of benzoin etc. are used.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Ingredients allowed\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Sweet Stuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\na) Sugar.\r\n\r\nBoth cane and beetroot sugar are employed in the manufacture of\r\nchocolate. As this naturally possesses a brownish colour, brownish\r\nwhite as well as white sugar is used for mixing with the cacao mass.\r\nThe kinds of sugar used are:\r\n\r\n 1. Sugar dust, a white crystallisable and very fine powder.\r\n\r\n 2. Crystal or granulated sugar, consisting of loose, plain crystals,\r\n and suitable for almost all purposes in the manufacture.\r\n\r\n 3. Sugar flour I, II, and III which is a difficultly crystallisable\r\n sugar containing an amount of molasses increasing with the number, and\r\n it is of a more or less brown colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.]\r\n\r\nThe chocolate manufacturer nevertheless requires the sugar to answer to\r\ncertain characters. It must dissolve in half its weight of warm water\r\nforming a sweet syrup. The syrup must have no action on either red or\r\nbrown litmus paper i. e. have neither acid nor alkaline reaction, and\r\non no account coagulate boiling milk.\r\n\r\nThe sugar is usually added to the cacao mass in the form of a very fine\r\npowder and sometimes in a coarser condition, though that is not to be\r\nrecommended. By using finely powdered sugar, the rolling of the cacao\r\nmass is considerably facilitated and the manufacture is accelerated.\r\nThe sugar must be perfectly dry, as damp sugar yields a dull chocolate\r\nwhich readily crumbles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.]\r\n\r\nFor grinding the sugar, the so called edge-runner mill as shown in\r\nfigure 94 was formerly employed.\r\n\r\nIt is like the melangeur constructed of a firmly fixed bed-stone and\r\ntwo cylindrical runners.\r\n\r\nThe pulverised material issuing from such an apparatus must then be\r\npassed through one of the various kinds of sifting machines, where\r\nthe finer parts fall through the meshes of a silken sieve, whilst\r\nthe rougher are discharged at the end of the arrangement: for small\r\nfactories such machines as the drum sifters illustrated in fig. 95, and\r\nfor the larger those centrifugal sifters which have already been fully\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe constructions for grinding have of late been considerably\r\nperfected. The most practical arrangements for pulverising all kinds\r\nof granulated sugar and so-called lump sugar, are those combined\r\ngrinding and sifting installations such as are executed by the\r\nfirm of J. M. Lehmann in Dresden. The grinding is here effected by\r\ndisintegrators (revolving arms, etc.) similar to those used in the\r\npulverising of cocoa powder as described on page 212. The output of\r\nthese disintegrators[138] is extraordinarily large, and the harder and\r\ndrier the ground sugar is, the finer the pulverised material resulting.\r\nWe annex a diagram of the machine in fig. 96.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.]\r\n\r\nThe granulated or lump sugar is filled into the hopper and thence lead\r\nalong a conveyor to be ground in another part of the machine, and can\r\nbe controlled as regards quantity. The blades, which pass through about\r\n3000 revolutions a minute, seize the sugar and swing it against the\r\nribbed walls of the mantle, after which it falls in smaller fragments\r\non a grater fitted in the under part of the apparatus. The sugar which\r\npasses through the grating is now conducted by conveyor and elevator to\r\nthe sifting arrangement, whilst the rougher material is again whirled\r\nround by the blades. This sifting arrangement consists of a cylindrical\r\nsieve, on the interior of which there occur revolving arms which\r\nprovide for the despatch of material through the various sieves. The\r\nrougher stuff which remains is removed by hand or some other mechanical\r\nmeans and transported to the hopper once more. A chamber placed above\r\nthe machine and connected with the grinding apparatus by means of pipes\r\nprovides for the protection of the machine against dust.\r\n\r\nSuch installations are constructed in various sizes and fashions, and\r\npossess immense outputs (up to even 5000 kilogrammes daily). That they\r\nmust be built in special shops is clear from the fact that so large a\r\nquantity of dusty sugar sacks need transporting after the processes are\r\ncompleted. It is further to be noted that the fineness of the sugar\r\ncorresponds to the mesh-work of the sieves, which as we have previously\r\nstated, can be chosen with any size of hole desired, yet this naturally\r\ninfluences the machine, and recently a very high standard of fineness\r\nhas been generally dropped, and rougher siftings are now made, as when\r\nthe sugar is too fine.—e. g. in the case of the cheaper qualities—it\r\nabsorbs too much of the fatty contents, and so necessitates the\r\naddition of cacao butter, whilst on the other hand, when the chocolate\r\nis of a finer quality, the sugar is sufficiently reduced in the\r\ntrituration to which the mixed material is subjected.\r\n\r\n\r\nb) Saccharin and other sweetening agents.\r\n\r\nApart from the sugar, which is such an important factor in the\r\nchocolate manufacture, mention must also be made of another sweetening\r\nmaterial, formerly frequently used as a substitute for sugar, but now\r\nonly to be obtained at the apothecary’s on exhibition of a medical\r\norder, in consequence of certain legal restrictions which have recently\r\ncome in force. It is called Fahlberg saccharin, and again zuckerin,\r\nsykorin, crystallose, “Süßstoss Höchst” and sykose.\r\n\r\nSaccharin is not like sugar a carbohydrate naturally produced by\r\nplants, but a derivative of the aromatic compounds which the chemist\r\nhas artificially constructed from the products of the distillation of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nSaccharin is benzoyl-sulphonimide, and it has the chemical formula\r\n\r\n             /  CO  \\\r\n  C_{6}H_{4}<        >NH\r\n             \\SO_{2}/\r\n\r\nIt is a white, crystalline powder, so exceedingly sweet that its taste\r\ncan be perceived in a dilution of 1 in 70000. It is only slightly\r\nsoluble in cold water (1: 400) but more easily so in hot water (1: 28).\r\nThe material known as easily soluble saccharin is its sodium salt. It\r\ncontains 90 percent of saccharin and is the most easily digested\r\ncompound of saccharin.\r\n\r\nFor technical, domestic and medicinal purposes the soluble saccharin\r\nwhich is only from 300-450 times as sweet as sugar is employed.\r\nBesides being unfermentable saccharin has very slight antiseptic\r\nproperties; according to L. Nencki[139] the digestibility of albumin\r\nis less affected by it, in the proportion usually added to articles of\r\nfood, than by Rhine wine, or by a sugar solution of equal sweetness.\r\nSaccharin is entirely unaltered in the human organism, hence it forms\r\na welcome sweetening material for invalids suffering from diabetes,\r\ncorpulence or diseases of the stomach to whom ordinary sugar is\r\ninjurious. The substances known as dulcin and glucin are analogous to\r\nsaccharin in sweetening property, the first being phenetol-carbamid and\r\nthe latter a monosulphonate of amido-triazine.\r\n\r\nThe latest substance of this class is termed “sucramin” and consists of\r\nthe ammonium salt of saccharin. It is readily soluble in water, less\r\nso in alcohol and is 700 times sweeter than sugar. It can be obtained\r\neither in the pure form or mixed (20 percent) with sugar.\r\n\r\nIn chocolate making, saccharin is at present of little importance,\r\nowing to the relatively small volume required as compared with sugar.\r\nRecently it has again been recommended to the extent of 0·76 percent\r\nas a sweetening material for cocoa powder. It would certainly be of\r\nvalue in cocoa powders to be consumed by invalids and persons not\r\nable to take sugar, although it will never come into general use. The\r\ndetection of saccharin has acquired increased importance in Germany\r\nsince the passing of the acts of October 1st 1898 and July 7th 1902,\r\nregulating the trade in artificial sweetening materials. According to\r\nZipperer’s experiments, it may be detected in the following manner:\r\nA mixture of 5 grammes of the finely powdered substance with 100 ccm\r\nof water is allowed to stand for 2 hours, occasionally stirred and\r\nafterwards filtered. The filtrate is acidulated with three drops of\r\nhydrochloric acid and evaporated to 20 ccm, then shaken[140] with 50\r\nccm of ether in a separator and left standing for a day to separate\r\ninto two layers. The ether solution is separated and evaporated to\r\ndryness in a beaker, the residue being mixed with 0·1 gramme of\r\nresorcin and 4-5 drops of concentrated sulphuric acid[141] (Börnsteins\r\ntest). The mixture is then heated over a small Bunsen flame and the\r\nmelted material saturated with normal sodium hydrate. The appearance of\r\na strong fluorescence indicates the presence of saccharin. Saccharin\r\ncan also be easily recognised by the sweet taste of the ether residue.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Kinds of Starch, Flour.\r\n\r\nThe chief kinds of starch used in chocolate making are rice starch,\r\narrowroot, potato starch and wheat starch, occasionally also small\r\nquantities of dextrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ~Potato starch or flour.~\r\n\r\nPotato starch is a white or faintly yellowish powder in which single,\r\nglistening granules can be seen by the naked eye. Under the microscope\r\nthe granules appear mostly single with evident striae, usually with\r\npointed ends containing the nucleus; they are also eccentric in\r\nstructure. This starch rarely contains fragments of tissue. It is\r\nprepared by first treating finely divided pared potatoes with 1\r\npercent. dilute sulphuric acid, then washing, drying and grinding the\r\nstarch.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ~Wheat starch.~\r\n\r\nWheat starch can be obtained either from crushed wheat or from wheaten\r\nflour by treatment with water after the nitrogenous constituent,\r\ngluten, has been separated by kneading. It amounts to about 60-70\r\npercent of the grain. Under the microscope the granules appear to\r\ndiffer considerably in size. They are distinguished from potato starch\r\nby the nearly central hilum, surrounded by faintly marked concentric\r\nstriae, and again by the granules being more frequently adherent. Wheat\r\nflour rather than the starch is generally used in chocolate making.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ~Dextrin.~\r\n\r\nWhen starch is heated to between 200° and 210° C. it is converted\r\nchiefly into dextrin or starch gum with a little sugar. Dextrin is\r\na white to yellowish and tasteless powder with a peculiar smell; it\r\ndiffers from starch in being readily soluble in water. It gives a\r\nreddish colour with an aqueous solution of iodine. Fehling’s solution\r\nis unaffected by dextrin in the cold, but on long continued heating it\r\nis reduced to red cuprous oxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. ~Rice starch.~\r\n\r\nRice starch is obtained from inferior kinds of rice and from rice waste\r\nby treatment with water. It appears under the microscope as small\r\ngranules or oval bodies of various sizes. According to their position\r\nthe granules always seem to be polygons,[142] formed by coalescence. It\r\nis thus easily distinguished from the previously mentioned starches.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ~Arrowroot.~\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds of starch, obtained from the tubers of various species of\r\nplants are commercially known under this name.\r\n\r\n1. West Indian arrowroot, from Maranta arundinacea, is a fine and\r\nalmost white powder. Under the microscope it always appears to consist\r\nof pear or spindle-shaped granules with eccentric hilum.\r\n\r\n2. East Indian arrowroot is obtained from various species of ginger\r\nplants. It is a fine white powder and is seen under the microscope as\r\nsingle granules with well marked eccentric hilum and closely stratified\r\nat the spindle-shaped ends. It much resembles Guiana arrowroot, which\r\nis obtained from varieties of Yam.\r\n\r\n3. Queensland arrowroots from species of Cycas and Canna, appear\r\nas flat, coarse and mostly single granules. They can be easily\r\ndistinguished from other kinds of starch by the large size of the\r\ngranules.\r\n\r\n4. Brazil arrowroot, from the Manihot plants which belong to the order\r\nof Euphorbiaceae. Under the microscope the granules appear compound,\r\nthe parts being of a drum or sugar loaf shape with many concentric\r\nstriae.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. ~Chestnut meal.~\r\n\r\nChestnut or maron meal also comes under consideration in the chocolate\r\nindustry. The appearance of the starch granules is most characteristic.\r\nThey are partly single and partly composed of two individual granules.\r\nThe single granules, according to J. F. Hanausek[143], appear in such a\r\nvariety of forms as to defy a summarised description. Frequently they\r\noccur oval, spindle, club, or flat kidney shaped, resembling those of\r\nthe leguminous family; but especially to be noticed is the triangular\r\ncontour of some granules, as well as some with projecting points.\r\nThe central nucleus and its cavity are generally distinct, but the\r\nstratification is very slight or quite unrecognisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. ~Bean meal.~\r\n\r\nOf the leguminous meals that of beans is chiefly used as an adjunct\r\nin cocoa powders and chocolate, sweetened with saccharin, on account\r\nof its relatively large proportion of albuminous substance and small\r\namount of starch. The meal is generally obtained from the seed of the\r\ncommon white bean. (Phaseolus vulgaris.) The starch granules under the\r\nmicroscope appear oval or long kidney shaped, with distinct nucleus\r\ncavities and furrows, as well as a distinctly marked stratification.\r\nTheir length averages from 0·033 to 0·05 mm. The meal has a\r\ndisagreeable leguminous taste when cooked, but that disappears when the\r\nmeal is slightly roasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. ~Salep.~\r\n\r\nSalep which is now very seldom used as an admixture to chocolate\r\n(Rakahout of the Arabs)[144] is an amylaceous powder prepared from the\r\ntubers of various kinds of orchids. Under the microscope salep appears\r\nas fairly large translucent masses which consist of an agglomeration of\r\nvery delicate walled cells giving the starch reaction with iodine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Spices.\r\n\r\n\r\na) General Introduction.\r\n\r\nWe cannot too strongly recommend the manufacturer to pulverise the\r\nspices, e. g. cinnamon, cloves and the like, himself, for such as\r\nare bought ready pulverised have frequently been adulterated with\r\nadmixtures of wood, flour or bark. This is the more essential as\r\nsometimes pulverised cinnamon is distilled with steam to obtain\r\nan extract of its ethyl oil, and then the residue, which is of\r\nconsiderably inferior value as regards aroma, sold as genuine cinnamon\r\npowder. Such adulteration can neither be demonstrated under the\r\nmicroscope nor chemically, so that it is impossible to protect oneself\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.]\r\n\r\nThe edge runner mill and sieving apparatus described in connection with\r\nthe pulverising of sugar also adapt themselves to reducing spices,\r\nalthough generally other machines are used for this purpose, either\r\nthe well-known ball mills[145] consisting of a hollow spherical ball\r\nrevolving round its axle, inside which the spices are shaken, crushed\r\nand completely pulverised by the action of a number of heavy metal\r\nballs, or in other cases pulverising mills and stamping arrangements\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.]\r\n\r\n The following stamp arrangement, shown in fig. 97, is very practical\r\n in the pulverisation of all manner of spices, and is driven by a\r\n force of 1·5 H.P. The strong frame, which is walled in with iron, is\r\n dust-proof. Whilst the stamper is being raised, the pots are revolved\r\n round their axles, and so the substances to be pulverised are mixed\r\n together. Other machines much used in pulverising are seen in fig. 94.\r\n Another smaller pulverising mill is pictured in fig. 98. This machine\r\n is adapted for a middle sized production. The grinding arrangement\r\n in which the pulverising takes place is conically built and is made\r\n completely of granite; the regulation is effected by means of a\r\n working beam, the batting arm of which is fitted on to the upper part\r\n of the apparatus. A sieving of the material to be pulverised does not\r\n generally take place in this machine. For small production for example\r\n for confectioners who manufacture chocolate also incidentally, one\r\n can also use the machines pictured in the figs. 95 & 99, the method\r\n of working of which may be at once understood. The different degrees\r\n of fineness of the material to be pulverised are reached by passing\r\n the powder through drum sieves of different widths of mesh and all the\r\n sieves are set in motion at the same time by the machines.\r\n\r\n\r\nVanilla.\r\n\r\nOnly the most important features of the spice so valuable in chocolate\r\nmaking will be noticed, since the characteristic aroma of the\r\ntrue vanilla has been to a large extent supplanted in practice by\r\nartificially prepared vanillin.\r\n\r\nVanilla is the fruit capsule of an orchid, ~Vanilla planifolia~,\r\nwhich is generally cultivated with the cacao tree, as the same climate\r\nand soil suit them equally. According to Möller, the shoots of the\r\nvanilla are fastened to the cacao tree, on the bark of which they\r\nsoon strike root. The aerial roots and tendrils then put forth fleshy\r\nleaves, in the axils of which arise large odourless and dull coloured\r\nflowers which yield after a lapse of two years long thin capsules.\r\nThe capsules are filled with a transparent balsam, in which the black\r\nseeds are imbedded. It is in the balsam that the vanillin, which\r\ngives vanilla its unequalled aroma, is produced. The fresh gathered\r\nvanilla fruit (see the investigations of W. Busse[146] contains no free\r\nvanillin or merely an infinitesimal quantity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.]\r\n\r\nIt is rather developed by subsequent treatment in which heat appears\r\nto be necessary. Vanillin, like cocoa-red and theobromine, is formed\r\nby the splitting up of a glucoside by fermentative action. In some\r\nkinds of vanilla, piperonal, an aromatic body, which occurs in larger\r\nquantities in ~Heliotropium europaeum~ and ~peruvianum~, has\r\nalso been observed.\r\n\r\nThe commercial kinds of vanilla come from Mexico, Tahiti, Réunion,\r\nMauritius, Mayotte, Seychelles, Ceylon and Java, which in 1891 produced\r\nrespectively:\r\n\r\n  Réunion (Bourbon)            50-65,000 kilos\r\n  Mexico                          55,000   “\r\n  Mauritius                    13-15,000   ”\r\n  Mayotte (Comoro Islands)      8-10,000   “\r\n  Seychelles                    4- 6,000   ”\r\n\r\nThe best commercial kinds of vanilla come from Mexico, Bourbon, and\r\nMauritius, and command a higher price than the other kinds. The\r\nquantity is gauged by the length (10-24 cm), and plumpness of the\r\npods. Fine quality is fatty and dark coloured, inferior quality is dry\r\nand reddish. The outside of the pods in the Bourbon vanilla, contains\r\nhighly esteemed vanillin crystals, which are wanting in the Mexican\r\nvariety. Vanilla flowers in October and November, is gathered in the\r\nfollowing months of May, June, and July, and is prepared in October\r\nand November. At the beginning of November the first instalment of the\r\nnew harvest arrives in Marseilles, which is the chief commercial place\r\nfor vanilla. The most important operation, in preparing vanilla is to\r\nattain the proper degree of dryness. This is arrived at nowadays by the\r\nuse of calcium chloride. The pods are first placed in a metallic box\r\nlined with wool which is placed in warm water so as to superficially\r\ndry them; they are then transferred to a suitable constructed drying\r\ncloset containing calcium chloride and allowed to remain there for\r\n20-30 days. 100 pounds of vanilla are reckoned to require 40 pounds\r\nof calcium chloride. The great advantage of this process is that the\r\nfruit, so dried, better retains its aroma.[147] Insufficiently dried\r\nvanilla does not keep, but soon becomes mouldy, whilst overheated\r\nvanilla keeps well, but is brittle, breaks easily and consequently has\r\nlittle commercial value. Vanilla covered with mould (~Aspergillus\r\nrepens~ and ~Mucor circinelloides~) is sought to be improved\r\nin various ways and is sold as of inferior quality.[148] It is worth\r\nobserving that those persons who in the course of business handle\r\nvanilla show characteristic symptoms of poisoning. It affects the eyes\r\nand nervous system and produces eruptions on the skin. The complaint,\r\nhowever, is not of a dangerous nature, for the workmen quickly become\r\naccustomed to vanilla so that, after recovering from the first attack,\r\nthey can resume work without risk to health.[149]\r\n\r\nOn account of its high price, vanilla is much subjected to\r\nadulteration; either by an admixture of the more cumarin-smelling\r\nvanillin (Pompona or La Guayra Vanilla [Vanilla Pompona Schieder])\r\nor other less valuable vanilla fruit; sometimes pods that have been\r\ndeprived of vanillin by extraction with alcohol are used for that\r\npurpose; their colour and appearance being restored by immersion in\r\ntincture of benzoin and coating with crystals of benzoic acid, powdered\r\nglass etc. In doubtful cases of adulteration the vanillin must be\r\nquantitatively determined.\r\n\r\nThat can be done by W. Busse’s method[150], in which the vanilla is\r\nextracted with ether in a Soxhlet’s apparatus. The extract is shaken\r\nwith a solution of sodium bisulphite, the vanillin then set free with\r\nsulphuric acid and the disengaged sulphurous acid removed by a stream\r\nof carbon dioxide. The vanillin is then shaken out with ether and\r\non evaporating off the ether, vanillin is left in a pure condition.\r\nBusse found by this method in East African vanilla 2·10 percent of\r\nvanillin, in the Ceylon 1·48 percent, and in the Tahiti variety\r\nfrom 1·55 to 2·02 percent. In America the so-called vanilla extract,\r\ninstead of vanilla, is used and it lends itself to adulteration much\r\nmore easily than natural vanilla. William Hesse has given methods and\r\nresults obtained in the investigation of the extract.[151]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ~Vanillin.~\r\n\r\nVanilla in the chocolate industry has recently been almost entirely\r\nsuperseded by the use of artificially prepared vanillin, which serves\r\nas a complete substitute for the essential and valuable constituent\r\nof vanilla. In comparing vanillin with vanilla, regard must be had to\r\nthe amount of vanillin in the latter, which may vary to the extent of\r\n50 percent according to whether the vanilla was damp, dry, fresh or\r\nstored. The finest kinds of vanilla seldom contain more than 2\r\npercent. of vanillin and in many kinds it varies between 0·5 and 2·5\r\npercent. It may also happen that vanilla with 0·5 to 1·0 percent may\r\nbe equally as fine in appearance as one of high percentage, hence the\r\naroma value must be taken into consideration. In addition to possessing\r\na uniform and permanent perfume vanillin is cheaper in price.\r\n\r\nVanillin occurs naturally not only in vanilla but also in very small\r\namount in certain kinds of raw sugar, in potato skins and in Siam\r\nbenzoin; it can be produced artificially from coniferin which is\r\nobtained from pine wood, or by the oxidation of eugenol, a substance\r\ncontained in oil of cloves, from both of which Tiemann and W.\r\nHaarmann[152] first prepared it in 1872. In the course of the last ten\r\nyears a number of processes have been discovered whereby vanillin can\r\nbe artificially produced. The reader who is interested in this subject\r\nwill find it fully discussed in a paper by J. Altschul in No. 51 of the\r\nPharmazeutische Centralhalle 1895.\r\n\r\nThe competition which arose through the processes of Haarmann and\r\nReimer of Holzminden and G. de Laire of Paris, whose products owing to\r\npatent rights had controlled the market from the commencement, produced\r\na steady decrease in the price of vanillin.\r\n\r\nThe following table drawn up by J. Rouché[153] shows the revolution\r\nin price which has occurred in this article and how, in the course of\r\ntime, a small business with large profits has been transformed into a\r\nlarge business with small profits.\r\n\r\n~The variation in the price of vanillin~:\r\n\r\nMarks per Kilo.\r\n\r\n  =====+======+======+======+======+======+======+======\r\n  1876 | 1877 | 1878 | 1879 | 1881 | 1882 | 1884 | 1885\r\n  =====+======+======+======+======+======+======+======\r\n  7000 | 4000 | 2400 | 1600 | 1600 | 1600 |  900 |  900\r\n\r\n  +======+======+======+======+======+======+=====\r\n  | 1886 | 1888 | 1890 | 1892 | 1893 | 1895 | 1897\r\n  +======+======+======+======+======+======+=====\r\n  |  700 |  700 |  700 |  700 |  700 |  560 |  108\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemical formula of vanillin is C_{6}H_{3}(OCH_{3}) (OH)CHO; it\r\nmelts between 82-83 ° C. and sublimes at 120 ° C. The colourless\r\nfour-sided crystals have a strong vanilla odour and taste, are\r\ndifficultly soluble in cold water, easily in hot water and very readily\r\nsoluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\nVanillin is much adulterated. Cumarin, the aromatic principle of the\r\nmelitot (~meliotus officinalis~) and of tonquin beans etc., can\r\nbe prepared cheaply and it is fraudulently used in large or small\r\nquantity to imitate the vanillin aroma. A sample of vanillin bought\r\nin Switzerland was found by Hefelmann[154] to contain 26 percent\r\nof antifebrin. The American “vanilla crystals” consist of a mixture\r\nof vanillin and antifebrin, or vanillin, cumarin and benzoic acid;\r\nlatterly that article is stated to consist only of cumarin, antifebrin\r\nand sugar.\r\n\r\nThe melting point of genuine vanillin is a characteristic indication.\r\nAdmixtures of vanillic acid and antifebrin cause depression of the\r\nmelting point (4-8 ° C. according to the amount and character of the\r\ntwo substances [Welmans])[155]. For the quantitative determination of\r\nvanillin in mixtures, Welmans takes advantage of its behaviour towards\r\ncaustic alkalis, with which, like phenol, it forms compounds that are\r\neasily soluble in water, but sparingly so in alcohol. The process is as\r\nfollows: 1 gramme of the substance is placed in a cylinder of 200 ccm\r\ncapacity with 25 ccm of alcohol, 25 ccm of approximately semi-normal\r\nalcoholic potash and 2 or 3 drops of phenolphthalein solution and\r\nagitated until completely dissolved. The excess of alkali is then\r\ntitrated with semi-normal hydrochloric acid, and, at the same time,\r\nthe strength of the alcoholic potash after adding 25 ccm of alcohol is\r\nascertained. The number of cubic centimetres consumed is multiplied by\r\n0·076, the semifactor for vanillin. In the case of vanilla sugar, 10\r\ngrammes are treated with 50 ccm of water to dissolve the sugar, then\r\nthe alcoholic potash is added and the operation carried out as before\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n1 gramme of vanillin requires 6: 58 ccm of normal potash (= 0·36842 g\r\nKOH).\r\n\r\n                OCH_{3}\r\n                /\r\n  C_{6}H_{3}(OH)    : KOH\r\n                \\ CHO\r\n         152                   : 56 ⚎ 1 : x\r\n\r\nIf cumarin is suspected to have been added to the vanillin it can be\r\ndetected and separated, according to Zipperer’s experiments, by the\r\nmethod of W. H. Hess and A. B. Prescott.[156]\r\n\r\nThe substance is dissolved in ether and the solution shaken up with a\r\nweak solution of ammonia. The vanillin will be found in the aqueous\r\nlayer in the form of an ammonium compound, whilst the cumarin will\r\nbe dissolved by the ether. The vanillin can be identified by the\r\nsandal-wood oil reaction as described by Bonnema,[157] and the cumarin\r\ncan be determined by direct weighing.\r\n\r\nThe financial advantage in using vanillin in place of vanilla is\r\napparent. The average price of vanilla is now 45 to 50 shillings per\r\nkilo. But as 25 grammes of vanillin are equal in perfume to 1 kilo of\r\nvanilla and, at the rate of 35 shillings per kilo, that quantity costs\r\nonly 10½ vanilla is nearly sixty times dearer than vanillin. The\r\nconsumption of vanillin has increased to an enormous extent, and in the\r\nUnited States Henning has estimated the consumption during 1897-1898\r\nat over 100000 ounces. The same author points out the remarkable fact\r\nthat this enormous consumption of vanillin has scarcely any effect on\r\nthe demand for vanilla pods, the market value of which is not only\r\nmaintained but has a tendency to increase.\r\n\r\nIn order to have it in a finely divided condition, as required for the\r\nfactory, it is recommended to rub the vanillin down with sugar, in\r\nthe proportion of 100 grammes of vanillin to 2 kilos of sugar, in the\r\nfollowing manner; 100 grammes of vanillin are dissolved in 500 grammes\r\nof hot alcohol and this solution added to 2 kilos of finely powdered\r\nsugar; then the whole is placed in a rotatory comfit boiler and dried\r\nby a blast of warm air at 40 ° C. Whilst vanilla must be very carefully\r\npacked that it may not become mildewed and deteriorate, vanillin on the\r\nother hand keeps very well in such mixtures so long as they are kept\r\nfrom damp, which might cause the sugar to ferment and thus gradually\r\ndecompose the vanillin.\r\n\r\n\r\nd) Cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThere are three commercial kinds of cinnamon in Europe.\r\n\r\n1. Ceylon cinnamon, which represents the finest kind, is the bark\r\nof ~Cinnamomum ceylanicum~, a native of the island of Ceylon.\r\nThe bark is very light and brittle, seldom more than 0·5 mm thick,\r\nexternally yellowish brown with long stripes, whilst it is somewhat\r\ndarker on the inside. Its fracture is short and fibrous, and a traverse\r\nsection shows externally a sharply defined light colour with a darker\r\ninside zone.\r\n\r\n2. Cassia or Chinese cinnamon is from ~Cinnamomum Cassia~, a\r\ntree which grows wild in the forests of Southern China. The bark is\r\nthicker than that previously described, often 2 mm thick. It is in\r\nsingle tubes, harder and thicker than the Ceylon kind, with frequently\r\nadherent fragmentary tissues of the corky layer. The colour is a\r\ngreyish brown, the fracture even, with a light zone in the section.\r\n\r\n3. Malabar or wood cinnamon consists of the less valuable kinds and\r\nis derived from different varieties of cinnamon trees which have been\r\nplanted in the Sunda and Phillipine islands. In appearance it resembles\r\nthe Chinese more than the Ceylon cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe aromatic taste of cinnamon is due to the ethereal cinnamon oil\r\nwhich, in Ceylon cinnamon, amounts to 1 percent; the ash should not\r\nexceed 4·5 percent. An ethereal oil is also present (about 1·8\r\npercent.) in the leaves of the Ceylon cinnamon tree, but it is quite\r\ndifferent from the bark oil, resembling in its properties more the oils\r\nof cloves and pimento. On account of its penetrating odour and pungent\r\ntaste its employment in chocolate making is little to be recommended.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too much insisted on that with spices like cinnamon,\r\ncloves, etc. the manufacturer should grind them himself and not\r\npurchase them in fine powder, as the latter is frequently adulterated\r\nwith admixtures of wood, meal bark, etc. This is more to be recommended\r\nas ground cinnamon has frequently been deprived of the ethereal oil by\r\ndistillation with steam and the bark then flavoured with a small amount\r\nof cinnamon oil and sold as powdered cinnamon. Such an adulteration can\r\nbe detected neither chemically nor microscopically.\r\n\r\n\r\ne) Cloves.\r\n\r\nCloves are the incompletely developed flowers of the clove tree,\r\n~Caryophyllusaromaticus~ of the Myrtaceae. The most important\r\ncommercial kinds are the Zanzibar, Amboyna, and Penang cloves. The\r\naromatic principle of cloves is an ethereal oil which they contain to\r\nthe extent of 18 percent. The adulteration of cloves is much the same\r\nas in the case of cinnamon. Genuine cloves should not give more than 6\r\npercent of ash.\r\n\r\n\r\nf) Nutmeg and Mace.\r\n\r\nNutmeg is the seed kernel of the fruit of ~Myristica moschata~\r\nknown as the nutmeg tree, which is indigenous to Malacca. In the thick\r\npericarp of the fruit, resembling the apricot, is found the brown seed\r\nsurrounded by a deep red reticular mantle. This last is the seed mantle\r\nor arillus and when separated from the kernel is known commercially as\r\nmace.\r\n\r\nThe furrows on the surface of the nutty seeds are filled with a white\r\nmass which consists of lime, in which the nuts have been laid after\r\ndrying in order to protect them from the attack of insects. The\r\naromatic constituent of nutmeg and of mace is also an ethereal oil.\r\nThe seeds contain 8-15 percent of ethereal oil with 25 percent of\r\na fatty oil; mace contains 4-15 percent of ethereal oil and 18\r\npercent. of fatty oil. As both spices occur in commerce in whole pieces,\r\nadulteration is not to be feared.\r\n\r\n\r\ng) Cardamoms.\r\n\r\nOf these there are two kinds on the market:\r\n\r\n  1. The small or Malabar cardamoms.\r\n  2. The long or Ceylon cardamoms.\r\n\r\nBoth are the fruit, although very different in form, of a species of\r\nthe ginger plants which is indigenous to Ceylon and Malabar.\r\n\r\nThe Malabar cardamom is three cornered oblong and about 1 cm in size.\r\nIn the fine brown pericarps are enclosed, adhering together, 6-8\r\nangular seeds, 3 mm in size, having a pungent aromatic taste.\r\n\r\nThe Ceylon cardamom is four times larger than the Malabar kind. The\r\ngrey brown pericarp encloses about 20 dark greyish brown seeds about 6\r\nmm large. The aroma of the Ceylon cardamom is due to an ethereal oil\r\nwhich it contains in quantities sometimes reaching 6 percent. Madras\r\nand Malabar cardamoms contain 4-8 percent of ethereal oil. As the\r\nCeylon cardamoms are cheaper than the Malabar kind a confusion of the\r\ntwo seeds might possibly be to the disadvantage of the buyer, but the\r\nabove description of their relative size would suffice to distinguish\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nExact accounts of the characteristic properties, the chemical\r\nand microscopical investigation as well as of the impurities and\r\nadulterations of the materials previously mentioned as being used in\r\ncacao preparations are to be found in volume II of the “Vereinbarungen\r\nzur einheitlichen Untersuchung und Beurteilung von Nahrungs-und\r\nGenußmittel sowie Gebrauchsgegenständen für das Deutsche Reich”[158] to\r\nwhich those who desire further to investigate this subject are referred.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Other Ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\na) Ether oils.\r\n\r\nAs previously remarked in the case of vanillin, it is becoming more and\r\nmore the custom to substitute perfume substances for powdered spices.\r\nThis practice is quite justified since the entire perfume of a spice\r\nis made use of and the worthless woody and indigestible fibre is thus\r\nexcluded from the finished preparation.\r\n\r\nThe following are the ether oils used in practice:\r\n\r\n  1. Cinnamon oil,\r\n  2. Clove oil,\r\n  3. Cardamom oil,\r\n  4. Coriander oil,\r\n  5. Nutmeg oil (ethereal),\r\n  6. Mace oil (ethereal).\r\n\r\nThe amount of ether oil that should be used in place of the\r\ncorresponding spice is a matter of taste. The maximum percentage of\r\nthe oil in the respective spice might serve as a standard, as for\r\nexample in the case of cinnamon oil, which is contained in the bark to\r\nthe extent of 1 percent, about the hundredth part of the oil would\r\nbe required to correspond with the prescribed weight of the bark. But\r\nas the yield of oil from one and the same kind of spice varies to a\r\nconsiderable extent according to season and locality, the percentage\r\nvalue can only be used as a general guide, and the final decision must\r\nbe always regulated by the taste.\r\n\r\nThe ethereal oils can be incorporated in the cacao preparations (mass,\r\npowder etc.) either in a spirit solution or ground down with sugar.\r\nThe latter method is naturally only used when sugar is to be added to\r\ncacao preparations. To prepare the alcoholic solution 10 parts of the\r\nethereal oil are dissolved in 90 parts of strong alcohol. The mixture\r\nof oil with sugar can be made by triturating 2·5 parts of the ethereal\r\noil with 100 parts of sugar in a porcelain mortar and grinding down\r\nwith the pestle until the sugar and oil are intimately mixed. Of\r\nthe alcoholic solution it is necessary to take 10 parts, and of the\r\noil-sugar 40 parts to one part of ethereal oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ~Peru balsam and Gum benzoin.~\r\n\r\nPeru balsam is at present very much used as a perfume in chocolate\r\nmaking. It is obtained from the ~Papilionaceous Myroxylon Pereira~\r\nwhich is indigenous to the western part of Central America. It is a\r\nthick, brownish black, liquid balsam which in thin layers appears\r\ntransparent and has a peculiar smell and burning taste; it is almost\r\ncompletely soluble in alcohol, chloroform, and acetic ether. The\r\naromatic substance of this balsam is cinnameïn, which consists\r\nessentially of the esters of benzoic and cinnamic acids and benzyl\r\nalcohol together with an alcoholic body “Peruviol”, which has the smell\r\nof honey. In addition to cinnameïn (71-77 percent) the balsam also\r\ncontains a resin ester (13-17 percent). According to K. Dieterich,\r\nPeru balsam is the better for containing more cinnameïn and less\r\nresin ester. Peru balsam is adulterated with fatty oils, copaiva,\r\ngurjun-balsam, storax, colophony, turpentine, and tolu balsam. In\r\nregard to the chemical investigation of this balsam the work of K.\r\nDieterich[159] may be consulted.\r\n\r\nThe Sumatra benzoin is the most important of the commercial kinds for\r\nchocolate making. It is obtained from one of the Styracae, Styrax\r\nbenzoin, and is a reddish grey mass in which separate tiers of resin\r\nare embedded. Benzoic acid and vanillin are the most important\r\nconstituents. It is adulterated with Palembang benzoin, colophony,\r\ndammer, storax, and turpentine. Respecting the chemical investigation\r\nof commercial benzoin the above-mentioned work of K. Dieterich may also\r\nbe referred to.\r\n\r\nBenzoin is almost exclusively used for the preparation of chocolate\r\nvarnish and sweets laquer, which are prepared by dissolving from 25\r\nto 45 grammes of the laquer body in 100 grammes of strong spirit. The\r\nlaquer body may contain varying quantities of benzoin and bleached\r\nshellac. The decorations of chocolate are painted with this laquer in\r\norder to give them a glistening appearance and greater durability.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Colouring materials.\r\n\r\nThe following colouring materials are permitted by the German law of\r\nthe 14th May 1879 to be used for sugar goods and consequently also for\r\nchocolate and cacao preparations.\r\n\r\n ~White~: finest flour starch.\r\n\r\n ~Yellow~: saffron, safflower, turmeric.\r\n\r\n ~Blue~: litmus, indigo solution.\r\n\r\n ~Green~: spinach juice as well as mixtures of the permitted blue\r\n and yellow colours.\r\n\r\n ~Red~: carmine, cochineal, madder red.\r\n\r\n ~Violet~: mixtures of the harmless blue and red colours.\r\n\r\n ~Brown~: burnt sugar, licorice juice.\r\n\r\n ~Black~: chinese ink.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a number of comparatively harmless aniline colours have\r\nbeen permitted in Austria for colouring sugar goods and liqueurs, and\r\neventually also for cacao preparations.[160] As in the author’s opinion\r\nthere is no ground for objecting to their use in other countries,\r\na list of them is given under their commercial and scientific\r\ndesignations.\r\n\r\n =Red=: ~Fuchsin~ = Rosaniline hydrochloride, soluble in water and\r\n alcohol.\r\n\r\n ~Acid Fuchsin~ or ~Fuchsin S~ or Rubin = Sodium or calcium\r\n acid salt of rosaniline disulphonic acid, soluble in water.\r\n\r\n ~Rocellin~ or ~Roscellin~ (Fast Red) = Sulpho\r\n oxyazonaphtalin, soluble in water.\r\n\r\n ~Bordeaux~ and ~Ponceau red~ = product of the combination of\r\n β naphtol-disulphonic acid with diazo-compounds of Xylol and higher\r\n homologues of benzol, soluble in water.\r\n\r\n ~Eosin~ = Tetrabrom-fluoresceïn, soluble in water and alcohol.\r\n\r\n ~Phloxin~ = Tetrabromo-dichlor-fluoresceïn, soluble in water.\r\n\r\n ~Erythrosin~ = Tetra iodio-fluoresceïn, soluble in water.\r\n\r\n=Blue=: ~Alizarin blue~ = Dioxyanthraquinone-quinoline, slightly\r\nsoluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\n ~Aniline blue~ = Triplienylrosaniline, soluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\n ~Water blue~ = Triphenylrosaniline, sulphonic acid soluble in\r\n water.\r\n\r\n ~Induline~ = Azodiphenyl blue sulphonic acid and its derivatives,\r\n soluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\n=Yellow=: ~Acid yellow R~ or ~fast yellow R~ = Sodium\r\namidoazobenzol-sulphonate, soluble in water.\r\n\r\n ~Tropaedlin~ 000 or ~Orange~ I = Sulphoazobenzoll [Greek:\r\n alpha]-naphthol, soluble in water.\r\n\r\n ~Naphtholyellow~ = Sodium salt of dinitro-α-naphthol sulphonic\r\n acid, soluble in water.\r\n\r\n=Violet=: ~Methylviolet~ = Hexa-and penta-methylpara-rosaniline\r\nhydrochloride, soluble in water and alcohol.\r\n\r\n=Green=: ~Malachite green~ = Tetramethyl-diamidotriphenyl-carbinol\r\nhydrochloride, soluble in water and alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe above, as well as the following colours: (blue) amaranth, brilliant\r\nblue and indigosulfone, (red) erythrosin, also acid yellow S, orange\r\nL and light green S F, have in the meantime been accepted by the\r\nAmerican Foods Act as perfectly harmless for colouring any and all\r\narticles of food.[161]\r\n\r\nFor some time past E. Merck of Darmstadt has supplied a perfectly\r\nharmless green colouring material under the name of chlorophyll, in\r\nalcoholic and in water solutions, as well as technical chlorophyll, for\r\ncolouring oils and fats, which is the unaltered leaf green and is the\r\nbest green colouring agent for articles of food and therefore for cacao\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nThe chlorophyll which is soluble in fat has also been recommended like\r\nsome of the aniline colours which are soluble in fat, as for example:\r\nIndulin 6 B (blue), Sudan yellow G, Sudan III (red), and Gallocyanin\r\n(violet) for colouring cacao butter; but in regard at least to the\r\naniline colours mentioned, no authoritative sanction for their use has\r\nyet been given.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] Flour can be more easily blended than starch with the cacao mass,\r\nas the granules of starch are only with difficulty crushed.\r\n\r\n[137] Recently in some inferior kinds of cocoa powder a quantity\r\nof oatmeal has often been added (up to 5 percent), causing the\r\npreparation to thicken when it is boiled with water.\r\n\r\n[138] Still better, as less productive of dust, there being a\r\nless rapid circulation of air, and also not so wasteful, are the\r\ndismembrators as built by Paul Franke & Co.\r\n\r\n[139] Chemiker-Zeitung 1899.

Chemical and microscopical examination of cacao and cacao\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following observations will serve as an introduction to the\r\nchemical and microscopical examination of cacao preparations calculated\r\nto be of special value to the food chemist, corresponding as they do\r\nto the state of scientific progress at the present day and special\r\nattention being paid to the critical treatment of the methods of\r\nanalysis etc. adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\na) Testing.\r\n\r\nThis is a point of great importance, inasmuch as it directly influences\r\nthe result of the analysis of cacao goods. This is especially the\r\ncase when dealing with ~cocoa powders~, as the test is liable\r\nto vary considerably according to the amount of moisture contained\r\nin the preparation and the degree of fineness of the powder. In the\r\ncase of cocoa powders, the sample should be taken repeatedly from a\r\nlarge supply, and from all parts of the material to ensure getting\r\nan average sample. The samples taken should be of uniform volume and\r\nshould, before proceeding to apply the test, be closely mixed together,\r\nbeing, if possible, first passed through a fine sieve. The material\r\nready for the following experiments should then be placed in tin, or\r\nbetter still, glass receptacles with well-fitting corks or stoppers.\r\nPaper wrappings or cardboard-boxes are not to be recommended, as the\r\npowder is apt to become drier or moister according to the state of the\r\natmosphere to which the packets are exposed.\r\n\r\nThe most suitable quantity for experimental purposes is, in the case\r\nof both chocolate and cocoa powder, as well as butter and covering\r\nmaterial, 100 kilogrammes. When determining the amount of foreign fat\r\nin cacao preparations, however, as well as estimating the ash content\r\nof powder, up to 250 kilogrammes of sample material can be used. In\r\nGermany the regulations of the Commercial Agencies of the government\r\npublic food chemists obtain when sampling and analysing cacao\r\npreparations.[162]\r\n\r\n\r\nb) Chemical Analyses.\r\n\r\nThe analyses of all cacao preparations from a chemical point of\r\nview are conducted, almost without exception, with the object of\r\ndetermining the values for ~moisture~—~mineral matter~\r\n(estimation of the amount of the carbonic acid alkalis and the silicic\r\nacid)—~fat~ (estimation of foreign fat)—~theobromine~\r\nand ~coffeine~—~sugar~—~starch~ (foreign\r\nstarches)—~albuminous matter~ and ~raw fibre~. The last\r\nregulation may also be extended to the estimation of the quantity of\r\nshell present.\r\n\r\n1. ~Estimation of moisture.~ 5 grammes of material (i. e.\r\nfine-crushed chocolate mass) are left to dry (if possible in a\r\ndouble-walled glycerine drying chamber) for about 6 hours at a\r\ntemperature of 105 Deg. C., the loss of weight of the material being\r\nestimated as moisture. The drying should not be continued longer than\r\n6 hours, as fatty material is liable after the expiration of this time\r\nto recover some of its weight, owing to the oxygen of the air entering\r\ninto chemical combination with the fat which rises to the surface or\r\ndetaches itself from the material. When analysing chocolate, great\r\ncare should be taken to prevent the mass from melting down and running\r\ntogether at one point. If this occurs, the following treatment must be\r\nadopted: A shallow watch-glass is filled with about 10 grammes of sand,\r\nwell washed and dried, a very fine sand such as so-called sea-sand\r\nbeing preferable to others, the glass then transferred to the drying\r\ncloset, cooled, and finally 5 grammes of the fine-crushed chocolate\r\nadded. The mixture is then deposited for a period of 6 hours in the\r\ndrying chamber, at a temperature of 105 Deg. as indicated above and the\r\nweight of the sand deducted when finally calculating the value of the\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nIf as low a quantity as 5 percent of gelatine has been added to\r\nthe chocolate, as much as 10 percent of water can be added without\r\nin any way affecting the appearance of the material, although such a\r\nproceeding is exceedingly detrimental to the taste and durability of\r\nthe preparation. Such chocolates usually have a dull surface and, if\r\nstored in a warm place, are apt to break up and become paler in colour;\r\nthis result can, however, be prevented by an extra addition of fat. Too\r\nhigh a[163] fat content points in any case of additions of gelatine. P.\r\nOnfroy[164] determines the addition of gelatine by boiling 5 grammes\r\nof chocolate chips in 50 cubic centimetres of water, adding 5 cubic\r\ncentimetres of a solution containing 10 percent of lead acetate, and\r\nthen filtering the whole. If gelatine is present in the chocolate, the\r\nliquid, on a few drops of saturated picric acid being added, leaves\r\na yellow, amorphous sediment. If the addition of gelatine is very\r\ntrifling, the gelatine is held in check or neutralised by the tannic\r\nacid. The defatting is then effected by ether and the chocolate stirred\r\nup with 100 cubic centimetres of hot water. 5-10 cubic centimetres of\r\na solution of lye containing 10 percent of alkali and about 10 cubic\r\ncentimetres of the above-mentioned lead acetate solution are added.\r\nThe compound of gelatine and tannic acid is soluble in the hydrate of\r\nthe alkali, and is afterwards re-deposited by the action of the lead\r\nacetate, so that it can easily be detected by means of picric acid in\r\nthe neutralised filtrate. As picric acid is incapable of effecting the\r\ndeposition of the theobromine, the deposition observed can only be\r\ncaused by the presence of gelatine.\r\n\r\nLike gelatine and glue, the addition of a quantity of adraganth has\r\nthe power of binding the moisture and saving the fat. A method of\r\nestimating the quality of this vegetable gum, of which at the most 2\r\npercent should be present, has recently been described by Welmans;\r\nthis method is explained on page ... in the microscopic section.\r\n\r\n2. ~Estimation of ash~[165]: 5 grammes of material are heated\r\nin a platinum vessel, pan or flat tray, the latter or other similar\r\nshallow receptacle being the most suitable, holding from 25 to 30 cubic\r\ncentimetres. Care should be taken when heating that the extremity of\r\nthe Bunsen flame only touches the bottom of the vessel. The resulting\r\ngases are then ignited, and the ~completely~ charred mass pressed\r\nor stirred to a powder by means of a platinum wire or rod hammered\r\nflat at the end; the pan should be frequently made to revolve and its\r\ncontents continually stirred during heating, care being taken, too, to\r\nhold it slanting the whole time. The pan should be held in this way\r\nover a moderate flame until the ash assumes almost a white colour.\r\nAs soon as this occurs, the pan should be cooled down and the ash\r\nuniformly saturated with a concentrated watery solution of carbonate of\r\nammonia, whereon the vessel is placed in the drying chamber and dried\r\nat a temperature of 100 Deg. C. The contents of the pan are then heated\r\nagain very cautiously over the Bunsen flame, care being taken that the\r\nbottom of the vessel is only allowed to become red-hot very gradually\r\nand to remain so for a very short time; the pan is then covered up and\r\ntransferred to the dessicator to be cooled, and, on the completion of\r\nthis process, its weight determined.\r\n\r\nAfter repeating the saturating process with the solution of carbonate\r\nof ammonia, drying and heating for a short time as previously\r\ndescribed, the accuracy of the weight first obtained is again tested.\r\n\r\n3. ~Estimation of silicic acid in the ash~: When examining cocoa\r\npowders and chocolate mass, the determination of the silicic acid\r\ncontent of the ash is sometimes a necessity, as this facilitates the\r\ndetection of any shells which may have been added.[166] The ash ~of\r\nthe cacao bean contains~ only between 0·25 and 1·0 percent of\r\nsilicic acid, while that of the shell shows on analysis as much as\r\n9 percent; it must, however, be taken into consideration that an\r\nunusually high value for silicic acid in the finished powder might\r\nbe caused by impurities in the chemical or other agents used to\r\neffect the disintegration of the cacao. The signs of the presence\r\nof an extraordinary quantity of silicic acid are, according to C.\r\nR. Fresenius (Introduction to quantitative analysis)[167] a higher\r\npercentage of the ash itself than usual, and the quantity of ash used\r\nfor the test should not be too small; it should further be remembered\r\nthat certain cacao preparations, such as, for instance, the Dutch cocoa\r\npowders, contain large quantities of carbonic mineral matter, and\r\nthe special treatment explained by Fresenius when dealing with such\r\npreparations separately should be applied.\r\n\r\n4. ~Estimation of alkalis remaining in cocoa powders.~ The ash\r\nobtained from 5 grammes of cocoa powder is washed out of the platinum\r\npan into an ordinary water glass or tumbler, distilled water only being\r\nused for this purpose, afterwards finely crushed with a glass rod and\r\nheated to boiling point. The liquid is then allowed to settle, filtered\r\nand re-washed. At this stage 5 cubic centimetres of n/1 sulphurous acid\r\nare added, the liquid again heated to boiling point and titrated with\r\n2/n or n/4 alkaline lye. In this way the quantity of added carbonic\r\nmineral matter is determined, in addition to the amount of carbonate\r\npresent in ordinary cocoa powders, which is formed from the organic\r\nacid minerals when the ash is produced. Welmans has determined these\r\nvalues in the commonest varieties of beans and placed the results\r\nobtained at our disposal for the second edition of this book. These\r\nresults are as follows:\r\n\r\na) Unshelled roasted beans\r\n\r\n  ===================+========+=========+=========+=========+\r\n                     | Ariba  |  Ariba  | Caracas | Caracas |\r\n       Per cent.     |   I    |    II   |    I    |   II    |\r\n  ===================+========+=========+=========+=========+\r\n  Ash                | 4·198  |  4·02   |  7·52   | 4·376   |\r\n  Soluble in water   | 1·698  |  1·66   |  1·34   | 1·676   |\r\n  Insoluble in water | 2·5    |  2·36   |  6·18   | 2·70    |\r\n  Alkali (considered |        |         |         |         |\r\n    as potash)       | 0·6417 |  0·6417 |  0·596  | 0·9936  |\r\n\r\n  ===================+===========+==========+=======\r\n                     | Guayaquil | Trinidad |  St.\r\n       Per cent.     |           |          | Thomé\r\n  ===================+===========+==========+=======\r\n  Ash                |   5·12    |  3·6     | 3·92\r\n  Soluble in water   |   2·11    |  1·565   | 1·604\r\n  Insoluble in water |   3·01    |  2·035   | 2·32\r\n  Alkali (considered |           |          |\r\n    as potash)       |   0·84    |  1·125   | 0·67\r\n\r\nb) Shelled, roasted beans:\r\n\r\n  ====================+========+========+========+=========+=========+\r\n                      | Puerto | Ariba  | Ariba  | Caracas | Caracas |\r\n       Per cent.      |Cabello |  I     |  II    |    I    |   II    |\r\n  ====================+========+========+========+=========+=========+\r\n  Ash                 | 3·62   | 3·701  |  3·49  |  3·845  |  3·62   |\r\n  Soluble in water    | 1·72   | 1·423  |  1·315 |  1·76   |  1·62   |\r\n  Insoluble in water  | 1·90   | 2·273  |  2·175 |  2·08   |  2·00   |\r\n  Alkali (potash)     | 0·603  | 0·323  |  0·388 |  0·8725 |  0·4478 |\r\n  ————————————————————+————————+————————+————————+————————-+————————-+\r\n  Alkali in powdered  |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n    cacao with 33⅓    |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n    percent of fat    |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n    calculated        | 0·808  | 0·436  |  0·52  |  1·169  |  0·600  |\r\n  Ash, calculated as  |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n    above             | 4·822  | 4·959  |  4·676 |  5·152  |  4·85   |\r\n\r\n  ====================+===========+==========+========\r\n                      | Guayaquil | Trinidad |  St.\r\n       Per cent.      |           |          | Thomé\r\n  ====================+===========+==========+========\r\n  Ash                 |   3·926   |  3·277   | 3·27\r\n  Soluble in water    |   1·476   |  1·727   | 1·34\r\n  Insoluble in water  |   2·45    |  1·55    | 1·93\r\n  Alkali (potash)     |   0·402   |  0·4209  | 0·4048\r\n  ————————————————————+——————————-+——————————+————————\r\n  Alkali in powdered  |           |          |\r\n    cacao with 33⅓    |           |          |\r\n    percent of fat    |           |          |\r\n    calculated        |   0·54    |  0·594   | 0·542\r\n  Ash, calculated as  |           |          |\r\n    above             |   5·26    |  4·39    | 4·38\r\n\r\n\r\nThese tables show that:\r\n\r\n1. The ash of cocoa powder (containing 33⅓ percent of fat) is never\r\nmore than 5·5 percent.\r\n\r\n2. The maximum amount of alkali (calculated as potash) is 1·2 percent.\r\n\r\n3. The ash soluble in water is always less than that insoluble in\r\nwater. A reverse proportion shows a larger amount of alkali, that is,\r\nalkali has been added.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the importance of determining the amount of alkali in\r\ncocoa powder, it is very desirable that analytical chemists should\r\nagree as to the methods to be adopted, since the determinations of\r\nalkali seldom agree and may differ as much as 0·3 percent.[168] The\r\nmethod of calculating the results should also be defined, that is to\r\nsay, an agreement should be arrived at as to whether the alkali should\r\nbe expressed as K_{2}O, K_{2}CO_{3} or Na_{2}CO_{3}.[169]\r\n\r\nCacao which has been rendered miscible by means of ammonia, sometimes\r\ncontains a small amount of ammonia, probably in combination with an\r\norganic acid. To detect it, the Cocoa powder should be distilled with\r\nwater, which gives an alkaline distillate, as the ammonia salt would\r\nbe decomposed at the temperature of boiling water. The ammonia can be\r\nvolumetrically determined in the distillate with sulphuric acid.[170]\r\n\r\n5. ~Determination of the Fatty Contents.~ In this operation 5\r\ngrammes of the finest powdered bean i. e. the finest cocoa powder\r\n(in the case of chocolate, which must be finely flaked, 10 grammes)\r\nshould be mixed with an equal quantity of evenly grained quartz sand\r\nin a warmed mortar, and then transferred per filter to a Soxhlet’s\r\napparatus, wherein it can be extracted with ether for from 10 to 12\r\nhours at a stretch. The previously weighed carboy, which now contains\r\nthe fatty contents in solution, is placed on a water bath, and the\r\nether extracted as far as possible, after which the fatty residue\r\nremaining is dried by first introducing the vessel in a water oven\r\nand afterwards allowing it to stand for 2 hours in a dessicator. The\r\nincrease of weight in the flask is due to ether extract, consisting\r\nalmost exclusively of fat. It is true that small proportions of\r\ntheobromine will have been simultaneously dissolved (perhaps about 0·1\r\ng.) but no special significance need be attached to them. If it should\r\nseem advisable to avoid even this slight drawback, petroleum ether with\r\na boiling point of 50° C. should be employed instead of the ordinary\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nWelmans[171] has further described a quick and practical method for\r\ndetermining fat in cacao and its preparations, which is not only\r\nof value as a check on the extraction method, but also serves as a\r\ndetermination of the constituents soluble in water. It is carried out\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n5 grammes of Cocoa powder or cacao mass, which need not be very fine,\r\nor 10 grammes of chocolate are stirred for some minutes in a separator\r\nor cylinder with 100 ccm of ether (saturated with water) until coherent\r\nparticles are no more visible, that is to say, until the factory degree\r\nof fineness has been attained. In two minutes all will have gone to\r\npowder even if the chocolate has not been rubbed down but is in pieces;\r\n100 ccm of water (saturated with ether) are then added, and the mixture\r\nagitated until a complete emulsion takes place. With powdered cacao,\r\nespecially those kinds rich in fat, that occurs in ½ to 1 minute,\r\nand with chocolate in 2 minutes. It is then allowed to rest until\r\nthe emulsion separates, which at the ordinary temperature of 15-20°\r\nC. usually occurs in 6-12 hours in the case of chocolate, and 12-24\r\nhours with cacao. The greater part of the water separates first and,\r\nusually, amounts to 90-98 ccm with chocolate and 70-86 ccm with cocoa.\r\nThe powdery portion of the cocoa or chocolate floats on the surface of\r\nthe aqueous layer at the bottom of the ether layer. Only husk, sand,\r\nparticles of cacao beans, added starch, etc. accumulate at the bottom\r\nof the separator and are to be removed with the aqueous layer, which\r\nin the case of chocolate contains the sugar, but usually no trace of\r\nfat. The ether layer, which freely separates from the emulsion in the\r\ntime mentioned, is quite clear and from 25 to 50 ccm can generally be\r\npipetted off and an aliquot part poured into a measuring cylinder or\r\ngraduated tube, or into a 25 or 50 ccm flask. If the ether solution\r\nof fat is not sufficient in quantity, the separation can be effected\r\nafter removing the aqueous liquid by twirling round the separator.\r\nThe turbidity soon disappears and the non-fatty particles quickly\r\nsink to the bottom. The ether solution of fat can also be examined\r\naräometrically, as with milk fat, by Soxhlet’s aräometric method,\r\nafter forcing it by means of an india rubber ball, into a pipette\r\nor burette, but the constants to be used in that case have not been\r\nascertained. After the ether has been distilled off, in the normal\r\nmanner, the weight obtained must be calculated for 100 ccm and a small\r\ncorrection made. For example, if 50 ccm of the ether solution of fat\r\ngive a residue of 0·8 gramme, then 100 ccm represents 1·6 gramme. But\r\nthis 1·6 gramme has not been obtained from 100 ccm of the original\r\n(water saturated) ether, but from 100-x ccm, x representing the number\r\nof cubic centimetres corresponding to 1·6 gramme of cacao butter and,\r\nas the specific gravity of cacao butter is nearly = 1; the equation\r\nbecomes (100-1·6): 100 = 1·6: x; x = 160/98·4 = 1·627 gramme; so that\r\nthe 5 grammes of substance would contain 1·627 gramme of fat or 32·54\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nThe remaining aqueous solution contains the whole of the constituents\r\nof cacao or chocolate which are soluble in water. It is measured into a\r\ngraduated cylinder and its volume ascertained. Then, after the entire\r\namount has been evaporated to dryness, the residue is calculated on\r\na percentage basis. The following procedure, however, is preferable.\r\n10 ccm of the liquid are evaporated and the residue well dried in a\r\nvacuum before it is weighed. Multiplying the ascertained weight by\r\n10, we obtain the amount of cacao or chocolate soluble in water and\r\npresent in 5 and 10 grammes of either substance respectively. The\r\namount of ~sugar~ in the aqueous extract can be determined in the\r\nfollowing manner. 50 ccm of the extract are heated in a water bath and\r\nthus separated from ether; afterwards 2 ccm of lead acetate are added\r\nand the whole immediately transferred to a special kind of filter\r\npaper. The solution is now polarised in the usual way and the number\r\nof grammes of sugar thus ascertained converted into ccm by division\r\n(1·55 being the unit) and then the result subtracted from 100, which\r\ngives the volume of water present in 100 ccm of sugar solution, and\r\nso by further division until the percentage of sugar in chocolate is\r\nfinally obtained. If the polarisation yields more sugar than the weight\r\nof the total residue, it is an indication that dextrine is present as\r\nan adulteration. The quantitative determination of dextrine, which\r\nis sometimes added to cocoa powder as well as to chocolate, for like\r\ngelatine and tragacanth it holds water together and so ensures a saving\r\nof fat, is best carried out in P. Welman’s polarising method.[172]\r\n\r\nAs the amount of fat obtained from 5 grammes of a cacao preparation\r\ndoes not suffice for tests of purity, a larger quantity must be\r\nextracted in order to carry out the following investigations. This has\r\nreference to\r\n\r\n 1. The determination of the melting point; 2. The determination\r\n of the iodine value (Welman)[173]; 3. The determination of the\r\n saponification value; 4. The determination of the acid value; 5. The\r\n determination of the Reichert-Meissl value; 6. Polen’s value[174]; 7.\r\n Cohn’s investigation[175]; 8. Melting point of the fatty acids; 9.\r\n Refraction of the fatty acids; 10. Iodine value of the fatty acids;\r\n 11. Determination of the refractive index at 40° C. in Zeiss’ butter\r\n refractometer.\r\n\r\nThe following process is usually adopted in the determination of the\r\nmelting point of cacao fat:\r\n\r\nThe melted fat is sucked up a glass capillary tube, the internal\r\ndiameter of which does not exceed 2 mm (fluctuating between 1·8 mm\r\nand that measurement) to somewhat above the part of the tube which is\r\ngraduated into tenths, and then so much of the capillary tube cut off\r\nas suffices to make the fat column there half the height of the bulb of\r\nthe mercury thermometer used in the experiment.\r\n\r\nAs fresh molten fat has a very variable melting point, it is absolutely\r\nessential that the fat in this experiment be allowed to cool about a\r\nweek in some dark chamber, and, because only after the expiration of\r\nthis period can the melting point be designated as a constant, not to\r\nproceed with the further determination until this necessary stage has\r\nbeen reached.\r\n\r\nTo carry out this determination the capillary tube is attached to the\r\nbulb of the mercury thermometer by means of a rubber ring in such a\r\nmanner that the column of fat occurs directly in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe whole apparatus is now hung in a test tube of 2½ cm internal\r\ndiameter, which is just so far filled with water that this can only\r\npenetrate to the fat in the capillary tube which is open at both ends\r\nfrom the under side. To regulate the flow of heat, this test tube is\r\nfurther introduced into a beaker also filled with water, which is\r\nheated first. As soon as the fat is melted, the water penetrates to the\r\ncapillary tube and pushes along the fat column.\r\n\r\nThe reading is now taken at once the degree registered, the thermometer\r\nshowing the melting point of the fat.\r\n\r\nWe need not here launch on an exact description of the above mentioned\r\ndetermination, but will only stay to point out the oft-mentioned book\r\nof R. Benedikt’s, entitled “Analyses of Kinds of Fat and Wax”, as\r\nenlarged and issued by F. Ulzer after the death of the author (Berlin\r\nedition, J. Springer).\r\n\r\nShould a doubt arise in comparing the results given by these six\r\ntests, which may happen with some kinds of ordinary cacao butter, the\r\nemployment of Björklund’s empirical ether test[176] or Filsinger’s\r\nalcohol-ether test is to be recommended, which latter is carried out as\r\nfollows.[177]\r\n\r\n3 grammes of cacao butter are dissolved in 6 grammes of ether at 10° C.\r\nShould the resulting solution be clear, this is an indication that no\r\nwax is present. The solution is then introduced in its test tube into\r\nwater at 0° C. and the length of the time which transpires before it\r\nbegins to become cloudy or to deposit flocculent matter, observed, also\r\nthe temperature when the solution again becomes clear.\r\n\r\nIf the solution becomes turbid before ten minutes have elapsed the\r\ncacao butter is not quite pure. Pure cacao butter becomes turbid in\r\nfrom 10 to 15 minutes at 0° C. and clear again at from 19-20° C.;\r\nan admixture of 5 percent of tallow renders the solution turbid at\r\n19-20° C. in 8 minutes and it becomes clear again at 22° C.; 15\r\npercent of tallow give a turbid solution in from 4-5 minutes at 0° C. that\r\nbecomes clear again at 22·5-28·5 ° C. Filsinger[178] has suggested\r\na modification of Björklund’s test. In his method 2 grammes of the\r\nfat are dissolved in a graduated tube in a mixture of 4 parts of\r\nether (S. G. 0·725)) and 1 part of alcohol (S. G. 0·810). Pure cacao\r\nbutter should remain clear after some lapse of time, whereas foreign\r\nfats and more especially tallow preparations cause a separation. But\r\nLewkowitsch[179] maintains that this test is not be relied on, as\r\ngenuine kinds of cacao butter will crystallise out from the ether\r\nalcohol solution at 9° C. and some at 12° C.\r\n\r\nYet we are nevertheless of the opinion that liquid fats are of no great\r\nmoment at the present time, for they always involve a considerable\r\nlowering of the melting point and so greatly impair the fracture of\r\nthe chocolate. Fats such as tallow, or the like, must be used, and\r\nthese are detected both by their flavour and by Björklund’s test.\r\nAdulteration is therefore very rarely met with in the German chocolate\r\nindustry, thanks to these facts and the rigid self-control practised\r\nby the Association of German Chocolate Manufactures and the sharp\r\nsupervision exercised by the inspectors of articles of consumption in\r\nthat country. The only regularly occurring adulterations are connected\r\nwith the preparation of Cocoa powder and consist in substitutions of\r\nfinely ground cacao husk; the detection of which still remains most\r\ndifficult and uncertain; and even here it is rather the Dutch firms\r\nwhich are culpable; and generally speaking it is a trick of smaller\r\nmanufacturers, who consider such an admixture as quite the normal\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n6. ~Determination of Theobromine and Caffeine.~ Methods for\r\nthe ascertainment of the quantity of theobromine are so numerous\r\nthat it would be impossible here to enter into the detail of their\r\nadvantages and disadvantages. Of the different processes adopted in\r\nthe determination of the cacao diureide perhaps only Eminger’s is\r\nworthy of consideration at present, and this is described fully in the\r\nfollowing paragraphs, as best corresponding to our present knowledge of\r\nthe subject and its requirements, and most deserving recommendation to\r\nchemists and food analysts on account of its reliability.\r\n\r\nFor the practical testing of cacao preparations the splitting up of\r\nthe diureide has no special advantage and so we can at once proceed\r\nto treat of the compound particle, though rather inclined to maintain\r\nthat the diureide has very little importance on the whole, for it\r\nestablishes no basis from which we can judge of the quality of the\r\nvarious products.\r\n\r\nThe procedure in Eminger’s process is as follows:\r\n\r\n10 grammes of powdered bean of cacao preparation are placed in a\r\nweighed glass flask, then stirred up with 100 grammes of petroleum\r\nether and allowed to settle. The petroleum ether is next carefully\r\npoured off, without disturbing the sediment, and the treatment repeated\r\nseveral times. After the last decantation, the residue is well drained,\r\nthen dried in the flask and weighed. The difference in weight of the\r\nresidue and the former figure represents the amount of fat. An aliquot\r\nportion of the residue (about 5 grammes) is then boiled with 100\r\ngrammes of a 3-4 percent strong sulphuric acid in a flask connected\r\nwith a reflux condenser, until cacao red is given as a resultant, a\r\ntask which occupies three quarters of an hour. The contents of the\r\nflask are then poured into a beaker, and neutralised, whilst hot,\r\nwith barium hydroxide. The whole is then mixed with sand in a basin\r\nand evaporated to dryness; afterwards the dry residue is introduced\r\ninto a Soxhlet apparatus on a paper cone, and there extracted for\r\n5 hours with 150 grammes of chloroform. The latter is carefully\r\ndistilled off and the residue dried for a period of one hour at 100°\r\nC. As previously stated, the separation of the two diureides is not\r\nnecessary and in commercial analyses it is sufficient to state the\r\namount of each separate substance after the removal of fat by means of\r\nsome suitable solvent. But should the splitting up be desired, then\r\nEminger’s method should be adopted, which depends on the solubility of\r\ncaffeine in carbon tetrachloride.[180] With that object, the mixture\r\nof fat, theobromine and caffeine is treated in the flask with 100\r\ngrammes of carbon tetrachloride and repeatedly agitated for one hour.\r\nAfter filtration, the carbon tetrachloride, which now contains fat and\r\ncaffeine, is distilled off. The theobromine left undissolved in the\r\nflask and the filter used to filter the carbon tetrachloride solution\r\nare then extracted with boiling water, the solution is filtered and\r\nevaporated to dryness, the residue representing theobromine. The\r\nseparation of caffeine and theobromine can also be effected by cautious\r\ntreatment with caustic soda, so dissolving the theobromine and leaving\r\nthe caffeine untouched in its entirety.[181] (Cf. Riederer.)\r\n\r\n7. ~Determination of Starch.~ This can only be of importance in\r\nrarer instances, as the starch naturally present in raw cacao generally\r\nvaries between 9 and 10 percent, and there is no chemical method of\r\nseparating foreign matter from cacao starch. But should the necessity\r\narise, a determination can be carried out as follows.\r\n\r\nIn order to render the starch more easily gelatinisable, the fat is\r\nfirst removed by treating 5 grammes of cocoa powder or 10 grammes of a\r\ncacao preparation with ether and then with an 80% solution of alcohol\r\nto separate any sugar, theobromine and cacao red. The residue is then\r\nmixed with water and subjected to a steam pressure of from three\r\nto four atmospheres, which converts the starch into a soluble body\r\nknown as amylo-dextrine. This operation is generally carried out in\r\nan autoclave or strong copper vessel[182] provided with an air-tight\r\nand removable cover, the open flask, containing the sample to be\r\ngelatinised (1 part of cacao and 20 parts of water) being placed in the\r\nvessel half immersed in water.\r\n\r\nAfter screwing on the lid, the temperature of the interior of the\r\nvessel is raised to 133-144° C. corresponding to a pressure of 4\r\natmospheres, and maintained at that pressure for three or four hours\r\nin order to allow the action to proceed on the mass for gelatinisation\r\nof the starch. The flask is then removed from the apparatus and the\r\ncontents allowed to settle for a few minutes; the liquid is filtered\r\nhot, the filtrate amounting to about 250 or 300 ccm after the filter\r\nhas been washed a few times with hot water. Only the cell fibre remains\r\non the filter, whilst the starch is dissolved in the filtrate. This is\r\nnow heated with 20 ccm of hydrochloric acid in a flask connected with\r\na reflux condenser, whereby the starch is converted into dextrose. The\r\nsugar solution is neutralised with sodium carbonate, clarified with\r\nbasic lead acetate, any excess of the latter being removed with sodium\r\nsulphate, finally filtered, and the whole made up to 500 ccm. The\r\nsugar is determined in this solution by titration with alkaline copper\r\nsulphate solution and from the number of cubic centimetres required\r\nfor the precipitation of the red cuprous oxide, the quantity of sugar\r\ncan be ascertained. As 99 parts of starch are equal to 108 parts of\r\ndextrose or grape sugar, the following calculation must be made.\r\n\r\n  dextrose starch     {dextrose}\r\n                   =  {        }:x.\r\n      108:99          { found  }\r\n\r\nIn the determination of sugar with copper sulphate it is more\r\nadvantageous to follow up F. Allihin’s[183] method, in which the\r\ncuprous oxide is reduced by hydrogen gas to metallic copper, weighed\r\nas such, and so the sugar calculated, or the cuprous oxide can be\r\ncollected on an asbestos filter and weighed in that condition. The\r\ncuprous oxide must be previously washed with hot water, alcohol and\r\nether, which must be completely removed by subsequent drying in the\r\nair bath, since an error of even 1 milligramme would seriously affect\r\nthe final result. Then again, the amount of sugar may be determined by\r\npolarisation, a process which has also its own particular advantages.\r\n\r\nThe chemical determination of starch is only in a limited degree\r\neffectual in a recognition of an admixture of foreign starch in cacao\r\npreparations. If more than 10-15 percent of starch, as calculated on\r\nthe crude bean, has been found, it must certainly be assumed that there\r\nis an admixture of foreign starch, but chemistry affords no assistance\r\nby which foreign starch may be separated from the genuine starch of\r\nthe cacao bean. For that purpose the foreign starch must be observed\r\nunder the microscope, which not only serves to detect its presence\r\nbut affords a means of estimating the amount present to an approximate\r\ndegree, and its characteristics. Great care should be exercised, or the\r\nresult may be easily exaggerated. Standard preparations, i. e. which\r\nhave a known percentage of starch constituent, prove very serviceable\r\nwhen comparing.\r\n\r\nIf Welman’s agitation method has been used for determining the fat,\r\nthe starch will be found in the sediment. The amount of foreign starch\r\ncan also be determined by Posetto’s[184] method, which depends on the\r\nintensity and permanency of the iodine reaction. In the latter test 2\r\ngrammes of the powdered or finely divided cacao preparation are boiled\r\nwith 20 ccm water in a test tube for 2 minutes, cooled, and without\r\ndisturbing the liquid, 20 ccm of water and 5 ccm of iodine solution\r\n(5 grammes of iodide and 10 grammes of potassium iodide in 100 ccm\r\nof water) are added. The liquid from genuine cacao, according to the\r\nvariety used, turns brownish or light blue, changing in a short time\r\n(12 minutes at the most) to brown and red. On the other hand, chocolate\r\nor a cacao preparation adulterated with not more than 10% wheaten or\r\npotato starch, chestnut, maize or commercial dextrine, will give a\r\nblue coloration lasting for 24 hours. It must be noted that the result\r\nin Posetto’s test is influenced by the amount of alkali, so that with\r\ndisintegrated cacao, for instance, a considerable quantity of iodine\r\nhas to be added before the blue coloration takes place, and this more\r\nespecially if the potassium carbonate employed contained caustic\r\nalkali. Such preparations finally become coloured, but generally show a\r\nmixed colour (blue and yellow): green to greenish brown.\r\n\r\n8. ~Determination of crude Fibre.~ This can be carried out in two\r\nways; either by König’s new process as employed by Filsinger for cacao\r\nor by the older method of Weender’s[185] as follows:\r\n\r\n3 grammes of the defatted and atmospherically dried substance are\r\nboiled for ½ hour with 200 ccm of a 1·24 percent solution of\r\nsulphuric acid. It is allowed to settle, then decanted, and the residue\r\nboiled twice with the same volume of water. The decanted liquids are\r\nallowed to settle in cylinders and the sediment added to the rest of\r\nthe substance, which is then boiled half an hour with 200 ccm of a 1·25\r\npercent solution of caustic potash, filtered through a weighed filter\r\nand the residue twice boiled with 200 ccm of water. The cellulose-like\r\nsubstance collected on the filter is washed first with hot water, then\r\nwith cold, afterwards with alcohol, and finally with ether.\r\n\r\nAfter being dried and weighed, it is incinerated and the necessary\r\ncorrections made for ash.\r\n\r\nThe process worked out by Henneberg is the one usually adopted for the\r\ndetermination of crude fibre in vegetable matter. Recently H. Suringer\r\nand B. Tollens[186] and more particularly König[187] have pointed out\r\nthat in Weender’s process the so-called pentosan (sugar derivative)\r\nof the composition C_{5} H_{10} O_{5}, which comprises a not\r\ninconsiderable portion of crude fibre, would undergo a disproportionate\r\nalteration, so that the analytical results thus obtained would not\r\nrepresent the amount of cellulose correctly. The crude fibre must\r\ntherefore be treated in such a manner as to eliminate the pentosan.\r\nKönig attains that result by treating 3 grammes of the defatted\r\nsubstance with 200 ccm of glycerine (1·23 sp. gr.) containing per litre\r\n20 grammes of concentrated sulphuric acid, under a pressure of three\r\natmospheres, for one hour. It is then filtered through an asbestos\r\nfilter whilst hot, and after being successively washed with hot water,\r\nalcohol and ether, it is weighed, incinerated and the ash weighed. The\r\ndifference between the two weighings expresses the amount of ash-free\r\ncrude fibre.\r\n\r\nFilsinger has determined by König’s method the amount of crude fibre\r\nin a series of different varieties of bean, the results of which have\r\nalready been given on page 72. Which process is the better has yet to\r\nbe established, and in issuing results as data the method employed has\r\nalways to be indicated owing to the many variations which arise.\r\n\r\n9. ~The determination of cacao husk~, which will be for the\r\nmost part a matter of ascertaining the amount of raw or crude fibre,\r\ncould formerly only be effected by means of the microscope. In 1899\r\nFilsinger[188] proposed a method of levigation which according to P.\r\nWelman’s[189] gives trustworthy results. Manifold treatises have been\r\ndevoted to the subject, and it would be advisable to turn a few of\r\nthese up and compare the details of the accounts.[190] In this method,\r\nwhich works best with the modifications suggested by Drawe (see below)\r\n5 grammes of cocoa or chocolate are defatted with ether and dried, then\r\nground in a mortar after a little water has been added, and levigated\r\nwith about 100 ccm of water in a cylinder. The liquid is allowed to\r\nrest for some time and the suspended matter poured off almost to the\r\nsediment, which is again shaken up with fresh water, allowed to settle,\r\nand the operation repeated until all the fine particles have been\r\nfloated off and the water over the sediment no longer becomes cloudy,\r\nbut remains clear after the coarse and heavy particles have settled\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe powdery sediment is collected on a watch glass, dried in the water\r\nbath, and after being cooled down in a desiccator, weighed. The weighed\r\nresidue is then softened with caustic soda and glycerine and examined\r\nunder the microscope. The presence of any cotyledon particles must be\r\ncarefully observed, such as have escaped separation in the grinding\r\nand levigation, and whether particles of husk or epidermis or germ\r\npreponderate. With proper levigation only traces of cacao substance,\r\nespecially here recognisable by the cacao starch, should be present.\r\nThe sand, which always adheres to the shells in the fermenting and\r\ndrying operations, is also easily recognised and many indications as to\r\nthe nature of the article under investigation can be noted by the use\r\nof a simple magnifying glass applied to the washed residue on the watch\r\nglass before drying.\r\n\r\nExamined in that way, a sample of so-called Cocoas from unshelled beans\r\ngave from 6 to 8 percent of husk; usually good cacao powder shows\r\na maximum of 2·5% husk. It is true that from this Filsinger-Drawe\r\nprocedure the correct percentage of shell can only be estimated in\r\nvery rare instances, for when it is necessary to be absolutely fair to\r\nall concerned in the manufacture, the cacao must be so often washed\r\nuntil no grains of cacao starch are visible under the microscope; and\r\nso the result is often too small, more especially in the case of the\r\nfiner qualities. But when all particles of starch have been removed,\r\nthe finer particles of shell have often been taken along with them. Yet\r\nwhen the residue certainly exceeds the standard percentage of shell, it\r\nmay be taken for granted that adulteration with husks has been carried\r\nto excess, or that the cleansing processes have not been effectively\r\ncarried out. There is no other method which yields the same degree of\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe result obtained by the levigation method can be controlled by the\r\npreviously mentioned methods of Weender or Filsinger, as well as by the\r\ndetermination of any silica in the ash (page 256).\r\n\r\nLatterly the admixture of cacao husk with the cheaper kinds of cocoa\r\npowder has largely increased, therefore the determination of the amount\r\nof husk in cacao preparations has become of special importance.\r\n\r\n10. ~Determination of sugar.~ There are three methods for the\r\nquick determination of sugar, two of them polarimetric and the third\r\nconsisting of taking the specific gravity of the solution obtained\r\nby shaking up the cacao with water. It is as well to note that in\r\nall these methods the result includes the normal amount of sugar in\r\ncacao, which Welmans[191] gives at 0·75-2 in cocoa and 0·4-1·0\r\npercent in chocolate. That source of error is of no special significance,\r\nfor, as Welmans has shown, it is compensated for in the course of the\r\nsucceeding operations, so that these methods are of service.\r\n\r\nFor official investigations under this head the statutes of May 31st\r\n1891 and May 27th 1896 respectively together with the instructions\r\nissued by the council concerning the carrying out of the process\r\n(Berlin, July 9th 1896, and Nov. 8th 1897, E) constitute a standard.\r\n\r\nThey read as follows: “Half the normal weight (13·024 g) of chocolate\r\nis damped with alcohol and then warmed for 15 minutes with 30 ccm\r\nof water on the water bath. While still hot, it is poured on to a\r\nwet filter, the residue again treated with hot water, and until the\r\nfiltrate nearly amounts to 100 ccm. The filtrate is to be mixed with 5\r\nccm of basic lead acetate solution, allowed to stand for a quarter of\r\nan hour, then clarified with alum and a little alumina, made up to a\r\ndefinite volume (110 ccm) and polarised.” But it is to be noted that\r\nthese instructions are not exhaustive enough, and prove particularly\r\ndeficient as regards the employment of water, also through their\r\nnon-observation of the errors which can arise in using basic lead\r\nacetate, though it is true that these are only of a minor character.\r\n\r\nThe Berlin chemist Jeserich (ex officio) had a rather hot dispute with\r\nthe official over the matter, who declared that his results were false\r\nin spite of all protest, until he finally proved that it was not these\r\nresults but the process advised by law which lacked correctness. He\r\ndescribed the rencontre in very lucid if drastic detail to an assembly\r\nof official chemists.\r\n\r\nSomething similar happened to the present editor, who in his office\r\nof sworn chemist was called upon to determine the amount of sugar and\r\nstarch present in certain crumb chocolates on the one hand, and the\r\namount of cacao material on the other. As the official inspectors\r\ninsist on their prescriptions being carried out with scrupulous\r\nexactitude, he found it necessary to give a double result, the one in\r\naccordance with these prescriptions, and the other when double the\r\namount of water was used, taking care to explain the whole matter\r\nat length. But it occasioned some surprise, and finally the task of\r\ninvestigating and testing was withdrawn and given to another.\r\n\r\nAnother polarimetric method, recommended by Woy[192], is carried out\r\nas follows. Two portions of half the normal weight (13·024 grammes) of\r\nrasped or shaved chocolate are placed in 100 ccm and 200 ccm flasks\r\nrespectively, moistened with alcohol, then treated with hot water and\r\nstirred up till the sugar is dissolved. 4 ccm of basic lead acetate\r\nsolution are added to each flask, by which means the chocolate in\r\nsuspension loses its viscosity. After being cooled, the solutions are\r\nmade up to the marks, well mixed and filtered. Two quickly filtering\r\nliquids are thus obtained, which are then polarised in 200 mm tubes.\r\nWith chocolate containing meal, the temperature must not exceed 50° C.\r\nFrom the two polarisations, the following equation results: a (100-x)\r\n= b(200-x), in which _a_ and _b_ are the results of polarising, and x\r\nthe volume of the insoluble substances, including the lead precipitate,\r\ncontained in the half normal weight. The product of the equation gives\r\nthe amount of sugar present. Woy’s method has the great advantage of\r\navoiding the error due to the volume of the undissolved cacao and lead\r\nprecipitate.\r\n\r\nThe third method, as adopted by Zipperer[193], is as follows: 50\r\ngrammes of chocolate, finely divided with an iron grater or rasp, are\r\ntreated with exactly 200 ccm of cold water, frequently stirred for 4\r\nhours, then poured on to a previously moistened and well wrung pointed\r\nbag. The specific gravity of the filtrate is taken in an araeometer,\r\nspecially constructed for the purpose by Greiner of Munich on lines\r\nsuggested by Zipperer himself. On the scale of the araeometer is given\r\nthe percentage amount of sugar in the chocolate, from 5 to 5 percent,\r\nwith subdivisions of one percent, so that the reading can be quickly\r\ntaken, without correction.\r\n\r\nIn the determination of sugar by weight, the chocolate is first\r\ndefatted with ether, the sugar extracted with alcohol, then inverted,\r\nthe inverted solution treated with Fehling’s solution and the copper\r\nprecipitate weighed. The process has little to recommend it, being\r\ntroublesome and admitting of a large margin of errors.\r\n\r\nHere again much has been written of late[194] concerning the two former\r\nmethods, their liabilities to error and the avoidance of these, yet\r\nwithout bringing to light anything which calls for a specially detailed\r\ntreatment in this book.\r\n\r\n11. ~Determination of Albuminates.~ The determination of albumin\r\nis frequently required in the analysis of cacao powder and is necessary\r\nto the ascertainment of its nutritive value. The determination of\r\nnitrogen is determined by mixing 0·5 grammes of finely powdered bean\r\nwith soda lime and burning the mixture in a tube. (This determination\r\nof nitrogen is a necessary part of the process.) Thus ammonia is\r\nformed, which is passed through a known quantity of sulphuric acid.\r\nWhen the combustion is finished, the acid solution is titrated with a\r\nstandard solution of barium hydroxide, and from the quantity consumed\r\nthe percentage of nitrogen is calculated. But as the diureides also\r\ncontain nitrogen (31·1 % of the theobromine and caffeine present) the\r\nnitrogen corresponding to this amount must be deducted from the total\r\nquantity of nitrogen yielded by combustion and the remainder multiplied\r\nby 6·25 will indicate the amount of albumen present as a constituent.\r\n\r\nAnother and better method of determining the nitrogen is by\r\nKjeldahl’s[195] process. It has been frequently subjected to\r\nmodifications, but was originally carried out as follows. 0·25 grammes\r\nof the nitrogenous substance (cacao preparation) is heated on the\r\nsand bath together with 20 ccm of concentrated sulphuric acid and a\r\nlittle quicksilver, till the solution becomes colourless or only of a\r\nvery pale yellow. After diluting with about 200 ccm of water, it is\r\nmade alkaline by the addition of soda lye (which must of course be\r\nentirely free from nitrogen, the same remark applying to the sulphuric\r\nacid used) and, potassium or sodium sulphide being added, it is then\r\ndistilled, and the ammonia given off collected and determined as above\r\ndescribed. As this method also determines the total amount of nitrogen,\r\nan allowance must be made for the nitrogen in the theobromine and\r\ncaffeine before multiplying the result by 6·25. This modification is\r\nstill to be recommended as the best and most reliable.\r\n\r\nIn rare cases an excessive amount of albumen may be due to the\r\nadmixture of earth-nut cake or gelatine. As to the detection of the\r\nlatter adulteration, see page 254. Bileryst[196] says that earth-nut\r\ncake can be recognised by its high percentage of albumen content,\r\namounting to between 45 and 47 percent.\r\n\r\n12. ~Investigation of Milk and Cream Chocolate.~ The tests bearing\r\non these products really constitute a chapter in themselves, which has\r\nacquired special importance owing to the great popularity they enjoy\r\nand the consequently greatly increased production. According to the\r\nunanimous opinion of the Association of German Chocolate Manufacturers\r\nand the Free Union of German Food Chemists, expressed when considering\r\nthe respective claims of such chocolates, it is chiefly if not\r\nexclusively a matter of determining the percentage of milk or cream,\r\nwhich ought not to be below 12·5 or 10%, always supposing the milk\r\nor cream to be a substitute for sugar, and this means therefore that\r\nthe quantity of cacao material in the chocolate product should on\r\nno account sink below 32%. (Cf. p. 283 No. 3. Abs. 5.) The method\r\nemployed in the investigation is generally the same as that suggested\r\nby Laxa in his treatise on “Milk Chocolates”[197] although it has been\r\nconsiderably improved by Baier and his colleagues.[198] It is here a\r\nmatter of working backwards from the determination of the fatty and\r\nnitrogenous components (or caseine) to the amount of milk or cream in\r\nthe chocolate. This presents a certain amount of difficultly as it\r\nis not only necessary to determine the milk, but also to establish\r\nthat neither skimmed or whipped material (either in part or entirely)\r\nhas been employed. Yet it is possible here to proceed with absolute\r\ncertainty, as Baier[199] convincingly demonstrates, by taking into\r\nconsideration the relative proportion of milk fat, called caseum or\r\ncaseine.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired finally to characterise the respective chocolates,\r\ndeterminations of the ~quantity~ of milk fat present and the\r\namount of milk product used become essential. Baier gives both as\r\ncalculable (cf. footnote 1)[200], the Reichert-Meissl number of the\r\ntotal fat being ascertained, and from this, subtracting the R.-M.\r\nnumber of the cacao fat present[201] the quantity of milk fat, finally\r\nthe amount of caseine, milk sugar, mineral matter and other factors.\r\nNo details of this somewhat extensive calculation are proved in the\r\noriginal.[202] We give the following regulations (Laxa-Baier) for\r\ncarrying out the determination of the caseine, together with the\r\nnecessary formula.\r\n\r\n20 grammes of fine divided chocolate are loosely introduced into a\r\nSoxhlet’s extracting apparatus, and there extracted with ether for a\r\nperiod of 16 hours. Of the residue, 10 grammes are used for testing in\r\nconnection with caseine, and this after the ether has evaporated. These\r\nare mixed up in mortar with gradual and even addition of a 1% solution\r\nof sodium oxalate, so that no lump formations occur, and then brought\r\ninto a marked carboy of 250 ccm capacity, until 200 ccm of the sodium\r\noxalate solution have been used. The carboy is then provided with an\r\nasbestos net, and heated by means of a flame from the under side, until\r\nits contents are brought to boil. The mouth of the carboy is covered\r\nwith a small funnel which has been hermetically sealed at its narrower\r\nend. Then boiling oxalate solution is poured into the vessel up the\r\nbend, and it is then allowed to stand over till another day, shaking\r\nhowever being often repeated, then filled with sodium oxalate solution\r\nup to the mark, agitated with a regular motion, and then filtered\r\nthrough an ordinary filter. To 100 ccm of this solution 5 ccm of an\r\nuranous acetate solution (5% strong) and drop by drop and with repeated\r\nstirring a 30% solution of acetic are added until there is a deposit.\r\n(This will require from 30 to 120 drops, according to the amount of\r\ncaseine present.) Then an extra 5 drops of acetic acid can be added.\r\nThis causes the deposit to stand out clearly from the liquid matter\r\nand it can be readily separated by centrifugalising. Afterwards it can\r\nbe washed out with 100 ccm of solution, of which 5 ccm are uranous\r\nacetate and 3 ccm acetic acid 3 % strong, until the sodium oxalate\r\ncan no longer be seen on adding calcium chloride (i. e. after about\r\nthree repeated centrifugalisations). The contents of the tube are then\r\nrinsed on to the small filter by means of the wash fluid, stirred in a\r\nKjeldahl carboy with concentrated sulphuric acid and copper oxide, and\r\nthe quantity of nitrogen found converted into caseine by multiplying\r\nwith the factor k = 6·37.—Bearing in mind the quantity of fat, the\r\npercentage of caseine in the original chocolate is calculated.[203]\r\n\r\nIn the following:\r\n\r\n      b = signifies the total of fatty content of the chocolate[204],\r\n      a = the Reichert-Meissl number of the total fat,\r\n  and K = the amount of caseine as established by the Laxa-Baier method\r\n          (nitrogen contents times 6·37).\r\n\r\n         (a - 1) b              Further: 1.

The ~starch~, as already remarked, consists of\r\nespecially small globular granules, mostly separate, but also two\r\nor three adherent. It is somewhat more difficult to gelatinise than\r\nother kinds of starch, and it is coloured blue by iodine somewhat more\r\nslowly than many other starch granules, especially in the preparations\r\ncontaining fat. Cacao preparations which have been disintegrated by\r\nfixed alcalis, differ in this respect; according to Welmans, iodine\r\nfirst forms colourless iodine compounds, and not until the alkali has\r\nbeen saturated, is the blue colour developed. In such cases, care\r\nmust be taken, that an excess of iodine is present. In estimating the\r\namount of foreign starch, great care must be taken that the conspicuous\r\nbluish-black granules of the foreign starch, which immediately strike\r\nthe eye, are not over estimated, which may easily occur. For control\r\nobservations, mixtures containing various known amounts of starch\r\nshould be tried comparatively. The pigment cells and the epidermis\r\nwith the Mitscherlich’s particles (figs 101 and 102) should be noticed\r\nas well as the characteristic globoids, which occur in the ash of the\r\ncotyledon tissues (compare page 67). The ~outside shell~, more\r\nor less woody according to the origin of the bean, consists of four\r\nlayers of cells; this is best recognised by the large cells of the\r\nprincipal tissue, which are distinguished by their form as well as by\r\ntheir thickened side walls from the tissue of the cotyledon. Another\r\ncharacteristic of this layer consists of the large number of coarse\r\nspiral vessels, which exceed those of the seed lobes in size, and\r\nfinally, the inner elements of the stone cell layer, which, however,\r\non account of their limited development are seldom to be discovered.\r\nThe smooth, fine brown coloured, and light refracting fragments, which\r\nfrequently appear quite structureless and have their fibrous character\r\nmade perceptible only after treatment with caustic alkali, must be\r\nregarded as characteristic of the inner part of the husk or the seed\r\nmembrane. The best observing medium is a solution of chloral hydrate or\r\nalmond oil, as well as dilute sulphuric acid and glycerine.[205] The\r\nsubstance is always to be defatted with ether, before the microscopical\r\nexamination. A complete extraction of the fat, according to Welmans,\r\ncan occur only with exceedingly thin cuttings, in which every cell of\r\nthe section would be operated on, or in powdered preparations, when the\r\ncells have been completely torn asunder by mechanical pulverisation.\r\nThe fat is not extracted by solvents from intact cells, as the cell\r\nwalls are impermeable by them.[206]\r\n\r\nThe detection of ~foreign starch~ is possible only by use of\r\nthe microscope; by means of standard preparations an approximate\r\nestimate may be made as to the amount and kind of meal added.[207] The\r\nexamination of starch is especially facilitated by H. Leffmann and\r\nW. Beam’s[208] centrifugal method: the sample suspended in water is\r\nsubjected to rotation for a short time in the centrifugal apparatus.\r\nThe presence of foreign starch is shown by a white layer in the\r\nresulting sediment. This layer can be collected and microscopically\r\nexamined for foreign starch and husk. In the case of cacao\r\npreparations, it is always well to distinguish between unimportant\r\ntraces and quantities that justify objection.[209]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.\r\n\r\n _A._ Silver membrane with the hairs (Mitscherlich particles) _tr_, and\r\n the crystals _f_ and _K_.\r\n\r\n _B._ Cocoa powder: _c_ Cotyledon tissue with cells of fat and\r\n colouring matter, _p_ shell parenchyma, _sp_ speriods, _d_ layer of\r\n dry cells.]\r\n\r\nA means of detecting ~tragacanth~ in cacao preparations, has\r\nlately been described by Welmans[210]. 5 grammes of the cacao\r\npreparation are to be mixed with sufficient dilute sulphuric acid (1:\r\n3) to form a thick pulp, then with 10 drops of solution of iodine (in\r\npotassium iodide) and some glycerine. A portion of the mixture is\r\nexamined under the microscope (enlarged 160 times). The entire field\r\nof view now appears to be thickly sown with countless blue dots, some\r\nglobular, others irregular, among which are especially to be noticed\r\nthe large tragacanth cells, resembling potato starch, which are not\r\nseen in cocoa powder that is free from tragacanth, when similarly\r\nprepared as an object; the small blue dots, due to cacao starch, are\r\nvisible only in the densely occupied portions.\r\n\r\nAn admixture of the ~carob~, which has been seldom observed, can\r\nbe easily recognised under the microscope by the characteristic reddish\r\nwrinkled tubes of the fruit pulp, which are also coloured violet by\r\ntreatment with a warm solution of caustic potash.\r\n\r\nThe presence of ~earth-nut or earth-nut cake~ can be detected by\r\nthe aid of the microscope on treatment with chloral hydrate, by the\r\ncharacteristic saw toothed epidermis cells of the husk of arachis seed.\r\n\r\n~Hazelnut and walnut pulp~, so far as they are to be met with in\r\ncacao preparations, can be distinguished under the microscope by shreds\r\nof the tissue of the seed husks, in which broad streaks of spiral\r\nvessels, lying close on one another, are distinctly prominent. If in\r\naddition the woody fruit shell be admixed, it can be detected by the\r\ngreat number of cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Definitions of Cacao Preparations.\r\n\r\nThe following formulae have been compiled by the Association of German\r\nChocolate Manufacturers for the purpose of fixing the definition of\r\ncacao, and we may say that we agree with same in the main, as they\r\nsatisfy all just claims, and keep pace with the progress made in\r\nconsequence of the introduction of the modern machinery now in use,\r\nboth from a scientific and practical point of view. Only in a few\r\npoints are we of different opinion, and have referred to such clearly\r\nin their place.\r\n\r\n\r\na) Regulations of the Association of German Chocolate Manufacturers\r\nrelating to the Trade in Cacao Preparations (cocoa, chocolate and\r\nchocolate goods).\r\n\r\n(Revision of September 16^{th} 1907.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n 1. Cacao mass is the product obtained by simply grinding and moulding\r\n roasted and shelled cacao beans and no substance handled under this\r\n name may contain any admixtures of foreign matter.\r\n\r\n 2. Disintegrated cacao mass is cacao which has been treated either\r\n with alkalis, alkaline earth, or steam.\r\n\r\n 3. Cocoa powder, freed of oil (also soluble, disintegrated cacao) is\r\n the resulting product when the cacao bean is decorticated, roasted and\r\n more or less freed from its oil or also disintegrated in powder form.\r\n Cocoa powder, cacao from which oil has been extracted, disintegrated\r\n and soluble cacao may on no account contain foreign ingredient other\r\n than an addition of roots and spices.\r\n\r\n In the case of cacaos disintegrated with alkalis or alkali earths, not\r\n more than 3 % of alkali or alkali earth may be used in the process;\r\n they may not contain more than 8 % of ash, reckoned on cacao material\r\n with 56 % of cacao butter.\r\n\r\n 4. ~Chocolate.~ The designation “Chocolate” may only be applied\r\n to those confections which are prepared by the addition of cacao\r\n butter, vanilla, vanillin, cinnamon, cloves or other spices to roasted\r\n and shelled beans or to a disintegrated mixture of cacao and sugar.\r\n\r\n The percentage amount of sugar may not exceed 70, and the occasional\r\n addition of other substances (medicinal, meals, and the like) is\r\n admissible, but the total percentage of these and the sugar may not\r\n exceed 70.[211]\r\n\r\n5. ~Food chocolates~, ~chocolates for immediate consumption~,\r\nand ~dessert chocolates~. For these confections the same\r\nprinciples hold good, with the exception that here additions of\r\nnuts, almonds and milk stuffs are permissible, up to a percentage\r\nnot exceeding 5 in total, without any declaration of the goods being\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n6. ~Chocolate powder~ is a mixture of cacao material which may be\r\ndisintegrated and more or less freed from oil, with an amount of sugar\r\nnot exceeding 70% at the most. Spices as in the case of chocolate.[211]\r\n\r\n7. Cacao butter is the fat obtained from the decorticated bean or cacao\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe following are especially to be regarded as adulterations of the\r\ngoods mentioned under I. from 1 to 7.\r\n\r\n 1. Foreign fats;\r\n\r\n 2. Shells and other waste cacao products (dust or seed);\r\n\r\n 3. Meal, though this is not expressly given;\r\n\r\n 4. Colouring matter; the colouring of the surface of figures is\r\n permissible;\r\n\r\n 5. So-called fat economisers, such as adraganth, gelatine, and\r\n dextrine.\r\n\r\nAn addition of substances for medicinal or dietetic purposes is\r\npermissible, though in such cases the goods must be declared. The\r\naddition of any fats other than cacao butter (i. e. of any foreign fat)\r\nor of shells or waste products to cacao or chocolate or to cacao or\r\nchocolate goods is also not permissible even when these are designated\r\nin such a manner that the words chocolate and cacao do not occur in\r\ntheir description.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n~Declaration of Added Ingredients.~\r\n\r\nThe declaration must be transcribed in legible script and form, as\r\ne. g. “Meal” so as to be readily understood by all, and composed in\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nThe declaration must occur together with the description of contents\r\nand as part of the same on despatching original packages in retail\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nIn wholesale trade the declaration must occur on all offers,\r\nquotations, bills and all boxes, etc. provided with description of\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nWhen offered for sale or exhibited in an unpacked condition, every box\r\netc. containing the goods must have such a declaration introduced so as\r\nto be visible to every buyer in the premises, where possible; or the\r\ndeclaration shall be placed on the goods themselves.\r\n\r\n 1. Skimmed milk chocolates must be literally described as such, and\r\n must be manufactured with at least 10 % of skimmed milk powder or the\r\n corresponding quantity of skimmed milk proper. Addition of ordinary\r\n milk or its powder is permissible and need not be declared;\r\n\r\n 2. Milk chocolate must be manufactured with ordinary milk containing\r\n at least 3 % of fat, and in such a manner that at least 10 % of milk\r\n powder or the corresponding quantity of milk proper are employed;\r\n\r\n 3. Cream chocolate must be prepared from cream containing at least 10\r\n % of fat, and in such a manner that at least 10 % of a cream powder\r\n or the corresponding amount of cream, in each case containing 50 % of\r\n milk fat, are employed. It may be varied to taste with milk proper or\r\n its powder, without any further declaration being necessary.\r\n\r\nThese percentages represent a minimum. It remains at the manufacturer’s\r\nchoice whether he shall employ larger quantities of cream or milk.\r\n\r\nThe associated firms are further recommended to annex the following\r\nguarantees:\r\n\r\n a) that the powder of milk proper contain at least 26 % of fat and be\r\n prepared from a milk guaranteed as pure;\r\n\r\n b) that the cream powder contain at least 40 % of milk or be prepared\r\n from cream containing at least 10% of fat.\r\n\r\nIt is especially emphasised that these quantities are minimums, and\r\nevery manufacturer is free to add as much cream or milk as he pleases.\r\n\r\nWe particularly recommend the procuring of a guarantee from the\r\nmilk purveyor as to its purity for every delivery in order to be\r\ncovered against fines in case the product should prove to contain an\r\ninsufficient amount of fat. Analytical testings of trial samples are\r\nalso to be recommended.\r\n\r\nBy way of comparison we refer to the “Principles for Estimating Cacao\r\nProducts and their Food Value” determined by the Free Union of German\r\nFood Chemists in their 8th annual assembly at Heidelberg (1909) and\r\nfinally established in their 10th held at Dresden (1911), which are\r\nsaid to have found general acceptance from the 1st July, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\nb) Final Wording of the Principles of the Free Union of German\r\nFood Chemists for the estimation of the Value of Cocoa and Cacao\r\nPreparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n~Cacao mass~ is the product which is purely and simply obtained\r\nfrom the roasted and shelled cacao bean by grinding and moulding.\r\n\r\nCacao mass may not contain any kind of foreign substance. Traces of\r\nshell may only be present in minor quantity. The waste product falling\r\nin the cleansing of the bean must not be added to the cacao mass, nor\r\nmay it be worked up into cacao material separate and apart from other\r\ncacao.\r\n\r\nCacao mass shows 2·5-5% of ash and contains 52-58 % of fat.\r\n\r\nDisintegrated cacao is such material as is treated with alkalis or\r\nalkaline earths, ammonia or its salts, under pressure of steam.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n~Cocoa powder~, cacao that has been pressed and its oil removed,\r\nsoluble Cocoa and disintegrated cacao are synonyms for cacao mass\r\nwhich has been reduced to powder form after they have been partially\r\nseparated from fat by expression under heat; and generally treatment\r\nwith alkalis or their carbonates, alkaline earths, ammonia, and ammonia\r\nsalts under a strong steam pressure are presupposed.\r\n\r\nCocoa powder containing under 20% of fat, as well as that treated with\r\nspices (aromatised or scented) must be declared accordingly.\r\n\r\nCocoa powder may not contain any kind of foreign substance. Traces of\r\nshell may only be present in minor quantity. The waste product falling\r\nin the cleansing of the bean may neither be added to the cocoa powder\r\nnor itself worked up into such a powder.\r\n\r\nThe added alkali or alkaline earths may not exceed 3 % of the raw\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nOnly powdered cacao and cocoa powder which has been treated with\r\nammonia and its salts under strong steam pressure shows from 3 to 5 %\r\nof ash on cacao mass containing 55 % of fat.\r\n\r\nCocoa powders disintegrated with alkalis and alkaline earths must not\r\nshow more than 8 % of ash on cacao containing 55 % of fat.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of water must not rise above 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n~Chocolate~ is a mixture of cacao material with beetroot or cane\r\nsugar and a proportionate admixture of spices (vanilla, vanillin,\r\ncinnamon, cloves and so forth). Many chocolates contain apart from that\r\nan addition of cacao butter.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of sugar may not amount to more than 68.\r\n\r\nAddition of substances for dietetic and medicinal purposes is\r\npermissible, and then the total of sugar and such addition must not\r\nexceed 68% of the whole.\r\n\r\nApart from the addition of spices no other vegetable admixtures are\r\npermissible. Nor may chocolate contain any foreign fat or foreign\r\nmineral constituents. Cacao shells may only be present in faint traces.\r\nThe waste product falling in the cleansing of the bean must not be\r\nadded to the cacao mass, nor may it be worked up into cacao material\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nChocolates which contain meal, almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts and milk\r\nstuffs must be provided with a declaration indicating such addition\r\nprecisely, and here again the total addition of foreign ingredients\r\nshall not exceed 68 %.[212]\r\n\r\nThe percentage of ash constituent shall not exceed 2.5.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n~Covering or coating material~ must satisfy the requirements\r\nholding good for chocolate even when the coated goods bear declarations\r\nin which the words cacao or chocolate do not expressly occur, although\r\nadmixtures of nuts, almonds and milk stuffs not exceeding a total of 5%\r\nmay be made without declaration.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n~Chocolate powder~ may not contain more than 68 % of sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n~Cacao butter~ is the fat obtained from the hulled bean or cacao\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Milk and Cream Chocolates.~\r\n\r\n1. Cream, milk and skimmed milk-chocolates are products which are\r\nmanufactured with addition of cream, milk (skimmed or unskimmed) in a\r\nnatural, thickened or dry form. They must be declared as cream, milk or\r\nskimmed milk chocolates.\r\n\r\n2. The fat content of full milk should amount to at least 3 percent,\r\nand that of cream itself 10 percent. If the full milk or cream is\r\nadded in a condensed or dried state, these ingredients must be in\r\ncorresponding proportions. As it is at present not possible to produce\r\na cream powder containing at least 55 percent of fat, the normal\r\npreparation of this class is, for the time being, represented by a\r\nproduction containing 5.5 percent of milk fat in the form of cream\r\nand milk.\r\n\r\n3. Milk chocolate prepared from skimmed milk must contain at least 12.5\r\npercent of dried milk or skim-milk, and “Cream” chocolates not less\r\nthan 10 percent of cream or full-cream powder.\r\n\r\n4. The percentage of the milk or cream preparation added must in all\r\nchocolates be deducted only from the percentage of the sugar, i. e. the\r\ncacao content of all chocolates containing these ingredients must be\r\nthe same as in the case of the commoner varieties.\r\n\r\n~Special notice.~ In the case of butter chocolates, in which the\r\ncream is replaced by pure cacao fat, the same regulations naturally\r\nobtain; thus the amount of butter added must be not less than 5.5\r\npercent. of the whole, and the butter should be used in place of the sugar\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n(Regulations relating to the manner of examining chocolates as to the\r\npresence of the prescribed quantities of the above ingredients will\r\nprobably be issued in the course of a year or two.)\r\n\r\n\r\nc. Vienna Regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of Microscopical and Food Chemists in Vienna, held on\r\nthe 12th-13th October 1897, the object of which was to fix a “Codex\r\nAlimentarius Austriacus”, also arrived at some just and appreciable\r\ndefinitions, which are well worthy of repetition here:[213]\r\n\r\n1. Chocolate should consist of a mixture of cacao, Austrian sugar\r\ncapable of fermentation, further an addition of spices (cinnamon,\r\ncloves, vanilla or vanillin) amounting to as much as 1 percent of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n2. Cacao mass should consist of the roasted and shelled cacao bean,\r\nground and moulded, only.\r\n\r\n3. Cocoa Powder should be a preparation obtained from cacao mass only\r\nby the partial expression of the 50 percent of fat which the latter\r\ncontains and frequently treated with alkalis. The alkalis may reach 2\r\npercent of the whole, and the object of the treatment with them is\r\nto effect the disintegration of the tissues of cacao or to render the\r\ncacao “soluble\r\n\r\n\r\nd) International Definitions.\r\n\r\nAn International Congress of Chocolate and Cocoa Manufacturers was\r\nfinally held in Berne on August 21st-23rd 1911, which, unlike the\r\nmeeting held by the White Cross in Geneva (1908), the object of which\r\nwas the prevention of food adulterations, was really international\r\nand attended by numerous manufacturers from Belgium, Germany,\r\nEngland, France, Holland, Italy, Mexico, Austria, Hungary, Russia and\r\nSwitzerland, the total number of visitors amounting to 250.[214]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ~Cacao Mass.~\r\n\r\n§ 1. Cacao mass is obtained by roasting or drying[215] cacao beans\r\nwhich have previously been well cleaned and freed from the shells\r\nand dust. Cacao mass can either be disintegrated, i. e. “soluble” or\r\nuntreated with disintegrating agents, i. e. “insoluble\r\n\r\nCacao which has been treated according to § 5 is in the real and\r\nbusiness sense of the term to be regarded as a ~pure~ article of\r\nfood, seeing that the treatment with alkaline carbonates or pure alkali\r\nis a purely chemical, or technical, operation. Such cacao may therefore\r\nbe justly termed “pure\r\n\r\n§ 2. Cacao mass may contain a quantity of added cacao butter\r\nproportionate to the prescribed, or suitable, fat content of the cacao\r\npreparation to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ~Cocoa Powder.~\r\n\r\n§ 3. Cocoa powder should consist of defatted, or fatty, pulverised\r\ncacao mass.\r\n\r\n§ 4. Cocoa powder which has been opened up by means of alkalis or\r\notherwise is termed “soluble” or disintegrated cacao.\r\n\r\nDisintegrated cacao which has been treated as described under § 5 may\r\nin the real and business sense of the word be regarded as a “pure”\r\narticle of food, as the treatment with alkaline carbonates or pure\r\nalkalis is a purely chemical, or technical, operation. Such cacao may,\r\ntherefore, be justly termed “pure\r\n\r\n§ 5. The quantity of alkali used to effect the treatment described\r\nshould not exceed 5·75[216] grammes of potash or the equivalent of\r\nanother alkaline carbonate, to 100 grammes of dry defatted cacao.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ~Cacao Butter.~\r\n\r\n§ 6. Cacao butter consists of the fat obtained from either untreated or\r\ndisintegrated cacao.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. ~Chocolate~ and ~Chocolate Powder~.\r\n\r\n§ 7. Chocolate is a mixture of cacao mass and sugar, with or without\r\nthe addition of cacao butter. On pulverising chocolate, ~chocolate\r\npowder~ is obtained.\r\n\r\n§ 8. Both chocolate and chocolate powder may, if the methods of\r\nmanufacture require it, be prepared from partially defatted cacao mass.\r\n\r\n§ 9. The amount of cacao mass and cacao butter contained in chocolates\r\nand chocolate powders should be at least 32 percent[217] of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. ~Milk Chocolate.~\r\n\r\n§ 10. Milk chocolate should consist of a mixture of cacao mass, cacao\r\nbutter, sugar and milk or milk powder. The quantity of cacao mass and\r\ncacao butter contained in such preparations should amount together to\r\nat least 25 percent[218] of the whole.\r\n\r\n§ 11. All chocolates which are brought on to the market under the name\r\nof milk chocolate, must contain at least 12·5 percent of milk or milk\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n§ 12. No milk used for the preparation of milk chocolate may contain\r\nany preserving agent.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. ~Covering Matter.~\r\n\r\n§ 13. The definitions of chocolate proper apply also to covering\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n§ 14.

Adulterations of Cacao wares and their Recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\na) Introductory.\r\n\r\nCacao preparations are subject to manifold and various kinds of\r\nadulteration. The following table gives a list of proved adulterating\r\nagents, and contains in the last column but one hints as to how such\r\nforeign additions can be detected, which hints are given in more detail\r\non various pages in this edition, the numbers of which are annexed in\r\nthe last column.\r\n\r\nBases for the judgment of cacao preparations appear on the one hand\r\nin the definitions and formulas previously given, and on the other in\r\nthe rougher and finer adulterations which we had the opportunity of\r\ndetecting. We give these bases once more, at least such as we deem\r\nnecessary to a proper estimation of the purity of cacao goods, and in\r\ngeneral rather incline to the principles which Filsinger has worked out\r\nfor the Imperial Health Office (Germany) and which received a hearty\r\nreception at the hands of the various unions connected with the trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nb) The Principles.\r\n\r\n~Chocolate~, ~Cacao material~, and ~cocoa powder~\r\n(defatted and disintegrated cacao) may on no account contain any kind\r\nof foreign vegetable mixtures like starch, meal, peanut cake, hazel nut\r\nand walnut admixtures, nor cacao shells nor yet waste products, neither\r\nmay it contain any mineral stuffs or foreign fats. Chocolates with meal\r\naddition must contain on the wrapper a concise and definite declaration\r\nof such addition on the wrapper. The presence of cacao shells is\r\ndetrimental to the nutritious value of the cacao preparation, being\r\nlittle suited for human consumption, as they contain a large quantity\r\nof woody substance, and apart from this, always occur with adhering\r\nsand and earth. The removal of such shells is since the perfecting of\r\nthe cleaning machinery intended for the purpose, become a very easy\r\nmatter, and so none but very inferior quantities are permissible.\r\nAny additional shells (even when declared, and very fine ground) are\r\nillegal. The addition of spices or their corresponding ethereal oils\r\nare allowed, and as such may be considered almonds and nuts, more\r\nespecially in the case of coating material and so forth, although they\r\nare subject to compulsory declaration.\r\n\r\nThe same conditions prevail in the case of ~chocolate enamelling~\r\nand ~coating~ material as for ordinary chocolate, and in\r\nparticular they must be free from all kind of foreign fats and cacao\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nThe use of dyes (earth-and tar-colouring matter) which are intended as\r\nsubstitutes for a percentage of cacao, and not merely as ornamental, is\r\nnot permissible; and such dyes as are objectionable from a hygienical\r\nstandpoint are impossible, even when they are used for decorating\r\npurposes. Cacao material contains on an average from 3-4 % of ash and\r\nfrom 50-55 % of fat.\r\n\r\nAdmixtures of glue, tragacanth or dextrine are not permissible, when\r\nthey are intended to conceal an addition of water or to save the use of\r\nexpensive cacao fat.\r\n\r\n~Cocoa powder~ contains arbitrary quantities of fat, and shows\r\naccordingly a varying quantity of ash to correspond with the amount of\r\nfat expressed. It is therefore necessary to declare the quantity of\r\nfat contained in quite a general manner and something in the following\r\ngrade: skimmed milk cacao under 25 % of fat, cacao freed from oil,\r\nfatty and ordinary milk chocolate up to a percentage not exceeding\r\n35.[220] For the same reason it is necessary to convert the established\r\nash contents, possibly of cacao material with 50% of fat, or none at\r\nall. It is most to the purpose to convert in the case of dry material\r\nwhich has been freed of fat, as occasionally considerable amounts of\r\nmoisture remain over from the processes of preparation. Cocoa powder\r\nwhich has been disintegrated without the use of potassium, sodium\r\nor magnesia agents (carbonic acid) will therefore show the same ash\r\ncontents as the corresponding material freed from oil, whilst that of\r\ncacao disintegrated by means of the fixed alkalis will be greater. The\r\nash contents of powder freed of oil may nevertheless not exceed 3 %,\r\ncorresponding to a total 7 %. The mixture of cocoa powder and sugar is\r\nnot permissible.\r\n\r\nChocolates, chocolate fondants and coating mass contain variable\r\nquantities of sugar and fat; accordingly no limits can be assigned to\r\nthe ash contents of these preparations.\r\n\r\nA unanimity of opinion as to the least possible amount of cacao for the\r\nchemical estimation of chocolate has become an urgent necessity. Hereby\r\nit should be established that in good chocolate the fatty contents,\r\napart from the sugar,[221] exceed a definite percentage.[222] A minimum\r\npercentage of 35% of cacao mass in chocolate destined for export, which\r\nmust possibly be covered, has been fixed by the council of commerce.\r\n\r\nAs percentage of chocolate in cacao the double quantity of non-fatty\r\ncacao material must be taken, on the supposition that raw cacao\r\ncontains on an average 50% of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\nc) Laws and Enactments as to Trade in Cacao Preparations.\r\n\r\nSo far traffic in cacao has only been brought under legal control in\r\nthree European countries, namely Belgium, Roumania, and Switzerland.\r\nWe annex in the following pages a resumé of the legal prescriptions\r\nappertaining thereto, as being of especial importance to exporting\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 ~Belgium.~\r\n\r\nThe ~Belgian~ royal decree of the 18th November 1894 established\r\non the basis of the law for articles of consumption, August 4th 1890,\r\nand article 454 to 457, 500 to 503, and 561 of the penal code book runs\r\n(according to the “Moniteur Belge” of the 3rd and 4th December, 1894,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nArt. 1. It is illegal to sell, expose or hold in possession for sale,\r\nor to transmit, any other product as “all cocoa” than the fruit of the\r\ncacao tree, raw and prepared by roasting, hulling and grinding with or\r\nwithout addition of spices, and finally moulded into tablets or reduced\r\nto powder form.\r\n\r\nIt is permissible to sell, expose or have in possession for sale, or\r\nto transmit such cacao as has suffered a loss of butter by expressing,\r\nprovided that the amount of this ingredient is not diminished by more\r\nthan 20 % of the whole, under the designation “cocoa or cocoa powder”;\r\nand again under the designation “alkalinised cacao” (cacao alcalinisé)\r\nsuch as has had its alkali content increased in special treatment by\r\nnot more than 3% of the total weight. The declaration “alkalinised” is\r\nnot, if a matter of mere possession or transmittance in export, to be\r\nconsidered as necessary.\r\n\r\nCacao which has been prepared other than as above described may only\r\nbe sold, exposed or held in possession for sale, or transmitted, under\r\na special label which declares this special manner of preparation next\r\nto the word “cacao” or under a label that does not contain the word\r\n“cacao” at all.\r\n\r\nThe word “alkalinised” or any other words which indicate alterations or\r\nadditions in the natural composition of the cacao must be introduced on\r\nthe label in distinct and similar type to the word “cacao\r\n\r\nCacao in which the proportion of alkali amounts to more than 3% is\r\nregarded as injurious, and the sale, having and holding in possession\r\nor despatch of same for sale is illegal.\r\n\r\nArt. 2. It is illegal to sell, have in possession or expose for sale,\r\nor to transmit any product whatever, under the designation “chocolate”,\r\nthat is not manufactured exclusively from shelled cacao, and that\r\nin a minimum proportion of 35%, and ordinary sugar, with or without\r\nadmixture of spices.\r\n\r\nProducts which though containing the requisite 35% of shelled cacao\r\nare also made of other substances than those above signified may only\r\nbe sold, held in possession, exposed or transmitted for sale under a\r\nlabel that clearly describes the nature of such ingredients next to\r\nthe word “chocolate” and in the same type, or under a label that does\r\nnot contain the word “Chocolate” at all. In the case indicated by\r\nimpressing them on each separate tablet.\r\n\r\nProducts which contain less than 35% of cacao may only be sold, held\r\nin possession, exposed, or transmitted for sale under the designation\r\n“cacao bonbons” or some similar description, from which the word\r\nchocolate has been rigidly excluded.\r\n\r\nArt. 3. Entries of the labels prescribed for the products of irregular\r\ncomposition in articles 1 and 2 must be made on the invoices despatched\r\nwith the goods.\r\n\r\nArt. 4. The box, case or wrapper etc. containing cacao or chocolate\r\nwhich is sold, exposed, held in possession or transmitted for sale must\r\nbear the name and address of the manufacturer or seller, or at least\r\nsome regular and authorised trade mark.\r\n\r\nArt. 5. The articles of this decree, as far as they refer to chocolate,\r\nare only applicable to ordinary chocolates in tablet, block, spherical\r\nor powder form, not however to cream and various sugar confections in\r\nchocolates (such as pralinés, pastilles etc.).\r\n\r\nArt. 6. Any infringement of the articles of this decree will incur a\r\nfine in accordance with the code of fines issued on Aug. 4th 1890, over\r\nand above the ordinary penalties.\r\n\r\nArt. 7. Our Board of Trade and Agriculture is hereby entrusted with the\r\ncarrying out of this decree, which shall come into force on April 1st\r\n1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Roumania.\r\n\r\nThe royal enactment of this land respecting the health supervision of\r\nfoods and drinks and the trade in foods and drinks, articles 154, 155,\r\n156 and 157 of the Health act of the 11th September, 1895, says the\r\n“Buletinul directiunei generale a serviciului sanitar” 1895, No. 18 and\r\n19, pages 277 et seq.\r\n\r\nNo. XIII, Article 137.\r\n\r\nNo product may be sold, exposed or held in possession or transmitted\r\nfor sale, under the designation cacao, other than the seed of the fruit\r\nobtained from the tree “Theobroma Cacao It may be brought on the market\r\nraw, roasted, or powdered after roasting.\r\n\r\nUnder the designation “Cocoa powder, defatted”, such may be sold as\r\nhas suffered loss of butter by extraction, provided that there still\r\nremains a minimum 22% of cacao butter in the product. As disintegrated\r\ncacao may be sold such powder as does not contain more than a maximum\r\n2% of sodium or potassium carbonate.\r\n\r\nArt. 138. It is illegal to sell or expose for sale artificially dyed\r\nand pulverised cacao, and also such as has been mixed with starch\r\nmeals, foreign fats or any other foreign ingredients. It is in like\r\nmanner illegal to mix cocoa powder with shells, and the former may not\r\ncontain more than a maximum 15% of powdered shell.[223]\r\n\r\nArt. 139. Under the designation “Chocolate”, only the foodstuff\r\nprepared from a mixture of roasted and powdered bean and sugar, with or\r\nwithout admixture of aromatic ingredients, as vanilla, cinnamon and the\r\nlike substances, may be sold and exposed for sale.\r\n\r\nArt. 140. The manufacture and sale, as also the exposure for sale of\r\nchocolate from cacao that does not answer the several demands of this\r\ndecree, articles 137 and 138, as well as of chocolate that is mixed\r\nwith starch, meals, mineral and artificially coloured substance, is\r\nillegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe association of analytic chemists in this country have issued a\r\nbook entitled “The Swiss Book of Nutritious Stuffs and Articles of\r\nSustenance”, where the methods and standards prevailing in research\r\nwork connected with such substances are finally established for\r\nSwitzerland. This work served as a guide as regards articles of\r\nsustenance up to the time when the Swiss food act came into force, and\r\nwe accordingly annex a few extracts from it, dealing with our subject,\r\ncacao preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitions.\r\n\r\n1. Cacao mass is obtained by grinding and moulding the shelled and\r\nroasted cacao bean, without any admixture whatever, or extraction of\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n2. Cacao ~freed of oil~ is cacao that has been reduced by from 20%\r\nto 35% as regards its butter contents by means of pressure under heat.\r\n\r\n3. ~Disintegrated cacao.~ The roasted beans are treated with\r\ncarbonic acid alkalis (generally potassium) subjected to pressure\r\nunder ammonia or steam, and so the cellular tissue of the albuminous\r\nsubstance disintegrated or broken up and converted into a soluble\r\nmodification (peptone and alkalinous albuminate).[224] The so treated\r\nbeans are next dried, reduced, defatted and pulverised.\r\n\r\n4. ~Chocolate~ is the description of a mixture of cacao and\r\nsugar which comes into commerce either moulded or in powder form. The\r\npercentage of sugar amounts to between 40 and 70%. Admixture of other\r\nsubstances than cacao, sugar and the usual spices must be regarded as\r\nadulterations.[225]\r\n\r\n5. ~Chocolate~ and ~cacao~ (powdered or moulded) may be\r\naromatised with the following substances: vanilla, benjamin gum, tolu\r\nand peru balsam, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.\r\n\r\n6. ~Chocolate fondants~ are chocolates with an unusually large\r\nproportion of sugar and fatty contents.\r\n\r\n7. ~Milk chocolate~ is a preparation prepared from milk, sugar\r\nand cacao. It may not contain the preserving materials dis-allowed for\r\nmilk, such as boracic acid, borax, formic aldehyde and derivatives of\r\nthe aromatic series. It comes into commerce in powder form.\r\n\r\n8. ~Covering~ or ~coating~ material is a mixture of cacao,\r\nsugar, spices, with almonds and hazel nuts. This preparation is almost\r\nexclusively employed for bonbon confectionery.\r\n\r\n9. ~Medicinal Chocolate~ is a chocolate or cacao preparation\r\ncontaining additions of medicaments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTests and Definitions always to be applied.\r\n\r\n  1.  Touch test.\r\n  2.  Reaction.\r\n  3.  Microscopical examination.\r\n  4.  Examination of the fat.\r\n  5.  Estimation of cacao butter.\r\n  6.  Determination of sugar.\r\n  7.  Determination of ash.\r\n\r\n\r\nTests and Definitions eventually necessary.\r\n\r\n  8.  Determination of moisture.\r\n  9.  Determination of theobromine.\r\n  10.  Determination of starch.\r\n  11.  Determination of cellulose.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuide to Classification:\r\n\r\nUnripe, badly fermented cacao beans and those which have been\r\nattacked by insects or mould or have suffered during transport from\r\nthe influence of salt-water, should never be used for manufacturing\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nGoods prepared from such beans have an unpleasant taste, which it\r\nis impossible to get rid of by the various operations in the course\r\nof manufacture. The use of all such beans is to be regarded as\r\nadulteration. The tests to be applied for determining them are tasting,\r\nmicroscopical examination and perhaps the estimation of the common salt\r\ncontained in them.\r\n\r\nAll good chocolates are of a fine brown colour. Grey-coloured or\r\nspotted chocolate are objectionable. Spots or the grey colour alluded\r\nto may be caused either by damp or heat. At an ordinary temperature the\r\nfracture of the chocolate is hard, glassy and even. The quality of the\r\nfracture constitutes an excellent basis in judging of the manner and\r\nmethods employed in working up the raw material.\r\n\r\nCacao and chocolate that become thick and pulpy on boiling are in all\r\nprobability adulterated with meal, starch, dextrine or resin.\r\n\r\nThe following are to be considered as adulterations:\r\n\r\n1. Admixtures of cacao or other shells, and sawdust.\r\n\r\n2. Admixtures of foreign starch, meals, castania and resin.\r\n\r\n3. Admixtures of mineral substances like ochre, clay and sand.\r\n\r\n4. The substitution of cheaper fats, such as beef and pork dripping,\r\nalmond, poppy seed, cocoa-nut and vaseline oils.\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations.\r\n\r\n1. For ~cacao material~.\r\n\r\n  Ash { Maximum: 5% (Porto Cabello 4·65%)[226]\r\n      { Minimum: 2% (Surinam 2·25%)\r\n  Cacao butter { Maximum: 54·5% (Machalla 54·06)\r\n               { Minimum: 48·0% (Porto Cabello 45·87).[226]\r\n\r\n2. ~For cacao fat.~ Melting point 29 to 33·5° C.; freezing point\r\n24 to 25° C.; refraction at 40° C., 46 to 49[226]; iodine value 34 to\r\n37; point of saponification, 192 to 202.\r\n\r\n3. ~Disintegrated cacao~: the amount of added alkali is not to\r\nexceed 3%. In no case shall the ash content be more than 8%. This\r\nfigure is not inconsistent with the above stated maximum ash content,\r\nas disintegrated or soluble cacao is manufactured from a mixture of\r\nseveral sorts of cacao, in each of which (although they have been\r\ndefatted) there is not more than 5% of ash.\r\n\r\n4. ~Chocolate~: although at the present time there are no limits\r\nfixed for cacao and sugar, it may nevertheless be safely assumed that\r\nthe fat and sugar together may not exceed 80 to 85%, and that the rest\r\nshall be pure non-fatty cacao material, in the proportion of from\r\n15-20%. The ash in a good chocolate does not exceed 3·5%.\r\n\r\n5. ~Milk chocolate~: here the separate ingredients require a\r\nthorough drying. If the percentage of moisture amounts to as much as\r\nfive percent, the whole preparation is objectionable and liable to\r\nlose its hard consistency.\r\n\r\n6. ~Chocolate~ à la noisette, ~oat~, ~meat~ and\r\n~medicinal chocolates~. The testing of these takes two chief\r\ndirections:\r\n\r\n 1. It must be established that the ingredients given on the label are\r\n of good quality, and\r\n\r\n 2. that only the ingredients there mentioned occur in the packet.\r\n\r\nThe constituents and their proportions shall be declared on the\r\nwrappers in the case of medicinal chocolate.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st July then, in the year 1909, the act passed in connection\r\nwith foods and articles of consumption December 5th, 1905 came into\r\nforce in Switzerland. Thereby the whole of Swiss trade in such\r\nfoodstuffs and articles of consumption is systematically controlled.\r\nOf the 268 articles which are generally representative, we annex here\r\nthose concerning cacao, powder and chocolate, namely, nos 146 to 149.\r\n\r\n=Art. 146.= Under the designation ~cacao~ or ~cacao powder~\r\nonly the pure, unaltered or only partially defatted natural product may\r\nbe brought into commerce.\r\n\r\nA cacao powder may only be described as ~soluble~ when it has been\r\ntreated with carbonic acid alkalis or disintegrated with steam.\r\n\r\nSoluble cacao may only contain 3% added alkalis on the outside.\r\n\r\n=Art. 147.= Under the designation ~chocolate~, only a mixture of\r\ncacao and sugar with or without addition of cacao butter and spices is\r\nto be understood, and no other may be brought on the market as such.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of sugar in chocolate may not exceed 68.[227]\r\n\r\n=Art. 148.= Cacao and chocolate may not contain starch, meal, foreign\r\nfat, mineral substances, colouring matter and so-called fat economisers\r\n(dextrine, gelatine, resin and tragacanth) and only traces of cacao\r\nshell. They may not be gritty nor foul smelling nor otherwise spoilt.\r\n\r\n=Art. 149.= Special products of cacao and chocolate with addition of\r\noats, milk, acorns and hazel nuts must be declared accordingly (as oat\r\ncacao, milk chocolate etc.). Fancy confections fall also under this\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\nCacaos and chocolates which are put on the market in packets, boxes and\r\npackages must contain the name of the firm on the wrapper, or some mark\r\nof the manufacturer or salesman which is recognised in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIf saccharine, dulcine or other artificial sweetstuffs are added to\r\nchocolate, such admixture must be declared on the wrapper.[228]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Austria.\r\n\r\nLegal control of the traffic in cacao preparations in this country may\r\nbe expected in the near future.\r\n\r\n~Austria~ is indeed already in possession of a law (dated January\r\n19th, 1896) concerning the traffic in articles of consumption, although\r\nthe special determinations have hitherto not reached perfection, and\r\nthe treatment of the separate detailed articles must proceed gradually.\r\nAs in Switzerland, the Association of Food Chemists and Analysts here\r\nhave worked out designs for a “Codex alimentarius austriacus The work\r\nof this code commission is of a purely private nature and accordingly\r\nno official importance accrues to it, but it is none the less\r\nrecognised by all Austrian chemists and has indirectly (and even in law\r\ncourts) about the same weight as the opinion of an expert, especially\r\nas the single articles of consumption are almost exclusively limited to\r\nspecialists in this country. We therefore introduce the most important\r\npoints of this code which bear on our subject, although various\r\nalterations must be made in these as they succeed to legal recognition,\r\nfor since the appearance of the code many changes have developed as\r\nregards the methods of research.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Cacao Mass.\r\n\r\n~Definition.~ Under cacao mass is to be understood the material\r\nconstituting a regular and uniform dough when warmed, which has been\r\nexclusively prepared and manufactured from the shelled cacao bean.\r\n\r\n~Ingredients.~ Cacao material contains the same ingredients\r\nchemically as the shelled bean.\r\n\r\nMicroscopical investigation should only reveal the presence of seed\r\nkernel, and not particles of root, which should be removed in the\r\ncourse of preparation.\r\n\r\nThe ash may not exceed 3·5%[229], the fibre 3%[229], and the starch\r\n10·5%. The amount of fat figures at between 48 and 52 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Cocoa powder.\r\n\r\n(Pulverised cacao, defatted, and disintegrated.)\r\n\r\n~Definition.~ Hereby is understood the steamed preparations or\r\nthe powder obtained by expressing at least half the total fat from\r\nordinary cacao material and further grinding and sifting.\r\n\r\n~Characteristics.~ The cocoa powder shall on boiling with 20 to\r\n30 times its volume of water yield a suspension, in which there are no\r\ntraces of lumpy formation, and which does not show a sediment after the\r\nexpiration of a few minutes.[230] Should there be any such sediment, it\r\nshall be examined under the microscope.\r\n\r\nCocoa powder shall be sifted and ground free from meal, and may not, on\r\nsifting through a miller gauze (No. 12) show more than 5% of material\r\non the sieve.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of cocoa powder is modified according to the\r\ndegree of defatting. If 30 parts out of 100 are defatted, which is the\r\nusual procedure. If 30 parts fat are expressed from 100 parts cacao\r\nmaterial, which usually happens, then the cocoa powder contains 30%\r\nfat, 5% ash[231], 3·5% fibre, and 13%.\r\n\r\nThe amount of moisture shall not exceed 6%.\r\n\r\nThe fat shall be pure cacao butter.\r\n\r\n~Addition of alkalis is not allowed.~\r\n\r\nMicroscopical investigation as under I.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Chocolate.\r\n\r\n~Definition.~ Chocolate is the cacao material evenly and regularly\r\nworked up with cane sugar (refined, ordinary or coarse).\r\n\r\nThe completely uniform pasty mass, when warmed, is allowed to set in\r\nmoulds and then forms pieces of fatty appearance, finely granular or\r\nclose fracture (tablets, blocks).\r\n\r\nGood chocolate consists of 40 to 50 percent of cacao mass and 50 to\r\n60 percent of sugar.\r\n\r\nIt may also contain a small amount of harmless aromatic substances.\r\n\r\nShould the sum of the cacao fat and sugar in chocolate amount to over\r\n85 percent, it is termed “Sweetmeat chocolate”, and should the sum\r\nof those ingredients be more than 90 percent, the chocolate is to be\r\ndeclared as “Very sweet\r\n\r\nAll the ingredients in chocolate, after deducting the sugar, shall be\r\npresent in the same relative proportion and in the same condition as in\r\npure cacao mass (compare I).\r\n\r\nSweetened chocolate is an exception, in so far as it has had in its\r\npreparation an addition of cacao butter. Fine kinds are also prepared\r\nwith an addition of defatted cacao.\r\n\r\n~Unmoulded~ chocolate or chocolate powder shall answer to the same\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Cacao surrogate and chocolate surrogate.\r\n\r\n~Definition.~ Cacao preparations containing admixtures of meal are\r\nto be described as surrogates.\r\n\r\nThe addition of other substances than meal is inadmissible.\r\n\r\nAbsence of cacao husk is also required as in I, II, III.\r\n\r\nMixtures of cacao powder, sugar and meal are also to be regarded as\r\nsurrogates.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the addition of meal is to be distinctly noted by the\r\nseller on the article sold.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Couverture (coating mass).\r\n\r\n~Definition.~ This includes various preparations of pure cacao\r\nbutter and chocolate (or mixtures of chocolate with cacao butter and\r\ncacao mass), which form a thin liquid, when warmed, and are used for\r\ncoating or pouring over confectionery. All other substances (roasted\r\nhazel nuts or almonds and the like) shall be declared.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigation.\r\n\r\n~To be carried out without exception with all cacao preparations~:\r\n\r\n1. ~Determination of fat.~ The fat is extracted from the dry\r\nsubstance which has been mixed with an indifferent body (sand) by pure\r\nand absolutely dry ether (distilled over sodium) or by petroleum ether.\r\nCacao mass and chocolate must first be shaved or rasped.\r\n\r\n2. ~Jesting of the fat.~\r\n\r\na) Determination of the melting point in a capillary tube (three days\r\nafter the fat has been melted into the tube).[232] Pure cacao butter\r\nusually melts at 33° C.\r\n\r\nb) Determination of the iodine value; usually 35·0 with pure cacao fat.\r\n\r\nIt is further recommended to make a refractometric determination, which\r\nin a Zeiss butter-refractometer must be 46·5° at 40° C.\r\n\r\n3. The ~microscopic test~ of the substance, from which the fat and\r\nthe sugar have been removed.\r\n\r\n~The following are also essential~:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. With cacao mass.\r\n\r\nThe determination of fibre and ash.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Cacao powder.\r\n\r\nDetermination of moisture at 100° C., of the fibre and ash and\r\nexamination of the ash (quantitative determination of phosphoric acid\r\nand potash).\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Chocolate.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the sugar by polarisation of the aqueous solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Surrogates.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the starch.\r\n\r\nIf it is considered necessary to proceed further, then:\r\n\r\n1. Determination of theobromine by a modification of Wolfram’s method,\r\nthe method employed is to be exactly stated.[233]\r\n\r\n2. In the determination of starch, the gelatinisation is to be carried\r\nout under steam pressure and the inverted sugar gravimetrically\r\ndetermined with Fehling’s solution.\r\n\r\nAn opinion of the quality of the preparation can be formed from the\r\ntaste, smell and colour of the sample on boiling with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Germany.\r\n\r\nIn ~Germany~, unfortunately, there is at present no law, which\r\nregulates the trade in cacao goods. It is true that there exists the\r\ndecree of the 14th May, 1879 respecting the trade in food, alimentary\r\nsubstances and comestibles, which contains the usual penal enactments\r\nin regard to adulteration of food materials offered for sale. The\r\nenactments are supplemented with data relating to the administration of\r\nthe law, among which a definition of chocolate, as well as the means\r\nof judging as to the quality or its adulteration, are treated of. But\r\nthose data do not in all respects apply to existing conditions, nor\r\ndo they deal fully with the question as to what admixtures are to be\r\npermitted or prohibited, for in the introduction to the appendix A,\r\nthere is the following statement:\r\n\r\n“Like the former provision, the present one is not intended to be an\r\n~exhaustive~ description of all subjects of the kind referred\r\nto, but a compilation of those examples which appear to be especially\r\ncalculated to serve as an illustration of legislative requirements.”\r\n\r\nThe data referred to have not an officially authoritative significance,\r\nand they cannot be regarded as having established validity in\r\nconnection with the administration of the law by the police or by legal\r\nauthorities. (See: Commentary by Meyer-Finkenburg, page 116.)\r\n\r\nEven the complete publication of the “Vereinbarungen zur einheitlichen\r\nUntersuchung von Nahrungs-und Genußmitteln sowie Gebrauchsgegenständen\r\nfür das Deutsche Reich”, collected at the instance of the national\r\nhealth department, will not have the effect of giving certainty in\r\nthe law relating to the manufacture of chocolate. That section of the\r\n“Vereinbarungen”, which deals with cacao products, was published in\r\nBook III (Berlin, Julius Springer 1912) pages 68-81, but the conditions\r\nin Germany are at present only similar to those existing in Switzerland\r\nand in Austria. The “Vereinbarungen” are nothing more, than a valuable\r\nsemiofficial guide for the valuation and examination of food and\r\ncomestibles, the provisions of which, not being obligationary, have\r\nno legal effect. They have long been in need of a thorough revision,\r\nas recent scientifical results testify, and indeed “The Voluntary\r\nassociation of German Food Chemists” have for years been engaged in\r\nsuch revision.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is, that the prosecution of various manipulation which\r\ncertainly deserve to be objected to, such as the preparation of cacao\r\nor chocolate from undecorticated beans, would be difficult to carry\r\nout. The Association of German Chocolate Manufacturers has protested\r\nagainst that unsuitable state of affairs, and since a remedy is to be\r\nlooked for only from the enactment of a law regulating the trade in\r\ncacao products, that association prepared a draft act, at its XVII.\r\nannual meeting at Leipsic on the 15th January 1893, and has submitted\r\nit to the government health department.\r\n\r\nThat draft is in accordance with the provisions printed on pages 231\r\nand 232 a-e. The provisions of the association in reference to the\r\ntrade in cacao products also contain the following paragraphs:\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be considered adulteration or counterfeit, within the\r\nmeaning of the law (§ 10) relating to trade in food materials,\r\ncomestibles or articles of consumption (of 14th May 1879,\r\nReichsgesetzblatt page 145):\r\n\r\n1. When the productions referred to under a, b, c are mixed with meal\r\nor other substances for medicinal purposes, provided, they are of a\r\ncharacter by which they are distinctly recognisable, or are kept in\r\nstock or offered for sale under a designation distinguishing them from\r\nchocolate, cacao mass, or cacao powder.\r\n\r\n2. When covering or coating material, or sweetmeat chocolate is mixed\r\nwith burnt almonds or hazel nuts to the extent of 5 %.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3.\r\n\r\nAdulteration within the meaning of the law dated May 14th 1879, § 10\r\n(Reichsgesetzblatt, page 145) comprises:\r\n\r\n1. The addition of foreign fat to chocolate, cacao mass or cacao butter.\r\n\r\n2. The addition to chocolate, cacao material or cocoa powder of cacao\r\nhusk, meal or other substances, except in the cases mentioned on page\r\n279, § 2, pos. 1 and 2.[234]\r\n\r\n3. The addition of colouring materials to chocolate.\r\n\r\n4. The addition to chocolate or chocolate surrogates of any but cane\r\nsugars (beetroot sugar).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, the terms of this proposed legislative step\r\nnaturally command approval and we should be the first to welcome the\r\nappearance of a “Deutsches Lebensmittelbuch” or some similar work[235],\r\nintended to serve as an authoritative regulation of the trade in cacao\r\npreparations and as a protection of honest manufacturers against the\r\nuncertainty now attending legal proceedings. In that case, other\r\ncivilised countries might be expected to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[162] Ztschr. öffentl. Ch. 1900, page 324, 325.\r\n\r\n[163] Ztschr. öffentl.

Baier\r\nindeed gives it as an average 1·0 but it varies considerably, as his\r\nown investigations show (8 tests of pressed or extracted fats), where\r\nthere are fluctuations of 1·65—2·37. Information kindly volunteered by\r\nProf. Härtel and our own experience convinces us that such fluctuations\r\nproceed generally from the Glycerine employed, which has itself a R.-M.\r\nnumber, sometimes even amounting to 1·0. It is therefore necessary to\r\nfix the standard of Glycerine used in the experiment, only too much\r\nneglected in professional investigations.\r\n\r\n[202] Loc. cit. p. 21.\r\n\r\n[203] As starting point it may be taken for granted that the R.

Various roundabout calculations are so avoided, when\r\nthe percentages of cream are thus immediately converted into the R. M.\r\nnumber, and the method is quite adequate for estimating purposes.\r\n\r\n[204] Method of Laxa-Baier, compare Z. U.

In commerce there are to be found many\r\npreparations designated as “pure cacao and sugar” which contain only 15\r\nor 20% of cacao with 50% of fat, which are said to met a need of the\r\npublic, but the maintenance will scarcely hold water.\r\n\r\n[223] The Roumanian law admits of the sale of a cacao prepared from the\r\nunshelled bean and only precludes secondary admixtures of shell.\r\n\r\n[224] Better albumose, or still better not included at all, as this\r\nconversion of the albumen is by no means proved.\r\n\r\n[225] Accordingly an addition of cacao butter would be objectionable.\r\nBut with 70% of sugar, admixture of cacao butter is unconditionally\r\nnecessary, where by the pure cacao material sinks to between 10% and\r\n20%.\r\n\r\n[226] Editor’s note: These figures are subject to correction, as they\r\ndo not tally with the majority of accepted results.\r\n\r\n[227] Cf. note on page 294 under 2.\r\n\r\n[228] Whilst in Germany such admixture is not permissible at all.\r\n\r\n[229] Editor’s note: These values would seem to require some revision,\r\nas generally only the very inferior cacaos, like St. Thomé, Domingo,\r\nCuba and Haiti, show a lower ash percentage than 3·5%; Ariba, Porto\r\nCabello, Caracas and Guayaquil cacaos show a higher percentage the same\r\nremark applies also to the fibre content.\r\n\r\n[230] This also requires revision, as on boiling 7·5 grammes cacao with\r\n250 grammes water there will always be a sediment after the solution\r\nhas stood for some minutes.\r\n\r\n[231] Requiring revision. Cf. remarks on previous page and also the\r\nvalues of raw fibre found by Filsinger. Editor’s note.\r\n\r\n[232] Requires revision, compare page 261.

Installation of a chocolate and cacao powder factory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn constructing a new factory and fixing the situation of the\r\nbuildings, the first thing to be considered is their convenient\r\narrangement. It is therefore advisable to rely upon an experienced\r\nperson for the plan to be adopted, and then to leave the proper\r\nconstruction of the works in the hands of the architect. Small\r\noperations can be carried on in any building, but in the case of larger\r\nworks a well devised arrangement of the machines and appliances must\r\nbe decided upon before hand, that will admit of rational and, to some\r\nextent, automatic working. In case of erecting small works which will\r\nrequire only one manager, the best plan would be to have the whole\r\nmanufacture carried out on one story, or at the most two stories, to\r\nfacilitate supervision.\r\n\r\nThe case is different with large works, in which the different\r\ndepartments are controlled by especially qualified persons.\r\n\r\nTables I and II[236] represent, in section, a chocolate factory and a\r\ncacao powder factory. As both plans represent only a model section,\r\nthey serve only to show the most convenient arrangement of the machines\r\nwith each other. In reality there would be more or less machines of the\r\nsame kind placed together. Such arrangements might, with modifications,\r\nserve for medium sized works, as well as for larger ones. In that sense\r\nthe following explanations of the two plans are to be understood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II\r\n\r\nLongitudinal Section of a model Chocolate Factory\r\n\r\nFor explanation of figures see text.\r\n\r\n  Zipperer, Manufacture of Chocolate etc. 3rd edition.\r\n  Verlag M. Krayn, Berlin W. 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III\r\n\r\nLongitudinal Section of a model Cocoa Factory\r\n\r\nFor explanation of figures see text.\r\n\r\n  Zipperer, Manufacture of Chocolate etc. 3rd edition.\r\n  Verlag M. Krayn, Berlin W. 10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. Chocolate factory= (Table I).\r\n\r\nBy means of the lift (1) all the raw materials, sugar, cacao, packing\r\nmaterials, etc. are carried up to the store rooms (2). In these occur\r\nthe machines for cleansing and picking the raw cacao beans. The raw\r\ncacao is fed into the elevator boxes (3), above the cleansing machine\r\n(4) where it is freed from dust; it passes to the continuous band (5)\r\nwhere it is picked and then falls into the movable boxes (6). It is\r\nthen transferred to the hoppers (7) and is fed, by opening a slide in\r\nthe hoppers, into the roasting machine (8). The capacity of the hoppers\r\nis sufficiently large for holding the quantity of beans for charging\r\nthe roasting machine. After the roasting is completed, the cacao is\r\nemptied into the trucks (9) and carried to the exhaust arrangement (10)\r\nwhere the beans are cooled down and the vapour given off is passed out\r\ninto the open air. At the same time, the roasting chamber is sucked\r\nout through the funnel shaped tube fitted to the cover of the chamber.\r\nThe roasted cacao is then passed to the boxes (11) to be conveyed by\r\nthe elevator to the crushing and cleansing machine (12). After being\r\ncleansed, the cacao is carried in trucks (13) to the hoppers (14) by\r\nwhich they are fed into the mills (15) in the lower floor. The sugar\r\nmill and the sifting apparatus (27) placed near the crushing and\r\ncleansing machines are also fed by a hopper from above. The dust sugar,\r\nthere produced, is carried by the lift (1) to the machine room on the\r\nfirst floor. Cacao and sugar are there supplied to the incorporator\r\n(16) to be worked together, before being passed to the rolling mill\r\n(17), where the final rubbing is effected. After passing once or\r\noftener through the mill, the finished chocolate mass is then taken\r\nto the hot room (18) where it remains in boxes until further treated\r\nand it is then taken to the moulding room. In the incorporator (19)\r\nthe mass acquires the consistence necessary for moulding and also the\r\nrequisite temperature. The mass is then taken in lumps to the dividing\r\nmachine (20) and cut into pieces of the desired size and weight. On the\r\ntable (21) the moulds, lying upon boards, are filled with the pieces of\r\nchocolate and they are then taken to the shaking table (22).\r\n\r\nFrom this they succeed to the cooling arrangement, which consists of an\r\nendless chain provided with travelling stages at definite and regular\r\nintervals. The latter moves slowly through the artificially cooled room\r\nand finally brings the moulds to the outlet (25) where the chocolate\r\nis removed. It is then transferred on the lift to the packing and\r\ndespatching apartments specially reserved for these operations, but not\r\ndistinctly noticeable on our section.\r\n\r\n=2. Cacao powder factory= (Table II).\r\n\r\nThe course of manufacture of cacao powder is the same as in the\r\nmanufacture of chocolate, up to the point where the cacao has passed\r\nthrough the crushing and cleansing machines (12). The broken beans\r\nare then taken by the elevator (27) to the machine for separating the\r\nradicles (28) and thence through the hopper (14) to the mills (15).\r\nThe liquid cacao mass, passing from these mills, runs into the pans\r\n(29) from which as much required for charging the hydraulic presses\r\nas is can be drawn up by cocks. The accumulator (31) supplies all the\r\npresses with water. The pressed cakes are first put into the boxes of\r\nthe frame (32). In an adjoining room is the automatic cacao pulverizing\r\napparatus. It is fed through the preliminary crusher (34) from which\r\nthe cacao is taken by the worm and elevator (35) to the pulveriser\r\n(36). The powdered cacao is then taken by a worm and elevator to the\r\nsifting machine (38).\r\n\r\nThe sifted powder falls into the tub (39) while the coarser portion\r\nis carried back again to the pulveriser (36). The arrangements for\r\ntreating and the disintegrating cacao powder can be provided in the\r\nmanner already described.\r\n\r\nIn both plans, the boiler and engine house are to be understood as\r\nplaced in an adjoining building.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[236] Both are designs of the firm J. M. Lehmann, by whom they have\r\nbeen obligingly placed at our disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\nContaining an account of the methods of preparation and the composition\r\nof some Commercial dietetic and other Cacao preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following statements and recipes have no pretension to be\r\ncomplete; they are only introduced to serve as a brief summary of\r\nthose commercial cacao preparations, now in commerce, which are\r\nmixtures of various kinds of substances with cacao or chocolate and\r\nare largely used for dietetic purposes. Notwithstanding its necessary\r\nincompleteness, the following account, which has been collected\r\nfrom various sources, will satisfy practical requirement, since the\r\nmanufacturer, as well as the food chemist, frequently desires to obtain\r\ninformation at once, that even a complete technical library is not\r\nalways able to supply. Medicinal chocolates have not been considered in\r\nthe following list, since they belong to the province of pharmacy.\r\n\r\n =Acorn-cacao Michaelis’= contains according to an analysis by R.\r\n Fresenius: Total nitrogen 2·29 percent, albumin 8·13 percent, sugar\r\n 25·17 percent, starch 23·39 percent, fat 14·42 percent, tannin,\r\n expressed as gallotannic acid 1·96 percent, cellulose 1·88 percent.\r\n\r\n =Acorn-cacao= of Hartwig & Vogel of Dresden contains water 7·5 per\r\n cent, ash 3·88 percent, fat 16·54 percent, albumin 11·25 percent,\r\n carbohydrates 38·76 percent, tannin 2·50 percent.[237]\r\n\r\n =Acorn-cacao= of Th. Timpe of Magdeburg contains in the dry substance:\r\n albumin 13·88 percent, tannin and cacao-red 5·37 percent,\r\n carbohydrates etc. 66·41 percent, fat 10·62 percent, ash 3·73 per\r\n cent.[238]\r\n\r\n Acorn-cacao can be prepared by mixing 10 parts of pure cacao mass, 20\r\n parts defatted cacao powder, 5 parts roasted barley meal, 35 parts of\r\n the meal from shelled and roasted acorns (or 10 parts of an aqueous\r\n extract of roasted acorns), 30 parts powdered sugar, and 2 parts pure\r\n calcium phosphate.\r\n\r\n=Acorn-chocolate= is a mixture of 100 parts shelled and roasted acorns\r\nwith 500 parts sugar and 400 parts cacao mass in addition to spices.\r\n\r\n=Acorn-malt-cacao (Dieterich)= is prepared by mixing 1 kilo of acorn\r\nmalt extract (Dieterich-Helfenberg) with 6 kilos of sugar (dust), and 3\r\nkilos defatted cacao.\r\n\r\n=Acorn-malt-chocolate (Dieterich)= is prepared by accurately mixing 2\r\nkilos acorn malt extract (Dieterich-Helfenberg) with 3½ kilos of\r\npowdered sugar and 4½ kilos of cacao mass.\r\n\r\n=Albuminous chocolate and cacao.= Riquet & Co. of Leipsic have\r\nprotected a process by various patents[239] for “The production of a\r\ntasty and genuine chocolate or cocoa powder[240] rich in albuminous\r\nconstituents.” The kernels of the thoroughly roasted bean are worked\r\nup with a mixture (?) of water and dry albumen, allowed to stand for\r\nsome time, the water evaporating, and then the beans are worked up once\r\nmore. Instead of water an aqueous sugar solution may also be employed,\r\nand further the addition of albumen may occur at any stage[241] and\r\nin particular when sugar solution is first taken, then the albumen\r\nand sugar necessary for the chocolate mixed up, and finally the cacao\r\nmaterial (with additions of cacao oil) added. Still better (than the\r\nsugar solution) would it be, if the albumen were incorporated in\r\nthe chocolate or cocoa material in the form of a mixture with some\r\nemulsion (!), especially a mixture with milk.\r\n\r\n=Barley-chocolate= is prepared by mixing 1 kilo of prepared barley\r\nmeal[242] 4½ kilos powdered sugar and 4½ kilos cacao mass. The\r\nmoulded chocolate is to be coated with varnish.\r\n\r\n=Cacao and chocolate preparations containing milk= are prepared\r\naccording to A. Denayer, Brussels (German patent No. 112220, 4 February\r\n1899) by evaporating, in the open air, a mixture of milk and sugar to\r\nthe consistency of cream, and to the hot mass, defatted or not defatted\r\ncacao is added in the form of powder. The resulting mixture is spread\r\nout in thin layers and exposed to the influence of a temperature of\r\n80-100°C. in a rarefied atmosphere, then finally completely dried at a\r\nlower or ordinary temperature under the same conditions.\r\n\r\n=Cacao-egg-cream= (so called African punch) is thus prepared: 10 yolks\r\nof eggs are beaten up with 300 grammes of syrup (1 part sugar to 2\r\nparts water) and, whilst being continually whisked up, 500 grammes of\r\ncacao essence (see next paragraph) are added. The whole is to be iced\r\nbefore being consumed.\r\n\r\n=Cacao-essence= is prepared by macerating 125 grammes of defatted\r\ncacao, 2 grammes vanilla, 2 grammes cinnamon, 0·75 gramme cloves, 0·3\r\ngramme mace and 0·10 gramme of ginger with 750 grammes of proof spirit\r\nand 250 grammes of water for 8 days, and then filtering into hot syrup,\r\nwhich is prepared with 550 grammes of sugar and 750 grammes water.\r\n\r\n=Cacao-liqueur.= A well tested recipe for the preparation of this\r\nliqueur is to the following effect: Defatted cacao 200 grammes,\r\ncinnamon powder 5 grammes, vanillin 0·2 gramme, are digested for 6\r\ndays with 1500 grammes of water and 1700 grammes of alcohol (90%) and\r\nthen mixed with 2600 grammes syrup (1400 parts sugar and 1200 parts of\r\nwater) and filtered.\r\n\r\n=Cacaol=, 70 parts cocoa powder, 10 parts oatmeal, 17·5 parts sugar,\r\n2·5 parts common salt.\r\n\r\n=Cacao-malt= is a mixture of 200 parts defatted cacao, 500 parts sugar\r\nwith an aqueous extract of 300 parts of kiln dried malt.\r\n\r\n =Cacaophen Sieberts= (Cassel) is a mixture of cacao powder with flour,\r\n sugar and milk albumin. It shows the following numbers on analysis:\r\n fat 13·23 percent, water 7·7 percent, albumin 24·25 percent,\r\n soluble carbohydrates 17·95 percent, insoluble carbohydrates (starch)\r\n 26·66 percent, woody fibre 2·27 percent, ash 5·5 percent (calcium\r\n oxide 0·82 percent, phosphoric acid (P_{3}O_{5}) 0·54 percent).\r\n\r\n =Children’s-Nährpulver (Lehmann-Berlin)= is a mixture of meat extract,\r\n cacao powder, salep, sugar and specially treated oyster shells.\r\n\r\n =Chocleau=, (Reichardt) a glucose chocolate material in tin tubes.\r\n\r\n =Chocolate-cream-syrup= (for aërated waters): 125 grammes of rasped\r\n chocolate, 62 grammes cacao powder and 325 grammes of water are well\r\n mixed and to this add 148 grammes infusion of quillaia (1·8). After\r\n standing some time add the contents of a pot of condensed milk with\r\n 7·5 grammes of boric acid and make up with 3·8 litres of sugar syrup\r\n (american recipe).\r\n\r\n =Chocolat digestif= (Vichy chocolate) is a mixture of chocolate with\r\n about 5 percent of sodium bicarbonate.\r\n\r\n =Chocolate-health-beer=, J. Scholz (German patent No. 28819). An\r\n extract is prepared from 10 kilos of cacao beans, which have been\r\n kiln-dried at 75° C., shelled, broken in small pieces and digested for\r\n half an hour with twice their weight of distilled water at 62° C.,\r\n then boiled for another half an hour and finally allowed to stand for\r\n 48 hours at a temperature of 75° C., with an addition of a solution\r\n of 10 kilos of sugar in distilled water, then once more boiled until\r\n one half of the water, originally added, has been evaporated. It is\r\n filtered, in as warm a condition as possible, in order to separate\r\n pieces of cacao and fat, and the extract is ready for use. The brewing\r\n process is similar to that of brewing Bavarian beer. After the\r\n finished wort obtained in that process has been boiled for 3 hours,\r\n 100 litres are taken, for which 35 kilos of pale kiln-dried barley\r\n meal have been used, and to this are added 200 grammes of the best\r\n Bavarian hops and 12 kilos of cacao extract. The whole is once more\r\n boiled and the subsequent operation then carried out as usual. The\r\n fermentation (at 7·5° C.) occupies 7-8 days and the storage in the\r\n fining vats 3-4 weeks.\r\n\r\n =Chocolat rétablière=, a Vienna speciality, contains reduced metallic\r\n iron, dried meat, pea and wheat flour, sugar and cacao in uncertain\r\n proportions.\r\n\r\n =Chocolate-syrup= (for soda and seltzer water). 250 grammes of\r\n defatted cacao powder are rubbed down with 2½ litres of boiling\r\n water in a porcelain basin on a steam bath, until it is in the\r\n condition of an uniformly thick mass and then 1 kilo pot of condensed\r\n milk and 2·5 kilos of powdered sugar are added, and when the sugar is\r\n dissolved the vessel is cooled. After cooling, the fatty particles on\r\n the surface are carefully removed, and then 30 grammes of commercial\r\n vanilla extract and 30 grammes of mucilage (from gummi arabicum) are\r\n added, and the whole filtered through a stout cotton cloth (american\r\n recipe).\r\n\r\n =Chocolate-tincture (cacao-tincture)= is prepared by macerating 1½\r\n kilos of defatted cacao powder with 10 kilos of dilute alcohol for 8\r\n days and then filtering.\r\n\r\n =Corn-cacao contains= according to Notnagel[243]: water 6·10 per\r\n cent., fat 16·96 percent, albuminoids 19·81 percent, theobromine\r\n 0·68 percent, fibre 3·30 percent, non-nitrogenous extractives\r\n 48·69 percent, ash 4·46 percent. The preparation under the\r\n microscope is shown to contain, in addition to the constituents\r\n of cacao, a large amount of oat starch, and it may be regarded as\r\n corresponding to a mixture of equal parts of defatted cacao and oat\r\n meal, based on the above analysis and König’s mean value.\r\n\r\n =Covering or coating materials= have the following composition: 50%\r\n sugar, 30-35% fat and 20-15% cacao material free from fat, whereby\r\n (especially in Belgium, e. g. Brussels) it is in part supplanted by\r\n almonds, nuts etc. In such cases the iodine value of the fat is equal\r\n to 41-42.\r\n\r\n =Diabetic chocolate= has the following composition.[244] Nitrogenous\r\n substance 10·07 percent, fat 25·47 percent, levulose 19·38 per\r\n cent, starch and cellulose 25·19 percent, besides non nitrogenous\r\n substances 14·54 percent, saccharin 0·5 percent, mineral\r\n constituents 2·15 percent.\r\n\r\n In this formula there is a disproportionately high percentage of\r\n starch and cellulose and, in that respect, the composition appears\r\n to be irrational, since the introduction of carbohydrates into food\r\n for diabetics should be avoided as much as possible. A more rational\r\n preparation would be a simple mixture of:\r\n\r\n  50 parts levulose | 50 parts cacao mass,\r\n  and 0·25 parts vanillin.\r\n\r\n Aufrecht’s recipe for =diabetic cacao= is as follows:\r\n\r\n  cocoa powder          500 grammes\r\n  levulose              200    \"\r\n  wheat flour           280    \"\r\n  saccharin               5    \"\r\n  aromatic substances    15    \"\r\n\r\n In this recipe, also, the substitution of levulose for wheat meal is\r\n to be recommended.\r\n\r\n=Diabetic cacao= can be prepared according to J. Apt of Berlin by\r\nthe following patented process (German patent No. 116 173, 30. 1.\r\n1900). The starch is first gelatinised by long boiling of the coarsely\r\npowdered cacao, the mass then dried in a vacuum and heated, or roasted\r\nat 130 to 140° C. in order to caramelise the gelatinised starch (!).\r\nBefore being boiled, it is recommended to de-fat the cacao (with\r\npetroleum ether, for example!). Instead of caramelising the gelatinised\r\nstarch by heat direct, it can be first converted into sugar by means of\r\nacid, then heated to caramelisation and as much cacao fat added as may\r\nbe desirable. In order to increase its capability of emulsifying, dried\r\nalbumin is to be added.[245]\r\n\r\n=Dictamnia= of Groult and Boutron-Russel is composed of cacao, prepared\r\nwheat flour, starch, sugar and vanilla.\r\n\r\n=v. Donat’s albumin chocolate= (German patent No. 82 434) is prepared\r\nby mixing dried albumin in powder or in pieces with chocolate or cacao\r\nmass, damped with a liquid medium, which does not dissolve albumin,\r\nsuch as benzol, petroleum ether, ether, acetone, methyl or ethyl\r\nalcohol. The mass is further treated in the mixer and finally after\r\nbeing completely mixed, the added liquid is allowed to evaporate.\r\n\r\n=Eucasin-chocolate and cacao= are preparations containing 20 percent\r\nof eucasin (ammonium caseinate). Eucasin is prepared by Majert & Ebers\r\nof Grünau-Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n =Galactogen-Cacao=, Thiele & Holzhause-Barleben near Magdeburg,\r\n contains 30-32 percent of galactogen, an easily soluble and natural\r\n preparation of milk albumin, which is prepared from skimmed milk and\r\n contains 70 percent albumin, 3·5-4 percent fat as well as 1·5-1·79\r\n percent phosphoric acid. ~Galactogen-amylaceous cacao~,\r\n contains wheaten flour in addition to 20-22 percent galactogen.\r\n Galactogen-Speise-Schokolade (eating chocolate with 30 percent\r\n galactogen and Galactogen-Koch-Schokolade (cooking chocolate) are also\r\n prepared.\r\n\r\n Plasmon, Jropon, Somatose and lacto-egg-powder are similar products to\r\n galactogen, and are met with in commerce combined with cacao mass and\r\n chocolate (see plasmon cacao).\r\n\r\n=Gaugau= is a children’s tea (Vienna) and consists of cacao husk.\r\n\r\n=Haema chocolate=: 25-30 parts cocoa powder, 25-20 parts meal (potato\r\nstarch), 45 parts sugar, 5 parts haemoglobin and common salt.\r\n\r\n=Hansa-Saccharin-Cacao= is defatted cacao, which contains about 0·5\r\npercent. saccharin (270 times as sweet as sugar), 30 percent fat and 20\r\npercent albuminoids (Hahn-Holfert).\r\n\r\n=Hardidalik=, an Asiatic chocolate, is composed according to Chevallier\r\nof 42 parts cacao, 180 parts sugar, 112 parts starch flour, 64 parts\r\nrice flour and 3 parts vanilla.\r\n\r\n=Hensel’s Nähr-Cacao=, is a mixture of defatted cacao-powder with\r\nvarious inorganic salts, such as calcium carbonate and phosphate;\r\nthe ash of this preparation was found to contain a larger amount of\r\nsulphuric acid, soda and iron, than is present in normal cacao. The fat\r\namounted to only 5·3 percent.\r\n\r\n=Homeopathic-Chocolate= of E. Kreplin, Lehrte, consists of 35 percent\r\npure cacao mass, 20 percent slightly roasted wheat flour and 45\r\npercent. sugar (Hager).\r\n\r\n=Husson’s Mixture= contains the following materials: Arrow root 500,\r\noat meal 500, powdered sugar 500, powdered sago 400, cacao 50, calcium\r\nphosphate 50, vanilla 1.\r\n\r\n=Hygiama= resembles cacao in appearance and flavour and was introduced\r\ninto commerce by Dr. Theinhardt’s Nahrungsmittel-Gesellschaft of\r\nCannstatt (Wurtemberg). It is prepared from condensed milk with the\r\naddition of a specially prepared cereal and defatted cacao. It contains\r\n22·8 percent of albumin, 6·6 percent fat, 52·8 percent soluble\r\ncarbohydrates, 10·5 percent insoluble carbohydrates, 2·5 percent\r\nfood salts, 4 percent moisture.\r\n\r\n=Iceland-moss-chocolate= contains 10 percent of iceland moss gelatine.\r\n\r\n=Kaïffa= (Fécule orientale) is a mixture of 500 parts cacao mass, 1250\r\nparts rice flour, 250 parts groats, 250 parts Iceland moss gelatine,\r\n2300 parts starch, 750 parts salep, 1000 parts sago, 6000 parts sugar\r\nand 50 parts vanilla.\r\n\r\n=Kola-Chocolate= is prepared by mixing 400 grammes of cacao mass, 450\r\ngrammes sugar, 100 grammes kola seeds in powder, 40 grammes cacao fat\r\nand 5 grammes vanillin sugar (3 percent).\r\n\r\n=Kraft-Chocolate (Mering’s).= This is a trade preparation in which\r\ncacao butter is converted into an emulsion, probably by means of oleic\r\nacid, and is thus rendered more digestible. Kraft-chocolate should\r\ncontain 21 percent of easily digestible fat.\r\n\r\n=Lipanin-Chocolate= contains 42·38 percent fat, albumin 8·07\r\npercent., starch 2·7 percent, sugar 31·44 percent, in addition to\r\nnon-nitrogenous substances 18·19 percent, ash 0·68 percent, as well\r\nas some vanillin and Peruvian balsam (Aufrecht).\r\n\r\n=Malt-cacao= according to Franz Abels (German patent No. 96 318, 9. May\r\n1896) is prepared in the following manner: The cacao mass after being\r\nmixed with malt meal is defatted by strong hydraulic pressure in order\r\nthat the malt may be permeated with cacao fat. It is then pulverized.\r\n\r\n=Malt-cacao-syrup= or =malted chocolate= is prepared by mixing 240\r\ngrammes malt extract and 24 ccm vanilla extract with about 950 grammes\r\nof chocolate syrup. Vanillin or essence of cinnamon may be used instead\r\nof vanilla extract. This preparation serves for the making of american\r\neffervescing lemonade.\r\n\r\n=Malt-chocolate.= 2 kilos of finely powdered malt and 3½ kilos\r\npowdered sugar, both well dried, are mixed in small quantities with\r\n4½ kilos cacao mass in the mixing machine. The tablets are to be\r\ncoated with varnish to preserve them. (E. Dieterich.)\r\n\r\n=Malt-extract-chocolate.= 4½ kilos of the finely rubbed down cacao\r\nmass, contained in the mixing machine, are intimately mixed with 1 kilo\r\ndried malt extract and 4½ kilos powdered sugar. The finished tablets\r\nare to be coated with varnish. (E. Dieterich.)\r\n\r\n=Malto-leguminose-cacao= gives the following numbers on analysis:\r\nwater 7·38 percent, nitrogenous substance 19·71 percent (18·26\r\npercent digestible), theobromine 0·71 percent, maltose 1·88\r\npercent., dextrin etc. 3·53 percent, starch 27·82 percent, besides\r\nnon-nitrogenous extractives 13·8 percent, fibre 2·36 percent, ash\r\n4·94 percent potash 1·74 percent, phosphoric acid 1·51 percent.\r\n\r\n=Meat-extract-chocolate= is prepared by placing 500 grammes of meat\r\nextract (Cibil’s or Liebig’s) in a porcelain basin and evaporating as\r\nmuch as possible on the water bath: 4·7 kilos of powdered sugar are\r\nthen added and the whole rubbed down with the pestle until the extract\r\nis homogeneous. 5 kilos of cacao mass are added and the chocolate\r\nfinished in the mixer. The moulded tablets must be coated with varnish\r\n(Dieterich).\r\n\r\n=Milk-cacao= is prepared with 1 kilo of condensed milk (prepared in a\r\nvacuum with the addition of 10 percent of milk-sugar[246] 500 grammes\r\nmilk sugar and sufficient powdered arrowroot to produce a paste, which\r\nis then rolled out, broken up and lightly baked. This milk biscuit\r\nis ground and passed through a fine hair sieve. 750 grammes of the\r\npulverized milk biscuit are then carefully mixed with 250 grammes\r\nof defatted cacao and 10 grammes of an aromatic mixture and the\r\npreparation finally preserved in metallic boxes.\r\n\r\n=A more bitter milk-cacao= can also be prepared with 50 kilos cacao\r\npowder and 50 kilos pure milk powder. This proportion may also be\r\nvaried, so that more milk powder may be used, as for example 40 kilos\r\ncacao powder and 60 kilos pure milk powder or 30 kilos cacao powder and\r\n70 kilos pure milk powder.\r\n\r\n=A sweet-milk-cacao= can be obtained thus:\r\n\r\n  a) 30 kilos cacao powder,\r\n     20   \"   powdered sugar,\r\n     50   \"   pure milk powder\r\n\r\n\r\n  b) 20 kilos cacao powder,\r\n     30   \"   powdered sugar,\r\n     50   \"   pure milk powder,\r\n\r\n  c) 15 kilos cacao powder,\r\n     35   \" powdered sugar,\r\n     50   \" pure milk powder.\r\n\r\n=Milk-chocolate= is prepared with 28 kilos of cacao mass, 36 kilos of\r\npowdered cane sugar, 24 kilos of milk powder and 12 kilos of cacao\r\nbutter. The material is very finely rolled at 60-70°C. in the grinding\r\nmachine described on page 000, and the finished mass not allowed to\r\nremain in the hot closet, but almost immediately moulded and packed.\r\nThe mild kinds of cacao (Ariba, Caracas, Ceylon, Java) are the most\r\nsuitable for making milk chocolate.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of ~pure milk cacao~, the cacao powder is\r\nworked up for some time in the warmed mixing machine, the sugar and\r\nthe milk powder being added successively. Cacao preparations, which\r\nare only used as beverages with water, should have at least two parts\r\nof pure milk powder to one part of cacao powder in order to yield a\r\nsuitable preparation.\r\n\r\n=Mutase-cacao= with 20 percent mutase: contains water 5·66 percent,\r\nfat 25·24 percent[247], albumin 28·31 percent, fibre 3·81\r\npercent., theobromine 1·67 percent, non-nitrogenous extractives 30·72\r\npercent, ash 6·26 percent.\r\n\r\n=Mutase-chocolate= (with 20 percent mutase) contains 16-17 percent\r\nof albumin. Mutase is an albumin preparation obtained, without the\r\nuse of chemical reagents, from nutritive plants, also containing the\r\nnutritive salts of the plant (10 percent). Mutase contains 60\r\npercent. of albumin.\r\n\r\n=Nährsalz-cacao (Lahmann), i. e. “Food-salt cacao= It contains water\r\n8 percent, nitrogenous substance 17·5 percent, theobromine 1·78\r\npercent, fat 28·26 percent, starch 11·09 percent, non-nitrogenous\r\nextractives 26·24 percent, fibre 4·21 percent, ash 4·7\r\npercent (potash 1·66 percent, phosphoric acid 1·56 percent).\r\n~Nährsalz-cacao or chocolate~ is prepared by mixing a vegetable\r\nextract (from leguminous plants) with cacao or chocolate. The analysis\r\nof ~Lahmann’s Nährsalz-chocolate~ gave the following numbers: fat\r\n24·5 percent, ash 1·36 percent, water 1·08 percent, albumin 6·25\r\npercent, phosphoric acid (P_{2}O_{5}) 0·44 percent.\r\n\r\n=Nähr-und Heilpulver.= (Food and health-powder) of =Dr. Koeben=\r\ncontains sugar, cacao, pollards and acorn coffee. (Hager’s Handbuch der\r\nPharmaceutischen Praxis.).\r\n\r\n=Natur-cocoa and natur-chocolate= (natural cacao etc.) Spindler,\r\nStuttgart (German patent No. 47226) are obtained by mixing cacao\r\nmass with hot honey. This effects a defatting of the cacao mass by\r\nspontaneous separation of the fat. The defatting can be suitably\r\ncarried further by pressing. Instead of using honey, the defatting can\r\nbe carried out with syrups, malt extract, condensed milk, fruit juices\r\nor plant mucilage (extracts from pulse).[248]\r\n\r\n=Nuco-cocoa= is a mixture of cacao with “nuco”, which is a highly\r\npraised preparation of albumin. The analysis of nuco cacao gave ash\r\n4·06 percent, moisture 6 percent, fat 15·23 percent, albumin 47\r\npercent, the iodine value of the fat is = 86. The fragments of tissue\r\nunder the microscope appear completely analogous to that of earth nut\r\n(arachis hypogaea). Nuco-cacao is consequently nothing more than a\r\nmixture of defatted cacao with defatted earth nut (earth nut cake).\r\n\r\n=Oat-cocoa, Hallenser (half and half)= contains 6·5 percent moisture,\r\n4·1 percent mineral constituents, 89·4 percent organic substances\r\n(containing 4·3 percent nitrogenous matter) digestible albumin 14·7\r\npercent, fat 17·2 percent, theobromine 0·77 percent, starch and\r\nother non-nitrogenous extractives 48·93 percent, cellulose 3·5\r\npercent. This is evidently a mixture of equal parts of oat meal and cacao\r\npowder as the name implies.\r\n\r\n=Oat-cacao Kasseler= (Hansen & Co.) is prepared according to the German\r\npatent No. 93500, 28th June 1896, by mixing oat meal with cacao. This\r\nmixture is moulded, pressed and, after being wrapped in perforated tin\r\nfoil, defatted by ether. It contains 7·2 percent moisture, 3·5\r\npercent mineral substances, 89·3 percent organic substances, which are\r\ncomposed of nitrogenous substance 3·9 percent digestible albumin 18·8\r\npercent, fat 18·3 percent, theobromine 0·46 percent, starch and\r\nother non-nitrogenous extractives 44·94 percent, cellulose 2·9\r\npercent.[249] It is likewise a mixture of 50 percent of oat meat with 50\r\npercent of cacao.\r\n\r\n=Oat-cocoa= can be simply prepared by mixing cacao powder with an\r\nequal part of prepared oat meal, such as is produced by Hohenlohe’s\r\nPräservefabrik, by Knorr of Heilbronn and by the Quaker Oats Company.\r\nIn order to cover the taste of the oat meal 1-2 percent of sodium\r\nchloride is to be added.\r\n\r\n=J. Berlit=, German patent No. 72449, describes the following method\r\nfor the preparation of =oat-cacao=, Oats are cleaned, bruised, slightly\r\nroasted and ground. The powder is wetted and by means of a kneading\r\nmachine worked up to a paste which is dried in a vacuum, finally ground\r\nand mixed with defatted cacao in the required proportions.\r\n\r\n=Palamoud des Turcs= consists of cacao mass, rice-meal, starch and\r\nsandal wood.\r\n\r\n=Peptone-cocoa= contains: water 4·08 percent, nitrogenous\r\nsubstance 20·56 percent, albumose 8·25 percent, peptone 4·41\r\npercent, theobromine 1·03 percent, sugar 49·51 percent, besides\r\nnon-nitrogenous constituents 9·37 percent, woody fibre 1·43 percent,\r\nmineral substance 4·17 percent (potash 1·97 percent, phosphoric acid\r\n1·21 percent).\r\n\r\n=Peptone-powder-cocoa= (20 percent) is prepared by mixing 20 parts of\r\nKoch’s meat peptone in the form of extract with 50 parts of sugar and\r\n40 parts cacao powder.\r\n\r\n=Peptone-chocolate= contains 10 percent of dry peptone.\r\n\r\n=Plasmon-chocolate and cocoa= contains 20 percent plasmon[250]\r\n(Siebold).\r\n\r\n=Racahout des Arabes= see page 00, note.\r\n\r\n=Raspberry chocolate= (Sarotti), German patent 181760 and 204603,\r\nprepared with addition of the juice of the raspberry.\r\n\r\n=Saccharin-cocoa= gives the following results on analysis: water 7·26\r\npercent, nitrogenous substance 20·5 percent, theobromine 2·09\r\npercent, fat 32·25 percent, saccharin 0·4 percent, starch 13·02\r\npercent, non-nitrogenous extractives 13·51 percent, woody fibre 5·27\r\npercent, ash 5·93 percent, (potash 2·16 percent, phosphoric acid 1·69\r\npercent). See also Hansa-Saccharin-cacao on page. 00.\r\n\r\n=Somatose-cocoa with sugar and somatose-chocolate= contains about 10\r\npercent somatose[251]; the first preparation contains 20·71 percent\r\ntotal nitrogenous substance, and the latter 10·24 percent, of which\r\nabout ⅓ consists of soluble nitrogenous compounds. (Mansfeld.) The\r\nfirst preparation could be readily prepared by mixing 10 parts of\r\nsomatose (Farbwerke Bayer &. Cie., Elberfeld) with 50 parts of sugar\r\nand 40 parts of cocoa powder.\r\n\r\n=Theobromade= (theobromine) is a dry extract from cacao husks.\r\n\r\n=Dr. Thesen’s Proviant= comes into commerce in the form of chocolate\r\nand is chocolate with an addition of albumin. Its analysis gives the\r\nfollowing results: Albumin 20·5 percent, theobromine 0·56 percent,\r\nfat 39·79 percent, carbohydrates a) (soluble) 26·95 percent, b)\r\n(insoluble) 5·66 percent, ash 2·25 percent, water 1·57 percent. A\r\nsimilar product to Thesen’s Proviant results from mixing: albumin 12·5\r\nparts, fat (cacao butter) 10 parts, fat (cocoa nut butter 7·5 parts,\r\nsugar 25 parts, cacao 45 parts.\r\n\r\n=Tropon-cocoa= is a varying mixture of tropon, 15-33⅓ percent, with\r\ncacao powder. A tropon cocoa containing 20 percent of tropon gave on\r\nanalysis: water 5·75 percent, albumin 38·49 percent, fat 27·77\r\npercent., fibre 3·76 percent, ash 4·51 percent, theobromine 1·6\r\npercent., extractives 22·78 percent.\r\n\r\n=Tropon-chocolate= is a chocolate containing 25 percent tropon.[252]\r\n\r\n=Tropon-Oat-cocoa= contains 20 percent of tropon, 30 percent of oat\r\nmeal and 50 percent of cocoa powder.\r\n\r\n=Wacaca des Indes= consists of 60 parts cacao powder, 165 parts sugar,\r\n8 parts cinnamon, 2 parts vanilla and some tincture of ambergris.\r\n\r\n=White chocolate= contains sugar 3000 parts, rice meal 860 parts,\r\npotato flour 250 parts, cacao butter 250 parts, gum arabic 125 parts\r\nand vanilla tincture 15 parts.[253]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[237] Hahn-Holfert, Spezialitäten und Geheimmittel, page 300.\r\n\r\n[238] Pharmazeutische Zeitung 1888, page 512.\r\n\r\n[239] German patent No. 182747 (Jan. 4th 1905) 182748 (May 4th 1906).\r\n\r\n[240] German patent No. 189733 (26th February 1906), 189734 (Dec. 11th\r\n1906).\r\n\r\n[241] Which would seem to be the only proper employment of the total\r\npatent claim.\r\n\r\n[242] According to Dieterich (Neues Pharmazeutisches Manual, 7. edition\r\npage 191) prepared barley meal is obtained as follows: 1 kilo barley\r\nflour is firmly pressed into a suitable metallic (tin) vessel, so that\r\nit is about ⅔ full and then heated on a water bath for 30 hours in\r\nall. After the lapse of 10 hours the powder is removed and ground in a\r\nmixer them again placed in the vessel and re-heated for 10 hours. After\r\ntwice repeating this manipulation, about 900 grammes of a reddish mass\r\nwill be obtained which is prepared barley meal.\r\n\r\n[243] Apotheker-Zeitung 1900, page 181.\r\n\r\n[244] Compare Aufrecht, Pharm. Zeitung 1910, page 558.\r\n\r\n[245] The absurdity of this process is too evident to need remark;\r\nwould it not have been better, if the process had not had the sanction\r\nof the patent mark? The treatment, which the cacao here undergoes, is\r\nso barbarous, that the product must always be spoiled. The only point\r\nattained is the complete gelatinisation of the starch, which by further\r\nheating is to some extent converted into dextrin. Caramelizing cannot\r\nand will not take place by heating gelatinised starch in mixtures\r\nwith a dry substance, as it occurs in cacao. But in addition, the\r\nclaim is weak that cacao so mistreated would be especially suitable\r\nfor diabetics, since cacao serves that purpose a great deal better.\r\nThe addition of albumin every properly disintegrated is not at all\r\nnew, for mixtures of albumin and cacao have existed for a very long\r\ntime.—Editor’s note.\r\n\r\n[246] Instead of which pure milk powder may also be used.\r\n\r\n[247] All cacao preparations, to which albumin is added, require a\r\nlarge amount of cacao butter as the albuminoids largely absorb the fat.\r\n\r\n[248] The composition of the preparation must be stated on the wrapper\r\nas such terms as “Natur-cacao” and “Natur-chocolate” are liable to lead\r\nthe purchaser astray.—Editor’s note.\r\n\r\n[249] Alfr. Beddies, Ueber Kakaoernährung, Berlin 1897.\r\n\r\n[250] Plasmon is an albuminoid preparation from milk, to which a little\r\nsodium bicarbonate is added to effect complete solution.\r\n\r\n[251] Somatose is a nutritive preparation made from meat and contains\r\nthe nitrogenous constituents of the muscle flesh exclusively in the\r\nform of an easily soluble albumose.\r\n\r\n[252] Tropon is a mixture of 2 parts flesh albumin (from muscle flesh\r\nand fish) and one part plant albumin.\r\n\r\n[253] The preparation must also bear on the wrapper a statement of its\r\ncomposition in order not to mislead the purchaser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.
