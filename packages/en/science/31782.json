It goes without saying that so vast\r\na social system as that of feudalism could not be perfected in a day, or\r\neven during one reign. Indeed, generations passed, and it was not until\r\nthe Age of Charlemagne that feudalism can be said to have taken some\r\nmeasure of shape and form. Between the Ages of Clovis and Charlemagne a\r\nperiod of turbulence ensued altogether peculiar to the combined\r\ncircumstances that feudalism was forced to struggle with two foes--one\r\ninternal, the disintegrating forces that ever accompany a new movement;\r\nthe other external, the stubborn and inspiring resistance, on the part\r\nof the native masses, to the conqueror from the wilds of Germania.\r\nHistorians, with customary levity, have neglected to reproduce this\r\ninteresting epoch in the annals of that social structure that is mother\r\nto the social structure now prevalent. The task was undertaken and\r\nsuccessfully accomplished by Eugene Sue in this boisterous historic\r\nnovel entitled _The Poniard's Hilt; or, Karadeucq and Ronan_, the sixth\r\nof his majestic series of historic novels, _The Mysteries of the People;\r\nor, History of a Proletarian Family Across the Ages_. The leading\r\ncharacters are all historic. It required the genius, the learning, the\r\npoetry, the tact, withal the daring of a Sue to weave these characters\r\ninto a fascinating tale and draw a picture as vivid as the quartos, from\r\nwhich the facts are gathered, are musty with old age.\r\n\r\nDANIEL DE LEON.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nTHE KORRIGANS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nARAIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOccasionally they are long-lived, these descendants of the good Joel,\r\nwho, five hundred and fifty years ago and more lived in this identical\r\nregion, near the sacred stones of the forest of Karnak. Yes, the\r\ndescendants of the good Joel are, occasionally, long-lived, seeing that\r\nI, Araim, who to-day trace these lines in the seventy-seventh year of my\r\nlife, saw my grandfather Gildas die fifty-six years ago at the advanced\r\nage of ninety-six, after having inscribed in his early youth a few lines\r\nin our family archives.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather Gildas buried his son Goridek, my father. I was then ten\r\nyears old. Nine years later I lost my grandfather also. A few years\r\nafter his demise I married. I have survived my wife, Martha, and I have\r\nseen my son Jocelyn become, in turn, a father. To-day he has a daughter\r\nand two boys. The girl is called Roselyk, she is eighteen; the elder of\r\nthe two boys, Kervan, is three years his sister's senior; the younger,\r\nmy pet, Karadeucq, is seventeen.\r\n\r\nWhen you read these lines, as you will some day, my son Jocelyn, you\r\nwill surely ask:\r\n\r\n\"What can have been the reason that my great-grandfather Gildas made no\r\nother entry in our chronicles than the death of his father Amael? And\r\nwhat can be the reason that my grandfather Goridek wrote not a line?\r\nAnd, finally, what can be the reason that my own father, Araim, waited\r\nso long--so very long before fulfilling the wishes of the good Joel?\"\r\n\r\nTo that, my son, I would make this answer:\r\n\r\nYour great-grandfather had no particular liking for desks and\r\nparchments. Besides, very much after the style of his own father Amael,\r\nhe liked to postpone for to-morrow whatever he could avoid doing to-day.\r\nFor the rest, his life of a husbandman was neither less peaceful nor\r\nless industrious than that of our fathers since the return of Schanvoch\r\nto the cradle of our family, after such a very long line of generations,\r\nkept away from Armorica by the hard trials and the slavery that followed\r\nin the wake of the Roman conquest. Your great-grandfather was in the\r\nhabit of saying to my father:\r\n\r\n\"There will always be time for me to add a few lines to our family's\r\nnarrative; besides, it seems to me, and I admit the notion is foolish,\r\nthat to write 'I have lived', sounds very much like saying 'I am about\r\nto die'--Now, then, I am so happy that I cling to life, just as oysters\r\ndo to their rocks.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that, from to-morrow to to-morrow, your\r\ngreat-grandfather reached his ninety-sixth year without increasing the\r\nhistory of our family with a single word. When he lay on his deathbed he\r\nsaid to me:\r\n\r\n\"My child, I wish you to write the following lines for me in our\r\narchives:\r\n\r\n\"'My grandfather Gildas and my father Goridek lived in our house quietly\r\nand happy, like good husbandmen; they remained true to their love for\r\nold Gaul and to the faith of our fathers; they blessed Hesus for having\r\nallowed them to be born and to die in the heart of Britanny, the only\r\nprovince where, for so very many years, the shocks that have elsewhere\r\nshaken Gaul have hardly ever been felt--those shocks died out before the\r\nimpregnable frontiers of Breton Armorica, as the furious waves of our\r\nocean dash themselves at the feet of our granite rocks.'\"\r\n\r\nThat, then, my son Jocelyn, is the reason why neither your grandfather\r\nGoridek nor his father wrote a line themselves.\r\n\r\n\"And why,\" you will insist, \"did you, Araim, my father, why did you\r\nwait so long, until you had a son and grandchildren, before you paid\r\nyour tribute to our chronicle?\"\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons for that: the first is that I never had enough to\r\nsay; the second is that I would have had too much to write.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" you will be thinking when you read this. \"His advanced age has\r\nderanged old Araim's mind. He says in one breath that he had too much\r\nand too little to say. Is that sensible?\"\r\n\r\nWait a moment, my son; be not in a hurry to believe that your old father\r\nhas fallen into his second infancy. Listen, and you will discover how it\r\nis that I have at once too much and not enough to write upon.\r\n\r\nAs to what concerns my own life, being an old husbandman, I have been in\r\nthe same predicament as my ancestors since Schanvoch--there never was\r\nsufficient matter for me to write about. Indeed, the interesting and\r\ncharming narrative would have run somewhat after this fashion:\r\n\r\n\"Last year the autumn crop was richer than the winter crop; this year it\r\nis the reverse.\"\r\n\r\nOr, \"The large black cow yields daily six pints of milk more than the\r\nbrindled cow.\"\r\n\r\nOr, \"The January sheep have turned out more woolly than the sheep of\r\nlast March.\"\r\n\r\nOr, \"Last year grain was so dear, so very dear, that a 'muid' of old\r\nwheat sold at from twelve to thirteen deniers. The price of cattle and\r\npoultry is also on the upward tack: we now pay two gold sous for a draft\r\nox, one gold sou for a milch-cow, six gold sous for a draft horse.\"\r\n\r\nOr, \"Will not our descendants be delighted to know that in these days a\r\npig, if good and fat, fetches twelve deniers in autumn, which is neither\r\nmore nor less than the cost of a bell-wether? And will they not rejoice\r\nto learn that our last coop of one hundred fat geese was sold last\r\nwinter at the market of Vannes for a full pound of silver by the\r\nweight? And imagine how well posted they will feel when they learn that\r\nthe day-laborers whom we hire during harvest time are paid by us one\r\ndenier a day.\"\r\n\r\nThat would hardly be considered either a charming or a thrilling\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, would our descendants feel more elated if I were to\r\ntell them:\r\n\r\n\"That in which my pride lies is the knowledge that there is no better\r\nfield-laborer than my son Jocelyn, no better housekeeper than his\r\nwife Madalen, no sweeter creature than my granddaughter Roselyk, no\r\nhandsomer and more daring lads than my two grandsons, Kervan and\r\nKaradeucq--especially the latter, the youngest of the set, my own\r\npet!--a very demon for deviltry, bravery and attractiveness. One should\r\nsee him, at seventeen years of age, break in the wild colts of our\r\nmeadows, dive into the sea like a fish, not lose an arrow out of ten\r\nwhen he shoots at the sea-gulls on the wing, along the beach, during a\r\nstorm--or handling the 'pen-bas,' our redoubtable Breton stick! Five or\r\nsix soldiers armed with lances or swords would find more sores than\r\npleasure if they rubbed against my Karadeucq with his 'pen-bas.' He is\r\nso robust, so agile, so dexterous! And then, he is so handsome, with his\r\nbeautiful blond hair cut round and falling over the collar of his Gallic\r\nblouse; his eyes of the blue of heaven, and his stout cheeks tanned by\r\nthe wind of the fields and the breeze of the sea!\"\r\n\r\nNo! By the glorious bones of old Joel. No! He could not have been\r\nprouder of his three sons--Guilhern the field-laborer, Michael the\r\narmorer, and Albinik the mariner; or of his daughter Hena, the Virgin of\r\nthe Isle of Sen--a now deserted island that, at this moment, looking out\r\nat the window, I see yonder, far away, almost in the open sea, veiled in\r\nmist. No! The good Joel could not be any prouder of his family than I,\r\nold Araim, am of my grandchildren! But the sons of Joel either fought\r\nvaliantly for freedom or remained dead on the battlefield; and his\r\ndaughter Hena, whose saintly and sweet name is sung to this day and has\r\ncome down from century to century, disinterestedly laid her life on the\r\naltars of Hesus for the welfare of her country, while the children of my\r\nson will die, obscure like their father, in this corner of Gaul. At\r\nleast they will die free! The barbarous Franks have twice dashed forward\r\nas far as the frontiers of our Britanny, but never dared to enter it;\r\nour impenetrable forests, our bottomless marshes, our inaccessible and\r\nrocky mountains, above all our sturdy men, quickly up and in arms in\r\nresponse to the call of our ever-beloved druids, the Christian as well\r\nas the non-Christian druids, have rolled back the Frankish marauders,\r\nwho, however, have rendered themselves masters of our other provinces\r\nsince nearly fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nAlas! After nearly two centuries, the gloomy prophecy of the foster\r\nsister of our ancestor Schanvoch has been verified. Victoria the Great\r\npredicted it but too accurately. Long ago did the Franks pour over our\r\nfrontier of the Rhine; they have since spread themselves over the whole\r\nof Gaul and subjugated the land--except our Breton Armorica.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons why old Araim believed that neither as a father\r\nnor a Breton did his obscure happiness deserve to be chronicled in our\r\nfamily records, and these are the reasons why, alas! he had too much to\r\nwrite as a Gaul. Is not the account of the defeat, the shame, the\r\nrenewed slavery of our common country, too much to write about, although\r\nwe here in Britanny are ourselves free from the misfortunes that\r\noverwhelm our brothers elsewhere?\r\n\r\n\"But,\" meseems I hear you, my son Jocelyn, still insist, \"why should old\r\nAraim, who has too little or too much to say, why should he begin his\r\nnarrative to-day, rather than yesterday, or why did he not postpone\r\nstarting to write until to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nThis is my answer, my son:\r\n\r\nRead the narrative that I am now writing on that winter's evening when\r\nyou, your wife and your children will gather by the fire in the large\r\nhall of our farmhouse and await the return of my pet Karadeucq, who left\r\nfor the chase early in the morning promising to bring home a stag. Read\r\nthis narrative, it will recall to your mind the family gathering of the\r\nprevious evening, my son Jocelyn--it will also inform you of something\r\nthat you do not know. You will not thereafter ask again:\r\n\r\n\"Why did good Araim start this narrative to-day, and not yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFAIRIES AND HOBGOBLINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe January snow and hail are falling in torrents; the wind moans; at a\r\ndistance the sea roars and dashes inshore as far as the sacred stones of\r\nKarnak. It is only four o'clock in the afternoon, and yet it is night to\r\nall intents and purposes; the warmly stalled cattle are locked in; the\r\ngates of the farmyard are closed tightly out of fear of prowling wolves;\r\na large fire shoots up its flames in the fireplace of the hall; old\r\nAraim is seated in his armchair, at the chimney-corner, with his large\r\ngrey dog, its head streaked with the white of old age, stretched out at\r\nhis feet. The old man is at work on a net for fishing; his son Jocelyn\r\nis fashioning a plough handle; Kervan is adjusting new thongs to a yoke;\r\nKaradeucq is sharpening the points of his arrows on a flint-stone. The\r\ntempest will last till morning if not longer, because the sun went down\r\nlike a ball of fire behind thick black clouds that wreathed the isle of\r\nSen like a dense fog. Whenever the sun sets in that fashion and the wind\r\nblows from the west the tempest lasts two, three, sometimes four and\r\nfive days. The next morning Karadeucq will be out on the beach to shoot\r\nsea-gulls while they graze with their wings the still raging waves. It\r\nis the lad's amusement--my pet is such a skilful and expert archer!\r\n\r\nThe sea roars from the distance like rumbling thunder; the house rocks\r\nin the gale; the hail is heard clattering in the chimney. Roar, tempest!\r\nBlow, sea gale! Drop, both snow and hail! Ah! How good it feels to hear\r\nthe ice-laden blast thunder, when one sees his family merrily gathered\r\nin the house around a blazing fireplace! And then, the young lads and\r\ntheir sister whisper things to one another that make them shiver and\r\nsmile at once. For it does, indeed, look as if during the last century\r\nall the hobgoblins and all the fairies of Gaul have taken refuge in\r\nBritanny. Is it not a positive pleasure to hear tell during a tempest\r\nand by the fire those wonders to which one gives a lingering credence if\r\none has not seen them himself, and more so if one has seen them?\r\n\r\nThis is what the young folks are saying to one another. My grandson\r\nKervan starts the ball rolling as he shakes his head:\r\n\r\n\"The traveler who has lost his way and who should happen to pass\r\nto-night by the cavern of Pen-March will hear the hammers clang--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the hammers that beat in time while the devilish hammerers\r\nthemselves sing their song, the burden of which ever is: 'One, two,\r\nthree, four, five, six, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday--'\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is said they even add 'Thursday,' 'Friday' and 'Saturday,' but\r\nnever 'Sunday,' the day of the mass--of the Christians.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the traveler may prize himself happy if the little Dus do not drop\r\ntheir false coiners' hammers and start to dance, compelling him to join\r\nin their reel until death closes upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What dangerous demons those Dus must be, dwarfs no taller than barely\r\ntwo feet high! Meseems I see them, with their hairy and shriveled faces,\r\ntheir cats' claws, their goats' hoofs and their eyes flashing fire. The\r\nbare thought of them is enough to make one shiver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out, Roselyk! There is one under the bin. Look out!\"\r\n\r\n\"How imprudent you are, brother Karadeucq, to sport in that way over the\r\nDus! Those hobgoblins are spiteful things. I tremble when I think of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for me, were I to come across a band of these customers, I would\r\ncapture two or three brace of them, I would tie them together by the\r\nlegs like partridges--and off I would make with them--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! You, Karadeucq, are not afraid of anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justice should be done the little Dus. Although they do coin false\r\nmoney in the cavern of Pen-March, they are said to be excellent\r\nblacksmiths, and matchless in the shoeing of horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you may rely on that! From the moment a horse has been shod by\r\nthose devilish dwarfs, he shoots fire out of his nostrils; and as to\r\nrunning--as to running without ever stopping for breath--either night or\r\nday--to even take a look at his rider--\"\r\n\r\n\"Children, what a tempest! What a night!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine night for the little Dus, mother! They love storms and darkness!\r\nBut it is a bad night for the poor little Korrigans, who love only the\r\nmild nights of the month of May.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certes, I am dreadfully afraid of the hairy and clawy dwarfs with their\r\npurses full of false coin dangling from their belts and their\r\nblacksmith's hammers on their shoulders. But I would be still more\r\nafraid if I were to run across a Korrigan, only two feet high, combing\r\nher hair, and looking at herself in some secluded fountain, in the clear\r\nwater of which she is admiring those blonde tresses that they are so\r\nproud of.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Afraid of those pretty little fairies, brother Kervan! I, on the\r\ncontrary, have often tried to meet one of them. It is said positively\r\nthat they assemble at the fountain of Lyrwac'h-Hen, which lies in the\r\nthickest of the large oak forest that shades several druid stones. I\r\nhave gone thither three times--and all the three times I saw nothing--\"\r\n\r\n\"Luckily for you that you saw nothing Karadeucq, because it is said that\r\nthe Korrigans never meet for their nocturnal dances except near the\r\nsacred stones. Woe to him who sees them!\"\r\n\r\n\"I gather that they are expert musicians and that they sing like\r\nnightingales.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is also said of them that they like to pilfer food like cats. Yes,\r\nKaradeucq, you may laugh--but you should believe me; I am no fibber,\"\r\nobserved his sister indignantly. \"I have heard the rumor that at their\r\nnocturnal feasts they spread upon the sward, but always near a fountain,\r\na cloth white as snow, and woven of the dainty thread that we find in\r\nsummer on the meadows. In the very center of the cloth they place a\r\ncrystal cup that shines so brightly, so very brightly, that it serves\r\nthe fairies for a torch. People add that a single drop of the liquid in\r\nthe cup would make one as wise as God.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do the Korrigans eat on that table cloth as white as snow? Do\r\nyou know, Karadeucq, you who love them so much?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dear little darlings! It can not be costly to nourish their rosy\r\nand transparent bodies that are hardly two feet high. Sister Roselyk\r\nsays they are gourmands. What is it they eat? The juice of night\r\nflowers, served upon gold grass blades?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gold grass blades? That superb grass that, if you step upon it, puts\r\nyou to sleep and imparts to you the knowledge of the language of\r\nbirds--\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do the Korrigans drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dew of heaven in the azure shell of wrens' eggs--what boozers they\r\nare! But at the slightest sound of human feet--off they vanish. They\r\nvanish into the fountain and return to their crystal and coral palace at\r\nthe bottom of the water. It is to the end of being able to escape\r\nquickly the sight of men that they always stay near the water. Oh, the\r\npretty little fairies! I would give my best bow and twenty arrows, I\r\nwould give all my fishing nets, I would give ten years, twenty years of\r\nmy life to see a Korrigan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Karadeucq, my son, make not such impious vows on such a stormy night as\r\nthis--it may bring ill luck--I have never heard the enraged sea roar\r\nlike this--it sounds like thunder--\"\r\n\r\n\"Good mother, I would brave murky darkness, tempest and thunder to see a\r\nKorrigan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, rash boy, hold your tongue--do not say such words!\"\r\n\r\n\"What a bold and venturesome lad you are, my boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather, you should join us in scolding my brother Karadeucq\r\ninstead of encouraging him in his dangerous wishes. Do you not know--\"\r\n\r\n\"What, my blonde Roselyk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! grandfather, the Korrigans steal the children of poor mothers and\r\nput little monsters in their place. The song so has it--\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's hear that song, my little Roselyk.\"\r\n\r\n\"It runs this way, grandfather:\r\n\r\n     \"Mary is very sad; she has lost her little Laoik; the Korrigan\r\n     snatched him away.\r\n\r\n     \"As I went to the spring for water I left my Laoik in his cradle;\r\n     when I came back to the house, my little one was gone far away.\r\n\r\n     \"And in its place the Korrigan left me this monster--with a face as\r\n     red as a toad's; he scratches and bites.\r\n\r\n     \"And all day he wants to be nursed, and yet he is seven years\r\n     old--and yet he wants to be nursed.\r\n\r\n     \"Mary is very sad; she has lost her little Laoik; the Korrigan\r\n     snatched him away!\r\n\r\n\"That is the song, grandfather. And will brother still want to meet the\r\nwicked things, these Korrigan fairies who snatch away babes?\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you now to say in defense of your fairies, my pet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather, my sweet sister Roselyk has been imposed upon by evil\r\ntongues. All mothers with ugly urchins for children declare that the\r\nKorrigans substituted a little monster for their darling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well answered, my grandson!\"\r\n\r\n\"And, on my part, I maintain that the Korrigans are, on the contrary,\r\nsweet and serviceable. Do you know the valley of Helle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dare-devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"One time the finest hay in the world was to be got in that valley--\r\n\r\n\"'Hay from Helle, perfumed hay.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was thanks to the Korrigans--\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? Tell me how--\"\r\n\r\n\"When the time for mowing and haymaking came around, the Korrigans\r\narrived and camped on the crests of the rocks around the valley to watch\r\nover the meadow. If during the day the sun parched the grass too much,\r\nthe Korrigans caused a plentiful dew to drop. When the grass was mowed,\r\nthey scattered the clouds that might have interfered with the making of\r\nhay. A foolish and wicked bishop wanted to chase away the pretty and\r\nkind fairies. He caused a large heather fire to be kindled early one\r\nnight all over the rocks; when these were sufficiently hot, the ashes,\r\nwere all carefully removed. At their regular hour, and suspecting\r\nnothing, the dear Korrigans came to hold watch over the meadow, but they\r\ninstantly burned their feet on the hot rocks. They then wept and cried:\r\n'Oh! Wicked world! Oh! Wicked world!' Since then they never more\r\nreturned to the place, and as a consequence, ever since, the hay has\r\nbeen either rotted by the rain, or burned by the sun in the valley of\r\nHelle. That is what comes of being unkind to the Korrigans. No, I shall\r\nnot die happy if I do not see at least one of them--\"\r\n\r\n\"Children, children, put no faith in such witcheries; above all never\r\nwish to witness any. It brings bad luck--\"\r\n\r\n\"What, mother, simply because I desire to see a Korrigan, some\r\nmisfortune will befall me? What kind of misfortune?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hesus only knows, wild boy! I wish you would keep still; your talk\r\nfrightens me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a tempest! The house shakes!\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is on such a night that Karadeucq dared to say he would give his\r\nlife to see a Korrigan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, dear wife, your fears only show weakness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mothers are weak and timid, Jocelyn. We must not tempt God--\"\r\n\r\nOld Araim stops working for a moment at his net; his head drops on his\r\nchest.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, folks? You seem to be in a brown study! Do you\r\nfear, like Madalen, that danger may threaten Karadeucq just because, on\r\nsuch a tempestuous night as this, he wishes to see a Korrigan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not thinking of the fairies; I am thinking of this frightful\r\nstorm, Jocelyn. I read to you and your children the narrative of our\r\nancestor Joel, who lived about five hundred and odd years ago, if not in\r\nthis very house, at least in the neighborhood of where we now are. I was\r\nthinking that on a somewhat similar stormy night, Joel and his son, both\r\ngreedy after stories like the inquisitive Gauls that they were--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the trick of stopping a traveler at the pass of Craig'h, binding\r\nhim fast, and carrying him home to tell stories--\"\r\n\r\n\"And the traveler happened to be the Chief of the Hundred Valleys--a\r\nhero!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Oh! How your eyes sparkle as you speak, Karadeucq.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they sparkle, grandfather, it is because they are moist. Whenever I\r\nhear you speak of the Chief of the Hundred Valleys tears come to my\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with Erer, father? The dog growls between his teeth\r\nand pricks up his ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather, do you hear the watchdog bark?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something must be going on outside of the house--\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! If it is the gods who wish to punish my son for his audacious\r\nwishes, their anger is swift--Karadeucq, come near me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Madalen--there you are weeping and embracing the boy, as if\r\nreally misfortune threatened him. Come, be more sensible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not hear the dogs barking louder and louder? And there is Erer\r\nnow running to the door. There is something wrong going on outside--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, mother; it is some wolf prowling about. Where is my bow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Karadeucq, you stay here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Madalen, be not in such fear for your son, nor you my sweet\r\nRoselyk for your brother. Perhaps it is better not to challenge the\r\nhobgoblins and fairies on a stormy night, but your fears are idle. There\r\nis no wolf prowling about here; if there were, Erer would long ago have\r\nbitten off the panel of the door and rushed to the encounter of the\r\nunwelcome guest--\"\r\n\r\n\"Father is right--it may be a stranger who lost his way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Kervan, come brother, let's to the gate of the yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"My son, you stay here by my side--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, mother, I cannot allow my brother Kervan to go out alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark! Hark! It seems to me I hear a voice calling--\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! mother, some misfortune threatens our house--you said it--\"\r\n\r\n\"Roselyk, my child, do not add fuel to your mother's fright. What is\r\nthere astonishing in a traveler calling from without to have the door\r\nopened to him--\"\r\n\r\n\"His cries are not human--I am frozen with fear--\"\r\n\r\n\"You come with me, Kervan, seeing that your mother wishes to keep\r\nKaradeucq near her. Although this is a quiet neighborhood, hand me my\r\n'pen-bas,' and take yours along, my boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"My husband, my son, I conjure you, do not go out--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear wife, suppose some stranger is outside in such weather as this!\r\nCome Kervan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! I tell you the cries that I heard are not human. Kervan! Jocelyn!\r\nThey will not listen--they are gone--Alas! Alas!\"\r\n\r\n\"My father and brother go out to face danger, and I remain here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not stamp your feet that way, bad boy! You are the cause of all this\r\nevil with your impious wishes--\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, Madalen--and you, my pet, do not put on, if you please,\r\nthe air of a wild colt that seeks to snap his reins; just obey your\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear steps--they are drawing near--Oh! grandfather!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear Roselyk, why tremble? What is there frightful in the\r\nsteps that are approaching? Good--do you hear them laughing aloud? Are\r\nyou now at ease?\"\r\n\r\n\"Laughing!--on such a night!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is frightful to hear, is it not, my sweet Roselyk, especially when\r\nthe laughers are your own father and brother? Well--here they are. Well,\r\nmy children?\"\r\n\r\n\"The misfortune that threatened our house--\"\r\n\r\n\"The cries that were not human--\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be done laughing? Just look at them! The father is as crazy as\r\nthe son! Will you speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"The great misfortune is a poor peddler who lost his way--\"\r\n\r\n\"The voice that was not human was his voice--\"\r\n\r\nAnd father and son laughed merrily, it must be admitted, like people who\r\nare happy to find their apprehensions unfounded. The mother's fears,\r\nhowever, were not so quickly allayed; she did not join the laughter; but\r\nboth the boys, the girl and even Jocelyn himself, all cried out\r\njoyously:\r\n\r\n\"A peddler! A peddler!\"\r\n\r\n\"He has pretty ribbons and fine needles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Iron for arrows, strings for bows, scissors to clip the sheep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nets for fishing, seeing that he comes to the seashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will tell us the news of outlying places.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is he? Where is the good peddler that Hesus sends to us to\r\nhelp enliven this long winter's night?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a happiness to be able to see all his merchandise at one's ease!\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is he? Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is shaking off the ice that his clothes are frozen stiff with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good mother, now see the misfortune that threatened us because I wished\r\nto see a Korrigan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be still, son! To-morrow rests with God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is the peddler! Here he is!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHEVIN THE PEDDLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who stepped into the house gave at the threshold a last shake to\r\nhis traveling boots, which were so covered with snow that he seemed to\r\nbe clad in white hose. He was of a robust frame, but squat and square,\r\nin the full strength of manhood, jovial and of an open yet determined\r\nface. Still uneasy, Madalen did not take her eyes from him, and twice\r\nshe made a sign to her son to return to her side. Removing the hood from\r\nhis thick, ice-pearled coat, the peddler laid down his bulky bale, a\r\nheavy burden that, however, seemed light to his sturdy shoulders. He\r\nthen removed his cap and stepped towards Araim, the oldest member of the\r\nhousehold:\r\n\r\n\"Long life and happy days to hospitable people! This is Hevin the\r\nPeddler's wish to yourself and your family. I am a Breton. I was going\r\nto Falgoët, when the night and the tempest overtook me on the beach. I\r\nsaw the light of this house from a distance; I came, I called, and the\r\ndoor was opened to me. Thanks to you all, thanks to hospitable people!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madalen, what gives you that absent and pensive look? Do not the\r\npeddler's pleasant face and kind words set you at ease?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, to-morrow rests with God--I feel all the more uneasy since the\r\nstranger's arrival.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak lower, lower still, dear daughter. The poor fellow might overhear\r\nyou and be grieved. Oh! these mothers! these mothers!\"\r\n\r\nAnd addressing the stranger:\r\n\r\n\"Draw near the fire, you sturdy peddler. The night is rough. Karadeucq,\r\nwhile we wait for supper, fetch a pot of hydromel for our guest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept, good old man! The fire will warm me from without, the\r\nhydromel from within.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be a gay stroller.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am. Joy is my companion; however long or rough my road may be, joy\r\nnever tires of following me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here--drink--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your health, good mother and sweet girl; to the health of you all--\"\r\n\r\nAnd clicking his tongue against the roof of his mouth: \"This is the best\r\nhydromel I ever tasted. A cordial hospitality renders the best of\r\npotions still better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you come from afar, gay stroller?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean since I started this morning or since the beginning of my\r\njourney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, since the beginning of your journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is now two months since I departed from Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the city of Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does that surprise you, good old man?\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Cross half Gaul in such times as these, when the cursed Franks\r\noverrun the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am an old roadster. For the last twenty years I have crossed Gaul\r\nfrom end to end. Is the main road hazardous, I take the by-path. Is the\r\nplain risky, I go over the mountain. Is it dangerous to travel by day, I\r\njourney by night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you not been rifled a hundred times by those thievish Franks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am an old roadster, I tell you. Accordingly, before entering\r\nBritanny, I bravely donned a priest's robe, and painted on my pack a big\r\ncross with flames red as hell-fire. The Frankish thieves are as stupid\r\nas they are savage; they fear the devil, whom the bishops frighten them\r\nwith in order to share with them the spoils of Gaul. They would not\r\ndare to attack me, taking me for a priest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, supper is ready--to table,\" said old Araim; and addressing his\r\nson's wife, who continued to give signs of preoccupation, he said to her\r\nin a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Madalen? Are you still thinking of the Korrigans?\"\r\n\r\n\"This stranger who disguises himself in the robe of a priest without\r\nbeing one will bring misfortune over our house. The tempest's fury seems\r\nto have redoubled since he came in.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an impossible thing to allay a mother's apprehensions once they\r\nare aroused.\r\n\r\nThe family and the guest sat down to table, ate and drank. The peddler\r\ndrank and ate like a man to whom the road imparts a good appetite. The\r\njaws did their ample duty; teeth and tongues played their parts well;\r\nthe family was in good spirits. It is not every long winter's night that\r\none has a peddler from Paris in his company.\r\n\r\n\"And what is going on in Paris, brave roadster?\"\r\n\r\n\"The most satisfactory thing that I have seen in the city was the\r\nburying of the King of the cursed Franks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Is their King dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"He died more than two months ago--on the 25th of November of last year,\r\nof the year 512 of the 'Incarnation of the Word,' as the bishops say who\r\nblessed and gave sepulchre to the crowned murderer in the basilica of\r\nthe Holy Apostles at Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! He is dead, that Frankish King! And what was his name?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had a devil of a name, Hlode-Wig.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must choke one to pronounce it--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hlode-Wig was his name. His wife, whom they call the Queen, is no less\r\nhappily endowed--her name is Chrotechild--and her four children are\r\nnamed Chlotachaire, Theudeber--\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough! Friend peddler! A truce of those savage names! Those who wear\r\nthem are worthy of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are, as you may judge by the deceased Hlode-Wig, or Clovis,\r\nas he is popularly pronounced; and his family bids fair to surpass even\r\nhim. Imagine gathered in that monster, whom St. Remi baptised a son of\r\nthe Church--imagine gathered in that one monster the cunning of the fox\r\nand the cowardly ferocity of the wolf. To enumerate to you the murders\r\nthat he committed with his dagger or his axe would take too long. I\r\nshall only mention some of the leading ones. An old Frankish chief, a\r\nhunchback named Sigebert, was King of Cologne. This is the way these\r\nbandits become Kings: they pillage and ravage a province at the head of\r\na band, massacre or sell like so many heads of cattle men, women and\r\nchildren, reduce the rest of the inhabitants to slavery, and then they\r\nsay: 'Here we are Kings'; the bishops echo back: 'Yes, our friends the\r\nFranks are Kings here; we shall baptize them into the Church; and you,\r\npeople of Gaul, obey them or we will damn you!\"\r\n\r\n\"And has there never been found any courageous man to plant a dagger in\r\nthe heart of such a King?\"\r\n\r\n\"Karadeucq, my pet, do not heat yourself in that manner. Thanks to God,\r\nthat Clovis is dead. That is, at any rate, one less. Proceed, good\r\npeddler!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I was saying, Sigebert the hunchback was King of Cologne. He\r\nhad a son. Clovis said to him: 'Your father is old--kill him and you\r\nwill inherit his power.' The son sympathized with the idea and killed\r\nhis father. And what does Clovis do but kill the parricide and\r\nappropriate the kingdom of Cologne!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shudder, my children! I can well imagine it. Such are the new Kings\r\nof Gaul!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, you shudder, my hosts, at so little? Only wait. Shortly after\r\nthat murder, Clovis strangled with his own hands two of his near\r\nrelatives, father and son, named Chararic, and plundered them of what\r\nthey themselves had plundered Gaul of. But here is a still worse\r\nincident: Clovis was at war with another bandit of his own royal family\r\nnamed Ragnacaire. He ordered a set of necklaces and baldrics to be made\r\nof imitation gold, and sent them through one of his familiars to the\r\nleudes who accompanied Ragnacaire with the message that, in exchange for\r\nthe present, they deliver to him their chief and his son. The bargain\r\nwas struck, and the two Ragnacaires were delivered to Clovis. This great\r\nKing thereupon struck them both down with his axe like oxen in the\r\nslaughter house; he thus at one stroke committed two crimes--cheated the\r\nleudes of Ragnacaire and murdered their chiefs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet the Catholic bishops preach to the people submission to such\r\nmonsters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certes, seeing that the crimes committed by these monsters are the\r\nsource of the Church's wealth. You can figure it out for yourself, good\r\nold man, the murders, fratricides, parricides and acts of incest\r\ncommitted by the great Frankish seigneurs yield more gold sous to the\r\nfat and do-nothing bishops than all the lands, that your hard and daily\r\ntoil fructifies, yield deniers to you. But listen to another of Clovis'\r\nprowesses. In the course of time he had either himself despatched or\r\nordered others to massacre all his relatives. One day he gathers around\r\nhim his forces and says with a moan:\r\n\r\n\"'Woe is me! I am now left all alone, like a traveler among strangers; I\r\nhave no relatives left to help me in case adversity overtake me.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so at last he repented his many crimes--it is the least of the\r\npunishments that await him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He repent? Clovis? He would have been a big fool if he had, good old\r\nman! Do you forget that the priests relieve him of the burden of remorse\r\nin consideration of good round pounds of gold or silver?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why, then, did he use those terms; why did he say: 'Woe is me! I am\r\nnow left all alone, like a traveler among strangers; I have no relatives\r\nleft to help me in case adversity overtake me?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Another trick of his. No, in the language of a bishop himself who\r\nchronicled the life of Clovis, it was not that Clovis grieved over the\r\ndeath of all the relatives whom he had caused to be put to death; no, it\r\nwas a ruse on his part when he held that language, malefactor that he\r\nwas; he only wished thereby to ascertain whether there was any relative\r\nleft, and then to kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet was there not a single man resolute enough to plant a dagger in\r\nthe monster's breast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep quiet, bad boy! This is the second time that you have given vent\r\nto those sentiments of murder and vengeance! You only do so to frighten\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear wife, our son Karadeucq is indignant, like anyone else, at the\r\ncrimes of that Frankish King. By my father's bones! I who am not of an\r\nadventurous disposition, I say myself--it is a shame to Gaul that such a\r\nmonster should have reigned fourteen years over our country--Britanny\r\nfortunately excepted.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, who in my trade of peddler have crossed Gaul from end to end,\r\nand seen the country's wretchedness and the bloody slavery that\r\noppresses it, I say that the people's hatred should fall as heavily upon\r\nthe bishops! Was it not they who called the Franks into Gaul? Was it not\r\nthey who baptised the murderer a son of the Roman Church? Did they not\r\npropose to canonize the monster with the title of 'Saint Clovis?'\"\r\n\r\n\"God in heaven! Is it craziness or cowardly terror on the part of those\r\npriests?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is unbridled ambition and inveterate cupidity, good old man. At\r\nfirst, allied to the Roman emperors from the time that Gaul became again\r\na Roman province, the bishops succeeded by underhanded means to secure\r\nlarge endowments for themselves and their churches and to occupy the\r\nleading magistracies in the cities. That did not satisfy them; they\r\ncounted upon being better able to dominate the barbarous Franks than the\r\ncivilized Romans. They betrayed the Romans to the Franks. The latter\r\ncame; Gaul was ravaged, pillaged and subjugated, and the bishops shared\r\nthe plunder with the conquerors whom they speedily placed under their\r\nthumb through the fear of the devil. And so it happens that these\r\nsanctimonious men have become richer and more powerful under the\r\nFrankish than under the Roman rule. Now old Gaul has become their quarry\r\njointly with the barbarians; they now possess vast domains, all manner\r\nof wealth, innumerable slaves--slaves that are so well chosen, trained\r\nand docile to the whip that an 'ecclesiastical slave' generally fetches\r\ntwenty gold sous in the market, while other slaves fetch only twelve\r\nsous. Would you form an idea of the wealth of the bishops? This\r\nidentical St. Remi, who baptised Clovis in the basilica of Reims, and\r\nthus approved him a worthy son of the holy Roman Church, was so fatly\r\nremunerated that he was able to pay five thousand pounds of silver by\r\nthe weight for the domain of Epernay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Thus to traffic in the blood of Gaul! It is horrible! It is\r\nshocking!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! That is still nothing, good father. Had you traveled as I have done\r\nover regions that were once so flourishing, and seen them now, ravaged\r\nand burned down by the Franks! Had you seen the bands of men, women and\r\nchildren, bound two by two, marching among the cattle and wagons heaped\r\nwith booty of all sorts, that the barbarians drove before them after\r\nthey conquered the country of Amiens, which I then happened to\r\ncross--had you seen that, you would have felt your heart bleed as mine\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where did they take those men, women and children whom they carried\r\naway as slaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! good mother, they took them to the banks of the Rhine, where the\r\nFranks keep a large market of Gallic flesh. All the barbarians of\r\nGermany who have not yet broken into our unhappy country, repair thither\r\nto supply themselves with slaves of our race--men, women and children.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what becomes of those who remain in Gaul?\"\r\n\r\n\"The men of the fields are enslaved and made to cultivate under the rod\r\nof the Franks their own ancestral estates that King Clovis divided with\r\nhis leaders, his old comrades in pillage and massacre, and whom he since\r\nhas made dukes, marquises and counts of our country. But there are still\r\nsome drops of generous blood left in the veins of old Gaul. Even if the\r\nrule of the Franks and the bishops is to endure, they will, at least,\r\nnot enjoy their conquest in peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of the Bagaudy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, and praisefully, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the Bagaudy, grandfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me first answer our friend the peddler--it will be information to\r\nyou also. My grandfather Gildas told me that he heard from his father\r\nthat, a few years after the death of Victoria the Great, the first\r\nBagaudy took place, not in Britanny, but in the other provinces.\r\nIrritated at seeing herself again reduced to the level of a Roman\r\nprovince, as a result of the treason of Tetrik, and of being obliged to\r\npay heavy imposts into the empire's fisc, Gaul rose in rebellion. The\r\nuprisings were called 'Bagaudies.' They threw the emperor Diocletian\r\ninto such consternation that he hurried an army into Gaul to combat\r\nthem; at the same time, however, he remitted the imposts, and granted\r\nalmost everything that the Bagauders demanded. As you see, it is only a\r\nquestion of knowing how to present one's demand to kings and emperors.\r\nBend your back and they will load it to the breaking point; show your\r\nteeth and they remove the load--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, old father--beg them with clasped hands, and they laugh;\r\nmake your demand with clenched fists, and they yield--that was another\r\ngood feature of the Bagaudy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there were so many good features about it, that, towards the\r\nmiddle of last century, it was started against the Romans anew. That\r\ntime it spread as far as Britanny, to the very heart of Armorica. But we\r\nonly talked about it, there was no occasion for serious action. The time\r\nwas well chosen; if my memory serves me right, I was one of those who\r\naccompanied our venerated druids to Vannes, to the curia of that town\r\nwhich consisted of Roman magistrates and officers. To them we said:\r\n\r\n\"'You govern us Breton Gauls in the name of your emperor; you lay rather\r\nheavy imposts upon us, always in the name and for the benefit of the\r\nsame emperor. For a long time we have found that very unjust. We enjoy,\r\nit is true, our freedom and citizen rights. Nevertheless our subjection\r\nto Rome galls us. We think the hour has come for us to emancipate\r\nourselves. The other provinces are of the same mind, seeing that they\r\nare rebelling against your emperor. Accordingly, it now pleases us to\r\nbecome free once more, as independent of Rome as we were before the\r\nConquest of Caesar, as we were at the time of Victoria the Great.\r\nAccordingly, ye Roman officials and tax-gatherers, pack yourselves off.\r\nBritanny will henceforth keep her silver and gold to herself, and will\r\ngovern herself without your help. A happy journey to you, and do not\r\ncome back again; if you do, you will find us in arms ready to receive\r\nyou with our swords, and, if need be, our scythes and forks.'\r\n\r\n\"The Romans went, their garrisons along with them. Without troops to\r\nenforce their decrees, the magistrates took their departure, and never\r\nreturned. The Bagaudy in Gaul and the Franks on the Rhine kept their\r\nhands full. This second Bagaudy, like the first, had its good effect, in\r\nour province even better than elsewhere, seeing that the bishops, having\r\njoined the Romans, succeeded in imposing themselves upon the other\r\nprovinces of Gaul, but were prevented by the Bagaudy from making their\r\nweight felt as heavily as in former years. As to ourselves, of Breton\r\nArmorica, Rome never sought to resubjugate us. From that time on, and\r\nobedient to our ancient custom, each tribe chooses its own chief, and\r\nthese choose a chief of chiefs who governs the land. He is kept if he\r\ndoes well, he is removed if he does not give satisfaction. It has\r\ncontinued so to this day, and I hope will ever be, despite the doings of\r\nthe cursed Franks outside of Britanny. The last Breton will have died\r\nbefore our Armorica shall be conquered by the barbarians as they have\r\ndone the rest of Gaul. And now, friend peddler, I understand you to say\r\nthat the Bagaudy is again raising its head, now against the Franks? So\r\nmuch the better! They will, at least, as you say, not enjoy their\r\nconquest in peace, if the new Bagauders are worthy of the old.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are, good old man; they are; I have seen them at work.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bagauders are, then, numerous armed troops?\"\r\n\r\n\"Karadeucq, my pet, do not excite yourself--listen without\r\ninterrupting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad boy, he can only think of battles, revolts and adventures!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the poor woman added in a low voice in Araim's ear:\r\n\r\n\"Was there any occasion for the peddler to mention such matters before\r\nmy son? Alas! I told you so, father, it is an ill wind that blew this\r\nman into our house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think him in league with the Dus and Korrigans, Madalen?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I believe is, father, that a misfortune threatens this house. I\r\nwish this night were over, and it were to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the alarmed mother sighed while the peddler answered Karadeucq, who\r\nhung upon the stranger's words:\r\n\r\n\"The new Bagauders, my brave lad, are what the old ones were. Terrible\r\nto the oppressors, kind to the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the people love them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether they love them! Aëlian and Aman, the two chiefs of the first\r\nBagaudy who were put to death nearly two centuries ago in an old Roman\r\ncastle near Paris, at the confluence of the Seine and the Marne--Aëlian\r\nand Aman are to this day loved by the people as martyrs!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Theirs is a happy fate! To be still loved by the people after two\r\ncenturies! Did you hear that, grandfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did, and so did your mother--see how sad she looks.\"\r\n\r\nBut the \"bad boy,\" as the poor woman called him, already seeming in\r\nthought to be running the Bagaudy, cast inquisitive and ardent looks at\r\nthe peddler, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see the Bagauders? Were there many of them? Had they\r\nalready run any raids against the Franks and bishops? Is it long since\r\nyou saw them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks ago, on my way hither, as I crossed Anjou. One day I missed\r\nmy road in the forest. Night fell upon me. After having walked a long,\r\nlong while, and going astray ever deeper in the woods, I noticed at a\r\ndistance a bright light that issued from a cavern. I ran thither. There\r\nI found about a hundred lusty Bagauders. They were resting around a fire\r\nwith their Bagaudines, because you must know that they are generally\r\naccompanied by determined women. A few nights before, they had made a\r\ndescent upon some Frankish seigneurs, our conquerors, and attacked their\r\n'burgs' as the barbarians term their castles. The Bagauders fought\r\nfuriously and without neither mercy or pity; they pillaged churches and\r\nepiscopal villas, exacted ransom from the bishops, hung from the trees\r\nthe most perverse of the priests who fell into their hands, rifled the\r\ncoffers of the royal tax-collectors, and slew whatever Frank came in\r\ntheir way. But, as fast as they took from the rich, they gave to the\r\npoor. They generously distributed among these the plunder of the rich\r\nprelates and Frankish counts, and set free all the chained slaves whom\r\nthey found. Ah! By Aëlian and Aman, the patrons of the Bagauders, the\r\nlife of those gay and brave fellows is a noble and happy one. Had I not\r\nbeen on my way to Britanny in order to see my old mother once more, I\r\nwould have then and there joined them in running the Bagaudy in Anjou\r\nand the contiguous provinces.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what must one do in order to be admitted into the ranks of those\r\nintrepid people?\"\r\n\r\n\"The first thing to do, my brave lad, is to sacrifice one's skin in\r\nadvance; you have to be robust, agile, courageous; you must love the\r\npoor, swear eternal hatred for the Frankish counts and the bishops;\r\nfeast by day and bagaude by night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where are their haunts?\"\r\n\r\n\"You might as well ask the birds of the air where they perch, the beasts\r\nof the wood where they lie down. Yesterday on the mountain, to-morrow in\r\nthe woods, marching ten leagues during the night, hiding for days in\r\nsuccession in the nearest cave--the Bagauder knows not to-day where he\r\nwill be to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must, then, be a lucky accident that would make one run across\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"A lucky accident for good people, an unlucky one for counts, bishops or\r\ntax-collectors!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it in Anjou that you met that troop of Bagauders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in Anjou--in a forest about eight leagues from Angers, whither I\r\nwas then bound--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you notice my pet Karadeucq? Look at him! See how his eyes sparkle\r\nand his cheeks burn. Truly, if he does not dream of little Korrigans\r\nto-night, he will surely dream of Bagauders. Am I wrong, my lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Grandfather, what I say is that the Bretons and the Bagauders are and\r\nwill be the very last Gauls. Were I not a Breton I would indeed run the\r\nBagaudy against the Franks and the bishops.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is my opinion, my grandson, that you will surely run it to-night\r\nwith your head upon your pillow. I wish you pleasant dreams of the\r\nBagaudy, my pet. Now go to bed, it is late; you are making your mother\r\nfeel unnecessarily uneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOFF TO THE BAGAUDY!\r\n\r\n\r\nI broke off this narrative three days ago.\r\n\r\nI began writing it on the afternoon of the day when the peddler, after\r\nhaving spent the night under our roof, proceeded on his journey. When he\r\nappeared at the hall the next morning the tempest had subsided. After\r\nthe peddler left the house, before he disappeared at the turning of the\r\nroad, and as he waved us a last adieu, I said to Madalen:\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, you silly thing! You poor frightened mother--did the angry\r\ngods punish my pet Karadeucq for having wished to see the Korrigans?\r\nWhere is the misfortune that this stranger was to bring down upon our\r\nhouse? The tempest has blown over, the sky is serene, and the sea is\r\ncalming down and looking as blue again as ever! Why is your mien still\r\npreoccupied? Yesterday, Madalen, you said: 'To-morrow rests with God.'\r\nHere we are at yesterday's to-morrow. What evil has befallen us?\r\nNothing, absolutely nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, good father, my forebodings have proved false. And yet,\r\nI do not feel at ease. I still am sorry that my son spoke the way he did\r\nof the Korrigans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Turn around, here is your Karadeucq with his hunting dog in the leash,\r\nhis pouch on his back, his bow in his hand, his arrows at his side. How\r\nhandsome he is! How handsome! How alert and determined his mien!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, yesterday you said to me that it was two days since we have had\r\nany venison in the house. This is a good day for the purpose. I shall\r\nendeavor to bring down a doe in the forest of Karnak. The chase may take\r\nme long; I am carrying some provisions along--bread, fruits and a bottle\r\nof our wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Karadeucq, you shall not go hunting to-day; I shall not allow it--\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. You might lose your way and fall into some pit in the\r\nforest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, do not feel alarmed; why, I know all the paths and pits in the\r\nforest.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; you shall not go hunting to-day. I forbid you to leave the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good grandfather, intercede for me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Willingly. I delight in eating venison. But you must promise me, my\r\npet, that you will not go on the side of the spring where you may\r\nencounter the Korrigans.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear to you, grandfather!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Madalen, let my skilful archer depart for the chase--he swears to\r\nyou that he will not think of the fairies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it really your wish that he go, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg you; let him go; see how crossed he looks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let it be as you wish--it is against my wish, however!\"\r\n\r\n\"A kiss, mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, bad boy, leave me alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"A kiss, good mother; I beg you--do not deny me a caress--\"\r\n\r\n\"Madalen, see those big tears in his eyes. Would you have the courage to\r\nrefuse him an embrace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kiss me, dear child--I felt sorrier than you. Be gone, but come back\r\nearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"One more kiss, good mother--good-bye--good-bye!\"\r\n\r\nKaradeucq left, wiping his tears. Three or four times he turned around\r\nto look at his mother--he then disappeared behind the trees. The day\r\npassed. My favorite did not return. The chase must have carried him far\r\naway. He will be here in the evening. I started to write this narrative\r\nthat sorrow interrupted. It grew dark. Suddenly someone burst into my\r\nroom. It was my son Jocelyn, closely followed by his wife. He cried.\r\n\r\n\"Father! Father! A great misfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Alas! father. I told you that the Korrigans and the stranger\r\nwould be fatal to my son. Why did I yield to you? Why did I allow him to\r\ndepart this morning? Why did I allow my beloved Karadeucq to go away! It\r\nis done for him! I shall never more see him again! Oh! unhappy woman\r\nthat I am!\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Madalen? What is the matter, Jocelyn? What makes\r\nyou look so pale? Why those tears? What has happened to Karadeucq?\"\r\n\r\n\"Read, father, read this little parchment that Yvon the neat-herd has\r\njust brought me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! A curse! A curse upon that peddler with his Bagaudy! He bewitched\r\nmy son--the Korrigans are the cause of this misfortune--\"\r\n\r\nWhile my son and his wife wrung their arms in desolation I read what my\r\ngrandson had written:\r\n\r\n\"Good father and good mother--when you will read this I, your son\r\nKaradeucq, will be very far away from our house. I have told Yvon the\r\nneat-herd, whom I met this morning in the fields, not to put this\r\nparchment into your hands until night, to the end that I may have twelve\r\nhours the lead, and may thus escape your efforts to overtake me. I am\r\ngoing to run the Bagaudy against the Franks and bishops. The times of\r\nthe Chiefs of the Hundred Valleys, the Sacrovirs and Vindexes are past.\r\nBut I could never remain quiet in a corner of Britanny, the only free\r\nsection of Gaul, without avenging, if but upon one of the sons of\r\nClovis, the slavery of our beloved country. Good father, good mother,\r\nyou have left beside you my elder brother, Kervan, and my sister\r\nRoselyk. Be not angry with me. And you, grandfather, who love me so\r\nmuch, obtain my pardon and keep my dear parents from cursing their\r\nson--Karadeucq.\"\r\n\r\nAlas, all efforts to recover the unhappy boy were futile.\r\n\r\nI started this narrative because the conversation of the peddler\r\nimpressed me deeply. I talked long with the stranger, who for twenty\r\nyears had been traveling over all parts of Gaul and who thus had\r\nexceptional opportunities to observe events. He solved to me the\r\nmystery--how our people, who had known how to emancipate themselves from\r\nthe powerful Roman yoke, fell and remained under the yoke of the Franks,\r\na people whom our own surpass a thousandfold in courage and in numbers.\r\n\r\nI had meant to insert here the stranger's answer. But the departure of\r\nthat unhappy boy who was the joy of my old days, has broken my heart. I\r\nlack the courage to continue this narrative. Later, perhaps, if some\r\ngood news from my pet Karadeucq should revive the hope of seeing him\r\nagain, I shall finish what I meant to say. Alas! Shall I ever hear from\r\nhim? Poor boy! To leave all alone, at the age of seventeen, to run the\r\nBagaudy!\r\n\r\nCan it be true, after all, that the gods punish us for wishing to see\r\nthe malign spirits? Alas! Alas! I now also say, with the poor mother,\r\nwho incessantly runs to the door demented in the hope that she may be\r\nable to see whether her son is coming back:\r\n\r\n\"The gods have punished Karadeucq, my pet, for having wished to see the\r\nKorrigans!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy father Araim died of a broken heart shortly after the departure of my\r\nsecond son. He left me the family archives.\r\n\r\nI write these lines ten years after my father's death, and have never\r\nhad any tidings of my poor son Karadeucq. He probably met his death in\r\nthe adventurous life of a Bagauder.\r\n\r\nBritanny preserves her independence, the Franks dare not attack us. All\r\nthe other provinces of Gaul have remained under the yoke of the bishops\r\nand the sons of Clovis. The latter, it is said, surpass their father in\r\nferocity. Their names are Thierry, Childebert and Clotaire; the fourth,\r\nChlodomir, is said to have died this year.\r\n\r\nHow many years of life are left to me and what events are in store for\r\nme? I know not. But I wish this day to bequeath to you, my eldest child,\r\nKervan, the chronicles of our family. I bequeath them to you five\r\nhundred and twenty-six years after our ancestress Genevieve witnessed\r\nthe death of Jesus of Nazareth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI, Kervan, the son of Jocelyn, who died seven years after he bequeathed\r\nto me our family archives have this to add:\r\n\r\nThe narrative that follows was brought to me here, at my house, near\r\nKarnak, by Ronan, one of the sons of my brother Karadeucq, who left our\r\nhouse to run the Bagaudy, the year after the death of Clovis. These two\r\nnarratives contain the adventures of my brother Karadeucq and of his two\r\nsons Loysik and Ronan. The first portion of the narrative brought to me\r\nby Ronan, and which I here subjoin, entitled \"The Vagres,\" and \"The Burg\r\nof Neroweg,\" was written by Ronan himself in the ardor of youth, and in\r\na style and form that differ greatly from those of the previous\r\nnarratives of our family chronicle; the second, which I have entitled\r\n\"Ghilde,\" I wrote from the word of mouth account that Ronan left with\r\nme, and which I think should not be lost.\r\n\r\nBritanny, still in peace, governs herself by chiefs of her own choice.\r\nThe Franks have not dared to penetrate into our fastnesses. But in the\r\ncourse of my nephew's narrative, our descendants will find the secret of\r\nthat mystery that my grandfather Araim had not the courage to put in\r\nwriting:\r\n\r\n\"How the Gallic people, who had known how to emancipate themselves from\r\nthe powerful Roman yoke, fell and remained under the yoke of the Franks,\r\nwhom they surpass a thousandfold in courage and in numbers.\"\r\n\r\nMay it please the gods that it may not some day be in Britanny as in the\r\nother provinces of Gaul! May it please the gods that our country, the\r\nonly one that to-day remains free, may never fall under the domination\r\nof the Franks and the bishops of Rome. May our druids, both the\r\nChristian and the non-Christian, continue to inspire us with a love for\r\nfreedom and with the virile virtues of our ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE VAGRES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\"WOLVES' HEADS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"'The devil take the Franks! Long live the Vagrery and Old Gaul!'\r\n     Such is the cry of all Vagres. The Franks call us 'Wand'ring Men,'\r\n     'Wolves,' 'Wolves' Heads.' Let us be wolves!\r\n\r\n     \"My father ran the Bagaudy, and I now run the Vagrery, but both to\r\n     the one cry--'The devil take the Franks!' and 'Long Live Gaul!'\r\n\r\n     \"Aëlian and Aman, Bagauders in their days, as we in ours are\r\n     Vagres, in revolt against the Romans, as we against the\r\n     Franks--Aëlian and Aman, put to death two centuries ago in their\r\n     old castle near Paris, they are our prophets. We take communion\r\n     with the wine, the treasures and the wives of the seigneurs, the\r\n     bishops and rich Gauls who made common cause with the Frankish\r\n     counts and dukes to whom King Clovis gave our old Gaul. The Franks\r\n     have pillaged us, they massacred and burned down; so let us do\r\n     likewise--pillage, massacre and burn! And let us live in\r\n     joy--'Wolves,' 'Wolves' Heads' and Wand'ring men!' Vagres that we\r\n     are! Let us live in summer under the green foliage, and in winter\r\n     in caverns warm!\r\n\r\n     \"Death unto oppressors! Freedom to the slave! Let us take from the\r\n     seigneurs! Let us give unto the poor!\r\n\r\n     \"What! A hundred kegs of wine in the master's cellar, and only the\r\n     water of the stream for the wornout slave?\r\n\r\n     \"What! A hundred cloaks in the wardrobe, and only rags for the\r\n     toiling slave?\r\n\r\n     \"Who was it planted the vine? Who harvested the grape and pressed\r\n     it into wine? The slave! Who should drink the wine? The slave!\r\n\r\n     \"Who was it that tended and sheared the sheep and wove the cloth\r\n     and made the cloak? The slave!\r\n\r\n     \"Who should wear the cloak? The slave!\r\n\r\n     \"Up, ye poor and oppressed! Up! Revolt! Here are your good friends\r\n     the Vagres! They approach! Death to the seigneurs and the bishops!\r\n\r\n     \"Six men united are stronger than a hundred divided: Let us unite!\r\n     Each for all, and all for each! 'The devil take the Franks! Long\r\n     live the Vagrery and Old Gaul!'\"\r\n\r\nWho sang this song? Ronan the Vagre. Where did he sing it? On a mountain\r\npath that led to the city of Clermont in Auvergne, that grand and\r\nbeautiful Auvergne, land of magnificent traditions--Bituit, who gave\r\nRoman legions to his pack of hounds for breakfast in the morning; the\r\nChief of the Hundred Valleys! Vindex! and so many other heroes of Gaul,\r\nwere they not all sons of Auvergne? of the beautiful Auvergne, to-day\r\nthe prey of Clotaire, the most odious, the most ferocious of the four\r\nsons of Clovis?\r\n\r\nOther voices answered in chorus to the song of Ronan the Vagre. They had\r\nmet on a mild summer's night; there were about thirty Vagres gathered at\r\nthe spot--gay customers, rough boys, clad in all styles, but armed to\r\nthe teeth, and all carrying in their caps a twig of green oak as the\r\nemblem of their solidarity.\r\n\r\nThey arrive at a place where the roads fork--one road leads to the\r\nright, another to the left. Ronan halts. A voice is heard--the voice of\r\nWolf's-Tooth. What a Titan the man is! He is six feet high, with the\r\nneck of a bull and enormous hands; only the hoop of a barrel could\r\nencircle his waist:\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, you said to us: 'Brothers, arm yourselves!' We armed ourselves.\r\n'Furnish yourselves with torches of straw!' Here are the torches.\r\n'Follow me!' We did. You halt; and we have halted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wolf's-Tooth, I am considering. Now, brothers, answer me. Which is to\r\nbe preferred, the wife of a Frankish count or a bishopess?\"\r\n\r\n\"A bishopess smells of holy water--the bishop blesses; a count's wife\r\nsmells of wine--the count, her husband, drinks himself drunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wolf's-Tooth, it is exactly the contrary: the wily prelate drinks the\r\nwine, and leaves the water to the stupid Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan is right!\"\r\n\r\n\"To the devil with the holy water, and long live wine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, long live the wine of Clermont, with which Luern, the great\r\nAuvergnan chief of former days, used to fill up the ditches wide as\r\nponds, in order to refresh the warriors of his tribe.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would have been a cup worthy of you, Wolf's-Tooth! But, brothers,\r\ndo answer me; to whom shall we give the preference, to a bishopess or to\r\na count's wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the bishopess! To the bishopess!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, to the count's wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, so as to please all, we shall take both--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, Ronan!\"\r\n\r\n\"One of these roads leads to the burg of Count Neroweg, the other to the\r\nepiscopal villa of Bishop Cautin.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must carry off both the bishopess and the countess--we must pillage\r\nboth burg and villa!\"\r\n\r\n\"With which shall we start? Shall we start with the prelate, or shall we\r\nstart with the seigneur? The bishop spends more time over his cup; he\r\nloves to roll the sweet morsels over his tongue, and to taste the wine\r\nleisurely; the seigneur drinks larger quantities; he gulps them down\r\nlike a toper--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan is right!\"\r\n\r\n\"Consequently, at this hour of the night, midnight, the hour of the\r\nVagres, Count Neroweg must be full as a tick, and snoring in his bed;\r\nhis wife or some concubine, lying beside him, must be dreaming with eyes\r\nwide open. Bishop Cautin, on the other hand, will be leaning with both\r\nhis elbows on a table, and face to face with a bowl of old wine and one\r\nof his favorite boon companions, cracking jokes.\"\r\n\r\n\"First to the count; he will be in bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, let us first call on the bishop; he will be found up; there\r\nis more sport in surprising a prelate at his wine than a seigneur at his\r\nsnores.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, Ronan! The bishop first!\"\r\n\r\n\"March! I know the house!\"\r\n\r\nWho was it that said this? A young and handsome Vagre of about\r\ntwenty-five years of age. He went by the name of \"Master of the\r\nHounds.\" There was no more accurate marksman than he with his bow and\r\narrow. His arrow simply traveled as he wished. Once the forester slave\r\nof a Frankish duke, he was caught in an amour with one of the women of\r\nhis seigneur's household, and escaped death by flight. He thereupon ran\r\nthe Vagrery.\r\n\r\n\"I know the episcopal house,\" repeated the daring fellow. \"Feeling it in\r\nmy bones that some day or other we would be holding communion with the\r\nbishop's treasury, like a good master of the hounds, I went one day and\r\ntook observations around his lair. I saw the dear old man there. Never\r\ndid I see a buck with blacker or more fiery eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the house, Master of the Hounds, the house; how is it arranged?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad! The windows are high; the doors heavy; the walls strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Master of the Hounds,\" replied Ronan the Vagre, \"we shall reach the\r\nheart of the bishop's house without crossing either the door, the\r\nwindows or the walls--on the same principle that you reach your\r\nsweetheart's heart without penetrating by her eyes--the night is\r\nfavorable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, to you the treasures--to me the handsome bishopess!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours, Master of the Hounds, be the bishopess; ours, the booty of the\r\nepiscopal villa! Long live the Vagrery!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nBISHOP AND COUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer season Bishop Cautin inhabited a villa situated not far\r\nfrom the city of Clermont, the seat of his episcopacy. Magnificent\r\ngardens, crystalline springs, thick arbors, green lawns, excellent\r\nmeadows, gold harvests, purpled vines, forests well stocked with game,\r\nponds well supplied with fish, excellently equipped stables--such were\r\nthe surroundings of the holy man's palace. Two hundred ecclesiastical\r\nslaves, male and female, cultivated the church's \"vineyard,\" without\r\ncounting the domestic personnel--the cup-bearer, the cook and his\r\nassistants, the butcher, the baker, the superintendent of the bath, the\r\nshoemaker, the tailor, the turner, the carpenter, the mason, the master\r\nof the hounds, besides the washerwomen and the weavers, most of the\r\nlatter young, often handsome female slaves. Every evening one of these\r\ngirls took to Bishop Cautin, who lay softly tucked on a feather bed, a\r\ncup of warm and highly spiced wine. Early in the morning another girl\r\ntook in a cup of creamy milk for the first breakfast of the pious man.\r\nAnd thus lived that good apostle of humility, chastity and poverty!\r\n\r\nAnd who is that portly, handsome and still young woman, who resembles\r\nDiana the huntress? With her bare neck and arms, clad in a simple linen\r\ntunic and her long black hair half undone, she leans on her elbows over\r\nthe balcony that crowns the terrace of the villa. At once burning and\r\nlanguishing, the eyes of this woman now rise towards the starry sky, now\r\nseem to peer through this mild summer's night, under shelter of which,\r\nwith the stealthy step of wolves, the Vagres are wending their way\r\ntowards the bishop's residence. The woman is Fulvia, Cautin's bishopess,\r\nwhom he married when, still a simple friar, he did not yet aspire to a\r\nbishopric. After he was promoted to the higher office that he now fills\r\nin the hierarchy, he piously calls her \"my sister,\" agreeable to the\r\ncanons of the councils.\r\n\r\n\"Woe is me!\" the bishopess was saying. \"Woe to these summer nights\r\nduring which one is left alone to inhale the perfume of the flowers, to\r\nlisten to the murmur of the nocturnal breezes in the foliage of the\r\ntrees, murmurs that so much resemble the stolen kisses of lovers! Oh! I\r\nalways fear the unnerving heat of these summer nights! It penetrates\r\nthrough my whole frame! I am twenty-eight years of age. I am now twelve\r\nyears, married, and I have counted these conjugal years with my tears! A\r\nrecluse in the city, a recluse in the country by the orders of my lord\r\nand master, my husband, Bishop Cautin, who spends his time in the\r\nwomen's part of the house among my female slaves, whom the profligate\r\ndebauches while pleading the canons of the councils that, he says, order\r\nhim to live chastely with his wife--such is my life--my sad life! My\r\nyouth is ebbing away without my enjoying a single day of love or of\r\nfreedom. Love! Freedom! Shall I grow old without knowing you? Woe is\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the handsome bishopess rose, shook her black hair to the night\r\nbreeze, puckered her black eyebrows and cried defiantly:\r\n\r\n\"Woe to violent and debauched husbands! They hurl women into perdition!\r\nLoved, respected, treated, if not as wife, at least truly as his sister\r\nby the bishop, I would have remained chaste and gentle. But disdained\r\nand humiliated before the lowest of the domestic slaves, I have grown to\r\nbe wrathful and vindictive. From the height of this terrace, and often\r\nmy cheeks mantling with shame, I follow with distracted gaze the young\r\nslaves of the field when they go out to work in the morning and return\r\nin the evening. I have struck my husband's concubines with my\r\nhands--and yet, poor wretches that they are, they do not yield to the\r\nlover who begs, but to the master who orders. I struck them in anger,\r\nnot in jealousy. Before that man became odious to me, I was indifferent\r\nto him. Nevertheless, I might have loved him, had he wished it--and as\r\nhe willed. 'Sister-wife' of a bishop--it looked attractive! How much\r\ngood could not be done! How many tears could not be dried! But I have\r\nhad only my own to dry, soon finding myself degraded and despised. The\r\nmeasure overflows; I have wept enough; I have moaned enough; I have\r\nsufficiently resisted the temptations that devour me! I shall flee from\r\nthis house, even at the risk of being captured and sold as a slave! Can\r\nit be called to live, this dragging of my days in this opulent villa, a\r\ngilded grave? No! No! I wish to leave this sepulchre! I wish to breathe\r\nthe free air! I wish to see the sun! I wish to move free in space! I\r\ncrave a single day of love and freedom! Oh! If I could only see again\r\nthe young lad, who more than once went by this terrace early in the\r\nmorning! What warm and loving glances he shot at me! What a beautiful\r\nand fearless face looked from under his red headcover! What a robust and\r\ngraceful build did not his Gallic blouse reveal with the belt of his\r\nhunting knife! He must be some forester slave of the neighborhood! A\r\nslave! What does it matter! He is young, handsome, nimble and amorous!\r\nMy husband's concubines also are slaves! Oh! Shall I never enjoy a day\r\nof love, of freedom?\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, what is the bishop doing while his bishopess, lost in\r\nrevery on the balcony over the terrace, contemplates the stars, sighs\r\ninto the darkness, and breathes her sorrows and her devilish hopes upon\r\nthe midnight breezes? The holy man is drinking and conferring with Count\r\nNeroweg, who happens on this night to be his guest. The banquet hall in\r\nwhich they are seated is built after the Roman fashion. It is a spacious\r\nroom, ornamented with marble pillars, and decked with gilded work and\r\nfresco paintings. Gold and silver vases are ranged on ivory sideboards.\r\nThe floor is slabbed with rich mosaics that are pleasing to the eye. But\r\nstill more pleasing to the eye is the large table loaded with drinking\r\ncups and half-emptied amphoras. The leudes, Neroweg's companions in arms\r\nand his equals in time of peace, have gone to play at dice with the\r\nbishop's clerks and familiars in the vestibule, after having partaken of\r\nsupper at the same table with the count, as is the custom. Here and\r\nthere along the walls the rough weapons of the leudes are stacked\r\nup--wooden bucklers, iron-rimmed staves, 'francisques' or double-edged\r\naxes, 'haugons' or demi-pikes furnished with iron grappling hooks. The\r\ncount's buckler is illumined with a painting that represents three\r\neagle's talons. Left alone at table with his guest, the prelate induces\r\nNeroweg to drain cup after cup. At the lower end of the table sits a\r\nhermit laborer. He drinks not, neither does he speak. At times he seems\r\nto listen to the conversation of the two topers. Oftener, however, he is\r\nsteeped in thought.\r\n\r\nThe Frank, Count Neroweg, has the appearance and emits the odor of a\r\nwild-boar in spring; his face resembles a bird of prey, with his beaked\r\nnose and restless little eyes that alternately assume a savage and then\r\na sleepy look; his coarse yellow hair, tied over his head with a leather\r\nthong, falls back over his neck like a mane; the coiffure of these\r\nbarbarians remained unchanged during the last two centuries. Neroweg's\r\nchin and cheeks are closely shaven, but his long reddish moustache\r\ndroops down to his chest, which is covered by a doe-skin jacket, shines\r\nwith grease, and is dotted with wine spots. Long leathern straps\r\ncriss-cross over his lower hose from his coarse iron-spiked shoes up to\r\nhis knees. He has removed his heavy sword from his broad and loosely\r\nhanging baldric and laid it upon a seat nearby, beside a stout holly\r\nclub. Such is the convivial guest of the prelate, such is Count Neroweg,\r\none of these new masters of the old lands of Gaul.\r\n\r\nBishop Cautin resembles a large, fat, ruttish fox--lascivious and sly\r\neyes, red ears, a mobile and pointed nose, hirsute hands. He prinks in\r\nhis violet robe of fine woven silk. And what a paunch! One would say\r\nthere was a barrel under the gown.\r\n\r\nAs to the hermit-laborer--all respect for that priest, a worthy disciple\r\nof the young man of Nazareth! He is thirty years of age at the most. His\r\nface is pale, and it is at once mild and firm; his beard is blonde, his\r\nhead is prematurely bald; his long brown robe, made of some coarse\r\nmaterial, is here and there frayed by the brambles on the lands that his\r\ntoil has cleared. The man's bearing is rustic, his hands are strong, the\r\nplow and the hoe-handle have made them horny.\r\n\r\nThe bishop again fills another large cup to the Frank, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Count--I repeat it--the twenty gold sous, the meadow lands and the\r\nlittle blonde female slave--either I must have them, or you get no\r\nabsolution!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop! I shall fall upon your house with all my leudes and sack it; I\r\nshall roast you over a slow fire--and you will give me absolution--\"\r\n\r\n\"Impious man! Sacrilegious blasphemer! Pharaoh! Hog of profligacy!\r\nReservoir of wine! How dare you hold such language to your bishop! And\r\nyou a son of our apostolic Church!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall give me absolution, will ye, nill ye!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! The beast! Is it that you are itching to fall into the very bottom\r\nof hell? Is it that you are itching to remain for centuries in\r\nsuccession broiling in pails full of burning pitch! You seem to be\r\nitching after a thorough trouncing with the forks of the devils! Devils\r\nwith toads' heads, rams' horns, serpents for their tails, elephants'\r\ntrunks for arms, and cloven hoofs--aye archcloven!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see them?\" queried the Frank with a savage and yet frightened\r\nmien. \"Did you, bishop? Did you see those demons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether I saw them! They brought before me in a cloud of bitumen and\r\nsulphur Duke Rauking, who, the sacrilegious wretch! struck Bishop Basile\r\nwith his cane!\"\r\n\r\n\"And did the devils carry off Duke Rauking?\"\r\n\r\n\"They threw him into the bottomless pit! I counted them; there were\r\nthirteen of them; a large red devil, that was Lucifer, led them. Such a\r\nfate is in store for you, if I refuse you absolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop, you may be saying all that only to frighten me out of my twenty\r\ngold sous, the fine meadow lands, and the pretty blonde slave!\"\r\n\r\nThe prelate rang a bell; one of his confidential servants stepped in;\r\nthe holy man said to him a few words in Latin while with his eyes he\r\nindicated a spot on the mosaic floor. The servant went out again. The\r\nhermit-laborer thereupon addressed the bishop, also in Latin:\r\n\r\n\"What you propose to do is an unworthy trick! It is a sacrilegious\r\nfraud!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hermit, is not everything allowed to the clergy of our holy Church in\r\norder to terrify these brutes of Franks into subjection?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fraud never is allowed--\"\r\n\r\nCautin shrugged his shoulders, and addressing the count in the Frankish\r\ntongue--the prelate spoke the language like any of the barbarians--he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Are you a Christian and a Catholic? Did you receive holy baptism?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop Macaire, twenty years ago, ordered me to step naked into the\r\nstone tank of his basilica; he then threw a handful of water upon my\r\nhead and mumbled some Latin words.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a Catholic--a son of our holy Church--by reason of which you\r\nmust respect and obey me as your father in Christ!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop, you are trying to confuse me by such language, but I will not\r\nbe duped by you. Our great King Clovis conquered and subjugated Gaul at\r\nthe head of his brave leudes. My father Gonthram Neroweg was one of his\r\nwarriors, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie, count! It is to the bishops that your King owed his conquest;\r\nit was they who ordered the people to submit to Clovis; without them,\r\nyour great King would have remained only a chief of brigands. Never\r\nforget that, barbarian! You may now proceed with what you had to say,\r\nand speak respectfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"When Theodorik lived, the son of Clovis who had Auvergne as one of his\r\nkingdoms, he allotted to me vast domains in this region--lands, people,\r\ncattle and houses, and he sent me here as his representative. He made me\r\nwhat is called 'graf' of this country, and what we Franks call 'count';\r\nand he authorized me to preside together with the chief bishop of the\r\ncity and the magistrates of the city of Clermont.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you driving at with that long digression?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to prove, first of all, that King Clovis committed many more\r\ncrimes than I did, and that his crimes did not prevent him from entering\r\nparadise, as the bishops themselves declare.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough, brute that you are! But you seem to forget what that\r\nparadise cost him. St. Remi, who baptized him, was so richly endowed by\r\nhim that the holy prelate was able to buy an estate in Champagne that\r\ncost him five thousand pounds of silver by weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I then meant to say that if you are bishop, I am count of the conquered\r\ncountry, and I can force you to give me absolution!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! You blaspheme!\" and the bishop struck under the table with his\r\nfoot. \"Ah! You dare to defy the anger of the Lord! You--soiled with\r\nexecrable crimes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! Yes! Is it perchance an unpardonable crime to kill a brother? I\r\nconfess that I murdered my brother Ursio! Give me absolution!\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to forget the murder of your concubine Isanie, and of your\r\nfourth wife Wisigarde, whom you married when two previous ones were\r\nstill alive, and you then took a fifth wife, Godegisele--\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you not give me absolution for all those sins? By the faith of\r\nthe Terrible Eagle, my glorious ancestor! It cost me five hundred acres\r\nof the best stretches of my forest, thirty-eight gold sous, twenty\r\nslaves, together with the superb cloak of Northern marten skin in which\r\nyou strutted about last winter, and which King Clovis presented to my\r\nfather!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been absolved of those first crimes--as to them you are as\r\nwhite as the pascal lamb, but for the fresh crime of your brother's\r\nmurder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not kill Ursio out of hatred, I only killed him for his part of\r\nour inheritance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what else should you have killed your brother for, beast? To eat\r\nhim up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not the great Clovis also kill all his relatives for their\r\nheritage, and yet you declare that he entered paradise. I also wish to\r\ngo there, and I have killed fewer people. If you do not promise paradise\r\nto me on the spot and without any further payments, if you refuse to\r\ngive me absolution, I shall have you torn into pieces by four horses, or\r\nhacked to pieces by my leudes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I tell you that if you do not expiate your fratricide by a gift to\r\nthe Church, you shall go to hell, like a new Cain who killed his\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you are after is my hundred acres of meadow land, my twenty gold\r\nsous, and my pretty little blonde slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I am after is the salvation of your soul, unhappy man! What I aim\r\nat is to save you the torments of hell, the very thought of which should\r\nmake you shudder with terror.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are always talking of hell. Where is hell?\"\r\n\r\nBishop Cautin again struck the floor with his feet under the table.\r\n\r\n\"Count, do you smell that odor of sulphur?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do feel a pungent odor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you see the smoke that is coming up from between those stone slabs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whence does that smoke proceed?\" cried Neroweg affrighted, rising from\r\nthe table and jumping back from a near place where a thick black vapor\r\nwas curling upward. \"Bishop, what magic is this? Come to my help!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lord God! You have heard the voice of your unworthy servant!\" said\r\nCautin clasping his hands and falling upon his knees. \"You wish to\r\nmanifest yourself to this barbarian!\" And turning his head toward\r\nNeroweg: \"You asked where hell was? Look at your feet--see the\r\nabyss--see that sea of flames, all ready to engulf you!\"\r\n\r\nAs the bishop spoke, one of the mosaic slabs sank below the floor, drawn\r\ndown by an artful contrivance of ropes and weights; a large gap was thus\r\nleft open, and out of it a whirl of flames leaped up, spreading a\r\nsuffocating odor of sulphur.\r\n\r\n\"The earth is opening!\" cried the terrorized Frank. \"Fire! Fire! My feet\r\nburn! Help! Help!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the everlasting fire,\" said the bishop rising and striking a\r\nthreatening attitude, while the count, dropping on both his knees, hid\r\nhis face in his hands. \"Ah! You asked me where hell was, impious,\r\nblaspheming brute!\"\r\n\r\n\"Father! Good father--have pity upon me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear those underground cries? It is the devils; they are coming\r\nfor you. Listen! Do you hear them cry: 'Neroweg! Neroweg! The\r\nfratricide! Come to us! Cain, you are ours!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Those cries are frightful. Good father in Christ, pray to the Lord\r\nthat he forgive me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Now you are on your knees, pale and distracted, with hands clasped,\r\nyour eyes closed with terror! Will you still ask where is hell?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! No! Holy bishop! Holy Bishop Cautin! Absolve me of the death of my\r\nbrother; you shall have the meadow lands, the twenty gold pieces--\"\r\n\r\n\"And the pretty blonde slave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! You want my pretty blonde slave also?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a donation deed ready made out. You shall order one of your\r\nleudes to come in and sign the parchment as your witness--yonder hermit\r\nshall be my witness, and you will sign the document in their presence.\r\nThe donation will then be in order and binding.\"\r\n\r\n\"I consent to everything--have pity upon me. Order the devils back.\r\nOrder them back! Oh! good father, order them away! Keep them from\r\ndragging me to hell!\"\r\n\r\n\"They will certainly drag you thither if you fail in your promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall keep all my promises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seeing that you are no longer in doubt of the power of the Lord,\" the\r\nbishop proceeded to say while he again stamped on the floor with his\r\nfoot, \"you may rise, count, open your eyes, the abyss of hell is closed\r\nagain\"; the slab had in the meantime been raised and adjusted in its\r\nformer place. \"Hermit, bring the parchment to me and writing materials.\r\nYou shall be my witness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I decline, seigneur bishop, to aid in the accomplishment of such a\r\nsacrilegious knavery,\" the hermit-laborer answered in Latin, \"but if I\r\nreveal your trick to that barbarian he will put you to death! I shall\r\nnot be the means of your death. God will one day judge you! In the\r\nmeantime I shall raise my voice against your unworthy comedies.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Would you be capable of abusing your influence over the masses in\r\norder to incite them to a rebellion in my diocese? Is it a declaration\r\nof war that you make to me? Do you not know that the officers of the\r\nChurch must stand by one another? Or is it some favor that you mean to\r\ndraw from me through intimidation? Answer!\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, before proceeding upon my journey, I shall tell you what I\r\ndemand of you--\"\r\n\r\nCautin, who stood in awe of the hermit, rang a bell while the count, who\r\nremained upon his knees, still trembled at every limb, and mopped the\r\ncold sweat that inundated his forehead. At the bishop's call, the\r\nconfidential servant appeared. The holy man said to him in Latin:\r\n\r\n\"The hell was very satisfactory. Have the fires put out!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he added in the Frankish tongue:\r\n\r\n\"Order one of the count's leudes, one who can write, to step in. You\r\nshall come back with him; I shall need your services.\"\r\n\r\nThe servant left, and the bishop addressed the kneeling Frank:\r\n\r\n\"You have believed, you repent--you may now rise!\"\r\n\r\n\"My good father, I am afraid of returning to my burg to-night. The\r\ndevils might come for me on the road and take me to hell. I am\r\nterror-stricken. Keep me in your house to-night!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall be my guest until to-morrow. But I want the pretty blonde\r\nslave to be delivered to me this very evening. I promised her to my\r\nbishopess, who was once my wife according to the flesh, and is to-day my\r\nsister in God. She needs a young girl for her service--and I promised\r\nher that one. The sooner she has her, all the better pleased will she\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so, bishop,\" said the count scratching himself behind his ear, \"you\r\nmust have that blonde slave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you dare to break your engagement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! No, father! One of my leudes shall take horse, ride to my burg,\r\nand bring the slave to you on the crupper.\"\r\n\r\nThe deed of the donation was signed and duly witnessed by the bishop's\r\nservant and one of the count's leudes. It provided that Neroweg, count\r\nof the King of Auvergne and the city of Clermont, donated to the Church,\r\nrepresented by Cautin, and in remission of his sins, a hundred acres of\r\nmeadow land, twenty gold sous, and a spinner female slave, fifteen years\r\nold, named Odille. After the ceremony of signing was concluded the\r\nbishop gave the Frankish count absolution for the murder of his brother\r\nand offered him three full cups of wine to comfort him.\r\n\r\n\"Sigefrid,\" said the count to his leude, smothering a last sigh of\r\nregret, \"be a good friend to me; ride to my burg; take Odille the\r\nspinner girl on the crupper of your horse and bring her here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAT THE CHAPEL OF ST. LOUP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vagres arrived near the episcopal villa.\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, the gates are solid, the windows high, the walls thick--how\r\nshall we penetrate into the place and reach the bishop?\" asked the\r\nMaster of the Hounds. \"You promised to lead us to the very heart of the\r\nhouse. As for me, I'm off to the heart of the bishopess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, do you see yonder, at the foot of the hill, that little\r\nstructure surrounded by pillars?\"\r\n\r\n\"We see it--the night is clear!\"\r\n\r\n\"That building was formerly a warm water bath. The warm spring lay in\r\nthe mountain. The bath is reached from the villa by a long underground\r\ngallery. The bishop had the stream turned away, and transformed the\r\nformer bath into a chapel that he consecrated to St. Loup. Now, then, my\r\nsturdy Vagres, we will penetrate to the very heart of the episcopal\r\nvilla by that underground gallery, without need of boring holes through\r\nwalls or breaking doors or windows. If I promised, did I keep?\"\r\n\r\n\"As always, Ronan! You promised and kept!\"\r\n\r\nThe troop entered the former warm water bath, now chapel of St. Loup. It\r\nwas dark as a pocket. A voice was heard saying:\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Ronan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I and mine. Lead, Simon, you good servant of the episcopal villa! Lead\r\non, we follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why delay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Count Neroweg is still with the bishop, with his leudes.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better! We shall capture a fox and a wild-boar at once! A\r\nsuperb hunt!\"\r\n\r\n\"The count has with him twenty-four well armed leudes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are thirty! That is fifteen Vagres more than enough for such a raid.\r\nLead on, Simon, we follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"The passage is not yet free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is not the passage free that leads underground into the banquet\r\nhall?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bishop prepared a miracle for this evening, in order to frighten\r\nthe Frankish count with hell. Two clerks carried into the apartment\r\nunder the banquet hall large bales of hay, bundles of fagots and boxes\r\nof sulphur. They are to set them on fire and yell like devils possessed;\r\nthen one of the mosaic slabs of the flooring in the hall will sink down;\r\nit drops by means of the same contrivance that used to remove it in\r\norder to descend to this gallery for the warm baths.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the stupid Frank, imagining he sees one of the mouths of hell\r\nyawning wide, will make some generous donation to the holy man--\"\r\n\r\n\"You guessed it, Ronan. So, then, we shall have to wait until the\r\nmiracle is over. When the count is gone and the villa slumbering you and\r\nyour men can come in safely.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bishopess for me!\"\r\n\r\n\"To us the iron money-chest, the gold and silver vases! To us the\r\nbishop's full money-bags--and then we shall scatter alms among the poor\r\nwho have not a denier!\"\r\n\r\n\"To us,\" cried another set, \"the full wine pouches and bags of grain--to\r\nus the hams and smoked meats! Alms, alms to the poor who hunger!\"\r\n\r\n\"To all of us the wardrobes, the fine clothes, the warm robes--and then\r\nalms, alms to the poor who suffer with cold!\"\r\n\r\n\"And then, fire to the episcopal villa--and to the sack!\"\r\n\r\n\"Freedom to the slaves!\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall take with us the young girls, who will follow us gladly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live love and the Vagrery!\" cried Ronan, saying which he struck up\r\nthe song:\r\n\r\n     \"My father was a Bagauder, and I a Vagre am; born under the green\r\n     foliage as any bird in May.\r\n\r\n     \"Where is my mother? I do not know, forsooth!\r\n\r\n     \"A Vagre has no wife.\r\n\r\n     \"The poniard in one hand, the torch held in the other, he moves\r\n     from burg to burg and villas kept by bishops; he carries off the\r\n     wives or concubines of bishops and of counts, and takes the belles\r\n     along into the thickest of the woods!\r\n\r\n     \"And first they weep and then they laugh. The jolly Vagre knows the\r\n     art of love. In his strong arms the loving belles forget full soon\r\n     the cacochymic bishop or the brutified duke!\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live the Vagre's love!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are in rollicking mood--\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, Simon, we are about to put a bishop's house to the sack!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be hanged, burned, quartered!\"\r\n\r\n\"No more nor less so than Aman and Aëlian, our prophets, Bagauders in\r\ntheir days as we are Vagres in ours. For all that, the poor say: 'Good\r\nAëlian!' 'Good Aman!' May they some day say: 'Good Ronan!' I would die\r\nhappy, Simon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Always living in the recesses of the woods--\"\r\n\r\n\"Verdure is so cheerful!\"\r\n\r\n\"At the bottom of caverns--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is warm there in winter, cool in summer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Always on the alert; always on the run over hill and valley; always\r\nwandering without hearth or home--\"\r\n\r\n\"But always living free, old Simon. Yes, free! free! instead of leading\r\na slave's life under the whip of some Frankish master or some bishop!\r\nJoin us, Simon!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am too old for that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not hate your master, Bishop Cautin, and the whole seigniory?\"\r\n\r\n\"One time I was young, rich and happy. The Franks invaded Touraine, my\r\nnative country. They slew my wife after violating her; they dashed my\r\nlittle girl's head against the wall; they pillaged my house; they sold\r\nme into slavery, and from master to master, I have finally fallen into\r\nthe hands of Bishop Cautin. So you see, I have every reason to execrate\r\nthe Franks; but worse than them, if possible, I execrate the Gallic\r\nbishops, who hold us Gauls in bondage, and sanctify the crime of our\r\nforeign oppressors. I would hang them all if I could!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who goes there?\" cried Ronan noticing a human form on the outside,\r\ncreeping on its knees and approaching the door of the chapel in that\r\nposture. \"Who goes there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, Felibien, ecclesiastical slave of our holy bishop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor man! Why do you crawl on your knees in that style?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in obedience to a vow that I took. I come on my knees--over the\r\nstones of the road--to pray to St. Loup, the great St. Loup, to whom\r\nthis chapel is dedicated. I come at night so that I may be back at dawn\r\nwhen I must start to work. My hut is far from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why do you inflict such a punishment upon yourself, brother? Is it\r\nnot hard enough to have to rise with the sun, and to lie down upon straw\r\nat night worn out with fatigue?\"\r\n\r\n\"I come upon my knees to pray St. Loup, the great St. Loup, to request\r\nthe Lord to grant a long and happy life to our seigneur, the bishop.\"\r\n\r\n\"To pray for a long and happy life for your master is to pray for a\r\nlengthening of the whip of the superintendents who flay your back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blessed be their blows! The more we suffer here below, all the happier\r\nwill we be in paradise!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the wheat that you sow is eaten by your bishop; the wine that you\r\npress is drunk by him; the cloth that you weave, clothes him--and you\r\nremain wan, hungry, in rags!\"\r\n\r\n\"I would be willing to feed on the offal of swine, clothe myself in\r\nthorns that tear my skin to the veins--my happiness will be all the\r\ngreater in paradise!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord created the grain, the grapes, the honey, the fruits, the\r\ncreamy milk, the soft fleece of the sheep--was all that done in order\r\nthat any of His creatures should live on ordure and dress in thorns?\r\nAnswer me, my poor brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are an impious fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Almost all the slaves are, like this unhappy fellow, steeped in\r\nthe abjectest besotment--the evil spreads by the day--it is done for old\r\nGaul--\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, let us sing the refrain of the Vagres:\r\n\r\n     \"The Franks call us 'Wand'ring Men,' 'Wolves,' 'Wolves' Heads'--Let\r\n     us live like wolves! Let us live in joy! In summer under the green\r\n     foliage, in winter in caverns warm!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Simon, the bishop's miracle must be over by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I shall precede you alone, a little way in this underground\r\npassage; should I see light I shall return and notify you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about that slave, who is mumbling his prayers on his knees to\r\nthe great St. Loup?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lightning might strike at his very feet and he would not budge from the\r\nspot--he will go back as he came, on his knees. Follow me!\"\r\n\r\nAnd led by the ecclesiastical slave, the Vagres vanished in the\r\nsubterranean passage which led from the former warm baths into the\r\nepiscopal villa. As they proceeded in the dark, they sang in an\r\nundertone:\r\n\r\n     \"The jolly Vagre has no wife. The poniard in one hand, the torch\r\n     held in the other, he moves from burg to burg and villas kept by\r\n     bishops; he carries off the wives and concubines of bishops and of\r\n     counts, and takes the belles along into the thickest of the woods!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE DEMONS! THE DEMONS!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat were the prelate and the count engaged in while the Vagres were\r\napproaching the ecclesiastical villa through the underground gallery?\r\nWhat were they engaged in? They were emptying cup upon cup. The count's\r\nleude had returned to the burg in quest of the pretty blonde slave girl.\r\nWhile waiting for him, Bishop Cautin, hardly able to contain himself for\r\nthe joy that he anticipated in the possession of the girl whom he\r\ncoveted, had returned to his seat at the table. Neroweg had not yet\r\nrecovered from his recent fright; ever and anon a shiver would run over\r\nhim. Every time it occurred to him that hell had just yawned at his very\r\nfeet and might be located under the very room in which he found himself,\r\nhe would gladly have left the banquet hall. He dared not. He believed\r\nhimself protected by the holy presence of the bishop against the attacks\r\nof the devils, who might elsewhere fall upon him. In vain did the man of\r\nGod urge his guest to drain another cup; the count pushed the cup back\r\nwith his hand while his gimlet eyes, resembling the eyes of a frightened\r\nbird of prey, rolled uneasily over the hall.\r\n\r\nImpassible in his seat, the hermit laborer remained sunk in meditation,\r\nor observed what took place around him.\r\n\r\n\"What ails you?\" the bishop asked the count. \"You look downcast and\r\ndrink no more! A minute ago you were a fratricide, and now, thanks to\r\nthe absolution that I gave you, you are white as snow. Is your\r\nconscience still uneasy? Can it be that you hid some other crime from\r\nme? If you did, you chose your time ill--as you saw, hell is not far\r\naway--\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep still, father! Keep still! I feel so weak just now that I could\r\nnot carry a lamb on my back--I who can otherwise raise a wild-boar. Do\r\nnot leave your son in Christ alone! You are able to conjure the demons\r\naway--I shall not leave you till it is broad day--\"\r\n\r\n\"You will nevertheless have to leave me the moment the pretty blonde\r\nslave arrives; I must take her to the women's section of the house near\r\nFulvia.\"\r\n\r\n\"As truly as one of my ancestors was called the Terrible Eagle in\r\nGermany, I shall not quit you any more than your shadow.\"\r\n\r\n\"An ancestor of that Neroweg was called the Terrible Eagle in\r\nGermany--the meeting is odd,\" thought the hermit to himself. \"It does\r\nseem that our two hostile families, the one Frank the other Gaul, having\r\ncrossed each other's path in the past, must cross it again--and are to\r\nrecross it, perhaps, again and again through the centuries to come--\"\r\n\r\n\"Count, your terror proves to me that your soul is not at ease--I\r\nmistrust that your confession was not complete.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; I confessed everything!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope to God it be so, for the salvation of your soul. But cheer up!\r\nLet us talk of the hunt. Oh! By the way of the hunt, I have a complaint\r\nagainst you and your forester slaves. The other day they pursued three\r\nstags into the very heart of the Church's forest--in that part of the\r\nwood that is separated from the rest of your domains by the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"If my forester slaves pursued any stag into your forest, I shall allow\r\nyours to pursue one into mine; our woods are separated only by a narrow\r\nroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"A better boundary would be the river itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case I would have to abandon to you fully a thousand acres of\r\nwoodland, which lie on this side of the stream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you place much store by that little corner of your forest? The trees\r\ndo not thrive very well at that spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not as poorly as you would make out. There are among them oak trees\r\nmore than twenty feet around; besides, it is that portion of my domains\r\nthat game seems to like best.\"\r\n\r\n\"You boast of the beauty of your trees; it is your right; but your\r\ndomains would have a better and safer boundary if you took the river,\r\nand if you consented to yield to the Church that corner of a thousand\r\nacres.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you speak of my woods? I have no need of any further\r\nabsolution from you--\"\r\n\r\n\"No--you killed one of your wives, one of your concubines and your\r\nbrother Ursio--you have expiated those crimes by endowing the\r\nChurch--you have received absolution. Nevertheless, coming to think of\r\nit, there is one thing that both of us have overlooked--and it is of\r\ncapital importance--\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your fourth wife, Wisigarde, died a violent death at your hands. She\r\ndid not receive priestly assistance at her death--her soul is in pain.\r\nShe might come to torment you during the night in the shape of some\r\nfrightful phantom until you will have drawn her poor soul from\r\npurgatory--\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Through the holy mass and through the prayers of a priest of the Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, father, I wish you to make those prayers for the soul of the\r\ndeparted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall grant your request. For twenty years prayers shall be recited\r\nat the altar for the repose of the soul of Wisigarde, but only under\r\ncondition that you pass over to me the corner of your woods that is\r\nseparated from your domains by the stream--\"\r\n\r\n\"Give again to your Church! Ever give! Ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you prefer to be tormented by nocturnal phantoms?\"\r\n\r\nThe Frank looked at the bishop with an angry and defiant eye:\r\n\r\n\"Rapacious Gaul! You are seeking to pluck piece by piece from me the\r\nshare of the conquests that our kings have presented to my family as our\r\nhereditary possessions. Endow the Church still more! I will sooner endow\r\nthe devil! Yes, by all the horns of Lucifer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do! Endow him! Here he is!\" came from a rude loud voice that seemed to\r\nissue from the center of the earth.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the voice the hermit started from his seat; the bishop\r\nthrew himself back and quickly crossed himself, but a reassuring thought\r\nflashed through his mind, and he said to himself aloud in Latin:\r\n\r\n\"It must be my good assistant who remained below--the trick is good!\"\r\n\r\nThe count, however, struck with terror and believing himself pursued by\r\nthe archfiend in person, screamed aloud and fled from the banquet hall\r\ndistracted. So precipitate was his flight and headlong his bewilderment\r\nthat he nearly upset the leude who, back at that moment from his errand\r\nto the count's burg, entered the hall pushing before him the young\r\nblonde slave whom he was sent in quest of:\r\n\r\n\"Here is the slave girl, Odille,\" said the leude.\r\n\r\nThe bishop started to run towards the poor lass, but at the very moment\r\nwhen he dashed forward to seize her, a vigorous hand that rose from the\r\nopening of the now again removed mosaic slab held the prelate back by\r\nthe fold of his robe, and a voice shouted:\r\n\r\n\"A profligate you shall no longer be, holy man of God! That pretty lass\r\nis not for you!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the startled bishop looked around, he saw with terror Ronan issuing\r\nfrom the underground recess at the head of his companions, all of whom\r\nwere yelling at the top of their voices. In order to carry on the humor\r\nof the trick that the bishop played upon the count, the Vagres had all\r\nblackened their faces with the charred remains of the fagots that\r\nshortly before furnished the \"flames of hell.\"\r\n\r\nAt the sight of those black men rising from under the ground, and\r\nyelling as if possessed, the leude who brought in the young slave also\r\nbelieved that they issued from hell, and rushed out close upon Neroweg's\r\nheels, crying:\r\n\r\n\"The demons! The demons!\"\r\n\r\nMore and more frightened by these cries, the count ran to the stable,\r\nleaped upon his horse, and dashed full tilt away from the episcopal\r\nvilla. His leudes followed his example; they, in turn, took to their\r\nmounts, and leaving their arms behind in the banquet hall, fled\r\ntumultuously, repeating in terror:\r\n\r\n\"The demons! The demons!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nVAGRES IN JUDGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe episcopal villa has been invaded by the Vagres. They carried the\r\nplace, and they did so without striking a blow.\r\n\r\nWho is he who is celebrating night mass in the bishop's chapel? The wax\r\ncandles are lighted on the altar with all the gorgeousness of an Easter\r\nSunday. Their brilliant light illumines the near vault, while the rest\r\nof the chapel is thrown into the shade, down to the Gothic main\r\nentrance, that now and then a ruddy gleam flickers through like the\r\nreflection of an extinguishing bonfire. What bonfire was that? It was\r\nthe bonfire of the episcopal villa in flames.\r\n\r\nWas, then, the villa set on fire by the Vagres? Certes; for what other\r\nreason should they have brought along torches and straw?\r\n\r\nIn the center of the yard the riches of the bishop lie in a high\r\nheap--gold and silver vases, holy chalices, together with drinking\r\ngoblets, Bible cases of precious wood, together with platters of the\r\nbanquet table, patines, together with bowls used for cooling the\r\nbishop's wine; good sized and ripped-up bags, from which silver and gold\r\nsous roll out; costly cloth, purple and blue, that but awaited the\r\ntailor's scissors; warm and rare furs, some black as crows, others white\r\nas doves. In the way of trophies, the axes, bucklers and pikes of the\r\nleudes, who ran away out of fear for the devil, are stacked up at the\r\nfour corners of the superb heap of booty. Gold, silver, steel, the\r\nbrilliant colors of the cloths--they all scintillate and sparkle, each\r\nwith its own lustre, and all with the resplendence that is so pleasing\r\nto the eye of the Vagre.\r\n\r\nThe Vagres are there! They are in the holy chapel of the episcopal\r\nvilla, where they do that which all Vagres do after they have drunk\r\ntheir fill, ravaged and pillaged. Some are snoring at the foot of the\r\naltar exhausted by their labors or overcome by the fumes of wine; others\r\nbalance themselves on their unsteady limbs and cast loving glances at\r\nthe wealth which they are about to scatter on their route and that will\r\nmake so many poor people happy. The Vagres of Ronan are ever faithful to\r\nthe sacred commandments of the Vagrery:\r\n\r\n\"Let us take from the rich and give to the poor. The Vagre who preserves\r\na sou for the morrow ceases to be a Vagre, a 'Wolf's-head,' a 'wand'ring\r\nman.' He ever divides the booty of the previous evening among the poor,\r\nso that he be compelled to pillage fresh renegade bishops, and Frankish\r\noppressors of old Gaul. Nor peace nor truce to the oppressors!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as to those other Vagres, who lean against the shafts of the\r\npillars, or are seated on the step of the altar near the snorers--their\r\neyes are as steady as their limbs; have they perchance, not also tasted\r\nthe old wines of the episcopal villa?\r\n\r\nOh! They did drink, twice, ten times more than the others; but they are\r\nveterans at the trade, old Vagres, sturdy customers who drain a pouch at\r\none gulp, and immediately after are able to walk with steady step over a\r\nbeam across the conflagration that they have lighted in the burg of a\r\nFrank, or the villa of a bishop.\r\n\r\nAnd these others--men with shaven heads, wan, clad in rags; these women\r\nand these girls, some of whom are pretty--who are they?\r\n\r\nThey are the slaves of the Church; they look happy at the sight of their\r\nday of justice and vengeance. But other slaves there are, not a few in\r\nnumber, who fled terrified into the woods. They imagined they saw the\r\nfires of heaven roll down upon the Vagres, who could be sacrilegious\r\nenough to put to the sack and fire the house of the vice-regent of God\r\non earth, their holy bishop.\r\n\r\nAnd what is Ronan doing? There he sits in full gala on the episcopal\r\nbench, decked in sacerdotal garb, and coiffed in the fur cap which count\r\nNeroweg left behind when he fled demented out of the banquet hall. Four\r\nVagres assist Ronan. They are odd-looking clerks! Jolly deacons! Among\r\nthem is Wolf's-Tooth, the giant whose waist a barrel's hoop would hardly\r\nencircle.\r\n\r\n\"Brother, are we all together?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, only the Master of the Hounds is missing. When the conflagration\r\nwas at its height, he was seen by one of our men running towards the\r\ndoor of the bishopess; he leaped through the flames and re-issued at the\r\ngarden door running with a fainting woman in his arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is doubtlessly engaged in making her regain consciousness. Well,\r\nwhile the bishopess is being revived, shall we try the bishop?\"\r\n\r\n\"The holy man has tried people, whom he said were under his\r\njurisdiction, as bishop of the city of Clermont. He is now under our\r\njurisdiction. Let us try him!\"\r\n\r\nLouder than the Vagres themselves, the slaves of the prelate set up the\r\ncry:\r\n\r\n\"Let us judge the bishop!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring him forward, on the spot!\"\r\n\r\nTwo Vagres went out in quest of the holy man of God, who had been kept\r\nlocked up in a contiguous compartment. He was brought in pinioned. Pale\r\nand wrathful he was pushed before the tribunal of Ronan and his four\r\nVagre clerks.\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur bishop,\" said Ronan to him, \"thy 'charity,' thy 'piety,' thy\r\n'exalted chastity' (thou seest I am giving thee all the honorary titles\r\nthat thou and thine bestow upon one another, holy men that ye are) thy\r\n'exalted chastity' will be kind enough to inform us of thy name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Incendiary! Pillager! Sacrilegious wretch! Those are your names! I damn\r\nand excommunicate you, you, together with your whole band! You stand\r\nexcommunicated in this world and in the next, where you will suffer\r\neverlasting tortures!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thy 'exalted chastity' answers my question with insults. Seeing that\r\nthou refusest to state thy name, I shall answer for thee. Thy name is\r\nCautin--\"\r\n\r\n\"May my name burn your tongue!\"\r\n\r\n\"Slaves of the bishopric,\" proceeded Ronan addressing those who\r\nsurrounded him, \"what charges have you to prefer against your bishop?\"\r\n\r\n\"He grinds us down with toil and with taxes. He oppresses us from\r\nmorning till night all the year long!\"\r\n\r\n\"For food he lets us have a handful of beans, for clothes rags, and for\r\nshelter rickety mud huts!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our slightest oversights are visited with the whip!\"\r\n\r\n\"He violates our daughters! What resistance can the female slave offer\r\nwhen threatened? She submits with a shudder--she weeps--\"\r\n\r\n\"That a Frank should be ready to subjugate us and whelm us with misery\r\nwe can understand: he is a conqueror who abuses his power. But that\r\nbishops, Gauls like ourselves, should join the Frank in order to share\r\nwith him the plunder that he levies upon us--that we cannot understand;\r\nsuch action must draw down the severest punishment upon the heads of the\r\nperpetrators. Oh! Our old priests, the venerated druids, never allied\r\nthemselves with the Roman conquerors of Gaul. No! No! With the sword in\r\none hand, the mistletoe twig in the other, they were ever the first to\r\ngive the signal for war against the foreigner; they roused the peoples\r\nto revolt with the words: 'The country and freedom!' The response came\r\nswift from the masses; out of their midst arose the Chief of the\r\nHundred Valleys, Sacrovir, Vindex, Marik, Civilis! And the Romans\r\ntrembled in their very Capitol!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop,\" Ronan proceeded, \"has thy exalted truthfulness anything to\r\nanswer to the accusations of thy slaves?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are all damned criminals, sacrilegious wretches who will have to\r\nanswer for their crimes when they appear before the throne of God, on\r\nthe day of last judgment. Ever after they will gnash their teeth--\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop, has thy exalted purity nothing else to say than utter insults?\"\r\n\r\n\"And may it please the Lord to turn these insults into so many tongues\r\nof fire to pierce your bodies, ye accursed men!\"\r\n\r\n\"While waiting for the fulfillment of thy wishes, listen to the further\r\nindictment against thee: Thou didst covet the goods of one of thy\r\npriests named Anastasius; he declined to let thee have them; thou didst\r\ninveigle him to Clermont; thou didst there have him seized, bound hand\r\nand foot and thrown alive into a grave with a decomposing corpse. Wilt\r\nthou dare deny that thou art guilty of that felony?\"\r\n\r\n\"A wonderful council this is, made up of beggars, sacrilegious wretches\r\nand slaves, to interrogate a bishop!\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall proceed. Thy exalted poverty, in its rage to augment its\r\nwealth, conceived this evening, under guise of a miracle, a veritable\r\nbandit's trick: thou didst plunder Count Neroweg under pressure of the\r\nfear of the devil. Under the code of the Vagrery, to plunder a Frank is\r\na pious act. But if the Vagres delight in pillaging our conquerors, it\r\nis only in order to administer to the wants of the poor by making them\r\nsharers in the plunder. On the other hand, to plunder a thief for\r\nself-gain is a sin according to the code of the Vagrery. Moreover, thou\r\ndidst absolve the count of a crime in order that thou mightst possess a\r\nyoung slave, a girl of barely fifteen years. Now, then, under the code\r\nof the Vagrery, such episcopal profligacy also is a damnable sin that\r\ndemands punishment.\"\r\n\r\nAnd addressing himself to the Vagres, Ronan added:\r\n\r\n\"Bring in the young slave!\"\r\n\r\nRonan was right. To impute fifteen years to the girl was to add to her\r\nactual age. Her blonde hair that was parted in two long and thick\r\nbraids, reached almost down to her feet, which were bare, like her arms\r\nand shoulders. In fetching her from the burg, the brutal leude had\r\nbarely given her time to dress before lifting her on the crupper of his\r\nhorse. Accordingly, now that she faced the Vagres what suppliant fear\r\nwas not readable in the large blue eyes of the poor child, who still\r\ntrembled visibly! Her nocturnal ride on the crupper of the Frankish\r\nwarrior's horse, the burning of the episcopal villa, the strange aspect\r\nof the Vagres--how many subjects of alarm to her young heart! The young\r\ngirl's cheeks must once have been full and rosy; they now were hollow\r\nand pale. The infantine figure, bearing the stamp of suffering, was\r\npainful to behold. As the young slave stepped into the chapel a feeling\r\nof sadness came over Ronan; his very voice betrayed his emotion when he\r\naddressed her:\r\n\r\n\"What is your name, my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am called Odille.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were you born?\"\r\n\r\n\"Far from here--in one of the uplands of the Mont-Dore.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old are you, little Odille?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother said to me this spring: 'Odille, it is to-day fourteen years\r\nthat you have been the joy of my life.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you become the slave of the Frankish count? Tell us your\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father died young. I lived in the mountain with my grandfather, my\r\nbrother and my mother. We lived off the yield of our herd, and we spun\r\nwool. No sorrow had ever befallen us except my father's death. One day\r\nthe Franks scaled the mountain in arms. They took our herd and said to\r\nus: 'We shall carry you to the burg of our count to restock his domain\r\nwith slaves and cattle.' My brother attempted to defend us. The Franks\r\nkilled him. They tied my mother and me to one rope, and drove us\r\ntogether with our herd of sheep before them. My grandfather begged them\r\non his knees to allow him to follow us. But the Franks said to him: 'You\r\nare too old to gain your bread as a slave.' 'But if I am left alone, I\r\nshall die of hunger on the mountain!' 'Die, then!' was their answer, and\r\nthey made us move on before them. My grandfather followed us, weeping,\r\nat a distance. The Franks stoned him to death. On their way they\r\ncaptured other slaves, took in other droves of cattle, and killed other\r\npeople of the mountain when they refused to follow. They descended into\r\nthe valley; there they made some further captures of people and cattle.\r\nThere were about fifty of us, men, women and girls. The Franks\r\nslaughtered all the children as being worthless. The first night we\r\nslept in a wood. On that night the Franks violated the women despite all\r\ntheir entreaties. I heard the sobs of my mother. They separated me from\r\nher in the evening and did me no harm. The chief of the band kept me, he\r\nsaid, for the count. The next morning we resumed our march, with me\r\nseparated from my mother. More people were killed who did not wish to\r\nmarch on--more slaves and cattle were taken. After that the troop\r\nmarched to the burg. Before arriving there a second night was spent in\r\nthe woods. The chief who reserved me for the count made me sleep beside\r\nhis horse. Early the next morning we proceeded on our route. I tried to\r\ndiscover my mother in the crowd--the Frank said to me: 'She died; two\r\nwarriors contended for her last night; in the tussle she was killed.' I\r\nwished to lie down and die, but the chief raised me on his horse, and we\r\narrived on the count's domain--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou hear, bishop?\" broke in Ronan. \"Dost thou hear, renegade\r\nGaul? It is thy allies, the Franks, who in this as well as in the other\r\nprovinces, put old men and babes to death as useless mouths, and carry\r\naway the men and women of our race to restock the lands of Gaul which\r\nthe kings have parceled out among their warriors after plundering us of\r\nour patrimony. It is thy allies, thy friends, thy brothers in Christ and\r\nin God who commit these execrable deeds. And yet thou orderest these\r\npoor people, under the penalty of hell, to obey those plunderers, those\r\nthieves, those ravishers, those murderers, who violate and kill mothers\r\nunder the very eyes of their daughters! Didst thou hear that story,\r\nGallic bishop?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Franks respect the property of the Church and the servants of the\r\nLord--while you, accursed pack, you dare to lift impious hands against\r\nboth the property and the priests of the Church!\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed,\" said Ronan to Odille.\r\n\r\n\"We arrived at the burg. The count had me taken to his chamber. He threw\r\nhimself upon me; I tried to resist; he struck me in the face with his\r\nfist; my face was bathed in blood; pain and fright rendered me\r\nsenseless, and the seigneur count violated me. I was afterwards locked\r\nup with other female slaves in the apartment of his wife Godegisele; a\r\nvery gentle woman for so wicked a man. To-night, one of the leudes came\r\nfor me and brought me hither on his horse. He said to me that I was to\r\nbe the bishop's slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does that frighten you, poor child, to be a slave of the seigneur\r\nbishop?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother and relatives were killed; I am a slave and disgraced\r\nbesides. I tried to strangle myself with my hair; but I was afraid--and\r\nyet I wish I could die.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she is only fourteen, bishop! Didst thou hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down on the steps of the altar, little Odille. Here you have only\r\nfriends; you are still young, do not despair.\"\r\n\r\nThe child contemplated the Vagre with wondering eyes; he spoke to her in\r\na gentle voice. She stepped towards the altar and sat down; she looked\r\nat Ronan only; she listened only to his words.\r\n\r\n\"O! Master of the Hounds! Master of the Hounds!\" cried one of the lusty\r\nVagres, who stood near one of the small doors of the chapel opening into\r\nthe garden. \"Whither are you bound with the bishopess on your arm? Would\r\nshe not like to come and see her darling husband, the holy Bishop\r\nCautin, before we hang him?\"\r\n\r\n\"My good seigneurs Vagres,\" said the bishopess, whose comely shape was\r\nhardly distinguishable in the shadow of the vaulted door of the chapel,\r\n\"long have I cursed yonder man who is my husband. I now no longer curse\r\nhim. Happiness renders one indulgent. Be merciful to him, as I pardon\r\nhim. For the rest, I no longer was his wife--our carnal bonds were\r\nsundered. Let him go in peace. I at last enjoy my day of freedom and of\r\nlove. Long live the Vagrery!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shameless and sacrilegious woman! Accursed burgess! You shall burn for\r\nthis in the everlasting flames of hell!\"\r\n\r\nBut Cautin's vituperation and threats were idle. The bishopess stepped\r\nout under the tall trees of the garden of the villa and continued her\r\npromenade, while Ronan again addressed the holy man:\r\n\r\n\"Sentence shall be passed upon thee by those whom thou hast oppressed.\r\nYe poor ecclesiastical slaves, what shall be done to this wicked and\r\nprofligate religious humbug who buries the living with the dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him be hanged! Death to the bishop!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Let him be hanged!\"\r\n\r\n\"He will die but one death, the infamous scoundrel! And our lives have\r\nbeen one prolonged agony!\"\r\n\r\n\"What dost thou think of that?\" said Ronan to the bishop. \"Dost thou\r\nfancy the views of these poor people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, the friend of the\r\nsorrowful, pardon this guilty man if you find his repentance sincere.\"\r\n\r\nWho was it that spoke thus? The hermit-laborer, who had until then kept\r\nhimself concealed in the shadow under one of the vaults of the chapel.\r\nAs he spoke he stepped into the light and stood before the Vagres and\r\nthe slaves who were venting their rage.\r\n\r\n\"The hermit-laborer!\" cried the slaves with touching respect. \"The\r\nfriend of the poor, of the meek and the oppressed!\"\r\n\r\n\"The consoler of those who weep!\"\r\n\r\n\"How often has he not taken in the field the hoe of one of our exhausted\r\ncompanions, and himself finished the task of the slave in order to save\r\nhim from the keeper's whip!\"\r\n\r\n\"One day, as I was pasturing the sheep that I had in charge, two lambs\r\nwent astray. The hermit-laborer looked for them until he found them and\r\nwas able to bring them back to me. Blessed be he for his charity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our little children always have a smile for the hermit-laborer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! From the moment they see him they run to him and take hold of his\r\nrobe.\"\r\n\r\n\"As poor as any of ourselves, he loves to make little presents to the\r\nchildren. He always has some fruit for them that he gathered in the\r\nwoods, a piece of wild honey-comb, or some little bird that has fallen\r\nout of its nest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love one another! Love one another like brothers, poor disinherited\r\npeople! he always says to us.--Love renders toil less arduous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hope! he also says to us.--Hope! The rule of the oppressors will pass\r\naway; and then the first will be the last, and the last will be the\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus, the friend of the sorrowful, said the iron of the slave will be\r\nbroken. Hope!\"\r\n\r\n\"Unite! Love one another! Help one another, children of one God, sons\r\nof one country! Disunited, you can do nothing; united you will be\r\nstronger than your oppressors. The day of deliverance may be nigh! Love,\r\nunity, patience!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye! Aye! These are the precepts that the hermit-laborer teaches us!\"\r\n\r\n\"And these precepts, brothers, you must remember and act upon at this\r\nhour,\" replied the monk-laborer. \"Jesus said: 'Woe to the hardened\r\nhearts! Mercy to those who repent!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Insolent monk, dare you accuse me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hermit, good friend, you hear the 'holy' man--you perceive his\r\nrepentance--what shall be done, my Vagres?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, if you love me, grant me the bishop's life!\"\r\n\r\n\"The bishop made us suffer. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will vengeance wipe out your past sufferings? Your ancestors astonished\r\nthe world by their generous bravery--and would you slay a defenseless\r\nman?\"\r\n\r\nVagres and slaves remained silent for a moment. After a short\r\nconsultation with Ronan they directed him to stipulate the conditions\r\nfor Cautin's life.\r\n\r\n\"Bishop, choose! Either be our cook or hang!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sacrilegious bandits! After pillaging and setting my episcopal villa on\r\nfire, to demand that I be their cook! Monk, you hear them! Alas! Alas!\r\nAnd you have neither curse nor anathema for them! Is it thus that you\r\ndefend me? What did you save my life for but in order to rejoice at my\r\nhumiliation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue! Jesus of Nazareth, whose life was as pure as yours is\r\nsullied; Jesus, when in the Roman pretorium, amidst the soldiers who\r\nwhelmed him with mockery and physical outrage said: 'My God, pardon\r\nthem, they know not what they do--\"\r\n\r\n\"But these scamps do know what they are doing when they make a cook of\r\nme! And would you have me pardon them their sacrilege!\"\r\n\r\n\"Consider your past life--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, my Vagres,\" said Ronan; \"come, day is dawning. Let us pack our\r\nbooty on the bishop's wagons, and on the march! What a fine day will\r\nthis be for the folks of this neighborhood!\"\r\n\r\nAnd stepping towards the little slave girl, who, seated on the steps of\r\nthe altar had quietly watched and listened to all that took place:\r\n\r\n\"Poor child, you are without father or mother, will you come with us?\r\nThe Vagrery is the world topsy-turvy. The slave and the poor are sacred\r\nto us; our hatred is for the wicked rich. If our life of adventure and\r\ndangers should frighten you, our friend the hermit will take you to some\r\ncharitable person in a neighboring village, where you may be safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall follow you, Ronan. I am a slave and an orphan,\" answered Odille\r\nweeping. \"What can I do? Where would you have me go, if not with you who\r\nspeak to me with so much kindness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, come with me, and dry your tears, little Odille. No tears\r\nare shed among the Vagres. You shall ride on one of the wagons of the\r\nvilla in which our companions will carry the booty. Come, take my arm,\r\nand let us walk out, poor little child. We shall go whithersoever chance\r\nmay take us!\"\r\n\r\nAnd seeing that the hermit was stepping towards him:\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, I shall accompany you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you join us in running the Vagrery? You, a hermit? You among us,\r\n'Wand'ring men,' 'Wolves,' 'Heads of Wolves,' Vagres that we are? A\r\nsaint in the company of demons?\"\r\n\r\n\"They that be whole need not the physician, but they that are sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monk, you are right!\" said Cautin to him in a low voice. \"You will not\r\nleave me alone in their hands? You will protect me against the\r\nPhilistines?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my duty to render these people better than they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better! The sacrilegious scoundrels, who pillaged my villa, stole my\r\nbeautiful goblets, my vases and all my money--\"\r\n\r\n\"The homicidal sword will be turned into a pruning hook to prune the\r\nflowering vine; the peaceful and teeming earth will yield its fruit for\r\nall men; the lion will lie down beside the sheep, the wolf beside the\r\nlamb, and a little child will lead them! Do not blaspheme, bishop! The\r\nCreator made His children after his own image; He made them good in\r\norder that they may be happy; blind, wretched or ignorant are the\r\nwicked. Let us heal their ignorance, their wretchedness and their\r\nblindness--and good they will become!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lies!\" cried the bishop excitedly. \"Behold yonder the woman who was my\r\nwife, with her orange skirt and gold embroidered red stockings--behold\r\nher on the arm of that bandit with the black hair. The infamous\r\nwoman--they are in each other's arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus had only words of mercy for Magdalen the courtesan and for the\r\nadulterous woman; will you dare to throw the first stone at the woman\r\nwho once was your wife? Come--come along--I pity you--lean upon my\r\narm--you are about to faint--\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Where do these accursed Vagres propose to take me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That does not concern you--mend your ways--repent!\"\r\n\r\n\"My God! My God! And there is no hope of being delivered on the road!\r\nOh! We live in frightful days!\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is it that made these days what they are, if not you, princes\r\nof the Church? Oh! For centuries did our fathers see Gaul peaceful and\r\nflourishing. She then was free!\" replied the hermit with bitterness.\r\n\"To-day she is again enslaved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our fathers were miserable heathens! At this very hour they are\r\ngnashing their teeth in all eternity!\" cried Cautin. \"We, on the\r\ncontrary, have the true faith--and the Lord has terrible punishment in\r\nstore for the wretches who dare insult His priests and plunder the goods\r\nof His Church. Look yonder, monk, is not that a sight to make one's\r\nheart break? Abomination and desolation!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTO THE FASTNESS OF ALLANGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sight that excited the wrath of the holy man filled the hearts of\r\nthe Vagres with joy. It was broad day. Four large wagons of the villa,\r\neach hitched to teams of oxen, were slowly rolling away from the\r\nsmoldering ruins of the late episcopal mansion. The wagons were loaded\r\nwith all manner of booty: gold and silver vases, curtains and beddings,\r\nfeather mattresses and bags of wheat, boxes filled with linen, hams,\r\nvenison, smoked fish, preserved fruits, and all sorts of eatables, heavy\r\nrolls of cloth that had been woven by weaver-slaves, soft cushions, warm\r\ncoverlets, shoes, cloaks, iron pots, copper basins, tin cans--all of\r\nthem dear to the heart of a housekeeper. The Vagres followed the train,\r\nsinging like larks at the rise of the beautiful June sun. On the front\r\nwagon, and seated on one of the cushions, little Odille--whom the\r\nbishopess in loving tenderness thoughtfully clad in one of her own\r\nbeautiful, although rather too long robes for the child--no longer\r\ntimorous but still laboring under the effect of her wonderment, opened\r\nher beautiful blue eyes, and, for the first time since many a long day,\r\nbreathed in freedom the fresh and invigorating morning air that reminded\r\nher often of that of her own mountains from which she was torn, poor\r\nchild, and cast into the burg of the count. Ever and anon Ronan\r\napproached the wagon:\r\n\r\n\"Take courage, Odille; you will get accustomed to us. The Vagres are not\r\nas wolfish as evil tongues pretend.\"\r\n\r\nOn another wagon, gorgeous in her gold necklaces and her most beautiful\r\ndress which her loving Vagre saved for her from the conflagration, the\r\nbishopess whiled away the time, either combed her long black hair with\r\nthe aid of a little pocket mirror, or adjusted her scarf, or hopped\r\nabout, crazy with joy, like a hen-linnet that had escaped from her cage.\r\nAt last she enjoyed that day of freedom and love that she had so\r\nardently dreamed about after having lived more than ten years almost a\r\nprisoner. The morning journey across the beautiful mountains of\r\nAuvergne, where at frequent intervals cascades of bubbling water were\r\nencountered, seemed to charm her. She chatted, laughed, sang, sang\r\nagain, and threw sidelong glances at her Vagre every time that, with his\r\nlight step and triumphant mien, he passed by her wagon. Suddenly, as her\r\neyes happened to fall upon a distant object, she seemed moved with pity.\r\nShe seized a straw-covered amphora that the Master of the Hounds had\r\nthoughtfully placed within her reach, and turning towards the rear of\r\nthe car, where several women and girls, the bishop's slaves, having\r\ngladly resolved to run the Vagrery together with their quondam mistress,\r\nwere huddled, she said to one of them:\r\n\r\n\"Carry this bottle of spiced wine to my brother, the bishop; the poor\r\nman loves to take what he calls his morning cup; but do not let him know\r\nthat I sent you.\"\r\n\r\nThe young girl to whom the bishopess gave the flask answered with a nod\r\nof intelligence, leaped down from the cart, and looked for Cautin. Most\r\nof the ecclesiastical slaves fled into the mountains when the bishop's\r\nhouse was set on fire; they feared the wrath of heaven if they joined\r\nthe Vagres; the others, however, being of a less timorous turn,\r\nresolutely accompanied the troop of the lusty men. They should have been\r\nseen--alert, frisk as if they had just risen from a restful night spent\r\nunder the foliage of the wood, they marched with elastic step, despite\r\nthe orgy of the previous night, and went and came, and skipped and\r\nchatted, and exchanged kisses with the women who were willing or with\r\nthe pouches of wine that they carried along, and bit lustily into the\r\nhams, the chunks of venison and the episcopal cakes.\r\n\r\n\"How good it is to live a Vagre's life!\"\r\n\r\nOn the last wagon, under the special watch of Wolf's-Tooth and a few\r\ncompanions who brought up the rear, Cautin, bishop and Vagre's cook,\r\naccustomed to strut on his traveling mule, or to ride through the forest\r\non his vigorous hunting steed, found the road rough, dusty and\r\nunpleasant. He perspired, panted, tossed himself about, moaned,\r\ngrumbled, grunted under the weight of his heavy paunch and invoked to\r\nhis aid all the saints of paradise.\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur bishop,\" said the young girl whom the bishopess charged with\r\nthe amphora of wine, \"here is some good spiced wine; drink it; it will\r\ngive you strength to support the fatigue of the journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give it to me! Give it to me, my daughter! God will reward you for your\r\nattachment to your father in Christ, who finds himself obliged to drink\r\nby stealth the wine of his own cellar--\"\r\n\r\nAnd clapping the amphora to his lips, he drained it at one draught. When\r\nthe flask was empty he dashed it against the floor, and looking at the\r\nyoung girl cried:\r\n\r\n\"And so you propose to run the Vagrery, little she-devil, confounded\r\nwench?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, seigneur bishop; I am now twenty years of age, and this is the\r\nfirst day of my life that I have been able to say: 'I belong to\r\nmyself--I can go and come, jump, sing, dance, just as I please'--\"\r\n\r\n\"You belong to yourself, do you, brazen minx? You belong to me! But with\r\nthe aid of God you will yet be re-captured either by the Church, or by\r\nsome Frankish seigneur--and I hope you may fall into even worse slavery,\r\nGod-forsaken wench!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will then, at least, have tasted freedom--\"\r\n\r\nAnd the young woman dashed off, jumping and singing, in pursuit of a\r\nbutterfly that fluttered in the bush.\r\n\r\nThe troop of Vagres arrived at the hovels of some slaves that belonged\r\nto the domain of the Church, and that lay scattered along the road.\r\nLittle wan, sickly looking children, absolutely bare by reason of their\r\nparents' pinching poverty, were wallowing in the dust. Their fathers\r\nwere off on the fields since dawn; their mothers, as wan-looking and\r\nthin as the children, sat at the entrance of their hovels upon bunches\r\nof decaying straw; they were clad in rags and busily plied their\r\ndistaffs for the benefit of the bishop; their long and unkempt hair\r\ntumbled over their foreheads upon their bony shoulders; their eyes were\r\nhollow, their cheeks sunburnt and sunken; the aspect that they presented\r\nwas at once so repulsive and painful that the hermit-laborer could not\r\nrefrain from pointing them out to the bishop, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Look at those unhappy creatures!\"\r\n\r\n\"Resignation, misery and sorrow here below, everlasting reward\r\nabove--otherwise as everlasting and frightful tortures!\" cried Cautin.\r\n\"The Church so decrees; it is the law of God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Blasphemer! Your words are like those of the impostor physicians who\r\npretend that man was born for fevers, the pest and ulcers, and not for\r\nhealth!\"\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the approaching and well-armed troop, the women and\r\nchildren were first afraid and ran to hide in their hovels; but stepping\r\nforward, Ronan called out to them:\r\n\r\n\"Poor women! Poor children! Be not afraid--we are your good friends the\r\nVagres!\"\r\n\r\nThe Vagrery caused the Franks and the bishops to tremble, but it was\r\noften blessed by the poor. Women and children, all of whom had at first\r\nfled with fear into their hovels, now emerged again, and one of the\r\nmothers said to Ronan:\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to know the road? I shall show it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you running away from the leudes of the seigneurs?\" said another.\r\n\"None has passed this way; you can march on in safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Women,\" answered Ronan, \"your children are naked, you and your husbands\r\ntoil from dawn to dusk; you are barely covered in rags; you lie down to\r\nsleep upon poorer straw than the swine; you live upon decayed beans;\r\noften you munch grass like cattle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! It is the truth! Our lives are wretched, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here we have for you linen, cloth, dresses, covers, mattresses, bags of\r\ngrain, full pouches, provisions of all sorts. Give, my Vagres! Give,\r\nOdille, to these poor people! Give, bishopess of the Vagrery! Give and\r\ngive again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take--take, sisters!\" said the bishopess with eyes moist with\r\ncompassionate tears, as she helped the Vagres to distribute the booty\r\ntaken at her house. \"Take, sisters! Yesterday I was a slave as\r\nyourselves, to-day I am free! Take, sisters!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take and make merry, dear women; and may your little ones never be torn\r\nfrom you!\" said Odille as she also gave a hand in the distribution of\r\nthe booty. And she wiped her eyes as she exclaimed: \"How good Ronan, the\r\nVagre, is to the poor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Blessings upon you!\" cried the poor mothers, weeping for joy. \"It is\r\nbetter to meet a Vagre than a count or a bishop.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to see with what ardor the Vagres, perched upon the\r\ncarts, distributed what they had taken from the wicked bishop; it was a\r\npleasure to see how the poor mothers' faces brightened with happiness at\r\nthe unlooked-for alms. Amazed and enraptured they contemplated the heap\r\nof all manner of articles that they had never yet made acquaintance\r\nwith. The children, more impatient than their elders, merrily hitched\r\nthemselves by twos, threes and fours to a mattress in order to transport\r\nit into one of the huts, or they put their thin arms around a bundle of\r\nlinen and sought to lift it in. Suddenly, however, a wrathful and\r\nthreatening voice, a veritable mar-plot, froze the marrow of the poor\r\nfolks with terror.\r\n\r\n\"Woe unto you! Damnation upon your families! if you dare to touch with\r\nsacrilegious hands the goods of the Church! Tremble! Tremble! It is a\r\nmortal sin! You, your husbands, your children, you will all be thrown\r\ninto the flames of hell for all time!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Bishop Cautin. Despite the remonstrances of the hermit-laborer,\r\nhe dashed in among the startled slaves, and fulminated his anathemas.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! We shall touch nothing of all that is offered us, holy bishop!\"\r\nanswered the mothers with a shudder. \"We shall not touch any of the\r\ngoods of the Church.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Vagres!\" cried Ronan, \"Hang the bishop on the nearest tree! We shall\r\nnot lack for a cook.\"\r\n\r\nAlready they were seizing the holy man, who now grew paler and trembled\r\nin greater terror than the most awe-struck of the mothers who had just\r\nbeen running over with joy, when the monk again interposed to save\r\nCautin from the noose.\r\n\r\n\"The hermit!\" cried the mothers and their children. \"The\r\nhermit-laborer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Blessed be you, the friend of the sorrowful!--\"\r\n\r\n\"Blessed be you, the friend of little children!--\"\r\n\r\nAnd the hands of all the little ones took hold of the robe of the\r\nhermit, who said in his sweet and clear voice:\r\n\r\n\"Dear women, dear little ones; take what is given you; take without\r\nfear; Jesus said: 'Woe unto the rich who share not their bread with\r\nthose who hunger, and their cloak with those who are cold.' Your bishop\r\ngives you all these good things. Take all that is offered to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Blessings upon you, holy bishop!\" exclaimed the mothers, raising their\r\narms in thankfulness to Cautin. \"Blessed be you, good father, for your\r\ngenerous gifts!\"\r\n\r\n\"I give nothing!\" cried Cautin. \"You shall burn eternally in hell, if\r\nyou listen to that apostate hermit!\"\r\n\r\nThe larger number of the women looked undecided from Ronan to the\r\nbishop and the hermit. They put their hands forward and withdrew them\r\nagain from the articles that were offered them. But two of the oldest of\r\nthem resolutely drew away from the goods of the Church, and throwing\r\nthemselves down upon their knees murmured affrighted:\r\n\r\n\"Holy Bishop Cautin! Pardon us for having even for a moment harbored the\r\nthought of committing so great a crime. Mercy! Mercy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, my sisters!\" resumed the hermit. \"Your bishop gives you all\r\nthese good things. He knows that the Lord has equal love for all his\r\nchildren, and does not wish that some should be naked and freeze, while\r\nothers perspire under the useless weight of twenty gowns; that some\r\nshould suffer hunger, while others are filled to repletion. Fear not\r\nthat your bishop will either hunger or suffer cold; he has new and warm\r\nclothing on; he knows not what to do with so many robes; he can not\r\ndrink all those pouches of wine; he can not eat up all these provisions!\r\nTake, take--the goods of a bishop are the property of the poor.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the unhappy mothers, convinced by the words of the hermit, and\r\nalso driven by the lash of their needs, began busily to transport the\r\nproffered goods of the Church into their huts, aided by their children.\r\nOnly three elderly ones dared not to join; they remained on their knees\r\nand smote their breasts.\r\n\r\n\"Dear daughters in Christ! Persevere in your holy horror for sacrilege!\"\r\nthe bishop cried to the three kneeling women. \"You will enter paradise\r\nand will hear the seraphim play on the harp before the Lord, while they\r\nsing His praises!\"\r\n\r\n\"My Vagres!\" again Ronan called out. \"A rope! Let the hypocritical\r\nbabbler be strung up high and dry! It is evident that he has made up his\r\nmind to hang!\"\r\n\r\nWith a gesture the hermit arrested the anger of the Vagres and said:\r\n\r\n\"Bishop, do you recognize the words of Jesus of Nazareth as divine? 'Him\r\nthat taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take away thy coat also.' What\r\nthought did Jesus mean to convey by these words, but that only too often\r\ntheft has want for its cause, and that charity should be exercised and\r\npity had for such want. Relinquish voluntarily these superfluous goods,\r\nyou who have taken the vow of poverty, charity and chastity!\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep still, tempting hermit, who dare contradict our bishop! We may not\r\nlay our fingers on the goods of the Church!\" cried one of the three\r\nkneeling women. \"We would be damned for all time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" shouted the other two. \"Keep still, hermit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor creatures! Steeped in ignorance and blindness!\" exclaimed Ronan.\r\n\"Do you care for the life of your bishop?\"\r\n\r\n\"We would undergo a thousand deaths for his sake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Pious women!\" cried Cautin ecstatically. \"What a superb part of\r\nparadise will not be yours! And now, until the day of eternal life come,\r\nI give you absolution for all your past sins, and all the future ones\r\nthat you may commit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, beloved bishop!\" cried the kneeling mothers smiting their chests.\r\n\"A saint among saints! Thanks--thanks to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, ye poor sheep who mistake the butcher for the shepherd,\"\r\nsaid Ronan to them. \"If you do not forthwith profit by our offer, we\r\nshall hang the bishop before your very eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is a rope,\" said Wolf's-Tooth, and he put the noose around\r\nCautin's neck.\r\n\r\n\"Dear daughters, take everything!\" cried the prelate acting under a new\r\ninspiration. \"Your father in Christ requests you, adjures you, orders\r\nyou to accept the booty--accept it quick!\" he added as he felt the noose\r\ntighten.\r\n\r\nOne of the three kneeling women rose and obeyed with alacrity; the other\r\ntwo remained on their knees and said:\r\n\r\n\"You are only trying us, holy bishop!\"\r\n\r\n\"But these heathens are going to hang me--\"\r\n\r\n\"A holy man like you does not fear martyrdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my daughters, I do not fear martyrdom--but I think I am\r\nindispensable for the salvation of my flock. I pray you, carry that\r\nbooty away! If you do not, I shall damn you! I shall excommunicate you!\r\nConfounded old hags! Miserable wretches, you will have to answer for my\r\ndeath on the day of judgment!\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy bishop, you seek to try us to the last. You just said to us that\r\nto touch the goods of the Church is mortal sin. Would you order us to\r\ncommit a mortal sin?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! No!\" screamed the other of the two mothers who had remained on\r\ntheir knees; she smote her breast and added: \"Holy man, you could never\r\nthink of ordering us to commit mortal sin! You are to receive\r\nmartyrdom!--\"\r\n\r\n\"And from the heavens above you will throw your blessings upon us, great\r\nand good St. Cautin!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop, do you hear these poor old women? You sowed, now you are\r\nharvesting. Come, my Vagres, draw the rope!\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the hermit interposed in order to protect the prelate. At that\r\nmoment the Vagres who were on the carts were heard crying:\r\n\r\n\"The leudes! The Frankish warriors!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are seven of them! They are on horseback! They are leading a gang\r\nof chained men! Up, my Vagres! Death to the leudes! Freedom to the\r\nslaves!\"\r\n\r\n\"Death to the leudes! Freedom to the slaves!\" shouted the Vagres and ran\r\nto their arms.\r\n\r\n\"The Franks have come to capture me and take me back to the burg of the\r\ncount!\" cried little Odille. \"Oh, Ronan, protect me!\"\r\n\r\n\"There will not be one of them left alive to carry you back!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, no imprudence!\" said the hermit. \"These horsemen may be only a\r\nscouting party riding ahead of a numerous troop. Send out scouters\r\nagainst scouters; keep the bulk of your men in reserve and have them\r\nentrench themselves behind the wagons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monk, you are right. You talk like an experienced soldier. You must\r\nhave made war?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little--occasionally--whenever it was necessary to protect the weak\r\nagainst the strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankish warriors!\" cried Cautin clasping his hands with a triumphant\r\nair. \"Friends! Allies! I am saved! Help, dear brothers in Christ! This\r\nway, my beloved sons in God! Fall upon this rabble. Deliver me from the\r\nhands of the Philistines! This way, my--\"\r\n\r\nGiving a jerk to the rope around the neck of the holy man, Ronan\r\nsuddenly checked his flow of speech by drawing the noose tight.\r\n\r\n\"Bishop, no useless cries!\" said the hermit; \"and you, Ronan, no\r\nviolence; drop that rope!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; but I shall bind his arms; and if he again breaks in upon my\r\nears I shall run my sword through him--\"\r\n\r\n\"The Frankish riders have reined in their horses the moment they caught\r\nsight of the wagons,\" cried one of the Vagres; \"they seem to be\r\ndeliberating what to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our deliberation will not be long. There are seven of the mounted\r\nFranks; let six Vagres follow me, and by the faith of Ronan, it will not\r\nbe long before there will be seven conquerors less in Gaul!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are the six of us--let us forward!\"\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Hounds was among the six Vagres. Seeing him examine\r\nthe handle of his axe, the bishopess leaped down from her wagon, and,\r\nher eyes sparkling, her nostrils inflated and her cheeks on fire, she\r\nrolled up the right sleeve of her silk robe, and thus baring her white,\r\nbeautiful and strong arm up to the shoulder, she cried:\r\n\r\n\"Give me a sword! A sword!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is one! What will you do with it, beautiful bishopess in Vagrery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall fight beside my Vagre!\" Saying this the bishopess seized the\r\nproffered weapon like a Gallic woman of ancient days, and dashed forward\r\nupon the foe.\r\n\r\n\"Little Odille, you wait here for me. When the Franks are slain I shall\r\nreturn to you,\" said Ronan to the young girl, who, pale with fear,\r\nsought to hold him back with both hands and rested upon him her\r\nbeautiful blue eyes now moist with tears. \"Do not tremble, poor child!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan,\" she murmured convulsively seizing the arm of the Vagre, \"I have\r\nneither father nor mother left; you delivered me from the count and the\r\nbishop; you have a good heart; you are full of pity for the poor; you\r\nhave treated me with the tenderness of a brother; it was only last night\r\nthat I saw you for the first time, and yet it seems to me that I have\r\nknown you long, long--\"\r\n\r\nAnd the girl took both the Vagre's hands, kissed them, and added with\r\ntremulous lips:\r\n\r\n\"If those Franks should kill you!--\"\r\n\r\n\"If they should kill me, little Odille?\"\r\n\r\nSaying this the Vagre turned his head towards the hermit, and pointing\r\nto him with his eyes added:\r\n\r\n\"Should the Franks kill me, yonder good hermit-laborer will protect\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise you, my child, should misfortune befall your friend, I shall\r\nprotect you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Little Odille,\" Ronan now said with almost embarrassed mien, \"one kiss\r\non your forehead--it will be first, and may be the last.\"\r\n\r\nThe child was weeping silently; she reached her girlish forehead to\r\nRonan; he touched it with his lips, and raising his sword dashed off on\r\na run. Hardly had Ronan left when the cry of the Vagres was heard\r\nattacking the leudes. At the cries, Odille threw herself distracted\r\ninto the arms of the hermit, hid her face on his breast and sobbed\r\naloud:\r\n\r\n\"They will kill him! They will kill him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Courage, Franks! Courage, my sons in God!\" shouted Cautin from the\r\ncart-wheel to which he was bound fast. \"Exterminate those Moabites!\r\nAbove all cut to pieces that she-devil wife of mine, that brazen woman\r\nwith the orange dress with the blue sash and silver embroidered\r\nstockings. No mercy for the Jezebel! the shameless wench! the slattern!\r\nHack her to pieces!--\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop! Bishop! Your words are inhuman. Remember the mercifulness of\r\nJesus towards Magdalen and the adulteress!\" exclaimed the hermit, while\r\nOdille, with her head resting on the breast of that true disciple of the\r\nyoung man of Nazareth murmured:\r\n\r\n\"They will kill Ronan! They will kill him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here I am back to you, little Odille! The Franks did not kill me. The\r\npeople whom they brought in chains are all set free!\"\r\n\r\nWho said this? It was Ronan. What? Back so soon? Yes! The Vagres do\r\ntheir work quickly. With one bound Odille was in the arms of her friend.\r\n\r\n\"I killed one of them--he was just about to run my Vagre through with\r\nhis sword!\" cried the bishopess returning from the encounter. And\r\nthrowing down her blood-stained sword, her eyes sparkling, her bosom\r\nhalf covered by her long black tresses that, together with her robe,\r\nwere thrown into disorder by the heat of the combat, she said to the\r\nMaster of the Hounds: \"Are you satisfied with your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Strong in the embrace of love, and strong in battle are your arms!\"\r\nanswered the young man delighted. \"And now, a full cup of wine!\"\r\n\r\n\"To drink in my very face wine that was mine! To court and caress before\r\nmy own eyes that impure woman who was my wife!\" murmured the bishop.\r\n\"Oh, monstrous! These are the signs that foretell frightful calamities\r\nabout to afflict the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThree of the Vagres were wounded. The hermit attended them with so much\r\nskill that he might have been taken for a physician. He was about to\r\nproceed to another of the wounded men when his eyes fell upon the people\r\nwhom the leudes had brought with them and who were now set free by the\r\nmen of Ronan. These unhappy folks who only a few minutes before were\r\nprisoners, were covered with rags; nevertheless the joy of deliverance\r\nshone upon their faces. Invited by their liberators to eat and drink in\r\norder to recruit their strength, they were eagerly acquitting themselves\r\nof their task. While they drained the pouches of wine and caused the\r\nloaves of bread and the hams to vanish, the monk said to one of them, a\r\nrobust man despite his grey hair:\r\n\r\n\"Brother, who are you? Whence do you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are colonists and slaves. We formerly owned and cultivated the\r\nparcels of land that the son of Clovis newly joined as benefices to the\r\nsalic and military domains that the Frankish count Neroweg previously\r\nheld from his father by the right of conquest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the count, accordingly, strip you of your fields and houses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would to heaven, dear hermit, that he had done so!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your answer is strange!\"\r\n\r\n\"The count, on the contrary, left the fields to us, and he even added\r\ntwo hundred acres to them, the accursed man! The two hundred acres\r\nbelonged to my friend and neighbor Fereol, who fled out of fear for the\r\nFranks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your property is doubled, friend, and yet you complain!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I complain! Is it that you do not know what is going on in Gaul?\r\nThis is what the count said to me: 'My glorious King has made me count\r\nof this country, and, besides, he has given me as a benefice, which I\r\nhope will become hereditary as my military lands, all these domains,\r\nincluding the cattle, houses and people upon them. You will cultivate\r\nfor me the fields that belong to you; I shall join several new parcels\r\nto them; you will be my colonist and your laborers my slaves; all of you\r\nwill work for me and my leudes; you will furnish them as well as myself\r\nwith all that we shall need. You shall help my mason and carpenter\r\nslaves in the building of a new burg that I shall have erected after the\r\nGermanic fashion. It is to be large, commodious and properly fortified,\r\nand it is to be located in the center of an old Roman camp that I\r\ndiscovered nearby. Your horses and cattle having become mine will haul\r\nthe stones and logs of wood that are too heavy for men to carry. Besides\r\nthat you shall pay me a hundred gold sous annually, ten of which I shall\r\ngive to the King when I annually render him homage for the lands that I\r\nhold.' 'A hundred gold sous!' I cried. 'My lands, jointly with those of\r\nmy neighbor Fereol, will not yield such a sum year in and year out! How\r\ndo you expect me to pay you a hundred gold sous, besides feeding you,\r\nyour leudes and your retinues, and keeping myself, my family and my\r\nlaborers, now your slaves, alive?' Threatening me with his club, the\r\ncount answered me saying: 'I shall have my hundred gold sous every\r\nyear--if you fail, I shall have my leudes cut off your feet and\r\nhands--'\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor man!\" observed the hermit sadly. \"And like so many others you\r\nconsented to the servitude? You accepted the hard conditions?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else was I to do? How could I resist the count and his leudes? I\r\nonly had a few laborers, and to them the priests preached submission to\r\nthe conquerors, who, sword in hand, say to us: 'The fields of your\r\nfathers, fructified by their labors and yours, are now ours--you shall\r\ncultivate them for us.' What were we to do? Resist? It was impossible!\r\nFlee? That would be to rush into slavery in some other region, seeing\r\nthat all the provinces are equally invaded by the Franks. I had a young\r\nwife--both servitude and a wandering life frightened me more for her\r\nsake than for mine--moreover, I was attached to the region and the\r\nfields on which I was born. The thought was unbearable to me of having\r\nto cultivate those very fields for another, and yet I preferred not to\r\nleave them. Myself and my laborers resigned ourselves to shocking\r\nmisery, to incessant toil! Such was the life we led for many a year. By\r\ndint of hard work and privations I succeeded in supplying the wants of\r\nNeroweg and his leudes, and of making my lands yield from seventy to\r\neighty gold sous a year. Twice did the count put me to the torture in\r\norder to force me to give him the hundred gold sous that he demanded of\r\nme. I did not own one denier outside of the moneys that I paid him. My\r\ntorture and subsequent long physical pain was all the comfort that he\r\nhad for his cruelty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did the thought never occur to you,\" asked Ronan, \"of choosing some\r\nfine dark night to set the burg on fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! The priests persuade the slaves that the harder their lot is on\r\nearth, all the happier will they be in paradise. I could not rely upon\r\nmy companions in slavery, besotted as they were with the fear of the\r\ndevil and unnerved by misery. Besides, I had little children; and their\r\nmother, consumed with grief, was ailing; finally, this year, the poor\r\ncreature fortunately died. My sons had grown up to be men, and they and\r\nI, together with a few other slaves who were all tired of unrequited and\r\ncontinuous toil for the benefit of the count and his leudes, finally\r\ntook to flight. We took refuge on the domain of the Bishop of Issoire.\r\nIt was but an exchange of masters, still we hoped to find the prelate a\r\nless cruel master than the count. The count was set upon recapturing me\r\nwho had managed for so many years to extract from my lands so much\r\nwealth for him and his leudes. Having learned of our asylum, he ordered\r\nsome of his leudes to take horse and reclaim us from the Bishop of\r\nIssoire. The bishop surrendered us. His men bound our hands, and the\r\nleudes were taking us back to the count when these good Vagres killed\r\nour captors and set us free. By my faith! Vagres we shall now be--all of\r\nus--I, my sons and the other slaves whom you see yonder. Will you have\r\nus, ye bold runners of the night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" cried the companions of the colonist. \"It is better far to\r\nrun the Vagrery than to cultivate our fathers' lands under the club of a\r\ncount and his leudes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop! Bishop!\" remarked Ronan to the prelate. \"Behold what your\r\nallies have turned our old Gaul into! But, I swear by torch and fire, by\r\nblood and massacre, I swear, the hour shall come when neither prelates\r\nnor seigneurs will have aught but smoldering ruins and bleaching bones\r\nto rule over! Up! new brothers in Vagrery! Be like ourselves 'Wand'ring\r\nmen,' 'Wolves,' 'Wolves-Heads!' Like ourselves you will live like wolves\r\nand happy--in summer under the leafy green, in winter in caverns warm.\r\nUp, my Vagres! Up! The sun is high! We have in these carts still much\r\nbooty left to be distributed on our way. Let us proceed, little Odille\r\nand beautiful bishopess! Let us pillage the seigneurs, and give freely\r\nto the poor! Let us keep only just enough to feast upon to-night in the\r\nfastness of Allange under the dome of the stately old oak trees. On the\r\nmarch! And to-morrow, when the last pouch will have been emptied, then\r\non the hunt again, my Vagres, so long as there shall be a single burg\r\nleft standing in Gaul, or a single episcopal residence! Let us burn down\r\nall the dens of tyranny! Death to the seigneurs and their bishops!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the troop resumed its march to the sound of the Vagres' song. When,\r\nat sunset, they arrived at the fastness of Allange, which was one of\r\ntheir haunts, all the booty that was taken at the episcopal villa had\r\nbeen distributed along the route among the poor. Only a few mattresses\r\nfor the women, the gold and silver goblets out of which to drink the\r\nbishop's wine, and the necessary provisions for the night's festival\r\nwere left. The eight teams of oxen were to furnish the roast for the\r\ngigantic feast, because gigantic it was to be seeing that the troop of\r\nVagres had gathered many recruits on the route--slaves, artisans,\r\nlaborers and colonists, all of whom were enraged with misery, without\r\ncounting a number of young women, all of whom were eager to run the\r\nVagrery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nVAGRES AT FEAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat delightful feasts are those held in Vagrery! Does, stags,\r\nwild-boars, killed by the Vagres the day before in the thickets of the\r\nforest that shade the fastness of Allange--all, together with the oxen\r\nfrom the wagons, have been dispatched and grilled over a roaring oven.\r\nWhat! An oven in a forest? An oven large enough to embrace oxen, does,\r\nstags and wild-boars? Yes; the good God has dug for the good Vagres a\r\nnumber of large pits in the secluded fastnesses of Allange. They are\r\nspacious craters, now extinct like other volcanic apertures in Auvergne.\r\nIs not one of these deep semi-circular grottoes, in which a man can\r\nstand upright, a veritable bake-house? Fill up the grotto with dry wood;\r\none or two dead oaks will suffice; set the pyre on fire; it burns up\r\nhigh and becomes a brasier: the bottom, the walls, the lava vault--all\r\nare soon red hot, and into the chasm, ablaze like the mouth of hell,\r\nstags, does, whole wild-boars and oxen are rolled in to broil. That\r\ndone, the opening of the grotto is closed with lava rocks, a huge oven\r\nof glowing embers. Four or five hours later, oxen and game, grilled to\r\nthe point, are served steaming and toothsome upon the table. What!\r\nTables also in Vagrery! Certes, and covered with the finest of green\r\ncarpet. What table? What carpet? The lawn of a forest clearing. And for\r\nseats? Again that lawn. For tent the lofty oaks; for ornaments the arms\r\nsuspended from the branches. For dome the starry sky. For chandelier the\r\nmoon at her fullest. For perfumery the night odor of wild flowers. For\r\nmusicians the nightingales and all the other songsters of the woods.\r\n\r\nSeveral Vagres, placed on watch at the outskirt of the forest and near\r\nthe approaches of the fastnesses of Allange, guarded the troop against a\r\nsurprise in case that, the sack and burning of the villa becoming known,\r\nthe Frankish counts and dukes of the region should fear an attack upon\r\ntheir own burgs, and start with their leudes in the pursuit of the\r\nVagres.\r\n\r\nDespite his ire, Bishop Cautin excelled himself as a cook. Long before\r\nhad a certain sauce known to be a favorite with the bishop been the\r\nsubject of talk in Vagrery. The holy man was ordered to produce it. He\r\ndid. He filled with it a large caldron into which each one dipped his\r\nroast, whether of game or beef--it was a toothsome sauce, made of old\r\nwine and oil, aromated with wild thyme. It was pronounced delectable.\r\nBiting into her Vagre's roast with her white teeth the bishopess\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\"I now no longer wonder that he who was my husband always showed himself\r\nso implacable towards his kitchen slaves, and that he had them whipped\r\nfor their slightest negligence--the seigneur bishop was a better cook\r\nthan any of them. No wonder he was hard to please!\"\r\n\r\nOnly two of the guests did not join in the spirit of the feast--the\r\nhermit-laborer and the young female slave who sat near Ronan. As to\r\nRonan, he did ample justice to the repast; but the monk seemed to be\r\nabsorbed in contemplation as he looked up at the starry vault overhead,\r\nand little Odille also dreamed--as she contemplated Ronan. The gold and\r\nsilver vases, whatever their previous destination, circulated from hand\r\nto hand; the wine pouches collapsed in even measure as the stomachs of\r\nthe drinkers became inflated; merry jokes, loud outbursts of laughter,\r\nkisses stolen and given from and by Vagres and Vagresses;--it was a\r\nmirthful and giddy festivity. Ever and anon, nevertheless, and generally\r\non the subject of some pretty face, a dispute would break out between\r\ntwo Vagres, just as used to happen during the ancient banquets of the\r\nGauls. Then swords would be taken down from the trees and crossed by the\r\ncombatants, but never in hatred, ever in the exuberance of spirit:\r\n\r\n\"That thrust is for you--mine shall the pretty girl be!\"\r\n\r\n\"And this other thrust is for you--the damsel shall be mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hit! That is for her roguish eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Parried! Mine remains the daisy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm wounded! Help, my belle!\"\r\n\r\n\"I die! Good-bye to my love!\"\r\n\r\nThe wounded Vagre was attended to; the dead one was covered with leaves.\r\nHonor to the brave who will be born anew in yonder worlds, and long live\r\nthe feasts of the Vagrery! And the exchange of repartees continued--some\r\nwere mirthful, others strange, and not a few sad. The repartees\r\nreflected the state of affairs in Gaul, her people, and the miseries of\r\nthe nation as she lay debased and demoralized at the feet of the\r\nconquerors; the repartees produced a picture better than chroniclers or\r\nhistorians could ever reproduce it, even if ever this country of iron\r\nshould find its historian.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! What happy days these are!\" exclaimed Wolf's-Tooth as he gnawed on\r\nthe ivory of his second shoulder of doe. \"Ah! what jolly days do we owe\r\nto these times of disorder, of pillage, of combats on the highways, of\r\nsieges of burgs and episcopal villas and of their smoldering embers that\r\nwe leave behind! Ah! What rollicking times do not these Frankish Kings\r\nfurnish us with!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan said it--old Gaul is on fire--let us dance and drink upon the\r\nruins--let us make love on the ashes of the palaces and upon the\r\nextinguished coals of the episcopal villas that we turned into\r\nbonfires!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, great bishop! Oh, great St. Remi! Blessings upon you, who, at the\r\nbasilica of Reims, in the midst of incense and flowers, now over fifty\r\nyears ago baptized Clovis as a submissive son of the Roman Church!\r\nBlessings upon you, St. Remi, the patron of highwaymen and bandits!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she? Aye, where is she, the proud and powerful Gaul of the\r\ndays of the Chief of the Hundred Valleys, of the Sacrovirs, the\r\nVindexes, the Civiles, the Victorias?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the present inheritor of Gaul's one-time valor? The Vagres, the\r\n'Wolves-Heads,' the 'Wolves!' It is they alone who still carry on the\r\nstruggle against the barbarians!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet we are hunted like wild beasts, put to the rack and hanged if\r\ntaken!\"\r\n\r\n\"But our nails are sharp and our teeth trenchant to tear to pieces and\r\ndevour our enemies!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet they call us robbers!\"\r\n\r\n\"And murderers!\"\r\n\r\n\"And sacrilegious wretches!\"\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, we but follow the example of our glorious new masters--the\r\nFrankish kings, dukes and counts; they kill, we massacre; they pillage,\r\nwe steal; they lay waste, we burn down. Death to the seigniory!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sad are the times in which we live!\" said the bishopess as she\r\nunloosened her long black tresses to the wind. \"These are days of\r\nsanguinary fury! days of unbridled debauchery! days of vertigo, in which\r\none rushes into evil paths with wild ecstasy. Oh, holy virtue of our\r\nmothers! tender chastity! noble and undefiled love! Where shall we look\r\nfor you in these days? Shall we look for you in the hut of the female\r\nslave whom her masters outrage? Shall we look for you in the house of\r\nthe free woman, whose very hearth is turned under her own eyes into a\r\nbrothel? Oh! Let us shut our eyes, and die young! Will you die, my\r\nVagre? To-morrow, at the first rays of the sun; to-morrow, at the hour\r\nwhen the birds awake; to-morrow put your hand in mine, and let us depart\r\ntogether for those unknown worlds, whither our ancestors bravely and\r\nwillingly took their departure in order to live together!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let love reign until to-morrow! And until then, a sweet kiss, my\r\nVagress!\"\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Hounds received the kiss, while his neighbor, grave\r\nlike a man half-seas over, said in a magisterial voice:\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, I have an idea--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your idea, Symphorien, seems to be to drain that amphora to the very\r\nbottom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to begin with--and then to prove to you--_logice_ and _a\r\npriori_--\"\r\n\r\n\"To the devil with your Roman tongue!\"\r\n\r\n\"Brothers, not because one is a Vagre does it follow that he can not be\r\nversed in letters and philosophy. I used to teach rhetoric to the young\r\nclerks of the Bishop of Limoges. I received a call from the Bishop of\r\nTulle for the same office. As I was crossing the Jargeaux mountains on\r\nthe way from the one town to the other, I was captured in the woods by a\r\nband of bad Vagres--there are good and bad Vagres. And those Vagres sold\r\nme to a slave merchant, and he sold me again to the bishop of--\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil take this rhetorician! Look at him traveling up hills and\r\ndown dales.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such is frequently the effect of rhetoric. It carries one across the\r\nplains of imagination. But let me return to what I wanted to prove to\r\nyou _logice_--it is this: We need not worry ourselves over the leudes\r\nnor any other armed bands that might be in pursuit of us, because,\r\n_logice_--the Lord God will perform a miracle in our favor to disengage\r\nus of our enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"A miracle in favor of us, Vagres? Are we, perchance, on such good terms\r\nwith heaven?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are on all the better terms with heaven for living like wolves, like\r\ntrue wolves. Therefore, _logice_, the Lord will deliver us from our\r\nenemies by miracles. And that I shall now proceed to prove to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the proof, learned Symphorien--to the proof! We are waiting for your\r\narguments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MIRACLE OF ST. MARTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rhetorician straightened himself up and proceeded to the proof.\r\n\r\n\"I'm at it,\" he said. \"But first of all, brothers, answer me this\r\nquestion: Under whose royal claws did this beautiful land of Auvergne\r\nfall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the claws of Clotaire, the last and worthy son of King Clovis.\r\nHaving married the widow of his second nephew Theobald, Clotaire now\r\nowns Auvergne by double right. He is now in this year 558 the sole king\r\nof all conquered Gaul. Glory to the Saints in heaven! Now, then, that\r\nClotaire is the wedder of the whole human race. The bishops have married\r\nhim as many times as it has pleased him to celebrate fresh weddings;\r\nthey remarried him even during the lives of most of his wives. They\r\nmarried him to Gundiogue, the wife of his own brother; they married him\r\nto Radegonde, to Ingonde and, a fortnight later to the latter's sister,\r\ncalled Aregonde; they married him to Chemesne, to several others, and\r\nfinally to Waltrade, the widow of his second nephew Theobald. But all\r\nthese are only peccadillos--\"\r\n\r\n\"Learned, very learned Symphorien, you promised to prove to us _logice_\r\nthat heaven would rain miracles in our favor; but your rhetoric tends to\r\nprove just one thing--that Clotaire is an eternal wedder--\"\r\n\r\n\"My rhetoric first establishes the premises, you will presently see what\r\nconclusions flow from them--_ergo_, I shall establish one more\r\nprefigurement, which I shall also need for my argument. It is this:\r\nAmong other crimes, this Clotaire committed one before which even Clovis\r\nmight have recoiled. The affair happened in Paris in the year 533, in\r\nthe old Roman palace inhabited by the Frankish kings. Now listen--\"\r\n\r\n\"We are listening, learned Symphorien. It is pleasant to the ear to hear\r\nthe praises of kings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly, it was about twenty-five years ago. Clovis had long before\r\ngone to paradise upon the recommendation of the bishops and after having\r\npartitioned Gaul between his four sons--Thierry, Childebert, Clodomir\r\nand this Clotaire, who is to-day the sole king of all these conquered\r\nprovinces. Clodomir died shortly after and left two children. These were\r\ntaken in charge by their grandmother, the widow of Clovis, old Queen\r\nClotilde. She had her two little grandsons brought up beside her, until\r\nthey should be of age to assure the inheritance of their father's\r\nkingdom. One day, when she was in Paris, Childebert, who lived in that\r\ncity, sent secretly one of his confidential servants to the kind-hearted\r\nClotaire with the message: 'Our mother Clotilde keeps the children of\r\nour brother near her, and she wishes them to enter into possession of\r\nhis kingdom; come quickly to Paris in order that we may consider what is\r\nto be done with them, whether we shall have their hair cut short like\r\nthe rest of the people, and have them locked up in a monastery, or\r\nwhether we shall kill them and thus share among ourselves the kingdom of\r\ntheir father, our brother'--\"\r\n\r\n\"The story begins to be affectionate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the fraternity in vogue among the Franks.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Vagre would ever think of killing his own brother's children in\r\norder to seize their property?\"\r\n\r\n\"None! None would think of such a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are wolves, and wolves do not devour one another--my brothers--\"\r\n\r\n\"And were those children whom they sought to slay still young, learned\r\nSymphorien?\"\r\n\r\n\"One was ten, the other seven--\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor little creatures--\"\r\n\r\n\"I pursue my narrative. Clotaire arrived in Paris, deliberated with his\r\nbrother, and the two acting in concert visited old Queen Clotilde and\r\nsaid to her: 'Send us your grandchildren that we may embrace them, and\r\nforthwith announce them to the people as the heirs of their father's\r\nkingdom.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! These Frankish kings are ever as wily as they are bloodthirsty! It\r\nwas a lure, was it not, learned Symphorien?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will soon see what their project was. Clovis' widow was happy, and\r\nsent the little children to their uncles, saying to the little ones: 'I\r\nshall forget that I lost your father when I see you succeed him in his\r\nkingdom.' The moment the children arrived at their uncles' they were\r\nseparated from their slaves and governors, and kept in close\r\nconfinement. Clotaire and Childebert then sent an emissary to the\r\nchildren's grandmother. In one hand he carried a pair of shears, in the\r\nother a naked sword. He said to old Queen Clotilde: 'Glorious Queen, our\r\nlords, your sons, desire to know your preference with regard to your\r\ngrandsons--do you wish them to be shorn, that is, locked up in a\r\nconvent, or would you prefer to have them slain?' 'If they are to\r\nrenounce their father's throne,' cried the old Queen indignant, 'I would\r\nprefer to see them dead rather than shorn.' The emissary returned and\r\nsaid to the two kings: 'You have the Queen's wishes to finish the work\r\nthat you began.' Immediately thereupon King Clotaire takes the eldest by\r\nthe arm, throws him on the ground, and plunges his knife under the boy's\r\narm-pit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor, dear little one!\" murmured Odille weeping. \"He must have died\r\ncalling to his mother for help--\"\r\n\r\n\"The royal butcher knew the right spot to plunge his knife in the\r\nchild's body,\" observed Ronan; \"that is the proper way to kill lambkins.\r\nProceed, learned Symphorien.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the cries of the child, his younger brother rushes in and throws\r\nhimself at Childebert's feet, and clinging to his legs with all his\r\nstrength, cries out to him: 'Uncle! Good uncle! Come to my help! Do not\r\nlet me be killed like my brother!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Touched to the heart for an instant, Childebert says to Clotaire:\r\n'Grant me the life of this child.' But Clotaire answers enraged: 'Either\r\npush the child off your knees, or you will die in his stead! It is you\r\nwho led me into this affair, and now your heart seems to fail you!'\"\r\n\r\n\"The good Clotaire was right,\" put in Ronan. \"First to scheme the\r\nassassination of the children, and then to recoil before the deed was to\r\ninsult the stock of the glorious King Clovis. But Childebert thought\r\nbetter, in honor of his royal family, did he not, learned Symphorien?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else could he? Childebert pushed the child off from his knees and\r\nthrew him towards Clotaire, who plunged his knife under the boy's\r\narm-pit as he had done with the other, and killed him. The two kings\r\nforthwith put all the slaves and governors of the two children to death,\r\nand divided their kingdom among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the manner in which monarchies are founded,\" observed Ronan.\r\n\"Oh, by Rita-Gaur, the inspired Gaul of olden days who had a blouse\r\nwoven of the beard of the kings! All these monsters deserve to be\r\nexterminated, do you not think so, friend?\" he added, addressing the\r\nhermit laborer, who had silently listened to the narrative. \"Is it not\r\nthe duty of all sons of Gaul to take the field in permanence against\r\nthese wild beasts who have invaded our country, reduced us to vile\r\nslavery?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is better to prevent the evil than to kill the criminal,\" answered\r\nthe hermit.\r\n\r\n\"Hermit, could you prevent a Frankish king from being born a rapacious\r\nthief?\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be prevented from being born king, duke, count or seigneur, and\r\ntaught that he is not the master of the life and goods of other human\r\nbeings. Jesus of Nazareth said it: we are all equal. From the equality\r\nof men their fraternity will one day be born. To each his part in the\r\ncommon heritage. Propagate that doctrine among your brothers, and the\r\nend will be reached without the spilling of blood.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this the hermit-laborer relapsed into his previous silent revery.\r\n\r\n\"Twice have I camped on the trail of that last king of Auvergne--king by\r\nthe grace of pillage and massacre,\" said Ronan, \"and both times I failed\r\nto catch him. But, by Rita-Gaur, if ever Clotaire falls into my hands, I\r\nshall shave him--and so close to his shoulders that his head will never\r\nmore grow again--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, you reckon without the demonstration of rhetoric. I have\r\nestablished the premises, let us now draw the conclusions. Therefore,\r\n_logice_, I shall prove to you that naught will avail you against\r\nClotaire. The Lord protects him. Yes, the Lord has performed a miracle\r\nin favor of Clotaire, the butcher of children. Consequently, I was right\r\nwhen I said that I shall prove _logice_ that the Lord will surely\r\nperform some miracle in our own favor, in favor of the good Vagres--\"\r\n\r\n\"We were decidedly wrong in not hanging the bishop!\"\r\n\r\n\"It will always be time to draw the Lord's attention upon as by some\r\nsuch pious deed. But tell us the miracle, learned Symphorien.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was in the year 537, about four years after Childebert and Clotaire\r\nstabbed their little nephews to death. Our two worthy sons of the stock\r\nof Clovis had no thought but of how to plunder and despatch each other.\r\nAccordingly, although united for a moment like loving brothers in the\r\nassassination of the two boys, Clotaire and Childebert declared war\r\nagainst each other. Theudebert, one of Clovis' grandchildren, joined\r\nChildebert; the two placed themselves at the head of their leudes, and,\r\nas was their wont, pillaged and laid waste the countries that they\r\ncrossed, and marched against Clotaire. The good uncle did not consider\r\nhis own forces strong enough to make head against the joint troops of\r\nhis brother and his nephew; he declined battle and withdrew to the\r\nforest of Brotonne, between Rouen and the sea. Theudebert and\r\nChildebert girdled the forest, and quietly awaited the night, confident\r\nof catching the beloved brother and uncle in the net. In pursuit of\r\ntheir plan, Childebert and Theudebert advanced noiselessly at the head\r\nof their troops. The sun was rising. They had arrived to within two or\r\nthree hundred paces from the spot where Clotaire was encamped with his\r\nleudes, when suddenly a frightful hailstorm of stones and fire dropped\r\ndown from the sky. The troops of Childebert and Theudebert were crushed\r\nby the stones and consumed by the heavenly fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what became of Clotaire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Clotaire, the favorite of the Lord, as the miracle proved, saw the\r\ntroops of his brother and nephew annihilated only a few paces from him\r\nby the stones and fire that rained down from the sky, while over his own\r\nhead, the sky, as pure, limpid and serene as his own conscience, was of\r\na smiling blue. Not even a breath of wind agitated the tops of the trees\r\nin the forest, while all around there was a cataract of fire. And\r\nthereupon a further shower of stones dropped down from the bosom of the\r\nclouds, and buried all the enemies of Clotaire.\"\r\n\r\nSymphorien stopped for a moment to contemplate the effect of the miracle\r\non his audience and then proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"And above all, you must not fail to observe that the account of the\r\nmiracle expressly states that it was the great St. Martin himself, who,\r\nin paradise, prayed to the Lord that he give such a token of friendship\r\nfor Clotaire. Now, then, St. Martin did not intercede with the Lord on\r\nbehalf of the felonious Clotaire, but at the fervent prayer of Queen\r\nClotilde.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! The grandmother of the two poor little victims of that monster of\r\na Clotaire?\" exclaimed little Odille clasping her hands. \"She prayed for\r\na miracle in favor of the murderer of her two grandsons?\"\r\n\r\n\"My Vagre,\" put in at this juncture the bishopess passing her slender\r\nfingers through the waivy hair of the young man, and placing her lips\r\nupon her lover's mouth, \"is it not better to proceed to yonder worlds\r\nthan to remain and live in this world of horrors?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, horrible--horrible is this world,\" cried the hermit-laborer with\r\nprofound grief and indignation. \"Oh! To see the name of that God of\r\nmercy, of love and of justice thus profaned and daily soiled! Oh! To see\r\nthese crimes, that cause nature to shudder, placed under divine\r\nprotection! Oh, Jesus! Jesus of Nazareth! You the divinest of all sages,\r\nyou did foresee that your Church would be ill-understood, when, with\r\nyour spirit, afflicted unto death, you did, in your last and supreme\r\nwatch, weep over the approaching future of the world! Jesus! Jesus!\r\nCenturies must elapse before your day shall arrive!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be careful, friend!\" said Ronan, \"speak not so loud. Yonder holy man of\r\na bishop, who sleeps not far from you, gorged with wine and meat, might\r\nexcommunicate you if he heard you! But to the devil with sadness! We\r\nlive in damnable days--let us live like the damned! Up, my Vagres, up!\r\nYou are thrice holy! Let our Saturnalia cover all Gaul--let this land of\r\nour fathers be the grave of the Franks, even if it has to be the grave\r\nof ourselves. The ruins of our deserted cities will tell future\r\ncenturies: 'Here lies a great people! Free, it was the pride of the\r\nworld; enslaved by conquering kings, it one day knew how to vanish from\r\nthe world as it dragged its tyrants with it into the abyss!' So, then,\r\nlet us die rejoicing. Up, my Vagres and Vagresses--let us dance and make\r\nlove until dawn! Let the Franks tremble in their burgs at our daring\r\nsongs! Let bishops flee for refuge in their basilicas! Let them all\r\nwhisper affrighted to one another: 'Woe is us! Woe is us to-morrow! They\r\nare feeling very happy to-night in Vagrery!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Vagres and Vagresses screamed, and sang, and shouted. Wildly\r\nthey tumbled about, and started a giddy reel upon the sward by the pale\r\nillumination of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nLOYSIK AND RONAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWrapped in silence the hermit-laborer had listened to the conversation\r\nof the Vagres. Seated beside little Odille, he seemed to shield her with\r\na paternal protection. The child seemed a stranger to what happened\r\naround her. When at the close of the repast Ronan gave his companions\r\nthe signal for the songs and dance, they ran away tumultuously from the\r\nplace of the recent banquet to give a loose to their bacchic gayety and\r\nindulge in a giddy dance on the sward of another and nearby clearing.\r\n\r\nApproaching the hermit-laborer and the little girl, both of whom had\r\nkept their places as they gazed up at the sky, Ronan said to her in a\r\nmerry voice:\r\n\r\n\"Will you dance, little Odille? The reel is started; it will last until\r\ndawn.\"\r\n\r\nThe young girl shook her head melancholically, made no answer, and\r\ncontinued to gaze at the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Odille, what is it you are dreaming about as you gaze at the moon?\r\nWhither do your thoughts fly, my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sleep is overpowering me, and my thoughts are running over an old druid\r\nchant that my mother used to sing to me, to rock me asleep when I was\r\nlittle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What chant was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! It is old, very, very old--my mother used to tell me. It has been\r\nsung in Gaul for over five or six hundred years.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is its name?\"\r\n\r\n\"The chant of Hena, the Virgin of the Isle of Sen.\"\r\n\r\n\"The chant of Hena!\" cried the Vagre and the hermit simultaneously with\r\na tremor of delight.\r\n\r\nBoth grew immediately silent, while Odille, astonished at their visible\r\nemotion, looked from the one to the other, and asked:\r\n\r\n\"You also seem to know the chant of Hena?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sing it, my child,\" answered Ronan in a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\nMore and more astonished, little Odille was hardly able to recognize her\r\nfriend. The dare-devil and merry Vagre had become pensive and grave.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, my child! Recite that chant to us with your sweet voice of\r\nfifteen years,\" put in the hermit. \"But not here--the dance and yonder\r\nwild carousal, although far enough away, would drown your voice--\"\r\n\r\n\"The hermit is right. Come with us, little Odille, to yonder large oak.\r\nIt will be far enough away from the dancers. It is surrounded by a soft\r\nmoss carpet. You will be able to sleep there. I shall cover you up with\r\nmy cloak to protect you from the damp.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foot of the oak tree where the girl took her seat between Ronan\r\nand the hermit, only the dim noise was heard of the giddy dance and\r\nsongs of Ronan's companions, the Vagres and Vagresses. The moon, now on\r\nher decline, shed her silvery rays under the somber verdure of the\r\nleaves and lighted the hermit, Ronan and the young slave as if the sun\r\nshone through the trees. The child-like voice of Odille was soon heard\r\nstriking up the first couplet of the chant:\r\n\r\n\"She was young, she was fair, and holy was she; Hena her name, Hena the\r\nmaid of the Island of Sen.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words both the hermit and the Vagre lowered their heads, and\r\nwithout noticing the tears that the other was shedding, both wept.\r\nOdille sang the second couplet, but broken with the fatigue of the last\r\ntwenty-four hours, and yielding to the influence of the chant's\r\nmelancholy rhythm, that so often had lulled and rocked her to sleep on\r\nher mother's knees, the little slave's voice became fainter and fainter,\r\nwhile, at the distance the Vagres suddenly struck up in chorus and with\r\nresonant voices the refrain of another ancient chant of Gaul. These\r\nlatter accents sent a new thrill through the frames of Ronan and the\r\nhermit. Without wholly drowning Odille's voice, the words reached their\r\nears:\r\n\r\n\"Flow, flow, thou blood of the captive! Drop, drop, thou dew of gore!\r\nGerminate, sprout up, thou avenging harvest!\"\r\n\r\nThe two men seemed struck with the singular coincidence: at a distance,\r\nthe chant of revolt, of war and blood; close to them, the girl's angelic\r\nvoice, singing the praises of Hena, one of the sweetest glories of\r\nArmorican Gaul. Presently, however, as Odille yielded more and more to\r\nthe gentle pressure of slumber, her voice was heard ever fainter until\r\nfrom a murmur, it became hardly audible. The girl's head drooped on her\r\nbreast, and with her back sustained by the trunk of the tree she fell\r\ninto profound sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Poor child!\" said Ronan as he covered her with his cloak. \"She is\r\novercome with fatigue. May her sleep give her rest and strength!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan,\" observed the hermit fastening a penetrating look upon the\r\nVagre, \"the chant of Hena made you weep--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true, good hermit.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the reason of such emotion?\"\r\n\r\n\"A family remembrance--if a Vagre, a 'Wand'ring Man,' a 'Wolf,' a\r\n'Wolf's-Head' can be at all said to have a family--\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that family remembrance?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sweet Hena, to whom the chant refers, was one of my ancestresses.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father often told me so; in my childhood he used to relate to me the\r\nhistories of olden days, of centuries ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is your father now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. He used to run the Bagaudy, perhaps he now runs the\r\nVagrery, unless he has died the brave death of a brave man. I do not\r\nexpect to be enlightened upon that until he and I meet again\r\nelsewhere--\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"In those mysterious worlds that none knows and that we shall all\r\nknow--seeing that we shall all continue to live there--\"\r\n\r\n\"You have, then, preserved the faith of our ancestors?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father taught me that to die was to change vestments, because we\r\nleave this world to be re-born in yonder ones. Death is but a\r\ntransformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it long since you were separated from your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us drop that subject--it is a sad one. I prefer to keep up a\r\ncheerful mood. And yet, I feel drawn towards you, although you are not\r\ncheerful--\"\r\n\r\n\"We live in days when, in order to be cheerful, one's soul must be\r\neither very weak or very strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think me weak?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are both strong and weak. But as to your father--what has\r\nbecome of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my father was a Bagauder in his youth; later, after the Franks\r\nchristened us 'Vagres,' he became a Vagre. The name was changed, the\r\npursuit remained the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Vagrery one knows but little of his mother. I never knew mine. The\r\nfurthest back that I can carry my memory, I must have been seven or\r\neight years old. I then accompanied my father in his raids, now in\r\nProvence, and now here in Auvergne. If I was tired of foot, either my\r\nfather or one of his companions carried me on his back. It is thus that\r\nI grew up. We often had days of enforced rest. Sometimes the Frankish\r\ncounts were so exasperated at us that they gathered their leudes and\r\nhunted us. Informed of their movements by the poor folks of the fields\r\nwho loved us dearly, we would then retire to our inaccessible\r\nfastnesses, and there lie low for several days while the Franks beat the\r\nfield without encountering even the shadow of a Vagre. At such intervals\r\nof rest in the seclusion of some solitary retreat, my father used to\r\nnarrate to me, as I told you, the histories of olden days. Thus I\r\nlearned that our family originated in Britanny, where the main stock\r\nlived and perhaps still lives to this very hour, free and in peace,\r\nseeing that the Franks have never yet been able to place their yoke upon\r\nthat rugged province--its granite rocks are too hard, and its Bretons\r\nare like the granite of its rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the saying: 'He is intractable as an Armorican.'\"\r\n\r\n\"My father often used the saying.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what induced him to leave that peaceful province, that still enjoys\r\nthe boon of freedom, thanks to the indomitable bravery that continues to\r\nuphold the druid faith, which the evangelical morality of the young\r\nmaster of Nazareth has regenerated?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father was about seventeen years of age when one day his family\r\nextended hospitality to a peddler during a stormy night. The peddler's\r\ntrade took him all over Gaul; he knew and he told them of the country's\r\ntrials; he also spoke of the life of adventure led by the Bagauders. My\r\nfather was tired of the life of the fields; his heart was warm, and from\r\nhis cradle he had drunk in the hatred for the Franks. Struck by the\r\npeddler's account, he considered the opportunity good for waging war\r\nupon the barbarians by joining the Bagauders. He left the paternal roof\r\nand joined the peddler by appointment about a league away. After a few\r\ndays' march the two reached Anjou and met a troop of Bagauders. Young,\r\nrobust and daring, my father was an acceptable recruit. He joined the\r\nband, and--long live the Bagaudy! Raiding from province to province, he\r\ncame as far as Auvergne, which he never left. The country was favorable\r\nfor his pursuit--forests, mountains, rocks, caverns, torrents, extinct\r\nvolcanos! It is the paradise of the Bagaudy, the promised land of the\r\nVagrery!\"\r\n\r\n\"How came you to be separated from your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was about three years ago--agents of the king, they were called\r\n_antrustions_, collected the revenues of the royal domain. They were\r\nnumerous, well armed, and traveled only by day. We were waiting for the\r\nend of their reaping to gather in our harvest. One night they halted at\r\nSifour, a little unprotected village. The opportunity tempted my father.\r\nWe sallied forth believing that we would take the Franks by surprise.\r\nThey were on their guard. After a bloody encounter we had to flee before\r\nthe Frankish lances that followed us in hot pursuit. I was separated\r\nfrom my father during that midnight affray. Was he killed or was he\r\nmerely wounded and taken prisoner I do not know. All my efforts to\r\nascertain his fate have been vain. Since then my companions elected me\r\ntheir chief. You wanted to know my history--I have told it to you. You\r\nnow know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have told me more than you think for. Your father's name was\r\nKaradeucq.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The name of your father's father was Jocelyn. If he still lives in\r\nBritanny with his elder son Kervan and his daughter Roselyk, he must be\r\ninhabiting a house near the sacred stones of Karnak--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you--\"\r\n\r\n\"One of your ancestors was named Joel; he was the brenn of the tribe of\r\nKarnak. Hena, the saint sung about in the druid chant, was the daughter\r\nof Joel, whose family traces its origin back to the Gallic brenn, whom\r\nthe Romans called Brennus, and who, nearly eight hundred years ago, made\r\nthem pay ransom for Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you that you know the history of my family so accurately?\"\r\n\r\n\"That chant of the slaves in revolt against the Romans--'Flow, flow,\r\nthou blood of the captive! Drop, drop, thou dew of gore!'--was sung by\r\none of your ancestors named Sylvest, who was cast to the wild beasts in\r\nthe circus of Orange. And I imagine that your father taught you another\r\nthrilling chant, one sung two hundred and odd years ago, on the occasion\r\nof one of the great battles fought on the Rhine against the Franks, and\r\nwon by Victorin, the son of Victoria, the Mother of the Camps--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right--often did my father sing that chant to me. It began this\r\nwise:\r\n\r\n\"'This morning we said: How many are there of these barbarous hordes?\r\nHow many are there of these Franks?'\"\r\n\r\n\"And it closed this wise,\" replied the monk:\r\n\r\n\"'This evening we say: How many were there of these barbarous hordes?\r\nThis evening we say: How many were there of these Franks?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Schanvoch, another of your ancestors, a brave soldier and\r\nfoster-brother of Victoria the Great, sang that song--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Gaul, on that day proud, free and triumphant, had just driven the\r\nbarbarians from both banks of the Rhine, while, to-day--but let us drop\r\nthat topic, monk; if those days were glorious, the present ones seem to\r\nme all the more horrible. Oh! blameworthy was the credulity of our\r\nfathers, martyrs to this new religion--\"\r\n\r\n\"Our fathers could not choose but place faith in the words of the first\r\napostles, who preached to them love for their fellow men, the pardon of\r\nsins, the deliverance of the slaves, in the name of the young master of\r\nNazareth, whom your ancestress Genevieve saw crucified in Jerusalem--\"\r\n\r\n\"My ancestress Genevieve? You seem to be informed on every particular\r\ndetail concerning my family. Only my father could have instructed you on\r\nsuch matters--you must have known him! Answer me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I knew your father. Did you never notice, after you entered the\r\nheart of Auvergne, that from time to time your father absented himself\r\nfor several days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he did--I never knew the reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father, each such time, went to visit a poor female slave near\r\nTulle. She was bound to the glebe of the bishop of that city. That\r\nfemale slave, it is now at least thirty years ago, one day found your\r\nfather Karadeucq, who was then the chief of the Bagauders, wounded and\r\nin a dying condition in a hedge along the road. She took pity upon him;\r\nshe helped him to drag himself to the hut which she inhabited with her\r\nmother. Your father was then about twenty years of age--the young female\r\nslave was of about the age of that child who is asleep near us. The two\r\nloved each other. Shortly after he was well again, your father was one\r\nday discovered in the slave's hut by the bishop's superintendent. The\r\nman considered Karadeucq a good prize and sought to take him as a slave\r\nto Tulle. Your father resisted, beat the agent, and fled and rejoined\r\nthe Bagauders. The young slave became a mother--she gave birth to a\r\nson--\"\r\n\r\n\"I then have a brother!\"\r\n\r\n\"The son of a female slave is born a slave and belongs to his mother's\r\nmaster. When the boy, whom your father named Loysik in remembrance of\r\nhis Breton extraction, was four or five years old, the bishop of Tulle,\r\nwho had noticed in the child certain precocious qualities, had him taken\r\nto the episcopal college, where he was brought up with several other\r\nyoung slaves who were all to become clerks of the Church. From time to\r\ntime Karadeucq went at night to visit the mother of his son at Tulle.\r\nThe boy being always notified in advance by his mother, always found\r\nsome means of repairing to his mother's hut on such occasions. There the\r\nfather and the son held long conversations concerning the men and things\r\nof the olden days of Gaul when the country was glorious and free. Your\r\nfather preserved as a family tradition an ardent and sacred love for\r\nGaul. He strove to cause his son's heart to beat proudly at the grand\r\nrecollections of the past, to exasperate him against the Franks, and\r\nsome day to take him along to run the Vagrery with him. But Loysik, who\r\nwas of a quiet and rather retiring disposition, feared such an\r\nadventurous life. Years passed. Had your brother so desired, he could\r\nhave won honors and riches, as so many others did, by consecrating\r\nhimself to the Church. But shortly before being ordained a priest, he\r\nhad the opportunity of gaining so close a view of the clerical\r\nhypocrisy, cupidity and profligacy, that he declined to enter priesthood\r\nand he cursed the sacrilegious alliance of the Gallic clergy with the\r\nconquerors. He left the episcopal house and went to the frontier of\r\nProvence, where he joined the hermit-laborers. He was previously\r\nacquainted with one of their set, who had stopped for several weeks at\r\nthe episcopal alms-house for his cure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the hermit-laborers establish a colony?\"\r\n\r\n\"Several of them gathered in a secluded spot to cultivate the lands that\r\nhad been laid waste and were abandoned since the conquest. They were\r\nplain and good men, faithful to the recollections of old Gaul and to the\r\nprecepts of the gospels. Those monks lived in celibacy, but took no\r\nvows. They remained lay, and had no clerical character. It is only since\r\nrecent years that most of those monks have begun entering the Church.\r\nBut having become priests, they are daily losing the popular esteem that\r\nthey once enjoyed, and the independence of character that rendered them\r\nso redoubtable to the bishops. At the time that I am speaking of, the\r\nlife of those hermit-laborers was peaceful and industrious. They lived\r\nlike brothers, obedient to the precepts of Jesus; they cultivated their\r\nlands in common; and they jointly and forcibly defended them whenever\r\nsome band of Franks, on the way from some burg to another, took it into\r\ntheir heads, out of sheer wantonness, to injure the fields or crops of\r\nthe monks--\"\r\n\r\n\"I must say that I love those hermits, who are at once husbandmen and\r\nsoldiers, who are faithful to the precepts of Jesus, to the love for old\r\nGaul, and to horror for the Franks. You say that those monks fought\r\nwell--were they armed?\"\r\n\r\n\"They had arms--and better than arms. See here,\" said the hermit drawing\r\nfrom under his robe a species of short sword or long poniard with an\r\niron hilt; \"observe this weapon carefully. Its strength does not lie in\r\nits blade but in the words engraven on the hilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Ronan, \"on one of the sides of the guard, the word _ghilde_,\r\nand on the other side two Gallic words--_friendship_--_community_. I\r\nsuppose these are the device of the hermit-laborers? But what does the\r\nword _ghilde_ mean? That is not a Gallic word. It is unknown to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a Saxon word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! It is a word from the language of the pirates who come down from\r\nthe seas of the North, skirt the coasts, and often ascend the Loire in\r\norder to plunder the bordering lands. They are fearful marauders, but\r\nintrepid seamen! Think of their coming over sea from distant shores, in\r\nmere canoes, that are so frail and light that, at a pinch, they are\r\ncarried on their backs. It is said that they have ascended the Loire\r\nmore than once as far as Tours.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is true. And thus Gaul is to-day the prey of barbarians from\r\nwithin and from without. She is at the mercy of the Franks and the\r\nSaxons!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can that Saxon word _ghilde_, engraven on the iron impart\r\nstrength to the weapon, as you tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall explain the secret to you. One of the monk-laborers lived on\r\nthe border of the Loire before he joined us. Being carried away by the\r\npirates at one of their raids in Touraine, when he was still in his\r\nearly infancy, he was brought up in their country. During his sojourn\r\namong them, he noticed that those men of the North drew immense strength\r\nfrom certain associations in which each owed solidarity to all, and all\r\nto each--solidarity in fraternity, in assistance, in goods, in arms and\r\nin life. These associations are generally believed to have sprung up\r\nfrom Christian fraternity; the fact is that they were in practice in\r\nthose Northern regions many a century before the birth of Jesus, and\r\nthey were called _ghildes_. Later the prisoner of the pirates succeeded\r\nin making his escape, reentered Gaul, joined us hermit-laborers--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you break off?\"\r\n\r\n\"An oath that I have taken forbids me to say more--\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall respect your secret. But the confidence, with which I seem to\r\ninspire you, you also inspire in me. My brother, you said to me, was of\r\nthe number of the hermit-laborers with whom you are associated. You must\r\nhave known him intimately. Only he could have furnished you with the\r\ndetails concerning the family of Joel which he doubtlessly received from\r\nhis own father. Why do you look at me so fixedly? Your silence\r\ndisconcerts and moves me--your eyes are filling with tears--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, your brother was born thirty years ago--that is my age. Your\r\nbrother's name is Loysik--that is my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Loysik! My brother!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I. Did you not surmise as much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Joy of heavens! You are my brother!\"\r\n\r\nLong did the hermit and the Vagre remain in close embrace. After the\r\nfirst ebullition of their tender joy, Ronan said to Loysik:\r\n\r\n\"And whatever became of our father?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not his fate--but let us trust in the goodness of God--let us\r\nnot despair of some day finding him again--\"\r\n\r\n\"And was it your brother's instinct that led you to accompany us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not suspect you of being my brother until I noticed the degree to\r\nwhich you were moved by the chant of Hena. When you told me she was one\r\nof your ancestresses, I no longer entertained any doubt but that we were\r\neither brothers or close relatives. The account of your life proved to\r\nme that we were brothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why, then, did you follow us in Vagrery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not hear my answer to Bishop Cautin: 'It is not the well but\r\nthe sick who stand in need of the physician?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you blame me for being a Vagre, and would you blame our father\r\nfor having been a Bagauder?\"\r\n\r\n\"No less than you, Ronan, do I hold slavery and conquest in horror,\r\nseeing that Gaul, formerly powerful and teeming with happiness, is\r\ncovered with ruins and brambles since the Frankish invasion.\r\nProprietors, colonists, husbandmen have all fled before the barbarians\r\nwho reduce them to slavery, or cause them to die of hunger by reason of\r\nthe frightful floods of famine that have followed in the wake of the\r\ninvading army. Driven by despair large numbers of those unhappy people\r\nrun the Vagrery like yourself. Only slaves are seen here and there\r\ncultivating the lands of the Church and of the seigneurs, and the poor\r\nwretches bend under the weight of toil; not infrequently die of hunger\r\nor of maltreatment. The cities, once so rich, so flourishing by their\r\ncommerce, are to-day ruined, almost depopulated, but being at least\r\ndefended by their walls, they offer some measure of security to their\r\ninhabitants; and yet, the ceaseless civil wars between the sons of\r\nClovis at times deliver even these places to the torch of the\r\nincendiary, to pillage and to massacre. During the fitful lulls of these\r\nfeuds, the inhabitants hardly dare to leave their walls; the roads,\r\ninfested with armed bands, render communication and traffic impossible.\r\nBut too often the horrors of famine have decimated the population of\r\nwhole cities. Alas! Such is the sad plight of our country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, that is what the Frankish conquest has done for Gaul. She can no\r\nlonger be free--let her disappear from the world burying the conquerors\r\nand the conquered alike under her ruins!\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother, is not this Gaul that you lay waste with as much\r\ninveterateness as the conquerors themselves, is she not our dearly\r\nbeloved country, our mother? Is it for us, her children, to join hands\r\nwith the barbarians in whelming her with sorrows and trials? Like\r\nyourself, I wish to labor for the overthrow of barbarism; like yourself\r\nI wish to put an end to the craven besottedness of the oppressed; but I\r\nwish to destroy barbarism with civilization, ignorance with\r\nenlightenment, poverty with labor, slavery with the sense of national\r\nworth--a sense, alas! now almost wholly uprooted, and yet once so\r\npowerful, in the days of our fathers, when our venerated druids aroused\r\nthe peoples to arms against the Romans. Holy insurrections!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tracked by the bishops, our last druids have died upon the scaffold!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the druid faith is not dead! No--no! The forms of religions pass,\r\nbut their divine principle remains for all time. Revived, stimulated and\r\nregenerated by the gentle morality of Jesus, the druid faith is born\r\nanew in our breasts. It has preserved its belief in the immortality of\r\nthe soul of men, in their successive re-incarnation in the starry world,\r\nto the end that by fresh trials and sufferings the wicked may become\r\ngood, and the just still more perfect. Aye, humanity, whether visible or\r\ninvisible, must rise from sphere to sphere in its eternal effort, in its\r\ncontinuous progress, towards infinite perfection. Such is our faith, the\r\nfaith of us Christian druids, who practice the evangelical doctrine in\r\nall that it contains of tenderness, mercifulness, and the love of\r\nfreedom--\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Loysik was suddenly interrupted by a voice that proceeded\r\nfrom a bush near the oak tree, shouting:\r\n\r\n\"Relapsed! Sacrilegious wretch! Worshiper of Mammon! Hermit of the\r\ndevil! Prop of Beelzebub! You shall be burned for a heretic!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of Bishop Cautin. And almost at the same instant, from\r\nafar, from the side where the Vagres were finishing their night of\r\nwassail, these other cries were heard through the stillness of the\r\napproaching dawn:\r\n\r\n\"On guard! On guard! The leudes of Count Neroweg are approaching! The\r\ncount himself is at their head!\"\r\n\r\n\"On guard! The leudes of Count Neroweg are approaching! To arms! To\r\narms!\"\r\n\r\nAwakened from her restful sleep by the tumult and hearing the cries of\r\nthe Vagres, little Odille screamed with terror as she threw herself on\r\nthe neck of Ronan:\r\n\r\n\"Count Neroweg! Save me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, poor child!\"\r\n\r\nAnd addressing Loysik, Ronan added:\r\n\r\n\"Brother, fate sends to us a descendant of that family of Neroweg, whom\r\nour ancestor Schanvoch fought two centuries ago on the borders of the\r\nRhine. I wish to kill that barbarian, rid Gaul of him, and protect our\r\nown family from the peril of his descendants--\"\r\n\r\n\"Kill me!\" murmured Odille, falling on her knees before the Vagre and\r\nclasping her hands. \"I prefer to die at your hands rather than to fall\r\nback into the hands of the count--\"\r\n\r\nTouched by the girl's despair and of course unable to foresee the issue\r\nof the pending combat, Ronan remained pensive for a moment. He looked\r\naround. His eyes fell upon a spreading branch of the oak tree near which\r\nthey stood. He leaped up, seized it, and bending it down said to his\r\nbrother:\r\n\r\n\"Loysik, sit Odille on this branch; when it straightens up again it will\r\ncarry the poor child up; she will then be able to reach the thicker\r\nfoliage, and keep herself concealed until the end of the combat. I shall\r\nforthwith assemble the Vagres. Courage, little Odille, I shall return\r\nafter the battle--\"\r\n\r\nAnd he ran towards his companions, while the slave, whom Loysik had\r\nplaced upon the branch, disappeared in the midst of the thick foliage\r\nwaving her hands at Ronan.\r\n\r\nDawn was lighting the forest. The tops of the trees were crimsoned with\r\nthe first fires of the orb of day. The Vagres, who just announced the\r\napproach of Count Neroweg and his leudes, had taken a path across the\r\nthicket that was impracticable for the horses of the Franks, a good deal\r\nshorter than the road that these were obliged to take in order to arrive\r\nat the clearing where the Vagres had halted for the night. The larger\r\nnumber of the Vagres being in their cups and exhausted with singing and\r\ndancing, were asleep on the lawn. Awakened with a start by the cries of\r\nthe outposts, they rushed to their arms. The slaves, the colonists, the\r\nwomen, the ruined proprietors, who joined the Vagres on the previous day\r\nwere differently affected at the tidings of the approach of the leudes.\r\nSome trembled from head to foot; others fled into the thickest of the\r\nforest; still others, a goodly number, preserved their courage, and\r\nhastily sought for means of the defense. In default of better weapons\r\nthey supplied themselves with heavy knotted staves that they cut from\r\nthe trees. The Vagres themselves numbered about a dozen excellent\r\narchers, others were armed with axes, iron maces, pikes, swords and\r\nscythes with the blades turned outward. At the first cry of alarm, the\r\nbrave fellows gathered around Ronan and the hermit. Should battle be\r\nengaged with the leudes? Was it better to flee before them and await a\r\nbetter opportunity for an offensive stroke? Only few were for flight;\r\nthe majority favored immediate battle.\r\n\r\nWhile the council of war was being held two other pickets rushed to the\r\nclearing. They had concealed themselves in the underwood, and had been\r\nable to count with approximate accuracy the number of leudes whom the\r\ncount led. There were barely a score on horseback; they were well armed;\r\nbut fully a hundred foot soldiers followed these and were armed with\r\npikes and clubs. Some were Franks, others were from the city of\r\nClermont, whom the count requisitioned in the name of the King for the\r\npursuit of the Vagres. Several of Bishop Cautin's slaves, who, out of\r\nfear of hell fire, did not wish to run the Vagrery after the burning of\r\nthe episcopal villa, swelled the foot soldiers of Count Neroweg. Ronan's\r\ntroop numbered at most a score of men.\r\n\r\nThe council of war decided to engage in a general battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE MIRACLE OF ST. CAUTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is half an hour since the approach of Count Neroweg and his leudes\r\nwas announced by the pickets. The Vagres have disappeared. There remains\r\nin the clearing where they feasted during the night naught but the\r\nremains and evidences of their sumptuous banquet on the lawn--empty wine\r\npouches, gold and silver goblets strewn over the grassy and trampled\r\nground; not far away stand the wagons that were brought from the\r\nepiscopal villa, and further off the carcasses of the oxen lying near\r\nthe still smouldering bake-oven. The silence in the forest is profound.\r\nPresently, one of the slaves of the villa, one of the pious guides of\r\nthe leudes, emerges from the thicket that surrounds the clearing. He\r\nsteps forward diffidently, listens and looks around as if apprehensive\r\nof an ambuscade. At the sight of the evidences of the feast that lie\r\nstrewn about, he seems astonished and quickly turns around. Doubtlessly\r\nhis first impulse is to return to the troop which he precedes, but as\r\nhis eyes fall that instant upon the gold and silver vases that lie upon\r\nthe grass, he stops, turns back, runs to the booty, snatches up a gold\r\nchalice and as quickly hides it under his rags. He thereupon lifts up\r\nhis voice and calls to the leudes.\r\n\r\nA distant and steadily approaching noise is heard in the woods. The\r\nbushes break down before the chests and under the iron hoofs of the\r\nhorses. Voices call and answer. Finally Count Neroweg breaks through the\r\nthicket. He is on horseback and closely followed by several leudes. Most\r\nof his troop, as well as the footmen, being less impetuous than himself,\r\nfollow at safer distance through the hedges on the way to join their\r\nmaster. Neroweg had expected to fall unperceived upon the Vagres. There\r\nwas, however, not a soul in sight except the slave who now ran towards\r\nhim crying:\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, the impious Vagres who sacked the villa of our holy bishop\r\nhave fled into the forest.\"\r\n\r\nNeroweg raised his long sword and with one blow cut off the slave's\r\nhead:\r\n\r\n\"Dog! You deceived me! You were in conspiracy with the Vagres!\"\r\n\r\nThe slave's lifeless body sank to the ground, and the hidden gold\r\nchalice rolled over the grass.\r\n\r\n\"That gold vase is mine!\" cried the count pointing at the chalice with\r\nhis sword to one of his men who followed him on foot. \"Karl, put that\r\ninto your bag--\"\r\n\r\nThese thieves always had close to their heels several men with bags\r\nready for booty. But just as Karl was about to follow his master's\r\norders, the latter's eyes fell upon the other articles of gold and\r\nsilver that were taken from the episcopal villa and which now glistened\r\nattractively in the filtering rays of the rising sun. Neroweg put the\r\nspurs to his horse, and bounding forward cried:\r\n\r\n\"Those treasures are mine! Fill up your bag, Karl. Call Rigomer and have\r\nhim fill his bag with all that it can contain!\"\r\n\r\n\"The booty is not all for you alone, we have our share!\" cried the\r\nleudes who now entered upon the clearing. \"All these treasures must be\r\ndivided alike--we are your equals!\"\r\n\r\n\"We are equals in battle--equals also in the dividing of the booty--it\r\nis but fair--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you forget that at the pillage of Soissons even the great Clovis\r\nhimself did not dare to dispute a gold vase with one of his warriors?\"\r\n\r\n\"These treasures are ours as much as yours--we shall divide on the\r\nspot--\"\r\n\r\nThe count did not dare resist the demands of his leudes. Although these\r\nwarriors ever recognized him as their chief, they likewise ever treated\r\nhim as their equal. Several of the plunderers now alighted from their\r\nhorses and cast covetous glances at the chalices, their covers and other\r\narticles of the Church, together with the goblets, dishes, bowls and\r\nmany other gold and silver utensils. Carried away by their greed, the\r\nleudes precipitated themselves upon the treasures, pushing and shoving\r\none another, and were in the act of reaching out their hands to snatch\r\nup the precious goods, when a loud voice, that seemed to descend from\r\nthe heavens above, thundered down upon them:\r\n\r\n\"Hands off, sacrilegious men! God hears you! God sees you! If you dare\r\nto reach out impious hands at the goods of the Church you will be damned\r\nforever!\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the voice that seemed to come from heaven Neroweg grew\r\npale, trembled at every limb, dropped from his horse and fell upon his\r\nknees. Several of the leudes followed his example and humbly prostrated\r\nthemselves. They were terror-stricken!\r\n\r\n\"All on your knees, pagans that you are!\" proceeded the voice in still\r\nmore threatening accents. \"All down on your knees! Accursed pillagers of\r\nthe Church!\"\r\n\r\nThe last of the leudes who still remained on their feet dropped\r\ndistractedly on their knees, and with them the rest of the troop that\r\nfollowed on foot and were now upon the scene. The affrighted crowd bowed\r\ntheir heads to earth and smote their chests murmuring:\r\n\r\n\"A miracle! A miracle! It is the voice of the Lord!\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, ye miserable sinners,\" the voice from above proceeded to\r\nthunder in tones increasingly wrathful, \"now that you have bowed down to\r\nearth before the eye of the Lord and have attested your fear of His\r\nwrath, rise and hasten to help His servant who--\"\r\n\r\nThe voice suddenly stopped short; the branches of a tall oak, near which\r\nNeroweg and his leudes lay upon their knees, bent and cracked under the\r\nweight of a heavy body that was rolling down, and thus broke its fall as\r\nit landed upon the ground, but so near to the count that the latter\r\nnarrowly escaped being crushed by it. This additional phenomenon added\r\nto the terror of Neroweg and his leudes; the whole troop threw\r\nthemselves down flat upon their faces and murmured in their fright:\r\n\r\n\"Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Have mercy upon us! Oh Lord, turn Your wrath from\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\nAnd what was it that actually tumbled down from the tree? It was Bishop\r\nCautin, and his was the voice that had sounded from on high. Just before\r\nthe arrival of the Franks, Ronan had pricked the holy man with the point\r\nof his sword, and forced him to clamber up the tree before him and keep\r\nhimself there like a fat dormouse. Ronan accompanied the holy man up the\r\ntree, and with the point of his sword drove him to speak in the name of\r\nthe Lord. Ronan's purpose was served so long as the holy man limited\r\nhimself to throwing Neroweg and his leudes into consternation, but as\r\nsoon as the bishop evinced an inclination to call them to his aid, the\r\nVagre seized him. The sudden move choked off Cautin's sentence before he\r\nfinished, the rotund and heavy bishop slipped, and tumbling down from\r\nbranch to branch fell almost upon the back of the count. But the man of\r\nGod was a wily customer. Although dazed for a moment by his fall, he\r\nquickly profited by the terror in which the Franks and the slaves were\r\nthrown as they lay face down, flat upon the earth. He steadied himself\r\nupon his legs, and rubbed his sore limbs, and puffing his cheeks he\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"Miserable sinners! Adore your holy bishop who redescends from heaven\r\nupon the wings of the Lord's archangels!\"\r\n\r\n\"A miracle!\" again cried the crowd with even intenser unction, and\r\nsmiting their chests with redoubled fervor. \"A miracle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Bishop Cautin, who descends from heaven--protect us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it your voice I hear, holy father?\" queried Neroweg in a subdued\r\nvoice without daring to raise his face from the ground or looking up.\r\n\"Is it your own voice, holy bishop, or is it a snare that Satan spreads\r\nfor us?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is myself--your bishop--to doubt it is sacrilege!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whence come you, good father?\"\r\n\r\n\"I descend from heaven. After the sack of the episcopal villa, and\r\nseeing me carried away a captive by the Vagres--be they forever\r\naccursed!--the Lord sent His exterminating angels to my aid. They were\r\nclad in armor of hyacinthe, and armed with flaming swords. They snatched\r\nme from the hands of the Philistines, took me on their azure wings, and\r\ncarried me to heaven--\"\r\n\r\n\"A miracle!\" cried the entranced crowd in chorus. \"A miracle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our holy bishop has seen the face of the Lord! Hosanna!\"\r\n\r\n\"St. Cautin,\" cried up Neroweg, \"you will protect me, dear patron saint,\r\nmy dear father in Christ! Will you not bless your son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will bless you--provided always you prostrate yourself before\r\nthe bishop of the Lord, and you enrich the Church!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have a chapel built in your honor on this very spot, holy\r\nbishop, in order to glorify this miracle--\"\r\n\r\n\"That is far from enough--no, that is not enough. Listen, count, listen\r\nattentively:\r\n\r\n\"Neroweg and his leudes fled like cowards from the episcopal villa when\r\nit was attacked by the Vagres.\r\n\r\n\"I order that the count relinquish one quarter of his goods to me, the\r\nbishop of Clermont; I order that he rebuild the episcopal villa, which\r\nhe allowed the Vagres to set on fire, and that he richly ornament it.\r\n\r\n\"I furthermore order that Count Neroweg pursue the Vagres without let,\r\nthat he capture and put them to death--all of them, but especially their\r\nchief and a relapsed hermit, a renegade, an idolater who accompanies the\r\naccursed men.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, I order that the count burn to death, over a slow fire, a\r\ncertain Moabite woman, a witch, an infernal wench, who once was bound to\r\nme by the bonds of holy matrimony.\r\n\r\n\"Let Count Neroweg carry out these, my orders; only at that price shall\r\nhis sins be remitted, and on the day of his death I shall admit him into\r\nparadise.\r\n\r\n\"That is the message that the Lord entrusted me to bear to you. Amen!\"\r\n\r\nNeroweg and a few of the leudes rose upon their knees open-mouthed. As\r\nthey did so they perceived two bearded Vagres with their bows between\r\ntheir teeth crawling like serpents along a large branch in order to\r\nreach a spot from which, skilful archers that they were, they could take\r\ndeliberate aim at their foes and nail them to the sod.\r\n\r\n\"Treason!\" cried the count jumping to his feet and pointing to the tree.\r\n\"Treason! The Vagres are there, hidden in the tree branches!\"\r\n\r\nHardly had the count said these words when a volley of arrows flew from\r\nthe tree-top and riddled his troop. Finding themselves discovered, the\r\ndaring Vagres hesitated not one instant to engage in battle. So accurate\r\nwas the aim of the archers that every arrow found its quiver in the\r\nflesh of a foe.\r\n\r\n\"This is for you, Neroweg!\" cried Ronan from the branch on which he was\r\nperched. \"This is for you, the descendant of the Terrible Eagle! There\r\ngoes the Vagre's arrow!\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the arrow's head was flattened out against the iron casque\r\nof the count. The other Vagres who, until now had remained hidden in the\r\nbushes, rushed forward with loud yells and intrepidly attacked the troop\r\nof Neroweg. The combat became general.\r\n\r\nWho were the vanquishers in that combat? The Vagres or the Franks?\r\n\r\nMalediction! After a stubborn struggle, almost all the Vagres were\r\nslain. A few who escaped the sword and others who were too severely\r\nwounded to flee remained prisoners in the hands of Neroweg. Ronan, the\r\nVagre, was among the latter. The superiority of arms prevailed over mere\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nAnd Loysik? And little Odille? And the bishopess?\r\n\r\nAll prisoners--yes, they were all taken to the burg of the Frankish\r\ncount, while Bishop Cautin, carrying with him his gold and silver vases,\r\nregained Clermont followed by a pious crowd of slaves who cried on his\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n\"Glory to our holy bishop! Glory to the blessed Cautin! Hosanna!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTHE BURG OF NEROWEG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nLEUDES AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe burg of Count Neroweg is situated in the center of a space once\r\noccupied by a fortified Roman camp. The structure is reared on a\r\nhighland plateau that dominates a vast forest at its feet. Between the\r\nforest and the burg lies a wide expanse of meadow lands, watered by a\r\nswift-running river. Beyond the forest, far away, the horizon is bounded\r\nby the volcanic mountain peaks of Auvergne. The seigniorial residence\r\nthat shelters the count and his leudes is built after the Germanic\r\nfashion: in lieu of walls stout beams carefully planed and fastened\r\ntogether, rest upon a broad stone foundation. At intervals, and with the\r\nview of steadying the one-foot thick beams, buttresses of masonry rise\r\nfrom the stone foundation up to the roof, which, in turn, is constructed\r\nof oaken shingles and boards, one foot square, laid over each other. The\r\nroofing is both light and proof against the rain. The building is a long\r\nsquare, a wide wooden portico ornaments its front entrance, and it is\r\nsupported on either wing by other structures similarly put together.\r\nThese are thatched and are devoted to the purposes of kitchen,\r\nstorerooms, washhouses, weaving and spinning, shoe-making, tailoring,\r\nand all the other needs of a household. In these wings are also situated\r\nthe kennels, the stables, the perches for the falcons, the pig-sty, the\r\ncattle-sheds, the wine-presses, the brewery, and large outhouses filled\r\nwith fodder for horses and cattle. In the main, or seigniorial building\r\nare also the women's apartments reserved for Godegisele, the fifth wife\r\nof the count, whose second and third wives still live. There Godegisele\r\nspends her days in sadness; she rarely leaves her apartments and plies\r\nher distaff in the midst of her female slaves, who attend to the several\r\nduties of the needle and the spindle or loom. A frame chapel, in which a\r\nclerk, a messmate at the burg, officiates, is connected with the women's\r\napartment, the latter being essentially a lupanar, to which no man save\r\nthe count himself is admitted. There, under the very eyes of his wife,\r\nevery evening after drinking, the count picks out his bed-fellow for the\r\nnight. The leudes distribute themselves promiscuously among the outside\r\nfemale slaves.\r\n\r\nThese vast structures, together with a garden and a spacious tree-girt\r\nyard intended for the military exercises of the leudes and of the foot\r\nsoldiers, all of whom were freemen and Franks, are surrounded by a fosse\r\nand earthworks, the ancient vestiges of the Roman camp which dates from\r\nthe conquest of Julius Caesar. The parapets are considerably impaired by\r\nthe centuries, but they still present a good line of defense. Only one\r\nof the four entrances of the fortified enclosure--facing, as was the\r\ncustom, north, south, east and west--has been preserved. It is the one\r\nfacing south. On that side, a draw-bridge built of rough logs spans the\r\nfosse during the day, in order to afford a passage to man, wagons and\r\nhorses. But, as a means of precaution--the count is diffident and\r\nsuspicious--the bridge is drawn at night by its keeper. The deep fosse,\r\nboggy by reason of the waters that it has drained from time immemorial\r\nand that stagnated in its bed, has so thick a layer of mud at its\r\nbottom, that any one who should attempt to cross the slough would be\r\ncompletely engulfed. At a little distance from the yard and far removed\r\nfrom the main building, but still within the fortified space, stands an\r\n_ergastula_, built, like all Roman structures, of imperishable bricks.\r\nThe _ergastula_ is a sort of deep cave, intended during the Roman\r\nconquest as a lock-up for the slaves who were employed in field labor\r\nand in the building of roads. Ronan, Loysik the hermit-laborer, the\r\nhandsome bishopess, little Odille and several other Vagres, all who had\r\nnot died of their wounds since their capture, have for the last month\r\nbeen imprisoned in the _ergastula_, the jail of the burg, being thrown\r\nthere immediately after the combat in the passage of Allange, where most\r\nof the Vagres lost their lives. The rest fled into the woods.\r\n\r\nCertainly the position of the burg, the noble Frank's den, was well\r\nchosen. The old Roman fortifications place the residence above the\r\ndanger of a sudden attack. On the other hand, is the seigneur count\r\nminded to hunt wild animals, the forest lies so near the burg that\r\nduring the first nights of autumn the loving stags and does can be heard\r\nbelling for one another's company; is he minded to hunt birds on the\r\nwing, the meadows that surround his home offer to the falcons any number\r\nof flocks of partridges, while further away large ponds serve as a\r\nretreat to the herons who, often in their aerial contests with the\r\nfalcons, transfix the latter with their long sharp beaks; finally, is\r\nthe seigneur count minded to fish, his numerous ponds teem with pike,\r\ncarp and lampreys, while azure-backed trout and purple-finned perches\r\nfurrow the limpid streams.\r\n\r\nOh, seigneur Count Neroweg! How sweet it is to you to thus enjoy the\r\ndelights of this land that your kings conquered with their own and the\r\nswords of their leudes! You and your fellows, the new masters of this\r\nsoil that our fathers' labors fecundated, live in idleness and sloth. To\r\ndrink, eat, hunt, play at dice with your leudes, outrage our wives,\r\nsisters and daughters, and then attend church every week--such is the\r\nlife of the Franks who now possess the vast domains that they plundered\r\nus of! Oh, Count Neroweg! How good it feels to inhabit that burg, built\r\nby Gallic slaves who were carried away from their own fields, homes and\r\nfamilies, and who were made to carry on their backs, under the threat of\r\nthe clubs of your warriors, the timber from the woods, the stones from\r\nthe mountain, the sand from the river and the lime from the bowels of\r\nthe earth--after which, streaming with sweat, broken with fatigue, dying\r\nwith hunger, receiving for their only pittance a handful of beans, they\r\nlay down upon the damp ground, their heads barely sheltered with a roof\r\nof rushes! At early dawn the bites of dogs woke up the sluggards--aye,\r\nand those selfsame keepers with sharp fangs, and trained for their\r\noffice by the Franks, accompanied the slaves when they were led to their\r\nwork, hastened their heavy steps when they returned at night bending\r\nunder their heavy loads, and, if ever driven by despair, the Gaul\r\nassayed flight, the intelligent mastiff quickly drove him with its teeth\r\nback to the human flock, just as the butcher's dog drives back to the\r\nfold a recalcitrant ox or ram.\r\n\r\nAnd did those slaves all belong, perchance, to the class of laborers and\r\nartisans, strong, rough men, broken from infancy to hard labor? No, no!\r\nAmong those captives, more than one had been accustomed to comforts,\r\noften to wealth, and were carried away from their cities or fields with\r\nwives, daughters and sons, either at the time of the Frankish conquest,\r\nor later during the civil wars between the sons of Clovis; the women\r\nwere consigned to the lodgings of the female slaves, there to attend to\r\nthe female work of the household and furnish the Franks with subjects\r\nfor debauchery; the men were assigned to hard out-of-door work, to the\r\nbuilding of houses, making of roads or tending the fields. Other slaves,\r\nonce teachers, merchants and even poets, were captured on the roads as\r\nthey traveled in troops from one city to another in pursuit of their\r\nrespective occupations, imagining themselves safe against any attack in\r\nthese days of war, pillage and general devastation.\r\n\r\nAye, slavery thus rendered the rich Gaul, who was ever accustomed to\r\ncomforts, the brother in misery and sorrow of the poor Gaul who\r\npreviously knew what arduous work was. Aye, the woman of white hands and\r\ndelicate complexion was thrown together with the woman whose hands toil\r\nhad roughened and whose complexion the sun had tanned--both were\r\nrendered by slavery sisters in dishonor and shame, and were cast\r\nweeping, or, if they resisted, bleeding into the bed of the Frankish\r\nseigneur, whom, on the Sunday following a Gallic priest would regularly\r\ngive remission for his sins!\r\n\r\nOh, our fathers! Oh, our mothers! By all the sorrows that you underwent!\r\nOh, our brothers and our sisters, by all the sorrows that you now\r\nundergo! Oh, our sons! Oh, our daughters! By the dregs of the cup of\r\nhumiliation and disgrace that you are made to drain! Oh, you all, by the\r\ntears that drop from your eyes, by the laceration of your bodies--you\r\nwill be avenged! You will be avenged upon these abhorred Franks!\r\n\r\nBut let us step into the burg of the seigneur. By the faith of a Vagre!\r\nBy the sweat and the blood of our fathers that have moistened and\r\ncrimsoned every beam, every stone of this structure--it is a\r\ncomfortable, spacious and handsome building, this burg of the seigneur\r\ncount! Twelve well rounded oaken beams support the portico; it leads\r\ndirectly into the _mahl_, as these barbarous chiefs style the tribunal\r\nwhere they dispense their seigniorial justice--a vast, spacious hall, in\r\nthe rear of which, and raised on a platform, is the seat of the count,\r\nand the benches of the leudes who assist him in the ceremony. There he\r\nholds his _mahl_ and judges the crimes committed on his domains. In a\r\ncorner of the room a stove, a rack and pincers are seen--no justice\r\nwithout torture and execution. In yonder opposite corner and even with\r\nthe floor is a wide tank full of water and deep enough for a man to\r\ndrown in. Near the tank lie nine plow-shares. These are all instruments\r\nfor _judicial trials_; they are prescribed by the _Salic Law_, the law\r\nof the Franks, to which Gaul is now subject, seeing the land is in the\r\npower of Frankish conquerors.\r\n\r\nAnd yonder door, made of solid oak, thick as a hand's palm, and covered\r\nwith sheets of iron and enormous nails--that door is the door of the\r\nchamber in which the treasures of the noble seigneur are kept. Only he\r\nkeeps the key. In that apartment are the large boxes, likewise ribbed\r\nwith iron, where he locks up his gold and silver sous, his precious\r\nstones, his costly vases, both sacred and profane, his necklaces, his\r\nbracelets, his gold-hilted parade sword, his handsome bridle with its\r\nsilver bit and his elaborately silver-ornamented saddle with stirrups of\r\nthe same metal--all stolen from this noble land of Gaul.\r\n\r\nLet us enter the banquet hall. It is night. By my faith! Those are\r\ncurious candelabras. They are made of flesh and bone. Ten slaves--all\r\nburnt by the sun, worn and barely clad in rags--are ranked five on one\r\nside, five on the other of the table. They stand motionless as statues\r\nand hold aloft large flaming torches of wax that barely serve to light\r\nthe place. A double row of rounded oak trunks, a sort of rustic\r\ncolonnade, divides the spacious hall into three compartments along its\r\nfull length, reaching at one end the door of the _mahl_, and at the\r\nother to the count's chamber, which, in turn communicates with the\r\napartments of Godegisele and her women.\r\n\r\nBetween the two rows of pillars stands the table of the count and of the\r\nleudes, his peers. To the right and left, and on the other sides of the\r\ntwo rows of pillars, stand two other tables--one is reserved for the\r\nwarriors of inferior rank, the other for the principal servants of the\r\ncount: his seneschal, his equerry, his chamberlains, seeing that the\r\nseigneurs imitate closely the customs and style of the royal courts. In\r\nthe four corners of the hall, the floor of which is, obedient to custom,\r\nstrewn with green leaves in summer, and straw in winter, stand four\r\nlarge barrels, two of hydromel, one of beer, and one of herbed wine,\r\nAuvergne wine mixed with spices and absinthe--a beverage pressed by the\r\nslaves of the burg. Along the wainscoting hang the count's hunting\r\ntrophies, together with his arms of war and the chase--heads of stags,\r\ndoes and wild goats, all garnished with their horns; wild boars' and\r\nwolves' heads with their fangs exposed. The flesh and skin have been\r\nremoved from these trophies; nothing remains but the whitened bones.\r\nBoar-spears, pikes, hunting-knives and horns, fishing-nets, falcon\r\ncoifs, implements of war, lances, francisques or double edged axes,\r\nswords, bucklers and shields painted in garish colors--all these are\r\nranged along the walls. On the table lie spread sheep and wild boars\r\nroasted whole, mountains of ham and smoked venison, avalanches of\r\ncabbage in vinegar, the latter being a favorite dish with the Franks;\r\nchunks of beef, mutton and veal of the cattle fattened in the count's\r\nyards; small game, poultry, carps and pikes, the latter of which are of\r\nextraordinary size; vegetables, fruit and cheese raised and prepared on\r\nthe fertile fields and farms of Auvergne; bowls and amphoras,\r\nincessantly replenished by butlers who run from the tables to the\r\nbarrels and back again, are as speedily emptied by the Franks with the\r\naid of wild bulls' horns that serve as their usual goblets. The horn\r\nused by Neroweg must have belonged to an animal of monstrous size. It is\r\nblack and hooped from top to bottom in gold and silver. From time to\r\ntime the seigneur makes a sign, whereupon several slaves standing at one\r\nend of the hall with drums and hunting horns, strike up an infernal\r\nmusic, which, however, is less discordant and deafening than the cries\r\nand laughter of the blockish Teutons, gorged gluttons, most of whom are\r\nat an advanced state of intoxication.\r\n\r\nWho produced these wines, these mountains of venison, of fish, of beef,\r\nof pork, of mutton, of game, of poultry, of vegetables and fruit? Gaul!\r\nThe country that is cultivated and rendered fruitful by a population of\r\nstarvelings, whose representatives, wan with hunger and privation in the\r\nmidst of such plenty, officiate as living torches to light the banquet.\r\nThat heap of good things is produced by men and women who, huddled in\r\nmud and straw huts, are, at that very moment, and in utter exhaustion,\r\npartaking of a tasteless pittance.\r\n\r\nBehold the Franks, gorged with food and wine; obscene jokes and\r\nchallenges to drink and drink still more are bandied backward and\r\nforward; the hall is a roar of boisterous laughter; beyond all others\r\nthe seigneur count is hilarious. At his side sits his clerk, who serves\r\nas his secretary and officiates in the oratory of the burg. According to\r\nthe newly introduced custom that the Church authorized, the Frankish\r\nseigneurs are allowed to keep a priest and chapel in their houses. The\r\nclerk has been assigned to Neroweg by Cautin. When making the\r\nassignment, the wily prelate said to the stupid barbarian: \"This clerk\r\ncan neither grant you remission for the sins that you may commit, nor\r\ncan he snatch you from the claws of Satan; only I have that power; but\r\nthe constant presence of a priest at your side will render the attempts\r\nof the demon more difficult; that will afford you time, in urgent cases,\r\nto wait for my arrival without danger of your being carried off to\r\nhell.\"\r\n\r\nThe boisterous mirthfulness of the leudes is at its height. Neroweg\r\nwishes to speak. Three times he strikes on the table with the handle of\r\nhis _scramasax_, the name given by the barbarians to the knife used at\r\ntable, and habitually worn at the warrior's belt. Silence, or some\r\ndegree of silence ensues. The count is to speak. With both his elbows\r\nleaning upon the table, he strokes and restrokes his long, reddish,\r\ngreasy and wine-soaked moustache between his thumb and index. The\r\nposture and gesture always announces with him some scheme of vicious\r\ncruelty. The leudes are aware of this and greet his words in advance\r\nwith gross and confident laughter. Without saying a word, Neroweg points\r\nout to his peers one of the slaves who, motionless, has been holding up\r\na torch at the banquet. The fellow is a poor old man, wrinkled and\r\nhaggard; his hair and beard are white and long; for only clothing he\r\nwears a tattered blouse and hose which expose his skin, yellow and\r\ntanned like parchment; his hose do not reach his bony knees; his bare\r\nand lank legs, scarred by the brambles among which he is forced to work,\r\nseem hardly able to support him. Compelled, like the rest of his\r\ntorch-bearing companions, to hold up the light with outstretched arm,\r\nand the whip of the Frankish overseer being ever ready to enforce the\r\norder with merciless cruelty, he felt his lean arm grow numb, weaken and\r\ntremble despite all he could do to prevent it.\r\n\r\nAfter pointing at the slave, Neroweg turned to his leudes with cruel\r\nhilarity and said:\r\n\r\n\"Hi--hi--hi--we shall now have a good laugh. You old toothless dog, why\r\ndo you not hold the candle straight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, I am very old--my arm grows tired despite myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, then, you are tired?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Yes, seigneur!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you know that he who does not hold up his torch straight is regaled\r\nwith fifty lashes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, my strength fails me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, seigneur--my fingers are numb--they can no longer hold the\r\ntorch--it will soon fall down--\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor old man--come, put out your torch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, thanks, seigneur!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment. What are you doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to blow out the torch--as you ordered me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I did not mean it in that way.\"\r\n\r\nAnd ever caressing his moustache, Neroweg cast ironical and cruel\r\nglances at his leudes.\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, how will you have me extinguish my torch?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to put it out between your knees.\"\r\n\r\nThe Frankish leudes received the comical idea of the count with loud\r\napplause and wild yells and laughter. The old Gaul trembled from head to\r\nfoot, looked imploringly at Neroweg, lowered his head and murmured:\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, my knees are bare, the torch will burn me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! You old brute! Do you imagine I would order you to extinguish the\r\ntorch between your knees if they were covered with oxhide or jambards of\r\niron?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, good seigneur, it will smart me terribly; for pity's sake, do\r\nnot impose such a torment upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bother! Your knees are bones!\"\r\n\r\nThe bright sally on the part of the count redoubled the laughter and\r\nhilarity of the leudes.\r\n\r\n\"It is true I am only skin and bones,\" answered the old man seeking to\r\nsoften his master's heart; \"I am quite weak--please spare me the pain,\r\nmy good seigneur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen--if you do not on the spot extinguish your torch between your\r\nknees, I shall have my men seize you and extinguish the torch in your\r\nthroat--take your choice, quickly!\"\r\n\r\nA fresh explosion of hilarity proved to the old Gaul that he had no\r\nmercy to expect from the Franks. He looked down weeping upon his frail\r\nand tremulous legs, and yielding to one last ray of hope he addressed\r\nthe clerk in suppliant accents:\r\n\r\n\"My good father in God--in the name of charity--do intercede in my\r\nbehalf with my good seigneur count!\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, I ask grace for the poor old man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clerk! Does the slave belong to me--yes or not? Am I his master--yes or\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"He belongs to you, noble seigneur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I dispose of my slave at my pleasure, and chastise him as I may\r\nchoose?\"\r\n\r\n\"My noble seigneur, it is your right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then! I want him to extinguish the torch between his knees;\r\nif not, by the great St. Martin! I shall extinguish it myself in his\r\nthroat!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my good father in God--do intercede again for me! I beg you!\"\r\n\r\n\"My good son,\" said the clerk with unction to the slave, \"we must accept\r\nwith resignation the trials that heaven sends us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you have done!\" cried the count again smiting the table with the\r\nhandle of his _scramasax_. \"We have had words enough--take your\r\nchoice--either your knees or your throat for an extinguisher! Do you\r\nhesitate--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, seigneur, I obey--\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was a very comical scene for the Franks. By the faith of a Vagre,\r\nthere was truly cause for laughter. With tears rolling down his cheeks,\r\nthe poor old Gaul first approached the burning torch to his trembling\r\nknees; the instant the flame touched him he quickly withdrew it again.\r\nBut the count, who, with both his hands upon his paunch swollen with\r\nfood and drink, was roaring with laughter and, like the rest of the\r\nleudes, shook with mirth, again smote the table violently with the\r\nhandle of his _scramasax_. The slave understood the signal. With\r\ntrembling hands he again drew the torch close to his icy knees, and\r\nassayed to put a quick end to the torture; he parted his legs a little\r\nand then brought them twice quickly and convulsively together so as to\r\nextinguish the flame between his knees. He succeeded in this, but not\r\nwithout emitting a piercing cry of pain; such was the pang he suffered\r\nthat the old man fell over upon his back and lay on the floor deprived\r\nof consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"I smell grilled dog!\" said the count dilating his nostrils like a beast\r\nof prey. The odor of burnt human flesh doubtlessly acted as an appetizer\r\nupon him, and he cried as if struck by a new idea: \"My valiant leudes,\r\nthe burg's prison is well stocked, I know. We have in the _ergastula_,\r\nloaded with chains, first of all, Ronan the Vagre and the\r\nhermit-laborer; they are now both nearly healed of their wounds; then we\r\nhave the little blonde slave, she is not yet well, she still seems to be\r\nat death's door; besides that, we have the handsome bishopess--she is\r\nnot wounded but is possessed of the devil--\".\r\n\r\n\"But, count,\" spoke up one of the leudes, \"what do you propose to do\r\nwith those cursed Vagres, the little Vagress and the handsome witch whom\r\nwe brought prisoners with us from the combat at the fastnesses of\r\nAllange? What manner of torture will you inflict upon them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! how I regret that they have not a thousand members to burn and hack\r\nto pieces in order to expiate the death of our companions in arms whom\r\nthey killed in the fastness!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you have them tried here, count?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--no--they shall be tried at Clermont. Bishop Cautin insists upon his\r\njurisdiction over them. Oh! By the Terrible Eagle, my ancestor who\r\nskinned his prisoners alive, the Vagre, the hermit-laborer and the witch\r\nshall be submitted to frightful tortures. But they do not concern us\r\nthis evening. When I mentioned to you the prisoners in the _ergastula_,\r\nmy good leudes, what I meant to say was that we have there one of my\r\ndomestic slaves who is charged with larceny by the cook slave. The\r\nlatter asserts, the former denies the theft. Which of the two lies? In\r\norder to ascertain the truth, let us put the two cubs to the cold water\r\nand hot iron trials, according to the law of our Salic Franks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE MAHL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tribunal assembles. The count presides over the _mahl_ on his seat;\r\nseven leudes, ranked on benches on either side, assist him. The\r\ntorch-bearing slaves stand behind the judges. The judgment seat is well\r\nlighted, while the rear of the hall, where the other leudes and warriors\r\nof the burg are grouped, remains in semi-obscurity, brightened, however,\r\nfrom time to time by the reflexion of the fire in the large stove which\r\nthe blacksmith of the stables has lighted and blows into flame. The nine\r\nplow-shares are being heated red in the stove. Before the stove, and\r\neven with the ground, is the wide and deep tank filled with water. The\r\nslave charged with larceny stands at the foot of the tribunal with his\r\narms tied behind his back. He is a young man and looks frightened at the\r\njudges. The accuser, a man of ripe age, contemplates the tribunal\r\nconfidently. Agreeable to the usage in such instances, six other slaves\r\nsurround the two men. They are chosen by the accuser and the accused to\r\naffirm under oath what they believe to be the truth. They are called\r\n_conjurators_.\r\n\r\n\"To the trial! To the trial!\" cries the count. \"Mayor, inform the slave\r\nanew of the charge against him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justin, a cook-slave of our seigneur, the count, happened to be alone\r\nin the kitchen; on the kitchen table lay a small silver dish used by\r\ndame Godegisele, the noble spouse of our master. Peter, this other\r\nslave, entered the kitchen bringing in some kindling wood. Immediately\r\nafter his departure, Justin noticed that the silver dish had\r\ndisappeared. He immediately announced the theft and accused Peter of\r\nhaving committed it. I told Justin that one of his ears would be cut off\r\nif the dish was not found. He answered me that he swore by the salvation\r\nof his soul that he told the truth and that the thief was this other\r\nslave.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I repeat it again, seigneur count. If the dish was stolen it could\r\nhave been stolen only by Peter. I swear it upon my share of paradise. I\r\nam innocent. My _conjurators_ are all ready to swear like myself upon\r\nthe salvation of their souls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered the six slaves in chorus; \"we swear that Justin is\r\ninnocent of the theft--we swear upon the salvation of our souls, we\r\nswear upon our share of paradise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear, dog?\" said Neroweg turning towards Peter. \"What have you\r\nto say? What became of the silver dish, a precious article that I\r\nbrought from the pillage of the town of Issoire? Will you answer, dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, I did not steal the dish, I did not even see it on the\r\ntable--my _conjurators_ are ready to swear to it, like myself, upon my\r\nsalvation--upon my share of paradise--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" put in the six in their turn, the _conjurators_ of the\r\naccused slave. \"Peter is innocent; we swear upon our salvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear brother in Christ,\" said the clerk to the accused slave, \"think\r\nof it. It is a grave sin, theft is, and falsehood is another grave sin.\r\nTake care--the Almighty sees and hears you--His hand lies heavy upon\r\nthieves and liars--\"\r\n\r\n\"My good father, I stand in great fear of the Almighty; I follow His\r\ncommandments as you teach them to us; I support my trials with\r\nresignation; I obey my master, the seigneur count, with the submission\r\nthat you order us to the end that we may gain paradise; but I swear I\r\ndid not steal the dish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur count,\" said Justin, \"I swear by the eternal flames that I did\r\nnot steal the dish, and only Peter can be the thief--I am innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justin affirms and Peter denies; now I, Neroweg, order that, in order\r\nto ascertain the truth, they be both put to the trial--one to the trial\r\nof cold water, the other to the trial of burning irons--\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur count,\" broke in the clerk, \"you order that both the accuser\r\nand the accused be subjected to trial. But should the judgment of the\r\nAlmighty prove that the accused is guilty, is not the accuser thereby\r\ndeclared innocent? Why should both be put to the trial at the same\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\n\"If the accused and the accuser agreed between themselves to steal my\r\ndish,\" replied the count, \"and if, in order to remove our suspicions,\r\nthey mutually accuse each other, the trial will establish whether they\r\nare both guilty or innocent, or whether one is guilty and the other\r\ninnocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the leudes enjoying by anticipation the spectacle of\r\nhuman suffering; \"the double trial!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid of the trial!\" exclaimed Justin in a firm voice. \"God\r\nwill bear witness to my innocence--\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am quite certain that I did not steal the dish,\" said Peter\r\ntrembling, \"and yet I am afraid of the trial!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your companion, my dear son in Christ, sets you the example of a pious\r\nreliance upon divine justice, knowing the Eternal only condemns the\r\nguilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, good father!\" said Peter to the clerk, \"think of it, if the trial\r\nshould turn out against me!\"\r\n\r\n\"My son, it will be a proof that you did steal the dish.\"\r\n\r\n\"But no--no--I did not commit the theft.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, my son, you need have no fear of the judgment of God. His\r\njustice is infallible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good father, I hope you are right!\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak not thus, my dear son. This law is holy, it is the Salic Law, the\r\nlaw of the Salian Franks, our conquerors. It is placed under protection\r\nby our Lord Jesus Christ. I shall read to you the preamble of the law\r\nin the name of which you are to be subjected to trial:\r\n\r\n\"'The illustrious nation of the Franks, founded by God, strong in war,\r\nwise in council, of noble stature, of singular whiteness and beauty,\r\nbold, agile and mighty in battle, has recently been converted to the\r\nCatholic faith, which it practices pure and free from the defilement of\r\nany heresy; the said illustrious nation has prepared and dictated the\r\nSalic Law through the medium of the oldest members who then governed the\r\nnation. The _gast_ of Wiso, the _gast_ of Bodo, the _gast_ of Salo, the\r\n_gast_ of Wido, who inhabit the places called Salo-Heim, Bodo-Heim,\r\nWiso-Heim and Wido-Heim met during three _mahls_, carefully discussed\r\nand adopted this law.\r\n\r\n\"'Long live he who loves the Franks! May Christ uphold their empire! May\r\nHeaven enlighten their chiefs and fill them with grace! May He protect\r\nthe army, may He fortify the faith, may He grant peace and happiness to\r\nthose who govern them under the auspices of our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\nAmen.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Clerk, we have had words enough!\" put in the count. \"The accused shall\r\nbe put to the trial of the cold water--let his right hand be bound to\r\nhis left foot, and let him be thrown into the tank head foremost. If he\r\nfloats the judgment of God condemns him; he will then be pronounced\r\nguilty and shall to-morrow suffer punishment. If he sinks to the bottom,\r\nthe judgment of God will have absolved him.\"\r\n\r\nAt a sign of Neroweg several of his men seized the Gallic slave, and\r\ndespite the resistance that he offered and his supplications, they tied\r\nhis right hand to his left foot.\r\n\r\n\"Alas,\" moaned the wretched man, \"what a terrible law that law is, good\r\nfather! What a fate is mine! If I remain at the bottom of the tank I\r\nshall drown, however innocent I may be! And if I float, I shall be\r\nsentenced and executed as a thief!\"\r\n\r\n\"The judgment of the Eternal, my dear son, can never go wrong.\"\r\n\r\nAlready the Franks were raising the slave in their arms and were about\r\nto cast him into the tank when the clerk cried out:\r\n\r\n\"And the consecration of the water!\"\r\n\r\nAnd stepping towards the slave who moaned aloud, the clerk placed upon\r\nthe Gaul's lips a silver cross that he carried around his neck and said:\r\n\r\n\"Kiss this cross, my dear son.\"\r\n\r\nThe young slave devoutly kissed the symbol of the death of the Friend of\r\nthe sorrowful, while the clerk pronounced aloud the formula adopted by\r\nthe Church:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thou who art about to undergo the trial of cold water, I adjure\r\nthee, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the name of the Father,\r\nthe Son and the Holy Ghost, in the name of the indivisible Trinity, in\r\nthe name of all the angels, archangels, principalities, powers and\r\ndominions, virtues, thrones, cherubim and seraphim, if thou art guilty,\r\nthat this water may reject thee, without any sorcery preventing it from\r\nso doing; and Thou Lord Jesus Christ, give us such a sign of Thy majesty\r\nthat if this man has committed the crime, he be rejected by this water\r\nto the praise and the glory of Thy holy name, and to the end that all\r\nmay recognize that Thou art God. And you, water! Water created by the\r\nomnipotent Father for the needs of man, I adjure you, in the name of the\r\nindivisible Trinity which allowed the people of Israel to cross the Red\r\nSea, dry-footed, I adjure you, water, to refuse to accept this body if\r\nhe has eased his shoulders of the burden of good works. I so order you,\r\nwater, confident in the virtue of God alone in whose name I demand\r\nobedience from you. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThe consecration being finished by the clerk, the Franks raised over\r\ntheir heads the Gallic slave who screamed and struggled to free himself,\r\nand hurled him violently into the center of the tank amidst the loud\r\nguffaw of the count and the witnessing Franks.\r\n\r\n\"Never yet did otter, leaping from a willow tree after a carp, make so\r\nbeautiful a plunge,\" exclaimed the good seigneur count holding his\r\nsides; he was laughing so heartily. The witnessing Franks also laughed\r\nand roared, and crowded around the tank saying to one another:\r\n\r\n\"He will float--the scamp!\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not float--he is not guilty!\"\r\n\r\n\"How he beats the water!\"\r\n\r\n\"And that gurgling sound--glou--glou--glou!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a bottle that is emptying itself--\"\r\n\r\n\"There he comes to the surface!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he sinks again!\"\r\n\r\nPresently the slave rose and succeeded in keeping himself for a moment\r\non the surface. His face was livid and distorted, his hair streaming,\r\nhis eyes rolling back like the eyes of a man who has escaped drowning by\r\nsome desperate effort. He beat the water with the only arm that was free\r\nand cried:\r\n\r\n\"Help! I drown! Help!\"\r\n\r\nIn his fright the innocent fellow forgot that the life which he implored\r\nwas reserved for the cruel punishment meted out to thieves, seeing the\r\n_judgment of God_ would have convicted him as such. The young man was\r\npulled half dead out of the tank; as he lay on the floor the Franks\r\nderived increased pleasure from his contortions, and the expression of\r\nhis purplish face, on which the stamp of terror was still visible.\r\n\r\n\"My son, my son, I warned you before,\" said the clerk in threatening\r\naccents. \"Theft is a grave crime! And falsehood is another grave crime!\r\nHere you lie--guilty of both! The sacred judgment of the Lord has, in\r\nHis infallible and divine truth, pronounced you guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to, miserable thief!\" said to him one of his _conjurators_ who\r\nfeared to share the punishment of Peter. \"You assured us of your\r\ninnocence, we trusted your word, and you deceived us--the judgment of\r\nGod has condemned you! Go to, infamous fellow--we shall gladly give a\r\nhand in your execution!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am innocent! I am innocent!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what about the judgment of God, blasphemer!\" cried Justin, the\r\naccuser.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, I am nevertheless innocent--I did not steal the dish!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, impious criminal! The trial that I shall now undergo\r\nwith blind faith in the justice of the Lord will furnish further proof\r\nof your guilt!\" retorted Justin.\r\n\r\n\"Good! Good, my dear son! Step aside from the miserable liar, thief and\r\nblasphemer! Your innocence will be quickly established; your piety will\r\nhave its reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know it, good father! I long for the trial! May the holy name of\r\nGod be glorified!\"\r\n\r\n\"That dog, whom the judgment of our omnipotent Lord has pronounced\r\nguilty, shall receive condign punishment. Now let us pass to the trial\r\nof the red-hot irons. Although the first trial has proved to us the\r\nguilt of that slave, there is nothing as yet to prove that the other\r\nfellow is innocent. They may be both accomplices in the theft of my\r\nsilver dish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my noble seigneur, I am in no fear!\" cried the cook, his face\r\nbeaming with celestial confidence. \"I bless the name of God for His\r\nhaving reserved to me the opportunity to bear witness to my profound\r\nfaith in our holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic religion, and to triumph\r\na second time over the accusations of the wicked. I know, O Lord, that,\r\nfaithful to your commandments, I shall triumph with humility.\"\r\n\r\nWith the believer impatiently awaiting the new triumph of his innocence,\r\nthe clerk proceeded, agreeable to the usage, to consecrate and adjure\r\nthe red-hot irons in the brasier, just as he had conjured the water in\r\nthe tank. He ordered the red-hot irons with the same solemn invocations\r\nthat they respect the soles of the slave's feet if he was innocent, and\r\nto burn him to the bone if he was guilty of having robbed his seigneur.\r\n\r\nThe conjuration being done, the stable blacksmiths drew forth from the\r\nstove, with the aid of long tongs, the nine red-hot plow-shares that\r\nthey held in readiness, and laid them down in a row flat upon the stone\r\nfloor at a distance of two or three inches from one another. Ranged in\r\nthat order, they presented a strange aspect--an enormous red-hot\r\ngridiron.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" said the count. \"The irons must not be allowed to cool off.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a jig will not the cub dance on that row of burning irons, if he\r\nwas in the plot with the other thief to steal your dish!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet what a wondrous miracle is about to be accomplished if the cook\r\nis really innocent!\" remarked another leude with impatient curiosity.\r\n\"To walk over red-hot plow-shares without burning one's feet! It takes\r\nthe God of the Christians to accomplish such a miracle!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the curiosity of the Franks that their cruel wish to see the\r\nslave dance upon the red-hot irons struggled strongly against the wish\r\nto witness a wonderful miracle. Hardly was the last plow-share ranged in\r\nits place upon the floor than Neroweg, fearing to have them cool off,\r\ncalled out impatiently to Justin:\r\n\r\n\"Quick! Quick! Walk over them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, my dear son; fear naught!\" added the clerk.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am not afraid, good father,\" answered the cook in a voice of\r\ninspired exaltation; and crossing his arms over his breast, he cried out\r\nfervently: \"Lord God, Thou readest in the hearts of men; Thou hast\r\nalready borne witness to my innocence--give in favor of Thy servant a\r\nnew proof of Thy infallible justice--order the burning irons to be as\r\nsoft under my feet as if I trod upon a carpet of moss and flowers!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, his face beaming with serenity, and his eyes raised heavenward, the\r\nGallic slave moved with firm steps towards the gridiron of red-hot\r\nplow-shares. During the short interval that elapsed before the accused\r\nexposed himself to the _judgment of God_, the count, his clerk and all\r\nthe witnessing Franks seemed impressed by the slave's imperturbable\r\nconfidence; they looked at one another; and Neroweg said in a low voice\r\nto the leudes that sat beside him:\r\n\r\n\"The cook must be truly innocent of the theft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed! March on, my son in God!\" cried the clerk at the moment when\r\nJustin was raising his foot over the first plow-share. \"The justice of\r\nthe Eternal is infallible. You said it--it is over a carpet of moss and\r\nflowers that your feet are to walk.\"\r\n\r\nBut our fervent Catholic had barely touched the red-hot iron with his\r\nfeet when he emitted a frightful shriek. So intensely unbearable was the\r\npain that he tripped and fell down forward on his knees and hands. As he\r\nthus tumbled over the red-hot plow-shares he gave himself fresh and deep\r\nburns all over his body, until, driven crazy, he made a desperate bound\r\nclean over the implements of his torture, and, roaring with pain, rolled\r\ndown over the floor ten paces away, near where his companion Peter lay,\r\ntied hand and foot.\r\n\r\n\"Glory to the judgment of the Lord!\" cried the leudes in chorus, struck\r\nwith admiration. \"Glory to Christ!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I not tell you so?\" remarked the count complacently. \"The two\r\nthieves were both in the plot to steal my silver dish. The ears of both\r\nshall be cropped to-morrow, and they shall be both put on the rack until\r\nthey reveal the place where they hid the dish--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, count!\" cried Justin roaring with pain and rage. \"The\r\nonly thieves and plunderers around are yourself and your men. Had I\r\nstolen the dish, I would only have robbed a thief--but I did not take\r\nit--as truly as I here renounce the infamous religion that wrongly finds\r\nme guilty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wretch! Blasphemer of our holy religion! I order in the name of God--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, too, priest--you shall no longer dupe me. Your\r\nalleged religion is but a lie and a fraud; it bears false witness\r\nagainst the innocent. Oh, how I suffer--how I suffer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sufferings are but foretastes of the tortures that you will\r\nundergo in hell, where you will burn everlastingly, you sacrilegious\r\nthief! Oh, seigneur count, if this impious and audacious wretch\r\ncontinues to blaspheme, we shall not be able to conjure away the\r\nmisfortunes that he will draw upon your house.\"\r\n\r\nTerrified at the sacrilegious utterances of the Gallic slave; pale,\r\ntrembling and shuddering at the thought that, attracted by the dreadful\r\nblasphemies of the condemned man, the devil might suddenly appear in\r\nperson, take possession of the malefactor and carry him straight to\r\nhell, Neroweg thundered to the blacksmith at the stove:\r\n\r\n\"Are the tongs still in the brasier and red-hot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, seigneur, to command.\"\r\n\r\n\"The accursed fellow shall no longer blaspheme and place my burg in\r\ndanger of being visited by the devil. Let the sacrilegious criminal be\r\nseized, and his tongue be burned out with the red-hot tongs. Tell me,\r\nclerk, do you believe the Lord will be pacified if I inflict that\r\npunishment upon the slave?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe, seigneur count, that there is no punishment too terrible for\r\nthis accursed man who has renounced his religion, and called its holy\r\npriests impostors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clerk, shall I have him quartered in order to be all the surer that the\r\ndevils will be conjured away from my burg?\"\r\n\r\n\"The first punishment that you mentioned will suffice--the accursed man\r\nwill have been punished in the member that sinned--his criminal and\r\nblasphemous tongue; it will thereafter utter no more blasphemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe tongue of the Gallic slave was burned and pulled out with red-hot\r\ntongs. The count went back to the banquet hall with his leudes, and\r\nthere proceeded to drink himself drunk before retiring to his wife in\r\nthe women's apartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTRE OF WISIGARDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile her lord and master, Neroweg, together with his leudes, was\r\ndrinking himself to the point of intoxication in the banquet hall,\r\nGodegisele, the count's fifth wife, sat in her chamber amidst her female\r\nslaves and diligently plied her distaff by the light of a copper lamp.\r\nAlthough still young, Godegisele was of delicate health and frail. Her\r\ncomplexion was waxen; her long pale-blonde hair was braided in two\r\nstrands and fell from under her _obbon_--the name given by the Franks to\r\na sort of skull-cap woven of gold and silver thread--over her shoulders,\r\nthat were bare like her arms. The advanced stage of pregnancy in which\r\nshe was imparted to her sweet sad features an expression of suffering.\r\nGodegisele wore the costume of the Frankish women of high condition--a\r\nlong decolleté robe with open and flowing sleeves, and held by a scarf\r\naround her now unshapely waist. Her arms were ornamented with gold\r\nbracelets, studded with precious stones, while a sea-eel necklace that\r\nderived its name from the fish, which, when captured, twists itself\r\naround the arm in such a manner that its head touches the tip of its\r\ntail--wound its golden, ruby-dotted coil around her neck. One thing\r\nthere was about Godegisele's robe that rendered it incongruous. Its\r\nwearer was frail, slender and short, but the rich robe seemed to have\r\nbeen made for a large and robust woman. About a score of young\r\nwretchedly clad female slaves sat around Godegisele upon the leaves that\r\nthe floor was strewn with, while the count's wife occupied an armed\r\nstool over which a silver embroidered carpet was thrown. Several of the\r\ngirl slaves were handsome. Some worked at their distaffs like their\r\nmistress, others were engaged at their needles; occasionally they\r\nexchanged a few words in a low voice and in the Gallic tongue, which\r\ntheir mistress, being herself of Frankish extraction, understood poorly.\r\nOne of them, named Morise, a young and handsome girl with raven-black\r\nhair who was sold to a noble Frank when ten years of age, spoke the\r\nlanguage of the conquerors fluently, on account of which Godegisele\r\nconversed with her in preference. At this moment the count's wife\r\ndropped her distaff which she held across her knees and said to the\r\nslave in a tremulous voice:\r\n\r\n\"And so, Morise, you saw her assassinated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam, I witnessed the sad scene. On that day she wore that same\r\ngreen robe with silver flowers that you have on, she also had on the\r\nhandsome necklace and bracelets that I see on your arms and neck.\"\r\n\r\nGodegisele shuddered and could not withhold a fearful glance from her\r\nbracelets and robe, the latter of which was twice too large for her.\r\n\r\n\"And--for what reason did he kill her, Morise? What was it that angered\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had drunk more than usual on that evening--he entered here, where we\r\nnow are, unsteady of foot. It was winter--there was a fire in the\r\nhearth. His wife Wisigarde sat at a corner of the chimney. The seigneur\r\ncount then had among us a washerwoman, named Martine, for his favorite.\r\nHe said to Martine: 'Come, come, confounded wench--let's to bed--and\r\nyou, Wisigarde,' he added addressing his wife, 'take a lamp and light\r\nus.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That, certainly, was a great shame upon Wisigarde.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the more, madam, seeing she was of a proud temper and impetuous\r\nnature. She often whipped and bit us, and she quarrelled a good deal\r\nwith the seigneur count.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Morise! Did she dare quarrel with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she feared nothing--nothing! When she was in a rage, she roared and\r\nground her teeth like a lioness.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a terrible woman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, madam, that evening, instead of yielding to the whim of the\r\nseigneur count, and taking the lamp to light him to his bed, Wisigarde\r\nbegan scolding them both--the count and Martine.\"\r\n\r\n\"She certainly invited death! My blood freezes in my veins at the\r\nthought of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon, madam, I saw, as clearly as I see you now, the count's eyes\r\ngrow bloodshot and froth rise to his lips. He threw himself upon his\r\nwife, struck her in the face with his fist, and then, giving her a kick\r\nin the stomach, threw her to the ground. She was in as towering a rage\r\nas himself, and did not cease hurling invectives at him; she even tried\r\nto bite him, when, after he had thrown her upon the ground, he planted\r\nboth his knees upon her chest. Finally, he held her throat so tight in\r\nboth his large hands that her face became violet and she was strangled.\r\nAfter she lay dead, he went to bed with Martine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Morise, I fear me the same fate for myself, some day. That terrible\r\ncount will yet kill me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd shuddering over her whole frame, Godegisele dropped her head upon\r\nher bosom, and her distaff fell down at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madam, you should not be so alarmed. As long, at any rate, as you\r\nwill be pregnant, you will have nothing to fear--the seigneur count will\r\nnot want to kill at one blow both his wife and child.\"\r\n\r\n\"But after I shall have given birth to that child--I shall then be\r\nkilled like Wisigarde!\"\r\n\r\n\"That will depend, madam, upon the humor of the seigneur count. He may\r\nprefer to cast you off and return you to your parents, as he did the\r\nother wives whom he did not kill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Morise! Would to heaven that monseigneur the count would return me\r\nto my family! What a misfortune to me it was that Neroweg should have\r\nseen me when he visited Mayence! What a misfortune that the wisp of\r\nstraw which he threw at my breast when he took me to wife was not a\r\nsharp-pointed dagger! I would have at least died amidst my own family.\"\r\n\r\n\"What wisp of straw was that, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not know that it is the custom with us, that when a Frank weds a\r\nfree girl, he takes her right hand, and with his left throws a wisp of\r\nstraw into her bosom?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madam, I did not know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the custom in Germany. Alas, Morise, I repeat it, would that that\r\nwisp of straw had been a dagger! I would have died without undergoing my\r\npresent agony. And now that I know about the murder of Wisigarde, my\r\nlife will be but one long and cruel agony.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, madam, you should have refused to wed the count, seeing he\r\ninspired you with such horror.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dared not, Morise. Oh, he will surely kill me! Woe is me! He will\r\nkill me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why think you, madam, that he will commit such a crime again? You never\r\nas much as whisper a word, whatever he may do or say. He abuses us, the\r\nfemale slaves, seeing he is master, and you never complain; you never\r\nset foot outside of the women's apartments, except for a short walk\r\nalong the fosse of the burg. Why, madam, I ask you, do you apprehend\r\nthat your husband will kill you?\"\r\n\r\n\"When he is intoxicated he does not reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true--there is always that danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that danger is continuous; he is every day intoxicated. Oh, why did\r\nI come to this distant region of Gaul, where I feel an utter stranger!\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a long interval of sad revery:\r\n\r\n\"Morise--my good Morise!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, I am at your orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, all of you slaves, do not hate me, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madam; you are not wicked like Wisigarde--you never whip and bite\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Morise, listen to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, I listen. But why are you silent? And your cheeks, otherwise so\r\npale, growing incarnate--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is because I dare not tell you. But listen, you are--you are--one of\r\nmonseigneur the count's favorites.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no choice--if not willingly, I must submit by force. Despite my\r\nrepugnance for him, I prefer to share his bed whenever he orders me,\r\nthan to be striped by his whip, or be sent out to turn the wheel of the\r\nmill; and by quietly submitting, I am employed in household work; that\r\nis easier than to be employed at the hard labor of the fields--it is a\r\nchoice of evils--this is the lesser, and the food is not as poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know--I know. I do not blame you, Morise. But answer me without\r\nlying: when you are with the count, you do not, do you, seek to irritate\r\nhim against me? Alas, we know of slaves who have in that way caused the\r\ndeath of their mistresses, and who thereupon became their seigneur's\r\nwife.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have such an aversion for him, madam, that I swear I never open my\r\nmouth but to say 'yes' or 'no' in answer to any question that he may put\r\nto me. Moreover, since he is always intoxicated at night when he calls\r\nme in, he hardly speaks. You see I have neither the chance nor the wish\r\nof speaking to him against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that really true, Morise? Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to make you some little present, but monseigneur never\r\nlets me have any money. He keeps all his money under lock and key in his\r\ncoffers, and for only _morgen-gab_, the morning present that it is\r\ncustomary in our country for the husband to make to his wife, the count\r\nhas given me the robes and jewels of his fourth wife, Wisigarde. Every\r\nday he demands of me that I show them to him, and he counts them. I\r\nhave nothing to offer you, Morise, nothing but my friendship, if you\r\npromise me not to irritate monseigneur against me.\"\r\n\r\n\"My heart would have to be very wicked, if I were to anger monseigneur\r\nagainst you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Morise! How I would like to be in your place!\"\r\n\r\n\"You, a count's wife--you would prefer to be a slave! Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! He would as soon kill me as any one else, if the fancy took\r\nhim--but you, madam, have in the meantime, beautiful dresses, rich\r\njewels, slaves to serve you--and besides, you are free.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not step out of the burg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you do not wish to. Wisigarde rode on horseback and hunted. You\r\nshould have seen her on her black palfrey, with her purple robe, and her\r\nfalcon on her finger! At any rate, though she be dead, she never wasted\r\ntime grieving--while you, madam, do nothing else than work at your\r\ndistaff, or gaze at the sky from your window, or weep--what a life! What\r\na sad existence!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, it is because I am always thinking of my own country, of my\r\nparents, so far away--so far away from this country of Gaul, where I am\r\nan utter stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wisigarde did not trouble herself about such matters--she drank deeply,\r\nand ate almost as much as the count.\"\r\n\r\n\"He always told me and my father that she died of an accident. And so\r\nyou assure me, Morise, that it is there--on that spot--that he killed\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam, he threw her down with a kick--she fell near that beam--and\r\nthen--\"\r\n\r\n\"What ails you, Morise--why do you tremble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, madam, do you not hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Everything is quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is someone walking in seigneur the count's room--I hear the seats\r\npushed about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is he--it is my husband!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam, it is his step.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am afraid--remain near me!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Neroweg. His latest libations had thrown him into a state of\r\nalmost complete intoxication. He stepped into his wife's apartment with\r\na drunken man's unsteady foot. At the sight of their master, all the\r\nslaves rose timidly. As to Godegisele, she was in such a tremor that she\r\nwas hardly able to rise from her stool. The count stopped for a moment\r\nat the threshold, leaned one hand against the door-case, and, with his\r\nbody swaying backward and forward, let his eyes travel over the scared\r\nslaves with a besotted and semi-libidinous look. After repeated\r\nhiccoughs he called out to his wife's confidant:\r\n\r\n\"Morise--come--come, confounded wench!\"\r\n\r\nAnd looking at Godegisele he added:\r\n\r\n\"You look pale--you seem troubled--my dove. Why so pale?\"\r\n\r\nThe poor creature's mind doubtlessly ran upon the circumstances of the\r\nfateful night when her husband strangled his fourth wife, shortly after\r\nhaving used these very words towards his then favorite slave: 'Come,\r\ncome, confounded wench!' Neroweg's words threw his wife into greater\r\nperturbation and frightened her to a degree that all she was able to say\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur! Monseigneur! Mercy!\"\r\n\r\n\"What! What ails you? Answer!\" shouted the count brutally. \"Do you,\r\nperchance, object that I told Morise to come? Dare you cross me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! Oh, no! Is not monseigneur master in this place? Are not his female\r\nslaves at his orders? And am not I, Godegisele, myself, his humble\r\nservant?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the unhappy woman, wholly losing her head in her terror, as she\r\nimagined herself on the point of being strangled like Wisigarde, who\r\nowed her death to her refusal to light her husband and his night's\r\ncompanion to the conjugal bed, hastened to stammer:\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary--if monseigneur wishes, I shall light him to his bed\r\nwith this lamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madam!\" Morise whispered to her mistress. \"What an unfortunate\r\ninspiration is that! It is to recall to the count's memory the murder of\r\nhis other wife.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, at the last words of Godegisele a shudder ran through Neroweg;\r\nhe brusquely stepped towards her; seized her threateningly by the arm\r\nand bellowed in a maudlin voice:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you propose to light me to bed with a lamp?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, monseigneur! Do not kill me!\"--and she dropped upon her knees.\r\n\"Oh, do not kill me, your servant, as you killed Wisigarde.\"\r\n\r\nThe count suddenly grew as pale as his wife, and, stricken with a terror\r\nthat stimulated his inebriety, he cried:\r\n\r\n\"She knows that I strangled Wisigarde! She is uttering the same words\r\nthat Wisigarde uttered when I killed her! This is the work of some evil\r\nspirit! Wisigarde herself or her spectre will perhaps appear this night\r\nbefore my bed and torment me! It is a warning from heaven--or from hell.\r\nThe devil must be conjured away!\"\r\n\r\nAnd turning to Morise:\r\n\r\n\"Run quick for the clerk! He shall pray at my side during the night--he\r\nshall not leave me. The spectre of Wisigarde will not dare to approach\r\nme with a priest at my side.\"\r\n\r\nThe count's terror increased amain while Morise ran out for the clerk,\r\nand Godegisele, more dead than alive with fear, clung on her knees to\r\nthe beam as she felt her strength wholly leaving her. The count noticed\r\nnot her distress, but also dropping on his knees smote his chest and\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\"Lord, God! Have mercy upon a miserable sinner! I paid for my brother's\r\ndeath, I paid for the death of my wife Wisigarde, I shall pay still\r\nmore to keep Wisigarde from haunting me! I shall to-morrow start the\r\nbuilding of the chapel in the fastness of Allange; I shall have the\r\nvilla of Bishop Cautin rebuilt! Lord! Good Lord God! Have mercy upon a\r\nmiserable sinner! Deliver me from the devil and from the spectre of\r\nWisigarde!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the fervent and devout believer, besotted with terror and\r\nintoxication, furiously smote his chest as, filled with frightful\r\nanxiety, he awaited the arrival of the clerk.\r\n\r\nSuch was the humanity, generousness, enlightenment of the race of the\r\nconquerors of old Gaul! What a tender attachment to their wives! What a\r\nrespect for the sweet bonds of the family and for the sanctity of the\r\ndomestic hearth! Oh, our mothers! Virile matrons, so venerated by our\r\nancestors! Proud Gallic women of yore, who sat beside your husbands at\r\nthe solemn councils of the state, where peace and war were decided upon!\r\nWives beloved, valiant and strong in arms! Holy virgins! Women emperors!\r\nO, Margarid, Hena, Meroë, Loyse, Genevieve, Ellen, Sampso, Victoria the\r\nGreat--rejoice! Rejoice that you have quitted this world for the\r\nmysterious worlds where we shall live forever! Rejoice at the strongness\r\nof your hearts! What indignation, what shame, what a grief to your souls\r\nat the sight of your sisters--although of a different race from your own\r\nand hostile--at the sight of women--the wives of kings, seigneurs and\r\nwarriors--treated, the wicked and the good alike, with such contempt and\r\nferocity by their barbarous husbands!\r\n\r\nSuch are those Franks whom the bishops invited to the quarry of Gaul!\r\nSuch are the conquerors whom the priests of Christ fondle, caress,\r\nflatter and bless!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE LION OF POITIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeigneur count! Seigneur count Neroweg! Wake up! Instead of having spent\r\nthe night, as you expected, in the arms of one of your female slaves,\r\nout of fear for the devil you spent it on your knees, close to your\r\nclerk, and repeating in a maudlin and besotted voice the prayers that\r\nthe holy man mumbled, half asleep, into your ears. After having eaten\r\nand drunk his fill he would have by far preferred his own bed to your\r\ncompany. Finally reassured by the first peep of day--a time that bars\r\nout the demons--you fell asleep on your couch, furnished with\r\nbear-skins, the trophies of the chase. Seigneur count Neroweg, awake!\r\nOne of the five sons of your good King Clotaire, to-day the sole master\r\nof Gaul--all the other sons and grandsons of the pious Clovis, who rests\r\nin consecrated ground in the basilica of the venerated apostles at\r\nParis, having died--one of the five sons of that King Clotaire, Chram by\r\nname, a bastard son--but what does that matter!--and governor of\r\nAuvergne in his father's name, Chram is approaching! He comes, a signal\r\nfavor, with his three favorites, a goodly number of leudes in the train\r\nof his _antrustions_, as the royal favorites proudly style themselves.\r\nAwake, Neroweg! Awake, seigneur count! There is Chram, coming to pay you\r\na visit. Brilliant and numerous is the cavalcade of his suite. The three\r\ndear friends of Chram, still dearer friends of pillage, of murder and of\r\nrape, accompany the royal personage, do you not hear? Their names are\r\nImnachair, Spatachair, and the \"Lion of Poitiers,\" the renegade Gaul,\r\nwho, like so many others of his stripe, rallied to the conquering\r\nFranks. The \"Lion of Poitiers\" earned his name by reason of his\r\ncarnivorous taste for rapine and flesh dripping blood.\r\n\r\nSeigneur count! Seigneur count Neroweg! Will you not wake up? Wake up\r\nalso your wife Godegisele, who spent the night dreaming of strangled\r\nwives. Be up and doing. Let Godegisele array herself in the most\r\nresplendent jewels of your fourth wife Wisigarde! Hurry, hurry, seigneur\r\ncount! Let Godegisele don her most attractive raiment! She may be to the\r\ntaste of Chram or of his favorites. He is a gracious king, an\r\naccommodating king. There is none more so. Is a woman, whether free or\r\nslave, pleasing to the eye of any friend of his, he forthwith equips his\r\nfavorite with a _royal diploma_, by virtue of which he takes the woman\r\nthat he covets.\r\n\r\nQuick, quick, seigneur count! Order your leudes to take horse and your\r\nfoot soldiers to put on their gala armors, and yourself, seigneur count,\r\nhead your band, cased in your parade armor and carrying on your side the\r\nmagnificent gold-hilted Spanish sword, which you stole on the occasion\r\nof the plundering of the land of the Visigoths, the \"damned Arians\" and\r\n\"accursed heretics,\" upon whom the Catholic bishops let you loose with\r\nthe fagot in one hand, the sword in the other, exactly as you let loose\r\nyour pack of hounds upon the wild beasts of the forest! Be quick, be\r\nquick, leap upon your roan horse harnessed in its saddle and bridle of\r\nred leather, with bit and stirrups of silver! Quick! Ride out at a\r\ngallop to meet your glorious Prince Chram; ride out at the head of your\r\nhorsemen and footmen! Already your royal guest and his suite, whose\r\napproach one of their forerunners has announced, are only at a little\r\ndistance from your burg. Seigneur count, hasten to greet him and lead\r\nhim into your seigniorial residence! You hardly expected to hear such\r\nauspicious tidings; moreover your good friend and protector, Bishop\r\nCautin accompanies Prince Chram.\r\n\r\n\"A curse upon the arrival of this Chram,\" said Neroweg. \"However short\r\nthe stay of him and his men at my burg, they will drink up my wine, eat\r\nup all my provisions, and who knows but also pilfer some of my gold and\r\nsilver vases. Neither I nor my companions have any love for these court\r\nleudes, who always have the air of looking down upon us because they\r\nquarter in palaces and cities.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke count Neroweg as, followed by his warriors, he rode out to\r\nmeet Prince Chram, whom he found, together with his suite, within two\r\nbows' shot of the fosse that girded the burg.\r\n\r\nWhat a beautiful, noble, glorious, luminous sight is that of a\r\nlonghaired prince, especially when his hair consists of a long tangled\r\nmop, that scissors have never touched, such being one of the distinctive\r\nattributes of the royal Frankish family. Unfortunately, although still\r\nyoung, Prince Chram, being worn by drunkenness and all manner of\r\nenervating excesses, was almost wholly bald. Only from his neck and\r\ntemples did a few long and straggling locks of light hair tumble down\r\nupon his chest and arched back. His long dalmatica of purple fabric,\r\nslit on the side at the height of his knees, half hid the shoulders and\r\ncrupper of his black horse. Bandelets of gilt leather criss-crossed his\r\ntight-fitting hose from his ankles up to his knees. His spurred shoes\r\nrested upon gilt stirrups; his long gold-hilted sword was sheathed in\r\nwhite cloth and hung from a superbly ornamented belt. In lieu of a whip,\r\nhe carried a cane of precious wood with a head of chiseled gold, upon\r\nwhich, when the worn-out debauchee walked, he leaned heavily. Prince\r\nChram's face was villainous. On his right Bishop Cautin rode as proudly\r\nas a man of war. From time to time the prelate cast an uneasy glance at\r\nChram, because, though he sufficiently detested Chram, he was well aware\r\nthat Chram detested him still more. At the Prince's right rode the \"Lion\r\nof Poitiers,\" the hardened criminal who, together with Imnachair and\r\nSpatachair, both of whom rode close behind him in the second rank,\r\nconstituted a trinity of perdition ample enough to damn Chram, had not\r\nChram been damned in his very mother's womb, as the priests express it.\r\nInsolence and profligacy, haughty disdain and cruelty were so profoundly\r\ngraven on the features of the \"Lion of Poitiers,\" the renegade Gaul,\r\nthat even a hundred years after his death it should not have been\r\ndifficult still to trace upon the bones of his face the words\r\n\"profligacy, insolence and cruelty.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Frankish fashion these three seigneurs wore rich short-sleeved\r\ntunics over their jackets, tight-fitting hose, and gaiters of cured\r\nleather with the fleece on the outside. Behind Chram and his three\r\nfriends rode his seneschal, the count of his stables, the mayor of his\r\npalace, his butler, and other officers of the first rank, because the\r\nPrince kept a royal establishment. A little distance behind these\r\ndistinguished personages came his bodyguard which consisted of leudes\r\nand other warriors armed cap-a-pie. Their tufted casques, their polished\r\nand brilliant cuirasses and greaves glittered in the sun. Their spirited\r\nhorses pranced under their rich caparisons. The streamers at the head of\r\ntheir lances fluttered on the breeze, while their painted and gilded\r\nbucklers dangled from the pommels of their saddles. As showy and\r\nimposing as was the appearance of the princely suite, so miserably\r\nshabby and grotesque was the aspect presented by the leudes of the\r\ncount. A considerable number of his suite wore incomplete and rough,\r\ndented armor; others, the possessors of cuirasses, had their heads\r\ncovered with woolen caps; the swords, no less ill-kept than the\r\ncuirasses, were mostly orphaned of their sheaths, and in several\r\ninstances the implement of war was held to its rider's belt by cords,\r\nwhile the shaft of more than one lance was crooked, and was still as\r\nrough as when first taken from the brush. Most of the horses of the\r\ncount's leudes matched their riders in their appearance. It was not yet\r\nthe hour for the slaves to proceed to the fields, and a goodly number of\r\nNeroweg's companions, in default of battle steeds, sat astride of draft\r\nand plow horses bridled with ropes. By the faith of a Vagre, it was a\r\njoyful sight to watch the wild and envious looks that the leudes of the\r\ncount cast at the suite of Chram, and the insolent and mocking looks\r\nthat the princely retinue threw upon the count's ramshackle troop.\r\nBehind the Prince's men, came the pages, the servants and the slaves who\r\nwere on foot and led the ox-teams and dray-horses that drew heavy laden\r\ncarts which the inhabitants of the regions crossed by the Prince and his\r\nsuite were honored with the privilege of filling up gratuitously.\r\n\r\nCount Neroweg advanced alone on horseback towards his royal guest, who,\r\nreining in his mount, said to Neroweg:\r\n\r\n\"Count, on my way from Clermont to Poitiers, I thought I would stop at\r\nyour burg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your glory is welcome on my domain. It is partly made up of salic\r\nlands; these I hold of my father, who held them both of his sword and\r\nthe bounty of your grandfather, Clovis. It is your right to lodge, when\r\njourneying, at the houses of the counts and beneficiaries of the King,\r\nand to them it is a pleasure to extend to you hospitality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" insolently put in the Lion of Poitiers, \"is your wife young and\r\nhandsome? Is she worth the trouble of courting?\"\r\n\r\n\"My favorite,\" observed Chram, making a sign to the renegade Gaul that\r\nhe moderate his language, \"who asks to know whether your wife is young\r\nand handsome, my favorite, the Lion of Poitiers, loves to joke, by\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall then answer the Lion of Poitiers that neither he nor you will\r\nbe able to decide whether my wife is young and handsome or old and ugly;\r\nshe is with child and unwell, and will not leave her apartments.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your wife is with child,\" replied the Lion of Poitiers, \"who may the\r\nfather be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Count, do not mind his raillery. I told you, my friend is a joker by\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chram, I shall not take offence at the jokes of your favorite. Let us\r\nproceed to the burg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lead the way, count, we shall follow.\"\r\n\r\nThe joint cavalcades started for the burg, and the conversation\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n\"Count, admit to our royal master Chram that, in concealing your wife,\r\nyou keep your treasure under lock and key for fear of its being stolen\r\nfrom you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My favorite, Spatachair, who holds that language to you, Neroweg, is\r\nalso of a humorous disposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prince, meseems you select very gay, and perhaps too bold a set of\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neroweg, you hide your wife from us--it is your right. We shall hunt\r\nher up in her nest--that is our right. There is no lock or key safe\r\nagainst a good thief. The hunt is up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chram, this is another of your humorous friends, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, count, the most humorous of all--the boldest--his name is\r\nImnachair.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my name is Neroweg; I shall ask seigneur Imnachair what will the\r\nthief do when he has found the nest and the dove?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neroweg, your wife will tell you all about it, after we shall have\r\ndiscovered the belle--we shall put our hands on that treasure as surely\r\nas I am the Lion of Poitiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" cried Neroweg, \"as surely as I am the King's count in this\r\ncountry of Auvergne, shall kill like a dog or a prowling fox whomever\r\nwould attempt the role of a lion in my house!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, oh, count, you hold bold language! Is it the brilliant army which\r\nyou lead at your heels that makes you so audacious?\" queried the\r\nPrince's favorite, nodding towards Neroweg's ramshackle leudes. \"If that\r\nband is up to its looks, we are lost!\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the count's leudes who had been drawing nearer, and\r\nheard the insolent jokes of Chram's favorite grumbled aloud in angry\r\naccents:\r\n\r\n\"We do not like to see Neroweg bantered!\"\r\n\r\n\"A count's leudes are matches for royal leudes!\"\r\n\r\n\"The polish of the steel does not make its temper.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Chram's men turned towards his companions, and laughing, pointed\r\nat the count's people with the tip of his lance while sarcastically\r\nalluding to their rustic appearance:\r\n\r\n\"Are these plow-slaves disguised as warriors, or warriors disguised as\r\nplow-slaves?\"\r\n\r\nThe royal cortege answered the sally with a loud outburst of laughter.\r\nThe two sides were beginning to cast defiant looks at each other when\r\nBishop Cautin cried:\r\n\r\n\"My dear sons in Christ, I, your bishop and spiritual father, recommend\r\nto you coolness and good will. A truce with unseasonable jokes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said Chram to Neroweg flippantly, \"mistrust this profligate and\r\nhypocritical bishop. Do not bestow upon him alone the privilege of\r\nsinging your wife's praises--holy man though he be, he would as leave\r\nsing the praises of Venus, the goddess of the pagans!\"\r\n\r\n\"Chram, I am the servant of the son of our glorious King Clotaire; but\r\nas bishop I am entitled to your respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right; nowadays you bishops have become almost as powerful, and\r\nabove all as rich as ourselves, the Kings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chram, you mention the power and the wealth of the bishops of Gaul. You\r\nseem to forget that our power is of the Lord, and our riches are the\r\ngoods of the poor!\"\r\n\r\n\"By the slack skin of all the purses that you have rifled, you fat\r\nweasel who suck the yellow of the eggs and leave only the shell to the\r\nsots, for once you have told the truth. Aye, your riches are the goods\r\nof the poor, but you have bagged these goods for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glorious Prince, I have accompanied you to the burg of my son in\r\nChrist, Count Neroweg, in order to fulfill the act of high justice that\r\nyou know of, but not in order to allow our holy Catholic and apostolic\r\nreligion to be impudently made sport of in my person!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I maintain that your power and riches increase by the day. I have\r\ntwo daughters; who knows but they will yet see the royal power shrink in\r\neven measure as the grasping usurpations of the bishops, with whom we\r\nshared our conquest, gain ground--a parcel of bishops whom we enriched,\r\nto whom we have been the men at arms, and who are ungrateful towards\r\ntheir benefactors!\"\r\n\r\n\"Men at arms to us, men of peace? You err, O, Prince! Our only arms are\r\nsermons and exhortations.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when the people laugh at your sermons, as the Visigoths did, the\r\nArians of Provence and Languedoc, then you send us to extirpate their\r\nheresy with fire and sword! Those are your real arms!\"\r\n\r\n\"Glory to God! In those wars against the heretics, the Frankish Kings\r\ntook an immense booty, they caused the orthodox faith to triumph, and\r\nsnatched the souls of men from the everlasting flames by leading them\r\nback to the bosom of the holy Church.\"\r\n\r\nHe who might have assisted at the recent supper at the episcopal villa,\r\nwhere the bishop had Neroweg for his guest, would not have recognized\r\nCautin. The holy man, being then in _tete-a-tete_ with the count, a\r\nstupid, brutal and blind believer, cared not to clothe himself in the\r\ndignity of language. But now, in the presence of Chram, a brazen jester\r\nwhom he detested, he felt the need to impose, both with language and\r\nbearing, respect and fear, if not upon the Prince himself and his\r\nfavorites, the latter of whom were as impudent as himself, then at least\r\nupon their suite, who were infinitely less intelligent and\r\nproportionally devout. There was another grave apprehension that weighed\r\nupon Cautin's mind. He was in great fear that the audacious example of\r\nChram and his friends might shake the naïve and fruitful credulity of\r\nNeroweg, from which Cautin drew much profit by the cultivation and\r\nexploitation of the devil. From the corner of his eye the bishop saw the\r\ncount give a sly ear to the insolent jests of Chram, which seemed at\r\nonce to please and frighten him. The Prince doubtlessly was wondering\r\nwhether Neroweg was blockish enough to believe in the miraculous powers\r\nof the bishop, and to pay as dearly as he was reputed to do for the\r\nabsolutions of the prelate. Cautin, being a man of extraordinary\r\nability, saw his opportunity to strike a master blow. Being in the habit\r\nof closely watching the weather and of observing the premonitions of the\r\nstorms that are so sudden and of frequent occurrence in mountainous\r\ncountries, he, as well as so many other priests, utilized his\r\nweather-wisdom to frighten the simple-minded. The prelate had for some\r\nlittle time noticed a black cloud, which, barely visible at first over\r\nthe crest of a peak in the distant horizon, was bound soon to spread\r\nover the sky and darken the sun, which, at the moment, was shining\r\nbrilliantly. Accordingly, at the first fresh insolent jest on the part\r\nof Chram at the impositions practiced by the clergy, the prelate\r\nanswered, measuring the length of his words with the progress made by\r\nthe spreading storm-cloud:\r\n\r\n\"It is not for an unworthy servant of God, for a humble earth worm like\r\nme, to defend the Church of the Eternal; the Lord has His own power and\r\nmiracles with which to convince the incredulous, His celestial\r\npunishments with which to chastise the impious. Woe, I say, unto the man\r\nwho dares now, in the face of that sun that shines at this moment with\r\nsuch vivid luster over our heads,\" the bishop proceeded with ever louder\r\nvoice; \"woe, I say, and malediction unto him who, in the face of the\r\nAlmighty, Who sees, hears, judges and punishes us; malediction upon him\r\nwho dares insult His divinity in the sacred person of His bishops! Is\r\nthere any present, Prince or seigneur, who dares outrage divine\r\nmajesty?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is here the Lion of Poitiers, who makes you this answer: Cautin,\r\nbishop of Clermont, I shall break my switch over your back if you do not\r\nquit speaking with such insolence.\"\r\n\r\nBy the faith of a Vagre! The Lion of Poitiers, the renegade Gaul, had\r\nsome occasional good quality. But his bold words caused most of those\r\nwho heard them to shudder; the royal suite as well as the leudes of the\r\ncount looked scandalized. To these faithful it seemed a monstrous thing\r\nto break a switch over the back of a bishop, even if, as in the instance\r\nof Cautin, he was guilty of burying a human being alive in the sepulchre\r\nof a corpse.[A] A profound stupor succeeded upon the threat made by the\r\nLion of Poitiers. Even Chram himself looked shocked at the audacity of\r\nhis favorite. Cautin took in the scene at a glance. Simulating a saintly\r\nhorror and turning full towards the Lion of Poitiers, who defiantly\r\nswung his switch, the prelate cried, raising his hands heavenward:\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy, impious man, have pity upon yourself! The Lord has heard your\r\nblasphemy. Behold how the skies darken--the sun hides its face--behold\r\nthe precursors of celestial wrath! Down on your knees, my dear sons!\r\nDown on your knees! Your father in God bids you! Pray the Eternal to\r\nappease His wrath, kindled by the frightful blasphemy!\"\r\n\r\n[A] Bishop Gregory of Tours. Histoire des Franks, IV. 12.\r\n\r\nAnd Cautin precipitately descended from his horse. But he did not kneel.\r\nStanding erect with his hands outstretched to heaven, in the posture of\r\na priest officiating at the altar, he seemed to be communing with some\r\ninvisible being as if conjuring away the celestial wrath.\r\n\r\nAt the bishop's voice, Chram's servants and slaves, all of whom were\r\nterrified by the seemingly sudden storm, threw themselves upon their\r\nknees; most of the Prince's cortege likewise leaped down from their\r\nhorses and knelt, in no less consternation than the slaves and servants\r\nat the sight of the sun's face suddenly darkened when the Lion of\r\nPoitiers threatened the bishop with his switch. Neroweg, who was one of\r\nthe first on his knees, unctuously smote his chest; Chram, however,\r\ntogether with his favorites and a few others of his familiars, kept\r\ntheir saddles, hesitating out of pride to follow the bishop's orders.\r\nWith an imperious gesture and threatening accent the latter cried:\r\n\r\n\"Down on your knees, O King! The King is no more than the slave in the\r\neye of the Almighty. Both King and slave must bow down to earth in order\r\nto appease the wrath of the Eternal. Down on your knees, O King! Down on\r\nyour knees, both you and your favorites!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dare you issue orders to me?\" cried Chram pale with rage at the sight\r\nof the abject submission of his men to the bishop's orders. \"Who is\r\nmaster here, you or I, insolent priest?\"\r\n\r\nA thunder clap that reverberated in the hollows of the mountain closed\r\nthe mouth of Chram, and served the knavery of Cautin to perfection.\r\nLouder and more imperiously than before the prelate repeated:\r\n\r\n\"Down on your knees! Hear you not the thunder of heaven, the rumbling\r\nvoice of the Almighty? Will you draw down a shower of fire upon the\r\nheads of us all? O, Lord, have pity upon us! Remove the cataracts of\r\nburning lava, that, in Your wrath at the impious, You are about to\r\nshower down upon them, and, perhaps, upon us also, miserable sinners\r\nthat we all are! Even the purest of heart can not claim to be\r\nirreproachable before Your majesty, O, Lord!\"\r\n\r\nSeveral fresh claps of thunder, preceded by blinding flashes of\r\nlightning, carried the fright of Chram's suite to the highest pitch. The\r\nPrince himself did not remain wholly unaffected, despite his innate\r\nincredulity, audacity and superb insolence. His pride nevertheless still\r\nrevolted at the idea of yielding to the bishop's orders, and murmurs, at\r\nfirst subdued, but speedily breaking out in open threats, rose from all\r\nparts of his suite, cortege and retinue.\r\n\r\n\"Down on your knees, our Prince--on your knees!\"\r\n\r\n\"Insignificant as we are, we do not wish to burn in the fire of heaven\r\nfor the sake of your and your favorite's impiousness!\"\r\n\r\n\"Down on your knees, our Prince! Down on your knees! Obey the orders of\r\nthe holy bishop--it is the Lord who speaks to us through his mouth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Down on your knees, King! Down on your knees!\"\r\n\r\nChram was forced to yield. He feared to irritate his followers beyond\r\nthe point of safety; above all, he feared setting a public example of\r\nrebellion against the bishops, who were such useful props to the\r\nconquerors. Grumbling and blaspheming between his teeth, Chram finally\r\nand slowly alighted from his horse and motioned his two favorites\r\nImnachair and Spatachair, both of whom took the hint, to do as he did,\r\nand drop down upon their knees.\r\n\r\nLeft alone on horseback, and looking down upon the prostrate crowd, the\r\nLion of Poitiers braved the increasingly loud clatter of the thunder\r\npeals with intrepid front and a sardonic smile upon his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Down on your knees!\" cried several voices in towering anger. \"Down on\r\nyour knees, Lion of Poitiers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our King Chram has knelt down, and the impious man, the cause of all\r\nthe trouble through his sacrilegious threats, he alone refuses\r\nobedience!\"\r\n\r\n\"The blasphemer will draw a deluge of fire upon our heads!\"\r\n\r\n\"My sons, my dear sons!\" cried Cautin, who was the only one on foot, as\r\nthe Lion of Poitiers was the only one on horseback. \"Let us prepare for\r\ndeath! A single grain of darnel will suffice to rot a muid of wheat--a\r\nsingle hardened sinner will, perhaps, cause the death of us all, however\r\ninnocent we be. Let us resign ourselves to our fate, my dear sons--may\r\nthe will of God be done--He will, perhaps, open to us the doors of\r\nparadise!\"\r\n\r\nThe terrified crowd began to utter increasingly angry cries at the Lion\r\nof Poitiers. Neroweg, in whose bosom still rankled the insulting jests\r\nof the insolent royal favorite, half rose, drew his sword and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Death to the impious wretch! His blood will appease the wrath of the\r\nEternal!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Death!\" came from a crowd of furious voices, so loud that the\r\nrattle of the thunder failed to drown the human explosion.\r\n\r\nOverhead the sky looked like one sheet of flame; the flashes of\r\nlightning succeeded one another rapidly, vivid, blinding. The bravest\r\ntrembled; Prince Chram himself began to regret his jests and sneers at\r\nthe bishop. Seeing that the Lion of Poitiers remained unperturbed, and\r\nthat he answered Neroweg's threats and the furious outcries of the crowd\r\nwith a look of disdain, the Prince said to his favorite:\r\n\r\n\"Come down from your horse and kneel beside us--if you refuse, I shall\r\nlet them cut you to pieces--never have I witnessed such a storm. You\r\nwere wrong in threatening the bishop with your switch; I myself regret\r\nhaving used offensive language towards him--the fire of heaven may from\r\none moment to the other drop down upon us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lion of Poitiers crimsoned with rage, but realizing the fate that\r\nfurther resistance on his part would draw upon him, he yielded. Grinding\r\nhis teeth, he followed the orders of Chram, alighted from his horse, and\r\nafter a further instant of hesitation, dropped upon his knees and shook\r\nhis fist at Cautin. The bishop, who had remained erect, towering above\r\nthe cowering crowd at his feet, answered the gesture of the Lion of\r\nPoitiers with a look of triumph that he cast upon Chram and his\r\nfavorites; he regaled his eyes by letting them wander over the Prince,\r\nhis favorites, the assembled leudes, the servants and slaves--all bowed\r\ndown to the earth with fear and respect before him. Relishing his signal\r\nvictory he said to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we triumph! Yes, royal stripling, the bishop is mightier than\r\nyou. There you are at my feet with your forehead in the dust.\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop then knelt down himself and cried out aloud in a penetrating\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"Glory to Thee, O Lord! Glory to Thee! The impious rebel, seized with\r\nholy terror bows down his haughty forehead. The devouring lion has\r\nbecome the most timid lamb before Thy divine majesty. Calm Thy just\r\nwrath, O Lord! Have mercy upon us all, here upon our knees before Thee!\r\nDissipate the darkness that obscures the firmament! Remove the fiery\r\nclouds that the obduracy of a sinner drew over our heads! Deign, O\r\nAlmighty Lord to give a public manifestation that the voice of Thy\r\nunworthy servant has reached Thy throne!\"\r\n\r\nThe prelate said many more admirable things, now measuring and grading\r\nhis utterances of grace and mercy according as the storm receded and\r\nsubsided, just as, at its approach, he modulated his threatening words.\r\nThe skilful man closed his conjuration to the roll of the receding\r\nthunder--\"the last rumblings,\" he said \"of the Eternal's angered voice,\"\r\nfinally appeased by his prayers. Soon thereupon the sky cleared; the\r\nclouds dispersed, the sun shone anew in all its pristine splendor; and\r\nthe royal cortege, now again as serene as the sky, resumed their tramp\r\ntowards the burg of Neroweg singing at the top of their voices:\r\n\r\n\"Glory, eternal glory to the Lord!\"\r\n\r\n\"Glory, glory, our blessed bishop!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hosanna! _Gloria in excelsis Deo!_\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord miraculously turned from us the angry fire of heaven!\"\r\n\r\n\"The impious man bowed down his rebellious head!\"\r\n\r\n\"Glory! Glory to the Lord!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nIN THE TREASURE CHAMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the slaves of Chram were busy leading the horses to the stables,\r\nand placing the loaded carts and the saddles under the shelter of a\r\nbroad shed that served for cover to large stocks of hay, the royal\r\nleudes ate and drank with the appetite and thirst of men who were on the\r\nroad since early morn. Having, together with his three favorites, done\r\nhonor to the count's repast, Chram said to Neroweg:\r\n\r\n\"Take me to a place where we can talk privately. You surely have some\r\nsecret chamber where you keep your treasure--let us closet ourselves\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nNeroweg seemed in no haste to comply. Doubtlessly he was not\r\nover-anxious to introduce the son of his King into the secret retreat.\r\nNoticing the count's hesitation, Chram proceeded to say:\r\n\r\n\"If there is another apartment in your burg that is more secluded than\r\nyour treasure chamber, it will suit me better. Your wife's chamber,\r\nperhaps? Let us go there.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--no. Come to my treasure chamber. But first wait till I have issued\r\nthe necessary orders so that your people may not want for anything and\r\nthe horses be properly tended.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this Neroweg took one of his leudes aside and whispered to him:\r\n\r\n\"Ansowald, you and Bertefred will arm yourselves well and remain near\r\nthe door of the apartment into which I am to go with Chram. Hold\r\nyourselves in readiness to run in at my first call.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you fear, seigneur count?\"\r\n\r\n\"The family of Clovis has a strong liking for other people's goods.\r\nAlthough my coffers are under triple locks and ribbed with iron, I like\r\nto feel that you and Bertefred are ready at the door with your hands on\r\nyour swords.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall do as you bid us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Order Rigomer and Bertechram to hold themselves equally well armed at\r\nthe door of the women's apartment. Let them strike without mercy\r\nwhomsoever should attempt to introduce himself into Godegisele's\r\nchamber. Let them immediately give the alarm. I mistrust the Lion of\r\nPoitiers. Neither do I take the other two favorites of Chram to be less\r\npagan or less dissolute than the wild lion himself. I hold them capable\r\nof anything--just as their royal master. Did you count the number of\r\narmed men in Chram's suite?\"\r\n\r\n\"He brought in only one-half of his leudes--his _antrustions_, as the\r\nhaughty crew style themselves. They look down with contempt upon us\r\nbecause they are pursuivants of a King.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shortly ago as they were at table,\" put in Bertechram, \"they affected\r\nto eat with disgust and they examined the bottom of the pots as if to\r\nmake sure that they were clean. They do not cease sneering at our\r\nearthen and tin wares--especially at our kitchen utensils.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know--I know--they want to drive me to exhibit my gold and silver\r\nwares, many a piece of which they will purloin. But I am on my guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neroweg, blood may yet flow before evening if the insolent fellows do\r\nnot desist from their impertinencies. Our patience is near the end of\r\nits tether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, however, we, your faithful leudes, together with the\r\nfootmen and the slaves whom we can safely arm, are as numerous as the\r\nmen who compose the escort of Chram.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, my good companions; do not heat yourselves, my friends. If\r\nany quarrels should break out at table, dishes will be broken, and they\r\nwill have to be replaced. We must bear that in mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neroweg, honor is before dishes--even if the dish be of gold or\r\nsilver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, but it is unnecessary to provoke a quarrel. Keep yourselves\r\non your guard, and see to it that watch is kept at the door of the\r\nwomen's apartment--hand on sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be done as you order.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later Prince Chram and the count found themselves alone in the\r\nlatter's treasure room. They were engaged in an important and serious\r\nconference.\r\n\r\n\"Count, how much are the treasures worth that are locked in these\r\ncoffers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they do not contain much--they are large on the principle that it\r\nis always well to be provided with a large pot and a big coffer, as we\r\nsay in Germany, but they are almost empty.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse, count. I wished to double, triple and even quadruple\r\nthe value of their contents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you jesting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Count, I desire to increase your power and wealth beyond even your\r\nhopes. I swear as much by the indivisible Trinity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I then believe you. After this morning's miracle, you would not dare to\r\nrisk drawing upon my house the fire of heaven, by taking so redoubtable\r\nan oath in vain. But what is your reason for wishing to add so greatly\r\nto my power and wealth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have a personal interest in so doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You convince me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to have domains as vast as those of a King's son?\"\r\n\r\n\"I surely would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to have, instead of those half empty coffers, a hundred\r\nothers bursting with gold, precious stones, vases, goblets, bowls,\r\narmors and costly fabrics?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you, instead of being count of a city in Auvergne, govern a whole\r\nprovince--in short, be as rich and powerful as you could wish?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the indivisible Trinity, are you serious? Explain yourself; I drink\r\nin your words.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear to you by the Almighty God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you also swear by the great St. Martin, my patron saint?\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear it also by the great St. Martin that my tender is serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, to the point. What is your project?\"\r\n\r\n\"At this hour my father Clotaire is outside of Gaul warring against the\r\nSaxons. I propose to profit by his absence and make myself King in the\r\nplace of my father. Several counts and dukes of the neighborhood have\r\nentered into the conspiracy. Will you be with or against me?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what about your brothers, Charibert, Gontran, Chilperic and\r\nSigebert? Will they leave your father's kingdom to you alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall have all my brothers killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clovis, your grandfather, as well as his sons, all rid themselves of\r\ntheir nearest relatives in the same fashion. You would be proceeding\r\naccording to the traditions of your house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Answer, count; will you pledge yourself by a sacred oath to combat on\r\nmy side at the head of your men? If you will, then, by an equal oath, I\r\nshall pledge myself to make you duke of whatever province you may\r\nchoose, and to relinquish to you the goods, treasures, slaves and\r\ndomains of the richest seigneurs who may have sided with my father\r\nagainst me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you demand of me, if I understand you rightly, is that I pledge\r\nmyself, in my own name and the name of my leudes and pursuivants, to\r\n_obey your mouth_, as we express it in Germany?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is my demand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what fate do you reserve for your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"His own bodyguard came near cutting him to pieces just before the war\r\nwith the Saxons. Are you aware of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a rumor did reach us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, my plan is to have my brothers killed; to declare that my\r\nfather died in the war with the Saxons; and then to pronounce myself\r\nKing of Gaul in his place.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when he returns from Saxony with his army, what will you do then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall take the field against him at the head of my leudes, and I\r\nshall kill him--just as he killed his nephews.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking of what may happen to me. If in the war with your father\r\nyou go down, and I am found mixed up in the affair--it will go ill with\r\nme. I would then be stripped as a traitor of all the lands that I hold\r\nin _benefice_, only my salic lands would be left to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you expect to win in a game without taking any risks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would much prefer that! But listen, Chram. Let the counts and dukes\r\nof Poitou, Limousin and Anjou take your side against your father, then I\r\nand my leudes will _obey your mouth_. But I shall not openly declare\r\nmyself in your favor until the others shall have first taken up arms\r\nopenly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wish to play a safe game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I wish to risk little and gain much--I sincerely admit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well--then let us exchange pledges.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment, King; we shall swear upon a sacred relic.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing? Why open that coffer? Leave the lid up so that I\r\nmay see your treasures. By my royal hair, I never in my life have seen a\r\nmore magnificent Bible case than this!\" exclaimed Chram as Neroweg\r\nlifted the precious Bible case from the coffer. \"It is all gold, rubies,\r\npearls and carbuncles. From what pillage did you get that?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a city of Touraine. The gospels within are all written out in gold\r\nletters.\"\r\n\r\n\"The case is superb. I am dazzled by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"King, we shall take our pledge upon these gospels.\"\r\n\r\n\"I consent. Well, then, upon these holy Gospels, I, Chram, son of\r\nClotaire, swear by the indivisible Trinity and by the great St. Martin,\r\nand according to the formula consecrated in Germany, that, 'if you,\r\nNeroweg, count of the city of Clermont in Auvergne, yourself and your\r\nleudes, who once stood on the side of the King, my father, will now come\r\nover to the side of me, Chram, who propose to constitute myself King\r\nover you, and that if I do so constitute myself, I shall make you duke\r\nof some great province of your own choice, and shall give you the\r\ndomains, houses, slaves and treasures of the richest of the seigneurs\r\nwho may have stood by my father and against me. Amen.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, Neroweg, count of the city of Clermont in Auvergne, swear on\r\nthese Gospels, by the indivisible Trinity and the great St. Martin, that\r\nif the counts and dukes of Poitou, Limousin and Anjou, instead of\r\ncontinuing as heretofore on the side of your father, openly go over to\r\nyour side, and in arms, for the purpose of establishing you, Chram, as\r\nKing over them, then I together with my men, will do likewise in order\r\nthat you may be established King over us. And may I be consigned to the\r\neternal fires if I fail in my oath! Amen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And may I, Chram, be consigned to the eternal fires if I fail in my\r\noath! It is sworn before God.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is sworn before the great St. Martin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, count, allow me to examine this magnificent Bible case. Count,\r\nI have never seen anyone comparable with you for the quickness with\r\nwhich you open and close a coffer. Our oath now binds us together, and I\r\ncan speak to you plainly. The first thing that I now have to do is to\r\nrid myself of my four brothers, Gontran, Sigebert, Chilperic and\r\nCharibert.\"\r\n\r\n\"The glorious Clovis, your grandfather, always proceeded in that\r\nfashion when he thought proper to join some new kingdom or other\r\nheritage to his possessions. He always killed first and seized\r\nafterwards. He then had no adversary to combat.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father Clotaire has also been of that opinion. He began by killing\r\nthe children of his brother Clodomir, whereupon he seized their\r\nheritage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Others, like your uncle Theodorik, on the contrary, seized first, and\r\nthen sought to kill--that was unskilful. A corpse is more easily\r\nplundered than a live body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count, you are endowed with the wisdom of a Solomon; but I can not kill\r\nmy brothers myself. Two of them are very strong men, while I am rather\r\nfeeble and worn out. Moreover, they will not willingly furnish me with\r\nthe opportunity. They mistrust me. I have fixed upon three determined\r\nmen to commit the murders; they are men that I can reckon with. I need a\r\nfourth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we find him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here--in the country of Auvergne.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my burg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; perhaps in your own house.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the reason why Bishop Cautin has been anxious to accompany\r\nme to this place?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is that the bishop is in great hurry to try, sentence and witness\r\nthe execution of the Vagres and their accomplices who are held prisoners\r\nin the _ergastula_ of this burg--above all because he wishes to witness\r\nthe execution of the bishopess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still do not understand you, Chram. The two criminals, together with\r\nthe women who are their accomplices, are to be taken to Clermont, so\r\nsoon as they shall have recovered from their wounds, to be tried there\r\nby the _curia_.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to the reliable rumors that have reached us, the bishop\r\nfears, and not without good reason, that the populace of Clermont may\r\nrise in revolt in order to set the bandits free the moment they arrive\r\nin the city of Clermont. The names of the hermit laborer and Ronan the\r\nVagre are dear to the race of slaves and vagabonds. It would be just\r\nlike them to raise a riot and seek to set the bandits free--while here,\r\nat the burg, nothing of the sort need be feared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such an uprising would be serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised Bishop Cautin that, if you consent, then I, Chram, now King\r\nin Auvergne in my father's name, shall issue orders that the criminals\r\nbe tried, sentenced and executed here at this burg, before your own\r\njusticiary _mahl_.\"\r\n\r\n\"If my good father Cautin thinks so, I shall accept his opinion. I am as\r\ndesirous as himself to witness the execution of those bandits, and I\r\nwould sooner give twenty gold sous than see them escape death, a thing\r\nthat, as you say, might happen if they are taken to Clermont and the\r\nvile population of the city should rise in their favor. But what has\r\nthis to do with the murder of your brothers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Ronan the Vagre healed of his wounds? I understand he is. He has the\r\nreputation of being a resolute bandit.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a demon--a prop of hell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose that after that demon shall have been sentenced to some\r\nfrightful death he were told: 'You shall have grace, you shall be set\r\nfree, but upon condition that you kill a certain person--after the\r\nmurder is committed you will receive twenty gold sous for your\r\nreward'--do you think he would refuse such an offer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chram, that devil of a Ronan and his band killed nine of my bravest\r\nleudes; they pillaged and set fire to the episcopal villa and the place\r\nis to be rebuilt at my expense. As sure as the great St. Martin is in\r\nparadise, the cursed Vagre shall not be set free, he shall not escape\r\nthe death that his crimes deserve!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who says otherwise?\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak of granting him grace.\"\r\n\r\n\"But after he shall have committed the murder, then, instead of counting\r\nout twenty gold sous to the Vagre, twenty blows with an iron bar will be\r\ncounted out on his back, after which he can be quartered or otherwise\r\ndisposed of in short order. Ah, that seems to amuse you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I laugh because it reminds me of the swindling baldrics and necklaces\r\nwith which your grandfather Clovis one day rewarded his accomplices\r\nafter they dispatched the two Ragnacaires. The Vagre will return in\r\norder to receive the twenty gold sous promised to him, instead of which\r\na hundred blows will be bestowed upon him with an iron bar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Determined men are rare. If the Vagre carries his part of the affair to\r\na successful issue, then my four brothers will be dead before the week\r\nis over--their death insures the success of my projects. It is to your\r\ninterest as well as mine that we avail ourselves of the Vagre. So it is\r\nunderstood that you will spare his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about the bishop, who has come to enjoy the sight of the\r\nbandit's death? He will not consent to let the fellow free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cautin will console himself over the Vagre's escape by seeing the\r\nbishopess roast, and the hermit-laborer hang.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose the Vagre promises to commit the murder but fails in\r\ncarrying out his part of the bargain?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the twenty gold sous that he will surely expect to receive after\r\nthe murder is committed?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right--his cupidity will drive him to the deed and insure his\r\nreturn. But how is his flight to be connived at?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can convene your _mahl_ within two hours. The culprits can be tried\r\nand sentenced at one session.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that can all be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day the trial and sentence--to-morrow the execution. Between now and\r\nto-morrow we have the night left. You will have the Vagre led out of the\r\n_ergastula_ after dark, and taken to Spatachair, one of my favorites.\r\nLeave the rest to me. To-morrow we shall say to the bishop: 'The Vagre\r\nhas fled'--why do you laugh, Count Neroweg?\"\r\n\r\n\"At that Vagre who will be thinking that he is to gain twenty gold sous,\r\nand who will receive instead a hundred blows with an iron bar, and then\r\nbe quartered.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you see, count, your vengeance will lose nothing by the arrangement,\r\nwhile it will insure the success of our plans. Unless I could speedily\r\nfind a fourth determined man, as the Vagre, there would always be a\r\nbrother left who might lay claim to my father's kingdom. Answer, are we\r\nagreed upon the Vagre's flight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--we are agreed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly your _mahl_ is to be convened within two hours in order to\r\nproceed to the trial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Within two hours it will be in session.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, Neroweg, count of the city of Clermont--but duke to be of\r\nTouraine, and one of the richest and most powerful seigneurs, made such\r\nby the friendship of Chram, King of all Gaul, after the death of his\r\nfather and all his brothers! Adieu!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE BEAR OF MONT-DORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun is sinking behind the western mountain range. Night is\r\napproaching. A man, grey of hair and beard and of about fifty-eight to\r\nsixty years of age, but still as alert and vigorous as at the springtide\r\nof life, clad in a Gallic blouse, a wallet over his shoulder, a fur cap\r\non his head, and travel-stained shoes, issues from the forest. He is on\r\nthe road that leads to the burg of Count Neroweg. The appearance of the\r\ngrey-bearded man suggests a mountebank, one of the class that travels\r\nfrom city to city and village to village exhibiting trained animals. On\r\nhis back he carries a cage with a monkey and, held to a long iron chain,\r\nhe leads a large-sized bear, that, however, seems to be a peaceful\r\ntraveling companion. He follows his master with as much docility as a\r\ndog. The mountebank stops for a moment at an elevated part of the\r\nmountainous road from where the plain and the hill on which the burg is\r\nbuilt can be seen. Two slaves with shaven heads, and bending under the\r\nweight of a heavy load which they carry suspended from an oar the ends\r\nof which rest on their shoulders, appear in view. They are proceeding\r\nalong a path, which, a few paces ahead of him, runs into the road on\r\nwhich the mountebank is walking. He hastens his steps in order to fall\r\nin with the slaves, but these, frightened at the sight of the bear\r\nwabbling behind his master, suddenly stop short.\r\n\r\n\"Friends, you need not fear; my bear is not wicked; he is quite tame.\"\r\n\r\nHe thereupon called to his bear as he pulled in the animal's chain, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Come to me, Mont-Dore!\"\r\n\r\nThe bear promptly obeyed the call, drew near and modestly sat down on\r\nhis haunches; he then raised his head submissively up to his master,\r\nwho, as he stood before the animal, half hid him from the slaves.\r\nFeeling reassured, the latter resumed their way and, out of prudence,\r\nwalked a few paces ahead of the mountebank at what they considered a\r\nsafe distance from the bear.\r\n\r\n\"Friends, what large residence is that which I see yonder, girt by a\r\nfosse?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the burg of our master, Count Neroweg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he at the burg to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is in royal company.\"\r\n\r\n\"In royal company?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chram, the son of the King of the Franks, arrived there this morning\r\nwith his bodyguard; we come from the pond where we caught this mess of\r\nfish for to-night's supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"As true as my beard is grey that is a good windfall for a poor man like\r\nme. I shall be able to amuse the noble seigneurs exhibiting my bear and\r\nmonkey to them. Do you believe, my children, that I shall be allowed\r\nadmission to the burg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we do not know. Strangers are not usually allowed to cross the\r\nfosse of the burg, without special permission from the seigneur count.\r\nThe draw-bridge is guarded by day, and raised at night.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, last winter, I know, another exhibitor of trained animals\r\nvisited the burg, and the seigneur count was greatly entertained with\r\ntheir performances. He may not refuse to tender a similar entertainment\r\nto his royal guest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not. If he does, then the evening's entertainment will help to\r\nwhile away the time of the seigneurs until to-morrow morning's\r\nspectacle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What spectacle is that to be, my friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"The four people who were sentenced to-day will be executed--Ronan the\r\nVagre, the hermit-laborer, a renegade monk who joined the Vagrery; a\r\nlittle female slave, their accomplice; and the bishopess, an accursed\r\nwitch; they say she once was the wife of our blessed bishop Cautin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, have they been capturing Vagres in this region, my friends? And so\r\nthey were all sentenced to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"The _mahl_ assembled at noon. The King's son and our holy bishop were\r\npresent. Ronan the Vagre and the hermit-laborer were first put to the\r\ntorture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they must have denied that they had run the Vagrery, did they?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Ronan, the accursed bandit, on the contrary, boasted that he was a\r\nVagre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, the torture?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just what the son of the King said. He thought that the torture\r\nhad no purpose with Ronan. He opposed it strongly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But our holy bishop,\" explained the other slave, \"declared that a truth\r\nextracted by torture was doubly certain, it being in the nature of a\r\njudgment of God. Thereupon no one raised any further objection, and\r\nmatters took their course.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the bishop's orders,\" resumed the first slave, \"the feet of the\r\nVagre and of the hermit-laborer were dipped into boiling oil--they\r\nconfessed a second time.\"\r\n\r\n\"And thereupon they were both carried back to the _ergastula_, because\r\nthey could not walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to-morrow they will be taken out for execution. It is said that the\r\nmanner of their death will be frightful--but it never could be frightful\r\nenough to atone for the crimes that Ronan the Vagre--\"\r\n\r\n\"And what crimes did he commit, my friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not the sacrilegious wretch, at the head of his band, pillage and\r\nburn down the episcopal villa of our holy bishop?\"\r\n\r\n\"How, my friends, do you mean to say that Ronan the Vagre, the impious\r\nwretch, dared to commit such a crime? And what about the women, were\r\nthey also put to the torture?\"\r\n\r\n\"The little slave is still near death's door of a wound that she\r\ninflicted upon herself in an attempt to commit suicide. She made the\r\nattempt in a fit of despair when she saw that the Vagres were cut to\r\npieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to the witch of a bishopess, they were preparing to apply the\r\ntorture to her, when our holy bishop interposed, saying: 'We must be\r\ncareful not to weaken the witch; she may succumb to the pain; it is\r\nbetter that she remain as strong as possible, in order that she escape\r\nnot one of the torments of to-morrow's execution.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Your bishop is wise, my friends. And where do the bandits await death?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the underground prison of the burg.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that there is no chance of the accursed people escaping!\"\r\n\r\n\"As to Ronan the Vagre and the hermit-laborer, even if they were free,\r\nthey could not walk a step, their feet are all blistered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I forgot that, my friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, the _ergastula_ is made of bricks and Roman cement. The walls\r\nare as hard as rocks. Then, the cave is closed with a row of iron bars,\r\neach as thick as my arm, and it is always guarded by armed sentries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, it is not possible, my friends, for the accursed criminals\r\nto escape execution--they deserve all that they will get! I see that you\r\nare not of the wicked slaves, unfortunately but too numerous, who\r\nsympathize with the Vagres.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Vagres are demons. We would like to see them executed to the last\r\none. They are implacable enemies of the Franks and the holy bishops!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see from your speech that you have a kind master.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is all the better master, his clerk told us, for making us suffer a\r\ngood deal. Sufferings here on earth insure to us paradise after death.\r\nSo we are resigned!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can not escape salvation, my good friends, being animated with such\r\nsentiments. I hope that all your companions at the burg are like you,\r\ngood Christians, resigned to their lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are impious and unbelieving people everywhere. Many of the slaves\r\nat the burg would gladly run the Vagrery if the opportunity were to\r\npresent itself. Some of them do not even respect our holy bishops, sneer\r\nat the priests, hate our seigneurs, the Franks, and object to being\r\nslaves. But we always denounce them to the clerk of our count.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are truly good Christian companions! But are there many such wicked\r\nslaves at the burg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! There may be fifteen or twenty of them among the hundred that\r\nwe are in the domestic service, and I suppose there may be two or three\r\nhundred of them among the four thousand and more colonists and field\r\nslaves whom the count owns on his domains.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good friends, do you know it seems to me that it will bring me good\r\nluck to spend a few hours in a house peopled with such good slaves as\r\nyou are? I wish you would announce me to the count's steward. If the\r\nnoble seigneur is willing to amuse himself with the capers of my bear,\r\nhe will issue orders to admit me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall announce you. The steward will decide.\":\r\n\r\nAnd the two slaves, who, streaming with sweat, had laid down for a\r\nmoment the net in which they carried a mess of large fish, freshly taken\r\nfrom the pond, and some of which were still seen wriggling, through the\r\nmeshes, again lifted up their heavy burden and resumed their way to the\r\nburg.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the two slaves disappeared from sight, the bear raised\r\nhimself on his legs, pulled off his head, dashed it on the road, and\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\"Blood and massacre! They are to burn my beautiful bishopess to-morrow!\r\nAnd Ronan, our brave Ronan, he also is to be executed! Shall we allow\r\nthat, Karadeucq?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall avenge my sons--or shall die beside them! O Loysik! O, Ronan!\r\nTortured! Tortured! And executed to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\n\"As true as the remembrance of the bishopess sets my heart aflame, the\r\ntorture of to-day, the executions of to-morrow, the arrival of that\r\nChram with his armed men--all these events upset our plans. Instead of\r\nbeing taken to Clermont for trial, Ronan and the bishopess are to be\r\nexecuted at the burg to-morrow morning--instead of being healed of their\r\nwounds and able to use their legs, Ronan and his brother are rendered\r\nhelpless. The leudes of Chram, together with those of the count and the\r\nfoot soldiers, constitute a garrison of more than three hundred armed\r\nmen; they occupy the burg--and who is there to set free Ronan and\r\nLoysik, neither of whom can walk, the little dying slave, and my\r\nbeautiful bishopess. Only you and I! Karadeucq, if I can see how we are\r\nto come out of this fix, I shall be willing to become a bear in\r\ntruth--not a trick bear, as now I am, but a real bear! Oh, if anyone had\r\nsaid to me, when, disguised like so many others in some animal form, I\r\ncelebrated the saturnalia of January nights--if anyone had said to me:\r\n'My gay lad, you will celebrate the calends of winter in midsummer,' I\r\nwould have answered: 'Go to, good man, it will be warm, then!' And I\r\nwould have spoken the truth. I would be cooler in an oven than in this\r\nhide! Rage and heat make one swelter. You are silent, my old Vagre--what\r\nare you thinking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"About my children. What is to be done--what is to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am better in action than in council, especially at this moment, when\r\nrage is making me crazy. Poor, brave woman! Burned to-morrow! Oh, how\r\ncame I to be separated from her at the fastness of Allange during the\r\ncombat engaged in by our archers from the branches of the oak trees\r\nagainst the soldiers of the count! Poor, poor woman! I thought she was\r\nkilled! Our rout was complete, it was impossible for me to assure myself\r\nconcerning the fate of my sweetheart! Too happy to be able to escape the\r\nmassacre with a few others of our band, and to dive into the thickest of\r\nthe woods, after giving ourselves one of our haunts, the rocks on the\r\npeak of Mont-Dore, for _rendezvous_--I fled. Finally, after the lapse of\r\na few days, about a dozen of our band met at the appointed place; it was\r\nthere that we met you also in the company of two runaway slaves--you,\r\nour old Vagre, whom we had given up for lost over two years ago. It was\r\nfrom you that we learned of the fate of your two sons, the little slave\r\nand the bishopess. Strange, what sentiments I experience for that brave\r\nwoman! The memory of her never leaves me. My heart breaks with grief at\r\nthe knowledge that she is in the hands of the count and the bishop. In\r\nall Vagrery there is no Vagre more Vagre than myself for a life of\r\nadventures; nevertheless, were some unforeseen accident to cast the\r\nbishopess and myself in some solitary corner of the earth, I believe I\r\nwould live there quietly with her ten, twenty, a hundred years! You\r\nsurely take me for a fool, old Karadeucq, or better yet for a ninny,\r\nseeing that I weep and act stupidly! But, the devil take grief! The hour\r\ncalls for action!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, my sons! my sons!\"\r\n\r\n\"If my skin would save them and the bishopess--I do not mean this\r\nbear-skin, but my own!--by the faith of a Vagre, I would sacrifice it!\r\nYou know that when you laid your plan before us, and that a ready fellow\r\nwas needed to impersonate a bear, I promptly offered myself. I told you\r\nthen how, at Beziers, I was an all the more inveterate disguiser at the\r\ncalends because the priests forbade them; and that at those saturnalia I\r\nespecially impersonated bears, and so well as to be taken for one. I was\r\nthereupon unanimously chosen bear in Vagrery, and--But I suppose you\r\nthink that I am talking too much. It is my only refuge! It diverts me!\r\nIf I remain silent and think, then my heart breaks and I am useless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Loysik! Ronan! executed to-morrow! No--no--heaven and earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may have to be done in order to save your sons, the bishopess\r\nand little Odille, I shall follow you to the end. When it was decided\r\nthat you were to be the mountebank and I the bear, we had to find a\r\ngood-sized bear, and kind enough to let us have his head, jacket and\r\nhose. I took my axe and my knife, and climbed up Mont Dore. Good hunter,\r\ngood hunt. I almost immediately ran across a friend of my size. Probably\r\ntaking me for his comrade, he ran at me, ready to hug me to his heart,\r\nwith his arms--and also his jaws, wide open. Anxious not to injure his\r\ncoat with too many blows of my axe, I stabbed him adroitly in the heart,\r\nafter which I carefully undressed my accommodating friend. His jacket\r\nand hose seemed, by the faith of a Vagre! cut on purpose for me. I\r\njoined you at our haunt, and down we came to the plain, determined to do\r\nanything in order to save your two sons, the little slave and my\r\nbishopess. Let us resume, I am growing more collected--what shall we do?\r\nOur plan was to enter the city of Clermont on the night before the\r\nexecution; we were certain that we could cause a portion of the slaves\r\nto revolt; the people would join and the Vagres were to be ready. That\r\nproject must now be given up, also the idea of lying in ambush on the\r\nroad and attacking the escort that was to take the prisoners to\r\nClermont. Our purpose in entering the burg in our disguise was only to\r\ngather information concerning the time of their departure and the\r\nprobable route that they would take, while ten of our companions were to\r\nwait hidden in the skirts of the forest. Our ten friends are ready,\r\neither to proceed with us to Clermont, or to join us on the road, or\r\neven to approach the fosse of the burg to-night. Shall we give our good\r\nVagres the signal that we agreed upon? To-day's events, to-morrow's\r\nexecutions and the large number of troops gathered in the burg, thwart\r\nall our plans. What is to be done? You have been thinking long, old\r\nVagre--have you decided upon a plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--come, my brave Master of the Hounds!\"\r\n\r\n\"To the burg? But it is still daylight.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be dark before we arrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall tell you on the way. Time presses. Come, come, be quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forward, march! Oh, I forgot--the jacket!\"\r\n\r\n\"What jacket?\"\r\n\r\n\"The one that I must put on for buffoonery--besides it is a prudent\r\nmeasure; the turned-down hood will conceal whatever defect there may be\r\nat the jointure of the fur between my neck and my head. The hood will\r\nalso partially cover my bear face--mayhap the Franks have sharper eyes\r\nthan those two blockheads of slaves. Let us first complete the\r\ndisguise.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the lover of the bishopess spoke, Karadeucq pulled a rolled-up\r\njacket out of his wallet; the false bear put it on; it reached back and\r\ndown to his hind legs, and being pulled well over his head, left only\r\nhis nozzle exposed to view, while the wide sleeves almost reached down\r\nto his clawy paws. The black fur of the belly and thighs remained wholly\r\nuncovered. Nothing could be imagined more grotesque than the bear in his\r\ncostume. By the faith of a Vagre! the animal could not choose but\r\nfurnish subject for laughter to the guests of Neroweg, especially after\r\nthe copious libations of their supper.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Karadeucq, I shall conceal my poniard in one of the folds of the\r\njacket--by the way, it is the very Saxon knife that I picked up as I\r\nfled from the defile of Allange. I picked it up on the field of battle.\r\nYou can see on the hilt of the arm the two Gallic words--'_Friendship_,'\r\n'_Community_'--graven in the iron. 'Friendship'--that is a good omen.\r\nFriendship, as well as Love, leads me to the burg. Blood and massacre!\r\nI shall free at one blow both my friend and my sweetheart!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come! O, Ronan! O, Loysik! I shall save you both--or we shall die\r\ntogether! Come, forward, my brave companion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nIN THE ERGASTULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, more than five hundred years ago, the Romans conquered and owned,\r\nthough they could not subjugate, Gaul they constructed their\r\n_ergastulas_--slave pens--of solid, lasting material. There they locked\r\nup their chained Gallic slaves at night. Such a cave was an adjunct also\r\nto the old Roman camp on which now stood the burg of Neroweg. The bricks\r\nand cement were still so closely joined that they jointly constituted a\r\nbody more solid than marble itself. Hardly could men, equipped with all\r\nthe necessary implements for boring, and working from dawn to dusk,\r\nsucceed in effecting an opening through the wall of this prison. The\r\nopening of the vault was barred by enormous rods of iron. Without, a\r\nstrong body of Franks, armed with axes, were keeping ceaseless watch;\r\nsome were lying on the ground, others walked up and down. From time to\r\ntime these watchmen cast a wistful glance towards the burg, which lay\r\nabout five hundred paces from them. The principal building, however, was\r\nhidden from their view by the gables of the barns and stables that\r\nadjoined the seigniorial mansion from that side.\r\n\r\nWhy did these watchmen cast such wistful glances to the side of the\r\nburg? Because, issuing through the open windows, the cries of the\r\nwassailers, from time to time, also the rattle of drums and blare of\r\nhunting horns, reached their ears. There was a feast in Neroweg's hall.\r\nOn that evening he was entertaining his royal guest Chram at his best.\r\n\r\nAn iron lamp, that swung under the vaulted entrance of the antique\r\n_ergastula_, threw a dim light around the gate of the underground cell\r\nand also partially lighted it within.\r\n\r\nSteps were heard. A leude appeared followed by slaves bearing baskets\r\nand bowls.\r\n\r\n\"Boys! Here's some beer for you, also wine, venison, bread and cheese.\r\nEat, drink and be merry. The son of the King is on a visit at the burg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three cheers for Sigefrid, wine, beer and venison!\"\r\n\r\n\"But keep a close watch on the prisoners--let not one of you step\r\naside--keep your eyes wide open.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, those dogs do not move any more down there than if they had fallen\r\nasleep forever under the cold ground, where they will be to-morrow. You\r\nneed not fear, Sigefrid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Outside of the seigneur King, the bishop or Neroweg, whosoever should\r\napproach the iron railing to speak with the prisoners--\"\r\n\r\n\"Will instantly fall under our axes, Sigefrid--they are sharp and\r\nheavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the slightest event, let the horns blow the alarm--we shall then\r\nimmediately rush to your aid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are all wise precautions, Sigefrid, but superfluous. The bridge\r\nis raised; besides, the slime in the fosse is so deep that anyone trying\r\nto cross it would sink over his head in it. Finally, there are no\r\nstrangers at the burg. Including the King's bodyguard we are more than\r\nthree hundred armed men--who would attempt to free the prisoners under\r\nsuch circumstances? Moreover they are as incapable of walking as a\r\nrabbit whose four paws have been cut off. So you see, Sigefrid, your\r\nprecautions, however wise, are superfluous.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same, keep close watch until to-morrow. It is only one night of\r\nwatch to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we shall spend it merrily, drinking and singing.\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem to be merry in the banquet hall, Sigefrid. Tell us what is\r\ngoing on.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun of May does not more greedily pump up the dew than our topers\r\ndo the full kegs of wine and beer; mountains of victuals vanish in the\r\nabysses of their stomachs--they no longer talk, they yell; a little\r\nlonger they will all be roaring! Chram's leudes at first affected\r\ndaintiness and choice manners; but at this hour they guzzle, swallow and\r\nlaugh like any of us. After all they are good and gay customers; some\r\nlittle jealousy on our part at first irritated us against them; the\r\nrivalry has been drowned in wine. Only shortly ago old Bertefred,\r\nhiccoughing and weeping like a calf, embraced one of the young warriors\r\nof the royal suite, and called him his darling little son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Ha! Ha! That was a droll scene!\"\r\n\r\n\"Finally, in order to complete the scene, I just learn that a mountebank\r\nwith a dancing bear and a monkey has been let into the burg. Neroweg\r\nproposed the amusement to King Chram, and the steward issued orders to\r\nadmit the man and his animals in the banquet hall. They were sent for\r\namid the shouts of glee of the whole convivial party. I want to go back\r\nquick and share the sport.\"\r\n\r\n\"Happy Sigefrid! He will see the gambols of the bear and the grimaces of\r\nthe monkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys, I promise you that after the King has enjoyed himself, I\r\nshall request the count to have the mountebank sent to this part of the\r\nhouse with his animals, so that you also may be amused by him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sigefrid, you are a good companion!\"\r\n\r\n\"But always keep your eyes upon the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be easy! And now to the wine, beer and venison! While we wait for the\r\nman, his bear and monkey, let us empty the pots in honor of the good\r\nKing Chram and of Neroweg! To the assault of the victuals!\"\r\n\r\nThe iron lamp that swung under the vaulted entrance of the antique\r\n_ergastula_ lighted up the group of Franks eating, laughing and drinking\r\nat the entrance. The lamp also threw its ruddy light across the iron\r\nrailing and upon the Gallic prisoners who sat, gathered together, near\r\nthe entrance of the prison, the rear of which remained in deepest\r\ndarkness; nearest to the iron railing lay little Odille; the girl lay on\r\nher back with her arms crossed over her girlish bosom like a corpse\r\nabout to be buried. Indeed the girl's pallor was that of a dying person.\r\nNear her and holding the child's head in her lap sat the bishopess,\r\nstill handsome, although somewhat paler and reduced in flesh; she\r\ncontemplated the girl with the loving eyes of a mother. A few steps away\r\nsat Ronan; his feet were wrapped in rags; his wrists were manacled;\r\nunable either to hold himself on his feet or on his knees he leaned his\r\nback against the underground wall. The Vagre looked at Odille with a\r\ntenderness equal to that of the bishopess. Manacled like his brother,\r\nwhose torture he had shared, the hermit-laborer was seated near Ronan\r\nand seemed deeply moved at the tender care that the bishopess bestowed\r\nupon the young slave girl.\r\n\r\n\"Die, little Odille,\" said Ronan, \"die, my child. It is better far that\r\nyou die of the wound which your brave hand inflicted upon yourself,\r\nwhen, a month ago, you thought I was dead. It is better far that you die\r\nnow, than to be burned alive to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor little one, the strain of this day's experience has exhausted her\r\nstrength! Look, Ronan, her face, alas! grows paler and paler.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us bless this pallor of death, beautiful bishopess; it announces\r\nthe approach of death--a death that will save the poor child the agony\r\nof the burning pyre. Did not her wound already protect her against the\r\nbrutalities of the count and the torture of to-day? Die, die, little\r\nOdille, we shall live again in yonder world. Were I free I would have\r\nmade you my wife for life in Vagrery, if you consented. I have loved you\r\ndearly for your sweetness, your beauty, and the misfortune of the shame\r\nthat you were smitten with so young--an innocent girl even after your\r\ndishonor! Die, little Odille! As sure as I and my brother Loysik will be\r\nexecuted to-morrow I stand in less dread of the agony in store for me\r\nthan of the thought that you are yourself to burn alive! Oh, if my feet\r\nwere not in blisters I would drag myself to your side. Oh, if my hands\r\nwere not manacled I would smother you with a loving hand, as our\r\nmothers, the Gallic women of yore, killed their children in order to\r\nsnatch them from slavery. Beautiful bishopess, could not you, whose arms\r\nare free, gently strangle that poor child? The slender thread of life\r\nthat hardly holds her, would be easily torn!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have thought of that, Ronan, but I lack the courage.\"\r\n\r\n\"But should she unfortunately live till to-morrow, her fate will be\r\nyours. Keep in mind that you will be stripped naked by that band of\r\nFranks, and whipped by them with switches!\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep still, Ronan, shame mantles my cheeks! To me, a woman, that part\r\nof the punishment--to be exposed naked before those men--is the worst!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your husband, the bishop, knew that, just as he was aware that, if you\r\nwere tortured to-day, you would lose some of the strength necessary to\r\nendure to-morrow's punishment to the end, on account of which he spared\r\nyou.--You will both thereupon be impaled. Before impalement, poor dear\r\nvictims, your nipples will be torn from you with burning tongs. Finally\r\nyou will both be thrown upon the pyre with whatever little life may be\r\nstill in you. As you see, the torture is finely graded, and will not\r\nyou, you who have the power, snatch the dear girl from such torment? Oh,\r\nI see, you finally take the decision--your hands are creeping up to\r\nOdille's neck. Courage, no weakness! Remember that our mothers\r\nthemselves put their beloved little ones to death. What! You\r\nhesitate--your hands drop down again! You weep!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not the courage--I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Craven soul!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Ronan, I am no craven. No--were she my daughter I would kill her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. Odille is a stranger to you--you cannot love her enough\r\nto decide to kill her. We must pardon the bishopess for her want of\r\nkindness, not so, Loysik?\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the young slave moved, gave a slight sigh, half raised\r\nher head, her eyes opened and looked around for Ronan. When they finally\r\nfell upon him she said, after a moment, in a weak voice:\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, is the night over, and is it now day?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not the light of day my child; it is the light from the lamp\r\nthat burns outside our prison. Your strength seems exhausted, you were\r\nin a torpor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dreamed a sweet and sad dream. My mother rocked me on her knees\r\nsinging the chant of Hena, and then she said to me weeping: 'Odille, it\r\nis you they are going to burn!' I then woke up and believed it was day.\r\nOh, Ronan, it is a long time till to-morrow! And the execution! The\r\nexecution! How it will be prolonged--unless the pain be so intense that\r\nI die immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will you not regret life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, I tried to kill myself when I thought you were dead; you are\r\nsentenced to death like ourselves; I have neither father nor mother;\r\nwhat should I regret, all the less seeing that we are to live again in\r\nyonder worlds near those whom we have loved? We shall soon meet again.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the faith of a Vagre, what is death, beautiful bishopess? Only a\r\nchange of vestments and lodging. As to the execution, two or three hours\r\nof suffering is the extreme, and the end is certain. Do you know,\r\nLoysik, what grieves me most at this hour? It is to quit this world,\r\nleaving our dearly beloved Gaul forever in the clutches of the Franks\r\nand bishops!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, brother--centuries are centuries to man, they are hardly hours\r\nto mankind in its eternal progress! The world in which we live seems\r\nlarge to us--and yet, what is it, rolling and confounded among the\r\nmyriads of the starry worlds who at this hour of the night glisten in\r\nour eyes from the vast expanse of the vault of heaven--mysterious worlds\r\nin which we are to relive successively, in body and soul, but with\r\nbodies new and evermore repurified! Brother, at the time of the conquest\r\nof Caesar, our ancestors, then enslaved and loaded with chains centuries\r\nago in the very _ergastula_ where we now are, said, perhaps, as you just\r\nnow in despair: 'Our dearly beloved Gaul is forever enslaved to the\r\nRoman conqueror'--and yet not two centuries and a half had passed\r\nbefore, by dint of heroic insurrections against the Romans, Gaul again\r\nwon back, step by step, although paying dearly for it with the blood of\r\nour fathers, the country's rights, liberties, and even final\r\nindependence during the glorious era of Victoria the Great!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Loysik; you are right.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you forget the prophetic vision of that august woman--the vision\r\nthat our ancestor Schanvoch transmitted to us in the narrative of his\r\ndays, and that our father so often told us of?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that vision, Victoria saw Gaul enslaved, exhausted, bleeding,\r\nprostrate and crushed down under heavy burdens, dragging herself along\r\nthe ground under the whip of the Frankish kings and the bishops! And\r\nthen again she saw Gaul free, proud, radiant, trampling under foot the\r\ncollar of slavery, the crown of kings and the tiara of Popes! Gaul then\r\nheld in one hand a bundle of fruits and flowers, in the other a standard\r\nsurmounted by the Gallic cock--the red flag.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, do you fear? Think of the past! First bent down under the\r\nRoman conquest, Gaul re-rises through the courage of her sons and\r\nbecomes again free and redoubtable! Let the past give you faith in the\r\nfuture! Perchance that future is still far away. What is time to us--to\r\nus, who at this supreme moment have but the last few hours of our life\r\nto count! Oh, my brother, I have a profound faith, an invincible faith,\r\nin the final rejuvenation and enfranchisement of Gaul!--centuries are\r\ncenturies to man; they are but instants in the eternal progress of\r\nmankind!\"\r\n\r\n\"Loysik, you reassure me, you confirm my confidence. Aye, I shall leave\r\nthis world with my eyes fixed upon the radiant vision of renascent Gaul!\r\nStill one sorrow I carry with me--our uncertainty regarding the fate of\r\nour father. What may have become of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he still lives, Ronan, may he never know of our end! He loved us so\r\ntenderly--his was a large heart. At a season of national insurrection\r\nand at the head of a province risen in arms, he might have become a hero\r\nlike the Chief of the Hundred Valleys, who was his idol! At the head of\r\na band of men in revolt, our father could be nothing but a chief of\r\nBagauders or Vagres.[B] You know my sentiments with regard to those\r\nterrible reprisals, which, however legitimate they may be, leave only\r\nruins and disaster behind them. But without approving his conduct, I\r\nfeel inclined to acquit him of blame, because his vengeance never smote\r\nbut the wicked.\"\r\n\r\n[B] \"I do not know by what diabolical influence they accomplished it,\r\nbut they seduced in this fashion an immense multitude of men, who set\r\nthemselves to pillaging and despoiling all whom they met on their way,\r\nand distributed their spoils among those who had nothing.\"--Bishop\r\nGregory of Tours. Histoire des Franks, IV., 10.\r\n\r\n\"Brother,\" said Ronan, \"they seem to be in high feather at the burg! Do\r\nyou hear the distant din of their merriment? Oh, by the bones of our\r\nancestor Sylvest, the young and brilliant Roman seigneurs, who, crowned\r\nwith flowers laughed with cruel laughter and careless of the future on\r\nthe gilded balcony of the circus, while their slaves, who were consigned\r\nto the wild beasts, awaited death in the sombre vault of the\r\namphitheatre, just as we to-night await it in this underground\r\nprison--they were also quite hilarious. Aye, those Roman seigneurs were\r\nindeed hilarious; and yet from the depths of their dungeons the Gallic\r\nslaves shook their chains in cadence and sang the prophetic words:\r\n'Flow, flow, thou blood of the captive! Drop, drop, thou dew of gore!\r\nGerminate, sprout up, thou avenging harvest! Hasten, thou mower, hasten!\r\nIt is ripe! Whet your scythe, whet it! Whet your scythe!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nIN THE BANQUET HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeroweg feasted his royal guest Chram at his best. At first he hesitated\r\nto take his gold and silver vessels, the fruit of his ravages, out of\r\nhis coffers and exhibit them on his table. He feared to excite the\r\ncupidity of Chram and his favorites, apprehending that the latter would\r\nindulge their nature for pilfering, or that the former might make some\r\ncovetous demand upon him. In the end, however, yielding to a barbarian's\r\nvanity, the count could not resist the desire to display his wealth\r\nbefore the eyes of his guests. Accordingly, he produced from his ample\r\ncoffers the large amphoras, the goblets, the large bowls, the huge\r\ndishes--all of massive gold or silver, fashioned in the Greek, Roman or\r\nGallic style and as varied as the plunderings from which these riches\r\nproceeded. Among these valuable articles were also several goblets of\r\njasper, of porphyry and of onyx studded with precious stones; there were\r\nalso strewn over the table several hand basins made of rare wood, hooped\r\nin gold and inlaid with carbuncles. But none of these precious articles\r\nwas to be used by the count's guests; the valuables were heaped upon\r\nthe table without order like piles of booty; they were intended merely\r\nto delight the sight or tickle the envy of the guests who could purloin\r\nnone of the articles by reason of the distance at which they were heaped\r\nfrom them upon the vast table of the banquet hall. In front of Prince\r\nChram and Bishop Cautin the count had ordered to be spread in the shape\r\nof a table cloth a bit of purple cloth embroidered in gold and silver\r\nand similar to that which covered their seats. Prince Chram and the\r\nbishop alone were allowed to use a jasper goblet studded with precious\r\nstones. They ate from a dish of solid gold in which the food destined\r\nfor them was spread. The plates before the other guests were of wood,\r\ntin or clay. In order to do further honor to the King's son the count\r\nhad donned over his greasy skin jacket and his leather hose an antique\r\ndalmatica of silver cloth with gold bees embroidered upon it, a present\r\nmade to his father by King Clovis. Around his neck Neroweg wore two\r\nheavy gold chains, on several links of which he had ingeniously fastened\r\na number of earrings intended for women and glistening with precious\r\nstones. A peacock would not have been prouder of its plumage than was\r\nthat Frankish seigneur under his dalmatica and jewels, with his shaven\r\nchin, his long reddish moustache and his yellow hair drawn back and\r\nfastened at the top of his head by a gold bracelet studded with rubies,\r\nfrom which the coarse and unkempt hair fell back over his neck like the\r\ntail of a horse.\r\n\r\nThe aspect presented by the banquet hall matched that of the host. It\r\nwas a mixture of luxury, barbarism, slovenliness and dirt. Around the\r\ntable of rough wood, covered by rich cloth only in front of Chram and\r\nthe bishop, and bearing in its center the heaped-up pile of costly\r\nvessels, ragged slaves moved about under orders of the seneschal, the\r\nsteward, the cup-bearer or other head servants of the count, all clad in\r\nthe skin jackets that they wore in all seasons, and which were as soiled\r\nas otherwise uncouth. The number of torch-bearing slaves intended to\r\nlight the banquet table had been doubled, tripled and quadrupled; the\r\nnumber of barrels set up at the four corners of the hall was likewise\r\nincreased; they were stood up one on top of the other, presenting the\r\nappearance of squatty pillars. In order to reach the higher kegs and\r\nfill up the pots of beer the cup-bearers were compelled to serve\r\nthemselves with a ladder. By this time, however, the upper barrels had\r\nlong been emptied. The old wine of Clermont that they once contained was\r\ncheering, warming and mounting to the heads of the convivial crowd.\r\n\r\nYielding to his natural inclination for carousal, and delighting in\r\nadvance at the prospect of seeing Ronan the Vagre, the hermit-laborer\r\nand the beautiful bishopess executed on the morrow, Bishop Cautin could\r\nhardly keep his seat. He drank, frolicked, bantered and even indulged in\r\nsallies of aggressive sarcasm. Despite his aversion for Chram the bishop\r\ndared not shoot his arrows at him; and he stood in even greater awe of\r\nthe Lion of Poitiers. The Gallic renegade, rancorous as the devil\r\nhimself, had said to the man of God, accompanying the word with the\r\nlooks of an enraged lion: \"You forced me to alight from my horse and\r\nkneel down before you; I shall have my revenge; I shall abide my time.\"\r\nThe real butt of the bishop's sarcasm was Neroweg, habitually stupid and\r\ndumb.\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" Cautin said to him, \"your hospitality comes from an overflowing\r\nheart; of that I am certain; but your food is execrable in its\r\nabundance; it is all meat and fish, boiled and grilled, served in\r\nprofusion but without taste; it is a true barbarian's feast, who lives\r\nupon his flocks, hunting and fishing; there is not here a single\r\nappetite-provoking and delicate dish; we are filled and that is all! I\r\ntake his glory, Prince Chram, for witness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our host and friend does his best,\" said Chram, who, finding his\r\nprojects already somewhat deranged by the torture of Ronan the Vagre,\r\nwas anxious to keep the count in good humor. \"Before the cordial spirit\r\nof Neroweg's hospitality, I think little of the feast itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do think of it, glorious Prince,\" rejoined the bishop. \"I have\r\ntold the count a hundred times that his cooks are detestable; they do\r\nnot know how to prepare the food. Tell me, Neroweg, how much did you pay\r\nfor the slave who is the chief of your kitchen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I paid nothing for him. My leudes found him on the road to Clermont,\r\nthey took him and brought him to me in bonds. Yesterday, however, he had\r\nhis feet burned by the trial of the judgment of God, and his tongue was\r\nafterwards pulled out in punishment for his blasphemies. He must have\r\nbeen indisposed to-day and helped himself with other slaves who are less\r\nskilful than himself in the preparation of food.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I understand! Of course having had his tongue cut out he was not\r\nable to taste the sauces; but he is nevertheless a wretched cook. And I\r\nam not surprised; what can one expect of a cook who is picked up\r\naccidentally on the high road! You do not seem to know, count, that bad\r\ncooks spoil the best of dishes. Here, for instance, are some\r\ncranes--think of it, cranes! a toothsome meat, more succulent than any\r\nif properly prepared. Now just see how that ass, that churl of a cook\r\nserves them up--boiled in water!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, father, be not angry, we shall have them roasted next time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Roasted! that would be still more criminal! roasted cranes! Come this\r\nway, steward, I will give you the recipe for the cook--if he is capable\r\nof carrying it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, holy bishop, with the help of the whip the cook could not choose\r\nbut carry out the recipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must humbly declare that I am not the inventor of the way in which\r\ncranes must be prepared. I read it and learned it from the writings of\r\nApicius, a celebrated Roman gourmand, who died, alas, many years ago,\r\nbut his genius will live as long as cranes will fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us have the recipe, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is: You wash and dress your crane, you then put it in an\r\nearthen pot, with water, salt and anise--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! that is just what my cook did; he washed the crane in water and\r\nsalt--\"\r\n\r\n\"But let me finish, barbarian, and you will soon enough see that the\r\nlazy ass stopped in the middle of the road instead of proceeding to the\r\nend. Now you must allow the water in which your crane is laid, to be\r\nboiled down one-half; thereupon you put it into a pan with olive oil\r\nbroth flavored with wild marjoram and coriander; when your crane is done\r\nto the turn, pour in some wine mixed with honey and spices, a pinch of\r\ncumin, a taste of benzoin, a bit of rue and some caraway seed boiled in\r\nvinegar; pour in flour to give consistency to your sauce, which will\r\nthen be of a handsome gold brown tint; you pour this over your crane\r\nafter having placed the bird handsomely on a large platter with its\r\nround neck gently curled in a circle and holding in its long beak a\r\nspray of greens. And now I ask his glory, Prince Chram, I ask our\r\nillustrious friends here assembled--is there any comparison between a\r\ncrane, prepared in such a style, and this shapeless, colorless thing\r\nthat seems to be swimming in a bowl of greasy water?\"\r\n\r\n\"If God, the Father, needed a cook, he would certainly choose you,\r\nsensuous bishop,\" said the Lion of Poitiers; \"you would be no disgrace\r\nin paradise as the chief of the celestial kitchens.\"\r\n\r\nAt the impious jest the holy man made a grimace of rage, remembering\r\nonly recently he had actually officiated as cook, but not in\r\nparadise--it was in Vagrery. He filled his cup and drained it at one\r\ndraught, looking askance at the royal favorite.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Count Neroweg,\" said Spatachair, \"there is mercy for every sin;\r\nsome other day you will treat us to a choicer feast--and you will\r\npromise your wife to preside at the banquet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by the faith of the Lion of Poitiers, I promise not to chuckle her\r\nunder the chin too freely.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you give that banquet, Neroweg,\" added Imnachair, despite the\r\nglances of Chram to check the insolence of his favorites, \"when you give\r\nus that banquet, you will not make us eat and drink, as you do to-day,\r\nout of copper and tin vessels, while you spread out before our dazzled\r\neyes your gold and silver utensils in the center of the table--far from\r\nour reach. It almost looks, you vainglorious rustic, as if you took us\r\nfor thieves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neroweg offers his hospitality in the way that suits him,\" put in\r\nSigefrid, the count's leude, in a tone of muffled anger; \"those who eat\r\nthe meat and drink the wine of this house have no right to complain of\r\nthe dishes--if these don't suit them, let them go and fill up\r\nelsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we, the King's men, to be chaffed for what we eat and drink at this\r\nburg?\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be the height of impudence! As to me, I was surfeited before\r\nI touched a mouthful of these mountains of cold provisions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, it is an insult,\" cried another of the guests. \"We members of\r\nthe royal bodyguard will brook no insult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think yourselves above us, because we are leudes of a count? If\r\nyou do, we may measure the distance between us, by measuring the length\r\nof our swords.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not swords, but hearts that we should measure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you pretend to say that we, the faithful men of Neroweg, have\r\nsmaller hearts than you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A challenge let it be, thick-headed rustics!\"\r\n\r\n\"The thick-headed rustic is more than a match for the effeminate court\r\nsoldier. And you will find it out on the spot if you dare put your hands\r\nto your swords.\"\r\n\r\n\"Six against six, or more, if you prefer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will suit us better than to cross swords with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe altercation between the half tipsy Franks had started at one end of\r\nthe table; at first it was conducted in a low voice, but it soon reached\r\nsuch a pitch of loudness and exasperation that Chram, the bishop and the\r\ncount hastened to interpose and restore peace among the table\r\ncompanions. It was with an ill grace and exchanging wild looks of hatred\r\nthat the intoxicated leudes subsided.\r\n\r\nKaradeucq and his bear, both preceded by the steward, had reached the\r\nthreshold of the banquet hall when the disturbance between the leudes\r\nwas silenced. The steward approached his master and said:\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, the mountebank with his bear and monkey are ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, count, have you bears in this place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chram, he is a strolling mountebank with his animals. I thought it\r\nwould amuse you at the close of the banquet, and I ordered him to be\r\nbrought in.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of the proposed entertainment was joyfully received by all the\r\nFranks, and made them forget their recent quarrel and hard feelings.\r\nSome stood up, others rose on their haunches in order to be the first to\r\nsee the man, his monkey, and his bear. When Karadeucq appeared, loud\r\nroars of laughter shook the walls of the hall. It was not that the\r\naspect of the old Vagre was amusing, but nothing could be imagined more\r\ngrotesque than the appearance of the lover of the bishopess under the\r\nbear's skin. He stepped forward heavily, clad in the jacket with its\r\nhood thrown back and seemed dazed by the light of the torches, although\r\nall the thirty or forty of them cast but a flickering and subdued light\r\nover the vast hall. Thanks to this rather dim and unsteady light, and\r\nalso to the wide jacket that half enveloped the Vagre, his ursine\r\nappearance was perfect. Moreover, in order to keep the curious at a\r\ndistance, Karadeucq pulled in the chain to which the animal was\r\nattached and cried:\r\n\r\n\"Seigneurs, do not come too near the teeth of the bear, he is often\r\nsullen and ferocious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mountebank, keep close watch on your beast; should he unfortunately\r\nhurt anybody in this hall, I shall have him cut to pieces, and you will\r\nreceive for your share fifty lashes on your back!\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur count, have pity on me, poor old man that I am; I only have my\r\nanimals to earn my bread with--I have requested your noble and very\r\nnoble guests not to approach my bear too closely, in order to prevent\r\nany unfortunate accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Step forward; I wish to have a closer view of your jolly companion; he\r\nwill not, I presume, dare to paw me, the son of King Clotaire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very glorious Prince! these poor brutes are deprived of\r\nintelligence and cannot distinguish between the great seigneurs of the\r\nworld and the humble slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Step forward, step forward--a little closer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very glorious King, look out--it will be less dangerous to be close to\r\nthe monkey--I can let him out of his cage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, monkeys, I am not very curious to see those wicked animals. I have\r\npages, plenty of them. Ha, ha, ha--look at the droll fellow with his\r\njacket. Look, Imnachair, how clumsily he carries himself--how he\r\ngrunts--for all the world he looks like the Lion of Poitiers in his\r\nmorning gown, after spending a night with women and wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else should I do, Chram! I consider lost every night that I do not\r\nput to use in your style with wine and women.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lion, you are unjust--I have become temperate and chaste.\"\r\n\r\n\"Through exhaustion--O, chaste and sober Prince--did you renounce the\r\npure girls and good wine!\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, you should rather pity than blame me. Ho, there, mountebank,\r\nwhat tricks can your bear perform? Is he clever?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you order it, glorious King, my bear will ride on horseback on my\r\ncane, and myself holding him by the chain, he will gracefully gallop\r\naround the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good; let us see him do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Attention! Mont-Dore.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you call him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mont-Dore, glorious King. I give him that name because I caught him\r\nwhen he was still but a cub on one of the peaks of Mont Dore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am no longer surprised if your bear is ferocious. He was born in one\r\nof the most notorious lairs of the accursed Vagres, those wandering men,\r\nthose wolves, those heads of wolves who haunt only rocks, forests and\r\ncaverns. But as sure as this morning we put one of them to the torture,\r\nwe shall end by wiping them all out, just as Count Neroweg did the other\r\nday with a band of them who took refuge in the defile of Allange.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, glorious King, may the Almighty deliver us from these pestilential\r\nVagres! May He grant me the favor of never running across any of them\r\nexcept as he hangs from the gibbet--the way I saw the first and last one\r\nwhom I ever laid eyes upon--it was a terrible sight! The thought of it\r\nstill makes me tremble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you see that Vagre on the gibbet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Near the frontier of Limousin; over the gallows was this inscription:\r\n'This is Karadeucq the Vagre--so shall his likes be treated.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Karadeucq! The old bandit who with his bedevilled band so long raided\r\nLimousin and Auvergne!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pillaging burgs and episcopal mansions!\"\r\n\r\n\"A worthy example, followed by the band of Ronan, the other dog that is\r\nto be executed to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am glad to hear it, at last we are delivered from that\r\nKaradeucq! He was thought to be running the Vagrery in some other\r\nregions, but his return was always apprehended.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, glorious Prince, he will never be back again--unless the bandit\r\ndescended from his gibbet, and that is unlikely. When I saw him dangling\r\nin the air his corpse was already half eaten up by the carrion crows,\r\nand both his hands and feet were chopped off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite certain you saw the name of Karadeucq on that gibbet? It\r\nwould be truly a great deliverance for the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glorious King, his name is so uncommon in our country that it struck me\r\nthe moment I saw it; hence I remember it well.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a Breton name,\" said Bishop Cautin; \"it is one of the names\r\ncommon in those heretical and cursed regions that to this hour\r\nstubbornly resist the authority and orders of our councils. Oh, Chram,\r\nwill the Frankish Kings never have the power and the will to reduce to\r\nobedience that savage Armorica, that hot-bed of druid idolatry, the only\r\nprovince of Gaul that until now has been able to withstand the arms of\r\nKing Clovis, your grandfather, and his worthy sons and grandsons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop, you have an easygoing way of talking about such matters. More\r\nthan once did Clovis and the Frankish Kings, my ancestors, dispatch\r\ntheir best warriors to the conquest of that pestilential country, and\r\nour troops were every time cut to pieces in the marshes, the defiles and\r\nthe forests of Armorica. No, those indomitable Bretons are not\r\nhuman--they are demons! Oh, if all the other regions of Gaul had been\r\npeopled with that infernal race, ever rebellious to the Catholic church,\r\nwe would still be struggling to maintain our power. But, old mountebank,\r\nyou seem greatly affected; I noticed a tear roll down your grey beard;\r\nwhy so?\"\r\n\r\n\"If only one tear did run down my grey beard, it is because old men's\r\neyes are stingy of tears.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why would you have shed more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, King, I would have wept all the tears in my head over those unhappy\r\nBretons whose detestable druid idolatry condemns them to the\r\neverlasting flames, as our holy bishop used to say: unhappy blind men\r\nwho shut their eyes to the divine light of the faith! unhappy rebels,\r\nwho dare turn their arms against our good seigneurs and masters, the\r\nFrankish Kings, whom our blessed bishops order us to obey in the name of\r\nthe Church! Oh, Prince, I repeat it to you, but for that the eyes of an\r\nold man are stingy of tears, mine would flow in torrents at the thought\r\nof the damnable error of those unhappy heretics!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mountebank, you are a pious man,\" said Cautin; \"kneel down and kiss my\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy bishop, blessed be the favor you grant me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rise, my son, and preserve your faith in our Church; have also\r\nconfidence in the future; the accursed idolaters and rebellious Bretons\r\nwill not much longer escape the just punishment that is in store for\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! As true as scissors have never touched my hair, I, Chram, son\r\nof Clotaire, King of France, I shall never rest so long as those\r\nArmorican demons are not crushed and drowned in their own blood. Too\r\nlong have they resisted our arms. We shall soon make short work of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"May the Almighty hear your vow, great Prince, and may He grant me, a\r\npoor old man, enough days to witness the submission of that Brittany\r\nthat has so long remained stiffnecked and indomitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, mountebank, let us return to your bear; we had almost forgotten\r\nall about him, the wild fellow who was born in one of the lairs of the\r\naccursed Vagres.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing strange in that, glorious King! Are not those accursed fellows\r\nwolves? Have not bears and wolves the same dens? Come Mont-Dore, up my\r\nlad, show your skill to our holy bishop, who is present, and to the\r\nillustrious King Chram; also to the very renowned count and the noble\r\naudience. Take this cane--it shall be your mount; get on horseback and\r\ngallop around this table as gracefully as you can, and with the\r\ngentlest airs that you can put on. Come, Mont-Dore, to horse, the\r\ncourser will not run away with you. Make room, there, make room, there,\r\nnoble seigneurs--above all, do not approach the animal too closely.\r\nCome, Mont-Dore, start galloping, my daring knight!\"\r\n\r\nThe lover of the beautiful bishopess straddled the cane which he held\r\nbetween his two fore paws, and led by the chain which Karadeucq held he\r\ncommenced to prance with grotesque clumsiness around the hall amid the\r\nloud laughter of the assembled leudes.\r\n\r\nAs he led him, the Vagre said to himself:\r\n\r\n\"I came dangerously near betraying myself when I heard the Frankish King\r\nspeak of the bravery of the Breton race; my heart beat with pride fit to\r\ncrack my ribs; then, besides, I thought of good old grandfather Araim,\r\nwho used to call me his pet! I thought of my father Jocelyn, of my\r\nmother Madalen--both no doubt dead in the country that I ran away from\r\nmore than forty years ago, and where my brother Kervan and my dear sweet\r\nsister Roselyk still live. At these thoughts tears came to my eyes\r\ndespite myself. Oh, my sons! Ronan! Loysik! here I am near to you, but\r\nshall I manage your delivery! Hesus! Hesus! inspire me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Hounds pranced all along astride of the cane,\r\nencouraged in his antics by the laughter that it provoked in the Franks.\r\nRemembering the success that had crowned his efforts during the nights\r\nof the calends of January, he indulged in gambols that delighted the\r\nblockish leudes and that carried their hilarity to the pitch of\r\nhysterics. Above all the count held his sides and laughed and laughed,\r\nfit to burst his dalmatica of silver cloth. Suddenly he checked his\r\nlaughter and said to Chram:\r\n\r\n\"King, would you see still better sport?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, count, what have you to propose? Your face is red to suffocation.\r\nYou breathe like an ox. What new thought has just sprouted in your\r\nhead?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is this: I have a plan--we have in the burg enormous and ferocious\r\nmastiffs that we use to hunt wolves and wild boars with. We shall chain\r\nthe bear to one of the beams of the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"And let loose some of your mastiffs against him? The idea is\r\ndelicious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Chram; I want to offer you a royal treat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live Count Neroweg! Come, fetch the dogs! The more ferocious they\r\nare and sharp their teeth, all the more amusing will be the sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the Franks with shouts of joy; \"the dogs--the dogs--a\r\ncombat between the bear and the dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello! my master of the hounds, Gondolf! fetch in Mirff and Morff--if\r\nthey leave a shred of skin and flesh on the bones of the bear I wish\r\nthis goblet of wine may be poison to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, I shall run to the kennel and bring the mastiffs Mirff and\r\nMorff.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he heard the count's proposition, which was received with universal\r\nacclaim by the leudes, the lover of the bishopess, who, faithful to his\r\nrole, was riding lustily on his cane around the table suddenly\r\ninterrupted his antics and was on the point of expressing with some\r\ncompromising gesture his refusal to serve as quarry for the fangs of\r\nMirff and Morff. Fortunately by means of a gentle tug given at the\r\nchain, Karadeucq recalled the Vagre to prudence and the latter continued\r\nhis gambols with the most indifferent air in the world; but his\r\nconductor, without letting the chain slip from his hands, threw himself\r\nat the feet of Neroweg and said:\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur count, illustrious seigneur!\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you of me, old mountebank?\"\r\n\r\n\"My bear is my bread winner--you will have him killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, do not I also run the risk of seeing the best two dogs of my\r\npack hugged to death--or torn to pieces by your bear's claws? You said\r\nyourself, your animal was ferocious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur, you do not earn your living with your dogs; but my bear is my\r\nbread winner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dare you resist my will?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, great Prince,\" said Karadeucq on his knees, but turning towards\r\nChram: \"A poor old man addresses him to your glory; one word from you to\r\nthis illustrious seigneur, who respects you as the son of his King, and\r\nhe will renounce his project. I swear to you by my salvation, the other\r\ntricks of my bear which I have not exhibited will amuse a hundredfold\r\nmore than the bloody combat that will deprive me of my bread winner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, rise old mountebank, I shall not hinder you in the making of your\r\nliving.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to you, great King, my bear is saved!\"\r\n\r\nChram's words provoked violent murmurs from the count's leudes; not only\r\ndid they see themselves deprived of a spectacle that was to delight\r\ntheir eyes, but they imagined themselves humiliated anew, now in the\r\nperson of the master of the house, their count. The murmurs grew louder.\r\n\r\n\"Chram is not King in this burg, Neroweg,\" cried Sigefrid, one of the\r\nprincipal starters of the quarrel that was allayed just as Karadeucq\r\nentered the hall with his bear. \"No, King Chram cannot by a word deprive\r\nus of an amusement that it pleases you to afford us. Neroweg is King in\r\nhis burg.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" loudly chimed in the other warriors of the count, \"we want to\r\nsee the fight with the bear. The dogs! the dogs! Neroweg alone commands\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and to the devil with the King!\" cried Sigefrid.\r\n\r\n\"The devil take Chram if he opposes our enjoyment! We are masters here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only brutes of rustics send their guest to the devil when he is the son\r\nof their King,\" put in the Lion of Poitiers with a threatening air. \"Is\r\nthat the example in courtesy that you set to your men, Neroweg? It seems\r\nso, judging by the conduct of your steward, who is hastening now, when\r\nthe banquet is hardly over, to carry away your gold and silver vessels\r\nout of fear, I suppose, lest we steal them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My sons! My dear sons in Christ! Are you about to start quarreling\r\nanew? I order peace, my sons--in the name of heaven, keep the peace!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bishop, you are right to preach peace; these brave leudes who fear that\r\nI am interfering with their amusement did not understand me. I told the\r\nmountebank that I would not hinder him from earning his living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks again, thanks again, great King.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much is your bear worth?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is priceless to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever sum you may fix will be counted out to you, in case your bear\r\nis killed.\"\r\n\r\nThe King's words were received by the acclamations of the Franks, and\r\nallayed the quarrel that was on the point of breaking out. Karadeucq,\r\nhowever, without rising from his knees, cried:\r\n\r\n\"Great King, no sum can repay me for my bear; mercy, beg the count to\r\ndesist from his project.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dogs! Here are the dogs!\"\r\n\r\n\"In all my life I have not seen such mastiffs!\" exclaimed Chram with\r\nadmiration. \"Count, if your whole pack is similarly fitted out, it will\r\nrival mine, which I considered matchless.\"\r\n\r\n\"What flanks! What enormous paws! Ha, Chram, if you only heard their\r\nvoices, the bellowing of a bull is like the song of a nightingale beside\r\ntheir barking when they are on the tracks of a wild boar. I am justly\r\nproud of my dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wager that one of them will be enough to kill the bear as truly as my\r\nname is Spatachair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, tie the bear to one of the beams, old mountebank, and let us\r\nbegin.\" \"I told you, if your beast is killed, I shall pay whatever sum\r\nyou may say, royally and without chaffering.\"\r\n\r\n\"Illustrious King, have pity on a poor man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, enough--chain up the bear to one of the beams, and be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneur bishop, in the name of your blessed hand which you give me to\r\nkiss, be charitable towards my poor animal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he perchance a Christian that I should exercise charity towards him?\r\nOh, mountebank, mountebank, had you not shown yourself a minute ago to\r\nbe a pious man, I would consider this last request an outrage.\"\r\n\r\nTo insist any longer would have been to risk losing everything.\r\nKaradeucq understood this, and addressing himself to Chram, said:\r\n\r\n\"Glorious King, let your will be done; but allow me to make one last\r\nrequest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up.\"\r\n\r\n\"The spectacle will only be a butchery; my bear being chained he will\r\nnot be able to defend himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you perchance leave him loose, old idiot, and have him devour\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, King; but if you would wish an amusement that would last some time,\r\nthen at least equalize the forces; permit me to arm my bear with a\r\nclub.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he not his nails?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of prudence I have filed them off--you notice how smooth\r\nhis paws are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, he shall have a club--but do you think he will know how to\r\nhelp himself with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, the fear of being devoured will force him to defend himself as\r\nbest he may; in all your life you will not have seen such a spectacle.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Neroweg,\" said Sigefrid, more than any other of the leudes a\r\nstickler for the count's dignity, \"do you allow the bear to have a club?\r\nYou alone have the right to say here: 'I will.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I allow the club--I think that the bear striking at the dogs\r\nwith a club will be a wonderful spectacle. And yet, I would have greatly\r\npreferred to have seen the beast killed by Mirff and Morff. But that\r\nwould have ended the sport too quickly. Come, let the slaves blow the\r\nhorns, and you others, who beat the drums, blow and beat at your\r\nloudest, or you shall have your own backs drummed upon; and you,\r\ntorch-bearing slaves, draw near the circle that is to be formed. Hold\r\nhigh your torches that we may see the combat well. Strike up, you\r\ndrummers! blow on the hunting horns in order to excite the dogs well.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the beam; tie the bear to the beam!\"\r\n\r\nKaradeucq led the lover of the bishopess to a corner of the hall,\r\nchained him to one of the beams of the colonnade, put between his paws\r\nthe knotty club on which he had been riding and said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Come, my poor Mont-Dore; courage; you will have to defend yourself\r\nwell, seeing that you have to fight against two dogs for the amusement\r\nof the noble seigneurs; show yourself worthy of your race.\"\r\n\r\nA wide circle was formed, lighted by the torch-bearing slaves. In the\r\nfront rank of the audience stood King Chram, his three favorites, the\r\ncount, the bishop and several leudes; all the others mounted the table.\r\nIn the center of the circle, clad in his ample jacket, which had\r\nfortunately been left to him, stood the Vagre-bear; he preserved an\r\nintrepid countenance; he naïvely sat down on his haunches, like a bear\r\nwho expects no evil, and nonchalantly held his club between his fore\r\npaws; occasionally he leaned the club against his body in order to\r\nscratch himself with a movement of graceful and easy abandon. Suddenly\r\nthe hunting horns struck up their deafening uproar. Gondolf, the count's\r\nmaster of the hounds, stepped into the circle holding the two monstrous\r\nmastiffs by the leash. From their enormous necks a dewlap similar to\r\nthat of a bull dropped down upon their chests; their large bloodshot\r\neyes were half hidden under their long and drooping ears; black, white\r\nand yellow streaks ran over their shaggy skin which bristled up on their\r\nbacks the moment they perceived the bear. Instantly they barked\r\nfuriously, and dashing forward wildly they broke the leash that Gondolf\r\nstill held in his hand. In two bounds they precipitated themselves upon\r\nthe lover of the bishopess.\r\n\r\n\"At him, Mirff! At him, Morff!\" cried the count clapping his hands. \"At\r\nhim! At the quarry, my wild fellows! Leave him not a shred of flesh on\r\nhis bones!\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless a miracle of strength and skill takes place, my companion will\r\nbe torn to pieces, our strategy discovered, and the last chance of my\r\nsons' escape will be lost; if so, I shall swiftly stab both the King and\r\nthe count at their hearts,\" said Karadeucq to himself, and as he did,\r\nhis hand reached under his blouse, for the dagger that he had there\r\nhidden. His hand firmly seized it, ready for immediate use.\r\n\r\nSeemingly unaffected by the sight of the dogs, the Vagre-bear continued\r\nto perform his role with unaltered presence of mind, bravery and skill;\r\nhe made a momentary movement of surprise, but immediately backed up\r\nagainst the beam and held himself ready, with uplifted club, to repel\r\nthe attack of the dogs. Mirff was the first to dash forward, aiming at\r\nhis belly, but that very instant the Vagre-bear struck him so violent a\r\nblow over the head that the club broke in three, and Mirff dropped as if\r\nstruck by thunder, and emitting terrible howls.\r\n\r\n\"Malediction!\" cried the count. \"There goes a mastiff that cost me three\r\ngold sous! Here, my men, have that ferocious bear immediately\r\ndisemboweled with your boar spears and iron bars!\"\r\n\r\nThe count's imprecations were drowned by the frantic shouts of the rest\r\nof the audience, who, themselves more disinterested than Neroweg in the\r\ncourse that the combat was taking, applauded the bear's valor and\r\nawaited the issue of the struggle with anxious curiosity. The\r\nVagre-bear, now disarmed and wholly exposed, was at close quarters with\r\nthe other mastiff, that, the moment the club was broken, seized his\r\nadversary in the thigh with his formidable fangs and threw him down with\r\nthe impetuosity of the shock. The blood of Karadeucq's companion flowed\r\ncopiously and reddened the leaves with which the floor was strewn. Twice\r\ndid the bear and the dog roll over each other; at the third time,\r\npinning to the ground with the full weight of his body the mastiff,\r\nthat, like Deber-Trud, did not loosen its teeth from its enemy, the\r\nVagre clutched the brute by the throat and held him in such a tight\r\nclutch between his vigorous hands, that the animal was strangled. During\r\nthis doubly terrible struggle not only did the mastiff's bite cause the\r\nVagre an intense pain, but he ran at every instant the risk of being cut\r\nto pieces, together with Karadeucq, if, by the slightest accident, he\r\nbut betrayed himself;--the lover of the bishopess remained true to his\r\nursine role; he emitted no sound other than a few muffled grunts. The\r\ncombat being over, the worthy animal crouched down in a lump at the foot\r\nof the beam between the corpses of the two mastiffs; with his head\r\nbetween his fore paws he seemed patiently to lick his bleeding wound,\r\nwhile Chram, his favorites and several even of the count's leudes\r\nvociferously acclaimed the triumph of the bear.\r\n\r\n\"Alas, alas!\" murmured old Karadeucq as he approached his companion. \"My\r\npoor bear is wounded, mortally perhaps. I have lost my bread winner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fetch boar spears and axes!\" cried the count foaming at the mouth with\r\nfury. \"Let the ferocious brute be cut to pieces on the spot; he has just\r\nkilled Mirff and Morff, the best two dogs of my pack! By the Terrible\r\nEagle, my ancestor, I order that the cursed bear be cut to pieces\r\ninstantly! Did you hear me, Gondolf?\" he added, addressing his master of\r\nthe hounds and trembling with rage. \"Take down one of those hunting\r\nspears from the wall--kill that bear, kill him on the spot!\"\r\n\r\nGondolf hastened to arm himself as he was ordered, while Karadeucq,\r\nkneeling down again, cried to Chram with outstretched arms:\r\n\r\n\"Great King, my only hope rests with you. I implore mercy from you. I\r\nplace myself under your protection and under the protection of your\r\nroyal suite. Oh, redoubtable and invincible warrior! Oh, ye other\r\nvalorous warriors of the King's suite, as terrible in battle as you are\r\ngenerous after victory, you surely will not want to see this animal\r\nkilled; he vanquished, but was wounded in the struggle and fought\r\nfairly! No, no, ever following the example of your glorious King, your\r\nrefined and courteous honor will revolt at such brutal cowardice, even\r\nif committed towards a poor animal! Oh, warriors who are as brilliant by\r\nyour armor and military grace as you are terrible by your valor, I place\r\nmyself at the mercy and under the protection of your King. He will\r\ndemand the life of my bear of the seigneur count, who can refuse nothing\r\nto such a noble guest!\"\r\n\r\nThe Frank is vainglorious; his pride delights in the most exaggerated\r\npraises of himself; Karadeucq was aware of this; moreover, by addressing\r\nhimself exclusively to the royal bodyguard, he expected to throw once\r\nmore the apple of discord between them and the count's leudes. His words\r\nwere favorably received by the warriors of Chram, who, stepping towards\r\nNeroweg, said:\r\n\r\n\"Count, we demand of you grace for this brave animal, and we do so in\r\nthe name of the old German custom, according to which a guest's request\r\nis always granted.\"\r\n\r\n\"King, the custom to the contrary notwithstanding, I shall avenge the\r\ndeath of Mirff and Morff, who cost me six gold pieces. Gondolf, fetch\r\nthe spears and axes; the bear shall be cut to pieces instantly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Count, the poor mountebank has placed himself under my protection. I\r\nmay not forsake him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chram, whether or not you protect the old bandit, I shall revenge the\r\ndeath of my magnificent dogs Mirff and Morff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Neroweg, I have a pack that is worth fully as much as yours.\r\nYou saw it hunt in the forest of Margevol. You may send the master of\r\nthe hounds to my villa, let him pick out six of my best and handsomest\r\ndogs to replace the two that lie dead at our feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I would revenge Mirff and Morff,\" yelled the count furiously,\r\ngrinding his teeth. \"Gondolf, the spears! the spears! death to the\r\ndevilish bear!\"\r\n\r\n\"You savage rustic, you fail in all the duties of hospitality by denying\r\nthe request of the King's son,\" bellowed the Lion of Poitiers at\r\nNeroweg, \"just as you insulted us, your guests, by keeping your wife\r\nfrom the banquet, and by having your gold and silver vessels removed\r\nfrom the table even before the banquet was over! You are more of a bear\r\nthan that animal, which you shall not kill. I forbid you--the mountebank\r\nhas placed himself under the protection of Chram and of us, his men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Companions!\" cried Sigefrid, \"shall we tolerate the heaping of insults\r\nupon our count?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just listen to the rustic brutes!\" observed aloud one of Chram's\r\nwarriors, \"listen to them, barking as ever, without daring to bite.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, Neroweg, king in this burg, as any king in his kingdom, I shall kill\r\nthat bear! And if you say another word, you whom they call Lion, I shall\r\nknock you down at my feet with a blow from my axe, insolent palace cub!\"\r\n\r\n\"You dare insult me, you smut-covered boar!\" screamed the Gallic\r\nrenegade as, pale with anger, he drew his sword with one hand and with\r\nthe other seized the count by the collar of his dalmatica. \"You seem to\r\nwant me to turn your throat into a sheath for my blade! Ask for mercy,\r\nor you are a dead man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, you double thief! You wish to steal my gold necklace!\" cried\r\nNeroweg, thinking only of defending his jewelry, and concluding from the\r\ngesture of his adversary that the latter's purpose was to rob him. \"I\r\nwas right to place my gold and silver vessels out of the clutches of all\r\nof you thievish palace cubs.\"\r\n\r\n\"He calls us all thieves! To your swords, men of the royal bodyguard!\r\nLet us avenge our honor! Let us slash these rustics!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, bastard dogs!\" cried Neroweg between whom and the Lion of Poitiers\r\nSigefrid had thrown himself. \"You speak of swords--here is one for you,\r\nand of good temper; you will taste it, profligate blasphemer, who have\r\nof a lion only the name! To me, my leudes! they have raised their hands\r\nagainst your count! Let us slash the royal bodyguard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Neroweg!\" cried Chram interposing, as his favorite, who had shaken\r\nhimself loose from Sigefrid, rushed at the count with upraised sword,\r\n\"are you all fools to quarrel in this manner? Lion, I order you to put\r\nup your sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, great St. Martin, blessings upon your name for giving me the\r\nopportunity to chastise the sacrilegious whelp who had the audacity to\r\nraise his switch at my holy bishop, and who has never ceased sneering at\r\nboth the holy man and me since he stepped into my burg,\" cried the\r\ncount, deaf to the words of Chram, and striving to reach his adversary,\r\nfrom whom he had been again separated in the midst of the uproar.\r\n\r\n\"Boys, let us defend Neroweg!\" Sigefrid called out to his fellow leudes\r\nof the count. \"This is a good opportunity to prove to the braggards that\r\nour rough-looking swords are better than their parade weapons! To arms!\r\nDown with them to the last man!\"\r\n\r\n\"And we also to arms! let us settle accounts with these dogs of the\r\nbasement! They think they are strong, because they are on their own\r\ndunghill. Death to the clowns. Let us defend the favorite of King Chram,\r\nour King! Swing your axes!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sons in God,\" screamed the bishop in a vain endeavor to\r\ndominate the tumult and the increasing uproar, \"I order you, all of you,\r\nto put up your swords! It is an affliction to the Lord to see His sons\r\nquarrel over trifles. Obey your father in God!\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends!\" cried Chram in his turn but without being able to make\r\nhimself heard, \"it is folly, it is stupidity to slay one another in this\r\nwise. Imnachair! Spatachair! calm our men; and you, Neroweg, calm yours\r\ninstead of exciting them!\"\r\n\r\nVain words; they dropped unheard; neither Neroweg nor the rest of the\r\nleudes did or cared to listen to words of conciliation. As to Neroweg\r\nhimself, a mass of combatants had again thrown themselves between him\r\nand the Lion of Poitiers, to whom he called in an enraged voice and\r\nstruggled to reach. The warriors of Chram and those of the count soon\r\npassed from insults and threats, hurled at each other from a distance,\r\nto a hand-to-hand conflict. At the first blow the engagement became\r\ngeneral--maddening, furious, maudlin and all the more terrible because\r\nthe torch-bearing slaves, who alone lighted the hall, fearing to be\r\nkilled in the brawl, fled away precipitately, some throwing their\r\ntorches to the ground and thus extinguishing them, others carrying the\r\nlighted torches with them in their distracted flight. In an instant the\r\nbanquet hall was deprived of its living illumination; the battle\r\ncontinued in the dark with blind ferocity.\r\n\r\nAnd Karadeucq and the lover of the beautiful bishopess, did they remain\r\nquietly in the midst of the butchery? Oh, by no means! Vagres know\r\nbetter than that. After having skilfully thrown the firebrand in the\r\nmidst of the leudes of the King and the count, Karadeucq saw with\r\npleasure the flames of angry rivalry between the two sets of barbarians\r\nflare up a third time, after twice having been appeased; and it was with\r\ndelight that he noticed it rage in such manner that both he and his bear\r\nwere lost sight of. As soon as the conflagration which he had kindled\r\nwas well under way, the old Vagre rushed to the bear, and unchaining\r\nhim, said at his companion's ear: \"Follow close at my heels and do as I\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nThe melee was at its height; the torch-bearers had either fled or were\r\nfleeing, leaving the banquet hall in almost perfect darkness. Followed\r\nby the Master of the Hounds Karadeucq threw himself under the wide and\r\nmassive table which, although now broken in parts, was not upset by the\r\ncombat, being, contrary to the habit of the Franks, fastened to the\r\nfloor. Thus under shelter for a moment the old Vagre unfastened the\r\nchain from around the neck of the lover of the bishopess, whereupon\r\ncontinuing to grope their way under the table by the flickering light of\r\nthe extinguishing torches on the floor, they reached the door of the\r\nbanquet hall, which was free from the combatants, and rushed out. As\r\nthey issued from the banquet hall the Vagres found themselves face to\r\nface with two slaves who, having fled through another issue, were\r\nrunning distracted with their torches in their hands. Each Vagre seized\r\none of the slaves by the throat.\r\n\r\n\"Extinguish your torch,\" said Karadeucq, \"and lead me straight to the\r\n_ergastula_, or you die this instant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me your torch,\" said the lover of the bishopess, \"and take me\r\nstraight to the hay lofts, or I stab you to death.\"\r\n\r\nThe two slaves obeyed; the Vagres parted company; one ran towards the\r\nhay lofts and barns, the other to the _ergastula_, both guided by their\r\nconductors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prisoners in the _ergastula_ had drawn as close as possible to the\r\niron railing. Little Odille, who had fallen asleep on the knees of the\r\nbishopess, awoke with a start, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, are they coming to take us to the place of execution? I am ready\r\nfor everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, little Odille! it is barely midnight; I know not what may be\r\nhappening at the burg; all the Franks who were watching us left their\r\nposts before our prison and followed one of their men who came after\r\nthem; all ran towards the burg brandishing their arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, my brother, listen in the direction of the seigniorial\r\nmansion--it seems to me I hear an odd noise proceeding from that\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear tumultuous cries--the clash of arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, the Vagres must have come to our deliverance, the burg is on\r\nfire!\"\r\n\r\n\"The fire spreads--look--look--it is as clear as day in front of the\r\nprison.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man is running this way--why, it is Karadeucq, our father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Loysik! Ronan! Oh! my sons.\"\r\n\r\n\"You here, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, Loysik, all of you within, join me to break down the iron\r\nrailing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! we cannot budge--our feet are all sore--we have been put to the\r\ntorture!\"\r\n\r\n\"To see my two sons and yet not to be able to save them--malediction!\r\nThis way, Master of the Hounds! my brave fellow, this way--let us free\r\nmy sons!\"\r\n\r\n\"My beautiful bishopess, are you there? Come, give me a kiss across the\r\nrailing!--Your lips have pressed mine. I now feel stronger. We two,\r\nKaradeucq, will have to tear down this railing. I have set fire to the\r\nfour corners of the burg--stables, barns, lofts, all is aflame. The\r\ncount's main building that is now full of Franks, who are mutually\r\nslaying one another, and which is built of frame, has also taken fire;\r\nit is beginning to burn like a faggot stuck into a furnace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woe is us! it is impossible to break down the railing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Free us, father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my sons, I shall die of rage before I fall under the axe of the\r\nFranks, if I cannot set you free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, old Karadeucq, one more effort; the Franks who guarded the\r\n_ergastula_ are now thinking of nothing else but to extinguish the fire;\r\nlet us dig a hole under the railing with our poniards, with our nails.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Franks! There they are--they are coming back to the _ergastula_;\r\nthey are running this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see their weapons glistening by the light of the conflagration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, there is no hope left! You are lost! Blood and death, lost! And\r\nhere we are, sore and incapable to defend you!\"\r\n\r\nAbout a score of men at arms and several leudes ran with their arms in\r\nthe direction of the _ergastula_; one of them was heard to say: \"A part\r\nof these dogs of slaves are profiting by the fire in order to revolt; I\r\nheard them say that they were going to set the chief of the Vagres and\r\nthe rest of the prisoners free. Quick, quick, let us put them all to\r\ndeath--we shall afterwards see to the slaves. Who has the key to the\r\nrailing?\"\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when Sigefrid was handing the key to the Frankish\r\nwarrior his eyes fell upon Karadeucq.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing there, old vagabond?\"\r\n\r\n\"Noble youth, frightened by the fire, my bear has escaped; I am running\r\nafter him--he has crouched down yonder not far from the railing. Alas,\r\nwhat a misfortune this fire is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sigefrid, I have unlocked the railing,\" said one of the Franks; \"shall\r\nwe begin with the men or the women?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall begin with the men!\" cried Karadeucq, planting his dagger in\r\nthe breast of Sigefrid.\r\n\r\n\"I also!\" cried the Master of the Hounds, stabbing another one of the\r\nFranks.\r\n\r\n\"Vagrery! Vagrery! To us, all brave slaves! Death to the Franks! War\r\nupon the seigneurs! Liberty to the slaves! Long live all Gaul!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Vagres!\" cried the thunder-struck Franks, dumbfounded at the death\r\nof the two leudes. \"The Vagres! These demons seem to rise from\r\nunderground and from the depth of hell!\"\r\n\r\n\"This way!\" cried Ronan in a thundering voice. \"This way, my Vagres!\r\nKill the Franks!\"\r\n\r\nThe cry was addressed to the Vagres, whom Ronan saw pouring in.\r\nAttracted by the light of the conflagration, the signal that was agreed\r\nupon, the good, brave Vagres had crossed the fosse; but how? Was not\r\nthat fosse filled with such deep slime that a man would be swallowed up\r\nin it if he attempted to cross it? Certainly, but Ronan's Vagres had,\r\nsince nightfall, been prowling like wolves around a sheep fold, and\r\ncarefully sounded the fosse; after which the clever lads hewed down with\r\ntheir axes two large ash trees that stood straight as arrows nearby,\r\nstripped off the flexible branches and with them bound the trunks\r\nclosely together. The long and light improvised bridge was thrown across\r\nthe fosse, and nimble as cats they crept one after another over the two\r\ntrunks and reached the opposite side. During the aerial perilous\r\npassage two of the Vagres fell off and immediately disappeared in the\r\nbottom of the fosse; they were Wolve's-Tooth and Symphorien, the\r\nrhetorician--may their names live and be blessed in Vagrery! Their\r\ncompanions had no sooner arrived on the other side of the fosse, than\r\nthey met, running towards the _ergastula_ to liberate the prisoners,\r\nabout thirty revolted slaves armed with clubs, scythes and forks. After\r\nthe warriors of Chram and those of Neroweg had long fought in the dark\r\nin the banquet hall, they suddenly dropped their quarrel, and leaving\r\nthe dead and wounded on the field of battle, gave no thought but to the\r\nfire--the men of the count to extinguish it, the men of Chram to save\r\nthe horses and baggage of their master and take them out of the burning\r\nstable. The Franks who had hastened to the _ergastula_ in order to put\r\nthe prisoners to death were only a score at the most; they were\r\nsurrounded and cut to pieces by Ronan's Vagres and by the slaves, after\r\noffering a desperate resistance. Not one of these Franks escaped; no,\r\nnot one! Two of the slaves took Ronan upon their shoulders, two others\r\nraised Loysik on theirs, and at the request of his bishopess the Master\r\nof the Hounds took up little Odille in his vigorous arms as one might\r\nraise a child from its cradle, the young girl being too weak to walk.\r\nOld Karadeucq followed his two sons.\r\n\r\nThe struggle that took place in front of the _ergastula_ and which was\r\ncrowned with triumph for the Vagres consumed less time than it takes to\r\ndescribe it; but there was still much to be done in order to leave the\r\nfortified enclosure of the burg. It was necessary to reach the bridge,\r\nthe only practicable issue, by reason of Ronan, Loysik and Odille, all\r\nof whom were unable to walk. It was necessary in order to reach the\r\nbridge to follow the inside wall of the embankment under the trees that\r\nlined one side of the parade ground; and the parade ground itself,\r\nwholly exposed and in plain view of the burning buildings had then to be\r\ncrossed. Wise and prudent in counsel, old Karadeucq made the troop halt\r\nwhere it was screened by the trees from the eyes of the enemy, and said\r\nto them:\r\n\r\n\"To attempt to leave the burg in a body would be to invite being slain\r\nto the last man. The moment we are seen, some of the Franks in their\r\nfury will stop trying to extinguish the fire and will fall upon us.\r\nThere is only one chance of escape. The moment we reach the open ground,\r\nwhich you must traverse, let us separate and mix up boldly among the\r\nfrightened Franks, who are seeking to save all they can from the flames.\r\nLet us throw ourselves in among the frightened crowd and seem to be\r\nengaged in some work of salvage, going, coming, running hither and\r\nthither. We shall thus be able to clear the dangerous passage and shall\r\nseparately reach the bridge--our general _rendezvous_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father, carried as we are by these good slaves, how could Loysik\r\nand I avoid being detected?\"\r\n\r\n\"That matters not; the slaves will be thought to be transporting some\r\nwounded men taken from the ruins; conceal your faces somehow and moan as\r\nloud as you can. As to the Master of the Hounds, who has prudently\r\nstripped himself of his bear skin, he can boldly run through the crowd\r\ncarrying the little slave in his arms as if he had saved some young girl\r\nfrom the flames in the women's apartment. The bishopess can wrap herself\r\nup in the coat of the Master of the Hounds; she will have no difficulty\r\nin safely crossing the crowd in the midst of the general tumult.\"\r\n\r\nThe wise advice of the father of Loysik and Ronan was carried out\r\nsuccessfully from point to point.\r\n\r\nBy the faith of a Vagre, beautiful was the spectacle of the vast\r\nFrankish burg enveloped in and consumed by the flames! At every turn\r\nwere heard roofs tumbling in with a crash and throwing upward toward the\r\nstarry vault of heaven large jets of flame and sparks of fire. The\r\nnorthern wind, blowing fresh and strong, drove towards the south large\r\nsheets of flame that surged, like the waves of an angry sea, over the\r\ncrumbling buildings below. At the moment when, carried on the shoulders\r\nof the two slaves, Ronan passed before the seigniorial mansion, which\r\nwas entirely built of frame and shingled with oaken laths, he saw the\r\nflaming roof, which had for some little time been supported by large\r\ncharred beams, fall in with the rattle of thunder and dash itself\r\nagainst the foundation of volcanic rocks. Nothing remained standing of\r\nthe count's once proud residence but a few huge beams, whose blackened\r\nand smoking sides were brought out into strong relief by the curtain of\r\nfire before which they seemed to tremble. The casques and the cuirasses\r\nof the leudes of Chram were seen glistening in the light of the\r\nconflagration; they were running hither and thither in a joint effort\r\nwith the men of Neroweg to save the horses and mules from the burning\r\nstables.\r\n\r\nWhat an infernal tumult, and how sweet to the ear of a Gaul! By the\r\nbones of our fathers the music and the sight were magnificent! The\r\nneighing of horses, the bellowing of cattle, the imprecations of the\r\nFranks, the cries of the wounded leudes whom the flaming ruins burned,\r\nor rolled down upon and crushed! And what a beautiful illumination\r\nlighted the tableau--a ruddy flamboyant light!\r\n\r\nThe two sons of old Karadeucq whom the slaves were carrying on their\r\nbacks, as well as little Odille, in the arms of the Master of the\r\nHounds, finally crossed the bridge over the fosse, closely preceded and\r\nfollowed by all the Vagres and the revolted slaves who joined them. They\r\nhad all successfully threaded their way through the crowds of scurrying\r\nFranks around the burning buildings. After the troop of Karadeucq was\r\nsafely on the other side a vigorous shove threw the keeper off the\r\nbridge down into the fosse, in the bottom of which he disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Are we all outside of the enclosure of the burg?\" asked old Karadeucq.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all--all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now let us cut down the bridge; I have broken down the chains that hold\r\nit on the other side; if the Franks take it into their heads to pursue\r\nus we shall have a long lead over them. Once we reach the forest, then,\r\ngood bye Franks! Long live the Vagrery and old Gaul! Oh, my sons, you\r\nare now free from danger! Ronan, Loysik, one more embrace, my sons!\"\r\n\r\n\"By the sacred joy of this father and his two sons, beautiful bishopess,\r\nyou are my wife. I shall not leave you unto death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Loysik, you said to me this very night in the prison, 'Fulvia, if you\r\nwere free to-day and met the Master of the Hounds, also free, what would\r\nyou answer if he asked you to be his wife?' Being now free,\" added the\r\nbishopess turning towards the Vagre, \"I shall be your devoted wife and a\r\ntrue mother if God should grant us children.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, little Odille, you have neither father nor mother left, will\r\nyou have Ronan for husband, if you survive your wounds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, even if I were dead, the hope of being your wife would raise me\r\nfrom my grave!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCOUNT AND VAGRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Loysik and Ronan on the shoulders of their companions and little\r\nOdille in the arms of the Master of the Hounds, the Vagres and the\r\nrevolted slaves hastened to reach the forest. The rear of the fleeing\r\ntroop was brought up by four Vagres, panting for breath and bent down by\r\na heavy bundle that they carried between them. It was a large coarse\r\ncloth wound around a gagged and firmly bound man, whose head was\r\nadditionally wrapped in a jacket.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that man, my brave Master of the Hounds? Do you know?\" asked\r\nRonan.\r\n\r\n\"It is Count Neroweg, whom your father dexterously kidnapped from the\r\nvery midst of the leudes with the aid of two of his comrades.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neroweg in our power! In the power of Ronan, Loysik and Karadeucq, the\r\ndescendants of Schanvoch! Heaven and earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, old Karadeucq, come this way--Ronan will not believe that we\r\nkidnapped the Frankish wild-boar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my sons, that fellow whose head is concealed in a jacket, and whom\r\nour men are carrying, is Neroweg--it is my share of the booty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is your share, Karadeucq--but we, the count's former slaves, demand\r\nto have his skin and bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity that we have not the bishop also--the feast would be\r\ncomplete.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lion of Poitiers killed the bishop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, are you sure that infamous bishop is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I saw him fall under the sword of the Lion of Poitiers. The blow\r\nalmost clove him in two.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you manage to capture Neroweg?\"\r\n\r\n\"I kept my eyes upon you and Loysik from a distance, as you were carried\r\ntowards the bridge by our Vagres who shouted: 'Room there, room for the\r\nwounded leudes whom we have saved from the ruins.' Mixing in, together\r\nwith three other of our men, among the distracted crowd of leudes and\r\nloyal slaves, who were running about helter skelter, I suddenly saw the\r\ncount running all alone at a distance, and carrying in his arms with\r\ngreat difficulty two heavy skin bags, probably filled with gold and\r\nsilver; he was running towards a dry well. Neroweg was at that moment\r\nalone and a considerable distance away from the burning buildings. The\r\nthought struck me to seize the man. Together with two of our men I crept\r\nbehind the bushes around the cistern into which the count threw one of\r\nthe bags, fearing, no doubt, that their contents might be stolen from\r\nhim in the general turmoil. The three of us fell upon him unawares, and\r\nthrew him down; I planted both my knees upon his chest and both my hands\r\nover his mouth to keep him from crying out for help; one of our men took\r\noff his jacket, gagged Neroweg and wrapped the jacket over the Frank's\r\nhead, while our other companion tied his feet, legs and arms firmly,\r\ntook a large piece of rough cloth that lay near and wound it around the\r\nseigneur count. The bridge lay not far away; we could see it from where\r\nwe stood--and that is the way in which I captured my booty. We are now\r\nfar enough away from the burg; the count's voice could not be heard\r\nthere. Remove the jacket from his head and the gag from his mouth.\r\nHurrah for the Vagrery!\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Neroweg was uncovered and ungagged Karadeucq said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Count, your hands will remain bound, but I shall now free your legs.\r\nWill you walk to the forest with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to kill me there! Let us walk, accursed mountebank, you will\r\nsee how a Frank marches with a firm step to death--you Gallic dogs, race\r\nof slaves!\"\r\n\r\nThe outskirt of the forest was reached at the peep of dawn--a flitting\r\nmoment in the month of June. At the distance a ruddy glamour was seen\r\nstruggling against the approaching light of day--it was the\r\nconflagration that still raged over the ruins of the burg.\r\n\r\nRonan and the hermit-laborer were laid upon the grass, with little\r\nOdille seated beside them. On her knees near the young girl, the\r\nbishopess tended her wounds. The Vagres and the revolted slaves stood in\r\na circle around. Neroweg stood pinioned, but savage and resolute of\r\ncountenance--those barbarians and thieves, however cowardly in their\r\nvengeance, are, it must be admitted even by us, their enemies, endowed\r\nwith a certain savage bravery--he cast an intrepid look at the Vagres.\r\nOld Karadeucq, who had preserved his vigor, looked youthed by fully\r\ntwenty years. The joy of having saved his sons and of having Neroweg in\r\nhis power seemed to impart new life to him. His eyes sparkled, his\r\ncheeks were aflame, he contemplated the count with greedy looks.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be revenged,\" said Ronan, \"you will be revenged, little\r\nOdille.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ronan, I ask no vengeance for myself; in our prison I often said to the\r\ngood hermit-laborer: 'If ever I should be free again, I shall not return\r\nevil for evil.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sweet child--as sweet as pardon. But you need not fear, our father\r\nwill not kill that man unarmed,\" answered Loysik.\r\n\r\n\"Will he not kill him, brother? Aye, by the devil! Our father will kill\r\nthe Frank as sure as he put us both to the torture, and that he beat and\r\nviolated this poor child! Blood and massacre, no mercy!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Ronan, our father will not kill a defenseless man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are long about killing me!\" put in the captured count. \"What are\r\nyou waiting for! And you, accursed mountebank, the chief of these\r\nbandits, why do you look at me in that way in silence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, Neroweg, in contemplating you as I do, I am thinking of the\r\npast. I am conjuring up family recollections in which one of your\r\nancestors, the Terrible Eagle, is mixed.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a great chief,\" answered the Frank proudly; \"he was a great\r\nKing, one of the bravest warriors of my lineage. His name is still\r\nglorified in Germany--my shame remains hidden at the bottom of my\r\ngrave--if you dig a grave for me, cursed dogs!\"\r\n\r\n\"It happened more than three hundred years ago; a great battle was\r\ndelivered on the banks of the Rhine between the Gauls and the Franks.\r\nOne of my ancestors fought with yours--the Terrible Eagle. It was a\r\ndesperate struggle; it was not merely a fight between soldier and\r\nsoldier, it was a conflict between two races that were fated foes! My\r\nancestor had a presentiment that the stock of Neroweg would be fatal to\r\nours, and he sought to kill him in order to extinguish his family. Fate\r\nwilled it otherwise. Alas, my ancestor's forebodings did not deceive\r\nhim. This is the second time that our two families meet across the ages.\r\nYou had my two sons put to the torture, and to-day they were to be\r\nexecuted upon your orders. Now you are in my power; you are about to\r\ndie, and your stock will be extinct.\"\r\n\r\nA flash of joy lighted the Frank's eyes, and he answered with a firm\r\nvoice: \"Kill me!\"\r\n\r\n\"My Vagres, this man belongs to me--it is my part of the booty.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is yours, old Karadeucq--you may dispose of him at your pleasure.\r\nSay the word and we will strike him down dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish him to be unbound; I wish him to have the full use of his\r\nlimbs--but make a strong circle around us two, so that he can not run\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here we are--a strong circle of swords' points, axes, pikes and sharp\r\nscythes--he will not be able to break through.\"\r\n\r\n\"A priest!\" suddenly cried the count in accents of anguish. \"I do not\r\nwish to die without the assistance of a priest! Will you assist me,\r\nhermit-laborer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" cried Loysik, \"do not kill this man in that manner!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not ask you for my life, Gallic dogs! Slaves! But I do not wish to\r\ngo to hell! I ask the absolution of a priest!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take this axe, Count Neroweg; we shall be equally armed; the combat\r\nbetween us is to be to the death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, in the name of your two sons, whom you have just saved, desist\r\nfrom this combat.\"\r\n\r\n\"My sons, this axe does not weigh heavy in my hands--I shall extinguish\r\nin this Frank the stock of the Nerowegs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, a man of an illustrious family, do battle with a beggar, a Vagre, a\r\nrevolted slave! No! I shall not bestow such an honor upon you, bastard\r\ndog--you may slay me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seize him, and shave his head smooth like a slave. Shame upon the\r\ncoward!\"\r\n\r\n\"I, shaved like a vile slave! I, undergo such an outrage! I prefer to do\r\nbattle with you, vile bandit; give me the axe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is, count. And you, my brave Vagres, widen the circle--and long\r\nlive Gaul!\"\r\n\r\nNeroweg precipitated himself upon the Vagre; the combat was engaged; it\r\nwas frightful, stubborn. Loysik, Ronan, little Odille and the bishopess\r\nfollowed trembling and with anxious eyes the events of the struggle. It\r\ndid not last long. Karadeucq spoke truly. The axe did not weigh heavy in\r\nhis vigorous hand; it swung in the air and fell with a crash upon the\r\nforehead of Neroweg, who rolled down upon the grass with his skull\r\ncleaved in twain.\r\n\r\n\"Die!\" cried Karadeucq with a triumphant air. \"The stock of the Terrible\r\nEagle will no longer pursue the stock of Joel!\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie, Gallic dog! My stock is not extinct. I have a son of my second\r\nwife at Soissons--and my present wife, Godegisele, is with child. My\r\nstock will live!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a feeble voice, the dying man added:\r\n\r\n\"Hermit laborer, give me paradise--my good Bishop Cautin, have pity upon\r\nme! Oh, I am going to hell! to hell! the demons!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Neroweg expired, his face contracted in diabolical terror.\r\n\r\nMissing the count, his leudes must have concluded that he lay buried\r\nunder the smoldering ruins; some feared that the revolted slaves\r\ncaptured and took him with them. If they searched for him, they must\r\nhave found the count's body at the outskirts of the forest, with his\r\nskull cleaved in twain by an axe blow, and stretched out at the foot of\r\na tree, with the outward bark ripped off and on the bare trunk of which\r\nthe following words were engraved with the point of a dagger:\r\n\r\n\"_Karadeucq, the Vagre, a descendant of the Gaul Joel, the brenn of the\r\ntribe of Karnak, killed this Frankish count, a descendant of Neroweg,\r\nthe Terrible Eagle. Long live Gaul._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nGHILDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nAT THE HEARTH OF JOEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years have passed since the death of Count Neroweg. We are now in\r\nwinter; the wind moans, the snow falls. It was on the day following a\r\nsimilar night that, nearly fifty years ago, Karadeucq, the grandson of\r\nold Araim left the paternal roof, under which the following narrative\r\ntakes place, in order to run the Bagaudy, seduced thereto by a peddler's\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nOld Araim died long ago, never ceasing to sorrow over the loss of\r\nKaradeucq, his pet. Jocelyn and Madalen, Karadeucq's father and mother\r\nalso are dead. His elder brother Kervan and his sweet sister Roselyk\r\nstill live and inhabit the same homestead situated near the sacred\r\nstones of Karnak. Kervan is over sixty years of age; he married late;\r\nhis son, now fifteen years of age, is called Yvon. The blonde Roselyk,\r\nsister of Kervan, is nearly as old as her brother; her hair has turned\r\nwhite; she has remained single and lives with her brother and his wife\r\nMartha.\r\n\r\nIt is night; out of doors the wind blows and the snow falls.\r\n\r\nKervan, his sister, his wife, his son and several of their relatives,\r\nwho cultivate with them the identical fields that more than six hundred\r\nyears ago Joel cultivated with his family, are engaged near the\r\nfireplace at several household tasks, the favorite pastimes during the\r\nlong nights of winter. A violent gust of wind blows open the door and\r\nseveral windows. Kervan remarks to his sister:\r\n\r\n\"Good Roselyk, it was on such a night as this, many long years ago, that\r\na cursed peddler came to our door. Do you remember the incident?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, I do! The next morning our poor brother Karadeucq left us\r\nforever. His disappearance gave so much pain to our grandfather Araim\r\nthat he died of a broken heart, and shortly after we lost our mother,\r\nwho was almost crazed with grief. Our father Jocelyn alone withstood the\r\nbereavement. Oh, our brother Karadeucq was but too heavily punished for\r\nwishing to see the Korrigans!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Korrigans, aunt Roselyk!\" cried Yvon, Kervan's son. \"The little\r\nfairies of olden times, of which good old Gildas, the shearer of the\r\nsheep, often talks? They have not been seen in this country for a long\r\ntime, neither the Korrigans nor the other little dwarfs, called Dus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, my boy, the country is now free from those evil\r\nsprites--but for them your uncle Karadeucq might now be in our midst by\r\nthe fireplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you never hear from him, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, my son! He surely died in one of those civil wars, those\r\ndisasters that continue to rend old Gaul under the reign of the\r\ndescendants of Clovis.\"\r\n\r\n\"May our Brittany be ever spared the ills that so cruelly afflict the\r\nother provinces!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our old Armorica has until now been able to preserve her independence\r\nand repel all attempts at invasion from the Franks. Why should we be any\r\nless able to hold our own in the future? The chiefs of our tribes, whom\r\nwe choose ourselves, are brave. The chief of the chiefs whom these have\r\nchosen, old Kando, and who keeps watch at our frontiers, is an intrepid\r\nand experienced man. Did we not triumphantly repel all the attacks of\r\nthe Franks until now?\"\r\n\r\n\"And already three times have you been called to take up arms, Kervan,\r\nand were forced to leave me, together with your sister Roselyk and our\r\nson Yvon, in mortal fear,\" exclaimed Martha, Kervan's wife.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, you poor timid Gallic woman. Remember our family\r\nlegends--Margarid, Joel's wife; Meroë, the wife of Albinik the mariner;\r\nEllen, the wife of Schanvoch--did they ever exhibit such weakness when\r\ntheir husbands took the field to fight for the freedom of Gaul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, no! And Margarid as well as Meroë met death on the battlefield,\r\ntogether with their husbands.\"\r\n\r\n\"While I have been only once wounded in battle against the accursed\r\nFranks, whom we cut to pieces on our frontier.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you seem, brother, to forget all about the danger that you ran\r\nduring the last vintage. That was an odd vintage! It had to be garnered\r\nwith the sword on the side and the axe ready in hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Those were mere pleasure parties. We sallied forth gaily, and\r\nwent beyond our own borders to harvest the crops of grapes that the\r\nFranks make their slaves raise in the region of Nantes. By the beard of\r\nJoel! He would have laughed a hearty laugh at the sight of our troops\r\nrecrossing our frontier gaily escorting our large carts full of red\r\ngrapes! What a pleasing sight! The yokes of our oxen, the bridles of the\r\nhorses and even the iron of our lances were festooned with green vine\r\nleaves. And we marched to the rhythmic measure of the chant that we sang\r\nin chorus:\r\n\r\n    \"'The Franks, they shall not drink it,\r\n    This wine of our old Gaul--\r\n    No, the Franks, they shall not drink it!\r\n    We make our vintage, sword and pruning-hook in hand.\r\n    Our chariots, used in war, are our rolling presses.\r\n    It is not blood that crimsons deep their axle-trees,\r\n    It is the purple juice of ruddy grapes.\r\n    The Franks, they shall not drink it,\r\n    This wine of our old Gaul--\r\n    No, the Franks, they shall not drink it!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, I shall be sixteen years old next vintage in the country of\r\nNantes--will you not take me with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep still, Yvon! Make not such requests. They frighten me,\" cried the\r\nboy's mother.\r\n\r\n\"Roselyk, dear sister, do not my wife's words remind you of our mother\r\nscolding our brother Karadeucq because he wished to see the Korrigans?\r\nShe used to say: 'Hold your tongue, bad boy!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, brother, all mothers' hearts are alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, I hear steps outside--it must be old Gildas. He promised to\r\ncome this evening and teach us a new chant that he learned from a\r\ntraveling tailor. Yes, it is he! Good evening, old Gildas!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, my boy; good evening to all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut the door, old Gildas. The air is cold; come near the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kervan, I am not alone. A stranger accompanies me. He knocked at my\r\ndoor and asked for the house where Kervan, the son of Jocelyn, dwells.\r\nThe traveler comes from Vannes, and even further. He wishes to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does he not step in?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is shaking off the snow that covers him from head to foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God, Gildas! Is the man a peddler?\"\r\n\r\n\"Roselyk, Roselyk, does not that also sound like mother? You are right,\r\nall mothers' hearts are alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Martha; the young man does not look like a peddler to me. Judging\r\nby his resolute mien, he would sooner be taken for a soldier. He carries\r\na long dagger in his belt--here he is himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Step in, traveler. Did you ask for the dwelling of Kervan, the son of\r\nJocelyn? Do you wish to see Kervan? I am Kervan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Greeting to you and yours, Kervan. But why do you look at me so\r\nwonderingly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Roselyk, look well at this young man--look at his eyes, his forehead,\r\nhis bearing, his face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, brother, one sees strange resemblances at times. One would think\r\nthat our brother Karadeucq himself stood before us--that is how he\r\nlooked at the time that he ran away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Roselyk, do you not notice that the stranger seems strangely affected?\r\nThere are tears in his eyes. Say, young man, are you the son of\r\nKaradeucq?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer of Ronan the Vagre was to throw himself on the neck of his\r\nfather's brother, after which he embraced no less effusively Martha,\r\nRoselyk and Yvon. After the tears were dried and the first emotion\r\nappeased, the first words that simultaneously parted from the lips of\r\nKervan and Roselyk were:\r\n\r\n\"And our brother, our beloved Karadeucq? What tidings do you bring us\r\nfrom him?\"\r\n\r\nAt this question Ronan the Vagre remained silent; his head drooped and\r\ntears again suffused his eyes.\r\n\r\nDeep silence reigned hereat among the descendants of Joel. All eyes\r\nwept.\r\n\r\nKervan was the first to overcome his grief, and broke the silence,\r\naddressing his nephew:\r\n\r\n\"Is it long since my brother Karadeucq died?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three months, dear uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was his end peaceful? Did he remember me and Roselyk, who loved him so\r\ndearly?\"\r\n\r\n\"His last words were: 'I die without having been able to fulfill my part\r\nof the duty imposed by my ancestor Joel upon his descendants. Promise\r\nme, my son Ronan, you who are familiar with my own life and that of your\r\nbrother Loysik, to fulfill that duty in my stead, and to write down,\r\nwithout concealing aught, both the good and the evil that we have done.\r\nWhen you have done that, promise me that you will proceed to the cradle\r\nof our family, near the sacred stones of Karnak. My father Jocelyn and\r\nmy mother Madalen are certainly dead by this time. You shall deliver the\r\nnarrative that will have been written, either to my good brother Kervan,\r\nif he survives our aged parents, or to his eldest son. If Kervan should\r\nhave died without posterity, ask his heirs or his wife's to deliver to\r\nyou, obedient to the orders of our ancestor Joel, our family's legends\r\nand relics, and you are then to transmit them to your descendants. If,\r\nhowever, my brother Kervan and my sweet sister Roselyk still live, tell\r\nthem that I die with their names upon my lips and dear to my heart.'\r\nSuch were the last words uttered by my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you the account of your own and my brother's lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" answered Ronan opening his traveling bag.\r\n\r\nAnd he drew from it a parchment which he handed over to Kervan. The\r\nlatter took the scroll with deep emotion, while, taking from his belt\r\nthe long poniard with an iron hilt that Loysik and after him the Master\r\nof the Hounds had worn, and on the hilt of which were engraven the Saxon\r\nword _Ghilde_ and the two Gallic words _Friendship_, _Community_, Ronan\r\npassed the weapon to his uncle, saying:\r\n\r\n\"It was my father's wish that this poniard be added to our family\r\nrelics. When you will have read this narrative you will admit that the\r\nweapon deserves being placed together with the other articles that our\r\nancestors have bequeathed to us--pious relics, that I must ask you to\r\nshow me and which I shall contemplate with veneration. It is now getting\r\nlate. I must leave you again day after to-morrow morning. I must,\r\ntherefore, request you to read this very evening the narrative that I\r\nhave delivered to you. I shall relate to you to-morrow what remains to\r\nbe said and that I have not had the time to write down. I, on my part,\r\nhave a strong wish to read our family chronicles, the principal\r\nincidents of which my father often narrated to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Kervan taking up a lamp.\r\n\r\nRonan followed him. The two stepped into one of the chambers of the\r\nhouse. On a table lay a small iron coffer, the gift of Victoria the\r\nGreat to Schanvoch. Kervan took from the coffer the gold sickle of\r\nHena, the Virgin of the Isle of Sen, the little brass bell left by\r\nGuilhern, Sylvest's iron collar, Genevieve's silver cross and the\r\ncasque's lark of Victoria the Great. He deposited all these articles\r\nnear the poniard of Loysik. Kervan also produced from the little coffer\r\nthe several family parchments, ranked them in order before Ronan, and\r\nthen rejoined his family.\r\n\r\nThat long winter's night was spent by the Vagre reading the legends of\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\nOn their part, Kervan, his wife and sister prolonged their reading until\r\nit was almost dawn. Contrary to their wont, they did not rise with the\r\nday. With the impressions of his family history fresh upon his mind,\r\nRonan visited next morning the environs of the house. He found at every\r\nstep mementos of his ancestors--the wide field on which his ancestor and\r\nhis two sons, Guilhern and Mikael, indulged in the virile exercises of\r\nthe _mahrek-ha-droad_ still spread before his eyes; the living spring,\r\nat the edge of which Sylvest and Syomara had in their infantine games\r\nbuilt their little hut to protect themselves from the heat of the sun,\r\nstill babbled along its course.\r\n\r\nThe Vagre was drawn from his revery by the voice of his father's\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\"Ronan,\" said Kervan, \"the frost has hardened the ground and the cattle\r\ncan not be let out to-day. We shall have wheat to pound in the house.\r\nLet us go in. While we are at work you can narrate to us the events that\r\ncomplete your narrative. I promise you that I shall faithfully\r\ntranscribe them and append them to the narrative that you wrote.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nON THE HILL NEAR MARCIGNY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family of Kervan are reassembled together with Ronan in the large\r\nhall of the farmhouse. After the morning repast the women take up their\r\ndistaffs, or some other domestic work. The men pound the wheat, which\r\nthey pour out of one set of large bags and then drop into another. Huge\r\nlogs of beech and oak burn in the fireplace, seeing that outside the\r\ncold is intense. While each pursues his work in silence they cast from\r\ntime to time inquisitive looks at Ronan, the Vagre son of the Bagauder.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" says Ronan, \"did you read through the narrative that I gave you\r\nyesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and all the rest of us here assembled heard it read. But there is\r\nno mention made of my poor brother's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before broaching that subject, uncle, I should inform you of what\r\nhappened after the burning down of the burg of Neroweg.\r\n\r\n\"The complete success of our raid threw the Franks and bishops of the\r\nregion into consternation. All the slaves who were not too besotted, the\r\ncolonists whom the seigneurs rack-rented, in short, a considerable\r\nnumber of determined men joined our band. From day to day its numbers\r\nswelled and it became more redoubtable. With good or evil grace the\r\nseigneurs felt themselves forced to improve the condition of their\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n\"My brother Loysik proved himself faithful to the principle of Jesus of\r\nNazareth that it is the sick who stand in special need of a physician.\r\nHe remained with us, and soon he had a decided ascendency over our\r\ntroop. His good-heartedness, his courage, his eloquence, his love for\r\nGaul, his horror of the Frankish conquest gained him all hearts. One day\r\nhe took it into his head to undertake a journey the destination of which\r\nhe kept a secret. Shortly after that we had letters from him urging us\r\nto draw near to the confines of Burgundy; he was to join us in the\r\nneighborhood of Marcigny, a town situated at the extreme end of that\r\nprovince. Before his departure he made us promise that we would set no\r\nmore burgs and episcopal villas on fire; pillage, however, continued\r\nunabated and was distributed among the poor. Thus we administered strict\r\njustice upon the Frankish seigneurs, the bishops and abbots who enjoyed\r\na reputation for cruelty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But did not the Franks take up arms against you? Were they terrified to\r\nthat extreme?\"\r\n\r\n\"King Clotaire ordered a levy of men, but the beneficiary seigneurs\r\nfeared that, if they parted with their leudes, their burgs would remain\r\nunprotected and either at the mercy of the slaves or exposed to attacks\r\nfrom our band. They sent but few men in answer to the King's summons.\r\nAnd so we were given fresh opportunities and twice we beat the Franks in\r\npitched encounters. All the time we drew nearer and nearer to the\r\nfrontiers of Burgundy as requested by Loysik.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what of little Odille, Ronan? What became of her, poor, dear victim\r\nof Frankish brutality?\"\r\n\r\n\"I took her to wife; the dear girl never leaves me; she is as sweet as\r\nshe is brave, as devoted as she is tender.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear girl--and the bishopess, who interested us all, despite her\r\nerrors?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fulvia has become to the Master of the Hounds what Odille is to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that Prince Chram, who was scheming a parricide, did he carry out\r\nhis projected treason towards Clotaire, that other monster who stabbed\r\nhis brother's son to death?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three days ago, on my way hither, I saw Chram and his father on the\r\nfrontier of our Armorica.\"\r\n\r\n\"The father and son on our frontier?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, and they approved themselves worthy of each other. Oh, Kervan, I\r\nhave run the Vagrery in my boyhood; I have witnessed frightful scenes\r\nduring that period; but by the faith of a Vagre, I never was so\r\nterrified--I still shudder with horror when I think of what, only a few\r\ndays ago, took place under my own eyes, when Chram and his father met.\r\n\r\n\"It was a horrible spectacle--I shall presently describe it to you, but\r\nI must first return to our own affairs. Faithful to our promise to\r\nLoysik, we drew nearer to the boundaries of Burgundy. That region, one\r\nof the first that was conquered before Clovis by other hordes of\r\nbarbarians that preceded him from Germany and were called Burgunds, was\r\nfull of heroic souvenirs of old Gaul. It was there that, at the voice of\r\nVercingetorix, the Chief of the Hundred Valleys, the people first rose\r\nin arms against the Romans. Epidorix, Convictolitan, Lictavic and other\r\npatriots of that province joined with their several tribes the Chief of\r\nthe Hundred Valleys, all anxious to join him in doing battle for the\r\nfreedom of Gaul.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I suppose that once so brave region has undergone the fate of the\r\nothers?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, as elsewhere, Kervan, the bishops undermined the mental virility\r\nof the people, besotted them, and rendered them submissive prey to the\r\nconquerors.\"\r\n\r\n\"But here in our Armorican Gaul, both the Christian and the\r\nnon-Christian druids preach to us the love of country and hatred for the\r\noppressor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, consequently, Brittany has remained free. It happened otherwise\r\nwith the unfortunate province that I am speaking of. Since the year 355\r\nits population began to degenerate visibly. Two chiefs of barbarian\r\nhordes, Westralph and Chnodomar, invaded the region; other barbarians,\r\nBurgunds by name, who came from the region of Mayence, in torn drove\r\naway the first invaders and established themselves at about the year\r\n416. These Burgunds, who gave their name to the region, were a pastoral\r\npeople and less savage than the other tribes that poured in from\r\nGermany. The larger number of the original inhabitants were either cut\r\nto pieces or led into slavery at the time of the first conquest in 355.\r\nAlthough held in slavery by the Burgunds, the lot of the surviving\r\nportion of the population was less wretched than that of their brothers\r\nin most of the other conquered provinces. Gondiok, Gondehaud and his son\r\nSigismond succeeded one another as kings until 534. In that year,\r\nChildebert and Clotaire, sons of Clovis, fell upon the Burgunds, and,\r\nalthough these were of their own Germanic race, laid their country\r\nwaste, enslaved both Burgunds and Gauls, and attached the territory to\r\nthe domain of the Frankish kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"What devastation! What bloodshed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Those were horrible times, but by the faith of a Vagre, we rendered\r\nthem frightful to many a conqueror himself. Well, agreeable to the\r\nrequest of Loysik, we drew near the confines of Burgundy and arrived in\r\nthe vicinity of Marcigny early in autumn. In that happily located region\r\nthe fall of the year is as mild as summer. The sun was going down, we\r\nhad been on the march almost all day; the region, once so thickly\r\npopulated and teeming with wealth, now lay fallow and deserted. Some\r\nmore slaves joined us, others, however, fled into Marcigny, and threw\r\nthe place into alarm. We expected the return of Loysik at every moment.\r\nAs a matter of precaution we camped on a woody hill whence we could\r\nobserve the city, lying at a goodly distance away, and hardly protected\r\nby its crumbling walls. Towards evening we saw our brother proceeding\r\nout of the town. He hastened to us, having been notified of our arrival\r\nby the fleeing slaves. It seems to me I see him now climbing the hill;\r\nhe walked hurriedly; his face beamed with happiness. After answering to\r\nthe affectionate greetings of our delighted troop who surrounded him,\r\nall being eager to express to him their delight at his return, Loysik\r\nmade a sign that he wished to speak. He stepped upon a mound under the\r\noverspreading branches of a chestnut tree. We gathered in a semi-circle\r\nbefore him; many of the women who joined us in running the Vagrery sat\r\ndown at his feet on the grass. Odille and the bishopess were foremost\r\namong these. On that day Loysik wore a robe of coarse white wool; a ray\r\nof the westering sun that penetrated through the foliage above his head\r\nseemed to surround with a golden aureole his serious and sweet face, on\r\nboth sides of which, parting from his slightly bald head, fell his long\r\nblonde hair of the same color as his slight beard. I know not for what\r\nreason, but as I then looked at Loysik, the young man of Nazareth\r\noccurred to me, as he preached to the vagabond crowd that ever\r\nsurrounded him. Profound silence reigned among our troop. Loysik held an\r\naddress to us which I shortly after transcribed in full, together with\r\nall that happened on the occasion, upon a parchment lest I should forget\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nTaking a scroll from his pocket Ronan the Vagre proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Here it is--I shall read it textually to you:\r\n\r\n\"'My friends, my brothers, all of you who hear me, I return to your\r\nmidst with good tidings. Until now, you have, by means of frightful acts\r\nof reprisal, returned evil with evil to the Franks, the abbots and\r\nbishops. These wicked folks so willed it--violence invites violence,\r\noppression invites revolt, iniquity invites vengeance. The threatening\r\nwords of Jesus have been verified--_They that take the sword, shall\r\nperish by the sword; Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, for ye bind\r\nheavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders;\r\nbut ye yourselves will not move them with one of your fingers; Woe unto\r\nyou that are rich, for ye have received your consolation._ To the poor\r\nwho lacked the necessaries of life you gave the goods that you took from\r\nthe conquering plunderers, or from the modern princes of the Church.\r\nStruck with terror, many a hard-hearted seigneur and prelate felt forced\r\nto relax his severity. You have administered justice; but, alas, an\r\nadventurous, merciless justice. It could not be otherwise. In these days\r\nof tyranny and civil war, of slavery and revolt, of atrocious misery and\r\ncriminal opulence, people are hurled from the paths of morality. The\r\ninnate sense of justice and injustice, of good and evil is beclouded in\r\nthe popular mind. Some, besotted with terror, undergo unheard-of ills\r\nwith abject and degrading resignation; others, a prey to headlong\r\nvertigo, mix actions of greatest nobility with deeds that are most\r\nreprehensible. Your vengeance fatedly begets incalculable misfortunes.\r\nNo doubt there is now many a seigneur, who, merciless until recently,\r\ndoes now conduct himself with less cruelty towards his slaves, as a\r\nconsequence of the terror with which you inspire him. But the next day?\r\nYou will then be far away, and the butchers then resume their murderous\r\npropensities. You set the homes of the conquerors on fire; but those\r\nbuildings are speedily raised again, and it is our brothers, the slaves,\r\nwho are forced to rebuild them. You distribute among the poor a part of\r\nthe tribute that you levy upon the seigneurs and the prelates; but after\r\na few days of abundance, misery weighs anew upon the unhappy population,\r\nand, by contrast, it is more painful than before. The coffers that you\r\nrifle must all be refilled by our brothers, the slaves, by dint of fresh\r\nand crushing labors. What floods of tears! What floods of blood are\r\nshed! How many ruins mark your tracks, how many irreparable disasters!'\r\n\r\n\"A voice cried out from the crowd: 'Have not our conquerors shed the\r\nblood of our race in torrents? Let the world perish, together with the\r\niniquity that racks us! Death to the oppressors! Death to the seigneurs\r\nand the priests!'\r\n\r\n\"My brother then proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"'Perish iniquity! Aye, perish slavery! Aye, perish misery and\r\nignorance! Like you, I hold the barbarian conquest in horror; like you,\r\nI hold subjection in horror; like you, I hold in horror the false\r\npriests of Jesus, who keep their fellowmen in bondage; like you, I hold\r\nin horror the degradation of our country. But in order to overcome\r\nbarbarism, ignorance, misery and slavery, they must be combated with\r\ncivilization, with intelligence, with virtue, with labor, with the\r\nawakened Gallic patriotism that lies torpid at the bottom of so many\r\nhearts!'\r\n\r\n\"'Hermit, our friend,' the interrupter cried again, 'how else can we\r\nfight our enemies than arms in hand? Are we not \"Wand'ring Men,\"\r\n\"Wolves,\" \"Wolves' Heads\"?'\r\n\r\n\"'What is it that has turned you into Vagres, ye men of all conditions?\r\nWhat is it that drove you to revolt? Is it not spoliation and misery,\r\nand a determination to be free rather than submit to slavery? If you\r\nwere to be told: \"Renounce your wandering lives, and your labor will\r\nsupply you amply with the necessaries of life, and your courage will\r\nguarantee your safety and tranquility. You who regret having lost the\r\njoys of the hearth and of family life or who desire to partake of\r\nthem--yours can be those pure delights, while you others who prefer\r\naustere seclusion can be free to indulge your bent, and you can live\r\nhappy and peacefully;\"--if you were to be promised that, would you not\r\nprefer it to your present life?'\r\n\r\n\"'Hermit, are such prospects possible? You are not of the number of\r\nfalse priests who pretend to have the power of performing miracles.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, had they only willed it, the bishops could have performed such\r\nmiracles every day in the name of the human fraternity preached by\r\nJesus. Aye, had they all acted like the bishop of Chalon, a path of\r\npacific emancipation would have been opened to Gaul.'\r\n\r\n\"'And what did the bishop of Chalon do?'\r\n\r\n\"'Upon leaving you, I proceeded to yonder little town of Marcigny, which\r\nbelongs to the diocese of Chalon and where the bishop owns a villa\r\nwhich he occupies in summer. He is not a wicked man, although he does\r\nkeep his fellowmen in bondage. He has spent his days in quiet, idleness\r\nand opulence. He is a great friend of King Clotaire. I proceeded to that\r\nbishop. I shall narrate to you the conversation that took place between\r\nus:\r\n\r\n\"'I said: \"Did you ever hear about the Vagres?\" \"Alas, yes! Those people\r\ncommit grave crimes in other regions. But, thank God, the Vagrery never\r\nentered Burgundy.\" \"Well, bishop, I wish to inform you that bands of\r\nVagres are approaching your diocese.\" \"Oh, woe is me! Woe is all of us!\r\nWhat will become of us all? My diocese will be ravaged, my treasury\r\npillaged, my palace in Chalon sacked, my villa burned down! Monk, what\r\ndesolation!\" \"Bishop, is not the Valley of Charolles located in your\r\ndiocese?\" \"It belongs to glorious King Clotaire, like all the rest of\r\nthe lands of Gaul that have not been distributed as benefices either by\r\nhimself, or by his father, King Clovis, to the chiefs of the leudes and\r\nthe Church.\" \"Are you not a friend of Clotaire's?\" \"That great King\r\nshows me a good deal of kindness.\" \"Demand of him in my name the gift of\r\nthe Valley of Charolles; I shall found there a community of\r\nmonk-laborers. Around the monastery a lay colony will be established,\r\nopen to the Vagres. A portion of the lands shall be reserved for the\r\nmonk-laborers, the rest shall be left to the colonists. But the gift\r\nmust be absolute, hereditary and free from all taxes, fees or imposts.\r\nThe colonists are to be recognized as free in fact and by right, they\r\nand their descendants. Obtain the donation for me from King Clotaire,\r\nand the troop of Vagres, instead of becoming a source of terror to the\r\nregion, will be a source of security to your diocese.\" Such was the\r\nconversation. The bishop hastened to forward my application to King\r\nClotaire; and yesterday a royal messenger brought the King's answer.\r\nHere it is, I shall read it to you.\r\n\r\n\"'It runs thus: \"Clotaire, illustrious warrior, King of the Franks. The\r\nfunction and duty of a King is to come to the help of the servants of\r\nGod and to receive their prayers favorably. Moreover, seeing that we\r\nsojourn but a short time in this life, it is important that we hasten to\r\nstore up wealth in heaven. We can easily store up such wealth through\r\ngenerous donations to the bishops and the Church. Therefore, we receive\r\nfavorably the request of our venerable father in Christ, Florent, bishop\r\nof Chalon-on-the-Saone, and we hereby inform all our loyal subjects, now\r\nand in the future, that a certain monk named Loysik has asked us through\r\nthe intermediary of the said Florent, our venerable father in Christ and\r\nfriend, a tract of land where he may live freely, pray and implore\r\ndivine mercy for us. He has added that he is followed by a large number\r\nof men whom he wishes to withdraw from the disorders and the miseries of\r\nthe century. Those men have promised to settle down near him, and to\r\ndevote themselves to a peaceful and industrious life. Whereas, we\r\nconsider the monk's request wise, and whereas furthermore we are of\r\nopinion that if we receive it favorably we shall be performing a work\r\nagreeable to God and meritorious for the remission of our sins, we\r\nhereby grant to the said monk the possession of the Valley of Charolles,\r\nsituated in the diocese of Chalon, bounded to the north by the mountains\r\nknown as the Balue Rocks; to the south by the river Charolles, an arm of\r\nwhich crosses the said valley; to the west by the ravine known as Goats'\r\nForest, which is contiguous to the lands of the church of Marcigny. We\r\ncede to the said monk all that he may find on said territory--slaves,\r\ndomestic animals, buildings, vines, cultivated fields, meadows and\r\nwoodlands. He shall have the free use of them all, without anyone\r\nwhosoever having the right to hinder him, to build or to plant. We\r\nexempt him and those who may settle with him in the said Valley of\r\nCharolles, of all contributions to our fisc. We forbid all our leudes,\r\nbishops, dukes, counts and all others to exact, either for themselves or\r\ntheir suites, whether moneys, presents, quarter or rents from the said\r\nmonk Loysik, or from those who may settle down upon the territory that\r\nwe have ceded to him, they being held and recognized by us as free men.\r\nLet no one be audacious enough to violate our commandments. We will it\r\nthat the said monk Loysik, his companions and their successors live\r\nfree and undisturbed under our protection. And in order that these\r\npresents shall have greater force, we have willed that they be signed by\r\nour own hand and sealed with our seal. CLOTAIRE.\"\r\n\r\n\"'As he placed this charter in my hand the bishop added: \"Now, monk,\r\nmake good use of this donation and prevent the Vagres from ravaging my\r\ndiocese.\"\r\n\r\n\"'While the bishop was saying these words to me, some fugitive slaves\r\nrushed in and announced to him the approach of your troop. The prelate\r\nthereupon said to me imploringly: \"Go, run, monk, I am ready for any\r\nsacrifice in order to live in peace with those redoubtable neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\"'It now, my friends and brothers, rests with you whether you will live\r\nhappy and free. Those of you who are willing to enter our community of\r\nhermit-laborers will be admitted; those who, preferring family life, may\r\nwish to join a woman of their choice shall be settled upon the\r\nhereditary lands. I have visited the valley in all its parts; a river,\r\nwell stocked with fish, crosses the meadows, magnificent woods shade it,\r\nvines and cereals flourish on its slopes, the cattle on its meadows are\r\nnumerous. The poor slaves who were either born upon the place or\r\ntransported thither will be set free; the lands that they have hitherto\r\ncultivated for the royal fisc will henceforth be theirs as hereditary\r\nproperty. The valley is immense. Even if we were ten times more numerous\r\nthan we are, the soil's fertility will supply our wants. The lands that\r\nKing Clotaire restores to us in the form of a gift have been violently\r\nconquered more than two centuries ago by tribes of barbarians, they were\r\nsubsequently invaded by the Burgunds, and finally conquered over again\r\nby the Franks. Portions of the land are not cultivated; the race that\r\nowned them more than two hundred and fifty years ago, before the\r\ninvasion, has long been extinct. The people who once inhabited them have\r\nbeen either cut to pieces during the successive conquests or have been\r\nled far away into slavery, or have died under the yoke working for\r\nothers on their own ancestral domains--they are no more. By occupying\r\nthis portion of the soil of Gaul we dispossess none of our own race.\r\nBut, at an emergency, we must be able to defend the territory from\r\naggression. In these days of civil wars, donations, however perpetual,\r\nare not always respected by the inheritors of the royal power, nor by\r\nthe seigneurs and the bishops. We must, accordingly, be ready to repel\r\nforce with force. The valley is protected towards the north by almost\r\ninaccessible rocky cliffs; on the south by a deep river; on the west by\r\nrugged ravines, and to the east by a dense forest. It will be an easy\r\nthing for us to fortify ourselves in our possession and maintain our\r\nrights.'\"\r\n\r\nKervan followed closely the Vagre's narrative and asked him with deep\r\ninterest whether his companions took the advice of Loysik.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear uncle, almost all the Vagres accepted Loysik's offer; few\r\nonly preferred to continue their life of adventure. They left us with\r\nthe promise, however, not to enter Burgundy. We never since heard of\r\nthem. Among those who now people the Valley of Charolles, many have\r\nadopted the rules of the monk-laborers under the direction of Loysik.\r\nThe large majority of our companions, however, have organized a lay\r\ncommunity around the monastery; they married either women who ran the\r\nVagrery with us or daughters of neighboring colonists. I wedded little\r\nOdille, while the Master of the Hounds took the bishopess for his mate.\r\nThe artisans whom slavery and want had driven to the Vagrery, resumed\r\ntheir former occupations, and now work for the colony; others tend the\r\nfields, the vines and the cattle. As to myself, I have become a good\r\nhusbandman, and my little Odille, who since her childhood was accustomed\r\nto tend flocks of sheep in the mountains where she was born has turned\r\nto that occupation. The bishopess works at the distaff, spins and weaves\r\nlike a skilful housekeeper, and also oversees the hospital which we\r\nopened for sick women. Loysik superintends the hospital of men in the\r\nmonastery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Ronan! Why did not the bishops act like your father, seeing they\r\ndid not follow the example of our venerated druids, and preach a holy\r\nwar against the Franks? Why did not the Church restore to their former\r\nowners the vast domains that they find it so easy to wheedle from the\r\ncredulity of the Frankish Kings and seigneurs? Or, in cases where the\r\nformer owners are no more, why does not the Church distribute the land\r\namong the slaves that cultivate it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, the prelacy has preferred to reign over a brutified people; they\r\ndid not like to live a simple life among a free people. Oh! It will be\r\ndone for our old Armorica if she ever falls under the yoke of the\r\npriests!\"\r\n\r\n\"May it please heaven that such a fatality may never befall our beloved\r\nregion! Let us put aside such sad thoughts; let us rather talk of the\r\npeaceful and industrious life of the colony of Charolles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we live happy in our beloved valley, where we cultivate our fields\r\nin common and share the fruits of our labor, agreeable to the words that\r\nyou saw graven on the hilt of the poniard that I delivered to\r\nyou--_Friendship_, _Community_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the meaning of that other word--_Ghilde?_\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a Saxon word; it means association, fraternity. In the northern\r\ncountry where the word comes from there is a custom, the origin of which\r\nis lost in the remotest ages, according to which all the members of a\r\n_ghilde_ pledge to one another with a mysterious oath friendship, mutual\r\nsupport and solidarity in all things. If the house of one of the\r\nassociates burns down, all the others help him in rebuilding it; if his\r\ncrops are destroyed by a storm or any other accident, all the associates\r\ncontribute their share to indemnify him for his loss; likewise if his\r\nvessel is lost at sea. Is anyone of them afraid to undertake a long\r\nvoyage alone, one, two or several of his associates accompany him; is\r\nany member of the _ghilde_ the victim of some iniquity, all the others\r\ntake his part in order to secure justice; is he insulted, all the others\r\nrally around him to aid him in obtaining reparation or vengeance. Our\r\ncommunity has put into practice the virtues of that custom. We say\r\nthere, as once we said in Vagrery: _All for each, each for all_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my brother Karadeucq, did he long enjoy that peaceful life after a\r\nlife of so many hardships?\"\r\n\r\n\"He lived happy in my house unto the day of his death, and he was able\r\nto bless my first-born child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us the circumstances of my brother's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the written narrative that I delivered to you, you must have seen\r\nwhat kind of a man was Chram, the son of King Clotaire. His projects of\r\nrevolt having failed in Poitou and Auvergne, he made a raid into\r\nBurgundy at the head of a few troops in the expectation of raising the\r\ncountry against his father. The counts and dukes of the reign considered\r\nit in their interest to take the field against Chram in this new civil\r\nwar. Nevertheless, he laid part of the country waste. One of the bands\r\nof Chram arrived near our valley. Foreseeing the need thereof in these\r\ndisturbed times, my father and Loysik had the unprotected accesses of\r\nthe valley fortified with fosses and entrenchments made of felled trees.\r\nOur colonists and the men of the monastery took turns in mounting guard\r\nat these places the moment the invasion of Burgundy by Chram was known.\r\nMy father was in command of one of the advanced posts when Chram's\r\nwarriors approached our valley for the purpose of ravaging it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume an armed encounter took place between Chram's soldiers and\r\nthe inhabitants of Charolles, and my poor brother Karadeucq--\"\r\n\r\n\"Was mortally wounded as he drove the Franks back at the head of his\r\nmen. My father died after giving me the orders that I stated to you. He\r\nwore during the combat the Saxon poniard that belonged to Loysik, and\r\nwhich the Master of the Hounds had picked up as he fled from the field\r\nof carnage at the fastness of Allange. The Master of the Hounds returned\r\nthe poniard to my brother after our flight from the burg of Neroweg.\r\nLoysik afterwards presented the weapon to my father. He wore it on the\r\nday of the encounter with the Franks. He ordered me to bring it to you,\r\nin order that it be joined to our family relics.\"\r\n\r\n\"My brother's death was brave, like his life. A curse upon that Chram,\r\nson of Clotaire! Had he not raided Burgundy, my brother Karadeucq might\r\nstill be alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"Like you, Kervan, I say a curse upon Chram! But, at any rate, he met on\r\nthe frontiers of our Brittany the merited punishment for his criminal\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF CHRAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Kervan,\" Ronan the Vagre proceeded after a short respite, \"it\r\nalmost looks as if these Frankish Kings and all their family are\r\npredestined to become the subjects of horror to the whole world. I shall\r\nnow narrate to you the manner of Chram's death.\r\n\r\n\"My father had made me promise him at the last moments of his life that\r\nI would repair hither, to the cradle of our family, so soon as I wrote\r\nthe chronicle that I delivered to you, but which I could not finish for\r\nthe reasons that I shall state.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing more difficult or more perilous than a long journey in\r\nthese disastrous days. The traveler runs at every step the risk of being\r\ncaptured on the road and led away a prisoner by the armed bands of the\r\ndukes, the counts, the seigneurs or the bishops who are in perpetual\r\nfeuds with one another, plundering or raiding one another's domains,\r\never intent upon enlarging their possessions. As a consequence, whoever\r\nis compelled to undertake a journey never ventures outside of the cities\r\nexcept with considerable numbers, so as to be in condition to repel the\r\narmed bands. I learned that a company of travelers was to leave the city\r\nof Marcigny for Moulins. That was exactly my route. I left the valley\r\nand joined the caravan. We left Marcigny in a body of nearly three\r\nhundred persons--men, women and children--some on foot, others mounted,\r\nall bound to Moulins as the first station. At that city other travelers\r\nwere expected to proceed to Bourges. At Bourges I counted upon being\r\nable to join a third body and reach Tours, and in that way to proceed\r\nupon my journey to Saumur and then to Nantes, which would bring me to\r\nthe very frontier of Brittany. On the stretch between Marcigny and\r\nTours, our troop of travelers were repeatedly compelled to drive off\r\nmarauding bands of armed men. In one of these encounters I was wounded,\r\nbut only slightly; but several of my traveling companions were killed,\r\nwhile some others were captured and carried, together with their\r\nfamilies, into slavery. The bulk of our troop, however, myself included,\r\nwere fortunate enough to arrive safely at Tours, and there to rest in\r\nsecurity.\"\r\n\r\n\"What horrible days these are! It would not be any more dangerous to\r\ntravel in a hostile country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Kervan, if you could see the ravages of the conquest! Ruins\r\neverywhere, fresh and old ones. Our former Gallic roads and highways, so\r\nbeautifully wide and carefully kept, with their relays of post horses\r\nand inns, are now all wild and heaps of ruins. Communication, once so\r\neasy from one end of Gaul to the other, is now wholly broken up. In one\r\nplace the road breaks off because it crosses over the domain of some\r\nFrankish seigneur or of some abbey; at another place the bridges have\r\nbeen broken down by some armed band, that, being closely pursued, sought\r\nto protect its retreat. Thus we were compelled to make wide detours in\r\norder to arrive at our journey's end. Several nights were spent on the\r\nopen fields. We were at times compelled to fell trees near the banks of\r\na river and build a raft to effect a crossing, there being none other\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my arrival in Tours, I learned that King Clotaire was there\r\ngathering troops in order to march in person against his son Chram, who\r\nhad just crossed Touraine and was moving in the direction of the\r\nfrontiers of Brittany. I thought the chances favorable to finish my\r\njourney in safety. I followed in the wake of the royal troops, which\r\nconsisted of leudes and soldiers, the latter of whom were furnished to\r\nthe King by the beneficiary seigneurs, and also of impressed colonists.\r\nWhen the King's army put itself in march, I followed. Alas, Kervan! The\r\nenemy's forces themselves could not have been more merciless towards the\r\npeople than were the royal troops. Upon their arrival in a town the\r\nFranks would drive the residents from their houses, they would then take\r\npossession, consume the provisions, beat the men, outrage the women, and\r\ndestroy everything that they could not carry with them. Clotaire joined\r\nhis troops with his bodyguard at Nantes. It was there that I saw the\r\nmonster for the first time. He wore a long blood-colored dalmatica\r\nembroidered in gold; over the costly vestment he had a hooded fur\r\njacket, with the hood half drawn over his forehead. From under his coif\r\nhis eyes glistened like those of a wild cat. The King's cadaverous\r\nvisage was set in long locks of grey hair that reached almost to his\r\nwaist. He rode a large war steed, black of coat and caparisoned in red.\r\nAt his left rode his constable; at his right the bishop of Nantes.\r\n\r\n\"Being left with only a few troops, Chram had fled before the superior\r\nforces of his father. His plan was to enter Brittany. But he found Kando\r\non guard at the frontier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kando is one of the bravest and alertest warriors of Armorica.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accompanied by his worthy friend Spatachair--the Lion of Poitiers, the\r\nrenegade Gaul of whom mention is made in the written narrative that I\r\ndelivered to you, died insane--Chram proceeded to Kando's camp and\r\nproposed to him that he join his Breton troops to the Franks in order to\r\nmake head against his father, Clotaire.\r\n\r\n\"'I am always delighted to see the Franks cutting one another's\r\nthroats,' Kando answered Chram; 'nevertheless the horror that your\r\nparricidal projects inspire me with is such that, although your father\r\nhimself is a monster after your own kind, I refuse to enter into any\r\nalliance with you. My own troops are enough to fight Clotaire if he\r\nshould take it into his head to invade our territory, which, until now\r\nno Frank has attempted with impunity.'\r\n\r\n\"Feeling at least certain of Kando's neutrality, but nevertheless\r\ncrowded into a corner at the frontier of Armorica, Chram now stood at\r\nbay and prepared for a desperate combat on the morrow. He imagined that\r\nif the worst were to befall him, his escape would in any event be\r\ncertain, seeing that he had taken the precaution of keeping a vessel\r\nready to embark in near the little port of Croisik.\r\n\r\n\"I had arrived safely at the boundary of Brittany; I cared little for\r\nthe issue of the impending battle. I had met two Bretons by accident\r\nnear Nantes. The two Armoricans were bound for Vannes. From that city to\r\nthe sacred stones of Karnak I knew the distance was short. We three\r\ndeparted before sunrise on the morning of the battle that Clotaire was\r\nto deliver against his son. In order to shorten our route and also to\r\navoid finding ourselves entangled in the pending melee, we walked to the\r\nseashore intending to proceed to the bay of Morbihan.\r\n\r\n\"We had walked a good portion of the day, and were skirting the shore in\r\nthe neighborhood of the port of Croisik when we noticed a fisherman's\r\nhut raised against a projecting rock. We turned towards it, intending to\r\nrest a few hours, when, to my great astonishment I saw near the hut\r\nseveral traveling mules and richly caparisoned horses in charge of some\r\nslaves. Three of the animals, one of which was a palfrey, bore women's\r\nsaddles.\"\r\n\r\n\"A strange spectacle in that solitary place. And to whom did the mounts\r\nbelong?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Chram. His wife and two daughters were in the hut. A boat was moored\r\nat the shore, and at a distance of about three bows' shots, a light\r\nvessel rode at anchor, ready to set sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mentioned before the means of escape that Clotaire's son had\r\nprepared in case his troops were beaten--the vessel, I presume, waited\r\nfor him and his family?\"\r\n\r\n\"My two companions, as well as myself, hesitated whether or not to enter\r\nthe hut, when its door opened and a richly dressed young woman stepped\r\nto the threshold; two little girls were with her. One of them, a child\r\nof about five or six years of age, clung to the folds of her mother's\r\nrobe, while the latter held another girl of about twelve by the hand.\r\nThe young woman looked depressed; her eyes were in tears; behind her I\r\nsaw a warrior, whom I readily recognized as one of the three favorites\r\nof Chram, Imnachair, the identical warrior who witnessed the torture to\r\nwhich I was subjected at the burg of Neroweg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were that woman and children Chram's family? It has always seemed\r\nstrange to me that such monsters should at all have families.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those were my very thoughts, Kervan, when the young woman, noticing our\r\ntraveling bags on our shoulders, asked us with marked anxiety whether we\r\ncame from Nantes, and whether we had any news of a battle that must have\r\nbeen fought there.\"\r\n\r\n\"'We can give you no information upon that, madam,' we answered her, 'we\r\ndid not even know that there were any armies drawn up for battle.'\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly one of the slaves who must have been stationed on the lookout\r\nover the crest of the rock, ran towards the hut crying: 'Horsemen! We\r\nsee far away, in a cloud of dust, a number of horsemen riding at full\r\ngallop in this direction!'\r\n\r\n\"'Death and fury!' cried Imnachair stamping the ground and growing pale.\r\n'It is Chram--the battle is lost!'\r\n\r\n\"At these words the poor young woman fell down upon her knees, clasped\r\nher two daughters to her heart, and I could hear but the moans and sobs\r\nof the mother and her children.\r\n\r\n\"'Quick! Quick! To the boat!' shouted Imnachair. 'Slaves, unload the\r\nmules; take to the boat the cases that they carry; and you, madam, hold\r\nyourself ready to embark!\"\r\n\r\n\"The precipitate tramp of galloping horses was heard approaching, also\r\nthe clank of armors, and even voices, that, although confused, sounded\r\nfurious.\r\n\r\n\"'It is my husband!' cried Chram's wife, growing deadly pale. 'But his\r\nfather is pursuing him! Do you not hear those cries of death?'\r\n\r\n\"Imnachair listened. 'Yes,' said he; 'it is the voice of King Clotaire!\r\nFlee, madam; flee, you and your children! Let us run to the boat--we\r\nshall soon row ourselves out of danger. It will soon be too late!'\r\n\r\n\"'Flee without my husband--never!' answered the young woman convulsively\r\npressing her two children to her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Cries of 'Kill him!' 'Kill him!' 'Death!' 'Death!' grew more distinct\r\nevery instant. Those who uttered them were now no more than three\r\nhundred paces from the hut. King Clotaire headed the pursuers.\r\n\r\n\"'Come, madam!' shrieked Imnachair seizing the young woman by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"'No!' she answered resolutely.\r\n\r\n\"'If you are determined to wait for Clotaire, I must leave you!' cried\r\nImnachair. 'Adieu, madam!' saying which he ran to the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Neither I nor my two companions being anxious to meet Clotaire and his\r\nbodyguard, we rushed towards the granite boulders that strewed the beach\r\nand hid ourselves completely from view among them. Both the hut and the\r\nsea were in sight from the place of my concealment. A minute later I saw\r\nthe boat, now loaded with the cases that were taken from the\r\npack-saddles of the mules, and which undoubtedly contained the treasury\r\nof Chram, row swiftly towards the vessel, the sails of which were at the\r\nsame time being loosened to the wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the woman--the two children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Imnachair left them all behind. He sat in the stern of the boat with\r\nthe tiller in his hand; the slaves rowed and accompanied the King's\r\nfavorite in his flight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The heavens would be unjust if such men as Chram could find devoted\r\nfriends. This wretch of a favorite no doubt gave Chram over to a\r\ndeserved death; but that wife--those innocent children--\"\r\n\r\n\"As I was saying, Kervan, from my place of concealment I had the sea,\r\nthe hut and its surroundings in plain view. Despite the distance that\r\nseparated me from the horrible scene that I am about to describe to you,\r\nI could distinctly hear the voices of the Franks, who were drawing\r\nnearer and nearer. Almost at the same instant that Imnachair pushed off\r\nfrom the beach, I saw Chram's wife take a few steps, dragging her\r\nchildren after her. Her strength failed her; she again dropped down upon\r\nher knees; I saw her and her two little daughters raise their arms\r\nimploringly, with terror-stricken countenances. An instant later,\r\nbare-headed, livid, with his armor in disorder, Chram appeared in sight\r\nnear the hut; he leaped off his horse, and was moving backwards, sword\r\nin hand, parrying the blows aimed at him by three warriors. Suddenly the\r\nthundering voice of King Clotaire was heard, and these words reached my\r\nears:\r\n\r\n\"'Lord, look down upon me from Your throne in heaven, and judge my case,\r\nbecause I have been most unworthily wronged by my son! Look down upon\r\nus, Oh, Lord, and judge us equitably, and let Your judgment be that\r\nwhich You pronounced between David and Absalom!'\r\n\r\n\"Clotaire finished this invocation as he came within my view near the\r\ndoor of the hut, and he then addressed the three members of his\r\nbodyguard who were still closely pressing Chram:\r\n\r\n\"'Stop your attack! I want to see the traitor alive!'\r\n\r\n\"The warriors lowered their swords. Chram, whose face was bathed in\r\nblood, staggered a few steps forward and fell into the arms of his wife,\r\nwho had rushed towards him, and now held him in a close and consoling\r\nembrace. Her two little daughters remained on their knees with their\r\narms outstretched towards Clotaire, who descended from his foam-flecked\r\nhorse. In his hand he held his long sword. His warriors made a circle\r\naround Chram and his family. Clotaire then sheathed his sword, folded\r\nhis arms over his breast, and for an instant contemplated his son in\r\nsilence. Chram fell on his knees; with clasped hands he implored his\r\nfather's pardon, and then bowed down his head to the ground; his wife\r\nand two daughters sobbed aloud. Clotaire looked upon the group long in\r\nsilence. Finally he issued his orders to one of the men in his suite.\r\nChram, his wife and his two daughters were bound fast despite their\r\nfrantic cries for mercy and desperate resistance. All the four were then\r\ndragged into the hut. Their piercing cries reached my place of\r\nconcealment, distant though it was. A few minutes later Clotaire's\r\nwarriors came out of the hut and closed the door.\r\n\r\n\"'We bound them all firmly upon the bench, as you ordered, seigneur\r\nKing,' one of them reported.\r\n\r\n\"At the same moment I saw another warrior draw near the hut with a\r\nburning brand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what was the death that Clotaire reserved for his son and his son's\r\nfamily?\"\r\n\r\n\"The hut was constructed of wood and thatched with reeds. The three\r\nwarriors of the King heaped around it bunches of dry seaweed and dead\r\ntree branches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can guess what is to come. Oh, Ronan--that is horrible. The\r\nfather is going to burn his son, granddaughters and his son's wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"When a sufficient mass of these combustible materials was heaped up all\r\naround the hut, Clotaire made a sign. The warrior who held the burning\r\nbrand blew upon it, and soon as it was in flame held it to the heap of\r\ndry wood and weed. In an instant the hut disappeared behind a roaring\r\nsheet of fire. The cries of the unfortunate beings who were about to\r\nperish in the flames became heartrending. I turned my head away in\r\ninvoluntary horror, and, as my eyes fell upon the high sea, I saw the\r\nlight vessel speeding away under full sail and vanishing in the distant\r\nhorizon--it carried away Imnachair, together with the treasury of Chram.\r\n\r\n\"Clotaire has four sons left to him--Charibert, Gontran, Sigebert and\r\nChilperik. It is said that the last of these seems to have inherited the\r\nferocity of his father Clotaire and his grandfather Clovis!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the day when Ronan, my brother Karadeucq's son gave\r\nus this account, he left us. These were his last words:\r\n\r\n\"Kervan, I leave this house happy at having fulfilled the last wishes of\r\nmy father and the orders of Joel.\"\r\n\r\nRonan the Vagre left, accordingly, early in the morning to return to his\r\nbeloved Valley of Charolles. My nephew promised that, in the event of\r\nany matters of importance, he would inform us if he finds a traveler\r\nbound for Brittany. He would address any further narrative either to\r\nmyself or my son Yvon, should I have left this world.\r\n\r\nMay Ronan, my brother's son, arrive safely in the Valley of Charolles\r\nand find his family happy and peaceful.\r\n\r\nIf before my death I should have nothing to add to these chronicles, I\r\nbequeath them, together with our family relics, to my son Yvon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI, Yvon, son of Kervan and grandson of Jocelyn, enter at this place the\r\ndate of my father's death in the month of June of the year 561.\r\n\r\nFrom travelers we have learned that King Clotaire died this year at\r\nCompiegne in the fifty-first year of his reign, and was interred in the\r\nbasilica of St. Medard at Soissons with the blessings of the bishops.\r\n\r\nI have received no tidings from Ronan. May he still be alive and happy\r\nand free in the Valley of Charolles, as we are here in Brittany, which\r\nstill remains free from the Frankish yoke. May it please Hesus never to\r\nallow our beloved province to experience such a calamity.",
