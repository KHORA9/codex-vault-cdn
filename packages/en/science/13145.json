The engine is observed to slacken, and\r\na little elderly man with a lantern, looking in the twilight like an\r\nArabian Night's phantom with one red eye in the middle of its body,\r\nplaces himself just in advance of the locomotive. He trots nimbly\r\nalong, defending himself from incessant death by the sureness of his\r\nlegs, and after a long race guides up to the station the clattering\r\ntrain, which is all the time threatening to catch him by the heel.\r\n\"Wilmington!\" shouts the brakesman. Every train into Wilmington is\r\nthus attended, as the palfrey of an Eastern pasha by the running\r\nfootman. The man's life is passed in a perpetual race with\r\ndestruction, and having beaten innumerable locomotives, he still\r\nsurvives, contentedly wagging his crimson eye, and hardly conscious\r\nthat his existence is a perpetual escape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILMINGTON DÉPÔT OF THE PHILADELPHIA, WILMINGTON AND\r\nBALTIMORE RAILROAD.]\r\n\r\nSomething quaint, peremptory, old-world and feudal strikes the\r\ntraveler as adhering in this custom, by which Wilmington constantly\r\npays for the general safety of her promenaders with the offering of\r\na citizen's life and limbs. This impression is right. The city is\r\nthe best-defined spot on the American map where the South begins and\r\nthe North ends. Wilmington is, for its own part, a perfect crystal\r\nof Yankee grit, run out and fixed in a country which in the highest\r\ndegree represents the soft, contented, lazy, incoherent Bourbon\r\ntemper. We select it for our subject because it is so complete a\r\nterminal image. There is no other instance in the country of such\r\nsharp, close contrast. A man might step out to the city limit, and\r\nstand with one leg in full Yankeeland, thrilling with enterprise and\r\nemulation, and the other planted, as it were, in the \"Patriarchal\r\nTimes.\" Elsewhere along the effaced line of Mason and Dixon the\r\nsections die away into each other: here they stand face to face, and\r\nstare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRANDYWINE, AND LEA'S MILLS.]\r\n\r\nWilmington's legend belongs to the general story of the settlements\r\nalong the Delaware. The discoveries of its site overlapped each other,\r\nthe Quakers discovering the Swedes, who had discovered the Dutch, who\r\nhad discovered the Indians. It was first called Willing's Town, from\r\na settler, and then Wilmington, from the earl of that name in England,\r\nto whom Thomson dedicated his poem of _Winter_. But the spirit of\r\nenterprise--the spirit whose results we are now to chronicle--came in\r\nonly with William Shipley, for whose story we must refer the reader,\r\nstrange as it may seem, to the latest novel of the first living master\r\nof English fiction.\r\n\r\nThis introduces to our notice the most singular literary partnership\r\nthat ever was or ever will be. Dumas used to be helped out in his\r\nsplendid fictions by Maquet, but Dumas and Maquet were Frenchmen, and\r\nhad plenty of sympathies in common. Charles Reade, however, in his\r\nromance of _The Wandering Heir_, written to minister to the Tichborne\r\nexcitement, takes for his helper the most unlikely colleague in\r\nnature--a grave, tranquil, intensely respectable Friend, a writer of\r\ncolonial histories in a far pastoral retreat by the Delaware. Such\r\nworkmen were never matched before; yet the words of Benjamin Ferris,\r\nthe Wilmington antiquarian, form a part, and a telling part, of\r\nthe exciting romance signed by Charles Reade. The words of Ferris,\r\nunexpectedly earning renown in a work of imagination, trace the true\r\ntale of the Quaker prophetess, Elizabeth Shipley, who brought her\r\npractical husband to Wilmington through the influence of a brilliant\r\ndream. The words of Ferris, adopted and sold to the publishers by\r\nReade, describe the terrestrial Paradise now known as Wilmington in\r\njust those glowing and golden terms we should have needed for the\r\nprologue to this article if we had not been so anticipated. Reade,\r\nso long as he keeps up his partnership with Ferris, is safe, sane\r\nand true. It would have been well if he had kept it up a little\r\nlonger, for the moment he lets go Ferris's coat-cuff he falls into\r\nmistakes--calling the Delaware hereabouts a \"bay,\" and speaking of a\r\nprickly-pear hedge on a farm only sixty miles from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IRON SHIP-BUILDING AND MACHINE-WORKS--P. 378.]\r\n\r\nThe Reade Ferris legend, precluding any necessity of a story from us,\r\nbrings good Elizabeth Shipley into Wilmington, which was then a garden\r\nand is now a mart, from her former home at Ridley, which was then\r\na forest-clearing and is now a garden, being in truth the site of\r\nRidley Park, the landscape-city which was described in this Magazine\r\nlast September. The legend gives all proper emphasis to the location,\r\nendowing it with beauty enough to tempt a celestial guide from heaven\r\nfor the meek Quakeress's benefit, and with practical advantages enough\r\nto tempt the worldly-minded husband. To get a high idea of the natural\r\nattractions of Wilmington, therefore, read _The Wandering Heir_, thus\r\nadvertised gratuitously. Wilmington lies, says the author of _Peg\r\nWoffington_, \"between the finger and thumb of two rivers,\" and also\r\nupon the broad palm of the Delaware. The two minor streams which\r\nembrace it are entirely different in character: one is a picturesque\r\ntorrent, named by the Dutch Brand-wijn (Brandywine), from the\r\ncircumstance of a ship loaded with brandy having foundered at its\r\nmouth; the other, serene and navigable, is the Christine, named by the\r\nSwedes from Christina, their favorite princess. Hereabouts George Fox,\r\nthe first Quaker, built a fire in 1672 to dry his immortal leather\r\nbreeches. \"We came to Christian River,\" he says, \"where we swam over\r\nour horses.\" The stream in that day, before the destruction of inland\r\nforests, had about six times its present volume, but it is still good\r\nfor vessels of considerable burden. The thriving settlers made it\r\ncarry down the harvests of the interior, and then made the Brandywine\r\ngrind them. The focus of the rivers became a rich milling centre, and\r\nwas also a post for whaling-ships. The Otaheitan prince stepped from\r\nthe deck of the whaler to court with gifts of shells the demure Quaker\r\nmaidens of Wilmington, and Kanaka sailors were almost as familiar on\r\nits wharves as Indian chiefs. About the time of the Revolution the\r\ntown became a well-known station for the export of quercitron bark,\r\nand all the while the clacking mills were busy along the uneasy rapids\r\nof the Brandywine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTINE CREEK WITH THE DIAMOND STATE WORKS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE-IRON ROLLING-MILLS--P. 379.]\r\n\r\nShall we take a glance at a historic mill? The best location for\r\nsuch a structure where water-power just met tide-water, and shallops\r\ndrawing eight feet could load up at the shore, was selected in 1762\r\nfor mill-buildings which still stand, and which were for many years\r\nthe most famous in the country, regulating the price of grain for\r\nthe United States. The business soon overflowed, and necessitated the\r\nbuilding, in 1770, of the structures represented in the engraving on\r\npage 371, the whole group, on the two sides of the stream, being under\r\none ownership, and known as \"Lea's Brandywine Mills.\" Hither would\r\ncome the long lines of Conestoga wagons, from distant counties, such\r\nas Dauphin and Berks, with fat horses, and wagoners persuading them\r\nby means of biblical oaths jabbered in Pennsylvania Dutch. From these\r\nmills Washington removed the runners (or upper stones), lest they\r\nshould be seized and used by the British, hauling them up into Chester\r\ncounty. When independence was secured the State of Delaware hastened\r\nto pass laws putting foreign trade on a more liberal footing than\r\nthe neighbor commonwealths, thus securing for her mills the enviable\r\ncommerce with the West Indies. Much shipping was thus attracted to\r\nWilmington, and the trade with Cuba in corn-meal was particularly\r\nlarge. It was found, however, that the flour of maize invariably\r\nrotted in a tropical voyage, and thereupon the commodity known as\r\nkiln-dried corn was invented at the Brandywine Mills: two hundred\r\nbushels would be dried per day on brick floors, and be thought a large\r\namount, though the \"pan-kiln\" now in use dries two thousand in the\r\nsame time. The dried meal was delivered at Havana perfectly fresh, and\r\npay received, in those good old days of barter, in Jamaica rum, sugar\r\nand coffees. In the old times flour was heaped in the barrels and\r\npatted down with wooden shovels: then, when full, a cloth was laid\r\nover the top, and the fattest journeyman on the premises clambered up\r\nto a seat on the heap, to \"cheese it down\" and imprint his callipyge\r\nupon it. Flour thus made and branded was always safe to bring a high\r\nprice, but never so high as in the short epoch of the Continental\r\ncurrency, when the old entries of the Brandywine Mill books show\r\n(1780) wheat bought at twenty-four pounds a bushel, a pair of the\r\nmiller's leather small-clothes at eighty pounds, and some three or\r\nfour hundred barrels of his flour charged at a gross sum of twenty-one\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThe fine old mills are still in lively operation, manufacturing into\r\nmeal about a million bushels of wheat and Indian corn every year. The\r\nprincipal proprietor receives us in his domain, the living image of\r\neasy, old-fashioned prosperity, and narrates the long history of the\r\nstructures, showing his little museum of curiosities--now a whale's\r\njaw bequeathed from the old fishing days, now a Revolutionary\r\ncannon-ball--and helps us to realize the ancient times by means of the\r\nmusic of the mill, which is loquacious now as it was under George III.\r\n\r\nSuch is a specimen of one of the stout old industries of a hundred\r\nyears ago, still surviving and hale as ever, though out of its former\r\nproportion amongst the immense enterprises of modern days. This\r\narticle, however, must pass out of the atmosphere of ancient tradition\r\nas quickly as possible, being intended to show the handsome city of\r\nWilmington with its sleeves rolled up as it were, and in the thick of\r\nthe hardest work belonging to the nineteenth century. When steam was\r\nintroduced to revolutionize labor, and railroads came to supplement\r\nwater-transport, they found the manufacturers of this prosperous town\r\nready to avail themselves of every improvement, and pass at once from\r\nthe chrysalis state into the soaring development of modern enterprise.\r\n\r\nThat is a feature the citizens point out with a good deal of honest\r\npride--the prosperity of the old families, enabling them at once to\r\ninvest in the most enormous of modern mechanical applications. The\r\nwealthy companies now found here did not go to work by calling for\r\ncapital from the large cities: they went to the old stocking, and\r\nfound it there. The manufacturers show you, reared in a back office or\r\nsticking on a wall, the ancient family sign, which Washington and La\r\nFayette regarded at the time of their disasters along the Brandywine.\r\nIt is one continuity of thrift.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, some of these Lairds of America, who build ships\r\nalong the Delaware as their prototypes upon the Clyde. The Harlan\r\n& Hollingsworth Company claims to be the oldest iron shipbuilding\r\nestablishment in America. The money in this concern was local. The\r\npartners were old neighbors, relatives or friends. They worked along\r\nas a firm until 1868, when the huge proportions of their business\r\ninduced them to incorporate themselves as a company, still\r\ndistinguished by the good old proper names. We stroll into their\r\ndomain by the river-side, and if we previously cherished any notion\r\nthat shipbuilding was a decayed institution in America, the lively\r\ntumult here will effectually drive the insulting thought out of our\r\nheads. Among a shoal of leviathans stretched out beside the waters\r\nthere is the iron steamer Acapulco, waiting for her compound engines\r\nfrom John Elder & Co. of Glasgow: she is three hundred feet long (and\r\nthat is a dimension that looks almost immeasurable when dry on land),\r\nforty feet beam and twenty-five hundred tons burden. Another, of\r\nsimilar dimensions, is building beside her, and they are both intended\r\nfor the Pacific Mail Company's line, and will ply between California\r\nand China. The various operations going on upon the ground--the laying\r\nof an iron keel three hundred feet long, the modeling into true and\r\nfine curves the enormous plates for a ship's side, the joining of\r\nthese so neatly that the rivets are not visible, and the bending of\r\nstout iron timbers on vast iron floors--are interesting even as a\r\nmere spectacle; and the trains of men who go about to minister to the\r\nvarious great machines seem like races of beings suddenly diminished\r\nin the scale of magnitude, and to be so many wise Lilliputians\r\nattending around the bodies of creatures of Brobdingnag. It is true\r\nthat neat mechanical contrivances save their muscle wherever it is\r\npossible. A great plate of iron or a bundle of deck flooring is picked\r\nup, by a hand which swings down from aloft, like a visiting-card by\r\na lady: a single man turning a windlass, it sails into the air, gets\r\nup as high as it chooses to, and drops delicately just where it is\r\nwanted along the length of the structure. Out on the wharf a double\r\n\"hoister,\" working by steam, and able to pick up and swing a hundred\r\ntons, is used in handling the materials of the works. The dry-docks\r\nare, in winter, a singular spectacle. They are a vast hospital\r\nof interesting invalids, the patients being steamers, barges and\r\ncanal-boats. For instance, the old Edwin Forrest, which has paddled up\r\nthe Delaware with excursionists since a time whereof the mind of man\r\nrunneth not to the contrary, comes up into the dry-dock complaining of\r\nits bunions. The dry-dock accommodates a ship as long as three hundred\r\nand forty feet, and is one hundred feet across. The gouty steamer\r\npotters comfortably in, and lays up its tired keel, while the dock is\r\nbeing discharged, as serenely as a patient who lays his foot on the\r\nknee of a corn-doctor: in due time, relieved and sound, the invalid\r\nis ready to take the stage of life again. Another boat comes in to\r\nbe lengthened: it has growing-pains, and wants assistance. The stern\r\nis sliced off, the keel is spliced, and the adolescent leaves the\r\ndocks longer by twenty feet. On the steamers that are being finished\r\nwe notice the extreme beauty of the upholstery and of the engraved,\r\ninlaid and polished woodwork: it is all done on the spot, and before\r\nwe leave Wilmington we shall have many occasions to admire the luxury\r\nwith which the higher kinds of joinery are prepared for the various\r\nstructures made there. On our way to the car-works--for this versatile\r\ncorporation is a great manufacturer of railway-carriages too--we\r\nnotice the throngs of workers scattered like ants over every part of\r\nthe huge area, and it occurs to us to ask if there are any strikes.\r\nOur conductor is Mr. J. Taylor Gause, a big, hearty, shrewd man, who\r\nknows every bolt and rivet on the whole premises as Bunyan knew the\r\nwords of his Bible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOROCCO-MAKING FACTORY.--P. 381.]\r\n\r\n\"We never have any trouble,\" replies Mr. Gause; \"and it is owing to a\r\nway we have of nipping sea-lawyers in the bud.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what, may we ask, are sea-lawyers?\r\n\r\n\"Sea-lawyer is a workman's term. The sea-lawyer is the calculating,\r\ndissatisfied, eloquent man. He is the Henri Rochefort of their\r\nassemblies. A supposed grievance arises, the men have a meeting, and\r\nthe sea-lawyer begins to stir them up, big in his opportunity. We\r\nfind who he is, pay him on the instant, and send him away. The men\r\nrun about for a while with their complaints in their heads, but with\r\nnobody to utter them by. It ends by their coming to us in a body\r\nto receive back the mischief-maker, by this time repentant. This we\r\ngenerally do, getting a friend converted from an enemy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COACH-BUILDING ESTABLISHMENT.--P. 381]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the workmen of this city do not strike. The principal remedy\r\nfor the disease is a simple one. They are householders, being aided to\r\nown their own houses. They are therefore committed to the interests of\r\nthe place, and do not deal in revolutions which would make wandering\r\nIshmaelites of them.\r\n\r\nThe Harlan & Hollingsworth Company makes great numbers of\r\nrailway-cars, from the ordinary kind to the most luxurious\r\nsaloon-cars, and the examination of the shops is entertaining\r\nenough. Pullman, in fact, is said to have had more of his luxurious\r\nparlor-cars built in Wilmington than in any other city. As we are\r\ngoing, however, to see these carriages constructed where their\r\nmanufacture is a specialty, we will not linger here, where they occupy\r\nbut a part of an enormous establishment.\r\n\r\nWe will visit some more of the American Lairds. Pusey, Jones & Co.\r\nshow you the vast extent of their premises, occupying ten acres\r\nand extending along the water in a thousand feet of wharfage. Their\r\niron ships--one of which the artist has caught just after its\r\ncompletion--and other boats are moving to-day on nearly every river\r\nemptying into our Atlantic coast or the Gulf of Mexico. Steamboats of\r\ntheir build are now troubling the more distant waters of the Atrato,\r\nMagdalena, Orinoco, Amazon, Purus, Madeira, Tocantins, Ucayali, La\r\nPlata, Parana and Guayaquil Rivers of South America. They have other\r\nbranches of manufacture, uniting the industries of the land to the\r\ntoil of the sea. They turn out great quantities of machinery and many\r\nengines for paper-mills and iron-rolling mills, either of which they\r\nsupply in every detail. This is an old and experienced firm, fully\r\nsettled in character, credit and reputation.\r\n\r\nAnother great industrial combination is the Diamond State Works,\r\nestablished in 1853, occupying a whole block, and enjoying a frontage\r\nof three hundred and fifty feet on the Christine. Here are made the\r\nvast variety of things into which iron can be rolled or pinched.\r\nThe eye is puzzled and pleased at the groups of intelligent machines\r\nstanding up in their places and moulding with their steel fingers the\r\nrivets and the bolts; the railroad spikes, washers and fish-joints;\r\nthe nuts, whether hot-pressed or cold-pressed; the lag-screws and\r\nthe bolt-ends. Bars of all sizes and for an endless number of\r\nuses are pressed out like dough, and stored for sale in enormous\r\nwarehouses. Mr. Mendinhall and Mr. Clement B. Smyth, the president\r\nand vice-president of this company, are of long experience in the\r\nmanagement of their business; and the business of the company\r\nincreases from year to year, demanding all the room in its commodious\r\nlocation, and necessitating an office in New York, where, at No.\r\n71 Broadway, the large disbursing interests of the works are partly\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\nSuch are the bare commercial facts. But stand in one of these noisy\r\nworking-grounds of a manufacturing place like Wilmington, or ride up\r\nto the top of one of their buildings on the steam-elevators which some\r\nof them employ. Think how these men of iron are changing the surface\r\nof the earth, spiking rails to the prairie in distant territories,\r\nor sending into Polynesian archipelagoes the rivet on whose integrity\r\ndepends the safety of the iron ship. How needful to human progress\r\nis the conscientious perfection of their work! What tact they must\r\nemploy in dealing with phalanxes of laborers of different nations\r\nand imperfect intelligence! What a stimulus to genius they are,\r\nwith their readiness to catch at any labor-saving machine! See that\r\nastute-looking dwarf of an apparatus, biting off red-hot ends of\r\nrods, closing its jaws together upon them in such a way as to form\r\na four-square mould, then smartly hitting one end so as to make a\r\nprojecting head: a railroad spike is turned off in a moment. See this\r\nother making \"nuts\" as smartly as a baker makes ginger-nuts: some are\r\nraw and some are cooked--that is, some are punched hot and some cold,\r\nsufficing for different purposes: the cold are the softer, and the\r\neasier to \"tap\" or perforate with the screw--thread. Other machines\r\nare scissors trimming plates of iron like cardboard; others, in a\r\ncareless kind of way, spend all their time in nipping off whatever\r\nbolts and bars are presented to them; and others make pretty rows of\r\nrivet-holes all along the edges of huge iron plates. These animated\r\ncreatures of the mill, performing their tasks like child's play,\r\nare efforts of intellectual genius as truly as are the dramas of\r\nShakespeare. And busy talents are growing up in our manufacturing\r\ncentres as in hotbeds, each one trying to carry the domain of\r\nmechanical substitution a little farther, and so escape the necessity,\r\nso costly in America, of paying for man-power. In several ways a grand\r\nmanufactory is a college, stimulating the human minds engaged there\r\nin the highest degree, setting a premium on intellect and culture, and\r\nreminding us that whoever caused some idea to take shape that never\r\nhad an existence before, was called by the ancients a \"_poeta_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEAM MANUFACTORY OF SUPERPHOSPHATES.]\r\n\r\nWe will explore another of these great working-places--this time,\r\na group of mills as large as a modest village, yet devoted to one\r\nspecial product. In 1864, Mr. Henry B. Seidel purchased a rolling-mill\r\nwhich had already been in operation with varied success for eighty\r\nyears, and established the manufacture of large plates for iron\r\nships and boilers. In a few years, associating with himself his\r\nsuperintendent, Mr. Hastings, he greatly enlarged his operations, and\r\nthe firm found their edifice too small. An ample new one, one hundred\r\nand twenty-five feet long, was put up in 1870, upon the Church street\r\nside of their property, and with the introduction of all the new\r\nmachines became capable of the quickest and completest operations.\r\nSeidel & Hastings now run both mills, and turn out, when working night\r\nand day, at the rate of between five and six thousand tons of plate\r\niron per annum. They prepare their own \"blooms\" of charcoal iron at a\r\ngreat forge erected on their premises: this forge has five fires, and\r\nis provided with the engines and blowing-cylinders for the manufacture\r\nof boiler iron, and the monster steam-hammers necessary in its\r\npreparation. Nature's products are here taught manners with a witness:\r\nwhatever shape they enter in, they leave in the form of pie-crust. The\r\ntough old genius of iron, which has been trying since the creation to\r\nbuild itself into mountains or dissipate itself in bogs, is taught by\r\nthe powerful persuasions of these gentlemen to pack and toughen itself\r\ninto cards, and is only recognized by the foreman when he takes count\r\nof stock as \"plate inch and a half\" or \"plate one-eighth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAUKLAND, THE SITE OF OLIVER EVANS'S MILL.]\r\n\r\nBut the reader has had enough of iron. We will relieve him--though\r\nwe cannot promise not to revert to the metals--with a glimpse of some\r\ndifferent kinds of employment. Nothing, now, can be softer than kid,\r\nnothing more scholarly than a morocco book-binding, nothing is more\r\nbrilliant in the autumn woods than sumach, nothing is more graceful\r\nthan the pet goat of Esmeralda. We will pay a visit to one of the\r\nmorocco-factories, premising that our independent little city of\r\nWilmington has a wide reputation in the trade for her excellence in\r\nthis special article, and that her product in morocco is actually\r\nthe largest single item of her trade, the production last year having\r\nexceeded two million dollars' worth. We will enter a specimen factory,\r\nwhere the tame African goats playing about the yard, by putting their\r\nskins into contact with the powdered sumach lying up stairs in the\r\nbags, are to yield us specimens of about the best American morocco\r\nknown to commerce. The superiority of the Wilmington product is\r\nattributed by buyers to something in the quality of the Brandywine\r\nwater, but probably the high condition and tone of the workmen has\r\nmore to do with it. In Wilmington, where a workman finds that a given\r\nrate of wages represents better living and more happiness than in any\r\nlarge city, the labor obtainable for the pay is naturally of a higher\r\ncharacter; and this, in a business where everything depends upon hand\r\nmanipulation, is a controlling influence. The factory we select is\r\nthat of Pusey, Scott & Co., at Madison and Third streets, five stories\r\nhigh and a hundred and sixty feet deep. Over this scented labyrinth we\r\ngo, up stairs and down; now among the slippery vats, where the hides\r\nare deprived of their hair; now into a bright room, where half a dozen\r\npretty sewing-machine girls are stitching the wet, slimy skins into\r\nbags; now into gloomy cellars, where these bags are filled with\r\nsumach-dust and water. The scene in these dark apartments, where many\r\nof the workmen are negroes, is especially high-flavored and like a\r\nchapter in _Vathek_. Writers usually talk of \"life in the iron-mills\"\r\nas conducing to the development of herculean strength. But\r\niron-workers are apt to be dry and wiry, their flesh half sweated off\r\nand their complexions unnaturally pale. For true muscular development,\r\nrather Flemish and beefy in quality, we would instance the workmen\r\nin this department of a morocco-factory. The skins when filled with\r\nwater are very heavy, and the jolly fellows who play at aquatic games\r\nwith them, now ducking into the tanks, now holding a bag under the\r\nhopper whence the sumach descends, and anon stirring, manipulating\r\nand inspecting the mass of floating pillows, are true heroes out of\r\nRubens' pictures. The scenes up stairs again, where young Swedes\r\nand Irish boys dress the dry skins, painting them over with black,\r\nand polishing and graining them by rubbing them with stones (a\r\nback-breaking operation, apparently, in the attitude of laundresses\r\nbent over an eternal washboard), are all highly entertaining. In\r\nthe store-rooms we see the handsome sheets of morocco, including the\r\nkangaroo skins from Australia, perforated here and there with the\r\nhunter's shot, and distinguishable by the enormous flap which has,\r\nin the creature's life, encased the tail. Among them all the little\r\norphaned kid skins, clothed in mourning colors and so soft and small,\r\nlook very innocent and interesting. The distinguishing claim of\r\nWilmington is that of having been the pioneer to introduce machinery\r\ninto this as into other kinds of business. Several kinds of\r\nlabor-saving apparatus are explained to us, and the foresight in\r\nbuilding the apartments so that the skins travel from stage to stage\r\nwith the least possible lifting is pointed out. These economies are\r\nsaid to be unmatched in the world. In this manufacture the relations\r\nof employers with employed, and amongst each other, would appear\r\nto be particularly happy. The morocco-makers of Wilmington seem to\r\nbelieve that worth makes the man, that readiness to do a favor to\r\nfellow-manufacturers is what shows the true \"grain,\" and that \"the\r\nrest is naught but leather and prunello.\" In dealing with their men,\r\nMessrs. Pusey, Scott & Co. have kept up the best relations, and have\r\nsolved the difficult, the crucial problem in these latitudes, of\r\ninducing whites and negroes to labor side by side at the same task\r\nin harmony. We believe that this one fact alone, if we were able to\r\ndevelop it eloquently, would be found to stamp the character of the\r\nprincipals with the best traits of benevolence, tact and sense. Mr.\r\nWarner, our guide through the premises, concludes the exhibition\r\nby showing us a curious set of great books in the counting house,\r\nwhere the foreman of each department records his answer daily to a\r\nlist of printed questions, stating his figures, his ideas, reports,\r\nsuggestions and complaints. This diurnal inquisition, which\r\nmorally gives ventilation to the whole establishment, and relieves\r\ndifficulties at their start, seems to be another indication of an\r\nenviable relationship, keeping up an excellent, old-fashioned sympathy\r\nbetween employers and operatives.\r\n\r\nFrom morocco-dressing to carriages, which are curtained and cushioned\r\nwith morocco, is not a difficult step. La Bruyère, who wrote a whole\r\nbook without making any transitions, would have passed without effort\r\nfrom the establishment of Pusey, Scott & Co. to the coach-factory of\r\nMcLear & Kendall. It should be premised that coach-building is another\r\nof the very special successes of Wilmington. She produced last year\r\nan amount, in cash value, of carriages greater than her iron ships,\r\ngreater than her cotton fabrics, being one million four hundred\r\nthousand dollars. The engraving shows the outside magnitude of McLear\r\n& Kendall's factory, the largest in the city, but cannot show the\r\ncurious effect of the great show-room, filled with rockaways, buggies\r\nof all kinds, and park phaetons. The building, which was put up in\r\n1865, is on Ninth, King and French streets, and is two hundred and\r\neighteen feet in length. These makers produce annually fifteen hundred\r\nvehicles, which are shipped to all parts of the United States. An\r\nengine of forty horse-power assists the workmen, of whom a hundred and\r\nseventy-five are kept in employment, earning the high wages commanded\r\nby skilled labor, or, on an average throughout the factory, twenty\r\ndollars per week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANDYWINE SPRINGS, ON REDCLAY CREEK.]\r\n\r\nAfter the ponderous establishments near the mouth of the Christine,\r\nand the neater sorts of industries which can be carried on within the\r\ncity, we come to notice some of the mills and factories up stream.\r\nMany of these are of great antiquity.\r\n\r\nWalton, Whann & Co. boast that fully one-half the arrivals and\r\ndepartures of shipping at Wilmington are in connection with their\r\nbusiness. What is that business? Why, it is the revival of the\r\nfertility of the South, exhausted by the land-murdering agriculture\r\nof slavery. The demand from the cotton regions since the war has been\r\nenormous for the best artificial fertilizers, and the appreciation\r\nof the particular kind made by Walton, Whann & Co. is very marked.\r\nPlanters have learned the fact, which science and experience\r\ndemonstrate, that a reliable compost must be now used for the\r\nremunerative culture of cotton, as well as of their corn and other\r\nstaples; and their preference for the superphosphate prepared by this\r\nfirm over most other fertilizers is evinced by the fact that their\r\ndemand has for several years been largely in excess of the supply.\r\nWe need not wonder, then, at the formidable preparations made for\r\nthis mighty overdriven business. The cargoes discharging by means\r\nof steam-power into the barges proceed from mills covering several\r\nacres of ground, and worked by three engines, aggregating one\r\nhundred horse-power. Think of it! the strength of one hundred horses\r\novertasked day by day to provide this magic powder, through which\r\nthe tired _real_ horse is to drag the plough in so many thousands of\r\ndistant acres! The machinery for grinding the organic materials is of\r\nthe most approved excellence, and is tested by the turning out, with\r\nthe power stated, of full fifteen hundred tons of the phosphate per\r\nmonth. A visit to the store-house of this factory is a strange sight,\r\nreminding the tourist of the open-air cemetery of the Capuchins at\r\nRome. It is a realm of bones. Bones from the South American pampas,\r\nbones from the pork-packing houses of Cincinnati, bones from the\r\ngrazing plains of Texas, come here to mingle. The skeletons of half\r\na continent meet in these whirling mills for a prodigious Dance of\r\nDeath, being most emphatically denied what is the last wish of all\r\nsentient creatures--rest for their bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF MR. J.T. HEALD.]\r\n\r\nThis factory is on the Christine River, just outside the limit of\r\nthe city. On Redclay Creek--a tributary to the Christine, running\r\ninto it parallel with the Brandywine--a number of mills have seated\r\nthemselves, attracted by its swift torrent, amid scenery of steeps\r\nand rapids comparable to that on the Lehigh about Mauch Chunk. Of\r\nthese the most interesting traditions attach to the Faulkland Mills.\r\nTheir name may remind the reader of the first novel of the late Lord\r\nLytton--_Falkland_, written in 1828--but it was given to the spot long\r\nbefore in designation of a primitive settlement, Faulk's Land. The\r\nassociation with this site is that of Oliver Evans, the true inventor\r\nof the locomotive, who here worked and dreamed in a mill enriched with\r\nhis contrivances.\r\n\r\nEvans, like Fitch, is one of the world's lost renowns. Had the\r\nlegislators of his time possessed sagacity enough to endow his\r\ninventions, the advantages of steam-transport would have been\r\nanticipated by several years, and the glory would have radiated\r\nfrom the Delaware River instead of from the Hudson. His design for a\r\nlocomotive was sent to England in 1787, disputing priority with the\r\n\"steam-wagons\" of James Watt. He built steamboats at Philadelphia in\r\n1802 and 1803, and ran them successfully, antedating by five years\r\nthe Clermont of Robert Fulton--Fulton, whom people are beginning to\r\nregard, with Mr. Stone, author of the recent _History of New York_, as\r\nthe man who has received the greatest quantity of undeserved praise\r\nof all who ever lived. Oliver Evans, born in 1755 of a respectable\r\nfamily, was a miller at Faulkland, where his smaller inventions were\r\nfirst put in use. The plank just under the apex of the roof, which he\r\nused to retire to as his private study, was shown until 1867, when the\r\nold mill was burned. Up among the swallows, as he lay on the board--to\r\nwhich, as Beecher expresses it, he \"brought the softness\"--the\r\nchildren of his genius were conceived and delivered. The mill was\r\nfull of his labor-saving machines, which clattered to the babbling\r\nRedclay. One of his notions was the mill \"elevator\" (an improvement of\r\nsomething he had seen in Marshall's mill at Stanton), by which grain\r\nwas raised to the top of the building in buckets set along a revolving\r\nbelt which passed from the roof to the bottom, distributing the wheat\r\nwith spouts to the bolt. This was set up, by contributions among the\r\nmillers, at Shipley's great mill in Wilmington, and also introduced\r\ninto his own, where his other inventions of the \"conveyer\" and the\r\n\"hopper-boy\" attracted the stares of the rival millwrights. Poor\r\nOliver was known to the fat millers of this neighborhood as the\r\ninconvenient person who was always wanting the loan of a thousand\r\ndollars to carry out a new invention. The \"thinking men\" among them\r\nsagely argued that his improvements would benefit the consumer, by\r\nincreasing the supply of flour and making it cheap--a clear detriment\r\nto the interests of capital. Then Oliver plunged desperately into his\r\nidea of steam-motion, losing the faint vestiges of his repute for\r\nwit, and died poor and heartbroken in 1819, the hero of an unwritten\r\ntragedy. The happy hours of his life were the hours on the dusty plank\r\nin the mill-gable at Faulkland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DÉPÔT OF THE WILMINGTON AND WESTERN RAILROAD.]\r\n\r\nEvans's mill was bought in 1828 by Mr. Jonathan Fell, and turned\r\ninto the spice-grinding establishment which is still operated by his\r\ndescendants on the same ground. But Fell's business was much older\r\nthan that purchase, being a good representative of the ancestral\r\nindustries that exist in such numbers among Penn's settlers. Early in\r\nthis century the passengers in Front street in Philadelphia laughed\r\nat the juxtaposition of a sign just put up with an older one, the two\r\nreading thus: \"James _Scholl_--Jonathan _Fell_.\" He had purchased the\r\nspice-grinding business of an English immigrant on that site, and now\r\nthe same business is carried on at Faulkland, one hundred and seven\r\nyears from its commencement, in the thirteenth generation of Fell's\r\ndescendants, after a career of accumulated and undeviating success.\r\nMoving the factory to Faulkland, and retaining the Philadelphia\r\nsituation as a warehouse, the family have kept the old system\r\nunchanged, served by employés as steady as themselves, two of the\r\nlatter having died of old age after forty years in their service.\r\nThe present works of C.J. Fell & Brother, combining steam and\r\nturbine-wheel power, are represented as the most complete in America,\r\nand produce a great variety of condiments, which season the traveler's\r\nmeal in whatever State or Territory of the Union he may visit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTINE RIVER, WITH WILMINGTON AND WESTERN RAILROAD\r\nBRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nA chalybeate spring at Faulkland, formerly much resorted to, is now\r\nin railway communication with Wilmington, and will recover its ancient\r\nprestige. Under the ownership of Mr. Matthew Newkirk, the late railway\r\nmanager of Philadelphia, a large hotel at the Brandywine Springs\r\nwas filled with rich Southerners for many summers, but the house was\r\ndestroyed by fire, and the flow of visitors turned aside. One of the\r\nsmaller houses, with accommodation for two hundred guests, is the\r\npresent claimant for watering-place custom. Its situation, with the\r\nfine water-scenery, and a natural coliseum of wooded hills, is very\r\nattractive, and the restorative properties of the spring are proved\r\nand valuable.\r\n\r\nOne more interest attaches to Faulkland. Close by were the earthworks\r\nwhere Washington protected his army, expecting the British attack,\r\nbut, drawn from his intrenchments by a flank movement, was tempted on,\r\nto sustain disaster at Chadd's Ford on the Brandywine.\r\n\r\nWe have just mentioned the site as in railway communication with the\r\ncity of Wilmington. It is time to speak of the town in its relation to\r\nmeans of transport and as a railroad centre.\r\n\r\nThe location of the burgh, so near the ocean, on the beach of an\r\nimmense river, and in the clasp of two smaller but partly navigable\r\nstreams, kept it, in the old times, outside the latitude of railway\r\nimprovement. Its naval facilities were thought to be sufficient for\r\nwhat business it had. The Baltimore line from Philadelphia passed\r\nthrough it, and could move its freight either north or south. With\r\nthe development of its iron manufactures, however, the necessity of\r\nother connections became pressing, and in 1869 a road was opened to\r\nthe coal-regions at Reading, crossing the Pennsylvania Central at\r\nCoatesville. Another road leads to New Castle. And now a short road\r\nhas been opened to the westward, through a very rich region for\r\nway-freight; and with some notice of this, an artery for various\r\nmines and quarries, we finish our duty toward Wilmington as a railway\r\nnucleus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUTTING THROUGH CUBA HILL RIDGE.]\r\n\r\nThe Wilmington and Western Railroad has not yet got over the\r\nexcitement of being constructed. The creative spirit, it may be said,\r\nwas Mr. Joshua T. Heald, an enterprising Wilmingtonian, already a\r\ndirector of the Wilmington and Reading line. It was he who drummed up\r\nthe stock-subscriptions among his fellow townsmen. On July 8, 1871,\r\nhe struck the first pick into the line as president, and in October,\r\n1872, the road was opened for travel as far as Landenberg in\r\nPennsylvania. The Wilmington and Western Road crosses Christine River\r\nin the suburbs, then follows the valley of Redclay Creek, past all its\r\nmills and local improvements, sends visitors to Brandywine Springs,\r\nand passes the birthplace of the inventor Oliver Evans, while its\r\ncontemplated extension will pass it close to the birthplace of Robert\r\nFulton, in the Peachbottom slate region of Pennsylvania. No bad omen\r\nfor a steam-road, to have had its ground first broken at the cradle of\r\none steam inventor and to lead to the cradle of another!\r\n\r\nRegarding a map, to the west of Wilmington we see that there is a\r\ncontinuous tier of counties, from one extremity of Pennsylvania to\r\nthe other, which has no great railway running east and west. A few of\r\nthese counties are penetrated by feeders to the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nor by other lateral roads, but they are not opened by any general\r\ncomprehensive system; yet this section of Pennsylvania is one of\r\nthe richest in mineral wealth. It has limestone, slate, iron ore,\r\nbituminous coal and other deposits. From one extremity to the other it\r\nis a region well worth development, and sure to reward by a large and\r\nvaluable traffic the line of railway which will carry its products to\r\nthe tide-water markets for sale or transhipment. The road is still an\r\ninfant, but a good symptom is, that within six weeks of its opening\r\nthe gross earnings of the company had reached a sum more than equal\r\nto the weekly interest on its bonded debt. Its extension to Oxford and\r\nthe Susquehanna River is a matter for the immediate future.\r\n\r\nSo much for the facilities of moving Wilmington's many products by\r\nrailway. It would be too unjust, however, to pay court to these roads,\r\nwhich are matters of yesterday, and show no attention to the system of\r\nwater-transport for the sake of which her site was chosen two hundred\r\nyears since.\r\n\r\nLong years ago, Wilmington millers, wishing to ship flour to\r\nPhiladelphia, used to walk down to Market street wharf, and pulling a\r\nbellcord that hung outside a little brick office by the river, summon\r\nto his duty the easy-going and cheerful freight-clerk of the transport\r\nline. The old sign, with the name of \"Warner\" upon it, is still upon\r\nthe office, but the bell is gone, and the premises of Charles Warner\r\n& Co. have blossomed out into store-sheds and coal-sheds beyond\r\nall calculation. The guiding instinct of the firm was found to be\r\nconcentrated in the handsome head of Mr. E. Tatnall Warner, a son\r\nand now a partner; and it was he who sketched out the amplitude of\r\nthe store-houses, and determined to bring the line into victorious\r\ncompetition with the rail for all the freight of the port that would\r\nbear slow moving. The wharves of Warner & Co. now extend from Water\r\nstreet to the Christine River, and from Market to King streets. There\r\nare three communications daily with Philadelphia, and tri-weekly ones\r\nwith New York and Boston. Their Philadelphia line consists of two\r\nsteam-barges of one hundred and fifty tons, and they are constructing\r\na third at a shipyard we have yet to examine--that of the Jackson\r\n& Sharp Company--of two hundred and fifty tons burden. The four\r\nrailroads of Wilmington--the Baltimore line, the Wilmington and\r\nReading, the Western, and the Delaware Road--all run their cars by\r\ncontinuous rails to the wharves of Warner & Co., where freight is\r\ntransferred from cars to steamers with extreme rapidity, by four\r\nsteam-hoisters placed on the ground for the purpose. A stationary\r\nengine also takes hold of the cars, and moves them from place to place\r\non the rail as wanted. The handling by steam-power--a great change\r\nfrom the days of the old bell under the eaves!--of course reduces\r\ngreatly the necessity for mere human porters. The steamers ply to a\r\nwharf at Chestnut street, Philadelphia, and also, as aforesaid, to New\r\nYork. In respect to the latter port, the Messrs. Warner anticipate an\r\nearly day when various novel manufactures established at Wilmington\r\nwill demand new freights from the New York market, and to hasten that\r\nday they offer very strong inducements for return cargoes. Such is a\r\nspecimen of a transport-office, transformed from old-fashioned ideas\r\nto the newest ambitions of the time. While the iron road will always\r\ncollect a large portion of moving merchandise, there will still\r\nbe another large portion for which the superior cheapness of\r\nwater-transport will be a successful inducement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF THE WILMINGTON WHARVES.]\r\n\r\nAn immense bid which Wilmington makes for future greatness is in the\r\nexcellence of her harbor. Shipping there is at once safe and unimpeded\r\nin its exit. The Delaware and its bay below the city are broad and\r\nwithout sudden bends. Ice does not gather, and the influence of the\r\nocean, by its tidal movement and salt water, makes the breaking of a\r\nchannel comparatively easy. The Christine harbor, from any point near\r\nits mouth, can be kept open to the sea in all ordinary winters by a\r\nstout and well-built tug. The Christine is much wider--probably by\r\nthree times--than the Chicago River, upon which every ton of the\r\nmagnificent commerce of that great city is delivered. It has a better\r\nentrance and deeper water, as well as greater breadth. Wilmington\r\nbelieves she has a better issue for her manufactures in the Christine\r\nand Delaware than Glasgow possesses in the Clyde. The Clyde is\r\nnarrower and more difficult to keep in order than the Christine, and\r\nGlasgow's facilities for getting materials for shipbuilding are not as\r\ngreat as Wilmington's.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the cost of production of iron ships in Wilmington\r\nand on the Clyde, exclusive of the premium on gold, is at this time\r\nabout ten per cent. only. Taking the present price of gold (fourteen),\r\nthis increases the difference to about twenty-four per cent. The\r\nfalling off in the price of gold, which is so generally expected,\r\ntogether with the advance in labor in Great Britain, and the\r\nconsequent advance in the price of iron there, will soon bring the\r\ncost nearly equal in both countries. Indeed, if our shipbuilders would\r\nuse the light and inferior iron in their ships that is used on the\r\nClyde, the cost would not now materially differ. This will not be\r\ndone, however, for reasons that are too evident to need stating; and\r\nby waiting until the prices have adjusted themselves naturally and\r\npermanently, a more lasting and desirable prosperity will be gained.\r\nMeditating these considerations, Wilmington is quite serene\r\nand fearless under the present temporary depression of American\r\nshipbuilding.\r\n\r\nThere are some features connected with the life and education of the\r\noperatives so abundant in this town, some additional industries, a\r\nfew items of religious history, and a few evidences of modern taste\r\nor luxury, that we wish to consider; but these must be reserved for a\r\nsecond paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROUMI IN KABYLIA.\r\n\r\nSECOND PAPER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM CONSTANTINA TO SETIF.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roumi who leaves Constantina for Setif has a choice of two\r\nroutes--one picturesque, lively and covered with Roman remains; the\r\nother perfectly arid, and distinguished by the fact that in five miles\r\nthere are just four trees.\r\n\r\nHe turns, however, as he settles himself in his stirrup amongst the\r\ninterested Arab population of Constantina, to cast a last look at the\r\nugly French streets in which, as a tourist, his lot was cast. The Arab\r\nquarters, where life still flows on in the old African style, have\r\nseized his attention exclusively, and he remembers with a kind of\r\ncontemptuous remorse that he has paid no regard to the smart modern\r\nedifices and offices that belong to French occupation. Yet one of\r\nthese, at least, the staring Napoleonic Palais de Justice, would yield\r\nhim a romance from time to time.\r\n\r\nHere, in December, 1872, twenty-one natives of the Belezma were tried\r\nat a court of assizes for the massacre, last April, of twelve French\r\ncolonists. The affair was a sequel of the French-Prussian war. The\r\nnatives, for a long time past on good terms with strangers, became\r\ninsolent, boasting that France was ruined, and that all the French\r\nwould soon disappear from Algeria. Some of the tribes, however,\r\nremained, if not friendly, at least less hostile. The revolt had\r\nbecome almost general, and on the 21st of April the sheikh Brahim of\r\nthe Halymias informed the little colony near Batna that they were\r\nno longer safe in the forest, and offered to escort them into Batna.\r\nThese colonists were the workmen at the saw-mills of a M. Prudhomme,\r\nabout ten miles out of the town. The Europeans, consisting of thirteen\r\nmen, one woman named Dorliat and her four children, set out the next\r\nmorning, accompanied by Brahim and about forty of his men. On arriving\r\nin a ravine they were suddenly attacked by a large body of the rebels.\r\nSix of the party, who were in the rear, succeeded in escaping, but\r\ntwelve of the men were massacred. Madame Dorliat, it is said, owed\r\nher life to a native named Abdallah at the saw-mills, who, on seeing\r\nher in tears before starting, said to her: \"Woman, you have nothing\r\nto fear: no harm will be done to you or to your children. As for the\r\nmen, I will not answer for them.\" As she continued to weep, he added:\r\n\"Listen! When you see the guns pointed at your breast, say this\r\nprayer: 'Allah! Allah! Mohammed racoul Allah!' and you will be saved.\"\r\nHe also taught the same prayer to her children. In the midst of the\r\nslaughter several Arabs had leveled their firearms at her to shoot\r\nher, when she remembered Abdallah's lesson, and throwing herself on\r\nher knees to them repeated the invocation. The murderers stopped, made\r\nher say it over again, and asked, \"Do you mean it?\" On her replying\r\nin the affirmative they spared her, but stripped her entirely naked,\r\nand took from her three of her children: she only recovered them\r\nthirty-two days later, and one of them died from a sabre-cut in the\r\nhead, received during the fight. The woman's husband was among the\r\nkilled, and so was the proprietor of the mill, M. Prudhomme. Of the\r\ntwenty accused brought to trial at Constantina, twelve were condemned\r\nto death and three to hard labor; the others, among whom was the\r\nsheikh Brahim, being acquitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNTAIN ARABS.]\r\n\r\nSevere justice is the only condition on which French supremacy can be\r\nmaintained in the country, and probably for the general Arab populace\r\nthe rule of the Gauls is a judicious one. But it is to be questioned\r\nwhether the rule of _talion_ is the right one for the Kabyles.\r\nIn 1871, at the height of the French troubles with the Commune,\r\nformidable revolts were going on among the descendants of those\r\nuntamable wretches whom Saint Arnaud smoked out in a cave. In July the\r\ngarrison at Setif heard the plaint of a friendly cadi, named D'joudi,\r\nwho had been wantonly attacked for his loyalty to the French by some\r\norganized mutineers under Mohammed Ben-Hadad. The poor wretch had been\r\nobliged to flee, with his women and his flocks, into the protection\r\nof his country's oppressors. Since the chassepot has succeeded in\r\nreducing the Kabyles once more to a superficial obedience, the courts\r\nhave been busy with the sentences of their insubordinate leaders.\r\nFrance imitates England's sanguinary policy in her treatment of\r\nrebellious and semi-civilized tribes. Eight of the leaders of the\r\nKabyle revolt of 1871 have been condemned to death, and a number\r\nof others have been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. The\r\nKabyles will take their revenge when another European war places the\r\nAlgiers colonists at their mercy.\r\n\r\nThe guides who accompany the traveler serve, in the absence of the\r\ntrees, to attract his scrutiny. These mountain Arabs are superb\r\nfellows. Lips almost black, and shaded with lustrous beards, set off\r\ntheir perfect teeth, white, small, and separated like those of a young\r\ndog. Their black eyes are soft or stern at will. They are usually of\r\nmiddle size, large-chested, as befits Arabs from the hills, with small\r\nheads and finely-tapered wrists and ankles. They are dressed in red,\r\nwith a covering of two bornouses--a white one beneath, and a black\r\none fastened over. Long iron spurs are attached to their boots of\r\nred morocco, which come up to the knee; for the Algerian Arab, a\r\nbare-legged animal when walking, is a booted cavalier when mounted.\r\nThe white haik, or toga, is fastened around the temples. The horse\r\nof the principal guide is a fine iron-gray, with an enormous tail of\r\nblack--high-stepping, and carrying his elaborately-draped burden as\r\nproudly as a banner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ARAB DOUAR.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this imposing guard of honor, the traveler minces along\r\non a dumb, timid mule, who smells the ground in a sordid and vulgar\r\nmanner, and is guided by a pitiful rope bridle. Such are the hackneys\r\nand the guides, engaged on the recommendation of the commandant of\r\nConstantina, who undertake to carry us to Setif and on to Bou-Kteun\r\nin Kabylia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WASHERWOMEN.]\r\n\r\nSetif, the ancient metropolis of this part of Mauritania, and\r\ncelebrated for a brave defence against the invading Saracens, is now\r\nthe healthiest spot occupied by the French in all Algeria. It lies on\r\na great table a mile above the sea, is fortified, and has four good\r\nstreets, but pays for its salubrity by the extreme outspokenness of\r\nthe climate. It is subject to snow for six months, and is enveloped\r\nin a cloud of dust the other six. It is in the midst of a great\r\ngrain-producing country, and is famed for its market, held every\r\nSabbath. The surrounding folk dress for market, instead of dressing\r\nfor Sunday, and exhibit the whitest of bornouses above the dustiest of\r\nlegs as they sit crooning over trays of eggs or onions, brought far on\r\nfoot through the powdery roads.\r\n\r\nAs we leave Setif we are overtaken by the lumbering stage-coach, which\r\nplunges and jolts over the road to Sibou-Areridj--a coach apparently\r\nabout the age of the carriage of General Washington, for Algeria is\r\nthe infirmary of all the worn-out French diligences. Sibou-Areridj is\r\nreached and passed, and a few miles farther on is encountered an Arab\r\ndouar, or assemblage of tents forming a tribal fraction. This woven\r\nvillage, although we have attained the limits of Kabylia, reminds us\r\nthat we have not yet reached the Kabylian abodes: an Arab lives in\r\na tent in all localities outside the great cities--a Kabyle, never.\r\nHowever poor the hut in which the Kabylian artisan starves and labors,\r\nit must be a solid mansion founded upon the soil, and its master\r\nmust feel himself a householder. Our douar proves to be an encampment\r\nbelonging to the marabouts, or high religious orders, situated on a\r\nlarge plot of ground in the ownership of the saints, and extending\r\nup to the limits of Kabylia. Composed of a circle of tents numbering\r\nabout fifty, and exhibiting numbers of fine horses picketed near\r\nthe tent-doors, it is as fine a specimen as we shall see of the\r\npatriarchal life inherited from the unfatherly father of Ishmael. The\r\npavilions are of a thick camel's hair stuff, very laboriously made\r\nby the women, which swells up in the rain and completely excludes\r\nmoisture. They are striped brown and yellow, but a splendid tabernacle\r\nin the centre, of richer colors and finer fabric, bears at the apex\r\na golden ball with plumes of ostrich feathers, the sign of authority.\r\nThis tent is oval in form, resembling an overturned ship. It is the\r\nresidence and office of the sheikh, or chief of the douar: several\r\ndouars united form a tribe, governed by a caid. We venture to visit\r\nthe sheikh, assured by our spahi guides that we shall be welcome. We\r\nare received blandly by the officer, offensively by his dogs, a throng\r\nof veritable jackals who scream around our feet as we enter. The\r\ninterior, rich and severe at once, exhibits saddles and arms, gilded\r\nboxes and silken curtains, without a single article of furniture. The\r\nsheikh treats us to mild tobacco in chiboukhs--another sign that we\r\nare not yet in Kabylia: never is a Kabyle seen smoking. We reciprocate\r\nby offering coffee, made on the spot over our spirit-lamp--a process\r\nwhich the venerable sheikh watches as a piece of jugglery, and then\r\ndismisses us on our way with the polite but final air which Sarah may\r\nbe supposed to have used in dismissing Hagar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STONE TURBAN.]\r\n\r\nThe douar, like a city, has suburbs of greater squalor than its\r\ninterior, and among them, under the palm trees, we see women washing\r\nclothes or engaged in the manufacture of couscoussou, a dish common\r\nto the Arab, the Kabyle and the traveler hereabouts, and so important\r\nthat a description of its preparation may be acceptable.\r\n\r\nIn the opening of a small tent, then, we paused to watch an old\r\nmoukere (or daughter of Araby), whose hands look as if she had been\r\nstirring up the compost-heap of bones, pickings and dirt before the\r\ndoor. With these hands she rolls dexterously a quantity of moistened\r\nflour upon a plate. Long habit has made it easy to her, and in an\r\nincredibly short time she has formed a multitude of small grains--her\r\nhands, it must be said, looking a great deal cleaner after the\r\nprocess. On the fire is a pot of water, just placed. She interrupts\r\nher labor to throw in a piece of kid, which, with a quantity of\r\nspices, she stirs around with her callous hand, almost to the\r\nboiling-pitch of the water. She then addicts herself once more to\r\nthe manufacture of the flour-grains, of which she has directly made\r\na perfect mountain. The water now boiling, she places the granulated\r\npaste in a second earthen pot or vase, whose bottom, pierced like a\r\ncolander with holes, fits like a cover upon that in which the meat is\r\nboiling. The steam cooks the grains, which are afterward served upon a\r\nplatter, with the meat on top and the soup poured over. All travelers\r\nagree that, when you do not witness the preparation, couscoussou is a\r\ntoothsome and attractive dish, fit to be set beside the maccaroni of\r\nRossini.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOU-KTEUN.]\r\n\r\nOn the plateau outside the douar we find the cemetery, with its tombs;\r\nfor the Arab, content to sleep under tissue while he lives, must needs\r\nsleep under mason-work after he is dead. Under the koubba, or dome,\r\nis seen a sarcophagus covered with a crimson pall, the tomb of a dead\r\nmarabout: banners of yellow or green silk, the testimony of so many\r\npilgrimages to Mecca, hang over the dead. In the graveyard round about\r\nare tombstones roughly sculptured, and the stone turbans indicating\r\nthe cranium of a Mussulman; the Arab, again, after building his\r\nhouse of camel's hair, ordering his last turban to be woven by the\r\nstone-mason!\r\n\r\nWe pass along a sterile country, with chalky rocks cropping from the\r\nground and making our way increasingly difficult. All is dry as a\r\nlime-basket. The climate here, completely wanting in the sense of a\r\njust medium, knows no resource between the utter desiccation of all\r\nthe water-courses in summer and an outpouring in winter which carries\r\naway trees, crops and arable earth, presenting the farmer with a\r\nresult of boulders and sand. The rocks sound beneath our animals' feet\r\nfor an hour or two: we dip into a ravine and attain Bou-Kteun, our\r\nfirst Kabylian town.\r\n\r\nIt is night, and we invoke the hospitality of the village chief,\r\ncalled by the Kabyles the amin. Our prayers are not refused. The\r\namin receives the strangers, not so much from a feeling of social\r\netiquette, of which he knows little, as from his religion, which\r\ncommands him to receive the guest as the messenger of God. He comes\r\nto the threshold, kisses our hands without servility, waits on us at a\r\nsupper which he is too polite to share, and presents us with a prayer\r\nat our bedside. Bou-Kteun, situated halfway up the \"Red Plateau,\"\r\nguards the pass called the Gates of Iron. It is an uninteresting\r\nvillage, the official house being alone respectable amidst a town of\r\nhuts. As the amin accompanies us a little way outside the burgh, we\r\nremark, among the young orchards, stumps of olive and fig trees sawn\r\naway at the base. The amin shows them with sad satire, saying in\r\nexplanation, \"French Roumi:\" it was the Christian French.\r\n\r\nThat is the term, meaning no compliment, which the Kabyle fits to all\r\nEuropeans alike. In vain the Frenchman, writhing with intellectual\r\nrepugnance, explains that he is not a Christian--that he is a\r\nVoltairean, a creature of reason, an _illuminé_. The Kabyle continues\r\nto call him a Roumi, which will bear to be translated Romanist, being\r\nimitated from the word Rome and applied to all Catholics. These same\r\ntribes doubtless called Saint Augustine a Roumi, and he returned the\r\nepithet Barbari or Berbers--a name which the emperors applied with\r\nvast contempt to the hordes and mongrel population of exiles and\r\nconvicts that peopled Mauritania, and which the natives retained until\r\nthe Arab invasion, when they changed Berber for Kebaïle.\r\n\r\nThe Romans conquered the shores and the plains. You find none of\r\ntheir ruins among the mountains, where the Berbers, from the Roman\r\noccupation to the French, have preserved an independence never\r\ncompletely subdued.\r\n\r\nThe Kabyle villages are united into federations. If these federations\r\nengage in quarrels--which is by no means rare--or if a village is\r\nmenaced by an enemy, signals are placed in the minarets to appeal\r\nto the towns of the same party. These are easily seen, for all the\r\nvillages are on hilly crests and visible from a distance. From the\r\nsummit of Taourit el Embrank we can count more than twenty of these\r\nKabyle towns, perched on the peaks around us, and separated by\r\nprofound chasms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOBRIZ, AN ENEMY OF THE GUILLOTINE.]\r\n\r\nEvery trait points out the distinction between the Kabyles and the\r\nsurrounding Arabs. The Arabs seek laziness as a sovereign good; the\r\nKabyles are great artificers. The Arabs imprison their wives; the\r\nKabyle women are almost as free as our own. The Kabylian adherence to\r\nthe Mohammedan faith is but partial, and is variegated by a quantity\r\nof superstitions and articles of belief indicating quite another\r\norigin. While the Koran proclaims the law of retaliation, eye for\r\neye and tooth for tooth, the more humane Kabyle law simply exiles\r\nthe criminal for ever, confiscating his goods to the community. It\r\nis true, the family of a murdered person are expected to pursue the\r\nhomicide with all the tenacity of a Corsican vendetta, but the tribal\r\nlaws are kept singularly clean from the ferocity of individual habits.\r\nA strange thing, indicating probably a derivation from times at least\r\nas early as Augustine, is that the Kabyle code (a mixture, like all\r\nprimitive codes, of law and religion) is called by the Greek term\r\ncanon (_kanoun_). An institution of great protective use, in practice,\r\nis the safe-conduct, or _anaya_, a token given to a guest, traveler or\r\nprescript, and which protects the bearer as far as the acquaintance of\r\nthe giver extends: it may be a gun, a stick, a bornouse or a letter.\r\nThe _anaya_ is the sultan of the Kabyles, doing charity and raising no\r\ntaxes--\"the finest sultan in the world,\" says the native proverb. The\r\nKabyles press into all the towns and seaports for employment with\r\nthe same independence as if they were a neighboring nationality. They\r\nbuild houses, they work in carpentry, they forge weapons, gun-barrels\r\nand locks, swords, knives, pickaxes, cards for wool, ploughshares,\r\ngun-stocks, shovels, wooden shoes, and frames for weaving. They weave\r\nneatly, and their earthenware is renowned. In addition, they are\r\nexpert and shameless counterfeiters. Yes, the fact must be admitted:\r\nthese rugged mountaineers, so proud, and, according to their own code,\r\nso honorable, never blush to prepare imitations of the circulating\r\nmedium, which they only know as an appurtenance and invention of their\r\ncivilized conquerors. In his rude hovel, with all the sublimities\r\nof Nature around him, this child of the wilderness looks up to the\r\nsummits of the Atlas, \"with peaky tops engrailed,\" and immediately\r\nthereafter looks down again to attend to the engrailing of his neat\r\nfive-franc pieces, which can hardly be told from the genuine. This\r\nmultiplication of finance was punished under the beys with death.\r\nThe bey of Constantina arrested in one day the men of three tribes\r\nnotorious for counterfeiting, and decapitated a hundred of them. There\r\nwas lately to be seen at Constantina the executioner who was charged\r\nwith this punishment, the very individual who cut off the ingenious\r\nheads of all these poor money-makers, and did not \"cut them off with\r\na shilling.\" He appeared to modern visitors as a modest coffee-house\r\nkeeper in the Arab quarters, who would serve you, for two cents, a\r\ncup of coffee with the hand that had wielded the yataghan. He was an\r\nold Turk, with wide gray moustaches, dressed in a remarkable and\r\ntheatrical fashion. He wore a yellow turban of colossal size, and an\r\nample orange girdle over a dress of light green. Poor Tobriz--that was\r\nhis name--was violently opposed to the introduction of the guillotine\r\nin Algeria. In the days of his prosperity an enormous sabre was passed\r\nthrough his flaming girdle. In the early years of the French conquest\r\nTobriz was employed in the decapitations, which were executed with a\r\nsaw, and must have been a horrible spectacle. He remembered well the\r\nexecution of the hundred counterfeiters in one night, and their heads\r\nexposed in the market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE IRON GATES.]\r\n\r\nA rapid descent from Bou-Kteun to the bed of a river of the same name,\r\nand a pursuit of the latter to its confluence with the river Biban,\r\nlead through impressive ravines to the Iron Gates. The waters of the\r\nBiban, impregnated with magnesia, leave their white traces on the\r\nbottoms of the precipices which enclose them. The mules pick their\r\nway over paths of terrible inclination. At length, at a turn in the\r\noverhanging reddish cliffs, where a hundred men could hold in check\r\nan entire army, we find ourselves in front of the first gate. It is a\r\nround arch four yards in width, pierced by Nature between the rocks.\r\nThe second is at twenty paces off, and two others are found at a\r\nshort distance. Between the first and second we observe, chiseled in\r\nthe stone above the reach of the water, \"_L'Armée Française_, 1839,\"\r\nengraved by the sappers attached to the army of the duke of Orleans on\r\nthe passage of the expedition.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHINESE STORY.\r\n\r\n  None are so wise as they who make pretence\r\n  To know what fate conceals from mortal sense.\r\n  This moral from a tale of Ho-hang-ho\r\n  Might have been drawn a thousand years ago,\r\n  Long ere the days of spectacles and lenses,\r\n  When men were left to their unaided senses.\r\n\r\n  Two young short-sighted fellows, Chang and Ching,\r\n  Over their chopsticks idly chattering,\r\n  Fell to disputing which could see the best:\r\n  At last they agreed to put it to the test.\r\n  Said Chang: \"A marble tablet, so I hear,\r\n  Is placed upon the Bo-hee temple near,\r\n  With an inscription on it. Let us go\r\n  And read it (since you boast your optics so),\r\n  Standing together at a certain place\r\n  In front, where we the letters just may trace.\r\n  Then he who quickest reads the inscription there\r\n  The palm for keenest eyes henceforth shall bear.\"\r\n  \"Agreed,\" said Ching; \"but let us try it soon:\r\n  Suppose we say to-morrow afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Nay, not so soon,\" said Chang: \"I'm bound to go,\r\n  To-morrow, a day's ride from Ho-hang-ho,\r\n  And sha'n't be ready till the following day:\r\n  At ten A.M. on Thursday let us say.\"\r\n\r\n  So 'twas arranged. But Ching was wide awake:\r\n  Time by the forelock he resolved to take;\r\n  And to the temple went at once, and read\r\n  Upon the tablet: \"To the illustrious dead--\r\n  The chief of mandarins, the great Goh-Bang.\"\r\n  Scarce had he gone when stealthily came Chang,\r\n  Who read the same; but, peering closer, he\r\n  Spied in a corner what Ching failed to see--\r\n  The words, \"This tablet is erected here\r\n  By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear.\"\r\n\r\n  So, on the appointed day--both innocent\r\n  As babes, of course--these honest fellows went\r\n  And took their distant station; and Ching said,\r\n  \"I can read plainly, 'To the illustrious dead--\r\n  The chief of mandarins, the great Goh-Bang.'\"\r\n  \"And is that all that you can spell?\" said Chang.\r\n  \"_I_ see what you have read, but furthermore,\r\n  In smaller letters, toward the temple-door,\r\n  Quite plain, 'This tablet is erected here\r\n  By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear.'\"\r\n\r\n  \"My sharp-eyed friend, there are no such words!\" said Ching.\r\n  \"They're there,\" said Chang, \"if I see anything--\r\n  As clear as daylight!\" \"Patent eyes, indeed,\r\n  You have!\" cried Ching. \"Do you think I cannot read?\"\r\n  \"Not at this distance, as I can,\" Chang said,\r\n  \"If what you say you saw is all you read.\"\r\n\r\n  In fine, they quarreled, and their wrath increased,\r\n  Till Chang said, \"Let us leave it to the priest:\r\n  Lo, here he comes to meet us.\" \"It is well,\"\r\n  Said honest Ching: \"no falsehood he will tell.\"\r\n\r\n  The good man heard their artless story through,\r\n  And said, \"I think, dear sirs, there must be few\r\n  Blest with such wondrous eyes as those you wear.\r\n  There's no such tablet or inscription there.\r\n  There was one, it is true; 'twas moved away,\r\n  And placed _within_ the temple yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nC.P. CRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBERRYTOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA straggling old house, painted yellow, and set down between a\r\ncorn-field and the village pasture for family cows; old walnut trees\r\ngrowing close to its back and front, young walnut trees thrusting\r\nthemselves unhindered through beet and tomato patches, and even\r\nthrough the roof of the hennery in the rear, which had been rebuilt to\r\naccommodate them, spreading a heavy shade all about, picturesque but\r\nunprofitable.\r\n\r\nOld Peter Guinness used to sit on the doorstep every hot summer\r\nevening, smoking his cigar, and watching the hens go clucking up to\r\nroost in the lower branches and the cattle gathered underneath.\r\n\r\n\"What a godsend the trees are to those poor beasts!\" he said a dozen\r\ntimes every summer.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We risk dampness and neuralgia and ague to oblige the town\r\ncows,\" Mrs. Guinness would reply calmly.\r\n\r\n\"I shall cut them down this fall, Fanny. I'm not unreasonable, I hope.\r\nDon't say a word more: I forgot your neuralgia, my dear. Down they\r\ncome!\"\r\n\r\nBut they never did come down. Mrs. Guinness never expected them to\r\ncome down, any more than she expected Peter to give up his cigar.\r\nWhen they were first married she explained to him daily the danger of\r\nsmoking, the effect of nicotine on the lungs, liver and stomach: then\r\nshe would appeal to him on behalf of his soul against this debasing\r\ntemptation of the devil. \"It is such a gross way to fall,\" she would\r\nplead--\"such a mean, sensual appetite!\"\r\n\r\nPeter was always convinced, yielding a ready assent to all her\r\narguments: then he would turn his mild, cow-like regards on her: \"But,\r\nmy dear, I smoke the best Partagas: they're very expensive, I assure\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nLong ago his wife had left him to go his own way downward. As with\r\nsmoking, so with other ungodly traits and habits. She felt his\r\ncondemnation was sure. It was a case for submission at the female\r\nprayer-meeting; bemoaning his eternal damnation became indeed a part\r\nof her religion, but the matter was not one to render her apple-cheeks\r\na whit less round or her smile less placid. The mode in which Peter\r\nearned their bread and butter interfered more with her daily comfort\r\nand digestion. Dealing in second-hand books, half of which were\r\ndramatic works, was a business not only irreligious, but ungenteel.\r\nShe never passed under the swinging sign over the door without feeling\r\nthat her cross was indeed heavy, and the old parlor, which had been\r\nturned into a shop, she left to the occupancy of her husband and\r\nKitty.\r\n\r\nOut of the shop, one summer afternoon, had come for an hour the\r\nperpetual scrape, scrape of Peter's fiddle. He jumped up at\r\nlast, suddenly, bow in hand, and went to the doorstep, where his\r\nstepdaughter sat sewing. From the words he had overheard in the next\r\nroom he was sure that the decisive hour of life had just struck for\r\nthe girl, and there she was stitching her flannel and singing about\r\n\"Alpine horns, tra-la!\" She ought to have known, he thought, without\r\nhearing. A woman ought to be of the kindred of the old seeresses,\r\nand by the divine ichor or the animal instinct in her know when the\r\nsupreme moment of love approached.\r\n\r\nBut what kind of love was this coming to Kitty?\r\n\r\nHe twanged the strings just over her head, to keep her from hearing,\r\nbut quite out of tune, he was so agitated with the criticalness of\r\nthe moment. But then most moments were critical to Peter Guinness, and\r\nagitation, his wife was wont smilingly to assure him, was his normal\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nHe anxiously watched Catharine's restless glances into the room where\r\nher mother and the clergyman sat in council. She had guessed their\r\nobject then? She was opposed to it?\r\n\r\nA thoughtful frown contracted her forehead. Suddenly it cleared:\r\n\"Oysters? Yes, it is oysters Jane is broiling. I'm horribly hungry.\r\nI could go round the back way and bring us a little lunch in here,\r\nfather. They'll never see us behind the books.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shame on you, Kit! You're nothing but a greedy child.\" But he laughed\r\nwith a sudden sense of relief. She really was nothing yet but a\r\nhealthy child with a very sharp remembrance of meal-times. It would\r\nbe years before her mother or Mr. Muller would talk to her of the\r\nmarriage or the work they had planned for her.\r\n\r\n\"Just as you please,\" taking up her flannel again. \"Very likely it\r\nwill be midnight before we have supper: Mr. Muller often forgets\r\nto eat altogether. From what mother tells me, I suppose approving\r\nconscience and a plate of grits now and then carry him through the\r\nday. It's different with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very different, Kitty. Don't flatter yourself that you will ever be\r\nlike him in any way. William Muller is a Christian of the old type.\r\nThough, as for grits, a man should not disregard the requirements of\r\nthe stomach too much,\" with an inward twinge as he smelt the oysters.\r\nHe began to play thoughtfully, while Kitty looked again through\r\nthe book-shop to the room beyond. The books about her always made\r\nunfamiliar pictures when one looked at them suddenly. They lay now\r\nin such weights of age and mustiness on the floor, the counters, the\r\nbeams overhead, the yellow walls of them were lost in such depths of\r\ncobwebs and gloom, that they made a dark retreating frame, in which\r\nshe sat like a clear, fine picture in the doorway, the yellow sunset\r\nlight behind her. She could see her mother looking in at her, and the\r\nplump, neat little clergyman in his tight-fitting ribbed suit of brown\r\nand spotless shirt-front. He gently stroked his small black imperial\r\nas he talked, but his eyes behind their gold eye-glasses never wavered\r\nin their mild regard of her. Kitty grew restless under it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Muller is talking of the class of books you keep, father,\" she\r\nsaid, lowering her voice: \"I'm sure of it. They are as unsavory in his\r\nnostrils as to the reformers in the village. They'd all excommunicate\r\nyou if they could.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guinness, Book Agent, Kitty,\" finishing his tune with a complacent\r\nscrape, \"has been known for twenty years, while Berrytown belongs\r\nto yesterday. But the intolerance of these apostles of toleration is\r\nunaccountable. They mean well, though. I really never knew people\r\nmean better; yet--\" He finished the sentence with a shake of the head,\r\nsolemnly burying the fiddle in its case.\r\n\r\nBoth he and Catharine turned involuntarily to the window. Five years\r\nago there had been half a dozen old buildings like the Book-house\r\nstretched along Indian Creek, the roofs curled and black, the walls\r\nbulging with age and damp. Now, there was Berrytown.\r\n\r\nBerrytown was the Utopia in actual laths, orchards and bushel-measures\r\nof the advance-guard of the reform party in the United States. It was\r\nthe capital of Progress, where social systems and raspberries grew\r\nmiraculously together. Thither hied every man who had any indictment\r\nagainst the age, or who had invented an inch-rule of a theory which\r\nwas to bring the staggering old world into shape. Woman-Suffrage,\r\nFree-Love, Spiritualism, off-shoots from Orthodoxy in every sect, had\r\nthere food and shelter. Radical New England held the new enterprise\r\ndear as the apple of her eye: Western New York stretched toward\r\nit hands of benediction. As Catharine looked out, not a tree stood\r\nbetween her and the sky-line. Row after row of cottages replete with\r\nwhite paint and the modern conveniences; row after row of prolific\r\nraspberry bushes on the right, cranberry bogs on the left--the great\r\nImproved Canning-houses for fruit flanking the town on one side,\r\nMuller's Reformatory for boys on the other. The Book-house behind its\r\nwalnut trees, its yellow walls clammy with lichen, was undeniably a\r\nblot, the sole sign of age and conservatism in a landscape which, from\r\nhorizon to horizon, Reform swept with the newest of brooms. No wonder\r\nthat the Berrytownites looked askance at it, and at the book-fanciers\r\nwho had haunted the place for years, knowing old Guinness to be the\r\nkeenest agent they could put upon the trail of a pamphlet or relic.\r\n\r\nThe old man grew surly sometimes when sorely goaded by the new-comers.\r\n\"There's not a man of them, Kitty,\" he would say, \"but has ideas; and\r\nthere's not an idea in the town five years old.\" But generally he\r\nwas cordial with them all, going off into rapt admiration of each new\r\nprophet as he arose, and he would willingly have stood cheek by jowl\r\nwith them in their planting and watering and increase if they had not\r\nsnubbed him from the first. Book-shops full of old plays, and a man\r\nwho talked of Scott's width of imagination and Clay's statesmanship,\r\nwere indigestible matter which Berrytown would gladly have spewed out\r\nof her mouth. \"What have aimless imagination and temporizing policy\r\nto do with the Advancement of Mankind? Dead weight, sir, dead weight!\r\nwhich but clogs the wheels of the machine.\" Any schoolboy in Berrytown\r\ncould have so reasoned you the matter. While Catharine was growing\r\nup, therefore, the walnut trees had shut the Guinnesses into complete\r\nsocial solitude until deliverance came in the shape of Mr. Muller.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nBesides her supper now, Catharine wanted her share of this visitor.\r\nNothing else, in fact, came in or went out of her life. Outside lay\r\nemancipated Berrytown, to unemancipated Kitty only a dumb panorama:\r\ninside, her meals, her lessons and perpetual consultations with her\r\nmother on bias folds and gussets while they made their dresses or\r\nsewed for the Indian missions. Kitty was quite willing to believe that\r\nthe Berrytown women were mad and unsexed, but ought the events of\r\nlife to consist of beef and new dresses and far-off Sioux? She laughed\r\ngood-humoredly at her own grumbling, but she looked longingly out of\r\nthe window at the girls going by chattering in the evenings with their\r\nsweet-hearts; and certainly the Man coming into her life had affected\r\nher not unpleasantly. Not that the clergyman, with his small jokes and\r\nsmall enthusiasms, was any high revelation to her mind; but there was\r\nno other.\r\n\r\n\"It's something to hear a heavy step about the house, and to see the\r\ncarpet kicked crooked,\" she said sometimes. Her mother would shake her\r\nhand gently and smile.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and smiled in precisely the same way now. Mr.\r\nMuller, who had grown excited as he talked, felt a wave of insipid\r\npropriety wash over his emotions, bringing them to a dead level.\r\n\r\n\"However the matter may conclude,\" said Mrs. Guinness pleasantly, \"why\r\nshould you and I lose our self-control, Mr. Muller? Now, why should\r\nwe? Ah?\"\r\n\r\nThere was something numbing in the very note of prolonged\r\ninterrogation. The folds of Mrs. Guinness's glossy alpaca lay calmly\r\nover her plump breast; her colorless hair (both her own and the\r\nswitch) rolled and rose high above her head; her round cheeks were\r\nunchanging pink, her light eyes steady; the surprised lift of those\r\nflaxen eyelashes had made many a man ashamed of his emotions and his\r\nslipshod grammar together.\r\n\r\nMr. Muller was humbled, he did not know why. \"It is practical enough,\r\nI suppose,\" he said irritably, \"to ask what Catharine herself thinks\r\nof marriage with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You never tried to discover for yourself?\" with an attempt at roguish\r\nshrewdness.\r\n\r\n\"No, upon my honor, no!\" The little man fairly lost his breath in his\r\nhaste. \"I have a diffidence in speaking to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Kitty!\" with an amused, indulgent smile, which worsted him again.\r\n\r\nHe struggled back into the hardest common sense: \"Of course it is not\r\ndiffidence in me. I feel no hesitation in discussing the question of\r\nmarriage with anybody else. My family wish me to marry: my sister has\r\nsuggested several young ladies to me in well-to-do religious families\r\nin the city. There are marriageable young women here, too, whose\r\nacquaintance I have made with that object in view. Very intelligent\r\ngirls: they have given me some really original views on religion and\r\npolitics. One can talk to them about anything--social evils or what\r\nnot. But Catharine--she is so young! It is like broaching marriage to\r\na baby!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Guinness was silent. The sudden silence struck like a dead wall\r\nbefore the little man, and bewildered and alarmed him: \"Perhaps, Mrs.\r\nGuinness, you think I ought not to look upon Catharine as another man\r\nwould? I should regard a wife only as a fellow-servant of the Lord? I\r\noughtn't to--to make love to Kitty, in short?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a dear, pious child. I love to think of her in the midst of\r\nyour Reformed boys,\" said the lady evasively.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. \"Of course, you know,\" he said with an\r\nanxious laugh, \"I never had a serious thought of those young ladies\r\nchosen by my sister. Social position or wealth does not weigh with me,\r\nMrs. Guinness--not a feather!\" earnestly. If he really had meant to\r\ngive her a passing reminder that marriage with Kitty would be a step\r\ndown the social grade for him, he was thoroughly scared out of his\r\nintention. As he talked, reiterating the same thing again and again,\r\nthe heat rose into his neatly-shaved face and little aquiline nose.\r\n\r\nMrs. Guinness observed his agitation with calm triumph. She knew but\r\none ladder into heaven, and that, short and narrow, was through her\r\nown Church. Kitty was stepping up on a high rung of it. Once the wife\r\nof this good Christian man, and her soul was safe. A sudden vision of\r\nher flitted before her mother in grave but rich attire (fawn-colored\r\nvelvet, for instance, for next winter, trimmed with brown fur),\r\nto suit her place as the wife of the wealthy Muller, head of the\r\ncongregation and the Reformatory school: she would be instant, too, at\r\nprayer--meetings and Dorcas societies. This was Mrs. Guinness's world,\r\nand she reasoned according to the laws of it. She rejoiced as Hannah\r\ndid when she had safely placed her child within the temple of the\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nAnd yet with that hint of the social position of the Mullers had come\r\nthe certainty to her that this marriage could never be. A shadow had\r\nstood suddenly before her--a boy's face, the only one before which\r\nher calm, complacent soul had ever quailed or shrunk. The pleasant,\r\napple-cheeked woman, like the rest of us, had her ghost--her sin\r\nunwhipped of justice. She stood calmly as Mr. Muller hurried his\r\nexplanations, piling them one on top of the other, but she did not\r\nhear a word of them. If he should ever hear Hugh's story! Dead though\r\nhe was, if that were known not a beggar in the street would marry\r\nCatharine.\r\n\r\nBut since Fanny Guinness was an amiable, pink-cheeked belle in the\r\nvillage choir, she had never turned her back on an enemy: why should\r\nshe now? Hugh Guinness had hated her as the vicious always hate\r\nthe good, but she was thankful she had smiled and greeted him with\r\nChristian forbearance to the very last. As for this danger coming from\r\nhim, now that he was dead, the safest way was to drag it to the light\r\nat once. All things worked together for good to those who loved the\r\nLord--if you managed them right.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" she said, as if just finishing a sentence, \"you are\r\nindifferent to social rank. And yet it will be no slight advantage to\r\nyou that Catharine has no swarm of needy kinsfolk. Her own father died\r\nwhen she was a baby. Mr. Guinness is the only near friend she has ever\r\nknown except myself. He had a son when I married him--\" The boy's\r\nname stuck in her throat. For a moment she felt as the murderer\r\ndoes, forced to touch his victim with his naked hand. \"Hugh--Hugh\r\nGuinness--was the lad's name.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of him,\" indifferently.\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not probable you should. Long before Berrytown was built\r\nhe went to Nicaragua. He died there. Well,\" with a little wave of the\r\nhand, \"there you have Kitty's whole family. It will be better that she\r\nshould be so untrammeled, for the interests of the school.\"\r\n\r\n\"The school? I'm not a Reformatory machine altogether, I suppose!\" He\r\nhad been watching Catharine, who was moving about in the shop. When\r\nhe was not in sight of her he always remembered that she was a mere\r\nchild, to be instructed from the very rudiments up after marriage,\r\nand that the Guinnesses were ten degrees, at least, below him in the\r\nsocial scale. But she was near--she was coming! The complacent smile\r\nwent out of his trig little features: he moved his tongue about\r\nto moisten his dry lips before he could speak. He was absolutely\r\nfrightened at himself. \"There's more than the school to be thought of,\r\nMrs. Guinness,\" he blurted out. \"I--I love Catharine. And I want this\r\nmatter settled. Immediately--within the hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. You will be satisfied with the result, I am sure, Mr.\r\nMuller. I give Catharine to you with all my heart.\" But she did not\r\nlook any more at ease than he. They both turned to look at Kitty, who\r\ncame toward them in her usual headlong gait through the shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHer mother scanned Catharine when she came in as she had never done\r\nbefore. She was \"taking stock\" of her, so to speak: she wished to know\r\nwhat was in the girl to have secured this lover, or what there was\r\nto hold him should he ever hear Hugh's damning story. Her eye ran\r\nover her. She was able to hold her motherly fondness aside while she\r\njudged her. Kitty was flushed and awakened from head to foot with the\r\nexcitement of this single visitor.\r\n\r\n\"At her age,\" thought Mrs. Guinness, \"_I_ could have faced a regiment\r\nof lovers. Kitty's weak: I always felt her brain was small--small. She\r\nhas nothing of my face, or address either. There's no beauty there\r\nbut youth, and her curious eyes.\" She never had been sure whether she\r\nadmired Kitty's eyes or not.\r\n\r\nBut clergymen and reformers were as vulnerable as other men to soft,\r\nflushing cheeks and moist lips, and Mr. Muller, as she judged from his\r\nagitation, was no wiser than the rest. He pressed nervously forward,\r\nbridging his nose with his eye-glasses.\r\n\r\n\"Catharine, my child, will you walk out with me? I wish to consult you\r\non a little matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, with pleasure,\" said Kitty.\r\n\r\nHer mother stood aghast. Like the mass of women, she viewed the\r\nmatter of love from the sentimental, L.E.L. stand-point. It had been a\r\nforbidden subject to Kitty. Her heart her mother supposed, slept, like\r\nthe summer dawn, full of dreams, passion, dewy tenderness, waiting for\r\nthe touch of the coming day. What kind of awakening would the plump\r\n\"Will you marry me?\" of this fat little clergyman be? In the street\r\nof Berry town, too! in the middle of the afternoon! If it were only\r\nmoonlight!\r\n\r\n\"Pray wait until evening, Catharine: you're always famished for your\r\nsupper,\" she cried anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not hungry now at all,\" running up the stairs. For\r\npoliteness' sake Kitty would lie with a smile on her mouth though a\r\nfox were gnawing at her stomach. Something in her running reminded Mr.\r\nMuller that she was a school-girl and he a middle-aged noted reformer.\r\nHe fidgeted about the room, looking at the prints of La Fayette and\r\nFranklin on the whitewashed wall, and the Tomb of Washington done in\r\nfaded chenilles by Mr. Guinness's first wife, buttoning his gloves\r\nwith an anxious frown.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know what my sister Maria will say to this,\" after\r\none or two uneasy laughs. \"I never mean to be eccentric, yet somehow\r\nI always am different from anybody else. Now, in church-matters--_I_\r\nnever intended to leave the orthodox communion, yet when I showed how\r\nmy Church was clinging to worn-out dogmas, and opened my Reformatory\r\nin Berrytown, the Free-Religionists in Boston seized me, and printed\r\nmy opening sermon under one cover with that of an Oneidaite and a\r\nSpiritualist. Do _I_ look like a medium or a Free-Lover? That was\r\ngoing a little too far, I take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah?\" came Mrs. Guinness's calm interrogatory. No more.\r\n\r\nWilliam Muller was a man of culture and a certain force in one\r\ndirection, and when pleading the cause of the vicious children to\r\nwhom he was giving his life could hold men of real mental strength\r\nattentive and subdued. He did not know why, when this commonplace\r\nlittle woman had her steady eye on him, he should always dribble out\r\nall his weakness to her. But he did it--talked on in a leaky way\r\nof his squabble with his church and the praises he had received in\r\nnewspapers for his school, until he heard Kitty's step on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! there she is!\" he cried relieved.\r\n\r\nCatharine came back, close buttoned in a brown dress, with high-laced\r\nboots, and a light stick in her hand. She used to call it her\r\nalpenstock, and make all Switzerland out of the New Jersey sands with\r\nit. She ran in to kiss her father good-bye, blushing and delighted.\r\nIt was the first time she had ever walked with any man but himself.\r\n\"Here's an adventure!\" she whispered. Every day she and Peter expected\r\nan adventure before night. She drew back startled at the strange,\r\nuneasy look he gave her. Her mother, too, pulled her hastily away, and\r\nwalked beside her to the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Child,\" she whispered breathlessly, \"he is your lover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lover?\" said Kitty aloud. \"Lover?\" But Mr. Muller joined her at the\r\nmoment, and opening the gate motioned for her to precede him. They\r\nwent down the quiet street together.\r\n\r\nMrs. Guinness went back and watched them from the shop-window. \"It is\r\nas I thought,\" she said triumphantly.\r\n\r\nPeter nodded. She came behind him, leaning on his shoulder. \"It was\r\nonly proper for me to speak to him of--of--\" It was fifteen years\r\nsince Hugh's name had passed between them.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever was necessary to protect you and Catharine,\" he said\r\nquietly. She pressed her hands on his forehead beneath his wig, and\r\npresently he drew one of them down and held it to his lips, thinking\r\nhow forbearing she had been with his boy. Mrs. Guinness went up stairs\r\nthen and knelt down by the bed. She was rather fond of the exercise\r\nwhich she called praying--taking a larger image of herself into her\r\nconfidence. Her one idea of Him was that He could provide comfortably\r\nhere and elsewhere for herself and Catharine. But to-day her\r\nconscience irritated her like a nettle. Could it be that she was at\r\nsoul tricky? Could God hold her, rigorous church-member, fond wife\r\nand mother as she was, guilty of this boy's blood? Nettles, however,\r\ndo not sting very deeply. She rose presently, unfolded her work, and\r\nsat sewing and singing a hymn, a complacent smile on her good-humored\r\nface.\r\n\r\nDown in the shop Peter had taken out the violin again, and was playing\r\nsome nameless old air, into the two or three monotonous notes of which\r\nhad crept an infinite stillness and longing. He often played it, but\r\nonly when he was alone, for he would not allow Kitty to hear any but\r\nmerry, vivacious music.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Catharine and Mr. Muller walked down the street in absolute\r\nsilence, Kitty bearing herself with her usual grave politeness,\r\nthough there was a quizzical laugh in her eyes. \"Lover? My lover?\"\r\nshe thought. But she did not blush, as some other innocent girls would\r\nhave done. She had never talked an hour in her life to a young man, or\r\nheard from other girls their incessant chirping of \"he--he,\" like that\r\nof birds in spring wooing their mates. Her nearest acquaintance with\r\nlovers was old Peter's rendering of Romeo or Othello. She remembered\r\nthem well enough as her eye furtively ran over the jaunty little\r\nfigure beside her. \"Is his hose ungartered, his beard neglected, his\r\nshoe untied?\" she thought. \"Pshaw! he is not Orlando, any more than I\r\nam Rosalind.\" Her mother had been mistaken, that was all: she let the\r\nmatter slip easily past her. There was a certain tough common sense in\r\nCatharine that summarily sent mistakes and sentimental fancies to the\r\nright about.\r\n\r\nMr. Muller, finding the words he wished to speak would not come at\r\nonce, and ashamed of jogging on in silence, began to overflow with\r\nthe ordinary ideas of which he was full. They passed the grape-packing\r\nhouse. \"Eight thousand boxes despatched last season, Catharine! And\r\nthere is the Freedmen's Agency. Three teachers supported, five hundred\r\nprimers furnished to Virginia alone since January, and I really forget\r\nthe number of Bibles. But the world moves: yes indeed. And I think\r\nsometimes Berrytown moves in the van.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no doubt of that,\" said Kitty politely. \"Dear me! Five hundred\r\nspelling-books!\" But she felt humiliated. She had neither picked\r\ngrapes nor taught freedmen. What thin wisps of hair these women had\r\nstopping to speak to Mr. Muller! She put her hand suddenly to the back\r\nof her head.\r\n\r\n\"Those are employees in the canning-house,\" he said as they passed on.\r\n\"One is educating herself as a short-hand reporter, and the other has\r\na lecture ready for next winter on Shakespeare's Women.\"\r\n\r\n\"What admirable persons they must be! Ah! now I have it right!\"\r\nsetting her hat higher on the light chestnut coils. Mr. Muller looked,\r\nand his eye rested there. She knew that, though the back of her head\r\nwas toward him. But lover? Nonsense! He meant no doubt to propose that\r\nshe should go into the typesetting business or stenography.\r\n\r\nNow, to tell Kitty's secret, she had had her love-affair her mother\r\nknew nothing about, which made her purblind in this matter. It was\r\nthis: There was a certain cave (originally a spring-house) behind\r\nthe walnut trees, quite covered over with trumpet-vines and\r\npartridge-berries. She had a bench there, from which she could see\r\nonly the shady old house and the sun going down. When she was a child\r\nof about eight, alone all day long, year in and out, she had taken\r\ndown this bench, and working stealthily and blushing terribly, had\r\nmade it large enough for two. She never allowed anybody, not even\r\nPeter, dearest of all, to come into the cave or sit on the bench\r\nafterward. What her childish fancy of an unknown friend was, or how\r\nit grew and altered with her years, only she knew, though after she\r\nwas grown she told her father of a certain Sir Guy in some of his\r\ncrusading stories in whom she had believed as a fact. \"I actually\r\nthought he would come to woo me,\" she said laughing, \"and I had a\r\ncastle where I sat and waited for him. There never was a child so full\r\nof absurd fancies.\"\r\n\r\nBut she never said where the castle was, and she was fond still of\r\nsitting alone for hours on the old bench, over which the shade grew\r\nheavier year by year, and the moonlight crept with more mysterious\r\nglitter. She came in sometimes when she had been there in the evening,\r\nand the sound of old Peter's violin alone broke the silence, with her\r\ncheeks feverish, as though there had been an actual presence with her\r\nto share her secret thoughts. The only living being she had ever taken\r\ninto her hiding-place was, oddly enough, a baby of whom she was fond.\r\nIt happened to fall asleep in her arms one day, and Catharine stole\r\nout with it and sat on the old seat, feeling its warm breath on\r\nher breast. The girl was shaken by an emotion which she did not\r\nunderstand: her blood grew hot, her breath came and went, she stroked\r\nthe baby's hand and foot, kissed it, glanced about her with eyes\r\nguilty yet pure.\r\n\r\nBut it is certain Kitty had no thought of her cave this afternoon. Mr.\r\nMuller and his affairs were quite another matter. There was an awkward\r\nsilence. Mr. Muller was collecting his forces: he cleared his throat.\r\n\"Catharine--\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, William!\" cried a clear, well-toned voice behind them. He turned,\r\nhalf annoyed and half relieved, to meet a young lady in gray, stepping\r\nalertly from the doorway of the Water-cure House.\r\n\r\n\"Maria? This is my sister Maria, Miss Vogdes.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady looked at Kitty--a steady, straightforward look--then held\r\nout her hand. It was a large, warm, hearty hand, and gripped yours\r\nlike a man's. Kitty took it, but felt like shirking the eyes. She\r\nhad no mind to be so weighed and measured. She had an uncomfortable\r\nconsciousness that her inner nature was all bared and sorted by this\r\nagreeable young woman in this first moment to the last odd and end in\r\nit, though she could not have put the consciousness into words.\r\n\r\n\"Going to the school, William? I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--yes, we will go there.\" He turned irresolutely, and they walked\r\ntogether down the plank pathway, Kitty with an oppressive sense of\r\nhaving fallen into the clutch of one of the Primal Forces, who was\r\nabout to settle her destiny for her; in which she stumbled almost on\r\nthe truth. Miss Muller was quite aware of the fact of her brother's\r\nvisits at the book-shop, and their motive. She glanced at her watch:\r\nshe could give herself half an hour to find out what stuff was in the\r\ngirl, though it hardly needed so long. \"A good type of the Domestic\r\nWoman in the raw state,\" she thought. (She always jotted down her\r\nthoughts sharply to herself, as a busy shopkeeper makes entries in his\r\nday-book.) \"Pulpy, kissable. A vine to which poor William would appear\r\nan oak. A devoted wife, and, if he died, a gay widow, ready to be a\r\nfond wife to somebody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean to make of yourself, Miss Vogdes?\" she snapped\r\nsuddenly, just as Kitty was counting the hen-coops of the society in\r\nthe field they were passing, and wondering how she could contrive to\r\nget a pair of their Cochin Chinas.\r\n\r\n\"To make?\" stammered Kitty (\"I knew she would take me by the throat\r\nsomehow,\" she thought)--\"of myself?--Why, I am Peter Guinness's\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You poor child!\" Miss Muller laughed. It was a very merry, infectious\r\nlaugh. She laid her hand on Kitty's shoulder gently, as though she\r\nhad been a helpless kitten. \"Now you see how our social system works,\r\nWilliam. Ask a boy that question, and his answer comes pat--a doctor,\r\ncarpenter, what not. In any case, he has a career, an independent soul\r\nand identity. This poor girl is--Peter Guinness's daughter, is content\r\nto be that. Though perhaps,\" turning sharply on her, \"she thinks of\r\nthe day when she will be the wife of somebody, the mother of children.\r\nThose, two ideas are enough to fill the brains of most women.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Muller colored, and smiled significantly to himself. Catharine\r\nlooked at her with a grave suspense, but made no answer.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Miss Muller went on, a certain heat coming into her delicate\r\nface, \"that contents the most of them--to be the fool or slave of a\r\nlover or a husband or son. 'The perfume and suppliance of a minute--no\r\nmore but that.'\"\r\n\r\nShe walked on in silence after this, and Catharine scanned her\r\nquietly. She was not at all the mad woman Mrs. Guinness had always\r\ndescribed her--not at all what Kitty had fancied a lecturer on woman\r\nsuffrage, a manager of the Water-cure and a skillful operating surgeon\r\nmust be. She was little, pretty, frail, with a very genuine look and\r\nvoice--almost as young as Kitty, and far more tastefully dressed.\r\nCatharine eyed her wonderful coiffure with envy, and was quite sure\r\nthose rosy-tipped, well-kept fingers never had anything to do with\r\ncutting up dead babies.\r\n\r\nMr. Muller at the moment was comparing the two girls critically. The\r\npoint on which he dwelt longest was that his sister's eyes, fine,\r\nlimpid and brown, were those of an actress, acting to herself very\r\nprobably. They went through the whole imperative mood--exhorted,\r\ncommanded, entreated in five minutes: even a certain woeful sadness\r\nwhich came into them at times, and was there now, was quite bare and\r\nready to be seen of all men.\r\n\r\n\"She is always on review before herself: she is conscious of herself\r\nfrom head to foot,\" he thought with shrewdness only born out of long\r\nknowledge. \"Her very toes, I've no doubt, say to each other, 'I,\r\nMaria.'\"\r\n\r\nAs for his future wife, her eyes were given her to see with,\r\nnothing more. \"And she looks out with them, never in,\" he reflected\r\ncomplacently. For he had come by this time to regard her as his future\r\nwife. It seemed quite natural when Maria presently took Kitty in hand\r\nas one of the family, and began to manage for her as she did for them\r\nall, from Grandfather Hicks down to the dog Tar.\r\n\r\n\"I think, William, Miss Vogdes has the maternal instinct largely\r\ndeveloped,\" looking at her face and the shape of her head as a\r\nnaturalist would at a new bug. \"You could find work for her in here,\"\r\nunlatching the gate of the Reformatory school. \"She could serve\r\nhumanity here just as well as if she had more--more--well, we'll say\r\nstamina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely what I thought of,\" cheerfully. \"You've hit the nail on\r\nthe head about her, Maria.\" He was a peaceable, affectionate fellow at\r\nbottom. He had never hoped that his sister would tolerate Kitty, and\r\nwomen's squabbles in a family he abhorred, like every other man; and\r\nhere she was extending a hospitable greeting, finding work for Kitty\r\nalready. _Io triumphe!_\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you show Miss Vogdes the institution, sister?\" he said,\r\nrubbing his eye-glasses and putting them on again in a flutter of\r\npleasure and cordiality.\r\n\r\nMiss Muller nodded authoritatively, and he fell into the background.\r\n\r\n\"You'll observe, Miss Vogdes,\" with a laugh and shrug, \"Berrytown has\r\ngiven its best of æsthetic instincts here: five square stories painted\r\nwhite, with green shutters; pebble walks; six straight evergreens to\r\ntestify of the Beautiful. Inside--here we are! Parlor: yellow-pine\r\nfloors, spotless; green paper blinds in the windows, that hang\r\nstirless the year round. This is the kitchen: white boards, shining\r\ncaldrons. William, show the soup.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Muller gravely held up a ladleful: \"Beef and cabbage. To each\r\nchild we allow per diem three parts of animal food, three purely\r\nfarinaceous, four vegetable. The proper scale, I hold, of healthful\r\nnourishment,\" putting back the ladle. He had not spilled a drop.\r\n\r\n\"Dining-room,\" continued Miss Muller: \"more white boards; shining\r\ntin plates; these three hundred little figures in blue jeans ranged\r\nagainst the wall are the--the patients. Now observe.\" Mr. Muller\r\nrapped once, they raised their hands; twice, they clasped them; three\r\ntimes, they rattled off the Lord's Prayer; the next moment they were\r\nshoveling their soup into their mouths in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Vogdes does not approve their religious teaching, William. You\r\nsee,\" turning to her, \"how they need a real motherly care. _You_ could\r\ngive it to them.\"\r\n\r\nBut Kitty, who perhaps did \"want stamina,\" and who was more of a child\r\nthan any before her, made no answer. Vice and disease faced her as\r\nnever before: those hundreds of hungry eyes fenced her in.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sick?\" said Mr. Muller anxiously, seeing her face. \"It is\r\nthe smell of the soup, perhaps. Come out of this. Let me pass, Maria.\r\nYou forget how foolishly tender her life has been: she never probably\r\nlooked at crime before. Come out to the fresh air.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better stay,\" said Maria coolly, aside. \"These children will\r\nplead your cause with such a girl as that better than you can do or\r\nhave done, I take it. Now, my dear,\" putting Kitty's hand between her\r\nown, \"this is my brother's work, in which he wishes you to join him.\r\nPut it to yourself whether it is not your duty. You're very young;\r\nyou've dreamed a good deal, most likely: this wakening to the fact\r\nthat there is work in the world besides marrying and nursing babies\r\nrevolts and shocks most young girls. Yet here it is.\" Her voice was\r\nvery gentle, and sincere in every cadence, the words true: there lay\r\nthe terrible grinding power of them. \"Talk over your future life with\r\nWilliam, my dear. There is the matron. I must go and see about that\r\ncharge for pepper she made last month. Pepper for these children's\r\nstomachs, indeed!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Muller drew Catharine's hand in his arm. \"I did not mean to\r\nbring you here to-day,\" he said, nervously mopping his face with his\r\nhandkerchief. \"Maria is so fond of managing! But--but it was as my\r\nwife I wanted your help.\"\r\n\r\n\"_My wife._\" Kitty was not surprised. At eighteen one reasons as the\r\nbird flies. Since she passed the six straight evergreens yonder she\r\nhad learned that life was not an old book-house, a few sad and merry\r\ntunes, meals, and a bench to dream on. It was work--for Christ. Not\r\nfar-off pagans, but little children with sin and disease heavy upon\r\nthem, asking her to take it away.\r\n\r\nShe might want stamina or any other intellectual power, but her\r\nemotions were hot and near the surface: these children and their\r\nmisery wounded and bruised her as they had never done Mr. Muller or\r\nhis sister: her sense of duty and affection for her God, too, was as\r\nreal and urgent with her as that of a dog for his master.\r\n\r\n\"Take me home now,\" she said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"But, Catharine--This is no answer. And my love for you is of such\r\nlong standing!\" pleaded the little man, whose mouth, being once opened\r\nby his passion, found it difficult to close. He forgot, too, the\r\nhundreds of eyes staring at him over the soup-spoons.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go out?\" said Kitty with an impatient laugh, which would not\r\nbe polite. \"There's too much beef here. And cabbage.\"\r\n\r\nThey passed Miss Muller, who nodded down on Catharine from the heights\r\nof brusque sincerity of the Woman's Rights people: \"Come and see me,\r\nmy dear. You and I shall get on very comfortably, I dare say;\" to\r\nwhich Kitty replied with her old-fashioned manner, which had a fine\r\ncourteous quality in it, whether it meant anything or not.\r\n\r\nThey were out in the street again. The sun was still hot and glaring.\r\nPast the new row of Morse's blue-painted shops, down the factory\r\nalley, all along the cinder path, Mr. Muller pressed and urged his\r\nsuit. She heard every word with sharp distinctness.\r\n\r\nThe children: her work for Christ. Under all was a dull consciousness\r\nthat this thing had been coming on her since the day, years ago, when\r\nshe had suffered conviction at a revival and been converted. All His\r\nfollowers must give their lives to His service. Give their lives!\r\nThese were words which to the poor little girl had always been\r\nterribly real, never a hackneyed form. Now the time had come, there\r\nwas a dreadful wrenching at her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, God! oh, my God! I want to do what's right!\" cried Kitty\r\nsilently, looking away to the farthest horizon.\r\n\r\nMr. Muller remembered by this time some of his long-planned endearing\r\nspeeches, and used them. But he could not bring a blush to her cheek.\r\nShe did presently look straight at him, her eye passing quickly and\r\ncritically over the neat paunchy little figure in its fashionably-cut\r\ncoat and tight-fitting trowsers. When she was a girl of ten she had\r\nfancied that Dr. Brownlee would be her future husband--the actual\r\nSir Guy. She would listen Sunday after Sunday to the gray-bearded old\r\nfellow dealing the thunders of Sinai from the pulpit overhead, in a\r\nrapt delight, thinking how sweet it would be to be guided step by step\r\nby so holy and great a man. Long after she grew out of that, indeed\r\nonly a year or two ago, she used to tremble and grow hot to her\r\nfinger-tips when young Herr Bluhm, the music-master, went by the gate.\r\nA nod of his curly bullet head or the tramp of his sturdy cowskin\r\nboots along the road made her nerves tingle as never before. \"What was\r\nthis that ailed her?\" she had asked herself a dozen times a day. All\r\nMr. Muller's love-making did not move her now as one note of Bluhm's\r\nvoluntaries on the organ had done. She had thought him Mendelssohn and\r\nMozart in one: the tears came now, thinking of that divine music. But\r\none day Mrs. Guinness had brought him in, being a phrenologist, to\r\n\"feel Kitty's head.\" She felt the astonished indignation yet which\r\nstunned her from his thick thumb and fore finger as they gripped and\r\nfumbled over her head as if she had been a log of wood. But what could\r\npoor Bluhm know of the delicate fancies about himself in her brain as\r\nhe measured it, which his heavy paws, smelling of garlic and tobacco,\r\nwere putting to flight? \"Philoprogenitiveness--whew! this little girl\r\nwill be fond of children, madam. Tune, time!--has no more notion of\r\nmusic than a frog.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least,\" thought Catharine now, \"Mr. Muller is a gentleman. I shall\r\nnever feel disgust for him.\"\r\n\r\nThey had reached the gate now. He waited. \"I shall not come in. I've\r\nconfused and startled you, Catharine. You want time to think,\" he said\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\"I understand, oh, I quite understand. But I never thought of myself\r\nas your wife,\" she said quietly. \"It would be better you gave me\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, then, my--my darling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood looking over the gate, the walnut branches dark overhead, a\r\nlevel ray of sunlight on her strange alluring eyes and full bosom. Mr.\r\nMuller lingered, smoothing his hat before he put it on.\r\n\r\n\"She has not at all the intellectual power of Maria,\" he thought.\r\n\"Maria's the sort of woman I ought to have chosen, I suppose,\" being\r\na reformer, first of all, in the very grain. But the silly thought of\r\nholding her hand or kissing her lips came to him at the moment, and\r\ntormented him thereafter with a feverish desire.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCatharine stood a long time by the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Don't question the child,\" said Peter to her mother. He would not\r\neven look at her when she came in, but fidgeted about, his leathery\r\njaws red as a girl's at the thought that Kitty loved and was beloved.\r\n\r\n\"Is supper over? I'm hungry,\" was all she said. They watched her\r\nfurtively as she ate.\r\n\r\n\"It's prayer-meeting night, Catharine,\" said Mrs. Guinness when she\r\nwas through, taking her bonnet from the closet.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Muller will miss you, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Muller never has enough of prayer-meetings,\" recklessly, \"but I\r\nhave. I prefer going to bed to-night;\" and she went up stairs.\r\n\r\nBefore her mother was gone, however, she began to change her dress,\r\nputting on one which, when the cape was not worn, left her shoulders\r\nand arms bare. She shook down her hair after the fashion of a portrait\r\nin the book-shop of Kitty Clive, Peg Woffington or some other ancient\r\nbeauty more amiable than discreet. There was a delicious flavor of\r\nwickedness in the taking out of every hairpin. Then she came down to\r\nPeter where he sat smoking.\r\n\r\n\"In the dark, father? I'll light the candles;\" which she did, scolding\r\nJane savagely between-times. \"We'll have some old plays to-night,\r\nfather,\" bringing a book which her mother had forbidden, and then\r\nbringing his sheepskin-lined chair up to the table. Peter eyed her\r\nfurtively as he puffed out his cigar to the last ash. On the stage\r\nor in the ball-room he had never seen, he thought, a finer woman than\r\nCatharine; and the old man's taste in beauty or dress or wine had been\r\nkeen enough when he was a young blood on the town. He was annoyed and\r\nirritable.\r\n\r\n\"Catharine,\" he said sharply \"bring your shawl: the night is chilly.\"\r\nBut he read the plays with outward good-humor, and with an inward\r\ndelight and gusto, which he would not betray. All his youth--that\r\nold Peter Guinness, for whom each day's bumpers had been frothed so\r\nhigh--came back in the familiar exits and entrances. The words were\r\ninnocent enough as he altered them in reading for Kitty, though a\r\ngood deal disjointed as to meaning; but she was not critical--forced\r\nherself to take an interest in his stories of Burton and Kean, and how\r\nhe first saw old Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" moving uneasily on her stool at his feet, \"that this now\r\nis 'the world, the flesh and the devil!' But,\" viciously snapping her\r\neyes, \"I like it, I like it! I wish I could think of something else to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nIn the middle of Peter's croaking of \"Poor Yarico,\" to show her how\r\nCatalani sang it on the London boards, she jumped up and went to the\r\nwindow. People were coming home from prayer-meeting, husbands and\r\nwives together.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose every woman must marry, father?\" she said.\r\n\r\nPeter looked doubtfully at her over his spectacles, opened his mouth\r\nand shut it once or twice. \"I judge that is the highest lot for a\r\nwoman,\" he said slowly, \"to be the wife of a good man.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good man? Oh yes, good enough!\" and with that she flung herself\r\ndown on the floor, and, putting her head on Peter's knee, cried as if\r\nher heart would break. For Kitty was never in the habit of carrying\r\nher pain off into solitary places: when she cried it must be with her\r\nhead on somebody's knee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis chapter of Catharine's history every wide-awake young woman\r\namong our readers has doubtless finished for herself: she knows the\r\nclosing-in process by which society, expediency, propinquity, even\r\nmoral obligations, hedge many a man and woman and drive them into\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nIn the weeks that followed she saw but one path open to her: in it lay\r\nher work for Christ and her woman's birthright to be a wife and mother\r\n(for Kitty, ever since she was a baby nursing dolls, had meant to be\r\nboth).\r\n\r\nShe spent most of her time shut up with her Bible and hymn-book,\r\nsometimes praying over them, sometimes sticking in her forefinger and\r\nopening at chance verses to try her fortune about this affair. During\r\nthis time she was usually unnaturally humble and meek, but there were\r\ndays when her temper was intolerable.\r\n\r\n\"Don't come complaining to me,\" said Peter testily to her mother. \"The\r\nchild's a good child enough. But when you force her to stretch her\r\nheart over three hundred vicious little imps, no wonder it breaks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kitty's a free agent,\" she replied calmly.\r\n\r\nKitty was a free agent, and at the end of two weeks she accepted Mr.\r\nMuller.\r\n\r\nREBECCA HARDING DAVIS.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIERS OF PARADISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Spring is waking, and the Yokul lifts on high his glittering shield,\r\n  Far and wide in sunny splendor gleams the ice-engirded field,\r\n  And the swelling freshet murmurs gay spring-ditties as it flows,\r\n  Till its noisy life it mingles in the ocean's grand repose;\r\n                      And in silence,\r\n                      Dream-fraught silence,\r\n              O'er its course the billows close.\r\n\r\n  On the strand they gayly played, where the trembling birch trees grow,\r\n  Children both with golden ringlets and with cheeks like maiden snow,\r\n  Wherein blushed fresh spring-like roses--blushed and hid, and blushed again,\r\n  While they plucked the shining pebbles, smooth-worn by the stormy main;\r\n                      And in silence,\r\n                      Rippling silence,\r\n              Chants the sea its old refrain.\r\n\r\n  She, the fair and gladsome maiden, raised her head and called his name:\r\n  He was deep-eyed, light and slender, shy of mien and slight of frame.\r\n  Like a laughing brook she skippèd to and fro along the strand;\r\n  He was grave, like nodding fern-leaf, gently by the breezes fanned,\r\n                      Which in silence,\r\n                      Pensive silence,\r\n              Grows upon the brooklet's sand,\r\n\r\n  \"Ragnas,\" said she, \"when God's angels visit will this world of ours,\r\n  They descend, so mother told me, on the Yokul's shining towers.\r\n  Now, if I should die, then promise thou wilt climb the peaks of ice,\r\n  And my hand I'll reach to help thee up to God's bright paradise.\"\r\n                      But in silence,\r\n                      Wondering silence,\r\n              Gazed he in her innocent eyes.\r\n\r\n  It was summer: thrush and linnet sung their gladsome summer-lay;\r\n  Through the fir trees' cooling vista rose the cataract's white spray;\r\n  And the light blue smoke of even o'er the darksome forests fell--\r\n  Rose and lingered like a lover loath to bid his love farewell;\r\n                      And in silence,\r\n                      Wistful silence,\r\n              Shed its peace o'er sunlit dell.\r\n\r\n  On the pleasant hillside sat they, where the silvery birches grow,\r\n  And th' eternal sun of midnight bathed them in its fitful glow--\r\n  She a maid of eighteen summers, fresh and fair as Norway's spring;\r\n  Tall and dark-browed he, like pine-woods in whose gloom the Hulders[1] sing,\r\n                      When in silence,\r\n                      Deep-toned silence,\r\n              Night lets droop her dusky wing.\r\n\r\n  It was now that he must leave her, and the waves and tempest breast:\r\n  Heavy-hearted sat they, gazing on the Yokul's flaming crest;\r\n  And she spoke: \"O Ragnas, never, while yon airy peak shall gleam\r\n  O'er our home, shall I forget thee or our childhood's blissful dream,\r\n                      Until silence,\r\n                      Death and silence,\r\n              Freeze my heart and memory's stream.\"\r\n\r\n  Up he sprang, and boldly looked he toward the midnight-lighted west,\r\n  Seized her white, soft hand and pressed it closely to his throbbing breast,\r\n  And the love his childhood fostered, and in youth made warm his blood,\r\n  Trembled on his lips as trembles bursting flower in freezing bud:\r\n                      Ah, but silence,\r\n                      Fateful silence,\r\n              Held the mighty feeling's flood.\r\n\r\n  Years had passed with autumn's splendor, like a glistening shower of gems;\r\n  Doubly rich the sunlight streamèd from the Yokul's diadems;\r\n  Once again in joyful rapture he his native vale beheld,\r\n  For the love long years had fostered whispered still of faith unquelled,\r\n                      Spite of silence,\r\n                      Hapless silence,\r\n              That the timid tongue had spelled.\r\n\r\n  And his boat shot swiftly onward: well the rowers plied their oar,\r\n  Till a heavy tolling reached them from the church-tower on the shore;\r\n  And a solemn train of barges slowly wound their pensive way\r\n  Through the hushèd waves that glittered o'er their image in the bay;\r\n                      And the silence,\r\n                      Listening silence,\r\n              Dimmed the splendor of the day.\r\n\r\n  O'er the barge that now drew nearer countless virgin lilies wept,\r\n  Telling that some white-souled maiden in the snowy bower slept.\r\n  Dumb he stood, and gazed in terror on the shroud and lilies sweet,\r\n  And a dread foreboding filled him, and his heart forgot to beat;\r\n                      And in silence,\r\n                      Deathlike silence,\r\n              Fell he at the boatman's feet.\r\n\r\n  So the parish-people told me; and as years went rolling by\r\n  Oft they saw him sadly staring on the flaming sunset sky;\r\n  Watched the purple-stainèd Yokul, half in joy and half in pain,\r\n  As if hoped he there to see her coming back to earth again;\r\n                      Mourned his silence,\r\n                      Fateful silence,\r\n              That had rent two lives atwain.\r\n\r\n  Till at length one Sabbath morning--deep-voiced church-bells shook the air--\r\n  While in festal garb the church-folk wandered to their house of prayer,\r\n  Reached their ears a hollow thunder from the glaciers overhead,\r\n  And huge blocks of ice came crashing downward to the river's bed,\r\n                      And in silence,\r\n                      Wrathful silence,\r\n              Down the seething stream they sped.\r\n\r\n  Ah, the breathless hush that followed! for amid the icy waste\r\n  They a human shape discernèd, madly, as by demons chased,\r\n  Up the crystal ledges climbing, pausing now where ice-walls screen\r\n  From the blast, then upward springing o'er abyss and dread ravine,\r\n                      Until silence,\r\n                      Glittering silence,\r\n              Reigned amid the icebergs' sheen.\r\n\r\n  They have searched for him, they told me, sought him far and sought him near:\r\n  Ne'er a trace was found to tell them of his grave so lone and drear;\r\n  But the legend goes that angels swift the shining ether clove,\r\n  And with them his youth's beloved bore him up to God above,\r\n                      Where shall silence,\r\n                      Deepest silence,\r\n              Never sunder hearts that love.\r\n\r\nHJALMAR HJARTH BOYESEN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Hulder is the spirit of the forest, and is\r\nrepresented as a virgin of wonderful beauty. She plays her loor, a\r\nlong birch-bark horn, at evening, and is the protecting genius of the\r\ncattle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHACKERAY'S \"GRAY FRIARS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an eloquent passage in one of Victor Hugo's novels in which\r\nthe writer affectionately apostrophizes the Paris of his youth--those\r\nquaint old streets of the _Quartier Latin_ so redolent of the happy\r\nassociations which cling to the springtide of life. Were Thackeray\r\nliving now, he would, we fancy, experience emotions very similar to\r\nthose of his French _confrère_ should he try to find his beloved \"Gray\r\nFriars,\" which lives enshrined in the most pathetic scene he ever\r\npenned, and is ever and anon coming before us in the pages of his\r\nseveral stories. It is but a few years since the author of _Vanity\r\nFair_ passed away, yet already Gray Friars' surroundings are no longer\r\nthose with which he was familiar.\r\n\r\nDescending Holborn Hill five years ago, you found yourself, when at\r\nthe foot of that celebrated thoroughfare, at Snow Hill, just at that\r\npoint where the words, \"Here he is, father!\" struck upon the parental\r\nears of Mr. Squeers as his son and heir manfully \"went for\" Smike.\r\nTurning to the left, instead of proceeding up Newgate street, a\r\ncircuitous street took you to Smithfield, so long associated with\r\nstakes and steaks. Thence, when half-way through the forest of pens,\r\nyou turned sharp off to the left, and then, after another hundred\r\nyards by a turn to the right, found yourself in a long narrow lane,\r\ncalled Charter-House lane. This brought you presently to some iron\r\ngates admitting you to a quaint and not very mathematical quadrangle,\r\nsuch as you would never have dreamed of stumbling upon there. This\r\nis Charter-House Square, which, still intensely respectable, was once\r\neminently fashionable. At one corner of it is a little recess known as\r\nRutland Square, for on this site once stood the abode of the dukes of\r\nthat ilk, and near to it is a stately mansion with a high pitched roof\r\nwhich was in days long gone the residence of the Venetian ambassador.\r\nA garden occupies the centre of the square. Everything is neat,\r\norderly and severely dull, the most dissipated tenants of the square\r\nbeing boarding-house keepers of a highly sedate description. The\r\nsecret of all this tremendous respectability is to be found in the\r\ncontiguity to the Charter-House itself, a portion of whose buildings\r\nabut on the square, which, with many of the streets adjoining, belongs\r\nto this wealthy institution. Four years ago the place was so secluded\r\nthat a stranger to London might have walked around the spot a dozen\r\ntimes without suspecting its existence, and living in one of its\r\ncomfortable old mansions supposed himself in the cathedral close of\r\na provincial city. The entrance to the Charter-House itself is under\r\nan archway through venerable oaken portals, which are said--and there\r\nseems no reason to question the statement--to be the identical gates\r\nof the monastery which occupied the ground in the time of Henry VIII.\r\nThis monastery had been a religious house of the Carthusians.[2] The\r\norder first came to England in 1180, and was seated at a place called\r\nWitham Priory[3] in Somersetshire, to this day known as Charter-House\r\nWitham. There Henry II. founded and endowed a monastery. The London\r\nbranch of the establishment at Witham was founded by Sir Walter de\r\nManni, seigneur de Manni in Cambrai, France, who was made a knight\r\nof the Garter by Edward III., in reward for gallant services. Manni\r\nfounded the house in pious commemoration of a decimating pestilence,\r\non which occasion not fewer than fifty thousand persons are said\r\nto have been buried within the thirteen acres which he bought\r\nand enclosed, and a gentle eminence known as the \"hill\" in the\r\nplay-ground, separating what was called \"Upper Green\" from \"Under\r\nGreen,\" is said to owe its shape to the thousands of bodies buried\r\nthere. Manni died in 1371: his funeral was conducted with the utmost\r\npomp, and attended by the king and the princes of the blood.\r\n\r\nA hundred and fifty years rolled on without aught very momentous to\r\ninterrupt the daily routine of the monks of Charter-House, who, had\r\nthere not been a woman in the case, might possibly be the occupants of\r\nthe ground to this day. When, however, Henry's fancy for Anne Boleyn\r\nled him to look with favor on the Reformation, the Charter-House, in\r\ncommon with other such establishments, came in for an ample share of\r\nThomas Cromwell's scrutinizing inquiries. And a sad fate its occupants\r\nhad. Required to take the oath of allegiance to Henry VIII., they\r\nrefused. Froude, who gives them an extended notice, says: \"In general,\r\nthe house was perhaps the best ordered in England. The hospitality\r\nwas well sustained, the charities were profuse. Among many good, the\r\nprior, John Haughton, was the best. He was of an old English family,\r\nand had been educated at Cambridge. He had been twenty years a\r\nCarthusian at the opening of the troubles of the Reformation. He is\r\ndescribed as small of stature, in figure graceful, in countenance\r\ndignified: in manner he was most modest, in eloquence most sweet, in\r\nchastity without stain.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of May, 1535, Haughton was executed with all the horrors\r\nattending the punishment of death for high treason in those barbarous\r\ntimes. He and his companions, certain monks of Sion Priory, died\r\nwithout a murmur, and Haughton's arm was hung up under the archway of\r\nthe Charter-House beneath which the visitor drives to-day, to awe his\r\nbrethren. The remnant never gave in. Some were executed; ten died of\r\nfilth and fever in Newgate; and thus the noblest band of monks in the\r\ncountry was broken up by Henry's ruthless hand.\r\n\r\nThe Charter-House was then granted to two men, by name Bridges and\r\nHall, for their lives, after which it was bestowed in 1545 on Sir E.\r\nNorth. North's son sold it to the duke of Norfolk, who resided there,\r\non and off, until decapitated in 1572. The duke was beheaded by\r\nElizabeth for intriguing with Mary queen of Scots, and the papers\r\nproving his offence are said to have been found concealed beneath\r\nthe roof of the stately mansion he had erected for himself at the\r\nCharter-House.\r\n\r\nBefore the duke came to grief that most erratic of sovereigns was a\r\nvisitor at his house--as indeed where was she not?--coming thence\r\nfrom Hampton Court in 1568, and remaining a day with him; and when her\r\nsuccessor, James I., came to take up her English sceptre, he, mindful\r\nof what the Howards had suffered for their sympathy with his mother's\r\ncause, came straight thither from Theobalds, his halting-place next to\r\nLondon, and remained on a visit of four days.\r\n\r\nFrom the duke of Norfolk the Charter-House passed to his eldest son by\r\nhis second wife, Lord Thomas Howard, who was created by James I. earl\r\nof Suffolk;[4] and he about 1609 sold it to Mr. Thomas Sutton.\r\n\r\nSutton's career was remarkable. It was said of the late earl of Derby\r\nthat even had he been born in a shepherd's cot on Salisbury Plain,\r\ninstead of in the purple at Knowsley, he would still have proved\r\nhimself a remarkable man. In local phraseology, he was \"bound to get\r\non,\" and so was Thomas Sutton. The son of a country gentleman at a\r\nplace called Knaith in Lincolnshire, he inherited early in life a good\r\nproperty from his father, and spent some time in traveling abroad.\r\nThen he became attached to the household of the duke of Norfolk,\r\nprobably as surveyor and manager of that great peer's vast estates,\r\nand in 1569, when a serious disturbance broke out in the north of\r\nEngland, he repaired thither, and greatly distinguished himself in\r\naiding to quell it. He then received the appointment of master-general\r\nof ordnance for the North for life.\r\n\r\nWhilst in the North he found another mode of making hay whilst the\r\nsun shone. Soon after his arrival he bought a lease of the bishop\r\nof Durham of the manors of Gateshead and Wickham, and worked the\r\ncollieries on these properties to such good purpose that, on coming\r\nup to London in 1580 he brought with him two horse-loads of money, and\r\nwas reputed to be worth fifty thousand pounds--a great sum in those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAbout 1582 he increased his wealth by marriage, and commenced business\r\nas a merchant in London. His large amount of ready money--a commodity\r\nespecially scarce in those days--soon enabled him to carry on very\r\nlarge commercial operations; and amongst other sources of wealth he\r\nprobably derived considerable profit from his office of victualer of\r\nthe navy. In 1590, finding himself without prospect of children, he\r\nwithdrew from business, and retired to the country, having already\r\ninvested largely in real estate. Although very frugal, there are\r\nsufficient evidences of his liberality to the poor on his property;\r\nand it seems not improbable that his charitable schemes now began to\r\ntake definite form, for after his death a credible witness stated that\r\nSutton was in the habit of repairing to a summer-house in his garden\r\nfor private devotion, and on one of these occasions he heard him utter\r\nthe words: \"Lord, Thou hast given me a large and liberal estate: give\r\nme also a heart to make use thereof.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 1608, when he had quite retired from the world, he was greatly\r\nexercised by a rumor that he was to be raised to the peerage--an honor\r\nwhich it was contemplated to bestow with the understanding that he\r\nwould make Prince Charles, subsequently Charles I., his heir. This\r\nwas a court intrigue to get his money, but an urgent appeal to Lord\r\nChancellor Ellesmere and the earl of Salisbury, prime minister,\r\nappears to have put an end to trouble in the matter. He died on the\r\n12th of December, 1611, at the age of seventy-nine, leaving immense\r\nwealth, and on the 12th of December, 1614, his body was brought on the\r\nshoulders of his pensioners to Charter-House Chapel, and interred in\r\na vault ready for it there, beneath the huge monument erected to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n\"The death-day of the founder is still kept solemnly by Cistercians.\r\nIn their chapel, where assemble the boys of the school and the\r\nfourscore old men of the hospital, the founder's tomb stands, a\r\nhuge edifice emblazoned with heraldic decorations and clumsy,\r\ncarved allegories. There is an old hall, a beautiful specimen of\r\nthe architecture of James's time. An old hall? Many old halls, old\r\nstaircases, old passages, old chambers decorated with old portraits,\r\nwalking in the midst of which we walk as it were in the early\r\nseventeenth century. To others than Cistercians, Gray Friars is a\r\ndreary place possibly. Nevertheless, the pupils educated there love to\r\nrevisit it, and the oldest of us grow young again for an hour or two\r\nas we come back into those scenes of childhood.\r\n\r\n\"The custom of the school is that on the 12th of December, the\r\nFounder's Day, the head gown-boy shall recite a Latin oration in\r\npraise _Fundatoris Nostri_, and upon other subjects; and a goodly\r\ncompany of old Cistercians is generally brought together to attend\r\nthis oration; after which[5] ... we adjourn to a great dinner, where\r\nold condisciples meet, old toasts are given and speeches are made.\r\nBefore marching from the oration-hall to chapel the stewards of the\r\nday's dinner, according to old-fashioned rite, have wands put into\r\ntheir hands, walk to church at the head of the procession, and sit\r\nthere in places of honor. The boys are already in their seats, with\r\nsmug fresh faces and shining white collars; the old black-gowned\r\npensioners are on their benches; the chapel is lighted, and Founder's\r\ntomb, with its grotesque carvings, monsters, heraldries, darkles and\r\nshines with the most wonderful shadows and lights. There he lies,\r\nFundator Noster, in his ruff and gown, awaiting the great Examination\r\nDay. We oldsters, be we ever so old, become boys again as we look at\r\nthat familiar old tomb, and think how the seats are altered since we\r\nwere here; and how the doctor--not the present doctor, the doctor of\r\n_our_ time--used to sit yonder, and his awful eye used to frighten us\r\nshuddering boys on whom it lighted; and how the boy next us _would_\r\nkick our shins during service-time; and how the monitor would cane us\r\nafterward because our shins were kicked....\r\n\r\n\"The service for Founder's Day is a special one. How solemn the\r\nwell-remembered prayers are!... how beautiful and decorous the rite!\r\nhow noble the ancient words of the supplication which the priest\r\nutters, and to which generations of fresh children and troops of\r\nbygone seniors have cried Amen under those arches!\"[6]\r\n\r\nHaving resolved to found a charity which should provide both for\r\nyoung and old, Sutton, who had ample reason fully to appreciate the\r\nunprincipled and grasping character of the court, proceeded to take\r\nevery precaution that sagacity and ingenuity could suggest to keep his\r\nmoney secure from the hands of such harpies as Carr and \"Steenie,\"\r\nand hedge it round with every bulwark possible. Perhaps he consulted\r\n\"Jingling Geordie,\" then planning his own singular scheme,[7] on\r\nthe point, and got him to persuade the king, always vain of his\r\nscholarship, that it would well become him to become patron of an\r\ninstitution having for one of its main objects the education of youth\r\nin sound learning. Be this as it may, the fact is certain that a\r\ndegree of royal and other powerful protection was somehow secured\r\nfor the institution which for all time prevented its funds from being\r\ndiverted to other purposes.\r\n\r\nSutton's bequest of the bulk of his estate to charitable uses was not\r\nunnaturally viewed with strong disapprobation by his nephew, one\r\nSimon Baxter, for whom he had, however, not neglected to provide, who\r\nbrought a suit to set aside the will. However, notwithstanding that\r\nhe had Bacon for his counsel, he failed to interfere with his uncle's\r\ndisposition of his estate; the court holding that the claims of\r\nkinship had been sufficiently recognized.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1614, the institution opened. The rules and orders\r\nfor its government may yet be seen, bearing the autograph signature\r\nof Charles I., then prince of Wales. From that time almost every man\r\nin the country, of the first rank of eminence by birth or fortune,\r\nhas been a governor, and the name of Cromwell may be seen not far\r\nfrom that of Charles on the roll. Up to about 1850 the patronage\r\nwas vested exclusively in the governors. Amongst these were always\r\nincluded--though not necessarily--the sovereign, the archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and the bishop of London. The remainder were men eminent\r\nin Church or State, \"the master of the hospital,\"[9] who must not be\r\nconfounded with the school-master, being the only official member. The\r\nsovereign had two nominations to the other governors' one. Thackeray\r\nmakes the great marquis of Steyne a governor, and shows how little\r\nRawdon Crawley benefited by that august personage's patronage: \"When\r\nLord Steyne was benevolently disposed he did nothing by halves, and\r\nhis kindness toward the Crawley family did the greatest honor to\r\nhis benevolent discrimination. His lordship extended his goodness\r\nto little Rawdon: he pointed out to the boy's parents the necessity\r\nof sending him to a public school; that he was of an age now when\r\nemulation, the first principles of the Latin language, pugilistic\r\nexercises and the society of his fellow-boys would be of the greatest\r\nbenefit to the boy.... All objections disappeared before the generous\r\nperseverance of the marquis. His lordship was one of the governors of\r\nthat famous old collegiate institution called the White Friars. It\r\nhad been a Cistercian convent in old days, when Smithfield, which is\r\ncontiguous to it, was a tournament-ground. Obstinate heretics used to\r\nbe brought thither, convenient for burning hard by. Harry VIII., the\r\nDefender of the Faith, seized upon the monastery and its possessions,\r\nand hanged and tortured some of the monks who could not accommodate\r\nthemselves to the pace of his reform. Finally, a great merchant bought\r\nthe house and land adjoining, in which, and with the help of other\r\nwealthy endowments of land and money, he established a famous\r\nfoundation hospital for old men and children. An extern school grew\r\nround the old almost monastic foundation, which subsists still with\r\nits Middle-Age costume and usages; and all Cistercians pray that it\r\nmay long flourish. Of this famous house some of the greatest noblemen,\r\nprelates and dignitaries of the land are governors; and as the boys\r\nare very comfortably lodged, fed and educated, and subsequently\r\ninducted to good scholarships at the university and livings in the\r\nChurch, many little gentlemen are devoted to the ecclesiastical\r\nprofession from their tenderest years, and there is considerable\r\nemulation to procure nominations for the foundation.\r\n\r\n\"It was originally intended for the sons of poor and deserving clerics\r\nand laics, but many of the noble governors of the institution, with\r\nan enlarged and rather capricious benevolence, selected all sorts\r\nof objects for their bounty. To get an education for nothing, and a\r\nfuture livelihood and profession assured, was so excellent a scheme\r\nthat some of the richest people did not disdain it, and not only great\r\nmen's relations, but great men themselves, sent their sons to profit\r\nby the chance.\"\r\n\r\nA boy on the foundation received his education entirely free. Whilst\r\nwithin the walls he was clothed in black cloth at the expense of\r\nthe house, and even had shirts and shoes provided for him. His only\r\nexpenses were a fee to the matron of twenty-five dollars a year, and\r\nthe cost of books, stationery, etc., the whole amounting to a sum\r\nless than one hundred dollars a year. On leaving school for college he\r\nreceived an allowance--four hundred dollars for three years, and five\r\nhundred dollars for the fourth.\r\n\r\nThere may have been a time when much of the patronage was improperly\r\nbestowed, but this certainly was not the case in our day. The majority\r\nof the boys on the foundation were the sons of well-born and often\r\ndistinguished gentlemen of small means, and the sort of perversion\r\nof patronage to which Thackeray alludes had ceased to take place.\r\nWhen some of the places on the foundation were thrown open, it\r\nwas a subject of general remark that several of the boys who got\r\nscholarships were those whose parents could perfectly have afforded\r\nto give them a first-class education.\r\n\r\nProbably there will some day be a reaction in England in this matter.\r\nThe prevalent present plan is to give every advantage to the clever\r\nboy (which means a boy who has a faculty for acquirement, but often\r\nlacks those qualities most needed to make him a valuable citizen), and\r\nto let those who are not so bright at book-learning, and need every\r\naid, scramble along as they can. It was certainly not the system which\r\nSutton designed, and there are not a few who, without being by any\r\nmeans bigoted conservatives, consider that the utter indifference\r\ndisplayed of late years to the intentions of founders is quite\r\nunjustifiable, and offers little encouragement to those who would\r\nbe disposed to make similar bequests.\r\n\r\nAt Oxford, for instance, nearly every scholarship is now thrown\r\nopen to general competition. This sounds very fine, but is in utter\r\ndisregard of the fact that the founder in most instances was induced\r\nto bequeath his money with the view that those who came from the part\r\nof the country to which he himself belonged should benefit. Of course,\r\ntime had rendered necessary certain changes, but these have been\r\nsweeping to a degree which is inconsistent with a due regard to the\r\nwills of the dead, and meanwhile no one seems disposed to admit that\r\nthe public schools or universities turn out men one whit better than\r\nin days gone by, or indeed do more for the general education of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nRecently a sweeping change has been made at the Charter-House, which\r\nhad seemed to be almost proof against innovation. So far as nominating\r\nboys to the foundation, the governors' patronage will, after one\r\nmore term apiece, be at an end, and the privilege of participating\r\nin Button's benefits will be open to all boys who have been for some\r\nmonths members of the school, and are clever enough to beat their\r\nfellows in competition. The governors reserve, however, their right of\r\nnominating aged or disabled men, whose number now, we believe, amounts\r\nto one hundred.\r\n\r\nA school-day at Charter-House began at eight, with what we called\r\n\"first school.\" Prayers, lasting about five minutes, took place in\r\nthe large school-room. These were read by a \"gown-boy\" monitor. The\r\nlessons at first school consisted entirely of repetition--repeating\r\nLatin poetry, and occasionally prose. As each boy finished his\r\nrepetition--the boys being taken up in the order in which they were\r\nnumbered the previous day--he left the school and went to breakfast.\r\nBreakfast consisted of an almost unlimited supply of hot rolls and\r\nbutter and milk, but this was supplemented in the case of almost every\r\nboy by edibles purchased with his pocket-money. For those who had the\r\nprivilege of fagging this was recognized and allowed, and in regard\r\nto the rest it was connived at, and marmalades, potted meats and\r\nsuch-like relishes freely circulated, being supplied for the most part\r\nby the servants, who drove a lively trade in such comestibles.\r\n\r\nToasting was brought to the very highest perfection. Never before or\r\nsince have we tasted anything of its kind so good as a buttered roll\r\ntoasted. It was a French roll buttered all over outside, and then\r\nskillfully grilled until the outside was a rich crisp brown. This was\r\nbrought by the fag to his master \"hot and hot,\" and, being cut open,\r\neaten with butter. The rooms were warmed by immense open fireplaces,\r\nthere being no limit to the expenditure of coal, which was prodigious.\r\n\r\nIn our time (1847-1853) there was an immense deal of fagging, which\r\nhas been, we believe very properly, much diminished. Under boys were\r\ncalled in to perform many menial offices which should have been done\r\nby servants. The task-work which by \"gown-boys\" was most disliked was\r\nwhat was called being basonite. This duty devolved upon the twelve\r\njunior boys occupying what was known as \"the under bedroom.\" To this\r\nhour we recall with horror how on a gloomy, foggy, wintry Monday\r\nmorning we remembered on waking that it was our basonite week--for a\r\nfresh set of three went to work each Monday morning--and that we must\r\nget up and call the monitors. This basonite duty consisted of the most\r\nelaborate valeting. Each monitor's clothes were brushed, warm water\r\nwas fetched and poured out for him, and everything so arranged that\r\nhe might lie in bed up to the last possible moment, and then one small\r\nboy being ready with his coat, another with his waistcoat, and a third\r\nwith his cap--be able to dress in five minutes and rush into school.\r\nAt midday, when the monitors washed their hands for dinner, similar\r\nwork had to be done, and again in the evening, when they washed their\r\nhands for supper. The only set-off to all this was that each monitor\r\nhad been a basonite, and each basonite had a very good chance of\r\nbecoming a monitor. But it was carrying the fagging system to far too\r\ngreat an extent, and the practice is now greatly modified.\r\n\r\nThe domestic arrangements were in many respects rough and comfortless,\r\nand so intensely conservative were the ruling powers in these respects\r\nthat complaint or remonstrance scarcely received any attention. On\r\nthe other hand, the utmost liberality prevailed in most matters. The\r\nfoundation scholars' dinner, for instance, was provided in a long,\r\nlow, old-fashioned, oak-paneled hall, admirably adapted for the\r\npurpose. The food was excellent in quality, unlimited in quantity, and\r\nvery comfortably served. The only drawback was want of variety, and\r\nthe perennial reappearance of raspberry tartlets every Wednesday at\r\nlength provoked a mutiny against that form of pastry, the order being\r\npassed down that no one was to touch it.\r\n\r\nAn upper boy had two fags, the inferior of the two being called his\r\ntea-fag. A good feeling nearly always subsisted between master and\r\nfag, inasmuch as the former generally selected a boy he liked; and\r\nindeed in many cases the connection engendered a warm and lasting\r\nregard between the parties. The fag had access to his master's study,\r\ncould retreat there to do his lessons in quiet, and not unfrequently\r\nwas assisted in them by his master.\r\n\r\nThose who came off worst were dirty boys: no mercy was shown them.\r\nOne such we can recall--now a very spruce, well-appointed government\r\nofficial--whose obstinate adherence to dirt was marvelous, seeing what\r\nit cost him.\r\n\r\nThere are always some bullies among a lot of boys, but serious\r\nbullying was uncommon, and not unfrequently a hideous retribution\r\nbefell a bully through some \"big fellow\" resolving to wreak on him\r\nwhat he inflicted on others. We can recall one very bright, brilliant\r\nyouth, now high in the Indian civil service, whose drollery when\r\nbullying was irresistible, even to those who knew their turn might\r\ncome next. \"Come here, F----,\" we remember his saying to a fat youth\r\nof reputed uncleanness: then dropping his voice to a tone of subdued\r\nhorror and solemnity, \"I was shocked to hear you use a bad word just\r\nnow.\" \"No indeed, B----,\" protested the trembling F----. \"Ah, well,\r\nI'm certain that you are now thinking it; and, besides, at any rate,\r\nyou look fat and disgusting; so hold down your hands;\" and poor F----\r\nretired howling after a tremendous \"swinger\"--i.e. swinging box on the\r\near.\r\n\r\nThe school was divided into six forms, the sixth being the highest.\r\nBelow the first form were two classes called upper and lower petties.\r\nUp to 1850, classics were the almost exclusive study, but the changes\r\nthen made in the curriculum of studies at Oxford rendered attention to\r\nmathematics absolutely necessary. Much less stress was laid upon Latin\r\nverses at Charter-House than at Eton, and a Latin prose composition\r\nwas regarded as the most important part of scholarship, inasmuch as\r\na certain proficiency in it is a _sine qua non_ at Oxford. French was\r\ntaught twice a week by a master of celebrity, who, however, did not\r\nunderstand the art of dinning learning into unwilling boys. It rarely\r\nhappens in England that boys acquire any real knowledge of French at\r\nschool: those who gain the prizes are almost invariably boys who have\r\nresided abroad and picked up the language in childhood. Music was\r\ntaught by Mr. Hullah, and attendance on the part of gown-boys was\r\ncompulsory. Drawing and fencing were extras.\r\n\r\nVery great importance was attached to the annual examination, which\r\nwas conducted by examiners specially appointed by the governors. The\r\nresult, which was kept a close secret until \"Prize Saturday,\" was as\r\neagerly looked forward to as the Derby by a betting man. The different\r\nforms were divided into classes, as at Oxford, according to merit, and\r\nthe names printed along with the examination papers in pamphlet form.\r\nAfter this examination boys went up to the form above them, each boy\r\nusually remaining a year in each form. The system of punishment was as\r\nfollows. A book called the \"Black Book\" was kept by the school monitor\r\nof the week, there being four gown-boy--that is, foundation--monitors\r\nwho took the duty of school monitor in rotation. A boy put down for\r\nthree offences during the same week was flogged, but the end of each\r\nweek cleared off old scores. The entries were in this wise:\r\n\r\n  _Name of Boy._    _Offence._          _By whom put down._\r\n  Robinson 1        Idle                Dr. Saunders.\r\n  Smith 1, 2        Talking in School   Mr. Curtis.\r\n\r\n\"Go and put your name down,\" a master would say. \"Oh please, sir,\r\nI'm down twice.\" \"Then put it down a third time.\" Then would follow\r\nentreaties, which, unless the delinquent had been previously privately\r\nmarked down for execution, would probably avail. When a flogging\r\noffence was committed a boy was put down thus:\r\n\r\n  Robinson 1, 2, 3   Impertinent        Mr. ----.\r\n\r\nThe flogging varied much in severity according to the crime. The\r\nprocess was precisely the same as at Eton. Partially denuded of his\r\nnether garments, the victim knelt upon the block, the monitor standing\r\nat his head. The birches were kept in a long box which served as a\r\nsettee, and were furnished periodically by the man who brought the\r\nfire fagots. Now and again the box would, by the carelessness of the\r\nfunctionary called \"the school-groom,\" be left open, and it was then\r\nconsidered a point of honor on the part of an under boy to promptly\r\navail himself of the opportunity to \"skin\" the rods--i.e. draw them\r\nthrough a piece of stuff in such a way as to take the buds off, after\r\nwhich they hurt very much less.\r\n\r\nSerious offences, such as insubordination and gross disobedience,\r\nwere punished by a flogging with two birches, which was too severe\r\na punishment. The degree of pain varied very much according to the\r\ndelicacy of skin, and no doubt some boys--one of our comrades had\r\nbeen flogged about twenty-five times--did not feel much after many\r\nfloggings, becoming literally case-hardened; whereas, we have known a\r\nboy compelled to stay in bed two or three days from the effects of a\r\nflogging which would have left little mark upon the \"twenty-fiver.\"\r\nWhen a victim issued from the flogging-room the questions from an\r\neager throng were, \"How many cuts, old fellow? Did it _take_ much? You\r\nhowled like the devil!\"[10]\r\n\r\nThe monitors were furnished with small canes, which they were\r\npermitted to use with moderation, but nothing like the horrible\r\nprocess of \"tunding,\" as at Winchester, was known. The theory of\r\nentrusting this power to monitors is, that if you do not give certain\r\nboys the right to punish, might will be right, whilst the monitors,\r\nbeing duly made to feel their responsibility, will only punish where\r\npunishment is properly due, and will serve as a protection to the\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nThere was a half-holiday every Wednesday and Saturday. Every Saturday\r\nupper boys who had friends might go out from Saturday till Sunday\r\nnight, and lower boys were allowed to do the same every other\r\nSaturday. These events were of course greatly looked forward to\r\nfrom week to week. Not the least agreeable feature was the probable\r\naddition to pocket-money, for in England it is the custom to \"tip\"\r\nschool-boys, and we have ourselves come back joyous on a Sunday\r\nevening with six sovereigns chinking in our pockets. Alas, no one tips\r\nus now! Then there was the delight of comparing notes of the doings\r\nduring the delightful preceding twenty-four hours. Thus, whilst Brown\r\ndetailed the delights of the pantomime to which Uncle John had taken\r\nhim on Saturday night, Robinson descanted on the marvels of the\r\nZoological Gardens, with special reference to the free-and-easy life\r\nof monkeydom, and Smith never wearied of enlarging on the terrors and\r\nglories of the Tower of London. Altogether, there were fourteen weeks'\r\nholiday in the year--six weeks in August, five at Christmas and three\r\nat Whitsuntide, with two days at Easter.\r\n\r\nThere were several beds in each bedroom, and there was a very strict\r\nrule that the most perfect order should prevail--in fact, lower boys\r\nwere forbidden to talk; but talk they always did, and long stories,\r\noften protracted for nights, were told; and for our part, we must\r\nconfess that we have never enjoyed any fictions more than those.\r\n\r\nEvening prayers took place in the several houses at nine, after which\r\nthe lower boys went to bed. A junior master--there was one to each\r\nhouse--always attended at prayers, which were read by a monitor.\r\nBefore prayers names were called over and every boy accounted for.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the midst of brick and mortar, two large spaces,\r\ncontaining several acres, were available for cricket, whilst\r\nfoot-ball--and very fierce games of it, too--was usually played in the\r\ncurious old cloisters of the Chartreuse monks which opened on \"Upper\r\nGreen.\" The grass-plot of Upper Green was kept sacred from the feet\r\nof under boys except in \"cricket quarter,\" as the summer quarter was\r\ntermed. It was rolled, watered and attended to with an assiduity\r\nsuch as befalls few spots of ground in the world. The roof of the\r\ncloisters was a terrace flagged with stone, and on the occasion of\r\ncricket-matches a gay bevy of ladies assembled here to look at the\r\nexploits of the young Rawdon Crawleys and Pendennises of the day.\r\nImmediately opposite the terrace, across the green, on the immensely\r\nhigh blank wall, was the word \"Crown\" rudely painted, and above it\r\nwhat was intended as a representation of that sign of sovereignty.\r\nThis had a history. It was said to have been written there originally\r\nby \"the bold and strong-minded Law,\" commemorated by Macaulay in his\r\nWarren Hastings article, who became Lord Ellenborough, and the last\r\nlord chief-justice who had the honor of a seat in the cabinet. It was\r\nprobably put up originally as a goal for boys running races, and for\r\nnearly a century was regularly repainted as commemorative of a famous\r\nalumnus who was so fondly attached to the place of his early education\r\nthat he desired to be buried in its chapel, and an imposing monument\r\nto his memory may be seen on its walls. Between Upper and Under\r\nGreens, on the slight eminence to which we have alluded, stood\r\n\"School,\" a large ugly edifice of brick mounted with stone, which\r\nderived an interest in the eyes of those educated there from the fact\r\nthat the names of hundreds of old Carthusians were engraven on its\r\nface; for it was the custom of boys leaving school to have their names\r\nbracketed with those of friends; and when Brown took his departure his\r\nname was duly cut, with a space left for Robinson's name when the time\r\nof his departure came.\r\n\r\nThese stones have now exchanged the murky air of London for that of\r\none of the pleasantest sites in Surrey. Charter-House School has,\r\nafter passing two hundred and sixty years in the metropolis, changed\r\nits location, and must be looked for now on a delightful spot near\r\nGodalming in Surrey. The governors very wisely determined about five\r\nyears ago that boys were much better in country than in town, and,\r\nhaving ample funds, took measures accordingly. Last October the new\r\nbuildings were ready for the boys' reception, and they met there for\r\nthe first time. The stones, however, were, with a sentiment most will\r\nappreciate, removed, in order to connect the past with the present,\r\nfor the Charter-House must ever have many tender ties binding it to\r\nthe site of the old monastery with its rich historic memories; and\r\nhowever famous may be the men who go forth from the new ground which\r\nSutton's famous foundation occupies, it must derive a great part of\r\nits fame for a long time to come from the place which sent out into\r\nthe world Addison, Steele, Thirlwall, Grote, Leech and Thackeray, not\r\nto mention a host of names of those who in arms and arts have done\r\ncredit to the place of their education.[11]\r\n\r\nThe home for aged and infirm or disabled men will remain where it has\r\nalways been. This establishment has indeed been a welcome refuge to\r\nthousands who have known better days. Men of all ranks and conditions,\r\nwho have experienced in the afternoon of life contrary winds too\r\npowerful for them to encounter, have here found a haven for the\r\nremnant of their days. Some have held most important positions, and\r\na lord mayor of London, who had received emperors at his table, was\r\na few years ago one of Sutton's \"poor brethren.\" The pensioners were\r\nalways called _cods_ by the boys, probably short for codgers. Each had\r\na room plainly furnished, about one hundred and fifty dollars a year,\r\nrations, and a dinner every day in the great hall. The boys, who did\r\nnot often know their names, gave them nicknames by which they became\r\ngenerally known. Thus three were called \"Battle,\" \"Murder\" and\r\n\"Sudden Death;\" another \"Larky,\" in consequence of a certain levity\r\nof demeanor at divine service. These old gentlemen were expected to\r\nattend chapel daily. Every evening at nine o'clock the chapel bell\r\ntolled the exact number of them, just as Great Tom at Christ Church,\r\nOxford, nightly rings out the number of the students. Being for\r\nthe most part aged men, soured by misfortune and failure, they are\r\nnaturally enough often hard to please and difficult to deal with.\r\n\r\nNo passage in Thackeray's writings is more deeply pathetic than\r\nthat in which he records the last scene of one \"poor brother,\" that\r\nBayard of fiction, Colonel Newcome: \"At the usual evening hour the\r\nchapel-bell began to toll, and Thomas Newcome's hands outside the bed\r\nfeebly beat time. And just as the last bell struck, a peculiar sweet\r\nsmile shone over his face, and he lifted up his head a little, and\r\nquickly said, 'Adsum!' and fell back. It was the word he used at\r\nschool when names, were called; and lo, he whose heart was as that of\r\na little child had answered to his name and stood in the presence of\r\nthe Master.\"\r\n\r\nAN OLD \"GOWN-BOY.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The original seat of the Carthusian order was at\r\nChartreux in Dauphiny, where it was founded by Saint Bruno.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Witham, which is not far from Fonthill, became in 1763\r\nthe property of Alderman Beckford, the millionaire father of the\r\ncelebrated author of _Vathek_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Lord Suffolk probably applied the purchase-money\r\n(thirteen thousand pounds) to help build the palace, called Audley End\r\nor Inn, he raised in Essex.

Abbey-lands are supposed by many to carry ill-luck with them,\r\nand quickly to change hands. Audley End has proved no exception to\r\nthis hypothetical fate. Only a portion of it now remains, but this,\r\nthough much marred by injudicious alterations, is amply sufficient to\r\nshow how grand it was.

He was no more a stranger, however, to\r\nall appearance, for what could be more frank and friendly than their\r\nconversation, or more bright and winning than the smile with which\r\nshe frequently turned to speak or to listen? Of course this stranger\r\ncould not be her friend as Mr. Ingram was--that was impossible. But\r\nhe talked a great deal more than Mr. Ingram, and was apparently more\r\nanxious to please and be pleased; and indeed was altogether very\r\nwinning and courteous and pleasant in his ways. Beyond this vague\r\nimpression, Sheila ventured upon no further comparison between the\r\ntwo men. If her older friend had been down, she would doubtless have\r\npreferred talking to him about all that had happened in the island\r\nsince his last visit; but here was this newer friend thrown, as it\r\nwere, upon her hospitality, and eager, with a most respectful and yet\r\nsimple and friendly interest, to be taught all that Ingram already\r\nknew. Was he not, too, in mere appearance like one of the princes\r\nshe had read of in many an ancient ballad--tall and handsome and\r\nyellow-haired, fit to have come sailing over the sea, with a dozen\r\nmerry comrades, to carry off some sea-king's daughter to be his bride?\r\nSheila began to regret that the young man knew so little about the sea\r\nand the northern islands and those old-time stories; but then he was\r\nvery anxious to learn.\r\n\r\n\"You must say _Mach-Klyoda_ instead of Macleod,\" she was saying\r\nto him, \"if you like _Styornoway_ better than Stornoway. It is the\r\nGaelic, that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is ever so much prettier,\" said young Lavender with a quite\r\ngenuine enthusiasm in his face, not altogether begotten of the letter\r\n_y_; \"and indeed I don't think you can possibly tell how singularly\r\npleasant and quaint it is to an English ear to hear just that little\r\nsoftening of the vowels that the people have here. I suppose you don't\r\nnotice that they say _gyarden_ for garden--\"\r\n\r\n\"They!\" As if he had paid attention to the pronunciation of any one\r\nexcept Sheila herself!\r\n\r\n\"--but not quite so hard as I pronounce it. And so with a great many\r\nother words, that are softened and sweetened, and made almost poetical\r\nin their sound by the least bit of inflection. How surprised and\r\npleased English ladies would be to hear you speak! Oh, I beg your\r\npardon--I did not mean to--I--I beg your pardon--\"\r\n\r\nSheila seemed a little astonished by her companion's evident\r\nmortification, and said with a smile, \"If others speak so in the\r\nisland, of course I must too; and you say it does not shock you.\"\r\n\r\nHis distress at his own rudeness now found an easy vent. He protested\r\nthat no people could talk English like the people of Lewis. He gave\r\nSheila to understand that the speech of English folks was as the\r\ncroaking of ravens compared with the sweet tones of the northern\r\nisles; and this drew him on to speak of his friends in the South and\r\nof London, and of the chances of Sheila ever going thither.\r\n\r\n\"It must be so strange never to have seen London,\" he said. \"Don't you\r\never dream of what it is like? Don't you ever try to think of a great\r\nspace, nearly as big as this island, all covered over with large\r\nhouses, the roads between the houses all made of stone, and great\r\nbridges going over the rivers, with railway-trains standing? By the\r\nway, you have never seen a railway-engine!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment in astonishment, as if he had not\r\nhitherto realized to himself the absolute ignorance of the remote\r\nprincess. Sheila, with some little touch of humor appearing in her\r\ncalm eyes, said, \"But I am not quite ignorant of all these things. I\r\nhave seen pictures of them, and my papa has described them to me so\r\noften that I will feel as if I had seen them all; and I do not think\r\nI should be surprised, except, perhaps, by the noise of the big towns.\r\nIt was many a time my papa told me of that; but he says I cannot\r\nunderstand it, nor the great distance of land you travel over to get\r\nto London. That is what I do not wish to see. I was often thinking of\r\nit, and that to pass so many places that you do not know would make\r\nyou very sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"That can be easily avoided,\" he said lightly. \"When you go to London,\r\nyou must go from Glasgow or Edinburgh in a night-train, and fall fast\r\nasleep, and in the morning you will find yourself in London, without\r\nhaving seen anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as if one had gone across a great distance of sea, and come\r\nto another island you will never see before,\" said Sheila, with the\r\ngray-blue eyes under the black eyelashes grown strange and distant.\r\n\r\n\"But you must not think of it as a melancholy thing,\" he said, almost\r\nanxiously. \"You will find yourself among all sorts of gayeties and\r\namusements; you will have cheerful people around you, and plenty of\r\nthings to see; you will drive in beautiful parks, and go to theatres,\r\nand meet people in large and brilliant rooms, filled with flowers and\r\nsilver and light. And all through the winter, that must be so cold and\r\ndark up here, you will find abundance of warmth and light, and plenty\r\nof flowers, and every sort of pleasant thing. You will hear no more of\r\nthose songs of drowned people; and you will be afraid no longer of the\r\nstorms, or listen to the waves at night; and by and by, when you have\r\ngot quite accustomed to London, and got a great many friends, you\r\nmight be disposed to stay there altogether; and you would grow to\r\nthink of this island as a desolate and melancholy place, and never\r\nseek to come back.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl rose suddenly and turned to a fuchsia tree, pretending to\r\npick some of its flowers. Tears had sprung to her eyes unbidden, and\r\nit was in rather an uncertain voice that she said, still managing to\r\nconceal her face, \"I like to hear you talk of those places, but--but I\r\nwill never leave Borva.\"\r\n\r\nWhat possible interest could he have in combating this decision so\r\nanxiously, almost so imploringly? He renewed his complaints against\r\nthe melancholy of the sea and the dreariness of the northern winters.\r\nHe described again and again the brilliant lights and colors of\r\ntown-life in the South. As a mere matter of experience and education\r\nshe ought to go to London; and had not her papa as good as intimated\r\nhis intention of taking her?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these representations a step was heard in the hall,\r\nand then the girl looked round with a bright light on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sheila?\" said Ingram, according to his custom, and both the\r\ngirl's hands were in his the next minute. \"You are down early. What\r\nhave you been about? Have you been telling Mr. Lavender of the Black\r\nHorse of Loch Suainabhal?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: Mr. Lavender has been telling me of London.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have been trying to induce Miss Mackenzie to pay us a visit,\r\nso that we may show her the difference between a city and an island.\r\nBut all to no purpose. Miss Mackenzie seems to like hard winters and\r\ndarkness and cold; and as for that perpetual and melancholy and cruel\r\nsea, that in the winter-time I should fancy might drive anybody into a\r\nlunatic asylum--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you must not talk badly of the sea,\" said the girl, with all\r\nher courage and brightness returned to her face: \"it is our very good\r\nfriend. It gives us food, and keeps many people alive. It carries the\r\nlads away to other places, and brings them back with money in their\r\npockets--\"\r\n\r\n\"And sometimes it smashes a few of them on the rocks, or swallows up\r\na dozen families, and the next morning it is as smooth and treacherous\r\nand fair as if nothing had happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is not the sea at all,\" said Sheila: \"that is the storms\r\nthat will wreck the boats; and how can the sea help that? When the sea\r\nis let alone the sea is very good to us.\"\r\n\r\nIngram laughed aloud and patted the girl's head fondly; and Lavender,\r\nblushing a little, confessed he was beaten, and that he would never\r\nagain, in Miss Mackenzie's presence, say anything against the sea.\r\n\r\nThe King of Borva now appearing, they all went in to breakfast; and\r\nSheila sat opposite the window, so that all the light coming in from\r\nthe clear sky and the sea was reflected upon her face, and lit up\r\nevery varying expression that crossed it or that shone up in the\r\nbeautiful deeps of her eyes. Lavender, his own face in shadow, could\r\nlook at her from time to time, himself unseen; and as he sat in almost\r\nabsolute silence, and noticed how she talked with Ingram, and what\r\ndeference she paid him, and how anxious she was to please him, he\r\nbegan to wonder if he should ever be admitted to a like friendship\r\nwith her. It was so strange, too, that this handsome, proud-featured,\r\nproud-spirited girl should so devote herself to the amusement of a\r\nman like Ingram, and, forgetting all the court that should have been\r\npaid to a pretty woman, seem determined to persuade him that he\r\nwas conferring a favor upon her by every word and look. Of course,\r\nLavender admitted to himself, Ingram was a very good sort of fellow--a\r\nvery good sort of fellow indeed. If any one was in a scrape about\r\nmoney, Ingram would come to the rescue without a moment's hesitation,\r\nalthough the salary of a clerk in the Board of Trade might have been\r\nmade the excuse, by any other man, for a very justifiable refusal.\r\nHe was very clever too--had read much, and all that kind of thing.\r\nBut he was not the sort of man you might expect to get on well with\r\nwomen. Unless with very intimate friends, he was a trifle silent and\r\nreserved. Often he was inclined to be pragmatic and sententious, and\r\nhad a habit of saying unpleasantly bitter things when some careless\r\njoke was being made. He was a little dingy in appearance; and a\r\nman who had a somewhat cold manner, who was sallow of face, who\r\nwas obviously getting gray, and who was generally insignificant in\r\nappearance, was not the sort of man, one would think, to fascinate\r\nan exceptionally handsome girl, who had brains enough to know the\r\nfineness of her own face. But here was this princess paying attentions\r\nto him such as must have driven a more impressionable man out of his\r\nsenses, while Ingram sat quiet and pleased, sometimes making fun of\r\nher, and generally talking to her as if she were a child. Sheila had\r\nchatted very pleasantly with him, Lavender, in the morning, but it was\r\nevident that her relations with Ingram were of a very different kind,\r\nsuch as he could not well understand. For it was scarcely possible\r\nthat she could be in love with Ingram, and yet surely the pleasure\r\nthat dwelt in her expressive face when she spoke to him or listened to\r\nhim was not the result of a mere friendship.\r\n\r\nIf Lavender had been told at that moment that these two were lovers,\r\nand that they were looking forward to an early marriage, he would\r\nhave rejoiced with an enthusiasm of joy. He would have honestly and\r\ncordially shaken Ingram by the hand; he would have made plans for\r\nintroducing the young bride to all the people he knew; and he would\r\nhave gone straight off, on reaching London, to buy Sheila a diamond\r\nnecklace even if he had to borrow the money from Ingram himself.\r\n\r\n\"And have you got rid yet of the _Airgiod-cearc_[12] Sheila?\" said\r\nIngram, suddenly breaking in upon these dreams; \"or does every owner\r\nof hens still pay his annual shilling to the Lord of Lewis?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not away yet,\" said the girl, \"but when Sir James comes in the\r\nautumn I will go over to Stornoway and ask him to take away the tax;\r\nand I know he will do it, for what is the shilling worth to him, when\r\nhe has spent thousands and thousands of pounds on the Lewis? But it\r\nwill be very hard on some of the poor people that only keep one or two\r\nhens; and I will tell Sir James of all that--\"\r\n\r\n\"You will do nothing of the kind, Sheila,\" said her father\r\nimpatiently. \"What is the _Airgiod-cearc_ to you, that you will go\r\nover to Stornoway only to be laughed at and make a fool of yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is nothing, not anything at all,\" said the girl, \"if Sir James\r\nwill only take away the tax.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Sheila, they would treat you as another Lady Godiva!\" said\r\nIngram, with a good-humored smile.\r\n\r\n\"But Miss Mackenzie is quite right,\" exclaimed Lavender, with a sudden\r\nflush of color leaping into his handsome face and an honest glow of\r\nadmiration into his eyes. \"I think it is a very noble thing for her to\r\ndo, and nobody, either in Stornoway or anywhere else, would be such\r\na brute as to laugh at her for trying to help those poor people, who\r\nhave not too many friends and defenders, God knows!\"\r\n\r\nIngram looked surprised. Since when had the young gentleman across\r\nthe table acquired such a singular interest in the poorer classes, of\r\nwhose very existence he had for the most part seemed unaware? But the\r\nenthusiasm in his face was quite honest: there could be no doubt of\r\nthat. As for Sheila, with a beating heart she ventured to send to her\r\nchampion a brief and timid glance of gratitude, which the young man\r\nobserved, and never forgot.\r\n\r\n\"You will not know what it is all about,\" said the King of Borva\r\nwith a peevish air, as though it were too bad that a person of his\r\nauthority should have to descend to petty details about a hen-tax.\r\n\"It is many and many a tax and a due Sir James will take away from his\r\ntenants in the Lewis, and he will spend more money a thousand times\r\nthan ever he will get back; and it was this _Airgiod-cearc_, it will\r\nstand in the place of a great many other things taken away, just to\r\nremind the folk that they have not their land all in their own right.\r\nIt is many things you will have to do in managing the poor people, not\r\nto let them get too proud, or forgetful of what they owe to you; and\r\nnow there is no more tacksmen to be the masters of the small crofters,\r\nand the crofters they would think they were landlords themselves if\r\nthere were no dues for them to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of those middlemen: they were dreadful tyrants and\r\nthieves, weren't they?\" said Lavender. Ingram kicked his foot under\r\nthe table. \"I mean, that was the popular impression of them--a vulgar\r\nerror, I presume,\" continued the young man in the coolest manner. \"And\r\nso you have got rid of them? Well, I dare say many of them were honest\r\nmen, and suffered very unjustly in common report.\"\r\n\r\nMackenzie answered nothing, but his daughter said quickly, \"But, you\r\nknow, Mr. Lavender, they have not gone away merely because they cease\r\nto have the letting of the land to the crofters. They have still their\r\nold holdings, and so have the crofters in most cases. Every one now\r\nholds direct from the proprietor, that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that there is no difference between the former tacksman and his\r\nserf except the relative size of their farms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the crofters have no leases, but the tacksmen have,\" said the\r\ngirl somewhat timidly; and then she added, \"But you have not decided\r\nyet, Mr. Ingram, what you will do to-day. It is too clear for the\r\nsalmon-fishing. Will you go over to Meavig, and show Mr. Lavender the\r\nBay of Uig and the Seven Hunters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely we must show him Borvabost first, Sheila,\" said Ingram. \"He\r\nsaw nothing of it last night in the dark; and I think, if you offered\r\nto take Mr. Lavender round in your boat and show him what a clever\r\nsailor you are, he would prefer that to walking over the hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can take you all round in the boat, certainly,\" said the girl with\r\na quick blush of pleasure; and forthwith a message was sent to Duncan\r\nthat cushions should be taken down to the Maighdean-mhara, the little\r\nvessel of which Sheila was both skipper and pilot.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful was the fair sea-picture that lay around them as the\r\nMaighdean-mhara stood out to the mouth of Loch Roag on this bright\r\nsummer morning! Sheila sat in the stern of the small boat, her hand\r\non the filler. Lufrath lay at her feet, his nose between the long and\r\nshaggy paws. Duncan, grave and watchful as to the wind and the points\r\nof the coast, sat amidships, with the sheets of the mainsail held\r\nfast, and superintended the seamanship of his young mistress with a\r\nrespectful but most evident pride. And as Ingram had gone off with\r\nMackenzie to walk over to the White Water before going down to\r\nBorvabost, Frank Lavender was Sheila's sole companion out in this\r\nwonderland of rock and sea and blue sky.\r\n\r\nHe did not talk much to her, and she was so well occupied with the\r\nboat that he could regard with impunity the shifting lights and graces\r\nof her face and all the wonder and winning depths of her eyes. The sea\r\nwas blue around them; the sky overhead had not a speck of cloud in it;\r\nthe white sand-bays, the green stretches of pasture and the far and\r\nspectral mountains trembled in a haze of sunlight. Then there was all\r\nthe delight of the fresh and cool wind, the hissing of the water along\r\nthe boat, and the joyous rapidity with which the small vessel, lying\r\nover a little, ran through the crisply curling waters, and brought\r\ninto view the newer wonders of the opening sea.\r\n\r\nWas it not all a dream, that he should be sitting by the side of this\r\nsea-princess, who was attended only by her deerhound and the tall\r\nkeeper? And if a dream, why should it not go on for ever? To live for\r\never in this magic land--to have the princess herself carry him in\r\nthis little boat into the quiet bays of the islands, or out at night,\r\nin moonlight, on the open sea--to forget for ever the godless South\r\nand its social phantasmagoria, and live in this beautiful and distant\r\nsolitude, with the solemn secrets of the hills and the moving deep for\r\never present to the imagination, might not that be a nobler life? And\r\nsome day or other he would take this island-princess up to London,\r\nand he would bid the women that he knew--the scheming mothers and the\r\ndoll-like daughters--stand aside from before this perfect work of God.\r\nShe would carry with her the mystery of the sea in the deeps of her\r\neyes, and the music of the far hills would be heard in her voice, and\r\nall the sweetness and purity and brightness of the clear summer skies\r\nwould be mirrored in her innocent soul. She would appear in London as\r\nsome wild-plumaged bird hailing from distant climes, and before she\r\nhad lived there long enough to grow sad, and have the weight of the\r\ncity clouding the brightness of her eyes, she would be spirited\r\naway again into this strange sea-kingdom, where there seemed to be\r\nperpetual sunshine and the light music of the waves.\r\n\r\nPoor Sheila! She little knew what was expected of her, or the sort of\r\ndrama into which she was being thrown as a central figure. She little\r\nknew that she, a simple Highland girl, was being transformed into\r\na wonderful creature of romance, who was to put to shame the gentle\r\ndames and maidens of London society, and do many other extraordinary\r\nthings. But what would have appeared the most extraordinary of all\r\nthese speculations, if she had only known of them, was the assumption\r\nthat she would marry Frank Lavender. _That_ the young man had quite\r\nnaturally taken for granted, but perhaps only as a basis for his\r\nimaginative scenes. In order to do these fine things she would have\r\nto be married to somebody, and why not to himself? Think of the pride\r\nhe would have in leading this beautiful girl, with her quaint manners\r\nand fashion of speech, into a London drawing-room! Would not every\r\none wish to know her? Would not every one listen to her singing of\r\nthose Gaelic songs? for of course she must sing well. Would not all\r\nhis artist friends be anxious to paint her? and she would go to the\r\nAcademy to convince the loungers there how utterly the canvas had\r\nfailed to catch the light and dignity and sweetness of her face.\r\n\r\nWhen Sheila spoke he started.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"The seal: it rose for a moment just over there,\" said the girl, with\r\na great interest visible in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful dreams he had been dreaming were considerably shattered\r\nby this interruption. How could a fairy princess be so interested in\r\nsome common animal showing its head out of the sea? It also occurred\r\nto him, just at this moment, that if Sheila and Mairi went out in\r\nthis boat by themselves, they must be in the habit of hoisting up the\r\nmainsail; and was such rude and coarse work befitting the character of\r\na princess?\r\n\r\n\"He looks very like a black man in the water when his head comes up,\"\r\nsaid Sheila--\"when the water is smooth so that you will see him\r\nlook at you. But I have not told you yet about the Black Horse that\r\nAlister-nan-Each saw at Loch Suainabhal one night. Loch Suainabhal,\r\nthat is inland and fresh water, so it was not a seal; but Alister\r\nwas going along the shore, and he saw it lying up by the road, and he\r\nlooked at it for a long time. It was quite black, and he thought it\r\nwas a boat; but when he came near he saw it begin to move, and then\r\nit went down across the shore and splashed into the loch. And it had\r\na head bigger than a horse, and quite black, and it made a noise as it\r\nwent down the shore to the loch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think Alister must have been taking a little whisky, Miss\r\nMackenzie?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not that, for he came to me just after he will see the beast.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you really believe he saw such an animal?\" said Lavender with\r\na smile.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" said the girl gravely. \"Perhaps it was only a fright,\r\nand he imagined he saw it; but I do not know it is impossible there\r\ncan be such an animal at Loch Suainabhal. But that is nothing: it\r\nis of no consequence. But I have seen stranger things than the Black\r\nHorse, that many people will not believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask what they are?\" he said gently.\r\n\r\n\"Some other time, perhaps, I will tell you; but there is much\r\nexplanation about it, and, you see, we are going in to Borvabost.\"\r\n\r\nWas this, then, the capital of the small empire over which the\r\nprincess ruled? He saw before him but a long row of small huts or\r\nhovels resembling bee-hives, which stood above the curve of a white\r\nbay, and at one portion of the bay was a small creek, near which\r\na number of large boats, bottom upward, lay on the beach. What odd\r\nlittle dwellings those were! The walls, a few feet high, were built\r\nof rude blocks of stone or slices of turf, and from those low supports\r\nrose a rounded roof of straw, which was thatched over by a further\r\nlayer of turf. There were few windows, and no chimneys at all--not\r\neven a hole in the roof. And what was meant by the two men who,\r\nstanding on one of the turf walls, were busily engaged in digging into\r\nthe rich brown and black thatch and heaving it into a cart? Sheila had\r\nto explain to him that while she was doing everything in her power to\r\nget the people to suffer the introduction of windows, it was hopeless\r\nto think of chimneys; for by carefully guarding against the egress of\r\nthe peat-smoke, it slowly saturated the thatch of the roof, which at\r\ncertain periods of the year was then taken off to dress the fields,\r\nand a new roof of straw put on.\r\n\r\nBy this time they had run the Maighdean-mhara--the \"Sea Maiden\"--into\r\na creek, and were climbing up the steep beach of shingle that had been\r\nworn smooth by the unquiet waters of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\"And will you want to speak to me, Ailasa?\" said Sheila, turning to a\r\nsmall girl who had approached her somewhat diffidently.\r\n\r\nShe was a pretty little thing, with a round fair face tanned by the\r\nsun, brown hair and soft dark eyes. She was bare-headed, bare-footed\r\nand bare-armed, but she was otherwise smartly dressed, and she held\r\nin her hand an enormous flounder, apparently about half as heavy as\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\"Will ye hef the fesh, Miss Sheila?\" said the small Ailasa, holding\r\nout the flounder, but looking down all the same.\r\n\r\n\"Did you catch it yourself, Ailasa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it wass Donald and me: we wass out in a boat, and Donald had a\r\nline.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is a present for me?\" said Sheila, patting the small head and\r\nits wild and soft hair. \"Thank you, Ailasa. But you must ask Donald to\r\ncarry it up to the house and give it to Mairi. I cannot take it with\r\nme just now, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a small boy cowering behind one of the upturned boats, and\r\nby his furtive peepings showing that he was in league with his sister.\r\nAilasa, not thinking that she was discovering his whereabouts, turned\r\nquite naturally in that direction, until she was suddenly stopped by\r\nLavender, who called to her and put his hand in his pocket. But he was\r\ntoo late. Sheila had stepped in, and with a quick look, which was all\r\nthe protest that was needed, shut her hand over the half crown he had\r\nin his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Ailasa,\" she said. \"Go away and get Donald, and bid him\r\ncarry the fish up to Mairi.\"\r\n\r\nLavender put up the half crown in his pocket in a somewhat dazed\r\nfashion: what he chiefly knew was that Sheila had for a moment held\r\nhis hand in hers and that her eyes had met his.\r\n\r\nWell, that little incident of Ailasa and the flounder was rather\r\npleasant to him. It did not shock the romantic associations he had\r\nbegun to weave around his fair companion. But when they had gone up\r\nto the cottages--Mackenzie and Ingram not yet having arrived--and\r\nwhen Sheila proceeded to tell him about the circumstances of the\r\nfishermen's lives, and to explain how such and such things were done\r\nin the fields and in the pickling-houses, and so forth, Lavender was\r\na little disappointed. Sheila took him into some of the cottages, or\r\nrather hovels, and he vaguely knew in the darkness that she sat down\r\nby the low glow of the peat-fire, and began to ask the women about all\r\nsorts of improvements in the walls and windows and gardens, and what\r\nnot. Surely it was not for a princess to go advising people about\r\nparticular sorts of soap, or offering to pay for a pane of glass if\r\nthe husband of the woman would make the necessary aperture in the\r\nstone wall. The picture of Sheila appearing as a sea-princess in a\r\nLondon drawing-room was all very beautiful in its way, but here she\r\nwas discussing as to the quality given to broth by the addition of a\r\ncertain vegetable which she offered to send down from her own garden\r\nif the cottager in question would try to grow it.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder, Miss Mackenzie,\" he said at length, when they got outside,\r\nhis eyes dazed with the light and smarting with the peat-smoke--\"I\r\nwonder you can trouble yourself with such little matters that those\r\npeople should find out for themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up with some surprise: \"That is the work I have to do.\r\nMy papa cannot do everything in the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the necessity for your bothering yourself about such\r\nthings? Surely they ought to be able to look after their own gardens\r\nand houses. It is no degradation--certainly not, for anything you\r\ninterested yourself in would become worthy of attention by the very\r\nfact--but, after all, it seems such a pity you should give up your\r\ntime to these commonplace details.\"\r\n\r\n\"But some one must do it,\" said the girl quite innocently, \"and my\r\npapa has no time. And they will be very good in doing what I ask\r\nthem--every one in the island.\"\r\n\r\nWas this a willful affectation? he said to himself. Or was she really\r\nincapable of understanding that there was anything incongruous in a\r\nyoung lady of her position, education and refinement busying herself\r\nwith the curing of fish and the cost of lime? He had himself marked\r\nthe incongruity long ago, when Ingram had been telling him of the\r\nremote and beautiful maiden whose only notions of the world had been\r\nderived from literature--who was more familiar with the magic land\r\nin which Endymion wandered than with any other--and that at the same\r\ntime she was about as good as her father at planning a wooden bridge\r\nover a stream. When Lavender had got outside again--when he found\r\nhimself walking with her along the white beach in front of the blue\r\nAtlantic--she was again the princess of his dreams. He looked at her\r\nface, and he saw in her eyes that she must be familiar with all the\r\nromantic nooks and glades of English poetry. The plashing of the waves\r\ndown there and the music of her voice recalled the sad legends of the\r\nfishermen he hoped to hear her sing. But ever and anon there occurred\r\na jarring recollection--whether arising from a contradiction between\r\nhis notion of Sheila and the actual Sheila, or whether from some\r\nincongruity in himself, he did not stop to consider. He only knew that\r\na beautiful maiden who had lived by the sea all her life, and who had\r\nfollowed the wanderings of Endymion in the enchanted forest, need not\r\nhave been so particular about a method of boiling potatoes, or have\r\nshown so much interest in a pattern for children's frocks.\r\n\r\nMackenzie and Ingram met them. There was the usual \"Well, Sheila?\"\r\nfollowed by a thousand questions about the very things she had been\r\ninquiring into. That was one of the odd points about Ingram that\r\npuzzled and sometimes vexed Lavender; for if you are walking home at\r\nnight it is inconvenient to be accompanied by a friend who would stop\r\nto ask about the circumstances of some old crone hobbling along the\r\npavement, or who could, on his own doorstep, stop to have a chat with\r\na garrulous policeman. Ingram was about as odd as Sheila herself in\r\nthe attention he paid to those wretched cotters and their doings.\r\nHe could not advise on the important subject of broth, but he would\r\nhave tasted it by way of discovery, even if it had been presented to\r\nhim in a tea-cup. He had already been prowling round the place with\r\nMackenzie. He had inspected the apparatus in the creek for hauling up\r\nthe boats. He had visited the curing-houses. He had examined the heaps\r\nof fish drying on the beach. He had drunk whisky with John the Piper\r\nand shaken hands with Alister-nan-Each. And now he had come to tell\r\nSheila that the piper was bringing down luncheon from Mackenzie's\r\nhouse, and that after they had eaten and drunk on the white beach they\r\nwould put out the Maighdean-mhara once more to sea, and sail over to\r\nMevaig, that the stranger might see the wondrous sands of the Bay of\r\nUig.\r\n\r\nBut it was not in consonance with the dignity of a king that his\r\nguests should eat from off the pebbles, like so many fishermen, and\r\nwhen Mairi and another girl brought down the baskets, luncheon was\r\nplaced in the stern of the small vessel, while Duncan got up the\r\nsails and put out from the stone quay. As for John the Piper, was he\r\ninsulted at having been sent on a menial errand? They had scarcely got\r\naway from the shore when the sounds of the pipes was wafted to them\r\nfrom the hillside above, and it was the \"Lament of Mackrimmon\" that\r\nfollowed them out to sea:\r\n\r\n  Mackrimmon shall no more return,\r\n  Oh never, never more return!\r\n\r\nThat was the wild and ominous air that was skirling up on the\r\nhillside; and Mackenzie's face, as he heard it, grew wroth. \"That\r\nteffle of a piper John!\" he said with an involuntary stamp of his\r\nfoot. \"What for will he be playing _Cha till mi tuilich?_\"\r\n\r\n\"It is out of mischief, papa,\" said Sheila--\"that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be more than mischief if I burn his pipes and drive him out\r\nof Borva. Then there will be no more of mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very bad of John to do that,\" said Sheila to Lavender,\r\napparently in explanation of her father's anger, \"for we have given\r\nhim shelter here when there will be no more pipes in all the Lewis.\r\nIt wass the Free Church ministers, they put down the pipes, for there\r\nwass too much wildness at the marriages when the pipes would play.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do the people dance to now?\" asked the young gentleman, who\r\nseemed to resent this piece of paternal government.\r\n\r\nSheila laughed in an embarrassed way.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Mackenzie would rather not tell you,\" said Ingram. \"The fact is,\r\nthe noble mountaineers of these districts have had to fall back on the\r\nJew's harp. The ministers allow that instrument to be used--I suppose\r\nbecause there is a look of piety in the name. But the dancing doesn't\r\nget very mad when you have two or three young fellows playing a\r\nstrathspey on a bit of trembling wire.\"\r\n\r\n\"That teffle of a piper John!\" growled Mackenzie under his breath;\r\nand so the Maighdean-mhara lightly sped on her way, opening out the\r\nvarious headlands of the islands, until at last she got into the\r\nnarrows by Eilean-Aird-Meinish, and ran up the long arm of the sea\r\nto Mevaig.\r\n\r\nThey landed and went up the rocks. They passed two or three small\r\nwhite houses overlooking the still, green waters of the sea, and then,\r\nfollowing the line of a river, plunged into the heart of a strange\r\nand lonely district, in which there appeared to be no life. The\r\nriver-track took them up a great glen, the sides of which were about\r\nas sheer as a railway-cutting. There were no trees or bushes about,\r\nbut the green pasture along the bed of the valley wore its brightest\r\ncolors in the warm sunlight, and far up on the hillsides the browns\r\nand crimsons of the heather and the silver-gray of the rocks trembled\r\nin the white haze of the heat. Over that again the blue sky, as still\r\nand silent as the world below.\r\n\r\nThey wandered on, content with idleness and a fine day. Mr. Mackenzie\r\nwas talking with some little loudness, so that Lavender might hear,\r\nof Mr. John Stuart Mill, and was anxious to convey to Ted Ingram\r\nthat a wise man, who is responsible for the well-being of his\r\nfellow-creatures, will study all sides of all questions, however\r\ndangerous. Sheila was doing her best to entertain the stranger, and\r\nhe, in a dream of his own, was listening to the information she gave\r\nhim. How much of it did he carry away? He was told that the gray goose\r\nbuilt its nest in the rushes at the edge of lakes: Sheila knew several\r\nnests in Borva. Sheila also caught the young of the wild-duck when\r\nthe mother was guiding them down the hill-rivulets to the sea. She\r\nhad tamed many of them, catching them thus before they could fly. The\r\nnames of most of the mountains about here ended in _bhal_, which was\r\na Gaelic corruption of the Norse _fiall_, a mountain. There were many\r\nNorse names all through the Lewis, but more particularly toward the\r\nButt. The termination _bost_, for example, at the end of many words,\r\nmeant an inhabited place, but she fancied _bost_ was Danish. And did\r\nMr. Lavender know of the legend connected with the air of _Cha till,\r\ncha till mi tuille_?\r\n\r\nLavender started as from a trance, with an impression that he had\r\nbeen desperately rude. He was about to say that the gray gosling in\r\nthe legend could not speak Scandinavian, when he was interrupted by\r\nMr. Mackenzie turning and asking him if he knew from what ports the\r\nEnglish smacks hailed that came up hither to the cod and the ling\r\nfishing for a couple of months in the autumn. The young man said he\r\ndid not know. There were many fishermen at Brighton. And when the King\r\nof Borva turned to Ingram, to see why he was shouting with laughter,\r\nSheila suddenly announced to the party that before them lay the great\r\nBay of Uig.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a strange and impressive scene. They stood on the top\r\nof a lofty range of hill, and, underneath them lay a vast semicircle,\r\nmiles in extent, of gleaming white sand, that had in bygone ages been\r\nwashed in by the Atlantic. Into this vast plain of silver whiteness\r\nthe sea, entering by a somewhat narrow portal, stretched in long arms\r\nof a pale blue. Elsewhere, the great crescent of sand was surrounded\r\nby a low line of rocky hill, showing a thousand tints of olive-green\r\nand gray and heather-purple; and beyond that again rose the giant bulk\r\nof Mealasabhal, grown pale in the heat, into the southern sky. There\r\nwas not a ship visible along the blue plain of the Atlantic. The only\r\nhuman habitation to be seen in the strange world beneath them was a\r\nsolitary manse. But away toward the summit of Mealasabhal two specks\r\nslowly circled in the air, which Sheila thought were eagles; and far\r\nout on the western sea, lying like dusky whales in the vague blue,\r\nwere the Pladda Islands--the remote and unvisited Seven Hunters--whose\r\nonly inhabitants are certain flocks of sheep belonging to dwellers on\r\nthe mainland of Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe travelers sat down on a low block of gneiss to rest themselves,\r\nand then and there did the King of Borva recite his grievances and\r\nrage against the English smacks. Was it not enough that they should\r\nin passing steal the sheep, but that they should also, in mere\r\nwantonness, stalk them as deer, wounding them with rifle-bullets, and\r\nleaving them to die among the rocks? Sheila said bravely that no one\r\ncould tell that it was the English fishermen who did that. Why not the\r\ncrews of merchant-vessels, who might be of any nation? It was unfair\r\nto charge upon any body of men such a despicable act, when there was\r\nno proof of it whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Sheila,\" said Ingram with some surprise, \"you never doubted\r\nbefore that it was the English smacks that killed the sheep.\"\r\n\r\nSheila cast down her eyes and said nothing.\r\n\r\nWas the sinister prophecy of John the Piper to be fulfilled? Mackenzie\r\nwas so much engaged in expounding politics to Ingram, and Sheila was\r\nso proud to show her companion all the wonders of Uig, that when they\r\nreturned to Mevaig in the evening the wind had altogether gone down\r\nand the sea was as a sea of glass. But if John the Piper had been\r\nready to foretell for Mackenzie the fate of Mackrimmon, he had taken\r\nmeans to defeat destiny by bringing over from Borvabost a large\r\nand heavy boat pulled by six rowers. These were not strapping young\r\nfellows, clad in the best blue cloth to be got in Stornoway, but\r\nelderly men, gray, wrinkled, weather-beaten and hard of face, who sat\r\nstolidly in the boat and listened with a sort of bovine gaze to the\r\nold hunchback's wicked stories and jokes. John was in a mischievous\r\nmood, but Lavender, in a confidential whisper, informed Sheila that\r\nher father would speedily be avenged on the inconsiderate piper.\r\n\r\n\"Come, men, sing us a song, quick!\" said Mackenzie as the party took\r\ntheir seats in the stern and the great oars splashed into the sea of\r\ngold. \"Look sharp, John, and no teffle of a drowning song!\"\r\n\r\nIn a shrill, high, querulous voice the piper, who was himself pulling\r\none of the two stroke oars, began to sing, and then the men behind\r\nhim, gathering courage, joined in an octave lower, their voices being\r\neven more uncertain and lugubrious than his own. These poor fishermen\r\nhad not had the musical education of Clan-Alpine's warriors. The\r\nperformance was not enlivening, and as the monotonous and melancholy\r\nsing-song that kept time to the oars told its story in Gaelic, all\r\nthat the English strangers could make out was an occasional reference\r\nto Jura or Scarba or Isla. It was, indeed, the song of an exile shut\r\nup in \"sea-worn Mull,\" who was complaining of the wearisome look of\r\nthe neighboring islands.\r\n\r\n\"But why do you sing such Gaelic as that, John?\" said young Lavender\r\nconfidently. \"I should have thought a man in your position--the last\r\nof the Hebridean bards--would have known the classical Gaelic. Don't\r\nyou know the classical Gaelic?\"\r\n\r\n\"There iss only the wan sort of Kâllic, and it is a ferry goot sort of\r\nKâllic,\" said the piper with some show of petulance.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to tell me you don't know your own tongue? Do you\r\nnot know what the greatest of all the bards wrote about your own\r\nisland?--'O et præsidium et dulce decus meum, _agus_, Tityre tu patulæ\r\nrecubans sub tegmine _Styornoway_, Arma virumque cano, _Macklyoda_ et\r\n_Borvabost_ sub tegmine fagi?'\"\r\n\r\nNot only John the Piper, but all the men behind him, began to look\r\namazed and sorely troubled; and all the more so that Ingram--who had\r\npicked up more Gaelic words than his friend--came to his assistance,\r\nand began to talk to him in this unknown tongue. They heard references\r\nin the conversation to persons and things with which they were\r\nfamiliar in their own language, but still accompanied by much more\r\nthey could not understand.\r\n\r\nThe men now began to whisper awe-stricken questions to each other; and\r\nat last John the Piper could not restrain his curiosity. \"What in ta\r\nname of Kott is tat sort of Kâllic?\" he asked, with some look of fear\r\nin his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You are not much of a student, John,\" said Lavender carelessly,\r\n\"but still, a man in your position should know something of your own\r\nlanguage. A bard, a poet, and not know the classical form of your own\r\ntongue!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it, ta Welsh Kâllic?\" cried John in desperation, for he knew that\r\nthe men behind him would carry the story of his ignorance all over\r\nBorvabost.\r\n\r\n\"The Welsh Gaelic? No. I see you will have to go to school again.\"\r\n\r\n\"There iss no more Kâllic in ta schools,\" said the piper, eagerly\r\nseizing the excuse. \"It iss Miss Sheila, she will hef put away all ta\r\nKâllic from ta schools.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you were born half a century before Miss Sheila: how is it you\r\nneglected to learn that form of Gaelic that has been sacred to the use\r\nof the bards and poets since the time of Ossian?\"\r\n\r\nThere were no more quips or cranks for John the Piper during the rest\r\nof the pull home. The wretched man relapsed into a moody silence\r\nand worked mechanically at his oar, brooding over this mysterious\r\nlanguage of which he had not even heard. As for Lavender, he turned to\r\nMackenzie and begged to know what he thought of affairs in France.\r\n\r\nAnd so they sailed back to Borvabost over the smooth water that lay\r\nlike a lake of gold. Was it not a strange sight to see the Atlantic\r\none vast and smooth yellow plain under the great glow of saffron that\r\nspread across the regions of the sunset? It was a world of light,\r\nunbroken but by the presence of a heavy coaster that had anchored\r\nin the bay, and that sent a long line of trembling black down on the\r\nperfect mirror of the sea. As they got near the shore the portions\r\nthat were in shadow showed with a strange distinctness the dark green\r\nof the pasture and the sharp outlines of the rocks; and there was a\r\ncold scent of seaweed in the evening air. The six heavy oars plashed\r\ninto the smooth bay. The big boat was moored to the quay, and its\r\npassengers landed once more in Borva. And when they turned, on their\r\nway home, to look from the brow of the hill, on which Sheila had\r\nplaced a garden-seat, lo! all the west was on fire, the mountains in\r\nthe south had grown dark on their eastern side, and the plain of the\r\nsea was like a lake of blood, with the heavy hull and masts of the\r\ncoaster grown large and solemn and distant. There was scarcely a\r\nripple around the rocks at their feet to break the stillness of the\r\napproaching twilight.\r\n\r\nSo another day had passed, devoid of adventure or incident. Lavender\r\nhad not rescued his wonderful princess from an angry sea, nor had he\r\nshown prowess in slaying a dozen stags, nor in any way distinguished\r\nhimself. To all outward appearance the relations of the party were the\r\nsame at night as they had been in the morning. But the greatest crises\r\nof life steal on us imperceptibly, and have sometimes occurred and\r\nwound us in their consequences before we know. The memorable things\r\nin a man's career are not always marked by some sharp convulsion. The\r\nyouth does not necessarily marry the girl whom he happens to fish out\r\nof a mill-pond: his future life may be far more definitely shaped for\r\nhim at a prosaic dinner-table, where he fancies he is only thinking\r\nof the wines. We are indeed but as children seated on the shore,\r\nwatching the ripples that come on to our feet; and while the ripples\r\nunceasingly repeat themselves, and while the hour that passes is but\r\nas the hour before it, constellation after constellation has gone by\r\nover our heads unheeded and unseen, and we awake with a start to find\r\nourselves in a new day, with all our former life cut off from us and\r\nbecome as a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSHEILA SINGS.\r\n\r\nA knocking at Ingram's door.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will ye be goin' to ta fishin', Mr. Ingram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Duncan? How the devil have you got over from Mevaig at\r\nthis hour of the morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there wass a bit breeze tis morning, and I hef prought over ta\r\nMaighdean-mhara. And there iss a very goot ripple on ta watter, if you\r\nwill tek ta other gentleman to try for ta salmon.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right! Hammer at his door until he gets up. I shall be ready in\r\nten minutes.\"\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour thereafter the two young men were standing at the\r\nfront of Mackenzie's house, examining the enormous rod that Duncan had\r\nplaced against the porch. It was still early morning, and there was a\r\ncold wind blowing in from the sea, but there was not a speck of cloud\r\nin the sky, and the day promised to be hot. The plain of the Atlantic\r\nwas no longer a sheet of glass: it was rough and gray, and far out an\r\noccasional quiver of white showed where a wave was hissing over. There\r\nwas not much of a sea on, but the heavy wash of the water round the\r\nrocks and sandy bays could be distinctly heard in the silence of the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nAnd what was this moving object down there by the shore where the\r\nMaighdean-mhara lay at anchor? Both the young men at once recognized\r\nthe glimmer of the small white feather and the tightly-fitting blue\r\ndress of the sea-princess.\r\n\r\n\"Why, there is Sheila!\" cried Ingram. \"What in all the world is she\r\nabout at such an hour?\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Duncan came out with a book of flies in his hand, and\r\nhe said in rather a petulant way, \"And it iss no wonder Miss Sheila\r\nwill be out. And it wass Miss Sheila herself will tell me to see if\r\nyou will go to ta White Water and try for a salmon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she is bringing up something from the boat: I must go and carry\r\nit for her,\" said Lavender, making down the path to the shore with the\r\nspeed of a deer.\r\n\r\nWhen Sheila and he came up the hill there was a fine color in the\r\ngirl's face from her morning's exertions, but she was not disposed to\r\ngo indoors to rest. On the contrary, she was soon engaged in helping\r\nMairi to bring in some coffee to the parlor, while Duncan cut slices\r\nof ham and cold beef big enough to have provisioned a fishing-boat\r\nbound for Caithness. Sheila had had her breakfast; so she devoted all\r\nher time to waiting upon her two guests, until Lavender could scarcely\r\neat through the embarrassment produced by her noble servitude. Ingram\r\nwas not so sensitive, and made a very good meal indeed.\r\n\r\n\"Where's your father, Sheila?\" said Ingram when the last of their\r\npreparations had been made and they were about to start for the river,\r\n\"Isn't he up yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father?\" said the girl, with the least possible elevation of her\r\neyebrows--\"he will be down at Borvabost an hour ago. And I hope that\r\nJohn the Piper will not see him this morning. But we must make haste,\r\nMr. Ingram, for the wind will fall when the sun gets stronger, and\r\nthen your friend will have no more of the fishing.\"\r\n\r\nSo they set out, and Ingram put Sheila's hand on his arm, and took her\r\nalong with him in that fashion, while the tall gillie walked behind\r\nwith Lavender, who was or was not pleased with the arrangement. The\r\nyoung man, indeed, was a trifle silent, but Duncan was in an amiable\r\nand communicative mood, and passed the time in telling him stories\r\nof the salmon he had caught, and of the people who had tried to catch\r\nthem and failed. Sheila and Ingram certainly went a good pace up the\r\nhill and round the summit of it, and down again into the valley of the\r\nWhite Water. The light step of the girl seemed to be as full of spring\r\nas the heather on which she trod; and as for her feet getting wet,\r\nthe dew must have soaked them long ago. She was in the brightest of\r\nspirits. Lavender could hear her laughing in a low pleased fashion,\r\nand then presently her head would be turned up toward her companion,\r\nand all the light of some humorous anecdote would appear in her face\r\nand in her eloquent eyes, and it would be Ingram's turn to break out\r\ninto one of those short abrupt laughs that had something sardonic in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut hark! From the other side of the valley comes another sound, the\r\nfaint and distant skirl of the pipes, and yonder is the white-haired\r\nhunchback, a mere speck in a waste of brown and green morass. What is\r\nhe playing to himself now?\r\n\r\n\"He is a foolish fellow, that John,\" said the tall keeper, \"for if\r\nhe comes down to Borvabost this morning it iss Mr. Mackenzie will\r\nfling his pipes in ta sea, and he will hef to go away and work in ta\r\nsteamboat. He iss a ferry foolish fellow; and it wass him tat wass\r\ngoin' into ta steamboat before, and he went to a tailor in Styornoway,\r\nand he said to him, 'I want a pair o' troosers.' And the tailor said\r\nto him, 'What sort o' troosers iss it you will want?' And he said to\r\nhim, 'I want a pair o' troosers for a steamboat.' A pair o' troosers\r\nfor a steamboat!--he is a teffle of a foolish fellow. And it wass him\r\nthat went in ta steamboat with a lot o' freens o' his, that wass a'\r\ngoin' to Skye to a big weddin' there; and it wass a very bad passage,\r\nand when tey got into Portree the captain said to him, 'John, where\r\niss all your freens that tey do not come ashore?' And he said to him,\r\n'I hef peen down below, sir, and four-thirds o' ta whole o' them are\r\na' half-trooned and sick and tead.' Four-thirds o' ta whole o' them!\r\nAnd he iss just the ferry man to laugh at every other pody when it iss\r\na mistake you will make in ta English.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Lavender, \"you found it rather difficult to learn\r\ngood English?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I hefna got ta goot English yet. But Miss Sheila she has\r\nput away all the Gaelic from the schools, and the young ones they will\r\nlearn more of ta good English after that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I knew as much Gaelic as you know English,\" said the young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you will soon learn. It iss very easy if you will only stay in ta\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would take me several months to pick it up, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--nine or six--that will do,\" said Duncan. \"You will begin to\r\nlearn ta names o' ta islands and ta places. There now, as far as you\r\ncan see is ta Seann Bheinn; and it means ta old hill. And there is a\r\nrock there: it is Stac-nan Balg--\"\r\n\r\nHere Duncan looked rather perplexed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lavender: \"what does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means--it means,\" said Duncan in still greater perplexity, and\r\ngetting a little impatient, \"it means--_stac_, tat iss a steep rock:\r\nStac-nan-Balg--it means--well, sir, _it is ower deep for ta English_\"\r\n\r\nThe tone of mortification in which Duncan uttered these words warned\r\nLavender that his philological studies might as well cease; and indeed\r\nSheila and Ingram had by this time reached the banks of the White\r\nWater, and were waiting Duncan and the majestic rod.\r\n\r\nIt was much too bright and pleasant a morning for good fishing, but\r\nthere was a fair ripple on the pools of the stream, where ever and\r\nanon a salmon fresh run from the sea would leap into the air, showing\r\na gleaming curve of silver to the sunlight. The splash of the big\r\nfish seemed an invitation, and Duncan was all anxiety to teach the\r\nstranger, who, as he fancied, knew nothing about throwing a fly.\r\nIngram lay down on a rock some little distance back from the banks,\r\nand put his hands beneath his head and watched the operations going\r\nforward. But was it really Duncan who was to teach the stranger? It\r\nwas Sheila who picked out flies for him. It was Sheila who held the\r\nrod while he put them on the line. It was Sheila who told him where\r\nthe bigger salmon usually lay--under the opposite bank of the broad\r\nand almost lake-like pool into which the small but rapid White Water\r\ncame tumbling and foaming down its narrow channel of rocks and stones.\r\n\r\nThen Sheila waited to see her pupil begin. He had evidently a little\r\ndifficulty about the big double-handed rod, a somewhat more formidable\r\nengine of destruction than the supple little thing with which he had\r\nwhipped the streams of Devonshire and Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe first cast sent both flies and a lump of line tumbling on to the\r\npool, and would have driven the boldest of salmon out of its wits. The\r\nsecond pretty nearly took a piece out of Ingram's ear, and made him\r\nshift his quarters with rapidity. Duncan gave him up in despair. The\r\nthird cast dropped both flies with the lightness of a feather in the\r\nrunning waters of the other side of the pool; and the next second\r\nthere was a slight wave along the surface, a dexterous jerk with the\r\nbutt, and presently the line was whirled out into the middle of the\r\npool, running rapidly off the reel from the straining rod.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty o' line, sir, plenty o' line!\" shouted Duncan in a wild fever\r\nof anxiety, for the fish had plunged suddenly.\r\n\r\nIngram had come running down to the bank. Sheila was all excitement\r\nand interest as she stood and watched every slackening or tightening\r\nof the line as the fish went up the pool and down the pool, and\r\ncrossed the current in his efforts to escape. The only self-possessed\r\nperson, indeed, was Lavender himself, who presently said, \"Miss\r\nMackenzie, won't you take the rod now and have the honor of landing\r\nhim? I don't think he will show much more fight.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, the line slackened suddenly, and the fish\r\nthrew himself clean out of the water, turning a complete summersault.\r\nIt was a dangerous moment, but the captive was well hooked, and in his\r\nnext plunge Lavender was admonished by Duncan to keep a good strain on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"I will take the second one,\" Sheila promised, \"if you like; but you\r\nmust surely land your first salmon yourself.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose nobody but a fisherman can understand the generosity of the\r\noffer made by the young man. To have hooked your first salmon--to have\r\nits first wild rushes and plunges safely over--and to offer to another\r\nthe delight of bringing him victoriously to bank! But Sheila knew. And\r\nwhat could have surpassed the cleverness with which he had hooked the\r\nfish, and the coolness and courage he showed throughout the playing of\r\nhim, except this more than royal offer on the part of the young hero?\r\n\r\nThe fish was losing strength. All the line had been got in, although\r\nthe fore finger of the fisherman felt the pulse of his captive, as it\r\nwere, ready for any expiring plunge. They caught occasional glimpses\r\nof a large white body gliding through the ruddy-brown water. Duncan\r\nwas down on his knees more than once, with the landing-net in his\r\nhand, but again and again the big fish would sheer off, with just\r\nsuch indications of power as to make his conqueror cautious. At length\r\nhe was guided slowly in to the bank. Behind him the landing-net\r\nwas gently let into the water--then a quick forward movement, and a\r\nfourteen-pounder was scooped up and flung upon the bank, landing-net\r\nand all. \"Hurrah!\" cried Ingram, and Lavender blushed like a\r\nschool-girl; and Sheila, quite naturally and without thinking, shook\r\nhands with him and said, \"I congratulate you;\" and there was more\r\ncongratulation in her glad eyes than in that simple little gesture.\r\n\r\nIt was a good beginning, and of course the young man was very much\r\npleased to show Sheila that he was no mere lily-fingered idler about\r\ntown. He buckled to his work in earnest. With a few more casts he soon\r\ngot into the way of managing the big rod; and every time the flies\r\nfell lightly on the other side of the pool, to be dragged with gentle\r\njerks across the foaming current of the stream. Ingram went back to\r\nhis couch on the rock. He lay and watched the monotonous flinging\r\nback of the long rod, the light whistle of the line through the air,\r\nand the careful manipulation of the flies through the water. Or was\r\nit something else that he was watching--something that awakened in\r\nhis mind a sudden sense of surprise and fear, and a new and strange\r\nconsciousness that he had been guiltily remiss?\r\n\r\nSheila was wholly preoccupied with her companion and his efforts. He\r\nhad had one or two rises, but had struck either too soon or too late,\r\nuntil at last there was a terrific plunge and rush, and again the line\r\nwas whirled out. But Duncan did not like the look of it, somehow. The\r\nfish had been sheering off when it was hooked, and the deep plunge at\r\nthe outset was ugly.\r\n\r\n\"Now will you take the rod?\" said Lavender to Sheila.\r\n\r\nBut before she could answer the fish had come rushing up to the\r\nsurface, and had thrown itself out of the water, so that it fell on\r\nthe opposite bank. It was a splendid animal, and Duncan, despite his\r\ndoubts, called out to Ingram to slacken his hold. There was another\r\nspring into the air, the fish fell with a splash into the water, and\r\nthe line was flying helplessly in the air, with the two flies floating\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said Duncan, with a sigh, \"it wass foul-hooked. It wass no\r\nchance of catching him whatever.\"\r\n\r\nLavender was more successful next time, however, with a pretty little\r\ngrilse of about half a dozen pounds, that seemed to have in him the\r\nspirit and fight of a dozen salmon. How he rushed and struggled, how\r\nhe plunged and sulked, how he burrowed along the banks, and then ran\r\nout to the middle of the pool, and then threw himself into the air,\r\nwith the line apparently but not really doubling up under him! All\r\nthese things can only be understood by the fisherman who has played in\r\na Highland stream a wild and powerful little grilse fresh in from the\r\nsalt water. And it was Sheila who held him captive, who humored him\r\nwhen he sulked, and gently guided him away from dangerous places, and\r\nkept him well in hand when he tried to cross the current, until at\r\nlast, all the fierceness gone out of him, he let himself be tenderly\r\ninveigled into the side of the pool, where Duncan, by a dexterous\r\nmovement, surrounded him with network and placed his shining body\r\namong the bright green grass.\r\n\r\nBut Ingram was not so overjoyed this time. He complimented Sheila in a\r\nfriendly way, but he was rather grave, and obviously did not care for\r\nthis business of fishing. And so Sheila, fancying that he was rather\r\ndull because he was not joining in the sport, proposed that he should\r\nwalk back to the house with her, leaving Mr. Lavender with Duncan. And\r\nIngram was quite ready to do so.\r\n\r\nBut Lavender protested that he cared very little for salmon-fishing.\r\nHe suggested that they should all go back together. The sun was\r\nkilling the wind, and soon the pools would be as clear as glass. Had\r\nthey not better try in the afternoon, when perhaps the breeze would\r\nfreshen? And so they walked back to the house.\r\n\r\nOn the garden-seat a book lay open. It was Mr. Mill's _Essay on\r\nLiberty_, and it had evidently been left there by Mr. Mackenzie,\r\nperhaps--who knows?--to hint to his friends from the South that he was\r\nfamiliar with the problems of the age. Lavender winked to Ingram, but\r\nsomehow his companion seemed in no humor for a joke.\r\n\r\nThey had luncheon then, and after luncheon Ingram touched Lavender\r\non the shoulder and said, \"I want to have a word with you privately.\r\nLet's walk down to the shore.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they did; and when they had got some little distance from the\r\nhouse, Ingram said, \"Look here, Lavender. I mean to be frank with you.\r\nI don't think it fair that you should try to drag Sheila Mackenzie\r\ninto a flirtation. I knew you would fall in love with her. For a week\r\nor two, that does not matter--it harms no one. But I never thought\r\nof the chance of her being led into such a thing, for what is a mere\r\npassing amusement to you would be a very serious thing to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well? Is not that enough? Do you think it fair to take advantage of\r\nthis girl's ignorance of the world?\"\r\n\r\nLavender stopped in the middle of the path, and said, somewhat\r\nstiffly, \"This may be as well settled at once. You have talked of\r\nflirtation and all that sort of thing. You may regard it as you\r\nplease, but before I leave this island I mean to ask Sheila Mackenzie\r\nto be my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are mad!\" cried Ingram, amazed to see that the young man was\r\nperfectly serious.\r\n\r\nThe other shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say,\" continued Ingram, \"that even supposing Sheila\r\nwould consent--which is impossible--you would try to take away that\r\ngirl from her father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Girls must leave their fathers some time or other,\" said Lavender\r\nsomewhat sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"Not unless they are asked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh well, they are sure to be asked, and they are sure to go. If their\r\nmothers had not done so before them, where would they be? It's all\r\nvery well for you to talk about it and argue it out as a theory, but\r\nI know what the facts of the case are, and what any man in my position\r\nwould do; and I know that I am careless of any consequences so long as\r\nI can secure her for my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently you are--careless of any consequences to herself or those\r\nabout her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is your objection, Ingram?\" said the young man, suddenly\r\nabandoning his defiant manner: \"why should you object? Do you think I\r\nwould make a bad husband to the woman I married?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe nothing of the sort. I believe you would make a very good\r\nhusband if you were to marry a woman whom you knew something about,\r\nand whom you had really learned to love and respect through your\r\nknowledge of her. I tell you, you know nothing about Sheila Mackenzie\r\nas yet. If you were to marry her to-morrow, you would discover in six\r\nmonths she was a woman wholly different from what you had expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said Lavender with an air of triumph, \"you can't\r\ndeny this: you think so much of her that the real woman I would\r\ndiscover must be better than the one I imagine; and so you don't\r\nexpect I shall be disappointed?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you marry Sheila Mackenzie you will be disappointed--not through\r\nher fault, but your own. Why, a more preposterous notion never entered\r\ninto a man's head! She knows nothing of your friends or your ways of\r\nlife: you know nothing of hers. She would be miserable in London, even\r\nif you could persuade her father to go with her, which is the most\r\nunlikely thing in the world. Do give up this foolish idea, like a good\r\nfellow; and do it before Sheila is dragged into a flirtation that may\r\nhave the most serious consequences to her.\"\r\n\r\nLavender would not promise, but all that afternoon various resolutions\r\nand emotions were struggling within him for mastery, insomuch that\r\nDuncan could not understand the blundering way in which he whipped\r\nthe pools. Mackenzie, Sheila and Ingram had gone off to pay a visit\r\nto an old crone who lived in a neighboring island, and in whom Ingram\r\nhad been much interested a few years before; so that Lavender had\r\nan opportunity of practicing the art of salmon-fishing without\r\ninterruptions. But all the skill he had shown in the morning seemed to\r\nhave deserted him; and at last he gave the rod to Duncan, and, sitting\r\ndown on a top-coat flung on the wet heather, indolently watched the\r\ngillie's operations.\r\n\r\nShould he at once fly from temptation and return to London? Would\r\nit not be heroic to leave this old man in possession of his only\r\ndaughter? Sheila would never know of the sacrifice, but what of that?\r\nIt might be for her happiness that he should go.\r\n\r\nBut when a young man is in love, or fancies himself in love, with a\r\nyoung girl, it is hard for him to persuade himself that anybody else\r\ncan make her as happy as he might. Who could be so tender to her, so\r\nwatchful over her, as himself? He does not reflect that her parents\r\nhave had the experience of years in taking care of her, while he would\r\nbe a mere novice at the business. The pleasure with which he regards\r\nthe prospect of being constantly with her he transfers to her, and\r\nshe seems to demand it of him as a duty that he should confer upon her\r\nthis new happiness.\r\n\r\nLavender met Sheila in the evening, and he was yet undecided.\r\nSometimes he fancied, when their eyes met unexpectedly, that there\r\nwas something wistful as well as friendly in her look: was she too\r\ndreaming of the vague possibilities of the future? This was strange,\r\ntoo, that after each of those little chance reveries she seemed to be\r\nmoved by a resolution to be more than usually affectionate toward\r\nher father, and would go round the table and place her hand on his\r\nshoulder and talk to him. Perhaps these things were but delusions\r\nbegotten of his own imaginings, but the possibility of their being\r\nreal agitated him not a little, and he scarcely dared to think what\r\nmight follow.\r\n\r\nThat evening Sheila sang, and all his half-formed resolutions\r\nvanished into air. He sat in a corner of the curious, dimly-lit and\r\nold-fashioned chamber, and, lying back in the chair, abandoned himself\r\nto dreams as Sheila sang the mystic songs of the northern coasts.\r\nThere was something strangely suggestive of the sea in the room\r\nitself, and all her songs were of the sea. It was a smaller room than\r\nthe large apartment in which they had dined, and it was filled with\r\ncuriosities from distant shores and with the strange captures made by\r\nthe Borva fishermen. Everywhere, too, were the trophies of Mackenzie's\r\nskill with rod and rifle. Deer's horns, seal skins, stuffed birds,\r\nsalmon in glass cases, masses of coral, enormous shells and a thousand\r\nsimilar things made the little drawing-room a sort of grotto; but it\r\nwas a grotto within hearing of the sound of the sea, and there was no\r\nmusty atmosphere in a room that was open all day to the cold winds of\r\nthe Atlantic.\r\n\r\nWith a smoking tumbler of whisky and water before him, the King of\r\nBorva sat at the table, poring over a large volume containing plans\r\nfor bridges. Ingram was seated at the piano, in continual consultation\r\nwith Sheila about her songs. Lavender, in this dusky corner, lay and\r\nlistened, with all sorts of fancies crowding in upon him as Sheila\r\nsang of the sad and wild legends of her home. Was it by chance, then,\r\nhe asked himself, that these songs seemed so frequently to be the\r\nlamentation of a Highland girl for a fair-haired lover beyond the sea?\r\nFirst of all she sang the \"Wail of Dunevegan,\" and how strangely her\r\nvoice thrilled with the sadness of the song!--\r\n\r\n  Morn, oh mantle thy smiles of gladness!\r\n  Night, oh come with thy clouds of sadness!\r\n  Earth, thy pleasures to me seem madness!\r\n  Macleod, my leal love, since thou art gone.\r\n        Dunevegan, oh! Dunevegan, oh!\r\n        Dunevegan! Dunevegan!\r\n\r\nIt was as in a dream that he heard Ingram talking in a matter-of-fact\r\nway about the various airs, and asking the meaning of certain lines of\r\nGaelic to compare them with the stiff and old-fashioned phrases of the\r\ntranslation. Surely this girl must have sat by the shore and waited\r\nfor her absent lover, or how could she sing with such feeling?--\r\n\r\n  Say, my love, why didst thou tarry\r\n        Far over the deep sea?\r\n  Knew'st thou not my heart was weary,\r\n  Heard'st thou not how I sighed for thee!\r\n  Did no light wind bear my wild despair\r\n        Far over the deep sea?\r\n\r\nHe could imagine that beautiful face grown pale and wild with anguish.\r\nAnd then some day, as she went along the lonely island, with all the\r\nlight of hope gone out of her eyes, and with no more wistful glances\r\ncast across the desolate sea, might not the fair-haired lover come\r\nat last, and leap ashore to clasp her in his arms, and hide the\r\nwonder-stricken eyes and the glad face in his bosom? But Sheila sang\r\nof no such meeting. The girl was always alone, her lover gone away\r\nfrom her across the sea or into the wilds.\r\n\r\n  Oh long on the mountain he tarries, he tarries:\r\n    Why tarries the youth with the bright yellow hair:\r\n  Oh long on the mountain he tarries, he tarries:\r\n    Why seeks he the hill when his flock is not there?\r\n\r\nThat was what he heard her sing, until it seemed to him that her\r\nsinging was a cry to be taken away from these melancholy surroundings\r\nof sea and shore, and carried to the secure and comfortable South,\r\nto be cherished and tended and loved. Why should this girl be left\r\nto live a cruel life up in these wilds, and to go through the world\r\nwithout knowing anything of the happy existence that might have been\r\nhers? It was well for harder and stronger natures to withstand the\r\nbuffetings of wind and rain, and to be indifferent to the melancholy\r\ninfluences of the lonely sea and the darkness of the northern\r\nwinters; but for her--for this beautiful, sensitive, tender-hearted\r\ngirl--surely some other and gentler fate was in store. What he, at\r\nleast, could do he would. He would lay his life at her feet; and if\r\nshe chose to go away from this bleak and cruel home to the sunnier\r\nSouth, would not he devote himself, as never a man had given himself\r\nto a woman before, to the constant duty of enriching her life with all\r\nthe treasures of admiration and respect and love?\r\n\r\nIt was getting late, and presently Sheila retired. As she bade\r\n\"Good-night\" to him, Lavender fancied her manners was a little less\r\nfrank toward him than usual, and her eyes were cast down. All the\r\nlight of the room seemed to go with her when she went.\r\n\r\nMackenzie mixed another tumbler of toddy, and began to expound to\r\nIngram his views upon deer-forests and sheep-farms. Ingram lit a\r\ncigar, stretched out his legs and proceeded to listen with much\r\ncomplacent attention. As for Lavender, he sat a while, hearing vaguely\r\nthe sounds of his companions' voices, and then, saying he was a trifle\r\ntired, he left and went to his own room. The moon was then shining\r\nclearly over Suainabhal, and a pathway of glimmering light lay across\r\nLoch Roag.\r\n\r\nHe went to bed, but not to sleep. He had resolved to ask Sheila\r\nMackenzie to be his wife, and a thousand conjectures as to the future\r\nwere floating about his imagination. In the first place, would she\r\nlisten to his prayer? She knew nothing of him beyond what she might\r\nhave heard from Ingram. He had had no opportunity, during their\r\nfriendly talking, of revealing to her what he thought of herself; but\r\nmight she not have guessed it? Then her father--what action might not\r\nthis determined old man take in the matter? Would his love for his\r\ndaughter prompt him to consider her happiness alone? All these things,\r\nhowever, were mere preliminaries, and the imagination of the young man\r\nsoon overleapt them. He began to draw pictures of Sheila as his wife\r\nin their London home, among his friends, at Hastings, at Ascot, in\r\nHyde Park. What would people say of the beautiful sea-princess with\r\nthe proud air, the fearless eyes and the gentle and musical voice?\r\nHour after hour he lay and could not sleep: a fever of anticipation,\r\nof fear and of hope combined seemed to stir in his blood and throb in\r\nhis brain. At last, in a paroxysm of unrest, he rose, hastily dressed\r\nhimself, stole down stairs, and made his way out into the cool air of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nIt could not be the coming dawn that revealed to him the outlines of\r\nthe shore and the mountains and the loch? The moon had already sunk in\r\nthe south-west: not from her came that strange clearness by which all\r\nthese objects were defined. Then the young man bethought him of what\r\nSheila had said of the twilight in these latitudes, and, turning to\r\nthe north, he saw there a pale glow which looked as if it were the\r\nlast faint traces of some former sunset. All over the rest of the\r\nheavens something of the same metallic clearness reigned, so that the\r\nstars were pale, and a gray hue lay over the sea, and over the island,\r\nthe white bays, the black rocks and the valleys, in which lay a\r\nscarcely perceptible mist.\r\n\r\nHe left the house and went vaguely down to the sea. The cold air,\r\nscented strongly with the seaweed, blew about him, and was sweet and\r\nfresh on the lips and the forehead. How strange was the monotonous\r\nsound of the waves, mournful and distant, like the sound in a\r\nseashell! That alone spoke in the awful stillness of the night, and\r\nit seemed to be telling of those things which the silent stars and the\r\nsilent hills had looked down on for ages and ages. Did Sheila really\r\nlove this terrible thing, with its strange voice talking in the night,\r\nor did she not secretly dread it and shudder at it when she sang\r\nof all that old sadness? There was ringing in his ears the \"Wail of\r\nDunevegan\" as he listened for a while to the melancholy plashing\r\nof the waves all around the lonely shores; and there was a cry of\r\n\"Dunevegan, oh! Dunevegan, oh!\" weaving itself curiously with those\r\nwild pictures of Sheila in London which were still floating before his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nHe walked away around the coast, seeing almost nothing of the objects\r\naround him, but conscious of the solemn majesty of the mountains and\r\nthe stillness of the throbbing stars. He could have called aloud,\r\n\"Sheila! Sheila!\" but that all the place seemed associated with her\r\npresence; and might he not turn suddenly to find her figure standing\r\nby him, with her face grown wild and pale as it was in the ballad,\r\nand a piteous and awful look in her eyes? Did the figure accuse him?\r\nHe scarcely dared look round, lest there should be a phantom Sheila\r\nappealing to him for compassion, and complaining against him with her\r\nspeechless eyes for a wrong that he could not understand. He fled from\r\nher, but he knew she was there; and all the love in his heart went out\r\nto her as if beseeching her to go away and forsake him, and forgive\r\nhim the injury of which she seemed to accuse him. What wrong had\r\nhe done her that he should be haunted by this spectre, that did not\r\nthreaten, but only looked piteously toward him with eyes full of\r\nentreaty and pain?\r\n\r\nHe left the shore, and blindly made his way up to the pasture-land\r\nabove, careless whither he went. He knew not how long he had been away\r\nfrom the house, but here was a small fresh-water lake set round about\r\nwith rushes, and far over there in the east lay a glimmer of the\r\nchannels between Borva and Lewis. But soon there was another light\r\nin the east, high over the low mists that lay along the land. A pale\r\nblue-gray arose in the cloudless sky, and the stars went out one by\r\none. The mists were seen to lie in thicker folds along the desolate\r\nvalleys. Then a faintly yellow whiteness stole up into the sky, and\r\nbroadened and widened, and behold! the little moorland loch caught\r\na reflection of the glare, and there was a streak of crimson here\r\nand there on the dark-blue surface of the water. Loch Roag began to\r\nbrighten. Suainabhal was touched with rose-red on its eastern slopes.\r\nThe Atlantic seemed to rise out of its purple sleep with the new\r\nlight of a new dawn; and then there was a chirruping of birds over\r\nthe heath, and the first shafts of the sunlight ran along the surface\r\nof the sea, and lit up the white wavelets that were breaking on the\r\nbeach. The new day struck upon him with a strange sense of wonder.\r\nWhere was he? Whither had gone the wild visions of the night, the\r\nfeverish dread, the horrible forebodings? The strong mental emotion\r\nthat had driven him out now produced its natural reaction: he looked\r\nabout in a dazed fashion at the revelation of light around him, and\r\nfelt himself trembling with weakness. Slowly, blindly and hopelessly\r\nhe set to walk back across the island, with the sunlight of the fresh\r\nmorning calling into life ten thousand audible things of the moorland\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nAnd who was this who stood at the porch of the house in the clear\r\nsunshine? Not the pale and ghastly creature who had haunted him during\r\nthose wild hours, but Sheila herself, singing some snatches of a song,\r\nand engaged in watering the two bushes of sweetbrier at the gate. How\r\nbright and roseate and happy she looked, with the fine color of her\r\nface lit up by the fresh sunlight, and the brisk breeze from the sea\r\nstirring now and again the loose masses of her hair! Haggard and faint\r\nas he was, he would have startled her if he had gone up to her then.\r\nHe dared not approach her. He waited until she had gone round to the\r\ngable of the house to water the plants there, and then he stole into\r\nthe house and up stairs, and threw himself upon the bed. And outside\r\nhe still heard Sheila singing lightly to herself as she went about her\r\nordinary duties, little thinking in how strange and wild a drama her\r\nwraith had that night taken part.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Pronounced _Argyud-chark_; literally, \"hen-money.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL EXPERT EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any position of more responsibility than that of\r\nthe medical expert in cases of alleged poisoning. Often he stands with\r\npractically absolute power between society and the accused--the former\r\nlooking to him for the proof of the crime and for the protection which\r\ndiscovery brings; the latter relying upon him for the vindication\r\nof his innocence. How profound and complete, then, should be\r\nhis knowledge! how thorough his skill! how pure and spotless his\r\nintegrity! how unimpeachable his results! Yet recently the humiliating\r\nspectacle has been repeatedly presented of expert swearing against\r\nexpert, until the question at issue was apparently degraded into one\r\nof personal feeling or of professional reputation. So far has this\r\ngone that both judicial and public opinion seems to be demanding\r\nthe abolition of expert testimony. The medical expert must, however,\r\nremain an essential feature in our criminal procedures, partaking as\r\nhe does of the functions of the lawyer, inasmuch as he has, to some\r\nextent, the right to argue before the jury, partaking also of the\r\njudicial character in that it is his duty to express an opinion upon\r\nevidence, but differing from both judge and advocate in that as a\r\nwitness he testifies to facts. Were the attempt made to do away with\r\nhis functions, there would be an end to just convictions in the class\r\nof cases spoken of, because no one would be qualified to say whether\r\nany given death had been produced by poison or by a natural cause.\r\n\r\nIn many matters that come under the notice of medical experts there is\r\nroom for honest differences of opinion. Of such nature are questions\r\nof sanity and insanity. It must be remembered that these are, after\r\nall, _relative_ terms. Reason leaves its seat by almost imperceptible\r\nsteps. Who can determine with exactness the line that separates\r\neccentricity from madness--responsibility from irresponsibility?\r\nMoreover, the phenomena upon which opinion is based are, in such\r\ncases, so hidden, so complex, so obscure, that in the half-lights of a\r\nfew short interviews they will often be seen differently by different\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\nIn scarcely any of its parts does toxicology belong to this class\r\nof subjects--certainly not at all in so far as it deals with mineral\r\npoisons. To a great extent it is a fixed science--a science whose\r\nboundaries may be widened, whose processes may be rendered more\r\ndelicate, but whose principles are in great measure settled for ever.\r\nNot in the imperfections of the science, but in the habits of the\r\nAmerican medical profession and in the methods of our criminal\r\nprocedures, lies the origin of the evils complained of.\r\n\r\nSome of the causes of the present difficulties are readily to be seen.\r\nOne is the common ignorance of legal or forensic medicine among the\r\nmembers of the profession. In none of our medical colleges is legal\r\nmedicine taught as a part of the regular course or as an essential\r\nbranch of study. Consequently, when the student graduates he has only\r\nheard a few passing allusions to the subject from professors of other\r\nbranches. Unfortunately, this is more or less true of many other\r\nmedical subjects of importance: helped out, however, by his mother\r\nwit, and impelled by necessity, the imperfectly-educated graduate\r\nafter a time becomes very generally a skillful practitioner. During\r\nthe period of growth his daily needs govern the direction of his\r\nstudies, which are therefore more or less exclusively confined to the\r\nso-called practical branches. Forensic medicine is not one of these,\r\npoison cases are comparatively rare, and to be called upon to give a\r\ndefinite opinion upon such matters before a legal tribunal happens\r\nnot once in the lifetime of most medical men. Consequently, to a great\r\npart of the American medical profession legal medicine is a veritable\r\n_terra incognita_.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the whole drift of modern medicine is toward a division\r\nof labor, and forensic medicine is more widely separated from the\r\nordinary specialties of the science than these are from one another.\r\nIn a case of delicate eye-surgery who would value the opinion of a\r\nman whose attention had been devoted mainly to thoracic diseases? What\r\nspecialist of the latter character would even offer an opinion? Yet\r\nphysicians who acknowledge that they have paid no especial attention\r\nto toxicology do not hesitate to give the most positive opinions upon\r\nthe most delicate questions of that science. Men who would, as in\r\nhonor bound, ask for a consultation in any case of serious sickness\r\noutside of their line of private practice, on the witness-stand put\r\nforth with the utmost boldness their ignorant crudities, careless\r\nor forgetful of the fact that they may be imperiling the life of an\r\ninnocent human being. On the trial of Mrs. Wharton for the attempted\r\nmurder of Mr. Van Ness, Dr. Williams asserted that there are\r\npeculiar characteristic symptoms or groups of symptoms of tartar\r\nemetic poisoning;[13] and both he and Dr. Chew--who with frankness\r\nacknowledged that he had not especially studied toxicology--did most\r\npositively recognize tartar emetic as the sole possible cause of\r\ncertain symptoms which were but a little beyond the line of medicinal\r\naction, and for which obviously possible natural cause existed.\r\nContrast these bold opinions with the cautious statement of a man\r\nwho had given a lifetime of study to this particular subject. On the\r\ntrial of Madeleine Smith, Professor Christison--at that time the first\r\ntoxicologist of England--stated that if in any case the symptoms and\r\npost-mortem appearances corresponded exactly with those caused by\r\narsenic, he should be led to _suspect_ poisoning.\r\n\r\nAnother source of mischief lies in the fact that the law does not\r\nrecognize the well-established principles of forensic medicine, and\r\nconsequently the books in which these principles are laid down by the\r\nhighest authorities are excluded by the courts, while the _vivâ voce_\r\nevidence of any medical man, however ignorant on such points, is\r\nadmitted as that of an expert.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not to be wondered at that juries give but little\r\nconsideration to the knowledge or professional standing of expert\r\nwitnesses. It is, in fact, notorious that the medical autocrat of the\r\nvillage, who has superintended the entrance of the majority of the\r\njurymen into this troublous world, is a more important witness than\r\nthe most renowned special student of the branch: indeed, the chief\r\nvalue of the real expert often rests on his ability to influence the\r\nlocal physician.[14] At the late Wharton-Van Ness trial the defence\r\ndesired to show that the work of the chemist employed by the\r\nprosecution was unreliable, because the analyses made by him in a\r\nprevious case had \"been condemned by the united voice of the whole\r\nscientific world.\" The court was not able to see the _relevancy_ of\r\nthis, and refused to allow the professional ability or standing of an\r\nexpert to be called in question. The witness thus adjudged competent\r\nbrought no results into court; had kept no laboratory notes; relied\r\nsolely on a memory so deficient that although he had been teaching for\r\nthirty-five years, he could not tell the shape of a crystal of tartar\r\nemetic, the poison in question; and upon the stand made a statement\r\ndifferent from one which he had furnished officially to the district\r\nattorney of Baltimore fourteen months before.\r\n\r\nThere are principles of toxicology which ought to have legal force\r\nand recognition, and ought to govern expert testimony in the same\r\nway that the principles of evidence govern ordinary testimony.\r\nWithout presuming to enumerate these, I will cite two or three for\r\nillustration. Certain substances, the so-called irritant poisons, such\r\nas arsenic, tartar emetic and the like, induce their toxic effects\r\nby causing irritation and inflammation of the alimentary canal. All\r\nauthorities agree that poisoning by these substances cannot be proved,\r\nor even rendered, very probable, by symptoms alone--that chemical\r\nevidence, the discovery of the poison in the food, dejections, or in\r\ncase of death the body, is absolutely essential for making out a case.\r\nIrritation and inflammation of the alimentary canal occur so often\r\nand so suddenly from natural causes, which are sometimes apparent, but\r\noften hidden, that no especial weight can be attached to them.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the so-called neurotic poisons, those which act upon\r\nthe nervous system, the symptoms are so closely simulated by natural\r\ndisease that even when they agree in the most absolute manner with\r\nthose usually developed by any such poison they only render poisoning\r\nhighly probable, not certain.[15] When in any case the symptoms\r\ndiverge from the typical array, poisoning becomes improbable just in\r\nproportion to the amount of divergence.\r\n\r\nAll toxicological authorities also agree that in the case of the\r\nmetallic poisons, such as tartar emetic and arsenic, the metal must be\r\nbrought into court, and that the so-called \"color tests\" are not to be\r\nrelied on. When sulphuretted hydrogen is passed through solutions of\r\nthese metallic substances colored precipitates are thrown down, which\r\nat one time were thought to be absolute proof of the existence of the\r\npoison in the original solution. But in the celebrated Donnal case,\r\ntried at Falmouth, England, in 1817, Dr. Neale saved the accused by\r\nshowing that a decoction of onions, of which the deceased had eaten a\r\nshort time before death, yielded similar precipitates to those relied\r\nupon by the prosecution as establishing the presence of arsenic in\r\nthe stomach. In regard to tartar emetic, Dr. Taylor, in his work on\r\nmedical jurisprudence, says: \"Antimony in the metallic state is so\r\neasily procured from a small quantity of material that on no account\r\nshould this be omitted. A reliance on a small quantity of a colored\r\nprecipitate would be most unsatisfactory as chemical evidence.\" In\r\ndefiance of all the authorities the prosecution, on the trial of Mrs.\r\nWharton for the murder of General Ketchum, rested its proof of poison\r\nupon these color tests and their sequences. The defence, however,\r\nfound that the counterparts of three out of the four so-called\r\ncharacteristic reactions were readily performed with the substances\r\nknown to have been in the stomach of General Ketchum at the time of\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases of poisoning which have been tried recently in this\r\nState and Maryland have attracted much attention, and I propose now\r\nbriefly to outline these, and show that the disgraceful scenes\r\nwhich have taken place were not due to deficiencies of toxicological\r\nscience, but to the causes already spoken of.\r\n\r\nFirst in time among these _causes célèbres_ was the Schoeppe case,\r\nthe facts of which may be briefly summed up as follows: Dr. Schoeppe,\r\na young German practicing medicine in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, became\r\nengaged to be married to a Miss Stennecke, a maiden lady of sixty\r\nyears of age. Miss Stennecke was somewhat of an invalid, not often\r\nactually sick, but habitually distressed by dyspeptic symptoms, etc.\r\nOn the morning of the 27th of January, 1869, feeling unwell, she sent\r\nfor Dr. Schoeppe, who gave her an emetic. In the afternoon, according\r\nto the testimony of her maid, she was weak, but apparently not ill.\r\nBetween 7 and 8 P.M., however, she became much worse, and her servant\r\nnoticed that she was very drowsy, so that if left alone she would\r\nimmediately fall asleep whilst sitting in her chair. Shortly after\r\nthis she was put to bed, and was not seen again until the next morning\r\nabout six o'clock, when she was found comatose, with contracted\r\npupils, irregular respiration and complete muscular relaxation. Late\r\nin the afternoon of the same day she died quietly.\r\n\r\nNothing was said about poisoning until some days afterward, when, a\r\nwill having been produced in favor of Dr. Schoeppe, an accusation\r\nwas made against him. The body of Miss Stennecke was exhumed, and\r\nunderwent a post-mortem examination, which, for culpable carelessness\r\nand inexcusable omissions, stands unrivaled. Not a single organ in\r\nthe whole body was thoroughly examined, and many of the more important\r\nparts were not looked at. Death, preceded by the symptoms exhibited\r\nin the case of Miss Stennecke, occurs not infrequently from insidious\r\ndisease of the kidneys, yet these organs were not taken out of the\r\nbody. The stomach was examined chemically by Professor Aiken of the\r\nUniversity of Maryland, who reported that he had found prussic acid,\r\nand who testified on the trial that Miss Stennecke had received a\r\nfatal dose of that poison. When, however, his evidence was sifted, it\r\nwas discovered that he had only obtained traces of the poison by the\r\ndistillation of the stomach with sulphuric acid. As saliva contains\r\nferrocyanide of potassium, out of which sulphuric acid generates\r\nprussic acid, the latter substance will always be obtained by the\r\nprocess adopted by Professor Aiken from any stomach which has in it\r\nthe least particle of saliva. If, then, the professor did really get\r\nprussic acid, without doubt he manufactured it.\r\n\r\nDr. Hermann, however, testified that Miss Stennecke, whom he saw on\r\nthe morning of her death, must have died of a compound poison, because\r\nher eye looked like that of a hawk killed by himself some years before\r\nwith a dose of all the poisons he had in his apothecary's shop. Dr.\r\nConrad confirmed the assertion of Dr. Hermann, that Miss Stennecke\r\ncould not have died from a natural cause, and testified that as the\r\nliver was healthy, therefore the kidneys must have been so too--a\r\nconclusion which could only have been evolved from his inner\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nIn vain Professor Wormley protested, declaring that it was impossible\r\nMiss Stennecke could have been killed by prussic acid, because that\r\npoison always does its work in a few minutes, if at all, whereas Miss\r\nStennecke lived nearly twenty-four hours after the alleged poisoning.\r\nWhat did it matter that Dr. Conrad had shown himself by his\r\npost-mortem examination ignorant of the first rudiments of legal\r\nmedicine, and that Dr. Hermann was a village doctor of the olden\r\ntype dragged into court from a mediæval contest with the diseases of\r\nsimple country-folk, while Professor Wormley had devoted his life to\r\ntoxicology and achieved a world-wide reputation? What did it matter\r\nthat the written words of all authorities upon such subjects in every\r\nland were in absolute accord with Dr. Wormley? Under the ruling--which\r\nhas been reaffirmed at Annapolis--the settled principles of science\r\nwere overborne by ignorant conjecture, and to the mockery of justice,\r\nto the deep disgrace of our commonwealth, Dr. Schoeppe was condemned\r\nto death upon evidence which, from the same bench, was subsequently\r\nstigmatized as being insufficient to warrant his commitment for trial.\r\n\r\nThree years of close confinement under the shadow of death followed.\r\nThe governor refused a pardon, and Dr. Schoeppe heard the hammer\r\ndriving the nails into his scaffold beneath the prison-window. He was\r\nmeasured for his coffin, but at the last moment was reprieved, and\r\nlistened to the heavy thud as the drop fell and a man whose companion\r\nhe was to have been on the scaffold was launched into eternity.\r\nFinally, moved by the incessant pleadings of Mr. Hepburn, the junior\r\ncounsel, by the urgings of the public press, led by the Philadelphia\r\n_Evening Bulletin_, and by the protests of numerous scientific bodies,\r\nthe legislature passed a special act granting Dr. Schoeppe a new\r\ntrial. On this occasion the judge allowed the weakness of the expert\r\ntestimony for the prosecution to be demonstrated, and chiefly as a\r\nresult of this demonstration--of what has been called the \"coarse\r\nbrutality\" of showing Dr. Conrad's ignorance--Dr. Schoeppe was\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\nIf the principles contended for in this article had been acknowledged,\r\nthe processes and results in the case of Dr. Schoeppe would have been\r\nfar different. In the first place, the post mortem would have been\r\nentrusted to some one qualified to make it--an expert in legal\r\nmedicine--and very probably a natural cause for the death of Miss\r\nStennecke would have been found. Such post mortem not having been\r\nmade, the case, after Professor Aiken's analysis, would have been\r\ndropped, because it was impossible that prussic acid could have caused\r\nthe death. Had, however, capable experts failed to detect a natural\r\ncause of death, a very serious case might have been made out against\r\nDr. Schoeppe, even though the analyst had not found morphia in the\r\nstomach. The prosecution might have affirmed that the poison had been\r\nabsorbed, and therefore was not in the stomach, and, for the support\r\nof the charge, relied upon the resemblance of the symptoms to those\r\nproduced by morphia, and upon the absence of natural cause of death.\r\n\r\nA case which has acquired even more celebrity than the last is that of\r\nMrs. Wharton of Baltimore. The chief facts, as developed at the first\r\ntrial at Annapolis, are as follows: General Ketchum, a man of over\r\nmiddle age and usually in good health, was very much engaged in\r\nattending to matters of business at Washington throughout the entire\r\nday of the 24th of June, 1871. The weather was very hot, yet he walked\r\nabout hurriedly and steadily, getting no dinner, and returning in\r\nthe evening to Mrs. Wharton's at Baltimore about 9 P.M., where he\r\nate a very hearty meal, consisting partly of raspberries. During the\r\nnight he was heard to go down stairs several times. The next day he\r\ncomplained of feeling unwell, but took at bed-time a glass of lemonade\r\nwith brandy, and during the night had some slight vomiting and\r\npurging. In the morning he complained of sick stomach and giddiness,\r\nand at Mrs. Wharton's earnest request[16] Dr. Williams was finally\r\nsent for, and on arriving at 4 P.M. found him sitting up and vomiting,\r\nand prescribed as for a slight attack of cholera morbus. The next\r\nmorning General Ketchum thought himself so much better that he\r\ndischarged his physician. He was, however, very drowsy during the\r\nday, and the evidence at the trial rendered it probable that he took\r\nlaudanum on this day upon his own responsibility. In the evening\r\nhe was found sleeping heavily upon the lounge, and again at Mrs.\r\nWharton's request Dr. Williams was sent for, but did not think it\r\nworth while to come. The next morning Mrs. Wharton again sent for Dr.\r\nWilliams, as General Ketchum was found still lying upon the lounge in\r\na stupor. He remained in this state until his death, which took place\r\nin a convulsion at 3 P.M. He had had during the intervening period\r\nrepeated convulsions, and about one o'clock had become very uneasy,\r\nuttering incoherent cries, but did not recover true consciousness. At\r\nthe examination of the body, made the following morning, the spinal\r\ncord was not looked at: the inner membranes of the brain were found\r\ncongested, and the brain-substance presented throughout \"those dark\r\npoints of blood which indicate passive congestion.\" No other lesions\r\nwere found, and the stomach was handed for analysis to Professor\r\nAiken, who in due time reported that he had \"satisfied himself\" of\r\nthe existence of at least twenty grains of tartar emetic in it.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that this official announcement had much\r\ninfluence upon the minds of Drs. Williams and Chew, with\r\ntheir colleagues, and it is very certain that by it and their\r\nrepresentations was created the public belief in Baltimore that\r\nGeneral Ketchum had been poisoned. The false analysis remained\r\nfor months uncontradicted, and backed up as it was by the whole\r\nintellectual and moral force of the University of Maryland, it could\r\nscarcely happen otherwise than that public opinion should become\r\nso set and hardened that no testimony at the trial could affect it,\r\nespecially as local pride and local prejudice came to its support\r\nwhen experts from other cities questioned the work of the Baltimore\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wharton's servants were first accused, but after a few days she\r\nwas arrested, and with her daughter--who has clung throughout to her\r\nfaith in her mother's purity and goodness--was thrust into a common\r\nfelon's cell, with only the grated bars between her and the lowest of\r\nmen in every stage of drunkenness and delirium. After nearly two weeks\r\nher lawyers obtained her removal to one of the better rooms of the\r\njail, but it was months before anything was said in her favor.\r\n\r\nThe trial opened on December 4, 1871, at Annapolis, and lasted nearly\r\ntwo months. The circumstantial evidence certainly went no farther than\r\nto render it probable that if General Ketchum died of poison it was\r\nadministered by Mrs. Wharton. The State attempted to prove as a\r\nmotive that Mrs. Wharton owed the deceased money. They were signally\r\nunsuccessful in this, however; so that a very intelligent member of\r\nthe jury said to the writer since the trial, \"Whether Mrs. Wharton\r\ndid or did not poison General Ketchum, certainly the State completely\r\nfailed to prove a motive.\" The defence admitted that Mrs. Wharton\r\nhad bought tartar emetic near the time of the alleged poisoning,\r\nbut proved that she was in the habit of using it externally as a\r\ncounter-irritant, and that it was purchased in the most open manner,\r\nthrough a third party, not with the secresy that marks the steps of\r\nthe poisoner.\r\n\r\nThus the whole case centred in a rather remarkable degree upon the\r\nexpert testimony, and the very point of it all was the chemical\r\nanalysis. This is not the place to follow out in detail the scientific\r\ntestimony, but only to point out some peculiarities of it. Almost\r\nall the medical witnesses for the prosecution were colleagues of\r\nProfessor Aiken, none of them men of eminence in toxicological\r\nscience--surgeons, physiologists, obstetricians, the whole faculty,\r\ntrying apparently to hide the nakedness of their colleague. Never\r\nwas strong language more justifiable than that of Mr. Hagner, when\r\nhe said, \"It seemed that the University of Maryland was on trial, and\r\nthat blood was demanded to support it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all, the testimony of most of these gentlemen amounted only to\r\nthis: that they did not believe the death of General Ketchum could\r\nhave occurred from natural causes. On the other hand, the numerous\r\nmedical witnesses for the defence, unconnected by any bond of common\r\ninterest, testified that natural causes, were sufficient to account\r\nfor the death; many of them asserting that the case in all its\r\nsymptoms and post-mortem appearances tallied precisely with the\r\nso-called fulminating form of cerebro-spinal meningitis, which was\r\nprevalent in Baltimore at the time of General Ketchum's death.[17]\r\n\r\nThe medical witnesses for the defence further called attention to\r\nthe fact that the symptoms of General Ketchum's illness were wholly\r\ndifferent from those produced by tartar emetic, and some denied that\r\nthe latter could have caused the sickness. The chemical evidence for\r\nthe prosecution was triumphantly refuted. It was shown that antimony\r\ndid not conform in its reactions with at least one of the tests,\r\nwhich Professor Aiken said his precipitates did; that almost all the\r\nother reactions could be closely simulated with ordinary organic\r\nbodies; that the processes used were those universally condemned by\r\nauthorities; and that carelessness was everywhere so manifest in their\r\nconduction as to entirely vitiate any results. It was also proved that\r\nProfessor Aiken had simply estimated the amount of tartar emetic in\r\nGeneral Ketchum's stomach by the _ocular comparison_ of the _bulk of\r\nprecipitates, neither of which could have been pure_, and _in neither\r\nof which was the existence of antimony really proved_. To weigh\r\na precipitate was a labor not to be thought of when nothing more\r\nimportant than the life of a woman was involved: _guessing_ was all\r\nthat such a trifling issue demanded!\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary event of this most extraordinary trial occurred\r\nwhen the chemists for the defence had completely broken down the\r\ntestimony of Professor Aiken. With the knowledge, it is said, of at\r\nleast one of the judges, without the presence of a representative of\r\nthe defence, or even of a legal officer, the body of General Ketchum\r\nwas secretly exhumed by the doctors who had shown themselves so eager\r\nfor the execution of Mrs. Wharton. The viscera, which they removed,\r\nwere put into the hands not of a chemist of national reputation,\r\nbut of an individual who had been advanced from the position of\r\nhospital steward at Washington to that of professor of chemistry in\r\na small local institute at Baltimore. This professor, when on the\r\nwitness-stand, was singularly confused as to his weights and measures,\r\nand finally shared the ignominy of his predecessor. The defence had\r\nseveral chemists at Annapolis of world-wide reputation and unspotted\r\nintegrity. If the prosecution really believed that General Ketchum had\r\nbeen poisoned, if they really did expect tartar emetic to be found,\r\nwhy did they not allow the presence of these gentlemen at the\r\nanalysis, and thereby ensure the condemnation of Mrs. Wharton? The\r\nconviction is irresistible that they were _afraid of the truth_--that\r\nthey were simply determined to procure the desired verdict at\r\nall hazards and by any means. Yet this was the procedure for the\r\ncompletion of which the court suspended the trial for two days,\r\nbecause, as Chief-Justice Miller stated from the bench, \"it thought\r\nthe ends of justice demanded it\"! Is any further evidence needed of\r\nthe strange ideas, of the perversion of truth and justice, which have\r\ngrown out of the American method of using expert testimony?\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this trial I desire to quote from advanced sheets of\r\nthe edition of Dr. Taylor's great work on medical jurisprudence, now\r\npassing through the press. Reviewing the trial in London with that\r\nfreedom from bias which the isolation of distance produces, he\r\nsays: \"The trial lasted fifty-two days, and an astonishing amount\r\nof evidence was brought forward by the defence and prosecution,\r\napparently owing to the high social position of the parties, for there\r\nis nothing, medically speaking, which might not have been settled in\r\nforty-eight hours. The general died after a short illness, but the\r\nsymptoms, taken as a whole, _bore no resemblance_ to those observed in\r\npoisoning with antimony; and but for the alleged discovery after death\r\nof tartar emetic in the stomach, _no suspicion of poisoning_ would\r\nprobably have arisen.... The chemical evidence,\" he adds, \"does not\r\nconflict with the pathological evidence, for _it failed to show_ with\r\nclearness and distinctness _the presence_ and proportion of poison\r\nsaid to have been found. The _evidence that antimony was really there_\r\nwas not satisfactory, and that twenty grains were in the stomach\r\nwholly unproven.\"[18]\r\n\r\nWhat would have been the course of this trial if expert testimony were\r\nestablished upon proper principles? Professor Aiken having shown his\r\ncomplete incompetency in the Schoeppe case, the analysis would have\r\nbeen entrusted to some skillful chemist, who by failing to discover\r\npoison would have established the innocence of Mrs. Wharton, or by\r\nbringing positive results into court have ensured conviction; or,\r\nDr. Aiken having made the analysis, and having broken all the laws of\r\ntoxicological evidence, his testimony would have been ruled out, and\r\nthe case dismissed because the bungling of the State's witness had\r\ndestroyed the evidences of guilt or of innocence.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1873, Mrs. Wharton was tried at Annapolis for attempting\r\nto poison Eugene Van Ness. The facts of the case are briefly as\r\nfollows: Mr. Van Ness, whose relations with the Wharton family had\r\nbeen extremely intimate for many years, was a bank-clerk, but during\r\nthe spring and early summer of 1871, besides attending to his regular\r\nduties, was employed in settling a large estate. He habitually rose\r\nearly, often at 5 A.M., and generally worked until eleven o'clock at\r\nnight. During this period he suffered from severe nervous headaches,\r\nand probably from other symptoms of an overworked nervous system, but\r\non this point the testimony disagreed. His stomach is at all times so\r\nsensitive that brandy nauseates him. On the 19th of June, after taking\r\nsome claret on an empty stomach at Mrs. Wharton's, he felt very\r\nbadly, suffering from lightness of the head or giddiness and general\r\nwretchedness, with stiffness and numbness in the back of his neck.\r\nOn the 20th he stopped at Mrs. Wharton's about 4 P.M., having eaten\r\nnothing for seven or eight hours, and took raspberries with cream,\r\nand drank claret. This claret, he stated, \"had a taste like peach\r\nleaves.\"[19] Directly after this he had an attack similar to, but\r\nmuch more violent than, that of the day before. Some little time\r\nafter this, whilst in a condition of profound relaxation, he took some\r\nbrandy, and at once emptied his stomach by a single spasmodic effort\r\nof vomiting, with immediate relief. The weather was extremely hot\r\nduring the whole time in which the various attacks here narrated took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June, Mr. Van Ness rose at 5 A.M., but was forced to\r\nreturn to bed by a severe headache. At 9 A.M., after dressing, he\r\nsaid to his wife that he would not eat at home, but would stop at Mrs.\r\nWharton's on his way to the office, to get a cup of her \"nice black\r\ntea.\" A piece of toast was all he ate before his return to Mrs.\r\nWharton's from the banking-house at 4 P.M. Mrs. Wharton then offered\r\nhim some lager beer, and, partly at his own suggestion, put into it\r\nsomething out of a bottle labeled \"Gentian Bitters.\" He found the\r\nliquid so bitter that he took but a part of it.[20]\r\n\r\nShortly afterward Mr. Van Ness became partially blind, and was \"seized\r\nwith the same feeling of giddiness\" as on the day before. After this\r\nhe had convulsions, with unconsciousness, for which large doses of\r\nchloroform and chloral were given. During the attack the patient\r\nrepeatedly said it was of the same character as the preceding ones,\r\nand referred the trouble to the pit of the stomach and to indigestion.\r\n\r\nThe next morning (Sunday), about an hour after waking, he took some\r\ntea and toast, and in ten minutes was seized with nausea, followed by\r\nheartburn and retching, which lasted all day. On Monday morning some\r\nbeef tea--two-thirds of a cupful--was given him, and in less than an\r\nhour as much more, which induced nausea with heartburn. In the evening\r\nhe was roused, and more beef tea offered him, which he refused because\r\nthe last dose had made him sick, and he was afraid this would have the\r\nsame effect. He was, however, prevailed on to take it. After this he\r\nfell asleep, but in a short time woke up with violent nausea, burning\r\nat the pit of the stomach, and finally vomiting. Not until this\r\noccurred did he discover anything wrong with the beef tea: as he\r\nvomited it he found it had an acrid metallic taste.[21]\r\n\r\nThe circumstantial evidence in the case did not amount to any more\r\nthan, or indeed as much as, in the previous trial. It was distinctly\r\nadmitted that no motive could be found, Mr. Van Ness testifying that\r\nthe relations between himself and Mrs. Wharton were most friendly;\r\nthat he held four thousand dollars of her government bonds, for\r\nwhich she had not even a receipt; that she depended upon him for the\r\ncompletion of her pecuniary arrangements for a contemplated trip to\r\nEurope; or, in other words, that she had nothing to gain and much to\r\nlose by his death, and that there was no conceivable emotional motive,\r\nsuch as hate, revenge or envy.[22]\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made to prove that Mrs. Wharton had at any time in her\r\npossession strychnia, the poison alleged to have been used by her. As\r\non the previous trial, the case centred upon the expert testimony, but\r\nthere was no direct chemical evidence, neither the food, the matters\r\nvomited nor the bodily secretions having been examined. Some sediment\r\nfound in a tumbler of punch was asserted by Dr. Aiken to consist\r\nlargely of tartar emetic. This tumbler was not connected with Mrs.\r\nWharton, except by being found at her house in a position where, in\r\nthe language of one of the State's witnesses, \"hundreds of persons\"\r\nhad access to it. It was carried about in the pocket of a lady\r\ninimical to Mrs. Wharton, and into at least one drug-store, before it\r\nreached Professor Aiken, whose analysis was as faulty as before. Any\r\ntartar emetic present in the sediment might have been procured in\r\na pure form by the simple process of dialysis. The only apparatus\r\nnecessary for this would have been a glass vessel divided into two\r\ncompartments by a piece of hog's bladder stretched across it. These\r\nchambers having been partially filled with distilled water, and the\r\nsediment of the tumbler put into one of them, the tartar emetic\r\nwould have left the other ingredients and passed into the second\r\ncompartment. By taking the water out of this and evaporating it, the\r\npoison would have been obtained in a pure crystalline state, and might\r\nhave been brought into court. But Dr. Aiken thought it sufficient for\r\nhim to \"satisfy himself:\" as he stated on the witness-stand, he did\r\nnot consider it his business whether other people were or were not\r\nsatisfied. Consequently, the court was only favored with a memorized\r\nreport of the color tests used by him, exactly as in the previous\r\ntrial. One of the reactions which he said he obtained antimony does\r\nnot conform to.\r\n\r\nDrs. Williams and Chew unhesitatingly stated on the witness-stand that\r\nthey recognized poisoning as early as the Saturday of Mr. Van Ness's\r\nillness.[23] Yet they gave no antidote. They employed on Monday and\r\nTuesday a treatment which, although well adapted to a case of natural\r\ndisease presenting such symptoms, would in a case of poisoning have\r\nmaterially increased the risk to life. They did not save the matters\r\nvomited: they did not save the secretions, which would certainly\r\nhave contained antimony if Mr. Van Ness had been poisoned as alleged.\r\nAccording to their testimony, Mr. Van Ness received six doses of\r\npoison on as many different days, four of the doses administered under\r\ntheir eyes; yet they gave no warning to the unfortunate victim or to\r\nhis friends. If the theory they upheld be correct, that Mrs. Wharton\r\npoisoned both General Ketchum and Mr. Van Ness, the extraordinary\r\nspectacle was presented of one man lying dead in the house from the\r\neffect of poison, of another receiving day after day the fatal dose\r\nwith the knowledge of the attending physician, yet no antidote given,\r\nno warning word put forth, no saving of the evidences of guilt! It\r\nwould seem as though silence at a trial would best become gentlemen\r\nwith such a record, yet they were the only experts who asserted that\r\nstrychnia was the sole possible cause for the attack of the 24th of\r\nJune, and tartar emetic of the subsequent attacks.\r\n\r\nThe experts for the defence asserted that the convulsion of Saturday\r\ncould not have been caused by strychnia or other known poison; that\r\nalthough the symptoms of the later attacks resembled those of tartar\r\nemetic poisoning, they were not identical with those usually produced\r\nby that drug; and that it was exceedingly improbable that these\r\nattacks were due to the poison named, because obvious natural causes\r\nfor them existed.[24]\r\n\r\nThe impropriety and total insufficiency of our methods of criminal\r\nprosecutions were very strongly shown by this trial. One member of\r\nthe jury could barely write his name, and not more than one or two\r\nof them were in the lowest sense of the term educated; no record of\r\nthe testimony was kept by the court, and none, except in the very\r\nbeginning, by the jury, who must therefore have been guided chiefly\r\nby impressions, lawyers' speeches or newspaper records; the feeling\r\namongst the populace, with whom the jurymen freely mingled, was so\r\nbitter that one of the experts was barred out of his lodgings at\r\nten o'clock at night, openly because he was for the defence of Mrs.\r\nWharton; the newspaper which circulated most largely in the place\r\nmisrepresented the testimony, and devoted its columns to scurrilous\r\nattacks upon the integrity and professional ability of the medical\r\nwitnesses for the defence. Yet under these influences, mazed and\r\nconfused by the subtleties and partial statements of the lawyers,\r\nthese twelve honest but ignorant men were called upon to decide\r\nbetween physicians offering precisely opposite opinions. It is well\r\nwhen this so-called administration of justice ends as a monstrous\r\nfarce and not as a tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Wharton-Van Ness trial would have been far\r\ndifferent if the expert testimony had been what it ought to have\r\nbeen. If the excretions of Mr. Van Ness had been put in the hands of\r\na properly-qualified chemist, by finding the metal antimony or by\r\nproving its absence he would at once have settled the case. As it\r\nis, there is no proper evidence of the guilt of Mrs. Wharton. The\r\nprobabilities are in favor of her innocence, because the symptoms were\r\ncertainly widely divergent from those induced by poison, if not, as I\r\nbelieve, absolutely incompatible with poisoning. The medical gentlemen\r\nwho attended Mr. Van Ness, by destroying all the evidence, have made\r\na just conviction and an absolute proving of innocence equally\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIf it were necessary, further illustrations of the deficiencies of our\r\ncriminal processes could be detailed. Some little time since, upon the\r\nchemical evidence of Professor Aiken, a poor colored woman was hung\r\nin Anne Arundel county, Maryland. She died protesting her innocence,\r\nand the general impression appears to be now that she did not commit\r\nthe crime. A prominent member of the Maryland Bar told me recently\r\nof a case tried in that State, in which the accused, as he stated,\r\ncertainly did kill the deceased with arsenic, yet in which, by showing\r\nthe insufficiency of Professor Aiken's analysis of the stomach, he\r\nobtained the acquittal of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be stated too strongly that the trouble is not in the\r\nscience of toxicology, nor in the real students of it. So far as\r\nmineral poisons are concerned, any qualified expert will determine\r\nthe question of poisoning with the unwavering step of a mathematical\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nThe legal recognition of the true character and position of the\r\nexpert, and of certain principles of medical jurisprudence, would\r\nprobably improve the present status, but it is doubtful whether some\r\nother method of reform may not be more available. Professor Henry\r\nHartshorne, at the last meeting of the American Medical Association,\r\nsuggested that the court should appoint in poisoning cases a\r\ncommission to collect the scientific testimony and make report on the\r\nsame. This seems at first sight practicable, but suppose the court\r\nhad appointed, as is not at all improbable they would have done,\r\nProfessors Aiken and Chew and Dr. Williams as the commission in\r\nMrs. Wharton's case? The result would certainly have been an unjust\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nIn Spain and some other countries of Europe the custom is to refer\r\nthe case to the local medical society. If the opinion afterward given\r\nis unanimous, the court is bound by it; if any member object to the\r\nopinion, the case is referred to the medical society of the province;\r\nif the disagreement continue, the matter is brought before the chief\r\nsociety of the capital. Evidently, this plan would not work well here.\r\nIn Prussia it was formerly, and may still be, the custom for an expert\r\nholding a fixed appointment under the government to investigate the\r\ncase, and to send his report to the Royal Medical College of Prussia.\r\nA standing committee of this body, after investigating the matter,\r\nsent the original report, with their comments, to the ministry, by\r\nwhom it was referred to a permanent commission of experts. The report\r\nof the latter body, with all the other papers, was finally sent to\r\nthe criminal court. This method seems complicated, but it resulted in\r\ngiving to Prussia the best corps of experts the world has ever seen,\r\nas well as the most eminent individual medical jurists.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, the object of the present paper to urge any\r\nespecial method of reform, but to call attention to the need of\r\nit, and to show that the present evils do not grow out of the\r\nimperfections of medical jurisprudence, but out of the methods of our\r\ncriminal procedures. Certainly, the matter needs investigation, and\r\nit is hardly possible but that some practicable means of relief could\r\nbe devised by the deliberations of a mixed commission of lawyers and\r\nmedical jurists of eminence.\r\n\r\nH.C. WOOD, JR., M.D.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The utter absurdity of Dr. Williams's assertion is shown\r\nby the fact that on the first and second trials of Mrs. Wharton he\r\naffirmed that the violent convulsions, the extreme muscular rigidity,\r\nthe retentive stomach, seen in the last day of General Ketchum's life\r\nwere due to tartar emetic, and that to tartar emetic were due the\r\nexcessive vomiting, the motionless prostration and muscular relaxation\r\nof Mr. Van Ness on the Sunday and Monday of his illness. Tartar emetic\r\nthe sole possible cause of precisely opposite symptoms!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The parsimony of many legal authorities is an indication\r\nof their want of appreciation of the differences in men. Not\r\nrarely medical experts are forced to sue a borough or county for\r\ncompensation, even when the fee has been agreed on beforehand. In\r\nHuntingdon county, Pennsylvania, some time ago a woman was arrested\r\non the charge of poisoning her mother-in-law, and the stomach of the\r\ndeceased was sent to Professor Reese of this city for analysis. Warned\r\nby previous experience, he refused to make the analysis without a\r\nwritten agreement as to the fees. Nearly three months were spent by\r\nthe authorities in vainly trying to get him to do it without such\r\narrangement, and finally the stomach was returned unopened. During the\r\nwhole of this time the poor woman, very probably innocent, was lying\r\nin prison with the dreadful charge hanging over her.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: A very forcible illustration occurs to me from my own\r\nexperience. I was once summoned to see a woman in the Philadelphia\r\nHospital to whom an assistant nurse of bad character had been seen\r\nto administer laudanum. At the time of my arrival she was apparently\r\nsuffering from the advanced stages of opium poisoning. I spent about\r\nfive hours in trying to restore her. The nurse protested that she\r\nhad given only the medicinal dose ordered by the doctor, but was\r\nnot believed. After death we found thrombosis of the brain--a rare\r\naffection, leaving such minute traces behind it that a careless\r\nexamination will always fail to detect them. This was one of the\r\naffections which, as I had stated on the witness-stand some months\r\nbefore the occurrence just narrated, might have caused the death of\r\nMiss Stennecke with symptoms resembling those of opium poisoning.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: According to the testimony in both the cases of alleged\r\npoisoning by Mrs. Wharton, professional advice was called in at her\r\nrequest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: I think the general opinion of the profession has\r\nendorsed the position of the defence. It is very probable that General\r\nKetchum did die of the disease named, but there are other affections\r\nof which he I may have died; and certainly there were no sufficient\r\ngrounds for asserting that the facts of his case were inconsistent\r\nwith natural disease. The truth is, disease is often so hidden, its\r\nmanifestations so obscure, its stamp upon the tissues so faint, that\r\nrarely is a physician justified in asserting from the symptoms and\r\na _partial_ negative post mortem, such as was performed on General\r\nKetchum, that any given death could not have been due to a natural\r\ncause. Numerous cases of death from natural causes have occurred in\r\nwhich science has been apparently baffled. I have myself seen at least\r\none sudden death in which a careful post mortem failed entirely to\r\ndetect the cause.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Since writing the present paper I have been shown a\r\nprivate letter of Judge Pierce, written last April in regard to the\r\nfirst trial of Mrs. Wharton. After considerable solicitation the judge\r\nhas allowed the publication of an extract from it, which I insert\r\nhere as the words of one of our most eminent criminal jurists, He\r\nsays: \"I had made up my mind, when Dr. Williams's first testimony\r\nwas concluded, that the case would fail. When Professor Aiken's\r\nexamination was concluded it was beyond recovery. All efforts to\r\nsecure a conviction after that were a waste of time and money. The\r\ncase could have been safely for the defendant given to the jury on the\r\ntestimony of the prosecution alone. If I had been sitting as a judge\r\nin the case, I would have instructed the jury at the close of the case\r\nfor the State, if there had been no other testimony, that the evidence\r\nwould not warrant a conviction. And I would have set aside the verdict\r\nif the jury had found the defendant guilty. I do not know the lady\r\nwho was so wantonly charged with this crime, and I do not know of any\r\ncase in the annals of criminal jurisprudence which, from the evidence\r\nsubmitted in the case, had so baseless a foundation for so grave a\r\ncharge.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: It is proper to state that Miss Wharton, in his\r\npresence, partook of the same claret, but perceived nothing peculiar\r\neither in its taste, as she told him at the time, or in its effects\r\nupon her afterward. According to Miss Wharton's testimony, Mrs.\r\nWharton actually drank the claret left in the glass of Mr. Van Ness\r\ndirectly after he left the room.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: This bottle was found in the house after the arrest of\r\nMrs. Wharton, with compound tincture of gentian in it.\r\n\r\nI have outlined the circumstances as Mr. Van Ness told them. A\r\npeculiarity of this trial was the direct contradiction of witnesses.\r\nMr. Van Ness for a long time refused to entertain the idea that Mrs.\r\nWharton had poisoned him. Whilst he was being persuaded into this\r\nbelief he sent for Mrs. Neilson, a prominent lady of Baltimore, with\r\nwhom both he and Mrs. Wharton were very intimate, and dismissing his\r\nwife from the room had a private conversation with her. During this,\r\naccording to Mrs. Neilson's testimony, he stated that Mrs. Wharton\r\ncould not have poisoned him on the Saturday, because they had\r\nexchanged glasses when he complained of the bitterness of the one\r\ninto which she had put the gentian. On the stand Mr. Van Ness flatly\r\ndenied ever having said anything of the sort. In a point of such\r\nvital importance it is impossible to account for the contradiction by\r\n\"failure of memory.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Neilson also contradicted Mr. Van Ness, and the act was in this\r\ncase especially impressive from the manner in which it was done. Miss\r\nNeilson being on the stand, a dispute arose as to whether Mr. Van Ness\r\nhad or had not previously made a sufficient denial for contradiction.\r\nTo settle this, Miss Neilson left the stand: Mr. Van Ness went up and\r\ntook the oath. Then the question was put, \"Did you say so and so?\" He\r\nanswered, \"I certainly did not.\" Miss Neilson returning to the stand\r\nimmediately after this, the question was put to her. The court-room\r\nwas in the deepest silence while in a low but audible voice she\r\nreplied, \"He did say it.\" The testimony of these ladies was in no\r\ndegree shaken by a severe cross-examination.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: An essential symptom of tartar emetic poisoning is\r\npurging as well as vomiting. Dr. Williams of course knows this. It\r\nis a singular circumstance that whilst Mr. Van Ness stated that his\r\nbowels were scarcely affected at all, Dr. Williams testified that\r\nthere was frequent purging. No remedies calculated to arrest purging\r\nwere employed by Dr. Williams, however, during the illness of Mr. Van\r\nNess.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Mrs. Wharton's trip to Europe had been arranged and her\r\npassage engaged months before the occurrence of these events. If the\r\ntheory of the State of Maryland, that she poisoned General Ketchum,\r\nbe true, by poisoning Mr. Van Ness she placed herself in the position\r\nof the criminal who voluntarily and without motive destroys his means\r\nof escape. Either she was insane, or the asserted crimes were not\r\ncommitted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: It is well worthy of mention in this connection that Mr.\r\nI.G. Moale of Baltimore testified that he went for Dr. Chew on Sunday\r\nmorning, on account of the sick stomach of Mr. Van Ness, and that Dr.\r\nChew told him that the vomiting was the almost necessary result of the\r\nremedies used the day before--a truth which, previous to Mr. Moale's\r\nappearance in Annapolis, the experts for the defence had insisted\r\nupon. H. Clay Dallam also testified that Dr. Williams had told him\r\non Saturday that the indisposition of Mr. Van Ness the day before had\r\nbeen a nervous attack from overwork. This opinion also was in absolute\r\nagreement with the opinion expressed by the experts for the defence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The detailed reasons for this opinion will be given in\r\na medical journal at the proper time. It is allowable here to state,\r\nhowever, that not one of the symptoms laid down by authorities as\r\ncharacteristic of strychnia poisoning was present in the attack of the\r\n24th of June, and that not one of the symptoms which characterizes the\r\nnatural convulsion was absent. Further, there is a connection between\r\nthe various portions of Mr. Van Ness's illness which is inconsistent\r\nwith the theory advanced by the prosecution. Mr. Van Ness stated\r\nvery positively that the attacks of the 19th, 20th and 24th of June\r\ncommenced in the same way, with the same symptoms. Yet, according to\r\nthe theory alluded to, they were the result of poisons which act in\r\nprecisely opposite methods. On the other hand, the very simple natural\r\nexplanation of the illness of Mr. Van Ness which was offered by the\r\ndefence at the trial accounts for the unity and the diversity of the\r\nattacks, the basis of which, according to it, was over-susceptibility\r\nof the nervous system and of the stomach, produced by overwork and\r\nheat.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEET WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe denizens of great cities, whose weary eyes are doomed to rest\r\neternally on long rows of buildings, unrelieved by anything softer\r\nor fresher than brownstone or marble fronts, thirst for an occasional\r\nglimpse of Nature, so healing to jaded mind and wearied body. So\r\nuniversal is this sentiment that provision for gratifying it is not\r\nconfined to the cities which our modern civilization has reared, nor\r\ndo the capitals of Christendom alone boast of their parks and similar\r\nplaces of resort. In effete and uncivilized Turkey the \"institution\"\r\nhas long been established, and still flourishes; and the \"Sweet Waters\r\nof Constantinople\" draw quite as well, as regards both male and female\r\nvisitors, as either Fairmount, Central or Hyde Park, or even the Bois\r\nde Boulogne, to which far-famed resort of all that is wise, wicked or\r\nwitty in Paris these Turkish parks most nearly assimilate.\r\n\r\nOne of the two \"Valleys of the Sweet Waters\" is on the European,\r\nthe other on the Asiatic, side of the Bosphorus. The former is more\r\nfrequented by the Greek and other Christian populations, while the\r\nlatter is chiefly resorted to by the higher classes among the Turks\r\nand the veiled ladies of their hareems, and is often visited by the\r\nsultan himself.\r\n\r\nTo the Asiatic Sweet Waters you must go by boat, or rather by\r\n_caique_, a peculiar little frail cockle-shell of a conveyance, rowed\r\nby the most truculent-looking and unmitigated ruffians, Turkish\r\nor Grecian, to be found on any waters or in any land, Christian or\r\nheathen. Picturesque in costume and exceedingly ragged and dirty,\r\nwith the most cut-throat expression of face possible to conceive of,\r\nwhen you entrust your person and purse to their tender mercies you\r\ninvoluntarily remember with satisfaction that you insured your life\r\nfor a good round sum before leaving your native country, and that this\r\nis one of the risks it covers.\r\n\r\nTo the European Sweet Waters you may go by carriage, but if wise will\r\ngo there also by caique; for even the corduroy roads of our Southern\r\ncountry, so famous for their dislocating qualities, can be paralleled\r\nby the so-called road over which once (and once only), for our sins,\r\nwe suffered ourselves to be shaken, not driven. It is the fashion at\r\nConstantinople to visit the Asiatic Sweet Waters only on Friday (the\r\nMussulman Sabbath), and the European Sweet Waters on Sunday; and\r\non those days all that may be seen of Turkish ladies is on full\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nIf you select the Asiatic Sweet Waters for your visit, you go down to\r\nthe wharf at Tophane, where the rival boatmen (caiquejees) raise as\r\nloud a din and make as fierce a fight for your person and piastres as\r\nyou ever encountered on your arrival at New York in a European steamer\r\nfrom rival hack-drivers or hotel \"touters.\" Pulled, pushed and shoved\r\nabout in all directions as fiercely as ever was the body of Patroclus\r\nin the _Iliad_, when Greek and Trojan contended for possession of it,\r\nyou are at last hustled into a caique, and deposited in the bottom\r\non soft cushions, your back supported by the end of the boat, your\r\nface to the two boatmen. The caique is gayly ornamented and pretty\r\nto look at, but it is the crankiest and tickliest of all nautical\r\ninventions--more resembling a Canadian birch-bark canoe than any other\r\ncraft you are acquainted with. Admiring the view, you partially rise\r\nup and lean your elbow on the side of the boat. A warning cry from\r\nyour boatmen and a sudden dip of your frail bark, which almost upsets\r\nyou head-foremost to feed the fishes of the Bosphorus, admonish you\r\nto sit quietly, and you can scarcely venture to stir again during\r\nthe long row. The caique is long and very narrow, and sharp at both\r\nends--pointed, in fact. It is boarded over at these ends to prevent\r\nshipping seas. These planks are prettily varnished, with gilded rails,\r\nwhich give the boat a gay look.\r\n\r\nThe men row vigorously, and the frail skiff skims along the water at\r\na rate of speed equal to an express-train. But the rushing of the\r\nrippling waters past the boat is the chief indication of the rapidity\r\nof our progress, so smoothly do we glide along. One peculiarity of the\r\ncaique is that there are no rowlocks for the oars, which are held by a\r\nloop of leather fastened on the boat.\r\n\r\nAll the senses are soothed and steeped in Elysium during this rapid\r\ntransit. The eye lazily runs over the squat-looking red houses with\r\nflat roofs which line the shore, to rest on the dark cypress trees\r\nwhich fill the intervening spaces, with the gilded balconies of\r\nsome pleasure-palace of sultan or high Turk catching the sight\r\noccasionally. Caiques similar to your own are darting about in all\r\ndirections, following, passing or meeting you, until at length you\r\nreach your destination, indicated by the crowd of caiques tied up\r\nthere, like cabs on a grand-opera night waiting for their customers.\r\nThose of high Turkish functionaries or foreign ambassadors are very\r\ndifferent from yours--as different as a coach-and-four from a common\r\ncab. Many of these have twelve rowers, all in fancy uniforms--red\r\nfezzes and jackets embroidered with gold--while the larger caiques are\r\nprofusely and expensively ornamented.\r\n\r\nStepping ashore, you see a long line of carriages drawn up in several\r\nrows, and of every conceivable variety--from the Turkish araba to the\r\nmost coquettish-looking Parisian coupé--gilded and adorned in a style\r\nto make a French lorette stare with amazement at a lavishness of\r\nexpenditure exceeding her own.\r\n\r\nThe fair ones to whom these carriages belong may be seen in the\r\ndistance squatting down on rugs spread out beneath the trees,\r\nand sipping coffee or sherbert while listening to musicians or\r\nstory-tellers. You stroll toward them as near as their attendant\r\nguardians--grim-looking black eunuchs armed to the teeth, and quite\r\nready to use those arms with very little provocation on the persons\r\nof any \"dogs of infidels\" who may interfere or seem to interfere with\r\ntheir fair charges--will permit. You see bundles of the gayest colored\r\nsilks worn by women whose veils are thin as gossamer, and generally\r\npermit a very fair view of their charms, not only of face, but of\r\nbust as well. The bold black eyes of the caged birds flash out\r\nunshrinkingly on the strangers, who inspire curiosity, and not always\r\naversion, if the language of those eyes be interpreted according to\r\nthe Western code. In fact, the women seem to take a malicious pleasure\r\nin annoying their guards by encouraging such advances as can be made\r\nby the mute language of looks and signs.\r\n\r\nEvery Friday in the year the same pantomime is performed. The women\r\ngo to the Sweet Waters to sit and stare at men whom they do not and\r\nnever will know or speak to, and the men go to walk or waddle about\r\nand stare back at the women in the same way. This monotonous and\r\nmelancholy pastime is varied by much stuffing of sweetmeats and cakes\r\nand sipping of colored beverages by the fair ones, and endless smoking\r\nby the men. There are strolling jugglers and musicians plying their\r\ntrades for the amusement and paras of the public, and they are\r\nliberally patronized in the dreary dearth of amusement on these\r\npleasure-grounds.\r\n\r\nTo the foreigner, after the sight has been seen a few times and\r\ndivested of its novelty, the whole thing becomes tedious in the\r\nextreme; but we must remember that in his tastes the Turk is the very\r\nopposite of the Western man, and what would be death to us is fun\r\nto him. His idea of true enjoyment is that it should be passive, not\r\nactive: his highest happiness is in \"keff,\" a perfect repose of mind\r\nand body--an exaggeration of the Italian _dolce far niente_. This keff\r\nhe enjoys at these weekly meetings, and the women in their way enjoy\r\nit too as the only public exposition of themselves they are permitted\r\nto make, and as a break in the monotony of their dreary and secluded\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nBut there is another mode of killing time there, evidently borrowed,\r\nas are the carriages, from Europe. The conveyances at intervals are\r\ndriven round a circular road in two long files, going and coming, to\r\npermit people to stare at each other, just as in London, Paris or New\r\nYork, minus the salutations to friends or conversation. As the poet\r\nsays of the stars--\r\n\r\n                     In silence all\r\n  Move round this dark terrestrial ball,\r\n\r\nthough the women, while sitting under the trees, chatter like magpies\r\nto one another. The etiquette is to recline languidly back in the\r\ncarriage and speak through the eyes alone to the mounted cavaliers,\r\nwho prance as near the carriages containing veiled inmates as the\r\nsable guards will permit, to the infinite amusement of Fatima and\r\nZuleika, and boundless wrath and disgust of Hassan or Mustapha, \"with\r\nhis long sword, saddle, bridle, etc.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of these carriages are so peculiar to the place and people as\r\nto merit description. One of these, the \"araba,\" is an heirloom\r\nfrom their old Tartar ancestry, and is only an exaggerated ox-cart\r\nwith seats, and a scaffolding of poles around it. Over these poles\r\nthere hangs a canopy of red to keep off the sun, and the seats are\r\nwell-stuffed cushions, making a kind of bed of the bottom of the\r\nwagon. Into this curious conveyance are piled promiscuously the\r\nmother, children and slaves of the establishment--packed in as tightly\r\nas possible; and the contrast of costumes, faces, colors and ages\r\nbetween its occupants may be imagined, but cannot be described. For a\r\ngenuine old-fashioned family carriage commend us to the araba.\r\n\r\nThis curious conveyance is drawn not by horses, but by white oxen,\r\nwhose broad fronts are pleasingly painted between the eyes bright red\r\nwith henna, the dye with which the Turkish ladies tinge their own fair\r\nhands and the soles of their feet. The oxen bear high wooden yokes\r\ncovered with fringes and tassels, and their tails are often looped up\r\nwith bright cords. Their pace, bearing their heavy burden of wood and\r\nflesh, is slow and stately, and the jolting of the springless wagon\r\nover the rough roads seemingly very severe. But the inmates seem\r\nused to their discomforts, and sit placidly and contentedly on their\r\nuneasy seats, apparently proud of their turn-out and the effect\r\nthey are producing. These cumbrous vehicles are much affected\r\nby the elder ladies of the sultan's court, who constitute the\r\nFaubourg-Saint-Germain portion of society. True old-school Turks\r\nthese, who look down with scorn on the new fashions, both in costume\r\nand carriage, stolen or adopted from the despised Franks.\r\n\r\nChief and most conspicuous of these latter is the small imitation\r\nbrougham or coupé, termed a \"teleki,\" and generally built at Paris\r\nregardless of cost, and resembling a Christian carriage about as\r\nnearly as the Turk resembles a European when he puts on a similar\r\ndress. The teleki is pumpkin-shaped, almost round, painted and gilded\r\nin the gayest colors, with large bunches of the brightest flowers\r\npainted on panels and on the glasses which shut it in all round. It\r\nis the most dazzling carriage the imagination of carriage-makers ever\r\ndevised, and well adapted to the taste of the grown-up children it is\r\nintended for, who, clad in raiments of rose-color, pink, bright blue\r\nor scarlet, seem a fit lining for the gorgeous exterior. Unlike the\r\nFrench carriage, the teleki has no springs; so the exercise these fair\r\nladies get is about equal to that of a ride on a hard-trotting horse.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity consists in the driver's dismounting from his box\r\nand walking gravely alongside the carriage, holding in his hands the\r\ncolored silken reins to guide the well-bred horses.\r\n\r\nOn horseback alongside prance the ill-favored eunuchs, ready to\r\nswear at or smite the insolent Frank venturing too near the moon-eyed\r\nbeauties in the teleki.\r\n\r\nAt these Sweet Waters the sultan has his own kiosk, a gilded\r\nmonstrosity of architecture, and at its window, worn, pallid, haggard,\r\ngazing out with lacklustre and indifferent eye upon the scene below,\r\nthis shadow of the Prophet might frequently be seen a few years since.\r\nIt was etiquette for him to come sometimes, so he did it as a duty,\r\nnot a pleasure; for the poor man had no pleasures, being the most\r\nutterly _blasé_ man in this wide world. The drawback on all his pomp\r\nand power is the condition annexed to it, that no one is worthy of\r\nhis society, and he must be ever alone, in public as in private. A\r\nrepresentative of the faith as well as of the loyalty of his people,\r\nno one can be supposed to meet or associate with him on terms\r\napproaching equality, and hence his isolation from human sympathy or\r\nsociety.[25]\r\n\r\nThe fountain is covered by a square roof, and all around it are marble\r\nslabs with Turkish inscriptions in gilt letters praising the virtues\r\nof the water. In that scriptural phraseology so common in the East you\r\nare notified that \"These waters are as sweet as those of the well of\r\nZemzem, of which Abraham drank, and like unto those of the rivers\r\nof Paradise to the hot and thirsty who come here to taste them.\" The\r\nwater was really very good water, but its praises struck us as rather\r\nhyperbolical, possibly because the Frank at Constantinople generally\r\ndrinks and prefers other and more potent beverages.\r\n\r\nBut drinking the water is the least part of the performance here, and,\r\nunlike Saratoga, \"flirtation around the spring\" is a thing undreamed\r\nof where the sexes, at peril of life and limb, dare not even\r\napproximate, much less exchange courtesies over the draught.\r\n\r\nThere is a narrow road which leads you away from this busy spot to\r\nthe sources of the fountains of these Sweet Waters. But road-making\r\nis not one of the triumphs of Turkish skill, and this is a very dirty\r\nand dusty road, full of holes which would smash the springs of any\r\nconveyances less primitive and strong than those in use. It is hedged\r\nin by fig trees growing to a size which would astonish those who have\r\nonly seen the dwarf trees of the species which we possess. Passing\r\nalong this road, we reach the inner valley. Here we find fewer people,\r\nbut the same astonishing variety of race and costume which makes the\r\nother so curious and characteristic. The richness of the silk and\r\nsatin dresses, all of the brightest colors, which adorn the women,\r\nand the gayly-embroidered jackets of the men, make the eyes ache which\r\ngaze upon them. Almost every specimen of the Eastern races may be\r\nseen here--all taking their pleasure in the same indolent way which\r\ndistinguishes Eastern enjoyment. The Circassian and Georgian women\r\nare certainly very beautiful, as far as regularity of features, bold\r\nflashing eyes and great symmetry of form can make them; but they lack\r\nexpression, the highest feminine charm, and softness is alien to those\r\nbold beauties. They remind you of Jezebel, and like her they \"paint\r\ntheir faces\" before going into public. Not only do they smear their\r\nfaces freely with white and red, but they also join together their\r\neyebrows by a thick black band of _kohl_, and with the same pigment\r\nblacken the lower lids of the eyes, giving a wicked and peculiar\r\nexpression to the eyes. The tips of the fingers are stained red\r\nwith henna; and without these appliances no Eastern woman deems her\r\ntoilette complete. Many of them would doubtless be exceedingly lovely\r\nwere they to let themselves alone, but Turkish taste requires these\r\nappliances, and an unpainted woman is a rarity.\r\n\r\nIt is an Eastern saying that a woman should be a load for a camel, and\r\nin deference to this taste they fatten themselves up until they become\r\nmountains of flesh. Where obesity is considered a charm, delicacy of\r\noutline ceases to be regarded, and a woman who has not rotundity is\r\nregarded as an unfortunate being. They are decidedly the greatest\r\ncollection of well-fed females to be seen in the world.\r\n\r\nThe task of the black guards who accompany these houris is anything\r\nbut a sinecure, and \"nods and becks and wreathed smiles\" are freely\r\nbestowed on the male passers-by in spite of etiquette and eunuchs. If\r\nthe scandalous chronicles of the coffee-shops and bazaars are to\r\nbe relied upon, \"Love laughs at locksmiths\" here as well as in more\r\ncivilized lands, and Danger and Opportunity wink at each other. There\r\nis far less decorum and outward reserve of manner here than in our\r\nparks, but this freedom is all confined to looks and gestures, access\r\nand converse being both forbidden.\r\n\r\nFrequently, however, the bad-tempered guardians of the hareem commit\r\noutrages on the persons of real or supposed aggressors in this way,\r\nand from these even members of the foreign embassies have not always\r\nbeen exempt. The difficulty of identifying the offender in such cases\r\nenhances the impunity of these wretches, for to arrest one on the spot\r\nwould be impossible in the midst of a crowd which sympathizes with\r\nthe offender, instead of the sufferer, and looks upon it as a proper\r\npunishment for the insolent Giaour. A private person unconnected with\r\nan embassy has still less chance for satisfaction, but must pocket the\r\naffront, even if smitten by whip or flat of sabre, considering himself\r\nfortunate to have escaped maiming or mutilation should he incautiously\r\ngive a pretext for Ethiopian or Nubian intervention.\r\n\r\nFew persons of foreign birth and training would go more than twice\r\nto visit the Sweet Waters of Asia, whose peculiarities and amusements\r\nhave been thus briefly sketched. The spectacle at the European Sweet\r\nWaters differs somewhat from the routine already described. There,\r\nalthough you also meet the Turks, the greater proportion of the\r\nvisitors are either Greeks or native Christians of different races.\r\nYou see fewer arabas and telekis, and more carriages, or rather hacks,\r\nand men galloping along on raw-boned horses in a kind of imitation\r\n\"Rotten-Row\" style. The men wear the European dress, often surmounted\r\nby the red fez: the women dress in an insane imitation of French\r\nfashions, and glitter with jewelry--a passion with Eastern women of\r\nall races and creeds. Frequently a woman carries her whole fortune\r\nand her husband's in these ornaments, which, in a country where the\r\ndifference between _meum_ and _tuum_ is so little observed by persons\r\nin authority, is regarded as the safest mode of investment.\r\n\r\nThe European Sweet Waters are rather more dull and less interesting\r\nthan the Asiatic, owing to the causes already described, nor is\r\ncompensation to be found in the superior beauty of the women; for,\r\nas a general rule, the Greek men are better looking than the women;\r\nand the intercourse between the sexes is regulated on the Eastern\r\nplan to a very great extent, though there is not the same absolute\r\nprohibition, nor the same peril attendant on the attempt to open an\r\nacquaintance. In all Eastern countries, however, the position and\r\ntreatment of woman are modified by the prevailing prejudice, which\r\nplaces her on a much lower level than the man, and deprives her of\r\nmost of the cherished privileges of her more favored Western sisters.\r\nIf the Turk has failed in forcing his religious faith on his Christian\r\nvassals, he has succeeded in fixing the social status of their women\r\non much the same basis as his own.\r\n\r\nThe day selected for visiting the European Sweet Waters by the native\r\nor Greek population is either Sunday or on the festival of some one\r\nof the many saints whose names are legion in the Greek calendar. Never\r\nwas there a people so fond of holidays, or who take them oftener under\r\nreligious pretexts. Yet they celebrate them in anything but a pious\r\nmanner. Their fasts are much fewer and not so punctiliously observed.\r\n\r\nAs the restriction on intoxicating beverages is not such a cardinal\r\narticle of faith at the European as at the Asiatic Sweet Waters,\r\nthat element enters into the diversions at the former place, to the\r\nfrequent scandal of the decorous and abstemious Turks. The fiery\r\nwines of Sicily and the Greek islands are freely indulged in, and\r\ntipsy cavaliers, caracoling on the hacks of Pera and Galata, are not\r\ninfrequent accessories, aggravating the danger and discomfort to the\r\nstranger of the return in carriage or on horseback. The roughness of\r\nthe road, its heat and dust, are bad enough; but to aggravate these\r\ndiscomforts you have a crowd of hacks and a swarm of cavaliers\r\npursuing the same route, with all the collisions inevitable from\r\nunskillful coachmen and tipsy riders. It is a long, dreary drive too,\r\nwith no scenery worth looking at on the route, even could you discern\r\nit through the dense clouds of dust which envelop you from its\r\ncommencement to its close. When you reach your hotel you take a bath\r\nto refresh yourself, and go down to supper, exclaiming with a sigh of\r\nrelief, \"Well, thank Heaven! I have seen the Sweet Waters!\"\r\n\r\nEDWIN DE LEON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: This rule was observed by Abdul Medjid, the late sultan,\r\nof whom I speak. It is said that his successor has broken through this\r\nrestriction to a considerable extent, and is a social being.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADEMOISELLE STYLITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe discussion between Mr. John Woodstock and his sister was becoming\r\nanimated, and their aunt, who never could understand the difference\r\nbetween a discussion and a quarrel, was listening anxiously, expecting\r\nevery moment to see Marjory flounce out of the room at one door, and\r\nJohn at the other, in their respective furies. It began in this way:\r\nJohn had just read a notice of an extraordinary concert to come off\r\nthe next week, and had pushed the paper over to Marjory, with the\r\nremark, \"Like to go, Peg?\"\r\n\r\n_She_. Of course I should like to go! You don't mean to say you have\r\ntickets for it? (Excitedly.)\r\n\r\n_He_. No, of course I don't: I am not a thief.\r\n\r\n_She_. No, you are only the next thing to it--a shabby fellow. Why did\r\nyou ask me in that way when you knew we couldn't go?\r\n\r\n_He_. How you do jump at lame and impotent conclusions! Who said we\r\ncould not go? I am sure I did not.\r\n\r\n_She_. John Woodstock, if you don't stop this, and tell me what you\r\nmean, I will never make you another shirt!\r\n\r\n_He_. Small loss! Of all mean things, a homemade shirt is the meanest;\r\nand why a man of my native nobility of character should be condemned\r\nto wear them--\r\n\r\n_Their aunt_ (distressedly). Children! children!--\r\n\r\n_He_ (soothingly). Never mind, aunty: she did not mean it. She would\r\nnot put it out of her power to say that she had made every shirt I\r\never wore for all the mines of Golconda.\r\n\r\n_She_. What a small potato you are!\r\n\r\n_He_. Now, my dear Marjory, how often must I tell you that calling a\r\nfellow names is not arguing? If you could keep from being abusive for\r\nfive minutes, you might hear of something to your advantage. I have\r\na little money, for a wonder, but it is like the turkey--too much for\r\none, and not enough for two. You cannot go by yourself, for it is an\r\nevening affair; but if you were not so frightfully vain about your\r\npersonal appearance, I think we could manage it. I heard you say\r\nyesterday that you had the money for a new pair of gloves: if you will\r\nsacrifice them, we can go, and in two weeks I can give you the gloves\r\nbesides. I can't before, for my princely income is at present heavily\r\nmortgaged. Can you furbish up your old ones till then, and thereby\r\nprove yourself sensible for once?\r\n\r\n_She_. You are a pretty good boy, after all; but really I have not a\r\ndecent pair to my name: that last pair of light ones got lemonade all\r\nover them, and it took the color out, of course.\r\n\r\n_He_. Now I'll tell you what! I can take them for you on my way down\r\ntown, and leave them to be dyed, and then you can do some fancy-work\r\non their backs; and what more do you want?\r\n\r\n_She_ (doubtfully). But would black gloves do?\r\n\r\n_He_ (conclusively). Of course they would for a thing like that. Fetch\r\nthem out, and be quick about it; and bring your money too, for I\r\nhad better buy the tickets this morning, and then we shall have some\r\nchoice as to seats.\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged. Marjory's lofty mind did wince a little at the\r\nidea of dyed gloves, but she tried not to think of it. John brought\r\nthe objectionable kids home in time for elaborate decoration \"on their\r\nbacks;\" but, as he watched her in the pauses of his reading aloud,\r\nthey both observed with anxiety that the black \"came off a little,\"\r\nand Marjory asked him to warn her if he saw her let them go anywhere\r\nnear her face.\r\n\r\nTwo children never enjoyed a holiday more than these two enjoyed that\r\nconcert. Dyed gloves and all other sublunary trials were forgotten:\r\nMarjory did not touch her face once; and when the happy evening was\r\nover, the gloves were put away with a loving pat on their backs, and\r\nJohn had risen ten degrees in Marjory's respect.\r\n\r\nIf those gloves had but rested on their laurels! But if people of\r\ngenius will not do that, can you expect it of dyed gloves? Few are the\r\nauthors who have not followed up a brilliant success with something\r\nvery like a failure, and Marjory's gloves seemed to catch the spirit\r\nof the times.\r\n\r\nBefore the two weeks were up which were to restore John to\r\ncomparatively easy circumstances, and Marjory to respectability so far\r\nas her hands went, John asked her to go with him to hear a lecture.\r\nJust about that time he was rather wild concerning natural history,\r\nfor which, I am sorry to say, Marjory did not care a pin. She\r\nindignantly repelled the idea of a gorilla somewhere toward the top of\r\nher family tree, asserting that she preferred to believe that she had\r\ndescended from so mean a man as Adam, and so curious a woman as Eve,\r\nto that: furthermore, she was indifferent upon the subject. But there\r\nwas not much she would not do to please John; so when he asked her to\r\ngo with him to hear a lecture about the gorilla, she made a face to\r\nherself, and said certainly she would.\r\n\r\nShe consented with rather better grace from the fact that Mr.\r\nPradamite--such was the lecturer's euphonious name--undertook to prove\r\nconclusively that man was _not_ descended from the gorilla; but when\r\nthe little old gentleman walked briskly upon the stage, she whispered\r\nJohn that he would have been a valuable advocate of the theory held\r\nby the other side: he wanted nothing but a little pointed felt hat,\r\nwith a feather in it, to look very much like a small edition of\r\nthe original gorilla reduced to earning his living by assisting a\r\nhand-organist.\r\n\r\nThe lecture, to John, was delightful--so clear, so logical, went so\r\nfar back, and so deep down, and so high up. \"Walked all around that\r\nfellow I heard last week on the other side,\" John said. But Marjory,\r\nwho had herself taken a long walk that afternoon, thought the whole\r\nthing unutterably stupid: her eyelids would drop, her neck felt\r\ndouble-jointed and would not stay erect. Fortunately, their seats\r\nwere far back, not very brilliantly lighted, and Marjory's had the\r\nadvantage of being next a pillar. John, however, considered this fact\r\nunfortunate, for he could not obtain a good view of the remarkable\r\nfigures with which the old gentleman was illustrating his lecture,\r\ntalking in spasmodic jerks as he drew, and when John saw a dear and\r\nscientific friend on a front seat, with a vacant place beside him, he\r\ncould not resist the temptation to take it. He looked at Marjory: she\r\nwas half asleep, but still contending bravely for the other half. He\r\nsurveyed their immediate neighbors--three strong-minded-looking women\r\njust behind them; a fatherly-looking old gentleman in the seat next\r\nhis own; a pillar protecting Marjory on the other side, and two highly\r\nrespectable-looking young men in the row of seats before them, who\r\nappeared to be listening intently and occasionally taking notes;\r\nat least, one of them was, and he submitted his note-book to the\r\ncriticism of the other, who smiled approvingly. The seats immediately\r\nin front of his own and Marjory's were vacant.\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind, Peggy,\" said John, deprecatingly, \"if I left you for\r\na few minutes? I can't half see what he is drawing, and there is a\r\nvacant front seat. I'll only stay five minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, dear,\" said Marjory with sleepy amiability: \"stay up\r\nthere till he has finished, and then come back for me. I am not at all\r\nafraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no: I will not do that,\" answered John, considerately, \"but I do\r\nwant to go for a few minutes.\" So away he went, and, once up there,\r\nhe of course \"took no note of time,\" and Marjory was left to her own\r\ndevices. These were few and simple, but small causes sometimes produce\r\ngreat effects. She had on those gloves, of course.\r\n\r\nShe never could recall that part of the evening very distinctly. A\r\nconfused recollection that she found the pillar very comfortable for a\r\nwhile; that finally the ridges in it hurt her cheek; that she had one\r\nor two lucid intervals between her naps, in one of which she concluded\r\nthat it would be better to take those gloves off for fear of marking\r\nher face; and that while she was doing so she caught a sentence or\r\ntwo of the lecture--something like this: \"This one essential point of\r\ndifference is in itself convincing proof of the theory which I hold.\r\nThe difference in the formation of the hands is a difficulty which\r\nno theory of development can overcome.\" These few insignificant items\r\nwere all which remained in her memory: then the little gentleman's\r\nvoice gradually took to her ears the form of a chant: his \"theory,\" as\r\nthe simple rustic said about a matter less abstruse, \"might be wrong,\r\nbut it was awful soothin',\" and pleasant dreams of having four hands,\r\nall available, and not of the objectionable sort whose bones the\r\nprofessor was dangling, beguiled the time for Marjory--how long she\r\nknew not.\r\n\r\nWhat woke her? Surely somebody laughed? She started up: the lecture\r\nwas over at last; John, with a penitent face, was hastening back to\r\nher; the people who had sat nearest her were gone, and so were her\r\ngloves!\r\n\r\n\"What, in thunder--\" said John forcibly, looking at her face in blank\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't mind,\" she answered mildly, thinking he was apologizing.\r\n\"I believe I have had a little nap, Jack, but I can't find my gloves:\r\nwill you look under the next seat, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear child,\" said John, shaking with suppressed laughter,\r\n\"your face has 'found your gloves' with a vengeance! It's as black\r\nas--anything. Can't you put your veil down till we get out of this?\"\r\n\r\nObediently hiding her countenance, Marjory, bewildered and still not\r\nquite awake, followed John after a few minutes' further and fruitless\r\nsearch for the missing gloves.\r\n\r\nThe brisk walk home through the frosty air restored her consciousness,\r\nand when John led her up to the looking-glass, kindly removing her\r\nveil at the same time, consciousness took the form of wrath.\r\n\r\n\"I _never_ could have done all that myself,\" she exclaimed\r\nindignantly. \"Why, I took those hateful gloves off, and put them on\r\nthe cushion; and it is just my belief that one of those dreadful boys\r\nin front of us--\"\r\n\r\n\"Boys!\" interrupted John. \"Those fellows were enough older than\r\nyou--or I either, for that matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" said Marjory, with tears of vexation in her brown\r\neyes. \"They behaved like boys, for when I woke--I mean just before\r\nyou came for me--I thought I heard somebody laugh, and then they were\r\ngone, and my gloves were gone too; and I just believe they managed to\r\nblacken my face somehow, and then stole my gloves.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I thought that--\" exclaimed John savagely; and then added in a\r\npuzzled tone, \"But how could they have done it, Peg, unless you were\r\nsleeping like a rock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I believe I was,\" answered the young woman candidly, \"for I was\r\ntired to death, and couldn't understand half the gorilla said.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was all my fault for dragging you there, and then leaving you,\"\r\nsaid John, his penitence making him overlook this glaring disrespect\r\nto his hobby and its rider. \"But those fellows looked like gentlemen;\r\nand besides, I know who that old man was who sat next me, and I am\r\nsure he would not have let any such trick be played right under his\r\nnose without stopping it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can think what you please,\" said Marjory, a little crossly, for\r\nher naturally good temper had been severely tried, \"but nothing will\r\never make me believe it was not those boys.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSome weeks had elapsed since that sorrowful result of praiseworthy\r\neconomy. Marjory's feelings had been soothed by a pair of tan-colored\r\nkids, three-buttoned, stitched on the backs, accompanied by a\r\nglove-buttoner and a hug from John. The mention of dyed gloves still\r\nraised a flush on her round cheeks and painful recollections in her\r\nheart, but she was beginning to banish the sore subject from her mind,\r\nand to half smile to herself when she did think of it; for, in spite\r\nof the enormity of the supposed offence, the vision of her remarkable\r\nappearance when John raised her veil before the glass was too much for\r\nher risibles as it grew more and more retrospective. For she was one\r\nof those happy mortals who cannot help seeing a joke, even when it\r\npoints their way.\r\n\r\nShe came down stairs one evening arrayed in her best bib and tucker,\r\nand was speedily joined by John, whose appearance likewise indicated\r\nsome approaching festivity--all but his face, which wore a rather\r\ndisgusted expression. \"What a bore parties are!\" said that world-weary\r\nindividual from the height of his twenty-third year.\r\n\r\n\"That depends,\" answered Marjory with the superior wisdom of eighteen.\r\n\"If one meets bright people, they are not a bore. And I'll give you\r\nsome advice, Jack: don't always take it for granted that the girls\r\ncan only talk gossip and fashions. Take it for granted that they have\r\nat least as much sense as you have, and talk about something worth\r\nwhile.\"\r\n\r\n\"The descent of man, for instance?\" suggested John, somewhat\r\nmischievously. \"From the interest _you_ take in that, I've no doubt\r\nthe rest of the girls would be charmed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that thing somebody said about the man of one book?\" asked\r\nMarjory, looking abstracted.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know,\" replied John--\"never met him.\"\r\n\r\nThe party was about as lively and about as stupid as parties generally\r\nare. There was a little pleasant music, a little innocent \"square\r\ndancing,\" a very well-ordered supper, and a good deal of conversation.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the evening the hostess came to Marjory. \"My\r\ndear,\" she said, \"I have a young friend here whom I wish to introduce\r\nto you and your brother: he told me he had heard of John's interest\r\nin scientific matters, and as he has just come to live in the city, he\r\nhas not many acquaintances. He is a very nice fellow. I know all about\r\nhim, and I want him to have a few pleasant visiting-places: I always\r\nfeel so sorry for a young man away from his family in a large city.\r\nMay I bring him and introduce him to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, if he is not stupid,\" said Marjory, smiling. \"There is\r\nJohn: I will make him come here before you have captured your young\r\nman, and then we can be introduced together.\".\r\n\r\nJohn, however, was talking biology or protoplasm or something else to\r\nan interested listener on the other side of the room, and was blind\r\nto all Marjory's \"nods and becks and wreathèd smiles.\" So, when the\r\namiable old lady returned with her prize, whom she appeared to\r\nhave \"captured\" without either difficulty or delay, Marjory had\r\nthe introduction all to herself. She was not one of those wonderful\r\ninventions, a girl who can meet a man's eyes with a steady stare,\r\nand for the first few minutes after their hostess left them she only\r\nnoticed that her new acquaintance looked and spoke like a gentleman,\r\nthat he had a very pleasant voice, and that, without being pedantic,\r\nhe was not talking nonsense. Imagine the sensation which took place\r\nin her head when, at some bright speech from her antagonist--for they\r\nhad immediately fallen into an argument--she raised her laughing eyes\r\nto his face, and saw--one of the youths who had fallen under her\r\nrighteous indignation on the memorable night of the gorilla lecture!\r\nMarjory had what are called \"speaking eyes.\" It afflicted her greatly\r\nthat, no matter what the emergency, her feelings would appear in\r\nher face; so--although she struggled hard to go on as if nothing had\r\nhappened, resolving, after a hasty mental review of the situation,\r\nto behave as if she had never seen him before, and upon better\r\nacquaintance demand the truth if she liked him, and let him severely\r\nalone if she did not--anybody could have seen her countenance change,\r\nand to her intense chagrin she felt herself blushing. To make matters\r\nworse, he blushed too, and over his intelligent face flitted just the\r\nshadow of a smile.\r\n\r\nThis was too much! Marjory fanned herself vigorously, and hazarded an\r\noriginal observation in a constrained voice. \"Don't you think it is\r\nvery warm here?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Very!\" replied the student of nature. \"Shall we walk in the hall for\r\na few minutes?\" and he offered her his arm. She rested the tips of\r\nher fingers on his sleeve, and they proceeded to walk up and down the\r\nhall, she being saved only by her escort from collision with various\r\nother couples similarly employed. This interesting exercise lasted for\r\nsome minutes, varied by attempts at conversation which were about as\r\nnatural as spasms. Marjory took a desperate resolution. This absurd\r\nstate of things should not last much longer, if she could help it. \"I\r\nnever could act as if nothing was the matter when something was,\" she\r\nbegan, \"and I can't help it if this is not polite; but I think, from\r\nwhat Mrs. Grove said about you, that you will tell me the truth if I\r\nask you something. Will you?\" and she looked up once more.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I will,\" he answered gravely, meeting her glance with\r\nsteady, honest eyes, and somehow, short as their acquaintance had\r\nbeen, she believed him.\r\n\r\nShe had meant to ask him deliberately if he or his companion, or both,\r\nhad stolen her gloves and decorated her face, but she felt unable to\r\ndo that with those eyes on hers; so she changed her tactics, and said,\r\nrather meekly, considering what her former feelings had been: \"Will\r\nyou please tell me exactly what happened the evening that man lectured\r\nabout the gorilla, and you sat nearly in front of my brother and me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was your brother, then?\" he said quickly, and then stopped,\r\nlooking a little foolish.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered, with a surprised glance at his face; \"but you\r\nsaid you would answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he replied. \"I will, of course, and I know you\r\nwill believe me. After your brother left you, you leaned your head\r\nagainst the pillar, and then, as if the grooving hurt your face, you\r\nput your hand between; and then--I must apologize for my apparent\r\nimpoliteness, but I promised to tell the truth;\" and he smiled a\r\nlittle--\"then you seemed to fall fast asleep. A mosquito lit on your\r\nnose, and woke you. When you raised your head, your cheek was quite\r\nblack from your glove; you rubbed your nose and made that black too;\r\nthen you went to sleep again, and directly a curl of your hair fell\r\nover your other cheek, and woke you again, and you gave your cheek\r\na little slap, thinking, I suppose, that the mosquito had come back:\r\nthat left the mark of your fingers, and you rubbed it a little and\r\nmade it yet blacker. Then you took your gloves off and fell asleep\r\nagain; and then--you will believe now that I am telling you 'the\r\ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,' for I am risking\r\nyour displeasure by telling what came next;\" and he flushed up to his\r\nhair--\"I made up my mind that it was my duty to secure those gloves,\r\nand prevent thereby the possibility of such an accident in the future.\r\nSo I put my arm over the back of the seat carelessly, and when nobody\r\nwas looking I picked them up and pocketed them. It was not I who\r\nlaughed, but my brother, who did not notice your face--after you\r\nhad blackened it, that is--until he rose to go, when he laughed\r\ninvoluntarily, and I collared him and took him off. Now you know all\r\nabout it, and I await my sentence. Can you forgive me for stealing\r\nyour gloves? The motive at least was good.\"\r\n\r\nMarjory's face had cleared as this highly circumstantial narrative\r\nprogressed, and when it was finished she looked up smiling. \"Yes,\" she\r\nsaid, \"I quite forgive you: the motive is everything. But do please\r\ntell me, were you really so interested in what that little gorilla\r\nsaid as you seemed to be? You were taking notes, you know--I saw that\r\nbefore I went to sleep. Now what was there that was worth making a\r\nnote of? I am sure I heard nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to see my notes?\" he asked, drawing a little book from\r\nhis waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if they are not long,\" she answered doubtfully; \"but Jack will\r\ntell you how stupid I am on all such subjects as that.\"\r\n\r\nHe placed the book in her hand, open, and she saw a clever sketch\r\nof herself and the pillar: underneath was written, \"Mademoiselle\r\nStylites.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you draw that?\" she asked, smiling in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied, answering her smile. \"I am fond of sketching from\r\nnature.\" Then, as he glanced at the picture, he added hastily, \"I\r\nforgot that absurd inscription: George, my brother, did that.\"\r\n\r\nMarjory did not look deeply offended, even at the \"absurd\r\ninscription;\" and the conversation continued, upon different and\r\nindifferent subjects, until John bethought himself of his duty, and\r\ncame to find her. She introduced her squire to him, and after a few\r\nminutes more of pleasant conversation they separated, Mr. Owen--such\r\nwas the natural philosopher's name--having received John's assurance\r\nof a speedy call upon him, and given his address with an alacrity\r\nwhich proved, John thought, that they were kindred spirits.\r\n\r\nAs they walked home, John suddenly exclaimed, \"You know I never\r\nremember faces, Peg, but somehow I feel as if I had seen that fellow\r\nbefore. He's an uncommonly good fellow, and Mrs. Grove says he is very\r\nfond of my hobby, as you call it, so I shall go to see him soon.\"\r\n\r\nOf course Marjory gave him an outline of her evening's adventure \"upon\r\nthis hint,\" and he laughed heartily at the whole thing, assuring\r\nher that _he_ had never believed for a moment in such an absurd\r\npossibility as she had fancied.\r\n\r\nWell, what of it all? Nothing particular. Mr. Owen and John are fast\r\nfriends by this time. Marjory is beginning to take an interest in\r\nnatural history. Also, she has lost all faith in conviction upon\r\ncircumstantial evidence. She is \"o'er young to marry yet,\" her aunt\r\nthinks, and so do I of course, for this is not a love-story: I wish\r\nthat to be distinctly understood.\r\n\r\nMARGARET VANDEGRIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY OF MASSABIELLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a mild and pleasant day in the middle of February, and the\r\nbright sunlight streamed through the windows of the poor little room\r\nwhere Madame Soubirons sat alone. The table, with its dishes neatly\r\narranged for the noonday meal, stood in the middle of the room. A pot\r\nhung in the large fireplace, and a skillet sat upon the few remaining\r\ncoals. There was nothing with which to replenish the fire, and Madame\r\nSoubirons sat gazing at the flickering embers with a rueful face. \"A\r\ncold hearth is more chilling than the mountains,\" she said; and she\r\nrose and went out of the poor little apartment, which, with all its\r\npoverty, would not have been cheerless had a bright fire glowed upon\r\nthe neatly-kept hearth, and sat down upon the doorstep, where the\r\nsunlight fell warmly.\r\n\r\nFrom this position was afforded a view of a picturesque and romantic\r\nlandscape, presenting in the foreground a portion of the quaint\r\nvillage of Lourdes, with the cross of the old church brightly gleaming\r\nin the sunlight above the thickly-clustered cottage roofs. Farther\r\naway stood the great mill, and grimly from its rocky seat frowned\r\nthe ancient castle, of which the people of Lourdes never wearied of\r\ntelling that it had been besieged by Charlemagne centuries ago. In the\r\ndistance glanced the river Gave, fighting its rock-riven way to the\r\nsea. The prospect, growing continually more grand as it receded, was\r\nfinally hedged about by the majestic Pyrenees, which lifted their\r\nglimmering snows against the pale winter sky.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Soubirons was familiar with these scenes, and had no eyes\r\nfor them. She sat leaning her cheek upon her hand, and as she glanced\r\ndown the crooked walk she murmured, \"They have had time to get back,\r\nif they hurried as I charged them.\" Presently a cheery whistle rang\r\nout upon the air, and looking up she saw a man in miller's dress\r\napproaching. It was Jean Soubirons, her husband, coming home to\r\ndinner. She waited until he arrived, and they then went into the\r\nhouse together.\r\n\r\n\"Can you eat a cold dinner to-day, Jean?\" she asked. \"I have only\r\nbread and milk to give you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with thanks, Louise,\" he replied; \"but where are Bernadette and\r\nMarie?\"\r\n\r\n\"They went with Jeanne Abadie to gather fagots, but they should have\r\nbeen back long since. You might then have had a warm dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"All is well if they come to no harm, but it is somewhat chilly for\r\nour Bernadette.\"\r\n\r\n\"I gave her a pair of stockings to wear. She can't go like Marie, poor\r\nchild! who can hardly endure her sabots, even in winter. But I do not\r\nsee what detains them.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down and ate in silence, the two vacant places seeming to\r\nfill them with a feeling of desolation.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry,\" said Jean Soubirons as he rose from the table, \"that\r\nI am so poor a man that my little girls must bring the wood for the\r\npot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we shall be richer some day, Jean,\" said Louise, as if she\r\nhad hope.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so--in heaven,\" said he sadly, \"where there are no poor;\" and\r\nhe went back to his work.\r\n\r\nMeantime the three girls had been wandering. Of the two sisters, Marie\r\nwas rosy and strong, but Bernadette pale and delicate, being afflicted\r\nwith asthma. Bernadette appeared to be only ten years old, but was\r\nfourteen. Previous to this time almost all her life had been passed\r\naway from home, she having lived at Bastres with a friend of her\r\nmother, where she had been provided with a home for the small sum of\r\nfive francs a month and her service in tending the sheep: she was not\r\nstrong enough for more laborious work. Here Bernadette lived a calm\r\nand uneventful life, her duties causing her to be much in solitude,\r\nwhich she whiled away in petting her lambs. Very often the time had\r\nbeen set when she was to return home, but it was as often postponed.\r\nHer friends at Bastres could not bear to give her up, and year after\r\nyear she had lingered with them. She had been at home only two weeks\r\nupon that day when she went with Jeanne and Marie to gather sticks.\r\n\r\nThe three girls, dressed in their black woolen frocks, white capulets\r\nand wooden shoes--Bernadette alone having stockings, in consideration\r\nof her health--trudged on, enjoying the pure air. They crossed the\r\nbridge of the Gave, passed the mill and went on through the meadow,\r\nturning their steps toward the grotto of Massabielle, which was not\r\nfar distant. There are, properly speaking, several grottoes in the\r\nrocks of Massabielle, which consist of numerous excavations formed by\r\nNature in the great crags. One of these, however, is usually referred\r\nto as \"The Grotto,\" and is a cavern of quite extensive dimensions,\r\nbeing about thirteen feet high by fifty wide. There are two other\r\nexcavations in the rock above this cavern, one of which rudely\r\nresembles the broken window of a ruined church--suggesting that idea\r\nthe more forcibly perhaps from the fact that it admits light into the\r\nlower cavern.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching the entrance of the grotto, however, there was a\r\nsmall stream to be crossed. There was no bridge, but this was only a\r\nslight hindrance to Jeanne and Marie, who took off their shoes, and,\r\nspringing from stone to stone, were soon over. They were in advance of\r\nBernadette, who stopped frequently to cough, and when she came up to\r\nthe stream they were putting on their wooden shoes.\r\n\r\n\"How cold the water is!\" she heard one say, and she hesitated to\r\nstep into the cold stream. Jeanne saw her pausing upon the brink,\r\nand called out, \"Cross as we did: give long leaps and come over.\" She\r\ncalled to them then to throw stones in for her to step upon, but they\r\nwere busily engaged piling up sticks, and paid no attention to her, so\r\nshe began to pull off her shoes and stockings. When she bent down she\r\nheard a great rushing sound, as of the water and the wind. It seemed\r\nas if a great storm were breaking, but when she looked up all was\r\ncalm. The leaves scarcely stirred in the breeze, and the trails of ivy\r\nthat hung over the rocky windows of the grotto swayed gently to and\r\nfro. So she proceeded to pull off her stockings unalarmed. After a few\r\nseconds the noise increased, and when Bernadette again looked up she\r\nsaw a beautiful vision standing in the window or upper entrance of the\r\ngrotto, which was filled with the lustre of its halo. The apparition\r\nwas dressed in pure white, and bore a chaplet upon its arm, and had no\r\nresemblance to Bernadette's ideal of the Virgin. The child was filled\r\nwith awe, but felt no fear, and reverently kneeling she continued to\r\ngaze at the vision, which smiled upon her and made the sign of the\r\ncross. Bernadette did likewise. The appearance then vanished, and\r\nfor some time Bernadette remained spell-bound and still kneeling and\r\ngazing abstractedly into the grotto, from which the luminous quality\r\nhad faded. After a short time she recovered from her transport, and\r\nlooking around her found the appearance of nothing changed. The stream\r\nrushed on, the trees were the same, and in the hollow of the grotto\r\nthe wild brier grew in its accustomed place, and the clinging moss and\r\nthe ivy trails were unchanged.\r\n\r\nBernadette made her way across the stream as quickly as she could,\r\nand hastening onward soon overtook Marie and Jeanne, who looked up\r\nin surprise at her haste. When she had reached them their surprise\r\ndeepened into wonder as they observed the emotion depicted in her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen nothing?\" inquired Bernadette, her eyes all aglow with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"No: what is it?\" said Marie.\r\n\r\n\"It is something strange,\" said Bernadette.\r\n\r\n\"It could not have been stranger than you look now, with your staring\r\neyes and your flying hair,\" said Jeanne.\r\n\r\n\"What have you seen, Bernadette?\" asked Marie.\r\n\r\n\"Some one in white, bright and gleaming,\" said Bernadette.\r\n\r\n\"What did it do? Describe it,\" exclaimed Jeanne.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot describe it. If you haven't seen it, I can't tell you what\r\nit was like,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe two other girls were frightened. \"Will it hurt us?\" asked Marie.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid of such things,\" said Jeanne: \"let us hurry home as fast\r\nas we can.\"\r\n\r\nBernadette was not afraid, but, habitually passive, she hurried with\r\nthem without protest. When they arrived at home she told her mother\r\nher experience, and Madame Soubirons, being incredulous, attempted to\r\nconvince Bernadette that her vision was only a creature of her fancy;\r\nbut with no avail. The child was silenced, but not convinced. Madame\r\nSoubirons said she would not allow her daughter to go to the grotto\r\nany more, as it filled her with such ideas; and she expected to\r\nhear no more about the matter. But the next day Bernadette talked\r\nincessantly of her \"Dame,\" and on the following day, when some one\r\ninquired what her vision was like, she replied that she had seen\r\nsuch a face at church; and on the third day, which was Sunday, she\r\nprevailed upon her mother to allow her to go to the grotto again.\r\n\r\nMarie and Jeanne accompanied her as before. Having arrived at the\r\ngrotto, Bernadette knelt before the aperture: Marie and Jeanne\r\nfollowed her example, and when they turned to look at her they were\r\namazed at her appearance. She seemed to be transfigured. Her face\r\nwas radiant. With her eyes fixed, her lips partly open and her hands\r\nclasped, she appeared to listen with the greatest attention. Her\r\ncompanions were frightened by her strange behavior, and implored her\r\nto rise and go home with them.\r\n\r\n\"Bernadette, get up! Come: we are afraid of you when you look so\r\nstrange.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to hear them no more than if she had been a statue, and for\r\na few moments the group remained silent and motionless. There was\r\nno sound except the swirling of the stream and the rustling of the\r\nleaves, and to Marie and Jeanne the very silence seemed to be a spell\r\nof enchantment. Presently the rapturous light died out of the face\r\nof Bernadette, and she appeared as usual, much to the relief of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival at home the same story was told by Bernadette as\r\nbefore, and again it was disbelieved. No restriction was placed upon\r\nher going to the grotto, however, and she continued to visit it,\r\nwhen her vision arose before her again and again. In course of time\r\nthe singular event became much talked about, especially among the\r\npeasantry of that vicinity, who believed implicitly that the Virgin\r\nMary appeared to the child.\r\n\r\nPeople began to accompany Bernadette upon her visits to the grotto,\r\nand the number and interest of her observers daily increased. Many\r\nwho were entirely skeptical went for the purpose of gratifying their\r\ncuriosity. Among this class were Madame Millet and Mademoiselle\r\nAntoinette Peyret, who accompanied the little girl one day with the\r\nintention of questioning her after they had studied her conduct.\r\nOn this occasion she excited their suspicions by leading them by an\r\nunaccustomed route down a steep and rocky path, where they had great\r\ndifficulty in following her. They finally arrived at the grotto, and\r\nwere astounded to observe the change that came over her. She seemed to\r\nbe in a state of ecstatic awe.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were so solemnly impressed by her appearance that they felt\r\ndeep regret for having intruded upon so reverent a scene.\r\n\r\n\"It is a profanation for us to be here,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"You must remain,\" said Bernadette immediately, as if she had been\r\ndirected to stop them.\r\n\r\n\"Ask who she is,\" exclaimed Madame Millet, greatly excited. \"Here,\r\ntake this card and pencil, and beg of her that she will write down her\r\nwishes.\"\r\n\r\nBernadette took them, and the ladies heard her repeat the request as\r\nshe approached the excavation and the divine radiance lighted up her\r\nface. She paused, and for several moments remained in an apparent\r\nstate of rapture: then she returned to them, and in reply to their\r\ninquiries said that her \"Dame\" had said that she saw no necessity to\r\nwrite her wishes, for she knew Bernadette would obey.\r\n\r\n\"Obey what?\" asked Mademoiselle Peyret. \"What did she command you to\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"To come to meet her at the grotto every day for fifteen days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why.\"\r\n\r\n\"But did she not say anything more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"She promised that if I did so I should be happy in a future world.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Millet and Mademoiselle Peyret went home mystified. The story\r\nof their futile attempt to discover deception in Bernadette got\r\nabroad, \"and still the wonder grew.\" The interest in the visions\r\nintensified, and vast crowds, numbered not by tens, but by hundreds,\r\nassembled to watch Bernadette during the appointed fifteen days. The\r\nentire population of Lourdes appeared to be included in the crowd.\r\nThe presence of this observing multitude exerted no influence whatever\r\nupon Bernadette, who passed among them as they made way for her\r\nwithout looking to the right or to the left, as if she had too great\r\nthoughts on her mind to give any heed to the people. Day after day\r\nshe repeated her visits, kneeling in her accustomed place and giving\r\nherself up to a state of ecstasy.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, so great had become the popular excitement over\r\nthe child, the attention of the authorities was attracted by it.\r\nAccordingly, M. Massy, prefect of the commune, and M. Jacomet,\r\ncommissaire de police, conferred together, and decided to arrest\r\nBernadette as an impostor. It was on the 11th of February, 1858, when\r\nthe girl had her first vision, and about ten days thereafter, in\r\nthe presence of a great crowd, a police-officer approached her, and\r\nlaying his hand upon her shoulder took her to the commissaire for\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nImagine this simple and artless child boldly confronting\r\nthe commissaire, who must have been, in her eyes, a person of high\r\ndignity! M. Jacomet plied her with questions and cross-questions,\r\nand used all his power to implicate her in some inconsistency or\r\ncontradiction; but his efforts were futile, and he was obliged to\r\nconfess that he could not make out any case against the child, whom\r\nhe allowed to go home. Still, his dignity required some show of\r\nauthority; so he commanded Jean Soubirons that he should not permit\r\nBernadette to go to the grotto of Massabielle, under penalty of\r\nimprisonment. Then he wrote to M. Rouland, minister of public\r\ninstruction, for advice.\r\n\r\nSoubirons kept his daughter at home for a day or two: then, observing\r\nher to grieve under the restraint, decided to risk the wrath of M.\r\nJacomet, and allowed her to go where she wished. The people upheld\r\nSoubirons, and the crowds at the grotto assembled again. It was then\r\nproposed by some to consult Peyramale, the curé, who was known to\r\ndiscredit the stories of Bernadette, and it was thought might disabuse\r\nher mind of its illusions or detect her imposture, as the case might\r\nbe; but Peyramale would not make any efforts in that direction.\r\nHowever, Bernadette, of her own accord, came to him one day, saying\r\nshe wished to speak to him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the daughter of the miller Soubirons?\" asked Peyramale.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, monsieur le curé,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"What is it you wish?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to say that the Lady who appears to me in the grotto of\r\nMassabielle--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, child!\" interrupted Peyramale. \"Do not repeat this foolish tale\r\nto me. You have stirred the whole country round with the story of your\r\nvision, but do not bring such tales to me. What do you mean by this?\r\nI tell you, child, the Virgin sees you now, and if you practice\r\nimposture the door of heaven will be for ever shut against you.\"\r\n\r\nBernadette was in no wise disturbed, and resumed her narrative without\r\nfaltering.\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is the name of your vision?\" asked Peyramale\r\nwhen she had told him the story of her experience.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Was it the Virgin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say that it was the Virgin,\" said Bernadette, \"but I know\r\nthat I see her as plainly as I see you now, and she speaks to me\r\ndistinctly; and she commanded me to say to you that she wishes a\r\nchurch to be built on the rock of Massabielle.\"\r\n\r\nPeyramale was astonished at the strange language and the firmness of\r\nthe child, and replied: \"Your story, Bernadette, is beyond reason:\r\nstill, your manner is honest. Do not give yourself up, I pray you,\r\nto an illusion of your mind. You have some fancy, it may be, that\r\ndeceives you. The Virgin could command me as well as yourself. You\r\nsay there is a brier growing in the grotto: if your vision wants me to\r\nbuild a church on the cliff, tell her she must first cause that brier\r\nto bring forth roses in this winter season.\"\r\n\r\nHaving received this reply, Bernadette withdrew. When she next saw\r\nher vision she delivered the message of Peyramale, but it was not\r\nregarded. The apparition commanded her to go as far as she could on\r\nher hands and knees, and when Bernadette had done so, to the great\r\nwonder of her observers she was commanded to drink. She rose, and was\r\nabout to go to the stream, when the vision called her back and told\r\nher to drink of the fountain, not of the stream. Now, there was no\r\nfountain, but Bernadette instinctively dug a small hole in the earth\r\nwith her hands, and a very small stream of water flowed forth from\r\nthe earth and filled it. She dipped some up with her hands and drank.\r\nThis little stream continued to flow, and increased in size. On the\r\nfollowing day it was many times its original size. Travelers are to\r\nthis day shown the stream near the grotto of Massabielle, which, it is\r\ndeclared, thus sprang from a miraculous source. Three hundred people\r\nare declared to have seen this miracle, and in different regions\r\nof France many people may still be found who declare that they were\r\npresent upon that occasion.\r\n\r\nAfter this, still greater crowds flocked to the grotto of Massabielle,\r\nand again the authorities interfered. MM. Massy and Jacomet for a long\r\ntime waged their war with the people until the emperor telegraphed,\r\nordering that all interference should be stopped. Thus the people\r\nwere left in peaceful possession of their fountain, and reports of its\r\nmarvelous cures filled all the papers, and visitors came from far and\r\nnear, bringing cans and bottles to fill at the wondrous stream.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Peyramale had demanded that the brier\r\nshould blossom before a church should be built. In spite of his\r\ndecision there now stands not far from the grotto a church that has\r\nalready cost two and a half millions of francs, though not completed,\r\nand numerous convents are projected to occupy sites in the vicinity.\r\nA statue of the Virgin stands in the grotto where the vision appeared,\r\nand on the rock are hung numerous crutches and staffs, which it is\r\nclaimed were left there by those cripples whom the waters of the\r\nspring have healed.\r\n\r\nBernadette became day by day an object of still greater interest--in\r\nsome cases of reverence. Many offers were made to provide for herself\r\nand her family, but they were declined, and both her parents died\r\npoor, her mother so late as December 18, 1866. Marie Soubirons and\r\na brother, it is said, still live at Lourdes, but Bernadette became\r\na Sister of Charity, and is now an inmate of the Hospice of Nevers,\r\nunder the name of Sister Marie Bernard. At this institution she took\r\nthe veil, and she occupies herself, when health admits, in tending\r\nthe sick. She lives a life of great seclusion, and is almost utterly\r\nignorant of all that occurs outside the hospice walls. From the letter\r\nof a graphic writer I quote as follows: \"She is now twenty-five. She\r\nis not beautiful in feature, but in expression. Her look has a soft,\r\nmelting attraction. She is a great sufferer, and is tried by cruel\r\npains in her chest, which she bears very patiently, saying the Virgin\r\ntold her she should be happy in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in October, 1872, a cable despatch from Paris appeared in\r\nall the dailies, announcing that fifty thousand pilgrims were then\r\njourneying through France toward Lourdes. Their object was to\r\nassemble at the grotto of Massabielle to pray for the salvation and\r\nregeneration of France, so lately desolated by war. A large proportion\r\nof the pilgrims came from Paris, where their journey had been\r\ninaugurated by services at Notre Dame des Victoires. Indeed, it may\r\nbe said that their entire journey was one long religious service, for\r\nlitanies were chanted unceasingly upon the route. The grand service\r\nat the grotto took place October 6th, when five bishops conducted mass\r\nand vespers at five altars reared among the rocks; and other services\r\nwere conducted at numerous chapels and shrines among the mountains for\r\nmiles around by various pilgrim priests. A sermon was delivered to the\r\ngreat host by the bishop of Tarbes, the subject being the disasters\r\nof the nation. He closed by exhorting them to patriotism. Raising his\r\narms to the multitude, he asked, \"Will you promise to serve and love\r\nyour country as I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes! yes!\" answered the vast host in thunderous response.\r\n\r\n\"Will you cry 'Vive la France!' as children should who have been\r\nnurtured from the breast of a cherishing mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vive la France!\" resounded from rock and valley.\r\n\r\nThen turning toward the statue of the Virgin, the bishop cried, \"Vive\r\nthe Church, the Rock of Ages!\" Again the mighty voice of the crowd\r\nresponded, and with the final cry of \"Vive the Holy Father, Pius IX.!\"\r\nthe assemblage broke up.\r\n\r\nProbably there were no scenes incidental to the pilgrimage more\r\nimposing than its processions, formed in the public square of Lourdes.\r\nOne of them was a mile long, and the van had entered the meadow\r\nbefore the rear had left the square. It was composed of people of all\r\nclasses, who sang hymns as with one mighty voice. It bore banners of\r\nviolet, green, rose, blue and other colors, magnificently decorated\r\nwith gilding, paintings and embroidery. These banners numbered nearly\r\nthree hundred, and came from various parts of the country. Even\r\nfar-off Algeria was represented. The banner of Alsace and Lorraine\r\nwas in mourning, and was borne by girls in white. As it passed many\r\npersons pressed forward to kiss its hanging tassels. The banner from\r\nNantes was so profusedly embellished with gold and other decorations\r\nthat six strong men labored to support it; and those from Paris,\r\nBordeaux, Rheims, Lille, etc. were not greatly inferior to it in\r\nelegance. The sun shone brightly, and with the grandeur of the banners\r\nand the pomp of the prelates in their rich sacerdotal robes formed a\r\nscene of indescribable splendor.\r\n\r\nAt the farther end of the meadow or valley an altar had been erected.\r\nHere the banners drew up in a vast semicircle enclosing the great\r\naudience, and vespers were sung, after which the fifty thousand\r\nworshipers knelt and received the benediction, which was pronounced by\r\neight bishops simultaneously. The services before the altar being thus\r\nconcluded, the bearers of the banners again formed in procession for\r\nthe purpose of carrying them to the church upon the rock, in which\r\nthey were to be placed. At this time the sun was sinking behind the\r\nblue Pyrenean peaks, and as it threw its last red gleams upon the\r\nsplendid train that wound in and out along the craggy mountain-path\r\nit lighted up a picture of resplendent glory. As fast as the banners\r\narrived at the church they were placed upon its walls, which were soon\r\ncompletely covered with their gorgeous hangings. Owing to the length\r\nof the procession, it was after sunset when the last banner had been\r\nplaced in the church, which, with its brilliant adornments flashing\r\nin the blaze of wax tapers, was one grand glow of glittering splendor.\r\nAfter a brief service of thanksgiving the congregation withdrew,\r\nand descended the mountain in the light of bonfires that burned upon\r\nnumerous cliffs.\r\n\r\nA spectacle of equal brilliancy, though less pompous, was presented by\r\nthe grand torchlight procession which formed one evening in the square\r\nof Lourdes, where all were provided with candles. Thirty thousand\r\npersons were in this procession. They marched to the grotto of\r\nMassabielle and to the church upon the rock, moving slowly and singing\r\nhymns. As they moved they formed a great stream of glittering light,\r\nwhich rolled on and on and up and up, across the meadow and up the\r\nsinuous mountain-path. This impressive display lasted until midnight,\r\nwhen the greater number of the lights had died out and their bearers\r\nretired. But a goodly company still remained in the crypt of the\r\nchurch at prayer, in some instances fighting off sleep by marching up\r\nand down in companies, chanting night-prayers.\r\n\r\nThus a nation's ardent worshipers assembled in devotion at the spot\r\nsanctified by the visions of Bernadette Soubirons. And what shall we\r\nsay of her? Her professed visions cannot be set aside as impostures\r\nagainst the voice of thousands whose skepticism, as great as ours,\r\nhas been abashed. It could not have been in the nature of this artless\r\nchild, unencouraged and alone, to have been an impostor. Such would\r\nhave been a rôle thoroughly foreign to her character. Perhaps there\r\nmay have been illusion, a self-nourished fancy, evoked from the silent\r\nreveries of those solitary days at Bastres, when her mind was for long\r\nperiods given up to undisturbed imaginings. Who can say?\r\n\r\nWILLIAM D.

Then why didn't he let me know by letter, as I\r\nasked him to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say, really.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place in the main street of the extraordinary\r\ncity of Lugston--a city so very peculiar that I must give it an entire\r\narticle some day.\r\n\r\nRepairing forthwith to a newspaper office, I wrote to the general\r\nhow sorry I was that he had been put to so much trouble--I had not\r\nreceived the letter which he must have written--obliged to go home\r\nin the morning--hoped at some future time to have the pleasure, etc.,\r\netc. Then I went to my lodgings on Federal Hill, and, behold! there\r\nwas the letter. \"Although the ambulance\"--ever blessed!--\"had been so\r\noften to the dépôt, it would be there on Monday morning, and again on\r\nTuesday evening. Don't fail to,\" etc. Whereupon I called for paper\r\nand wrote the general that, in spite of the necessity for my returning\r\nhome the next day, I would be at Blank Station on Tuesday evening and\r\nmeet that ambulance--blessed ambulance!--or die in the struggle. Go I\r\nwould, and go I went--if that is grammar.\r\n\r\nA newspaper editor--there is no end of editors in Virginia: wherever\r\nthere is a tank, a tan-yard or a wood-pile, there you find one--a\r\nlearned professor who had a flourishing school a few miles up the road\r\n(public instruction is playing hob with most of the private schools\r\nin Virginia), and a judge on a lecturing-tour (how is a Virginia\r\njudge to support his family without lecturing, wood-sawing or other\r\nsupplementary business?) entertained me most agreeably on my way to\r\nthe station.\r\n\r\nA cadet from Annapolis was the first object that met my eye when I got\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"'S death! a Virginian in that hated uniform?\"\r\n\r\nI said no such thing, felt no such thing, but was inwardly pleased\r\nthat Uncle Sam's money (he gets ten millions a year out of Virginia\r\ntobacco, and then brags about what he does for our children, the sly\r\nold dog!) was educating some of our boys who otherwise might not be\r\neducated half so well, if at all. Moreover, the broad shoulders, the\r\ntrim flanks, the aquiline nose, brown hair and ruddy cheeks of the\r\nyoung fellow recalled the best specimens of British lads whom I had\r\nseen in Canada and elsewhere. In truth, I could hardly persuade myself\r\nthat he was not English.\r\n\r\nAlbion was in the air, for on the other side of the dépôt there was\r\na lot of trunks and other baggage, the make of which could not\r\nbe mistaken. I soon learned that one of the best estates in the\r\nneighborhood had been sold to an Englishman, who had arrived that\r\nvery day.\r\n\r\n\"Furies! the sacred soil of Virginia _again_ passing into the hands of\r\nthe blarsted Hinglish, from whom it was wrested a century ago by the\r\nblood and treasure of George Washington's hatchet! A Federal cadet on\r\none side and an Englishman on the other of Blank Dépôt, away off here\r\nin Bedford! What are we coming to?\"\r\n\r\nI did not say or think this either, but was delighted to find John\r\nBull pervading the Old Dominion.\r\n\r\nAnother and a bitterer pill, had I been as disloyal as I was five\r\nyears ago, and ought to be now, awaited me, as you shall hear.\r\n\r\nBut where is that ambulance? The blessed vehicle was there, and, after\r\nso long and painful a separation, we should have met face to face if\r\nit had not been backed up to the platform to receive--whom? me? No,\r\na parcel of ladies, who filled every seat. My inflammable Southside\r\nsoul would have burst into a high blaze at this if a gentleman had\r\nnot immediately stepped forward with a snug jug of whisky. Whisky in\r\nany vessel I love, but whisky in a jug not too big to handle easily\r\nI adore. My viznomy relaxed, a beam of joy began to irradiate my\r\nfeatures, when to my extreme surprise the benevolent jug-gentleman\r\nsaid, \"Take a glass of claret punch\"--he had the glass as well as the\r\njug--\"won't you, sir?\"\r\n\r\nAmazement! claret punch in a jug at a dépôt in the heart, or at any\r\nrate the pericardium, of Bedford county! Where was I? who was I? what\r\nwas my name? and where was I going to? In my life I was never more\r\nnonplussed.\r\n\r\nThe ambulance drove off, and I was consigned to a spring wagon with a\r\nwhite boy for a driver.\r\n\r\n\"How far is it to the general's?\" I ventured to ask as I stepped in.\r\n\r\n\"Eight miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, sir: we shall be there in an hour and a half.\"\r\n\r\nAnd off we went like the wind. He drove very boldly and at the same\r\ntime very cautiously, avoiding the numerous stumps, stones and ruts\r\nwith admirable dexterity. I began to suspect that the boy was not a\r\nVirginia boy. When at length we reached the smooth stage-road I began\r\nto question him: \"Are you the general's son?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir: that was my father at the station\"--he of the jug.\r\n\r\n\"How do you like this country?\"\r\n\r\nMy habit from childhood had been to take the life of any stranger who\r\nhad the audacity to tell me that he did not like any and every part\r\nof Virginia, but of late I have contented myself with slicing off his\r\nears.\r\n\r\n\"The longer I live here the better I like it.\"\r\n\r\nSmart boy! he had saved his auditory organs. But as yet his accent had\r\nnot been sufficiently defined to enable me to tell his nationality.\r\n\"You are not from England, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, sir--from New Hampshire.\"\r\n\r\nThe appalling truth was out. First, a Yankee uniform; second, an\r\nEnglishman; third, a whole raft, a \"hull lot,\" of New Hampshire\r\nYankees; and yet they call this Virginia!\r\n\r\nNo wonder I was silent. Night had fallen, we had entered a dark\r\nforest, there was an unreconstructed penknife (somehow or other,\r\nI always forget my bowie-knife and Derringers now-a-days) recently\r\nsharpened in my pocket. Why did I not cut the throat of this little\r\nOppressor and fatten the soil of my native land with the blood of the\r\nsmall ruthless Yankee Invader?\r\n\r\nIt was just because at this moment we caught up with the ambulance.\r\nThe two vehicles halted, a young girl and a little boy left the\r\nambulance and took seats by the side of my driver, and the greeting of\r\nthe brother and sister--the latter having just returned from a visit\r\nto her native granite hills--was actually as affectionate, beautiful\r\nand sweet as if they had been born in the middle of the Mother of\r\nStates and of Statesmen. And as the ambulance drove on there came\r\nfloating back to us ever and anon on the night wind a still sweeter\r\nvoice. It came from a young lady--a young Yankee lady at that--and it\r\nsounded sweet to me--to me myself, my own dear, unadulterated, real\r\nOld Virginia self.\r\n\r\nTurning from the main road, we wound around among the rocky ravines\r\nin a fashion truly bewildering to a body with weak eyes, but my little\r\nYankee driver seemed so much at home that I felt no shadow of fear.\r\nArriving safely at the general's capacious mansion, I bade my Northern\r\nfriends good-night, and sat down to a supper without fried chickens\r\nor coffee. In lieu of the latter we had cold tea, with a slice of\r\nlemon in each goblet. After a long talk on matters of no concern to\r\nthe reader, during which the general related a number of capital\r\nwar-anecdotes, I contrived, as is my wont, to turn the conversation\r\nupon agricultural topics, with the view of imparting to him a modicum\r\nof that consummate farming wisdom which appertains to every thoroughly\r\nconceited scribbler.\r\n\r\n\"Fine country you have, general.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes: from Lugston to the Tennessee line, two hundred good miles, the\r\ncountry is as fine as the sun ever shone upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Appears to be thinly settled.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may well say so. Between my house and the station there are eight\r\nor nine thousand acres, most of it excellent land, belonging to only\r\nfive or six owners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! What are such immense tracts good for now-a-days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they seem to pay little attention to grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. It is a splendid cheese country, as I have proved, but our\r\npeople are not up to that as yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"They _will_ grow tobacco. I saw some fine timber sacrificed for the\r\nsake of new-ground tobacco.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not? A man gets tired of paying taxes for twenty or thirty\r\nyears on timber which yields him nothing.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled an invisible smile, reverting in my thoughts to an assault\r\nI had made the week before upon my kinsman in Buckingham. \"William,\"\r\nsaid I, \"why will you Southside people continue to exhaust your land\r\nwith tobacco?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick,\" he replied, \"you are the doggonedest fool out of jail. _You_,\r\nraised in Virginia, and ask a question like that! Wheat is uncertain,\r\ncorn doesn't pay, we are too far from market for vegetables, too poor\r\nto put our lands in grass, and tobacco is the only thing that will\r\nfetch money. As for exhausting land, plenty of tobacco is raised in\r\nOhio and Connecticut, and you never hear anybody talk about exhausting\r\nland there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but there they manure heavily, giving back to the land as much\r\nas they take, or more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, old-field pine is good enough manure for a man who has plenty\r\nof land and can take his time.\"\r\n\r\nThus in two instances my anti-tobacco wisdom turned out to be about\r\nas profitable as King James's memorable _Counterblast_ against the\r\nbeloved weed of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"But, general,\" said I, \"surely your neighbors don't want to retain\r\nsuch vast tracts of land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. Men do not like to part with good land, and if my\r\nfriends could set their farms well in grass, so that a few hands could\r\nattend to them, they would only sell at very high figures; but being\r\nunable to do this, they are willing, and many of them anxious, to sell\r\non most reasonable terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the trouble, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The trouble is about houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wealthy people seldom emigrate. The men who leave home have generally\r\nbut limited means, and coming here they find just the soil and climate\r\nthey desire, but no place to lay their heads; and few if any of them\r\ncan afford to buy land and build houses at the same time. This, I am\r\nsatisfied, is the main difficulty in the way of the speedy filling up\r\nof Virginia with the best class of yeoman settlers.\"\r\n\r\n\"A difficulty not easily remedied.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, for our people, rich in land, are even poorer in money than the\r\nimmigrants themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"How on earth, then, did you manage to sell to the New Hampshire\r\ngentleman who came with me this evening, and who, as I learn, bought a\r\npart of your farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I had a roomy house, and I just opened my doors to him and his\r\nfamily, and kept them here free of charge till their own house was\r\nfinished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, general,\" dropping my voice to the Secesh conspirator level,\r\n\"how do you like him?\"\r\n\r\nThe general, known by the antique name of Jones (though the Sixth\r\nPennsylvania and other Northern cavalry were acquainted with him under\r\nanother cognomen), like all the strapping sons of thunder who went\r\nactively into the field instead of staying at home and abusing Jeff.\r\nDavis, does not regard his late enemies with that intense hatred which\r\nis so gratifying to myself and some other people.\r\n\r\nHe spoke out aloud: \"I like him first rate. He is an admirable\r\nneighbor--a man of sense, practical, sagacious and industrious; and\r\nhis family, wife, sons and daughters, are in all respects worthy of\r\nhim. I wish the county had a thousand of just such people.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a crusher for me. Drawing myself up to my full height--which\r\nought to be but is not six feet--I seized a kerosene lamp with my\r\nright hand, and looking the unfortunate man full in the eye, I said\r\nvery respectfully, \"General, good-night.\"\r\n\r\nUndismayed, he eyed me back, and, in a tone of what I took to be\r\ncordiality, replied, \"Maybe you'd like a little whisky-and-water\r\nbefore going to bed?\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him \"No,\" mounted the lofty staircase, divested myself of\r\nsundry sartorial cerements and plunged my earthly tabernacle into the\r\ncentre of a big delicious bed. There, while the thunder rolled among\r\nthe mountains, the rain plashed upon the window-shutters and the wind\r\nblew like the very devil, I muttered to myself, \"Here is a man bearing\r\nworthily one of the most honored names in the Commonwealth--a member,\r\nin fact, of one of the first--the first--_first_ fam--families in\r\nVir--gin--ia, actually pr--prais--praising Yan--Yank--Yankees in--in's\r\nown hou--\" I was asleep.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, when I returned to the station and saw how very lovely\r\nthe country was, how fertile--the rounded mountains, when cleared\r\nof their royal forests, arable to their very summits, the air like\r\nOlympian nectar, the sunshine a divine balm, the whole scene a\r\nSabbath-land of peace and of boundless plenty, awaiting only the\r\ncohorts of the North and of the white-cliffed isle--I would fain have\r\ncried, \"Come, ye moderately pecunious Bulls, and you, ye hyperborean\r\nVandals from the far Lake of Winnipiseogee and the uttermost Cape of\r\nCod--come to this Canaan, not like carpet-bagging spies to steal our\r\nbig bunch of grapes and tote it off on a stick between two of you (as\r\nper authentic pictures in Sunday-school books), but with your shekels,\r\nyour deniers, your pence, pounds sterling and crisp greenbacks: come\r\nto this beauteous land, take it, own it, possess it, buy freely, and\r\nbe sure you reserve enough cash to build a house with; or, better\r\nstill, bring your houses ready made, in nests like buckets or painted\r\npails (I am sure you have them in your inventive realm). Come, I say,\r\nand oust these mutton-headed Virginians, or sit down beside them, work\r\nwith them, teach them to work (you are so certain you can), and make\r\nthis American republic the Storehouse of the nations, the Cornucopia\r\nof all creation!\"\r\n\r\nI got to the station just three hours after the train I intended to\r\ntake had left, and had to wait only two hours for the next train;\r\nwhich was doing pretty well for Virginia. Possessing my Southside\r\nsoul in patience, I bought two not very bad cigars for ten cents, and\r\nfell to contemplating some eight or nine of the Down-Trodden who were\r\nhanging around. I must say that the Down-Trodden did not appear to\r\nhave been much flattened by the heel of the Oppressor. As I gazed, a\r\nfoolish parody started itself in my idle brain:\r\n\r\n  When the fair land of Bedford\r\n  Was ploughed by the hoof\r\n  Of the ruthless invader--\r\n\r\nThere the thing broke down, and--the events of the night before, the\r\nEnglishman, the happy Northern family and the thoroughly reconstructed\r\ngeneral, suggesting it in some queer cerebral way--a still more\r\nfoolish negro song, which I had forgotten for years, popped up in my\r\nbrain-pan:\r\n\r\n  Lit-tel gal, I give you ninepunce\r\n  Ef you will dance de Haul-back;\r\n  And I kin dance de Haul-back,\r\n  And you kin dance de Haul back,\r\n  And we kin dance de Haul-back.\r\n\r\nThe relevancy of this utterly absurd thing did not then strike me. I\r\nsee it now. A certain people--whom I do love with my whole heart,\r\nnot in spite of their faults, but because of them: are they not my\r\nown?--have been dancing the Haul-back for many generations, and now,\r\nunder my own eye and quite perceptibly in the rural parts of Virginia,\r\nthe dance is coming to an end. Slowly but surely we are lapsing\r\ninto Bullo-doodledom, with a momentary preponderance of Bull.\r\n_Tempora_--do, I entreat you, allow me the use of my solitary dear\r\ndelightful old bit of Latin--_mutantur_; ay! and we mutate with them.\r\nThe world moves, and no amount of Haul-back will stay it.\r\n\r\nRICHARD B. ELDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELLESLEY-POLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death was announced a few weeks ago of a lady whose name will\r\nawaken a train of recollection in the minds of all who take an\r\ninterest in English family history. This was Miss Tylney-Long, sister\r\nto the ill-fated Mrs. Tylney-Long-Wellesley-Pole.\r\n\r\nThe duke of Wellington's second brother, William, succeeded in 1778 to\r\nthe large Irish estates of a kinsman, Mr. Pole, and assumed that name\r\nin addition to his own. Mr. Wellesley-Pole, who was eventually created\r\na peer as Lord Maryborough, had a son, who became, on the death of\r\nhis uncle, the marquis Wellesley, earl of Mornington. Never had the\r\npeerage a more unworthy member. Starting in life with every advantage,\r\nMr. Wellesley-Pole seemed bent upon showing how effectually he could\r\nfoil the efforts of Fortune to serve him. When he reached an age for\r\nmarriage the greatest heiress of the time was Miss Tylney-Long. By a\r\nsuccession of failures of male heirs the vast wealth of the family\r\nof Child had devolved on this lady, and Mr. Wellesley-Pole became\r\nthe successful suitor for her hand. One of her seats was Wanstead\r\nin Essex, some fifteen miles from London. Originally a royal manor,\r\nWanstead was granted by Edward VI. to Lord Rich, who sold it to\r\nElizabeth's favorite, Leicester. Subsequently, on its reverting to the\r\nCrown, James I. gave it to Sir Henry Mildmay, but, he having been one\r\nof Charles I.'s judges, it became forfeited, and once more returned to\r\nthe sovereign. Charles II. gave it to his brother James, who sold it\r\nto Sir Robert Brooke, and he in turn sold it to Sir Joshua Child.\r\n\r\nThe Childs were the greatest mercantile family of their time. Sir\r\nJoshua founded the banking-house of the name which still flourishes\r\n(the oldest in London), and of which the young earl of Jersey is,\r\nthrough his great-grandmother, also a Child heiress, the principal\r\npartner. Sir Joshua's son was raised to a peerage as Earl Tylney, and\r\nabout 1715 employed a celebrated architect of the day, Colin Campbell,\r\nto build a magnificent mansion. Wanstead was deemed on its completion\r\nin many respects the most magnificent house in England. It was of\r\nPortland stone, two hundred feet in length and seventy deep. The great\r\nhall was fifty-three by forty-five feet, the ball-room seventy-five by\r\ntwenty-seven. This abode was furnished in a style of the most lavish\r\nsplendor, and Mr. Wellesley-Pole's income was more than adequate to\r\nmaintain it in befitting style. But no income is adequate to meet\r\nthe expenses of a gambler and spendthrift, and such was Mr.\r\nWellesley-Pole.\r\n\r\nSome of his wife's property was happily settled on her and her heirs,\r\nand could not be got hold of by her rascally husband; but Wanstead,\r\nafter being leased for some time to the duc de Bourbon--who here\r\nreceived intelligence of the death of his unfortunate son, the\r\nduc d'Enghien--came to the hammer. The sale of the effects in 1822\r\nexceeded anything of the kind which had been known in England up\r\nto that date. The catalogue consisted of four hundred quarto pages,\r\npublished in three parts, at five shillings each, and it is said that\r\nnot less than twenty thousand copies were sold. It is not a little\r\nremarkable that the contents of Fonthill Abbey (the celebrated seat of\r\nthe author of _Vathek_), which teemed with even greater riches, were\r\nsold almost at the same time. Nor were the contents of the mansion\r\nonly disposed of. The fabric itself, which had cost three hundred and\r\nsixty thousand pounds, was sold for eight thousand pounds, it being\r\na condition of the sale that it should be razed and the materials\r\nremoved within a definite number of months.\r\n\r\nHad Tylney-Long-Wellesley-Pole (for such was the polysyllabic name he\r\nbore after his marriage) been only a spendthrift and a gambler, his\r\ncase might not have seemed remarkable. But he showed himself in every\r\nway a heartless scoundrel as regarded his wife and his children, who\r\nhad to seek legal protection against him. About a year after the sale\r\nof her splendid home his wife died, and the event is thus spoken of\r\nin a leading journal of the time: \"The premature death of an amiable\r\nand accomplished lady born to large possessions, and against whom the\r\nvoice of calumny never so much as breathed a slander, calls, we think,\r\nfor a passing comment, as illustrating and furnishing, we trust, a\r\nlasting and useful lesson to the heartlessness of too many men of the\r\npresent day. With a fortune that made her a prize for princes, this\r\namiable woman gave her hand and heart to the man of her choice, and\r\nwith them all that unbounded wealth could bestow. What her fate has\r\nbeen all the world knows: what it ought to have been the world is\r\nequally well aware. To her, riches have been worse than poverty; and\r\nher life seems to have been scarified and her heart broken through\r\nthe very means that should have cherished and maintained her in the\r\nhappiness and splendor which her fortune and disposition were alike\r\nqualified to produce. Let her fate be a warning to all of her sex\r\nwho, blessed with affluence, think the buzzing throng which surrounds\r\nthem have hearts, when in fact they have none; and if there be such a\r\nfeeling as remorse accessible in the quarter where it is most called\r\nfor, let the world witness, by a future life of contrition, something\r\nlike atonement for the past.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, however, as the world could discover, the atonement never\r\ncame. Lord Mornington, as he became, actually found another woman to\r\nmarry him: he ill-used her, and having sunk into narrow circumstances,\r\nneglected to provide her with the barest necessaries, so that the\r\napplications of the countess of Mornington to the London police\r\nmagistrates for assistance became of frequent occurrence. It may\r\nseem strange that the Wellesley family should not have stepped in to\r\nprevent such a scandal. Probably they thought that the woman who in\r\nthe teeth of his evil reputation had chosen to marry him should take\r\nthe consequences. He died in 1857. His son, whose life his father's\r\nconduct had sadly embittered, did not long survive him, and bequeathed\r\nthe remnant of his estates, including Draycot, a large mansion (which\r\nhad been strictly entailed) in Wiltshire, to his cousin, Lord Cowley,\r\nthen ambassador at Paris. His title passed to the duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF DANGAN CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Cowley, on being created an earl, selected for his second title\r\nthat of Viscount Dangan, thus perpetuating the memory of the old seat\r\nof the Wellesleys in Ireland. It is a somewhat remarkable circumstance\r\nthat although no family in the United Kingdom has within the last\r\ncentury acquired such fame and honors as the Wellesleys, they have\r\nlong since ceased to own a rood of ground in the country whence\r\nthey derived the affluence and rank which were to the famous sons of\r\nGarrett, earl of Mornington, the first stepping-stones to fame.\r\n\r\nThe Wellesleys are only Wellesleys--or Wesleys, as the name was\r\nformerly spelt--in the female line. Richard Colley, son of Henry\r\nColley, of Castle Carbery, county Cork, succeeded on the 23d of\r\nSeptember, 1728, to the estates of his cousin, Garrett Wesley, Esq.,\r\nof Dangan, county Meath, assumed the name and arms of \"Wesley,\" and\r\nwas created baron of Mornington July 9, 1746. He married, December\r\n23, 1819, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Doctor John Sale, M.P. for\r\nCarysfort, and died January 31, 1758, when he was succeeded by his\r\nonly son, Garrett, father of the duke of Wellington, who was created\r\nin 1760 Viscount Wellesley and earl of Mornington.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1748, Mrs. Delany writes: \"Last Monday we set out for\r\nDangan, Lord Mornington's. He is the same good-humored, agreeable man\r\nhe was seventeen years ago. My godson, Master Wesley [Wellington's\r\nfather] is a most extraordinary boy: he was thirteen last month,\r\nis a very good scholar, and whatever study he undertakes masters\r\nit most surprisingly. He began with the riddle last year, and now\r\nplays everything at sight.\" [In after years Lord Mornington acquired\r\nconsiderable distinction as a composer.]\r\n\r\n\"This place, Dangan Castle, is really magnificent: the old house that\r\nwas burnt down is rebuilding. They live at present in the offices: the\r\ngarden (or rather improvements and parks, for it is too extensive to\r\nbe called a garden) consists of six hundred Irish acres, between eight\r\nand nine hundred English. There is a gravel-walk fifty-two feet broad\r\nand six hundred yards long from the house to the great lake. The lake\r\ncontains twenty-six acres, is of an irregular shape, with a fort\r\nbuilt in all its forms. My godson is governor of the fort. He hoisted\r\nall his colors, and was not a little mortified that I declined the\r\ncompliment of being saluted from the fort and ship. The ground, so far\r\nas you can see every way, is waving in hills and dales.\"\r\n\r\nDangan stands about seven miles from Trim and twenty from Dublin. The\r\nMarquis Wellesley (husband of Miss Caton of Maryland), who succeeded\r\nhis father as second earl of Mornington, sold it to a Mr. Burroughs,\r\nwho, after greatly improving it, let it to Mr. Roger O'Connor, a\r\nnear relative of the Chartist agitator of the name. Whilst in his\r\npossession the house and demesne were stripped of everything that\r\ncould be turned into money; the timber, which was remarkable both for\r\nquantity and quality, was cut down; and the gardens were permitted to\r\nrun to waste. At length the house--being heavily insured--was found\r\nto be on fire, and was burnt before assistance could be obtained. One\r\npart of the building, of which the walls were extraordinarily thick,\r\nis now inhabited by a farmer who superintends the property.\r\n\r\nThe present duke of Wellington (whose wife, formerly well known as\r\nLady Douro, is a daughter of Lord Tweeddale, and sister of the wife\r\nof Sir Robert Peel) is childless. His only brother, Lord Charles\r\nWellesley, left two sons, but if these should die issueless the\r\ndukedom will be extinct, and the Irish earldom of Mornington will\r\npass to Lord Cowley.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVIEWING CAPTAIN KIDD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Editor: The following, which I cut from the New York _Herald_ of\r\nJuly 17, 1699 (accidentally in my possession), may interest some of\r\nyour readers. I was not before aware that the _Herald's_ files\r\nwent back so far, but it was a greater surprise to discover that\r\ninterviewing flourished at so early a date.\r\n\r\nYours, SARSFIELD YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN KIDD!\r\n\r\nTHE PIRATE CHIEF IN A BOSTON JAIL!\r\n\r\nBOUQUETS AND BAKED BEANS _vs._ PURITAN THEOLOGY!\r\n\r\nCALUMNIATIONS OF THE PRESS!\r\n\r\nDON'T CALL ME PET NAMES--WILLIAM _vs._ ROBERT!\r\n\r\nALL A MISTAKE ABOUT THAT CHISEL!\r\n\r\nSARAH'S MUGS AND PORRINGERS!\r\n\r\n\"HOW IS MY FRIEND, COL.

Little Boston has got a sensation at last, and\r\nis determined to keep it. Merchants and brokers talk Kidd on 'Change.\r\nGroups at the hotels discuss the nautical hero. Badly-executed\r\npictures of him stare at you from the shop-windows. Cotton Mather,\r\nthe great gun of the clergy here, blazes away at this \"child of\r\niniquity\" from the pulpit; and it is understood that a prominent\r\npublishing-house has already arranged to bring out _The Autobiography\r\nof a Buccaneer_. _On dit_, that certain parties are negotiating to\r\nhave him appear next season as a lecturer in case he isn't wanted on\r\nanother platform.\r\n\r\nThe first paroxysm of excitement, which looked to nothing short of\r\nhanging him from the steeple of the Old South Church, has given\r\nplace to a conviction that the law had better be suffered to take\r\nits course, inasmuch as the unfortunate captain will surely drift\r\namong the breakers when he is tossed about on the sea of criminal\r\njurisprudence.\r\n\r\nBy the politeness of the colonial authorities, your correspondent\r\nobtained a permit to visit the noted son of Neptune at the Stone\r\nPrison. Sending in his card, he was at once invited into the small but\r\ncomfortable apartment where the \"scourge of the seas\" is confined.\r\n\r\nCaptain Kidd graciously extended his hand and bade your correspondent\r\nwelcome. He is a short, broad-shouldered, powerfully-built man, of\r\nperhaps forty-five or forty-seven years of age. His hair, which is\r\nof dark chestnut and inclined to curl, was combed back from a medium\r\nforehead, and his face was sun-burnt into a rich mahogany hue. His\r\ncold gray eyes were deep set under thick brows that arched and met.\r\nHis manner was courteous and dignified. He was dressed in light gray\r\ntrowsers of perfect cut, patent-leather boots and a red-and-black\r\nspotted shirt, which displayed in its front a set of superb diamond\r\nstuds. From under a Byron collar, _parfaitement_ starched, peeped\r\nthe ends of a pale lilac scarf. A magnificent seal-ring decorated the\r\nthird finger of his left hand.\r\n\r\nThe day being excessively warm, his coat and vest had been laid aside.\r\nThe room was plainly furnished. The table was littered with charts and\r\npapers, while on a stand were flowers sent to the prisoner by ladies\r\nof Boston.\r\n\r\nWith the instinct of a true gentleman, he proceeded to put on his coat\r\nand vest, when the following conversation ensued:\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"Pray, captain, keep your coat off.\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"Thank you, if the same to you?\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"Quite the same, I assure you. My visit is informal.\" (Handing\r\nhim a cigar.)\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"Thanks: I take things coolly--waive ceremony. You know\r\nthat's a habit I acquired at sea. You are a reporter?\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"Yes, for the New York _Herald_. I call to ascertain your views\r\nof the situation. The public are anxious to hear your defence; and, if\r\nproper, I would like to ask you a few questions.\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"Certainly\" (lighting his cigar). \"You newspaper men\r\nhaven't given me a fair show. There's a heap of lying going on about\r\nme. They are hounding me--that's a fact. I've got the evidence to\r\nprove that I'm an injured man. I have a clear conscience, that's one\r\ncomfort.\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"A great comfort, no doubt. May I ask, captain, what particular\r\nfalsehood has gained currency?\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"Yes, sir. I will name one that is an unmitigated slander.\r\nThey say that when I came across Moore and corrected him with a bucket\r\nfor his impertinence, he was grinding a chisel. Now, sir, that is as\r\nfalse as ----!\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"Indeed?\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"Yes, sir, 'twas a screwdriver.\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"That shall be corrected, captain. Anything else?\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"Yes, sir--a bigger lie still. There is a scurrilous\r\nbroadside circulating all over the country. Here it is.\" (He handed me\r\na copy of verses printed in the _Herald_ of last Tuesday.) \"Read\r\nthat, if you please, sir: 'My name is Robert Kidd, as I sailed, as I\r\nsailed.' Now, sir, that is a villainous falsehood.\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"You didn't sail under that name, then, captain?\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"Never. Why, bless your innocent heart, my baptismal name\r\nis _William_. It is of a piece with all their malignant lying, this\r\npersisting in calling me _Robert_.\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"It _is_ hard.\" (Pause.) \"Pray, captain, permit me to ask\r\nif the story is true that Mrs. Kidd's trunk was seized by the\r\nauthorities, and kept with its contents of gold-dust and diamonds?\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"In part true, sir. A perfect outrage, sir. Mrs. Kidd\r\ncame on from New York post-haste when she heard that the Antonio had\r\narrived, and no sooner had she set foot in Boston than the authorities\r\ngobbled up her trunk, leaving her in a strange community with nothing\r\nbut a band-box. The public have exaggerated the contents. They were\r\nsilver mugs, porringers and plate generally for family use, that\r\nwe had been years accumulating. They locked it up in the castle,\r\nand--Poor Sarah! poor Sarah!\" (Here the stout man buried his head in\r\nhis hands and appeared deeply affected. Your correspondent improved\r\nthe opportunity to perfect his notes.)\r\n\r\n_Rep_. (after a few minutes). \"I am glad to assure you, Captain Kidd,\r\nthat it will probably be returned to her to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ (brightening up). \"To-morrow? Well, that's good. It\r\nwellnigh broke Sarah's heart. By the way, you are lately from New\r\nYork, I suppose. How is my old friend, Colonel Livingstone? Well, I\r\nhope?\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"I haven't the honor of his acquaintance, but I have no doubt\r\nhe is well. New York men usually are. He is a staunch friend of yours,\r\ncaptain?\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"Ay, that he is. He has always stood by me, ever since he\r\ngot me that appointment to command the 'Adventure galley.'\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"You have no doubt, captain, of your ability to substantiate\r\nyour entire innocence of these charges brought against you?\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"Not the slightest, not the slightest, sir. There was\r\nCaptain Wright of the Quedah--you remember him, I dare say: had\r\ncommand of that nigger crew--what did he say when I went aboard his\r\nship? Said he, 'Kidd, you remind me of the new-born babe.' I suppose\r\nI can't prove that, for Wright, poor fellow! has been dropped into the\r\nsea, with a twenty-four-pound shot at his heels.\r\n\r\n\"But what if the jury does convict me? Can't I have a bill of\r\nexceptions? Can't I sue out an injunction to stay proceedings? What\r\ndid they let me walk the streets of Boston a whole week for, if I was\r\nsuch a criminal as some of 'em pretend? I tell you what it is--this\r\nthing is a put-up job. That ring of East India speculators is at the\r\nbottom of it. They just run Bellamont. They know I stand in their way;\r\nbut I'll be even with them yet. Mark my word, Mr. Reporter: William\r\nKidd is going to march down these streets head up, colors flying and\r\nthe band playing 'Carry the news to Hiram.'\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"I hope so, captain. One word more. If not too bold, may I\r\ninquire about these stories of your burying treasure on Gardner's\r\nIsland?\"\r\n\r\n_Capt. K._ \"True as gospel preaching! I buried doubloons all over\r\nthat island--used to work moonlight nights at it. You can't show me a\r\nsquare yard of soil there that isn't stuck full of shiners. You see,\r\nit grew to be a perfect passion with me. I stopped on my way up Boston\r\nharbor here, and planted about three millions of pounds sterling. I\r\nforget now which island it was. However, I shall publish a complete\r\nguide to all these points, with diagrams and directions for getting\r\nup stock companies, in the book I'm preparing.\" (Just then a card was\r\nbrought in. Captain K. nodded affirmatively to the attendant, and\r\nyour correspondent rose to withdraw.) \"I am sorry not to talk with you\r\nlonger, but a delegation of the ministry are just outside the door.\r\nThey propose to sit down and discuss with me the exceeding sinfulness\r\nof a greed of worldly gain, especially when it runs into piracy.--My\r\nbest compliments to you, sir. Good-morning.\"\r\n\r\n_Rep_. \"Good-morning, captain.\"\r\n\r\nYour correspondent encountered six white-chokered gentlemen on their\r\nway to interview the great nautical backslider. He is certainly the\r\nlion of the hour.\r\n\r\nFrom what your correspondent has been able to gather it is probable\r\nthat a few friends of the captain will succeed in their efforts to\r\nsecure Samuel Adams and a promising young lawyer named Choate to\r\nconduct his defence. In this event his chances of a discharge from\r\ncustody will prove favorable. It may be that Bellamont and the council\r\nwill conclude to send him over for trial in the King's Bench.\r\n\r\nYour correspondent inclines to the view that the distinguished marine\r\nplunderer can hardly be held for piracy, but may be convicted of\r\nthe murder of the gunner Moore. The story is here that Kidd, with an\r\niron-hooped bucket, not only finished up things for William Moore,\r\nbut left that unhappy man in his gore. As regards jurisdiction, the\r\ngovernment will allege that the awful deed was committed not many\r\nleagues from shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DINNER EXCUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nApologies for poor dinners are generally out of place. But when a lady\r\nhas a forgetful husband, who, without warning, brings home a dozen\r\nguests to sit down to a plain family dinner for three or four, it is\r\nnot in human nature to keep absolute silence. What to say, and how\r\nto say it, form the problem. Mrs. Tucker, the wife of Judge Tucker of\r\nWilliamsburg, solved this problem most happily many years ago. She was\r\nthe daughter or niece (I am uncertain which) of Sir Peyton Skipwith,\r\nand celebrated for her beauty, wit, ease and grace of manner. Her\r\ntemper and tact were put to the proof one court-day, when the judge\r\nbrought with him the accustomed half score or more of lawyers, for\r\nwhom not the slightest preparation had been made, the judge having\r\nquite forgotten to remind his wife that it was court-day, and she\r\nherself, strange to tell, having overlooked the fact.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was served with elegance, and Mrs. T. made herself very\r\ncharming. Upon rising to leave the guests to their wine she said:\r\n\"Gentlemen, you have dined to-day with Judge Tucker: promise me now\r\nthat you will all dine to-morrow with _me_\"\r\n\r\nThis was all her apology, whereupon the gentlemen swore that such a\r\nwife was beyond price. The judge then explained the situation, and the\r\nnext day there was a noble banquet.\r\n\r\n_Moral_: Never worry a guest with apologies.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Turkish paper gives an account of a curious forced emigration\r\nwhich has recently produced great excitement on classic ground. On\r\nthe European banks of the Hellespont stands the city of Gallipoli,\r\ninteresting as the first possession of the Turks in Europe in 1357;\r\nand nearly opposite to it is Lamsaki, a village long renowned for\r\nthe vineyards in its neighborhood, and situated near the site of\r\nthe celebrated Lampsacus of classic times. During the autumn the\r\nauthorities of Gallipoli came to the conclusion that there were in\r\nthat town--as where are there not?--too many owner-less dogs about;\r\nand instead of issuing death-warrants against these vagrants, they\r\ntook the extraordinary course of exporting them to their opposite\r\nneighbors across the Hellespont, who were already plentifully\r\nprovided with canine treasures. On the arrival of these two thousand\r\nimmigrants, who were very unruly on the passage, they started, in\r\nquest of food it may be supposed, to the mountains, but not finding\r\nanything to suit their palates, returned to the town. Here the tug of\r\nwar commenced. The Lamsakian canines, on recognizing the situation,\r\nturned out to a dog, and a frightful conflict, with terrible howlings\r\nand barkings, ensued for four hours. At the end of that time the\r\nforeign foe was worsted, and, beating a retreat, endeavored to allay\r\nthe pangs of hunger by eating the grapes, and thus doing really\r\nserious damage. The people then had to turn out: two hundred dogs\r\nwere killed, and the rest retreated, but of course only to return.\r\nThe _Djeridéi Havadis_ concludes the account by mildly saying that\r\nthe Lamsakians are much disgusted by the eccentric conduct of the\r\nGallipoli magistrates, who ought of course to have sent their canine\r\nemigrants to a desert island. But how thankful would Philadelphians be\r\nif somebody, imitating the Gallipoli magistrates, would but deport two\r\nthousand of the cats which make night-life hideous--to the New Jersey\r\nshore, say!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe pie is almost an \"institution\" in America. A single New York\r\nbakery claims that it produces nine hundred pies an hour from one of\r\nits ten capacious ovens, and a total of fifty thousand pies daily,\r\nthe year round, forcing the supply occasionally up to sixty-five\r\nthousand--probably on Fourths of July or other festal occasions. Let\r\nthe reader busy himself with imagining the total production of pies\r\nby this and all other bakeries of the country during a twelve-month!\r\nNevertheless, these facilities would be inadequate to popular demand\r\nwere the majority of our countrymen of a stomach as unbounded as\r\nthat of the Dundee laborer whom a Scotch journal commemorates. This\r\nextraordinary person, having not long since eaten nine large twopenny\r\npies at a Dundee pie-shop within fourteen and a half minutes,\r\nannounced his purpose to eat on the following Monday twelve pies\r\nwithin twenty-five minutes; and in fact, when the delicacies were put\r\nbefore him in the shape of a six-pound pile, fourteen inches high, he\r\nconsumed half a dozen in five minutes, the next three at the end of\r\neleven minutes, and the last three in six minutes more, having ended\r\nhis repast eight minutes sooner than he had designed--possibly owing\r\nto the pangs of hunger, since he expressed a willingness to occupy the\r\nspare moments with devouring another half dozen pies.\r\n\r\nWith this item of news in fresh remembrance we chanced to read in a\r\nvery old English newspaper the supper eaten, many years ago, by Mr.\r\nOakley of Stanton, Derbyshire--a repast which makes the Scotchman's,\r\njust recorded, rather frugal by comparison. His first dish, says the\r\nreport, was two quarts of milk, thirty eggs, half a pound of butter,\r\nhalf a pound of sugar, three penny loaves, a quantity of ginger and\r\nnutmeg and an ounce of mustard, all boiled together; his second course\r\nwas \"apiece of cheese and a pound of bread to it;\" the third was half\r\na pound of bacon, a penny loaf and a quart of ale, followed by three\r\nhalfpennies' worth of ginger-bread and a pint of ale; his fourth dish\r\nwas a custard of two pounds, an ounce of mustard, some black pepper,\r\na pint of milk and three pints of ale to it. This banquet he finished\r\nin an hour, and then ungratefully complained of not having had enough;\r\nso, after running three hundred yards by way of appetizer, he sat down\r\nwith the rest of the company, who had witnessed his prowess, and drank\r\npretty freely. Yet even this exploit is hardly equal to the marvel in\r\ndigestion reported in the same ancient newspaper of a Truro porter,\r\nwho, for a bet of five shillings, ate two pairs of worsted stockings\r\nfried in train oil, and half a pound of yellow soap into the bargain.\r\nThe losers of this wager might have been more cautious had they known\r\nthat the same atrocious glutton once undertook to eat as much tripe as\r\nwould make himself a jacket with sleeves, and was accordingly measured\r\nby a tailor, who regularly cut out the materials, when, to general\r\nsurprise, the voracious fellow ate up the whole in twenty minutes.\r\nCompared with these performances some of the current prodigies of\r\ngormandism which the papers so often report are surely as trifling\r\nin amount as they are tame and uninventive in the character of their\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe strange accident of Albertacce brought to general notice an\r\nobscure Corsican custom which singularly contrasts with the ordinary\r\nfuneral ceremonies of Christendom. The _vocero_, as this rite is\r\nstyled, is palpably an inheritance from the classical conquerors of\r\nthe island, now preserved only in some of the interior villages.\r\nWhen the head of a family dies, the body, after being robed in its\r\nhandsomest garments, is laid in state on a table in the largest room,\r\nsurrounded with lights. Then, five or six hours before the burial,\r\nall the women of the village and the district, clothed in black and\r\nwith bare heads, assemble around the corpse, the mother and sisters\r\nof the dead at the feet, the nearest relations next, and so on. When\r\nthis assemblage is formed the most renowned poetesses or singers of\r\ntheir number, with hair disheveled and bleeding faces, and a white\r\nhandkerchief waving in the hand, chant in verse the history, virtues\r\nand destiny of the dead. The mournful cadence, the profuse weeping and\r\nthe dramatic gestures of the ceremony are striking. The chief mourner\r\namid her wailing sometimes raises the head or the arm of the corpse,\r\nand plucks out her own hair or freshly tears at her face till the\r\nblood pours again from the wounded skin, while the half-stifled\r\nsobbing of the whole company adds to the effect. When at length the\r\npriest arrives, all is hushed, but the women follow the corpse in\r\nprocession to the church, where the ceremony sometimes lasts several\r\nhours. Such, at least, is the account of the _vocero_ given by a\r\ncorrespondent of the _XIX'e Siècle_, who visited the scene of the\r\nAlbertacce accident, where a roomful of celebrants were suddenly\r\nprecipitated into the cellar by the giving way of the floor. The mere\r\nmention of the accident came by telegraph, but it appears that twenty\r\ndead and fourteen mangled women were taken from the wreck of the house\r\nwhere they had been singing their mournful _vocero_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnless the Paris postmen are more patient than those of Madrid (who\r\nwere on strike a few weeks since), their temper must be ruffled by\r\nthe transformations now going on in the names of streets. In France,\r\nand especially in Paris, each overthrow of a dynasty produces a\r\ncorresponding revolution in the city directory, for all unpopular\r\nnames must be effaced, and the streets which bore them must be\r\nrebaptized in accordance with the political favorites of the hour.\r\nDecrees have already turned the Avenue de l'Empereur into the Avenue\r\ndes Lacs; the Avenue Napoléon into the Avenue de l'Opéra; the Place\r\nNapoléon into the Place de l'Opéra; the Avenue de l'Impératrice\r\ninto the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne; the Boulevard Voltaire\r\ninto the Boulevard de Belfort; the Rue Magnan into the Rue\r\nd'Angoulême-Saint-Honoré (its old name); the Rue Billault into the Rue\r\nde l'Oratoire-du-Roule, also its old appellation; while there has been\r\na general effacing of those names which the Communists set up upon\r\nthe streets and avenues during their brief lease of power. Scores of\r\nother old names of streets are already changed or are in train of\r\nalteration; but the preceding will suffice for examples. Now, when\r\none reflects that at the overthrow of Charles X., and again at the\r\noverthrow of Louis Philippe, and again at the overthrow of the Second\r\nRepublic, and again at the overthrow of the Second Empire, and again\r\nat the overthrow of the Commune, these alterations wept on, it is\r\nseen that the puzzle offered to Paris people in general, and to Paris\r\npostmen in particular, must be anything but amusing. Should the\r\nThird Republic perish to-morrow, a new christening of streets would\r\nhave to be made; but the event only would determine whether the new\r\nnames should celebrate Imperialism, or Communism, or Bourbonism, or\r\nOrleanism, or each in its turn. It is rather strange that, with such\r\nan experience, Paris should not take refuge in that tame but enduring\r\nsystem of street nomenclature which is based on the letters of the\r\nalphabet and the ordinal numbers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn English magazine not long since described some of the curious\r\ntheories and superstitions which prevail among devotees of the\r\nlottery and the gaming-table, regarding \"lucky numbers.\" There are\r\ntraditionally fortunate and unfortunate combinations, and there are\r\nalso newer favorites, based very often on figures connected with the\r\nchronology of famous men. The career of Napoleon III. would seem to be\r\nconsidered by gamblers a specially successful one, for since his death\r\nthey have been betting furiously on all numbers supposed to bear a\r\nrelation to sundry pivotal events of his life. In Vienna, in Milan, in\r\nRome, the newspapers notice this universal rage among regular patrons\r\nof the lottery for staking their fortunes on Napoleonic numbers; and,\r\nwhat is also curious, these numbers have in several instances turned\r\nout lucky. Thus, in a late Vienna paper we read that \"the death of the\r\nMan of Sedan has brought good luck to the old women of this city who\r\ngive themselves up with unquenchable passion to the lottery.\" At the\r\nlast drawing, as the paper goes on to say, the numbers most eagerly\r\nseized upon were 3, for Napoleon III.; 65, for his age; 20, for his\r\nbirthday, it falling on the twentieth of the month; 90, as the highest\r\nnumber in the lottery, hence interpreted to signify \"emperor;\" and\r\nfinally 52, the year of his accession to the throne. To the joy of all\r\nthe old lottery-gossips, the luck fell on these numbers, 3, 20, and\r\n90. At Rome the death of Napoleon. III. has furnished new combinations\r\nfor all the devotees of the lottery. At Milan the same infatuated\r\nclass have \"pointed a moral\" of their own from the event--a moral\r\nquite different from the one extracted by sermonizers. They have\r\nbeen playing heavily on number 20 (a gold Napoleon being worth twenty\r\nfrancs), and on number 13, which latter, as the proverbially unlucky\r\none, is interpreted to mean the ex-emperor's death. On the first\r\ndrawing after his death these two numbers proved to be the lucky ones\r\nof the lottery, and it was then found that there had been a great\r\nnumber of winners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIs this present year, 1873, to be, like some famous ones in history,\r\nspecially fatal to crowned heads, and to heads that have once been\r\ncrowned? During the whole twelve months of 1872 the only European\r\nsovereign who died was Charles XV. of Sweden, while none suffered\r\nirremediable misfortune; and in European royal families the only two\r\nlosses by death were Archduke Albrecht and the duke of Guise. But\r\nwithin the first six weeks of 1873 no less than three persons died who\r\nhad at some time worn imperial crowns, and one monarch resigned his\r\nsceptre. First died Napoleon III., on the 9th of January. Then, on the\r\n25th, at Lisbon, died the dowager-empress Amelia, daughter of Prince\r\nEugene, wife of Pedro I. of Brazil, and stepmother of the present\r\nemperor, Pedro II. On February 8 the empress Caroline Augusta, widow\r\nof Francis I. of Austria, and grandmother of the reigning emperor,\r\ndied at Vienna. In Spain the abdication of Amadeo is an incident to\r\nbe mentioned in a year opening so ominously to crowned and discrowned\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n    Santo Domingo, Past and Present; with a Glance at Hayti. By\r\n    Samuel Hazard. New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nMr. Hazard, who has already obliged us with one of the best accounts\r\nof Cuba extant in modern literature, now does a similar service for\r\nSanto Domingo, which he declares to be much more highly favored by\r\nNature, and which he examined with the United States commission of\r\n1871. This book has the advantage of being prepared within reach of\r\nthe British Museum, whose stores of Americo-Spanish authorities have\r\nenabled him to write up with much fullness the historical sketch which\r\noccupies a third of his space. This is a fair, faithful and skillful\r\ncondensation, and the most readable narrative we have seen of poor\r\nDominica's tale of revolutions and wrongs. The personal portion begins\r\nwith the author's arrival at the Salt Keys and Puerto Plata, and\r\nfollows the steps of the commissioners, with a great many anecdotes\r\nand a sprinkling of artistic sketches, to Samana and Santo Domingo\r\nCity; thence overland to the great inland tobacco-mart of Santiago;\r\nand so back to Puerto Plata and Monte Christo, where the commission\r\nceased its labors, being discouraged by the Haytians from an\r\nexploration within their domain; while Mr. Hazard, resuming his\r\ncapacity of private citizen, took his life in his hand and ventured\r\ninto the proud Mumbo-Jumbo republic. It is here that the really lively\r\npart of the story commences, and the author becomes the hero of quite\r\na tragedy of errors. At the first Haytian port, Dauphin Bay, he meets\r\nthe port-captain who cannot read his passport, the port-general who\r\nbows and sends him to the chef de police, the chef who asks for half\r\na dollar without countersigning the document, and lets the pilgrim\r\ngo on in quest of the American consul. The only hotel is closed and\r\n\"busted:\" the consul indicates a billiard-room, whose proprietor feeds\r\nthe stranger, informing him at the same time that the authorities take\r\nhim for a United States commissioner, and have doubled the guards.\r\nThe next visit is to a banker, who plays him a curious practical joke.\r\nDemanding Haytian bank-notes for a few hundred dollars on a letter of\r\ncredit, the tourist, after a time of waiting, sees the street on which\r\nthe banker lives completely blocked with donkey-carts, drays, mules,\r\nhorses with panniers and carts drawn by bullocks. A negro drayman\r\ninforms him that \"the American commissioner, having come over-night\r\nfrom Monte Christo, is drawing a draft in Haytian specie, and that the\r\ncarts are to load up with it.\" The banker, being consulted, offers to\r\nstore the currency cheap in a warehouse, but advises as a friend that\r\nthe draft be reduced, the bullocks sent away, and that the traveler\r\ntake a beer. \"I took the beer,\" says Mr. Hazard. A dollar in gold\r\nmeans just four hundred dollars in Haytian paper: a cocktail cost\r\nthe traveler \"thirty dollars,\" and other things in proportion. These\r\nbeginnings of make-believe pomposity are followed up by the strangest\r\nrevelations wherever the adventurer sets his foot. Going from Cape\r\nHaytien to the citadel and \"Sans-Souci\" palace of Christophe, the\r\ntraveler is charged \"two thousand dollars\" by the drunken negro\r\nguide, and \"a dollar\" by the sable sentry of whom he happens to ask a\r\nquestion. The town of Cape Haytien he finds surrounded by the rotting\r\nbodies of dead animals; the ruins of fine old country-seats are\r\noccupied by filthy black squatters; the new houses going up are built\r\nby the process of throwing single bricks one after the other from the\r\nground to the bricklayer. Squalor and braggadocio he finds everywhere.\r\nThe general who has given him a permit to inspect Christophe's\r\nstronghold sends a messenger secretly in advance with instructions\r\nreversing his order: the commandant refuses lodgings to \"the American\r\nwho has come to take the fort.\" Some friends of the consul who\r\nhad received a general invitation to accompany the excursion had\r\npreviously backed out, because the stranger was an American, a reputed\r\ncommissioner, and very unsafe company. Mr. Hazard could only obtain\r\npermission to swing his hammock in the house of a negress; a citizen\r\nwho pointed him out to the others made the signs of throat-cutting;\r\nand he left behind him the filibustering reputation of the American\r\nwho came to take the citadel. Naturally disgusted by this time, the\r\nauthor renounced his intention of further land-traveling, and passed\r\nin a steamer around the western end of the island to Port-au-Prince.\r\nHere he was delighted with the entertainment of our present minister\r\nto Hayti, Mr. Bassett, a Philadelphia quadroon of uncommon qualities\r\nand collegiate education. \"Some of my most delightful hours,\" says the\r\nwriter, \"were spent enjoying the kind hospitalities of Mr. Bassett\r\nand his lady.\" He represents the minister as living in a palace built\r\nfor the emperor Soulouque, and playing a part in the revolutionary\r\nconflicts of the island similar to that of Minister Washburne in\r\nrevolutionary Paris. The brave conduct of Mr. Bassett during the\r\nbrief presidency of the unhappy Salnave deserves mention. About\r\nthree thousand humble blacks, frightened by the rebellion of the\r\n\"aristocracy,\" fled to the protection of our flag, and the minister,\r\nthough shot at in the streets and without the support of a single\r\nman-of-war, saved and fed them all. It seems to be not much to its\r\ncredit that our nation, though very tender of Hayti when the question\r\nof Dominican annexation is raised, has never reimbursed its ambassador\r\nfor this drain on his private purse for the succor of Haytian lives.\r\nWith Port-au-Prince, where the writer awaited his steamer's departure\r\nfor the United States, the journey terminates. The traveler's\r\nevident disgust with almost every manifestation of Haytian attempts\r\nat self-government is balanced by his rapture with the natural\r\nfeatures of the other end of the island. He writes as an ardent\r\nannexationist--not so much from the humanitarian view of President\r\nWhite and Dr. Howe, as from the belief that Santo Domingo, if once\r\nmade our territory, would soon enrich our treasury from its commerce\r\nand its uncommon adaptability as a watering-place. We have spoken of\r\nthis book as very thorough. It is so in every respect--historical,\r\npictorial and narrative. The list of books pertaining to the subject\r\noccupies alone eight pages of small print: as the author, however,\r\nevidently wishes this list to be approximately complete, and as he\r\nseems to be aware of but few books except those in the British Museum,\r\nwe will oblige him, as possibly useful for a future edition, with\r\nthe titles of some which he does not give: one of these especially,\r\nDr. Brown's _History and Present Condition of St. Domingo_, we are\r\nsurprised he does not include, as it is one of the most popular and\r\nuseful books on the topic, and a manual of which we imagined every\r\ncommissioner to have got a chapter by heart daily when on the way to\r\nSamana:\r\n\r\n    Las Casas, \"Destruccion de las Indias,\" Sevilla, 1552;\r\n    Desportes, \"Histoire des Maladies de Saint Domingue,\" Paris,\r\n    1770, 3 vols.; Petit, \"Droit Publique des Colonies Françaises\"\r\n    (containing the \"Black Code\"), Paris, 1777; Nicolson,\r\n    \"Histoire Naturelle de Saint Domingue,\" Paris, 1776; Valverde,\r\n    \"Idea del Valor de la Isla Española,\" Madrid, 1785; Puységur,\r\n    \"Navigation aux Côtes de St. Domingue,\" Paris, 1787;\r\n    D'Auberteuil, \"Considérations sur la Colonie, etc.,\" 1776;\r\n    Coulon, \"Troubles en Saint Domingue,\" 1798; Malouet, fourth\r\n    volume of his \"Colonial History,\" 1802; Dubroca, \"Toussaint\r\n    l'Ouverture,\" 1802; Tonnerre, \"Mémoires, Histoire d'Haïti,\"\r\n    Port-au-Prince, 1804; Laujon and Montpenay, \"Précis,\" 1805,\r\n    1811, 1814 and 1819; Bercy, \"De St. Domingue,\" Paris, 1814;\r\n    Hérard Dumesle, \"Voyage,\" Port-au-Prince, 1824; Clausson,\r\n    \"Révolution de Saint Domingue,\" 1819; Malo, \"Histoire\r\n    d'Haïti,\" Paris, 1825; Wallez, \"Biography of General Boyer,\"\r\n    1826; Macaulay, \"Abolition d'Esclavage,\" 1835; J. Brown,\r\n    M.D., \"History and Present Condition of Saint Domingo,\" 1837;\r\n    Chaucheprat, \"Le Routier des Antilles,\" 1843; Schoelcher,\r\n    \"Résultats de l'émancipation anglaise,\" 1843; Emile Nau,\r\n    \"Histoire des Caciques d'Haïti,\" 1855; Saint-Amand, \"Histoire\r\n    des Révolutions d'Haïti,\" Paris, 1860; Pradine (ex-minister to\r\n    England), \"Digest of Laws of Hayti,\" Paris, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thorvaldsen: his Life and Works. From the French of Eugene\r\n    Plon, by I.M. Luyster. Boston: Roberts Brothers.\r\n\r\nThorwaldsen's life lasted from 1770 to 1844, and was very industrious.\r\nHe was the son of a Copenhagen ship-carver, and received all his bent\r\nfrom the study of the antique in Italy. The works he left are almost\r\ninnumerable, and some of them will have lasting reputation. The finest\r\nperhaps is his medallion of Night, \"launched with infinite lightness\r\ninto space, carrying in her arms her two children, Sleep and Death.\"\r\nThis masterpiece is said to have been conceived during a sleepless\r\nnight in 1815, and modeled in one day. His Lion at Lucerne, made\r\nto commemorate the Swiss guards at Paris who fell in defending\r\nthe Tuileries, August 10, 1792, is known to every tourist: it is\r\naltogether conventional, but it is not commonplace. \"Never having seen\r\na live lion,\" says his biographer, \"he went to antique statues for\r\ninspiration:\" he thus, at two or three removes from Nature, secured a\r\ngrand, monumental conception, fully charged with human intelligence.\r\nThe colossi of Christ and his Twelve, now to be seen with the artist's\r\nother works at Copenhagen, and formerly exhibited at the World's Fair\r\nin New York, are imposing and classical, while they perhaps show the\r\nabsence of the Christian idea noted in his other clerical subjects.\r\nThorvaldsen, born a Lutheran, was a spectator in Rome of bigotry and\r\nskepticism, and took refuge in artistic impartiality. A friend once\r\nobserving that his want of religious faith must make it difficult\r\nto express Christian ideas in his works, \"If I were altogether an\r\nunbeliever,\" he replied, \"why should that give me any trouble? Have\r\nI not represented pagan divinities?--still, I don't believe in them.\"\r\nThe life of this artist was one of consummate worldly success;\r\nthe kings of Bavaria and Denmark were the personal friends of the\r\nunlettered son of the ship-carver, as were Horace Vernet, Walter\r\nScott, Andersen, and Mendelssohn; his casket of decorations was the\r\namusement of his lady visitors; and his invitations were so constant\r\nthat he could not always remember the name of his host: he was at once\r\nparsimonious and charitable, cheerful and melancholy. His artistic\r\ninfluence was very strong, exhibiting itself in the style of Tenerani,\r\nGalli, Rauch, Drake and Bissen. The life of him by Plon is methodical\r\nand complete, and the American version is illustrated by thirty-five\r\ncareful engravings printed in Paris and gummed upon the sheets.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Expiation. By Mrs. Julia C.R. Dorr, author of \"Sibyl\r\n    Huntington,\" etc. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott & Co.\r\n\r\n_Expiation_ is an interesting American story, with a background of\r\nlonely woods that protect the rustic privacy of Altona, and a list of\r\ncharacters that combine city culture and country eccentricity. Patsy,\r\nthe grim and self-sacrificing \"help,\" who observes drily of a statue\r\nrepresenting Eve with the apple that \"some things is decent and some\r\nthings ain't,\" is the best delineation in it, but the style is always\r\nlively, always feminine and pure, and the conception of the high-bred,\r\naristocratic family, come to bury their mistakes and miseries in a\r\nforest seclusion, would have been thought worthy of being worked up by\r\nEmily Bronté. The catastrophe, where a dumb nun turns out to be a lost\r\nwife given over to the undertakers in a state of catalepsy, is perhaps\r\nnot quite new, but it is striking and vigorously told, and her union\r\nat last with her husband's sons and the girlish bride of one of them\r\nis very touching. The novel is full of local American color, and\r\nentices the attention from the reader's first plunge to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wanderings in Spain. By Augustus J.C. Hare, author of\r\n    \"Memorials of a Quiet Life,\" \"Walks in Rome,\" etc. London:\r\n    Strahan & Co.; New York: Dodd & Mead.\r\n\r\nThis companionable book tells you how to travel over the Spanish\r\nPeninsula by means of a slight knowledge of the Castilian tongue, a\r\nbold infidelity to Murray's _Guide_, a cake of soap and some Liebig's\r\nbroth, and a habit of universal politeness. \"Pardon me, my sister,\"\r\nsaid the author to a beggar-woman at Barcelona: \"does not your worship\r\nsee that I am drawing?\" \"Ah, Dios!\" she answered, \"blind that I was!\r\nworm that I am! So your worship draws? And I--I too am a lover of the\r\narts.\" On the other hand, a stiff-necked Englishman traveling from\r\nSeville to Xeres sent his driver to dine in the kitchen of an inn on\r\nthe road. The driver, who in his heart thought that he would have been\r\ndoing great honor to a heretic by sitting at the same table with him,\r\nconcealed his indignation at the time, but in the middle of the road,\r\nthree or four leagues from Xeres, in a horrible desert full of bogs\r\nand brambles, pushed the Englishman out of the carriage, and cried out\r\nas he whipped on his horse, \"My lord, you did not find me worthy to\r\nsit at your table; and I, Don José Balbino Bustamente y Orozco, find\r\nyou too bad company to occupy a seat in my carriage. Good-night!\"\r\nAnother story, of time-honored repetition, is here restored to what\r\nmay possibly have been its true parentage. A gypsy, on his knees\r\nto his priest, is tempted by the father's snuffbox and steals it.\r\n\"Father,\" he says immediately, \"I have one more confession: I accuse\r\nmyself of stealing a snuffbox.\" \"Then, my son, you must certainly\r\nrestore it.\" \"Will you have it yourself, my father?\" \"I? certainly\r\nnot,\" answered the confessor. \"The fact is,\" proceeded the gypsy,\r\n\"that I have offered it to the owner, and he has refused it.\" \"Then\r\nyou can keep it with a good conscience,\" answered the father. Such are\r\nthe glimpses of Spanish character. We could easily bear to have more\r\nof them; but the author, accompanied with ladies, and an antiquarian\r\nby habit and nature, gives more sketches of ruins, and of landscapes\r\nwhich are usually found \"hideous,\" than of the infinite whims of\r\nnational manners. His contempt for Spanish landscape appears to us to\r\namount to a disease: he scorns honest Murray for describing Valencia's\r\nmud huts as \"pearls set in emeralds,\" and says that O'Shea's eulogy of\r\nher as \"the sultana of Mediterranean cities\" is a glowing picture of\r\nwhat is dismal enough in reality. In fact, we are afraid that Mr. Hare\r\nhas not exactly the artist's eye, and cannot easily admire a scene in\r\nwhich he is not physically comfortable. But he has rich and heart-warm\r\ndescriptions of the Alhambra, the Escorial, and the ruins of Poblet\r\nnear Tarragona, where an order of patrician monks lived in incredible\r\nluxury until a time within present memory, when they were scattered by\r\na tumult and their sculptured home crushed into dry and haggard ruin.\r\nThis book cannot compare with his _Walks in Rome_, which was the\r\ncareful record of a familiar and a resident; but it is the result of\r\na very lively curiosity and the record of a mind evidently stored with\r\nhistory and romance. Excepting Colonel Hay's inimitable _Castilian\r\nDays_, it is the best recent book about the country which it skims\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Marie Derville: A Story of a French Boarding-school. From\r\n    the French of Madame Guizot de Witt, by Mary G. Wells.\r\n    Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott & Co.\r\n\r\nFrench fiction when playing off innocence or when intended for\r\nuncontaminated ears attains a blank intensity of virtue that our own\r\nliterature cannot hope to rival. The French \"juvenile\" still guards\r\nthat beauteous ignorance of slang or of other small vice which the\r\nAmerican schoolboy regards as poverty of resource or incapacity, and\r\nwhich he has put off with his frocks and his _Parent's Assistant_ and\r\nhis _Sanford and Merton_. But _Marie Derville_, when its accent of\r\nBerquin is allowed for, is a varied and interesting tale, affording\r\nmany a glimpse into that country guarded about with such jealous\r\nwalls--middle-class childhood in France. Marie is the child of a\r\nsea-captain who goes to China, disappears for many years, and comes\r\nback at last, after a narrow escape from massacre, saying, \"How\r\nstrange it was to find myself on the eve of becoming a martyr--to\r\ndie for the Christian religion when one is so poor a Christian as\r\nI!\" His wife and two or three of Marie's grandparents meantime unite\r\nto conduct a boarding-school on the sea-shore, the history of which\r\nenterprise forms the bulk of the tale. Here the American reader learns\r\nwith surprise that the French little girl, who is never actually seen\r\notherwise than perfect and doll-like, is really subject in private\r\nto a few of the faults common to Miss Edgeworth's heroines, such as\r\nselfishness, gluttony and laziness. But the story of the school is\r\non the whole sunshiny and prosperous, and _Marie Derville's_ young\r\nreaders will follow with delight the career of these prim little\r\nbeings, so much more governed than themselves, as they go picnicking\r\non the sea-beach for mussels, make flannels for the cholera-patients\r\nof a fishing village, or learn to recite the fable of \"The Country\r\nRat\" without making it all one word in their hurry. The story is very\r\nhealthy and happy, and the translation excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOKS RECEIVED._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Teacher's Companion to the American Drawing-slates and Cards. With\r\nCards.
