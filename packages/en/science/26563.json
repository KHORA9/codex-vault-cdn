For obvious reasons I have\r\naltered the names of the principals, and I hereby pass on the assurance\r\nwhich I have received, that the originals of such as are left alive can\r\nbe found if their discovery be thought desirable. This alteration of\r\nnames, the piecing together of somewhat disconnected and sometimes\r\nnearly indecipherable memoranda, and the reduction of the mass to\r\nconsecutive form, are all that has been required of me or would have\r\nbeen permitted to me. The expedition to Labrador mentioned by the\r\nnarrator has not returned, nor has it ever been definitely traced. He\r\ndoes not undertake to prove that it ever set out. But he avers that all\r\nwhich is hereafter set down is truly told, and he leaves it to mankind\r\nto accept the warning which it has fallen to him to convey, or await the\r\nproof of its sincerity which he believes the end of the century will\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n                                                        ROBERT CROMIE.\r\n\r\nBELFAST, _May, 1895_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

Foolish as the\r\nwords may seem, they were partly influential in leading to my terrible\r\nassociation with him, and all that is described in this book.\r\n\r\nBrande was standing beside me on the starboard side of the vessel. We\r\nhad been discussing a current astronomical essay, as we watched the hazy\r\nblue line of the Irish coast rise on the horizon. This conversation was\r\ninterrupted by Brande, who said, impatiently:\r\n\r\n\"Why tell us of stars distant so far from this insignificant little\r\nworld of ours--so insignificant that even its own inhabitants speak\r\ndisrespectfully of it--that it would take hundreds of years to telegraph\r\nto some of them, thousands to others, and millions to the rest? Why\r\nlimit oneself to a mere million of years for a dramatic illustration,\r\nwhen there is a star in space distant so far from us that if a telegram\r\nleft the earth for it this very night, and maintained for ever its\r\ninitial velocity, it would never reach that star?\"\r\n\r\nHe said this without any apparent effort after rhetorical effect; but\r\nthe suddenness with which he had presented a very obvious truism in a\r\nfresh light to me made the conception of the vastness of space\r\nabsolutely oppressive. In the hope of changing the subject I replied:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is gained by dwelling on these scientific speculations. The\r\nmind is only bewildered. The Universe is inexplicable.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Universe!\" he exclaimed. \"That is easily explained. The Universe is\r\na mistake!\"\r\n\r\n\"The greatest mistake of the century, I suppose,\" I added, somewhat\r\nannoyed, for I thought Brande was laughing at me.\r\n\r\n\"Say, of Time, and I agree with you,\" he replied, careless of my\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nI did not answer him for some moments.\r\n\r\nThis man Brande was young in years, but middle-aged in the expression of\r\nhis pale, intellectual face, and old--if age be synonymous with\r\nknowledge--in his ideas. His knowledge, indeed, was so exhaustive that\r\nthe scientific pleasantries to which he was prone could always be\r\njustified, dialectically at least, by him when he was contradicted.\r\nThose who knew him well did not argue with him. I was always stumbling\r\ninto intellectual pitfalls, for I had only known him since the steamer\r\nleft New York.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, there is little to be told. My history prior to my\r\nacquaintance with Brande was commonplace. I was merely an active,\r\nathletic Englishman, Arthur Marcel by name. I had studied medicine, and\r\nwas a doctor in all but the degree. This certificate had been dispensed\r\nwith owing to an unexpected legacy, on receipt of which I determined to\r\ndevote it to the furtherance of my own amusement. In the pursuit of this\r\nobject, I had visited many lands and had become familiar with most of\r\nthe beaten tracks of travel. I was returning to England after an absence\r\nof three years spent in aimless roaming. My age was thirty-one years,\r\nand my salient characteristic at the time was to hold fast by anything\r\nthat interested me, until my humour changed. Brande's conversational\r\nvagaries had amused me on the voyage. His extraordinary comment on the\r\nUniverse decided me to cement our shipboard acquaintance before reaching\r\nport.\r\n\r\n\"That explanation of yours,\" I said, lighting a fresh cigar, and\r\nreturning to a subject which I had so recently tried to shelve, \"isn't\r\nit rather vague?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the present it must serve,\" he answered absently.\r\n\r\nTo force him into admitting that his phrase was only a thoughtless\r\nexclamation, or induce him to defend it, I said:\r\n\r\n\"It does not serve any reasonable purpose. It adds nothing to knowledge.\r\nAs it stands, it is neither academic nor practical.\"\r\n\r\nBrande looked at me earnestly for a moment, and then said gravely:\r\n\r\n\"The academic value of the explanation will be shown to you if you will\r\njoin a society I have founded; and its practicalness will soon be made\r\nplain whether you join or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you call this club of yours?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"We do not call it a club. We call it a Society--the _Cui Bono_\r\nSociety,\" he answered coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I like the name,\" I returned. \"It is suggestive. It may mean\r\nanything--or nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will learn later that the Society means something; a good deal, in\r\nfact.\"\r\n\r\nThis was said in the dry, unemotional tone which I afterwards found was\r\nthe only sign of displeasure Brande ever permitted himself to show. His\r\narrangements for going on shore at Queenstown had been made early in the\r\nday, but he left me to look for his sister, of whom I had seen very\r\nlittle on the voyage. The weather had been rough, and as she was not a\r\ngood sailor, I had only had a rare glimpse of a very dark and handsome\r\ngirl, whose society possessed for me a strange attraction, although we\r\nwere then almost strangers. Indeed, I regretted keenly, as the time of\r\nour separation approached, having registered my luggage (consisting\r\nlargely of curios and mementoes of my travels, of which I was very\r\ncareful) for Liverpool. My own time was valueless, and it would have\r\nbeen more agreeable to me to continue the journey with the Brandes, no\r\nmatter where they went.\r\n\r\nThere was a choppy sea on when we reached the entrance to the harbour,\r\nso the _Majestic_ steamed in between the Carlisle and Camden forts, and\r\non to the man-of-war roads, where the tender met us. By this time,\r\nBrande and his sister were ready to go on shore; but as there was a\r\nheavy mail to be transhipped, we had still an hour at our disposal. For\r\nsome time we paced the deck, exchanging commonplaces on the voyage and\r\nconfidences as to our future plans. It was almost dark, but not dark\r\nenough to prevent us from seeing those wonderfully green hills which\r\nlandlock the harbour. To me the verdant woods and hills were delightful\r\nafter the brown plains and interminable prairies on which I had spent\r\nmany months. As the lights of Queenstown began to speck the slowly\r\ngathering gloom, Miss Brande asked me to point out Rostellan Castle. It\r\ncould not be seen from the vessel, but the familiar legend was easily\r\nrecalled, and this led us to talk about Irish tradition with its weird\r\nromance and never failing pathos. This interested her. Freed now from\r\nthe lassitude of sea-sickness, the girl became more fascinating to me\r\nevery moment. Everything she said was worth listening to, apart from the\r\ncharming manner in which it was said.\r\n\r\nTo declare that she was an extremely pretty girl would not convey the\r\nstrange, almost unearthly, beauty of her face--as intellectual as her\r\nbrother's--and of the charm of her slight but exquisitely moulded\r\nfigure. In her dark eyes there was a sympathy, a compassion, that was\r\nnew to me. It thrilled me with an emotion different from anything that\r\nmy frankly happy, but hitherto wholly selfish life had known. There was\r\nonly one note in her conversation which jarred upon me. She was apt to\r\ndrift into the extraordinary views of life and death which were\r\ninteresting when formulated by her eccentric brother, but pained me\r\ncoming from her lips. In spite of this, the purpose I had contemplated\r\nof joining Brande's Society--evoked as it had been by his own whimsical\r\nobservation--now took definite form. I would join that Society. It would\r\nbe the best way of keeping near to Natalie Brande.\r\n\r\nHer brother returned to us to say that the tender was about to leave the\r\nship. He had left us for half an hour. I did not notice his absence\r\nuntil he himself announced it. As we shook hands, I said to him:\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking about that Society of yours. I mean to join it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad,\" he replied. \"You will find it a new sensation, quite\r\noutside the beaten track, which you know so well.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a shade of half-kindly contempt in his voice, which missed me\r\nat the moment. I answered gaily, knowing that he would not be offended\r\nby what was said in jest:\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I shall. If all the members are as mad as yourself, it will\r\nbe the most interesting experience outside Bedlam that any man could\r\nwish for.\"\r\n\r\nI had a foretaste of that interest soon.\r\n\r\nAs Miss Brande was walking to the gangway, a lamp shone full upon her\r\ngypsy face. The blue-black hair, the dark eyes, and a deep red rose she\r\nwore in her bonnet, seemed to me an exquisite arrangement of harmonious\r\ncolour. And the thought flashed into my mind very vividly, however\r\ntrivial it may seem here, when written down in cold words: \"The queen of\r\nwomen, and the queen of flowers.\" That is not precisely how my thought\r\nran, but I cannot describe it better. The finer subtleties of the brain\r\ndo not bear well the daylight of language.\r\n\r\nBrande drew her back and whispered to her. Then the sweet face, now\r\nslightly flushed, was turned to me again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you for that pretty thought,\" she said with a pleasant smile.\r\n\"You are too flattering. The 'queen of flowers' is very true, but the\r\n'queen of women!' Oh, no!\" She made a graceful gesture of dissent, and\r\npassed down the gangway.\r\n\r\nAs the tender disappeared into the darkness, a tiny scrap of lace waved,\r\nand I knew vaguely that she was thinking of me. But how she read my\r\nthought so exactly I could not tell.\r\n\r\nThat knowledge it has been my fate to gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA STRANGE EXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival in London, I called on Brande, at the address he\r\nhad given me in Brook Street. He received me with the pleasant\r\naffability which a man of the world easily assumes, and his apology for\r\nbeing unable to pass the evening with me in his own house was a model of\r\nsocial style. The difficulty in the way was practically an\r\nimpossibility. His Society had a meeting on that evening, and it was\r\nimperative that he should be present.\r\n\r\n\"Why not come yourself?\" he said. \"It is what we might call a guest\r\nnight. That is, visitors, if friends of members, are admitted, and as\r\nthis privilege may not be again accorded to outsiders, you ought to come\r\nbefore you decide finally to join us. I must go now, but Natalie\" (he\r\ndid not say \"Miss Brande\") \"will entertain you and bring you to the\r\nhall. It is very near--in Hanover Square.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very glad indeed to bring Miss Brande to the hall,\" I\r\nanswered, changing the sentence in order to correct Brande's too\r\npatronising phrase.\r\n\r\n\"The same thing in different words, is it not? If you prefer it that\r\nway, please have it so.\" His imperturbability was unaffected.\r\n\r\nMiss Brande here entered the room. Her brother, with a word of renewed\r\napology, left us, and presently I saw him cross the street and hail a\r\npassing hansom.\r\n\r\n\"You must not blame him for running off,\" Miss Brande said. \"He has much\r\nto think of, and the Society depends almost wholly on himself.\"\r\n\r\nI stammered out that I did not blame him at all, and indeed my\r\ndisclaimer was absolutely true. Brande could not have pleased me better\r\nthan he had done by relieving us of his company.\r\n\r\nMiss Brande made tea, which I pretended to enjoy in the hope of pleasing\r\nher. Over this we talked more like old and well proven friends than mere\r\nacquaintances of ten days' standing. Just once or twice the mysterious\r\nchord which marred the girl's charming conversation was touched. She\r\nimmediately changed the subject on observing my distress. I say\r\ndistress, for a weaker word would not fittingly describe the emotion I\r\nfelt whenever she blundered into the pseudo-scientific nonsense which\r\nwas her brother's favourite affectation. At least, it seemed nonsense to\r\nme. I could not well foresee then that the theses which appeared to be\r\nmere theoretical absurdities, would ever be proven--as they have\r\nbeen--very terrible realities. On subjects of ordinary educational\r\ninterest my hostess displayed such full knowledge of the question and\r\nease in dealing with it, that I listened, fascinated, as long as she\r\nchose to continue speaking. It was a novel and delightful experience to\r\nhear a girl as handsome as a pictorial masterpiece, and dressed like a\r\ncourt beauty, discourse with the knowledge, and in the language, of the\r\noldest philosopher. But this was only one of the many surprising\r\ncombinations in her complex personality. My noviciate was still in its\r\nfirst stage.\r\n\r\nThe time to set out for the meeting arrived all too soon for my\r\ninclination. We decided to walk, the evening being fine and not too\r\nwarm, and the distance only a ten minutes' stroll. At a street crossing,\r\nwe met a crowd unusually large for that neighbourhood. Miss Brande\r\nagain surprised me. She was watching the crowd seething and swarming\r\npast. Her dark eyes followed the people with a strange wondering,\r\npitying look which I did not understand. Her face, exquisite in its\r\nexpression at all times, was now absolutely transformed, beatified.\r\nBrande had often spoken to me of mesmerism, clairvoyance, and similar\r\nsubjects, and it occurred to me that he had used his sister as a medium,\r\na clairvoyante. Her brain was not, therefore, under normal control. I\r\ndetermined instantly to tell him on the first opportunity that if he did\r\nnot wish to see the girl permanently injured, he would have to curtail\r\nhis hypnotic influence.\r\n\r\n\"It is rather a stirring sight,\" I said so sharply to Miss Brande that\r\nshe started. I meant to startle her, but did not succeed as far as I\r\nwished.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very terrible sight,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there is no danger,\" I said hastily, and drew her hand over my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Danger! I was not thinking of danger.\"\r\n\r\nAs she did not remove her hand, I did not infringe the silence which\r\nfollowed this, until a break in the traffic allowed us to cross the\r\nstreet. Then I said:\r\n\r\n\"May I ask what you were thinking of just now, Miss Brande?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the people--their lives--their work--their misery!\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you many are very happy,\" I replied. \"You take a morbid view.\r\nMisery is not the rule. I am sure the majority are happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What difference does that make?\" the girl said with a sigh. \"What is\r\nthe end of it all--the meaning of it all? Their happiness! _Cui Bono?_\"\r\n\r\nWe walked on in silence, while I turned over in my mind what she had\r\nsaid. I could come to no conclusion upon it save that my dislike for her\r\nenigmatic aberrations was becoming more intense as my liking for the\r\ngirl herself increased. To change the current of her thoughts and my\r\nown, I asked her abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"Are you a member of the _Cui Bono_ Society?\"\r\n\r\n\"I! Oh, no. Women are not allowed to join--for the present.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to hear it,\" I said heartily, \"and I hope the rule will\r\ncontinue in force.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me in surprise. \"Why should you mind? You are joining\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is different. I don't approve of ladies mixing themselves up in\r\nthese curious and perhaps questionable societies.\"\r\n\r\nMy remark amused her. Her eyes sparkled with simple fun. The change in\r\nher manner was very agreeable to me.\r\n\r\n\"I might have expected that.\" To my extreme satisfaction she now looked\r\nalmost mischievous. \"Herbert told me you were a little--\"\r\n\r\n\"A little what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a little--you won't be vexed? That is right. He said a\r\nlittle--mediæval.\"\r\n\r\nThis abated my appreciation of her sense of humour, and I maintained a\r\ndignified reticence, which unhappily she regarded as mere sullenness,\r\nuntil we reached the Society's room.\r\n\r\nThe place was well filled, and the company, in spite of the\r\nextravagantly modern costumes of the younger women, which I cannot\r\ndescribe better than by saying that there was little difference in it\r\nfrom that of ordinary male attire, was quite conventional in so far as\r\nthe interchange of ordinary courtesies went. When, however, any member\r\nof the Society mingled with a group of visitors, the conversation was\r\nsoon turned into a new channel. Secrets of science, which I had been\r\naccustomed to look upon as undiscoverable, were bandied about like the\r\nmerest commonplaces of education. The absurdity of individuality and the\r\nsubjectivity of the emotions were alike insisted on without notice of\r\nthe paradox, which to me appeared extreme. The Associates were\r\naltruistic for the sake of altruism, not for the sake of its\r\nbeneficiaries. They were not pantheists, for they saw neither universal\r\ngood nor God, but rather evil in all things--themselves included. Their\r\ntalk, however, was brilliant, and, with allowance for its jarring\r\nsentiments, it possessed something of the indefinable charm which\r\nfollowed Brande. My reflections on this identity of interest were\r\ninterrupted by the man himself. After a word of welcome he said:\r\n\r\n\"Let me show you our great experiment; that which touches the high-water\r\nmark of scientific achievement in the history of humanity. It is not\r\nmuch in itself, but it is the pioneer of many marvels.\"\r\n\r\nHe brought me to a metal stand, on which a small instrument constructed\r\nof some white metal was placed. A large number of wires were connected\r\nwith various portions of it, and these wires passed into the side-wall\r\nof the building.\r\n\r\nIn appearance, this marvel of micrology, so far as the eye-piece and\r\nupper portions went, was like an ordinary microscope, but its magnifying\r\npower was to me unbelievable. It magnified the object under examination\r\nmany thousand times more than the most powerful microscope in the world.\r\n\r\nI looked through the upper lens, and saw a small globe suspended in the\r\nmiddle of a tiny chamber filled with soft blue light, or transparent\r\nmaterial. Circling round this globe four other spheres revolved in\r\norbits, some almost circular, some elliptical, some parabolic. As I\r\nlooked, Brande touched a key, and the little globules began to fly more\r\nrapidly round their primary, and make wider sweeps in their revolutions.\r\nAnother key was pressed, and the revolving spheres slowed down and drew\r\ncloser until I could scarcely distinguish any movement. The globules\r\nseemed to form a solid ball.\r\n\r\n\"Attend now!\" Brande exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe tapped the first key sharply. A little grey cloud obscured the blue\r\nlight. When it cleared away, the revolving globes had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of it?\" he asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"What is it? What does it mean? Is it the solar system or some other\r\nsystem illustrated in miniature? I am sorry for the misadventure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are partly correct,\" Brande replied. \"It is an illustration of a\r\nplanetary system, though a small one. But there was no misadventure. I\r\ncaused the somewhat dangerous result you witnessed, the wreckage not\r\nmerely of the molecule of marsh gas you were examining--which any\r\neducated chemist might do as easily as I--but the wreckage of its\r\nconstituent atoms. This is a scientific victory which dwarfs the work of\r\nHelmholtz, Avogadro, or Mendelejeff. The immortal Dalton himself\" (the\r\nword \"immortal\" was spoken with a sneer) \"might rise from his grave to\r\nwitness it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Atoms--molecules! What are you talking about?\" I asked, bewildered.\r\n\r\n\"You were looking on at the death of a molecule--a molecule of marsh\r\ngas, as I have already said. It was caused by a process which I would\r\ndescribe to you if I could reduce my own life work--and that of every\r\nscientific amateur who has preceded me since the world began--into half\r\na dozen sentences. As that would be difficult, I must ask you to accept\r\nmy personal assurance that you witnessed a fact, not a fiction of my\r\nimagination.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your instrument is so perfect that it not only renders molecules\r\nand atoms but their diffusion visible? It is a microscopic\r\nimpossibility. At least it is amazing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" Brande exclaimed impatiently. \"My instrument does certainly\r\nmagnify to a marvellous extent, but not by the old device of the simple\r\nmicroscope, which merely focussed a large area of light rays into a\r\nsmall one. So crude a process could never show an atom to the human eye.\r\nI add much to that. I restore to the rays themselves the luminosity\r\nwhich they lost in their passage through our atmosphere. I give them\r\nback all their visual properties, and turn them with their full etheric\r\nblaze on the object under examination. Great as that achievement is, I\r\ndeny that it is amazing. It may amaze a Papuan to see his eyelash\r\nmagnified to the size of a wire, or an uneducated Englishman to see a\r\ncheese-mite magnified to the size of a midge. It should not amaze you\r\nto see a simple process a little further developed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does the danger you spoke of come in?\" I asked with a pretence of\r\ninterest. Candidly, I did not believe a single word that Brande had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"If you will consult a common text-book on the physics of the ether,\" he\r\nreplied, \"you will find that one grain of matter contains sufficient\r\nenergy, if etherised, to raise a hundred thousand tons nearly two miles.\r\nIn face of such potentiality it is not wise to wreck incautiously even\r\nthe atoms of a molecule.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the limits to this description of scientific experiment? Where are\r\nthey?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no limits,\" Brande said decisively. \"No man can say to\r\nscience 'thus far and no farther.' No man ever has been able to do so.\r\nNo man ever shall!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\"IT IS GOOD TO BE ALIVE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the letters lying on my breakfast-table a few days after the\r\nmeeting was one addressed in an unfamiliar hand. The writing was bold,\r\nand formed like a man's. There was a faint trace of a perfume about the\r\nenvelope which I remembered. I opened it first.\r\n\r\nIt was, as I expected, from Miss Brande. Her brother had gone to their\r\ncountry place on the southern coast. She and her friend, Edith Metford,\r\nwere going that day. Their luggage was already at the station. Would I\r\nsend on what I required for a short visit, and meet them at eleven\r\no'clock on the bridge over the Serpentine? It was enough for me. I\r\npacked a large portmanteau hastily, sent it to Charing Cross, and spent\r\nthe time at my disposal in the park, which was close to my hotel.\r\n\r\nAlthough the invitation I had received gave me pleasure, I could not\r\naltogether remove from my mind a vague sense of disquietude concerning\r\nHerbert Brande and his Society. The advanced opinions I had heard, if\r\nextreme, were not altogether alarming. But the mysterious way in which\r\nBrande himself had spoken about the Society, and the still more\r\nmysterious air which some of the members assumed when directly\r\nquestioned as to its object, suggested much. Might it not be a\r\nrevolutionary party engaged in a grave intrigue--a branch of some\r\nforeign body whose purpose was so dangerous that ordinary disguises were\r\nnot considered sufficiently secure? Might they not have adopted the\r\njargon and pretended to the opinions of scientific faddists as a cloak\r\nfor designs more sinister and sincere? The experiment I witnessed might\r\nbe almost a miracle or merely a trick. Thinking it over thus, I could\r\ncome to no final opinion, and when I asked myself aloud, \"What are you\r\nafraid of?\" I could not answer my own question. But I thought I would\r\ndefer joining the Society pending further information.\r\n\r\nA few minutes before eleven, I walked towards the bridge over the\r\nSerpentine. No ladies appeared to be on it. There were only a couple of\r\nsmartly dressed youths there, one smoking a cigarette. I sauntered about\r\nuntil one of the lads, the one who was not smoking, looked up and\r\nbeckoned to me. I approached leisurely, for it struck me that the boy\r\nwould have shown better breeding if he had come toward me, considering\r\nmy seniority.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry I did not notice you sooner. Why did you not come on when\r\nyou saw us?\" the smallest and slimmest youth called to me.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of--Miss--Miss--\" I stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Brande; you haven't forgotten my name, I hope,\" Natalie Brande said\r\ncoolly. \"This is my friend, Edith Metford. Metford, this is Arthur\r\nMarcel.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Marcel? I am glad to meet you; I have heard 'favourable\r\nmention' of you from the Brandes,\" the second figure in knickerbockers\r\nsaid pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, sir--madam--I mean--Miss--\" I blundered, and then in\r\ndespair I asked Miss Brande, \"Is this a tableau vivant? What is the\r\nmeaning of these disguises?\" My embarrassment was so great that my\r\ndiscourteous question may be pardoned.\r\n\r\n\"Our dress! Surely you have seen women rationally dressed before!\" Miss\r\nBrande answered complacently, while the other girl watched my\r\nastonishment with evident amusement.\r\n\r\nThis second girl, Edith Metford, was a frank, handsome young woman, but\r\nunlike the spirituelle beauty of Natalie Brande. She was perceptibly\r\ntaller than her friend, and of fuller figure. In consequence, she\r\nlooked, in my opinion, to even less advantage in her eccentric costume,\r\nor rational dress, than did Miss Brande.\r\n\r\n\"Rationally dressed! Oh, yes. I know the divided skirt, but--\"\r\n\r\nMiss Metford interrupted me. \"Do you call the divided skirt atrocity\r\nrational dress?\" she asked pointedly.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my honour I do not,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nThese girls were too advanced in their ideas of dress for me. Nor did I\r\nfeel at all at my ease during this conversation, which did not, however,\r\nappear to embarrass them. I proposed hastily to get a cab, but they\r\ndemurred. It was such a lovely day, they preferred to walk, part of the\r\nway at least. I pointed out that there might be drawbacks to this\r\namendment of my proposal.\r\n\r\n\"What drawbacks?\" Miss Metford asked.\r\n\r\n\"For instance, isn't it probable we shall all be arrested by the\r\npolice?\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish! We are not in Russia,\" both exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Which is lucky for you,\" I reflected, as we commenced what was to me a\r\nmost disagreeable walk. I got them into a cab sooner than they wished.\r\nAt the railway station I did not offer to procure their tickets. To do\r\nso, I felt, would only give offence. Critical glances followed us as we\r\nwent to our carriage. Londoners are becoming accustomed to varieties, if\r\nnot vagaries, in ladies' costumes, but the dress of my friends was\r\nevidently a little out of the common even for them. Miss Metford was\r\njust turning the handle of a carriage door, when I interposed, saying,\r\n\"This is a smoking compartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I see. I am going to smoke--if you don't object?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose it would make any difference if I did,\" I said, with\r\nunconscious asperity, for indeed this excess of free manners was jarring\r\nupon me. The line dividing it from vulgarity was becoming so thin I was\r\nlosing sight of the divisor. Yet no one, even the most fastidious,\r\ncould associate vulgarity with Natalie Brande. There remained an air of\r\nunassumed sincerity about herself and all her actions, including even\r\nher dress, which absolutely excluded her from hostile criticism. I could\r\nnot, however, extend that lenient judgment to Miss Metford. The girls\r\nspoke and acted--as they had dressed themselves--very much alike. Only,\r\nwhat seemed to me in the one a natural eccentricity, seemed in the other\r\nan unnatural affectation.\r\n\r\nI saw the guard passing, and, calling him over, gave him half-a-crown to\r\nhave the compartment labelled, \"Engaged.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Brande, who had been looking out of the window, absently asked my\r\nreason for this precaution. I replied that I wanted the compartment\r\nreserved for ourselves. I certainly did not want any staring and\r\notherwise offensive fellow-passengers.\r\n\r\n\"We don't want all the seats,\" she persisted.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I admitted. \"We don't want the extra seats. But I thought you\r\nmight like the privacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The desire for privacy is an archaic emotion,\" Miss Metford remarked\r\nsententiously, as she struck a match.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, it is so selfish. We may be crowding others,\" Miss Brande said\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nI was glad she did not smoke.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want that now,\" I said to a porter who was hurrying up with a\r\nlabel. To the girls I remarked a little snappishly, \"Of course you are\r\nquite right. You must excuse my ignorance.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not ignorance,\" Miss Brande demurred. \"You have been away so\r\nmuch. You have hardly been in England, you told me, for years, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And progress has been marching in my absence,\" I interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"So it seems,\" Miss Metford remarked so significantly that I really\r\ncould not help retorting with as much emphasis, compatible with\r\npoliteness, as I could command:\r\n\r\n\"You see I am therefore unable to appreciate the New Woman, of whom I\r\nhave heard so much since I came home.\"\r\n\r\n\"The conventional New Woman is a grandmotherly old fossil,\" Miss Metford\r\nsaid quietly.\r\n\r\nThis disposed of me. I leant back in my seat, and was rigidly silent.\r\n\r\nMiles of green fields stippled with daisies and bordered with long\r\nlines of white and red hawthorn hedges flew past. The smell of new-mown\r\nhay filled the carriage with its sweet perfume, redolent of old\r\nassociations. My long absence dwindled to a short holiday. The world's\r\nwide highways were far off. I was back in the English fields. My slight\r\nannoyance passed away. I fell into a pleasant day-dream, which was\r\nbroken by a soft voice, every undulation of which I already knew by\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you think us very advanced,\" it murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" I agreed, \"but I look to you to bring even me up to date.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, we mean to do that, but we must proceed very gradually.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have made an excellent start,\" I put in.\r\n\r\n\"Otherwise you would only be shocked.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite possible.\" I said this with so much conviction that the two\r\nburst out laughing at me. I could not think of anything more to add, and\r\nI felt relieved when, with a warning shriek, the train dashed into a\r\ntunnel. By the time we had emerged again into the sunlight and the\r\nsolitude of the open landscape I had ready an impromptu which I had\r\nbeen working at in the darkness. I looked straight at Miss Metford and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"After all, it is very pleasant to travel with girls like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not show any hysterical fear of my kissing you in the tunnel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why the deuce would you do that?\" Miss Metford replied with great\r\ncomposure, as she blew a smoke ring.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached our destination I braced myself for another disagreeable\r\nminute or two. For if the great Londoners thought us quaint, surely the\r\nlittle country station idlers would swear we were demented. We crossed\r\nthe platform so quickly that the wonderment we created soon passed. Our\r\nluggage was looked after by a servant, to whose care I confided it with\r\na very brief description. The loss of an item of it did not seem to me\r\nof as much importance as our own immediate departure.\r\n\r\nBrande met us at his hall door. His house was a pleasant one, covered\r\nwith flowering creeping plants, and surrounded by miniature forests. In\r\nfront there was a lake four hundred yards in width. Close-shaven lawns\r\nbordered it. They were artificial products, no doubt, but they were\r\nartificial successes--undulating, earth-scented, fresh rolled every\r\nmorning. Here there was an isolated shrub, there a thick bank of\r\nrhododendrons. And the buds, bursting into floral carnival, promised\r\nfine contrasts when their full splendour was come. The lake wavelets\r\ntinkled musically on a pebbly beach.\r\n\r\nOur host could not entertain us in person. He was busy. The plea was\r\nevidently sincere, notwithstanding that the business of a country\r\ngentleman--which he now seemed to be--is something less exacting than\r\nbusy people's leisure. After a short rest, and an admirably-served\r\nlunch, we were dismissed to the woods for our better amusement.\r\n\r\nThereafter followed for me a strangely peaceful, idyllic day--all save\r\nits ending. Looking back on it, I know that the sun which set that\r\nevening went down on the last of my happiness. But it all seems trivial\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nMy companions were accomplished botanists, and here, for the first time,\r\nI found myself on common ground with both. We discussed every familiar\r\nwild flower as eagerly as if we had been professed field naturalists. In\r\nwalking or climbing my assistance was neither requisitioned nor\r\nrequired. I did not offer, therefore, what must have been unwelcome when\r\nit was superfluous.\r\n\r\nWe rested at last under the shade of a big beech, for the afternoon sun\r\nwas rather oppressive. It was a pleasant spot to while away an hour. A\r\npurling brook went babbling by, singing to itself as it journeyed to the\r\nsea. Insects droned about in busy flight. There was a perfume of\r\nhoneysuckle wafted to us on the summer wind, which stirred the\r\nbeech-tree and rustled its young leaves lazily, so that the sunlight\r\npeeped through the green lattice-work and shone on the faces of these\r\ntwo handsome girls, stretched in graceful postures on the cool sward\r\nbelow--their white teeth sparkling in its brilliance, while their soft\r\nlaughter made music for me. In the fulness of my heart, I said aloud:\r\n\r\n\"It is a good thing to be alive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGEORGE DELANY--DECEASED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is a good thing to be alive,\" Natalie Brande repeated slowly,\r\ngazing, as it were, far off through her half-closed eyelids. Then\r\nturning to me and looking at me full, wide-eyed, she asked: \"A good\r\nthing for how many?\"\r\n\r\n\"For all; for everything that is alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faugh! For few things that are alive. For hardly anything. You say it\r\nis a good thing to be alive. How often have you said that in your life?\"\r\n\r\n\"All my life through,\" I answered stoutly. My constitution was a good\r\none, and I had lived healthily, if hardily. I voiced the superfluous\r\nvitality of a well nourished body.\r\n\r\n\"Then you do not know what it is to feel for others.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a scream in the underwood near us. It ended in a short,\r\nchoking squeak. The girl paled, but she went on with outward calm.\r\n\r\n\"That hawk or cat feels as you do. I wonder what that young rabbit\r\nthinks of life's problem?\"\r\n\r\n\"But we are neither hawks nor cats, nor even young rabbits,\" I answered\r\nwarmly. \"We can not bear the burthens of the whole animal world. Our own\r\nare sufficient for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right. They are more than sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nI had made a false move, and so tried to recover my lost ground. She\r\nwould not permit me. The conversation which had run in pleasant channels\r\nfor two happy hours was ended. Thenceforth, in spite of my obstructive\r\nefforts, subjects were introduced which could not be conversed on but\r\nmust be discussed. On every one Miss Brande took the part of the weak\r\nagainst the strong, oblivious of every consideration of policy and even\r\nethics, careful only that she championed the weak because of their\r\nweakness. Miss Metford abetted her in this, and went further in their\r\njoint revolt against common sense. Miss Brande was argumentative,\r\npleading. Miss Metford was defiant. Between the two I fared ill.\r\n\r\nOf course the Woman question was soon introduced, and in this I made the\r\nbest defence of time-honoured customs of which I was capable. But my\r\noutworks fell down as promptly before the voices of these young women as\r\ndid the walls of Jericho before the blast of a ram's horn. Nothing that\r\nI had cherished was left to me. Woman no longer wanted man's protection.\r\n(\"Enslavement\" they called it.) Why should she, when in the evolution of\r\nsociety there was not now, or presently would not be, anything from\r\nwhich to protect her? (\"Competing slaveowners\" was what they said.) When\r\nyou wish to behold protectors you must postulate dangers. The first are\r\nvalueless save as a preventive of the second. Both evils will be\r\nconveniently dispensed with. All this was new to me, most of my thinking\r\nlife having been passed in distant lands, where the science of ethics is\r\ncodified into a simple statute--the will of the strongest.\r\n\r\nWhen my dialectical humiliation was within one point of completion, Miss\r\nMetford came to my rescue. For some time she had looked on at my\r\ndiscomfiture with a good-natured neutrality, and when I was\r\nmetaphorically in my last ditch, she arose, stretched her shapely\r\nfigure, flicked some clinging grass blades from her suit, and declared\r\nit was time to return. Brande was a man of science, but as such he was\r\nstill amenable to punctuality in the matter of dinner.\r\n\r\nOn the way back I was discreetly silent. When we reached the house I\r\nwent to look for Herbert Brande. He was engaged in his study, and I\r\ncould not intrude upon him there. To do so would be to infringe the only\r\nrigid rule in his household. Nor had I an opportunity of speaking to him\r\nalone until after dinner, when I induced him to take a turn with me\r\nround the lake. I smoked strong cigars, and made one of these my excuse.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting when we started, and as we walked slowly the\r\ntwilight shadows were deepening fast by the time we reached the further\r\nshore. Brande was in high spirits. Some new scientific experiment, I\r\nassumed, had come off successfully. He was beside himself. His\r\nconversation was volcanic. Now it rumbled and roared with suppressed\r\nfires. Anon, it burst forth in scintillating flashes and shot out\r\nstreams of quickening wit. I have been his auditor in the three great\r\nepochs of his life, but I do not think that anything that I have\r\nrecollected of his utterances equals the bold impromptus, the masterly\r\nhandling of his favourite subject, the Universe, which fell from him on\r\nthat evening. I could not answer him. I could not even follow him, much\r\nless suppress him. But I had come forth with a specific object in view,\r\nand I would not be gainsaid. And so, as my business had to be done\r\nbetter that it should be done quickly. Taking advantage of a pause which\r\nhe made, literally for breath, I commenced abruptly:\r\n\r\n\"I want to speak to you about your sister.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned on me surprised. Then his look changed to one of such complete\r\ncontempt, and withal his bearing suggested so plainly that he knew\r\nbeforehand what I was going to say, that I blurted out defiantly, and\r\nwithout stopping to choose my words:\r\n\r\n\"I think it an infernal shame that you, her brother, should allow her to\r\nmasquerade about with this good-natured but eccentric Metford girl--I\r\nshould say Miss Metford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" he asked coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Because it is absurd; and because it isn't decent.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Abraham,\" Brande said quietly, \"or is your period so recent as\r\nthat of Isaac or Jacob? My sister pleases herself in these matters, and\r\nhas every right to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has not. You are her brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I am her brother. She has no right to think for herself; no\r\nright to live save by my permission. Then I graciously permit her to\r\nthink, and I allow her to live.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be sorry for this nonsense sooner or later--and don't say I\r\ndidn't warn you.\" The absolute futility of my last clause struck me\r\npainfully at the moment, but I could not think of any way to better it.\r\nIt was hard to reason with such a man, one who denied the fundamental\r\nprinciples of family life. I was thinking over what to say next, when\r\nBrande stopped and put his hand, in a kindly way, upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"My good fellow,\" he said, \"what does it matter? What do the actions of\r\nmy sister signify more than the actions of any other man's sister? And\r\nwhat about the Society? Have you made up your mind about joining?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have. I made it up twice to-day,\" I answered. \"I made it up in the\r\nmorning that I would see yourself and your Society to the devil before I\r\nwould join it. Excuse my bluntness; but you are so extremely candid\r\nyourself you will not mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I do not mind bluntness. Rudeness is superfluous.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I made it up this evening,\" I said, a little less aggressively,\r\n\"that I would join it if the devil himself were already in it, as I half\r\nsuspect he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like that,\" Brande said gravely. \"That is the spirit I want in the\r\nman who joins me.\"\r\n\r\nTo which I replied: \"What under the sun is the object of this Society of\r\nyours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Proximately to complete our investigations--already far advanced--into\r\nthe origin of the Universe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And ultimately?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you now. You will not know that until you join us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if your ultimate object does not suit me, I can withdraw?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it would then be too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so? I am not morally bound by an oath which I swear without full\r\nknowledge of its consequences and responsibilities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oath! The oath you swear! You swear no oath. Do you fancy you are\r\njoining a society of Rechabites or Carmelites, or mediæval rubbish of\r\nthat kind. Don't keep so painstakingly behind the age.\"\r\n\r\nI thought for a moment over what this mysterious man had said, over the\r\nhidden dangers in which his mad chimeras might involve the most innocent\r\naccomplice. Then I thought of that dark-eyed, sweet-voiced, young girl,\r\nas she lay on the green grass under the beech-tree in the wood and\r\nout-argued me on every point. Very suddenly, and, perhaps, in a manner\r\nsomewhat grandiose, I answered him:\r\n\r\n\"I will join your Society for my own purpose, and I will quit it when I\r\nchoose.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have every right,\" Brande said carelessly. \"Many have done the same\r\nbefore you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you introduce me to any one who has done so?\" I asked, with an\r\neagerness that could not be dissembled.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I can not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or give me an address?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, that is simple.\" He turned over a note-book until he found a\r\nblank page. Then he drew the pencil from its loop, put the point to his\r\nlips, and paused. He was standing with his back to the failing light, so\r\nI could not see the expression of his mobile face. When he paused, I\r\nknew that no ordinary doubt beset him. He stood thus for nearly a\r\nminute. While he waited, I watched a pair of swans flit ghost-like over\r\nthe silken surface of the lake. Between us and a dark bank of wood the\r\nlights of the house flamed red. The melancholy even-song of a blackbird\r\nwailed out from a shrubbery beside us. Then Herbert Brande wrote in his\r\nnote-book, and tearing out the page, he handed it to me, saying: \"That\r\nis the address of the last man who quitted us.\"\r\n\r\nThe light was now so dim I had to hold the paper close to my eyes in\r\norder to read the lines. They were these--\r\n\r\n    GEORGE DELANY,\r\n      Near Saint Anne's Chapel,\r\n            Woking Cemetery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE MURDER CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Delany was the last man who quitted us--you see I use your expression\r\nagain. I like it,\" Brande said quietly, watching me as he spoke.\r\n\r\nI stood staring at the slip of paper which I held in my hand for some\r\nmoments before I could reply. When my voice came back, I asked hoarsely:\r\n\r\n\"Did this man, Delany, die suddenly after quitting the Society?\"\r\n\r\n\"He died immediately. The second event was contemporaneous with the\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in consequence of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have all the members who retired from your list been equally\r\nshort-lived?\"\r\n\r\n\"Without any exception whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your Society, after all your high-flown talk about it, is only a\r\nvulgar murder club,\" I said bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Wrong in fact, and impertinent in its expression. It is not a murder\r\nclub, and--well, you are the first to discover its vulgarity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I call things by their plain names. You may call your Society what you\r\nplease. As to my joining it in face of what you have told me--\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is more than was ever told to any man before he joined--to any\r\nman living or dead. And more, you need not join it yet unless you still\r\nwish to do so. I presume what I have said will prevent you.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, if I had any doubt, or if there was any possibility of\r\nmy wavering before this interview, there is none now. I join at once.\"\r\n\r\nHe would have taken my hand, but that I could not permit. I left him\r\nwithout another word, or any form of salute, and returned to the house.\r\nI did not appear again in the domestic circle that evening, for I had\r\nenough upon my mind without further burdening myself with social\r\npretences.\r\n\r\nI sat in my room and tried once more to consider my position. It was\r\nthis: for the sake of a girl whom I had only met some score of times;\r\nwho sometimes acted, talked, dressed after a fashion suggestive of\r\ninsanity; who had glorious dark eyes, a perfect figure, and an\r\nexquisitely beautiful face--but I interrupt myself. For the sake of this\r\ngirl, and for the manifestly impossible purpose of protecting her from\r\nherself as well as others, I had surrendered myself to the probable\r\nvengeance of a band of cut-throats if I betrayed them, and to the\r\ncertain vengeance of the law if I did not. Brande, notwithstanding his\r\nconstant scepticism, was scrupulously truthful. His statement of fact\r\nmust be relied upon. His opinions were another matter. As nothing\r\npractical resulted from my reflections, I came to the conclusion that I\r\nhad got into a pretty mess for the sake of a handsome face. I regretted\r\nthis result, but was glad of the cause of it. On this I went to bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning I was early astir, for I must see Natalie Brande without\r\ndelay, and I felt sure she would be no sluggard on that splendid summer\r\nday. I tried the lawn between the house and the lake shore. I did not\r\nfind her there. I found her friend Miss Metford. The girl was sauntering\r\nabout, swinging a walking-cane carelessly. She was still rationally\r\ndressed, but I observed with relief that the rational part of her\r\ncostume was more in the nature of the divided skirt than the plain\r\nknickerbockers of the previous day. She accosted me cheerfully by my\r\nsurname, and not to be outdone by her, I said coolly:\r\n\r\n\"How d'ye do, Metford?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, thanks. I suppose you expected Natalie? You see you have\r\nonly me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delighted,\" I was commencing with a forced smile, when she stopped me.\r\n\r\n\"You look it. But that can't be helped. Natalie saw you going out, and\r\nsent me to meet you. I am to look after you for an hour or so. You join\r\nthe Society this evening, I hear. You must be very pleased--and\r\nflattered.\"\r\n\r\nI could not assent to this, and so remained silent. The girl chattered\r\non in her own outspoken manner, which, now that I was growing accustomed\r\nto it, I did not find as unpleasant as at first. One thing was evident\r\nto me. She had no idea of the villainous nature of Brande's Society. She\r\ncould not have spoken so carelessly if she shared my knowledge of it.\r\nWhile she talked to me, I wondered if it was fair to her--a likeable\r\ngirl, in spite of her undesirable affectations of advanced opinion,\r\nemancipation or whatever she called it--was it fair to allow her to\r\nassociate with a band of murderers, and not so much as whisper a word of\r\nwarning? No doubt, I myself was associating with the band; but I was not\r\nin ignorance of the responsibility thereby incurred.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Metford,\" I said, without heeding whether I interrupted her, \"are\r\nyou in the secret of this Society?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? Not at present. I shall be later on.\"\r\n\r\nI stopped and faced her with so serious an expression that she listened\r\nto me attentively.\r\n\r\n\"If you will take my earnest advice--and I beg you not to neglect\r\nit--you will have nothing to do with it or any one belonging to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even Brande--I mean Natalie? Is she dangerous?\"\r\n\r\nI disregarded her mischief and continued: \"If you can get Miss Brande\r\naway from her brother and his acquaintances,\" (I had nearly said\r\naccomplices,) \"and keep her away, you would be doing the best and\r\nkindest thing you ever did in your life.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Metford was evidently impressed by my seriousness, but, as she\r\nherself said very truly, it was unlikely that she would be able to\r\ninterfere in the way I suggested. Besides, my mysterious warning was\r\naltogether too vague to be of any use as a guide for her own action,\r\nmuch less that of her friend. I dared not speak plainer. I could only\r\nrepeat, in the most emphatic words, my anxiety that she would think\r\ncarefully over what I had said. I then pretended to recollect an\r\nengagement with Brande, for I was in such low spirits I had really\r\nlittle taste for any company.\r\n\r\nShe was disappointed, and said so in her usual straightforward way. It\r\nwas not in the power of any gloomy prophecy to oppress her long. The\r\nserious look which my words had brought on her face passed quickly, and\r\nit was in her natural manner that she bade me good-morning, saying:\r\n\r\n\"It is rather a bore, for I looked forward to a pleasant hour or two\r\ntaking you about.\"\r\n\r\nI postponed my breakfast for want of appetite, and, as Brande's house\r\nwas the best example of Liberty Hall I had ever met with, I offered no\r\napology for my absence during the entire day when I rejoined my host and\r\nhostess in the evening. The interval I spent in the woods, thinking\r\nmuch and deciding nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Brande introduced me to a man whom he called Edward Grey.\r\nNatalie conducted me to the room in which they were engaged. From the\r\nmass of correspondence in which this man Grey was absorbed, and the\r\nlitter of papers about him, it was evident that he must have been in the\r\nhouse long before I made his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nGrey handed me a book, which I found to be a register of the names of\r\nthe members of Brande's Society, and pointed out the place for my\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nWhen I had written my name on the list I said to Brande: \"Now that I\r\nhave nominated myself, I suppose you'll second me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary,\" he answered; \"you are already a member. Your\r\nremark to Miss Metford this morning made you one of us. You advised her,\r\nyou recollect, to beware of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That girl!\" I exclaimed, horrified. \"Then she is one of your spies? Is\r\nit possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she is not one of our spies. We have none, and she knew nothing of\r\nthe purpose for which she was used.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I beg to say that you have made a d--d shameful use of her.\"\r\n\r\nIn the passion of the moment I forgot my manners to my host, and formed\r\nthe resolution to denounce the Society to the police the moment I\r\nreturned to London. Brande was not offended by my violence. There was\r\nnot a trace of anger in his voice as he said:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Metford's information was telepathically conveyed to my sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was your sister--\"\r\n\r\n\"My sister knows as little as the other. In turn, I received the\r\ninformation telepathically from her, without the knowledge of either. I\r\nwas just telling Grey of it when you came into the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" said Grey, \"your intention to go straight from this house to\r\nScotland Yard, there to denounce us to the police, has been\r\ntelepathically received by myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" I cried, \"has a man no longer the right to his own thoughts?\"\r\n\r\nGrey went on without noticing my exclamation: \"Any overt or covert\r\naction on your part, toward carrying out your intention, will be\r\ntelepathically conveyed to us, and our executive--\" He shrugged his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I said, \"Woking Cemetery, near Saint Anne's Chapel. You have\r\nground there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have to dispense with--\"\r\n\r\n\"Say murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dispense with,\" Grey repeated sharply, \"any member whose loyalty is\r\nquestionable. This is not our wish; it is our necessity. It is the only\r\nmeans by which we can secure the absolute immunity of the Society\r\npending the achievement of its object. To dispense with any living man\r\nwe have only to will that he shall die.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now that I am a member, may I ask what is this object, the secret\r\nof which you guard with such fiendish zeal?\" I demanded angrily.\r\n\r\n\"The restoration of a local etheric tumour to its original formation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am already weary of this jargon from Brande,\" I interrupted. \"What do\r\nyou mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"We mean to attempt the reduction of the solar system to its elemental\r\nether.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will accomplish this triviality by means of Huxley's comet, I\r\nsuppose?\"\r\n\r\nI could scarcely control my indignation. This fooling, as I thought it,\r\nstruck me as insulting. Neither Brande nor Grey appeared to notice my\r\nkeen resentment. Grey answered me in a quiet, serious tone.\r\n\r\n\"We shall attempt it by destroying the earth. We may fail in the\r\ncomplete achievement of our design, but in any case we shall at least be\r\ncertain of reducing this planet to the ether of which it is composed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" I agreed derisively. \"You will at least make\r\nsure of that. You have found out how to do it too, I have no doubt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Grey, \"we have found out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nA TELEPATHIC TELEGRAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI left the room and hurried outside without any positive plan for my\r\nmovements. My brain was in such a whirl I could form no connected train\r\nof thought. These men, whose conversation was a jargon fitting only for\r\nlunatics, had proved that they could read my mind with the ease of a\r\ntelegraph operator taking a message off a wire. That they, further,\r\npossessed marvellous, if not miraculous powers, over occult natural\r\nforces could hardly be doubted. The net in which I had voluntarily\r\nentangled myself was closing around me. An irresistible impulse to\r\nfly--to desert Natalie and save myself--came over me. I put this aside\r\npresently. It was both unworthy and unwise. For whither should I fly?\r\nThe ends of the earth would not be far enough to save me, the depths of\r\nthe sea would not be deep enough to hide me from those who killed by\r\nwilling that their victim should die.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if my senses had only been hocussed, and Messrs.\r\nBrande and Grey were nothing better than clever tricksters, the park\r\ngate was far enough, and the nearest policeman force enough, to save me\r\nfrom their vengeance. But the girl--Natalie! She was clairvoyante. They\r\npractised upon her. My diagnosis of the strange seeing-without-sight\r\nexpression of her eyes was then correct. And it was clear to me that\r\nwhatsoever or whomsoever Brande and Grey believed or disbelieved in,\r\nthey certainly believed in themselves. They might be relied on to spare\r\nnothing and no one in their project, however ridiculous or mad their\r\npurpose might be. What then availed my paltry protection when the girl\r\nherself was a willing victim, and the men omnipotent? Nevertheless, if I\r\nfailed eventually to serve her, I could at least do my best.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that I must stand by Natalie Brande.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus reflecting, the following conversation took place\r\nbetween Brande and Grey. I found a note of it in a diary which Brande\r\nkept desultorily. He wrote this up so irregularly no continuous\r\ninformation can be gleaned from it as to his life. How the diary came\r\ninto my hands will be seen later. The memorandum is written thus:--\r\n\r\n_Grey_--Our new member? Why did you introduce him? You say he cannot\r\nhelp with money. It is plain he cannot help with brains.\r\n\r\n_Brande_--He interests Natalie. He is what the uneducated call\r\ngood-natured. He enjoys doing unselfish things, unaware that it is for\r\nthe selfish sake of the agreeable sensation thereby secured. Besides, I\r\nlike him myself. He amuses me. To make him a member was the only safe\r\nway of keeping him so much about us. But Natalie is the main reason. I\r\nam afraid of her wavering in spite of my hypnotic influence. In a girl\r\nof her intensely emotional nature the sentiment of hopeless love will\r\ncreate profound melancholy. Dominated by that she is safe. It seems\r\ncruel at first sight. It is not really so. It is not cruel to reconcile\r\nher to a fate she cannot escape. It is merciful. For the rest, what does\r\nit matter? It will be all the same in--\r\n\r\n_Grey_--This day six months.\r\n\r\n_Brande_--I believe I shivered. Heredity has much to answer for.\r\n\r\nThat is the whole of the entry. I did not read the words until the hand\r\nthat wrote them was dust.\r\n\r\nNatalie professed some disappointment when I announced my immediate\r\nreturn to town. I was obliged to manufacture an excuse for such a hasty\r\ndeparture, and so fell back on an old engagement which I had truly\r\noverlooked, and which really called me away. But it would have called\r\nlong enough without an answer if it had not been for Brande himself, his\r\nfriend Grey, and their insanities. My mind was fixed on one salient\r\nissue: how to get Natalie Brande out of her brother's evil influence.\r\nThis would be better compassed when I myself was outside the scope of\r\nhis extraordinary influence. And so I went without delay.\r\n\r\nFor some time after my return to London, I went about visiting old\r\nhaunts and friends. I soon tired of this. The haunts had lost their\r\ninterest. The friends were changed, or I was changed. I could not resume\r\nthe friendships which had been interrupted. The chain of connection had\r\nbeen broken and the links would not weld easily. So, after some futile\r\nefforts to return to the circle I had long deserted, I desisted and\r\naccepted my exclusion with serenity. I am not sure that I desired the\r\nold relationships re-established. And as my long absence had prevented\r\nany fresh shoots of friendship being grafted, I found myself alone in\r\nLondon. I need say no more.\r\n\r\nOne evening I was walking through the streets in a despondent mood, as\r\nhad become my habit. By chance I read the name of a street into which I\r\nhad turned to avoid a more crowded thoroughfare. It was that in which\r\nMiss Metford lived. I knew that she had returned to town, for she had\r\nbriefly acquainted me with the fact on a postcard written some days\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nHere was a chance of distraction. This girl's spontaneous gaiety, which\r\nI found at first displeasing, was what I wanted to help me to shake off\r\nthe gloomy incubus of thought oppressing me. It was hardly within the\r\nproprieties to call upon her at such an hour, but it could not matter\r\nvery much, when the girl's own ideas were so unconventional. She had\r\nindependent means, and lived apart from her family in order to be rid of\r\ndomestic limitations. She had told me that she carried a\r\nlatch-key--indeed she had shown it to me with a flourish of triumph--and\r\nthat she delighted in free manners. Free manners, she was careful to\r\nadd, did not mean bad manners. To my mind the terms were synonymous.\r\nWhen opposite her number I decided to call, and, having knocked at the\r\ndoor, was told that Miss Metford was at home.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, Marcel! Glad to see you,\" she called out, somewhat stridently\r\nfor my taste. Her dress was rather mannish, as usual. In lieu of her\r\nout-door tunic she wore a smoking-jacket. When I entered she was sitting\r\nin an arm-chair, with her feet on a music-stool. She arose so hastily\r\nthat the music-stool was overturned, and allowed to lie where it fell.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" she asked, concerned. \"Have you seen a ghost?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I have seen many ghosts of late,\" I said, \"and they have not\r\nbeen good company. I was passing your door, and I have come in for\r\ncomfort.\"\r\n\r\nShe crossed the room and poured out some whisky from a decanter which\r\nwas standing on a side-board. Then she opened a bottle of soda-water\r\nwith a facility which suggested practice. I was relieved to think that\r\nit was not Natalie who was my hostess. Handing me the glass, she said\r\nperemptorily:\r\n\r\n\"Drink that. That is right. Give me the glass. Now smoke. Do I allow\r\nsmoking here? Pah! I smoke here myself.\"\r\n\r\nI lit a cigar and sat down beside her. The clouds began to lift from my\r\nbrain and float off in the blue smoke wreaths. We talked on ordinary\r\ntopics without my once noticing how deftly they had been introduced by\r\nMiss Metford. I never thought of the flight of time until a chime from a\r\ntiny clock on the mantelpiece--an exquisite sample of the tasteful\r\nfurniture of the whole room--warned me that my visit had lasted two\r\nhours. I arose reluctantly.\r\n\r\nShe rallied me on my ingratitude. I had come in a sorry plight. I was\r\nnow restored. She was no longer useful, therefore I left her. And so on,\r\ntill I said with a solemnity no doubt lugubrious:\r\n\r\n\"I am most grateful, Miss Metford. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.\r\nYou would not understand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please leave my poor understanding alone, and tell me what has\r\nhappened to you. I should like to hear it. And what is more, I like\r\nyou.\" She said this so carelessly, I did not feel embarrassed. \"Now,\r\nthen, the whole story, please.\" Saying which, she sat down again.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really know nothing more of Brande's Society than you admitted\r\nwhen I last spoke to you about it?\" I asked, without taking the chair\r\nshe pushed over to me.\r\n\r\n\"This is all I know,\" she answered, in the rhyming voice of a young\r\npupil declaiming a piece of a little understood and less cared for\r\nrecitation. \"The society has very interesting evenings. Brande shows one\r\nbeautiful experiments, which, I daresay, would be amazingly instructive\r\nif one were inclined that way, which I am not. The men are mostly\r\nlong-haired creatures with spectacles. Some of them are rather\r\ngood-looking. All are wholly mad. And my friend--I mean the only girl I\r\ncould ever stand as a friend--Natalie Brande, is crazy about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more than that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nThe clock now struck the hour of nine, the warning chime for which had\r\nstartled me.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything more than that?\" Miss Metford asked with some\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nI thought for a moment. Unless my own senses had deceived me that\r\nevening in Brande's house, I ran a great risk of sharing George Delany's\r\nfate if I remained where I was much longer. And suppose I told her all\r\nI knew, would not that bring the same danger upon her too? So I had to\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you. I am a member now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must know more than any mere outsider like myself. I suppose\r\nit would not be fair to ask you. Anyhow, you will come back and see me\r\nsoon. By the way, what is your address?\"\r\n\r\nI gave her my address. She wrote it down on a silver-cased tablet, and\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\"That will be all right. I'll look you up some evening.\"\r\n\r\nAs I drove to my hotel, I felt that the mesmeric trick, or whatever\r\nartifice had been practised upon me by Brande and Grey, had now assumed\r\nits true proportion. I laughed at my fears, and was thankful that I had\r\nnot described them to the strong-minded young woman to whose kindly\r\nsociety I owed so much. What an idiot she would have thought me!\r\n\r\nA servant met me in the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Telegram, sir. Just arrived at this moment.\"\r\n\r\nI took the telegram, and went upstairs with it unopened in my hand. A\r\nstrange fear overcame me. I dared not open the envelope. I knew\r\nbeforehand who the sender was, and what the drift of the message would\r\nbe. I was right. It was from Brande.\r\n\r\n    \"I beg you to be more cautious. Your discussion with Miss M. this\r\n    evening might have been disastrous. I thought all was over at nine\r\n    o'clock.\r\n\r\n                                                             \"BRANDE.\"\r\n\r\nI sat down stupefied. When my senses returned, I looked at the table\r\nwhere I had thrown the telegram. It was not there, nor in the room. I\r\nrang for the man who had given it to me, and he came immediately.\r\n\r\n\"About that telegram you gave me just now, Phillips--\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" the man interrupted, \"I did not give you any\r\ntelegram this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean when you spoke to me in the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I said 'good-night,' but you took no notice. Excuse me, sir,\r\nI thought you looked strange.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I was thinking of something else. And I remember now, it was\r\nJohnson who gave me the telegram.\"\r\n\r\n\"Johnson left yesterday, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was yesterday I was thinking of. You may go, Phillips.\"\r\n\r\nSo Brande's telepathic power was objective as well as subjective. My own\r\nbrain, unaccustomed to be impressed by another mind \"otherwise than\r\nthrough the recognised channels of sense,\" had supplied the likeliest\r\nauthority for its message. The message was duly delivered, but the\r\ntelegram was a delusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGUILTY!\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to protecting Natalie Brande from her brother and the fanatics with\r\nwhom he associated, it was now plain that I was powerless. And what\r\nguarantee had I that she herself was unaware of his nefarious purpose;\r\nthat she did not sympathise with it? This last thought flashed upon me\r\none day, and the sting of pain that followed it was so intolerable, I\r\ndetermined instantly to prove its falsity or truth.\r\n\r\nI telegraphed to Brande that I was running down to spend a day or two\r\nwith him, and followed my message without waiting for a reply. I have\r\nstill a very distinct recollection of that journey, notwithstanding much\r\nthat might well have blotted it from my memory. Every mile sped over\r\nseemed to mark one more barrier passed on my way to some strange fate;\r\nevery moment which brought me nearer this incomprehensible girl with\r\nher magical eyes was an epoch of impossibility against my ever\r\nvoluntarily turning back. And now that it is all over, I am glad that I\r\nwent on steadfastly to the end.\r\n\r\nBrande received me with the easy affability of a man to whom good\r\nbreeding had ceased to be a habit, and had become an instinct. Only once\r\ndid anything pass between us bearing on the extraordinary relationship\r\nwhich he had established with me--the relation of victor and victim, I\r\nconsidered it. We had been left together for a few moments, and I said\r\nas soon as the others were out of hearing distance:\r\n\r\n\"I got your message.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you did,\" he replied. That was all. There was an awkward pause.\r\nIt must be broken somehow. Any way out of the difficulty was better than\r\nto continue in it.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen this?\" I asked, handing Brande a copy of a novel which I\r\nhad picked up at a railway bookstall. When I say that it was new and\r\npopular, it will be understood that it was indecent.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the title, and said indifferently: \"Yes, I have seen it,\r\nand in order to appreciate this class of fiction fairly, I have even\r\ntried to read it. Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I thought it would be in your line. It is very advanced.\" I\r\nsaid this to gain time.\r\n\r\n\"Advanced--advanced? I am afraid I do not comprehend. What do you mean\r\nby 'advanced'? And how could it be in my line. I presume you mean by\r\nthat, on my plane of thought?\"\r\n\r\n\"By 'advanced,' I mean up-to-date. What do you mean by it?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I used the word at all, I should mean educated, evolved. Is this\r\nevolved? Is it even educated? It is not always grammatical. It has no\r\nstyle. In motive, it ante-dates Boccaccio.\"\r\n\r\n\"You disapprove of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you approve it, notwithstanding your immediate condemnation?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means. I neither approve nor disapprove. It only represents a\r\nphase of humanity--the deliberate purpose of securing money or notoriety\r\nto the individual, regardless of the welfare of the community. There is\r\nnothing to admire in that. It would be invidious to blame it when the\r\nwhole social scheme is equally wrong and contemptible. By the way, what\r\ninterest do you think the wares of any literary pander, of either sex,\r\ncould possess for me, a student--even if a mistaken one--of science?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not think the book would possess the slightest interest for you,\r\nand I suppose you are already aware of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah no! My telepathic power is reserved for more serious purposes. Its\r\nexercise costs me too much to expend it on trifles. In consequence I do\r\nnot know why you mentioned the book.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I answered candidly, \"I mentioned it in order to get myself out\r\nof a conversational difficulty--without much success.\"\r\n\r\nNatalie was reserved with me at first. She devoted herself unnecessarily\r\nto a boy named Halley who was staying with them. Grey had gone to\r\nLondon. His place was taken by a Mr. Rockingham, whom I did not like.\r\nThere was something sinister in his expression, and he rarely spoke save\r\nto say something cynical, and in consequence disagreeable. He had \"seen\r\nlife,\" that is, everything deleterious to and destructive of it. His\r\nconnection with Brande was clearly a rebound, the rebound of disgust.\r\nThere was nothing creditable to him in that. My first impression of him\r\nwas thus unfavourable. My last recollection of him is a fitting item in\r\nthe nightmare which contains it.\r\n\r\nThe youth Halley would have interested me under ordinary circumstances.\r\nHis face was as handsome and refined as that of a pretty girl. His\r\nfigure, too, was slight and his voice effeminate. But there my own\r\nadvantage, as I deemed it, over him ceased. Intellectually, he was a\r\npupil of Brande's who did his master credit. Having made this discovery\r\nI did not pursue it. My mind was fixed too fast upon a definite issue to\r\nbe more than temporarily interested in the epigrams of a peachy-cheeked\r\nman of science.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was well advanced before I had an opportunity of speaking\r\nto Natalie. When it came, I did not stop to puzzle over a choice of\r\nphrases.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to speak to you alone on a subject of extreme importance to me,\"\r\nI said hurriedly. \"Will you come with me to the sea-shore? Your time, I\r\nknow, is fully occupied. I would not ask this if my happiness did not\r\ndepend upon it.\"\r\n\r\nThe philosopher looked on me with grave, kind eyes. But the woman's\r\nheart within her sent the red blood flaming to her cheeks. It was then\r\ngiven to me to fathom the lowest depth of boorish stupidity I had ever\r\nsounded.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean that,\" I cried, \"I would not dare--\"\r\n\r\nThe blush on her cheek burnt deeper as she tossed her head proudly back,\r\nand said straight out, without any show of fence or shadow of\r\nconcealment:\r\n\r\n\"It was my mistake. I am glad to know that I did you an injustice. You\r\nare my friend, are you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I have the right to claim that title,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Then what you ask is granted. Come.\" She put her hand boldly into mine.\r\nI grasped the slender fingers, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Natalie, some day I will prove to you that I am your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"The proof is unnecessary,\" she replied, in a low sad voice.\r\n\r\nWe started for the sea. Not a word was spoken on the way. Nor did our\r\neyes meet. We were in a strange position. It was this: the man who had\r\nvowed he was the woman's friend--who did not intend to shirk the proof\r\nof his promise, and never did gainsay it--meant to ask the woman,\r\nbefore the day was over, to clear herself of knowingly associating with\r\na gang of scientific murderers. The woman had vaguely divined his\r\npurpose, and could not clear herself.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the shore we occupied ourselves inconsequently. We\r\nhunted little fishes until Natalie's dainty boots were dripping. We\r\nexamined quaint denizens of the shallow water until her gloves were\r\nspoilt. We sprang from rock to rock and evaded the onrush of the foaming\r\nwaves. We made aqueducts for inter-communication between deep pools. We\r\nbasked in the sunshine, and listened to the deep moan of the sounding\r\nsea, and the solemn murmur of the shells. We drank in the deep breath of\r\nthe ocean, and for a brief space we were like happy children.\r\n\r\nThe end came soon to this ephemeral happiness. It was only one of those\r\nbright coins snatched from the niggard hand of Time which must always be\r\npaid back with usurious charges. We paid with cruel interest.\r\n\r\nStanding on a flat rock side by side, I nerved myself to ask this girl\r\nthe same question I had asked her friend, Edith Metford, how much she\r\nknew of the extraordinary and preposterous Society--as I still tried to\r\nconsider it--which Herbert Brande had founded. She looked so frank, so\r\nrefined, so kind, I hardly dared to put my brutal question to an\r\ninnocent girl, whom I had seen wince at the suffering of a maimed bird,\r\nand pale to the lips at the death-cry of a rabbit. This time there was\r\nno possibility of untoward consequence in the question save to\r\nmyself--for surely the girl was safe from her own brother. And I myself\r\npreferred to risk the consequences rather than endure longer the thought\r\nthat she belonged voluntarily to a vile murder club. Yet the question\r\nwould not come. A simple thing brought it out. Natalie, after looking\r\nseaward silently for some minutes, said simply:\r\n\r\n\"How long are we to stand here, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Until you answer this question. How much do you know about your\r\nbrother's Society, which I have joined to my own intense regret?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry you regret having joined,\" she replied gravely.\r\n\r\n\"You would not be sorry,\" said I, \"if you knew as much about it as I\r\ndo,\" forgetting that I had still no answer to my question, and that the\r\nextent of her knowledge was unknown to me.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I do know as much as you.\" There was a tremor in her voice\r\nand an anxious pleading look in her eyes. This look maddened me. Why\r\nshould she plead to me unless she was guilty? I stamped my foot upon the\r\nrock without noticing that in so doing I kicked our whole collection of\r\nshells into the water.\r\n\r\nThere was something more to ask, but I stood silent and sullen. The\r\nwoods above the beach were choral with bird-voices. They were hateful to\r\nme. The sea song of the tumbling waves was hideous. I cursed the yellow\r\nsunset light glaring on their snowy crests. A tiny hand was laid upon my\r\narm. I writhed under its deadly if delicious touch. But I could not put\r\nit away, nor keep from turning to the sweet face beside me, to mark once\r\nmore its mute appeal--now more than mere appeal; it was supplication\r\nthat was in her eyes. Her red lips were parted as though they voiced an\r\nunspoken prayer. At last a prayer did pass from them to me.\r\n\r\n\"Do not judge me until you know me better. Do not hate me without cause.\r\nI am not wicked, as you think. I--I--I am trying to do what I think is\r\nright. At least, I am not selfish or cruel. Trust me yet a little\r\nwhile.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at her one moment, and then with a sob I clasped her in my\r\narms, and cried aloud:\r\n\r\n\"My God! to name murder and that angel face in one breath! Child, you\r\nhave been befooled. You know nothing.\"\r\n\r\nFor a second she lingered in my embrace. Then she gently put away my\r\narms, and looking up at me, said fearlessly but sorrowfully:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot lie--even for your love. I know _all_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WOKING MYSTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe knew all. Then she was a murderess--or in sympathy with murderers.\r\nMy arms fell from her. I drew back shuddering. I dared not look in her\r\nlying eyes, which cried pity when her base heart knew no mercy. Surely\r\nnow I had solved the maddening puzzle which the character of this girl\r\nhad, so far, presented to me. Yet the true solution was as far from me\r\nas ever. Indeed, I could not well have been further from it than at that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAs we walked back, Natalie made two or three unsuccessful attempts to\r\nlure me out of the silence which was certainly more eloquent on my part\r\nthan any words I could have used. Once she commenced:\r\n\r\n\"It is hard to explain--\"\r\n\r\nI interrupted her harshly. \"No explanation is possible.\"\r\n\r\nOn that she put her handkerchief to her eyes, and a half-suppressed sob\r\nshook her slight figure. Her grief distracted me. But what could I say\r\nto assuage it?\r\n\r\nAt the hall door I stopped and said, \"Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not coming in?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a directness and emphasis in the question which did not escape\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"I?\" The horror in my own voice surprised myself, and assuredly did not\r\npass without her notice.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; good-bye. We are not exactly slaves of convention here, but\r\nyou are too far advanced in that direction even for me. This is your\r\nsecond startling departure from us. I trust you will spare me the\r\nhumiliation entailed by the condescension of your further acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me an hour!\" I exclaimed aghast. \"You do not make allowance for\r\nthe enigma in which everything is wrapped up. I said I was your friend\r\nwhen I thought you of good report. Give me an hour--only an hour--to say\r\nwhether I will stand by my promise, now that you yourself have claimed\r\nthat your report is not good but evil. For that is really what you have\r\nprotested. Do I ask too much? or is your generosity more limited even\r\nthan my own?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no! I would not have you think that. Take an hour, or a year--an\r\nhour only if you care for my happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" said I. \"I will take the hour. Discretion can have the year.\"\r\n\r\nSo I left her. I could not go indoors. A roof would smother me. Give me\r\nthe open lawns, the leafy woods, the breath of the summer wind. Away,\r\nthen, to the silence of the coming night. For an hour leave me to my\r\nthoughts. Her unworthiness was now more than suspected. It was admitted.\r\nMy misery was complete. But I would not part with her; I could not.\r\nInnocent or guilty, she was mine. I must suffer with her or for her. The\r\nresolution by which I have abided was formed as I wandered lonely\r\nthrough the woods.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached my room that night I found a note from Brande. To receive\r\na letter from a man in whose house I was a guest did not surprise me. I\r\nwas past that stage. There was nothing mysterious in the letter, save\r\nits conclusion. It was simply an invitation to a public meeting of the\r\nSociety, which was to be held on that day week in the hall in Hanover\r\nSquare, and the special feature in the letter--seeing that it did not\r\nvanish like the telegram, but remained an ordinary sheet of paper--lay\r\nin its concluding sentence. This urged me to allow nothing to prevent my\r\nattendance. \"You will perhaps understand thereafter that we are neither\r\npolitical plotters nor lunatics, as you have thought.\"\r\n\r\nThought! The man's mysterious power was becoming wearisome. It was too\r\nmuch for me. I wished that I had never seen his face.\r\n\r\nAs I lay sleepless in my bed, I recommenced that interminable\r\nintrospection which, heretofore, had been so barren of result. It was\r\neasy to swear to myself that I would stand by Natalie Brande, that I\r\nwould never desert her. But how should my action be directed in order\r\nthat by its conduct I might prevail upon the girl herself to surrender\r\nher evil associates? I knew that she regarded me with affection. And I\r\nknew also that she would not leave her brother for my sake. Did she\r\nsympathise with his nefarious schemes, or was she decoyed into them like\r\nmyself?\r\n\r\nDecoyed! That was it!\r\n\r\nI sprang from the bed, beside myself with delight. Now I had not merely\r\na loophole of escape from all these miseries; I had a royal highway.\r\nFool, idiot, blind mole that I was, not to perceive sooner that easy\r\nsolution of the problem! No wonder that she was wounded by my unworthy\r\ndoubts. And she had tried to explain, but I would not listen! I threw\r\nmyself back and commenced to weave all manner of pleasant fancies round\r\nthe salvation of this girl from her brother's baneful influence, and the\r\nannihilation of his Society, despite its occult powers, by mine own\r\nvalour. The reaction was too great. Instead of constructing marvellous\r\ncounterplots, I fell sound asleep.\r\n\r\nNext day I found Natalie in a pleasant morning-room to which I was\r\ndirected. She wore her most extreme--and, in consequence, most\r\nexasperating--rational costume. When I entered the room she pushed a\r\nchair towards me, in a way that suggested Miss Metford's worst manner,\r\nand lit a cigarette, for the express purpose, I felt, of annoying me.\r\n\r\n\"I have come,\" I said somewhat shamefacedly, \"to explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And apologise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to apologise. I made a hideous mistake. I have suffered for it as\r\nmuch as you could wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish you to suffer!\" She flung away her cigarette. Her dark eyes opened\r\nwide in unassumed surprise. And that curious light of pity, which I had\r\nso often wondered at, came into them. \"I am very sorry if you have\r\nsuffered,\" she said, with convincing earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"How could I doubt you? Senseless fool that I was to suppose for one\r\nmoment that you approved of what you could not choose but know--\"\r\n\r\nAt this her face clouded.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you are still in error. What opinion have you formed which\r\nalters your estimate of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only opinion possible: that you have unwillingly learned the secret\r\nof your brother's Society; but, like myself--you see no way to--to--\"\r\n\r\n\"To what purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"To destroy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not likely to attempt that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it would be impossible, and the effort would cost your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not my reason.\" She arose and stood facing me. \"I do not like\r\nto lose your esteem. You know already that I will not lie to retain it.\r\nI approve of the Society's purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And its actions?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are inevitable. Therefore I approve also of its actions. I shall\r\nnot ask you to remain now, for I see that you are again horrified; as is\r\nnatural, considering your knowledge--or, pardon me for saying so, your\r\nwant of knowledge. I shall be glad to see you after the lecture to which\r\nyou are invited. You will know a little more then; not all, perhaps, but\r\nenough to shake your time-dishonoured theories of life--and death.\"\r\n\r\nI bowed, and left the room without a word. It was true, then, that she\r\nwas mad like the others, or worse than mad--a thousand times worse! I\r\nsaid farewell to Brande, as his guest, for the last time. Thenceforward\r\nI would meet him as his enemy--his secret enemy as far as I could\r\npreserve my secrecy with such a man; his open enemy when the proper time\r\nshould come.\r\n\r\nIn the railway carriage I turned over some letters and papers which I\r\nfound in my pockets, not with deliberate intention, but to while away\r\nthe time. One scrap startled me. It was the sheet on which Brande had\r\nwritten the Woking address, and on reading it over once more, a thought\r\noccurred to me which I acted on as soon as possible. I could go to\r\nWoking and find out something about the man Delany. So long as my\r\ninquiries were kept within the limits of the strictest discretion,\r\nneither Brande nor any of his executive could blame me for seeking\r\nconvincing evidence of the secret power they claimed.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival in London, I drove immediately to the London Necropolis\r\nCompany's station and caught the funeral train which runs to Brookwood\r\ncemetery. With Saint Anne's Chapel as my base, I made short excursions\r\nhither and thither, and stood before a tombstone erected to the memory\r\nof George Delany, late of the Criminal Investigation Department,\r\nScotland Yard. This was a clue which I could follow, so I hurried back\r\nto town and called on the superintendent of the department.\r\n\r\nYes, I was told, Delany had belonged to the department. He had been a\r\nvery successful officer in ferreting out foreign Anarchists and\r\nevil-doers. His last movement was to join a Society of harmless cranks\r\nwho met in Hanover Square. No importance was attached to this in the\r\ndepartment. It could not have been done in the way of business, although\r\nDelany pretended that it was. He had dropped dead in the street as he\r\nwas leaving his cab to enter the office with information which must have\r\nappeared to him important--to judge from the cabman's evidence as to his\r\nintense excitement and repeated directions for faster driving. There was\r\nan inquest and a post-mortem, but \"death from natural causes\" was the\r\nverdict. That was all. It was enough for me.\r\n\r\nI had now sufficient evidence, and was finally convinced that the\r\nSociety was as dangerous as it was demented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCUI BONO?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the Society's rooms on the evening for which I had an\r\ninvitation, I found them pleasantly lighted. The various scientific\r\ndiagrams and instruments had been removed, and comfortable arm-chairs\r\nwere arranged so that a free passage was available, not merely to each\r\nrow, but to each chair. The place was full when I entered, and soon\r\nafterwards the door was closed and locked. Natalie Brande and Edith\r\nMetford were seated beside each other. An empty chair was on Miss\r\nMetford's right. She saw me standing at the door and nodded toward the\r\nempty seat which she had reserved for me. When I reached it she made a\r\nmovement as if to forestall me and leave me the middle chair. I\r\ndeprecated this by a look which was intentionally so severe that she\r\ndescribed it later as a malignant scowl.\r\n\r\nI could not at the moment seat myself voluntarily beside Natalie Brande\r\nwith the exact and final knowledge which I had learnt at Scotland Yard\r\nonly one week old. I could not do it just then, although I did not mean\r\nto draw back from what I had undertaken--to stand by her, innocent or\r\nguilty. But I must have time to become accustomed to the sensation which\r\nfollowed this knowledge. Miss Metford's fugitive attempts at\r\nconversation pending the commencement of the lecture were disagreeable\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nThere was a little stir on the platform. The chairman, in a few words,\r\nannounced Herbert Brande. \"This is the first public lecture,\" he said,\r\n\"which has been given since the formation of the Society, and in\r\nconsequence of the fact that a number of people not scientifically\r\neducated are present, the lecturer will avoid the more esoteric phases\r\nof his subject, which would otherwise present themselves in his\r\ntreatment of it, and confine himself to the commonplaces of scientific\r\ninsight. The title of the lecture is identical with that of our\r\nSociety--_Cui Bono?_\"\r\n\r\nBrande came forward unostentatiously and placed a roll of paper on the\r\nreading-desk. I have copied the extracts which follow from this\r\nmanuscript. The whole essay, indeed, remains with me intact, but it is\r\ntoo long--and it would be immaterial--to reproduce it all in this\r\nnarrative. I cannot hope either to reproduce the weird impressiveness of\r\nthe lecturer's personality, his hold over his audience, or my own\r\nemotions in listening to this man--whom I had proved, not only from his\r\nown confession, but by the strongest collateral evidence, to be a\r\ncallous and relentless murderer--to hear him glide with sonorous voice\r\nand graceful gesture from point to point in his logical and terrible\r\nindictment of suffering!--the futility of it, both in itself and that by\r\nwhich it was administered! No one could know Brande without finding\r\ninterest, if not pleasure, in his many chance expressions full of\r\ncurious and mysterious thought. I had often listened to his\r\nextemporaneous brain pictures, as the reader knows, but I had never\r\nbefore heard him deliberately formulate a planned-out system of thought.\r\nAnd such a system! This is the gospel according to Brande.\r\n\r\n\"In the verbiage of primitive optimism a misleading limitation is placed\r\non the significance of the word Nature and its inflections. And the\r\nmisconception of the meaning of an important word is as certain to lead\r\nto an inaccurate concept as is the misstatement of a premise to precede\r\na false conclusion. For instance, in the aphorism, variously rendered,\r\n'what is natural is right,' there is an excellent illustration of the\r\nmisapplication of the word 'natural.' If the saying means that what is\r\nnatural is just and wise, it might as well run 'what is natural is\r\nwrong,' injustice and unwisdom being as natural, _i.e._, a part of\r\nNature, as justice and wisdom. Morbidity and immorality are as natural\r\nas health and purity. Not more so, but not less so. That 'Nature is made\r\nbetter by no mean but Nature makes that mean,' is true enough. It is\r\ninevitably true. The question remains, in making that mean, has she\r\nreally made anything that tends toward the final achievement of\r\nuniversal happiness? I say she has not.\r\n\r\n\"The misuse of a word, it may be argued, could not prove a serious\r\nobstacle to the growth of knowledge, and might be even interesting to\r\nthe student of etymology. But behind the misuse of the word 'natural'\r\nthere is a serious confusion of thought which must be clarified before\r\nthe mass of human intelligence can arrive at a just appreciation of the\r\nverities which surround human existence, and explain it. To this end it\r\nis necessary to get rid of the archaic idea of Nature as a paternal,\r\nprovidential, and beneficent protector, a successor to the 'special\r\nprovidence,' and to know the true Nature, bond-slave as she is of her\r\nown eternal persistence of force; that sole primary principle of which\r\nall other principles are only correlatives; of which the existence of\r\nmatter is but a cognisable evidence.\r\n\r\n\"The optimist notion, therefore, that Nature is an all-wise designer, in\r\nwhose work order, system, wisdom, and beauty are prominent, does not\r\nfare well when placed under the microscope of scientific research.\r\n\r\n\"Order?\r\n\r\n\"There is no order in Nature. Her armies are but seething mobs of\r\nrioters, destroying everything they can lay hands on.\r\n\r\n\"System?\r\n\r\n\"She has no system, unless it be a _reductio ad absurdum_, which only\r\nblunders on the right way after fruitlessly trying every other\r\nconceivable path. She is not wise. She never fills a pail but she spills\r\na hogshead. All her works are not beautiful. She never makes a\r\nmasterpiece but she smashes a million 'wasters' without a care. The\r\ntheory of evolution--her gospel--reeks with ruffianism, nature-patented\r\nand promoted. The whole scheme of the universe, all material existence\r\nas it is popularly known, is founded upon and begotten of a system of\r\neverlasting suffering as hideous as the fantastic nightmares of\r\nreligious maniacs. The Spanish Inquisitors have been regarded as the\r\nmost unnatural monsters who ever disgraced the history of mankind. Yet\r\nthe atrocities of the Inquisitors, like the battlefields of Napoleon and\r\nother heroes, were not only natural, but they have their prototypes in\r\nevery cubic inch of stagnant water, or ounce of diseased tissue. And\r\nstagnant water is as natural as sterilised water; and diseased tissue is\r\nas natural as healthy tissue. Wholesale murder is Nature's first law.\r\nShe creates only to kill, and applies the rule as remorselessly to the\r\nunits in a star-drift as to the tadpoles in a horse-pond.\r\n\r\n\"It seems a far cry from a star-drift to a horse-pond. It is so in\r\ndistance and magnitude. It is not in the matter of constituents. In\r\nultimate composition they are identical. The great nebula in Andromeda\r\nis an aggregation of atoms, and so is the river Thames. The only\r\ndifference between them is the difference in the arrangement and\r\nincidence of these atoms and in the molecular motion of which they are\r\nthe first but not the final cause. In a pint of Thames water, we know\r\nthat there is bound up a latent force beside which steam and\r\nelectricity are powerless in comparison. To release that force it is\r\nonly necessary to apply the sympathetic key; just as the heated point of\r\na needle will explode a mine of gunpowder and lay a city in ashes. That\r\nforce is asleep. The atoms which could give it reality are at rest, or,\r\nat least, in a condition of _quasi_-rest. But in the stupendous mass of\r\nincandescent gas which constitutes the nebula of Andromeda, every atom\r\nis madly seeking rest and finding none; whirling in raging haste,\r\nbattling with every other atom in its field of motion, impinging upon\r\nothers and influencing them, being impinged upon and influenced by them.\r\nThat awful cauldron exemplifies admirably the method of progress\r\nstimulated by suffering. It is the embryo of a new Sun and his planets.\r\nAfter many million years of molecular agony, when his season of fission\r\nhad come, he will rend huge fragments from his mass and hurl them\r\nhelpless into space, there to grow into his satellites. In their turn\r\nthey may reproduce themselves in like manner before their true planetary\r\nlife begins, in which they shall revolve around their parent as solid\r\nspheres. Follow them further and learn how beneficent Nature deals with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"After the lapse of time-periods which man may calculate in figures, but\r\nof which his finite mind cannot form even a true symbolic conception,\r\nthe outer skin of the planet cools--rests. Internal troubles prevail for\r\nlonger periods still; and these, in their unsupportable agony, bend and\r\nburst the solid strata overlying; vomit fire through their self-made\r\nblow-holes, rear mountains from the depths of the sea, then dash them in\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n\"Time strides on austere.\r\n\r\n\"The globe still cools. Life appears upon it. Then begins anew the old\r\nstrife, but under conditions far more dreadful, for though it be founded\r\non atomic consciousness, the central consciousness of the heterogeneous\r\naggregation of atoms becomes immeasurably more sentient and susceptible\r\nwith every step it takes from homogenesis. This internecine war must\r\ncontinue while any creature great or small shall remain alive upon the\r\nworld that bore it.\r\n\r\n\"By slow degrees the mighty milestones in the protoplasmic march are\r\npassed. Plants and animals are now busy, murdering and devouring each\r\nother--the strong everywhere destroying the weak. New types appear. Old\r\ntypes disappear. Types possessing the greatest capacity for murder\r\nprogress most rapidly, and those with the least recede and determine.\r\nThe neolithic man succeeds the palæolithic man, and sharpens the stone\r\naxe. Then to increase their power for destruction, men find it better to\r\nhunt in packs. Communities appear. Soon each community discovers that\r\nits own advantage is furthered by confining its killing, in the main, to\r\nthe members of neighbouring communities. Nations early make the same\r\ndiscovery. And at last, as with ourselves, there is established a race\r\nwith conscience enough to know that it is vile, and intelligence enough\r\nto know that it is insignificant.[1] But what profits this? In the\r\nfulness of its time the race shall die. Man will go down into the pit,\r\nand all his thoughts will perish. The uneasy consciousness which, in\r\nthis obscure corner, has for a brief space broken the silence of the\r\nUniverse, will be at rest. Matter will know itself no longer. Life and\r\ndeath and love, stronger than death, will be as though they never had\r\nbeen. Nor will anything that _is_ be better or be worse for all that\r\nthe labour, genius, devotion, and suffering of man have striven through\r\ncountless generations to effect.\r\n\r\n    [1] From this sentence to the end of the paragraph Brande draws\r\n    freely, for the purpose of his own argument, on Mr. Balfour's\r\n    \"Naturalism and Ethics.\"--_Ed._\r\n\r\n\"The roaring loom of Time weaves on. The globe cools out. Life\r\nmercifully ceases from upon its surface. The atmosphere and water\r\ndisappear. It rests. It is dead.\r\n\r\n\"But for its vicarious service in influencing more youthful planets\r\nwithin its reach, that dead world might as well be loosed at once from\r\nits gravitation cable and be turned adrift into space. Its time has not\r\nyet come. It will not come until the great central sun of the system to\r\nwhich it belongs has passed laboriously through all his stages of\r\nstellar life and died out also. Then when that dead sun, according to\r\nthe impact theory, blunders across the path of another sun, dead and\r\nblind like himself, its time will come. The result of that impact will\r\nbe a new star nebula, with all its weary history before it; a history of\r\nsuffering, in which a million years will not be long enough to write a\r\nsingle page.\r\n\r\n\"Here we have a scientific parallel to the hell of superstition which\r\nmay account for the instinctive origin of the smoking flax and the fire\r\nwhich shall never be quenched. We know that the atoms of which the\r\nhuman body is built up are atoms of matter. It follows that every atom\r\nin every living body will be present in some form at that final impact\r\nin which the solar system will be ended in a blazing whirlwind which\r\nwill melt the earth with its fervent heat. There is not a molecule or\r\ncell in any creature alive this day which will not in its ultimate\r\nconstituents endure the long agony, lasting countless æons of centuries,\r\nwherein the solid mass of this great globe will be represented by a rush\r\nof incandescent gas, stupendous in itself, but trivial in comparison\r\nwith the hurricane of flame in which it will be swallowed up and lost.\r\n\r\n\"And when from that hell a new star emerges, and new planets in their\r\nseason are born of him, and he and they repeat, as they must repeat, the\r\nceaseless, changeless, remorseless story of the universe, every atom in\r\nthis earth will take its place, and fill again functions identical with\r\nthose which it, or its fellow, fills now. Life will reappear, develop,\r\ndetermine, to be renewed again as before. And so on for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Nature has known no rest. From the beginning--which never was--she has\r\nbeen building up only to tear down again. She has been fabricating\r\npretty toys and trinkets, that cost her many a thousand years to forge,\r\nonly to break them in pieces for her sport. With infinite painstaking\r\nshe has manufactured man only to torture him with mean miseries in the\r\nembryonic stages of his race, and in his higher development to madden\r\nhim with intellectual puzzles. Thus it will be unto the end--which never\r\nshall be. For there is neither beginning nor end to her unvarying\r\ncycles. Whether the secular optimist be successful or unsuccessful in\r\nrealising his paltry span of terrestrial paradise, whether the pæans he\r\nsings about it are prophetic dithyrambs or misleading myths, no\r\nChristian man need fear for his own immortality. That is well assured.\r\nIn some form he will surely be raised from the dead. In some shape he\r\nwill live again. But, _Cui bono_?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFORCE--A REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Get me out of this, I am stifled--ill,\" Miss Metford said, in a low\r\nvoice to me.\r\n\r\nAs we were hurrying from the room, Brande and his sister, who had joined\r\nhim, met us. The fire had died out of his eyes. His voice had returned\r\nto its ordinary key. His demeanour was imperturbable, sphinx-like. I\r\nmurmured some words about the eloquence of the lecture, but interrupted\r\nmyself when I observed his complete indifference to my remarks, and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\"Neither praise nor blame seems to affect you, Brande.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" he answered calmly. \"You forget that there is nothing\r\ndeserving of either praise or blame.\"\r\n\r\nI knew I could not argue with him, so we passed on. Outside, I offered\r\nto find a cab for Miss Metford, and to my surprise she allowed me to do\r\nso. Her self-assertive manner was visibly modified. She made no pretence\r\nof resenting this slight attention, as was usual with her in similar\r\ncases. Indeed, she asked me to accompany her as far as our ways lay\r\ntogether. But I felt that my society at the time could hardly prove\r\nenlivening. I excused myself by saying candidly that I wished to be\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nMy own company soon became unendurable. In despair I turned into a music\r\nhall. The contrast between my mental excitement and the inanities of the\r\nstage was too acute, so this resource speedily failed me. Then I betook\r\nmyself to the streets again. Here I remembered a letter Brande had put\r\ninto my hand as I left the hall. It was short, and the tone was even\r\nmore peremptory than his usual arrogance. It directed me to meet the\r\nmembers of the Society at Charing Cross station at two o'clock on the\r\nfollowing day. No information was given, save that we were all going on\r\na long journey; that I must set my affairs in such order that my absence\r\nwould not cause any trouble, and the letter ended, \"Our experiments are\r\nnow complete. Our plans are matured. Do not fail to attend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fail to attend!\" I muttered. \"If I am not the most abject coward on the\r\nearth I will attend--with every available policeman in London.\" The\r\npent-up wrath and impotence of many days found voice at last. \"Yes,\r\nBrande,\" I shouted aloud, \"I will attend, and you shall be sorry for\r\nhaving invited me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will not be sorry,\" said Natalie Brande, touching my arm.\r\n\r\n\"You here!\" I exclaimed, in great surprise, for it was fully an hour\r\nsince I left the hall, and my movements had been at haphazard since\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have followed you for your own sake. Are you really going to\r\ndraw back now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I must go on alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not go on alone. You will remain, and your friends shall go on\r\nwithout you--go to prison without you, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor boy,\" she said softly, to herself. \"I wonder if I would have\r\nthought as I think now if I had known him sooner? I suppose I should\r\nhave been as other women, and their fools' paradise would have been\r\nmine--for a little while.\"\r\n\r\nThe absolute hopelessness in her voice pierced my heart. I pleaded\r\npassionately with her to give up her brother and all the maniacs who\r\nfollowed him. For the time I forgot utterly that the girl, by her own\r\nconfession, was already with them in sympathy as well as in deed.\r\n\r\nShe said to me: \"I cannot hold back now. And you? You know you are\r\npowerless to interfere. If you will not come with me, I must go alone.\r\nBut you may remain. I have prevailed on Herbert and Grey to permit\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" I answered. \"Where you go, I go.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not really necessary. In the end it will make no difference. And\r\nremember, you still think me guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so, I am going with you--guilty.\"\r\n\r\nNow this seemed to me a very ordinary speech, for who would have held\r\nback, thinking her innocent? But Natalie stopped suddenly, and, looking\r\nme in the face, said, almost with a sob:\r\n\r\n\"Arthur, I sometimes wish I had known you sooner. I might have been\r\ndifferent.\" She was silent for a moment. Then she said piteously to me:\r\n\"You will not fail me to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not fail you to-morrow,\" I answered.\r\n\r\nShe pressed my hand gratefully, and left me without any explanation as\r\nto her movements in the meantime.\r\n\r\nI hurried to my hotel to set my affairs in order before joining Brande's\r\nexpedition. The time was short for this. Fortunately there was not much\r\nto do. By midnight I had my arrangements nearly complete. At the time,\r\nthe greater part of my money was lying at call in a London bank. This I\r\ndetermined to draw in gold the next day. I also had at my banker's some\r\nscrip, and I knew I could raise money on that. My personal effects and\r\nthe mementos of my travels, which lay about my rooms in great confusion,\r\nmust remain where they were. As to the few friends who still remained to\r\nme, I did not write to them. I could not well describe a project of\r\nwhich I knew nothing, save that it was being carried out by dangerous\r\nlunatics, or, at least, by men who were dangerous, whether their madness\r\nwas real or assumed. Nor could I think of any reasonable excuse for\r\nleaving England after so long an absence without a personal visit to\r\nthem. It was best, then, to disappear without a word. Having finished my\r\ndispositions, I changed my coat for a dressing-gown and sat down by the\r\nwindow, which I threw open, for the summer night was warm. I sat long,\r\nand did not leave my chair until the morning sun was shining on my face.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to Charing Cross next day, a group of fifty or sixty people\r\nwere standing apart from the general crowd and conversing with\r\nanimation. Almost the whole strength of the Society was assembled to see\r\na few of us off, I thought. In fact, they were all going. About a dozen\r\nwomen were in the party, and they were dressed in the most extravagant\r\nrational costumes. Edith Metford was amongst them. I drew her aside, and\r\napologised for not having called to wish her farewell; but she stopped\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's all right; I am going too. Don't look so frightened.\"\r\n\r\nThis was more than I could tolerate. She was far too good a girl to be\r\nallowed to walk blindfold into the pit I had digged for myself with full\r\nknowledge. I said imperatively:\r\n\r\n\"Miss Metford, you shall not go. I warned you more than once--and warned\r\nyou, I firmly believe, at the risk of my life--against these people. You\r\nhave disregarded the advice which it may yet cost me dear to have given\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell you the truth,\" she said candidly, \"I would not go an inch if\r\nit were not for yourself. I can't trust you with them. You'd get into\r\nmischief. I don't mean with Natalie Brande, but the others; I don't like\r\nthem. So I am coming to look after you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall speak to Brande.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be useless. I joined the Society this morning.\"\r\n\r\nThis she said seriously, and without anything of the spirit of bravado\r\nwhich was one of her faults. That ended our dispute. We exchanged a\r\nmeaning look as our party took their seats. There was now, at any rate,\r\none human being in the Society to whom I could speak my mind.\r\n\r\nWe travelled by special train. Our ultimate destination was a fishing\r\nvillage on the southern coast, near Brande's residence. Here we found a\r\nsteam yacht of about a thousand tons lying in the harbour with steam up.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was a beautiful model. Her lines promised great speed, but\r\nthe comfort of her passengers had been no less considered by her builder\r\nwhen he gave her so much beam and so high a freeboard. The ship's\r\nfurniture was the finest I had ever seen, and I had crossed every great\r\nocean in the world. The library, especially, was more suggestive of a\r\nroom in the British Museum than the batch of books usually carried at\r\nsea. But I have no mind to enter on a detailed description of a\r\nbeautiful pleasure ship while my story waits. I only mention the general\r\ncondition of the vessel in evidence of the fact which now struck me for\r\nthe first time--Brande must have unlimited money. His mode of life in\r\nLondon and in the country, notwithstanding his pleasant house, was in\r\nthe simplest style. From the moment we entered his special train at\r\nCharing Cross, he flung money about him with wanton recklessness.\r\n\r\nAs we made our way through the crowd which was hanging about the quay,\r\nan unpleasant incident occurred. Miss Brande, with Halley and\r\nRockingham, became separated from Miss Metford and myself and went on in\r\nfront of us. We five had formed a sub-section of the main body, and were\r\nkeeping to ourselves when the unavoidable separation took place. A\r\nslight scream in front caused Miss Metford and myself to hurry forward.\r\nWe found the others surrounded by a gang of drunken sailors, who had\r\nstopped them. A red-bearded giant, frenzied with drink, had seized\r\nNatalie in his arms. His abettor, a swarthy Italian, had drawn his\r\nknife, and menaced Halley and Rockingham. The rest of the band looked\r\non, and cheered their chiefs. Halley was white to the lips; Rockingham\r\nwas perfectly calm, or, perhaps, indifferent. He called for a policeman.\r\nNeither interfered. I did not blame Rockingham; he was a man of the\r\nworld, so nothing manly could be expected of him. But Halley's cowardice\r\ndisgusted me.\r\n\r\nI rushed forward and caught the Italian from behind, for his knife was\r\ndangerous. Seizing him by the collar and waist, I swung him twice, and\r\nthen flung him from me with all my strength. He spun round two or three\r\ntimes, and then collided with a stack of timber. His head struck a beam,\r\nand he fell in his tracks without a word. The red-haired giant instantly\r\nreleased Natalie and put up his hands. The man's attitude showed that he\r\nknew nothing of defence. I swept his guard aside, and struck him\r\nviolently on the neck close to the ear. I was a trained boxer; but I had\r\nnever before struck a blow in earnest, or in such earnest, and I hardly\r\nknew my own strength. The man went down with a grunt like a pole-axed\r\nox, and lay where he fell. To a drunken sailor lad, who seemed anxious\r\nto be included in this matter, I dealt a stinging smack on the face\r\nwith my open hand that satisfied him straightway. The others did not\r\nmolest me. Turning from the crowd, I found Edith Metford looking at me\r\nwith blazing eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Superb! Marcel, I am proud of you!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Edith, how can you say that?\" Natalie Brande exclaimed, still\r\ntrembling. \"Such dreadful violence! The poor men knew no better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor fiddlesticks! It is well for you that Marcel is a man of violence.\r\nHe's worth a dozen sheep like--\"\r\n\r\n\"Like whom, Miss Metford?\" Rockingham asked, glaring at her so viciously\r\nthat I interposed with a hasty entreaty that all should hurry to the\r\nship. I did not trust the man.\r\n\r\nMiss Metford was not so easily suppressed. She said leisurely, \"I meant\r\nto say like you, and this over-nervous but otherwise admirable boy. If\r\nyou think 'sheep' derogatory, pray make it 'goats.'\"\r\n\r\nI hurried them on board. Brande welcomed us at the gangway. The vessel\r\nwas his own, so he was as much at home on the ship as in his country\r\nhouse. I had an important letter to write, and very little time for the\r\ntask. It was not finished a moment too soon, for the moment the last\r\npassenger and the last bale of luggage was on board, the captain's\r\ntelegraph rang from the bridge, and the _Esmeralda_ steamed out to sea.\r\nMy letter, however, was safe on shore. The land was low down upon the\r\nhorizon before the long summer twilight deepened slowly into night. Then\r\none by one the shadowy cliffs grew dim, dark, and disappeared. We saw no\r\nmore of England until after many days of gradually culminating horror.\r\nThe very night which was our first at sea did not pass without a strange\r\nadventure, which happened, indeed, by an innocent oversight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMORITURI TE SALUTANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had been sitting on deck chairs smoking and talking for a couple of\r\nhours after the late dinner, which was served as soon as the vessel was\r\nwell out to sea, when Brande came on deck. He was hailed with\r\nenthusiasm. This did not move him, or even interest him. I was careful\r\nnot to join in the acclamations produced by his presence. He noticed\r\nthis, and lightly called me recalcitrant. I admitted the justice of the\r\nepithet, and begged him to consider it one which would always apply to\r\nme with equal force. He laughed at this, and contrasted my gloomy fears\r\nwith the excellent arrangements which he had made for my comfort. I\r\nasked him what had become of Grey. I thought it strange that this man\r\nshould be amongst the absentees.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Grey! He goes to Labrador.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Labrador! What takes him to Labrador?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same purpose which takes us to the Arafura Sea,\" Brande answered,\r\nand passed on.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a slight stir amongst the people, and the word was\r\npassed round that Brande was about to undertake some interesting\r\nexperiment for the amusement of his guests. I hurried aft along with\r\nsome other men with whom I had been talking, and found Miss Brande and\r\nMiss Metford standing hand in hand. Natalie's face was very white, and\r\nthe only time I ever saw real fear upon it was at that moment. I thought\r\nthe incident on the quay had unnerved her more than was apparent at the\r\ntime, and that she was still upset by it. She beckoned to me, and when I\r\ncame to her she seized my hand. She was trembling so much her words were\r\nhardly articulate. Miss Metford was concerned for her companion's\r\nnervousness; but otherwise indifferent; while Natalie stood holding our\r\nhands in hers like a frightened child awaiting the firing of a cannon.\r\n\r\n\"He's going to let off something, a rocket, I suppose,\" Miss Metford\r\nsaid to me. \"Natalie seems to think he means to sink the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not mean to do so. He might, if an accident occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he going to fire a mine?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, he is going to etherize a drop of water.\" Natalie said this so\r\nseriously, we had no thought of laughter, incongruous as the cause of\r\nher fears might seem.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Brande addressed us from the top of the deckhouse, and\r\nexplained that, in order to illustrate on a large scale the most recent\r\ndiscovery in natural science, he was about to disintegrate a drop of\r\nwater, at present encased in a hollow glass ball about the size of a\r\npea, which he held between his thumb and forefinger. An electric light\r\nwas turned upon him so that we could all see the thing quite plainly. He\r\nexplained that there was a division in the ball; one portion of it\r\ncontaining the drop of water, and the other the agent by which, when the\r\ndividing wall was eaten through by its action, the atoms of the water\r\nwould be resolved into the ultimate ether of which they were composed.\r\nAs the disintegrating agent was powerless in salt water, we might all\r\nfeel assured that no great catastrophe would ensue.\r\n\r\nBefore throwing the glass ball overboard, a careful search for the\r\nlights of ships was made from east to west, and north to south.\r\n\r\nThere was not a light to be seen anywhere. Brande threw the ball over\r\nthe side. We were going under easy steam at the time, but the moment he\r\nleft the deckhouse \"full speed ahead\" was rung from the bridge, and the\r\n_Esmeralda_ showed us her pace. She literally tore through the water\r\nwhen the engines were got full on.\r\n\r\nBefore we had gone a hundred yards a great cry arose. A little fleet of\r\nFrench fishing-boats with no lights up had been lying very close to us\r\non the starboard bow. There they were, boatfuls of men, who waved\r\ncareless adieus to us as we dashed past.\r\n\r\nBrande was moved for a moment. Then he shrugged his shoulders and\r\nmuttered, \"It can't be helped now.\" We all felt that these simple words\r\nmight mean much. To test their full portent I went over to him, Natalie\r\nstill holding my hand with trembling fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you do anything for them?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"You mean, go back and sink this ship to keep them company?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but warn them to fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be useless. In this breeze they could not sail a hundred\r\nyards in the time allowed, and three miles is the nearest point of\r\nsafety. I could not say definitely, as this is the first time I have\r\never tried an experiment so tremendous; but I believe that if we even\r\nslowed to half speed, it would be dangerous, and if we stopped, the\r\n_Esmeralda_ would go to the bottom to-night, as certainly as the sun\r\nwill rise to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nNatalie moaned in anguish on hearing this. I said to her sternly:\r\n\r\n\"I thought you approved of all these actions?\"\r\n\r\n\"This serves no purpose. These men may not even have a painless death,\r\nand the reality is more awful than I thought.\"\r\n\r\nEvery face was turned to that point in the darkness toward which the\r\nfoaming wake of the _Esmeralda_ stretched back. Not a word more was\r\nspoken until Brande, who was standing, watch in hand, beside the light\r\nfrom the deckhouse, came aft and said:\r\n\r\n\"You will see the explosion in ten seconds.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not have spoken more indifferently if the catastrophe he had\r\nplanned was only the firing of a penny squib.\r\n\r\nThen the sea behind us burst into a flame, followed by the sound of an\r\nexplosion so frightful that we were almost stunned by it. A huge mass\r\nof water, torn up in a solid block, was hurled into the air, and there\r\nit broke into a hundred roaring cataracts. These, in the brilliant\r\nsearch light from the ship which was now turned upon them full, fell\r\nlike cataracts of liquid silver into the seething cauldron of water that\r\nraged below. The instant the explosion was over, our engines were\r\nreversed, and the _Esmeralda_ went full speed astern. The waves were\r\nstill rolling in tumultuous breakers when we got back. We might as well\r\nhave gone on.\r\n\r\nThe French fishing fleet had disappeared.\r\n\r\nI could not help saying to Brande before we turned in:\r\n\r\n\"You expect us, I suppose, to believe that the explosion was really\r\ncaused by a drop of water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Etherized,\" he interrupted. \"Certainly I do. You don't believe it--on\r\nwhat grounds?\"\r\n\r\n\"That it is unbelievable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! You deny a fact because you do not understand it. Ignorance is\r\nnot evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say it is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not wish to believe it possible. Wishes are not proofs.\"\r\n\r\nWithout pursuing the argument, I said to him:\r\n\r\n\"It is fortunate that the accident took place at sea. There will be no\r\ninquests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I am sorry for the accident. As for the men, they might have had a\r\nworse fate. It is better than living in life-long misery as they do.\r\nBesides, both they and the fishes that will eat them will soon be\r\nnumbered amongst the things that have been.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\"NO DEATH--SAVE IN LIFE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some days afterwards our voyage was uneventful, and the usual\r\nshipboard amusements were requisitioned to while away the tedious hours.\r\nThe French fishing fleet was never mentioned. We got through the Bay\r\nwith very little knocking about, and passed the Rock without calling. I\r\nwas not disappointed, for there was slight inducement for going ashore,\r\noppressed as I was with the ever-present incubus of dread. At intervals\r\nthis feeling became less acute, but only to return, strengthened by its\r\nshort absences. After a time my danger sense became blunted. The nervous\r\nsystem became torpid under continuous stress, and refused to pass on the\r\nsensations with sufficient intensity to the brain; or the weary brain\r\nwas asleep at its post and did not heed the warnings. I could think no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAnd this reminds me of something which I must tell about young Halley.\r\nFor several days after the voyage began, the boy avoided me. I knew his\r\nreason for doing this. I myself did not blame him for his want of\r\nphysical courage, but I was glad that he himself was ashamed of it.\r\n\r\nHalley came to me one morning and said:\r\n\r\n\"I wish to speak to you, Marcel. I _must_ speak to you. It is about that\r\nmiserable episode on the evening we left England. I acted like a cad.\r\nTherefore I must be a cad. I only want to tell you that I despise myself\r\nas much as you can. And that I envy you. I never thought that I should\r\nenvy a man simply because he had no nervous system.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this man without a nervous system of whom you speak?\" I asked\r\ncoldly. I was not sorry that I had an opportunity of reading him a\r\nlesson which might be placed opposite the many indignities which had\r\nbeen put upon me, in the form mainly of shoulder shrugs, brow\r\nelevations, and the like.\r\n\r\n\"You, of course. I mean no offence--you are magnificent. I am honest in\r\nsaying that I admire you. I wish I was like you in height, weight,\r\nmuscle--and absence of nervous system.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would keep your own brain, I suppose?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I would keep that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I will keep my own nervous system,\" I replied. \"And the difference\r\nbetween mine and yours is this: that whereas my own danger sense is, or\r\nwas, as keen as your own, I have my reserve of nerve force--or had\r\nit--which might be relied on to tide me over a sudden emergency. This\r\nreserve you have expended on your brain. There are two kinds of cowards;\r\nthe selfish coward who cares for no interest save his own; the unselfish\r\ncoward who cares nothing for himself, but who cannot face a danger\r\nbecause he dare not. And there are two kinds of brave men; the nerveless\r\nman you spoke of, who simply faces danger because he does not appreciate\r\nit, and the man who faces danger because, although he fears it he dares\r\nit. I have no difficulty in placing you in this list.\"\r\n\r\n\"You place me--\"\r\n\r\n\"A coward because you cannot help it. You are merely out of harmony with\r\nyour environment. You ought to bring a supply of 'environment' about\r\nwith you, seeing that you cannot manufacture it off-hand like myself. I\r\nwish to be alone. Good-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before I go, Marcel, I will say this.\" There were tears in his eyes.\r\n\"These people do not really know you, with all their telepathic power.\r\nYou are not--not--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not as great a fool as they think. Thank you. I mean to prove that to\r\nthem some day.\"\r\n\r\nWith that I turned away from him, although I felt that he would have\r\ngladly stayed longer with me.\r\n\r\nWhile the _Esmeralda_ was sweeping over the long swells of the\r\nMediterranean, I heard Brande lecture for the second time. It was a\r\nfitting interlude between his first and third addresses. I might\r\nclassify them thus--the first, critical; the second, constructive; the\r\nthird, executive. His third speech was the last he made in the world.\r\n\r\nWe were assembled in the saloon. It would have been pleasanter on the\r\nupper deck, owing to the heat, but the speaker could not then have been\r\neasily heard in the noise of the wind and waves. I could scarcely\r\nbelieve that it was Brande who arose to speak, so changed was his\r\nexpression. The frank scepticism, which had only recently degenerated\r\ninto a cynicism, still tempered with a half kindly air of easy\r\nsuperiority, was gone. In its place there was a look of concentrated\r\nand relentless purpose which dominated the man himself and all who saw\r\nhim. He began in forcible and direct sentences, with only a faintly\r\nreminiscent eloquence which was part of himself, and from which he could\r\nnot without a conscious effort have freed his style. But the whole\r\nbearing of the man had little trace in it of the dilettante academician\r\nwhom we all remembered.\r\n\r\n\"When I last addressed this Society,\" he began, \"I laboured under a\r\ndifficulty in arriving at ultimate truth which was of my own\r\nmanufacture. I presupposed, as you will remember, the indestructibility\r\nof the atom, and, in logical consequence I was bound to admit the\r\nconservation of suffering, the eternity of misery. But on that evening\r\nmany of my audience were untaught in the rudiments of ultimate thought,\r\nand some were still sceptical of the _bona fides_ of our purpose, and\r\nour power to achieve its object. To them, in their then ineptitude, what\r\nI shall say now would have been unintelligible. For in the same way that\r\nthe waves of light or sound exceeding a certain maximum can not be\r\ntransferred to the brain by dull eyes and ears, my thought pulsations\r\nwould have escaped those auditors by virtue of their own\r\nirresponsiveness. To-night I am free from the limitation which I then\r\nsuffered, because there are none around me now who have not sufficient\r\nknowledge to grasp what I shall present.\r\n\r\n\"You remember that I traced for you the story of evolution in its\r\njourney from the atom to the star. And I showed you that the hypothesis\r\nof the indestructibility of the atom was simply a creed of cruelty writ\r\nlarge. I now proceed on the lines of true science to show you how that\r\nhypothesis is false; that as the atom _is_ destructible--as you have\r\nseen by our experiments (the last of which resulted in a climax not\r\nintended by me)--the whole scheme of what is called creation falls to\r\npieces. As the atom was the first etheric blunder, so the material\r\nUniverse is the grand etheric mistake.\r\n\r\n\"In considering the marvellous and miserable succession of errors\r\nresulting from the meretricious atomic remedy adopted by the ether to\r\ncure its local sores, it must first be said of the ether itself that\r\nthere is too much of it. Space is not sufficient for it. Thus, the\r\nparticles of ether--those imponderable entities which vibrate through a\r\nblock of marble or a disc of hammered steel with only a dulled, not an\r\nannihilated motion, are by their own tumultuous plenty packed closer\r\ntogether than they wish. I say wish, for if all material consciousness\r\nand sentiency be founded on atomic consciousness, then in its turn\r\natomic consciousness is founded upon, and dependent on, etheric\r\nconsciousness. These particles of ether, therefore, when too closely\r\nimpinged upon by their neighbours, resent the impact, and in doing so\r\ninitiate etheric whirlwinds, from whose vast perturbances stupendous\r\ndrifts set out. In their gigantic power these avalanches crush the\r\nparticles which impede them, force the resisting medium out of its\r\nnormal stage, destroy the homogeneity of its constituents, and mass them\r\ninto individualistic communities whose vibrations play with greater\r\nfreedom when they synchronise. The homogeneous etheric tendencies recede\r\nand finally determine.\r\n\r\n\"Behold a miracle! An atom is born!\r\n\r\n\"By a similar process--which I may liken to that of putting off an evil\r\nday which some time must be endured--the atoms group themselves into\r\nmolecules. In their turn the molecules go forth to war, capturing or\r\nbeing captured; the vibrations of the slaves always being forced to\r\nsynchronise with those of their conquerors. The nucleus of the gas of a\r\nprimal metal is now complete, and the foundation of a solar\r\nsystem--paltry molecule of the Universe as it is--is laid. Thereafter,\r\nthe rest is easily followed. It is described in your school books, and\r\nmust not occupy me now.\r\n\r\n\"But one word I will interpolate which may serve to explain a curious\r\nand interesting human belief. You are aware of how, in times past, men\r\nof absolutely no scientific insight held firmly to the idea that an\r\nelixir of life and a philosopher's stone might be discovered, and that\r\nthese two objects were nearly always pursued contemporaneously. That is\r\nto my mind an extraordinary example of the force of atomic\r\nconsciousness. The idea itself was absolutely correct; but the men who\r\nfollowed it had slight knowledge of its unity, and none whatever of its\r\nproper pursuit. They would have worked on their special lines to\r\neternity before advancing a single step toward their object. And this\r\nbecause they did not know what life was, and death was, and what the\r\nmetals ultimately signified which they, blind fools, so unsuccessfully\r\ntried to transmute. But we know more than they. We have climbed no doubt\r\nin the footholds they have carved, and we have gained the summit they\r\nonly saw in the mirage of hope. For we know that there is no life, no\r\ndeath, no metals, no matter, no emotions, no thoughts; but that all\r\nthat we call by these names is only the ether in various conditions.\r\nLife! I could live as long as this earth will submit to human existence\r\nif I had studied that paltry problem. Metals! The ship in which you sail\r\nwas bought with gold manufactured in my crucibles.\r\n\r\n\"The unintelligent--or I should say the grossly ignorant--have long held\r\nover the heads of the pioneers of science these two great charges: No\r\nman has ever yet transmuted a metal; no man has ever yet proved the\r\nconnecting link between organic and inorganic life. I say _life_, for I\r\ntake it that this company admits that a slab of granite is as much alive\r\nas any man or woman I see before me. But I have manufactured gold, and I\r\ncould have manufactured protoplasm if I had devoted my life to that\r\nobject. My studies have been almost wholly on the inorganic plane. Hence\r\nthe 'philosopher's stone' came in my way, but not the 'elixir of life.'\r\nThe molecules of protoplasm are only a little more complex than the\r\nmolecules of hydrogen or nitrogen or iron or coal. You may fuse iron,\r\nvaporise water, intermix the gases; but the molecules of all change\r\nlittle in such metamorphosis. And you may slay twenty thousand men at\r\nWaterloo or Sedan, or ten thousand generations may be numbered with the\r\ndust, and not an ounce of protoplasm lies dead. All molecules are merely\r\narrangements of atoms made under different degrees of pressure and of\r\ndifferent ages. And all atoms are constructed of identical\r\nconstituents--the ether, as I have said. Therefore the ether, which was\r\nfrom the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, which is the same\r\nyesterday, to-day, and for ever, is the origin of force, of matter, of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"_It is alive!_\r\n\r\n\"Its starry children are so many that the sands of the sea-shore may not\r\nbe used as a similitude for their multitude; and they extend so far that\r\ndistance may not be named in relation to them. They are so high above us\r\nand so deep below us that there is neither height nor depth in them.\r\nThere is neither east nor west in them, nor north and south in them. Nor\r\nis there beginning or end to them. Time drops his scythe and stands\r\nappalled before that dreadful host. Number applies not to its eternal\r\nmultitudes. Distance is lost in boundless space. And from all the stars\r\nthat stud the caverns of the Universe, there swells this awful chorus:\r\nFailure! failure and futility! And the ether is to blame!\r\n\r\n\"Heterogeneous suffering is more acute than homogeneous, because the\r\nagony is intensified by being localised; because the comfort of the\r\ncomfortable is purchasable only by the multiplied misery of the\r\nmiserable; because aristocratic leisure requires that the poor should be\r\nalways with it. There is, therefore, no gladness without its\r\noverbalancing sorrow. There is no good without intenser evil. There is\r\nno death save in life.\r\n\r\n\"Back, then, from this ill-balanced and unfair long-suffering, this\r\ninsufficient existence. Back to Nirvana--the ether! And I will lead the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"The agent I will employ has cost me all life to discover. It will\r\nrelease the vast stores of etheric energy locked up in the huge atomic\r\nwarehouse of this planet. I shall remedy the grand mistake only to a\r\ndegree which it would be preposterous to call even microscopic; but when\r\nI have done what I can, I am blameless for the rest. In due season the\r\nwhole blunder will be cured by the same means that I shall use, and all\r\nthe hideous experiment will be over, and everlasting rest or\r\n_quasi_-rest will supersede the magnificent failure of material\r\nexistence. This earth, at least, and, I am encouraged to hope, the whole\r\nsolar system, will by my instrumentality be restored to the ether from\r\nwhich it never should have emerged. Once before, in the history of our\r\nsystem, an effort similar to mine was made, unhappily without success.\r\n\r\n\"This time we shall not fail!\"\r\n\r\nA low murmur rose from the audience as the lecturer concluded, and a\r\nhushed whisper asked:\r\n\r\n\"Where was that other effort made?\"\r\n\r\nBrande faced round momentarily, and said quietly but distinctly:\r\n\r\n\"On the planet which was where the Asteroids are now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMISS METFORD'S PLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe coaled at Port Said like any ordinary steamer. Although I had more\r\nthan once made the Red Sea voyage, I had never before taken the\r\nslightest interest in the coaling of the vessel on which I was a\r\npassenger. This time everything was different. That which interested me\r\nbefore seemed trivial now. And that which had before seemed trivial was\r\nnow absorbing. I watched the coaling--commonplace as the spectacle\r\nwas--with vivid curiosity. The red lights, the sooty demons at work,\r\nevery bag of coals they carried, and all the coal dust clouds they\r\ncreated, were fitting episodes in a voyage such as ours. We took an\r\nenormous quantity of coal on board. I remained up most of the night in a\r\nframe of mind which I thought none might envy. I myself would have made\r\nlight of it had I known what was still in store for the _Esmeralda_ and\r\nher company. It was nearly morning when I turned in. When I awoke we\r\nwere nearing the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nOn deck, the conversation of our party was always eccentric, but this\r\nmust be said for it: there was sometimes a scintillating brilliance in\r\nit that almost blinded one to its extreme absurdity. The show of high\r\nspirits which was very general was, in the main, unaffected. For the\r\nrest it was plainly assumed. But those who assumed their parts did so\r\nwith a histrionic power which was all the more surprising when it is\r\nremembered that the origin of their excellent playing was centred in\r\ntheir own fears. I preserved a neutral attitude. I did not venture on\r\nany overt act of insubordination. That would have only meant my\r\ndestruction, without any counter-balancing advantage in the way of\r\nbaulking an enterprise in which I was a most unwilling participator. And\r\nto pretend what I did not feel was a task which I had neither stomach to\r\nundertake nor ability to carry out successfully. In consequence I kept\r\nmy own counsel--and that of Edith Metford.\r\n\r\nBrande was the most easily approached maniac I had ever met. His\r\naffability continued absolutely consistent. I took advantage of this to\r\nsay to him on a convenient opportunity: \"Why did you bring these people\r\nwith you? They must all be useless, and many of them little better than\r\na nuisance!\"\r\n\r\n\"Marcel, you are improving. Have you attained the telepathic power? You\r\nhave read my mind.\" This was said with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\"I can not read your mind,\" I answered; \"I only diagnose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your diagnosis is correct. I answer you in a sentence. They are all\r\nsympathetic, and human sympathy is necessary to me until my purpose is\r\nfulfilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not look to me for any measure of this sympathy, I trust?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not. You are antipathetic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"But necessary, all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it, until the proper time shall come.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will never come,\" Brande said firmly.\r\n\r\n\"We shall see,\" I replied as firmly as himself.\r\n\r\nNext evening as we were steaming down the blue waters--deep blue they\r\nalways seemed to me--of the Red Sea, I was sitting on the foredeck\r\nsmoking and trying to think. I did not notice how the time passed. What\r\nseemed to me an hour at most, must have been three or four. With the\r\nexception of the men of the crew who were on duty, I was alone, for the\r\nheat was intense, and most of our people were lying in their cabins\r\nprostrated in spite of the wind-sails which were spread from every port\r\nto catch the breeze. My meditations were as usual gloomy and despondent.\r\nThey were interrupted by Miss Metford. She joined me so noiselessly that\r\nI was not aware of her presence until she laid her hand on my arm. I\r\nstarted at her touch, but she whispered a sharp warning, so full of\r\nsuppressed emotion that I instantly recovered a semblance of unconcern.\r\n\r\nThe girl was very white and nervous. This contrast from her usual\r\nequanimity was disquieting. She clung to me hysterically as she gasped:\r\n\r\n\"Marcel, it is a mercy I have found you alone, and that there is one\r\nsane man in this shipful of lunatics.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you are not altogether right,\" I said, as I placed a seat\r\nfor her close to mine. \"I can hardly be sane when I am a voluntary\r\npassenger on board this vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think they mean what they say?\" she asked hurriedly,\r\nwithout noticing my remark.\r\n\r\n\"I really think they have discovered the secret of extraordinary natural\r\nforces, so powerful and so terrible that no one can say what they may or\r\nmay not accomplish. And that is the reason I begged you not to come on\r\nthis voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the good of asking me not to come without giving me some\r\nreason?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had I done so, they might have killed you as they have done others\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might have chanced that, seeing that it will probably end that\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they would certainly have killed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\nI wondered at the sudden intensity of the girl's sharp gasp when I said\r\nthis, and marvelled too, how she, who had always been so mannish,\r\nnestled close to me and allowed her head to sink down on my shoulder. I\r\npitied the strong-willed, self-reliant nature which had given way under\r\nsome strain of which I had yet to be told. So I stooped and touched her\r\ncheek with my lips in a friendly way, at which she looked up to me with\r\nhalf-closed eyes, and whispered in a voice strangely soft and womanish\r\nfor her:\r\n\r\n\"If they must kill us, I wish they would kill us now.\"\r\n\r\nI stroked her soft cheek gently, and urged a less hopeless view. \"Even\r\nif the worst come, we may as well live as long as we can.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon to my surprise she, having shot one quick glance into my eyes,\r\nput my arm away and drew her chair apart from mine. Her head was turned\r\naway from me, but I could not but notice that her bosom rose and fell\r\nswiftly. Presently she faced round again, lit a cigarette, put her hands\r\nin the pocket of her jacket, and her feet on another chair, and said\r\nindifferently:\r\n\r\n\"You are right. Even if the worst must come, we may as well live as long\r\nas we can.\"\r\n\r\nThis sudden change in her manner surprised me. I knew I had no art in\r\ndealing with women, so I let it pass without comment, and looked out at\r\nthe glassy sea.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes of silence, the girl spoke to me again.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything of the actual plans of these maniacs?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I only know their preposterous purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know how it is to be done. Natalie was restless last night--you\r\nknow that we share the same cabin--and she raved a bit. I kept her in\r\nher berth by sheer force, but I allowed her to talk.\"\r\n\r\nThis was serious. I drew my chair close to Miss Metford's and whispered,\r\n\"For heaven's sake, speak low.\" Then I remembered Brande's power, and\r\nwrung my hands in helpless impotence. \"You forget Brande. At this moment\r\nhe is taking down every word we say.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's doing nothing of the sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you forget--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't forget. By accident I put morphia in the tonic he takes, and he\r\nis now past telepathy for some hours at least. He's sound asleep. I\r\nsuppose if I had not done it by accident he would have known what I was\r\ndoing, and so have refused the medicine. Anyhow, accident or no\r\naccident, I have done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"And this precious disintegrating agent! They haven't it with them, it\r\nseems. To manufacture it in sufficient quantity would be impossible in\r\nany civilised country without fear of detection or interruption. Brande\r\nhas the prescription, formula--what do you call it?--and if you could\r\nget the paper and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Throw it overboard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish! They would work it all out again.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" I whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Steal the paper and--wouldn't it do to put in an extra _x_ or _y_, or\r\nstick a couple of additional figures into any suitable vacancy? Don't\r\nyou think they'd go on with the scheme and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And?\"\r\n\r\n\"And make a mess of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Metford,\" I said, rising from my chair, \"I mean Metford, I know\r\nyou like to be addressed as a man--or used to like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I used to,\" she assented coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to take you in my arms and kiss you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm hanged if you are!\" she exclaimed, so sharply that I was suddenly\r\nabashed. My intended familiarity and its expression appeared grotesque,\r\nalthough a few minutes before she was so friendly. But I could not waste\r\nprecious time in studying a girl's caprices, so I asked at once:\r\n\r\n\"How can I get this paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said _steal_ it, if you recollect.\" Her voice was now hard, almost\r\nharsh. \"You can get it in Brande's cabin, if you are neither afraid nor\r\njealous.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not much afraid, and I will try it. What do you mean by jealous?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, would you, to save Natalie Brande--for they will certainly\r\nsucceed in blowing themselves up, if nobody else--consent to her\r\nmarrying another man, say that young lunatic Halley, who is always\r\ndangling after her when you are not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered, after some thought. For Halley's attentions to\r\nNatalie had been so marked, the plainly inconsequent mention of him in\r\nthis matter did not strike me. \"If that is necessary to save her, of\r\ncourse I would consent to it. Why do you ask? In my place you would do\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I'd see the ship and all its precious passengers at the bottom of\r\nthe sea first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but you are not a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right! and what's more, I'm glad of it.\" Then looking down at the\r\nrational part of her costume, she added sharply, \"I sha'n't wear these\r\nthings again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nROCKINGHAM TO THE SHARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock in the morning I arose, dressed hurriedly, drew on a pair\r\nof felt slippers, and put a revolver in my pocket. It was then time to\r\nput Edith Metford's proposal to the proof, and she would be waiting for\r\nme on deck to hear whether I had succeeded in it. We had parted a couple\r\nof hours before on somewhat chilling terms. I had agreed to follow her\r\nsuggestion, but I could not trouble my tired brain by guesses at the\r\ncause of her moods.\r\n\r\nIt was very dark. There was only enough light to enable me to find my\r\nway along the corridor, off which the state-rooms occupied by Brande and\r\nhis immediate lieutenants opened. All the sleepers were restless from\r\nthe terrible heat. As I stole along, a muffled word, a sigh, or a\r\nmovement in the berths, made me pause at every step with a beating\r\nheart. Having listened till all was quiet, I moved on again noiselessly.\r\nI was almost at the end of the corridor. So intent had I been on\r\npreserving perfect silence, it did not sooner occur to me that I was\r\nsearching for any special door. I had forgotten Brande's number!\r\n\r\nI could no more think of it than one can recall the name of a\r\nhalf-forgotten acquaintance suddenly encountered in the street. It might\r\nhave been fourteen, or forty-one; or a hundred and fifty. Every number\r\nwas as likely as it was unlikely. I tried vainly to concentrate my mind.\r\nThe result was nothing. The missing number gave no clue. To enter the\r\nwrong room in that ship at that hour meant death for me. Of that I was\r\ncertain. To leave the right room unentered gave away my first chance in\r\nthe unequal battle with Brande. Then, as I knew that my first chance\r\nwould probably be my last, if not availed of, I turned to the nearest\r\ndoor and quietly tried the handle. The door was not locked. I entered\r\nthe state-room.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" It was Halley's voice that came from the berth.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" I whispered, \"a mistake. The heat, you know. Went on deck,\r\nand have blundered into your room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all right. Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brande.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night. You did not blunder far;\" this sleepily.\r\n\r\nI went out and closed the door quietly. I had gained something. I was\r\nwithin one door of my destination, for I knew that Halley was berthed\r\nbetween Rockingham and Brande. But I did not know on which side Brande's\r\nroom was, and I dared not ask. I tried the next door going forward. It\r\nopened like the other. I went in.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo there!\" This time no sleepy or careless man challenged me. It was\r\nRockingham's voice.\r\n\r\n\"May I not enter my own room?\" I whispered.\r\n\r\n\"This is not your room. You are?\" Rockingham sprang up in his berth, but\r\nbefore he could leave it I was upon him.\r\n\r\n\"I am Arthur Marcel. And this iron ring which I press against your left\r\near is the muzzle of my revolver. Speak, move, breathe above your\r\nnatural breath and your brains go through that porthole. Now, loose your\r\nhold of my arm and come with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You fool!\" hissed Rockingham. \"You dare not fire. You know you dare\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to call out, but my left hand closed on his throat, and a\r\ngurgling gasp was all that issued from him.\r\n\r\nI laid down the revolver and turned the ear of the strangling man close\r\nto my mouth. I had little time to think; but thought flies fast when\r\nsuch deadly peril menaces the thinker as that which I must face if I\r\nfailed to make terms with the man who was in my power. I knew that\r\nnotwithstanding his intensely disagreeable nature, if he gave his\r\npromise either by spoken word or equivalent sign, I could depend upon\r\nhim. There were no liars in Brande's Society. But the word I could not\r\ntrust him to say. I must have his sign. I whispered:\r\n\r\n\"You know I do not wish to kill you. I shall never have another happy\r\nday if you force me to it. I have no choice. You must yield or die. If\r\nyou will yield and stand by me rather than against me in what shall\r\nfollow, choose life by taking your right hand from my wrist and touching\r\nmy left shoulder. I will not hurt you meanwhile. If you choose death,\r\ntouch me with your left.\"\r\n\r\nThe sweat stood on my forehead in big beads as I waited for his choice.\r\nIt was soon made. He unlocked his left hand and placed it firmly on my\r\nright shoulder.\r\n\r\nHe had chosen death.\r\n\r\nSo the man was only a physical coward--or perhaps he had only made a\r\nchoice of alternatives.\r\n\r\nI said slowly and in great agony, \"May God have mercy on your soul--and\r\nmine!\" on which the muscles in my left arm stiffened. The big biceps--an\r\nheirloom of my athletic days--thickened up, and I turned my eyes away\r\nfrom the dying face, half hidden by the darkness. His struggles were\r\nvery terrible, but with my weight upon his lower limbs, and my grasp\r\nupon his windpipe, that death-throe was as silent as it was horrible.\r\nThe end came slowly. I could not bear the horror of it longer. I must\r\nfinish it and be done with it. I put my right arm under the man's\r\nshoulders and raised the upper part of his body from the berth. Then a\r\ndesperate wrench with my left arm, and there was a dull crack like the\r\nsnapping of a dry stick. It was over. Rockingham's neck was broken.\r\n\r\nI wiped away the bloody froth that oozed from the gaping mouth, and\r\ntried to compose decently the contorted figure. I covered the face.\r\nThen I started on my last mission, for now I knew the door. I had\r\nbought the knowledge dearly, and I meant to use it for my own purpose,\r\ncareless of what violence might be necessary to accomplish my end.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered Brande's state-room I found the electric light full on.\r\nHe was seated at a writing-table with his head resting on his arms,\r\nwhich hung crossways over the desk. The sleeper breathed so deeply it\r\nwas evident that the effect of the morphia was still strong upon him.\r\nOne hand clutched a folded parchment. His fingers clasped it\r\nnervelessly, and I had only to force them open one by one in order to\r\nwithdraw the manuscript. As I did this, he moaned and moved in his\r\nchair. I had no fear of his awaking. My hand shook as I unfolded the\r\nparchment which I unconsciously handled as carefully as though the thing\r\nitself were as deadly as the destruction which might be wrought by its\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nTo me the whole document was a mass of unintelligible formulæ. My rusty\r\nuniversity education could make nothing of it. But I could not waste\r\ntime in trying to solve the puzzle, for I did not know what moment some\r\nother visitor might arrive to see how Brande fared. I first examined\r\nwith a pocket microscope the ink of the manuscript, and then making a\r\nscratch with Brande's pen on a page of my note-book, I compared the two.\r\nThe colours were identical. It was the same ink.\r\n\r\nIn several places where a narrow space had been left vacant, I put 1 in\r\nfront of the figures which followed. I had no reason for making this\r\nparticular alteration, save that the figure 1 is more easily forged than\r\nany other, and the forgery is consequently more difficult to detect. My\r\nadditions, when the ink was dry, could only have been discovered by one\r\nwho was informed that the document had been tampered with. It was\r\nprobable that a drawer which stood open with the keys in the lock was\r\nthe place where Brande kept this paper; where he would look for it on\r\nawaking. I locked it in the drawer and put the keys into his pocket.\r\n\r\nThere was something still to do with the sleeping man, whose brain\r\ncompassed such marvellous powers. His telepathic faculty must be\r\ndestroyed. I must keep him seriously ill, without killing him. As long\r\nas he remained alive his friends would never question his calculations,\r\nand the fiasco which was possible under any circumstances would then be\r\nassured. I had with me an Eastern drug, which I had bought from an\r\nIndian fakir once in Murzapoor. The man was an impostor, whose tricks\r\ndid not impose on me. But the drug, however he came by it, was reliable.\r\nIt was a poison which produced a mild form of cerebritis that dulled but\r\ndid not deaden the mental powers. It acted almost identically whether\r\nadministered sub-cutaneously or, of course in a larger dose, internally.\r\nI brought it home with the intention of giving it to a friend who was\r\ninterested in vivisection. I did not think that I myself should be the\r\nfirst and last to experiment with it. It served my purpose well.\r\n\r\nThe moment I pricked his skin, Brande moved in his seat. My hand was on\r\nhis throat. He nestled his head down again upon his arms, and drew a\r\ndeep breath. Had he moved again that breath would have been his last. I\r\nhad been so wrought upon by what I had already done that night, I would\r\nhave taken his life without the slightest hesitation, if the sacrifice\r\nseemed necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen my operation was over, I left the room and moved silently along the\r\ncorridor till I came to the ladder leading to the deck. Edith Metford\r\nwas waiting for me as we had arranged. She was shivering in spite of the\r\nawful heat.\r\n\r\n\"Have you done it?\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" I answered, without saying how much I had done. \"Now you must\r\nretire--and rest easy. The formula won't work. I have put both it and\r\nBrande himself out of gear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" she gasped, and then a sudden faintness came over her. It\r\npassed quickly, and as soon as she was sufficiently restored, I begged\r\nher to go below. She pleaded that she could not sleep, and asked me to\r\nremain with her upon the deck. \"It would be absurd to suppose that\r\neither of us could sleep this night,\" she very truly said. On which I\r\nwas obliged to tell her plainly that she must go below. I had more to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\"Can I help?\" she asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No. If you could, I would ask you, for you are a brave girl. I have\r\nsomething now to get through which is not woman's work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your work is my work,\" she answered. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have to lower a body overboard without anyone observing me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no time for discussion, so I told her at once, knowing that\r\nshe would not give way otherwise. She started at my words, but said\r\nfirmly:\r\n\r\n\"How will you do that unobserved by the 'watch'? Go down and bring up\r\nyour--bring it up. I will keep the men employed.\" She went forward, and\r\nI turned again to the companion.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to Rockingham's cabin I took a sheet of paper and wrote,\r\n\"Heat--Mad!\" making no attempt to imitate his writing. I simply scrawled\r\nthe words with a rough pen in the hope that they would pass as a message\r\nfrom a man who was hysterical when he wrote them. Then I turned to the\r\nberth and took up the body. It was not a pleasant thing to do. But it\r\nmust be done.\r\n\r\nI was a long time reaching the deck, for the arms and legs swung to and\r\nfro, and I had to move cautiously lest they should knock against the\r\nwoodwork I had to pass. I got it safely up and hurried aft with it.\r\nEdith, I knew, would contrive to keep the men on watch engaged until I\r\nhad disposed of my burden. I picked up a coil of rope and made it fast\r\nto the dead man's neck. Taking one turn of the rope round a boat-davit,\r\nI pushed the thing over the rail. I intended to let go the rope the\r\nmoment the weight attached to it was safely in the sea, and so lowered\r\naway silently, paying out the line without excessive strain owing to the\r\nsupport of the davit round which I had wound it. I had not to wait so\r\nlong as that, for just as the body was dangling over the foaming wake of\r\nthe steamer, a little streak of moonlight shot out from behind a bank of\r\ncloud and lighted the vessel with a sudden gleam. I was startled by\r\nthis, and held on, fearing that some watching eye might see my curious\r\nmovements. For a minute I leaned over the rail and watched the track of\r\nthe steamer as though I had come on deck for the air. There was a quick\r\nrush near the vessel's quarter. Something dark leaped out of the water,\r\nand there was a sharp snap--a crunch. The lower limbs were gone in the\r\njaws of a shark. I let go the rope in horror, and the body dropped\r\nsplashing into that hideous fishing-ground. Sick to death I turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"Get below quickly,\" Edith Metford said in my ear. \"They heard the\r\nsplash, slight as it was, and are coming this way.\" Her warning was\r\nnearly a sob.\r\n\r\nWe hurried down the companion as fast as we dared, and listened to the\r\ncomments of the watch above. They were soon satisfied that nothing of\r\nimportance had occurred, and resumed their stations.\r\n\r\nBefore we parted on that horrible night, Edith said in a trembling\r\nvoice, \"You have done your work like a brave man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say rather, like a forger and murderer,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she maintained. \"Many men before you have done much worse in a\r\ngood cause. You are not a forger. You are a diplomat. You are not a\r\nmurderer. You are a hero.\"\r\n\r\nBut I, being new to this work of slaughter and deception, could only\r\ndeprecate her sympathy and draw away. I felt that my very presence near\r\nher was pollution. I was unclean, and I told her that I was so.\r\nWhereupon, without hesitation, she put her arms round my neck, and said\r\nclinging closely to me:\r\n\r\n\"You are not unclean--you are free from guilt. And--Arthur--I will kiss\r\nyou now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\"IF NOT TOO LATE!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I came on deck next morning the coast of Arabia was rising, a thin\r\nthread of hazy blue between the leaden grey of the sea and the soft grey\r\nof the sky. The morning was cloudy, and the blazing sunlight was veiled\r\nin atmospheric gauze. I had hardly put my foot on deck when Natalie\r\nBrande ran to meet me. I hung back guiltily.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would never come. There is dreadful news!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nI muttered some incoherent words, to which she did not attend, but went\r\non hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\"Rockingham has thrown himself overboard in a hysterical fit, brought on\r\nby the heat. The sailors heard the splash--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know they did.\" This escaped me unawares, and I instantly\r\nprevaricated, \"I have been told about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that Herbert is ill?\"\r\n\r\nI could have conscientiously answered this question affirmatively also.\r\nHer sudden sympathy for human misadventure jarred upon me, as it had\r\ndone once before, when I thought of the ostensible object of the cruise.\r\nI said harshly:\r\n\r\n\"Then Rockingham is at rest, and your brother is on the road to it.\" It\r\nwas a brutal speech. It had a very different effect to that which I\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" she said. \"But think of the awful consequences if, now that\r\nRockingham is gone, Herbert should be seriously ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do think of it,\" I said stiffly. Indeed, I could hardly keep from\r\nadding that I had provided for it.\r\n\r\n\"You must come to him at once. I have faith in you.\" This gave me a\r\ntwinge. \"I have no faith in Percival\" (the ship's doctor).\r\n\r\n\"You are nursing your brother?\" I said with assumed carelessness.\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is Percival giving him?\"\r\n\r\nShe described the treatment, and as this was exactly what I myself would\r\nhave prescribed to put my own previous interference right, I promised to\r\ncome at once, saying:\r\n\r\n\"It is quite evident that Percival does not understand the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exactly what I thought,\" Natalie agreed, leading me to Brande's\r\ncabin. I found his vitality lower than I expected, and he was very\r\nimpatient. The whole purpose of his life was at stake, dependent on his\r\npreserving a healthy body, on which, in turn, a vigorous mind depends.\r\n\r\n\"How soon can you get me up?\" he asked sharply, when my pretended\r\nexamination was over.\r\n\r\n\"I should say a month at most.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be too long,\" he cried. \"You must do it in less.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not depend on me--\"\r\n\r\n\"It does depend on you. I know life itself. You know the paltry science\r\nof organic life. I have had no time for such trivial study. Get me well\r\nwithin three days, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am attending.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the hold over my sister's imagination which I have gained, I will\r\nkill her on the fourth morning from now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will--_not_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I will,\" Brande shrieked, starting up in his berth. \"I could\r\ndo it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could--_not_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, do you know what you are saying? You to bandy words with me! A\r\nclod-brained fool to dare a man of science! Man of science forsooth!\r\nYour men of science are to me as brain-benumbed, as brain-bereft, as\r\nthat fly which I crush--thus!\"\r\n\r\nThe buzzing insect was indeed dead. But I was something more than a fly.\r\nAt last I was on a fair field with this scientific magician or madman.\r\nAnd on a fair field I was not afraid of him.\r\n\r\n\"You are agitating yourself unnecessarily and injuriously,\" I said in my\r\nbest professional manner. \"And if you persist in doing so you will make\r\nmy one month three.\"\r\n\r\nIn a voice of undisguised scorn, Brande exclaimed, without noticing my\r\ninterruption:\r\n\r\n\"Bearded by a creature whose little mind is to me like the open page of\r\na book to read when the humour seizes me.\" Then with a fierce glance at\r\nme he cried:\r\n\r\n\"I have read your mind before. I can read it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can--_not_.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw himself back in his berth and strove to concentrate his mind.\r\nFor nearly five minutes he lay quite still, and then he said gently:\r\n\r\n\"You are right. Have you, then, a higher power than I?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; a lower!\"\r\n\r\n\"A lower! What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that I have merely paralysed your brain--that for many months to\r\ncome it will not be restored to its normal power--that it will never\r\nreach its normal power again unless I choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then all is lost--lost--lost!\" he wailed out. \"The end is as far off,\r\nand the journey as long, and the way as hard, as if I had never striven.\r\nAnd the tribute of human tears will be exacted to the uttermost. My life\r\nhas been in vain!\"\r\n\r\nThe absolute agony in his voice, the note of almost superhuman suffering\r\nand despair, was so intense, that, without thinking of what it was this\r\nman was grieving over, I found myself saying soothingly:\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Nothing is lost. It is only your own overstrained nervous\r\nsystem which sends these fantastic nightmares to your brain. I will soon\r\nmake you all right if you will listen to reason.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to me with the most appealing look which I had ever seen in\r\nhuman eyes save once before--when Natalie pleaded with me.\r\n\r\n\"I had forgotten,\" he said, \"the issue now lies in your hands. Choose\r\nrightly. Choose mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" I answered shortly, for his request brought me back with a\r\njerk to his motive.\r\n\r\n\"Then you will get me well as soon as your skill can do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will keep you in your present condition until I have your most solemn\r\nassurance that you will neither go farther yourself nor instigate others\r\nto go farther with this preposterous scheme of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" Brande ejaculated contemptuously, and lay back with a sudden\r\ncontent. \"My brain is certainly out of order, else I should not have\r\nforgotten--until your words recalled it--the Labrador expedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Labrador expedition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. On the day we sailed for the Arafura Sea, Grey started with\r\nanother party for Labrador. If we fail to act before the 31st December,\r\nin the year 1900, he will proceed. And the end of the century will be\r\nthe date of the end of the earth. I will signal to him now.\"\r\n\r\nHis face changed suddenly. For a moment I thought he was dead. Then the\r\ndreadful fact came home to me. He was telegraphing telepathically to\r\nGrey. So the murder that was upon my soul had been done in vain. Then\r\nanother life must be taken. Better a double crime than one resultless\r\ntragedy. I was spared this.\r\n\r\nBrande opened his eyes wearily, and sighed as if fatigued. The effort,\r\nshort as it was, must have been intense. He was prostrated. His voice\r\nwas low, almost a whisper, as he said:\r\n\r\n\"You have succeeded beyond belief. I cannot even signal him, much less\r\nexchange ideas.\" With that he turned his face from me, and instantly\r\nfell into a deep sleep.\r\n\r\nI left the cabin and went on deck. As usual, it was fairly sprinkled\r\nover with the passengers, but owing to the strong head-wind caused by\r\nthe speed of the steamer, there was a little nook in the bow where there\r\nwas no one to trouble me with unwelcome company.\r\n\r\nI sat down on an arm of the starboard anchor and tried to think. The\r\ngame which seemed so nearly won had all to be played over again from the\r\nfirst move. If I had killed Brande--which surely would have been\r\njustifiable--the other expedition would go on from where he left off.\r\nAnd how should I find them? And who would believe my story when I got\r\nback to England?\r\n\r\nBrande must go on. His attempt to wreck the earth, even if the power he\r\nclaimed were not overrated, would fail. For if the compounds of a common\r\nexplosive must be so nicely balanced as they require to be, surely the\r\naddition of the figures which I had made in his formula would upset the\r\nbalance of constituents in an agent so delicate, though so powerful, as\r\nthat which he had invented. When the master failed, it was more than\r\nprobable that the pupil would distrust the invention, and return to\r\nLondon for fresh experiments. Then a clean sweep must be made of the\r\nwhole party. Meantime, it was plain that Brande must be allowed the\r\nopportunity of failing. And this it would be my hazardous duty to\r\nsuperintend.\r\n\r\nI returned to Brande's cabin with my mind made up. He was awake, and\r\nlooked at me eagerly, but waited for me to speak. Our conversation was\r\nbrief, for I had little sympathy with my patient, and the only anxiety I\r\nexperienced about his health was the hope that he would not die until\r\nhe had served my purpose.\r\n\r\n\"I have decided to get you up,\" I said curtly.\r\n\r\n\"You have decided well,\" he answered, with equal coldness.\r\n\r\nThat was the whole interview--on which so much depended.\r\n\r\nAfter this I did not speak to Brande on any subject but that of his\r\nsymptoms, and before long he was able to come on deck. The month I spoke\r\nof as the duration of his illness was an intentional exaggeration on my\r\npart.\r\n\r\nRockingham was forgotten with a suddenness and completeness that was\r\nalmost ghastly. The Society claimed to have improved the old maxim to\r\nspeak nothing of the dead save what is good. Of the dead they spoke not\r\nat all. It is a callous creed, but in this instance it pleased me well.\r\n\r\nWe did not touch at Aden, and I was glad of it. The few attractions of\r\nthe place, the diving boys and the like, may be a relief in ordinary sea\r\nvoyages, but I was too much absorbed in my experiment on Brande to bear\r\nwith patience any delay which served to postpone the crisis of my\r\nscheme. I had treated him well, so far as his bodily health went, but I\r\ndeliberately continued to tamper with his brain, so that any return of\r\nhis telepathic power was thus prevented. Indeed, Brande himself was not\r\nanxious for such return. The power was always exercised at an extreme\r\nnervous strain, and it was now, he said, unnecessary to his purpose.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this determination, I modified the already minute\r\ndoses of the drug I was giving him. This soon told with advantage on his\r\nhealth. His physical improvement partly restored his confidence in me,\r\nso that he followed my instructions faithfully. He evidently recognised\r\nthat he was in my power; that if I did not choose to restore him fully\r\nno other man could.\r\n\r\nOf the ship's officers, Anderson, who was in command, and Percival, the\r\ndoctor, were men of some individuality. The captain was a good sailor\r\nand an excellent man of business. In the first capacity, he was firm,\r\nexacting, and scrupulously conscientious. In the second, his conscience\r\nwas more elastic when he saw his way clear to his own advantage. He had\r\ncertain rigid rules of conduct which he prided himself on observing to\r\nthe letter, without for a moment suspecting that their _raison d'etre_\r\nlay in his own interests. His commercial morality only required him to\r\nkeep within the law. His final contract with myself was, I admit,\r\nfaithfully carried out, but the terms of it would not have discredited\r\nthe most predatory business man in London town.\r\n\r\nPercival was the opposite pole of such a character. He was a clever man,\r\nwho might have risen in his profession but for his easy-going indolence.\r\nI spent many an hour in his cabin. He was a sportsman and a skilled\r\n_raconteur_. His anecdotes helped to while the weary time away. He\r\nexaggerated persistently, but this did not disturb me. Besides, if in\r\nhis narratives he lengthened out the hunt a dozen miles and increased\r\nthe weight of the fish to an impossible figure, made the brace a dozen\r\nand the ten-ton boat a man-of-war, it was not because he was\r\ndeliberately untruthful. He looked back on his feats through the\r\ntelescope of a strongly magnifying memory. It was more agreeable to me\r\nto hear him boast his prowess than have him inquire after the health and\r\ntreatment of my patient Brande. On this matter he was naturally very\r\ncurious, and I very reticent.\r\n\r\nThat Brande did not entirely trust me was evident from his confusion\r\nwhen I surprised him once reading his formula. His anxiety to convince\r\nme that it was only a commonplace memorandum was almost ludicrous. I was\r\nglad to see him anxious about that document. The more carefully he\r\npreserved it, and the more faithfully he adhered to its conditions, the\r\nbetter for my experiment. A sense of security followed this incident. It\r\ndid not last long. It ended that evening.\r\n\r\nAfter a day of almost unendurable heat, I went on deck for a breath of\r\nair. We were well out in the Indian Ocean, and soundings were being\r\nattempted by some of our naturalists. I sat alone and watched the sun\r\nsink down into the glassy ocean on which our rushing vessel was the only\r\nthing that moved. As the darkness of that hot, still night gathered,\r\nweird gleams of phosphorus broke from the steamer's bows and streamed\r\naway behind us in long lines of flashing spangles. Where the swell\r\ncaused by the passage of the ship rose in curling waves, these, as they\r\nsplashed into mimic breakers, burst into showers of flamboyant light.\r\nThe water from the discharge-pipe poured down in a cascade, that shone\r\nlike silver. Every turn of the screw dashed a thousand flashes on either\r\nside, and the heaving of the lead was like the flight of a meteor, as it\r\nplunged with a luminous trail far down into the dark unfathomable depths\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nMy name was spoken softly. Natalie Brande stood beside me. The spell was\r\ncomplete. The unearthly glamour of the magical scene had been compassed\r\nby her. She had called it forth and could disperse it by an effort of\r\nher will. I wrenched my mind free from the foolish phantasmagoria.\r\n\r\n\"I have good news,\" Natalie said in a low voice. Her tones were soft,\r\nmusical; her manner caressing. Happiness was in her whole bearing,\r\ntenderness in her eyes. Dread oppressed me. \"Herbert is now well again.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has been well for some time,\" I said, my heart beating fast.\r\n\r\n\"He is not thoroughly restored even yet. But this evening he was able to\r\nreceive a message from me by the thought waves. He thinks you are\r\nplotting injury to him. His brain is not yet sufficiently strong to show\r\nhow foolish this fugitive fancy is. Perhaps you would go to him. He is\r\ntroubling himself over this. You can set his mind at rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can--and will--if I am not too late,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n£5000 TO DETAIN THE SHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrande was asleep when I entered his cabin. His writing-table was\r\ncovered with scraps of paper on which he had been scribbling. My name\r\nwas on every scrap, preceded or followed by an unfinished sentence,\r\nthus: \"Marcel is thinking-- When I was ill, Marcel thought-- Marcel\r\nmeans to--\" All these I gathered up carefully and put in my pocket. Then\r\nI inoculated him with as strong a solution of the drug I was using on\r\nhim as was compatible with the safety of his life. Immediate danger\r\nbeing thus averted, I determined to run no similar risk again.\r\n\r\nFor many days after this our voyage was monotonous. The deadly secret\r\nshared by Edith Metford and myself drew us gradually nearer to each\r\nother as time passed. She understood me, or, at least, gave me the\r\nimpression that she understood me. Little by little that capricious mood\r\nwhich I have heretofore described changed into one of enduring\r\nsympathy. With one trivial exception, this lasted until the end. But for\r\nher help my mind would hardly have stood the strain of events which were\r\nnow at hand, whose livid shadows were projected in the rising fire of\r\nBrande's relentless eyes.\r\n\r\nBrande appeared to lose interest gradually in his ship's company. He\r\nbecame daily more and more absorbed in his own thoughts. Natalie was\r\never gentle, even tender. But I chafed at the impalpable barrier which\r\nwas always between us. Sometimes I thought that she would willingly have\r\nranged herself on my side. Some hidden power held her back. As to the\r\nothers, I began to like the boy Halley. He was lovable, if not athletic.\r\nHis devotion to Natalie, which never waned, did not now trouble me. It\r\nwas only a friendship, and I welcomed it. Had it been anything more, it\r\nwas not likely that he would have prevailed against the will of a man\r\nwho had done murder for his mistress. We steamed through the Malay\r\nArchipelago, steering north, south, east, west, as if at haphazard,\r\nuntil only the navigating officers and the director of the Society knew\r\nhow our course lay. We were searching for an island about the bearings\r\nof which, it transpired, some mistake had been made. I do not know\r\nwhether the great laureate ever sailed these seas. But I know that his\r\nglorious islands of flowers and islands of fruit, with all their\r\nluscious imagery, were here eclipsed by our own islands of foliage. The\r\nlong lagoons, the deep blue bays, the glittering parti-coloured fish\r\nthat swam in visible shoals deep down amidst the submerged coral groves\r\nover which we passed, the rich-toned sea-weeds and brilliant anemones,\r\nthe yellow strands and the steep cliffs, the riotous foliage that swept\r\ndown from the sky to the blue of the sea; all these natural beauties\r\nseemed to cry to me with living voices--to me bound on a cruise of\r\nuniversal death.\r\n\r\nAfter a long spell of apparently aimless but glorious steaming, a small\r\nisland was sighted on our port bow. The _Esmeralda_ was steered directly\r\nfor it, and we dropped anchor in a deep natural harbour on its southern\r\nshore. Preparations for landing had been going on during the day, and\r\neverything was ready for quitting the ship.\r\n\r\nIt was here that my first opportunity for making use of the gold I had\r\nbrought with me occurred. Anderson was called up by Brande, who made\r\nhim a short complimentary speech, and finished it by ordering his\r\nofficer to return to England, where further instructions would be given\r\nhim. This order was received in respectful silence. Captain Anderson had\r\nbeen too liberally treated to demur if the _Esmeralda_ had been ordered\r\nto the South Pole.\r\n\r\nBrande went below for a few minutes, and as soon as he had disappeared I\r\nwent forward to Anderson and hailed him nervously, for there was not a\r\nmoment to spare.\r\n\r\n\"Anderson,\" I said hurriedly, \"you must have noticed that Mr. Brande is\r\nan eccentric--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sir; it is not my business to comment upon my owner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not ask you to comment upon him, sir,\" I said sharply. \"It is I\r\nwho shall comment upon him, and it is for you to say whether you will\r\nundertake to earn my money by waiting in this harbour till I am ready to\r\nsail back with you to England.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you anything more to say, sir?\" Anderson asked stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"I presume I have said enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have nothing more to say I must ask you to leave the bridge,\r\nand if it were not that you are leaving the ship this moment, I would\r\ncaution you not to be impertinent to me again.\"\r\n\r\nHe blew his whistle, and a steward ran forward.\r\n\r\n\"Johnson, see Mr. Marcel's luggage over the side at once.\" To me he said\r\nshortly: \"Quit my ship, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThis trivial show of temper, which, indeed, had been provoked by my own\r\nhasty speech, turned my impatience into fury.\r\n\r\n\"Before I quit your ship,\" I said, with emphasis, \"I will tell you how\r\nyou yourself will quit it. You will do so between two policemen if you\r\nland in England, and between two marines if you think of keeping on the\r\nhigh seas. Before we started, I sent a detailed statement of this ship,\r\nthe nature of this nefarious voyage, and the names of the passengers--or\r\nas many as I knew--to a friend who will put it in proper hands if\r\nanything befalls me. Go back without me and explain the loss of that\r\nFrench fishing fleet which was sunk the very night we sailed. It is an\r\nawkward coincidence to be explained by a man who returns from an unknown\r\nvoyage having lost his entire list of passengers. You cannot be aware\r\nof what this man Brande intends, or you would at least stand by us as\r\nlong as your own safety permitted. In any case you cannot safely return\r\nwithout us.\"\r\n\r\nAnderson, after reflecting for a moment, apologised for his peremptory\r\nwords, and agreed to stand by night and day, with fires banked, until I,\r\nand all whom I could prevail upon to return with me, got back to his\r\nvessel. There was no danger of his running short of coal. A ship that\r\nwas practically an ocean liner in coal ballast would be a considerable\r\ntime in burning out her own cargo. But he insisted on a large money\r\npayment in advance. I had foolishly mentioned that I had a little over\r\n£5000 in gold. This he claimed on the plea that \"in duty to himself\"--a\r\nfavourite phrase of his--he could not accept less. But I think his sense\r\nof duty was limited only by the fact that I had hardly another penny in\r\nthe world. Under the circumstances he might have waived all\r\nremuneration. As he was firm, and as I had no time to haggle, I agreed\r\nto give him the money. Our bargain was only completed when Brande\r\nreturned to the deck.\r\n\r\nIt was strange that on an island like that on which we were landing\r\nthere should be a regular army of natives waiting to assist us with our\r\nbaggage, and the saddled horses which were in readiness were out of\r\nplace in a primeval wilderness. An Englishman came forward, and,\r\nsaluting Brande, said all was ready for the start to the hills. This\r\nexplained the puzzle. An advance agent had made everything comfortable.\r\nFor Brande, his sister, and Miss Metford the best appointed horses were\r\nselected. I, as physician to the chief, had one. The main body had to\r\nmake the journey on foot, which they did by very easy stages, owing to\r\nthe heat and the primitive track which formed the only road. Their\r\njourney was not very long--perhaps ten miles in a direct line.\r\n\r\nMounted as we were, it was often necessary to stoop to escape the dense\r\nmasses of parasitic growth which hung in green festoons from every\r\nbranch of the trees on either side. Under this thick shade all the\r\nriotous vegetation of the tropics had fought for life and struggled for\r\nlight and air till the wealth of their luxuriant death had carpeted the\r\nunderwood with a thick deposit of steaming foliage. As we ascended the\r\nheight, every mile in distance brought changes in the botanical\r\ngrowths, which might have passed unnoticed by the ordinary observer or\r\nignorant pioneer. All were noted and commented on by Brande, whose eye\r\nwas still as keen as his brain had once been brilliant. His usual staid\r\ndemeanour changed suddenly. He romped ahead of us like a schoolboy out\r\nfor a holiday. Unlike a schoolboy, however, he was always seeking new\r\nitems of knowledge and conveying them to us with unaffected pleasure. He\r\nwas more like a master who had found new ground and new material for his\r\nclass. Natalie gave herself up like him to this enjoyment of the moment.\r\nEdith Metford and I partly caught the glamour of their infectious\r\ngood-humour. But with both of us it was tempered by the knowledge of\r\nwhat was in store.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at our destination we dismounted, at Brande's request,\r\nand tied our horses to convenient branches. He went forward, and,\r\npushing aside the underwood with both hands, motioned to us to follow\r\nhim till he stopped on a ledge of rock which overtopped a hollow in the\r\nmountain. The gorge below was the most beautiful glade I ever looked\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nIt was a paradise of foliage. Here and there a fallen tree had formed a\r\npicturesque bridge over the mountain stream which meandered through it.\r\nFar down below there was a waterfall, where gorgeous tree-ferns rose in\r\nnatural bowers, while others further still leant over the lotus-covered\r\nstream, their giant leaves trailing in the slow-moving current. Tangled\r\nmasses of bracken rioted in wild abundance over a velvety green sod,\r\novershadowed by waving magnolias. Through the trees bright-plumaged\r\nbirds were flitting from branch to branch in songless flight, flashing\r\ntheir brilliant colours through the sunny leaves. In places the water\r\nsplashed over moss-grown rocks into deep pools. Every drifting spray of\r\ncloud threw over the dell a new light, deepening the shadows under the\r\ngreat ferns.\r\n\r\nIt was here in this glorious fairyland; here upon this island, where\r\nbefore us no white foot had ever trod; whose nameless people represented\r\nthe simplest types of human existence, that Herbert Brande was to put\r\nhis devilish experiment to the proof. I marvelled that he should have\r\nselected so fair a spot for so terrible a purpose. But the papers which\r\nI found later amongst the man's effects on the _Esmeralda_ explain much\r\nthat was then incomprehensible to me.\r\n\r\nOur camp was quickly formed, and our life was outwardly as happy as if\r\nwe had been an ordinary company of tourists. I say outwardly, because,\r\nwhile we walked and climbed and collected specimens of botanical or\r\ngeological interest, there remained that latent dread which always\r\nfollowed us, and dominated the most frivolous of our people, on all of\r\nwhom a new solemnity had fallen. For myself, the fact that the hour of\r\ntrial for my own experiment was daily drawing closer and more\r\ninevitable, was sufficient to account for my constant and extreme\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nBrande joined none of our excursions. He was always at work in his\r\nimprovised laboratory. The boxes of material which had been brought from\r\nthe ship nearly filled it from floor to roof, and from the speed with\r\nwhich these were emptied, it was evident that their contents had been\r\nsystematised before shipment. In place of the varied collection of\r\nsubstances there grew up within the room a cone of compound matter in\r\nwhich all were blended. This cone was smaller, Brande admitted, than\r\nwhat he had intended. The supply of subordinate fulminates, though\r\nseveral times greater than what was required, proved to be considerably\r\nshort. But as he had allowed himself a large margin--everything being\r\non a scale far exceeding the minimum which his calculations had pointed\r\nto as sufficient--this deficiency did not cause him more than a\r\ntemporary annoyance. So he worked on.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been three weeks on the island I found the suspense greater\r\nthan I could bear. The crisis was at hand, and my heart failed me. I\r\ndetermined to make a last appeal to Natalie, to fly with me to the ship.\r\nEdith Metford would accompany us. The rest might take the risk to which\r\nthey had consented.\r\n\r\nI found Natalie standing on the high rock whence the most lovely view of\r\nthe dell could be obtained, and as I approached her silently she was not\r\naware of my presence until I laid my hand on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Natalie,\" I said wistfully, for the girl's eyes were full of tears, \"do\r\nyou mind if I withdraw now from this enterprise, in which I cannot be of\r\nthe slightest use, and of which I most heartily disapprove?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Society would not allow you to withdraw. You cannot do so without\r\nits permission, and hope to live within a thousand miles of it,\" she\r\nanswered gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I should not care to live within ten thousand miles of it. I should try\r\nto get and keep the earth's diameter between myself and it.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up with an expression of such pain that my heart smote me.\r\n\"How about me? I cannot live without you now,\" she said softly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't live without me. Come with me. Get rid of this infamous\r\nassociation of lunatics, whose object they themselves cannot really\r\nappreciate, and whose means are murder--\"\r\n\r\nBut there she stopped me. \"My brother could find me out at the uttermost\r\nends of the earth if I forsook him, and you know I do not mean to\r\nforsake him. For yourself--do not try to desert. It would make no\r\ndifference. Do not believe that any consideration would cause me\r\nwillingly to give you a moment's pain, or that I should shrink from\r\nsacrificing myself to save you.\" With one of her small white hands she\r\ngently pressed my head towards her. Her lips touched my forehead, and\r\nshe whispered: \"Do not leave me. It will soon be over now. I--I--need\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAs I was returning dejected after my fruitless appeal to Natalie, I met\r\nEdith Metford, to whom I had unhappily mentioned my proposal for an\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\"Is it arranged? When do we start?\" she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"It is not arranged, and we do not start,\" I answered in despair.\r\n\r\n\"You told me you would go with her or without her,\" she cried\r\npassionately. \"It is shameful--unmanly.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly both if I really said what you tell me. I was not\r\nmyself at the moment, and my tongue must have slandered me. I stay to\r\nthe end. But you will go. Captain Anderson will receive you--\"\r\n\r\n\"How am I to be certain of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I paid him for your passage, and have his receipt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you really think I would go and leave--leave--\"\r\n\r\n\"Natalie? I think you would be perfectly justified.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the girl stamped her foot passionately on the ground and burst\r\ninto tears. Nor would she permit any of the slight caresses I offered.\r\nI thought her old caprices were returning. She flung my arm rudely from\r\nher and left me bewildered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\"THIS EARTH SHALL DIE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMy memory does not serve me well in the scenes which immediately\r\npreceded the closing of the drama in which Brande was chief actor. It is\r\ndoubtless the transcendental interest of the final situation which\r\nblunts my recollection of what occurred shortly before it. I did not\r\nabate one jot of my determination to fight my venture out unflinching,\r\nbut my actions were probably more automatic than reasoned, as the time\r\nof our last encounter approached. On the whole, the fight had been a\r\nfair one. Brande had used his advantage over me for his own purpose as\r\nlong as it remained with him. I used the advantage as soon as it passed\r\nto me for mine. The conditions had thus been equalised when, for the\r\nthird and last time, I was to hear him address his Society.\r\n\r\nThis time the man was weak in health. His vitality was ebbing fast, but\r\nhis marvellous inspiration was strong within him, and, supported by it,\r\nhe battled manfully with the disease which I had manufactured for him.\r\nHis lecture-room was the fairy glen; his canopy the heavens.\r\n\r\nI cannot give the substance of this address, or any portion of it,\r\nverbatim as on former occasions, for I have not the manuscript. I doubt\r\nif Brande wrote out his last speech. Methodical as were his habits it is\r\nprobable that his final words were not premeditated. They burst from him\r\nin a delirium that could hardly have been studied. His fine frenzy could\r\nnot well have originated from considered sentences, although his\r\nlanguage, regarded as mere oratory, was magnificent. It was appalling in\r\nthe light through which I read it.\r\n\r\nHe stood alone upon the rock which overtopped the dell. We arranged\r\nourselves in such groups as suited our inclinations, upon some rising\r\nground below. The great trees waved overhead, low murmuring. The\r\nwaterfall splashed drearily. Below, not a whisper was exchanged. Above,\r\nthe man poured out his triumphant death-song in sonorous periods.\r\nBelow, great fear was upon all. Above, the madman exulted wildly.\r\n\r\nAt first his voice was weak. As he went on it gained strength and depth.\r\nHe alluded to his first address, in which he had hinted that the\r\nmaterial Universe was not quite a success; to his second, in which he\r\nhad boldly declared it was an absolute failure. This, his third\r\ndeclaration, was to tell us that the remedy as far as he, a mortal man,\r\ncould apply it, was ready. The end was at hand. That night should see\r\nthe consummation of his life-work. To-morrow's sun would rise--if it\r\nrose at all--on the earth restored to space.\r\n\r\nA shiver passed perceptibly over the people, prepared as they were for\r\nthis long foreseen announcement. Edith Metford, who stood by me on my\r\nleft, slipped her hand into mine and pressed my fingers hard. Natalie\r\nBrande, on my right, did not move. Her eyes were dilated and fixed on\r\nthe speaker. The old clairvoyante look was on her face. Her dark pupils\r\nwere blinded save to their inward light. She was either unconscious or\r\nonly partly conscious. Now that the hour had come, they who had believed\r\ntheir courage secure felt it wither. They, the people with us, begged\r\nfor a little longer time to brace themselves for the great crisis--the\r\nplunge into an eternity from which there would be no resurrection,\r\nneither of matter nor of mind.\r\n\r\nBrande heeded them not.\r\n\r\n\"This night,\" said he, with culminating enthusiasm, \"the cloud-capped\r\ntowers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, shall dissolve. To\r\nthis great globe itself--this paltry speck of less account in space than\r\na dew-drop in an ocean--and all its sorrow and pain, its trials and\r\ntemptations, all the pathos and bathos of our tragic human farce, the\r\nend is near. The way has been hard, and the journey overlong, and the\r\nburden often beyond man's strength. But that long-drawn sorrow now shall\r\ncease. The tears will be wiped away. The burden will fall from weary\r\nshoulders. For the fulness of time has come. This earth shall die! And\r\ndeath is peace.\r\n\r\n\"I stand,\" he cried out in a strident voice, raising his arm aloft, \"I\r\nmay say, with one foot on sea and one on land, for I hold the elemental\r\nsecret of them both. And I swear by the living god--Science\r\nincarnate--that the suffering of the centuries is over, that for this\r\nearth and all that it contains, from this night and for ever, _Time\r\nwill be no more!_\"\r\n\r\nA great cry rose from the people. \"Give us another day--only another\r\nday!\"\r\n\r\nBut Brande made answer: \"It is now too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late!\" the people wailed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, too late. I warned you long ago. Are you not yet ready? In two\r\nhours the disintegrating agent will enter on its work. No human power\r\ncould stop it now. Not if every particle of the material I have\r\ncompounded were separated and scattered to the winds. Before I set my\r\nfoot upon this rock I applied the key which will release its inherent\r\nenergy. I myself am powerless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Powerless,\" sobbed the auditors.\r\n\r\n\"Powerless! And if I had ten thousand times the power which I have\r\ncalled forth from the universal element, I would use it towards the\r\nissue I have forecast.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon he turned away. Doom sounded in his words. The hand of Death\r\nlaid clammy fingers on us. Edith Metford's strength failed at last. It\r\nhad been sorely tested. She sank into my arms.\r\n\r\n\"Courage, true heart, our time has come,\" I whispered. \"We start for the\r\nsteamer at once. The horses are ready.\" My arrangements had been already\r\nmade. My plan had been as carefully matured as any ever made by Brande\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"How many horses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three. One for you; another for Natalie; the third for myself. The rest\r\nmust accept the fate they have selected.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl shuddered as she said, \"But your interference with the formula?\r\nYou are sure it will destroy the effect?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am certain that the particular result on which Brande calculates will\r\nnot take place. But short of that, he has still enough explosive matter\r\nstored to cause an earthquake. We are not safe within a radius of fifty\r\nmiles. It will be a race against time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Natalie will not come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not voluntarily. You must think of some plan. Your brain is quick. We\r\nhave not a moment to lose. Ah, there she is! Speak to her.\"\r\n\r\nNatalie was crossing the open ground which led from the glen to Brande's\r\nlaboratory. She did not observe us till Edith called to her. Then she\r\napproached hastily and embraced her friend with visible emotion. Even to\r\nme she offered her cheek without reserve.\r\n\r\n\"Natalie,\" I said quickly, \"there are three horses saddled and waiting\r\nin the palm grove. The _Esmeralda_ is still lying in the harbour where\r\nwe landed. You will come with us. Indeed, you have no choice. You must\r\ncome if I have to carry you to your horse and tie you to the saddle. You\r\nwill not force me to put that indignity upon you. To the horses, then!\r\nCome!\"\r\n\r\nFor answer she called her brother loudly by his name. Brande immediately\r\nappeared at the door of his laboratory, and when he perceived from whom\r\nthe call had come he joined us.\r\n\r\n\"Herbert,\" said Natalie, \"our friend is deserting us. He must still\r\ncling to the thought that your purpose may fail, and he expects to\r\nescape on horseback from the fate of the earth. Reason with him yet a\r\nlittle further.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no time to reason,\" I interrupted. \"The horses are ready. This\r\ngirl (pointing as I spoke to Edith Metford) takes one, I another, and\r\nyou the third--whether your brother agrees or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you have not lost your reason? Have you forgotten the drop of\r\nwater in the English Channel?\" Brande said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Brande,\" I answered, \"the sooner you induce your sister to come with me\r\nthe better; and the sooner you induce these maniac friends of yours to\r\nclear out the better, for your enterprise will fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is as certain as the law of gravitation. With my own hand I mixed\r\nthe ingredients according to the formula.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" said I, \"with my own hand I altered your formula.\"\r\n\r\nHad Brande's heart stopped beating, his face could not have become more\r\ndistorted and livid. He moved close to me, and, glaring into my eyes,\r\nhissed out:\r\n\r\n\"You altered my formula?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" I answered recklessly. \"I multiplied your figures by ten where\r\nthey struck me as insufficient.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\nI strode closer still to him and looked him straight in the eyes while I\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"That night in the Red Sea, when Edith Metford, by accident, mixed\r\nmorphia in your medicine. The night I injected a subtle poison, which I\r\npicked up in India once, into your blood while you slept, thereby\r\nbaffling some of the functions of your extraordinary brain. The night\r\nwhen in your sleep you stirred once, and had you stirred twice, I would\r\nhave killed you, then and there, as ruthlessly as you would kill mankind\r\nnow. The night I did kill your lieutenant, Rockingham, and throw his\r\nbody overboard to the sharks.\"\r\n\r\nBrande did not speak for a moment. Then he said in a gentle,\r\nuncomplaining voice:\r\n\r\n\"So it now devolves on Grey. The end will be the same. The Labrador\r\nexpedition will succeed where I have failed.\" To Natalie: \"You had\r\nbetter go. There will only be an explosion. The island will probably\r\ndisappear. That will be all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remain?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I perish with my failure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I perish with you. And you, Marcel, save yourself--you coward!\"\r\n\r\nI started as if struck in the face. Then I said to Edith: \"Be careful to\r\nkeep to the track. Take the bay horse. I saddled him for myself, but you\r\ncan ride him safely. Lose no time, and ride hard for the coast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arthur Marcel,\" she answered, so softly that the others did not hear,\r\n\"your work in the world is not yet over. There is the Labrador\r\nexpedition. Just now, when my strength failed, you whispered 'courage.'\r\nBe true to yourself! Half an hour is gone.\"\r\n\r\nAt length some glimmer of human feeling awoke in Brande. He said in a\r\nlow, abstracted voice: \"My life fittingly ends now. To keep you,\r\nNatalie, would only be a vulgar murder.\" The old will power seemed to\r\ncome back to him. He looked into the girl's eyes, and said slowly and\r\nsternly: \"Go! I command it.\"\r\n\r\nWithout another word he turned away from us. When he had disappeared\r\ninto the laboratory, Natalie sighed, and said dreamily:\r\n\r\n\"I am ready. Let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI led the girls hurriedly to the horses. When they were mounted on the\r\nponies, I gave the bridle-reins of the bay horse--whose size and\r\nstrength were necessary for my extra weight--to Edith Metford, and asked\r\nher to wait for me until I announced Brande's probable failure to the\r\npeople, and advised a _sauve qui peut_.\r\n\r\nHard upon my warning there followed a strange metamorphosis in the\r\ncrowd, who, after the passing weakness at the lecture, had fallen back\r\ninto stoical indifference, or it may have been despair. The possibility\r\nof escape galvanized them into the desire for life. Cries of distress,\r\nand prayers for help, filled the air. Men and women rushed about like\r\nfrightened sheep without concert or any sensible effort to escape,\r\nwasting in futile scrambles the short time remaining to them. For\r\nanother half hour had now passed, and in sixty minutes the earthquake\r\nwould take place.\r\n\r\n\"Follow us!\" I shouted, as with my companions I rode slowly through the\r\ncamp. \"Keep the track to the sea. I shall have the steamer's boats ready\r\nfor all who may reach the shore alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"The horses! Seize the horses!\" rose in a loud shout, and the mob flung\r\nthemselves upon us, as though three animals could carry all.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the rush, I called out: \"Sit firm, Natalie; I am going to\r\nstrike your horse.\" Saying which I struck the pony a sharp blow with my\r\nriding-whip crossways on the flank. It bounded like a deer, and then\r\ndashed forward down the rough pathway.\r\n\r\n\"Now you, Edith!\" I struck her pony in the same way; but it only reared\r\nand nearly threw her. It could not get away. Already hands were upon\r\nboth bridle-reins. There was no help for it. I pulled out my revolver\r\nand fired once, twice, and thrice--for I missed the second shot--and\r\nthen the maddened animal sprang forward, released from the hands that\r\nheld it.\r\n\r\nIt was now time to look to myself. I was in the midst of a dozen maniacs\r\nmad with fear. I kicked in my spurs desperately, and the bay lashed out\r\nhis hind feet. One hoof struck young Halley on the forehead. He fell\r\nback dead, his skull in fragments. But the others refused to break the\r\ncircle. Then I emptied my weapon on them, and my horse plunged through\r\nthe opening, followed by despairing execrations. The moment I was clear,\r\nI returned my revolver to its case, and settled myself in the saddle,\r\nfor, borne out of the proper path as I had been, there was a stiff bank\r\nto leap before I could regain the track to the shore. Owing to the\r\ndarkness the horse refused to leap, and I nearly fell over his head.\r\nWith a little scrambling I managed to get back into my seat, and then\r\ntrotted along the bank for a hundred yards. At this point the bank\r\ndisappeared, and there was nothing between me now and the open track to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nOnce upon the path, I put the bay to a gallop, and very soon overtook a\r\nman and a woman hurrying on. They were running hand in hand, the man a\r\nlittle in front dragging his companion on by force. It was plain to me\r\nthat the woman could not hold out much longer. The man, Claude Lureau,\r\nhailed me as I passed.\r\n\r\n\"Help us, Marcel. Don't ride away from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot save both,\" I answered, pulling up.\r\n\r\n\"Then save Mademoiselle Véret. I'll take my chance.\"\r\n\r\nThis blunt speech moved me, the more especially as the man was French. I\r\ncould not allow him to point the way of duty to me--an Englishman.\r\n\r\n\"Assist her up, then. Now, Mademoiselle, put your arms round me and hold\r\nhard for your life. Lureau, you may hold my stirrup if you agree to\r\nloose it when you tire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so,\" he promised.\r\n\r\nHampered thus, I but slowly gained on Natalie and Edith, whose ponies\r\nhad galloped a mile before they could be stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Forward, forward!\" I shouted when within hail. \"Don't wait for me. Ride\r\non at top speed. Lash your ponies with the bridle-reins.\"\r\n\r\nWe were all moving on now at an easy canter, for I could not go fast so\r\nlong as Lureau held my stirrup, and the girls in front did not seem\r\nanxious to leave me far behind. Besides, the tangled underwood and\r\noverhanging creepers rendered hard riding both difficult and dangerous.\r\nThe ponies were hard held, but notwithstanding this my horse fell back\r\ngradually in the race, and the hammering of the hoofs in front grew\r\nfainter. The breath of the runner at my stirrup came in great sobs. He\r\nwas suffocating, but he struggled on a little longer. Then he threw up\r\nhis hand and gasped:\r\n\r\n\"I am done. Go on, Marcel. You deserve to escape. Don't desert the\r\ngirl.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God desert me if I do,\" I answered. \"And do you keep on as long as\r\nyou can. You may reach the shore after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on--save her!\" he gasped, and then from sheer exhaustion fell\r\nforward on his face.\r\n\r\n\"Sit still, Mademoiselle,\" I cried, pulling the French girl's arms round\r\nme in time to prevent her from throwing herself purposely from the\r\nhorse. Then I drove in my spurs hard, and, being now released from\r\nLureau's grasp, I overtook the ponies.\r\n\r\nFor five minutes we all rode on abreast. And then the darkness began to\r\nbreak, and a strange dawn glimmered over the tree-tops, although the\r\nhour of midnight was still to come. A wild, red light, like that of a\r\nfiery sunset in a hazy summer evening, spread over the night sky. The\r\nquivering stars grew pale. Constellation after constellation, they were\r\nblotted out until the whole arc of heaven was a dull red glare. The\r\nhorses were dismayed by this strange phenomenon, and dashed the froth\r\nfrom their foaming muzzles as they galloped now without stress of spur\r\nat their best speed. Birds that could not sing found voice, and\r\nchattered and shrieked as they dashed from tree to tree in aimless\r\nflight. Enormous bats hurtled in the air, blinded by the unusual light.\r\nFrom the dense undergrowth strange denizens of the woods, disturbed in\r\ntheir nightly prowl, leaped forth and scurried squealing between the\r\ngalloping hoofs, reckless of anything save their own fear. Everything\r\nthat was alive upon the island was in motion, and fear was the motor of\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nSo far, we saw no natives. Their absence did not surprise me, for I had\r\nno time for thought. It was explained later.\r\n\r\nEdith Metford's pony soon became unmanageable in its fright. I unbuckled\r\none spur and gave it to her, directing her to hold it in her hand, for\r\nof course she could not strap it to her boot, and drive it into the\r\nanimal when he swerved. She took the spur, and as her pony, in one of\r\nhis side leaps, nearly bounded off the path, she struck him hard on the\r\nribs. He bolted and flew on far ahead of us.\r\n\r\nThe light grew stronger.\r\n\r\nBut that the rays were red, it would now have been as bright as day. We\r\nwere chasing our shadows, so the light must be directly behind us.\r\nMademoiselle Véret first noticed this, and drew my attention to it. I\r\nlooked back, and my heart sank at the sight. In the terror it inspired,\r\nI regretted having burthened myself with the girl I had sworn to save.\r\n\r\nThe island was on fire!\r\n\r\n\"It is the end of the world,\" Mademoiselle Véret said with a shudder.\r\nShe clung closer to me. I could feel her warm breath upon my cheek. The\r\nunmanly regret, which for a moment had touched me, passed.\r\n\r\nThe ponies now seemed to find out that their safety lay in galloping\r\nstraight on, rather than in scared leaps from side to side. They\r\nstretched themselves like race horses, and gave my bay, with his double\r\nburthen, a strong lead. The pace became terrible considering the nature\r\nof the ground we covered.\r\n\r\nAt last the harbour came in view. But my horse, I knew, could not last\r\nanother mile, and the shore was still distant two or three. I spurred\r\nhim hard and drew nearly level with the ponies, so that my voice could\r\nbe heard by both their riders.\r\n\r\n\"Ride on,\" I shouted, \"and hail the steamer, so that there may be no\r\ndelay when I come up. This horse is blown, and will not stand the pace.\r\nI am going to ease him. You will go on board at once, and send the boat\r\nback for us.\" Then I eased the bay, but in spite of this I immediately\r\novertook Edith Metford, who had pulled up.\r\n\r\nMy reproaches she cut short by saying, \"If that horse does the distance\r\nat all it will be by getting a lead all the way. And I am going to give\r\nit to him.\" So we started together.\r\n\r\nNatalie was waiting for us a little further on. I spoke to her, but she\r\ndid not answer. From the moment that Brande had commanded her to\r\naccompany us, her manner had remained absolutely passive. What I\r\nordered, she obeyed. That was all. Instead of being alarmed by the\r\nhorrors of the ride, she did not seem to be even interested. I had not\r\nleisure, however, to reflect on this. For the first time in the whole\r\nrace she spoke to us.\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be better if Edith rode on?\" she said. \"I can take her\r\nplace. It seems useless to sacrifice her. It does not matter to me. I\r\ncannot now be afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid; but I remain,\" Edith said resolutely.\r\n\r\nThe ground under us began to heave. Whole acres of it swayed disjointed.\r\nWe were galloping on oscillating fragments, which trembled beneath us\r\nlike floating logs under boys at play. To jump these cracks--sometimes\r\nan upward bank, sometimes a deep drop, in addition to the width of the\r\nseam, had to be taken--pumped out the failing horses, and the hope that\r\nwas left to us disappeared utterly.\r\n\r\nThe glare of the red light behind waxed fiercer still, and a low\r\nrumbling as of distant thunder began to mutter round us. The air became\r\ndifficult to breathe. It was no longer air, but a mephitic stench that\r\nchoked us with disgusting fumes. Then a great shock shook the land, and\r\nright in front of us a seam opened that must have been fully fifteen\r\nfeet in width. Natalie was the first to see it. She observed it too late\r\nto stop.\r\n\r\nIn the same mechanical way as she had acted before, she settled herself\r\nin the saddle, struck the pony with her hand, and raced him at the\r\nchasm. He cleared it with little to spare. Edith's took it next with\r\nless. Then my turn came. Before I could shake up my tired horse,\r\nMademoiselle Véret said quickly:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur has done enough. He will now permit me to alight. This time\r\nthe horse cannot jump over with both.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall jump over with both, Mademoiselle, or he shall jump in,\" I\r\nanswered. \"Don't look down when we are crossing.\"\r\n\r\nThe horse just got over, but he came to his knees, and we fell forward\r\nover his shoulder. The girl's head struck full on a slab of rock, and a\r\nfaint moan was all that told me she was alive as I arose half stunned to\r\nmy feet. My first thought was for the horse, for on him all depended. He\r\nwas uninjured, apparently, but hardly able to stand from the shock and\r\nthe stress of fatigue.\r\n\r\nEdith Metford had dismounted and caught him; she was holding the bridle\r\nin her left hand, and winced as if in pain when I accidentally brushed\r\nagainst her right shoulder. I tied the horse to a young palm, and\r\nbegged the girl to ride on. She obeyed me reluctantly. Natalie had to\r\nassist her to remount, so she must have been injured. When I saw her\r\nsafely in her saddle, I ran back to Mademoiselle Véret.\r\n\r\nThe chasm was fast widening. From either side great fragments were\r\nbreaking off and falling in with a roar of loose rocks crashing\r\ntogether, till far down the sound was dulled into a hollow boom. This\r\nended in low guttural, which growled up from an abysmal depth.\r\nMademoiselle Véret, or her dead body, lay now on the very edge of the\r\nseam, and I had to harden my heart before I could bring myself to\r\nventure close to it. But I had given my word, and there were no\r\nconditions in the promise when I made it.\r\n\r\nI was spared the ordeal. Just as I stepped forward, the slab of rock on\r\nwhich the girl lay broke off in front of me, and, tipping up, overturned\r\nitself into the chasm. Far below I could see the shimmer of the girl's\r\ndress as her body went plunging down into that awful pit. And\r\nremembering her generous courage and offer of self-sacrifice, I felt\r\ntears rise in my eyes. But there was no time for tears.\r\n\r\nI leaped on the bay, and got him into something approaching a gallop,\r\nshouting at the others to keep on, for they were now returning. When I\r\ncame up with them, Edith Metford said with a shiver:\r\n\r\n\"The girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is at the bottom of the pit. Ride on.\"\r\n\r\nWe gained the shore at last; and our presence there produced the\r\nexplanation of the absence of the natives on the pathway to the sea.\r\nThey were there before us. Lying prostrate on the beach in hundreds,\r\nthey raised their bodies partly from the sands, like a resurrection of\r\nthe already dead, and there then rang out upon the night air a sound\r\nsuch as my ears had never before heard in my life, such as, I pray God,\r\nthey may never listen to again. I do not know what that dreadful\r\ndeath-wail meant in words, only that it touched the lowest depths of\r\nhuman horror. All along the beach that fearful chorus of the damned\r\nwailed forth, and echoed back from rock and cliff. The cry for mercy\r\ncould not be mistaken--the supplication blended with despair. They were\r\npraying to us--their evil spirits, for this wrong had been wrought them\r\nby our advent, if not by ourselves.\r\n\r\nI cannot dwell upon the scene. I could not describe it. I would not if I\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThe steamer was still in her berth; her head was pointed seawards. Loud\r\norders rang over the water. The roar of the chain running out through\r\nthe hawse-hole and the heavy splash could not be mistaken. Anderson had\r\nslipped his cable. Then the chime of the telegraph on the bridge was\r\nfollowed almost instantly by the first smashing stroke of the propeller.\r\n\r\nThe _Esmeralda_ was under weigh!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Esmeralda_ was putting out to sea when I thought of a last\r\nexpedient to draw the attention of her captain. Filling my revolver with\r\ncartridges which I had loose in my pockets, I fired all the chambers as\r\nfast as I could snap the trigger.\r\n\r\nMy signals were heard, and Anderson proved true to his bargain. He\r\nimmediately reversed his engines, and, when he had backed in as close as\r\nhe thought safe, sent a boat ashore for us. We got into it without any\r\nobstruction from the cowering natives, who only shrank from us in\r\nhorror, now that their prayers had failed to move us. The moment our\r\nboat was made fast to the steamer's davit ropes and we were pulled out\r\nof the water, \"full speed ahead\" was rung from the bridge. We were\r\nraised to the deck while the vessel was getting up speed.\r\n\r\nI crawled up the ladder to the bridge feebly, for I was becoming stiff\r\nfrom the bruises of the fall from my horse. Anderson received me coldly,\r\nand listened indifferently to my thanks. An agreement such as ours\r\nhardly prepared me for his loyalty.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, as to that,\" he interrupted, \"when I make a bargain my word is my\r\nbond. On this occasion I am inclined to think the indenture will be a\r\nfinal one.\"\r\n\r\nHis bargain was a hard one, but, having made it, he abided faithfully by\r\nits conditions. He was honest, therefore, in his own way.\r\n\r\n\"How far can you get out in fifteen minutes?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"We may make six or seven knots. But what is the good of that? There\r\nwill be an earthquake on that island on a liberal scale--on such a scale\r\nthat this ship would have very little chance in the wave that will\r\nfollow us if we were fifty miles at sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have taken every precaution, of course--\"\r\n\r\nAnderson here looked at me contemptuously, and, with an air of sarcastic\r\nadmiration, he said:\r\n\r\n\"You have guessed it at the first try. That is precisely what I have\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! don't take offence at trifles at a time like this,\" I said\r\ntestily. \"If you knew as much about that earthquake as I do, you would\r\nbe in no humour for bandying phrases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might I ask how much you do know about it? You could not have foreseen\r\nthe trouble more clearly if you had made it yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not make it myself, but I know the means which the man who did\r\nemployed, and but for me that earthquake would have wrecked this earth.\"\r\n\r\nAnderson made no direct answer to this, but he said earnestly:\r\n\r\n\"You will now go below, sir. You are done up. Roberts will take you to\r\nthe doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not done up, and I mean to see it out,\" I retorted doggedly. My\r\nnervous system was completely unhinged, and a fit of stupid obstinacy\r\ncame on me which rendered any interference with my actions intolerable.\r\n\r\n\"Then you cannot see it out upon my bridge,\" Anderson said. The\r\ndetermined tone in which he spoke only added to my impotent wrath.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I will return to the deck, and if any of your men should\r\nattempt to interfere with me he will do so at his peril.\" With that, I\r\nslung my revolver round so as to have it ready to my hand. I was beside\r\nmyself. My conduct was already bad enough, but I made it worse before I\r\nleft the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"And if you, Anderson, disobey my orders--my orders, do you hear?--an\r\nexplosion such as took place in the middle of the English channel shall\r\ntake place in the middle of this ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake leave the bridge. I want my wits about me, and I have no\r\nintention of earning another exhibition of your devilries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then be careful not to trouble me again.\" Thus after having passed\r\nthrough much danger with a spirit not unbecoming--as I hope--an English\r\ngentleman, I acted, when the worst was passed, like a peevish schoolboy.\r\nI am ashamed of my conduct in this small matter, and trust it will pass\r\nwithout much notice in the narrative of events of greater moment.\r\n\r\nOn deck, Natalie Brande, Edith Metford, and Percival were standing\r\ntogether, their eyes fixed on the island. Edith's face was deathly\r\nwhite, even in the ruddy glow which was now over land and sea. When I\r\nsaw her pallor, my evil temper passed away.\r\n\r\n\"It would be impossible for you to be quite well,\" I said to her\r\nanxiously; \"but has anything happened since I left you? You are very\r\npale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" she answered, \"I'm all right; a little faint after that ride. I\r\nshall be better soon.\"\r\n\r\nNatalie turned her weird eyes on me and said in the hollow voice we had\r\nheard once before--when she spoke to us on the island--\"That is her way\r\nof telling you that your horse broke her right arm when she caught him\r\nfor you. She held him, you remember, with her left hand. The doctor has\r\nset the limb. She will not suffer long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven help us, this awful night,\" Edith cried. \"How do you know that,\r\nNatalie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know much now, but I shall know more soon.\" After this she would not\r\nspeak again.\r\n\r\nWith every pound of steam on that the _Esmeralda's_ boilers would bear\r\nwithout bursting, we were now plunging through the great rollers of the\r\nArafura Sea. Everything had indeed been done to put the vessel in trim.\r\nShe was cleared for action, so to speak. And a gallant fight she made\r\nwhen the issue was knit. When the hour of midnight must be near at\r\nhand, I looked at my watch. It was one minute to twelve o'clock.\r\n\r\nThirty seconds more!\r\n\r\nThe stupendous corona of flame which hung over the island was pierced by\r\nlong lines of smoke that stretched far above the glare and clutched with\r\nsooty fingers at the stars, now fitfully coming back to view at our\r\ndistance. The rumbling of internal thunder waxed louder.\r\n\r\nFifteen seconds now!\r\n\r\nFearful peals rent the atmosphere. Vast tongues of flame protruded\r\nheavenward. The elements must be melting in that fervent heat. The\r\nblazing bowels of the earth were pouring forth.\r\n\r\nTwelve, midnight!\r\n\r\nA reverberation thundered out which shook the solid earth, and a roaring\r\nhell-breath of flame and smoke belched up so awful in its dread\r\nmagnificence that every man who saw it and lived to tell his story might\r\njustly have claimed to have seen perdition. In that hurricane of\r\nincandescent matter the island was blotted out for ever from the map of\r\nthis world.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the speed of the _Esmeralda_ she was a sloth when\r\ncompared with the speed of the wave from such an earthquake. From the\r\nglare of the illumination to perfect darkness the contrast was sudden\r\nand extreme. But the blackness of the ocean was soon whitened by the\r\nsnowy plumes of the avalanche of water which was now racing us, far\r\nastern as yet, but gaining fast. I, who had no business about the ship\r\nrequiring my presence in any special part, decided to wait on deck and\r\nlash myself to the forward, which would be practically the lee-side of a\r\ndeckhouse. Edith Metford we prevailed on to go below, that she might not\r\nrun the risk of further injury to her fractured arm. As she left us she\r\nwhispered to me, \"So Natalie will be with you at the end, and I--\" a sob\r\nstopped her. And it came into my mind at that moment that this girl had\r\nacted very nobly, and that I had hardly appreciated her and all that she\r\nhad done for me.\r\n\r\nNatalie refused to leave the deck. I lashed her securely beside me.\r\nTogether we awaited the end. When the roar of the following wave came\r\nclose, so close that the voices of the officers of the ship could be no\r\nlonger heard, Natalie spoke. The hollow sound was no longer in her\r\nvoice. Her own soft sweet tones had come back.\r\n\r\n\"Arthur,\" she asked, \"is this the end?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear it is,\" I answered, speaking close to her ear so that she might\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n\"Then we have little time, and I have something which I must say, which\r\nyou must promise me to remember when--when--I am no longer with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be always with me while we live. I think I deserve that at\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you deserve that and more. I will be with you while I live, but\r\nthat will not be for long.\"\r\n\r\nI was about to interrupt her when she put her soft little hand upon my\r\nlips and said:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, there is very little time. It is all a mistake. I mean Herbert\r\nwas wrong. He might as well have let me have my earthly span of\r\nhappiness or folly--call it what you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see that now--thank God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I see it too late, I did not know it until--until I was dead.\r\nHush!\" Again I tried to interrupt her, for I thought her mind was\r\nwandering. \"I died psychically with Herbert. That was when we first saw\r\nthe light on the island. Since then I have lived mechanically, but it\r\nhas only been life in so low a form that I do not now know what has\r\nhappened between that time and this. And I could not now speak as I am\r\nspeaking save by a will power which is costing me very dear. But it is\r\nthe only voice you could hear. I do not therefore count the cost. My\r\nbrother's brain so far overmatched my own that it first absorbed and\r\nfinally destroyed my mental vitality. This influence removed, I am a\r\nrudderless ship at sea--bound to perish.\"\r\n\r\n\"May his torments endure for ever. May the nethermost pit of hell\r\nreceive him!\" I said with a groan of agony.\r\n\r\nBut Natalie said: \"Hush! I might have lingered on a little longer, but I\r\nchose to concentrate the vital force which would have lasted me a few\r\nmore senile years into the minutes necessary for this message from me to\r\nyou--a message I could not have given you if he were not dead. And I am\r\ndying so that you may hear it. Dying! My God! I am already dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to struggle against some force that battled with her, and the\r\nroar of many waters was louder around us before she was able to speak\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Bend lower, Arthur; my strength is failing, and I have not yet said\r\nthat for which I am here. Lower still.\r\n\r\n\"I said it is all a mistake--a hideous mistake. Existence as we know it\r\nis ephemeral. Suffering is ephemeral. There is nothing everlasting but\r\nlove. There is nothing eternal but mind. Your mind is mine. Your love is\r\nmine. Your human life may belong to whomsoever you will it. It ought to\r\nbelong to that brave girl below. I do not grudge it to her, for I have\r\n_you_. We two shall be together through the ages--for ever and for ever.\r\nHeart of my heart, you have striven manfully and well, and if you did\r\nnot altogether succeed in saving my flesh from premature corruption, be\r\nsatisfied in that you have my soul. Ah!\"\r\n\r\nShe pressed her hands to her head as if in dreadful pain. When she spoke\r\nagain her voice came in short gasps.\r\n\r\n\"My brain is reeling. I do not know what I am saying,\" she cried,\r\ndistraught. \"I do not know whether I am saying what is true or only what\r\nI imagine to be true. I know nothing but this. I was mesmerised. I have\r\nbeen so for two years. But for that I would have been happy in your\r\nlove--for I was a woman before this hideous influence benumbed me. They\r\ntold me it was only a fool's paradise that I missed. But I only know\r\nthat I have missed it. Missed it--and the darkness of death is upon me.\"\r\n\r\nShe ceased to speak. A shudder convulsed her, and then her head sank\r\ngently on my shoulder.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the great wave broke over the vessel, whirling her\r\nhelpless like a cork on the ripples of a mill pond; lashing her with\r\nmighty strokes; sweeping in giant cataracts from stern to stem;\r\nsmashing, tearing everything; deluging her with hissing torrents;\r\ncrushing her with avalanches of raging foam. Then the ocean tornado\r\npassed on and left the _Esmeralda_ behind, with half the crew disabled\r\nand many lost, her decks a mass of wreckage, her masts gone. The\r\ncrippled ship barely floated. When the last torrent of spray passed, and\r\nI was able to look to Natalie, her head had drooped down on her breast.\r\nI raised her face gently and looked into her wide open eyes.\r\n\r\nShe was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking up my girl's body in my arms, I stumbled over the\r\nwreck-encumbered deck, and bore it to the state-room she had occupied on\r\nthe outward voyage. Percival was too busy attending to wounded sailors\r\nto be interrupted. His services, I knew, were useless now, but I wanted\r\nhim to refute or corroborate a conviction which my own medical knowledge\r\nhad forced upon me. The thought was so repellent, I clung to any hope\r\nwhich might lead to its dispersion. I waited alone with my dead.\r\n\r\nPercival came after an hour, which seemed to me an eternity. He\r\nstammered out some incoherent words of sympathy as soon as he looked in\r\nmy face. But this was not the purpose for which I had detached him from\r\nhis pressing duties elsewhere. I made a gesture towards the dead girl.\r\nHe attended to it immediately. I watched closely and took care that the\r\nlight should be on his face, so that I might read his eyes rather than\r\nlisten to his words.\r\n\r\n\"She has fainted!\" he exclaimed, as he approached the rigid figure. I\r\nsaid nothing until he turned and faced me. Then I read his eyes. He said\r\nslowly: \"You are aware, Marcel, that--that she is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"That she has been dead--several hours?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"But let me think. It was only an hour--\"\r\n\r\n\"No; do not think,\" I interrupted. \"There are things in this voyage\r\nwhich will not bear to be thought of. I thank you for coming so soon.\r\nYou will forgive me for troubling you when you have so much to do\r\nelsewhere. And now leave us alone. I mean, leave me alone.\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed my hand, and went away without a word. I am that man's\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nThey buried her at sea.\r\n\r\nI was happily unconscious at the time, and so was spared that scene.\r\nEdith Metford, weak and suffering as she was, went through it all. She\r\nhas told me nothing about it, save that it was done. More than that I\r\ncould not bear. And I have borne much.\r\n\r\nThe voyage home was a dreary episode. There is little more to tell, and\r\nit must be told quickly. Percival was kind, but it distressed me to find\r\nthat he now plainly regarded me as weak-minded from the stress of my\r\ntrouble. Once, in the extremity of my misery, I began a relation of my\r\nadventures to him, for I wanted his help. The look upon his face was\r\nenough for me. I did not make the same mistake again.\r\n\r\nTo Anderson I made amends for my extravagant display of temper. He\r\nreceived me more kindly than I expected. I no longer thought of the\r\nmoney that had passed between us. And, to do him tardy justice, I do not\r\nthink he thought of it either. At least he did not offer any of it back.\r\nHis scruples, I presume, were conscientious. Indeed, I was no longer\r\nworth a man's enmity. Sympathy was now the only indignity that could be\r\nput upon me. And Anderson did not trespass in that direction. My misery\r\nwas, I thought, complete. One note must still be struck in that long\r\ndiscord of despair.\r\n\r\nWe were steaming along the southern coast of Java. For many hours the\r\nrugged cliffs and giant rocks which fence the island against the\r\nonslaught of the Indian Ocean had passed before us as in review, and\r\nwe--Edith Metford and I--sat on the deck silently, with many thoughts in\r\ncommon, but without the interchange of a spoken word. The stern,\r\nforbidding aspect of that iron coast increased the gloom which had\r\nsettled on my brain. Its ramparts of lonely sea-drenched crags depressed\r\nme below the mental zero that was now habitual with me. The sun went\r\ndown in a red glare, which moved me not. The short twilight passed\r\nquickly, but I noticed nothing. Then night came. The restless sea\r\ndisappeared in darkness. The grand march past of the silent stars began.\r\nBut I neither knew nor cared.\r\n\r\nA soft whisper stirred me.\r\n\r\n\"Arthur, for God's sake rouse yourself! You are brooding a great deal\r\ntoo much. It will destroy you.\"\r\n\r\nListlessly I put my hand in hers, and clasped her fingers gently.\r\n\r\n\"Bear with me!\" I pleaded.\r\n\r\n\"I will bear with you for ever. But you must fight on. You have not won\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nor ever shall. I have fought my last fight. The victory may go to\r\nwhosoever desires it.\"\r\n\r\nOn this she wept. I could not bear that she should suffer from my\r\nmisery, and so, guarding carefully her injured arm, I drew her close to\r\nme. And then, out of the darkness of the night, far over the solitude of\r\nthe sea, there came to us the sound of a voice. That voice was a woman's\r\nwail. The girl beside me shuddered and drew back. I did not ask her if\r\nshe had heard. I knew she had heard.\r\n\r\nWe arose and stood apart without any explanation. From that moment a\r\ncaress would have been a sacrilege. I did not hear that weird sound\r\nagain, nor aught else for an hour or more save the bursting of the\r\nbreakers on the crags of Java.\r\n\r\nI kept no record of the commonplaces of our voyage thereafter. It only\r\nremains for me to say that I arrived in England broken in health and\r\nbankrupt in fortune. Brande left no money. His formula for the\r\ntransmutation of metals is unintelligible to me. I can make no use of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEdith Metford remains my friend. To part utterly after what we have\r\nundergone together is beyond our strength. But between us there is a\r\nnameless shadow, reminiscent of that awful night in the Arafura Sea,\r\nwhen death came very near to us. And in my ears there is always the echo\r\nof that voice which I heard by the shores of Java when the misty\r\nborderland between life and death seemed clear.\r\n\r\nMy story is told. I cannot prove its truth, for there is much in it to\r\nwhich I am the only living witness. I cannot prove whether Herbert\r\nBrande was a scientific magician possessed of _all_ the powers he\r\nclaimed, or merely a mad physicist in charge of a new and terrible\r\nexplosive; nor whether Edward Grey ever started for Labrador. The\r\nburthen of the proof of this last must be borne by others--unless it be\r\nleft to Grey himself to show whether my evidence is false or true. If\r\nit be left to him, a few years will decide the issue.\r\n\r\nI am content to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON: DIGBY, LONG AND CO., PUBLISHERS, 18 BOUVERIE STREET, FLEET\r\nSTREET, E.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT CROMIE'S BOOKS\r\n\r\n_OPINIONS OF THE PRESS_\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLUNGE INTO SPACE\r\n\r\nWITH PREFACE BY JULES VERNE\r\n\r\n_Times._--The story is written with considerable liveliness, the\r\nscientific jargon is sufficiently perplexing, and the characters are\r\nsketched with some humour.\r\n\r\n_Chronicle._--A strange, weird, mysterious story that holds the reader\r\nspell-bound, from the first page to the last.\r\n\r\n_Athenæum._--Mr. Cromie's Utopia is charming, and the quasi-scientific\r\ndetail of the expedition is given with so much integrity that we hardly\r\nwonder at the marvellous results accomplished.\r\n\r\n_Truth._--A very clever description of a flight through space to Mars\r\n... the book is extremely interesting and suggestive; especially,\r\nperhaps, where it attacks the theories of Mr. George and \"Looking\r\nBackwards.\"\r\n\r\n_Court Journal._--Mr. Robert Cromie's remarkably clever and entertaining\r\nvolume is told with much of the vivid fancy of a Jules Verne--with\r\nremarkable picturesqueness, and the experiences of mortals in Mars are\r\ndescribed with considerable humour.\r\n\r\n_Review of Reviews._--An unquestionably interesting story.
